grade I and HB grade > I was 23 mm (c-index 0.68) and between class A/B and C/D 
hearing was 18 mm (c-index 0.68). Tumors within 3 mm of the 17-mm CPA threshold 
displayed similarly strong c-indices. Among purely intracanalicular tumors, 
linear size was not found to portend worse outcomes for all measures.
CONCLUSIONS: The probability of incurring less optimal microsurgical outcomes 
begins to significantly increase at 14-20 mm of CPA extension. Although many 
factors ultimately influence decision-making, when considering timing of 
microsurgical resection, using a size threshold range as depicted in this study 
offers an evidence-based approach that moves beyond reflexively recommending 
treatment for all tumors after detecting ≥ 2 mm of tumor growth on serial MRI 
studies.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between providing or receiving family 
support and risk of mortality in non-frail, pre-frail and frail older people.
METHODS: Data were obtained from Taiwan's Longitudinal Study on Aging (TLSA) 
from 1996 to 2007 for 2186 people (1207 males; 979 females) aged ≥ 67 years at 
the time of 1996 follow-up survey. These older adults were categorized as being 
non-frail (normal), pre-frail, and frail, with frailty defined as the presence 
of three or more of the following criteria: shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, 
slowness, and low physical activity. Cox regression analysis was used to examine 
the association between the people's providing family support or their receiving 
family support on mortality, after adjustment for several demographic and health 
status covariates.
RESULTS: The participants (55.9% male) had an average age of 73.8 (SD 5.5) 
years. In total, 886 (40.5%) were classified as non-frail, 886 (40.5%) as 
pre-frail and 414 (19.9%) as frail. Multivariate Cox regression analysis 
revealed a significant association between providing family support and lower 
mortality rates in the non-frail older adults (hazard ratio 0.913; 95% 
confidence interval 0.855-0.975; p = 0.0063). This association was also 
significant in the younger (67-74 years old) pre-frail males but not females 
after adjustment. No significant association was found between receiving family 
support and mortality risk regardless of the frailty status, age, or gender.
CONCLUSIONS: Providing family support to others may prolong life expectancy of 
the pre-frail older adults.

BACKGROUND: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a burdensome, chronic and autoimmune 
disease of the central nervous system. We aimed to report the incidence, 
prevalence, mortality, and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) of MS in Iran 
at a national level for different age and sex groups over a period of 28 years 
(1990-2017).
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease study (GBD) from 
1990 to 2017, published by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The 
incidence of DALYs and prevalence of MS were estimated to report the burden of 
MS based on sex and age in Iran from 1990 to 2017.
RESULTS: At the national level, the Age-Standardized Incidence Rate (ASIR), 
Age-Standardized Prevalence Rate (ASPR), Age-Standardized DALYs Rate (ASDR) and 
the Age-Standardized Mortality Rate (ASMR) in Iran in 2017 were 2.4 (95% 
Uncertainty Interval [UI]: 2.1 to 2.7), 69.5 (62.1 to 77.8), 29.1 (23.6 to 
34.7), and 0.4 (0.3 to 0.4) per 100,000 population, respectively. During the 
period of 1990 to 2017, all measures increased, and were higher among females. 
The incidence rate began upward trend at the age of 20 and attained its highest 
level at the age of 25.
CONCLUSION: In Iran, all of the age-standardized MS rates have been increasing 
during the 28 years from 1990 to 2017. Our findings can help policy makers and 
health planners to design and communicate their plans and to have a better 
resource allocation, depending on the incidence and prevalence of the growing 
numbers of MS patients in Iran.

mortality in England: cross-sectional evidence for 2013/2014.

OBJECTIVES: The first objective is to estimate the joint impact of social care, 
public health and healthcare expenditure on mortality in England. The second 
objective is to use these results to estimate the impact of spending constraints 
in 2010/2011-2014/2015 on total mortality.
METHODS: The impact of social care, healthcare and public health expenditure on 
mortality is analysed by applying the two-stage least squares method to local 
authority data for 2013/2014. Next, we compare the growth in healthcare and 
social care expenditure pre-2010 and post-2010. We use the difference between 
these growth rates and the responsiveness of mortality to changes in expenditure 
taken from the 2013/2014 cross-sectional analysis to estimate the additional 
mortality generated by post-2010 spending constraints.
RESULTS: Our most conservative results suggest that (1) a 1% increase in 
healthcare expenditure reduces mortality by 0.532%; (2) a 1% increase in social 
care expenditure reduces mortality by 0.336%; and (3) a 1% increase in local 
public health spending reduces mortality by 0.019%. Using the first two of these 
elasticities and data on the change in spending growth between 
2001/2002-2009/2010 and 2010/2011-2014/2015, we find that there were 57 550 (CI 
3075 to 111 955) more deaths in the latter period than would have been observed 
had spending growth during this period matched that in 2001/2002-2009/2010.
CONCLUSIONS: All three forms of public healthcare-related expenditure save lives 
and there is evidence that additional social care expenditure is more than twice 
as productive as additional healthcare expenditure. Our results are consistent 
with the hypothesis that the slowdown in the rate of improvement in life 
expectancy in England and Wales since 2010 is attributable to spending 
constraints in the healthcare and social care sectors.

Dementia is one of the leading causes of death and disability in older 
population. Previous reports have shown that antidementia medications are 
associated with longer survival; nonetheless, the prevalence of their use and 
the compliance with them are quite different worldwide. There is hardly any 
available information about the pharmacoepidemiology of these drugs in the 
Eastern-European region; we aimed to analyze the use of cholinesterase 
inhibitors (ChEis) for the treatment of dementia to provide real-life 
information from the Eastern European region. All medical and medication 
prescription reports of the in- and outpatient specialist services collected in 
the NEUROHUN database in Hungary were analyzed between 2013 and 2016. Survival, 
adherence, and persistence values were calculated. 8803 patients were treated 
with ChEis during the study period, which was only 14.5% of the diagnosed 
demented patients. The survival of treated patients (more than 4 years) was 
significantly longer than patients without ChEi treatment (2.50 years). The best 
compliance was observed with rivastigmine patch. Choosing the appropriate 
medication as soon as possible after the dementia diagnosis may lead to 
increased life expectancy.

Advance care planning (ACP) is a process that guarantees the respect of the 
patient's values and priorities about his/her future care at the end of life. It 
consists of multiple conversations with the health professional that may lead to 
the completion of Advance Directives (AD), a set of legal documents helpful to 
clinicians and family members for making critical decisions on behalf of the 
patient, whereas he/she might become incapable. Over the past years, ACP has 
become particularly relevant for the growth of chronic diseases, the increase in 
life expectancy, and the growing attention paid to the patient's decisional 
autonomy. Several nations have introduced specific regulations of ACP and AD. 
However, their diffusion is accompanied by unforeseen limitations and issues, 
burdening their complete and systematic adoption. The present article describes 
several controversial aspects of ACP and some of the most significant challenges 
in end-of-life care.

Cost-effective threshold (CET) is essential for health technology assessment and 
decision-making based on health economic evaluations. Recently, it has been 
argued that the commonly used once and three times of gross domestic product 
(GDP) per capita CETs of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) are not necessarily 
empirically supported in all countries. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the CET 
of a QALY as times of GDP per capita in China, of which the reimbursement 
coverage decisions are increasingly engaging economic evaluations. Estimates on 
the value of statistical life (VSL) in China were identified from several 
studies in the literature and converted to times of GDP per capita, the weighted 
average of which was used for subsequent calculation. By pooling data on 
population mortality, health utility, and age distribution, we estimated the 
value of a statistical QALY (VSQ) from VSL using an established mathematical 
process, which represented the theoretical upper bound of CET. The corresponding 
point estimate and theoretical lower bound were obtained using their numerical 
relationships with the upper bound. Scenarios analyses were also conducted. The 
estimated CET, its upper bound, and its lower bound were 1.45, 2.90, and 1.16 
times of GDP per capita in China, respectively. In different scenarios, the 
estimated CET varied but was greater than once GDP per capita in most cases. As 
such, the CET of a QALY in China is close to 1.5 times of GDP per capita, which 
should be benchmarked for future ICER-based coverage decisions.

Though an impressive array of health outcomes has been studied, research within 
the field of religion and health has not yet considered how religious 
involvement may affect future expectations about health. This is a significant 
shortcoming because the teachings of many religions direct adherent's focus to 
the distant future, and future self-ratings of health are a known predictor of 
subjective life expectancy and eventual mortality risk. Recognizing the need for 
a life course approach to conceptualizing patterns of religious involvement, we 
assess how stability or change in religious attendance from childhood to 
adulthood structures individual expectations of future health. Drawing on data 
from the 2017 Values and Beliefs of the American Public Study (Baylor Religion 
Survey Wave 5), we find that stable high (weekly) attendance between childhood 
and adulthood is associated with higher future health expectations. Parametric 
mediation analyses conducted in the counterfactual framework suggest that this 
association is explained by the tendency of frequent stable attenders to have 
(a) higher levels of beliefs in the sense of divine control and (b) a lower 
likelihood of engaging in harmful health behaviors (smoking).

The BTB (broad-complex, tram track, and bric-abrac) proteins are involved in 
developmental processes, biotic, and abiotic stress responses in various plants, 
but the molecular basis of protein interactions is yet to be investiagted in 
rice. In this study, the identified BTB proteins were divided into BTB-TAZ, 
MATH-BTB, BTB-NPH, BTB-ANK, BTB-Skp, BTB-DUF, and BTB-TPR subfamilies based on 
the additional functional domains found together with the BTB domain at N- and 
C-terminal as well. This suggesting that the extension region at both terminal 
sites could play a vital role in the BTB gene family expansion in plants. The 
yeast two-hybrid system, firefly luciferase complementation imaging (LCI) assay 
and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay further confirmed that 
BTB proteins interact with several other proteins to perform a certain 
developmental process in plants. The overexpression of BTB genes of each 
subfamily in Arabidopsis revealed that BTB genes including OsBTB4, OsBTB8, 
OsBTB64, OsBTB62, OsBTB138, and OsBTB147, containing certain additional 
functional domains, could play a potential role in the early flowering, 
branching, leaf, and silique development. Thus we concluded that the presence of 
other functional domains such as TAZ, SKP, DUF, ANK, NPH, BACK, PQQ, and MATH 
could be the factor driving the diverse functions of BTB proteins in plant 
biology.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative 
disorder and is characterized by major pathological hallmarks in the brain, 
including plaques composed of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles 
of tau protein. Genetic studies, biochemical data, and animal models have 
suggested that Aβ is a critical species in the pathogenesis of AD. Aβ molecules 
aggregate to form oligomers, protofibrils (PFs), and mature fibrils. Because of 
their instability and structural heterogeneity, the misfolding and aggregation 
of Aβ is a highly complex process, leading to a variety of aggregates with 
different structures and morphologies. However, the elucidation of Aβ molecules 
is essential because they are believed to play an important role in AD 
pathogenesis. Recent combination studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have primarily revealed more detailed 
information about their aggregation process, including fibril extension and 
secondary nucleation, and the structural polymorphism of the fibrils under a 
variety of some conditions, including the actual brain. This review attempts to 
summarize the existing information on the major properties of the structure and 
aggregation of Aβ.

Conditioned craving to trauma cues and avoidance learning have both been 
implicated in the high concurrence of trauma-related distress and substance 
misuse. Using a cue-exposure paradigm involving personalized trauma, cannabis, 
and neutral cues, we examined if conditioned craving and/or elevated negative 
affect to trauma cues are mechanisms linking PTSD and cannabis use disorder. 
Fifty-one trauma-exposed cannabis users were randomly presented the three cue 
types. Craving and emotional responses were evaluated after each cue using the 
Marijuana Craving Questionnaire-Short Form (Heishman et al., 2001) and the 
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (Watson et al., 1988). Relief cannabis 
craving (compulsivity and emotionality) was significantly higher after trauma 
than cannabis and neutral cues (p's < 0.001) and was also higher among those 
with more severe PTSD symptoms (p's < 0.05). The relationship between PTSD 
symptom severity and cannabis craving was stronger after trauma than cannabis 
cues for the compulsivity component of craving (p < .05). Relief craving was 
also higher after the cannabis cue than after the neutral cue (expectancy and 
purposefulness; p < .001). Negative affect was significantly higher: after 
trauma than cannabis and neutral cues (p's < 0.001); and among those with more 
severe PTSD symptoms (p < . 005). Positive affect was significantly lower after 
trauma than cannabis cues (p < .05). Trauma cue exposure might promote cannabis 
misuse through conditioned craving as well as the desire to relieve negative 
affect. Conditioned cannabis craving involving an uncontrollable compulsion to 
use cannabis in response to trauma reminders appears particularly likely among 
cannabis users with more severe PTSD symptoms.

BACKGROUND: The health and economic benefits of immunization may extend beyond 
the elements traditionally included in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). This 
review investigated how broader impacts are considered in economic evaluations 
of vaccines and whether their inclusion would substantially change CEA findings.
METHODS: We reviewed CEAs of vaccines associated with the largest global health 
burden, published from 2014 to 2019 using the Tufts CEA Registry and Tufts 
Global Health CEA Registry. We supplemented this with a systematic review of 
published and grey literature. We conducted descriptive analyses to examine the 
frequency of inclusion of specific social factors and study characteristics 
associated with their inclusion. We also conducted a case study of the human 
papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine to illustrate the potential change in CEA findings 
from selected social impacts.
RESULTS: We identified 475 relevant health economic assessments. Overall, 40% of 
studies included at least one category of social impact. The most commonly 
included non-healthcare cost among cost-per-QALY studies was productivity (25%), 
while cost-per-DALY studies reported transportation costs most frequently (24%). 
Few studies examined the impact of vaccination on other sectors such as 
education and housing (<3%). Middle-income and North American settings were 
positively associated with social impact inclusion, while sub-Saharan African 
location was negatively associated. In the HPV case study, the addition of 
nonhealth costs improved cost-effectiveness by up to 90% or made the vaccine 
cost-saving, depending on geographic setting. The cost-saving scenario saved up 
to $30,000 in costs per case of cervical cancer averted.
CONCLUSIONS: A minority of vaccine CEAs include social impacts, particularly for 
nonhealth sectors. The omission of these impacts may result in a systematic 
undervaluation of vaccines from a societal perspective. Further efforts are 
required to document the full benefits of vaccination for policymaker 
consideration.

Dark tea, a unique tea fermented primarily in China, has numerous potential 
beneficial effects. However, harmful substances present in dark tea have 
provoked significant concern. To conduct a quantitative benefit-risk assessment 
of dark tea for Chinese residents and provide guidance on rational consumption, 
a framework of Benefit-Risk Analysis for Foods (BRAFO) and meta-analysis was 
applied to construct a disability-adjusted life year (DALY). Based on the 
BRAFO-tiered approach, a reference scenario (no intake) and an alternative 
scenario (intake of 3 cups/day) were determined. The overall health impacts of 
dark tea were simulated by comparing the risks of fluoride and AF with benefits 
of reduced-risk to coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes in different 
scenarios. Three cups of fermented tea consumed per day decreased risks of CHD 
and diabetes by 8.16% and 12.77% respectively. After quantitative integration of 
information, the ultimate net health effect was found to be -1958.827 
illustrating that the benefits of drinking three cups of dark tea per day 
outweigh the risks. However, considering the uncertainties in the process, 
decision-makers should proceed with caution, consulting additional 
well-conducted studies and further managing harmful substances in dark tea.

PURPOSE: To investigate the burden of near vision loss (NVL) in China by year, 
age and gender from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: We used estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study to 
report the prevalence and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to NVL in 
China. Estimates of crude counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 
population are accompanied by 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We summarised the 
age-specific and sex-specific patterns and trends regarding the burden of NVL in 
China, compared with seven neighbouring countries.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the all-age number and rate for NVL prevalence and 
DALYs increased significantly in China (all p<0.001). The age-standardised rate 
decreased from 7538.1 (95% UI 6946.3 to 8075.1) to 7392.9 (95% UI 6855.8 to 
7890.5) per 100 000 population for NVL prevalence (p=0.107), and from 74.9 (95% 
UI 69.6 to 79.9) to 73.8 (95% UI 70.6 to 80.1) per 100 000 population for DALYs 
(p=0.388). Women had higher NVL prevalence (t=170.1, p<0.001) and DALYs 
(t=192.5, p<0.001) than men. Higher disease burden of NVL was observed in the 
middle-aged and elderly population. The age-standardised prevalence and DALY 
rate attributable to NVL in China were lower than in India, North Korea, 
Pakistan (all p<0.001), but higher than Russia, South Korea, Singapore and Japan 
(all p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a small decrease in age-standardised prevalence and DALYs 
due to NVL in China in the past two decades, the existing burden is still 
considerable and significantly higher compared with neighbouring developed 
countries. An approach that includes all stakeholders is needed to further 
reduce this burden.

Összefoglaló. A COVID-19-fertőzésen átesett betegek közül többen elhúzódó 
panaszokról számolnak be a felépülést követően, sokaknál tartósan fennáll a 
köhögés, a nehézlégzés, a mellkasi fájdalom, a légszomj attól függetlenül, hogy 
enyhe vagy súlyosabb tüneteket okozott a koronavírus. A betegek erőtlennek érzik 
magukat, erős fáradtságérzetre panaszkodnak, míg mások gyomor-bél rendszeri 
panaszokra, fejfájásra, depresszióra, a szaglás- és ízérzékelés elvesztésére. 
Számtalan kutatás leírja, hogy a fertőzés még akár hónapokkal később is hatással 
lehet a tüdő működésére, és korábban egészséges tüdőn is látható a 
koronavírus-fertőzés a gyógyulás után három hónappal készült 
kontroll-mellkas-CT-leleten. Éppen ezért szükség van a fertőzés lezajlását 
követően tüdőgyógyászati kivizsgálásra, ha a betegnek elhúzódó panaszai vannak, 
vagy ha a betegség tüdőgyulladást okozott. Szükség van a jelenleg működő 
fekvőbeteg-légzőszervi rehabilitáció mellett a kezelés ambuláns kiterjesztésére 
is, melynek célja újabb kórházi ápolás nélkül a teljes gyógyulás elérése a 
betegeknél. A COVID-19-fertőzésen átesett betegeknél a komplex rehabilitáció 
hatására javul a terhelhetőség, az életminőség, javulnak a légzésfunkciós 
értékek, csökkennek a panaszok, javul a betegek fizikai és pszichikai állapota. 
Összefoglaló kutatásunk célja áttekinteni, hogy milyen COVID-19 ambuláns 
rehabilitációs programok indultak el a koronavírus-fertőzésen átesett betegek 
esetében nemzetközi és hazai színtereken. Orv Hetil. 22021; 162(42): 1671-1677. 
Summary. Several patients with COVID-19 infection report prolonged complaints 
after recovery and many of them suffer from persistent cough, dyspnea, chest 
pain and shortness of breath regardless of whether the coronavirus caused mild 
or more severe symptoms. They complain of severe fatigue and weakness while 
others grizzle about gastrointestinal complaints, headache, depression, loss of 
sense of smell and taste. Numerous studies describe that the infection can 
affect lung function even in months and coronavirus infection can be detectable 
in previously healthy lungs by taking a control chest CT scan three months after 
recovery. Therefore, chest follow-up is required after the infection if the 
patient has prolonged complaints or if the disease has caused pneumonia. In 
addition to the currently operating inpatient respiratory rehabilitation, there 
is also a need for an outpatient extension of treatment to achieve complete 
recovery in patients without further hospitalization. For those patients who 
have had the COVID-19 infection complex rehabilitation can improve their 
workload, quality of life, improves their respiratory function values, reduces 
their complaints and also improves their physical and mental condition. The aim 
of our summary research is to review what COVID-19 outpatient rehabilitation 
programs have been initiated for patients who went through coronavirus infection 
on international and domestic scenes. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(42): 1671-1677.

This paper examines the role of institutions-notably the degree of 
administrative decentralisation across levels of government-in health care 
decision-making and health spending as well as life expectancy. The empirical 
analysis builds on a new methodology to analyse health sector performance. In 
particular, the present analysis examines the impact of centralisation versus 
decentralisation of responsibilities across levels of government, making use of 
newly collected data on governance and expenditure assignment, as well as 
non-linear empirical specifications. An interlocking U-shaped relationship is 
found with respect to expenditure and life expectancy. Under moderate 
decentralisation, public spending in health care is lower, while life expectancy 
is higher, compared with more centralised systems; however, in highly 
decentralised systems, public spending is higher and life expectancy is lower. 
This finding of a "fish-shaped" relationship for decentralisation and outcomes 
also helps to understand recent reforms of OECD health systems, which have often 
reverted towards more moderate degrees of administrative decentralisation.

A significant increase in breast cancer is expected in the coming decades among 
people with disabilities. However, their participation rate in screening 
programs is significantly lower than women without disabilities. Our objective 
was therefore to analyse the barriers to breast cancer screening in people with 
disabilities based on a recent review of the international literature. The 
articles analysed were retrieved from the PUBMED database from 2014 to 2020 
using the following keywords "breast cancer", "screening" and "disability". A 
total of 37 studies were included, including 30 original articles and 7 
meta-analyses. The main barriers to performing breast cancer screening for women 
with disabilities were environmental factors such as lack of adapted 
transportation means or difficult access to medical facilities and mammography. 
To a lesser extent, the unsupportive views of family caregivers and health care 
staff about screening were also barriers to screening acceptance by people with 
disabilities. In general, breast cancer screening is a useful public health 
measure that reduces the burden of treatment and breast cancer-related 
mortality. Screening is useful for women over 50 years of age who have a 
sufficiently long-life expectancy, generally estimated at more than 10 years. 
Educational measures are needed to reduce the barriers to screening for PH who 
meet these criteria, their caregivers, and their providers so that they can 
actively participate in health care, rather than being marginalized because of 
their disability.

Socioeconomics of coronary artery calcium: Is it scored or ignored?

Electronic address: kim_a_williams@rush.edu.

IMPORTANCE: Chicago is one of the most racially segregated cities in the US, 
with the largest mortality gap between neighborhoods. Computed tomographic 
coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) is an excellent risk stratification tool, 
but costs about $200 out-of-pocket, making it inaccessible to some.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether this ACC/AHA guideline-recommended screening 
tool is accessible to all populations and neighborhoods, we evaluated the price 
and availability of CACS in Chicago area hospitals.
DESIGN: We used the Illinois Department of Public Health list of area hospitals 
to inquire about CACS availability and price. We compared these results to US 
Census Bureau data for each hospital's service area's demographic, ethnic and 
socioeconomic population characteristics.
RESULTS: Out of the 40 hospitals in Chicagoland, 30 offered CACS. The 10 
hospitals without CACS were smaller hospitals in zip codes with a higher 
population density (p ​< ​0.01), higher poverty rates (22% vs. 13%, p ​< ​0.01), 
lower percentage of white population (p ​< ​0.02), lower frequency of higher 
education (35% vs. 51%, p ​< ​0.05), and a trend toward more black residents 
(p ​< ​0.10). Life expectancy was greater in areas with CACS available (78 vs. 
75 years, p ​< ​0.05). Even in areas with CACS, there was wide price variation, 
with higher prices in poorer areas (r ​= ​0.57, p ​< ​0.01). The highest vs. 
lowest quintile of income had higher education, larger white population (80% vs. 
14%, p ​< ​0.0001), and longer life expectancy (81 vs. 72 years, p ​< ​0.0002), 
but tended to have a lower price of CACS ($86 vs. $487, p ​< ​0.08).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: CACS is a powerful, evidenced-based clinical tool, 
but the availability and price vary widely in Chicagoland, and directly 
correlate with the socioeconomic and health care disparities that are known to 
exist. Removing these barriers to coronary artery disease screening may be one 
method to improve the poor cardiovascular outcomes in these areas.

Introduction: Medical comorbidities (MCs) represent a significant burden in 
terms of more frequent hospitalizations and overall lower life expectancy among 
people with severe mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and related psychotic 
disorders (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). The present article aims to compare 
the prevalence of MCs and to examine the associated characteristics as marital 
status, job occupation, level of education, and living arrangements, between BD 
and SZ patients. Methods: One-hundred-eight-one patients with MCs (85/47% had BD 
and 96/53% had SZ) were recruited retrospectively from the Acute Inpatients 
Psychiatry Unit of Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, between January-2017 and 
December-2020. MCs were: cardiovascular diseases (CVD), bacterial infections, 
mycoses, viral diseases, neoplasms, musculoskeletal, respiratory tract, 
urological and male genital, gynecological, neurological, gastrointestinal, 
metabolic syndrome, nutritional, and metabolic diseases. Results: BD had more MC 
than SZ (36.2 vs. 28.2%, respectively, p = 0.04). CVD and metabolic MC were more 
common among BD (51.8 vs.34.4%; 51.8 vs.35.3%; p = 0.018; p = 0.039; 
respectively), while viral diseases were more frequent in SZ (13.5 vs.3.5%, p = 
0.035). Hypertension was common in both psychiatric illnesses (81.8% BD vs. 
65.6% SZ, p = 0.18). Obesity was the most frequent metabolic disease in both BD 
and SZ (75% BD vs. 73.5% SZ, p = 0.91), followed by diabetes mellitus (52.3% BD 
vs. 55.9% SZ, p = 0.93), metabolic syndrome (54.5% BD vs. 47.1% SZ, p = 0.67) 
and dysthyroidism (47.7% BD vs. 25.7% SZ, p = 0.093). After performing a binary 
logistic regression analysis, only two MCs showed a statistically significant 
association: patients with SZ had an OR of 2.01 [CI 95% (1.00-4.01)] for CVD 
compared to BD; on the other hand, patients with BD had an OR of 16.57 [CI 95% 
(3.58-76.77)] for gynecological diseases compared to SZ patients. Conclusions: 
MCs are common among people with severe mental illness, especially CVD and 
metabolic diseases, highlighting the need for a more collaborative relationship 
between general medical providers and psychiatrists.

INTRODUCTION: acute bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in 
infants worldwide. However, little is known about the real impact of on society 
in terms of years of life lost due to this condition. The objective of the 
present study is to determine the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for 
acute bronchiolitis in infants in Colombia.
METHODS: data from the national epidemiological surveillance system were used to 
estimate DALYs, calculated from the sum of years of life lost and years lived 
with disability due to acute bronchiolitis in Colombia. A bootstrapped method 
with 10,000 iterations was used to estimate each statistical parameter using the 
package DALYs calculator in R.
RESULTS: in 2019, 447,434 years of life (confidence interval 95% 397,647- 
512,759) were lost due to acute bronchiolitis in Colombian infants. The 
estimated rate was 34 DALYs/1000 person-year (95% confidence interval 30-39).
CONCLUSION: our paper shows the high burden of disease associated with 
bronchiolitis in Colombia. Prevention strategies, such as acute bronchiolitis 
vaccination, to reduce morbidity associated with acute bronchiolitis should be 
encouraged in our country.
