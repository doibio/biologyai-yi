Down syndrome (DS) is characterised by abnormal cognitive and motor development, 
and later in life by progressive Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like dementia, 
neuropathology, declining motor function and shorter life expectancy. It is 
caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (Hsa21), but how individual Hsa21 genes 
contribute to various aspects of the disorder is incompletely understood. 
Previous work has demonstrated a role for triplication of the Hsa21 gene DYRK1A 
in cognitive and motor deficits, as well as in altered neurogenesis and 
neurofibrillary degeneration in the DS brain, but its contribution to other DS 
phenotypes is unclear. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of minibrain 
(mnb), the Drosophila ortholog of DYRK1A, in the Drosophila nervous system 
accelerated age-dependent decline in motor performance and shortened lifespan. 
Overexpression of mnb in the eye was neurotoxic and overexpression in ellipsoid 
body neurons in the brain caused age-dependent neurodegeneration. At the larval 
neuromuscular junction, an established model for mammalian central glutamatergic 
synapses, neuronal mnb overexpression enhanced spontaneous vesicular transmitter 
release. It also slowed recovery from short-term depression of evoked 
transmitter release induced by high-frequency nerve stimulation and increased 
the number of boutons in one of the two glutamatergic motor neurons innervating 
the muscle. These results provide further insight into the roles of DYRK1A 
triplication in abnormal aging and synaptic dysfunction in DS.

AIM: To estimate the lifetime risk of total knee replacement surgery (TKR) 
including unicompartmental knee replacement surgery (UKR) for osteoarthritis 
(OA) in New Zealand, and to identify if lifetime risk is changing over time.
METHOD: Data on primary TKR procedures performed for OA from 2000 to 2015 in New 
Zealand was obtained from the New Zealand joint registry. Life tables and 
population data were sourced from Statistics New Zealand and the Ministry of 
Health of New Zealand. Lifetime risk of TKR was calculated for each year from 
2000 to 2015 using registry population data and life tables.
RESULTS: The overall lifetime risk of TKR in New Zealand increased markedly from 
2000 to 2015, with females having an overall greater lifetime risk increasing 
from 9.4% in 2000 to 16.8% in 2015, a relative increase of 78%. However, males 
showed the greatest increase in risk from 8.1% in 2000 to 16.0% in 2015, a 
relative increase of 97%.
CONCLUSIONS: Current lifetime risk of knee replacement in New Zealand is 
approximately one in six for males and females. This lifetime risk has increased 
significantly from 2000 to 2015. These results can be used to guide public 
health policy planning and division of public health resources.

Administration fund PJ009192.

In South Korea, the culture, production, and consumption of blueberry (Vaccinium 
corymbosum) have increased rapidly over the past 10 years. In June and July 
2012, blueberry plants with leaf spots (~10% of disease incidence) were sampled 
from a blueberry orchard in Jinju, South Korea. Leaf symptoms included small (1 
to 5 mm in diameter) brown spots that were circular to irregular in shape. The 
spots expanded and fused into irregularly shaped, large lesions with distinct 
dark, brownish-red borders. The leaves with severe infection dropped early. A 
fungus was recovered consistently from sections of surface-disinfested (1% 
NaOCl) symptomatic leaf tissue after transfer onto water agar and sub-culture on 
PDA at 25°C. Fungal colonies were dark olive and produced loose, aerial hyphae 
on the culture surfaces. Conidia, which had 3 to 6 transverse septa, 1 to 2 
longitudinal septa, and sometimes also a few oblique septa, were pale brown to 
golden brown, ellipsoid to ovoid, obclavate to obpyriform, and 16 to 42 × 7 to 
16 μm (n = 50). Conidiophores were pale to mid-brown, solitary or fasciculate, 
and 28 to 116 × 3 to 5 μm (n = 50). The species was placed in the Alternaria 
alternata group (1). To confirm the identity of the fungus, the complete 
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA region of a representative isolate, 
AAVC-01, was amplified using ITS1 and ITS4 primers (2). The DNA products were 
cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and the resulting 
pOR13 plasmid was sequenced using universal primers. The resulting 570-bp 
sequence was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KJ636460). Comparison of ITS 
rDNA sequences with other Alternaria spp. using ClustalX showed ≥99% similarity 
with the sequences of A. alternata causing blight on Jatropha curcas (JQ660842) 
from Mexico and Cajannus cajan (JQ074093) from India, citrus black rot 
(AF404664) from South Africa, and other Alternaria species, including A. 
tenuissima (WAC13639) (3), A. lini (Y17071), and A. longipes (AF267137). Two 
base substitutions, C to T at positions 345 and 426, were found in the 570-bp 
amplicon. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the present Alternaria sp. 
infecting blueberry grouped separately from A. tenuissima and A. alternata 
reported from other hosts. A representative isolate of the pathogen was used to 
inoculate V. corymbosum Northland leaves for pathogenicity testing. A conidial 
suspension (2 × 104 conidia/ml) from a single spore culture and 0.025% Tween was 
spot inoculated onto 30 leaves, ranging from recently emerged to oldest, of 
2-year-old V. corymbosum Northland plants. Ten leaves were treated with 
sterilized distilled water and 0.025% Tween as a control. The plants were kept 
in a moist chamber with >90% relative humidity at 25°C for 48 h and then moved 
to a greenhouse. After 15 days, leaf spot symptoms similar to those observed in 
the field developed on the inoculated leaves, whereas the control plants 
remained asymptomatic. The causal fungus was re-isolated from the lesions of the 
inoculated plants to fulfill Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the 
first report of Alternaria sp. on V. corymbosum in South Korea. References: (1)

First Report of Sclerotium Rot Caused by Sclerotium rolfsii on Yacón in South 
Korea.

Yacón, or ground apple (Smallanthus sonchifolius), is a perennial plant grown in 
the northern and central Andes from Colombia to northern Argentina for its 
crisp, sweet, and tuberous roots. In 2012, yacóns cultivated in the research 
field of the Gyeongsangnam-do Agriculture and Extension Services, Jinju, South 
Korea, suddenly died. The characteristic symptoms consisted of rotting, wilting, 
and blighting. Initial symptoms included water-soaked lesions on lower stem 
tissue near the soil line. Infected plants gradually withered, and white 
mycelial mats and sclerotia appeared on the surface of roots and stems at the 
soil line. The sclerotia were collected and disinfested by immersion in 1% 
sodium hypochlorite solution for 30 s and in sterilized distilled water for 1 
min. Then, the sclerotia were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated 
at 30°C. Numerous globoid sclerotia were formed on PDA after 18 days of growth. 
The sclerotia (1 to 3 mm in diameter) were white at first and then gradually 
turned dark brown. Aerial mycelia usually formed many narrow hyphal strands 4 to 
9 μm wide. The white mycelium formed a typical clamp connection after 5 days of 
growth. To fulfill Koch's postulates, 50-day-old healthy seedlings were 
transplanted individually into pots (10 × 10 × 9 cm) containing autoclaved soil. 
After 7 days, five seedlings were inoculated with colonized agar discs (6 mm in 
diameter) directly on the base of the plant, and five yacón seedlings were 
inoculated similarly with PDA discs as the control treatment. The inoculated and 
non-inoculated plants were incubated in a humid growth chamber at 28°C for 24 h 
and then maintained in a greenhouse. Eight days after inoculation, the yacón 
seedlings inoculated with the fungus died, whereas those treated with PDA discs 
were symptomless. The fungus was re-isolated from the artificially inoculated 
plants. To confirm the identity of the causal fungus, the complete internal 
transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA region of the fungus was amplified using the 
primers ITS1 (5'-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3') and ITS4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') 
(2), and the PCR amplicons were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. The 
resulting plasmid (pOR119) was sequenced in both directions with the primers 
M13F and M13R. The resulting 684 bp of ITS rDNA sequence was deposited in 
GenBank (Accession No. KJ944395). A DNA analysis revealed that it was 100% 
identical to Sclerotium rolfsii (HM355751). Cultures of S. rolfsii have been 
deposited with the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection (KACC 47750), National 
Academy of Agricultural Science, Suwon, South Korea. On the basis of symptoms, 
fungal colonies, the ITS sequence, and pathogenicity to the host, this fungus 
was identified as S. rolfsii Saccardo (1). This is the first report of 
sclerotium rot on yacón caused by S. rolfsii in South Korea. References: (1) J.

BACKGROUND: People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of 
developing hyperkalaemia due to their declining kidney function. In addition, 
these patients are often required to reduce or discontinue guideline-recommended 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) therapy due to increased 
risk of hyperkalaemia. This original research developed a model to quantify the 
health and economic benefits of maintaining normokalaemia and enabling optimal 
RAASi therapy in patients with CKD.
METHODS: A patient-level simulation model was designed to fully characterise the 
natural history of CKD over a lifetime horizon, and predict the associations 
between serum potassium levels, RAASi use and long-term outcomes based on 
published literature. The clinical and economic benefits of maintaining 
sustained potassium levels and therefore avoiding RAASi discontinuation in CKD 
patients were demonstrated using illustrative, sensitivity and scenario 
analyses.
RESULTS: Internal and external validation exercises confirmed the predictive 
capability of the model. Sustained potassium management and ongoing RAASi 
therapy were associated with longer life expectancy (+ 2.36 years), delayed 
onset of end stage renal disease (+ 5.4 years), quality-adjusted life-year gains 
(+ 1.02 QALYs), cost savings (£3135) and associated net monetary benefit 
(£23,446 at £20,000 per QALY gained) compared to an absence of RAASi to prevent 
hyperkalaemia.
CONCLUSION: This model represents a novel approach to predicting the long-term 
benefits of maintaining normokalaemia and enabling optimal RAASi therapy in 
patients with CKD, irrespective of the strategy used to achieve this target, 
which may support decision making in healthcare.

BACKGROUND: China has transitioned from being one of the fastest-growing 
populations to among the most rapidly aging countries worldwide. In particular, 
the population of oldest-old individuals, those aged 80+, is projected to 
quadruple by 2050. The oldest-old represent a uniquely important group-they have 
high demand for personal assistance and the highest healthcare costs of any age 
group. Understanding trends in disability and longevity among the 
oldest-old-that is, whether successive generations are living longer and with 
less disability-is of great importance for policy and planning purposes.
METHODS: We utilized data from successive birth cohorts (n = 20,520) of the 
Chinese oldest-old born 10 years apart (the earlier cohort was interviewed in 
1998 and the later cohort in 2008). Disability was defined as needing personal 
assistance in performing one or more of five essential activities (bathing, 
transferring, dressing, eating, and toileting) or being incontinent. 
Participants were followed for age-specific disability transitions and mortality 
(in 2000 and 2002 for the earlier cohort and 2011 and 2014 for the later 
cohort), which were then used to generate microsimulation-based multistate life 
tables to estimate partial life expectancy (LE) and disability-free LE (DFLE), 
stratified by sex and age groups (octogenarians, nonagenarians, and 
centenarians). We additionally explored sociodemographic heterogeneity in LE and 
DFLE by urban/rural residence and educational attainment.
RESULTS: More recently born Chinese octogenarians (born 1919-1928) had a longer 
partial LE between ages 80 and 89 than octogenarians born 1909-1918, and 
octogenarian women experienced an increase in partial DFLE of 0.32 years 
(P = 0.004) across the two birth cohorts. Although no increases in partial LE 
were observed among nonagenarians or centenarians, partial DFLE increased across 
birth cohorts, with a gain of 0.41 years (P < 0.001) among nonagenarians and 
0.07 years (P = 0.050) among centenarians. Subgroup analyses revealed that gains 
in partial LE and DFLE primarily occurred among the urban resident population.
CONCLUSIONS: Successive generations of China's oldest-old are living with less 
disability as a whole, and LE is expanding among octogenarians. However, we 
found a widening urban-rural disparity in longevity and disability, highlighting 
the need to improve policies to alleviate health inequality throughout the 
population.

Regular physical exercice has undeniable cardiovascular benefits and improves 
life expectancy. This benefice seems limited to moderate intensity exercises. 
Intense and chronic physical exercice would lead to heart structural changes. 
For a long time, knowledge of these cardiac effects seemed limited to the left 
ventricle. Since more authors have shown that right ventricle is vulnerability 
to the effects of intense chronic training. We report a Gallavardin-type 
ventricular stress tachycardia in a young with healthy hearted; in whom a right 
infundibular arrhythmogenic focus has been found in the absence of structural 
alteration of the right ventricle. Intense athletic activity may reveal a latent 
arrhythmogenic focus through sympathetic activation. Ablation was the preferred 
therapeutic strategy, preferred to drug therapy and derived from an analysis of 
risk-benefit ratios.

Economic impact of potentially inappropriate prescribing and related adverse 
events in older people: a cost-utility analysis using Markov models.

College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.

Dublin, Ireland.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the economic impact of three drugs commonly involved in 
potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) in adults aged ≥65 years, including 
their adverse effects (AEs): long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs), benzodiazepines and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at maximal 
dose; to assess cost-effectiveness of potential interventions to reduce PIP of 
each drug.
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. We developed Markov models incorporating the AEs 
of each PIP, populated with published estimates of probabilities, health system 
costs (in 2014 euro) and utilities.
PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of 65 year olds analysed over 35 1-year 
cycles with discounting at 5% per year.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios with 95% credible intervals (CIs, 
generated in probabilistic sensitivity analysis) between each PIP and an 
appropriate alternative strategy. Models were then used to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of potential interventions to reduce PIP for each of the 
three drug classes.
RESULTS: All three PIP drugs and their AEs are associated with greater cost and 
fewer QALYs compared with alternatives. The largest reduction in QALYs and 
incremental cost was for benzodiazepines compared with no sedative medication 
(€3470, 95% CI €2434 to €5001; -0.07 QALYs, 95% CI -0.089 to -0.047), followed 
by NSAIDs relative to paracetamol (€806, 95% CI €415 and €1346; -0.07 QALYs, 
95% CI -0.131 to -0.026), and maximal dose PPIs compared with maintenance dose 
PPIs (€989, 95% CI -€69 and €2127; -0.01 QALYs, 95% CI -0.029 to 0.003). For 
interventions to reduce PIP, at a willingness-to-pay of €45 000 per QALY, 
targeting NSAIDs would be cost-effective up to the highest intervention cost per 
person of €1971. For benzodiazepine and PPI interventions, the equivalent cost 
was €1480 and €831, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term benzodiazepine and NSAID prescribing are associated with 
significantly increased costs and reduced QALYs. Targeting inappropriate NSAID 
prescribing appears to be the most cost-effective PIP intervention.

INTRODUCTION: While a large body of literature suggests that tobacco control 
legislation-including fiscal measures such as excise taxes-effectively reduces 
tobacco smoking, the long-run (10+ years) relationship between cigarettes excise 
taxes and life expectancy has not been directly evaluated. Here, we test the 
hypothesis that increases in state cigarette excise taxes are positively 
associated with long-run increases in population-level life expectancy.
METHODS: We studied age-standardised life expectancy among all US counties from 
1996 to 2012 by sex, in relation to state cigarette excise tax rates by year, 
controlling for other demographic, socioeconomic and county-specific features. 
We used an error-correction model to assess the long-run relationship between 
taxes and life expectancy. We additionally examine whether the relationship 
between cigarette taxes and life expectancy was mediated by changes to county 
smoking prevalence and varied by the sex, income and rural/urban composition of 
a county.
RESULTS: For every one-dollar increase in cigarette tax per pack (in 2016 
dollars), county life expectancy increased by 1 year (95% CI 0.60 to 1.40 years) 
over the long run, with the first 6-month increase in life expectancy taking 10 
years to materialise. The association was mediated by changes in smoking 
prevalence and the magnitude of the association steadily increased as county 
income decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that increasing cigarette excise tax rates 
translates to consequential population-level improvements in life expectancy, 
with larger effects in low-income counties.

The benzothiazepine CGP37157 has shown neuroprotective effects in several in 
vitro models of excitotoxicity involving dysregulation of intracellular Ca2+ 
homeostasis. Although its mechanism of neuroprotection is unclear, it is 
probably related with some of its effects on Ca2+ homeostasis. CGP37157 is a 
well-known inhibitor of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (mNCX). However, it 
is not very specific and also blocks several other Ca2+ channels and 
transporters, including voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ 
exchanger and the Ca2+ homeostasis modulator 1 channel (CALHM1). In the present 
work, we have studied if CGP37157 could also induce changes in life expectancy. 
We now report that CGP37157 extends C. elegans lifespan by 10%-15% with a 
bell-shaped concentration-response, with high concentrations producing no 
effect. The effect was even larger (25% increase in life expectancy) in worms 
fed with heat-inactivated bacteria. The worm CGP37157 concentration producing 
maximum effect was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem 
mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and was close to the IC50 for inhibition of the 
Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. CGP37157 also extended the lifespan in eat-2 mutants (a 
model for caloric restriction), suggesting that caloric restriction is not 
involved in the mechanism of lifespan extension. Actually, CGP37157 produced no 
effect in mutants of the TOR pathway (daf15/unc24) or the insulin/insulin-like 
growth factor-1 (IGF-1) pathway (daf-2), indicating that the effect involves 
these pathways. Moreover, CGP37157 was also ineffective in nuo-6 mutants, which 
have a defect in the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. Since it has 
been described that neuroprotection by this compound in cell cultures is 
abolished by mitochondrial inhibitors, this suggests that life extension in C. 
elegans and neuroprotection in cell cultures may share a similar mechanism 
involving mitochondria.

INTRODUCTION: Few patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) achieve 
recommended glycemic control targets in the Czech Republic. Novel therapies, 
such as fixed-ratio combinations of basal insulin plus glucagon-like peptide-1 
receptor agonists, may contribute to better glycemic control. In the analysis 
presented here, the present analysis assessed the long-term cost-effectiveness 
of two fixed-ratio combinations, IDegLira (insulin degludec/liraglutide) and 
iGlarLixi (insulin glargine/lixisenatide), for the treatment of patients with 
T2DM inadequately controlled with basal insulin from a healthcare payer 
perspective in the Czech Republic.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed over patient lifetimes 
using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Treatment effects were obtained from an 
indirect treatment comparison as no head-to-head data for IDegLira versus 
iGlarLixi are currently available. IDegLira was compared with two iGlarLixi pens 
(100 U/mL insulin glargine + 33 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL of lixisenatide, 
respectively). Direct medical costs associated with pharmaceutical 
interventions, screening and diabetes-related complications were captured. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with gains in life expectancy of 0.11 years and 
in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.14 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
versus iGlarLixi, due to a lower cumulative incidence and delayed onset of 
diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was also associated with higher 
projected costs due to higher acquisition costs; however, these were partially 
offset by cost savings from avoided complications. IDegLira was associated with 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of Czech Koruna (CZK) 695,998 and 
CZK 348,323 per QALY gained versus iGlarLixi pens containing 33 and 50 μg/mL of 
lixisenatide, respectively. These ratios were below the commonly used 
willingness-to-pay threshold of CZK 1,200,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: The present analysis indicated that IDegLira was associated with 
clinical benefits relative to iGlarLixi over patient lifetimes and was likely to 
be cost-effective in the treatment of patients with T2DM uncontrolled on basal 
insulin in the Czech Republic.

Ovalbumin is considered a protein of high nutritional value because it contains 
essential amino acids and is highly digestible. Therefore, it has a high 
biological value. Currently, the high food demand requires worldwide attention 
because food production is insufficient. Therefore, other alternatives are 
necessary to satisfy food demands, such as protein engineering. In this work, a 
protein with a high essential amino acid content similar to ovalbumin was 
synthesized by protein engineering, expressed, and digested in vitro. The 
assembly and sequential overlap extension PCR strategy was used to synthesize a 
345-bp gene that encodes a high essential amino acid content protein (HEAAP). 
The 345-bp product was cloned into the vector pBAD TOPO®, and expressed in 
Escherichia coli BL21. PCR reactions and sequencing demonstrated the presence, 
orientation, and correct sequence of the insert. HEAAP expression was induced by 
L-arabinose and then purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The 
expression in E. coli was low and barely detected by Western blot assay. The in 
vitro multienzyme digestibility of HEAAP was around 79%, which suggests that the 
protein is potentially nutritious. Virtual analysis classifies the protein as 
unstable and hydrophilic, with a half-life in E. coli of 10 h. The recombinant 
HEAAP was successfully synthesized, but it is necessary to improve the 
digestibility and to optimize expression including selecting other expression 
models.

United States Life Tables, 2015.

Arias E, Xu J.

Objectives-This report presents complete period life tables for the United 
States by race, Hispanic origin, and sex, based on agespecific death rates in 
2015. Methods-Data used to prepare the 2015 life tables are 2015 final mortality 
statistics; July 1, 2015, population estimates based on the 2010 decennial 
census; and 2015 Medicare data for persons aged 66-99. The methodology used to 
estimate the life tables for the Hispanic population remains unchanged from that 
developed for the publication of life tables by Hispanic origin for data year 
2006. The methodology used to estimate the 2015 life tables for all other groups 
was first implemented with data year 2008. Results-In 2015, the overall 
expectation of life at birth was 78.7 years, decreasing by 0.2 year from 2014. 
From 2014 to 2015, life expectancy at birth decreased by 0.2 year for both males 
(76.5 to 76.3) and females (81.3 to 81.1). Life expectancy at birth decreased by 
0.2 year for the white population (79.1 to 78.9) and by 0.1 year for the black 
population (75.6 to 75.5). Life expectancy at birth decreased by 0.2 year for 
the Hispanic population (82.1 to 81.9) and for the non-Hispanic black population 
(75.3 to 75.1). Life expectancy at birth decreased by 0.1 year for the 
non-Hispanic white population (78.8 to 78.7).

BACKGROUND:  Intracranial teratomas are rare tumors that usually present during 
the second decade of life. Among intracranial teratomas, suprasellar germ cell 
tumors in particular are extremely rare. We present the case of an 18-year-old 
girl who underwent a successful endoscopic transnasal resection of a suprasellar 
teratoma with a mixed germ cell component.
CASE DESCRIPTION:  An 18-year-old girl presented with progressive visual 
disturbance, headache, weight loss, and fatigue for 2 weeks. She had decreased 
vision in her right eye and double vision when looking to the right side. On 
examination, she had right-side complete abducens nerve palsy and partial 
oculomotor nerve palsy bilaterally. Brain imaging revealed a large suprasellar 
lesion consistent with a germ cell tumor. The patient underwent a transnasal 
endoscopic resection of the lesion. Pathology showed a mixed germ cell tumor 
(80% mature cystic teratoma, 18% yolk sac tumor, and 2% germinoma). The mature 
teratomatous elements identified included skin with sebaceous material, hair, 
cartilage, acini, colonic mucosa, muscle, nerve bundles, and adipose tissue. 
Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed residual tumor in the left 
cavernous sinus and anterior clinoid process superiorly. At a 1-year follow-up, 
the double vision had resolved, and her vision showed progressive improvement. 
The patient was maintained on treatment for diabetes insipidus, hypothyroidism, 
and adrenal insufficiency. Her last MRI showed no signs of tumor progression.
CONCLUSIONS:  The present case demonstrates a safe endoscopic transnasal 
surgical resection of a rare suprasellar tumor, mixed teratoma, with intra-axial 
extension. The endoscopic transnasal approach can be considered a valid option 
for a suprasellar lesion.

Environmental exposures during pregnancy: Mechanistic effects on immunity.

University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland.

In human studies, it is well established that exposures during embryonic and 
fetal development periods can influence immune health. Coupled with genetic 
predisposition, these exposures can alter lifetime chronic and infectious 
disease trajectory, and, ultimately, life expectancy. Fortunately, as research 
advances, mechanisms governing long-term effects of prenatal exposures are 
coming to light and providing the opportunity for intervention and risk 
reduction. For instance, human association studies have provided a foundation 
for the association of prenatal exposure to particulate matter with early 
immunosuppression and later allergic disease in the offspring. Only recently, 
the mechanisms mediating this response have been revealed and there is much we 
have yet to discover. Although cellular immune response is understood for many 
exposure scenarios, molecular pathways are still unidentified. This review will 
provide commentary and synthesis of the current literature regarding 
environmental exposures during pregnancy and mechanisms determining immune 
outcomes. Shared mechanistic features and current gaps in the state of the 
science are identified and discussed. To such purpose, we address exposures by 
their immune effect type: immunosuppression, autoimmunity, inflammation and 
tissue damage, hypersensitivity, and general immunomodulation.

Valdensia leaf blight on blueberry in Poland was reported in one commercial 
nursery plantation near Prażmów, Mazovia voivodship, where heavy defoliation was 
observed on cv. Bluecrop, grown in nursery pots, in August 2011. Older fruiting 
bushes were only slightly affected by the disease. Initial symptoms of the 
disease were small, oval to circular zonated necrosis surrounded with dark brown 
borders that enlarged on the leaves throughout the canopy. Multicellular, 
hyaline or light brown, star-shaped conidiospores were observed on the necrotic 
areas. The mean length of 50 conidiospores from the end of head to the end of 
arm apex was 307 to 348 μm (4). Eight single-spore isolates of the fungus were 
obtained. Single conidiospores were picked up from necrotic spots on leaves and 
transferred with sterile needle on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 
20°C under ambient light. After 10 days of incubation, total DNA was extracted. 
Amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was done 
using primers ITS1F and ITS4A (1). PCRs were carried out as follows: initial 
denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 
57°C for 1 min, extension at 72°C for 1 min, and final extension at 72°C for 5 
min for 28 cycles (Applied Biosystems Veriti 96 Wel Thermal Cycler). Amplicons, 
which were approximately 520 bp, were sequenced and nucleotide sequences were 
analyzed by Clustal W2EBI. The sequences of all eight isolates showed 100% 
similarity to each other and were compared with sequences stored in GenBank 
using BLAST. Sequences were 525 bp long and showed 100% homology to Valdensinia 
heterodoxa Peyronel, Sclerotiniaceae (anamorph: Valdensia heterodoxa Peyronel) 
from Japan and Norway (Accession Nos. AB663682 and Z81447, respectively) (3). 
The sequence from one isolate was submitted to GenBank (Accession No. KF212190). 
To fulfill Koch's postulates, each of the eight isolates was used to inoculate 
20 healthy young leaves of Vaccinium corymbosum L. cv. Bluecrop and bilberry (V. 
myrtillus L.) (10 leaves per plant). Mycelial plugs 5 mm in diameter were taken 
from PDA cultures, approximately 20 days old, and used as inoculum and placed in 
the center of each leaf and moistened with sterile distilled water. 
Mycelium-free plugs were used as control. Inoculated leaves were placed in 
plastic box and incubated at 20°C in laboratory for 5 days, at which time small 
necrotic lesions consistent with initial symptoms of the disease were observed. 
Isolates obtained from these symptoms were morphologically identical to those 
used for inoculation. Control leaves did not show any disease symptoms. 
Valdensia leaf blight occurrence may be attributed to rainy July and August 2011 
and long presence of water on soil surface. In Poland, Valdensinia heterodoxa 
causes heavy defoliation of Vaccinium myrtillus in pine stands and is a common 
pathogen of some herbaceous plants (2). To our knowledge, this is the first 
report of Valdensia leaf blight on highbush blueberry in Poland. References: (1)

The regenerative medicine, a new discipline that merges biological sciences and 
the fundamental of engineering to develop biological substitutes, has greatly 
benefited from recent advances in the material engineering and the role of stem 
cells in tissue regeneration. Regenerative medicine strategies, involving the 
combination of biomaterials/scaffolds, cells, and bioactive agents, have been of 
great interest especially for the repair of damaged bone and bone regrowth. In 
the last few years, the life expectancy of our population has progressively 
increased. Aging has highlighted the need for intervention on human bone with 
biocompatible materials that show high performance for the regeneration of the 
bone, efficiently and in a short time. In this review, the different aspects of 
tissue engineering applied to bone engineering were taken into consideration. 
The first part of this review introduces the bone cellular biology/molecular 
genetics. Data on biomaterials, stem cells, and specific growth factors for the 
bone regrowth are reported in this review.

BACKGROUND: Financial constraints, social taboos and beliefs in alternative 
medicine are common reasons for delaying or not considering treatment for 
hepatitis C in India. The present study was planned to analyze the impact of 
non-banking interest free loan facility in patients affected with hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) in North India.
METHODS: This one year observational, retrospective study was conducted in 
Department of Gastroenterology (January 2012-December 2013), Dayanand Medical 
College and Hospital Ludhiana, to evaluate the impact of program titled 
"Sambhav" (which provided non-banking financial assistance and counselor 
services) on treatment initiation and therapeutic compliance in HCV patients. 
Data of fully evaluated patients with chronic hepatitis, and/or cirrhosis due to 
HCV infection who were treated with Peginterferon alfa and ribavirin (RBV) 
combination during this duration (2012-2013) was collected from patient medical 
records and analyzed. In the year 2012, eligible patients who were offered 
antiviral treatment paid for treatment themselves, while in 2013, 'Sambhav' 
program was launched and this provided interest free financing by non-banking 
financial company (NBFC) for the treatment of HCV in addition to free counselor 
services for disease management. The treatment initiation and compliance rates 
were compared between the patients (n = 585) enrolled in 2013 who were offered 
'Sambhav' assistance and those enrolled in 2012 (n = 628) when 'Sambhav' was not 
available.
RESULTS: Introduction of Sambhav program improved the rates of treatment 
initiation (59% in 2013 vs. 51% in 2012, P=.004). Of the 585 eligible patients 
offered 'Sambhav' assistance in 2013, 233 patients (39.8%) applied but 106/233 
(45.4%) received assistance. Antiviral therapy was started in 93/106 (87.7%) of 
these patients, while only 52 (42.5%) of 127 patients whose applications were 
rejected underwent treatment. Compliance to antiviral therapy also improved with 
the introduction of 'Sambhav' program (87.7% vs. 74.1%, P=.001).
CONCLUSION: 'Sambhav' program had significant impact on the initiation of 
antiviral therapy by overcoming the financial hurdles. The free counselor 
services helped to mitigate social taboos and imparted adequate awareness about 
the disease to the patients. Initiatives like 'Sambhav' can be utilized for 
improving healthcare services in developing countries, especially for chronic 
diseases.
