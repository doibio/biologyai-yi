large-scale randomized trial in 2011-2012 that provided 30% rebate on targeted 
fruits and vegetables to 7500 study participants enrolled in the SNAP, we 
constructed a decision model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an expansion 
of the HIP to all SNAP households nationwide. The estimated life-time per capita 
costs of the HIP to the Federal government is $1323 in 2012 U.S. dollars, and 
the average gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy to a SNAP participant is 
0.082 quality-adjusted life year (QALY), resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $16,172 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis 
using Monte Carlo simulations indicates a 94.4% and 99.6% probability that the 
estimated ICER would be lower than the cost-effective threshold of $50,000 and 
$100,000 per QALY gained, respectively. Moreover, the estimated ICER of the HIP 
expansion tends to be competitive in comparison to other interventions that 
aimed at promoting fruit/vegetable intake among adult population. Findings from 
this study suggest that a nationwide expansion of the HIP is likely to nudge 
SNAP households towards purchasing and consuming more targeted fruits and 
vegetables. However, diet behavior modification is proportional to price change. 
When people's actual eating behaviors and what dietary guidelines recommend 
differ by several folds, even a 30% rebate closes just a small fraction of that 
gap and has limited beneficial impact on participants' weight management, 
disease prevention, and health-related quality of life.

Abdominal emergency in an advanced oncologic setting is defined as an acute 
life-threatening abdominal pathology in a patient with incurable cancer. These 
include bowel obstruction, infections and, more rarely, hemorrhage. To benefit 
the patient, surgery should both increase the survival and improve the quality 
of life. These two goals are of equal importance and must be achieved together. 
This is difficult because these patients are frail, often malnourished and have 
a poor performance status. They also have a high risk of post-operative 
morbidity and mortality, a major risk of symptom recurrence and a limited life 
expectancy. For patients near the end-of-life, a therapeutic decision for 
surgical intervention must respect ethical and legal standards. This review 
reports the surgical outcomes and median survival of these patients, specifies 
rules that must be known and respected, and presents non-operative 
interventional alternatives.

BACKGROUND: Surgery for elderly patients with acute subdural hematomas (ASDH) is 
controversial, because postoperative mortality rates are reported to be high and 
long-term outcomes unknown. Thus, we aimed to describe midterm and long-term 
mortality rates of elderly patients operated for an ASDH.
METHODS: We reviewed all consecutive ≥75-year-old patients operated on for an 
ASDH between 2009 and 2012. We recorded data on preadmission functional status 
(independent or dependent) and use of antithrombotic medication. Patients were 
followed up a median of 4.2 years (range, 2.5-6.4 years).
RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included. The majority of the patients (70%) 
were independent and taking antithrombotic medication (77%). Independent 
patients had a 1-year mortality of 42%, compared to 69% for dependent patients; 
56% of patients taking antithrombotics and 30% of those without antithrombotics 
died within the first postoperative year. All patients with an admission Glasgow 
coma scale score of 3-8 died within the first postoperative year, if they used 
antithrombotics or were dependent before the injury. Of all 1-year survivors, 
77% were alive at the end of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: In this first surgical case series of 75-year-old or older patients 
with ASDH, the overall mortality rate appears to be relatively low, especially 
for preoperatively conscious and independent patients without antithrombotic 
medication. Patients alive at 1-year after surgery had a life expectancy 
comparable to their age-matched peers. The prognosis seems to be detrimental for 
preoperatively unconscious patients who were functionally dependent or used 
antithrombotic medication before the injury.

BACKGROUND: Although prolactinomas are treated effectively with dopamine 
agonists, some have proposed curative surgical resection for select cases of 
microprolactinomas to avoid life-long medical therapy. We performed a 
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing transsphenoidal surgery (either 
microsurgical or endoscopic) and medical therapy (either bromocriptine or 
cabergoline) with decision analysis modeling.
METHODS: A 2-armed decision tree was created with TreeAge Pro Suite 2012 to 
compare upfront transsphenoidal surgery versus medical therapy. The economic 
perspective was that of the health care third-party payer. On the basis of a 
literature review, we assigned plausible distributions for costs and utilities 
to each potential outcome, taking into account medical and surgical costs and 
complications. Base-case analysis, sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo 
simulations were performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of each strategy 
at 5-year and 10-year time horizons.
RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, microscopic transsphenoidal surgery was the 
most cost-effective option at 5 years from the time of diagnosis; however, by 
the 10-year time horizon, endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery became the most 
cost-effective option. At both time horizons, medical therapy (both 
bromocriptine and cabergoline) were found to be more costly and less effective 
than transsphenoidal surgery (i.e., the medical arm was dominated by the 
surgical arm in this model). Two-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that 
endoscopic resection would be the most cost-effective strategy if the cure rate 
from endoscopic surgery was greater than 90% and the complication rate was less 
than 1%. Monte Carlo simulation was performed for endoscopic surgery versus 
microscopic surgery at both time horizons. This analysis produced an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $80,235 per quality-adjusted life years at 5 years 
and $40,737 per quality-adjusted life years at 10 years, implying that with 
increasing time intervals, endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery is the more 
cost-effective treatment strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the results of our model, transsphenoidal surgical 
resection of microprolactinomas, either microsurgical or endoscopic, appears to 
be more cost-effective than life-long medical therapy in young patients with 
life expectancy greater than 10 years. We caution that surgical resection for 
microprolactinomas be performed only in select cases by experienced pituitary 
surgeons at high-volume centers with high biochemical cure rates and low 
complication rates.

Cancers of esophagus and stomach are common malignant diseases worldwide, and 
they are associated with serious morbidity and high mortality rates. When 
diagnosed at an early stage, gastro-esophageal cancers are potentially curable. 
Neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapies using both chemotherapy and radiation therapy 
have been shown to reduce the risk of local recurrence and distant metastasis. 
For advanced or metastatic tumors, systemic chemotherapy offers symptomatic 
palliation and moderate benefits in survival. With recent advances in 
anti-cancer therapeutics, progress has been made to improve treatment response 
and life expectancy in patients with advanced gastro-esophageal cancers. 
Furthermore, the clinical use of molecularly targeted agents in combination with 
cytotoxic chemotherapeutics is being evaluated in a number of ongoing clinical 
trials. In this article, we review currently used standard systemic therapies 
including recently evolving targeted therapies for metastatic gastro-esophageal 
cancers, as well as the proven role and the regimens that are used as 
neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment in localized gastro-esophageal cancers.

Hemodialysis catheters are vital for chronic renal failure patients. Permanent 
tunneled dialysis catheters may be inserted through the jugular, subclavian, and 
femoral veins. In this paper, we aimed to present the computed tomography 
findings of a chronic renal failure patient who had referred our clinic with 
abdominal pain and dyspnea symptoms. This patient had a formerly inserted 
hemodialysis catheter for chronic renal failure and her catheter was found to be 
extending towards the middle hepatic vein with the tip leaning onto the 
parenchyma. Hemodialysis catheters can provide instant vascular access and can 
also be used for the consecutive procedures. Permanent hemodialysis catheters 
are ideal for long-term use when placing an arteriovenous fistula is 
contraindicated or is no longer possible under conditions like advanced heart 
failure, peripheral artery disease or short life expectancy. The internal 
jugular, subclavian, the femoral veins, and the inferior vena cava can be used 
for catheter insertion. The tip of the catheters inserted in the neck or the 
thorax must extend to the vena cava superior. Catheter malposition may both lead 
to fatal outcomes and ineffective dialysis. It is important to obtain chest 
X-rays after the procedure, particularly to detect catheter malposition.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive programme 
for drug-resistant tuberculosis launched in four sites in China in 2011.
METHODS: In 2011-2012, we reviewed the records of 172 patients with 
drug-resistant tuberculosis who enrolled in the comprehensive programme and we 
collected relevant administrative data from hospitals and China's public health 
agency. For comparison, we examined a cohort of 81 patients who were treated for 
drug-resistant tuberculosis in 2006-2009. We performed a cost-effectiveness 
analysis, from a societal perspective, that included probabilistic uncertainty. 
We measured early treatment outcomes based on three-month culture results and 
modelled longer-term outcomes to facilitate estimation of the comprehensive 
programme's cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted.
FINDINGS: The comprehensive programme cost 8837 United States dollars (US$) per 
patient treated. Low enrolment rates meant that some fixed costs were higher, 
per patient, than expected. Although the comprehensive programme appeared 30 
times more costly than the previous one, it resulted in greater health benefits. 
The comprehensive programme, which cost US$ 639 (95% credible interval: 112 to 
1322) per DALY averted, satisfied the World Health Organization's criterion for 
a very cost-effective intervention.
CONCLUSION: The comprehensive programme, which included rapid screening, 
standardized care and financial protection, improved individual outcomes for MDR 
tuberculosis in a cost-effective manner. To support post-2015 global heath 
targets, the comprehensive programme should be expanded to non-residents and 
other areas of China.

Publisher: OBJECTIF: Étudier le rapport coût-efficacité d'un programme global de 
lutte contre la tuberculose pharmacorésistante lancé en 2011 dans quatre régions 
chinoises.
MÉTHODES: En 2011-2012, nous avons analysé les dossiers de 172 patients atteints 
de tuberculose pharmacorésistante qui s'étaient inscrits à ce programme global 
et nous avons collecté des données administratives pertinentes auprès de 
différents hôpitaux et de l'agence de santé publique chinoise. À titre de 
comparaison, nous avons examiné une cohorte de 81 patients soignés pour une 
tuberculose pharmacorésistante entre 2006 et 2009. Nous avons réalisé une 
analyse coût-efficacité, sur le plan sociétal, qui incluait une incertitude 
probabiliste. Nous avons mesuré les résultats du traitement précoce en fonction 
de résultats de culture sur trois mois et modélisé les résultats à long terme 
pour faciliter l'estimation du coût du programme global par année de vie 
corrigée du facteur incapacité (AVCI) évitée.
RÉSULTATS: Le programme global coûte 8837 dollars des États-Unis (US$) par 
patient soigné. Le faible taux d'inscription signifiait que certains coûts fixes 
par patient étaient plus importants que prévu. Bien que ce programme global se 
soit révélé 30 fois plus cher que le précédent, il a débouché sur des avantages 
accrus en matière de santé. Le programme global, qui coûte 639 US$ (intervalle 
de crédibilité à 95 %: 112 à 1322) par AVCI évitée, satisfait au critère de 
l'Organisation mondiale de la Santé définissant une intervention très rentable.
CONCLUSION: Le programme global, qui incluait un dépistage rapide, des soins 
standardisés et une protection financière, a amélioré les résultats des patients 
atteints de tuberculose multirésistante en limitant les dépenses. Afin de 
soutenir les objectifs mondiaux pour l'après-2015 en matière de santé, le 
programme global devrait être élargi aux non-résidents et à d'autres régions de 
Chine.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Investigar la costoeficacia de un programa integral para la 
tuberculosis farmacorresistente lanzado en cuatro localizaciones de China en 
2011.
MÉTODOS: En 2011–2012, se revisaron los informes de 172 pacientes con 
tuberculosis farmacorresistente que se habían inscrito en el programa integral y 
se recogieron datos administrativos relevantes de hospitales y la agencia de 
salud pública de China. Como término de comparación, se examinó un cohorte de 81 
pacientes que habían sido tratados para la tuberculosis farmacorresistente en 
2006−2009. Se llevó a cabo un análisis de costoeficacia desde una perspectiva 
societaria que incluía la incertidumbre probabilística. Se midieron los 
resultados de los tratamientos tempranos basados en los resultados de un cultivo 
de tres meses y se modelaron resultados a largo plazo para facilitar la 
estimación del coste del programa integral de años de vida en función de la 
discapacidad (AVAD) evitada.
RESULTADOS: El programa integral costó 8.837 dólares estadounidenses (USD) por 
paciente tratado. Las bajas tasas de inscripción significaban que algunos de los 
costes fijos eran mayores por paciente que lo esperado. A pesar de que el 
programa integral parecía 30 veces más costoso que el anterior, tuvo como 
resultado unos mejores beneficios para la salud. El programa integral, que costó 
639 USD (intervalo de credibilidad del 95%: de 112 a 1.322) por AVAD evitado, 
satisfizo el criterio de la Organización Mundial de la Salud en cuanto a 
intervenciones muy costoefectivas.
CONCLUSIÓN: El programa integral, que incluía un examen rápido, cuidados 
estándar y protección financiera, mejoró los resultados individuales de la 
tuberculosis multirresistente (MR) de una manera costoefectiva. Para apoyar los 
objetivos de salud globales posteriores a 2015, el programa integral debería 
expandirse a no residentes y otras áreas de China.

Publisher: الغرض: استقصاء مدى فعالية تكلفة البرنامج الشامل للتصدي لمرض السل 
المقاوم للأدوية الذي بدأ العمل به في أربعة مواقع في الصين في عام 2011.
الطريقة: راجعنا سجلات 172 مريضًا يعانون من السل المقاوم للأدوية ممن تم تسجيلهم 
في البرنامج الشامل، وجمعنا البيانات الإدارية ذات الصلة من المستشفيات ووكالة 
الصحة العامة بالصين، وذلك في الفترة من 2011 إلى 2012. وفحصنا مجموعة تتكون من 
81 مريضًا ممن تلقوا العلاج من السل المقاوم للأدوية في الفترة بين 2006 و2009 بغرض 
المقارنة. وأجرينا تحليلًا لمدى فعالية التكلفة من الناحية المجتمعية، حيث انطوى 
التحليل على احتمالات عدم التيقن من النتائج. وأجرينا قياسًا للنتائج الأولية 
للعلاج اعتمادًا على نتائج عملية المستنبتات التي استمرت لمدة 3 أشهر، واستخدمنا 
النتائج التي ظهرت على مدى أطول كنموذج لتيسير تقدير تكلفة البرنامج الشامل 
باستخدام سنوات العمر المصححة باحتساب مدد العجز (DALY) التي تم تفاديها.
النتائج: بلغت تكلفة البرنامج الشامل 8837 دولارًا أمريكيًا للمريض الواحد الذي 
تلقى العلاج. وكانت المعدلات المنخفضة للتسجيل بالبرنامج تعني ارتفاعًا في بعض 
التكاليف الثابتة لكل مريض عن الحد المتوقع. وبالرغم من أن تكلفة البرنامج الشامل 
بدت أكثر ارتفاعًا بثلاثين ضعفًا مقارنةً بما سبق، فإنه أثمر عن نتائج أكثر جدوى من 
الناحية الصحية. إن البرنامج الشامل الذي تكلف 639 دولارًا أمريكيًا (بنسبة ثقة 
مقدارها 95%‏‏: من 112 إلى 1322 حالة) باستخدام سنوات العمر المصححة باحتساب مدد 
العجز التي تم تفاديها، قد اتفق مع معايير منظمة الصحة العالمية باعتباره تدخلاً 
فعالًا من حيث التكلفة إلى حد كبير.
الاستنتاج: إن البرنامج الشامل، الذي اشتمل على الفحص السريع، والرعاية الصحية 
المتوافقة مع المعايير، والحماية المالية قد حسَّن من مستوى نتائج علاج السل 
المقاوم للأدوية المتعددة على المستوى الفردي بأسلوب فعال من حيث التكلفة. ويجب 
توسيع نطاق البرنامج الشامل ليضم غير المقيمين بالدولة ومناطق أخرى في الصين، وذلك 
لدعم الأهداف العالمية المنشودة لما بعد 2015 في مجال الصحة.

Publisher: 目的: 旨在调查 2011 年在中国四个地点实施的耐药结核病综合方案的成本效益。.
方法: 
在 2011 至 2012 年，我们查阅了 172 位接受该综合方案的耐药结核病患者的记录，并且从各家医院和中国的公共卫生机构收集了相关管理性数据。为了进行对比，我们调查了一组曾在 2006 年至 2009 年接受过耐药结核病治疗的 81 位患者。我们从社会视角对成本效益进行分析，其中包括概率不定性。我们在为期三个月的培养结果的基础上评估了早期治疗结果，并且以更长期的结果建模，以便于估计该综合方案每个伤残调整生命年 (DALY) 挽救生命的成本。.
结果: 
接受该综合方案的每位患者的治疗花费为 8837 美元 (US$) 。低接受率意味着每位患者的一些固定费用比预期的更高。尽管该综合方案的费用比之前的高 30 倍，但是它有更高的健康效益。该综合方案的每个伤残调整生命年挽救生命花费 639 美元（95% 置信区间：112 至 1322），符合世界卫生组织规定的一项极具成本效益的干预措施的标准。.
结论: 
这套包含了快速筛查、标准化护理和财务保障的综合方案以具有成本效益的方式，改善了多药耐药结核病患者的个人治疗成果。为了实现 2015 年后的全球健康目标，该综合方案的普及范围应扩大至非本地居民和中国的其他地区。.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ: Изучить экономическую эффективность комплексной программы по 
борьбе с лекарственно-устойчивым туберкулезом, запущенной в четырех китайских 
городах в 2011 г.
МЕТОДЫ: В 2011–2012 гг. мы изучили медицинские карточки 172 пациентов, 
страдавших лекарственно-устойчивой формой туберкулеза и принявших участие в 
комплексной программе, и собрали соответствующие административные данные из 
больниц и агентства общественного здравоохранения Китая. Для сравнения 
рассматривалась когорта из 81 пациента, прошедшего лечение от 
лекарственно-устойчивой формы туберкулеза в период 2006–2009 гг. Нами был 
проделан анализ экономической эффективности с точки зрения социологии, который 
включал вероятностную неопределенность. Нами были измерены ранние результаты 
лечения (по данным культур, высеянных после трех месяцев лечения) и 
смоделированы исходы в более длительной перспективе, что позволило оценить 
выраженные в расчете на год жизни затраты на комплексную программу по 
утраченному времени в результате инвалидности (DALY), потерю которого удалось 
предотвратить.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Стоимость комплексной программы составила 8837 долларов США из 
расчета на одного пациента. Малое число участников программы означало, что 
некоторые фиксированные затраты из расчета на пациента были выше, чем ожидалось. 
Хотя данная комплексная программа оказалась в 30 раз дороже, чем предыдущая, ее 
результаты с точки зрения пользы для здоровья пациентов оказались лучше. 
Комплексная программа стоимостью 639 долларов США (95% доверительный интервал, 
диапазон от 112 до 1322 долларов США) из расчета на предотвращенный DALY 
удовлетворяет критериям Всемирной организации здравоохранения для экономически 
эффективного вмешательства.
ВЫВОД: Комплексная программа, включавшая быстрое скрининговое обследование, 
стандартизированное лечение и финансовую защиту, улучшила результат лечения у 
больных с МЛУ-формой туберкулеза и показала высокую экономическую эффективность. 
Чтобы достичь глобальных целей в сфере здравоохранения на период после 
2015 года, данную комплексную программу следует распространить на нерезидентов 
страны и на другие регионы Китая.

BACKGROUND: Usually the training set of online brain-computer interface (BCI) 
experiment is small. For the small training set, it lacks enough information to 
deeply train the classifier, resulting in the poor classification performance 
during online testing.
METHODS: In this paper, on the basis of Z-LDA, we further calculate the 
classification probability of Z-LDA and then use it to select the reliable 
samples from the testing set to enlarge the training set, aiming to mine the 
additional information from testing set to adjust the biased classification 
boundary obtained from the small training set. The proposed approach is an 
extension of previous Z-LDA and is named enhanced Z-LDA (EZ-LDA).
RESULTS: We evaluated the classification performance of LDA, Z-LDA, and EZ-LDA 
on simulation and real BCI datasets with different sizes of training samples, 
and classification results showed EZ-LDA achieved the best classification 
performance.
CONCLUSIONS: EZ-LDA is promising to deal with the small sample size training 
problem usually existing in online BCI system.

As worldwide life expectancy rises, the number of candidates for surgical 
treatment of gastric carcinoma over 70 years will increase. This study aims to 
examine outcomes after gastric carcinoma in elderly patients. This study is a 
retrospective review of 697 patients undergoing gastrectomy with radical intent 
for gastric carcinoma during January 2007 to January 2013. A total of 534 
patients were less than 70 years old (group A), and 163 patients 70 years or 
greater (group B). We analyzed the effect of age on short and long-term 
variables including overall survival and disease-free survival. Major morbidity 
was observed to occur in 19 patients of group A, and 15 of group B. Mortality, 
both 30-day and 90-day was observed in 1 and 3 of group A, and 3 and 6 of group 
B. Five-year overall survival and disease-free survival was 61% and 60% for 
group A, 50% and 43% for group B respectively. Gastrectomy should be carefully 
considered in patients 70 years old and can be justified with low mortality and 
acceptable long-term outcomes.

A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Low-Dose Aspirin Prophylaxis for the Prevention of 
Preeclampsia in the United States.

University, Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island, and the Department of 
Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Brown University, Providence, Rhode 
Island.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a decision model to evaluate the risks, benefits, and 
costs of different approaches to aspirin prophylaxis for the approximately 4 
million pregnant women in the United States annually.
METHODS: We created a decision model to evaluate four approaches to aspirin 
prophylaxis in the United States: no prophylaxis, prophylaxis per American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (the College) recommendations, 
prophylaxis per U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, and 
universal prophylaxis. We included the costs associated with aspirin, 
preeclampsia, preterm birth, and potential aspirin-associated adverse effects. 
TreeAge Pro 2011 was used to perform the analysis.
RESULTS: The estimated rate of preeclampsia would be 4.18% without prophylaxis 
compared with 4.17% with the College approach in which 0.35% (n=14,000) of women 
receive aspirin, 3.83% with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force approach in 
which 23.5% (n=940,800) receive aspirin, and 3.81% with universal prophylaxis. 
Compared with no prophylaxis, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force approach 
would save $377.4 million in direct medical care costs annually, and universal 
prophylaxis would save $365 million assuming 4 million births each year. The 
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force approach is the most cost-beneficial in 79% 
of probabilistic simulations. Assuming a willingness to pay of $100,000 per 
neonatal quality-adjusted life-year gained, the universal approach is the most 
cost-effective in more than 99% of simulations.
CONCLUSION: Both the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force approach and universal 
prophylaxis would reduce morbidity, save lives, and lower health care costs in 
the United States to a much greater degree than the approach currently 
recommended by the College.

Malignant and other chronic diseases cause the death of 2.5 million people in 
Europe annually. It is anticipated that this number will grow due to the aging 
of the European population. The death of a significant proportion of patients 
having progressive chronic disease is preceded by an extended end of life 
stadium. In this stage the patients have severe symptoms and pain that 
necessitate their symptomatic treatment and palliative care. The assessment of 
the life expectancy of patients, estimation of the prognosis of their illness 
and, therefore, selection of patients with a need of intensified palliative care 
often pose difficulties. This paper provides a summary on the basic elements of 
"good palliative care". It introduces the most frequent models for the 
procession of chronic diseases and those indicators that help practicing doctors 
to recognise easier patients with a need of intensified palliative care, and as 
a result provides more adequate medical attendance that is better suited to the 
specific needs of the patients.

INTRODUCTION: Advancements in therapy have led to dramatic increases in the life 
expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). As survival improves, young 
women with CF will have expectations for their sexual and reproductive health 
(SRH) futures similar to their counterparts without CF. As they face unique 
CF-specific SRH concerns, they may rely on CF care providers for 
disease-specific SRH care provision. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the attitudes of CF providers toward female SRH and perceived 
barriers in the current CF care model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: U.S. CF program directors (n = 16) participated in 
qualitative interviews investigating attitudes and barriers to female CF SRH 
care. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded using a thematic 
analysis approach.
RESULTS: Participants (nine pediatric, five adult, and two combined) all agreed 
CF providers have a fundamental role in CF female SRH care. Most respondents 
named lack of time and patient and provider discomfort as significant barriers 
to effective SRH communication. Other reported barriers included: lack of 
training in SRH, family members in the room, low priority of SRH in setting of 
other CF issues, and lack of adequate rapport with patients.
DISCUSSION: This is the first study to assess the attitudes and experiences of 
CF care providers toward SRH discussion and care among female CF patients. 
Despite their perceived fundamental role in CF female SRH care, CF providers 
face significant barriers. Investment in provider training is needed to better 
address the complex SRH needs of young female patients.

[THE INFLUENCE OF PROGENITOR NEURO- CELLS SUPERNATANT ON THE LYMPHO- CYTES 
CYTOTOXIC FUNCTION IN RATS WITH GLIOMA].

[Article in Ukrainian]

Liubich LD, Lisyany NI.

The impact of rat neurogenic progenitor cells supernatant (RPNS) on the 
cytotoxic function of lymphocytes in rats under conditions of physiological norm 
and experimentally modeled tumor (brain glioma strain 101.8) was studied. The 
research was carried out in animals with inoculated tumor without RPNS injection 
and with different regimes of RPNS injection (thrice repeated from 5th to 10th 
day after glioma inoculation as well as 1 week and 1 month before tumor 
inoculation). Comparison groups included rats without glioma who triple injected 
with RPNS; and intact animals (control). RPNS was received from suspension of 
neurogenic progenitor cells (NPC) of rat brain on 14th day of gestation and 
injected intraperitoneally (0,12 mg per animal). Cytotoxic function of 
lymphocytes of experimental rats was evaluated in MTT-colorimetric test with 
allogeneic glioma cells. RPNS administration increased the cytotoxic activity of 
lymphocytes in vitro tests with allogeneic tumor cells in intact animals (to 
37-38%) as well as in rats with glioma (to 11-22%). Under the RPNS influence the 
life expectancy and median survival of tumor-bearing animals increased (an 
average of 3-4 days). RPNS input modes such as triple injection from 5th to 10th 
day after glioma inoculation and 1 week before inoculation were the most 
effective. Thus, indirect tumor-inhibiting effect under intraperitoneal. RPNS 
administration in rats with glioma is demonstrated, which is obviously due to 
increased efficiency of cytotoxic function of immune cells of animals with 
inoculated tumor under the influence of the factors produced by NPC.

How to Measure Costs and Benefits of eHealth Interventions: An Overview of 
Methods and Frameworks.

North Norway, Tromsoe, Norway. trine.bergmo@telemed.no.

Information on the costs and benefits of eHealth interventions is needed, not 
only to document value for money and to support decision making in the field, 
but also to form the basis for developing business models and to facilitate 
payment systems to support large-scale services. In the absence of solid 
evidence of its effects, key decision makers may doubt the effectiveness, which, 
in turn, limits investment in, and the long-term integration of, eHealth 
services. However, it is not realistic to conduct economic evaluations of all 
eHealth applications and services in all situations, so we need to be able to 
generalize from those we do conduct. This implies that we have to select the 
most appropriate methodology and data collection strategy in order to increase 
the transferability across evaluations. This paper aims to contribute to the 
understanding of how to apply economic evaluation methodology in the eHealth 
field. It provides a brief overview of basic health economics principles and 
frameworks and discusses some methodological issues and challenges in conducting 
cost-effectiveness analysis of eHealth interventions. Issues regarding the 
identification, measurement, and valuation of costs and benefits are outlined. 
Furthermore, this work describes the established techniques of combining costs 
and benefits, presents the decision rules for identifying the preferred option, 
and outlines approaches to data collection strategies. Issues related to 
transferability and complexity are also discussed.

BACKGROUND: Early aerial senescence in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) can 
significantly limit biomass yields. WRKY transcription factors that can regulate 
senescence could be used to reprogram senescence and enhance biomass yields.
METHODS: All potential WRKY genes present in the version 1.0 of the switchgrass 
genome were identified and curated using manual and bioinformatic methods. 
Expression profiles of WRKY genes in switchgrass flag leaf RNA-Seq datasets were 
analyzed using clustering and network analyses tools to identify both WRKY and 
WRKY-associated gene co-expression networks during leaf development and 
senescence onset.
RESULTS: We identified 240 switchgrass WRKY genes including members of the RW5 
and RW6 families of resistance proteins. Weighted gene co-expression network 
analysis of the flag leaf transcriptomes across development readily separated 
clusters of co-expressed genes into thirteen modules. A visualization 
highlighted separation of modules associated with the early and senescence-onset 
phases of flag leaf growth. The senescence-associated module contained 3000 
genes including 23 WRKYs. Putative promoter regions of senescence-associated 
WRKY genes contained several cis-element-like sequences suggestive of 
responsiveness to both senescence and stress signaling pathways. A phylogenetic 
comparison of senescence-associated WRKY genes from switchgrass flag leaf with 
senescence-associated WRKY genes from other plants revealed notable hotspots in 
Group I, IIb, and IIe of the phylogenetic tree.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified and named 240 WRKY genes in the switchgrass 
genome. Twenty three of these genes show elevated mRNA levels during the onset 
of flag leaf senescence. Eleven of the WRKY genes were found in hotspots of 
related senescence-associated genes from multiple species and thus represent 
promising targets for future switchgrass genetic improvement. Overall, 
individual WRKY gene expression profiles could be readily linked to 
developmental stages of flag leaves.

Whether respondents incorporate altruistic preferences in time tradeoff (TTO) 
exercises remains understudied. We present an extended quality-adjusted 
life-year model incorporating altruism. We derive that altruism may affect TTO 
values in 2 directions. First, "longevity altruists" may wish to prolong life 
for the sake of their loved ones (to avoid being missed). Second, 
"quality-of-life altruists" may have a preference to avoid bad health states 
resulting in being a burden to loved ones. The existence and influence of these 
preferences in a TTO were empirically confirmed in a sample of 1690 respondents 
from the general public. We classified respondents as "longevity altruists" or 
"quality-of-life altruists" based on their reasoning behind inclusion of loved 
ones in their TTO responses. In line with expectations, longevity altruists 
traded fewer years than quality-of-life altruists. Nonaltruists gave 
intermediate values.

Dabigatran has been shown to be superior to warfarin for stroke prevention in 
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) but with higher out-of-pocket costs for 
patients. Although dabigatran has been shown to be cost effective from a 
societal perspective, cost implications for individual patients and insurers are 
not well described. We aimed to assess cost perspectives of each payer (Medicare 
and patient) in relation to administration, monitoring, and adverse outcomes for 
dabigatran and warfarin in patients with and without prescription drug coverage. 
Using a Markov model, we performed a decision analysis comparing 2 treatment 
strategies (dose-adjusted warfarin and dabigatran 150 mg twice daily) in 
patients 65 years old with NVAF, CHADS2 scores ≥ 1, and Medicare insurance. 
Patients have a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 8.998 quality-adjusted life 
years with warfarin and 9.39 quality-adjusted life years with dabigatran 150 mg 
twice daily. From Medicare's perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio comparing dabigatran with warfarin was $35,311 for patients with Part D 
coverage and cost saving for patients without coverage. From the patient's 
perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio comparing dabigatran with 
warfarin was cost saving for patients with Part D coverage and $63,884 for those 
without coverage. In patients ≥ 65 years with NVAF and prescription insurance 
coverage, dabigatran 150 mg twice daily is both cost effective (Medicare's 
perspective) and cost saving (patient perspective) compared with warfarin, at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000. However, patients without prescription 
drug coverage have a high out-of-pocket cost burden with dabigatran therapy, 
leading to a reduction in its cost-effectiveness compared with warfarin therapy. 
In conclusion, this Markov model suggests that Medicare Part D coverage 
influences the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran 150 mg daily compared with 
dose-adjusted warfarin from multiple payer perspectives.

AIMS: Recent cost-effectiveness analyses of percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI) versus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have been limited by a short 
time horizon or were restricted to the US healthcare perspective. We, therefore, 
used individual patient-level data from the SYNTAX trial to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of PCI versus CABG from a European (Dutch) perspective.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2007, 1800 patients with three-vessel or 
left main coronary artery disease were randomised to either CABG (n=897) or PCI 
with drug-eluting stents (DES; n=903). Costs were estimated for all patients 
based on observed healthcare resource usage over 5 years of follow-up. Health 
state utilities were evaluated with the EuroQOL questionnaire. A patient-level 
microsimulation model based on Dutch life-tables was used to extrapolate the 
5-year in-trial data to a lifetime horizon. Although initial procedural costs 
were lower for CABG, total initial hospitalisation costs per patient were higher 
(€17 506 vs €14 037, p<0.001). PCI was more costly during the next 5 years of 
follow-up, due to more frequent hospitalisations, repeat revascularisation 
procedures and higher medication costs. Nevertheless, total 5-year costs 
remained €2465/patient higher with CABG. When the in-trial results were 
extrapolated to a lifetime horizon, CABG was projected to be economically 
attractive relative to DES-PCI, with gains in both life expectancy and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) (€5390/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained) was favourable and 
remained <€80 000/QALY in >90% of the bootstrap replicates. Outcomes were 
similar when incorporating the prognostic impact of non-fatal myocardial 
infarction and stroke, as well as across a broad range of assumptions regarding 
the effect of CABG on post-trial survival and costs. However, DES-PCI was 
economically dominant compared with CABG in patients with a SYNTAX Score ≤22 or 
in those with left main disease. In patients for whom the SYNTAX Score II 
favoured PCI based on lower predicted 4-year mortality, PCI was also 
economically dominant, whereas in those patients for whom the SYNTAX Score II 
favoured surgery, CABG was highly economically attractive (ICER range, €2967 to 
€3737/QALY gained).
CONCLUSIONS: For the broad population with three-vessel or left main disease who 
are candidates for either CABG or PCI, we found that CABG is a clinically and 
economically attractive revascularisation strategy compared with DES-PCI from a 
Dutch healthcare perspective. The cost-effectiveness of CABG versus PCI differed 
according to several anatomic factors, however. The newly developed SYNTAX Score 
II provides enhanced prognostic discrimination in this population, and may be a 
useful tool to guide resource allocation as well.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about sex-specific trends in lung cancer mortality 
and years of potential life lost (YPLL) attributable to lung cancer over more 
than five decades. The aim of the present study was to describe mortality and 
YPLL due to lung cancer over 61 years of observation in a country with a high 
smoking prevalence.
METHODS: We obtained data on trends in lung cancer mortality, population-level 
vital statistics, sales of taxed tobacco products, and survey data on smoking 
behavior among the German population. We then undertook joinpoint regression 
analyses to determine sex-specific trends in lung cancer mortality and YPLL.
RESULTS: Rates of lung cancer mortality and rates of lung cancer among all 
causes of death increased more among females than among males. Although YPLL 
among females increased from 6.6 in 1952 to 11.3 in 2012, this figure was found 
to have decreased from 7.3 to 4.4 among males in the same period. Sales of 
tobacco subject to tax increased from 1,509 cigarette equivalents per resident 
aged 15 or older in 1952 to 2,916 in 1976 - after which there was a decline. The 
prevalence of current smoking among females aged 35 years or older remained 
stable between 17.9 and 18.9 % in the period from 1989 to 2009. Among males in
