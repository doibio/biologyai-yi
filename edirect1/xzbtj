{pre-post change: placebo -14 [standard deviation (SD) 50]mV, experimental 28 
(SD 48)mV; mean difference -42mV; 95% confidence interval of the difference -76 
to 7; P<0.05} albeit small (Grissom=0.44). However, both groups showed a 
significant reduction in pain immediately after the intervention, and both 
groups showed a similar pre-post change in PPT.
CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings indicate that grade III central 
mobilisation over the most symptomatic thoracic segment reduces thoracic erector 
spinae activity during extension of the trunk in people with non-specific 
thoracic spine pain.

OBJECTIVE: To review the epidemiology and update the scientific knowledge on the 
problems of development and behavior in childhood, and the recommendations for 
the role of the pediatrician in identifying and managing delays and disturbances 
in child development and mental health.
SOURCES: A search for relevant literature was performed in the PubMed and Scopus 
databases and publications of the National Scientific Council on the Developing 
Child.
SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: With the decline in the incidence of communicable 
diseases in children, problems with development, behavior, and emotional 
regulation are increasingly becoming a part of the work of pediatricians, yet 
many are not trained and feel uncomfortable about this extension of their role. 
The available screening tools for child development and behavior are reviewed, 
and a 'school readiness' checklist is presented, together with recommendations 
on how the pediatrician can incorporate developmental surveillance into routine 
practice, aware of the need for children to acquire social, emotional, and 
cognitive skills so that they can develop their full potential.
CONCLUSIONS: The pediatrician's role in the future will include both physical 
and mental health, recognizing that social development, resilience, and 
emotional maturity are as important as physical growth and neuromotor skills in 
a child's life course.

Laboratory of Liaoning Province, National & Local Joint Engineering Research 
Centre for Storage, Processing and Safety Control Technology for Fresh 
Agricultural and Aquatic Products, Jinzhou 121013, China.

BACKGROUND: Shrimp is a low-fat, high-protein aquatic product, and is 
susceptible to spoilage during storage. To establish an effective method for the 
quality control of Pacific white shrimp, the effects of polyphenols (PP) and 
polysaccharides (PS) from Porphyra yezoensis on the quality of Pacific white 
shrimp were assessed during refrigerated storage. Pacific white shrimp samples 
were treated with 5 g L-1 polyphenols, and 8 g L-1 polysaccharides, then stored 
at 4 ± 1 °C for 8 days. All samples were subjected to measurement of total 
viable count (TVC), pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), K-value, 
thiobarbituric acid (TBA), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, and were also 
assessed by sensory evaluation.
RESULTS: The results showed that PP, PS, and the mixture of polyphenols and 
polysaccharides (PP+PS) could inhibit the increase of total volatile basic 
nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and K-value, and reduce total viable 
count (TVC) compared with the control group. PP could also inhibit polyphenol 
oxidase (PPO) activity. Sensory evaluation proved the efficacy of PP and PS by 
maintaining the overall quality of Pacific white shrimp during refrigerated 
storage. Moreover, PP+PS could extend the shelf-life of shrimp by 3-4 days 
compared with the control group.
CONCLUSION: PP+PS could more effectively maintain quality and extend shelf-life 
during refrigerated storage. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.

The Programming Power of the Placenta.

Cambridge Cambridge, UK.

Size at birth is a critical determinant of life expectancy, and is dependent 
primarily on the placental supply of nutrients. However, the placenta is not 
just a passive organ for the materno-fetal transfer of nutrients and oxygen. 
Studies show that the placenta can adapt morphologically and functionally to 
optimize substrate supply, and thus fetal growth, under adverse intrauterine 
conditions. These adaptations help meet the fetal drive for growth, and their 
effectiveness will determine the amount and relative proportions of specific 
metabolic substrates supplied to the fetus at different stages of development. 
This flow of nutrients will ultimately program physiological systems at the 
gene, cell, tissue, organ, and system levels, and inadequacies can cause 
permanent structural and functional changes that lead to overt disease, 
particularly with increasing age. This review examines the environmental 
regulation of the placental phenotype with particular emphasis on the impact of 
maternal nutritional challenges and oxygen scarcity in mice, rats and guinea 
pigs. It also focuses on the effects of such conditions on fetal growth and the 
developmental programming of disease postnatally. A challenge for future 
research is to link placental structure and function with clinical phenotypes in 
the offspring.

No effect of low-level chronic neonicotinoid exposure on bumblebee learning and 
fecundity.

In recent years, many pollinators have declined in abundance and diversity 
worldwide, presenting a potential threat to agricultural productivity, 
biodiversity and the functioning of natural ecosystems. One of the most debated 
factors proposed to be contributing to pollinator declines is exposure to 
pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, a widely used class of systemic 
insecticide. Also, newly emerging parasites and diseases, thought to be spread 
via contact with managed honeybees, may pose threats to other pollinators such 
as bumblebees. Compared to honeybees, bumblebees could be particularly 
vulnerable to the effects of stressors due to their smaller and more short-lived 
colonies. Here, we studied the effect of field-realistic, chronic clothianidin 
exposure and inoculation with the parasite Nosema ceranae on survival, 
fecundity, sugar water collection and learning using queenless Bombus terrestris 
audax microcolonies in the laboratory. Chronic exposure to 1 ppb clothianidin 
had no significant effects on the traits studied. Interestingly, pesticide 
exposure in combination with additional stress caused by harnessing bees for 
Proboscis Extension Response (PER) learning assays, led to an increase in 
mortality. In contrast to previous findings, the bees did not become infected by 
N. ceranae after experimental inoculation with the parasite spores, suggesting 
variability in host resistance or parasite virulence. However, this treatment 
induced a slight, short-term reduction in sugar water collection, potentially 
through stimulation of the immune system of the bees. Our results suggest that 
chronic exposure to 1 ppb clothianidin does not have adverse effects on 
bumblebee fecundity or learning ability.

BACKGROUND: Although primary treatment of localized prostate cancer provides 
excellent oncologic control, some men who chose radiotherapy experience a 
recurrence of disease. There is no consensus on the most appropriate management 
of these patients after radiotherapy failure. In this single-institution review, 
we compare our oncologic outcome and toxicity between salvage prostatectomy and 
cryotherapy treatments.
METHODS: From January 2004 to June 2013, a total of 23 salvage procedures were 
performed. Six of those patients underwent salvage prostatectomy while 17 
underwent salvage cryotherapy by two high-volume fellowship-trained urologists. 
Patients being considered for salvage therapy had localized disease at 
presentation, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 10 ng/mL at recurrence, life 
expectancy > 10 years at recurrence, and a negative metastatic workup. Patients 
were followed to observe cancer progression and toxicity of treatment.
RESULTS: Patients who underwent salvage cryotherapy were statistically older 
with a higher incidence of hypertension than our salvage prostatectomy cohort. 
With a mean follow up of 14.1 months and 7.2 months, the incidence of disease 
progression was 23.5% and 16.7% after salvage cryotherapy and prostatectomy, 
respectively. The overall complication rate was also 23.5% versus 16.7%, with 
the most frequent complication after salvage cryotherapy being urethral 
stricture and after salvage prostatectomy being severe urinary incontinence. 
There were no rectal injuries with salvage prostatectomy and one rectourethral 
fistula in the cohort after salvage cryotherapy.
CONCLUSION: While recurrences from primary radiotherapy for prostate cancer do 
occur, there is no consensus on its management. In our experience, salvage 
procedures were generally safe and effective. Both salvage cryotherapy and 
salvage prostatectomy allow for adequate cancer control with minimal toxicity.

Recent Strategies for Treating Stage IV Gastric Cancer: Roles of Palliative 
Gastrectomy, Chemotherapy, and Radiotherapy.

Recently, many strategies have been reported for the effective treatment of 
gastric cancer. However, the strategy for treating stage IV gastric cancer 
remains controversial. Conducting a prospective phase III study in stage IV 
cancer patients is difficult because of heterogeneous performance status, age, 
and degree of cancer metastasis or extension. Due to poor prognosis, the 
variance in physical status, and severe symptoms, it is important to determine 
the optimal strategy for treating each individual stage IV patient. In the past 
decade, many reports have addressed topics related to stage IV gastric cancer: 
the 7th Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM staging system has 
altered its stage IV classification; new chemotherapy regimens have been 
developed through the randomized ECF for advanced and locally advanced 
esophagogastric cancer (REAL)-II, S-1 plus cisplatin versus S-1 in RCT in the 
treatment for stomach cancer (SPIRITS), trastuzumab for gastric cancer (ToGA), 
ramucirumab monotherapy for previously-treated advanced gastric or 
gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (REGARD), and ramucirumab plus 
paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel in patients with previously-treated 
advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (RAINBOW) trials; 
and the survival efficacy of palliative gastrectomy has been denied by the 
reductive gastrectomy for advanced tumor in three Asian countries (REGATTA) 
trial. Current strategies for treating stage IV patients can be roughly divided 
into the following five categories: palliative gastrectomy, chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy, gastric stent, or bypass. In this article, we review recent 
publications and guidelines along with above categories in the light of 
individual symptoms and prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: To clarify the clinical, cytogenetical and molecular characteristics 
and prognosis of Ph(+) ALL patients with ABL kinase domain mutations (ABL-KDMs), 
and to evaluate the therapeutic value of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (allo-HSCT) combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in 
these patients.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinical features, molecular genetic 
characteristics, mutation distribution and prognosis of newly diagnosed Ph(+) 
ALL patients with ABL-KDMs from February 2010 to August 2014 were performed, and 
the efficacy of treatment regimen of allo-HSCT combined with different TKIs was 
compared.
RESULTS: Of 88 Ph(+) ALL patients during maintenance treatment stage for 
ABL-KDMs monitoring, mutation was detected in 42 patients with median time of 8 
months from diagnosis to mutation occurrence. The median age of mutation group 
was 40-year-old, older than that of non-mutation group (32.5-year-old) 
(P=0.023). The incidence of complex chromosome abnormality of mutation group was 
higher than that of non-mutation group (P=0.043), with alternations in 
chromosome 7, 5 and +Ph more frequently observed. There were 21 types of 
mutation at 18 locations detected, with T315I mutation ranking the top followed 
by E255K/V, Y253H/F and E459K. Mutation group featured no significant difference 
in complete remission (CR) rate in contrast to nonmutation group, but was 
remarkably lower in major molecular remission (MMR) rate than non-mutation 
group. The 2 year and 5 year overall survival rate of mutation group was 45.4% 
and 35.0% respectively, much shorter than that of non-mutation group (67.8% and 
63.3%), (P=0.047). The median survival of patients with T315I and E255K/V was 19 
and 10 months, significantly shorter than that of patients with other mutations. 
Among the 42 patients with mutations, 14 underwent allo-HSCT, and the median 
survival was 29 months, longer than that of patients received chemotherapy alone 
(17 months) (P=0.024). Fourteen allo-HSCT patients were given nilotinib or 
dasatinib at the time of mutation occurrence, and there was no significant 
difference in the overall survival in contrast to patients who continue to take 
imatinib.
CONCLUSIONS: ABL kinase domain mutations are closely related to the older age 
and high genomic instability in the newly diagnosed Ph(+) ALL patients. Mutation 
types showed diversity and complexity, which remarkably affected patients' 
prognosis and survival. T315I and E255K mutations account for more than half of 
all cases, characterized by a less favorable prognosis. Currently, allo-HSCT is 
the only method that has the potential of elongating life expectancy, but the 
utility of second-generation TKI during relapse does not necessarily have an 
edge on survival over imatinib.

目的: 探讨Ph染色体阳性急性淋巴细胞白血病(Ph+ 
ALL)ABL激酶区突变患者的临床、分子遗传学特征和生存情况，分析异基因造血干细胞移植(allo-HSCT)联合酪氨酸激酶抑制剂(TKI)在突变患者中的应用价值。
方法: 回顾性分析2010年2月至2014年8月检出ABL激酶区突变Ph+ 
ALL患者初诊阶段的临床、分子遗传学特征及突变分布、预后，并比较allo-HSCT联合不同类型TKI的疗效。
结果: 88例Ph+ 
ALL患者于维持治疗阶段行ABL激酶区突变监测，42例患者检出突变，中位突变时间为8个月。突变组患者中位发病年龄为40岁，较非突变组(32.5岁)大(P=0.023)；染色体复杂核型发生率高于非突变组(P=0.043)，其中以累及7号、5号染色体以及＋Ph更常见。42例突变患者共检出18个突变位点、21种突变类型，T315I突变比例最高，其余依次为E255K/V、Y253H/F、E459K。突变患者诱导治疗完全缓解率与非突变组相比差异无统计学意义，但主要分子生物学反应率显著低于非突变组(P=0.015)。突变患者2年及5年总体生存(OS)率分别为45.4%、35.0%，明显低于非突变组患者(67.8%、63.3%)(P=0.047)。存在T315I、E255K/V突变的患者中位OS时间分别为19和10个月，较其他类型突变者短(P=0.024)。42例突变患者中14例行allo-HSCT并于移植前即检出突变，其中位OS时间为29个月，长于非移植(巩固化疗联合TKI治疗)患者的17个月(P=0.034)。移植患者中14例突变检出时更换使用尼洛替尼或达沙替尼治疗，但中位OS时间与未更换者差异无统计学意义(P=0.862)。
结论: 
ABL激酶区突变与初诊发病年龄较高以及高基因组不稳定性紧密相关。突变类型呈现多样性和复杂性，其中以T315I和E255K/V突变更常见，且较其他类型突变者预后更差。allo-HSCT能够改善突变患者预后，但复发耐药阶段更换使用二代TKI不能明显改善突变患者生存。

Rheumatic Diseases, Wichita, Kansas.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of all 4 interventions in the 
Treatment of Early Aggressive Rheumatoid Arthritis (TEAR) clinical trial: 
immediate triple (IT), immediate etanercept (IE), step-up triple (ST), and 
step-up etanercept (SE). Step-up interventions started with methotrexate and 
added either etanercept or sulfasalazine plus hydroxychloroquine to patients 
with persistent disease activity.
METHODS: We built a Markov cohort model that uses individual-level data from the 
TEAR trial, published literature, and supplemental clinical data. Costs were in 
US dollars, benefits in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), perspective was 
societal, and the time horizon was 5 years.
RESULTS: The immediate strategies were more efficacious than step-up strategies. 
SE and IE were more costly than ST and IT, primarily due to treatment cost 
differences. In addition, IT was the least expensive and most effective strategy 
when the time horizon was 1 and 2 years. When the time horizon was 5 years, IE 
was marginally more effective than IT (3.483 versus 3.476 QALYs), but IE was 
substantially more expensive than IT ($148,800 versus $52,600), producing an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $12.5 million per QALY. These results 
were robust to both one-way deterministic and joint probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
CONCLUSION: IT was highly cost-effective in the majority of scenarios. Although 
IE was more effective in 5 years, a substantial reduction in the cost of 
biologic agents was required in order for IE to become cost-effective in early 
aggressive RA under willingness-to-pay thresholds that most health care settings 
may find acceptable.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and 
cost-effectiveness of high-dose edoxaban compared with adjusted-dose warfarin in 
patients at risk for stroke who have nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and 
a creatinine clearance (Clcr ) of 15-95 ml/minute.
METHODS: A Markov model was created to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
high-dose edoxaban and adjusted-dose warfarin in patients with a Clcr of 15-95 
ml/minute. The model was performed from a U.S. societal perspective and assumed 
patients initiated therapy at 70 years of age, had a mean CHADS2 (congestive 
heart failure, hypertension, age 75 or older, diabetes, stroke) score of 3, and 
no contraindications to anticoagulation. The model assumed a cycle length of 1 
month and a lifetime horizon (maximum of 30 years/360 cycles). Data sources 
included renal subgroup analysis of the Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa 
Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation (ENGAGE-AF) trial and other published 
studies. Outcomes included lifetime costs (2014 US$), QALYs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios. The robustness of the model's conclusions was tested 
using one-way and 10,000-iteration probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA).
RESULTS: Patients treated with high-dose edoxaban lived an average of 10.50 
QALYs at a lifetime treatment cost of $99,833 compared with 10.11 QALYs and 
$123,516 for those treated with adjusted-dose warfarin. The model's conclusions 
were found to be robust upon one-way sensitivity analyses. PSA suggested 
high-dose edoxaban was economically dominant compared with adjusted-dose 
warfarin in more than 99% of the 10,000 iterations run.
CONCLUSIONS: High-dose edoxaban appears to be an economically dominant strategy 
when compared with adjusted-dose warfarin for the prevention of stroke in NVAF 
patients with a Clcr of 15-95 ml/minute and an appreciable risk of stroke.

Advances in the understanding of neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) biology and 
function have demonstrated that this receptor, primarily identified for the 
transfer of passive immunity from mother infant, is involved in several 
biological and immunological processes. In fact, FcRn is responsible for the 
long half-life of IgG and albumin in the serum, by creating an intracellular 
protein reservoir, which is protected from lysosomal degradation and, 
importantly, trafficked across the cell. Such discovery has led researchers to 
hypothesize the role for this unique receptor in the controlled delivery of 
therapeutic agents. A great amount of FcRn-based strategies are already under 
extensive investigation, in which FcRn reveals to have profound impact on the 
biodistribution and half-life extension of therapeutic agents. This review 
summarizes the main findings on FcRn biology, function and distribution 
throughout different tissues, together with the main advances on the FcRn-based 
therapeutic opportunities and model systems, which indicate that this receptor 
is a potential target for therapeutic regimen modification.

Leukocyte common antigen-related receptor tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) have 
emerged as key players that organize various aspects of neuronal development, 
including axon guidance, neurite extension, and synapse formation and function. 
Recent research has highlighted the roles of LAR-RPTPs at neuronal synapses in 
mediating distinct synaptic adhesion pathways through interactions with a host 
of extracellular ligands and in governing a variety of intracellular signaling 
cascades through binding to various scaffolds and signaling proteins. In this 
chapter, we review and update current research progress on the extracellular 
ligands of LAR-RPTPs, regulation of their extracellular interactions by 
alternative splicing and heparan sulfates, and their intracellular signaling 
machineries. In particular, we review structural insights on complexes of 
LAR-RPTPs with their various ligands. These studies lend support to general 
molecular mechanisms underlying LAR-RPTP-mediated synaptic adhesion and 
signaling pathways.

INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have shown that sitting time is associated with 
increased risk of all-cause mortality, independent of moderate to vigorous 
physical activity. Less is known about the population-attributable fraction for 
all-cause mortality associated with sitting time, and the gains in life 
expectancy related to the elimination of this risk factor.
METHODS: In November 2015, data were gathered from one published meta-analysis, 
54 adult surveys on sitting time distribution (from 2002 to 2011), in 
conjunction with national statistics on population size, life table, and overall 
deaths. Population-attributable fraction for all-cause mortality associated with 
sitting time >3 hours/day was estimated for each country, WHO regions, and 
worldwide. Gains in life expectancy related to the elimination of sitting time 
>3 hours/day was estimated using life table analysis.
RESULTS: Sitting time was responsible for 3.8% of all-cause mortality (about 
433,000 deaths/year) among those 54 countries. All-cause mortality due to 
sitting time was higher in the countries from the Western Pacific region, 
followed by European, Eastern Mediterranean, American, and Southeast Asian 
countries. Eliminating sitting time would increase life expectancy by 0.20 years 
in those countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that the effect of sitting time on all-cause mortality 
risk is independent of physical activity, reducing sitting time plays an 
important role in active lifestyle promotion, which is an important aspect of 
premature mortality prevention worldwide.

PURPOSE: Focal therapy in low-risk prostate cancer may provide the best balance 
between cancer control and quality of life preservation. As a minimally invasive 
approach performed under TRUS guidance, brachytherapy is an appealing framework 
for focal therapy. However, the contrast in TRUS images is generally 
insufficient to distinguish the target lesion from normal prostate tissue. MRI 
usually offers a much better contrast between the lesion and surrounding 
tissues. Registration between TRUS and MRI may therefore significantly improve 
lesion targeting capability in focal prostate brachytherapy. In this paper, we 
present a deformable registration framework for the accurate fusion of TRUS and 
MRI prostate volumes under large deformations arising from dissimilarities in 
diameter, shape and orientation between endorectal coils and TRUS probes.
METHODS: Following pose correction by a RANSAC implementation of the ICP 
algorithm, TRUS and MRI Prostate contour points are represented by a 3D 
extension of the shape-context descriptor and matched by the Hungarian 
algorithm. Eventually, a smooth free-form warping is computed by fitting a 3D 
B-spline mesh to the set of matched points.
RESULTS: Quantitative validation of the registration accuracy is provided on a 
retrospective set of ten real cases, using as landmarks either brachytherapy 
seeds (six cases) or external beam radiotherapy fiducials (four cases) implanted 
and visible in both modalities. The average registration error between the 
landmarks was 2.49 and 3.20 mm, for the brachytherapy and external beam sets, 
respectively, that is less than the MRI voxels' long axis length ([Formula: see 
text]). The overall average registration error (for brachytherapy and external 
beam datasets together) was 2.56 mm.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method provides a promising framework for TRUS-MRI 
registration in focal prostate brachytherapy.

Reducing inequalities in health and life expectancy.

Neve J, Briers G.

The risk of premature death in people with severe mental illness or learning 
disabilities is significantly higher than the general population. This is mostly 
caused by treatable long-term conditions. This article describes research 
conducted to establish the evidence base and draw up priorities for action, 
along with the competencies mental health and learning disability nurses need to 
improve service users' physical healthcare.

The Saguenay Youth Study (SYS) is a two-generational study of adolescents and 
their parents (n = 1029 adolescents and 962 parents) aimed at investigating the 
aetiology, early stages and trans-generational trajectories of common 
cardiometabolic and brain diseases. The ultimate goal of this study is to 
identify effective means for increasing healthy life expectancy. The cohort was 
recruited from the genetic founder population of the Saguenay Lac St Jean region 
of Quebec, Canada. The participants underwent extensive (15-h) phenotyping, 
including an hour-long recording of beat-by-beat blood pressure, magnetic 
resonance imaging of the brain and abdomen, and serum lipidomic profiling with 
LC-ESI-MS. All participants have been genome-wide genotyped (with ∼ 8 M imputed 
single nucleotide polymorphisms) and a subset of them (144 adolescents and their 
288 parents) has been genome-wide epityped (whole blood DNA, Infinium 
HumanMethylation450K BeadChip). These assessments are complemented by a detailed 
evaluation of each participant in a number of domains, including cognition, 
mental health and substance use, diet, physical activity and sleep, and family 
environment. The data collection took place during 2003-12 in adolescents (full) 
and their parents (partial), and during 2012-15 in parents (full). All data are 
available upon request.

Effective methods to prevent or delay the onset of frailty are urgently required 
in aging societies, such as Japan. As a public health approach, we carried out a 
10-year community intervention for frailty prevention, and examined its impact 
on healthy aging among older adults. The target population was all residents 
aged 65 years or older in the town of Kusatsu, Gunma Prefecture, Japan. For 
community empowerment, we organized a community forum, and discussed how to 
address the frailty issue in the community. For primary prevention, we attempted 
to promote physical activity, nutrition and social participation by means of a 
health education program to motivate older residents. For secondary prevention, 
we added a comprehensive geriatric assessment to routine annual health 
check-ups, which helped older participants improve self-care ability of 
functional health. High-risk persons were screened and encouraged to participate 
in a frailty prevention class with a multicomponent program. The attendance rate 
at annual health check-ups has remained constant at 30-40% of the target 
population; however, over 80% of the population appeared at least once during 
the 10 year-period. For evaluation, we carried out biennial health monitoring 
surveys, and reviewed the records of the local Long-Term Care Insurance system. 
The functional health of older residents was significantly improved as a result 
of the interventions; the incidence rate of Long-Term Care Insurance system 
certification in the old-old population (age ≥75 years) was decreased by one 
second, and healthy life expectancy at age 70 years was extended by 1.2 years 
for women and 0.5 years for men. Such trends greatly contrasted with those in 
the reference area, and Japan as a whole. In summary, the present public health 
approach to frailty prevention appears to promote healthy aging among older 
adults.

BACKGROUND: Aim was to estimate the age and sex-stratified prevalence of Down's 
syndrome (DS) in the United Kingdom (UK) general population using a large 
primary care database.
METHOD: Data source was the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We divided the 
number of individuals with a record of DS present on 01/07/2014 by the total 
number of individuals, and computed Wilson's confidence intervals. Prevalence by 
age and sex was represented using local linear smoothing plots.
RESULTS: On July 1(st) 2014, 1159 females and 1317 males with DS were present in 
the data, corresponding to a prevalence of 5.9 per 10 000 (95% CI: 5.5; 6.2) in 
females and 6.8 (6.5; 7.2) per 10 000 in males. Prevalence of DS was increased 
in individuals aged 40 to 55 years compared to adjacent age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: A relative peak prevalence of DS at age 40-55 years may be 
attributed to the combined effects of a rise in life expectancy and the still 
limited availability of selective abortion.

USA.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemias 
has increased with the development of improved treatment over the last few 
decades. However, β-thalassemia disorder still has considerable lifetime 
treatment demands and heightened risk of frequent complications due to 
transfusion-transmitted infections and iron overload, which may affect 
thalassemic patients' functioning in different domains.
OBJECTIVES: The vast majority of published studies on thalassemic patients have 
focused on children and adolescent functioning, and little research has examined 
adults. Hence, the current study was planned to examine the functioning and 
resilience of adult thalassemic patients in a comprehensive way.
METHODS: We examined multidimensional resilience and functioning across 
different domains (psychological adjustment, treatment adherence, social 
functioning and occupational functioning). We also examined demographic and 
medical variables that may relate to resilience and functioning. Participants 
were adult patients [n = 38; age M = 31·63, standard deviation (SD) = 7·72; 72% 
female] with transfusion-dependent thalassemia in treatment in a hospital in the 
northeastern United States.
RESULTS: The results suggest that most adult thalassemic patients tend to be 
resilient, demonstrating good functioning in four main domains: psychological 
adjustment, treatment adherence, social functioning and occupational 
functioning.
CONCLUSION: Despite the considerable demands of their illness, adult thalassemic 
patients appeared to be adapting well, demonstrating evidence of 
multidimensional resilience.

BACKGROUND: Complex abdominal wall reconstruction is beset by postoperative 
complications. A recent meta-analysis comparing the use of closed-incision 
negative-pressure therapy to standard dressings found a statistically 
significant reduction in surgical-site infection. The use of closed-incision 
negative-pressure therapy is gaining acceptance in this population; however, the 
economic impact of this innovative dressing remains unknown. In this study, a 
cost-utility analysis was performed assessing closed-incision negative-pressure 
therapy and standard dressings following closure of abdominal incisions in 
high-risk patients.
METHODS: Cost-utility methodology involved reviewing literature related to 
closed-incision negative-pressure therapy in abdominal wall surgery, obtaining 
utility estimates to calculate quality-adjusted life-year scores for successful 
surgery and surgery complicated by surgical-site infection, summing costs using 
Medicare Current Procedural Terminology codes, and creating a decision tree 
illuminating the most cost-effective dressing strategy. One-way sensitivity 
analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the results.
RESULTS: The aforementioned meta-analysis comparing closed-incision 
negative-pressure therapy to standard dressings included a subset of five 
studies assessing abdominal wall surgery in 829 patients (260 closed-incision 
negative-pressure therapy and 569 standard dressings). Decision tree analysis 
revealed an estimated savings of $1546.52 and a gain of 0.0024 quality-adjusted 
life-year with closed-incision negative-pressure therapy compared with standard 
dressings; therefore, closed-incision negative-pressure therapy is a dominant 
treatment strategy. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that closed-incision 
negative-pressure therapy is a cost-effective option when the surgical-site 
infection rate is greater than 16.39 percent.
CONCLUSION: The use of closed-incision negative-pressure therapy is cost-saving 
following closure of abdominal incisions in high-risk patients.

Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH§Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Center in 
Musculoskeletal Diseases, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH.

STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of operative versus non-operative 
treatment of type-II odontoid fractures in patients older than 64 years old.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Significant controversy exists regarding the optimum 
treatment of geriatric patients with type-II odontoid fractures. Operative 
treatment leads to lower rates of non-union but carries surgical risks. 
Non-operative treatment does not carry surgical risks but has higher non-union 
rates.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was created to compare operative and 
non-operative treatment of type-II odontoid fractures among three age cohorts 
(65-74, 75-84, >84) based on expected costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; cost per QALY gained). 
Age-specific mortality rates for both treatments, costs for treatment, and 
complication rates were taken from the literature, and data from 2010 US life 
tables were used for age-specific life expectancy. Costs of complications were 
estimated using data obtained at a level-I trauma center using micro-costing. 
Sensitivity analyses of all model parameters were conducted.
RESULTS: Among the 65- to 74-year-old cohort, operative treatment was more 
costly ($53,407 vs. $30,553) and more effective (12.00 vs. 10.11 QALY), with an 
ICER of $12,078/QALY. Among the 75- to 84-year-old cohort, operative treatment 
was more costly ($51,308 vs. $29,789) and more effective (6.85 vs. 6.31 QALY), 
with an ICER of $40,467/QALY. Among the over-84 cohort, operative treatment was 
dominated by non-operative treatment as it was both more costly ($45,978 vs. 
$28,872) and less effective (2.48 vs. 3.73 QALY). The model was robust to 
sensitivity analysis across reasonable ranges for utility of union, disutility 
of complications and delayed surgery, and probabilities of non-union and 
complications.
CONCLUSION: Operative treatment is cost-effective in patients age 65 to 84 when 
using $100,000/QALY as a benchmark but less effective and more costly than 
non-operative treatment in patients older than 84 years.

Aim: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a chronic, neurodegenerative 
disease, which leads to development of malnutrition. The main purpose of this 
research was to analyze the impact of malnutrition on the course of the disease 
and long-term survival. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis has been 
performed on 48 patients (22 F [45,83%] and 26 M [54,17%], the average age of 
patients: 66,2 [43-83]) in 2008-2014.The analysis of the initial state of 
nutrition was measured by body mass index (BMI), nutritional status according to 
NRS 2002, SGA and concentration of albumin in blood serum. Patients were divided 
into two groups, depending on the state of nutrition: well-nourished and 
malnourished. The groups were created separately for each of these, which 
allowed an additional comparative analysis of techniques used for the assessment 
of nutritional status. Results: Proper state of nutrition was interrelated with 
longer survival (SGA: 456 vs. 679 days, NRS: 312vs. 659vs. 835 days, BMI: 
respectively, 411, 541, 631 days, results were statistically significant for NRS 
and BMI). Concentration of albumin was not a prognostic factor, but longer 
survival was observed when level of albumin was increased during nutritional 
therapy. Conclusions: The initial nutrition state and positive response to 
enteral feeding is associated with better survival among patients with ALS. For 
this reason, nutritional therapy should be introduced as soon as possible.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: la esclerosis lateral amiotrófica (ELA) es una enfermedad 
crónica, neurodegenerativa que genera malnutrición. El objetivo principal de 
este estudio es analizar el impacto de la malnutrición en el curso de la 
enfermedad y la sobrevida a largo plazo.
MATERIALES Y MÉTODOS: se realizó un análisis retrospectivo de 48 pacientes (22 
mujeres [45.83%] y 26 hombres [54.17%], con un promedio de edad de 66,2 [43-83]) 
del 2008 al 2014. El análisis del estado nutricional inicial se midió utilizando 
el índice de  masa corporal (IMC), el estado nutricional de acuerdo al NRS 2002, 
la valoración global subjetiva (VGS) y la concentración sérica de albúmina. Los 
pacientes se dividieron en dos grupos, dependiendo del estado nutricional en el 
que se encontraban: bien nutridos o malnutridos. Los grupos se crearon por  
separado, lo que permitió un análisis comparativo adicional de las técnicas 
utilizadas para la evaluación del estado nutricional.
RESULTADOS: un estado nutricional adecuado se relaciona con mayor sobreviva a 
largo plazo (456 vs. 679 días, NRS 312 vs. 659 vs. 835 días, IMC 
respectivamente: 41, 541, 631 días, resultados estadísticamente significativos 
para NRS e IMC). Las concentraciones de albúmina no fueron un factor pronóstico, 
pero se observó mayor sobrevida si las concentraciones de albúmina incrementaban 
durante el tratamiento nutricional.
CONCLUSIONES: el estado nutricional inicial y la respuesta positiva a la 
alimentación enteral están asociados a mayor sobrevida en pacientes con ELA, 
razón por la cual, la terapia nutricional debe de iniciarse lo antes posible.
