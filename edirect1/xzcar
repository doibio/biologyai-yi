permissible. Here I argue that there are instances where human germline editing 
should be prohibited because harms can be anticipated from the results of 
studies of aspects of human psychology. The example I have chosen to illustrate 
this argument is prolongation of the human lifespan. Cohort and longitudinal 
studies demonstrate that a vital ingredient of human contentment and health is 
being integrated into a cohort of similarly aged people and experiencing life's 
trials and tribulations contemporaneously. A person genetically engineered to 
live longer than their peers will experience the loss of their cohort and many 
from the generation following them-an established risk factor for discontentment 
and ill health. Since germline genome editing precludes obtaining the consent of 
the individual in question, and that such a predictable harm will be commonly 
encountered, it is questionable that human germline editing to extend lifespan 
can ever be considered an ethical practice.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Punctate white matter lesions are common in preterm 
neonates. Neurodevelopmental outcomes of the neonates are related to the degree 
of extension. This study aimed to characterize the extent of microstructural 
variations for different punctate white matter lesion grades.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preterm neonates with punctate white matter lesions were 
divided into 3 grades (from mild to severe: grades I-III). DTI-derived 
fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity between 
patients with punctate white matter lesions and controls were compared with 
Tract-Based Spatial Statistics and tract-quantification methods.
RESULTS: Thirty-three preterm neonates with punctate white matter lesions and 33 
matched controls were enrolled. There were 15, 9, and 9 patients, respectively, 
in grades I, II, and III. Punctate white matter lesions were mainly located in 
white matter adjacent to the lateral ventricles, especially regions lateral to 
the trigone, posterior horns, and centrum semiovale and/or corona radiata. 
Extensive microstructural changes were observed in neonates with grade III 
punctate white matter lesions, while no significant changes in DTI metrics were 
found for grades I and II. A pattern of increased axial diffusivity, increased 
radial diffusivity, and reduced/unchanged fractional anisotropy was found in 
regions adjacent to punctate white matter lesion sites seen on T1WI and T2WI. 
Unchanged axial diffusivity, increased radial diffusivity, and reduced/unchanged 
fractional anisotropy were observed in regions distant from punctate white 
matter lesion sites.
CONCLUSIONS: White matter microstructural variations were different across 
punctate white matter lesion grades. Extensive change patterns varied according 
to the distance to the lesion sites in neonates with severe punctate white 
matter lesions. These findings may help in determining the outcomes of punctate 
white matter lesions and selecting treatment strategies.

OBJECTIVE: Improved diagnostic tools, timely closure of the shunt and a better 
understanding of the complexity of Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) have led to 
improved care and treatment in tertiary centres. These may have decreased the 
incidence of ES and improved survival of patients with ES, although evidence is 
still lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate temporal changes in 
incidence, prevalence and mortality in patients with ES for 35 years in the 
Nordic region.
METHODS: This was a retrospective population-based study including 714 patients 
with ES. Survival analysis was performed based on all-cause mortality and 
accounting for immortal time bias.
RESULTS: The incidence of ES decreased from 2.5/million inhabitants/year in 1977 
to 0.2/million inhabitants/year in 2012. Correspondingly, prevalence decreased 
from 24.6 to 11.9/million inhabitants. The median survival was 38.4 years, with 
20-year, 40-year and 60-year survival of 72.5%, 48.4%, and 21.3%, respectively. 
Complex lesions and Down syndrome were independently associated with worse 
survival (HR 2.2, p<0.001 and HR 1.8, p<0.001, respectively). Age at death 
increased from 27.7 years in the period from 1977 to 1992, to 46.3 years from 
July 2006 to 2012 (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence of ES in the Nordic region have 
decreased markedly during the last decades. Furthermore, the median age at death 
increased throughout the study period, indicating prolonged life expectancy in 
the ES population. However, increasing age represents decreased incidence, 
rather than improved survival. Nonetheless, longevity with ES is still shorter 
than in the background population.

AIMS: Standardization of stem cell therapy requires application of appropriate 
methods to evaluate safety and efficacy, including long-term pharmacovigilance. 
To accomplish this objective, a long-term registry programme was installed.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed 150 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, who 
received intramyocardial CD133+ bone marrow mononuclear stem cell treatment 
combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or CABG alone. The 
mortality rate, major adverse cerebral and cardiac events, and functional 
outcome parameters were evaluated for the time period up to 14 years follow-up. 
As a result, we have stratified the patient population (96 patients) into 
responders and non-responders. Furthermore, the analysis of relevant predictors 
of good response to CD133+ bone marrow mononuclear stem cell treatment was 
performed. Several positive tendencies related to stem cells transplantation 
were demonstrated. First, no significant difference in major adverse 
cardiovascular and cerebral events was observed between stem cell and control 
group up to 14 years follow-up. Second, an improvement of left ventricle 
ejection fraction (LVEF) in stem cell group retained for 5 years in contrast 
with CABG-only group, where no significant changes in LVEF after 2 years were 
observed. In addition, LVEF under 30% and left ventricle end diastolic diameter 
above 60 mm were independent predictors of functional response to CD133+ cell 
therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants with overt heart failure benefit most from CABG 
combined with intramyocardial injection of CD133+ bone marrow mononuclear cell 
within the group. An improvement LVEF in stem cell group remained for 5 years in 
contrast with the CABG-only group. The patients, in whom the improvement of both 
LVEF and LVED was observed, have benefited by increased life expectancy.

Knee extension strength (KES) improves following body mass-based lower body 
exercise training; however, it is unknown whether this type of exercise 
increases handgrip strength (HGS) as a result of a cross-education effect in 
older individuals. Our aim was to investigate the effect of a body mass-based 
exercise intervention on HGS and KES in older adults. At baseline, 166 subjects 
started a 12-week intervention program, and 160 (108 women and 52 men) subjects 
completed the study. A self-selected group of 37 older adults (21 women and 16 
men) served as a control group. HGS, KES, and ultrasound-derived anterior thigh 
muscle thickness (anterior thigh MT) were measured at baseline and post-testing, 
and relative strength of the knee extensor (KES/anterior thigh MT) was 
calculated. A linear regression model controlling for baseline values of 
body-mass index, % body fat, fat-free mass, HGS, chair stand time, anterior 
thigh MT, and KES/body mass ratio found a significant difference between control 
and training groups for KES post-testing values (p = 0.001) and anterior thigh 
MT post-testing values (p = 0.012), but not for HGS post-testing values 
(p = 0.287). Our results suggest that increases in lower body strength and 
muscle size following a 12-week lower body mass-based exercise intervention fail 
to translate into improvements in HGS.

BACKGROUND: Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstructions are rarely 
performed compared with that for the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).
PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical and functional outcome after isolated or 
multiligament PCL reconstruction.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: Patients who underwent PCL reconstruction between 2002 and 2010 were 
included. Standardized follow-up was performed between 2012 and 2013 and 
consisted of subjective scores (Tegner activity score, Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], and subjective International Knee 
Documentation Committee [IKDC] score) and objective measures, including knee 
laxity (KT-1000), extension strength, and overall IKDC score.
RESULTS: One hundred ninety-six patients were identified, of which 172 were 
available for postoperative follow-up: 39.3% with isolated PCL and 60.7% with 
multiligament injury. One hundred ten patients were available to complete both 
clinical follow-up and subjective questionnaires; 62 patients returned the 
subjective questionnaires. Mean follow-up was 5.9 years (range, 3.1-9.7 years). 
KOOS scores at follow-up in the isolated PCL group by subscale were 74 
(symptoms), 76 (pain), 80 (activities of daily living), 55 (sport), and 55 
(quality of life). Scores for patients in the multiligament group were 73 
(symptoms), 79 (pain), 82 (activities of daily living), 53 (sport), and 56 
(quality of life). Tegner scores were 4.5 and 4.4, respectively, and subjective 
IKDC scores were 63.8 and 65.0. The mean side-to-side difference in knee laxity 
was 2.7 mm in the isolated PCL group compared with 2.8 mm in the multiligament 
group. At 1-year follow-up there were significant differences in KOOS outcome 
scores between the isolated PCL subgroup and the multiligament subgroup, but no 
differences at final follow-up. Twelve patients (5%) had PCL revision surgery 
within the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: Despite the type of injury, there were only minor differences in 
knee laxity and subjective outcome scores between the isolated PCL group and the 
multiligament group. The overall revision rate in this study was 5.2%.

The purposes of this study are to determine and compare efficacy of laser 
acupuncture versus reflexology in elderly with rheumatoid arthritis. Thirty 
elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged between 60 and 70 years were 
classified into two groups, 15 patients each. Group A received laser acupuncture 
therapy (904 nm, beam area of 1cm2, power 100 mW, power density 100 mW/cm2, 
energy dosage 4 J, energy density 4 J/cm2, irradiation time 40 s, and frequency 
100,000 Hz). The acupuncture points that were exposed to laser radiation are 
LR3, ST25, ST36, SI3, SI4, LI4, LI11, SP6, SP9, GB25, GB34, and HT7. While group 
B received reflexology therapy, both offered 12 sessions over 4 weeks. The 
changes in RAQoL, HAQ, IL-6, MDA, ATP, and ROM at wrist and ankle joints were 
measured at the beginning and end of treatment. There was significant decrease 
in RAQoL, HAQ, IL-6, and MDA pre/posttreatment for both groups (p < 0.05); 
significant increase in ATP pre/posttreatment for both groups (p < 0.05); 
significant increase in ankle dorsi-flexion, plantar-flexion, wrist flexion, 
extension, and ulnar deviation ROM pre/posttreatment in group A (p < 0.05); and 
significant increase in ankle dorsi-flexion and ankle plantar-flexion ROM 
pre/posttreatment in group B (p < 0.05). Comparison between both groups showed a 
statistical significant decrease in MDA and a statistical significant increase 
in ATP in group A than group B. Percent of changes in MDA was 41.82%↓ in group A 
versus 21.68%↓ in group B; changes in ATP was 226.97%↑ in group A versus 67.02%↑ 
in group B. Moreover, there was a statistical significant increase in ankle 
dorsi-flexion, ankle plantar-flexion, wrist flexion, wrist extension, and radial 
deviation in group A than group B. Laser therapy is associated with significant 
improvement in MDA and ATP greater than reflexology. In addition, it is 
associated with significant improvement in ankle dorsi-flexion, ankle 
plantar-flexion, wrist flexion, wrist extension, and radial deviation greater 
than reflexology in elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

This study is to evaluate the impact of cooperation between acute care hospital 
and rehabilitation hospital on physical function, exercise tolerance, activities 
of daily living (ADL), health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), and 
psychological function in heart disease patients undergoing cardiac 
rehabilitation. Among patients undergoing concurrent medical treatment and 
cardiac rehabilitation starting early in acute care hospitalization, we selected 
30 patients who required continued cardiac rehabilitation in rehabilitation 
hospitals as subjects. At the time of admission and discharge from the 
rehabilitation hospital, we measured and compared physical function [grip 
strength, knee extension strength, and the short physical performance battery 
(SPPB)], ADL ability using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), exercise 
tolerance [six-minute walking distance (6MD)], and psychological functions such 
as the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). The average age of the 
subjects was 76.8 years and 60% were women. In 70% of cases, musculoskeletal 
causes were the reasons for continued cardiac rehabilitation in a rehabilitation 
hospital. In evaluations before and after hospitalization, significant 
improvements were observed in knee extension strength and the results of the 
SPPB (p < 0.01), FIM, and 6MD (p < 0.01). In SF-36, significant improvements 
were observed in physical function, role functioning, vitality, and emotional 
functioning (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). With intensive cardiac rehabilitation in 
rehabilitation hospitals, physical function, ADL, exercise tolerance, and HR-QOL 
improved significantly. As the severity and prevalence of heart disease are 
expected to increase in association with multiple disabilities and aging, the 
importance of cooperation between acute care hospitals and rehabilitation 
hospitals will increase; therefore, cardiac rehabilitation should be the basis 
for such cooperation.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Obesity and its associated metabolic diseases have reached 
epidemic proportions worldwide, reducing life expectancy and quality of life. 
Several drugs have been tested to treat these diseases but many of them have 
damaging side effects. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop more 
effective therapies. Recently, endocrine fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have 
become attractive targets in the treatment of metabolic diseases. This review 
summarizes their most important functions as well as FGF-based therapies for the 
treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D).
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies demonstrate that circulating levels of FGF19 are 
reduced in obesity. In fact, exogenous FGF19 administration is associated with a 
reduction in food intake as well as with improvements in glycaemia. In contrast, 
FGF21 levels are elevated in subjects with abdominal obesity, insulin resistance 
and T2D, probably representing a compensatory response. Additionally, elevated 
levels of circulating FGF23 in individuals with obesity and T2D are reported in 
most clinical studies. Finally, increased FGF1 levels in obese patients 
associated with adipogenesis have been described. FGFs constitute important 
molecules in the treatment of metabolic diseases due to their beneficial effects 
on glucose and lipid metabolism. Among all members, FGF19 and FGF21 have 
demonstrated the ability to improve glucose, lipid and energy homeostasis, along 
with FGF1, which was recently discovered to have beneficial effects on metabolic 
homeostasis. Additionally, FGF23 may also play a role in insulin resistance or 
energy homeostasis beyond mineral metabolism control. These results highlight 
the relevant use of FGFs as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of 
metabolic diseases. In this regard, notable progress has been made in the 
development of FGF-based therapies and different approaches are being tested in 
different clinical trials. However, further studies are needed to determine 
their potential therapeutic use in the treatment of obesity and obesity-related 
comorbidities.

OBJECTIVE Previous Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (HCRN) retrospective 
studies have shown a 15% difference in rates of conversion to permanent shunts 
with the use of ventriculosubgaleal shunts (VSGSs) versus ventricular reservoirs 
(VRs) as temporization procedures in the treatment of hydrocephalus due to 
high-grade intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) of prematurity. Further research in 
the same study line revealed a strong influence of center-specific 
decision-making on shunt outcomes. The primary goal of this prospective study 
was to standardize decision-making across centers to determine true procedural 
superiority, if any, of VSGS versus VR as a temporization procedure in 
high-grade IVH of prematurity. METHODS The HCRN conducted a prospective cohort 
study across 6 centers with an approximate 1.5- to 3-year accrual period 
(depending on center) followed by 6 months of follow-up. Infants with premature 
birth, who weighed less than 1500 g, had Grade 3 or 4 IVH of prematurity, and 
had more than 72 hours of life expectancy were included in the study. Based on a 
priori consensus, decisions were standardized regarding the timing of initial 
surgical treatment, upfront shunt versus temporization procedure (VR or VSGS), 
and when to convert a VR or VSGS to a permanent shunt. Physical examination 
assessment and surgical technique were also standardized. The primary outcome 
was the proportion of infants who underwent conversion to a permanent shunt. The 
major secondary outcomes of interest included infection and other complication 
rates. RESULTS One hundred forty-five premature infants were enrolled and met 
criteria for analysis. Using the standardized decision rubrics, 28 infants never 
reached the threshold for treatment, 11 initially received permanent shunts, 4 
were initially treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), and 102 
underwent a temporization procedure (36 with VSGSs and 66 with VRs). The 2 
temporization cohorts were similar in terms of sex, race, IVH grade, head 
(orbitofrontal) circumference, and ventricular size at temporization. There were 
statistically significant differences noted between groups in gestational age, 
birth weight, and bilaterality of clot burden that were controlled for in post 
hoc analysis. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 180-day rates of conversion to 
permanent shunts were 63.5% for VSGS and 74.0% for VR (p = 0.36, log-rank test). 
The infection rate for VSGS was 14% (5/36) and for VR was 17% (11/66; p = 0.71). 
The overall compliance rate with the standardized decision rubrics was noted to 
be 90% for all surgeons. CONCLUSIONS A standardized protocol was instituted 
across all centers of the HCRN. Compliance was high. Choice of temporization 
techniques in premature infants with IVH does not appear to influence rates of 
conversion to permanent ventricular CSF diversion. Once management decisions and 
surgical techniques are standardized across HCRN sites, thus minimizing center 
effect, the observed difference in conversion rates between VSGSs and VRs is 
mitigated.

Objective To test the hypothesis that DALYs, estimated individually for each 
patient with acute ischemic stroke upon hospital discharge, without reperfusion 
therapy, are not different between the different subtypes of ischemic stroke. 
Patients and Methods In the Hospital Universitario de la Samaritana in Bogotá, 
the health records of patients diagnosed with their first acute ischemic stroke 
event from admission and monitoring to discharge were selected. The subtype of 
acute ischemic stroke was classified according to the criteria established by 
the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST). DALYs were estimated 
for each patient with acute ischemic stroke at hospital discharge. To establish 
differences of DALYs among the five acute ischemic stroke subtypes (TOAST), the 
Kruskal Wallis test was used. Results Of the 39 cases of acute ischemic stroke, 
17 (43.6 %) were classified as artherosclerosis, 10 (25.6 %) as lacunar events, 
6 (15.4 %) as cardioembolic attacks, and another 6 (15.4 %) cases with unclear 
etiology. At hospital discharge, the estimated total DALYs provided by patients 
with acute ischemic stroke was 316.9 years, without statistically significant 
differences between the subtypes of ischemic stroke. At hospital discharge, the 
average of optimal years free of disability lost by a patient surviving an acute 
ischemic stroke was 8.12. Conclusion Non conclusive results are attributed to 
the concurrence of dissimilar acute clinical care processes and to the risk 
factors distributions, comorbidities and patient complications.

Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.

OBJECTIVE: Focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) is a useful tool in evaluating 
patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute dyspnea. Prior 
work has shown that right ventricular (RV) dilation is associated with repeat 
hospitalizations and shorter life expectancy. Traditionally, RV assessment has 
been evaluated by cardiologist-interpreted comprehensive echocardiography. The 
primary goal of this study was to determine the inter-rater reliability between 
emergency physicians (EPs) and a cardiologist for determining RV dilation on 
FOCUS performed on ED patients with acute dyspnea.
METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study at two urban academic EDs; 
patients were enrolled if they had acute dyspnea and a computed tomographic 
pulmonary angiogram without acute disease. All patients had an EP-performed 
FOCUS to assess for RV dilation. RV dilation was defined as an RV to left 
ventricular ratio greater than 1. FOCUS interpretations were compared to a 
blinded cardiologist FOCUS interpretation using agreement and kappa statistics.
RESULTS: Of 84 FOCUS examinations performed on 83 patients, 17% had RV dilation. 
Agreement and kappa, for EP-performed FOCUS for RV dilation were 89% (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 80-95%) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.48-0.88), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Emergency physician sonographers are able to detect RV dilation 
with good agreement when compared to cardiology. These results support the wider 
use of EP-performed FOCUS to evaluate for RV dilation in ED patients with 
dyspnea.

BACKGROUND: A challenge in the empiric treatment of complicated urinary tract 
infection (cUTI) is identifying the initial appropriate antibiotic therapy 
(IAAT), which is associated with reduced length of stay and mortality compared 
with initial inappropriate antibiotic therapy (IIAT). We evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam compared with 
piperacillin/tazobactam (one of the standard of care antibiotics), for the 
treatment of hospitalized patients with cUTI.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to 
compare the costs and effectiveness of empiric treatment with either 
ceftolozane/tazobactam or piperacillin/tazobactam in hospitalized adult patients 
with cUTI infected with Gram-negative pathogens in the US. The model applies the 
baseline prevalence of resistance as reported by national in-vitro surveillance 
data.
RESULTS: In a cohort of 1000 patients, treatment with ceftolozane/tazobactam 
resulted in higher total costs compared with piperacillin/tazobactam ($36,413 
/patient vs. $36,028/patient, respectively), greater quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) (9.19/patient vs. 9.13/patient, respectively) and an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $6128/QALY. Ceftolozane/tazobactam remained 
cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $100,000 per QALY compared to 
piperacillin/tazobactam over a range of input parameter values during one-way 
and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Model results show that ceftolozane/tazobactam is likely to be 
cost-effective compared with piperacillin/tazobactam for the empiric treatment 
of hospitalized cUTI patients in the United States.

In current scenario, crop productivity is being challenged by decreasing soil 
fertility. To cope up with this problem, different beneficial microbes are 
explored to increase the crop productivity with value additions. In this study, 
Brassica napus L., an important agricultural economic oilseed crop with rich 
source of nutritive qualities, was interacted with Piriformospora indica, a 
unique root colonizing fungus with wide host range and multifunctional aspects. 
The fungus-treated plants showed a significant increase in agronomic parameters 
with plant biomass, lodging-resistance, early bolting and flowering, oil yield 
and quality. Nutritional analysis revealed that plants treated by P. indica had 
reduced erucic acid and glucosinolates contents, and increased the accumulation 
of N, Ca, Mg, P, K, S, B, Fe and Zn elements. Low erucic acid and glucosinolates 
contents are important parameters for high quality oil, because oils high in 
erucic acid and glucosinolates are considered undesirable for human nutrition. 
Furthermore, the expression profiles of two encoding enzyme genes, Bn-FAE1 and 
BnECR, which are responsible for regulating erucic acid biosynthesis, were 
down-regulated at mid- and late- life stages during seeds development in 
colonized plants. These results demonstrated that P. indica played an important 
role in enhancing plant growth, rapeseed yield and quality improvement of B. 
napus.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of treatment 
complications on outcomes in adult spinal deformity (ASD) using a decision 
analysis (DA) model.
METHODS: The study included 535 ASD patients (371 with non-surgical (NS) and 164 
with surgical (S) treatment) from an international multicentre database of ASD 
patients. DA was structured in two main steps; 1) Baseline analysis (Assessing 
the probabilities of outcomes, Assessing the values of preference -utilities-, 
Combining information on probability and utility and assigning the quality 
adjusted life expectancy (QALE) for each treatment) and 2) Sensitivity analysis. 
Complications were analyzed as life threatening (LT) and nonlife threatening 
(NLT) and their probabilities were calculated from the database as well as a 
thorough literature review. Outcomes were analyzed as improvement, no change and 
deterioration. Death/complete paralysis was considered as a separate category.
RESULTS: All 535 patients were analyzed in regard to complications. Overall, 
there were 78 NLT and 12 LT complications and 3 death/paralysis. Surgical 
treatment offered significantly higher chances of clinical improvement but also 
was significantly more prone to complications (31.7% vs. 11.1%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of ASD is more likely to cause complications 
compared to NS treatment. On the other hand, surgery has been shown to provide a 
higher likelihood of improvement in HRQoL scores. So, the decision on the type 
of treatment in ASD needs to take both chances of improvement and burden 
associated with S or NS treatments and better be arrived by the active 
participation of patients and physicians equipped with the present information.

OBJECTIVE: To assess physicians' attitudes regarding multiple factors that may 
influence recommendations for active surveillance (AS) vs active treatment (AT) 
given the central role physicians play in the treatment decision-making process.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews to assess factors 
that physicians consider important when recommending AS vs AT, as well as 
physicians' perceptions of what their patients consider important in the 
decision. Participants included urologists (N = 11), radiation oncologists 
(N = 12), and primary care physicians (N = 10) from both integrated and 
fee-for-service healthcare settings.
RESULTS: Across the specialties, quantitative data indicated that most 
physicians reported that their recommendations for AS were influenced by 
patients' older age, willingness and ability to follow a surveillance protocol, 
anxiety, comorbidities, life expectancy, and treatment preferences. Qualitative 
findings highlighted physicians' concerns about malpractice lawsuits, given the 
possibility of disease progression. Additionally, most physicians noted the role 
of the healthcare setting, suggesting that financial incentives may be 
associated with AT recommendations in fee-for-service settings. Finally, most 
physicians reported spouse or family opposition to AS due to their own anxiety 
or lack of understanding of AS.
CONCLUSION: We found that patient and physician preferences, healthcare setting, 
and family or spouse factors influence physicians' treatment recommendations for 
men with low-risk PCa. These were consistent themes across physician 
subspecialties in both an Health Maintenance Organization and in fee-for-service 
settings.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the patient lifetime benefits gained from reduced delays 
in endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke.
METHODS: We used observational prospective data of consecutive stroke patients 
treated with IV thrombolysis in Helsinki (1998-2014; n = 2,474) to describe 
distributions of age, sex, stroke severity, onset-to-treatment times, and 
3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) in routine clinical practice. We used 
treatment effects by time of endovascular therapy in large vessel occlusion over 
and above thrombolysis as reported by the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial 
of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR 
CLEAN) study to model the shift in 3-month mRS distributions with reducing 
treatment delays. From the 3-month outcomes we derived patient-expected 
lifetimes and cumulative long-term disability with incremental treatment delay 
reductions.
RESULTS: Each minute saved in onset-to-treatment time granted on average 4.2 
days of extra healthy life, with a 95% prediction interval 2.3-5.4. Women gained 
slightly more than men due to their longer life expectancies. Patients younger 
than 55 years with severe strokes of NIH Stroke Scale score above 10 gained more 
than a week per each minute saved. In the whole cohort, every 20 minutes 
decrease in treatment delays led to a gain of average equivalent of 3 months of 
disability-free life.
CONCLUSIONS: Small reductions in endovascular delays lead to marked health 
benefits over patients' lifetimes. Services need to be optimized to reduce 
delays to endovascular therapy.

Compared to the general population, adults with serious mental illnesses have 
elevated rates of medical morbidity resulting in a reduced life expectancy of 
approximately 15 years. Chronic disease self-management programs for adults with 
serious mental and chronic medical illnesses show some promise in improving 
physical health-related outcomes, yet none of them address sleep quality. Poor 
sleep affects a majority of adults with serious mental illness and is robust 
risk factor for physical morbidity and premature mortality. This pilot project 
examined the impact of a 14-week educational and support group that included 
sleep quality as a cornerstone in promoting wellness and self-management in 78 
adults with serious mental illness and poor health. Results provide preliminary 
data that the self-management program was associated with significant 
improvements in self-reported sleep quality at post-intervention. At 3-month 
follow-up, participants reported additional increases in sleep quality as well 
as in healthy diet and exercise frequency. Addressing sleep quality as part of 
self-management and wellness programs may be a viable approach to assist adults 
with chronic mental and physical illnesses to adopt health-promoting changes.

Bacterial ribonuclease E (RNase E) plays a crucial role in the processing and 
decay of RNAs. A small protein named RraA negatively regulates the activity of 
RNase E via protein-protein interaction in various bacteria. Recently, RraAS1 
and RraAS2, which are functional homologs of RraA from Escherichia coli, were 
identified in the Gram-positive species Streptomyces coelicolor. RraAS1 and 
RraAS2 inhibit RNase ES ribonuclease activity in S. coelicolor. RraAS1 and 
RraAS2 have a C-terminal extension region unlike typical bacterial RraA 
proteins. In this study, we present the crystal structure of RraAS2, exhibiting 
a hexamer arranged in a dimer of trimers, consistent with size exclusion 
chromatographic results. Importantly, the C-terminal extension region formed a 
long α-helix at the junction of the neighboring subunit, which is similar to the 
trimeric RraA orthologs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Truncation of the 
C-terminal extension region resulted in loss of RNase ES inhibition, 
demonstrating its crucial role. Our findings present the first bacterial RraA 
that has a hexameric assembly with a C-terminal extension α-helical region, 
which plays an essential role in the regulation of RNase ES activity in S. 
coelicolor.

The option of daily hemodialysis (HD) was discussed in November 1998 with a 
group of 35 HD patients on home or self-care/limited-care HD in a single, 
freestanding unit. After the meeting, 3 patients on home HD chose to switch to 
daily HD. The clinical success of the first patient and the immediate followers 
was one of the main reasons for further extension of this experience. At the 
time of this writing (February 2000), 10 patients were on a daily HD program (8 
at home and 2 in a self-care/limited-care center) and one was in training for 
home daily HD. One further patient who tried 1 month of daily HD dropped out for 
logistic reasons. On daily HD, patients are dialyzed 2 - 3 hours/day, 6 days/ 
week, with blood flow of 270 - 300 mL/min, on bicarbonate dialysate with 
individually determined levels of Na and K. The schedule is flexible and a 
switch to 3 - 4 dialyses/week is occasionally allowed for working needs or for 
vacation. In addition to the well-known clinical advantages (better well-being, 
blood pressure control, nutrition, etc.), some patients preferred daily HD 
because of easier organization of daily activities, including work schedule. 
Patients initially feared frequent needle punctures and excessive burden on
