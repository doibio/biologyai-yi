Human livelihood highly depends on applying different sources of energy whose 
utilization is associated with air pollution. On the other hand, air pollution 
may be associated with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Unlike other 
environmental causes of cancer (e.g., irradiation), air pollution cannot 
efficiently be controlled by geographical borders, regulations, and policies. 
The unavoidable exposure to air pollution can modify cancer incidence and 
mortality. GBM treatment with chemotherapy or even its surgical removal has 
proven insufficient (100% recurrence rate; patient's survival mean of 15 months; 
90% fatality within five years) due to glioma infiltrative and migratory 
capacities. Given the barrage of attention and research investments currently 
plowed into next-generation cancer therapy, oncolytic viruses are perhaps the 
most vigorously pursued. Provision of an insight into the current state of the 
research and future direction is essential for stimulating new ideas with the 
potentials of filling research gaps. This review manuscript aims to overview 
types of brain cancer, their burden, and different causative agents. It also 
describes why air pollution is becoming a concerning factor. The different 
opinions on the association of air pollution with brain cancer are reviewed. It 
tries to address the significant controversy in this field by hypothesizing the 
air-pollution-brain-cancer association via inflammation and atopic conditions. 
The last section of this review deals with the oncolytic viruses, which have 
been used in, or are still under clinical trials for GBM treatment. Engineered 
adenoviruses (i.e., DNX-2401, DNX-2440, CRAd8-S-pk7 loaded Neural stem cells), 
herpes simplex virus type 1 (i.e., HSV-1 C134, HSV-1 rQNestin34.5v.2, HSV-1 
G207, HSV-1 M032), measles virus (i.e., MV-CEA), parvovirus (i.e., ParvOryx), 
poliovirus (i.e., Poliovirus PVSRIPO), reovirus (i.e., pelareorep), moloney 
murine leukemia virus (i.e., Toca 511 vector), and vaccinia virus (i.e., 
vaccinia virus TG6002) as possible life-changing alleviations for GBM have been 
discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first review that 
comprehensively discusses both (i) the negative/positive association of air 
pollution with GBM; and (ii) the application of oncolytic viruses for GBM, 
including the most recent advances and clinical trials. It is also the first 
review that addresses the controversies over air pollution and brain cancer 
association. We believe that the article will significantly appeal to a broad 
readership of virologists, oncologists, neurologists, environmentalists, and 
those who work in the field of (bio)energy. Policymakers may also use it to 
establish better health policies and regulations about air pollution and 
(bio)fuels exploration, production, and consumption.

Despite major developments in the therapy of advanced prostate cancer over the 
past decade, there was still an unmet medical need for efficacious and safe 
therapies suitable for a wide patient population of patients with metastatic 
hormone-sensitive disease.Since its label extension for the treatment of 
metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) at the beginning of 2020, 
apalutamide in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has filled 
this gap 1. The novel androgen receptor inhibitor showed good efficacy and 
safety in comparison with placebo in the pivotal study TITAN while maintaining 
quality of life - the study included patients irrespective of risk, disease 
volume, or time of diagnosis 2.

Publisher: Trotz umfassender Entwicklungen in der Therapie des fortgeschrittenen 
Prostatakarzinoms im letzten Jahrzehnt, bestand bei Patienten mit metastasierter 
hormonsensitiver Erkrankung weiterhin ein Bedarf an gut wirksamen und zugleich 
gut verträglichen Therapien, die bei einer breiten Patientenpopulation zum 
Einsatz kommen können.Seit Anfang 2020 wird nach entsprechender 
Zulassungserweiterung die Lücke beim metastasierten hormonsensitiven 
Prostatakarzinom (mHSPC) durch Apalutamid in Kombination mit einer 
Androgendeprivationstherapie (ADT) geschlossen 1. Der moderne 
Androgenrezeptor-Inhibitor zeigte in der Zulassungsstudie TITAN, in der 
mHSPC-Patienten unabhängig von Risiko, Metastasenlast oder Diagnosezeitpunkt 
einschlossen wurden, gegenüber Placebo plus ADT eine gute Wirksamkeit und 
Verträglichkeit, bei gleichzeitig guter Lebensqualität 2.

BACKGROUND: Propionic acidemia (PA), an inborn error of metabolism, is caused by 
a deficiency in propionyl-CoA carboxylase. Patients have to follow a diet 
restricted in the propiogenic amino acids isoleucine (Ile), valine (Val), 
methionine (Met) and threonine (Thr); proper adherence can prevent and treat 
acute decompensation and increase life expectancy. However, chronic 
complications occur in several organs even though metabolic control may be 
largely maintained. Bone marrow aplasia and anemia are among the more common.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, data for patients with PA 
being monitored at the Hospital Ramón y Cajal (Madrid, Spain) (n = 10) in the 
past 10 years were examined to statistically detect relationships between 
persistent severe anemia outside of metabolic decompensation episodes and 
dietary practices such as natural protein intake and medical food consumption 
(special mixture of precursor-free amino acids) along with plasma levels of 
branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). High ferritin levels were deemed to indicate 
that a patient had received repeated transfusions for persistent anemia since 
data on hemoglobin levels at the moment of transfusion were not always passed on 
by the attending centers.
RESULTS: Three patients had severe, persistent anemia that required repeated 
blood transfusions. Higher medical food consumption and plasma Leu levels were 
associated with iron overload. Notably, natural protein intake and plasma Val 
were negatively correlated with ferritin levels. We also observed an inverse 
relationship between plasma Val/Leu and Ile/Leu ratios and ferritin.
CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that severe anemia in patients with PA 
might be associated with low natural protein intake and BCAA imbalance.

vladimir.canudas-romo@anu.edu.au.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect that particulate matter with a diameter of 
2.5 μg (PM2.5) had on mortality in Asian populations in years 2000-2015.
SETTING: Mortality and level of PM2.5 data from the United Nations, Global 
Burden of Disease and University of Chicago were used.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Age pattern of mortality and the number of life-years lost 
(LYL) attributable to PM2.5 in years 2000-2015. LYL were further separated into 
causes of death to quantify the contribution of each cause.
RESULTS: Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality increased to represent over 31% 
of the LYL attributable to PM2.5 between 2005-2010 and 2010-2015 in Asia 
(females 31% and males 35%). However, great diversity in LYL attributable to 
PM2.5 by causes-of-death were found across the region, with IHD proportions of 
LYL ranging from 25% to 63% for males from Eastern and Central Asia, 
respectively. Similar diversity was observed for mortality attributable to PM2.5 
for other causes of death across Asia: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(LYL ranging from 6% to 28%), lung cancer (4% to 20%) and stroke (11% to 22%).
CONCLUSION: PM2.5 is a crucial component in the rising health effects in Asia. 
The diverse trends in cause-specific mortality attributable to PM2.5 creates a 
further challenge for health systems in the region. These findings highlight 
that immediate interventions are needed to mitigate the increasing levels of air 
pollution and with that reduce its detrimental effect on the health and 
mortality of Asian populations.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to establish a set of disability weights (DWs) for COVID-19 
symptoms, evaluate the disease burden of inpatients and analyse the 
characteristics and influencing factors of the disease.
DESIGN: This was a multicentre retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study.
SETTING: The medical records generated in three temporary military hospitals in 
Wuhan.
PARTICIPANTS: Medical records of 2702 inpatients generated from 5 February to 5 
April 2020 were randomly selected for this study.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: DWs of COVID-19 symptoms were determined 
by the person trade-off approach. The inpatients' medical records were analysed 
and used to calculate the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The mean DALY 
was evaluated across sex and age groups. The relationship between DALY and age, 
sex, body mass index, length of hospital stay, symptom duration before admission 
and native place was determined by multiple linear regression.
RESULTS: For the DALY of each inpatient, severe expiratory dyspnoea, mild cough 
and sore throat had the highest (0.399) and lowest (0.004) weights, 
respectively. The average synthetic DALY and daily DALY were 2.29±1.33 and 
0.18±0.15 days, respectively. Fever and fatigue contributed the most DALY at 
31.36%, whereas nausea and vomiting and anxiety and depression contributed the 
least at 7.05%. There were significant differences between sex and age groups in 
both synthetic and daily DALY. Age, body mass index, length of hospital stay and 
symptom duration before admission were strongly related to both synthetic and 
daily DALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the disease burden was higher among women than men, their 
daily disease burdens were similar. The disease burden in the younger population 
was higher than that in the older population. Treatment at the hospitals 
relieved the disease burden efficiently, while a delay in hospitalisation 
worsened it.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate oncological and functional outcomes of index 
lesion HIFU ablation with Focal-One®.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively assessed treatment-naïve men with 
localized prostate cancer between 2017 and 2019. Inclusion criteria were stage 
cT ≤ 2, ≥5 years of life expectancy, grade group ≤3. Multiparametric magnetic 
resonance was performed before ablation. Patients with a prostate volume of 
≥80 ml underwent debulking. Treatment failure was defined as a histologically 
confirmed tumor that required salvage treatment or androgen deprivation therapy.
RESULTS: One hundred and eighty nine patients were enrolled. Data are presented 
as median and Interquartile Range (IQR). Median age was 70(11) years. Median 
baseline PSA was 5.8(3) ng/ml. Fourteen (7.4%) patients had prostate debulking 
before ablation. 104 (55%) patients underwent targeted ablation, 45 (23.8%) 
extended targeted ablation, 31 (16.4%) hemiablation, and 9 (4.8%) extended 
hemiablation. Median targeted ablated volume was 14(9) ml. Ninety-three 
complications occurred in 63/189 (33.3%) patients within 90 days. There were 
77/93 (82.8%) minor (Clavien grade 1-2) and 16/93 (17.2%) major complications 
(Clavien grade 3a). Thirty-nine patients suffered from genito-urinary infections 
(Clavien grade 2). Fifteen patients required transurethral resection of the 
prostate/urethrotomy for recurrent urinary retention (Clavien grade 3a). One 
patient developed a recto-urethral fistula (Clavien grade 3a) and two 
long-lasting urinary incontinence. Median PSA nadir was 2.2(2.9) ng/ml. At a 
median follow-up of 29(15) months, 21/177 (11.9%) patients were treatment 
failures, 26 on monitoring, and 26 had a further ablation. Multivariable 
logistic regression found that failure patients had higher PSA (7.8 vs 
5.7 ng/ml,p0.001) and double PSA nadir (4.8 vs 2.0 ng/ml, p < 0.001). Higher PSA 
nadir correlated with a 74% higher probability of failure (OR 1.74 95% CI 
1.40-2.16). Cancer in the anterior stroma increased the odds of failure of three 
folds (OR 3.36 95% CI 1.18-9.53). Two mixed effect models (one for IPSS and one 
for IEEF-15) were estimated and they showed that time reaches the statistical 
significance coefficient only for the IEEF-15, meaning that subsequent 
evaluations of the indicators were significantly lower at each time point.
CONCLUSIONS: Index lesion HIFU ablation demonstrated satisfactory early 
oncological outcome but anteriorly located tumors had inadequate ablation. 
Urinary function was well preserved. Sexual function slightly decreased during 
follow-up.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, and levodopa 
(L-dopa) remains the most efficacious drug treatment for PD and a gold-standard 
for symptom control. Nonetheless, a significant majority of PD patients develop 
motor fluctuations over their disease course, with a significant impact on 
quality-of-life, meaning control of such complications translates into a 
fundamental clinical need. Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors 
(COMT-i) are used as first-line adjuvant therapy to L-dopa for end-of-dose (EoD) 
motor fluctuations, since they increase L-dopa availability in the brain by 
inhibiting its peripheral metabolism. Opicapone (OPC), a once-daily, long-acting 
COMT-i, is the most recent and potent of its class, having been licensed in 
Europe in 2016 as an add-on to preparations of L-dopa/DOPA decarboxylase 
inhibitors in PD patients with EoD motor fluctuations. More recently, it has 
also received approval in the USA and Japan in 2020. Two high-quality positive 
efficacy studies (double-blind Phase III clinical trials) established OPC 
efficacy with significant reduction in OFF time (average 60 minutes vs placebo), 
without concomitant increase of distressing dyskinesias during ON time. These 
beneficial effects were sustained in open-label extension studies, without 
unexpected safety issues or adverse events, with dyskinesia having been the most 
frequent complaint. OPC also avoids liver toxicity and gastrointestinal issues 
compared with previous COMT-i. In this review, we aimed to cover OPC's lifecycle 
(synthesis to commercialization), its clinical pharmacological data, safety, 
tolerability and pharmacovigilance evidence, and discuss its role in the 
management of motor fluctuations in PD as well as its emerging place in 
international recommendations.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome among psychiatric patients in 
developing nations is mounting alarmingly and it is a reason for decreased life 
expectancy and quality of life of people with mental illness. Although great 
discrepant epidemiological studies have been carried out in Sub Saharan African 
countries, there has no systematic review and meta-analysis conducted. 
Therefore, summarized evidence has a paramount importance for policy makers and 
health planning. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of metabolic 
syndrome and to examine the effect of gender on metabolic syndrome among people 
with mental illness in sub Saharan Africa.
METHOD: Systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, CINAHL, Web of 
science, Global health electronic databases. In addition, gray literatures were 
retrieved from Google and Google scholar. Two authors independently extracted 
all the necessary data using a format prepared in Microsoft Excel. Data analysis 
was done using STATA Version 14 (software). The heterogeneity of the studies was 
assessed using I2test.Random-effects model was used to estimate pooled 
prevalence of MetS and its odds ratio. Publication bias was checked using Funnel 
plot and Egger's test.
RESULT: 1306 studies were reviewed and nine studies fulfilling the inclusion 
criteria were selected for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of nine studies 
that included 1896 participants found a prevalence rate of metabolic syndrome 
which was performed based on assessment criteria; JIS criteria prevalence 21.11% 
(95% CI: 17.93-24.29), IDF criteria 23.77% (95% CI: 15.41-32.12) and NCEP 
ATP-III criteria 21.63% (95% CI: 16.30-26.96). Female gender (AOR = 3.00; 95% 
CI: 1.98-4.55) was found to have a significant association with metabolic 
syndrome.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome among people with mental 
illness in sub Saharan Africa is high in various assessment criteria. The 
likelihood is significantly increased in females than males. Metabolic syndrome 
increases by three folds among females with mental illness as compared to their 
counterparts.

BACKGROUND: The aim is to report an atypical presentation of ocular 
toxoplasmosis which led to the diagnosis of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome 
(AIDS). Case Report. The 38-year-old woman was referred with metamorphopsia and 
reduced vision in the right eye over the past 3 weeks. Slit-lamp examination 
revealed granulomatous keratic precipitates (KPs), 2+ cells in the anterior 
chamber, and posterior synechiae. Fundus examination was remarkable for a white 
patch surrounding a scar, inferonasal to the optic disc with fibrous bands 
emanating from the lesion, and the retina around this region was detached with 
considerable extension towards the periphery, while no breaks could be 
appreciated. She mentioned anorexia and losing 10 kg in the past three months, 
and signs of anemia like paleness of face skin, bed nails, and bilateral angular 
cheilitis were observed on systemic evaluation. The results of the patient's 
complete blood count revealed anemia and leukopenia and CD4 lymphocytes: 79 
cells/μL. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for HIV antibodies came 
back positive which was later confirmed with the Western blot test. Brain 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple ring-enhancing lesions in both 
cerebral cortices. The patient underwent antitoxoplasmosis and anti-HIV 
treatment and serous retinal detachment completely resolved.
CONCLUSION: This report highlights the fact that sometimes, the eyes are the 
site of the first presentation of a systemic life-threatening condition and 
emphasizes the role of ophthalmologists in such cases. In cases of atypical 
presentation, appropriate laboratory tests and CNS imaging should be requested. 
Systemic treatment with antitoxoplasmosis regimens and highly active 
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is mandatory in AIDS patients with ocular 
toxoplasmosis.

CA, USA.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks among the leading cancer-related causes of 
morbidity and mortality worldwide. Downstaging of HCC has prevailed as a key 
method to curative therapy for patients who present with unresectable HCC 
outside of the listing criteria for liver transplantation (LT). Even though LT 
paves the way to lifesaving curative therapy for HCC, perpetually severe organ 
shortage limits its broader application. Debate over the optimal protocol and 
assessment of response to downstaging treatment has fueled immense research 
activity and is pushing the boundaries of LT candidate selection criteria. The 
implicit obligation of refining downstaging protocol is to ensure the 
maximization of the transplant survival benefit by taking into account the 
waitlist life expectancy. In the following review, we critically discuss 
strategies to best optimize downstaging HCC to LT on the basis of existing 
literature.

INTRODUCTION: World Health Organization recommends rotavirus vaccine for all 
national immunization programs (NIPs). To provide country-specific evidence, we 
conducted economic evaluation of a monovalent rotavirus vaccination using 
specific data of the pilot phase in Thailand.
METHOD: A Markov model was adopted to compare the 2020 birth cohort once 
receiving rotavirus vaccination versus no vaccination from healthcare and 
societal perspective over five years. Data on disease burden, vaccine 
effectiveness, costs, and utilities were taken from a cohort study in two 
provinces of Thailand.  Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the 
robustness of the results.
RESULTS: Rotavirus vaccination would reduce rotavirus diarrhea and costs of 
illness by 48% and 71%, respectively, over the first five years of life. At USD 
13 per dose, vaccine was cost-effective with the ICERs of USD 4,114 and USD 
1,571per QALY gained from healthcare and societal perspective, respectively. 
Results were sensitive to incidence and vaccine cost.  The budget for vaccine 
purchasing was estimated at USD13 million per year.
CONCLUSION: Incorporating rotavirus vaccination into the NIP substantially 
reduced health and cost outcomes and was cost-effective for both perspectives. 
However, the government needs to negotiate vaccine price prior to program 
implementation to achieve favorable budget impact.

A Bayesian Framework for Patient-Level Partitioned Survival Cost-Utility 
Analysis.

Gabrio A(1).

Patient-level health economic data collected alongside clinical trials are an 
important component of the process of technology appraisal. For end-of-life 
treatments, the modeling of cost-effectiveness data may involve some form of 
partitioned survival analysis, in which measures of quality of life and survival 
for pre- and postprogression periods are combined to generate aggregate measures 
of clinical benefits (e.g., quality-adjusted survival). In addition, resource 
use data are often collected and costs are calculated for each type of health 
service (e.g., treatment, hospital, or adverse events costs). A critical problem 
in these analyses is that effectiveness and cost data present some complexities, 
such as nonnormality, spikes, and missingness, which should be addressed using 
appropriate methods to avoid biased results. This article proposes a general 
Bayesian framework that takes into account the complexities of trial-based 
partitioned survival cost-utility data to provide more adequate evidence for 
policy makers. Our approach is motivated by, and applied to, a working example 
based on data from a trial assessing the cost-effectiveness of a new treatment 
for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.[Box: see text].

AIMS: To determine the (cost)-effectiveness of blood pressure lowering, 
lipid-lowering, and antithrombotic therapy guided by predicted lifetime benefit 
compared to risk factor levels in patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic 
disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: For all patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease 
in the UCC-SMART cohort (1996-2018; n = 7697) two treatment strategies were 
compared. The lifetime benefit-guided strategy was based on individual 
estimation of gain in cardiovascular disease (CVD)-free life with the 
SMART-REACH model. In the risk factor-based strategy, all patients were treated 
the following: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) < 1.8 mmol/L, 
systolic blood pressure <140 mmHg, and antithrombotic medication. Outcomes were 
evaluated for the total cohort using a microsimulation model. Effectiveness was 
evaluated as total gain in CVD-free life and events avoided, cost-effectiveness 
as incremental cost-effectivity ratio (ICER). In comparison to baseline 
treatment, treatment according to lifetime benefit would lead to an increase of 
24 243 CVD-free life years [95% confidence interval (CI) 19 980-29 909] and 
would avoid 940 (95% CI 742-1140) events in the next 10 years. For risk-factor 
based treatment, this would be an increase of 18 564 CVD-free life years (95% CI 
14 225-20 456) and decrease of 857 (95% CI 661-1057) events. The ICER of 
lifetime benefit-based treatment with a treatment threshold of ≥1 year 
additional CVD-free life per therapy was €15 092/QALY gained and of risk 
factor-based treatment €9933/QALY gained. In a direct comparison, lifetime 
benefit-based treatment compared to risk factor-based treatment results in 1871 
additional QALYs for the price of €36 538/QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Residual risk reduction guided by lifetime benefit estimation 
results in more CVD-free life years and more CVD events avoided compared to the 
conventional risk factor-based strategy. Lifetime benefit-based treatment is an 
effective and potentially cost-effective strategy for reducing residual CVD risk 
in patients with clinical manifest vascular disease.

Changes in mortality disparities by education in Russia from 1998 to 2017: 
evidence from indirect estimation.

This article addresses two unresolved methodological issues related to prior 
research on Russia that was based on census-unlinked data and did not account 
for the substantial increase in the share of death records with missing 
information on education. The study uses a proportional mortality analysis 
method relying on a case-control framework, together with a plausible 
imputation-based solution for the redistribution of the unknown education on 
death records. The new results suggest that high levels of inequality persist, 
but they do not support recent findings indicating that the educational gap in 
life expectancy has substantially widened.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the lung cancer burden and related risk factors in groups 
of different sex, ages and levels of sociodemographic index (SDI) at global, 
regional and national levels.
METHODS: Using newly released GBD 2019 data, we explored the trends of lung 
cancer burden and its related risk factors in groups of different sex, ages and 
levels of SDI at global, regional and national levels. The Global Health Data 
Exchange query tool was used to obtain the data.
RESULTS: While lung cancer has an overall stable age-standardized incidence rate 
(ASIR), the death rate (ASDR) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) rate 
(with even a trend of decline), it is still the number one malignant tumor. The 
ASIR and ASDR grew slowly in women worldwide. In 2019, High-income North 
America, East Asia and Central Europe ranked top three in ASIR, ASDR and 
age-standardized DALY rate, with growth in East Asia the highest. These three 
indicators were not in a single linear relation with SDI at a national level, 
and a peak appeared when SDI was about 0.8. The top three attributable risk 
factors to DALYs were smoking, particulate matter pollution and occupational 
carcinogens.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the high heterogeneity in lung cancer burden among different 
populations, decision-makers should understand local epidemiological 
characteristics of lung cancer in detail to formulate effective policies. 
Stricter tobacco control and improvement in lung cancer screening and treatment 
are imperative.

BACKGROUND Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) account for <2% of all soft tissue 
tumors and are slow-growing neoplasms of mesenchymal origin, which have been 
reported in various locations. They are frequently observed at the pleura and a 
perianal location is extremely rare. They show no predisposition by sex, are 
mainly benign, and usually occur between the 5th and 7th decades of life. CASE 
REPORT We report the case of an 80-year-old man with no comorbidities except 
hypertension, who presented with an asymptomatic perineal mass. Magnetic 
resonance imaging showed a solid tumor measuring 3.5×2.5 cm identified in the 
perineal midline. It was very close to the anal sphincter, showing no extension 
to the rectum or anus. The tumor was completely excised with negative margins. 
The postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged home, free of any 
symptoms. The pathological examination showed a benign completely excised SFT, 
and no further treatment was necessary. At the 6-month and 1-year follow-ups, 
there was no sign of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS A comprehensive review of all the 
reported cases of perianal SFTs shows that the majority of these tumors present 
with no symptoms and have a favorable prognosis. Diagnosis is possible only 
after a pathological examination. The criterion standard of treatment is 
complete excision with negative margins. Once excised, the tumors have low rates 
of recurrence and metastasis. Tumors very close to the anal sphincter and with 
malignant potential need to be operated on with extra care to obtain clear 
margins without disrupting the continence mechanism.

INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a rapidly growing global health concern with 
considerable negative impact on life-time expectancy. It has yet not been 
clarified if and how obesity impacts outcomes of severe bacterial infections. 
The aim of this study was to determine how body mass index impacts outcome of 
severe bacterial infections in a well-defined population-based cohort.
METHODS: This study is based on a cohort of 2196 patients included in a Swedish 
prospective, population-based, consecutive observational study of the incidence 
of community-onset severe sepsis and septic shock in adults. All patients with 
weight and height documented in the medical records on admission were included.
RESULTS: The case fatality rate (CFR) was negatively correlating with increasing 
BMI. Outcomes included 28-day CFR (p-value = 0.002), hospital CFR (p-value = 
0.039) and 1-year CFR (p-value<0.001). When BMI was applied as continuous 
variable in a multiple logistic regression together with other possible 
covariates, we still could discern that BMI was associated with decreasing 
28-day CFR (OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.98, p-value = 0.009) and 1-year CFR (OR = 
0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.97, p-value<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The hypothesis and paradox of obesity being associated with higher 
survival rates in severe bacterial infections was confirmed in this prospective, 
population-based observational study.

CONTEXT: Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic, relapsing diseases that 
compromise life quality and expectancy. The increased incidence and prevalence 
of these diseases reinforce the need for research on prevention, therapy, and 
management innovations. Synbiotics (ie, probiotic plus prebiotic combinations) 
are suggested as an alternative or complementary therapy to conventional 
treatments for inflammatory bowel disease.
OBJECTIVE: The aim for this systematic review was to gather and analyze data 
from randomized controlled trials to provide more information to increase the 
current evidence level about the safety and efficacy of synbiotic use as a 
supplemental treatment for ulcerative colitis.
DATA SOURCES: Searches were performed in the Medline, Science Direct, Scielo, 
Scopus, and Embase databases between January 2017 and March 2019, using the 
keywords "colitis" and "synbiotics".
DATA EXTRACTION: The data extraction method performed for each trial was based 
on the recommendations of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for 
randomized clinical trials. The trials included in this meta-analysis presented 
low risk of bias, based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of 
Interventions guidelines.
DATA ANALYSIS: The results demonstrated that synbiotics significantly improved 
colonic endoscopic and histologic scores, the Clinical Activity Index, serum 
C-reactive protein levels, intestinal microbiota, Bowel Habits Index, and levels 
of messenger RNAs, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1α, interleukin-10, and 
myeloperoxidase in the patients. In addition, the use of synbiotics increased 
probiotic microorganisms, reduced proinflammatory colonic cytokines, and 
elevated anti-inflammatory cytokines.
CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the results of this meta-analysis reinforce the evidence 
that synbiotics provide benefits to patients when used as an alternative or 
complementary therapy for those with ulcerative colitis.

INTRODUCTION: Elevated serum parathormone (PTH) levels have been observed in 
acute kidney injury and are related to calcium-phosphate metabolism disturbance, 
decreased renal production of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, impaired renal PTH 
excretion, and other renal-independent factors. There are no data regarding PTH 
concentration kinetics in critically ill patients undergoing continuous renal 
replacement therapies (CRRT) in an intensive care setting. The primary objective 
of this study was to investigate trends in PTH serum levels in critically ill 
patients with multiorgan failure undergoing CRRT, by performing periodic PTH 
measurements in the acute phase of critical illness.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a single-centre, prospective, observational study 
conducted in an mixed, university-affiliated intensive care unit. Critically ill 
patients who fulfilled all of the following criteria were included: respiratory 
failure; circulatory failure; acute kidney injury treated by CRRT; and 
sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score) of 5 or more. Patients 
who met any of the following criteria were excluded: acute liver failure; 
hypercalcemia at admission (total calcium serum level > 10.6 mg/dL; total 
ionized calcium plasma level > 1.35 mmol/L); parathyroid gland disease; 
end-stage renal disease; patients undergoing therapeutic plasma exchange or 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedures; aged under 18 years; pregnant; 
and life expectancy after admission to the intensive care unit anticipated to be 
less than 72 hours as assessed by the investigator.
