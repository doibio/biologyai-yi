In the present study, diel pattern in gut microbial communities in insects were 
evaluated. Lymantria dispar asiatica fourth instar larvae (72 ± 2 hr after 
molting) at noon (LdD) and midnight (LdN) were used for a comparative analysis 
of the gut microbial community. Ten bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) 
were shared between LdD and LdN samples. One bacterial OTU was specific to LdD. 
The dominant gut microbes were OTU72 in LdD and OTU75 in LdN. A linear 
discriminant analysis effect size cladogram suggested that ten bacterial OTUs 
maintain significant differences in relative abundances between LdD and LdN. 
These results agreed with the discrete ellipses between LdD and LdN in principal 
coordinates analysis plots. Additionally, using phylogenetic investigation of 
communities by reconstruction of unobserved states, the gut microbial community 
was assigned to 23 functional terms, among which 22 exhibited significant 
differences between LdD and LdN. To conclude, the present study documented a 
diel pattern in the gut microbial community of L. dispar asiatica larvae.

The purpose of this study is to explore relationships between the practice of 
exercise, gender, and health, from adolescence to old age, testing the magnitude 
of gender differences throughout the life cycle in the practice of exercise of 
Spanish people. A cross-sectional study with 4,575 women and 4,334 men, aged 
13-85 years, was conducted. The participants were assessed on the weekly hours 
they dedicated to the practice of exercise, masculine/instrumental and 
feminine/expressive traits, mental health symptomatology, and self-rated 
health). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed in the age groups 
of adolescence, late adolescence, young adulthood, middle adulthood, and older 
age. Results showed that men dedicated significantly more hours to the practice 
of exercise than women within all age groups, except in older age (men´s average 
= 4.07; women´s average = 2.55). The masculine/instrumental trait played a 
mediating role between gender and practice of exercise hours. Furthermore, a 
decline in the amount of time dedicated to exercise from adolescence to older 
age was found, with higher drops in men. Finally, the practice of exercise was 
associated with better self-rated health and less mental symptoms. These results 
underline the important role that gender and masculine-instrumental trait play 
on the practice of exercise .

There is an increase in the number of patients with osteoporotic fractures due 
to the aging population in Korea. This study investigated the burden of 
osteoporotic fractures including hip, spine, and wrist fractures in the Korean 
population by estimating disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The DALY for a 
given condition in a population captures years of life lost due to premature 
death and years of life lived with a disability and its severity and duration. 
To calculate DALYs from all relevant data collected for the 3 conditions, we 
used a DALY calculation template provided by the World Health Organization in 
2014. DALYs per 100 000 for vertebral fractures (3168) were higher than those of 
hip fractures (2496) in women. Wrist fractures (1038) had the least burden, and 
the difference between men and women was the lowest. The aging population is 
expected to increase the burden of osteoporosis.

BACKGROUND: People with severe mental disorders (SMD) experience premature 
mortality mostly from preventable physical causes. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) have recently produced guidelines on the management of physical health 
conditions in SMD. This paper presents the evidence which led to the 
recommendations for tobacco cessation and management of substance use disorders 
in SMD.
METHODS: Scoping reviews informed 2 PICO (Population Intervention, Comparator, 
Outcome) questions relating to tobacco cessation and management of substance use 
disorders in SMD. Systematic searches led to the identification of systematic 
reviews with relevant evidence to address these questions. Retrieved evidence 
was assessed using GRADE methodology, informing the development of guidelines.
RESULTS: One thousand four hundred thirty-four records were identified through 
systematic searches for SMD and tobacco cessation, of which 4 reviews were 
included in GRADE tables and 18 reviews in narrative synthesis. For SMD and 
substance use disorders, 4268 records were identified, of which 4 studies from 
reviews were included in GRADE tables and 16 studies in narrative synthesis. 
People with SMD who use tobacco should be offered combined pharmacological 
(Varenicline, Bupropion or Nicotine Replacement Therapy) and non-pharmacological 
interventions such as tailored directive and supportive behavioural 
interventions. For people with SMD and substance use disorders (drug and/or 
alcohol), interventions should be considered in accordance with WHO mhGAP 
guidelines. Prescribers should note potential drug-drug interactions. 
Recommendation were conditional and based on low/very low certainty of evidence 
with a scarcity of evidence from low- and middle-income settings.
CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines mark an important step towards addressing 
premature mortality in people with SMD. The dearth of high-quality evidence and 
evidence from LMIC settings must inform the future research agenda.

AIM: Assess the risk of synchronous metastasis and establish a nomogram in 
patients with GISTs.
METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2004-2014) was 
accessed. With the logistic regression model as the basis, a nomogram was 
constructed.
RESULTS: 7,256 target patients were contained in our study. The nomogram 
discrimination for mGIST prediction revealed that tumor size contributed most to 
synchronous metastasis, followed by lymph nodes, extension, pathologic grade, 
tumor location, and mitotic count. C-index values of predictions were 0.821 (95% 
CI, 0.805-0.836) and 0.815 (95% CI, 0.800-0.831), and Brier score were 0.109 and 
0.112 in training and validation group, respectively. The value of area under 
the ROCs were 0.813 (p < 0.001) in the primary cohort and 0.819 (p < 0.001) in 
the validation cohort. Through the calibration curves (as seen in the figures), 
nomogram prediction proved to have excellent agreement with actual metastatic 
diseases.
CONCLUSION: A new nomogram was created that can evaluate synchronous metastatic 
diseases in patients with GISTs.

BACKGROUND: Depression impacts the lives of millions of people worldwide. 
Behavioral activation (BA), derived from cognitive behavioral therapy, has the 
potential for improving depressive symptoms in patients with depression. Studies 
evaluating the effectiveness of BA specifically in the context of group therapy 
programs in a hospital setting for patients with depression are limited. In this 
study, we report findings from a pilot trial evaluating group BA for major 
depressive disorder.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this pilot trial are to assess the potential of a 
full trial of BA group therapy in a large-scale tertiary care setting and to 
provide preliminary information about possible results regarding mood symptoms 
and quality of life in adults with depression.
METHODS: Using a parallel single-cohort pragmatic pilot randomized controlled 
trial design, we evaluated the potential of conducting a large trial of BA 
effectiveness among adults with depression. Participants were randomized to the 
intervention (BA in addition to usual care) or control (support group in 
addition to usual care) groups and were assessed weekly for 18 consecutive 
weeks. Participants randomized to intervention underwent 28 2-h group BA therapy 
visits administered by trained therapists and completed assessments to examine 
treatment outcomes. Feasibility was measured in terms of enrollment rates (min. 
20%), completion rates of study (min. 80%), and completion rates of weekly 
measurement scales (min. 80%). The reporting of this pilot trial is in 
accordance with the CONSORT extension for randomized pilot and feasibility 
trials.
RESULTS: We randomized 20 individuals of mean age of 48.8 years (standard 
deviation = 9.7) with a DSM-5 diagnosis of major depressive disorder to 
intervention (n = 10) or control (n = 10) groups. Based on our feasibility 
criteria, our recruitment rate was excellent (20/27; 74%), study completion was 
found to be a moderate (80% of the total participants in both arms completed the 
study; BA = 100%, control = 60%), and completeness of measurements on a weekly 
basis was adequate overall (82%; BA = 86%, control = 79%).
CONCLUSIONS: The study has demonstrated the potential feasibility to perform a 
larger scale trial upon modifications to the control group to avoid the low rate 
of study completion (60%) in this group.

Genetic manipulations including chromosome engineering are essential techniques 
used to restructure cell metabolism. Lambda/Red (λ/Red)-mediated recombination 
is the most commonly applied approach for chromosomal modulation in Escherichia 
coli. However, the efficiency of this method is significantly hampered by the 
laborious removal of the selectable markers. To overcome the problem, the 
integration helper plasmid was constructed, pSBC1a-CtR, which contains Red 
recombinase, Cre recombinase, and exogenous orthogonal aminoacyl-transfer RNA 
(tRNA) synthetase/tRNA pairs, allows an unnatural amino acid (UAA) to be 
genetically encoded at the defined site of the antibiotic resistance 
gene-encoded protein. When UAAs are not in the culture medium, there was no 
expression in the antibiotic resistance gene-encoded protein. Accordingly, the 
next procedure of antibiotic gene excising is not needed. To verify this method, 
poxB gene was knocked out successfully. Furthermore, sequential deletion of 
three target genes (galR, ptsG, and pgi) was able to generate 
neurosporene-producing strain marked by high growth rate. Thus, the 
site-specific incorporation UAA mutagenesis system were used to control and 
expand the use of conditional selectable marker, and the technique is used to 
facilitate a rapid continuous genome editing in Escherichia coli.

Progression to blindness in 20 years among patients with glaucomatous visual 
field loss in a tertiary hospital in the Philippines.

Cabrera CC(1), Tumbocon JA(1), de Leon JM(1).

Author information:
(1)Eye Institute, St. Luke's Medical Center, Quezon City, Philippines.

OBJECTIVE: To determine visual field (VF) rates of change among patients with 
glaucomatous VF loss and proportion of those becoming blind based on residual 
life expectancy and factors associated with fast progression.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This was a retrospective study of the VFs of patients with 
glaucomatous VF defects in at least one eye. Baseline and final VFs were 
reviewed. Rates of VF change (decibels (dB)/year) for each eye, together with 
the residual life expectancy based on age and sex, were used to predict mean 
deviation/defect (MD) at the end of expected lifetime. Blindness was defined if 
computed MD was 22 dB (Octopus) or -22 dB (Humphrey) or worse in the better eye. 
Factors associated with fast progression (>1 dB/year for Octopus or <-1 dB/year 
for Humphrey) and blindness were determined.
RESULTS: There were 1016 eyes of 583 patients eligible. There was decline in VF 
MD/year in 613/1016 (60.3%), 95% CI (57.3% to 63.3%) of eyes; however, only 
98/1016 (9.7%), 95% CI (7.9% to 11.5%) of eyes showed fast progression. Among 
patients with bilateral VFs, 43/433 (9.9%), 95% CI (7.1 to 12.8) of eyes were 
predicted to progress to blindness. In multivariate analysis, factors associated 
with fast progression were baseline MD (p<0.001) and male sex (p=0.041). Factors 
associated with blindness were age <60 years (p=0.003), baseline MD (p=0.022), 
bilateral glaucomatous VF defects (p=<0.001) and fast progression (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients reaching blindness in a routine clinical setting was 10%. 
Because of association of age and baseline MD on blindness, early disease 
detection is important. VF progression rates and residual life expectancy must 
be incorporated in glaucoma care.

The measurement of insects is an important component of many entomological 
applications, including forensic evidence, where larvae size is used as a proxy 
for developmental stage, and hence time since colonization/death. Current 
methods for measuring insects are confounded by varying preservation techniques, 
biased and non-standardized measurements, and often a lack of sample size given 
practical constraints. Towards enhanced accuracy and precision in measuring live 
insects to help avoid these variables, and that allows for different 
measurements to be analyzed, we developed a non-invasive, digital method using 
widely available free analytical software to measure live blow fly larvae. Using 
crime scene photographic equipment currently standard in investigation 
protocols, we measured the live length of 282 Phormia regina larvae. Repeated 
measurements of maggots, for all instars, were performed for several 
orientations and images. Most accurate measurements were obtained when maggots 
were oriented in their natural full extension. Killed specimens resulted in 
greater length measurements (Mean 1.79 ± 1.11 mm) when compared to live length. 
Herein, we report a technically simple, fast, and accurate measurement technique 
adapted for field and lab-based measurements, as well as, a simple linear 
equation for conversion of live length to standard killed length measurements. 
We propose this method be utilized for the standardization of forensic 
entomological evidence collection and development model creation.

Aims: Pembrolizumab demonstrated significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) 
vs. chemotherapy in the Phase III KEYNOTE-045 trial, and is approved in the US 
for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma (mUC) who progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy. Using longer 
follow-up and individual patient-data from KEYNOTE-045, this study evaluates the 
cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy or atezolizumab from a US 
payer perspective.Materials and methods: A partitioned-survival model was 
developed over a 20-year time horizon. Progression-free survival (PFS) and OS 
for pembrolizumab and chemotherapy were extrapolated using a piecewise modelling 
approach, where patient-level data from KEYNOTE-045 were used for the initial 
period followed by parametric distributions. OS of atezolizumab was estimated by 
indirect treatment comparisons based on KEYNOTE-045 and IMvigor211. Different 
scenarios were explored in the absence of indirect comparisons on PFS and 
time-on-treatment (ToT) between pembrolizumab and atezolizumab. Drug 
acquisition/administration, disease management, adverse events, and terminal 
care costs were considered.Results: Compared with chemotherapy, pembrolizumab 
resulted in a mean gain of 1.33 life-years and 1.14 quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) and an incremental cost of $106,299, yielding an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $93,481/QALY gained. Pembrolizumab dominated 
atezolizumab in extending patients' life by 0.89 years and 0.76 QALYs, while 
reducing costs by $26,458. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness included survival 
extrapolation, OS hazard ratio of pembrolizumab vs. atezolizumab, and time 
horizon. Pembrolizumab had a 66% and 100% probability of being cost-effective 
vs. chemotherapy and atezolizumab, respectively, at a $100,000 
willingness-to-pay threshold.Limitations and conclusions: Uncertainties remain 
with extrapolated PFS and OS for pembrolizumab, OS indirect comparison, and ToT 
for atezolizumab. Despite these limitations, the model used robust methods to 
estimate key clinical endpoints with patient-level data from longer follow-up of 
KEYNOTE-045. Pembrolizumab dominates atezolizumab and is very likely 
cost-effective vs. chemotherapy in 2 L mUC at a $100,000 willingness-to-pay 
threshold.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop the classification system 
for version of the SF-6D (SF-6Dv2) from the SF-36v2. SF-6Dv2 is an improved 
version of SF-6D, one of the most widely used generic measures of health for the 
calculation of quality-adjusted life years.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A 3-step process was undertaken to generate a new 
classification system: (1) factor analysis to establish dimensionality; (2) 
Rasch analysis to understand item performance; and (3) tests of differential 
item function. To evaluate robustness, Rasch analyses were performed in multiple 
subsets of 2 large cross-sectional datasets from recently discharged hospital 
patients and online patient samples.
RESULTS: On the basis of factor analysis, other psychometric evidence, 
cross-cultural considerations, and amenability to valuation, the 6-dimension 
classification used in SF-6D was maintained. SF-6Dv2 resulted in the following 
modifications to SF-6D: a simpler classification of physical function with 
clearer separation between levels; a more detailed 5-level description of role 
limitations; using negative wording to describe vitality; and using pain 
severity rather than pain interference.
CONCLUSIONS: The SF-6Dv2 classification system describes more distinct levels of 
health than SF-6D, changes the descriptions used for a number of dimensions and 
provides clearer wording for health state valuation. The second stage of the 
study has developed a utility value set using discrete choice methods so that 
the measure can be used in health technology assessment. Further work should 
investigate the psychometric characteristics of the new instrument.

The emergence of mental health (MH) problems during a pandemic is extremely 
common, though difficult to address due to the complexities of pandemics and the 
scarcity of evidence about the epidemiology of pandemic-related MH problems and 
the potential interventions to tackle them. Little attention has been devoted so 
far to this topic from policymakers, stakeholders and researchers, resulting in 
a lack of replicable, scalable and applicable frameworks to help plan, develop 
and deliver MH care during pandemics. As a response, we have attempted to 
develop a conceptual framework (CF) that could guide the development, 
implementation, and evaluation of MH interventions during the ongoing COVID-19 
pandemic. This CF was developed by early career psychiatrists from 16 countries 
that cover all the WHO regions. Their opinions were elicited via a 
semi-structured questionnaire. They were asked to provide their views about the 
current MH situation in their countries and to elaborate on existing 'myths' and 
misinformation. They were also asked to name the resources available and to 
propose solutions and approaches to provide accessible and affordable care. The 
CF was prepared based on the extant literature and the views discussed in this 
group; it illustrates the epidemiology of MH problems, preparedness plans, 
stage-specific plans or innovative solutions, opportunities to integrate those 
plans and possible outcomes at policy level. This CF can serve as a technical 
guide for future research regarding pandemics. It can be used to monitor trends 
and to optimize efforts, and to develop evidence based MH interventions. Still, 
further research focusing on the individual components of this framework is 
needed.

meta-analysis.

BACKGROUND: Development of cognitive decline represents substantial issues in 
today's society, steadily gaining importance with increasing life expectancy. 
One potential approach to preventing cognitive decline is to lower homocysteine 
by administering vitamin B. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we 
address this topic and investigate whether oral supplementation of vitamin B can 
successfully prevent cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals.
METHODS: A computerized systematic literature search was conducted using the 
electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Eligibility 
criteria included oral supplementation with vitamin B (B1, B6, folic acid, and 
B12) and the absence of cognitive impairment. A meta-analysis was conducted with 
"global cognition" as the primary outcome of this review. Secondary outcomes 
were changes in cognitive function in other cognitive domains reported in the 
included studies. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Risk of 
Bias tool and the GRADE approach to establish the overall certainty of the 
evidence.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis did not yield a significant overall effect of 
supplementation with vitamin B on cognitive function (Z = 0.87; p = 0.39; SMD, 
0.02; 95% CI, - 0.034, 0.08). A sensitivity analysis focusing on specific risk 
factors did not alter this result. Some studies reported isolated significant 
effects of the intervention on secondary outcomes. However, these findings were 
outnumbered by the number of cognitive tests that did not yield significant 
effects.
DISCUSSION: We found no overall evidence that oral vitamin B supplementation 
prevented cognitive decline. The isolated significant effects that were reported 
could be attributed to methodological issues. The results of this review do not 
provide evidence that population groups with certain risk factors would profit 
more from the intervention than others. Our findings do not apply to forms of 
administration other than oral supplementation nor do they offer information 
regarding the treatment of cognitively impaired individuals via the 
administration of vitamin B.

The human monothiol glutaredoxin Glrx3 (PICOT) is ubiquitously distributed in 
cytoplasm and nuclei in mammalian cells. Its overexpression has been associated 
with the development of several types of tumors, whereas its deficiency might 
cause retardation in embryogenesis. Its exact biological role has not been well 
resolved, although a function as a chaperone distributing iron/sulfur clusters 
is currently accepted. Yeast humanization and the use of a mouse library have 
allowed us to find a new partner for PICOT: the human GMP synthase (hGMPs). Both 
proteins carry out collaborative functions regarding the downregulation of the 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gcn2 pathway under conditions of nutritional stress. 
Glrx3/hGMPs interact through conserved residues that bridge iron/sulfur clusters 
and glutathione. This mechanism is also conserved in budding yeast, whose 
proteins Grx3/Grx4, along with GUA1 (S. cerevisiae GMPs), also downregulate the 
integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. The heterologous expression of 
Glrx3/hGMPs efficiently complements Grx3/Grx4. Moreover, the heterologous 
expression of Glrx3 efficiently complements the novel participation in 
chronological life span that has been characterized for both Grx3 and Grx4. Our 
results underscore that the Glrx3/Grx3/Grx4 family presents an evolutionary and 
functional conservation in signaling events that is partly related to GMP 
function and contributes to cell life extension.IMPORTANCESaccharomyces 
cerevisiae is an optimal eukaryotic microbial model to study biological 
processes in higher organisms despite the divergence in evolution. The molecular 
function of yeast glutaredoxins Grx3 and Grx4 is enormously interesting, since 
both proteins are required to maintain correct iron homeostasis and an efficient 
response to oxidative stress. The human orthologous Glrx3 (PICOT) is involved in 
a number of human diseases, including cancer. Our research expanded its utility 
to human cells. Yeast has allowed the characterization of GMP synthase as a new 
interacting partner for Glrx3 and also for yeast Grx3 and Grx4, the complex 
monothiol glutaredoxins/GMPs that participate in the downregulation of the 
activity of the Gcn2 stress pathway. This mechanism is conserved in yeast and 
humans. Here, we also show that this family of glutaredoxins, Grx3/Grx4/Glrx3, 
also has a function related to life extension.

BACKGROUND: Despite enthusiasm for cancer screening, systematic reviews 
consistently fail to show that screening reduces all-cause mortality. This 
narrative review explores conceptual issues, and inconsistencies between 
evidence and opinion about screening.
REVIEW: We examined the interpretation of screening studies in relation to three 
intellectual traditions: (1) The relationship between prevention and cure; (2) 
Confirmation bias and the challenge of incorporating new data: less care may 
produce better outcomes than more care; (3) The answers to three structured 
questions about efficacy, effectiveness, and value of treatments proposed by Sir 
Archie Cochrane and Sir Austin Bradford Hill.
SYNTHESIS: When considering extensions of life expectancy or all-cause 
mortality, systematic reviews typically show cancer screening to have only small 
effects and often non-significant effects on all-cause mortality. Early 
diagnosis does not assure application of an intervention that alters the pathway 
toward demise. The interpretation of screening results is also affected by 
several known biases. Investigators and advocates are encumbered by an over 
focus on studies designed to determine if a treatment can work under ideal 
circumstances. To advance the field, we need a greater emphasis on evaluations 
that ask 'Does the treatment work under real-world conditions?', and 'Is the 
treatment worth it?' in terms of outcomes that are meaningful to patients.

Confocal Raman microspectroscopy (CRM) analysis provides subcellular 
compositional and morphology related information. In this study, we used CRM in 
conjunction with multivariate statistical analysis to elucidate the 
time-dependent impact of the γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT 
(N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester) of 
osteosarcoma (OS) cells. The interactions of DAPT (20 μM) with a murine OS cell 
line K7M2 at 24 and 48 h were monitored. The spectral characteristics of drug 
action were identified to illustrate the cellular compositional alterations, 
showing that DAPT induced apoptosis by reducing the protein, lipid and nucleic 
acid content and structural changes. Multivariate algorithms, principal 
component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) revealed a clear 
separation among cells in the untreated control (UT), 24H (DAPT-treated for 
24 h), and 48H (DAPT-treated for 48 h) groups, achieving sensitivities of 100%, 
96%, 100% and specificities of 98%, 100%, 100%, respectively. After 
point-scanned spectral imaging, K-means clustering analysis (KCA) was further 
used to visualize sub-cellular morphological changes and the underlying spectral 
characteristics in a temporal sequence. Compared with the UT group, Raman 
imaging results exhibited gradually increased nuclear division of OS cells with 
DAPT treatment duration extension, along with changes in the physiology of other 
organelles within the cell. By providing a unique perspective for understanding 
the temporary cellular responses to DAPT at molecular level, the achieved 
results form the foundation of strategies for the application of CRM and other 
Raman-based techniques for studying the therapeutic responses of other 
anticancer agents in cancer model systems.

Bioactive packaging is an alternative new technology for preserving the quality 
and safety of food products with providing health benefits. In this way, the 
Lactobacillus plantarum, cellulose nanofiber (CNF) and inulin incorporated 
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) based probiotic nanocomposite film was prepared. 
The fabricated film samples were characterized by FTIR, FE-SEM, XRD and DSC 
analyses, that the obtained results indicated the good compatibility between 
CMC, CNF, and inulin. As a result, the CMC-based probiotic films containing CNF 
and inulin exhibited satisfactory water barrier and mechanical properties. 
Additionally, the viability of probiotic bacteria in the CMC-based films was 
significantly (p < 0.05) increased (36%) by addition of inulin as a prebiotic 
ingredient during storage time. Probiotic film sample showed antibacterial 
activity against nine pathogens and also extended the chicken fillet shelf life 
when wrapped on the meat. In conclusion, the application of CNF and inulin 
incorporated CMC-based probiotic nanocomposite film as a bioactive food 
packaging system opens up a new horizon for improving the shelf life of food 
products and providing the health benefits for consumers.

Water activity is a physical property measured in the food industry which helps 
predict shelf life and microbial activity. Honey normally has a water activity 
less than 0.6, but this can vary with the amount of crystallization in solution. 
The aim of this work was to obtain relationships, as fundamental as possible, 
that can be used to predict the water activity of solutions with compositions 
similar to honey. Water activity measurements of aqueous sucrose solutions have 
been well analysed in literature using hydration theory. The analysis based on 
hydration numbers was easily able to show the quality of data previously 
published, and hence relationships were proposed for the hydration numbers of 
glucose, fructose, maltose and glycerol. A model was proposed in this study, to 
predict the water activity of food systems containing high concentrations of 
sugars and some electrolytes. The model was analysed and validated using mostly 
literature data supplemented with new experimental data.

BACKGROUND: Complete surgical resection remains the primary curative option for 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, with positive margins in 30-70% of patients. 
In this study, we aimed to evaluate the use of intraoperative tumour-specific 
imaging to enhance a surgeon's ability to detect visually occult cancer in real 
time.
METHODS: In this single-centre, open-label, single-arm study, done in the USA, 
we enrolled patients who had clinically suspicious or biopsy-confirmed 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and were scheduled for curative surgery. 
Eligible patients were 19 years of age or older with a life expectancy of more 
than 12 weeks and a Karnofsky performance status of at least 70% or an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group or Zubrod level of one or lower, who were scheduled 
to undergo curative surgery. Patients were sequentially enrolled into each 
dosing group and 2-5 days before surgery, patients were intravenously infused 
with 100 mg of unlabelled panitumumab followed by 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg of the 
near-infrared fluorescently labelled antibody (panitumumab-IRDye800CW). The 
primary endpoint was to determine the optimal dose of panitumumab-IRDye800CW in 
identifying pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas as measured by 
tumour-to-background ratio in all patients. The tumour-to-background ratio was
