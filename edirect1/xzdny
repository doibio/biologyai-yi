across three European countries. Further evaluation in the form of four pilot 
studies with 160 participants will be performed and qualitative and quantitative 
measures will be used to process the feedback about the use of the application.

Housing is one of the social determinants of health, and homelessness is 
associated with health inequalities including increased morbidity and decreased 
life expectancy. Services to improve access to and use of primary healthcare are 
provided to formerly homeless individuals (hereafter residents) who live in 
permanent supportive housing (PSH). Residents do not always utilize services, 
nor receive adequate healthcare, and often have poor health outcomes. The study 
aims were to explore nurse and case manager (hereafter participants) views on 
the challenges of providing healthcare to residents, and strategies to address 
challenges. This descriptive, qualitative study used thematic analysis. Five 
nurses and eight case managers working with residents of PSH agencies were 
interviewed using semistructured interviews. Five main themes emerged. The first 
theme of context of healthcare use included how the residents' history of 
homelessness, trauma, and survival affected using services. The second theme was 
how aspects of relationships (communication issues and mistrust) were barriers 
to care. The third theme was how residents' health issues (physical chronic 
diseases, mental health, and substance dependency) affected care. Community 
level barriers (insurance, financial hardship, and transportation) was the 
fourth theme. The final theme highlighted recommendations to improve access and 
use of healthcare by building rapport, addressing mistrust, and using effective 
communication techniques. Participants noted that barriers to healthcare use 
were often influenced by residents' previous homeless experience. Nurses noted 
that chronic physical health issues were problematic for residents. Participants 
expressed the need to take time to form an authentic relationship to increase 
trust with residents.

BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a significant health and 
economic burden in the United States. Treatments include chemoimmunotherapy, 
such as obinutuzumab (G) plus chlorambucil (Clb) or bendamustine plus rituximab 
(BR), and chemotherapy-free regimens incorporating oral targeted therapies such 
as ibrutinib (Ibr), acalabrutinib (Acala), or venetoclax (Ven). Most 
chemotherapy-free regimens require continuous treatment to progression, while 
Ven plus G (VenG) is given for a fixed duration of 12 months, based on the CLL14 
trial that led to its approval. Fixed-duration VenG has the potential for cost 
savings compared with treat-to-progression chemotherapy-free regimens. 
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 12 months fixed-duration VenG 
in first-line treatment of unfit patients with CLL from a US health care payer 
perspective compared with GClb, BR, Ibr, Ibr + G, Ibr + R, Acala, and Acala + G. 
METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed with 3 health states: 
progression-free survival (PFS), postprogression survival, and dead. The patient 
population, as based on the CLL14 trial, comprised previously untreated unfit 
patients with CLL (mean age 71.1 years, 33.1% female). The distribution of 
patients in each health state over time was estimated using extrapolated PFS and 
overall survival (OS) curves for VenG and GClb, based on CLL14 data 2 or more 
years after treatment cessation. PFS and OS for the other comparators were 
estimated using hazard ratios vs VenG, based on a network metaanalysis. Adverse 
events, utility values, and costs were obtained from published literature. The 
model estimated life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, 
and costs. The time horizon was 20 years, with a cycle time of 28 days. Outcomes 
and costs were discounted at 3.0% per year, and costs were estimated from a US 
health care payer perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were conducted. RESULTS: In this cross-trial analysis of unfit CLL patients, in 
the base case, VenG had lower projected total costs than all comparators 
investigated. VenG also had larger projected health benefits (more QALYs gained) 
than GClb, BR, Ibr, and Ibr + R. VenG was therefore more effective and less 
costly than these comparators (dominant). Ibr + G, Acala, and Acala + G showed 
higher QALYs gained vs VenG (0.022, 0.672, and 0.961, respectively), and 
substantially higher projected costs vs VenG ($1,488,400, $1,579,737, and 
$1,656,154, respectively). Thus, Ibr + G, Acala, and Acala + G would cost more 
than $1,000,000 per QALY gained vs VenG. At the commonly used willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $150,000 per QALY gained, Ibr + G, Acala, and Acala + G were not 
cost-effective compared with VenG. CONCLUSIONS: Fixed-duration VenG for 12 
months is a cost-effective first-line treatment option for unfit CLL patients 
compared with other available options and provides value for money to US health 
care payers at a threshold of $150,000 per QALY gained. Future studies with 
longer trial follow-up and more mature survival data may help to confirm 
longer-term cost benefits of VenG. DISCLOSURES: Genentech Inc. and AbbVie

INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD) can have a profound negative impact on the 
quality of life (QoL) of patients. We analyzed the long-term changes in AD 
symptoms, QoL, and patient assessment of treatment effect in adults with 
moderate-to-severe AD treated for 2 years with dupilumab.
METHODS: LIBERTY AD OLE (NCT01949311) is a multicenter, open-label extension 
(OLE) study in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who previously participated in 
dupilumab clinical trials (parent studies). Patients received dupilumab 300 mg 
weekly. Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Dermatology Life Quality Index 
(DLQI), EQ-5D-3L, and the Patient Global Assessment of Treatment Effect (PGATE) 
were assessed at weeks 48 and 100.
RESULTS: A total of 2677 patients were included in the OLE, and 1028 completed 
week 100. By weeks 48 and 100, 94.1% and 95.6% of patients achieved a ≥ 4-point 
change in POEM from the parent study baseline (PSBL), respectively, and 93.3% 
and 93.4% of patients had achieved a ≥ 4-point change in DLQI from PSBL, 
respectively. At week 100, 35.1% of patients had a POEM score ≤ 2 (AD 
clear/almost clear) compared with 0.1% at PSBL, and 49.9% had a DLQI score of 0 
or 1 (no effect at all on patient's life) compared with 1.5% at PSBL. At week 
100, 74.5-97.3% of patients reported no effect of AD on the individual EQ-5D-3L 
domains, and 93.8% rated the effect of dupilumab treatment as "excellent," "very 
good," or "good" according to PGATE.
CONCLUSION: In adults with moderate-to-severe AD, dupilumab treatment over 
2 years resulted in sustained improvements in patient-reported symptoms and QoL 
and a favorable patient perception of treatment effect.

Plain Language Summary: Atopic dermatitis is a common skin disease that causes 
scaly, itchy skin. It can have a profoundly negative effect on a patient’s 
quality of life (QoL). In short-term clinical trials, dupilumab treatment 
resulted in significant improvements in signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis, 
and in the QoL reported by patients, together with acceptable safety. In this 
study, adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who had completed one of 
the short-term clinical trials continued dupilumab treatment, including those 
who had taken placebo. This study allowed researchers to continue to evaluate 
how dupilumab worked in the long term, including its impact on patient-reported 
outcomes, which measure the success of treatment from the patient’s own 
perspective. The results were evaluated at approximately 1 and 2 years of this 
open-label extension study and were compared with the period just before the 
patient was first treated with dupilumab so that the effect of dupilumab could 
be seen. At approximately 1 and 2 years, most patients had achieved clinically 
meaningful improvements in two measures: Patient Oriented Eczema Measure, a tool 
used by patients to self-report the severity of their symptoms, and Dermatology 
Life Quality Index, which allows patients to report the effect of the disease on 
their QoL. Additionally, in this open-label extension study, most patients 
described their experience of being treated with dupilumab as “excellent,” “very 
good,” or “good” using the Patient Global Assessment of Treatment Effect 
questionnaire. Dupilumab treatment resulted in sustained improvements in atopic 
dermatitis and was regarded favorably by patients.

Enthusiastic but Inconsistent: Graduate Teaching Assistants' Perceptions of 
Their Role in the CURE Classroom.

Despite growing evidence of positive student outcomes from course-based 
undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), little consideration has been given 
to employing graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) as CURE instructors. GTAs may 
be novice researchers and/or teachers and likely vary in their interest in 
teaching a CURE. Guided by expectancy-value theory, we explored how GTAs' 
self-efficacy and values regarding teaching a CURE impact motivation and 
perceptions of their roles as CURE instructors. Using a multiple case study 
design, we interviewed nine GTAs who taught a network CURE at one research 
institution. Though most GTAs held a relatively high value for teaching a CURE 
for a range of reasons, some GTAs additionally perceived high costs associated 
with teaching the CURE. Through the interview data, we established three 
profiles to describe GTA perceptions of their role as CURE instructors: "Student 
Supporters," "Research Mentors," and "Content Deliverers." Those implementing 
GTA-led CUREs should consider that GTAs likely have different perceptions of 
both their role in the classroom and the associated costs of teaching a CURE. 
The variability in GTA perceptions of CUREs implies that undergraduate students 
of different GTAs are unlikely to experience the CURE equivalently.

OBJECTIVE: Excessive Internet use is a common health problem globally. This 
study aimed to assess the prevalence, correlates, and network structure of 
Internet addiction symptoms (Internet addiction hereafter) among Chinese 
pregnant and postpartum women.
METHODS: This was a multicenter cross-sectional study using Internet Addiction 
Test (IAT) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire 
(WHOQOL-BREF) to evaluate Internet addiction and quality of life (QOL), 
respectively. Univariate analyses, multivariate logistic regression analyses, 
and network analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Of a total of 1,060 women who completed the study, 320 (30.19%, 95% 
CI=27.42%-32.96%) women reported Internet addiction during or after pregnancy. 
Women with previous adverse pregnancy experiences (OR=1.831, P=0.001) and 
physical comorbidities (OR=1.724, P=0.004) had a higher likelihood of developing 
Internet addiction. Internet addiction was significantly associated with poor 
QOL in all domains. Network analyses revealed that IAT item 16 (request an 
extension for longer time spent online) was the most central symptom in the 
analyses, and also one of the strongest bridging symptoms linking the Internet 
addiction and QOL communities.
LIMITATIONS: This was a cross-sectional study, all study findings were based on 
self-reported data, and possible recall bias and selection bias may exist.
CONCLUSION: Internet addiction is common among Chinese pregnant and postpartum 
women, and is significantly associated with lower QOL. Effective strategies, 
especially focusing on central symptoms, are needed to reduce the impact of 
Internet addiction and improve QOL in pregnant and postpartum women.

Estimating total morbidity burden of COVID-19: relative importance of death and 
disability.

School of Medicine, True Blue, Grenada, West Indies. Electronic address:

OBJECTIVE: Calculations of disease burden of COVID-19, used to allocate scarce 
resources, have historically considered only mortality. However, survivors often 
develop postinfectious 'long-COVID' similar to chronic fatigue syndrome; 
physical sequelae such as heart damage, or both. This paper quantifies relative 
contributions of acute case fatality, delayed case fatality, and disability to 
total morbidity per COVID-19 case.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Healthy life years lost per COVID-19 case were 
computed as the sum of (incidence*disability weight*duration) for death and 
long-COVID by sex and 10-year age category in three plausible scenarios.
RESULTS: In all models, acute mortality was only a small share of total 
morbidity. For lifelong moderate symptoms, healthy years lost per COVID-19 case 
ranged from 0.92 (male in his 30s) to 5.71 (girl under 10) and were 3.5 and 3.6 
for the oldest females and males. At higher symptom severities, young people and 
females bore larger shares of morbidity; if survivors' later mortality 
increased, morbidity increased most in young people of both sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: Under most conditions most COVID-19 morbidity was in survivors. 
Future research should investigate incidence, risk factors, and clinical course 
of long-COVID to elucidate total disease burden, and decisionmakers should 
allocate scarce resources to minimize total morbidity.

OBJECTIVES: Symptoms associated with lung cancer and thoracic surgery might 
increase fall risk. We aimed to investigate: 1) balance, gait and functional 
status in people post-thoracic surgery compared to healthy controls; 2) 
perceptions of balance, gait and functional status.
METHODS: Recruitment targeted older adults (≥50 years) who had undergone 
thoracic surgery for a diagnosis of lung cancer in the previous 3 months, and 
healthy age-matched controls. Dynamic and static balance, gait velocity, 
knee-extension strength and physical activity levels were assessed using the 
BESTest, Kistler force plate, GAITRite system, Biodex System 3 and CHAMPS 
questionnaire, respectively. Two-part semi-structured interviews were conducted 
post-surgery.
RESULTS: Individuals post-surgery (n = 15) had worse dynamic balance and gait, 
and lower levels of moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (all p<0.05) 
versus healthy controls (n = 15). Strength did not differ between groups (p > 
0.05). No associations between BESTest and strength or physical activity existed 
post-surgery (p > 0.05). Three themes were identified: 1) Symptoms affect daily 
activities; 2) Functional assessments alter perceptions of balance ability and 
3) Open to supervised rehabilitation.
CONCLUSION: Balance, gait and MVPA are impaired post-thoracic surgery, yet 
balance was not viewed to be important in enabling activities of daily living. 
However, supervised rehabilitation was considered acceptable.

INTRODUCTION: While no direct comparative data exist for crizotinib in ROS1+ 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), studies have suggested clinical benefit with 
this targeted agent. The objective of this study was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of crizotinib compared to standard platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy for first-line treatment of ROS1+ advanced NSCLC.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed with a 10-year time horizon from the 
perspective of the Canadian publicly-funded health care system. Health states 
included progression-free survival (PFS), up to two further lines of therapy 
post-progression, palliation and death. Given a lack of comparative data and 
small study samples, crizotinib or chemotherapy studies with advanced ROS1+ 
NSCLC patients were identified and time-to-event data from digitized 
Kaplan-Meier curves were collected to pool PFS data. Costs of drugs, treatment 
administration, monitoring, adverse events and palliative care were included in 
2018 Canadian dollars, with 1.5% discounting. An incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) was estimated probabilistically using 5000 simulations.
RESULTS: In the base-case probabilistic analysis, crizotinib produced additional 
0.885 life-years and 0.772 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an incremental 
cost of $238,077, producing an ICER of $273,286/QALY gained. No simulations were 
found to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY 
gained. A scenario analysis assuming efficacy equivalent to the ALK+ NSCLC 
population showed a slightly more favorable cost-effectiveness profile for 
crizotinib.
CONCLUSIONS: Available data appear to support superior activity of crizotinib 
compared to chemotherapy in ROS1+ advanced NSCLC. At the list price, crizotinib 
was not cost-effective at commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds across 
a wide range of sensitivity analyses.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been increasing 
among the elderly populations. Trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE), a widely 
used first-line non-curative therapy for HCCs is an issue in geriatrics. We 
investigated the prognosis of elderly HCC patients treated with TACE and 
determined the factors that affect the overall survival.
METHODS: We included 266 patients who were older than 65 years and had received 
TACE as initial treatment for HCC. We analyzed the skeletal muscle index (SMI) 
and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (VSR) around the third lumbar vertebrae 
using computed tomography scans. Muscle depletion with visceral adiposity (MDVA) 
was defined by falling below the median SMI and above the median VSR value 
sex-specifically. We evaluated the overall survival in association with MDVA and 
other clinical factors.
RESULTS: The mean age was 69.9 ± 4.5 years, and 70.3% of the patients were men. 
According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, 29, 136, 
and 101 patients were classified as BCLC 0, A, and B stages, respectively, and 
79 (29.7%) had MDVA. During the median follow-up of 4.1 years, patients with 
MDVA had a shorter life expectancy than those without MDVA (P = 0.007) even 
though MDVA group had a higher objective response rate after the first TACE 
(82.3% vs. 75.9%, P = 0.035). Multivariate analysis revealed that MDVA (Hazard 
ratio [HR] 1.515) age (HR 1.057), liver function (HR 1.078), tumor size (HR 
1.083), serum albumin level (HR 0.523), platelet count (HR 0.996), tumor stage 
(stage A, HR 1.711; stage B, HR 2.003), and treatment response after the first 
TACE treatment (HR 0.680) were associated with overall survival.
CONCLUSIONS: MDVA is a critical prognostic factor for predicting survival in the 
elderly patients with HCC who have undergone TACE.

BACKGROUND: Despite global recommendations that brief, task-shared interventions 
are effective for addressing problematic alcohol use in primary health care 
(PHC), low-income countries have made few attempts to implement and scale-up 
these interventions.
AIM: To explore perspectives and experiences of service users and providers on a 
brief intervention (BI) for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) delivered by 
nonspecialist health workers who are health officers and clinical nurses in PHC 
in a rural Ethiopian district.
METHODS: The study team conducted a qualitative study, comprising in-depth 
interviews with 26 purposively selected participants. The participants were 14 
people who had been screened for probable AUD and were receiving the brief 
intervention; four caregivers without any intervention; and eight nonspecialist 
health workers who provided a single session brief intervention at four primary 
care health centers in Sodo district, south Ethiopia. The study used framework 
analysis. We grouped findings into five themes: acceptability, engagement in and 
barriers to care, implementation of the service, perceived impact of the BI, and 
unmet needs and expectations.
RESULTS: Participants perceived the intervention to be useful, and it was 
well-accepted by most service users and relatives. Participants reported 
reductions in alcohol consumption and benefits in terms of their capacity to 
work, increased earnings, less money wasted, and ability to provide for their 
families. However, most did not attend follow-up visits, often influenced by the 
belief that they did not have a serious problem and could handle it alone. Some 
did not believe AUDs to be treatable; others did not attend because of lack of 
money for transportation and stigma from peers. Providing BI did not affect PHC 
workers' routine work. However, they noticed a reluctance from people with 
probable AUD to speak openly about their drinking, and they were constrained by 
a shortage of space. They recommended training and involvement from community 
members, leaders, and health extension workers to raise awareness, increase 
acceptability, refer cases, and reduce stigma.
CONCLUSION: The brief intervention that nonspecialist health workers in PHC 
delivered was acceptable, feasible, and perceived to have positive benefits. To 
extend the impact of the intervention, the community needs to be involved to 
address low awareness and to tackle stigma.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Upregulation of hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 
with accumulation of potentially toxic heme precursors delta-aminolevulinic acid 
and porphobilinogen is fundamental to the pathogenesis of acute hepatic 
porphyria.
AIMS: evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of givosiran in acute hepatic 
porphyria.
METHODS: Interim analysis of ongoing ENVISION study (NCT03338816), after all 
active patients completed their Month 24 visit. Patients with acute hepatic 
porphyria (≥12 years) with recurrent attacks received givosiran (2.5 mg/kg 
monthly) (n = 48) or placebo (n = 46) for 6 months (double-blind period); 93 
received givosiran (2.5 mg or 1.25 mg/kg monthly) in the open-label extension 
(continuous givosiran, n = 47/48; placebo crossover, n = 46/46). Endpoints 
included annualized attack rate, urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid and 
porphobilinogen levels, hemin use, daily worst pain, quality of life, and 
adverse events.
RESULTS: Patients receiving continuous givosiran had sustained annualized attack 
rate reduction (median 1.0 in double-blind period, 0.0 in open-label extension); 
in placebo crossover patients, median annualized attack rate decreased from 10.7 
to 1.4. Median annualized days of hemin use were 0.0 (double-blind period) and 
0.0 (open-label extension) for continuous givosiran patients and reduced from 
14.98 to 0.71 for placebo crossover patients. Long-term givosiran led to 
sustained lowering of delta-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen and 
improvements in daily worst pain and quality of life. Safety findings were 
consistent with the double-blind period.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term givosiran has an acceptable safety profile and 
significantly benefits acute hepatic porphyria patients with recurrent attacks 
by reducing attack frequency, hemin use, and severity of daily worst pain while 
improving quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Maternal behaviors and exposures affect fetal growth and 
development. Smoking, malnutrition, sedentary behavior, and stress can each lead 
to fetal programming and intra-uterine growth restriction. As a result, tissue 
development may be impaired. Problems with muscle formation can lead to 
reductions in muscle performance throughout life. The purpose of this study was 
to determine if in utero effects on muscle mass, muscle function, or both are 
responsible for the relationship between size at birth and adult muscle 
strength.
STUDY DESIGN: One hundred adults (ages 18-40), who were singletons born at term 
(37-42 weeks), participated. Birth weight was adjusted for gestational age using 
neonatal growth reference data. Maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of dominant 
and non-dominant handgrip, and right and left leg extension were measured. 
Linear regression analysis was used to determine the association between 
adjusted birth weight and muscle strength. Sex and lean body mass were 
covariates.
RESULTS: Dominant handgrip MVC increased by 1.533 kg per 1 SD increase in 
adjusted birth weight (p = 0.004). Lean body mass had a significant indirect 
effect on this relationship. The relationship between handgrip strength and 
adjusted birth weight was strongest among female subjects. No other muscle 
strength measures were significantly associated with adjusted birth weight.
CONCLUSIONS: Birth size was a significant predictor of handgrip strength in 
adulthood. Including lean body mass attenuated, but did not remove, the 
association. Thus, among individuals born to term, having a 
smaller-than-predicted birth size likely causes both reductions in muscle mass 
formation and decreased muscle function, ultimately impacting muscle strength in 
adulthood.

BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are prevalent and cause considerable burden of 
disease. Exercise has been shown to be efficacious to treat major depressive 
disorders, insomnia, panic disorder with and without agoraphobia and post 
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
METHODS: This pragmatic, two arm, multi-site randomised controlled trial will 
evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the manualized, group-based 
six-months exercise intervention "ImPuls", among physically inactive patients 
with major depressive disorders, insomnia, panic disorder, agoraphobia and PTSD 
within a naturalistic outpatient context in Germany. A minimum of 375 eligible 
outpatients from 10 different study sites will be block-randomized to either 
ImPuls in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU only. ImPuls will be 
conducted by trained exercise therapists and delivered in groups of six 
patients. The program will combine (a) moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise 
carried out two-three times a week for at least 30 min with (b) behavior change 
techniques for sustained exercise behavior change. All outcomes will be assessed 
pre-treatment, post-treatment (six months after randomization) and at follow-up 
(12 months after randomization). Primary outcome will be self-reported global 
symptom severity assessed with the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18). Secondary 
outcomes will be accelerometry-based moderate to vigorous physical activity, 
self-reported exercise, disorder-specific symptoms, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY) and healthcare costs. Intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted using 
mixed models. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis will be conducted 
using incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios.
DISCUSSION: Despite its promising therapeutic effects, exercise programs are 
currently not provided within the outpatient mental health care system in 
Germany. This trial will inform service providers and policy makers about the 
efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the group-based exercise intervention ImPuls 
within a naturalistic outpatient health care setting. Group-based exercise 
interventions might provide an option to close the treatment gap within 
outpatient mental health care settings.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in the German Clinical Trials 
Register (ID: DRKS00024152 , 05/02/2021).

Sulfated exopolysaccharides (EPS) from Porphyridium cruentum strain were 
extracted and their antioxidant and anti-bacterial potentials were evaluated 
based on DPPH free radical, ABTS•+ radical cation and DNA nicking assays, and 
against four foodborne pathogenic bacteria, respectively. They showed also 
interesting functional, foaming and emulsion properties. Moreover, 
microbiological and chemical effects of EPS at 0.5, 1 and 2% on refrigerated 
minced beef meat were undertaken. Chemical analyses revealed that the treated 
meat underwent significant decrease (P < 0.05) of primary and secondary lipid 
oxidation. By the end of the storage period, exopolysaccharides at 2% reduced 
the metmyoglobin and carbonyl group accumulation compared to control samples and 
were more efficient (P < 0.05) against microflora proliferation. Furthermore, 
two multivariate exploratory techniques namely Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were applied successfully to all 
obtained data describing the main characteristics attributed to refrigerated 
meat samples. Overall, these findings indicated that EPS from P. cruentum are 
worthy being developed as functional and bioactive components for the meat 
industry.
