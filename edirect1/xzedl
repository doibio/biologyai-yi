AIM OF THE STUDY: To compare the outcomes of three knee arthroplasty design 
philosophies and surface tribology.• A zirconium-surfaced, bicruciate-stabilised 
implant designed to mimic kinematic movement and improve flexion and outcomes;• 
A cobalt-chrome surfaced, multi-radius design with built-in femoral external 
rotation to aid balancing and patella tracking through a deeper trochlea 
groove;• A zirconium-surfaced, single-radius implant designed on surface 
conformity, particularly within the patello-femoral joint.
METHODS: 313 knee replacements - 103 Journey II, 103 Genesis II and 107 Profix - 
were statistically assessed at a minimum of 2 years using WOMAC, Oxford and 
SF-12 scores, and range of movement.
RESULTS: There was no difference between the actual or unit change in WOMAC 
scores (p = 0.140 and p = 0.287), SF-12 physical (p = 0.088) or mental scores (p 
= 0.975) between the three implants; or between the actual or unit change in 
Oxford score (p = 0.912 and p = 0.874) for the Journey II or Genesis II. The 
Journey II produced more flexion and range of movement than the Genesis II (p < 
0.001 and p = 0.018) and Profix (p < 0.001 and <0.001) with no difference 
between the latter two (p = 0.402 and 0.568); with no difference in extension 
between the three implants (p = 0.086). There was no difference between those 
with or without a resurfaced patella.
CONCLUSION: The three design philosophies and surfaces yielded no difference in 
outcome scores at 2 years post-operatively. The Journey II demonstrated better 
post-operative flexion. Resurfacing the patella did not alter the outcome scores 
or flexion.

BACKGROUND: Despite the persistent increase in overdose deaths, access to 
medications for opioid use disorders remains limited. Recent federal funding 
aimed at increasing access prompts a need to understand if implementation 
strategies improve access.
METHODS: This is an analysis of data from 174 primary care clinics enrolled in a 
state-wide medications for opioid use disorders (MOUD) implementation effort in 
California. We examined clinic use of one of four implementation strategies: 
learning collaboratives, Project Extension for Community Health care Outcomes 
(ECHO), didactic webinars, and clinical skills trainings. The primary 
implementation outcome was categorical change in new patients prescribed 
buprenorphine. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to 
determine the impact of clinic attendance in all or individual implementation 
strategies, respectively, on patient growth.
RESULTS: Clinics attending learning collaboratives, Project ECHO, and clinical 
skills trainings had significantly higher odds of patient growth (odds ratio 
[OR] = 3.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.78, 7.10, p < .001), (OR = 3.39; 
95% CI = 1.59, 7.24, p < .01), (OR = 3.90, 95% CI = 1.64, 9.23, p < .01) than 
non-attending clinics. The impact of attendance at learning collaboratives 
(OR = 5.81, 95% CI = 1.89, 17.85; p < .01), didactic webinars (OR = 3.59; 95% 
CI = 1.04, 12.35; p < .05), and clinical skills trainings (OR = 3.53, 95% 
CI = 1.06, 11.78, p < .05) on patient growth was greater for Federally Qualified 
Health Centers. When comparing strategies in multivariate models, only the 
relationship between learning collaborative attendance and new patients 
prescribed buprenorphine remained significant (OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.12, 5.88; 
p < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study reported on a large, statewide, implementation-as-usual 
project offering four typical implementation strategies. Clinic attendance at 
learning collaboratives, a multi-component strategy, had the most consistent 
impact on new patients prescribed buprenorphine. These results suggest that 
while a broad array of strategies was initially reasonable, optimizing the 
selection of implementation strategies could be more effective.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Access to life-saving medications for opioid use 
disorder, such as buprenorphine, remains limited despite strong evidence of 
effectiveness. Systems and organizations often select from a variety of 
implementation strategies aimed at expanding access to these medications. 
However, scant research exists to enable these organizations to select the most 
effective and efficient strategies. Our study-within a large state-wide system 
of care-examined the impact of primary care clinic attendance in four common 
implementation strategies on new patients prescribed buprenorphine. Learning 
collaboratives were the strategy that most consistently improved outcomes. These 
results highlight the challenges to strategy selection inherent in 
implementation-as-usual systems-level approaches. The field needs evidence-based 
information on which implementation strategies are most likely to yield desired 
implementation outcomes.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes endothelial damage, blood stasis, and 
an overall state of hypercoagulability. This makes COVID a huge risk factor for 
venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thromboembolism (ATE). Twenty percent 
of COVID-19 patients suffer from coagulation abnormalities like pulmonary 
embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, etc. Ovarian vein 
thrombosis (OVT) has been previously linked to post-partum period, pregnancy, 
hypercoagulable state, or malignancy. We analyzed PubMed and Google Scholar 
databases for research and publications regarding OVT in patients with COVID-19. 
The search yielded nine case reports. These case reports were found to implicate 
COVID-associated coagulopathy (CAC) as an additional risk factor for ovarian 
vein thrombosis (OVT). OVT most commonly presents with abdominal pain and fever, 
making it difficult to diagnose, owing to the similarity in presentation with 
multiple other pathologies. OVT can be diagnosed radiologically with ultrasound, 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or CT scan with IV contrast. CT has been 
used as the modality of choice for diagnosing OVT. Although rare, OVT can cause 
life-endangering complications by extension of thrombus into systemic veins or 
pulmonary artery embolization. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are 
vital. There is no official guideline for the treatment of OVT post-COVID. 
However, the literature supports the use of apixaban or 
enoxaparin/acenocoumarol.

BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed to prevent and 
treat upper gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding. Studies have identified 
increased incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatic 
encephalopathy (HE) in cirrhosis patients taking PPIs. However, results are 
conflicting, and as PPIs are prescribed for variceal bleeding, a major risk 
factor for infection and HE, it is challenging to discern whether these 
associations are causal.
METHODS: In this post-hoc analysis of the ATTIRE trial, we pooled all patient 
data to investigate the effects of PPI use on clinical outcomes. ATTIRE was a 
multicentre, open-label, randomised trial of targeted 20% human albumin solution 
(HAS) daily infusions versus standard care involving 777 adults with 
decompensated cirrhosis hospitalised with acute complications and albumin 
<30 g/L. Study recruitment was between Jan 25, 2016, and June 28, 2019, at 35 
hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales. Key exclusion criteria were 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with life expectancy <8 weeks and patients 
receiving palliative care. In ATTIRE, patients were grouped by PPI use at trial 
entry. We studied infection and HE at baseline and incidence of hospital 
acquired infection, new onset HE, renal dysfunction and mortality. We attempted 
with propensity score matching to account for differences in disease severity.
FINDINGS: Overall PPI use at baseline was not associated with increased 
incidence of infection, renal dysfunction or mortality, but was associated with 
significantly increased incidence of grade III/IV HE during hospital stay 
(P = 0.011). This was only significant for those taking intravenous PPIs and 
these patients had >10 times the incidence of variceal bleeding and near double 
the 28-day mortality compared to non-PPI patients. However, propensity score 
matching was not possible as there was such a strong selection of patients for 
PPI use, that we could not find sufficient non-PPI patients to match to. We 
found no impact of PPI use on plasma markers of bacterial translocation, 
infection or systemic inflammation.
INTERPRETATIONS: Our real-world data from a completed randomised trial show that 
PPIs are widely prescribed in the UK and judicious use appears safe in patients 
hospitalised with decompensated cirrhosis. However, patients prescribed PPIs had 
fundamentally different phenotypes to those not prescribed PPIs, a form of 
confounding by indication, which should be strongly considered when interpreting 
studies and making recommendations about their use.

Aging is associated with a decline in the regenerative potential of stem cells. 
In recent years, several clinical trials have been launched in order to evaluate 
the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell interventions to slow or reverse normal 
aging processes (aging conditions). Information concerning those clinical trials 
was extracted from national and international databases (United States, EU, 
China, Japan, and World Health Organization). Mesenchymal stem cell preparations 
were in development for two main aging conditions: physical frailty and facial 
skin aging. With regard to physical frailty, positive results have been obtained 
in phase II studies with intravenous Lomecel-B (an allogeneic bone marrow stem 
cell preparation), and a phase I/II study with an allogeneic preparation of 
umbilical cord-derived stem cells was recently completed. With regard to facial 
skin aging, positive results have been obtained with an autologous preparation 
of adipose-derived stem cells. A further sixteen clinical trials for physical 
frailty and facial skin aging are currently underway. Reducing physical frailty 
with intravenous mesenchymal stem cell administration can increase healthy life 
expectancy and decrease costs to the public health system. However, intravenous 
administration runs the risk of entrapment of the stem cells in the lungs (and 
could raise safety concerns). In addition to aesthetic purposes, clinical 
research on facial skin aging allows direct evaluation of tissue regeneration 
using sophisticated and precise methods. Therefore, research on both conditions 
is complementary, which facilitates a global vision.

Defects in blood development frequently occur among syndromic congenital 
anomalies. Thrombocytopenia-Absent Radius (TAR) Syndrome is a rare congenital 
condition with reduced platelets (hypomegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia) and 
forelimb anomalies, concurrent with more variable heart and kidney defects. TAR 
syndrome associates with hypomorphic gene function for RBM8A/Y14 that encodes a 
component of the exon junction complex involved in mRNA splicing, transport, and 
nonsense-mediated decay. How perturbing a general mRNA-processing factor causes 
the selective TAR Syndrome phenotypes remains unknown. Here, we connect 
zebrafish rbm8a perturbation to early hematopoietic defects via attenuated 
non-canonical Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling that controls 
developmental cell arrangements. In hypomorphic rbm8a zebrafish, we observe a 
significant reduction of cd41-positive thrombocytes. rbm8a-mutant zebrafish 
embryos accumulate mRNAs with individual retained introns, a hallmark of 
defective nonsense-mediated decay; affected mRNAs include transcripts for 
non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway components. We establish that rbm8a-mutant embryos 
show convergent extension defects and that reduced rbm8a function interacts with 
perturbations in non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway genes wnt5b, wnt11f2, fzd7a, and 
vangl2. Using live-imaging, we found reduced rbm8a function impairs the 
architecture of the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) that forms hematopoietic, 
cardiovascular, kidney, and forelimb skeleton progenitors as affected in TAR 
Syndrome. Both mutants for rbm8a and for the PCP gene vangl2 feature impaired 
expression of early hematopoietic/endothelial genes including runx1 and the 
megakaryocyte regulator gfi1aa. Together, our data propose aberrant LPM 
patterning and hematopoietic defects as possible consequence of attenuated 
non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling upon reduced rbm8a function. These results link 
TAR Syndrome to a potential LPM origin and developmental mechanism.

Sensory signals are processed by the cerebellum to coordinate movements. 
Numerous cerebellar functions are thought to require the maintenance of a 
sensory representation that extends beyond the input signal. Granule cells 
receive sensory input, but they do not prolong the signal and are thus unlikely 
to maintain a sensory representation for much longer than the inputs themselves. 
Unipolar brush cells (UBCs) are excitatory interneurons that project to granule 
cells and transform sensory input into prolonged increases or decreases in 
firing, depending on their ON or OFF UBC subtype. Further extension and 
diversification of the input signal could be produced by UBCs that project to 
one another, but whether this circuitry exists is unclear. Here we test whether 
UBCs innervate one another and explore how these small networks of UBCs could 
transform spiking patterns. We characterized two transgenic mouse lines 
electrophysiologically and immunohistochemically to confirm that they label ON 
and OFF UBC subtypes and crossed them together, revealing that ON and OFF UBCs 
innervate one another. A Brainbow reporter was used to label UBCs of the same ON 
or OFF subtype with different fluorescent proteins, which showed that UBCs 
innervate their own subtypes as well. Computational models predict that these 
feed-forward networks of UBCs extend the length of bursts or pauses and 
introduce delays-transformations that may be necessary for cerebellar functions 
from modulation of eye movements to adaptive learning across time scales.

Introduction: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder that 
induces progressive muscular degeneration. Currently, the increase in DMD 
individuals' life expectancy is not being matched by an increase in quality of 
life. The functioning of the hand and wrist is central for performing daily 
activities and for providing a higher degree of independence. Active 
exoskeletons can assist this functioning but require the accurate decoding of 
the users' motor intention. These methods have, however, never been 
systematically analyzed in the context of DMD. Methods: This case study 
evaluated direct control (DC) and pattern recognition (PR), combined with an 
admittance model. This enabled customization of myoelectric controllers to one 
DMD individual and to a control population of ten healthy participants during a 
target-reaching task in 1- and 2- degrees of freedom (DOF). We quantified 
real-time myocontrol performance using target reaching times and compared the 
differences between the healthy individuals and the DMD individual. Results and 
Discussion: Our findings suggest that despite the muscle tissue degeneration, 
the myocontrol performance of the DMD individual was comparable to that of the 
healthy individuals in both DOFs and with both control approaches. It was also 
evident that PR control performed better for the 2-DOF tasks for both DMD and 
healthy participants, while DC performed better for the 1-DOF tasks. The 
insights gained from this study can lead to further developments for the 
intuitive multi-DOF myoelectric control of active hand exoskeletons for 
individuals with DMD.

The aim of focal treatments (FTs) in prostate cancer (PCa) is to treat lesions 
while preserving surrounding benign tissue and anatomic structures. Irreversible 
electroporation (IRE) is a nonthermal technique that uses high-voltage electric 
pulses to increase membrane permeability and induce membrane disruption in 
cells, which potentially causes less damage to the surrounding tissue in 
comparison to other ablative techniques. We summarize the study protocol for the 
Prostate Cancer IRE Study (PRIS), which involves two parallel randomized 
controlled trials comparing IRE with (1) robot-assisted radical prostatectomy 
(RARP) or (2) radiotherapy in men with newly diagnosed intermediate-risk PCa 
(NCT05513443). To reduce the number of patients for inclusion and the study 
duration, the primary outcomes are functional outcomes: urinary incontinence in 
study 1 and irritative urinary symptoms in study 2. Providing evidence of the 
lower impact of IRE on functional outcomes will lay a foundation for the design 
of future multicenter studies with an oncological outcome as the primary 
endpoint. Erectile function, quality of life, treatment failure, adverse events, 
and cost effectiveness will be evaluated as secondary objectives. Patients 
diagnosed with Gleason score 3 + 4 or 4 + 3 PCa from a single lesion visible on 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without any Gleason grade 4 or higher in 
systematic biopsies outside of the target (unifocal significant disease), aged 
≥40 yr, with no established extraprostatic extension on multiparametric MRI, a 
lesion volume of <1.5 cm3, prostate-specific antigen <20 ng/ml, and stage ≤T2b 
are eligible for inclusion. The study plan is to recruit 184 men.

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecological malignancy in developed 
countries. Over 382,000 new cases were diagnosed worldwide in 2018, and its 
incidence and mortality are constantly rising due to longer life expectancy and 
life style factors including obesity. Two major improvements are needed in the 
management of patients with endometrial cancer, i.e., the development of 
non/minimally invasive tools for diagnostics and prognostics, which are 
currently missing. Diagnostic tools are needed to manage the increasing number 
of women at risk of developing the disease. Prognostic tools are necessary to 
stratify patients according to their risk of recurrence pre-preoperatively, to 
advise and plan the most appropriate treatment and avoid over/under-treatment. 
Biomarkers derived from proteomics and metabolomics, especially when derived 
from non/minimally-invasively collected body fluids, can serve to develop such 
prognostic and diagnostic tools, and the purpose of the present review is to 
explore the current research in this topic. We first provide a brief description 
of the technologies, the computational pipelines for data analyses and then we 
provide a systematic review of all published studies using proteomics and/or 
metabolomics for diagnostic and prognostic biomarker discovery in endometrial 
cancer. Finally, conclusions and recommendations for future studies are also 
given.

Mind the gender gap: The social neuroscience of belonging.

Neurodevelopment, Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom.

Gender gaps persist in the 21st century, in many aspects of society and in many 
types of organisation. There are earnings gaps in almost all domains, reports of 
glass ceilings and the "missing middle" in business, finance, law and politics, 
and dramatic under-representation of women in many branches of science, even in 
the most "gender equal" countries. This is despite decades of effort to address 
them, including targeted legislation and many Diversity and Inclusion 
initiatives. Early essentialist, competence-based explanations for the existence 
of gender gaps have been largely discredited at the research level, although 
their persistence in the public consciousness and at the level of education and 
training can still negatively bias both individual self-belief and 
organisational processes. Contemporary essentialist explanations are now 
emerging, with claims that such gaps are the manifestations of the presence or 
absence of endogenous, brain-based characteristics underpinning career 
progression or career preferences. The focus remains on the individual as the 
source of gender imbalances. Less attention has been paid to the contextual 
aspects of organisations where gender gaps are evident, to inclusion (or the 
lack of it), or the availability of unbiased reward and progression pathways. 
Advances in 21st century social cognitive neuroscience are revealing the 
importance of external organisational processes as powerful brain-changing 
forces, with their potentially negative impact on self-belief and a sense of 
belonging. Key research is demonstrating the cortical and behavioural 
consequences of negative social experiences, with the activation of core 
inhibitory pathways associated with low self-esteem, lack of engagement, and 
eventual withdrawal. This paper will argue that reference to such research will 
provide better explanations for the persistence of gender gaps, and offer 
evidence-based insights into addressing gender gap issues. Importantly, this is 
not a rejection of an endogenous, brain-based explanation for gender gaps but 
the elaboration of a better-informed 21st century model, flagging up the need to 
take factors such as cultural stereotyping and organisational bias into account 
in any drive toward true gender equity, or genuinely levelled playing fields.

The optimal dose of physical activity and best types of exercise for improving 
cardiovascular (CV) durability and optimizing longevity are unknown. The purpose 
of this article is to review the recent literature on the effects of duration 
and intensity of exercise, physical fitness, and specific types of 
training/sports on long-term CV health and life expectancy. A systematic review 
of recent studies (2011 to 2022) was conducted using PubMed. Studies were 
included if they addressed the topic of fitness and/or exercise dose/type and CV 
health and/or life expectancy. Epidemiological studies show that 
cardiorespiratory fitness (is inversely related to risk of all-cause mortality, 
with no increased mortality risk in the most fit cohort. Being unfit is among 
most potent risk factors for all-cause mortality. Moderate PA (MPA) and vigorous 
PA (VPA) were associated with reduced CV and all-cause mortality in a recent 
definitive study. Paradoxically, high doses of MPA reduced both CV and all-cause 
mortality better than did high doses of VPA. A large meta-analysis showed that 
strength training was independently associated with lower rates of all-cause 
mortality and CV disease, though the best outcomes were associated with a 
cumulative dose of about 60 minutes/week. Physical interactive play is strongly 
associated with improved life expectancy. Physical fitness is a key determinant 
of CV health and life expectancy. Moderate to vigorous exercise, strength 
training and interactive sports are associated with improved life expectancy. 
Very large volumes of strenuous exercise and/or weightlifting may not be the 
ideal for optimizing longevity.

Advances in healthcare and improvements in living conditions have led to rising 
life expectancy worldwide. Aging is associated with excessive oxidative stress, 
a chronic inflammatory state, and limited tissue healing, all of which result in 
an increased risk of heart failure. In fact, the prevalence of heart failure 
approaches 40% in the ninth decade of life, with the majority of these cases 
suffering from heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In 
cardiomyocytes (CMs), age-related mitochondrial dysfunction results in disrupted 
calcium signaling and covalent protein-linked aggregates, which cause 
cardiomyocyte functional disturbances, resulting in increased stiffness and 
diastolic dysfunction. Importantly, aging is also associated with chronic 
low-grade, sterile inflammation, which alters the function of interstitial 
cardiac cells and leads to cardiac fibrosis. Taken together, cardiac aging is 
associated with cellular, structural, and functional changes in the heart that 
contribute to the rising prevalence of heart failure in older people.

We appraised the relationship between the biological and the chronological age 
and estimated the rate of biological aging in HIV-infected patients. Two 
independent biomarkers, the relative telomere length and iron metabolism 
parameters, were analyzed in younger (<35) and older (>50) HIV-infected and 
uninfected patients (control group). In our control group, telomeres of younger 
patients were significantly longer than telomeres of older ones. However, in 
HIV-infected participants, the difference in the length of telomeres was lost. 
By combining the length of telomeres with serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin 
iron-binding capacity, a new formula for determination of the aging process was 
developed. The life expectancy of the healthy population was related to their 
biological age, and HIV-infected patients were biologically older. The effect of 
antiretroviral HIV drug therapies varied with respect to the biological aging 
process. IMPORTANCE This article is focused on the dynamics of human aging. 
Moreover, its interdisciplinary approach is applicable to various systems that 
are aging.

and abdominal hernia from 1990 to 2019: findings from the 2019 Global Burden of 
Disease Study - a cross-sectional study.

BACKGROUND: Inguinal, femoral, and abdominal hernia repairs are the most common 
surgical procedure worldwide. However, studies on hernia disease burden are 
notably limited, in both developed and low-income and middle-income countries 
(LMICs). We investigated temporal trends in the incidence and prevalence of 
inguinal, femoral, and abdominal hernias at global, regional, and national 
levels in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019 using data from the 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 (GBD 2019).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Annual incident cases, prevalent cases, age-standardized 
incidence rates (ASIRs), and age-standardized prevalence rates (ASPRs) of 
inguinal, femoral, and abdominal hernias between 1990 and 2019 were extracted 
from the GBD 2019 study and stratified by sex, age, and location. Percentage 
changes in incident cases and prevalent cases, and the estimated annual 
percentage changes of ASIRs and ASPRs were calculated to quantify the trends in 
the incidence and prevalence of inguinal, femoral, and abdominal hernias. Data 
analysis for the present study was conducted from 15 June 2022 to 15 July 2022.
RESULTS: Globally, there were 32.53 million [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 
27.71-37.79] prevalent cases and 13.02 million (10.68-15.49) incident cases of 
inguinal, femoral, and abdominal hernias in 2019, which increased by 36.00% and 
63.67%, respectively, compared with 1990. Eighty-six percent of the incident 
cases were males, the male-to-female ratio was 6 : 1, and most patients were 
aged 50-69 years. India (2.45 million), China (1.95 million), and Brazil (0.71 
million) accounted for more than one-third (39%) of the incident cases 
worldwide. From 1990 to 2019, the ASIR and ASPR showed a decreasing trend 
worldwide, except in Central Sub-Saharan Africa, which had an increasing trend 
in ASIR and ASPR.
CONCLUSION: The global incident cases and prevalent cases of inguinal, femoral, 
and abdominal hernias increased substantially from 1990 to 2019, with a heavier 
burden observed in males, older adults, and in LMICs such as India and China. In 
addition, the ASIR and ASPR increased substantially in Central Sub-Saharan 
Africa. More efforts are warranted for hernia management to reduce the burden of 
inguinal, femoral, and abdominal hernias, such as by providing safe hernia 
surgical treatment for males, older adults, and LMICs.

BACKGROUND: We projected global trends in ischemic stroke from 2020 to 2030 
according to age, sex, and socio-demographic index (SDI) quintile.
METHODS: Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were used to project trends 
in the incidence of deaths from and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due 
to ischemic stroke between 2020 and 2030. EAPCs were computed using generalized 
additive models and data from the Global Burden of Disease study during the 1990 
to 2019 period.
RESULTS: The global age-standardized incidence rate of ischemic stroke was 
projected to increase to 89.32 per 100 000 population in 2030 (EAPC=0.89), 
whereas the associated global age-standardized death and DALY rates were 
projected to decrease to 18.28 (EAPC, -3.58) and 500.37 per 100 000 
(EAPC=-1.75), respectively, in 2030. The projections indicated a higher 
age-standardized incidence rate of ischemic stroke among women than among men in 
2030 (90.70 versus 87.64 per 100 000). The incidence rate of ischemic stroke was 
projected to increase across all age groups and SDI quintiles between 2020 and 
2030. At the national level, the greatest increase in the age-standardized 
incidence rate of ischemic stroke between 2020 and 2030 was projected to occur 
in Cyprus (EAPC=4.16), followed by Palestine (EAPC=3.50) and South Africa 
(EAPC=2.64). Additionally, the projections suggested increases in the 
age-standardized death and DALY rates due to ischemic stroke for countries in 
low-SDI quintiles (EAPC=3.68 and EAPC=5.30, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The projections indicated that the incidence rate of ischemic 
stroke will increase both sexes, all age groups, and all SDI quintiles and in 
some countries between 2020 and 2030. Furthermore, countries with a low SDI 
should be aware of potential increases in the age-standardized death and DALY 
due to ischemic stroke.

[Differences due to socio-economic status, genetic background and sex in cancer 
and precision medicine - An intersectional approach to close the care gap for 
marginalized groups].

[Article in German]

Engelhardt M, Brioli A, von Lilienfeld-Toal M.

Malignant tumor diseases constitute the 2nd most common cause of death and due 
to our extended life expectancy cancer per se has substantially increased, being 
highly prevalent after cardiovascular diseases. Evidence also generated from the 
COVID-19 pandemic, that defined gender differences exist in symptom and disease 
courses, and have advocated the need to assess gender, ethnic/racial and 
minority differences in cancer care and treatment more meticulously. It is 
becoming increasingly evident that in novel cancer care/precision oncology, 
representation of minorities, elderly and frail patients in clinical trials 
remains largely unbalanced, thus distribution of cancer success is iniquitous. 
This article focusses on these aspects and suggests solutions, how this can be 
improved.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a widespread disease in women worldwide.
AIM: We aimed to explore the global epidemiological trends of female breast 
cancer (FBC) between 1990 and 2044.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Disease burden, population, and socio-demographic index 
(SDI) data were obtained from the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) database. 
We analyzed temporal trends, age differences, risk factors, and geographic 
patterns of FBC disease burden globally and explored the association between 
age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of FBC and SDI. Bayesian 
age-period-cohort model was also performed to predict the changes in FBC 
incidence worldwide from 2020 to 2044. First, the global ASIR of FBC increased 
by 14.31% from 1990 to 2019 (95% Uncertainty Interval 4.75% to 23.98%). The 
death rate presented a falling trend. Second, alcohol use is the 
most-highlighted risk factor for FBC in some high-income regions such as Europe. 
A high fasting plasma glucose levels is the most prominent risk factor for FBC 
in Latin America and Africa. Third, the ASIR of the FBC increases with the SDI. 
Fourth, the incidence is expected to increase faster among women aged 
35-60 years and fastest for those aged 50-54 years from 2020 to 2044. Countries 
with a high incidence of FBC that is expected to increase significantly include 
Barbados, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Monaco, Lebanon, Togo, and Uganda.
CONCLUSION: The disease burden of FBC varies worldwide; the findings suggest 
attaching importance to the control of middle and low-middle SDI regions. Public 
health as well as cancer prevention experts should pay more attention to regions 
and populations at an increased risk of developing FBC, focusing on their 
prevention and rehabilitation while conducting further epidemiological studies 
to investigate the risk factors of their increase.

Obesity contributes to the progression of various chronic diseases, and shortens 
life expectancy. With abundant mitochondria, brown adipose tissue (BAT) 
dissipates energy through heat to limit weight gain and metabolic dysfunction in 
obesity. Our previous studies have shown that aurantio-obtusin (AO), a bioactive 
ingredient in Chinese traditional medicine Cassiae semen significantly improves 
hepatic lipid metabolism in a steatotic mouse model. In the current study we 
investigated the effects of AO on lipid metabolism in the BAT of diet-induced 
obesity mice and in oleic acid and palmitic acid (OAPA)-stimulated primary 
mature BAT adipocytes. Obese mice were established by feeding a HFHS diet for 4 
weeks, and then administered AO (10 mg/kg, i.g.) for another 4 weeks. We showed 
that AO administration significantly increased the weight of BAT and accelerated 
energy expenditure to protect the weight increase in the obese mice. Using RNA 
sequencing and molecular biology analysis we found that AO significantly 
enhanced mitochondrial metabolism and UCP1 expression by activating PPARα both 
in vivo and in vitro in the primary BAT adipocytes. Interestingly, AO 
administration did not improve metabolic dysfunction in the liver and white 
adipose tissue of obese mice after interscapular BAT excision. We demonstrated 
that low temperature, a trigger of BAT thermogenesis, was not a decisive factor 
for AO to stimulate the growth and activation of BATs. This study uncovers a 
regulatory network of AO in activating BAT-dependent lipid consumption and 
brings up a new avenue for the pharmaceutical intervention in obesity and 
related comorbidities.
