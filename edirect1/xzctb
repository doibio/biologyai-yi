were 0.51% for ABI + PRD, 0.27% for CAB + PRD, and 14.47% for ENZ. LYs and QALYs 
were 1.20 and 0.58 respectively for ABI + PRD, 1.48 and 0.56 for CAB + PRD, and 
1.58 and 0.79 for ENZ. Total treatment costs were: $115,433 for ABI + PRD, 
$85,337 for CAB + PRD and $109,213 for ENZ. CAB + PRD and ENZ dominated 
ABI + PRD due to higher LYs gained. Incremental QALYs for ENZ vs. CAB + PRD were 
larger than incremental LYs. The ICUR for ENZ was $103,674/QALY compared to 
CAB + PRD. Conclusions: This analysis found ENZ provided greater LYs and QALYs 
than both ABI + PRD and CAB + PRD, at a lower cost than ABI + PRD, but at a 
higher cost compared to CAB + PRD. For patients with visceral mCRPC after 
docetaxel therapy resistance, ENZ was cost-effective 92% of the time with a WTP 
threshold of $100,000/QALY.

BACKGROUND: There is growing empirical evidence supporting theories of 
developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD). However, the implications 
of DOHaD conjectures for aggregate population patterns of human disease, 
disability, mortality and aging are poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: We empirically test two predictions derived from a formal model of 
aggregate population-level impacts of DOHaD. This model predicts that 
populations potentially influenced by delayed effects should experience 
singularities in their adult mortality patterns that can be empirically detected 
from aggregate data.
METHODS: We test predictions using a large mortality database for populations in 
the Latin American and Caribbean region (LAC) spanning nearly one hundred years 
of mortality history.
RESULTS: Results are consistent. within explicit bounds of uncertainty, with 
expected patterns. We find that younger cohorts in countries whose mortality 
decline starts more recently experience deceleration in survival gains at older 
ages, attenuation of the rate of aging at older ages and a decline in the 
association between early childhood and adult mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Results point to the importance of adverse early conditions for 
human longevity. Future research should shed light on the impact on morbidity, 
disability and healthy life expectancy.
CONTRIBUTION: To our knowledge this is the first time that implications of DOHaD 
conjectures for populations' mortality patterns are formulated precisely and 
empirically tested with aggregate population data.

IMPORTANCE: There are substantial and increasing educational differences in US 
adult life expectancy. To reduce social inequalities in mortality, it is 
important to understand how specific causes of death have contributed to 
increasing educational differences in adult life expectancy in recent years.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the relationship of specific causes of death with 
increasing educational differences in adult life expectancy from 2010 to 2017.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Serial cross-sectional study of 4 690 729 
deaths recorded in the US National Vital Statistics System in 2010 and 2017.
EXPOSURES: Sex, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Life expectancy at age 25 years and years of life 
lost between ages 25 and 84 years by cause of death.
RESULTS: The analysis included a total of 2 211 633 deaths in 2010 and 2 479 096 
deaths in 2017. Between 2010 and 2017, life expectancy at age 25 significantly 
declined among white and black non-Hispanic US residents from an expected age at 
death of 79.34 to 79.15 years (difference, -0.18 [95% CI, -0.23 to -0.14]). 
Greater decreases were observed among persons with a high school degree or less 
(white men: -1.05 years [95% CI, -1.15 to -0.94], white women: -1.14 years [95% 
CI, -1.24 to -1.04], and black men: -0.30 years [95% CI, -0.56 to -0.04]). White 
adults with some college education but no 4-year college degree experienced 
similar declines in life expectancy (men: -0.89 years [95% CI, -1.07 to -0.73], 
women: -0.59 years [95% CI, -0.77 to -0.42]). In contrast, life expectancy at 
age 25 significantly increased among the college-educated (white men: 0.58 years 
[95% CI, 0.42 to 0.73], white women: 0.78 years [95% CI, 0.57 to 1.00], and 
black women: 1.70 years [95% CI, 0.91 to 2.53]). The difference between high- 
and low-education groups increased from 2010 to 2017, largely because life-years 
lost to drug use increased among those with a high school degree or less (white 
men: 0.93 years [95% CI, 0.90 to 0.96], white women: 0.50 years [95% CI, 0.47 to 
0.52], black men: 0.75 years [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.79], and black women: 0.28 years 
[95% CI, 0.25 to 0.31]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this serial cross-sectional study, estimated life 
expectancy at age 25 years declined overall between 2010 and 2017; however, it 
declined among persons without a 4-year college degree and increased among 
college-educated persons. Much of the increasing educational differences in 
years of life lost may be related to deaths attributed to drug use.

The early Palaeozoic Era records the initial biodiversification of the 
Phanerozoic. The increase in biodiversity involved drastic changes in taxon 
longevity, and in rates of origination and extinction. Here, we calculate these 
variables in unprecedented temporal resolution. We find that highly volatile 
origination and extinction rates are associated with short genus longevities 
during the Cambrian Period. During the Ordovician and Silurian periods, 
evolutionary rates were less volatile and genera persisted for increasingly 
longer intervals. The 90%-genus life expectancy doubled from 5 Myr in the late 
Cambrian to more than 10 Myr in the Ordovician-Silurian periods. Intervals with 
widespread ecosystem disruption are associated with short genus longevities 
during the Cambrian and with exceptionally high longevities during the 
Ordovician and Silurian periods. The post-Cambrian increase in persistence of 
genera, therefore, indicates an elevated ability of the changing early 
Palaeozoic marine ecosystems to sustainably maintain existing genera. This is 
evidence of a new level of ecosystem resilience which evolved during the 
Ordovician Period.

BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's contracture (DC) is a fibrotic hand condition in which 
one or more fingers develop progressive flexion deformities. Quality of life is 
diminished due to disabling limitations in performing everyday activities. For 
DC patients treated with collagenase, referral for subsequent hand therapy is 
inconsistent. It is unknown whether subsequent hand therapy is beneficial 
compared to no therapy. The purpose of this study is to determine whether hand 
therapy improves DC patients' performance of and satisfaction with performing 
everyday activities one year after collagenase treatment.
METHODS: We will conduct a randomised controlled trial with two treatment groups 
(hand therapy vs. control) of DC patients who have received collagenase 
treatment. DC patients with contracted metacarpophalangeal joint(s) (MCPJ) (hand 
therapy, n = 40; control, n = 40) and those with proximal interphalangeal 
joint(s) (PIPJ) involvement (hand therapy, n = 40; control, n = 40) comprise two 
subgroups, and we will study if the treatment effect will be different between 
both groups (n = 160). Patients with a previous injury or treatment for DC in 
the treatment finger are excluded. Hand therapy includes oedema and scar 
management, splinting, movement exercises, and practice of everyday activities. 
The main outcome variable is patients' performance of and satisfaction with 
performing everyday activities, as assessed with the Canadian Occupational 
Performance Measure. Secondary outcomes are DC-specific activity problems, as 
assessed with the Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main scale, and 
active/passive flexion/extension of treated joints and grip force using standard 
measuring tools, and self-reported pain level. Demographic and clinical 
variables, degree of scarring, cold hypersensitivity, number of occupational 
sick-leave days are collected. Self-reported global impression of change will be 
used to assess patient satisfaction with change in hand function. Assessments 
are done pre-injection and 6 weeks, 4 months, and 1 year later. Standard 
univariate and multivariate statistical analyses will be used to evaluate group 
differences.
DISCUSSION: This study aims to assess whether hand therapy is beneficial for 
activity-related, biomechanical, and clinical outcomes in DC patients after 
collagenase treatment. The results will provide an objective basis for 
determining whether hand therapy should be conducted after collagenase 
treatment.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as 
NCT03580213 (April 5, 2018).

INTRODUCTION: Emotional disclosure (ED) is a term used to describe the 
therapeutic expression of emotion. ED underlies a variety of therapies aimed at 
improving well-being for various populations, including people with 
palliative-stage disease and their family carers. Systematic reviews of ED-based 
psychotherapy have largely focused on expressive writing as a way of generating 
ED. However, heterogeneity in intervention format and outcome measures has made 
it difficult to analyse efficacy. There is also debate about the mechanisms 
proposed to explain the potential effects of ED.We present a scoping review 
protocol to develop a taxonomy of ED-based interventions to identify and 
categorise the spectrum of interventions that could be classified under the 
umbrella term of 'emotional disclosure' in the palliative care setting. By 
mapping these to associated treatment objectives, outcome measures and 
explanatory frameworks, the review will inform future efforts to design and 
evaluate ED-based therapies in this population.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The review will be guided by Arksey and O'Malley's 
five-stage scoping review framework and Levac's extension. The following 
electronic databases will be searched from database inception: CENTRAL, the 
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, 
Scopus, Web of Science and MEDLINE. We will include peer-reviewed studies and 
reviews. We will also check grey literature, including clinical trial registers, 
conference proceedings and reference lists, as well as contacting researchers. 
Articles will be screened by at least two independent reviewers and data charted 
using an extraction form developed for this review. Results will be analysed 
thematically to create a taxonomy of interventions, outcome measures and 
theoretical frameworks.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This review does not require ethical approval as it is 
a secondary analysis of pre-existing, published data. The results will inform 
future research in the development of ED-based interventions and evaluation of 
their efficacy in the palliative care setting. We will disseminate findings 
through peer-reviewed journals.

Expectations relating to treatment and survival, and factors influencing 
treatment decisions are not well understood in adult patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia. This study analyzed combined findings from a targeted literature 
review with patient-reported information shared on YouTube to further understand 
patient perspectives in hematologic cancers and, in particular, acute myeloid 
leukemia. The targeted literature review included articles concerning patient 
(aged ≥ 18 years) experiences or perspectives in acute myeloid leukemia or other 
hematologic cancers. YouTube video selection criteria included patients (aged 
≥ 60 years) with self-reported acute myeloid leukemia. In total, 26 articles (13 
acute myeloid leukemia-specific and 14 other hematologic cancers, with one 
relevant to both populations) and 28 videos pertaining to ten unique 
patients/caregivers were identified. Key concepts reported by patients included 
the perceived value of survival for achieving personal and/or life milestones, 
the emotional/psychological distress of their diagnosis, and the uncertainties 
about life expectancy/prognosis. Effective therapies that could potentially 
delay progression and extend life were of great importance to patients; however, 
these were considered in terms of quality-of-life impact and disruption to daily 
life. Many patients expressed concerns regarding the lack of treatment options, 
the possibility of side effects, and how their diagnosis and treatment would 
affect relationships, daily lives, and ability to complete certain tasks. Both 
data sources yielded valuable and rich information on the patient experience and 
perceptions of hematologic cancers, in particular for acute myeloid leukemia, 
and its treatments. Further understanding of these insights could aid 
discussions between clinicians, patients, and their caregivers regarding 
treatment decisions, highlight outcomes of importance to patients in clinical 
studies, and ultimately, inform patient-focused drug development and evaluation.

The effect of three green gram cultivars (PDM 54, PUSA BAISAKHI and SAMRAT) on 
the biology of Spilosoma obliqua Walker (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) was studied 
using age-stage, two-sex life table. We also studied food utilization efficiency 
measures of larvae on green gram cultivars. The nutritional and antinutritional 
factors of leaves of green gram cultivars were determined. The preadult 
development time of S. obliqua was shortest on PDM 54 (35.54 days) and longest 
on SAMRAT (39.29 days). The fecundity was highest on PDM 54 (318.32) and lowest 
on SAMRAT (250.20). The net reproductive rate (R0) ranged from 37.53 on SAMRAT 
to 79.58 on PDM 54. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) was higher on PDM 54 
(0.1148 day-1) and PUSA BAISAKHI (0.1018 day-1) than SAMRAT (0.0875 day-1). The 
finite rate of increase (λ) was lowest on SAMRAT (1.0915 day-1). Mean generation 
time (T) was shortest on PDM 54 (38.12 days) and longest on SAMRAT (41.42 days). 
Population projection revealed that the population growth was slowest on SAMRAT. 
The growth rate of sixth instar larvae was highest on PDM 54 and lowest on 
SAMRAT. The lower level of nutritional factors such as total carbohydrates, 
proteins, lipids, amino acids and nitrogen content, and a higher level of 
antinutritional factors such as total phenols, flavonols and tannins influenced 
higher development time and lower fecundity of S. obliqua on SAMRAT than other 
cultivars. These findings suggested that SAMRAT is a less suitable cultivar to 
S. obliqua than other cultivars, and this cultivar can be promoted for 
cultivation.

Background: The majority of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the bulk of which receive palliative 
systemic treatment with the goal to provide effective symptom palliation and 
safeguard health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Advanced NSCLC trials with 
HRQoL endpoints face methodological constraints limiting interpretability. 
Objectives: We provide a comprehensive overview of recent clinical trials 
evaluating the impact of systemic therapies on HRQoL in advanced NSCLC, focusing 
on the methodological quality, with the ultimate goal to improve interpretation, 
comparison and reporting of HRQoL data. Methods: A systematic literature review 
was performed. Prospective studies published over the last decade evaluating the 
impact of systemic treatments on HRQoL in advanced NSCLC were included. 
Methodological quality of HRQoL reporting was assessed with the CONSORT-PRO 
extension. Results: Hundred-twelve manuscripts describing 85 trials met all 
criteria. No formal conclusion can be drawn regarding the impact on HRQoL of 
different treatments. We report an important variety in methodological quality 
in terms of definitions of HRQoL, missing data points, lack of standardization 
of analyzing and presenting HRQoL and no standard follow-up time. The quality of 
HRQoL data reporting varies substantially between studies but improves over 
time. Conclusion: This review shows that in the heterogeneous landscape of 
trials addressing HRQoL in advanced stage NSCLC. Methodology reporting remains 
generally poor. Adequate reporting of HRQoL outcome data is equally important to 
support clinical decision-making as to correctly inform health policy regarding 
direct approval and reimbursement of the new drugs and combinations that will 
come online.

Improvement Institute, Agricultural Research, Education, and Extension 
Organization, Karaj, Iran.

BACKGROUND: Root to shoot connection and transfer of information seems to be 
taken place mostly via the transmissions of signal molecules, secondary 
metabolites, amino acids, hormones and proteins, through xylem sap. Examination 
of earlier reports is indicative of relatively high levels of conservation in 
xylem sap protein compositions. Apparently these protein molecules are being 
synthesized in roots in response to environmental changes and get transported to 
aerial plant parts after secretion into xylem sap.
OBJECTIVES: In order to comprehend this so-called passive signaling, some 
questions need to be answered: 1) Do these proteins have the capability to act 
as signals? 2) How much energy does root spend for the biosynthesis of the 
secreted proteins? How similar is the amount of energy that root cells spent for 
the biosynthesis of intra- and extra-cellular proteins?
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reported xylem sap proteins curated from Arabidopsis, 
maize and soybean. Their sequences were put under scrutiny in terms of 
considering their mobility, and physical and chemical properties. Metabolic 
energy required for their biosynthesis along with the energy hidden in their 
peptide bonds were calculated and compared with random non-xylem sap proteins as 
control.
RESULTS: Xylem sap proteins were significantly smaller than the root proteins, 
while they were bigger in size when compared to the leaf group. Xylem protein 
pIs were significantly higher than the control proteins in different plants. 
Similarly, the protein stability was higher for xylem sap proteins in comparison 
with roots and leaves in all analyzed plants, except for soybean that the 
stability was indifferent between xylem and root. The data were suggestive a 
significantly lower energy consumption for the synthesis of xylem sap proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower energy consumption may suggest an economical route of 
communication between roots and shoots in plants that mainly rely on symplastic 
signaling.

Spectroscopic characterization of AgI -ion-mediated C-AgI -A and C-AgI -T base 
pairs found in primer extension reactions catalyzed by DNA polymerases was 
conducted. UV melting experiments revealed that C-A and C-T mismatched base 
pairs in oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes are specifically stabilized by AgI ions 
in 1:1 stoichiometry in the same manner as a C-C mismatched base pair. Although 
the stability of the mismatched base pairs in the absence of AgI ions is in the 
order C-A≈C-T>C-C, the stabilizing effect of AgI ions follows the order 
C-C>C-A≈C-T. However, the comparative susceptibility of dNTPs to AgI -mediated 
enzymatic incorporation into the site opposite templating C is dATP>dTTP≫dCTP, 
as reported. The net charge, as well as the size and/or shape complementarity of 
the metal-mediated base pairs, or the stabilities of mismatched base pairs in 
the absence of metal ions, would be more important than the stability of the 
metallo-base pairs in the replicating reaction catalyzed by DNA polymerases.

This Account describes a range of strategies for the development of fluorescent 
probes for detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species 
(RNS), and reactive (redox-active) sulfur species (RSS). Many ROS/RNS have been 
implicated in pathological processes such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, 
diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and aging, while many RSS play 
important roles in maintaining redox homeostasis, serving as antioxidants and 
acting as free radical scavengers. Fluorescence-based systems have emerged as 
one of the best ways to monitor the concentrations and locations of these often 
very short lived species. Because of the high levels of sensitivity and in 
particular their ability to be used for temporal and spatial sampling for in 
vivo imaging applications. As a direct result, there has been a huge surge in 
the development of fluorescent probes for sensitive and selective detection of 
ROS, RNS, and RSS within cellular environments. However, cellular environments 
are extremely complex, often with more than one species involved in a given 
biochemical process. As a result, there has been a rise in the development of 
dual-responsive fluorescent probes (AND-logic probes) that can monitor the 
presence of more than one species in a biological environment. Our aim with this 
Account is to introduce the fluorescent probes that we have developed for in 
vitro and in vivo measurement of ROS, RNS, and RSS. Fluorescence-based sensing 
mechanisms used in the construction of the probes include photoinduced electron 
transfer, intramolecular charge transfer, excited-state intramolecular proton 
transfer (ESIPT), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. In particular, 
probes for hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid, superoxide, peroxynitrite, 
glutathione, cysteine, homocysteine, and hydrogen sulfide are discussed. In 
addition, we describe the development of AND-logic-based systems capable of 
detecting two species, such as peroxynitrite and glutathione. One of the most 
interesting advances contained in this Account is our extension of indicator 
displacement assays (IDAs) to reaction-based indicator displacement assays 
(RIAs). In an IDA system, an indicator is allowed to bind reversibly to a 
receptor. Then a competitive analyte is introduced into the system, resulting in 
displacement of the indicator from the host, which in turn modulates the optical 
signal. With an RIA-based system, the indicator is cleaved from a preformed 
receptor-indicator complex rather than being displaced by the analyte. 
Nevertheless, without a doubt the most significant result contained in this 
Account is the use of an ESIPT-based probe for the simultaneous sensing of 
fibrous proteins/peptides AND environmental ROS/RNS.

BACKGROUND: As the global burden of disease continues to rise, it becomes 
increasingly important to determine the sustainability of specialty surgery in 
the developing world. The authors aim to (1) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
plastic and reconstructive surgery in the developing world and (2) quantify the 
economic benefit.
METHODS: In this study, the authors performed a retrospective analysis of 
surgical trips performed by ReSurge International from 2014 to 2017. The 
organization gathered data on trip information, cost, and clinical 
characteristics. The authors measured the cost-effectiveness of the 
interventions using cost per disability-adjusted life-years and defined 
cost-effectiveness using World Health Organization Choosing Interventions That 
Are Cost-Effective thresholds. The authors also performed a cost-to-benefit 
analysis using the human capital approach.
RESULTS: A total of 22 surgical trips from eight different developing countries 
were included in this study. The authors analyzed a total of 756 surgical 
interventions. The cost-effectiveness of the surgical trips ranged from $52 to 
$11,410 per disability-adjusted life-year averted. The economic benefit for the 
22 surgical trips was $9,795,384. According to World Health Organization 
Choosing Interventions That Are Cost-Effective thresholds, 21 of the surgical 
trips were considered very cost-effective or cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Plastic and reconstructive operations performed during short-term 
surgical trips performed by this organization are economically sustainable. 
High-volume trips and those treating complex surgical conditions prove to be the 
most cost-effective. To continue to receive monetary funding, providing fiscally 
sustainable surgical care to low- and middle-income countries is imperative.

BACKGROUND: There is an increasing concern about age-related frailty because of 
the growing number of elderly people in the general population. The 
Longevity-Associated Variant (LAV) of the human BPIFB4 gene was found to correct 
endothelial dysfunction, one of the mechanisms underlying frailty, in aging mice 
whereas the RV-BPIFB4 variant induced opposite effects. Thus, we newly 
hypothesize that, besides being associated with life expectancy, BPIFB4 
polymorphisms can predict frailty.Aim and Results: Here we investigated if the 
BPIFB4 haplotypes, LAV, wild-type (WT) and RV, differentially associate with 
frailty in a cohort of 237 elderly subjects from Calabria region in Southern 
Italy. Moreover, we studied the effect of systemic adeno-associated viral 
vector-mediated LAV-BPIFB4 gene transfer on the progression of frailty in aging 
mice. We found an inverse correlation of the homozygous LAV-BPIFB4 haplotype 
with frailty in elderly subjects. Conversely, carriers of the RV-BPIFB4 
haplotype showed an increase in the frailty status and risk of death. Moreover, 
in old mice, LAV-BPIFB4 gene transfer delayed frailty progression.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that specific BPIFB4 haplotypes could represent 
useful genetic markers of frailty. In addition, horizontal transfer of a healthy 
gene variant can attenuate frailty in aging organisms.

OBJECTIVES: To analyse years of life lost (YLLs) due to digestive diseases in 
Poland according to: marital status, education, working status and place of 
residence.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.
SETTING: The study was based on a dataset containing information from death 
certificates of Poles who died in 2002 and in 2011.
PARTICIPANTS: The analysis covered records with codes K00-K93 according to the 
International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th 
Revision.
OUTCOME MEASURES: YLL values were calculated using the Standard Expected Years 
of Life Lost measure. For each socioeconomic variable, the rate ratio (RR) was 
calculated as the quotient of YLLs in the less privileged group to the more 
privileged group.
RESULTS: Among the categories of marital status, the smallest YLL values (per 10 
000) were recorded among singles (men: 100.63 years in 2002, 121.10 years in 
2011; women: 26.99, 33.33, respectively), and the most among divorced men 
(657.87, 689.32) and widowed women (173.97, 169.46). YLL analysis according to 
education level revealed the lowest values in people with higher education (men: 
54.20, 57.66; women: 17.31, 18.31) and the highest in people with lower than 
secondary education (men: 178.85, 198.32; women: 104.95, 125.76). Being 
economically active was associated with a smaller YLL score (men: 39.93, 59.51; 
women: 10.31, 14.96) than being inactive (men: 340.54, 219.93; women: 126.86, 
96.80). Urban residents had higher YLL score (men: 159.46, 174.18, women: 73.03, 
78.12) than rural ones (men: 126.83, 137.11, women: 57.32, 57.56).In both sexes, 
RR according to education level and place of residence increased, and those 
according to marital status and working status decreased with time.
CONCLUSIONS: Activities aimed at reducing health inequalities in terms of YLL 
due to digestive diseases should be primarily addressed to inhabitants with 
lower than secondary education, divorced and widowed people, urban residents and 
those who are economically inactive.

Medications to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) are not equally effective 
across patients. Given that neural response to rewards is altered in MDD and 
given that reward-related circuitry is modulated by dopamine and serotonin, we 
examined, for the first time, whether reward-related neural activity moderated 
response to sertraline, an antidepressant medication that targets these 
neurotransmitters. A total of 222 unmedicated adults with MDD randomized to 
receive sertraline (n = 110) or placebo (n = 112) in the Establishing Moderators 
and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study 
completed demographic and clinical assessments, and pretreatment functional 
magnetic resonance imaging while performing a reward task. We tested whether an 
index of reward system function in the ventral striatum (VS), a key reward 
circuitry region, moderated differential response to sertraline versus placebo, 
assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HSRD) over 8 weeks. We 
observed a significant moderation effect of the reward index, reflecting the 
temporal dynamics of VS activity, on week-8 depression levels (Fs ≥ 9.67, 
ps ≤ 0.002). Specifically, VS responses that were abnormal with respect to 
predictions from reinforcement learning theory were associated with lower week-8 
depression symptoms in the sertraline versus placebo arms. Thus, a more abnormal 
pattern of pretreatment VS dynamic response to reward expectancy (expected 
outcome value) and prediction error (difference between expected and actual 
outcome), likely reflecting serotonergic and dopaminergic deficits, was 
associated with better response to sertraline than placebo. Pretreatment 
measures of reward-related VS activity may serve as objective neural markers to 
advance efforts to personalize interventions by guiding individual-level choice 
of antidepressant treatment.

BACKGROUND: Pleural effusions are common complications of various diseases. 
Patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE) usually face poor prognosis and 
short life expectancy. Discriminating between MPE and benign pleural effusion 
remains to be difficult. The aim of our current study was to evaluate whether 
CD206+CD14+ macrophages could be a diagnostic biomarker for MPE.
METHODS: The percentages of CD14+, CD86+CD14+ and CD206+CD14+ macrophages in 
pleural effusions were determined by flow cytometry in 34 patients with MPE and 
26 with benign pleural effusion, and their diagnostic performances were 
evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
RESULTS: The percentages of CD14+, CD86+CD14+ and CD206+CD14+ macrophages were 
remarkably higher in MPE than in benign pleural effusion (all P<0.05). With a 
cutoff value of 39.8%, a high sensitivity of 88.2% and high specificity of 
100.0% were found in CD206+CD14+ macrophages to diagnose MPE. The area under the 
curve, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of CD206+CD14+ 
macrophages were 0.980 (95% CI, 0.905 to 0.999), 100.0 (88.4 to 100.0) and 86.7 
(69.3 to 96.2), respectively. The diagnostic performance of CD206+CD14+ 
macrophages was more accurate than those of CD14+ and CD86+CD14+ macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: CD206+CD14+ macrophages could be used to discriminate MPE from 
benign pleural effusion.

OBJECTIVE: Stratified medicine refers to the use of tests that predict treatment 
response to drive treatment decisions for individual patient. The 
pharmacoeconomic implications of this approach in schizophrenia are unknown. We 
aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical stratified medicine 
algorithm (SMA) compared with treatment as usual (TAU), for patients with 
schizophrenia who failed a first-line antipsychotic.
METHODS: A decision analytic model with embedded Markov process was constructed, 
which simulated the health and cost outcomes for patients followed SMA or TAU 
over a lifetime horizon, from healthcare and social care perspective. In the 
base-case analysis, sensitivity and specificity of the stratifier were both set 
as 60%. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the impact of 
uncertainty around the value of important parameters. The primary outcome was 
the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: When both sensitivity and specificity of the stratified test were set 
at 60%, SMA appeared to be the optimal strategy as it produces more QALYs and 
incurs lower costs than TAU. This is robust to all scenarios tested. At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY, the probability for SMA to be 
the optimal strategy is 82.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that use of any stratifier with a sensitivity 
and specificity over 60% is very likely to be cost-effective comparing to TAU, 
for psychotic patients who failed a first-line antipsychotic. This finding, 
however, should be interpreted with caution due to lack of evidence for 
clozapine as a second-line antipsychotic.
