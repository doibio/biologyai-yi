To investigate the adaptive locomotion mechanism in animals, a split-belt 
treadmill has been used, which has two parallel belts to produce left-right 
symmetric and asymmetric environments for walking. Spinal cats walking on the 
treadmill have suggested the contribution of the spinal cord and associated 
peripheral nervous system to the adaptive locomotion. Physiological studies have 
shown that phase resetting of locomotor commands involving a phase shift occurs 
depending on the types of sensory nerves and stimulation timing, and that muscle 
activation patterns during walking are represented by a linear combination of a 
few numbers of basic temporal patterns despite the complexity of the activation 
patterns. Our working hypothesis was that resetting the onset timings of basic 
temporal patterns based on the sensory information from the leg, especially 
extension of hip flexors, contributes to adaptive locomotion on the split-belt 
treadmill. Our hypothesis was examined by conducting forward dynamic simulations 
using a neuromusculoskeletal model of a rat walking on a split-belt treadmill 
with its hindlimbs and by comparing the simulated motions with the measured 
motions of rats.

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of niraparib compared 
with routine surveillance (RS), olaparib and rucaparib for the maintenance 
treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (OC).
METHODS: A decision-analytic model estimated the cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained for niraparib versus RS, olaparib, and rucaparib from a 
US payer perspective. The model considered recurrent OC patients with or without 
germline BRCA mutations (gBRCAmut and non-gBRCAmut), who were responsive to 
their last platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Model health states were: 
progression-free disease, progressed disease and dead. Mean progression-free 
survival (PFS) was estimated using parametric survival distributions based on 
ENGOT-OV16/NOVA (niraparib phase III trial), ARIEL3 (rucaparib phase III trial) 
and Study 19 (olaparib phase II trial). Mean overall survival (OS) benefit was 
estimated as double the mean PFS benefit based on the relationship between PFS 
and OS observed in Study 19. Costs included: drug, chemotherapy, monitoring, 
adverse events, and terminal care. EQ-5D utilities were estimated from trial 
data.
RESULTS: Compared to RS, niraparib was associated with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$68,287/QALY and US$108,287/QALY for 
gBRCAmut and non-gBRCAmut, respectively. Compared to olaparib and rucaparib, 
niraparib decreased costs and increased QALYs, with a cost saving of US$8799 and 
US$22,236 versus olaparib and US$198,708 and US$73,561 versus rucaparib for 
gBRCAmut and non-gBRCAmut, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Niraparib was estimated to be less costly and more effective 
compared to olaparib and rucaparib, and the ICER fell within an acceptable range 
compared to RS. Therefore, niraparib may be considered a cost-effective 
maintenance treatment for patients with recurrent OC.

AIM: The aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility and clinical results 
of linear accelerator (linac-)based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or 
fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SFRT) with flattening filter-free (FFF) 
volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in elderly patients affected by brain 
metastases (BMs).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients selected for the present analysis were ≥65 years 
old with a life expectancy of >3 months, a controlled or synchronous primary 
tumor, and <10 BMs with a diameter <3 cm. All patients were treated with FFF 
linac-based SRS/SFRT. The prescribed total dose (15-30 Gy/1-5 fractions) was 
based on BM size and proximity to organs at risk (OAR). Toxicity was assessed 
according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. 
MedCalc v18.2 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium) was used for statistical 
analysis.
RESULTS: From April 2014 to December 2017, 40 elderly patients with 110 BMs were 
treated by FFF linac-based SRS/SFRT. With a median follow-up of 28 months (range 
6-50 months), median and 1‑year overall survival were 9 months and 39%, 
respectively; median intracranial progression-free survival was 6 months. At the 
time of the analysis, local control was reported in 109/110 BMs (99.1%): 12 BMs 
had a complete response; 51 a partial response; 46 showed stable disease. One BM 
(0.9%) progressed after 2 months. BM volume (<1 cc) and higher SRS/SFRT dose 
correlated to treatment response (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0017, respectively). No 
adverse events higher than grade 2 were observed.
CONCLUSION: The present findings highlight the feasibility, safety, and 
effectiveness of FFF linac-based SRS/SFRT in elderly patients with BMs.

OBJECTIVE: The present parallel randomised control trial evaluated the 
feasibility of a nurse-led psycho-educational intervention aimed at improving 
the self-management of prostate cancer survivors.
METHODS: We identified 305 eligible patients from a district general hospital, 
diagnosed 9-48 months previously, who completed radical treatment, or were 
monitored clinically (ineligible for treatment). Ninety-five patients were 
recruited by blinded selection and randomised to Intervention (N = 48) and 
Control (N = 47) groups. Participant allocation was revealed to patients and 
researchers after recruitment was completed. For 36 weeks, participants received 
augmented usual care (Control) or augmented usual care and additional nurse 
support (Intervention) provided in two community hospitals and a university 
clinic, or by telephone.
RESULTS: Data from 91 participants (Intervention, N = 45; Control, N = 46) were 
analysed. All feasibility metrics met predefined targets: recruitment rate 
(31.15%; 95% CI: 25.95%-36.35%), attrition rate (9.47%; 95% CI: 3.58%-15.36%) 
and outcome measures completion rates (77%-92%). Forty-five patients received 
the intervention, with no adverse events. The Extended Prostate Cancer Index 
Composite can inform the minimum sample size for a future effectiveness trial. 
The net intervention cost was £317 per patient.
CONCLUSIONS: The results supported the feasibility and acceptability of the 
intervention, suggesting that it should be evaluated in a fully powered trial to 
assess its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.

A pollen/food-associated syndrome (PFAS) has been described between peach and 
cypress pollen. Cross-reactive allergens were characterized which belong to the 
Gibberellin-regulated protein (GRP) family, BP14 in cypress pollen and Pru p 7 
in peach. GRP are small cationic protein with anti-microbial properties. A 
patient suffering from a peach/cypress syndrome was explored clinically and 
biologically using 2 types of immunoglobulin E (IgE) multiarray microchip, 
immunoblots and a basophil activation test to assess the clinical relevance of 
various extracts and purified allergens from fruits or cypress pollen. In 
addition to PR10 sensitization, the patient showed specific IgE to Pru p 7, BP14 
and allergen from pomegranate. These last 3 allergens and allergenic sources are 
able to induce ex vivo basophil activation characterized by the monitoring of 
the expression of CD63 and CD203c, both cell surface markers correlated with a 
basophil mediator release. Up to 100% of cells expressed CD203c at 50 ng/mL of 
BP14 protein. In contrast, snakin-1, a GRP from potato sharing 82% sequence 
identity with Pru p 7 did not activate patient's basophils. These results 
strongly suggest that, like Pru p 7, BP14 is a clinically relevant allergenic 
GRP from pollen. Allergen members of this newly described protein family are 
good candidates for PFAS where no cross-reactive allergens have been 
characterized.

BACKGROUND: In light of constrained budgets and the need to fund efficient 
treatment options, this study set out to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
sorafenib as a first-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared 
to best supportive care (BSC) from the military hospital perspective in Egypt.
METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model simulated disease progression with 
clinical parameters and utility values derived from published data. Data on 
direct medical costs were collected from the local healthcare system or payer. 
Costs and effects were discounted at 3.5% annually and reported in USD using 
purchasing power parity adjustments. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Mortality occurred less frequently in the sorafenib group (sorafenib 
group: 99.96%, BSC group: 99.99%). The total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
of the sorafenib cohort were estimated to be 46.24 compared with 42.27 for the 
BSC cohort, which resulted in an incremental gain of 3.96 QALYs. The total costs 
for the sorafenib and BSC cohorts were USD 4,229,940 and USD 3,092,886, 
respectively (incremental cost = $1,137,054), resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD 286,776 per QALY gained for the sorafenib 
cohort. One-way sensitivity analyses that addressed the uncertainty of the BSC 
estimates indicated that the progression-free survival for BSC and utility value 
of progression had the greatest effects on the results.
CONCLUSION: This study concluded that sorafenib does offer increased survival 
and quality-of-life at an increased cost but at an ICER that exceeds the 
nationally accepted cost-effectiveness threshold. The findings support 
healthcare decision-making of the efficient allocation of healthcare system 
resources to improve the health of the Egyptian population. Whether sorafenib is 
cost-effective in specific sub-groups with additional risk factors needs to be 
addressed in future studies.

BACKGROUND: Newer classes of targeted drugs for moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis are more effective and more expensive than older classes, posing a 
difficult and potentially costly decision about whether to use them as initial 
targeted treatments.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the clinical and economic outcomes of initial targeted 
treatment for the following drugs: adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab (TNFα 
inhibitors); apremilast (PDE4 inhibitor); ustekinumab (IL-12/23 inhibitor); and 
ixekizumab, secukinumab, and brodalumab (IL-17 inhibitors).
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to simulate patient outcomes as measured by 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and health care costs over a 10-year period. 
We assumed that patients who fail initial targeted treatment either proceed to 
subsequent therapy or discontinue targeted treatment. Effectiveness estimates 
for initial treatment were defined as improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity 
Index (PASI) from baseline and derived from a 2018 network meta-analysis. 
Wholesale acquisition drug costs were discounted by a class-specific, 
empirically derived rebate percentage off of 2016 costs. We conducted one-way 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess uncertainty in results.
RESULTS: The incremental benefits compared with no targeted treatment were, in 
descending order: ixekizumab 1.68 QALYs (95% credible range [CR] = 1.11-2.02), 
brodalumab 1.64 QALYs (95% CR = 1.08-1.98), secukinumab 1.51 QALYs (95% CR = 
1.00-1.83), ustekinumab 1.43 QALYs (95% CR=0.94-1.74), infliximab 1.27 QALYs 
(95% CR = 0.89-1.55), adalimumab 1.15 QALYs (95% CR = 0.76-1.44), etanercept 
0.97 QALYs (95% CR = 0.61-1.25), and apremilast 0.87 QALYs (95% CR = 0.52-1.17). 
Costs of care without targeted treatment totaled $66,451, and costs of targeted 
treatment ranged from $137,080 (apremilast) to $255,422 (ustekinumab). 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results indicated that infliximab and 
apremilast are likely to be the most cost-effective initial treatments at 
willingness-to-pay thresholds around $100,000 per QALY, while IL-17 drugs are 
more likely to be cost-effective at thresholds approaching $150,000 per QALY. 
Acquisition cost of the initial targeted drug and utility of clinical response 
were the most influential parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that initial targeted treatment with IL-17 
inhibitors is the most effective treatment strategy for plaque psoriasis 
patients who have failed methotrexate and phototherapy. Apremilast, brodalumab, 
infliximab, ixekizumab, and secukinumab are cost-effective at different 
willingness-to-pay thresholds. Additional research is needed on whether the 
effectiveness of targeted agents changes when used after previously targeted 
agents.

Aging impairs the activation of stress signaling pathways (SSPs), preventing the 
induction of longevity mechanisms late in life. Here, we show that the 
antibiotic minocycline increases lifespan and reduces protein aggregation even 
in old, SSP-deficient Caenorhabditis elegans by targeting cytoplasmic ribosomes, 
preferentially attenuating translation of highly translated mRNAs. In contrast 
to most other longevity paradigms, minocycline inhibits rather than activates 
all major SSPs and extends lifespan in mutants deficient in the activation of 
SSPs, lysosomal or autophagic pathways. We propose that minocycline lowers the 
concentration of newly synthesized aggregation-prone proteins, resulting in a 
relative increase in protein-folding capacity without the necessity to induce 
protein-folding pathways. Our study suggests that in old individuals with 
incapacitated SSPs or autophagic pathways, pharmacological attenuation of 
cytoplasmic translation is a promising strategy to reduce protein aggregation. 
Altogether, it provides a geroprotecive mechanism for the many beneficial 
effects of tetracyclines in models of neurodegenerative disease.

Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of premenopausal women are significantly 
lower compared to men of similar age. However, this protective effect evidently 
decreases after the onset of menopause. We hypothesized that physical exercise 
could be a potential therapeutic strategy to improve inflammatory processes and 
cardiovascular antioxidant homeostasis, which can be affected by the loss of 
estrogen and the adverse environmental factors, such as overnutrition. 
Ovariectomized (OVX, n= 40) and sham-operated (SO, n= 40) female Wistar rats 
were randomized to exercising (R) and non-exercising (NR) groups. Feeding 
parameters were chosen to make a standard chow (CTRL) or a high triglyceride 
diet (HT) for 12 weeks. Aortic and cardiac heme oxygenase (HO) activity and HO-1 
concentrations significantly decreased in all of the NR OVX and SO HT groups. 
However, the 12-week physical exercise was found to improve HO-1 values. Plasma 
IL-6 concentrations were higher in the NR OVX animals and rats fed HT diet 
compared to SO CTRL rats. TNF-α concentrations were significantly higher in the 
NR OVX groups. 12 weeks of exercise significantly reduced the concentrations of 
both TNF-α and IL-6 compared to the NR counterparts. The activity of 
myeloperoxidase enzyme (MPO) was significantly increased as a result of OVX and 
HT diet, however voluntary wheel-running exercise restored the elevated values. 
Our results show that estrogen deficiency and HT diet caused a significant 
decrease in the activity and concentration of HO enzyme, as well as the 
concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, and the activity of MPO. However, 12 weeks of 
voluntary wheel-running exercise is a potential non-pharmacological therapy to 
ameliorate these disturbances, which determine the life expectancy of 
postmenopausal women.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hispanics are the most rapidly aging minority 
population in the United States. Our objective is to provide a summary of 
current knowledge regarding disability among Hispanics, and to propose an agenda 
for future research.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify major 
areas of research. A life course perspective and the Hispanic Paradox were used 
as frameworks for the literature review and for identifying future areas of 
research.
RESULTS: Four research areas were identified: (1) Ethnic disparities in 
disability; (2) Heterogeneity of the U.S. older Hispanic population; (3) Risk 
factors for disability; and (4) Disabled life expectancy. Older Hispanics are 
more likely than non-Hispanic whites to be disabled or to become disabled. 
Disability varied by country of origin, nativity, age of migration, and duration 
in the United States. Important risk factors for disability included chronic 
health conditions, depression, and cognitive impairment. Protective factors 
included positive affect and physical activity. Older Hispanics have longer life 
expectancy than non-Hispanic whites but spend a greater proportion of old age 
disabled. Future research should continue to monitor trends in disability as 
younger generations of Hispanics reach old age. Attention needs to be given to 
regional variation within the United States for disability prevalence, 
early-life risk factors, and factors that may contribute to variation in 
disabled life expectancy. There is also an urgent need for interventions that 
can effectively prevent or delay the onset of disability in older Hispanics.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Considerable research has examined disability among 
older Hispanics, but continued research is needed. It is important that research 
findings be used to inform public policies that can address the burden of 
disability for older Hispanic populations.

New evidence reveals a high degree of heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
clinical and temporal patterns, supporting the existence of several subgroups of 
patients. Prognosticators of end-of-life dementia specific to elderly patients 
are necessary to address this heterogeneity. Among 3xTg-AD mice, a widely-used 
model for AD, a very small number of animals overcome advanced neuropathological 
stages of disease beyond 18 months of age. They are usually females, which reach 
longevity in spite of worse neuropathological status as compared to males (the 
morbidity/mortality paradox). We posit that 3xTg-AD long-term survivors could 
serve to model end-of-life dementia but also aware about the mortality selection 
bias. In the present study, we performed behavioral and functional phenotype in 
long-term survivors, 18-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice and age-matched wildtype 
undergoing normal aging. Animals were followed up until natural death to 
correlate survival with phenotype assessments. Strong similarity of their 
behavioral profiles in all the variables analyzed (e.g. reflexes, sensorimotor 
functions, locomotion, exploration, emotionality, and anxiety-like behaviors) 
was found, with the exception of memory impairment, which was a salient trait in 
old 3xTg-AD survivors. The two groups showed similar mean life expectancy and 
had behavioral correlates among lifespan, neophobia and long-term memory in 
common, with some distinctions in 3xTg-AD, supporting recent studies in 
end-of-life patients. In spite of the small sample size, this brief report 
presents an interesting scenario to further study heterogeneity and survival in 
Alzheimer's disease. 3xTg-AD survivors may be a model to gain insight into the 
frailty/survival paradigm in normal and pathological aging.

Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis is a rapidly progressive, 
heterogeneous disease caused by the accumulation of misfolded transthyretin 
protein as amyloid fibrils at multiple sites, and is characterized by peripheral 
sensorimotor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy and/or cardiomyopathy. Current 
treatment options have limited efficacy and often do not prevent disease 
progression. Patisiran is a novel RNA interference therapeutic that specifically 
reduces production of both wild-type and mutant transthyretin protein. In Phase 
II, III and long-term extension studies in patients with hereditary 
transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, patisiran has consistently slowed or 
improved progression of neuropathy. In addition, the Phase III trial 
demonstrated significant improvements in quality of life measures and indicators 
of cardiomyopathy. Here, we highlight efficacy and safety data from the 
patisiran clinical trial programme.

Changing the Way of Entrance: Highly Efficient Transfer of mRNA and siRNA via 
Fusogenic Nano-Carriers.

Hoffmann M, Hersch N, Merkel R, Csiszar A, Hoffmann B.

Transferring nucleic acids into mammalian cells heavily influences life science 
for decades. While first applications mainly dealt with DNA transfer for various 
purposes as e.g., plasmid encoded protein expression or generation of mutant 
strains, subsequent applications additionally transferred RNA molecules of 
mainly small lengths for specific knockdown (RNAi) or site-specific genome 
modification (gRNA). Significant improvements in full length mRNA generation and 
extension of mRNA lifetimes additionally allows their use for transient 
expression in latest times. For all of these types of nucleic acids the most 
common cell incorporation method is based on complexation and subsequent 
endosomal uptake. This so-called lipofection can be used theoretically for 
almost any mammalian cell type and a tremendous number of different product 
compositions exist in order to deal with drawbacks as transfer efficiency, cell 
type selectivity, endosomal degradation, slow uptake and cytotoxicity. In 
contrast, new methods transfer complexed RNA molecules directly into the 
cytoplasm using liposomal nano-carriers that fuse with cellular plasma membranes 
immediately upon contact to free functional nucleic acids directly into the 
cytoplasm. Here, we compare both methods in detail with special focus on 
robustness, short- and long-term cytotoxicity, efficiency and functionality for 
various types of transferred RNA. Our data clearly indicate that direct RNA 
incorporation via fusogenic nano-carriers circumvents most endosomal 
uptake-based challenges, making it to a most promising alternative for nucleic 
acid transfer.

[Article in English, Japanese]

Inoue C, Kondo K.

This article is an extension of a presentation with the same title given at the 
Japanese Alcohol, Nicotine & Drug Addiction Conference in Kobe on October 13th 
2015: Firstly, a brief overview of support activities and services within 
Proyecto Hombre is given outlining the advanced assistance programs for 
supporting and treating addiction. problems. Secondly, it lays out the profile 
of persons with alcohol and drug problems as taken from "Proyecto Hombre 
Observatory Report 2014" vhich has informed the reality of adult users' life 
situation based on a series of indicators from the EuropASI, while they were 
being treated at Proyecto Hombre 27 Centers in Spain between 1 January, 2014 and 
31 December, 2014. The sample consists of 1941 people treated during 2014 after 
application of the criteria for validation of the questionnaire. The profiles so 
obtained enable the design of treatment programs according to their specific 
situation in Proyecto Hombre. In order to allow some guidance to Japanese 
investigators and social workers regarding the design of treatments programs 
based on current user situation, this article draws attention to general 
sociodemographic data as well as data notable for its variation by gender and 
also by substance, and draws limited conclusions based on these.

985. Pharmacoeconomic Review Report: Nusinersen (Spinraza): (Biogen Canada Inc.):
 Indication: Treatment of patients with 5q SMA [Internet].

Ottawa (ON): Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2018 Jan.
CADTH Common Drug Reviews.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neuromuscular disease and is the 
leading genetic cause of infant death. It is characterized by the degeneration 
of alpha motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, leading to 
progressive muscle weakness. The most common form of SMA, 5q SMA, makes up over 
95% of all cases and is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous 
deletion or deletion and mutation of the alleles of the survival motor neuron 1 
(SMN1) gene. SMA is a rare disease and estimates of its incidence and prevalence 
vary between studies. The incidence of SMA is often cited as being approximately 
10 in 100,000 live births. Four clinical subtypes of SMA are described; SMA type 
I makes about 60% of SMA diagnoses where patients show symptoms before 6 months 
of age, never achieve the motor milestone of sitting unsupported, and generally 
do not survive past two years of age due to respiratory failure; SMA type II 
achieve the milestone of sitting unsupported, but never walk independently. 
Symptoms generally appear between 6 to 18 months after birth and most patients 
will survive past the age of 25, with life expectancy improved by aggressive 
supportive care; SMA type III makes up about 10% to 20% of SMA cases3 and 
presents between 18 months of age and adulthood. These patients are able to walk 
independently at some point in their life and typically have a normal life 
expectancy; SMA type IV constitutes very small proportion of SMA cases, has an 
adult onset SMA, and is the mildest form of the disease. Although muscle 
weakness is present, these patients retain the ability to walk, have a normal 
life expectancy, and do not suffer from respiratory or nutritional issues. 
Nusinersen (Spinraza) is a solution for intrathecal injection, indicated for the 
treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). It is available as a single use 
solution in a 5mL vial size (12 mg) administered intrathecal by lumbar puncture. 
The recommended dose is: initial treatment with 4 loading doses, with the first 
3 loading doses administered at 14-day intervals (day 0, day 14, and day 28), 
and a final loading dose approximately 30 days after the third loading dose (day 
63); maintenance treatment is 12 mg every 4 months. The marketed price of 
$118,000 per 5mL vial, the annual cost of treatment with nusinersen ranges from 
$354,000 for maintenance treatment (3 doses) to $708,000 in the 1st year (6 
doses). The manufacturer’s listing request is as per the Health Canada 
indication. The manufacturer submitted three cost-utility analyses for SMA type 
I, II and II. Each analysis was based on a Markov state-transition model 
comparing nusinersen with current standard of care (or real world care [RWC] 
which includes supportive symptomatic treatment of respiratory, nutritional, and 
orthopedic function decline) - for patients with q5 SMA.

Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I), also known as Von Gierke disease, is an 
inherited disorder caused by deficiencies of specific enzymes in the glycogen 
metabolism pathway. It was first described by Von Gierke in 1929 who reported 
excessive hepatic and renal glycogen in the autopsy reports of 2 children. It 
comprises 2 major subtypes, GSD Ia and GSD Ib. In GSD Ia, there is a deficiency 
of enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) which cleaves glycogen to glucose thus 
leading to hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. Patients with GSD 1b have normal 
G6Pase enzyme activity but have a deficiency of the transporter enzyme, 
glucose-6-phosphate translocase (G6PT). Patients present with manifestations of 
hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis typically around 3 to 4 months of age. In 
patients suspected of having the disease, genetic testing is the investigation 
of choice to confirm the diagnosis. Dietary treatment prevents hypoglycemia and 
improves the life expectancy of patients. However, to prevent long-term 
complications such as hepatic adenomas and renal failure, animal models of GSD I 
are being developed to study the disease more closely and develop new treatment 
strategies such as gene therapy.

PURPOSE: Although the life expectancy of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) 
has increased, little is known of their causes of death (CODs) in the rituximab 
era.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We pooled two cohorts of newly diagnosed patients with FL 
grade 1-3A. Patients were enrolled between 2001 and 2013 in two French referral 
institutions (N = 734; median follow-up 89 months) and 2002 and 2012 in the 
University of Iowa and Mayo Clinic Specialized Program of Research Excellence 
(SPORE; N = 920; median follow-up 84 months). COD was classified as being a 
result of lymphoma, other malignancy, treatment related, or all other causes.
RESULTS: Ten-year overall survival was comparable in the French (80%) and US 
(77%) cohorts. We were able to classify COD in 248 (88%) of 283 decedents. In 
the overall cohort, lymphoma was the most common COD, with a cumulative 
incidence of 10.3% at 10 years, followed by treatment-related mortality (3.0%), 
other malignancy (2.9%), other causes (2.2%), and unknown (3.0%). The 10-year 
cumulative incidence of death as a result of lymphoma or treatment was higher 
than death as a result of all other causes for each age group (including 
patients ≥ 70 years of age at diagnosis [25.4% v 16.6%]) Follicular Lymphoma 
International Prognostic Index score 3 to 5 (27.4% v 5.2%), but not Follicular 
Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score 0 to 1 (4.0% v 3.7%); for patients 
who failed to achieve event-free survival within 24 months from diagnosis (36.1% 
v 7.0%), but not for patients who achieved event-free survival within 24 months 
of diagnosis (6.7% v 5.7%); and for patients with a history of transformed FL 
(45.9% v 4.7%), but not among patients without (8.1% v 6.2%). Overall, 77 of 140 
deaths as a result of lymphoma occurred in patients whose FL transformed after 
diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Despite the improvement in overall survival in patients with FL in 
the rituximab era, their leading COD remains lymphoma, especially after disease 
transformation. Treatment-related mortality also represents a concern, which 
supports the need for less-toxic therapies.

OBJECTIVE: Laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) is resource-intensive disease. The 
cost-effectiveness of LTS treatments has not been adequately explored. We aimed 
to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing open reconstruction 
(cricotracheal/tracheal resection [CTR/TR]) with endoscopic dilation in the 
treatment of LTS.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center (2013-2017).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four LTS patients were recruited. Annual costs were 
derived from the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Johns 
Hopkins University. Cost-effectiveness analysis compared CTR/TR versus 
endoscopic dilation at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) over 5- and 10-year time horizons. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated with deterministic 
analysis and tested for sensitivity with univariate and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Mean LTS costs were $4080.09 (SE, $569.29) annually for related health 
care visits. The major risk factor for increased cost was etiology of stenosis. 
As compared with idiopathic patients, patients with intubation-related stenosis 
had significantly higher annual costs ($5286.56 vs $2873.62, P = .03). The cost 
of CTR/TR was $8583.91 (SE, $2263.22). Over a 5-year time horizon, CTR/TR gained 
$896 per QALY over serial dilations and was cost-effective. Over a 10-year time 
horizon, CTR/TR dominated dilations with a lower cost and higher QALY.
CONCLUSION: The cost of treatment for LTS is significant. Patients with 
intubation-related stenosis have significantly higher annual costs than do 
idiopathic patients. CTR/TR contributes significantly to cost in LTS but is 
cost-effective versus endoscopic dilations for appropriately selected patients 
over a 5- and 10-year horizon.

Salmonella infections remain an important public health issue in Canada and 
worldwide. Although the majority of Salmonella cases are self-limiting, some 
will lead to severe symptoms and occasionally severe invasive infections, 
especially in vulnerable populations such as seniors. This study was performed 
to assess temporal trends of Salmonella cases in seniors over 15 years 
(2014-2028) and assess possible impact of demographic shift on national 
incidence; taking into account of trends in other age groups. The numbers of 
reported Salmonella cases in seniors (60 years and over) in eight provinces and 
territories for a period of fifteen years were analysed (1998-2013) using a 
time-adjusted Poisson regression model. With the demographic changes predicted 
in the age-structure of the population and in the absence of any targeted 
interventions, our analysis showed the incidence of Salmonella cases in seniors 
could increase by 16% by 2028 and the multi-provincial incidence could increase 
by 5.3%. As a result, the age distribution amongst the Salmonella cases is 
expected to change with a higher proportion of cases in seniors and a smaller 
proportion in children (0-4 years old). Over the next decades, cases of 
infection, hospitalizations and deaths associated with Salmonella in seniors 
could represent a challenge to public health due to an aging population in 
Canada. As life expectancy increases in Canada, identification of unique risk 
factors and targeted prevention in seniors should be pursued to reduce the 
impact of the demographic shift on disease incidence.

Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.

STUDY DESIGN: Single-center, retrospective cohort study.
PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes in patients who 
underwent palliative posterior instrumentation (PPI) versus those who underwent 
corpectomy with cage reconstruction (CCR) for thoracolumbar pathological 
fracture.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: The requirement for anterior support after corpectomy 
has been emphasized in the treatment of pathological fractures of the vertebrae. 
However, for patients with a relatively short life expectancy, anterior 
reconstruction may not be required and posterior instrumentation alone may 
provide adequate stabilization.
METHODS: A total of 43 patients with metastases of the thoracolumbar spine 
underwent surgery in the department of orthopaedic and traumatology of Istanbul 
University Faculty of Medicine from 2003 to 2016. Surgical outcomes were 
assessed on the basis of survival status, pre- and postoperative pain, 
complication rate, and operation time.
RESULTS: PPI was performed for 22 patients and CCR was performed for 21 
patients. In the PPI group, the follow-up period of the five surviving patients 
was 32 months. The remaining 17 patients died with a mean survival duration of 
12.3 months postoperatively. In the CCR group, the five surviving patients were 
followed up for an average of 14.1 months. The remaining 16 patients died with a 
mean survival duration of 18.7 months postoperatively. No statistically 
significant difference (p=0.812) was noted in the survival duration. The Visual 
Analog Scale scores of the patients were significantly reduced after both 
procedures, with no significant difference noted on the basis of the type of 
surgical intervention (p>0.05). The complication rate in the CCR group (33.3%) 
was higher compared with that in the PPI group (22.7%); however, this difference 
was not noted to be statistically significant (p=0.379). The average operation 
time in the PPI group (149 minutes) was significantly shorter (p=0.04) than that 
in the CCR group (192 minutes).
CONCLUSIONS: The PPI technique can decompress the tumor for functional 
improvement and can stabilize the spinal structure to provide pain relief.
