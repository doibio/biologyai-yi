BACKGROUND: The fullPIERS risk prediction model was developed to identify which 
women admitted with confirmed diagnosis of preeclampsia are at highest risk of 
developing serious maternal complications. The model discriminates well between 
women who develop (vs. those who do not) adverse maternal outcomes. It has been 
externally validated in several populations. We assessed whether placental 
growth factor (PlGF), a biomarker associated with preeclampsia risk, adds 
incremental value to the fullPIERS model.
METHODS: Using a cohort of women admitted into tertiary hospitals in 
well-resourced settings (the USA and Canada), between May 2010 to February 2012, 
we evaluated the incremental value of PlGF added to fullPIERS for prediction of 
adverse maternal outcomes within 48 h after admission with confirmed 
preeclampsia. The discriminatory performance of PlGF and the fullPIERS model 
were assessed in this cohort using the area under the receiver's operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) while the extended model (fullPIERS +PlGF) was 
assessed based on net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated discrimination 
improvement (IDI) performances.
RESULTS: In a cohort of 541 women delivered shortly (< 1 week) after 
presentation, 8.1% experienced an adverse maternal outcome within 48 h of 
admission. Prediction of adverse maternal outcomes was not improved by addition 
of PlGF to fullPIERS (NRI: -8.7, IDI - 0.06). Discriminatory performance (AUROC) 
was 0.67 [95%CI: 0.59-0.75] for fullPIERS only and 0.67 [95%CI: 0.58-0.76]) for 
fullPIERS extended with PlGF, a performance worse than previously documented in 
fullPIERS external validation studies (AUROC > 0.75).
CONCLUSIONS: While fullPIERS model performance may have been affected by 
differences in healthcare context between this study cohort and the model 
development and validation cohorts, future studies are required to confirm 
whether PlGF adds incremental benefit to the fullPIERS model for prediction of 
adverse maternal outcomes in preeclampsia in settings where expectant management 
is practiced.

BACKGROUND: We evaluated the long-term cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive 
traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) and to compare the cost-effectiveness of a 
combined treatment consisting of compound Apocynum tablets and Nifedipine 
sustained-release tablets with the cost-effectiveness of treatment with 
Nifedipine sustained-release tablets alone.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate the potential incremental 
cost-effectiveness per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) to be gained from 
compound Apocynum tablets and Nifedipine sustained-release tablets compared with 
Nifedipine sustained-release tablets alone. Model parameter estimates were 
informed by previously published studies. The direct medical costs of 
outpatients with hypertension were estimated from the health care provider's 
perspective. A 5% annual discount rate was applied to both costs and QALYs.
RESULTS: TCMs combined with Nifedipine sustained-release tablets group generated 
a total 20-year cost of 11,517.94 RMB (US $1739.87), whereas Nifedipine 
sustained-release tablets alone group resulted in a 20-year cost of 7253.71 RMB 
(US $1095.73). TCMs combined with Nifedipine sustained-release tablets group 
resulted in a generation of 12.69 QALYs, whereas Nifedipine sustained-release 
tablets alone group resulted in 12.50. The incremental cost-utility ratio was 
22,443.32 RMB (US $3390.23) per QALY. Considering the threshold of 1 GDP per 
capita in China in 2018 (US $9764.95), the combination of compound Apocynum 
tablets and Nifedipine sustained-release tablets was a cost-effective strategy. 
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed unchanged results over an 
acceptable range.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining Traditional Chinese Medicines with chemical medicines is 
more cost-effective strategy in the treatment of hypertension.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess coronary accessibility after 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)-in-TAVR using multidetector 
computed tomography.
BACKGROUND: Expanding TAVR to patients with longer life expectancy may involve 
more frequent bioprosthetic valve failure and need for redo TAVR. Coronary 
access after TAVR-in-TAVR may be challenging, particularly as the leaflets from 
the initial transcatheter heart valve (THV) will form a neo-skirt following 
TAVR-in-TAVR.
METHODS: In 45 patients treated with different combinations of CoreValve and 
Evolut (CV/EV) THVs with supra-annular leaflet position and SAPIEN THVs with 
intra-annular leaflet position, post-TAVR-in-TAVR multidetector computed 
tomographic scans were analyzed to examine coronary accessibility.
RESULTS: After TAVR-in-TAVR, the coronary arteries originated below the top of 
the neo-skirt in 90% of CV/EV-first cases compared with 67% of SAPIEN-first 
cases (p = 0.009). For these coronary arteries originating below the top of 
the neo-skirt, the distance between the THV and the aortic wall was <3 mm in 56% 
and 25% of CV/EV-first and SAPIEN-first cases, respectively (p = 0.035). 
Coronary access may be further complicated by THV-THV stent frame strut 
misalignment in 53% of CV/EV-in-CV/EV cases. The risk for technically impossible 
coronary access was 27% and 10% in CV/EV-first and SAPIEN-first cases, 
respectively (p = 0.121). Absence of THV interference with coronary 
accessibility can be expected in 8% and 33% of CV/EV-first and SAPIEN-first 
cases, respectively (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Coronary access after TAVR-in-TAVR may be challenging in a 
significant proportion of patients. THVs with intra-annular leaflet position or 
low commissural height and large open cells may be preferable 
in terms of coronary access after TAVR-in-TAVR.

OBJECTIVE: Estimating survival can aid care planning, but the use of absolute 
survival projections can be challenging for patients and clinicians to 
contextualise. We aimed to define how heart failure and its major comorbidities 
contribute to loss of actuarially predicted life expectancy.
METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of 1794 adults with stable 
chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, recruited 
from cardiology outpatient departments of four UK hospitals. Data from an 
11-year maximum (5-year median) follow-up period (999 deaths) were used to 
define how heart failure and its major comorbidities impact on survival, 
relative to an age-sex matched control UK population, using a relative survival 
framework.
RESULTS: After 10 years, mortality in the reference control population was 29%. 
In people with heart failure, this increased by an additional 37% (95% CI 34% to 
40%), equating to an additional 2.2 years of lost life or a 2.4-fold (2.2-2.5) 
excess loss of life. This excess was greater in men than women (2.4 years 
(2.2-2.7) vs 1.6 years (1.2-2.0); p<0.001). In patients without major 
comorbidity, men still experienced excess loss of life, while women experienced 
less and were non-significantly different from the reference population (1 year 
(0.6-1.5) vs 0.4 years (-0.3 to 1); p<0.001). Accrual of comorbidity was 
associated with substantial increases in excess lost life, particularly for 
diabetes, chronic kidney and lung disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity accounts for the majority of lost life expectancy in 
people with heart failure. Women, but not men, without comorbidity experience 
survival close to reference controls.

OBJECTIVES: Previously improving life expectancy and all-cause mortality in the 
UK has stalled since the early 2010s. National analyses have demonstrated 
changes in mortality rates for most age groups and causes of death, and with 
deprived populations most affected. The aims here were to establish whether 
similar changes have occurred across different parts of the UK (countries, 
cities), and to examine cause-specific trends in more detail.
DESIGN: Population-based trend analysis.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Whole populations of countries and selected cities of the 
UK.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: European age-standardised mortality 
rates (calculated by cause of death, country, city, year (1981-2017), age group, 
sex and-for all countries and Scottish cities-deprivation quintiles); changes in 
rates between 5-year periods; summary measures of both relative (relative index 
of inequality) and absolute (slope index of inequality) inequalities.
RESULTS: Changes in mortality from around 2011/2013 were observed throughout the 
UK for all adult age groups. For example, all-age female rates decreased by 
approximately 4%-6% during the 1980s and 1990s, approximately 7%-9% during the 
2000s, but by <1% between 2011/2013 and 2015/2017. Equivalent figures for men 
were 4%-7%, 8%-12% and 1%-3%, respectively. This later period saw increased 
mortality among the most deprived populations, something observed in all 
countries and cities analysed, and for most causes of death: absolute and 
relative inequalities therefore increased. Although similar trends were seen 
across all parts of the UK, particular issues apply in Scotland, for example, 
higher and increasing drug-related mortality (with the highest rates observed in 
Dundee and Glasgow).
CONCLUSIONS: The study presents further evidence of changing mortality in the 
UK. The timing, geography and socioeconomic gradients associated with the 
changes appear to support suggestions that they may result, at least in part, 
from UK Government 'austerity' measures which have disproportionately affected 
the poorest.

BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that the residency status (rural area [RA] vs urban 
clusters [UC] vs urban areas [UA]) affects stage and cancer-specific mortality 
(CSM) in contemporary newly diagnosed prostate cancer (PCa) patients of all 
stages, regardless of treatment.
METHODS: Newly diagnosed PCa patients with available residency status were 
abstracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database 
(2004-2016). Propensity-score (PS) matching, cumulative incidence plots, 
multivariate competing-risks regression (CRR) models were used.
RESULTS: Of 531,468 PCa patients of all stages, 6653 (1.3%) resided in RA, 
50,932 (9.6%) in UC and 473,883 (89.2%) in UA. No statistically significant or 
clinically meaningful differences in stage at presentation or CSM were recorded. 
Conversely, 10-year other cause-mortality (OCM) rates were 27.2% vs 23.7% vs 
18.9% (p < 0.001) in RA vs UC vs UA patients, respectively. In CRR models, RA 
(subhazard ratio [SHR] 1.38; p < 0.001) and UC (SHR 1.18; p < 0.001) were 
independent predictors for higher OCM relative to UA. These differences remained 
statistically significant in fully PS-adjusted multivariate CRR models.
CONCLUSION: RA, and to a lesser extent UC, PCa patients are at higher risk of 
OCM than UA patients. Higher OCM may indicate shorter life expectancy and should 
be considered in treatment decision making.

OBJECTIVE: Poor dietary habits are considered to be the second-leading risk 
factors for mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in the world. 
Dietary patterns are different based on cultural, environmental, technological, 
and economic factors. Nutritional deficiencies of energy, protein, and specific 
micronutrients have been shown to contribute to depressed immune function and 
increased susceptibility to infections. We aimed to explore the relation of 
dietary factors with global infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 in this 
study.
DESIGN: In the current ecological study, the countries that had national dietary 
data from the Global Dietary Databases of the United Nations and coronavirus 
disease statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) were included. The 
countries that had coronavirus disease statistics from the WHO were 
consecutively checked for the recent data of the dietary factors.
SETTING: World.
PARTICIPANTS: 158 countries across the world.
MEASUREMENTS: infection and mortality rates of COVID-19; dietary factors.
RESULTS: The median crude infection and mortality rates by COVID-19 were 87.78 
(IQR: 468.03) and 0.0015 (IQR: 0.0059), respectively. The two highest percentage 
of the crude infection rate were between 0 and 500 (75.9%) and 500-1000 (8.9%) 
per one million persons. The regression analysis showed that the crude infection 
rate has been increased by raising consuming fruits (Beta: 0.237; P=0.006) and 
calcium (Beta: 0.286; P=0.007) and was decreased with rising consuming beans and 
legumes (Beta: -0.145; P=0.038). The analysis showed that the crude mortality 
rate was increased by raising consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (Beta: 0.340; 
P<0.001). Whereas, the crude mortality rate by COVID-19 has been decreased by 
increasing fruits consuming (Beta: -0.226; P=0.047) and beans and legumes (Beta: 
-0.176; P=0.046).
CONCLUSION: The present study showed the higher intake of fruits and 
sugar-sweetened beverages had a positive effect on infection and mortally rates 
by COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the higher intake of beans and legumes 
had a negative effect on both increasing infection and mortality rates.

BACKGROUND: Reactive oxygen species are involved in the etiology and progress of 
many kinds of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory and 
neurodegenerative disorders. Epidemiological studies reported that fruits, 
vegetables, and wines containing a high percentage of phenolics and flavonoids 
showed a positive impact in treating inflammatory diseases, reducing cancer 
risk, and increasing life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: Some Mongolian medicinal plants were studied for their antioxidant 
activity and anticancer effects.
METHODS: Selected Mongolian medicinal plant extracts were examined for their 
antioxidant activity by the DPPH-radical scavenging assay, the content of 
phenolics and flavonoids by Folin-Ciocalteu and the Dowd method, respectively, 
and anti-cancer activities in human hepatoma cell line HepG2 cells by MTT assay.
RESULTS: Methanol extract from Hippophae rhamnoides L. leaf and ethanol extract 
from Artemisia macrocephala Jacq. ex Bess. showed the highest efficiency to 
scavenge free radicals. Ethanol extracts from Hippophae rhamnoides L. grain and 
Paeonio anomala L. leaf showed the highest total phenolics content, whereas 
Hippophae rhamnoides L. fruit methanol extract and ethanol extract from Caragana 
leucophloea pojark. mentioned the highest flavonoids content. The Artemisia 
macrocephala Jacq. ex Bess seed wallet and Paeonia anomala L. seed wallet showed 
the most potent antiproliferative effects against human liver cancer HepG2 cell 
line. Gnetin-H compound was isolated from the Paeonio anomala L. seed wallet 
extract, and its molecular structure was determined by 1H and 13C NMR spectrum 
and IR spectroscopy methods.
CONCLUSION: The screening study on anti-oxidative effects of 21 extracts from 15 
Mongolian medicinal plants showed anti-oxidative activities and was rich in 
phenolics and flavonoids. Among these, methanol extract of the Hippophae 
rhamnoides L. leaf showed a better anti-oxidative effect than the ethanol 
extract. Artemisia macrocephala Jacq. ex Bess and Paeonia anomala L. seed wallet 
mentioned the best anti-cancer effects. Gnetin-H, methyl gallate, ethylgallate 
were the major components in the extract from the Paeonio anomala L. seed 
wallet. Finally, the molecular structure of gnetin-H was determined by NMR and 
IR spectroscopy. Further investigation, especially in vivo antioxidant activity, 
is needed to justify the use of a natural source of antioxidants to prevent the 
progression of diseases such as cancer.

We evaluated whether using county-level data to characterize public health 
measures in cities biases the characterization of city populations. We compared 
4 public health and sociodemographic measures in 447 US cities (percent of 
children living in poverty, percent of non-Hispanic Black population, 
age-adjusted cardiovascular disease mortality, life expectancy at birth) to the 
same measures calculated for counties that contain those cities. We found 
substantial and highly variable city-county differences within and across 
metrics, which suggests that use of county data to proxy city measures could 
hamper accurate allocation of public health resources and appreciation of the 
urgency of public health needs in specific locales.

Columbia Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C. 
(Baird).

BACKGROUND: Comparing adverse outcomes following alternative surgical 
interventions is a complex process for both patients and providers. 
Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are used globally as a quantitative 
indicator of burden of disease. However, DALYs have not been applied to the 
burden of postoperative complications. This study explores the feasibility and 
utility of DALYs in measuring the burden of postoperative complications, using 2 
pediatric surgical procedures as a test model.
METHODS: A literature review was undertaken of postoperative complications 
following pediatric inguinal hernia repair and intestinal atresia repair. 
Relevant studies were included, and incidence rates and durations of all key 
complications were identified. Using existing disability weights of equivalent 
health states to the complications, we estimated the burden in DALYs of each 
complication. These estimates were combined into a unitary procedure-specific 
complication burden score.
RESULTS: The key complications contributing to the postoperative burden 
following inguinal hernia repair were recurrence (0.016 DALYs), hydrocele 
(0.010), metachronous hernia (0.014) and port-site hernia (0.012). In the case 
of intestinal atresia repair, death (6.278), reoperation (12.100), stenosis 
(5.025) and anastomotic stricture (5.327) accounted for most of the 
postoperative DALYs. The complication burden score was 0.06 DALYs for inguinal 
hernia and 36.86 for intestinal atresia repair.
CONCLUSION: As a proof of concept, this study supports the feasibility of using 
DALYs to derive a complication burden score following surgical intervention, and 
to our knowledge it represents the first application of burden of disease 
metrics to postoperative adverse outcomes. Future studies should focus on 
deriving de novo disability weights for common postoperative complications and 
adverse outcomes.

Publisher: CONTEXTE: La comparaison des issues indésirables découlant 
d’interventions chirurgicales de substitution est complexe, tant pour les 
patients que pour les fournisseurs de soins. Partout au monde, les années de vie 
ajustées en fonction de l’incapacité (AVAI) sont utilisées comme indicateur 
quantitatif du fardeau de la maladie. Or, les AVAI n’ont jamais été appliquées 
au fardeau des complications postopératoires. La présente étude porte sur la 
faisabilité et l’utilité du recours aux AVAI pour mesurer le fardeau des 
complications postopératoires. Elle se sert de 2 interventions chirurgicales 
pédiatriques comme modèles.
MÉTHODES: Nous avons mené une revue de la littérature sur les complications 
postopératoires suivant une réparation de hernie inguinale et une correction 
d’atrésie intestinale chez des populations pédiatriques. Nous avons retenu les 
études pertinentes et dégagé le taux d’incidence ainsi que la durée des 
principales complications. Nous nous sommes également servis du fardeau pondéré 
de l’incapacité liée à un trouble de santé équivalent à chacune des 
complications pour estimer le fardeau, en AVAI, des complications. Les 
estimations ont ensuite été combinées pour obtenir un score unitaire 
correspondant au fardeau des complications associées à chaque intervention.
RÉSULTATS: Les principales complications contribuant au fardeau postopératoire 
associé à la réparation de hernie inguinale étaient la récurrence (0,016 AVAI), 
l’hydrocèle (0,010 AVAI), la hernie métachrone (0,014 AVAI) et la hernie au site 
de laparoscopie (0,012). En ce qui a trait à la correction d’atrésie 
intestinale, le décès (6,278 AVAI), la réopération (12,100 AVAI), la sténose 
(5,025 AVAI) et le rétrécissement anastomotique (5,327 AVAI) étaient à l’origine 
de la plupart des AVAI postopératoires. Le score du fardeau des complications 
était de 0,06 AVAI pour la réparation de hernie inguinale et de 36,86 AVAI pour 
la correction d’atrésie intestinale.
CONCLUSION: Cette étude, comme validation de principe, montre qu’il est possible 
d’utiliser les AVAI pour obtenir un score correspondant au fardeau des 
complications associées à une intervention chirurgicale. Elle est également la 
première, à notre connaissance, à appliquer un score de fardeau de la maladie 
aux issues postopératoires indésirables. Des études ultérieures devraient être 
axées sur le calcul de nouveaux fardeaux pondérés pour les complications 
postopératoires et les issues indésirables courantes.

INTRODUCTION: We aim to discuss the utility of self-expandable esophageal metal 
stent (SEMS) in variceal bleeding in challenging cases.
METHODS: Case description, discussion on patient management and decision-making 
process in an uncommon situation, from a multidisciplinary point of view.
RESULTS: We report a case of a cirrhotic patient with refractory variceal 
bleeding who underwent a SEMS placement, which remained in situ for 9 months. 
This decision was based on the initial poor status and short life expectancy, 
limiting the consideration of other options for lowering portal hypertension, 
along with an underlying prothrombotic predisposition. However, the patient's 
general and hepatic improvement and the development of dysphagia led to the SEMS 
removal, exposing a large esophageal-tracheal fistula.
DISCUSSION: Early patient evaluation, risks of long-term SEMS, and life 
expectancy should be taken in consideration before SEMS placement.

The audit provides a detailed analysis of the burden of osteoporosis and 
differences between Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz 
Republic, the Russian Federation, and Uzbekistan with regard to prevalence of 
osteoporosis and incidence of osteoporotic fractures, future demographic 
changes, diagnostic resources, and treatment availability.
PURPOSE: This paper describes the results of the Audit on Burden of Osteoporosis 
in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the 
Russian Federation, and Uzbekistan.
METHODS: We carried out a review of the available literature and a survey of the 
representatives of the national osteoporosis societies. All the information 
available in English, Russian, or national languages including the publications 
of local or regional importance was analyzed.
RESULTS: The expected number of osteoporosis patients varies from 240,000 in 
Armenia to 16 million in Russia. Low-energy fractures are a serious health 
problem in all countries with the highest incidence in Kazakhstan and Russia. 
The rate of hip fracture patients' hospitalization in the majority of countries 
is low (33-80%). In the coming decades the populations, in particular, in 
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, will continue to show increases in life 
expectancy with a corresponding increase in the number of fractures in older 
people. Thus, in 2050, the number of hip fractures in these countries will 
increase by 2.5-3.5 times. However, the availability of DXA devices in the 
region is low (0.2-1.3 per million), and DXA tests are expensive. Almost all 
modern treatments for osteoporosis are available, but the costs are high even 
for alendronate. Urgent action is needed at the national level in each country 
including recognition of osteoporosis as a priority health issue.
CONCLUSION: Osteoporosis is an important health problem in the countries of the 
Eurasian region that will only get worse in the future due to expected 
demographic changes.

The frequency of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is growing rapidly with longer life 
expectancy and the consequent increase of people with a high risk of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Anacardic acid (AA) has several pharmacological 
actions, such as antioxidants, anticholinesterase, and anti-inflammatory, which 
are related to the protection against aging disorders. Also, the metals copper 
and zinc are co-factors of antioxidant enzymes that can be associated with AA to 
improve brain-protective action. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of 
AA metal complexes using copper and zinc chelators to produce potential agents 
against Alzheimer's disease. For this purpose, Cu and Zn were linked to AA in 
the ratio of 1:1 in a basic medium. The complexes' formation was confirmed by 
ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy. The toxicity was evaluated in the 
zebrafish model, and other information related to AD was obtained using the 
zebrafish model of anxiety. AA-Zn and AA-Cu complexes showed better antioxidant 
action than free AA. In the anti-AChE activity, AA was like the AA-Cu complex. 
In models using adult zebrafish, no toxicity for AA complexes was found, and in 
the locomotor model, AA-Cu demonstrated possible anxiolytic action. In in silico 
experiments comparing AA and AA-Cu complex, the coupling energy with the enzyme 
was lower for the AA-Cu complex, showing better interaction, and also the 
distances of the active site amino acids with this complex were lower, similar 
to galantamine, the standard anti-AChE inhibitor. Thus, AA-Cu showed interesting 
results for more detailed study in experiments related to Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Antithrombotic drugs decrease stroke risk in patients with atrial 
fibrillation, but they increase bleeding risk, particularly in older adults at 
high risk for falls. We aimed to determine the most cost-effective 
antithrombotic therapy in older adults with atrial fibrillation who are at high 
risk for falls.
METHODS: We conducted a mathematical modelling study from July 2019 to March 
2020 based on the Ontario, Canada, health care system. We derived the base-case 
age, sex and fall risk distribution from a published cohort of older adults at 
risk for falls, and the bleeding and stroke risk parameters from an atrial 
fibrillation trial population. Using a probabilistic microsimulation Markov 
decision model, we calculated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total cost 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for each of acetylsalicylic 
acid (ASA), warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and edoxaban. Cost data 
were adjusted for inflation to 2018 values. The analysis used the Ontario public 
payer perspective with a lifetime horizon.
RESULTS: In our model, the most cost-effective antithrombotic therapy for atrial 
fibrillation in older patients at risk for falls was apixaban, with an ICER of 
$8517 per QALY gained (5.86 QALYs at $92 056) over ASA. It was a dominant 
strategy over warfarin and the other antithrombotic agents. There was moderate 
uncertainty in cost-effectiveness ranking, with apixaban as the preferred choice 
in 66% of model iterations (given willingness to pay of $50 000 per QALY 
gained); edoxaban, 30 mg, was preferred in 31% of iterations. Sensitivity 
analysis across ranges of age, bleeding risk and fall risk still favoured 
apixaban over the other medications.
INTERPRETATION: From a public payer perspective, apixaban is the most 
cost-effective antithrombotic agent in older adults at high risk for falls. 
Health care funders should implement strategies to encourage use of the most 
cost-effective medication in this population.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the decision-making process in fit and frail older breast 
cancer patients.
METHODS: Breast cancer patients aged ≥70 years who completed the G8 frailty 
screening tool (G8) were included in this retrospective study. Socio-demographic 
and clinical characteristics were collected, as well as information from 
geriatric assessment (GA). Treatment decisions were compared with national 
guidelines.
RESULTS: Of 177 patients, 85 patients were considered fit by the G8 (G8-fit) and 
92 patients frail (G8-frail). All G8-fit and 53 G8-frail were proposed for 
surgery. GA was performed in 34 patients (9 G8-fit; 25 G8-frail) of whom 16 (2 
G8-fit;14 G8-frail) were considered frail (GA-frail). 28 out of these 34 
patients were considered fit for surgery (including 11 GA-frail); their 
impairments were unlikely to interfere with surgery or life expectancy. Reasons 
for adjusting treatment were physical/cognitive condition and patient 
preference. Ultimately, 123 patients underwent surgery in accordance with 
guidelines (81 G8-fit;42 G8-frail, p < 0.001). Survival was reduced in G8-frail 
compared to G8-fit (p = 0.001), but G8 lost its association with mortality in 
multivariable survival analysis. Among patients undergoing surgery, no 
difference in mortality was seen between G8-fit and G8-frail (p = 0.996).
CONCLUSION: The G8 is associated with treatment decisions and did not affect 
survival in patients undergoing surgery. In the decision-making process, the G8 
may help and estimates the need for adaptive care.

BACKGROUND: Fear of childbirth is one of the life challenges the women encounter 
during pregnancy. It is an important source of distress for the women and their 
families and also increases the odds of obstetric complications during 
childbirth. The aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of fear of 
childbirth and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care 
at public health facilities in Arba Minch town, southern Ethiopia.
METHODS: Institution-based cross-sectional study was carried out among pregnant 
women who attended antenatal care at public health facilities in Arba Minch from 
November 1st - 30th 2019. A systematic random sampling technique was employed to 
include the participants. Data were collected through a face-to-face interview 
by using a structured and pretested questionnaire. Wijma Delivery Expectancy 
Questionnaire was used to score fear of childbirth. Epi Data version 3.1 and 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 25.0 software were used for 
data management. Descriptive and analytic analyses were done and statistical 
significance was declared at a p-value < 0.05 and 95% confidence level in 
multivariable analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 387 pregnant women have participated in this study. Forty 
(10.3%) of the pregnant women had a low degree fear, 154(39.8%) had a moderate 
degree fear, 98(25.3%) had a high degree fear, and 95(24.5%) had severe degree 
fear of childbirth. Unplanned pregnancy (AOR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.12, 4.74), 
current pregnancy-related complications (AOR = 6.24, 95% CI: 2.72, 14.29), and 
poor social support (AOR = 1.93, 95%CI: 1.01, 3.68) were factors significantly 
associated with severe degree fear of childbirth.
CONCLUSIONS: Almost three-fourth of the pregnant women in this study area had 
moderate to severe degree fear of childbirth. Tailoring counseling during 
antenatal care visits is needed to address those women who are at a high risk of 
considerable childbirth fear and its health consequences.

BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are a group of inherited metabolic 
diseases, which are characterized by the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans, and 
eventually lead to the progressive damage of various tissues and organs.
METHODS: An epidemiological study of MPS in Taiwan was performed using multiple 
sources. The survival and diagnostic age for different types of MPS between 1985 
and 2019 were evaluated.
RESULTS: Between 1985 and 2019, there were 175 patients diagnosed with MPS 
disorders in the Taiwanese population, with a median diagnostic age of 
3.9 years. There were 21 (12%), 78 (45%), 33 (19%), 32 (18%) and 11 (6%) 
patients diagnosed with MPS I, II, III, IV and VI, respectively, with median 
diagnostic ages of 1.5, 3.8, 4.7, 4.5 and 3.7 years, respectively. Diagnosis of 
MPS patients was significantly earlier in recent decades (p < 0.01). Pilot 
newborn screening programs for MPS I, II, VI, IVA, and IIIB were progressively 
introduced in Taiwan from 2016, and 48% (16/33) of MPS patients diagnosed 
between 2016 and 2019 were diagnosed by one of these screening programs, with a 
median diagnostic age at 0.2 years. For patients born between 2016 and 2019, up 
to 94% (16/17) were diagnosed with MPS via the newborn screening programs. At 
the time of this study, 81 patients had passed away with a median age at death 
of 15.6 years. Age at diagnosis was positively correlated with life expectancy 
(p < 0.01). Life expectancy also significantly increased between 1985 and 2019, 
however this increase was gradual (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The life expectancy of Taiwanese patients with MPS has improved in 
recent decades and patients are being diagnosed earlier. Because of the 
progressive nature of the disease, early diagnosis by newborn screening programs 
and timely implementation of early therapeutic interventions may lead to better 
clinical outcomes.
