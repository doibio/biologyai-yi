Diagnosis and treatment of HBV/HDV infection means for the patient to be able to 
maintain working capacity, to increase quality of life, to prevent cancer, and 
to prolong life expectancy, while society benefits from eliminating the chances 
of further transmission of the viruses, and decreasing the overall costs of 
serious complications. The guideline delineates the treatment algorithms for 
2017 set by a consensus meeting of physicians involved in the treatment of these 
diseases. The prevalence of HBV infection in the Hungarian general population is 
0.5-0.7%. The indications of treatment is based upon viral examinations 
(including viral nucleic acid determination), determinations of disease activity 
and stage (including biochemical, pathologic, and/or non-invasive methods), and 
excluding contraindications. To avoid unnecessary side effects and for 
cost-effective approach the guideline stresses the importance of quick and 
detailed virologic evaluations, the applicability of elastography as an 
acceptable alternative of liver biopsy in this regard, as well as the relevance 
of appropriate consistent follow up schedule for viral response during therapy. 
The first choice of therapy in chronic hepatitis B infection can be pegylated 
interferon for 48 weeks or continuous entecavir or tenofovir therapy. The latter 
two must be continued for at least 12 months after hepatitis B surface antigen 
seroconversion. Adefovir dipivoxil is recommended mainly in combination therapy. 
Lamivudine is no longer a first choice; patients currently taking lamivudine 
must switch if response is inadequate. Appropriate treatment of patients taking 
immunosuppressive medications is highly recommended. Pegylated interferon based 
therapy is recommended for the treatment of concomitant hepatitis D infection.

Objective: To assess the disease burden for low back pain in China in 2013 and 
analyzed the change of it between 1990 and 2013. Methods: Data was from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013). The burden of low back pain 
(LBP) among age groups, gender groups, provinces (excluding Taiwan China) groups 
was assessed by years lived with disability (YLD), including YLD, YLD rate, 
proportion of YLD due to LBP. The change of the YLD for LBP was analyzed between 
1990 and 2013 by age-standardized YLD rate using the world standard population 
of 2000-2025 WHO. Results: In 2013, The YLD for LBP was 16 347 thousand (the 
leading cause of YLD in China), and the proportion of YLD in age group 30-59 
years old was 54.6% (8 929/16 347) . The age-standardized rate in China was 1 
072.6/100 000, and the rates in Guangdong (1 742.2/100 000) , Shanghai (1 
227.8/100 000) and Beijing (1 136.6/100 000) were higher than in other 
provinces. The proportion of YLD due to LBP was 11.8%. LBP was the leading cause 
of YLD in China. Compared with 1990, the growth rates of age-standardized rate, 
proportion of YLD and YLD, were 5.6%, 25.5% and 72.1%, desperately. Conclusion: 
Low back pain was the leading cause of YLD in China in 2013. Compared with 1990, 
the disease burden for low back pain increased rapidly.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends all countries consider 
screening for H. pylori to prevent gastric cancer. We therefore aimed to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of a H. pylori serology-based screening program 
in New Zealand, a country that includes population groups with relatively high 
gastric cancer rates.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed using life-tables and morbidity data from 
a national burden of disease study. The modelled screening program reduced the 
incidence of non-cardia gastric cancer attributable to H. pylori, if infection 
was identified by serology screening, and for the population expected to be 
reached by the screening program. A health system perspective was taken and 
detailed individual-level costing data was used.
RESULTS: For adults aged 25-69 years old, nation-wide screening for H. pylori 
was found to have an incremental cost of US$196 million (95% uncertainty 
interval [95% UI]: $182-$211 million) with health gains of 14,200 QALYs (95% UI: 
5,100-26,300). Cost per QALY gained was US$16,500 ($7,600-$38,400) in the total 
population and 17% (6%-29%) of future gastric cancer cases could be averted with 
lifetime follow-up. A targeted screening program for Māori only (indigenous 
population), was more cost-effective at US$8,000 ($3,800-$18,500) per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: This modeling study found that H. pylori screening was likely to be 
cost-effective in this high-income country, particularly for the indigenous 
population. While further research is needed to help clarify the precise 
benefits, costs and adverse effects of such screening programs, there seems a 
reasonable case for policy-makers to give pilot programs consideration, 
particularly for any population groups with relatively elevated rates of gastric 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in boys 
with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We recently showed in a 12-month 
double-blind randomized controlled trial that adding eplerenone to background 
medical therapy was cardioprotective in this population. The objective of this 
study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of longer-term eplerenone therapy 
in boys with DMD.
RESULTS: Eleven subjects (phase 1 baseline median [range] age: 13 [7 - 25] 
years) from the original 12-month trial at a single participating center were 
enrolled. Importantly, those who entered the extension study who had been on 
eplerenone previously were significantly older than those who had originally 
been on placebo (median age 10.5 vs. 18.0 years, p = 0.045). During an 
additional 24-month open-label extension study, all boys received eplerenone 25 
mg orally once daily to treat preclinical DMD cardiomyopathy, defined as evident 
myocardial damage by late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance 
(LGE) with preserved ejection fraction (EF). The threshold for potassium level, 
the primary safety measure, was not exceeded in any non-hemolyzed blood sample. 
Over 24 months, left ventricular (LV) systolic strain, a more sensitive marker 
whose more negative values indicate greater contractility significantly improved 
(median change -4.4%, IQR -5.8 to -0.9%) in younger subjects whereas older 
subjects' strain remained stable without significant worsening or improvement 
(median change 0.2%, IQR -1.1 to 4.3%). EF and extent of myocardial damage by 
LGE remained stable in both groups over 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Eplerenone offers effective and safe cardioprotection for boys with 
DMD, particularly when started at a younger age. Eplerenone is a useful clinical 
therapeutic option, particularly if treatment is initiated earlier in life when 
cardiac damage is minimal.

The management of cancer in older aged people is becoming a common problem due 
to the aging of the population. There are many variables determining the complex 
situation that are interconnected. Some of them can be assessed, such as risk of 
mortality and risk of treatment complications, but many others are still 
unknown, such as the course of disease, the host-related factors that influence 
cancer aggressiveness, and the phenotype heralding risk of permanent 
treatment-related damage.This article presents a dynamic and personalized 
approach to older people with cancer based on our experience on aging, cancer, 
and their biological interactions. Also, novel treatments and management 
approaches to older individuals, based on their functional age and their social 
and emotional needs, are thoughtfully explored here. The Oncologist 
2017;22:335-342 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The goal of this article is to 
suggest a practical approach to complexity, a clinical situation becoming 
increasingly common with the aging of the population. Beginning with the 
analysis of two clinical cases, the authors offer an algorithm for approaching 
cancer in the older person that involves the assessment of life expectancy 
without cancer, the risk that cancer might compromise a patient's survival, 
function, or quality of life, and the potential benefits and risks of the 
treatments based on a clinical evaluation. The authors then review possible 
laboratory assessment of functional age and the importance of rapid-learning 
databases in the study of cancer and age.

[ICD in elderly patients].

Treatment with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) represents 
a prognostic but not symptomatic therapy. It should therefore be restricted to 
patients where an improvement of prognosis is possible and reasonable. ICD 
implantation should only be performed in patients with a life expectancy of at 
least 1 year at reasonable quality of life. The decision in which patient 
improvement of prognosis is no longer a desirable target is problematic, both 
medically and ethically. It is not entirely clear in which elderly patient an 
ICD therapy can convey prognostic benefit despite comorbidity and competitive 
life-threatening diseases, as it is unclear how old age should be defined. In 
primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death, data on a prognostic benefit of the 
ICD in elderly patients are less clear than in secondary prophylaxis since 
short-term mortality due to other causes is higher in the elderly. However, 
elderly ICD patients have a similar rate of appropriate ICD therapy as younger 
patients. Complications at ICD implantation or long-term lead failure do not 
occur more frequently in elderly patients and therefore do not represent 
a reason to withhold ICD implantation in elderly patients or to set an age limit 
above which ICD implantation should no longer be performed. The ICD indication 
in elderly patients should be individualized depending on remaining life 
expectancy, comorbidity, "biological age" and patient preferences which play 
a particularly important role in elderly patients. Aspects of a potential 
improvement in quality of life by the ICD which may also serve as a system for 
antibradycardiac or resynchronization treatment should be included into 
considerations. Deactivation of at least shock therapy should be discussed in 
elderly patients fitted with an ICD if the subject is brought up by the patient 
or if clinical deterioration suggests the need to talk about a "do not 
resuscitate" order. This talk should be performed before death is imminent and 
before an electrical storm in terminal illness leads to multiple shocks by the 
active device.

For refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia patients, allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative treatment option, 
but the disease must be in remission before this can be attempted. "Salvage" 
therapy regimens containing high-dose cytarabine plus fludarabine or cladribine 
with or without anthracyclines or plus mitoxantrone and etoposide fail in 30-50% 
of cases. We report the outcome of 14 patients treated with a clofarabine-based 
treatment administered after at least one failed fludarabine-based "salvage" 
attempt in a "real life" (outside a clinical trial) context. No death related to 
the clofarabine-based treatment was observed. Four of the 14 patients (29%) 
reached complete remission and one (7%) achieved a reduction of marrow blasts to 
fewer than 10%. Three of these five patients were successfully transplanted and 
have shown a long-term survival. The small number of this group of patients does 
not permit the identification of clinical features clearly related to a 
favorable outcome, but we note that all the three long-term survivals were FLT3 
wild type. Clofarabine-based "salvage therapy" in patients with very poor 
expectancy is feasible even after a fludarabine-based salvage attempt, albeit 
with success only in a small percentage of cases (3/14 = 21%).

OBJECTIVES: Extended validation of an index predicting mortality among 
community-dwelling US older adults.
DESIGN/SETTING: Examination of the performance of a previously developed index 
in predicting 10- and 14-year mortality among respondents to the 1997-2000 
National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) using the original development and 
validation cohorts. Follow-up mortality data are now available through 2011.
PARTICIPANTS: 16,063 respondents from the original development cohort and 8,027 
respondents from the original validation cohort. All participants were community 
dwelling and ≥65 years old.
MEASUREMENTS: We calculated risk scores for each respondent based on the 
presence or absence of 11 factors (function, illnesses, behaviors, demographics) 
that make up the index. Using the Kaplan Meier method, we computed 10- and 
14-year mortality estimates for the development and validation cohorts to 
examine model calibration. We examined model discrimination using the c-index.
RESULTS: Participants in the development and validation cohorts were similar. 
Participants with risk scores 0-4 had 23% risk of 14-year mortality whereas 
respondents with risk scores (13+) had 89% risk of 14-year mortality. The 
c-index of the model in both cohorts was 0.73 for predicting 10-year mortality 
and 0.72 for predicting 14-year mortality. Overall, 18.4% of adults 65-74 years 
and 60.2% of adults ≥75 years have >50% risk of mortality in 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Our index demonstrated excellent calibration and discrimination in 
predicting 10- and 14-year mortality among community-dwelling US adults ≥65 
years. Information on long-term prognosis is needed to help clinicians and older 
adults make more informed person-centered medical decisions and to help older 
adults plan for the future.

BACKGROUND: Women diagnosed with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) have a 3-fold 
to 10-fold increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer. The objective of 
this study was to evaluate the life expectancy (LE) and differences in survival 
offered by active surveillance, risk-reducing chemoprevention, and bilateral 
prophylactic mastectomy among women with LCIS.
METHODS: A Markov simulation model was constructed to determine average LE and 
quality-adjusted LE (QALE) gains for hypothetical cohorts of women diagnosed 
with LCIS at various ages under alternative risk-reduction strategies. 
Probabilities for invasive breast cancer, breast cancer-specific mortality, 
other-cause mortality and the effectiveness of preventive strategies were 
derived from published studies and from the National Cancer Institute's 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database.
RESULTS: Assuming a breast cancer incidence from 1.02% to 1.37% per year under 
active surveillance, a woman aged 50 years diagnosed with LCIS would have a 
total LE of 32.78 years and would gain 0.13 years (1.6 months) in LE by adding 
chemoprevention and 0.25 years (3.0 months) in LE by adding bilateral 
prophylactic mastectomy. After quality adjustment, chemoprevention resulted in 
the greatest QALE for women ages 40 to 60 years at LCIS diagnosis, whereas 
surveillance remained the preferred strategy for optimizing QALE among women 
diagnosed at age 65 years and older.
CONCLUSIONS: In this model, among women with a diagnosis of LCIS, breast cancer 
prevention strategies only modestly affected overall survival, whereas 
chemoprevention was modeled as the preferred management strategy for optimizing 
invasive disease-free survival while prolonging QALE form women younger than 65 
years. Cancer 2017;123:2609-17. © 2017 American Cancer Society.

Purpose Patients who are diagnosed with stage IV metastatic melanoma have an 
estimated 5-year relative survival rate of only 17%. Randomized controlled 
trials of recent US Food and Drug Administration-approved immune checkpoint 
inhibitors-pembrolizumab (PEM), nivolumab (NIVO), and ipilumumab 
(IPI)-demonstrate improved patient outcomes, but the optimal treatment sequence 
in patients with BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma remains unclear. To inform 
policy makers about the value of these treatments, we developed a Markov model 
to compare the cost-effectiveness of different strategies for sequencing novel 
agents for the treatment of advanced melanoma. Materials and Methods We 
developed Markov models by using a US-payer perspective and lifetime horizon to 
estimate costs (2016 US$) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for treatment 
sequences with first-line NIVO, IPI, NIVO + IPI, PEM every 2 weeks, and PEM 
every 3 weeks. Health states were defined for initial treatment, first and 
second progression, and death. Rates for drug discontinuation, frequency of 
adverse events, disease progression, and death obtained from randomized phase 
III trials were used to determine the likelihood of transition between states. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate 
model uncertainty. Results PEM every 3 weeks followed by second-line IPI was 
both more effective and less costly than dacarbazine followed by IPI then NIVO, 
or IPI followed by NIVO. Compared with the first-line dacarbazine treatment 
strategy, NIVO followed by IPI produced an incremental cost effectiveness ratio 
of $90,871/QALY, and first-line NIVO + IPI followed by carboplatin plus 
paclitaxel chemotherapy produced an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of 
$198,867/QALY. Conclusion For patients with treatment-naive BRAF wild-type 
advanced melanoma, first-line PEM every 3 weeks followed by second-line IPI or 
first-line NIVO followed by second-line IPI are the most cost-effective, 
immune-based treatment strategies for metastatic melanoma.

Central and peripheral control of food intake.

Abdalla MM.

The maintenance of the body weight at a stable level is a major determinant in 
keeping the higher animals and mammals survive. Th e body weight depends on the 
balance between the energy intake and energy expenditure. Increased food intake 
over the energy expenditure of prolonged time period results in an obesity. Th e 
obesity has become an important worldwide health problem, even at low levels. 
The obesity has an evil effect on the health and is associated with a shorter 
life expectancy. A complex of central and peripheral physiological signals is 
involved in the control of the food intake. Centrally, the food intake is 
controlled by the hypothalamus, the brainstem, and endocannabinoids and 
peripherally by the satiety and adiposity signals. Comprehension of the signals 
that control food intake and energy balance may open a new therapeutic 
approaches directed against the obesity and its associated complications, as is 
the insulin resistance and others. In conclusion, the present review summarizes 
the current knowledge about the complex system of the peripheral and central 
regulatory mechanisms of food intake and their potential therapeutic 
implications in the treatment of obesity.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a major subtype of diabetes and is usually 
diagnosed at a young age with insulin deficiency. The life expectancy of T1DM 
patients has increased substantially in comparison with that three decades ago 
due to the availability of exogenous insulin, though it is still shorter than 
that of healthy people. However, the relation remains unclear between T1DM and 
dementia as an aging-related disease. We conducted a systematic review of 
existing literature on T1DM and cognition impairments by carrying out searches 
in electronic databases Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. We restricted our 
review to studies involving only human subjects and excluded studies on type 2 
diabetes mellitus or non-classified diabetes. A meta-analysis was first 
performed on the relationship between T1DM and cognitive changes in youths and 
adults respectively. Then the review focused on the cognitive complications of 
T1DM and their relation with the characteristics of T1DM, glycemic control, 
diabetic complications, comorbidities, and others. First, age at onset, disease 
duration, and glycemic dysregulation were delineated for their association with 
cognitive changes. Then diabetic ketoacidosis, angiopathy, and neuropathy were 
examined as diabetic complications for their involvement in cognitive 
impairments. Lastly, body mass index and blood pressure were discussed for their 
relations with the cognitive changes. Future studies are needed to elucidate the 
pathogenesis of T1DM-related cognitive impairments or dementia.

BACKGROUND: Long-term care is one of the most pressing health policy issues in 
Germany. It is expected that the need for long-term care will increase markedly 
in the next decades due to demographic shifts. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the factors associated with preferences for long-term care settings 
in old age individuals in Germany.
METHODS: Based on expert interviews and a systematic review, a questionnaire was 
developed to quantify long-term care preferences. Data were drawn from a 
population-based survey of the German population aged 65 and over in 2015 
(n = 1006).
RESULTS: In multiple logistic regressions, preferences for home care were 
positively associated with providing care for family/friends [OR: 1.6 
(1.0-2.5)], lower self-rated health [OR: 1.3 (1.0-1.6)], and no current need of 
care [OR: 5.5 (1.2-25.7)]. Preferences for care in relatives' homes were 
positively associated with being male [OR: 2.0 (1.4-2.7)], living with partner 
or spouse [OR: 1.8 (1.3-2.4)], having children [OR: 1.6 (1.0-2.5)], private 
health insurance [OR: 1.6 (1.1-2.3)], providing care for family/friends [OR: 1.5 
(1.1-2.0)], and higher self-rated health [OR: 1.2 (1.0-1.4)]. Preferences for 
care in assisted living were positively associated with need of care [OR: 1.9 
(1.0-3.5)] and higher education [for example, University, OR: 3.5 (1.9-6.5)]. 
Preferences for care in nursing home/old age home were positively associated 
with being born in Germany [OR: 1.8 (1.0-3.1)] and lower self-rated health [OR: 
1.2 (1.0-1.4)]. Preferences for care in a foreign country were positively 
associated with lower age [OR: 1.1 (1.0-1.2)] and being born abroad [OR: 5.5 
(2.7-11.2)].
CONCLUSIONS: Numerous variables used are sporadically significant, underlining 
the complex nature of long-term care preferences. A better understanding of 
factors associated with preferences for care settings might contribute to 
improving long-term care health services.

Because of high mortality caused by cardiovascular diseases, various 
fibrinolytic agents with diverse pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties 
have been developed. A novel mutated chimeric tissue plasminogen activator 
(mt-PA) was developed by the removal of first three domains of t-PA, insertion 
of GHRP sequence and mutation towards resistance to plasminogen activator 
inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Mt-PA protein was expressed in Expi293F cells. The 
expression level of mt-PA was found to be 5000 IU/mL. Following purification, 
the pharmacokinetic properties of mt-PA were evaluated in three doses in rats. 
Data related to mt-PA were best fitted to two compartment model. With the 
increase in dose, the Area Under the plasma concentration-time Curve (AUC0→∞) 
increased. The elimination half-life (t1/2) of mt-PA was in the range of 
19.1-26.1 min in three doses while that of Alteplase was 8.3 min. The plasma 
clearance (CLp) of mt-PA ranged from 3.8 to 5.9 mL/min in three doses, which was 
several times lower than that of Alteplase (142.6 mL/min). The mean residence 
time (MRT) of mt-PA ranged from 23.3-31.8 min in three doses, which was 4-5 
times greater than that of Alteplase (6 min). Mt-PA showed extended half-life 
and mean residence time and is a good candidate for further clinical studies.

Extensive literatures have shown approaches for decoding upper limb kinematics 
or muscle activity using multichannel cortical spike recordings toward brain 
machine interface (BMI) applications. However, similar topics regarding lower 
limb remain relatively scarce. We previously reported a system for training 
monkeys to perform visually guided stand and squat tasks. The current study, as 
a follow-up extension, investigates whether lower limb kinematics and muscle 
activity characterized by electromyography (EMG) signals during monkey 
performing stand/squat movements can be accurately decoded from neural spike 
trains in primary motor cortex (M1). Two monkeys were used in this study. 
Subdermal intramuscular EMG electrodes were implanted to 8 right leg/thigh 
muscles. With ample data collected from neurons from a large brain area, we 
performed a spike triggered average (SpTA) analysis and got a series of density 
contours which revealed the spatial distributions of different 
muscle-innervating neurons corresponding to each given muscle. Based on the 
guidance of these results, we identified the locations optimal for chronic 
electrode implantation and subsequently carried on chronic neural data 
recordings. A recursive Bayesian estimation framework was proposed for decoding 
EMG signals together with kinematics from M1 spike trains. Two specific 
algorithms were implemented: a standard Kalman filter and an unscented Kalman 
filter. For the latter one, an artificial neural network was incorporated to 
deal with the nonlinearity in neural tuning. High correlation coefficient and 
signal to noise ratio between the predicted and the actual data were achieved 
for both EMG signals and kinematics on both monkeys. Higher decoding accuracy 
and faster convergence rate could be achieved with the unscented Kalman filter. 
These results demonstrate that lower limb EMG signals and kinematics during 
monkey stand/squat can be accurately decoded from a group of M1 neurons with the 
proposed algorithms. Our findings provide new insights for extending current BMI 
design concepts and techniques on upper limbs to lower limb circumstances. Brain 
controlled exoskeleton, prostheses or neuromuscular electrical stimulators for 
lower limbs are expected to be developed, which enables the subject to 
manipulate complex biomechatronic devices with mind in more harmonized manner.

INTRODUCTION: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are used 
successfully in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes as they are 
associated with low hypoglycemia rates, weight loss and improved glycemic 
control. This study compared, in the Spanish setting, the cost-effectiveness of 
liraglutide 1.8 mg versus lixisenatide 20 μg, both GLP-1 receptor agonists, for 
patients with type 2 diabetes who had not achieved glycemic control targets on 
metformin monotherapy.
METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to project clinical outcomes and 
costs, expressed in 2015 Euros, over patient lifetimes. Baseline cohort data and 
treatment effects were taken from the 26-week, open-label LIRA-LIXI™ trial 
(NCT01973231). Treatment and management costs of diabetes-related complications 
were retrieved from published sources and databases. Future benefits and costs 
were discounted by 3% annually. Sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Compared with lixisenatide 20 μg, liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated 
with higher life expectancy (14.42 vs. 14.29 years), higher quality-adjusted 
life expectancy [9.40 versus 9.26 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] and a 
reduced incidence of diabetes-related complications. Higher acquisition costs 
resulted in higher total costs for liraglutide 1.8 mg (EUR 42,689) than for 
lixisenatide 20 μg (EUR 42,143), but these were partly offset by reduced costs 
of treating diabetes-related complications (EUR 29,613 vs. EUR 30,636). 
Projected clinical outcomes and costs resulted in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR 4113 per QALY gained for liraglutide 1.8 mg 
versus lixisenatide 20 μg.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term projections in the Spanish setting suggest that 
liraglutide 1.8 mg is likely to be cost-effective compared with lixisenatide 
20 μg in type 2 diabetes patients who have not achieved glycemic control targets 
on metformin monotherapy. Liraglutide 1.8 mg presents a clinically and 
economically attractive treatment option in the Spanish setting.

Primary hip replacement in young osteoarthritic patients current practices in 
one UK region.

Approximately 10% of primary hip replacements performed each year for 
osteoarthritis are in patients aged 55 or younger. These patients have a longer 
life expectancy and a higher activity level than an older cohort, which may 
translate to higher revision rates. We utilized a regional hip register (Trent 
and Welsh Arthroplasty Audit Group (TWAAG)) to review current surgical practice 
in this age group. From 01/01/2000 31/12/2002, we were notified of 7,678 primary 
THRs for osteoarthritis. Of these 911 (11.7%) were performed on patients aged 55 
or less. Age, gender, grade of lead operating surgeon, type of femoral and 
acetabular prostheses implanted, fixation method, femoral head size and bearing 
surfaces were recorded. There were 434 males and 477 females, with an age range 
of 16-55. Thirty-five femoral and 33 acetabular components were identified: 
61.7% of femoral prostheses were cemented; 67.4 % of acetabular prostheses were 
uncemented. Fifty per cent of implants had a metal/UHMWPE bearing. Other bearing 
surfaces comprised ceramic/UHMWPE 28.7%, metal/metal resurfacing 13.8% and 
ceramic/ceramic 7.5%. Consultants performed 84.5% of procedures. The study 
indicates that there does not appear to be a clear consensus as to component 
choice or optimum fixation method in the younger patient. (Hip International

This article provides a comparative analysis of the various methods of genome 
sequencing focusing on verification of the assembly quality. The results of a 
comparative assessment of various de novo assembly tools, as well as sequencing 
technologies, are presented using a recently completed sequence of the genome of 
Lactobacillus fermentum 3872. In particular, quality of assemblies is assessed 
by using CLC Genomics Workbench read mapping and Optical mapping developed by 
OpGen. Over-extension of contigs without prior knowledge of contig location can 
lead to misassembled contigs, even when commonly used quality indicators such as 
read mapping suggest that a contig is well assembled. Precautions must also be 
undertaken when using long read sequencing technology, which may also lead to 
misassembled contigs.

OBJECTIVE: Three commonly used prostate biopsy approaches are systematic 
transrectal ultrasound guided, direct in-bore MRI guided, and image fusion 
guided. The aim of this study was to calculate which strategy is most 
cost-effective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision tree and Markov model were developed to 
compare cost-effectiveness. Literature review and expert opinion were used as 
input. A strategy was deemed cost-effective if the costs of gaining one 
quality-adjusted life year (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) did not exceed 
the willingness-to-pay threshold of €80,000 (≈$85,000 in January 2017). A base 
case analysis was performed to compare systematic transrectal ultrasound- and 
image fusion-guided biopsies. Because of a lack of appropriate literature 
regarding the accuracy of direct in-bore MRI-guided biopsy, a threshold analysis 
was performed.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for fusion-guided biopsy 
compared with systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy was €1386 ($1470) 
per quality-adjusted life year gained, which was below the willingness-to-pay 
threshold and thus assumed cost-effective. If MRI findings are normal in a 
patient with clinically significant prostate cancer, the sensitivity of direct 
in-bore MRI-guided biopsy has to be at least 88.8%. If that is the case, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is €80,000 per quality-adjusted life year 
gained and thus cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: Fusion-guided biopsy seems to be cost-effective compared with 
systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. Future research is needed to 
determine whether direct in-bore MRI-guided biopsy is the best pathway; in this 
study a threshold was calculated at which it would be cost-effective.

based on the Snellen equivalent in patients with age-related macular 
degeneration.

OBJECTIVE: Economic evaluations in wet age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) 
is hampered as often utility values for solely one eye are used, mostly the 
better-seeing eye (BSE). Moreover, frequently chosen methods rely on patient 
values and/or disease specific measures, while economic evaluations prefer 
generic quality of life (QoL) measures based on societal preferences. The 
generic QoL utility instrument EQ-5D has shown to be insensitive for differences 
in visual acuity. The aim of this study was therefore to provide societal 
utility values, using the generic SF-6D, for health states acknowledging both 
BSE and worse-seeing eye (WSE).
METHODS: SF-6D utility values of 191 ARMD patients (≥65 years) with 153 
follow-up measures at 1 year were used to fill health states defined by the 
combination of BSE and WSE using Snellen equivalents; no visual loss (≥20/40), 
mild-moderate (<20/40->20/200) and severe (≤20/200).
RESULTS: QoL utilities were estimated for the SF-6D, ranging from 0.740 for ARMD 
patients without visual loss to 0.684 for patients with a combination of 
mild-moderate visual loss in their BSE and severe visual loss in their WSE.
CONCLUSION: Societal utility values are provided for ARMD patients using the 
generic QoL instrument SF-6D for visual acuity health states based on both BSE 
and WSE. The range of the values is smaller than previous elicited utilities 
with the disease-specific VisQoL. Besides, the utility values are placed on a 
more realistic position on the utility scale, and SF-6D utility values avoid the 
problem associated with the interpretation of disease-specific utility values.

Healthcare professionals' accounts of challenges in managing motor neurone 
disease in primary healthcare: a qualitative study.

Motor neurone disease (MND) is a progressive neurological disease causing muscle 
wasting, gradual paralysis and respiratory failure, with a life expectancy of 
2-4 years. In order to better understand how MND is managed in the community, we 
conducted a qualitative study to explore the challenges healthcare professionals 
encounter when managing MND in primary healthcare. Based on data from 15 
semi-structured interviews with primary healthcare professionals in Norway, we 
found that MND is viewed as a condition that requires exceptional effort and 
detailed planning. Healthcare professionals reported five main challenges in 
managing MND in primary healthcare: (i) building relationships with those giving 
and receiving care in the home; (ii) preventing caregiver burnout and breakdown; 
(iii) providing tailored care; (iv) ensuring good working conditions in 
patients' homes; and (v) recruiting and retaining qualified nursing assistants. 
Healthcare professionals reported needing working conditions that allow them to 
tailor their approach to the personal, emotional and existential nature of care 
preferences of those living with MND. However, people with MND and their 
families were sometimes perceived by healthcare professionals to prefer a 
strictly task-focused relationship with care providers. Such relationships 
limited the healthcare professionals' control over the MND trajectory and their 
capacity to prevent family caregiver burnout and breakdown. Adequate resources, 
along with training and support of nursing assistants, may increase the 
continuity of nursing assistants. Responsiveness to patient and family needs may 
enhance collaboration and promote tailored primary care and support for patients 
with MND and their families.

Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), a rare lysosomal storage disease, is an 
autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by different SMPD1 mutations. 
Historically, ASMD has been classified as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A 
(NPD A) and B (NPD B). NPD A is associated with a uniformly devastating disease 
course, with rapidly progressing psychomotor degeneration, leading to death 
typically by the age of 3 years, most often from respiratory failure. In 
contrast, the clinical phenotype and life expectancy of patients with NPD B may 
vary widely. Almost all patients have hepatosplenomegaly and an atherogenic 
lipid profile, and most patients have interstitial lung disease with progressive 
impairment of pulmonary function and hematologic abnormalities including 
cytopenias. Other common clinical manifestations include liver dysfunction,
