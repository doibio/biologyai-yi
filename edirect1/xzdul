OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to map vulnerability of Asian 
countries to the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHOD: According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007 
framework for natural hazards, vulnerability is a function of exposure, 
sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. From an extensive literature review, we 
identified 16 socioeconomic, meteorological, environmental, and health factors 
that influence coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths. The 
underlying factors of vulnerability were identified using principal component 
analysis.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that the percentage of the urban population, 
obesity rate, air connectivity, and the population aged 65 and over, diabetes 
prevalence, and PM2.5 levels all contributed significantly to COVID-19 
sensitivity. Subsequently, governance effectiveness, human development index 
(HDI), vaccination rate, and life expectancy at birth, and gross domestic 
product (GDP) all had a positive effect on adaptive capacity. The estimated 
vulnerability was corroborated by a Pearson correlation of 0.615 between death 
per million population and vulnerability.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the application of universal indicators for 
assessing pandemic vulnerability for informed policy interventions such as the 
COVAX vaccine roll-out priority. Despite data limitations and a lack of 
spatiotemporal analysis, this study's methodological framework allows for ample 
data incorporation and replication.

Can bite-force measurement play a role in dental treatment planning, clinical 
trials, and survival outcomes? A literature review and clinical recommendations.

Atlas AM, Behrooz E, Barzilay I.

Bite forc﻿e (occlusal force) may play a significant role in patient treatment 
outcomes. However, as a diagnostic risk assessment tool, it has been examined in 
the literature but is not commonly utilized by practicing clinicians and in 
academic studies. This diagnostic evaluation may assist the dental clinician in 
planning tooth- and implant-supported restorations, as damage to the tooth, 
implant, or restoration may be dependent upon a restoration's resistance to 
loading conditions. The overall bite force has been estimated to be up to 2,000 
N, with a clear sexual dimorphism and age dependence. The magnitude of these 
forces along the dental arch have been shown to be elevated in the posterior 
compared to the anterior region. The bite force magnitude has been inversely 
related to the proprioception, as a significant increase in bite force is seen 
in patients with endodontically treated teeth as compared to their vital teeth. 
Bite force has been ﻿linked to chewing efficiency, quality of life, and 
implicated in the life expectancy of the restorations. Restoration life 
expectancies have been associated with the material selection and preparation 
design parameters, both of which may be affected by masticatory bite force. 
Treatment planning criteria for preparation strategies affected by bite force 
include tooth location, material selection, occlusion pathways, and subsequent 
occlusal reduction amounts. When implants are used in patients with elevated 
magnitude of bite force, an increase in the number and diameter of the implants 
as well as occlusions with reduced occlusal tables bucc﻿olingually and lighter 
contacts may be recommended. An understanding of the magnitude and load of a 
patient's bite force can assist the dental clinician in the design of dental 
treatments along with other standard risk assessment criteria.

Redo surgical aortic valve replacement has been the gold standard for the 
treatment of degenerated bioprostheses; however it carries an inherent risk 
associated with a reoperative open heart surgery. Valve-in-Valve transcatheter 
aortic valve implantation (ViV-TAVI) has emerged as an alternative approach. Few 
articles in literature review transcatheter aortic valve replacement's failure 
rates, complications (i.e., valve dislocation, paravalvular leaks) and their 
surgical management. The rate of reoperations after a percutaneous approach is 
expected to increase, with the currently rising number of transcatheter 
procedures worldwide even in patients with a longer life expectancy. Valve 
dislocation is a rare but serious complication that can severely impact on the 
outcome of patients. Paravalvular leaks and structural valve degeneration are 
the most common causes of surgical re-intervention. We present the case of a 
complex patient with previous surgical aortic valve and ascending aorta 
replacement who underwent a transfemoral valve-in-valve TAVI for bioprosthesis 
degeneration, complicated by valve dislocation requiring surgical reoperation.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In Japan, indications for nivolumab have been expanded 
to include the combination therapy with ipilimumab in various cancers. This 
study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of combination therapy of 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab (NIV + IPI) for patients with advanced non-small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), comparing it with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in Japanese 
settings.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed to predict costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in a NIV + IPI arm and a chemotherapy arm. 
Data on overall survival and progression-free survival were derived from the 
CheckMate 227 trial. Cost estimates were based on a Japanese healthcare system 
perspective using real-world data from the JMDC claims database. Utilities were 
derived from published sources outside Japan. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of NIV + IPI therapy compared with chemotherapy was estimated. A 
scenario analysis on the level of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression 
was conducted. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the 
uncertainty in parameter settings.
RESULTS: Compared with chemotherapy, NIV + IPI therapy incurred an additional 
cost of USD102,623 and conferred an additional 1.007 QALY, which resulted in an 
ICER of USD101,950/QALY gained. Contrary to prior expectations, the ICER of 
patients with a PD-L1 expression level ≥ 1% was higher than that of patients 
with a PD-L1 expression level < 1% (USD145,868/QALY and USD127,737/QALY, 
respectively). Sensitivity analyses showed a relatively robust result with the 
ICERs remaining higher than a Japanese price adjustment threshold of 
USD75,000/QALY with a few exceptions.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of NIV + IPI as first-line therapy would not be 
cost effective under a willingness-to-pay threshold of USD75,000/QALY from the 
perspective of the Japanese healthcare system.

Impacts of Motor Developmental Delay on the Inter-Joint Coordination Using 
Kinematic Synergies of Joint Angles During Infant Crawling.

Zhang L, Deng CF, Liu Y, Chen L, Xiao N, Zhai SJ, Hou WS, Chen YX, Wu XY.

Motor developmental delay (MDD) usually affects the inter-joint coordination for 
limb movement. However, the mechanism between the abnormal inter-joint 
coordination and MDD is still unclear, which poses a challenge for clinical 
diagnosis and motor rehabilitation of MDD in infant's early life. This study 
aimed to explore whether the joint activities of limbs during infant crawling 
are represented with kinematic synergies of joint angles, and evaluate the 
impacts of MDD on the inter-joint coordination using those synergies. 20 
typically developing infants, 16 infants at risk of developmental delay, 11 
infants at high risk of developmental delay and 13 infants with confirmed 
developmental delay were recruited for self-paced crawling on hands and knees. A 
motion capture system was employed to trace infants' limbs in space, and angles 
of shoulder, elbow, hip and knee over time were computed. Kinematic synergies 
were derived from joint angles using principal component analysis. Sample 
entropy and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated among those 
synergies to evaluate the crawling complexity and the symmetry of bilateral 
limbs, respectively. We found that the first two synergies with different 
contributions to the crawling movements sufficiently represented the joint 
angular profiles of limbs. MDD further delayed the development of motor function 
for lower limbs and mainly increased the crawling complexity of joint 
flexion/extension to some extent, but did not obviously change the symmetry of 
bilateral limbs. These results suggest that the time-varying kinematic synergy 
of joint angles is a potential index for objectively evaluating the abnormal 
inter-joint coordination affected by MDD.

PURPOSE: Patients with human papillomavirus oropharyngeal cancer are highly 
curable but risk significant long-term toxic effects with standard therapy. This 
study investigated a de-escalation strategy of decreased adjuvant radiation 
therapy and chemotherapy after transoral robotic surgery, and reports on 
long-term functional and quality of life (QOL) outcomes.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients had a p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer 
and ≤10 pack-year smoking history and underwent surgery followed by treatment 
with either 30 Gy delivered in 1.5-Gy fractions twice per day over 2 weeks with 
weekly docetaxel (15 mg/m2) if they had intermediate pathologic risk factors or 
36 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions twice per day over 2 weeks with the same chemotherapy 
if they had extranodal extension. Toxic effects, swallow function, and QOL were 
measured longitudinally.
RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients (89.9% male) were treated and eligible for toxic 
effect and functional evaluation. Dry mouth was the most common grade 1 toxic 
effect at 1 year (55.6%), 2 years (53.3%), and 3 years (49.2%). The cumulative 
rates of grade 2 toxic effects at 1, 2, and 3 years were 1.4%, 6.7%, and 6.8%, 
respectively. There were only 2 grade 3 toxic effects at ≥1 year, including a 
grade 3 fatigue at 2.5 years, and a grade 3 superficial soft tissue fibrosis at 
4 years. There were no grade 4 to 5 toxic effects. No patients were percutaneous 
endoscopic gastrostomy-dependent. Swallow function improved by 12 months 
posttreatment. QOL improved over time by all measurement tools and most patients 
returned to baseline level of function and QOL.
CONCLUSIONS: De-escalated adjuvant therapy for select patients with human 
papillomavirus oropharyngeal cancer resulted in low rates of long-term toxic 
effects, excellent swallow outcomes, and preservation of global and 
xerostomia-related QOL.

It is crucial to economically justify the use of promising therapies such as 
stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for oligometastatic disease (OMD). The 
goal of this systematic review was to provide a summative evaluation of 
publications that analyzed the cost-effectiveness (CE) of SABR for OMD. Using 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA)-guided methodology, PubMed and Embase were searched for modeling-based 
CE studies for various forms of limited metastatic disease. Only full 
publications that specifically compared SABR with a systemic therapy-based 
approach were included. In total, 9 studies met inclusion criteria; 4 pertained 
to OMD with mixed histologies, 2 to oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer, 
1 to pulmonary OMD, 1 to liver OMD, and 1 to low-volume oligorecurrent 
castration-sensitive prostate cancer. All but 1 investigation illustrated that 
SABR was cost-effective for the studied population (or a subpopulation); of 
these studies, the incremental CE ratios for SABR (when reported) ranged from 
$28,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) to $55,000/QALY. Of studies that 
reported the probability of SABR being cost-effective at common 
willingness-to-pay values, the median (range) probability of achieving CE was 
roughly 61% (30%-88%) at a $50,000/QALY threshold and 78% (31%-100%) at a 
$100,000/QALY threshold. Taken together, the available evidence suggests that 
SABR appears to be a cost-effective approach for OMD, which has implications for 
value-based oncologic practice and construction of future health policies. 
However, reassessment is required in the context of modern systemic therapies 
(eg, immunotherapy) as well as long-term follow-up of existing and newly 
reported randomized trials. Prudent patient selection remains the single most 
important factor influencing the CE of SABR for OMD.

In Japan, medical care for patients with muscular dystrophy has improved through 
multidisciplinary care provided by specialized institutions, resulting in a 
marked increase in life expectancy. Today, most patients with muscular dystrophy 
live in their own homes and receive medical care in various non-specialized 
institutions. Some muscular dystrophy patients have associated central nervous 
system disorders, which include neurodevelopmental syndromes. In addition, many 
patients are physically and mentally unstable during adolescence, when the 
transition from pediatric neurology to adult neurology occurs. Early 
opportunities to consult specialized institutions for rehabilitation or specific 
periods when pediatric and adult neurologists take care of patients together 
should be considered to facilitate this transition more easily.

BACKGROUND: Water pollution due to uncontrolled release of chemical pollutants 
is an important global problem. Its effect on medically important insects, 
especially mosquitoes, is a critical issue in the epidemiology of mosquito-borne 
diseases.
METHODS: In order to understand the effect of water pollutants on the demography 
of Anopheles stephensi, colonies were reared in clean, moderately and highly 
polluted water for three consecutive generations at 27 °C, 75% RH, and a 
photoperiod of 12:12 h (L:D). The demographic data of the 4th generation of An. 
stephensi were collected and analysed using the age-stage, two-sex life table.
RESULTS: The intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (λ), mean 
fecundity (F) and net reproductive rate (R0) of An. stephensi in clean water 
were 0.2568 d-1, 1.2927 d-1, 251.72 eggs, and 109.08 offspring, respectively. 
These values were significantly higher than those obtained in moderately 
polluted water (r = 0.2302 d-1, λ = 1.2589 d-1, 196.04 eggs, and R0 = 65.35 
offspring) and highly polluted water (r = 0.2282 d-1, λ = 1.2564 d-1, 182.45 
eggs, and R0 = 62.03 offspring). Female adult longevity in moderately polluted 
(9.38 days) and highly polluted water (9.88 days) were significantly shorter 
than those reared in clean water (12.43 days), while no significant difference 
in the male adult longevity was observed among treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that An. stephensi can partially 
adapt to water pollution and this may be sufficient to extend the range of 
mosquito-borne diseases.

BACKGROUND: Healthcare system and intersectoral public health policies play a 
crucial role in improving population health and reducing health inequalities. 
This study aimed to quantify their impact, operationalized as avoidable deaths, 
on the gap in life expectancy (LE) and lifespan inequality (LI) between Iran and 
three neighbour countries viz., Turkey, Qatar, and Kuwait in 2015-2016.
METHODS: Annual data on population and causes of deaths by age and sex for Iran 
and three neighbour countries were obtained from the World Health Organization 
mortality database for the period 2015-2016. A recently developed list by the 
OECD/Eurostat was used to identify avoidable causes of death (with an upper age 
limit of 75). The cross-country gaps in LE and LI (measured by standard 
deviation) were decomposed by age and cause of death using a continuous-change 
model.
RESULTS: Iranian males and females had the second lowest and lowest LE, 
respectively, compared with their counterparts in the neighbour countries. On 
the other hand, the highest LIs in both sexes (by 2.3 to 4.5 years in males and 
1.1 to 3.3 years in females) were observed in Iran. Avoidable causes contributed 
substantially to the LE and LI gap in both sexes with injuries and 
maternal/infant mortality represented the greatest contributions to the 
disadvantages in Iranian males and females, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher mortality rates in young Iranians led to a double burden of 
inequality -shorter LE and greater uncertainty at timing of death. Strengthening 
intersectoral public health policies and healthcare quality targeted at averting 
premature deaths, especially from injuries among younger people, can mitigate 
this double burden.

Update in
    Demography. 2023 Feb 16;:

The COVID-19 pandemic has had overwhelming global impacts with deleterious 
social, economic, and health consequences. To assess the COVID-19 death toll 
researchers have estimated declines in 2020 life expectancy at birth. Because 
data are often available only for COVID-19 deaths, the risks of dying from 
COVID-19 are assumed to be independent of those from other causes. We explore 
the soundness of this assumption based on data from the US and Brazil, the 
countries with the largest number of reported COVID-19 deaths. We use three 
methods. One estimates the difference between 2019 and 2020 life tables and 
therefore does not require the assumption of independence. The other two assume 
independence to simulate scenarios in which COVID-19 mortality is added to 2019 
death rates or is eliminated from 2020 rates. Our results reveal that COVID-19 
is not independent of other causes of death. The assumption of independence can 
lead to either an overestimate (Brazil) or an underestimate (US) of the decline 
in e 0 , depending on how the number of other reported causes of death changed 
in 2020.

Several studies have assessed the effects of intermittent hypoxia-normoxia 
training (IHNT), intermittent hypoxia-hyperoxia training (IHHT), and obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA) on aging and age-related diseases in humans; however, the 
results remain contradictory. Therefore, this review aims to systematically 
summarize the available studies on the effects of IHNT, IHHT, and OSA on aging 
and age-related diseases. Relevant studies were searched from PubMed, Google 
Scholar, Cochrane Library databases, and through manual searching from reference 
lists of eligible studies. A total of 38 eligible studies were included in this 
systematic review. IHHT and IHNT provide positive effects on several age-related 
parameters including quality of life, cognitive and physical functions, plasma 
level of glucose and cholesterol/LDL, systolic blood pressure, red blood cells, 
and inflammation. Moreover, moderate intermittent hypoxia induces telomerase 
reverse transcriptase (TERT) activity and telomere stabilization, delays 
induction of senescence-associated markers expression and senescence-associated 
β-galactosidase, upregulates pluripotent marker (Oct4), activates a metabolic 
shift, and raises resistance to pro-apoptotic stimuli. On the contrary, 
intermittent hypoxia in OSA causes hypertension, metabolic syndrome, vascular 
function impairment, quality of life and cognitive scores reduction, advanced 
brain aging, increase in insulin resistance, plasma hydrogen peroxide, GSH, 
IL-6, hsCRP, leptin, and leukocyte telomere shortening. Thus, it can be 
speculated that the main factor that determines the direction of the 
intermittent hypoxia action is the intensity and duration of exposure. There is 
no direct study to prove that IHNT/IHHT actually increases life expectancy in 
humans. Therefore, further study is needed to investigate the actual effect of 
IHNT/IHHT on aging in humans.

Inflammatory diseases have a high prevalence and has become of great interest 
due to the increase in life expectancy and the costs to the health care system 
worldwide. Chronic diseases require long-term treatment frequently using 
corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are associated 
with diverse side effects and risk of toxicity. Betulinic acid, a lupane-type 
pentacyclic triterpene, is a potential lead compound for the development of new 
anti-inflammatory treatments, and a large number of derivatives have been 
produced and tested. The potential of betulinic acid and its derivatives has 
been shown in a number of pre-clinical studies using different experimental 
models. Moreover, several molecular mechanisms of action have also been 
described. Here we reviewed the potential use of betulinic acid as a promissory 
lead compound with anti-inflammatory activity and the perspectives for its use 
in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.

Obesity is a significant global health concern since it is connected to a higher 
risk of several chronic diseases. As a consequence, obesity may be described as 
a condition that reduces human life expectancy and significantly impacts life 
quality. Because traditional obesity diagnosis procedures have several flaws, it 
is vital to design new diagnostic models to enhance current methods. More 
obesity-related markers have been discovered in recent years as a result of 
improvements and enhancements in gene sequencing technology. Using current gene 
expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) collection, we 
identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with obesity and 
found 12 important genes (CRLS1, ANG, ALPK3, ADSSL1, ABCC1, HLF, AZGP1, TSC22D3, 
F2R, FXN, PEMT, and SPTAN1) using a random forest classifier. ALPK3, HLF, FXN, 
and SPTAN1 are the only genes that have never been linked to obesity. We also 
used an artificial neural network to build a novel obesity diagnosis model and 
tested its diagnostic effectiveness using public datasets.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy is leading to a worldwide increase 
in chronic diseases and disability, with significant concern about their 
management and long-term care. Investigating the aging process using a 
bio-psychosocial perspective is essential to understanding how to reduce 
disability and improve the quality of life of aging people. This study aims to 
explore the role of social networks and built environment as predictors of 
disability and quality of life in the Italian population aged over 50 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research protocol is composed of several tools: World 
Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0), World Health 
Organization Quality of Life Assessment in Aging (WHOQOL-AGE), Social Network 
Index (SNI), the Courage Built Environment Self-Reported Questionnaire (CBE-SR), 
and collection of sociodemographic information and information on health system 
coverage.
RESULTS: A total of 431 people were administered the protocol, and among them, 
209 were males and 222 were females, with a mean age of 70 years. The majority 
of the sample reported earning a middle or high school diploma, and 60.6% of the 
sample declared to have a good health status. The results showed that people 
with a good social support network have higher levels of functioning and quality 
of life. However, the built environment did not significantly predict either 
disability or quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: These results could provide elements for dialogue with institutions 
and policymakers. This is fundamental to develop active policies aimed at the 
implementation of services and systems to promote healthy aging process.

Neuropsychological Assessment in Dementia Diagnosis.

Weintraub S.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article discusses the application of neuropsychological 
evaluation to the workup of individuals with age-related cognitive impairment 
and suspected dementia. Referral questions, principles of evaluation, and common 
instruments to detect abnormalities in cognition and behavior in this population 
are reviewed. The integration of neuropsychological test findings with other 
clinical and biomarker information enhances early detection, differential 
diagnosis, and care planning.
RECENT FINDINGS: Life expectancy is increasing in the United States, and, 
accordingly, the prevalence and incidence of dementia associated with 
age-related neurodegenerative brain disease are rising. Age is the greatest risk 
factor for the dementia associated with Alzheimer disease, the most common 
neurodegenerative cause of dementia in people over 65 years of age; other 
etiologies, such as the class of frontotemporal lobar degenerations, are 
increasingly recognized in individuals both younger and older than 65 years of 
age. The clinical dementia diagnosis, unfortunately, is imperfectly related to 
disease etiology; however, probabilistic relationships can aid in diagnosis. 
Further, mounting evidence from postmortem brain autopsies points to multiple 
etiologies. The case examples in this article illustrate how the 
neuropsychological evaluation increases diagnostic accuracy and, most important, 
identifies salient cognitive and behavioral symptoms to target for 
nonpharmacologic intervention and caregiver education and support. Sharing the 
diagnosis with affected individuals is also discussed with reference to 
prognosis and severity of illness.
SUMMARY: The clinical neuropsychological examination facilitates early detection 
of dementia, characterizes the level of severity, defines salient clinical 
features, aids in differential diagnosis, and points to a pathway for care 
planning and disease education.

Health Disparities in Dementia.

Balls-Berry JJE, Babulal GM.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Causes of health disparities in Alzheimer disease and related 
dementias (ADRD) in the United States are multifactorial. This article 
contextualizes health disparities as they relate to the neurodegenerative 
processes of ADRD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Older adults' life expectancy has increased such that a 
65-year-old is expected to live 19 or more years and an 85-year-old can expect 
to live, on average, 6 to 7 years longer. Individuals of certain ethnoracial 
groups (Black, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native 
Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) may be at a higher risk of incident ADRD compared to 
non-Hispanic/Latino White people. These differences in a higher risk of ADRD 
across ethnoracial groups persist despite no statistically significant 
differences in the rate of cognitive decline over time. The intersectionality of 
social determinants of health, experiences with discrimination and oppression, 
and access to care are related to the issue of justice and the risk for and 
expression of ADRD. The theoretical frameworks of various health disparities 
provide organized approaches to tracking the progression of health disparities 
for diverse patients.
SUMMARY: ADRD health disparities are complex. Neurologists and their care teams 
must consider the main reasons for clinical ADRD evaluations of members of 
ethnoracial groups and the factors that may impact patient adherence and 
compliance with diagnostic and management recommendations.

Resurrecting the 'fourth 90': towards a definition of health-related quality of 
life in HIV care.

Medical advancements in the treatment of HIV continue to return ever more 
impressive medical results; increasing life expectancy and reducing negative 
symptoms (either disease-related or medically-induced). Physical wellness, 
however, is only one of the many facets of human life. It has been 5 years since 
Lazarus et al proposed we should be looking towards a fourth 90-good 
health-related quality of life (QoL)-yet little has been done to take up this 
task within a coherent approach. We suggest that one of the barriers to this is 
a lack of definition about what we mean by 'good health-related quality of life' 
(HRQoL) for people living with HIV. This article considers existing definitions 
of this, and related terms, and the difficulties in finding a universal 
definition. It goes on to suggest a way to a conceptual HRQoL in people living 
with HIV based on the biopsychosocial model. It is proposed that by doing it 
this way, practitioners can assess HRQoL in a comprehensive way, and focus on 
the things that matter to the individual.

BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a major driver of 
technological development in the 21st century, yet little attention has been 
paid to algorithmic biases toward older adults.
OBJECTIVE: This paper documents the search strategy and process for a scoping 
review exploring how age-related bias is encoded or amplified in AI systems as 
well as the corresponding legal and ethical implications.
METHODS: The scoping review follows a 6-stage methodology framework developed by 
Arksey and O'Malley. The search strategy has been established in 6 databases. We 
will investigate the legal implications of ageism in AI by searching grey 
literature databases, targeted websites, and popular search engines and using an 
iterative search strategy. Studies meet the inclusion criteria if they are in 
English, peer-reviewed, available electronically in full text, and meet one of 
the following two additional criteria: (1) include "bias" related to AI in any 
application (eg, facial recognition) and (2) discuss bias related to the concept 
of old age or ageism. At least two reviewers will independently conduct the 
title, abstract, and full-text screening. Search results will be reported using 
the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) reporting guideline. We will chart 
data on a structured form and conduct a thematic analysis to highlight the 
societal, legal, and ethical implications reported in the literature.
RESULTS: The database searches resulted in 7595 records when the searches were 
piloted in November 2021. The scoping review will be completed by December 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings will provide interdisciplinary insights into the 
extent of age-related bias in AI systems. The results will contribute 
foundational knowledge that can encourage multisectoral cooperation to ensure 
that AI is developed and deployed in a manner consistent with ethical values and 
human rights legislation as it relates to an older and aging population. We will 
publish the review findings in peer-reviewed journals and disseminate the key 
results with stakeholders via workshops and webinars.

BACKGROUND: The gap between the average life expectancy and healthy life 
expectancy remains wide. Understanding the natural history of frailty 
development is necessary to prevent and treat frailty to overcome this gap. This 
study elucidated the trajectories of 5 frailty assessment components using 
group-based multitrajectory modeling.
METHODS: Overall, 845 community-dwelling older adults (aged 65-91 years; 433 
males and 412 females) who underwent longitudinal frailty assessments at least 3 
times were included in the analysis. The mean follow-up period (±SD, range) was 
7.1 (±2.3, 3.8-11.3) years. In each wave, the physical frailty was assessed for 
the following 5 partially modified components of the Cardiovascular Health Study 
criteria: shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, slowness, and low activity. Using 
group-based multitrajectory modeling, we identified subgroups that followed 
distinctive trajectories regarding the 5 frailty components.
RESULTS: Five frailty trajectory groups were identified: weakness-focused frail 
progression group (Group 1 [G1]; 10.9%), robust maintenance group (Group 2 [G2]; 
43.7%), exhaustion-focused prefrail group (Group 3 [G3]; 24.3%), frail 
progression group (Group 4 [G4]; 6.7%), and low activity-focused prefrail group 
(Group 5 [G5]; 14.4%). The Cox proportional hazards model analysis showed that 
G1, G4, and G5 had significantly higher mortality risks after adjusting for sex 
and age (G2 was the reference group).
CONCLUSION: Based on the natural history of frailty, the 5 distinctive 
trajectory groups showed that some individuals remained robust, while others 
remained predominantly prefrail or progressed primarily owing to physical 
mobility decline. Therefore, identifying individuals belonging to these 
progressive frailty groups and providing interventions according to the 
characteristics of each group may be beneficial.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the commonest cancer in the 
United Kingdom and United States. Surgical excision is the most common 
treatment. This review summarises all published outcomes of 
observational/non-interventional management of cutaneous BCC.
METHODS: This PRISMA-compliant systematic review searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and 
CENTRAL databases from inception-June 2021. All studies reporting outcomes of 
observational management for BCC were included.
RESULTS: We identified 2529 titles, from which 4 full-text articles were 
eligible, reporting on 2298 individuals. Two studies were randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs) comparing histological clearance rates and adverse events 
following treatment with an inactive strategy (placebo cream) versus topical 
5%-imiquimod (at different frequencies) for 6-12 weeks. Clearance rates ranged 
from 52-100% for imiquimod and 2-19% for placebo, with more adverse events 
associated with imiquimod. The other two studies used prospective cohort 
designs. One study assessed the natural history of BCCs managed expectantly in 
39 individuals aged ≥80years. During the 15.8-month follow-up, 46.2% of lesions 
did not increase in size and 10.3% resolved. The remaining study compared 
treatment patterns of 1360 patients with non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in 
individuals with or without limited life-expectancy (LLE). The LLE subgroup had 
a 5-year mortality rate of 43.3%, with no deaths attributed to NMSC. Only 3.3% 
of individuals with LLE underwent observational treatment. No study examined 
quality-of-life or cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: There has been limited investigation of observational management of
