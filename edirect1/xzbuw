of the clinicians alone. However, studies focusing on pain frequency in such 
disorders suggest a high prevalence of pain in selected populations from 38 to 
75% in AD, 40% to 86% in PD, and 19 to 85% in MND. The methods of pain 
assessment vary between studies so the type of pain has been rarely reported. 
However, a prevalent nonneuropathic origin of pain emerged for MND and PD. In 
AD, no data on pain features are available. No controlled therapeutic trials and 
guidelines are currently available. Given the relevance of pain in 
neurodegenerative disorders, the comprehensive understanding of mechanisms and 
predisposing factors, the application and validation of specific scales, and new 
specific therapeutic trials are needed.

The present study reports the clinical data of two patients with renal pelvis 
carcinoma and one patient with renal carcinoma who developed port-site 
metastasis following retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery. The current study 
aimed to identify the cause and prognosis of the occurrence of port-site 
metastasis subsequent to laparoscopic radical resection of renal pelvis 
carcinoma and nephron-sparing surgery. Post-operative pathology confirmed the 
presence of high-grade urothelial cell carcinoma in two patients and Fuhrman 
grade 3 renal clear cell carcinoma in one patient. Port-site metastasis was 
initially detected 1-7 months post-surgery. The two patients with renal pelvis 
carcinoma succumbed to the disease 2 and 4 months following the identification 
of the port-site metastasis, respectively, whereas the patient with renal 
carcinoma survived with no disease progression during the targeted therapy 
period. The occurrence of port-site metastasis may be attributed to systemic and 
local factors. Measures to reduce the development of this complication include 
strict compliance with the operating guidelines for tumor surgery, avoidance of 
air leakage at the port-site, complete removal of the specimen with an 
impermeable bag, irrigation of the laparoscopic instruments and incisional wound 
with povidone-iodine when necessary, and enhancement of the body's immunity. 
Close post-operative follow-up observation for signs of recurrence or metastasis 
is essential, and systemic chemotherapy may be required in patients with 
high-grade renal pelvis carcinoma and renal carcinoma in order to prolong life 
expectancy.

RhoBTB proteins constitute a subfamily of atypical Rho GTPases represented in 
mammals by RhoBTB1, RhoBTB2, and RhoBTB3. Their characteristic feature is a 
carboxyl terminal extension that harbors two BTB domains capable of assembling 
cullin 3-dependent ubiquitin ligase complexes. The expression of all three 
RHOBTB genes has been found reduced or abolished in a variety of tumors. They 
are considered tumor suppressor genes and recent studies have strengthened their 
implication in tumorigenesis through regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. 
RhoBTB3 is also involved in retrograde transport from endosomes to the Golgi 
apparatus. One aspect that makes RhoBTB proteins atypical among the Rho GTPases 
is their proposed mechanism of activation. No specific guanine nucleotide 
exchange factors or GTPase activating proteins are known. Instead, RhoBTB might 
be activated through interaction with other proteins that relieve their 
auto-inhibited conformation and inactivated through auto-ubiquitination and 
destruction in the proteasome. In this review we discuss our current knowledge 
on the molecular mechanisms of action of RhoBTB proteins and the implications 
for tumorigenesis and other pathologic conditions.

INTRODUCTION: Active surveillance pharmacovigilance is a systematic approach to 
medicine safety assessment and health systems strengthening, but has not been 
widely implemented in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to 
assess the cost effectiveness of a national active surveillance 
pharmacovigilance system for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) 
compared with the existing spontaneous reporting system in Namibia.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis from a governmental perspective compared active 
surveillance pharmacovigilance to spontaneous reporting. Data from a sentinel 
site active surveillance program in Namibia from August 2012 to April 2013 was 
projected to all HIV-infected adults initiating HAART in Namibia. Costs 
(pharmacovigilance program, HAART, adverse event [AE] treatment), 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs, dollars/QALY) were evaluated. Analysis was completed for (i) cohort 
analysis: a single cohort beginning HAART in 1 year in Namibia followed over 
their remaining lifetime, and (ii) population analysis: patients continued to 
enter and leave care and treatment over 10 years.
RESULTS: For the cohort analysis, totals were US$21,267,902 (2015 US dollars) 
and 116,224 QALYs for care and treatment under active surveillance 
pharmacovigilance versus US$15,257,381 and 116,122 QALYs for care and treatment 
under spontaneous reporting pharmacovigilance, resulting in an ICER of 
US$58,867/QALY for active surveillance compared with spontaneous reporting 
pharmacovigilance. The population analysis ICER was US$4989/QALY. Results were 
sensitive to quality of life associated with AEs.
CONCLUSION: Active surveillance pharmacovigilance was projected to be highly 
cost effective to improve treatment for HIV in Namibia. Active surveillance 
pharmacovigilance may be valuable to improve lives of HIV patients and more 
efficiently allocate health resources in Namibia.

    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013;(11):CD005599.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective gene encoding a protein 
called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and is 
characterised by chronic lung infection resulting in inflammation and 
progressive lung damage that results in a reduced life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether topical CFTR gene replacement therapy to the 
lungs in people with cystic fibrosis is associated with improvements in clinical 
outcomes, and to assess any adverse effects.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders 
Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive 
electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books 
of conference proceedings.Date of most recent search: 05 May 2016.An additional 
search of the National Institutes for Health (NIH) Genetic Modification Clinical 
Research Information System (GeMCRIS) was also performed for the years 1992 to 
2015.Date of most recent search: 20 April 2016.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled studies comparing topical CFTR gene 
delivery to the lung, using either viral or non-viral delivery systems, with 
placebo or an alternative delivery system in people with confirmed cystic 
fibrosis.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors independently extracted data and 
assessed study quality. Authors of included studies were contacted and asked for 
any available additional data. Meta-analysis was limited due to differing study 
designs.
MAIN RESULTS: Four randomised controlled studies met the inclusion criteria for 
this review, involving a total of 302 participants lasting from 29 days to 13 
months; 14 studies were excluded. The included studies differed in terms of CFTR 
gene replacement agent and study design, which limited the meta-analysis. One 
study only enrolled adult males, the remaining studies included both males and 
females aged 12 years and over.Risk of bias in the studies was moderate. Random 
sequence generation and allocation concealment was only described in the more 
recent study; the remaining three studies were judged to have an unclear risk of 
bias. All four studies documented double-blinding to the intervention, but there 
is some uncertainty with regards to participant blinding in one study. Some 
outcome data were missing from all four studies.There were no differences in 
either the number of respiratory exacerbations or the number of participants 
with an exacerbation between replacement therapy or placebo groups at any time 
point. Meta-analysis of most respiratory function tests showed no difference 
between treatment and placebo groups, but the smallest study (n = 16) reported 
forced vital capacity (litres) increased more in the placebo group at up to 24 
hours. A further study reported a significant improvement in forced expiratory 
volume at one second (litres) at 30 days after participants had received their 
first dose of favouring the gene therapy agent, but this finding was not 
confirmed when combined with at second study in the meta-analysis. The more 
recent study (n = 140) demonstrated a small improvement in forced vital capacity 
(per cent predicted) at two and three months and again at 11 and 12 months for 
participants receiving CFTR gene replacement therapy compared to those receiving 
placebo. The same study reported a significant difference in the relative change 
in forced expiratory volume at one second (per cent predicted) at two months, 
three months and 12 months.One small study reported significant concerns with 
"influenza-like" symptoms in participants treated with CFTR gene replacement 
therapy; this was not reported on repeated use of the same agent in a larger 
recent study.There was no other evidence of positive impact on outcomes, in 
particular improved quality of life or reduced treatment burden.Two studies 
measured ion transport in the lower airways; one (n = 16) demonstrated 
significant changes toward normal values in the participants who received gene 
transfer agents (P < 0.0001), mean difference 6.86 (95% confidence interval 3.77 
to 9.95). The second study (n = 140) also reported significant changes toward 
normal values (P = 0.032); however, aggregate data were not available for 
analysis. In the most recent study, there was also evidence of increased salt 
transport in cells obtained by brushing the lower airway. These outcomes, whilst 
important, are not of direct clinical relevance.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: One study of liposome-based CFTR gene transfer therapy 
demonstrated some improvements in respiratory function in people with CF, but 
this limited evidence of efficacy does not support this treatment as a routine 
therapy at present. There was no evidence of efficacy for viral-mediated gene 
delivery.Future studies need to investigate clinically important outcome 
measures.

[The Antonine plague: A global pestilence in the II century d.C].

[Article in Spanish]

Sáez A.

The Antonine plague was the first plague affecting globally the Western world. 
It affected all aspects of life of mankind in the Roman Empire: economics, 
politics, religion and the culture. The especialists set the mortality rate in 
the 10% of the population. On the other hand the existence of unified Roman 
Empire from culturally and territorially helped to spreading the plague as it 
could similarly occur in our society in a similar pandemic. In conclusion, it is 
argued that the epidemic was global in a sense of the geographical extension and 
the effects this had on the population.

We generated an anti-albumin antibody, CA645, to link its Fv domain to an 
antigen-binding fragment (Fab), thereby extending the serum half-life of the 
Fab. CA645 was demonstrated to bind human, cynomolgus, and mouse serum albumin 
with similar affinity (1-7 nM), and to bind human serum albumin (HSA) when it is 
in complex with common known ligands. Importantly for half-life extension, CA645 
binds HSA with similar affinity within the physiologically relevant range of pH 
5.0 - pH 7.4, and does not have a deleterious effect on the binding of HSA to 
neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). A crystal structure of humanized CA645 Fab in 
complex with HSA was solved and showed that CA645 Fab binds to domain II of HSA. 
Superimposition with the crystal structure of FcRn bound to HSA confirmed that 
CA645 does not block HSA binding to FcRn. In mice, the serum half-life of 
humanized CA645 Fab is 84.2 h. This is a significant extension in comparison 
with < 1 h for a non-HSA binding CA645 Fab variant. The Fab-HSA structure was 
used to design a series of mutants with reduced affinity to investigate the 
correlation between the affinity for albumin and serum half-life. Reduction in 
the affinity for MSA by 144-fold from 2.2 nM to 316 nM had no effect on serum 
half-life. Strikingly, despite a reduction in affinity to 62 µM, an extension in 
serum half-life of 26.4 h was still obtained. CA645 Fab and the CA645 Fab-HSA 
complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession codes, 
5FUZ and 5FUO, respectively.

OBJECTIVES: To identify parameters that drive the cost-effectiveness of 
precision medicine by comparing the use of multiplex targeted sequencing (MTS) 
to select targeted therapy based on tumour genomic profiles to either no further 
testing with chemotherapy or no further testing with best supportive care in the 
fourth-line treatment of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: A combined decision tree and Markov model to compare costs, life-years, 
and quality-adjusted life-years over a ten-year time horizon from an Australian 
healthcare payer perspective. Data sources included the published literature and 
a population-based molecular cohort study (Cancer 2015). Uncertainty was 
assessed using deterministic sensitivity analyses and quantified by estimating 
expected value of perfect/partial perfect information. Uncertainty due to 
technological/scientific advancement was assessed through a number of plausible 
future scenario analyses.
RESULTS: Point estimate incremental cost-effective ratios indicate that MTS is 
not cost-effective for selecting fourth-line treatment of metastatic lung 
adenocarcinoma. Lower mortality rates during testing and for true positive 
patients, lower health state utility values for progressive disease, and 
targeted therapy resulting in reductions in inpatient visits, however, all 
resulted in more favourable cost-effectiveness estimates for MTS. The expected 
value to decision makers of removing all current decision uncertainty was 
estimated to be between AUD 5,962,843 and AUD 13,196,451, indicating that 
additional research to reduce uncertainty may be a worthwhile investment. 
Plausible future scenarios analyses revealed limited improvements in 
cost-effectiveness under scenarios of improved test performance, decreased costs 
of testing/interpretation, and no biopsy costs/adverse events. Reductions in 
off-label targeted therapy costs, when considered together with the other 
scenarios did, however, indicate more favourable cost-effectiveness of MTS.
CONCLUSION: As more clinical evidence is generated for MTS, the model developed 
should be revisited and cost-effectiveness re-estimated under different testing 
scenarios to further understand the value of precision medicine and its 
potential impact on the overall health budget.

BACKGROUND: The recent joint International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and 
Outcomes Research / Society for Medical Decision Making Modeling Good Research 
Practices Task Force emphasized the importance of conceptualizing and validating 
models. We report a new model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
(part of the Galaxy project) founded on a conceptual model, implemented using a 
novel linked-equation approach, and internally validated.
METHODS: An expert panel developed a conceptual model including causal 
relationships between disease attributes, progression, and final outcomes. Risk 
equations describing these relationships were estimated using data from the 
Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints 
(ECLIPSE) study, with costs estimated from the TOwards a Revolution in COPD 
Health (TORCH) study. Implementation as a linked-equation model enabled direct 
estimation of health service costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for 
COPD patients over their lifetimes. Internal validation compared 3 years of 
predicted cohort experience with ECLIPSE results.
RESULTS: At 3 years, the Galaxy COPD model predictions of annual exacerbation 
rate and annual decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second fell within the 
ECLIPSE data confidence limits, although 3-year overall survival was outside the 
observed confidence limits. Projections of the risk equations over time 
permitted extrapolation to patient lifetimes. Averaging the predicted cost/QALY 
outcomes for the different patients within the ECLIPSE cohort gives an estimated 
lifetime cost of £25,214 (undiscounted)/£20,318 (discounted) and lifetime QALYs 
of 6.45 (undiscounted/5.24 [discounted]) per ECLIPSE patient.
CONCLUSIONS: A new form of model for COPD was conceptualized, implemented, and 
internally validated, based on a series of linked equations using 
epidemiological data (ECLIPSE) and cost data (TORCH). This Galaxy model predicts 
COPD outcomes from treatment effects on disease attributes such as lung 
function, exacerbations, symptoms, or exercise capacity; further external 
validation is required.

Why Do Health Economists Promote Technology Adoption Rather Than the Search for 
Efficiency? A Proposal for a Change in Our Approach to Economic Evaluation in

At a time of intense pressure on health care budgets, the technology management 
challenge is for disinvestment in low-value technologies and reinvestment in 
higher value alternatives. The aim of this article is to explore ways in which 
health economists might begin to redress the observed imbalance between the 
evaluation of new and existing in-use technologies. The argument is not against 
evaluating new technologies but in favor of the "search for efficiency," where 
the ultimate objective is to identify reallocations that improve population 
health in the face of resource scarcity. We explore why in-use technologies may 
be of low value and consider how economic evaluation analysts might embrace a 
broader efficiency lens, first through "technology management" (a process of 
analysis and evidence-informed decision making throughout a technology's life 
cycle) and progressing through "pathway management" (the search for efficiency 
gains across entire clinical care pathways). A number of model-based examples 
are used to illustrate the approaches.

BACKGROUND: Since 2006, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 
recommended hepatitis A (HepA) vaccination routinely for children aged 
12-23months to prevent hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. However, a substantial 
proportion of US children are unvaccinated and susceptible to infection. We 
present results of economic modeling to assess whether a one-time catch-up HepA 
vaccination recommendation would be cost-effective.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model of HAV infection that followed a single 
cohort from birth through death (birth to age 95years). The model compared the 
health and economic outcomes from catch-up vaccination interventions for 
children at target ages from two through 17years vs. outcomes resulting from 
maintaining the current recommendation of routine vaccination at age one year 
with no catch-up intervention.
RESULTS: Over the lifetime of the cohort, catch-up vaccination would reduce the 
total number of infections relative to the baseline by 741 while increasing 
doses of vaccine by 556,989. Catch-up vaccination would increase net costs by 
$10.2million, or $2.38 per person. The incremental cost of HepA vaccine catch-up 
intervention at age 10years, the midpoint of the ages modeled, was $452,239 per 
QALY gained. Across age-cohorts, the cost-effectiveness of catch-up vaccination 
is most favorable at age 12years, resulting in an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness 
Ratio of $189,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the low baseline of HAV disease incidence achieved by current 
vaccination recommendations, our economic model suggests that a catch-up 
vaccination recommendation would be less cost-effective than many other vaccine 
interventions, and that HepA catch-up vaccination would become cost effective at

The term "patient centered," "patient centric," or "patient centricity" is 
increasingly used in the scientific literature in a wide variety of contexts. 
Generally, patient centric medicines are recognized as an essential contributor 
to healthy aging and the overall patient's quality of life and life expectancy. 
Besides the selection of the appropriate type of drug substance and strength for 
a particular indication in a particular patient, due attention must be paid that 
the pharmaceutical drug product design is also adequately addressing the 
particular patient's needs, i.e., assuring adequate patient adherence and the 
anticipate drug safety and effectiveness. Relevant pharmaceutical design aspects 
may e.g., involve the selection of the route of administration, the tablet size 
and shape, the ease of opening the package, the ability to read the user 
instruction, or the ability to follow the recommended (in-use) storage 
conditions. Currently, a harmonized definition on patient centric drug 
development/design has not yet been established. To stimulate scientific 
research and discussions and the consistent interpretation of test results, it 
is essential that such a definition is established. We have developed a first 
draft definition through various rounds of discussions within an 
interdisciplinary AAPS focus group of experts. This publication summarizes the 
outcomes and is intended to stimulate further discussions with all stakeholders 
towards a common definition of patient centric pharmaceutical drug product 
design that is useable across all disciplines involved.

BACKGROUND: For several years, EDs in the UK NHS have faced considerable 
increases in attendance rates. Walk-in centres (WiCs) and minor injuries units 
(MIUs) have been suggested as solutions. We aimed to investigate the 
associations between practice and practice population characteristics with ED 
attendance rates or combined ED/WiC/MIU attendance, and the associations between 
WiC/MIU and ED attendance.
METHODS: We used general practice-level data including 7462 English practices in 
2012/2013 and present adjusted regression coefficients from linear multivariable 
analysis for relationships between patients' emergency attendance rates and 
practice characteristics.
RESULTS: Every percentage-point increase in patients reporting inability to make 
an appointment was associated with an increase in emergency attendance by 0.36 
(95% CI 0.06 to 0.66) per 1000 population. Percentage-point increases in 
patients unable to speak to a general practitioner (GP)/nurse within two 
workdays and patients able to speak often to their preferred GP were associated 
with increased emergency attendance/1000 population by 0.23 (95% CI 0.05 to 
0.42) and 0.10 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.19), respectively. Practices in areas 
encompassing several towns (conurbations) had higher attendance than rural 
practices, as did practices with more non-UK-qualified GPs. Practice population 
characteristics associated with increased emergency attendance included higher 
unemployment rates, higher percentage of UK whites and lower male life 
expectancy, which showed stronger associations than practice characteristics. 
Furthermore, higher MIU or WiC attendance rates were associated with lower ED 
attendance rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Improving availability of appointments and opportunities to speak a 
GP/nurse at short notice might reduce ED attendance. Establishing MIUs and WiCs 
might also reduce ED attendance.

As many as 20-55% of patients with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
experience chronic endocrine dysfunction, leading to impaired quality of life, 
impaired rehabilitation efforts and lowered life expectancy. Endocrine 
dysfunction after TBI is thought to result from acceleration-deceleration forces 
to the brain within the skull, creating enduring hypothalamic and pituitary 
neuropathology, and subsequent hypothalamic-pituitary endocrine (HPE) 
dysfunction. These experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that a 
single diffuse TBI results in chronic dysfunction of corticosterone (CORT), a 
glucocorticoid released in response to stress and testosterone. We used a rodent 
model of diffuse TBI induced by midline fluid percussion injury (mFPI). At 
2months postinjury compared with uninjured control animals, circulating levels 
of CORT were evaluated at rest, under restraint stress and in response to 
dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid commonly used to test HPE axis 
regulation. Testosterone was evaluated at rest. Further, we assessed changes in 
injury-induced neuron morphology (Golgi stain), neuropathology (silver stain) 
and activated astrocytes (GFAP) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the 
hypothalamus. Resting plasma CORT levels were decreased at 2months postinjury 
and there was a blunted CORT increase in response to restraint induced stress. 
No changes in testosterone were measured. These changes in CORT were observed 
concomitantly with altered complexity of neuron processes in the PVN over time, 
devoid of neuropathology or astrocytosis. Results provide evidence that a single 
moderate diffuse TBI leads to changes in CORT function, which can contribute to 
the persistence of symptoms related to endocrine dysfunction. Future experiments 
aim to evaluate additional HP-related hormones and endocrine circuit pathology 
following diffuse TBI.

Whether β1 integrin ectodomains visit conformational states similarly to β2 and 
β3 integrins has not been characterized. Furthermore, despite a wealth of 
activating and inhibitory antibodies to β1 integrins, the conformational states 
that these antibodies stabilize, and the relation of these conformations to 
function, remain incompletely characterized. Using negative-stain electron 
microscopy, we show that the integrin α5β1 ectodomain adopts extended-closed and 
extended-open conformations as well as a bent conformation. Antibodies SNAKA51, 
8E3, N29, and 9EG7 bind to different domains in the α5 or β1 legs, activate, and 
stabilize extended ectodomain conformations. Antibodies 12G10 and HUTS-4 bind to 
the β1 βI domain and hybrid domains, respectively, activate, and stabilize the 
open headpiece conformation. Antibody TS2/16 binds a similar epitope as 12G10, 
activates, and appears to stabilize an open βI domain conformation without 
requiring extension or hybrid domain swing-out. mAb13 and SG/19 bind to the βI 
domain and βI-hybrid domain interface, respectively, inhibit, and stabilize the 
closed conformation of the headpiece. The effects of the antibodies on cell 
adhesion to fibronectin substrates suggest that the extended-open conformation 
of α5β1 is adhesive and that the extended-closed and bent-closed conformations 
are nonadhesive. The functional effects and binding sites of antibodies and 
fibronectin were consistent with their ability in binding to α5β1 on cell 
surfaces to cross-enhance or inhibit one another by competitive or 
noncompetitive (allosteric) mechanisms.

OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to predict the knee extension strength and 
post-operative function in quadriceps resection for soft-tissue sarcoma of the 
thigh.
METHODS: A total of 18 patients (14 men, four women) underwent total or partial 
quadriceps resection for soft-tissue sarcoma of the thigh between 2002 and 2014. 
The number of resected quadriceps was surveyed, knee extension strength was 
measured with the Biodex isokinetic dynamometer system (affected side/unaffected 
side) and relationships between these were examined. The Musculoskeletal Tumor 
Society (MSTS) score, Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS), European Quality 
of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) score and the Short Form 8 were used to evaluate 
post-operative function and examine correlations with extension strength. The 
cutoff value for extension strength to expect good post-operative function was 
also calculated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and 
Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: Extension strength decreased when the number of resected quadriceps 
increased (p < 0.001), and was associated with lower MSTS score, TESS and EQ-5D 
(p = 0.004, p = 0.005, p = 0.006, respectively). Based on the functional 
evaluation scales, the cutoff value of extension strength was 56.2%, the 
equivalent to muscle strength with resection of up to two muscles.
CONCLUSION: Good post-operative results can be expected if at least two 
quadriceps muscles are preserved.Cite this article: A. Tanaka, Y. Yoshimura, K.

Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTH) are one of the key enzymes 
regulating cell wall construction, extension and metabolism. In the study, 44 
XTH protein genes from Medicago truncatula genome were identified using 
bioinformatics, microarray and RT-PCR. Each XTH was showed to possess a highly 
conserved domain ((D/N)-E-(I/L/F/V)-D-(F/I/L)-E-(F/L)-L-G), and most of XTHs 
possess four Cys in the C terminal region, which suggests the potential for 
generating disulfide bonds. Based on the XTH protein sequences, these XTHscan be 
classified into three major families and each family can be subdivided into more 
groups. Examination of the genomic location of XTH genes on M. truncatula 
chromosomes showed that the evolutional expansion of the genes was possibly 
attributed to localized gene duplications. To investigate the possible 
involvement of the XTHs responding to heavy metals and other abiotic stresses, 
the XTH genes were exposed to heavy metal (Hg or Cu), salt and drought stresses. 
There were 28, 21 and 21 MtXTH genes found to respond to HgCl2, salt and drought 
stresses, respectively, but their expression were different under the stresses. 
Some of the XTH genes were well confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). We 
further specified expression of a XTH gene Medtr4g128580 (MtXTH3) under 
different environmental stresses, and showed that MtXTH3 was induced by Hg 
exposure. These results indicated that a group of MtXTHs could be differentially 
expressed under the environmental stresses.

INTRODUCTION: Until recently, treatment options for damage to cartilage in the 
knee were limited to the use of microfracture or, occasionally, mosaicplasty. 
The developments of autologous and characterised chondrocyte implantation have 
provided new treatment options but have large upfront costs. The objective of 
this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of characterised chondrocyte 
implantation in the UK National Health Service.
METHODS: An economic model was constructed in Microsoft Excel®, with patients 
undergoing either microfracture or chondrocyte implantation. Following treatment 
failure, patients can undergo a series of interventions, ultimately ending in 
knee replacement. Effectiveness and utility were modelled using clinical trial 
data, which were supplemented with synthesised registry data, and costs were 
taken from published sources. Results were expressed in clinical events, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and British pounds. Both costs and outcomes 
were discounted at 3.5 % per year.
RESULTS: Chondrocyte implantation is estimated to reduce the lifetime 
probability of knee replacement by 50 % in comparison with microfracture, and to 
increase QALYs by 0.72 (16.57 vs. 15.85). Costs were estimated to be £23,307 for 
chondrocyte implantation, and £8008 for microfracture, with the incremental cost 
of £15,299 for chondrocyte implantation reflecting reduced resource use 
offsetting some of the procedure cost. These values gave a cost per QALY gained 
of £21,245.
CONCLUSION: Chondrocyte implantation is estimated to provide substantial patient 
benefits over a lifetime horizon, with a considerable increase in QALYs. Despite 
the increase in costs, the procedure is cost effective at standard thresholds 
used in the UK.

INTRODUCTION: Once-daily administration of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors 
has been shown to correct erectile dysfunction (ED).
AIM: To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety after once-daily oral 
administration of udenafil 75 mg in men with ED.
METHODS: This clinical trial was an open-label, fixed-dose, 24-week extension 
study (DA8159_EDDL_III) of a 24-week double-blinded efficacy and safety study of 
once-daily udenafil (parent study: DA8159_EDD_III). Subjects received udenafil 
75 mg once daily for 24 weeks during this extension study, and the follow-up 
visit occurred during the 4-week ED treatment-free period.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects were asked to complete the International Index 
of Erectile Function questionnaire and the Global Assessment Questionnaire at 
the 24-week extension and after the 4-week ED treatment-free period, and the 
development of adverse drug reactions was investigated.
RESULTS: In total, 302 subjects were enrolled in this extension study. 
Improvement was shown with an increased erectile function (EF) domain score 
compared with baseline (14.60 ± 4.57) at extension week 48 (23.98 ± 5.44) and a 
slight increase in EF domain score compared with the last time point (week 24) 
of the parent study (P < .001). The Global Assessment Questionnaire showed a 
high improvement rate of 95.4% at the extension 48-week time point. For shift to 
normal, almost half the subjects (45.1%) recovered "normal" EF, and 14.2% of 
subjects reported normal erections after the 4-week ED treatment-free period. 
The occurrence rate of adverse drug reactions was 8%, which consisted mainly of 
flushing and headache.
CONCLUSION: Once-daily dosing of udenafil 75 mg showed excellent efficacy and 
safety with long-term administration and allowed a more spontaneous sexual life.

The life expectancy of people with type 1 diabetes is improving and now 
approaches that of those without diabetes. As this population ages, a growing 
number will be diagnosed with and treated for cancer. Cancer treatments can 
drastically affect insulin requirement and glycemic control through multiple 
mechanisms including high doses of glucocorticoids and targeted therapies that 
directly interfere with cellular pathways involved in the action of insulin. 
Patients with cancer frequently also have alterations in gastrointestinal 
motility or appetite and require supplemental enteral or parenteral nutrition. 
Few studies have evaluated these patients directly, but data on patients with 
and without diabetes suggest that glycemic control may play a larger role in 
cancer outcomes than is often recognized. Collaboration between the treating 
oncologist and diabetologist allows people with diabetes to receive the most 
effective therapies for their cancers without undue risk of hypoglycemia or 
adverse outcomes due to hyperglycemia.

How real-world data compensate for scarce evidence in HTA.

Most guidance developed by NICE is based on a value assessment using clearly 
articulated and published clinical and cost effectiveness criteria. In order to 
enable consistency and fairness across all decisions, NICE uses as a unit of 
health benefit the quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Both QALYs and costs for a 
technology are estimated by long-term disease modelling. This requires a variety 
of clinical input parameters, and often extrapolation beyond the trial period, 
and of intermediate or surrogate to final outcomes. RCT data will remain the 
main data source for the majority of appraisals, but because the data necessary 
for disease modelling is often not available from RCTs, particularly for the UK 
context, the use of non-RCT data is the norm in NICE technology appraisals. This 
does not only apply to data on resource use, service provision and HRQL data, 
but also to efficacy data. In some situations non-RCT data are more relevant to
