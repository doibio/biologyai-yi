The spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula (White), is an invasive planthopper 
that was first discovered in North America in Berks County, Pennsylvania in 
2014. Currently, L. delicatula has spread to eight additional states and 
threatens agricultural, ornamental, and timber commodities throughout the United 
States. The timing of insect life events is very important in the development of 
pest management tools and strategies. In 2019 and 2020, L. delicatula phenology 
was successfully documented in Winchester, Virginia using weekly 5-min 
observational surveys at established monitoring plots. Each year, L. delicatula 
were active in the environment from May to November with initial detections of 
first, second, third, fourth, and adults occurring in May, May, June, June, and 
July, respectively. Cumulative average growing degree days were also calculated 
for the onset of each L. delicatula life stage using local weather data and a 
lower developmental threshold of 10°C. First-instar L. delicatula were initially 
observed at 135 and 111.5, adults at 835 and 887, and egg masses at 1673.5 and 
1611.5 in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Combined, these data can be used by 
growers and land managers to facilitate timing of effective pest management 
strategies.

Changes in Life Expectancy and Disability-Free Life Expectancy in Successive 
Birth Cohorts of Older Cancer Survivors: A Longitudinal Modeling Analysis of the 
US Health and Retirement Study.

Payne CF, Kobayashi LC.

The population of older cancer survivors in the United States is rapidly 
growing. However, little is currently known about how the health of older cancer 
survivors has changed over time and across successive birth cohorts. Using data 
from the US Health and Retirement Study, we parameterized a demographic 
microsimulation model to compare partial cohort life expectancy (LE) and 
disability-free LE for US men and women without cancer and with prevalent and 
incident cancer diagnoses for 4 successive 10-year birth cohorts, born 1918-1927 
to 1948-1957. Disability was defined as being disabled in ≥1 activity of daily 
living. These cohorts had midpoint ages of 55-64, 65-74, and 75-84 years during 
the periods 1998-2008 (the "early" period) and 2008-2018 (the "later" period). 
Across all cohorts and periods, those with incident cancer had the lowest LE, 
followed by those with prevalent cancer and cancer-free individuals. We observed 
declines in partial LE and an expansion of life spent disabled among more recent 
birth cohorts of prevalent-cancer survivors. Our findings suggest that advances 
in treatments that prolong life for individual cancer patients may have led to 
population-level declines in conditional LE and disability-free LE across 
successive cohorts of older cancer survivors.

As people age, maintaining mobility becomes increasingly imperative, therefore 
addressing bone health is the most important way to preserve mobility. Poor bone 
health encompasses a broad spectrum of diseases, but it is most often quantified 
as the cumulative burden of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures. Rates of 
these fractures have been increasing and are expected to continue rising 
globally, attributed to increasing life expectancy worldwide. No single strategy 
will be sufficient to address this global public health issue. Co-ordination 
across a wide array of stakeholders is vital to decrease the health and 
socioeconomic burden of poor bone health. Stakeholders include an assortment of 
specialists ranging from health professionals (primary and secondary care 
clinicians, nurses, physical therapists, and social care workers), 
policy-makers, government bodies (including departments of health and social 
services), employers, civil society, as well as patients and their caregivers. 
 We need to ensure that there is a better understanding of the socioeconomic and 
health consequences of poor bone health to promote better policies to address 
needs. Building a more resilient health system approach to bone health based on 
the evidence and sound decision-making will not only improve population health, 
but will provide cost savings to health systems by preventing poor bone health 
in the first place. Health systems around the world must prioritise bone health 
to preserve mobility and wellbeing in advance of the impending surge in demand 
from ageing populations. Poor bone health is not an inevitable part of ageing. 
Working across the lifespan, we can all benefit from improved bone health 
throughout our lives.

OBJECTIVES: Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is one of the few 
non-pharmacological interventions for people living with dementia shown to be 
effective and cost-effective. What are the current and future cost and 
health-related quality of life implications of scaling-up CST to eligible new 
cases of dementia in England?
METHODS/DESIGN: Data from trials were combined with microsimulation and 
macrosimulation modelling to project future prevalence, needs and costs. Health 
and social costs, unpaid care costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 
compared with and without scaling-up of CST and follow-on maintenance CST 
(MCST).
RESULTS: Scaling-up group CST requires year-on-year increases in expenditure 
(mainly on staff), but these would be partially offset by reductions in health 
and care costs. Unpaid care costs would increase. Scaling-up MCST would also 
require additional expenditure, but without generating savings elsewhere. There 
would be improvements in general cognitive functioning and health-related 
quality of life, summarised in terms of QALY gains. Cost per QALY for CST alone 
would increase from £12,596 in 2015 to £19,573 by 2040, which is below the 
threshold for cost-effectiveness used by the National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (NICE). Cost per QALY for CST and MCST combined would grow from 
£19,883 in 2015 to £30,906 by 2040, making it less likely to be recommended by 
NICE on cost-effectiveness grounds.
CONCLUSIONS: Scaling-up CST England for people with incident dementia can 
improve lives in an affordable, cost-effective manner. Adding MCST also improves 
health-related quality of life, but the economic evidence is less compelling.

in octogenarian.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death around 
the world. Coronary artery bypass grafting offers efficient surgical 
revascularization for ischemic disease. Both on- or off-pump coronary artery 
bypass methods provide promising results to octogenarians, once complete 
vascularization is achieved. However, off-pump bypass requires a certain level 
of experience to achieve sufficient results. We have applied an off-pump 
coronary artery bypass-first strategy to all generations since 2008. This study 
investigated early and long-term results of surgical revascularization for 
octogenarians by a team with an off-pump-first strategy.
METHODS: All cases of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting performed since 
2008 were identified and divided into a young group (age < 80 years) and an old 
group (age ≥ 80 years). Peri-operative results were investigated retrospectively 
in both groups and long-term results for the old group were assessed.
RESULTS: Among the 707 patients, 97% underwent off-pump bypass, and 94 cases 
were classified to the old group. Distal anastomoses and ventilator time were 
identical between groups (young vs. old: 3.3 vs. 3.2; 3.7 h vs. 3.7 h). 
In-hospital death rates were 0.5% and 0% in the young and old groups, 
respectively. With a mean follow-up of 1318 days, actual 1-, 3-, and 5-year 
survival rates for octogenarians were 92.1%, 81.2%, and 68.3%, respectively. 
Nearly half of the patients reached their nineties, which was close to the life 
expectancy of the national general octogenarian.
CONCLUSIONS: An experienced team with an off-pump-first strategy could provide 
valid therapeutic options for octogenarians.

ribozyme.

Synthesis of RNA in early life forms required chemically activated nucleotides, 
perhaps in the same form of nucleoside 5′-triphosphates (NTPs) as in the 
contemporary biosphere. We show the development of a catalytic RNA (ribozyme) 
that generates the nucleoside triphosphate guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP) from 
the nucleoside guanosine and the prebiotically plausible cyclic 
trimetaphosphate. Ribozymes were selected from 1.6 × 1014 different randomized 
sequences by metabolically coupling 6-thio GTP synthesis to primer extension by 
an RNA polymerase ribozyme within 1016 emulsion droplets. Several functional 
RNAs were identified, one of which was characterized in more detail. Under 
optimized reaction conditions, this ribozyme produced GTP at a rate 18,000-fold 
higher than the uncatalyzed rate, with a turnover of 1.7-fold, and supported the 
incorporation of GTP into RNA oligomers in tandem with an RNA polymerase 
ribozyme. These results are discussed in the context of early life forms.

As life expectancy has increased, a growing number of people experience 
conditions, including cancers, that carry complex health and social needs. 
Palliative care services have the potential to address these needs but face 
significant obstacles. One major obstacle is suboptimal interprofessional 
collaboration. This study's goal was an in-depth exploration of interactional 
and organizational barriers and supports of collaboration in palliative care in 
Switzerland. We sought the perspectives of health care professionals, patients' 
family members and leaders and experts in oncology/palliative care delivery (key 
informants) through interviews and focus groups with fifty HPs and key 
informants and ten patients' family members. Qualitative analyses of interviews 
and focus groups used framework analysis. We identified three major themes of 
interaction: personal characteristics, communication, and connectedness with 
other health care professionals; and three major organizational themes: service 
characteristics, standardized communication and processes, and service 
coordination and promotion. Based on our findings, we recommend that health care 
professionals consider strategies to increase their collaboration and 
communication skills and opportunities to interact. We advocate the 
implementation of methods for coordinating services, standardization of 
consultation/referral procedures and communication between health care 
professionals, and the promotion of underutilized services to foster successful, 
sustainable collaboration.

BACKGROUND: Cotton is an important cash crop. The fiber length has always been a 
hot spot, but multi-factor control of fiber quality makes it complex to 
understand its genetic basis. Previous reports suggested that OsGASR9 promotes 
germination, width, and thickness by GAs in rice, while the overexpression of 
AtGASA10 leads to reduced silique length, which is likely to reduce cell wall 
expansion. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the function of GhGASA10 in 
cotton fibers development.
RESULTS: To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying fiber elongation 
regulation concerning GhGASA10-1, we revealed an evolutionary basis, gene 
structure, and expression. Our results emphasized the conservative nature of 
GASA family with its origin in lower fern plants S. moellendorffii. GhGASA10-1 
was localized in the cell membrane, which may synthesize and transport secreted 
proteins to the cell wall. Besides, GhGASA10-1 promoted seedling germination and 
root extension in transgenic Arabidopsis, indicating that GhGASA10-1 promotes 
cell elongation. Interestingly, GhGASA10-1 was upregulated by IAA at fiber 
elongation stages.
CONCLUSION: We propose that GhGASA10-1 may promote fiber elongation by 
regulating the synthesis of cellulose induced by IAA, to lay the foundation for 
future research on the regulation networks of GASA10-1 in cotton fiber 
development.

The impact of age-associated disorders is increasing as the life expectancy of 
the population increments. Cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative 
disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, have the highest social and economic 
burden and increasing evidence show interrelations between them. Particularly, 
dysfunction of the cardiovascular nervous system is part of the dysautonomic 
symptoms of Parkinson's disease, although more studies are needed to elucidate 
the role of cardiac function on it. We analyzed the dopaminergic system in the 
nigrostriatal pathway of Parkinsonian and dyskinetic monkeys and the expression 
of some key proteins in the metabolism and synthesis of catecholamines in the 
heart: total and phosphorylated (phospho) tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and 
membrane (MB) and soluble (S) isoforms of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). 
The dopaminergic system was significantly depleted in all MPTP-intoxicated 
monkeys. MPTP- and MPTP + L-DOPA-treated animals also showed a decrease in total 
TH expression in both right (RV) and left ventricle (LV). We found a significant 
increase of phospho-TH in both groups (MPTP and MPTP + L-DOPA) in the LV, while 
this increase was only observed in MPTP-treated monkeys in the RV. MB-COMT 
analysis showed a very significant increase of this isoform in the LV of MPTP- 
and MPTP + L-DOPA-treated animals, with no significant differences in S-COMT 
levels. These data suggest that MB-COMT is the main isoform implicated in the 
cardiac noradrenergic changes observed after MPTP treatment, suggesting an 
increase in noradrenaline (NA) metabolism. Moreover, the increase of TH activity 
indicates that cardiac noradrenergic neurons still respond despite MPTP 
treatment.

Despite significant progress, metastatic urothelial cancer remains an incurable 
condition with a limited life expectancy. Platinum-based chemotherapy is still 
the mainstay of treatment for metastatic disease, but immunotherapy, antibody 
drug conjugates, and targeted agents have shown encouraging results in several 
recent practice changing trials. In this review, we discuss the standard of 
care, recent therapeutic advances, ongoing clinical trials, and future 
perspectives in metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

INTRODUCTION: The effect of surgical vs nonsurgical management on hip fracture 
mortality of Hispanic-American male veterans has not been rigorously studied. 
Hence, we examined the mortality and life expectancy effect of nonsurgical vs 
surgical management after hip fracture in a geriatric Hispanic-American male 
veterans' population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of Hispanic-American 
male veterans who were 65 years of age or older and suffered a femoral neck or 
intertrochanteric fracture from January 2008 to December 2015. Analysis between 
a surgical cohort (cannulated screw fixation, hemiarthroplasty, total hip 
arthroplasty, or cephalomedullary nail) and a non-surgical cohort was performed. 
In-hospital, 30-day, one-year, and two-year mortality were compared between both 
groups.
RESULTS: Out of 268 patients with hip fracture, 159 (59.2%) were treated 
surgically and 109 (40.8%) non-surgically. The overall in-hospital (9.2% vs 
1.9%, P = .009), 30-day (17.4% vs 5.0%, P = .002), one-year (48.6% vs 23.3%, P < 
.001), and two-year (63.3% vs 36.5%, P < .001) mortality rate was found to be 
higher for the nonoperative group. The average life expectancy of the 
nonoperative cohort was significantly shorter than those who were managed 
surgically (216 days vs 260 days, P < .001).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study shows a higher mortality rate and lower 
life expectancy in geriatric male patients who were treated nonsurgically in a 
Veterans Health Affair hospital facility that mostly serves Hispanic-American 
veterans. Our results provide an expansion to the findings of other geriatric 
studies on hip fracture with focus in a Hispanic-American veteran male 
population.

BACKGROUND: Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is the most common deep neck infection, 
occurring as a consequence of bacterial acute tonsillitis or as a result of 
infection of the Weber glands, with frequent and life-threatening complications.
AIM: To investigate several factors associated with complications and worse 
prognosis, such as defining the method of surgical drainage and treatment of a 
PTA which remains an area of controversy in the literature METHODS: The purpose 
of this retrospective study is to examine the epidemiological, clinical, and 
laboratory findings of 601 adult patients and to discuss them along with their 
treatment plan.
RESULTS: Pharyngalgia was the most common reported symptom, followed by trismus, 
odynophagia, fever, hot potato voice, malaise, and cervical lymphadenopathy. 
Sixty-eight patients developed complications. Streptococcus species were the 
most common pathogens. A statistically significant difference was found in days 
of hospitalization, WBC and CRP levels, age, and the pre-existing systemic 
diseases between patients with and without complications. A comparison of 
patients treated with intravenous and oral antibiotics revealed no statistically 
significant difference.
CONCLUSION: Οver 10% of PTA cases may develop complications, the most common of 
which is extension into deep neck spaces. Comorbid conditions increase the risk 
of complications. Despite the wide range of treatment strategies, incision and 
drainage remain the cornerstone of surgical treatment. In patients with no 
comorbidities, intravenous antibiotics appear to have no advantage over oral 
antibiotics.

The indiscriminate use of pesticides leads to irreparable damage to the 
ecosystem, which motivates for sustainable alternatives like pheromone-assisted 
pest management. The tomato pinworm Tuta absoluta is a major threat to tomato 
cultivation. Moreover, its green management technology uses a pheromone trap 
that has a short field life. To overcome this problem, a pheromone composite 
with graphene oxide (GO) and amine-modified graphene oxide (AGO) that can extend 
the diffusion path has been developed. The composite stimulates an effective 
electrophysiological response in the antenna, which results in trapping of a 
significantly higher number of insects as compared to the commercial septa, thus 
qualifying it for field evaluation. Compared to AGO, the GO composite has 
pheromones assembled into a multilayer, which increases the pheromone diffusion 
path. This in turn resulted in the extension of the pheromone life that 
proportionally increased the pest trapped. This technique will be beneficial to 
farmers as they have longer field efficacy to keep the pest damage low in an 
environmentally friendly manner.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the long-term differences in survival 
between multiple arterial grafts (MAG) and single arterial grafts (SAG) in 
patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the SYNTAX 
study.
METHODS: The present analysis included the randomized and registry-treated CABG 
patients (n = 1509) from the SYNTAX Extended Survival study (SYNTAXES). Patients 
with only venous (n = 42) or synthetic grafts (n = 1) were excluded. The primary 
end point was all-cause death at the longest follow-up. Multivariable Cox 
regression was used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics. 
Sensitivity analysis using propensity matching with inverse probability for 
treatment weights was performed.
RESULTS: Of the 1466 included patients, 465 (31.7%) received MAG and 1001 
(68.3%) SAG. Patients receiving MAG were younger and at lower risk. At the 
longest follow-up of 12.6 years, all-cause death occurred in 23.6% of MAG and 
40.0% of SAG patients [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) (0.55-0.98); P = 0.038], which was confirmed by sensitivity analysis. MAG 
in patients with the three-vessel disease was associated with significant lower 
unadjusted and adjusted all-cause death at 12.6 years [adjusted HR 0.65, 95% CI 
(0.44-0.97); P = 0.033]. In contrast, no significance was observed after risk 
adjustment in patients with the left main disease, with and without diabetes, or 
among SYNTAX score tertiles.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present post hoc analysis of all-comers patients from the 
SYNTAX trial, MAG resulted in markedly lower all-cause death at 12.6-year 
follow-up compared to a SAG strategy. Hence, this striking long-term survival 
benefit of MAG over SAG encourages more extensive use of multiple arterial 
grafting in selected patients with reasonable life expectancy.

Background: Many children with complex chronic conditions (CCCs) are supported 
by medical technologies. Objective: The aim of this study was to understand 
bereaved parent perspectives on technology assistance among this unique 
population. Design: Mixed methods design was used to analyze data from the 
cross-sectional Survey of Caring for Children with CCCs.Setting/Subjects: 
Bereaved parents of children with CCCs who received care at a large academic 
institution in the United States and died between 2006 and 2015. Measurements: 
Survey items were analyzed descriptively and integrated with thematic analysis 
of open-response items to identify key themes pertaining to parents' 
perspectives on technology. Results: 110/211 (52%) parents completed the survey 
and at least 1 open-response item. More than 60% of parents had children with 
congenital/chromosomal or central nervous system progressive CCCs, used 
technology at baseline, and died in the hospital. A subset of parents recalled 
making decisions either not to initiate (n = 26/101, 26%) or to discontinue 
(n = 46/104, 44%) technology at end of life. Parents described both the benefits 
and burdens of technology. Two themes emerged regarding technology's association 
with the (1) intersection with goals of care and (2) complications and regret. 
Within goals of care, two subthemes arose: (a) technology was necessary to give 
time for life extension and/or to say goodbye, and (b) technology greatly 
impacted the child's quality of life and symptoms. Conclusions: Parents have 
nuanced perspectives about the benefits and burdens of technology. It is 
essential to understand parent's most important goals when supporting decisions 
about technology assistance for children with CCCs.

STUDY DESIGN: A biomechanical in vitro investigation.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the function and stability of self-designed biomimetic 
artificial atlanto-odontoid joint (BAAOJ) replacement on the atlantoaxial joint.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Upper cervical fusion surgery is a common treatment 
for various atlantoaxial disorders, and favorable clinical outcome has been 
achieved. However, the fusion surgery results in loss of atlantoaxial motion as 
well as adjacent segments degeneration, reducing the quality of life of patients 
and might produce severe neurological symptoms. Non-fusion technology is 
expected to solve the above problems, but various designed devices have certain 
defects and are still in the exploratory phase.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biomechanical tests were conducted on 10 fresh human 
cadaveric craniocervical specimens in the following sequence: 1) intact 
condition, 2) after the BAAOJ arthroplasty, 3) after BAAOJ fatigue test, 4) 
after odontoidect-omy, and 5) after anterior rigid plate fixation. 
Three-dimensional movements of the C1-C2 segment were evaluated to investigate 
the function and stability of BAAOJ arthroplasty compared with the intact 
condition after the BAAOJ fatigue test, odontoidect-omy, and rigid plate 
fixation.
RESULTS: Comparing the BAAOJ implantation to the intact state, the range of 
motion and neutral zone were slightly reduced in all directions (P > 0.05). 
Compared with the rigid plate fixation, the BAAOJ implantation significantly 
increased the range of motion and neutral zone in all directions, especially in 
the axial rotation (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: We designed a BAAOJ for correcting atlantoaxial disorders arising 
from atlantoaxial instability. As a non-fusion device, the most critical feature 
of BAAOJ replacement is the retention of flexion-extension, lateral bending, and 
axial rotation range of motion similar to the normal state. It can also 
stabilize the atlantoaxial complex, and the BAAOJ itself has a good initial 
stability.Level of Evidence: 4.

BACKGROUND: While life expectancy increases, it is necessary to evaluate whether 
the additional years are lived in good health, particularly in order to adapt 
the health care provision and social measures available to support these 
individuals. Since the 1990s, improvements in perceived health and capacities 
have been observed among older people, however the changes appear to be far less 
favourable among the working-age population and, in particular, the generation 
of people approaching retirement age. The aim of this study was to examine the 
change in the perceived health status of those aged 55 to 65 in France and 
investigate the role of socioeconomic factors in this change.
METHODS: Self-reported health (SRH), chronic condition and activity limitation 
were assessed in 2010 and in 2017 in the French Health Barometer, a general 
population phone survey conducted on over 25,000 persons living in the 
community. The prevalence of all three indicators in 2017, and their evolution 
between 2010 and 2017 were studied according to the main socioeconomic 
determinants.
RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2017, there was a sharp increase in the proportion of 
individuals aged 55-65 reporting poor SRH, chronic condition or activity 
limitation. A much more marked deterioration was observed in the three 
indicators among those aged 55-65 than in older age groups, as well as different 
changes according to socioeconomic determinants. The category of workers with an 
average level of education was particularly affected by the deterioration.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that the generation approaching retirement age 
presents a more significant deterioration in health status than those of 
previous generations. The question of how these trends will be reflected in 
terms of the burden of dependency at later ages remains open and should 
encourage increased monitoring of and prevention among this population in future 
years.

BACKGROUND: Gynecologic oncologists should be aware of the option of conception 
through IVF/PGT-M for families with high BRCA related morbidity or mortality. 
Our objective was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of preimplantation 
genetic testing for selection and transfer of BRCA negative embryo in BRCA 
mutation carriers compared to natural conception.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of two strategies, conception through IVF/PGT-M and 
BRCA negative embryo transfer versus natural conception with a 50% chance of 
BRCA positive newborn for BRCA mutation carriers was compared using a Markovian 
process decision analysis model. Costs of the two strategies were compared using 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs'). All costs were discounted at 3%. 
Incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared to willingness to pay 
threshold was used for cost-effectiveness analysis.
RESULTS: IVF/ PGT-M is cost-effective with an ICER of 150,219 new Israeli 
Shekels, per QALY gained (equivalent to 44,480 USD), at a 3% discount rate.
CONCLUSIONS: IVF/ PGT-M and BRCA negative embryo transfer compared to natural 
conception among BRCA positive parents is cost effective and may be offered for 
selected couples with high BRCA mutation related morbidity or mortality. Our 
results could impact decisions regarding conception among BRCA positive couples 
and health care providers.

OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to investigate long-term, clinically 
important outcomes in patients who underwent permanent pacemaker implantation 
after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
BACKGROUND: The impact of permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVR is 
unknown, and prior studies have produced conflicting results.
METHODS: In this nationwide, population-based cohort study, the study included 
all patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR in Sweden from 2008 to 2018 from 
the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of 
Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended 
Therapies) register. Additional baseline characteristics and information about 
outcomes were obtained by individual crosslinking with other national health 
data registers. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted analyses were performed 
using Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: Of 3,420 patients, 481 (14.1%) underwent permanent pacemaker 
implantation within 30 days after TAVR. The survival rate at 1, 5, and 10 years 
was 90.0%, 52.7%, and 10.9% in the pacemaker group and 92.7%, 53.8%, and 15.3% 
in the nonpacemaker group, respectively (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.88-1.22; 
P = 0.692). The median follow-up was 2.7 years (interquartile range: 2.5, and 
maximum 11.8 years). There was no difference in the risk of cardiovascular death 
(HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.71-1.18; P = 0.611), heart failure (HR: 1.23; 95% CI: 
0.92-1.63; P = 0.157), or endocarditis (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.47-1.69; P = 0.734) 
between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The study found no difference in long-term survival between 
patients who did and did not undergo permanent pacemaker implantation after 
TAVR. As the use of TAVR expands to include younger and low-risk patients with a 
long life expectancy, it will become increasingly important to understand the 
impact of permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVR.

OBJECTIVES: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly experienced in the 
aftermath of major incidents such as terrorism and pandemics. Well-established 
principles of response include effective and scalable treatment for individuals 
affected by PTSD. In England, such responses have combined proactive outreach, 
screening and evidence-based interventions (a 'screen-and-treat' approach), but 
little is known about its cost-effectiveness. The objective of this paper is to 
report the first systematic attempt to assess the cost-effectiveness of this 
approach.
METHODS: A decision modelling analysis was undertaken to estimate the costs per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from a screen-and-treat approach 
compared with treatment-as-usual, the latter involving identification of PTSD by 
general practitioners and referral to psychological therapy services. Model 
input variables were drawn from relevant empirical studies in the context of 
terrorism and the unit costs of health and social care in England. The model was 
run over a 5-year time horizon for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 exposed adults 
from the perspective of the National Health Service and Personal Social Services 
in England.
RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained was £7931. This would be 
considered cost-effective 88% of the time at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
£20 000 per QALY gained, the threshold associated with the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence in England. Sensitivity analysis confirmed this 
result was robust.
CONCLUSIONS: A screen-and-treat approach for identifying and treating PTSD in 
adults following terrorist attacks appears cost-effective in England compared 
with treatment-as-usual through conventional primary care routes. Although this 
finding was in the context of terrorism, the implications might be translatable 
into other major incident-related scenarios including the current COVID-19 
pandemic.
