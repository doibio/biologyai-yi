Life expectancy expertise must comply with court-mandated evidentiary standards. 
A proper opinion should abide by 3 principles; it should be generated by a 
qualified expert who applies proper methods to appropriate facts. Several common 
mistakes can make opinions unsuitable for admission into testimony by straying 
from 1 or more of these 3 principles. Examining life expectancy opinions in 
light of these principles allows consumers of life expectancy expertise to 
evaluate the quality of the opinions proffered.

Life care planning is a method of estimating future care costs for patients with 
catastrophic disabilities. The life care planner determines an annual budget for 
care, including further medical and rehabilitative interventions, durable 
medical goods, disposable medical goods and supplies, and recreational 
equipment. After determining an annual budget, the life care planner must use 
scientifically sound methods of determining the patient's life expectancy in 
order to create a lifetime budget.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate health-adjusted life years (HALY) gained in the Solomon 
Islands for the 2016 population over the remainder of their lives, for three 
interventions: hypothetical eradication of cigarettes; 25% annual tax increases 
to 2025 such that tax represents 70% of sales price of tobacco; and a 
tobacco-free generation (TFG).
DESIGN: We adapted an existing multistate life table model, using Global Burden 
of Disease (GBD) and other data inputs, including diseases contributing >5% of 
the GBD estimated disability-adjusted life years lost in the Solomon Islands in 
2016. Tax effects used price increases and price elasticities to change 
cigarette smoking prevalence. The TFG was modelled by no uptake of smoking among 
those 20 years and under after 2016.
RESULTS: Under business as usual (BAU) smoking prevalence decreased over time, 
and decreased faster under the tax intervention (especially for younger ages). 
For example, for 20-year-old males the best estimated prevalence in 2036 was 
22.9% under BAU, reducing to 14.2% under increased tax. Eradicating tobacco in 
2016 would achieve 1510 undiscounted HALYs per 1000 people alive in 2016, over 
the remainder of their lives. The tax intervention would achieve 370 HALYs per 
1000 (24.5% of potential health gain), and the TFG 798 HALYs per 1000 people 
(52.5%). By time horizon, 10.5% of the HALY gains from tax and 8.0% from TFG 
occur from 2016 to 2036, and the remainder at least 20 years into the future.
CONCLUSION: This study quantified the potential of two tobacco control policies 
over maximum health gains achievable through tobacco eradication in the Solomon 
Islands.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of a newly 
developed psycho-educational intervention to reduce fear of cancer recurrence 
(FCR) in early-stage melanoma patients.
METHODS: A within-trial cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis was 
conducted from the Australian health system perspective using data from linked 
Medicare records. Outcomes included FCR, measured with the severity subscale of 
the FCR Inventory; quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) measured using the 
preference-based instrument, Assessment of Quality of Life-8 Dimensions 
(AQoL-8D) and 12-month survival. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
was calculated for two economic outcomes: (1) cost per additional case of 'high' 
FCR avoided and (2) cost per QALY gained. Means and 95% CIs around the ICER were 
generated from non-parametric bootstrapping with 1000 replications.
RESULTS: A total of 151 trial participants were included in the economic 
evaluation. The mean cost of the psycho-educational intervention was AU$1614 per 
participant, including intervention development costs. The ICER per case of high 
FCR avoided was AU$12,903. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve 
demonstrated a 78% probability of the intervention being cost effective relative 
to the control at a threshold of AU$50,000 per extra person avoiding FCR. The 
ICER per QALY gained was AU$116,126 and the probability of the intervention 
being cost effective for this outcome was 36% at a willingness to pay of 
AU$50,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: The psycho-educational intervention reduced FCR at 12 months for 
people at high risk of developing another melanoma and may represent good value 
for money. For the QALY outcome, the psycho-educational intervention is unlikely 
to be cost effective at standard government willingness-to-pay levels. The trial 
was prospectively registered in the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials 
Registry (CTRN12613000304730).

Malignancy is a well-established risk factor for venous thromboembolism and 
while low-molecular-weight heparin therapy has been standard of care for 
cancer-associated thrombosis for many years, many patients find injection 
therapy burdensome. The direct oral anticoagulant edoxaban has been shown to be 
noninferior to dalteparin for the treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis. In 
a Markov simulation model, edoxaban with 6-month time horizon and a United 
States societal perspective with 2017 US dollars, edoxaban was the preferred 
strategy in the general cancer population (6-month cost $6061 with 0.34 quality 
adjusted life years) and in a subgroup of patients with gastrointestinal 
malignancy (6-month cost $7227 with 0.34 quality adjusted life years). The 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio of dalteparin compared to edoxaban was 
$1,873,535 in the general oncology population and $694,058 in the 
gastrointestinal malignancy population.

There has been a steady increase in the prevalence of hearing loss among people 
in many countries around the world. One of the main reasons for this negative 
trend is an increase in life expectancy and an increase in the proportion of the 
elderly people, which means an increase in the number of people with age-related 
changes in the auditory system (presbycusis). Aging is accompanied primarily by 
damage to the structures of the inner ear, but it can also affect the central 
parts of the auditory analyzer, causing frustration at all levels of the 
auditory neural pathway. Presbycusis is accompanied by impaired hearing and 
speech intelligibility. Along with speech hearing, spatial hearing suffers. Just 
as in other countries of the world, in Russia the prevalence of age-related 
hearing loss is increasing year by year. The data on the prevalence of hearing 
impairment in the Russian Federation vary, due to the lack of uniform approaches 
to the registration of persons with hearing impairment. Creation of a surdologic 
register is necessary for information support of complex medical and social 
rehabilitation of surdological patients. Since hearing loss has a significant 
negative impact on the quality of life of patients, knowledge of the prevalence 
of hearing disorders among the population will allow to plan properly the need 
for technical means of hearing and speech rehabilitation at the state level, to 
promote social rehabilitation and active longevity of citizens of older age 
groups.

Publisher: Распространенность нарушений слуха у населения многих стран мира 
неуклонно растет. Одной из основных причин этой негативной тенденции является 
увеличение продолжительности жизни и доли пожилого населения в популяции, а 
значит, увеличение числа людей с возрастными изменениями слуховой системы 
(пресбиакузисом). Старение сопровождается в первую очередь повреждением структур 
внутреннего уха, однако может затрагивать и центральные отделы слухового 
анализатора, обусловливая расстройства на всех уровнях слухового неврального 
пути. Пресбиакузис сопровождается нарушением слуха и разборчивости речи. Наряду 
с речевым слухом страдает пространственный слух. Так же как и в других странах 
мира, в России распространенность возрастной тугоухости растет год от года. 
Сведения о частоте встречаемости нарушений слуха в РФ разнятся, что связано с 
отсутствием единых подходов по учету лиц с нарушениями слуха. Для 
информационного обеспечения комплексной медико-социальной реабилитации 
сурдологических больных необходимо создание сурдологического регистра. Поскольку 
снижение слуха имеет существенное негативное воздействие на качество жизни 
пациентов, знания о распространенности слуховых расстройств у населения позволят 
правильно планировать потребность в технических средствах слухоречевой 
реабилитации на государственном уровне, способствовать социальной реабилитации и 
активному долголетию граждан старших возрастных групп.

Systemic mastocytosis in various forms is characterized by mast cell (MC) 
infiltration of the bone marrow and other internal organs. The most common form 
is the indolent one with life expectancy similar to the normal population, while 
the systemic aggressive myeloproliferative type presents serious damage to 
various organs and is associated with mature and immature atypical mast cells. 
In systemic mastocytosis patients, MCs could be activated with consequent severe 
anaphylactic reactions, along with other symptoms. MCs, which are reactive to a 
variety of external factors such as allergens or other inflammatory or physical 
stimuli, derive from pluripotent cellular progenitor CD34+ which leaves the bone 
marrow as CD34+/CD17+ for implantation in the tissues where they reach 
maturation. MCs participate in the innate and adaptive immune system where they 
play a role in host defense. Activation of MCs occurs through the binding of IgE 
to FcεRI receptor, and initiates the phosphorylation and activation of the p38 
tyrosine MAP kinase. After various reactions there is a subsequent translation 
and generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines which are strongly linked to 
allergic inflammation and mastocytosis. Human cytokine interleukin-37 (IL-37), a 
unique IL-1β family member, has strong protective and anti-inflammatory 
properties, influencing cellular metabolism. We investigated the effect of IL-37 
on inflammation in mastocytosis and report that the hematopoietic expression of 
IL-37 can reduce the inflammatory state in this disease. IL-37 limits excessive 
inflammation, which suggests that IL-37 may be beneficial to the metabolic and 
inflammatory process and is a candidate as a potential new therapeutic agent.

BACKGROUND: Routine cesarean delivery has been shown to decrease 
mother-to-child-transmission of HIV in women with high viral load greater than 
1000 copies/mL; however, women presenting late in pregnancy may not have viral 
load results before delivery.
OBJECTIVE: Our study investigated the costs and outcomes of using a 
point-of-care HIV RNA viral load test to guide delivery compared with routine 
cesarean delivery for all in the setting of unknown viral load.
STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was constructed using TreeAge software 
to compare HIV RNA viral load testing vs routine cesarean delivery for all in a 
theoretical cohort of 1275 HIV-positive women without prenatal care who 
presented at term for delivery, the estimated population of HIV-positive women 
without prenatal care in the United States annually. TreeAge Pro software is 
used to build decision trees modeling clinical problems and perform 
cost-effectiveness, sensitivity, and simulation analysis to identify the optimal 
outcome. The average cost per test was $15.22. To examine the downstream impact 
of a cesarean delivery and because most childbearing women in the United States 
will deliver 2 children, we incorporated a second pregnancy and delivery in the 
model. Primary outcomes were mother-to-child transmission, delivery mode, 
cesarean delivery-related complications, cost, and quality-adjusted life years. 
Model inputs were derived from the literature and varied in sensitivity 
analyses. The cost-effectiveness threshold was $100,000/quality-adjusted life 
year.
RESULTS: Measuring viral load resulted in more HIV-infected neonates than 
routine cesarean delivery for all due to viral exposure during more frequent 
vaginal births in this strategy. There were no observed maternal deaths or 
differences in cesarean delivery-related complications. Quantifying viral load 
increased cost by $3,883,371 and decreased quality-adjusted life years by 63 
compared with routine cesarean delivery for all. With the threshold set at 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life year, the viral load test is cost-effective only 
when the vertical transmission rate in women with high viral load was below 
0.68% (baseline: 16.8%) and when the odds ratio of vertical transmission with 
routine cesarean delivery for all compared with vaginal delivery was above 0.885 
(baseline: 0.3).
CONCLUSIONS: For HIV-infected pregnant women without prenatal care, quantifying 
viral load to guide mode of delivery using a point-of-care test resulted in 
increased costs and decreased effectiveness when compared with routine cesarean 
delivery for all, even after including downstream complications of cesarean 
delivery.

Aortic valve surgery in non-elderly patients represents a very challenging 
patient population. The younger the patient is at the point of aortic valve 
intervention, the longer their anticipated life expectancy will be, with longer 
exposure to valve-related complications and risk for re-operation. Although the 
latest international guidelines recommend aortic valve repair in patients with 
aortic valve insufficiency, what we see in the real world is that the vast 
majority of these aortic valves are replaced. However, current prosthetic valves 
has now been shown to lead to significant loss of life expectancy for 
non-elderly patients up to 50% for patients in their 40s undergoing mechanical 
aortic valve replacement. Bioprostheses carry an even worse long-term survival, 
with higher rates of re-intervention. The promise of trans-catheter 
valve-in-valve technology is accentuating the trend of bioprosthetic 
implantation in younger patients, without yet the appropriate evidence. In 
contrast, aortic valve repair has shown excellent outcomes in terms of quality 
of life, freedom from re-operation and freedom from major adverse valve-related 
events with similar life expectancy to general population as it is also found 
for the Ross procedure, the only available living valve substitute. We are at a 
time when the paradigm of aortic valve surgery needs to change for the better. 
To better serve our patients, we must acquire high quality real-world evidence 
from multiple centers globally - this is the vision of the AVIATOR registry and 
our common responsibility.

BACKGROUND: Botuloscope is a cohort study supported by a French public grant and 
aiming to evaluate a 1-year treatment of the post-stroke spastic upper limb with 
botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) in terms of individual satisfaction with respect 
to personalized goals and quality of life.
METHODS: This was an open-label prospective, multicentric study (11 French 
centres) that followed 330 adults [mean (SD) age 53.7 (13.7) years] over 1 year; 
participants had ranked 5 therapeutic goals at inclusion [mean (SD) 5.1 (7.3) 
years post-stroke], had severe hemiparesis [median motricity index (MI) 40 
(Q1-Q3 24 to 60)], and were assessed at inclusion (M0) and at month 3 (M3) and 
M12. Outcome criteria were: spasticity, range of motion, pain [visual analog 
scale (VAS)], motor function [Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)] and activities (MI; 
Frenchay Arm Test), and overall satisfaction with the achievement of each goal 
(VAS) and quality of life (Reintegration to Normal Life Index). Criteria at M0 
and M12 were compared. Adverse effects were also collected, as were medication 
changes.
RESULTS: The primary goal was comfort and activities for 63% of participants and 
motor function for 36%. Participants underwent a mean of 2.4 injection sessions, 
19% causing adverse effects. The greatest spasticity attenuation occurred with 
wrist flexors (median decrease in MAS -2 [Q1-Q3; -2 to -1], P<10-3). Fewer 
individuals took oral anti-spastic drugs (56% at M12 vs 50% at M0; P<10-2). 
Range of motion increased by 16°, on average (13 to 19; P<10-3) for wrist 
extension. Pain prevalence decreases at rest (29% at M0 vs. 19% at M12; P<10-4) 
and during mobilization (64% vs. 43%; P<10-4), and fewer participants took 
analgesics (25% vs. 17%; P<10-3). Satisfaction was high for the goals "hand 
hygiene" and "pain release" and moderate for "improvement in upper limb 
function". However, function was more improved for participants who selected 
this goal as the first priority than others (P<10-2). Overall, 22% had the goal 
"improving gait and balance", which was reasonably achieved at M12. Quality of 
life improved markedly [median 8 (4 to 11) vs. 6 (3 to 10); P<10-4]. Prevalence 
of complete dissatisfaction with the first objective was 10% to 15%.
CONCLUSION: This is the first long-term follow-up of BoNT-A treatment for upper 
limb spasticity involving a large cohort independent of industry. Quality of 
life was improved by treating upper limb spasticity with BoNT-A, even at 5 years 
post-stroke. Personalizing objectives of the treatment amplified its efficacy. 
BoNT-A was a powerful analgesic when pain was spasticity-related. Treating the 
spastic upper limb also improved balance and gait abilities.

Background Recent publications reached conflicting conclusions about the 
cost-effectiveness of left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) with the Watchman 
device (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) for stroke risk reduction in 
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). This analysis sought to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of LAAC relative to both warfarin and nonwarfarin oral 
anticoagulants (NOACs) using pooled, long-term data from the randomized PROTECT 
AF (Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients 
With Atrial Fibrillation) and PREVAIL (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the 
Watchman LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus 
Long-Term Warfarin) trials. Methods and Results A Markov model was constructed 
from a US payer perspective with a lifetime (20-year) horizon. LAAC clinical 
event rates and stroke outcomes were from pooled PROTECT AF and PREVAIL trial 
5-year data. Warfarin and NOAC inputs were derived from published meta-analyses. 
The model was populated with a cohort of 10 000 patients, aged 70 years, at 
moderate stroke and bleeding risk. Sensitivity analyses were performed. LAAC was 
cost-effective relative to warfarin by year 7 ($48 674/quality-adjusted 
life-year) and dominant (more effective and less costly) by year 10. LAAC became 
cost-effective and dominant compared with NOACs by year 5. Over a lifetime, LAAC 
provided 0.60 more quality-adjusted life-years than warfarin and 0.29 more than 
NOACs. In sensitivity analyses, LAAC was cost-effective relative to warfarin and 
NOACs in 98% and 95% of simulations, respectively. Conclusions Using pooled, 
5-year PROTECT AF and PREVAIL trial data, LAAC proved to be not only 
cost-effective, but cost saving relative to warfarin and NOACs. LAAC with the 
Watchman device is an economically viable stroke risk reduction strategy for 
patients with AF seeking an alternative to lifelong anticoagulation.

BACKGROUND: Climate change driven by human activities has increased annual 
temperatures in Spain by around 1°C since 1980. However, little is known 
regarding the extent to which the association between temperature and mortality 
has changed among the most susceptible population groups as a result of the 
rapidly warming climate. We aimed to assess trends in temperature-related 
cardiovascular disease mortality in Spain by sex and age, and we investigated 
the association between climate warming and changes in the risk of mortality.
METHODS: We did a country-wide time-series analysis of 48 provinces in mainland 
Spain and the Balearic Islands between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2016. We 
extracted daily cardiovascular disease mortality data disaggregated by sex, age, 
and province from the Spanish National Institute of Statistics database. We also 
extracted daily mean temperatures from the European Climate Assessment and 
Dataset project. We applied a quasi-Poisson regression model for each province, 
controlling for seasonal and long-term trends, to estimate the temporal changes 
in the province-specific temperature-mortality associations with distributed lag 
non-linear models. We did a multivariate random-effects meta-analysis to derive 
the best linear unbiased prediction of the temperature-mortality association and 
the minimum mortality temperature in each province. Heat-attributable and 
cold-attributable fractions of death were computed by separating the 
contributions from days with temperatures warmer and colder than the minimum 
mortality temperature, respectively.
FINDINGS: Between 1980 and 2016, 4 576 600 cardiovascular deaths were recorded. 
For warm temperatures, the increase in relative risk (RR) of death from 
cardiovascular diseases was higher for women than men and higher for older 
individuals (aged ≥90 years) than younger individuals (aged 60-74 years), 
whereas for cold temperatures, RRs were higher for men than women, with no clear 
pattern by age group. The heat-attributable fraction of cardiovascular deaths 
was higher for women in all age groups, and the cold-attributable fraction was 
larger in men. The heat-attributable fraction increased with age for both sexes, 
whereas the cold-attributable fraction increased with age for men and decreased 
for women. Overall minimum mortality temperature increased from 19·5°C between 
1980 and 1994 to 20·2°C between 2002 and 2016, which is similar in magnitude to, 
and occurred in parallel with, the observed mean increase of 0·77°C that 
occurred in Spain between these two time periods. In general, between 1980 and 
2016, the risk and attributable fraction of cardiovascular deaths due to warm 
and cold temperatures decreased for men and women across all age groups. For all 
the age groups combined, between 1980-94 and 2002-16, the heat-attributable 
fraction decreased by -42·06% (95% empirical CI -44·39 to -41·06) for men and 
-36·64% (-36·70 to -36·04) for women, whereas the cold-attributable fraction was 
reduced by -30·23% (-30·34 to -30·05) for men and -44·87% (-46·77 to -42·94) for 
women.
INTERPRETATION: In Spain, the observed warming of the climate has occurred in 
parallel with substantial adaptation to both high and low temperatures. The 
reduction in the RR and the attributable fraction associated with heat would be 
compatible with an adaptive response specifically addressing the negative 
consequences of climate change. Nevertheless, the simultaneous reduction in the 
RR and attributable fraction of cold temperatures also highlights the importance 
of more general factors such as socioeconomic development, increased life 
expectancy and quality, and improved health-care services in the country.

Does adult height predict later mortality?: Comparative evidence from the Early 
Indicators samples in the United States.

Wilson SE(1).

Author information:
(1)Brigham Young University, United States. Electronic address: sven@byu.edu.

In this paper, I supplement widely used demographic data on white veterans of 
the Union Army with large and newly collected data on blacks and urban white 
veterans to explore the question of whether adult height predicts late-life 
mortality at the individual level. The data are partitioned into four 
demographic groups based on individual characteristics at the time of 
enlistment: white veterans enlisting in rural areas, mid-size cities, and large 
cities, and African-American veterans of the U.S. Colored Troops (USCT). Across 
the three groups of white veterans, mean height is positively associated with 
life expectancy at age 60, while both mean height and life expectancy for black 
veterans are very close to levels measured among the highly urbanized white 
veterans. I examine whether these group-level differences are robust to 
individual-level analysis by estimating two types of models, separately for each 
group: 1) 10-year mortality at age 60 using a linear probability model with 
company-level fixed effects and 2) a Cox proportional hazard that tracks 
veterans from age 60 to death. For rural whites, I find a significant U-shaped 
relationship between height and 10-year mortality, with both the short and the 
tall at significantly higher risk of death. This pattern becomes more pronounced 
when excluding younger recruits (under aged 24) from the analysis. But this 
relationship does not extend to urban whites or to blacks, where no significant 
height effects are found, and in which the height-mortality relationship among 
the highest mortality groups (whites from the largest cities and blacks) appears 
to be a generally positive one. Overall, the robust positive relationship 
between height and life expectancy at the group level does not exist at the 
individual level.

Aim: To assess the cost-effectiveness of lenalidomide plus low dose 
dexamethasone (Rd) relative to bortezomib-contained therapy (BCT) for newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma patients ineligible for stem cell transplantation 
(ndMM) in China. Materials & methods: A literature review was conducted to 
identify appropriate evidence for developing a cost-effectiveness model 
comparing Rd with BCT for lifetime health outcomes and direct medical costs in 
Chinese ndMM patients. Results: The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio per gained quality-adjusted life years for Rd versus BCT was ¥49,793. The 
chance for Rd to be cost effective, under the cost-effectiveness thresholds of 
three-times the 2018 Chinese gross domestic goods per capita, was 90.8%. 
Conclusion: The cost-effectiveness of Rd relative to BCT for ndMM in Chinese 
patients is highly attractive.

Objectives: part of the cultural and social identity of a population is its 
gastronomy. Currently, the extensive offering of processed meals, the influence 
from different cuisines, and "fashionable trends" (such as the various "foodie" 
trends) has led to confusion amongst consumers and the abandonment of 
traditional recipes. Deep dive in the study of gastronomy, its evolution and the 
nutritional consequences. Methods: bibliographic search in relation to the 
subject in Google and other manual searches. Results: the gastronomy of the 
Canarian Community is characterized by its sobriety and by having simple 
recipes, with dishes made with few ingredients. The consumption of food per 
capita stands above the national average. They consume more non-alcoholic 
beverages (mineral water, juices and soft drinks), dairy products and 
derivatives, oils and fats, legumes, sugars and sweets, however the consumption 
of fruits and vegetables is slightly lower than the national average. Other food 
groups remain around the national average. As a result, this change in their 
dietary habits, together with physical inactivity has favoured an increase in 
obesity and diabetes. Conclusions: the link between nutrition, gastronomy and 
territory can help alleviate the health problems derived from poor food choices 
in the Canary Islands.

Publisher: Objetivos: la gastronomía forma parte de la identidad cultural y 
social de una población. La gran variedad y abundantes ofertas de alimentos 
procesados y de otras zonas, así como la moda foodie, entre otras, han 
ocasionado confusión en el consumidor, lo que ha provocado el abandono del 
recetario tradicional. Nuestro objetivo es profundizar en el estudio de la 
gastronomía y de su evolución y la implicación nutricional que se deriva. 
Métodos: búsqueda bibliográfica relacionada con el tema a través de Google y 
otros medios manuales. Resultados: la gastronomía de Canarias se caracteriza por 
su sobriedad y por poseer un recetario sencillo, con platos elaborados con pocos 
ingredientes. Registra un consumo per cápita en alimentación por encima de la 
media nacional. Se consumen más bebidas no alcohólicas (agua mineral, zumos y 
néctares), lácteos y derivados, aceites y grasas, legumbres, azúcares y dulces; 
sin embargo, el consumo de frutas es inferior y, sobre todo, el de verduras. El 
resto de alimentos se encuentra alrededor de la media. El cambio en el modelo 
alimentario ha favorecido, junto a la inactividad física, al aumento de la 
obesidad y de la diabetes. Conclusiones: la sinergia entre nutrición, 
gastronomía y territorio puede ayudar a paliar los problemas de salud derivados 
de una elección alimentaria errónea en Canarias.

Patients with liver metastases of uveal melanoma (LMUM) die from their 
metastatic evolution within 2 years. We established a nomogram to choose a 
treatment adapted to life expectancy. From 2002 to 2013, we reviewed 224 
patients with LMUM selected by liver MRI. A nomogram was developed based on a 
Cox model. The predictive performance of the model was assessed according to the 
C-statistic, Kaplan-Meier curve, and calibration plots. The median follow-up was 
49.2 months (range, 0.6-70.9). The survival rates at 6, 12, and 24 months were 
0.88 (0.95 CI [0.84-0.93]), 0.68 (0.95 CI [0.62-0.75]), and 0.26 (0.95 CI 
[0.21-0.33]), respectively. The four factors selected for the nomogram with a 
worse prognosis were: A disease-free interval between the UM and LMUM groups of 
less than 6 months (HR = 3.39; 0.95 CI [1.90-6.05]), more than 10 LMUM (HR = 
3.95; 0.95 CI [1.97-4.43]), a maximum LMUM of more than 1200 mm2 (HR = 2.47; 
0.95 CI [1.53-3.98]), and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value greater than 1.5 
(HR = 3.72; 0.95 CI [2.30-6.00]). The model achieved relatively good 
discrimination and calibration (C-statistic 0.71). This nomogram could be useful 
for decision-making and risk stratification for therapeutic options.

BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most widespread sexually 
transmitted infection worldwide. It causes several health consequences, in 
particular accounting for the majority of cervical cancer cases in women. In the 
United Kingdom, a vaccination campaign targeting 12-year-old girls started in 
2008; this campaign has been successful, with high uptake and reduced HPV 
prevalence observed in vaccinated cohorts. Recently, attention has focused on 
vaccinating both sexes, due to HPV-related diseases in males (particularly for 
high-risk men who have sex with men) and an equity argument over equalising 
levels of protection.
METHODS: We constructed an epidemiological model for HPV transmission in the UK, 
accounting for nine of the most common HPV strains. We complemented this with an 
economic model to determine the likely health outcomes (healthcare costs and 
quality-adjusted life years) for individuals from the epidemiological model. We 
then tested vaccination with the three HPV vaccines currently available, 
vaccinating either girls alone or both sexes. For each strategy we calculated 
the threshold price per vaccine dose, i.e. the maximum amount paid for the added 
health benefits of vaccination to be worth the cost of each vaccine dose. We 
calculated results at 3.5% discounting, and also 1.5%, to consider the long-term 
health effects of HPV infection.
RESULTS: At 3.5% discounting, continuing to vaccinate girls remains highly 
cost-effective compared to halting vaccination, with threshold dose prices of 
£56-£108. Vaccination of girls and boys is less cost-effective (£25-£53). 
Compared to vaccinating girls only, adding boys to the programme is not 
cost-effective, with negative threshold prices (-£6 to -£3) due to the costs of 
administration. All threshold prices increase when using 1.5% discounting, and 
adding boys becomes cost-effective (£36-£47). These results are contingent on 
the UK's high vaccine uptake; for lower uptake rates, adding boys (at the same 
uptake rate) becomes more cost effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating girls is extremely cost-effective compared with no 
vaccination, vaccinating both sexes is less so. Adding boys to an already 
successful girls-only programme has a low cost-effectiveness, as males have high 
protection through herd immunity. If future health effects are weighted more 
heavily, threshold prices increase and vaccination becomes cost-effective.
