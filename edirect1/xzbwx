Multiple myeloma (MM) is a disease of the elderly, with a median age at 
diagnosis of approximately 70 years old, and more than 30 % of patients aged 
>75 years. This latter and very elderly population is going to significantly 
rise in the near future given the increase in life expectancy in Western 
countries, and, most importantly, global health status of elderly patients is 
improving, justifying appropriate treatments. Changes in treatment paradigm from 
the old melphalan-prednisone regimen used since the 1970s to its use as a 
backbone in a nontransplant setting since the late 1990s have highlighted 
different subgroups in elderly MM. Some "elderly" patients could be treated like 
transplant eligible patients, more likely those aged between 65 and the early 
70; while a second group would rather be referred to current approved treatment 
regimens for the non-transplant setting. A dose-intensity approach seems 
reasonable for this group, aiming for the best response, eventually the complete 
response (CR) or even minimal residual disease (MRD). The advent of novel agents 
such as thalidomide, bortezomib, and most recently lenalidomide have allowed a 
major improvement in outcome as compared to historical combinations, and soon 
the novel class of monoclonal antibodies should help to further improve these 
patients' survival. Nonetheless, elderly patients are more susceptible to side 
effects and are often unable to tolerate full drug doses, and thus require lower 
dose intensity regimens, or novel drugs or combinations with more favourable 
safety profile. Recent developments in MM have focused on identifying these 
vulnerable patients through geriatric assessment and novel myeloma scoring 
system, including the notions of frailty, disability and comorbidities. 
Eventually, we have reached an era in which we should be able to provide 
individualized treatment strategies and drug doses-"tailored therapy"-to improve 
tolerability and optimize efficacy and ultimately survival for most elderly MM 
patients.

Multiple myeloma is a disorder characterized by accumulation of malignant plasma 
cells in the bone marrow, hypercalcemia, monoclonal protein, and end organ 
damage. Recently newer generation proteosome inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies 
and novel agents have been approved by FDA, which is undoubtedly increasing life 
expectancy of the patients. However, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
still remains the cornerstone of the treatment. In this chapter, we are 
discussing the autologous stem cell transplant, allogeneic stem cell transplant 
and total therapy trials with outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Routine femoral head histopathology during primary total hip 
arthroplasty (THA) has been recently reported as a potentially useful screening 
tool for bone- and bone marrow-associated malignancies. However, 
cost-effectiveness of routine histopathology during THA remains unclear due to 
low prevalence of significant medical findings which alter patient management. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine 
histopathology in diagnosing unsuspected malignancy in patients undergoing 
primary THA.
METHODS: From 1993 to 2011, we retrospectively analyzed routine histopathologic 
findings of 3200 femoral head specimens from 2725 patients that underwent 
primary THA. Preoperative and postoperative diagnoses were classified into 
concordant (clinical diagnosis concurred with pathologic diagnosis), discrepant 
(differing diagnosis with no resultant impact on patient management), and 
discordant (differing diagnosis with subsequent change in patient management). 
Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the incremental cost-utility 
ratio.
RESULTS: A total of 3055 of 3200 pathologic samples were concordant with the 
preoperative diagnosis (95.4%), 140 of 3200 were discrepant (4.4%), and 5 of 
3200 were discordant (0.2%). Routine histopathology revealed 1 unsuspected 
malignancy out of 640 (5 of 3200) femoral heads. The total cost of 
histopathologic screening was $614,664.80. The average cost to identify a 
discrepant case was $4390.46, and the cost to identify a discordant case was 
$122,932.96. The incremental cost-utility ratio was $49,569.74 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates routine femoral head histopathology may be 
cost-effective in diagnosing unsuspected malignancy at $49,569.74/QALY gained 
(less than World Health Organization recommended threshold $159,000/QALY 
gained), providing useful clinical information for surgeons considering the 
value of routine femoral head histopathology in patients undergoing THA.

Implication of external price referencing and parallel trade on pharmaceutical 
expenditure: indirect evidence from lower-income European countries.

External price referencing (EPR) is applied more and more frequently worldwide 
by payers to control pharmaceutical prices. Together with the parallel trade of 
pharmaceuticals, EPR may result in lower pharmaceutical prices in higher-income 
countries and higher prices in lower-income countries, which implies that 
pharmaceutical expenditure grows more rapidly in the latter than in the former 
group. Our objective was to assess this hypothesis. We used hierarchical linear 
models on country-level panel data to show that-after controlling for 
compounding factors such as GDP, the proportion of the old-age population or 
life expectancy-the annual growth rate of pharmaceutical expenditure was 2.1% 
points larger in the lower- than in the higher-income members of the European 
Union between 2000 and 2008. This difference in trends became non-significant 
(0.6% points) after the onset of the global economic crisis. There was no 
significant difference between lower- and higher-income countries in the growth 
rate of non-pharmaceutical health expenditure in either period. Our results 
indirectly support the presence of price convergence of pharmaceuticals among 
European countries, and EPR and parallel trade may provide a reasonable 
explanation to the observed trend difference of pharmaceutical expenditure in 
the two groups of countries between 2000 and 2008. This higher growth rate of 
pharmaceutical expenditure put extra burden on public health care budgets in 
lower-income countries and resulted in disproportionately more cost-containment 
measures compared to higher-income countries after 2008. It remains to be seen 
whether the disappearance of the difference in trend growth rates due to special 
health policy interventions in countries with economic difficulties is temporary 
or permanent.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationships between golf and health.
DESIGN: Scoping review.
DATA SOURCES: Published and unpublished reports of any age or language, 
identified by searching electronic databases, platforms, reference lists, 
websites and from consulting experts.
REVIEW METHODS: A 3-step search strategy identified relevant published primary 
and secondary studies as well as grey literature. Identified studies were 
screened for final inclusion. Data were extracted using a standardised tool, to 
form (1) a descriptive analysis and (2) a thematic summary.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 4944 records were identified with an initial search. 301 
studies met criteria for the scoping review. Golf can provide moderate intensity 
physical activity and is associated with physical health benefits that include 
improved cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic profiles, and improved 
wellness. There is limited evidence related to golf and mental health. The 
incidence of golfing injury is moderate, with back injuries the most frequent. 
Accidental head injuries are rare, but can have serious consequences.
CONCLUSIONS: Practitioners and policymakers can be encouraged to support more 
people to play golf, due to associated improved physical health and mental 
well-being, and a potential contribution to increased life expectancy. Injuries 
and illnesses associated with golf have been identified, and risk reduction 
strategies are warranted. Further research priorities include systematic reviews 
to further explore the cause and effect nature of the relationships described. 
Research characterising golf's contribution to muscular strengthening, balance 
and falls prevention as well as further assessing the associations and effects 
between golf and mental health are also indicated.

Estimation of Survival Probabilities for Use in Cost-effectiveness Analyses: A 
Comparison of a Multi-state Modeling Survival Analysis Approach with Partitioned 
Survival and Markov Decision-Analytic Modeling.

Modeling of clinical-effectiveness in a cost-effectiveness analysis typically 
involves some form of partitioned survival or Markov decision-analytic modeling. 
The health states progression-free, progression and death and the transitions 
between them are frequently of interest. With partitioned survival, progression 
is not modeled directly as a state; instead, time in that state is derived from 
the difference in area between the overall survival and the progression-free 
survival curves. With Markov decision-analytic modeling, a priori assumptions 
are often made with regard to the transitions rather than using the individual 
patient data directly to model them. This article compares a multi-state 
modeling survival regression approach to these two common methods. As a case 
study, we use a trial comparing rituximab in combination with fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide v. fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone for the first-line 
treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We calculated mean Life Years and 
QALYs that involved extrapolation of survival outcomes in the trial. We adapted 
an existing multi-state modeling approach to incorporate parametric 
distributions for transition hazards, to allow extrapolation. The comparison 
showed that, due to the different assumptions used in the different approaches, 
a discrepancy in results was evident. The partitioned survival and Markov 
decision-analytic modeling deemed the treatment cost-effective with ICERs of 
just over £16,000 and £13,000, respectively. However, the results with the 
multi-state modeling were less conclusive, with an ICER of just over £29,000. 
This work has illustrated that it is imperative to check whether assumptions are 
realistic, as different model choices can influence clinical and 
cost-effectiveness results.

A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of secondary fracture prevention by osteoporosis liaison 
service (OLS) relative to no therapy in patients with osteoporosis and a history 
of hip fracture. Secondary fracture prevention by OLS is cost-effective in 
Japanese women with osteoporosis who have suffered a hip fracture.
INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to estimate, from the perspective of 
Japan's healthcare system, the cost-effectiveness of secondary fracture 
prevention by OLS relative to no therapy in patients with osteoporosis and a 
history of hip fracture.
METHODS: A patient-level state transition model was developed to predict 
lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in patients with or 
without secondary fracture prevention by OLS. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of secondary fracture prevention compared with no therapy was 
estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the influence of 
parameter uncertainty on the base case results.
RESULTS: Compared with no therapy, secondary fracture prevention in patients 
aged 65 with T-score of -2.5 resulted in an additional lifetime cost of $3396 
per person and conferred an additional 0.118 QALY, resulting in an ICER of 
$28,880 per QALY gained. Deterministic sensitivity analyses showed that 
treatment duration and offset time strongly affect the cost-effectiveness of 
OLS. According to the results of scenario analyses, secondary fracture 
prevention by OLS was cost-saving compared with no therapy in patients with a 
family history of hip fracture and high alcohol intake.
CONCLUSIONS: Secondary fracture prevention by OLS is cost-effective in Japanese 
women with osteoporosis who have suffered a hip fracture. In addition, secondary 
fracture prevention is less expensive than no therapy in high-risk patients with 
multiple risk factors.

PURPOSE: In 2004, The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines 
incorporated omission of radiation therapy after breast-conservation surgery in 
women ≥70 years old with stage I, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer who 
plan to receive endocrine therapy. One study demonstrated wide variation in 
implementing this change across 13 NCCN institutions. We evaluated the practice 
pattern at our institution.
METHODS: We identified women ≥70 years old treated at our institution from 2009 
to 2014. We calculated radiation therapy omission rate in those meeting the 
guidelines. We explored associations between radiation therapy omission, year of 
diagnosis, and patient characteristics with Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Fisher's 
exact tests.
RESULTS: A total of 667 women met the inclusion criteria, and 117 (18 %) were 
candidates for radiation therapy omission. Mean age among the 117 was 76.3 years 
(Range: 70-95). Overall radiation therapy omission rate was 36.8 %, but varied 
greatly by year of diagnosis (Range: 7.7-54.5 %). This variation persisted after 
excluding women who did not receive endocrine therapy (Mean: 39.0 %, Range: 
0.0-75.0 %). Factors associated with higher radiation therapy omission rates 
included older age and not having pathological nodal evaluation. The radiation 
therapy omission rate did not vary by race, tumor type, grade, or size.
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the NCCN guideline has not been consistent at 
our institution. Our data suggest that other tools should be considered to apply 
the guidelines more consistently. We have implemented a quality improvement 
protocol that incorporates life expectancy estimate and geriatric assessment in 
women meeting the NCCN guideline at our institution.

BACKGROUND: Demand for total hip arthroplasty (THA) is high and expected to 
continue to grow during the next decade. Although much of this growth includes 
working-aged patients, cost-effectiveness studies on THA have not fully 
incorporated the productivity effects from surgery.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked: (1) What is the expected effect of THA on 
patients' employment and earnings? (2) How does accounting for these effects 
influence the cost-effectiveness of THA relative to nonsurgical treatment?
METHODS: Taking a societal perspective, we used a Markov model to assess the 
overall cost-effectiveness of THA compared with nonsurgical treatment. We 
estimated direct medical costs using Medicare claims data and indirect costs 
(employment status and worker earnings) using regression models and 
nonparametric simulations. For direct costs, we estimated average spending 1 
year before and after surgery. Spending estimates included physician and related 
services, hospital inpatient and outpatient care, and postacute care. For 
indirect costs, we estimated the relationship between functional status and 
productivity, using data from the National Health Interview Survey and 
regression analysis. Using regression coefficients and patient survey data, we 
ran a nonparametric simulation to estimate productivity (probability of working 
multiplied by earnings if working minus the value of missed work days) before 
and after THA. We used the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint 
Replacement Registry to obtain revision rates because it contained 
osteoarthritis-specific THA revision rates by age and gender, which were 
unavailable in other registry reports. Other model assumptions were extracted 
from a previously published cost-effectiveness analysis that included a 
comprehensive literature review. We incorporated all parameter estimates into 
Markov models to assess THA effects on quality-adjusted life years and lifetime 
costs. We conducted threshold and sensitivity analyses on direct costs, indirect 
costs, and revision rates to assess the robustness of our Markov model results.
RESULTS: Compared with nonsurgical treatments, THA increased average annual 
productivity of patients by USD 9503 (95% CI, USD 1446-USD 17,812). We found 
that THA increases average lifetime direct costs by USD 30,365, which were 
offset by USD 63,314 in lifetime savings from increased productivity. With net 
societal savings of USD 32,948 per patient, total lifetime societal savings were 
estimated at almost USD 10 billion from more than 300,000 THAs performed in the 
United States each year.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a Markov model approach, we show that THA produces societal 
benefits that can offset the costs of THA. When comparing THA with other 
nonsurgical treatments, policymakers should consider the long-term benefits 
associated with increased productivity from surgery.

Sensory impairments, mainly of vision and hearing, are prevalent among the older 
adults, and are the leading causes of disability in people aged 60 years and 
above around the world. However, epidemiological data on sensory impairments 
(prevalence, association with adverse health outcomes, risk and preventive 
factors, etc.) in community-dwelling older people are sparse in Japan. Using 
data from the Kurabuchi Study, a community-based prospective cohort study of 
adults aged 65 years or older, the author and colleagues estimated the 
prevalence of sensory impairments in this population. Vision and hearing 
impairments were associated with adverse health outcomes, such as depressive 
symptoms, dependence in activities of daily living, and early death. In 
addition, antioxidants, sunlight exposure, hyperglycaemia, and nutritional 
status were identified as possible risk or preventive factors for vision and/or 
hearing impairments. Further research is needed into whether the maintenance or 
improvement of sensory functions contributes to the extension of disability-free 
life expectancy.

A total of 169 specimens of the orange-spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides 
(Hamilton) were collected from fishermen and marine fish farms in the Gulf of 
Tonkin, Vietnam. Five different species of Prosorhynchus Odhner, 1905 were 
recorded, including P. tonkinensis n. sp. The new species differs from all other 
Prosorhynchus species in the presence of an indented posterior extremity. It can 
be distinguished from the most closely related P. atlanticus Manter, 1940 and P. 
crucibulum Rudolphi, 1819 by the extension of the uterus always to the level of 
the ovary, the width and premouth distance in the former, and the arched 
vitellarium and smaller egg size in the latter, and a different host and 
geographical region. Prosorhynchus sp. A (not fully identified in this study) 
has been earlier reported from E. coioides from New Caledonia (see Prosorhynchus 
sp. B of Bray and Justine, 2013), P. luzonicus Velasquez, 1959 is reported 
throughout South-East Asia, and Prosorhynchus sp. B (no further identification 
possible based on a single specimen in this study) and P. maternus Bray & 
Justine, 2006 are reported for the first time from Vietnam. The present study 
demonstrates a close relationship of the Prosorhynchus species composition in 
Vietnam with the Indo-Australian region, warranting further comparative studies 
among the different epinephelids.

Diverging Trends in Cause-Specific Mortality and Life Years Lost by Educational 
Attainment: Evidence from United States Vital Statistics Data, 1990-2010.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy at birth in the United States will likely surpass 80 
years in the coming decade. Yet recent studies suggest that longevity gains are 
unevenly shared across age and socioeconomic groups. First, mortality in midlife 
has risen among non-Hispanic whites. Second, low-educated whites have suffered 
stalls (men) or declines (women) in adult life expectancy, which is 
significantly lower than among their college-educated counterparts. Estimating 
the number of life years lost or gained by age and cause of death, broken down 
by educational attainment, is crucial in identifying vulnerable populations.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using U.S. vital statistics data from 1990 to 2010, this 
study decomposes the change in life expectancy at age 25 by age and cause of 
death across educational attainment groups, broken down by race and gender. The 
findings reveal that mortality in midlife increased for white women (and to a 
lesser extent men) with 12 or fewer years of schooling, accounting for most of 
the stalls or declines in adult life expectancy observed in those groups. Among 
blacks, mortality declined in nearly all age and educational attainment groups. 
Although an educational gradient was found across multiple causes of death, 
between 60 and 80 percent of the gap in adult life expectancy was explained by 
cardiovascular diseases, smoking-related diseases, and external causes of death. 
Furthermore, the number of life years lost to smoking-related, external, and 
other causes of death increased among low- and high school-educated whites, 
explaining recent stalls or declines in longevity.
CONCLUSIONS: Large segments of the American population-particularly low- and 
high school-educated whites under age 55-are diverging from their 
college-educated counterparts and losing additional years of life to 
smoking-related diseases and external causes of death. If this trend continues, 
old-age mortality may also increase for these birth cohorts in the coming 
decades.

OBJECTIVE: This analysis estimated the cost-effectiveness of intravitreal 
aflibercept injection(s) (IAI) for wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) 
compared with other treatments in Japan.
METHODS: This was a cost-utility analysis based on published data. A 
state-transition cohort model was constructed with six health states based on 
best-corrected visual acuity in the better-seeing eye. The cycle time was 4 
weeks, and the time horizon was 12 years. The model compared IAI 2 mg every 8 
weeks (2q8) for 2 years after three initial monthly injections, ranibizumab as 
needed, ranibizumab 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (0.5q4), pegaptanib sodium 0.3 mg every 
6 weeks, verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT), and best supportive care, 
assumed to include medical management and monitoring, but no active therapy. 
Costs (expressed as Japanese yen [JPY]) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
gained were estimated for each treatment and discounted at 2.0%. Input data were 
obtained from clinical studies, the Japanese drug tariff and social insurance 
reimbursement schedule, and expert opinion. The analysis was conducted from the 
societal perspective, including medical costs as well as costs of blindness.
RESULTS: IAI 2q8 was dominant (i.e. more effective in terms of QALYs and less 
costly) to all other comparators (ranibizumab as needed, ranibizumab 0.5q4, 
pegaptanib sodium, PDT, and best supportive care), as shown by the incremental 
cost-utility ratio (i.e. cost per QALY gained).
LIMITATIONS: The strengths of the analysis include the wide range of comparators 
evaluated and the use of Japanese-specific utility data. The limitations include 
the use of one eye, inclusion of published data up to 2 years only, and 
assumptions on disease course over 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: IAI 2q8 was more effective in terms of QALYs and less costly 
compared with other treatments for wAMD in Japan.

Issues surrounding death and dying are now beginning to receive both serious 
attention from researchers in a range of disciplines, and support from those 
organisations which fund research. This study represents an appropriate 
extension of this research agenda to the environment of the nursing home. 
Participant observation was employed to gather data in four nursing homes over a 
period of 411 hours. One theme to emerge was the difficulty all experienced in 
identifying with any clarity a distinct 'dying role'.

Cataracts are a leading cause of reversible blindness in India, where millions 
of people can be effectively treated for this condition with surgery. The 
Aravind Eye Care System in southern India developed an efficient system for 
delivering high-quality and low-cost cataract surgery. We provide a detailed 
accounting of costs of cataract surgery at the system and a cost-utility 
analysis. Total costs per operation were US$120, or $195 per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained. Using these data and population-based estimates of cataract 
prevalence, we calculate that eliminating cataract-related blindness and low 
vision in India would cost $2.6 billion and would yield a net societal benefit 
of $13.5 billion. Factors contributing to the highly cost-effective care at the 
Aravind Eye Care System include the domestic manufacturing of supplies, the use 
of a specialized workforce and standardized protocols, and the presence of few 
regulatory hurdles. Lessons learned from the system can help improve the 
delivery of cataract surgery and other ambulatory care surgeries in India and 
abroad.

PURPOSE: The fixed-dose dual bronchodilator combination (FDC) of tiotropium and 
olodaterol showed increased effectiveness regarding lung function and 
health-related quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) compared with the use of its mono-components. Yet, while 
effectiveness and safety have been shown, the health economic implication of 
this treatment is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the 
cost-utility and budget impact of tiotropium-olodaterol FDC in patients with 
moderate to very severe COPD in the Netherlands.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cost-utility study was performed, using an 
individual-level Markov model. To populate the model, individual patient-level 
data (age, height, sex, COPD duration, baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 
second) were obtained from the tiotropium-olodaterol TOnado trial. In the model, 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second and patient-level data were extrapolated to 
utility and survival, and treatment with tiotropium-olodaterol FDC was compared 
with tiotropium. Cost-utility analysis was performed from the Dutch health care 
payer's perspective using a 15-year time horizon in the base-case analysis. The 
standard Dutch discount rates were applied (costs: 4.0%; effects: 1.5%). Both 
univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Budget impact 
was annually assessed over a 5-year time horizon, taking into account different 
levels of medication adherence.
RESULTS: As a result of cost increases, combined with quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gains, results showed that tiotropium-olodaterol FDC had an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of €7,004/QALY. Without discounting, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was €5,981/QALY. Results were robust in univariate and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Budget impact was estimated at €4.3 million 
over 5 years assuming 100% medication adherence. Scenarios with 40%, 60%, and 
80% adherence resulted in lower 5-year incremental cost increases of €1.7, €2.6, 
and €3.4 million, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Tiotropium-olodaterol FDC can be considered a cost-effective 
treatment under current Dutch cost-effectiveness thresholds.

Multidisciplinary rehabilitation for patients with cerebral palsy: improving 
long-term care.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most frequent causes of child disability in 
developed countries. Children with CP need lifelong assistance and care. The 
current prevalence of CP in industrialized countries ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 per 
1,000 live births, with one new case every 500 live births. Children with CP 
have an almost normal life expectancy and mortality is very low. Despite the low 
mortality rate, 5%-10% of them die during childhood, especially when the severe 
motor disability is comorbid with epilepsy and severe intellectual disability. 
Given this life expectancy, children with CP present with a lifelong disability 
of varying severity and complexity, which requires individualized pathways of 
care. There are no specific treatments that can remediate the brain damage 
responsible for the complex clinical-functional dysfunctions typical of CP. 
There are, however, a number of interventions (eg, neurorehabilitation, 
functional orthopedic surgery, medication, etc) aimed at limiting the damage 
secondary to the brain insult and improving these patients' activity level and 
participation and, therefore, their quality of life. The extreme variability of 
clinical aspects and the complexity of affected functions determine a 
multifaceted skill development in children with CP. There is a need to provide 
them with long-term care, taking into account medical and social aspects as well 
as rehabilitation, education, and assistance. This long-term care must be suited 
according to children's developmental stage and their physical, psychological, 
and social development within their life contexts. This impacts heavily on the 
national health systems which must set up a network of services for children 
with CP, and it also impacts heavily on the family as a whole, due to the 
resulting distress, adjustment efforts, and changes in quality of life. This 
contribution is a narrative review of the current literature on long-term care 
for children with CP, aiming at suggesting reflections to improve these 
children's care.

Mutations of the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common recessive 
monogenic disease worldwide. These mutations alter the synthesis, processing, 
function, or half-life of CFTR, the main chloride channel expressed in the 
apical membrane of epithelial cells in the airway, intestine, pancreas, and 
reproductive tract. Lung disease is the most critical manifestation of CF. It is 
characterized by airway obstruction, infection, and inflammation that lead to 
fatal tissue destruction. In spite of great advances in early and 
multidisciplinary medical care, and in our understanding of the pathophysiology, 
CF is still considerably reducing the life expectancy of patients. This review 
highlights the current development in pharmacological modulators of CFTR, which 
aim at rescuing the expression and/or function of mutated CFTR. While only 
Kalydeco® and Orkambi® are currently available to patients, many other families 
of CFTR modulators are undergoing preclinical and clinical investigations. Drug 
repositioning and personalized medicine are particularly detailed in this review 
as they represent the most promising strategies for restoring CFTR function in 
CF.

Micro ribose nucleic acids (miRNAs) play an important role in biological 
processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Therefore, 
miRNAs are potentially a powerful marker for monitoring cancer and diagnosis. 
Here, we present sensitive signal amplification for miRNAs based on modified 
cycling probe technology with strand displacement amplification. miRNA was 
captured by the template coupled with beads, and then the first cycle based on 
SDA was repeatedly extended to the nicking end, which was produced by the 
extension reaction of miRNA. The products generated by SDA are captured by a 
molecular beacon (MB), which is designed to initiate the second amplification 
cycle, with a similar principle to the cycling probe technology (CPT), which is 
based on repeated digestion of the DNA-RNA hybrid by the RNase H. After one 
sample enrichment and two steps of signal amplification, 0.1 pM of let-7a can be 
detected. The miRNA assay exhibits a great dynamic range of over 100 orders of 
magnitude and high specificity to clearly discriminate a single base difference 
in miRNA sequences. This isothermal amplification does not require any special 
temperature control instrument. The assay is also about signal amplification 
rather than template amplification, therefore minimising contamination issues. 
In addition, there is no need for the reverse transcription (RT) process. Thus 
the amplification is suitable for miRNA detection.

PURPOSE: Adverse drug events (ADEs) lead to adverse clinical outcomes such as 
hospitalization. There is little information about the characteristics of ADEs 
in patients with advanced chronic conditions and have a prognosis of limited 
life expectancy. This study aimed to evaluate (i) the prevalence of ADEs at the 
time of admission to hospital, (ii) the causality, severity, and preventability 
of the ADEs, and (iii) the clinical and pharmacological characteristics 
associated with the ADEs.
METHODS: This is a prospective cross-sectional study (county of Osona, 
Catalonia, Spain). We included patients who required palliative care as 
identified by the NECPAL CCOMS-ICO tool who were hospitalized in an acute 
geriatric unit (AGU). A system of alerts (trigger tool) was used together with a 
multidisciplinary review for the detection of the ADEs.
RESULTS: Over the course of 10 months, 235 patients were recruited. Seventy-six 
ADEs affecting 24.68 % of the sample were identified, and of these, 23 (30.26 % 
of the ADEs; 8.51 % of the sample) were directly related to hospitalization. The 
multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the following risk factors: 
presence of extreme polypharmacy (≥10 medications) (OR = 3.02; 95 % 
CI = 1.48-6.19), anticholinergic burden according to the Anticholinergic Drug 
Scale (ADS) (OR = 2.32; 95 % CI = 1.13-4.78), and treatment complexity according 
to the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) scale (OR = 2.90; 95 % 
CI = 1.44-5.83). The vast majority (94.45 %) of the ADEs were considered to be 
preventable. There were no differences in the survival of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: ADEs are common, largely preventable, and implicated in the 
hospitalization of patients who require palliative care.

The C-terminal extension region of SlGAD3 is likely involved in autoinhibition, 
and removing this domain increases GABA levels in tomato fruits. γ-Aminobutyric 
acid (GABA) is a ubiquitous non-protein amino acid with several health-promoting 
benefits. In many plants including tomato, GABA is synthesized via 
decarboxylation of glutamate in a reaction catalyzed by glutamate decarboxylase 
(GAD), which generally contains a C-terminal autoinhibitory domain. We 
previously generated transgenic tomato plants in which tomato GAD3 (SlGAD3) was 
expressed using the 35S promoter/NOS terminator expression cassette 
(35S-SlGAD3-NOS), yielding a four- to fivefold increase in GABA levels in 
red-ripe fruits compared to the control. In this study, to further increase GABA 
accumulation in tomato fruits, we expressed SlGAD3 with (SlGAD3 OX ) or without 
(SlGAD3ΔC OX ) a putative autoinhibitory domain in tomato using the fruit 
ripening-specific E8 promoter and the Arabidopsis heat shock protein 18.2 (HSP) 
terminator. Although the GABA levels in SlGAD3 OX fruits were equivalent to 
those in 35S-SlGAD3-NOS fruits, GABA levels in SlGAD3ΔC OX fruits increased by 
11- to 18-fold compared to control plants, indicating that removing the 
autoinhibitory domain increases GABA biosynthesis activity. Furthermore, the 
increased GABA levels were accompanied by a drastic reduction in glutamate and 
aspartate levels, indicating that enhanced GABA biosynthesis affects amino acid 
metabolism in ripe-fruits. Moreover, SlGAD3ΔC OX fruits exhibited an orange-ripe 
phenotype, which was associated with reduced levels of both carotenoid and mRNA 
transcripts of ethylene-responsive carotenogenic genes, suggesting that over 
activation of GAD influences ethylene sensitivity. Our strategy utilizing the E8 
promoter and HSP terminator expression cassette, together with SlGAD3 C-terminal 
deletion, would facilitate the production of tomato fruits with increased GABA 
levels.
