multifactorial, including premature aging, drug toxicities, and comorbidities. 
Even if challenges remain, hope should too, with the ultimate goal to end the 
HIV epidemic.

The article presents the analysis results of the grouping of the European Union 
countries with regard to emission levels of gaseous pollutants (NH3, NMVOCs, 
SOx, NOx) and particulate air pollutants (PM10 and PM2.5) which are one of the 
most dangerous type of pollution for human health. Their long-lasting effects on 
the human body may negatively affect health and life expectancy. The analysis 
was based on the taxonomic method of grouping data using the K-means method 
which is a non-hierarchical method. The analysis used the data published by 
Eurostat. Organizing countries into categories of emissions of gaseous and dust 
pollutants to the atmosphere was conducted for four cases: the total level of 
emission, the level of emissions related to the GDP, the area, and per capita. 
The Euclidean distance was a measure of the distance between Member States. The 
obtained results indicate that, depending on the adopted criterion, there is a 
significant change in the composition of individual clusters. This confirms the 
assumptions of the Authors who claimed that in order to develop a more 
comprehensive analysis and assessment of the state of atmospheric pollution in 
EU countries it is necessary to include additional criteria, other than only the 
total emission of a given pollution. The objective of the research was to 
indicate that the analysis of emissions of selected type of pollution, and at 
the same time most threatening to human health, does not fully reflect the 
actual state of the problem when presented only in terms of the emitted amount. 
It is therefore appropriate for EU institutions to take more account of the 
differences between the individual countries in terms of the criteria presented 
in the paper, during the decision-making process concerning the sustainable 
development policy in the field of environmental protection.

OBJECTIVES: Identifying impairments in hip range of motion (ROM) and muscle 
strength in people with hip-related pain, without signs of femoro-acetabular 
impingement syndrome (FAIS).
STUDY AIMS: to determine if hip strength and ROM i) differs between the 
symptomatic and less-symptomatic hip of people with hip-related pain; and 
between people with hip-related pain and healthy controls; and ii) are 
associated with hip-related Quality of Life and pain.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: University laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty participants with hip-related pain who were awaiting hip 
arthroscopy (22 women; age = 37 ± 10yrs), 32 healthy controls (19 women; 
age = 30 ± 10yrs).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hip ROM, muscle strength, pain intensity and the Hip 
disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) were assessed.
RESULTS: Less hip flexion ROM (p = 0.004), and extension (p = 0.004), abduction 
(p = 0.001) and internal rotation (IR) (p = 0.048) strength were measured on the 
symptomatic compared to non-symptomatic side. Hip-related pain participants had 
lower hip abduction strength (p = 0.045), and less flexion (p < 0.001), IR 
(p = 0.027) and external rotation (ER) (p = 0.019) ROM compared to controls. 
Less ER ROM (p = 0.03-0.04), and greater abduction (p = 0.03-0.04) and adduction 
strength (p = 0.02) were associated with better patient reported outcome 
measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Specific impairments in hip ROM and strength were identified in 
people with hip-related pain but no FAIS.

[Percutaneous treatment of mitral regurgitation by Mitraclip in the elderly].

[Article in French]

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the second most common form of valvular heart 
disease. It is classified as either primary (degenerative) or secondary 
(functional). Secondary MR is the consequence of myocardium disease. Primary MR 
from degenerative valve disease is due to a primary disruption of the mitral 
valve apparatus from either prolapsed or flail leaflets. It covers all 
aetiologies in which intrinsic lesions affect one or several components of the 
mitral valve apparatus. Gold-standard therapeutic management of severe primary 
MR is surgery usually to repair but sometime to replace the mitral valve. 
However patients considered to be at high-risk due to their age or the presence 
of comorbidities - accounting for 50% of all patients - are not eligible for 
surgery. Catheter-based interventions have been developed to correct MR 
percutaneously. The only such intervention which has been evaluated in organic 
MR is the edge-to-edge procedure using the MitraClip® (Abbott Vascular, Menlo 
Park, CA). MitraClip® offers an alternative to open surgical repair or 
replacement via a minimally invasive route and it was shown in the EVEREST II 
study that MitraClip® was safer than surgery even though it was less effective 
in reducing MR. A substantial number of patients are ineligible for mitral valve 
surgery because of prohibitive surgical risk. For those patients, MitraClip® may 
offer an alternative treatment option. Percutaneous edge-to-edge repair is the 
first percutaneous option accepted in the 2012 ESC guidelines: Percutaneous 
edge-to-edge procedure may be considered in patients with symptomatic severe 
primary MR who fulfill the echo criteria of eligibility, are judged inoperable 
or at high surgical risk by a 'heart team', and have a life expectancy greater 
than 1 year (recommendation class IIb, level of evidence C). Because of its 
frailty, MitraClip® in the elderly may be a good alternative to mitral surgery 
when indicated for primary or secondary MD.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals has dramatically 
improved with potent antiretroviral therapies. However, organ-specific 
toxicities of some antiretrovirals and persistent inflammation and immune 
activation due to residual virus replication account for a high burden of 
age-associated comorbidities in the HIV population.
METHODS: The prevalence of overt cardiovascular, renal and bone diseases as well 
as their major risk factors were cross-sectionally examined during the year 2014 
in the VACH cohort, a large nationwide population of HIV-infected individuals in 
Spain.
RESULTS: A total of 10,897 HIV-infected patients were examined. Seventy-one 
point four percent were male and the mean age was 48 years. Mean time since HIV 
diagnosis was 15.8 years and mean time on antiretroviral therapy was 13.1 years. 
The proportion of patients with undetectable viral load was 87.1%, whereas 65.7% 
had CD4 counts>500 cells/mm3. Overall, cardiovascular, renal and bone disease 
were recorded in 4.7%, 5.9% and 2.8%, respectively. The prevalence of major risk 
factors was as follows: smoking 51.3%, alcohol abuse 7.8%, overweight/obesity 
42.2%, diabetes 19.9%, dyslipidaemia 72.6%, hypertension 25.6%, and osteoporosis 
11.1%. In the subset of patients older than 55 years-old (18%), all figures for 
overt disease and their major risk factors were significantly greater.
CONCLUSION: Major age-related medical conditions and most of their risk factors 
are highly prevalent in HIV-infected individuals on long-term antiretroviral 
therapy in Spain. Preventive actions, including careful selection of 
antiretroviral agents, should be prioritized in the ageing HIV population.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacists play important role in ensuring timely care delivery at 
the ward level. The optimal level of pharmacist input, however, is not clearly 
defined.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence that assessed the outcomes of 
ward pharmacist input for people admitted with acute or emergent illness.
METHODS: The protocol and search strategies were developed with input from 
clinicians. Medline, EMBASE, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, The Cochrane 
Library, NHS Economic Evaluations, Health Technology Assessment and Health 
Economic Evaluations databases were searched. Inclusion criteria specified the 
population as adults and young people (age >16 years) who are admitted to 
hospital with suspected or confirmed acute or emergent illness. Only randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) published in English were eligible for inclusion in the 
effectiveness review. Economic studies were limited to full economic evaluations 
and comparative cost analysis. Included studies were quality-assessed. Data were 
extracted, summarised. and meta-analysed, where appropriate.
RESULTS: Eighteen RCTs and 7 economic studies were included. The RCTs were from 
USA (n = 3), Sweden (n = 2), Belgium (n = 2), China (n = 2), Australia (n = 2), 
Denmark (n = 2), Northern Ireland, Norway, Canada, UK and Netherlands. The 
economic studies were from UK (n = 2), Sweden (n = 2), Belgium and Netherlands. 
The results showed that regular pharmacist input was most cost effective. It 
reduced length-of-stay (mean = -1.74 days [95% CI: 2.76, -0.72], and increased 
patient and/or carer satisfaction (Relative Risk (RR) = 1.49 [1.09, 2.03] at 
discharge). At £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)-gained 
cost-effectiveness threshold, it was either cost-saving or cost-effective 
(Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) = £632/QALY-gained). No evidence 
was found for 7-day pharmacist presence.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist inclusion in the ward multidisciplinary team improves 
patient safety and satisfaction and is cost-effective when regularly provided 
throughout the ward stay. Research is needed to determine whether the provision 
of 7-day service is cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: BMI is known to be strongly associated with all-cause mortality, but 
few studies have been large enough to reliably examine associations between BMI 
and a comprehensive range of cause-specific mortality outcomes.
METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we used UK primary care data 
from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to national mortality 
registration data and fitted adjusted Cox regression models to examine 
associations between BMI and all-cause mortality, and between BMI and a 
comprehensive range of cause-specific mortality outcomes (recorded by 
International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10] codes). We 
included all individuals with BMI data collected at age 16 years and older and 
with subsequent follow-up time available. Follow-up began at whichever was the 
latest of: start of CPRD research-standard follow up, the 5-year anniversary of 
the first BMI record, or on Jan 1, 1998 (start date for death registration 
data); follow-up ended at death or on March 8, 2016. Fully adjusted models were 
stratified by sex and adjusted for baseline age, smoking, alcohol use, diabetes, 
index of multiple deprivation, and calendar period. Models were fitted in both 
never-smokers only and the full study population. We also did an extensive range 
of sensitivity analyses. The expected age of death for men and women aged 40 
years at baseline, by BMI category, was estimated from a Poisson model including 
BMI, age, and sex.
FINDINGS: 3 632 674 people were included in the full study population; the 
following results are from the analysis of never-smokers, which comprised 
1 969 648 people and 188 057 deaths. BMI had a J-shaped association with overall 
mortality; the estimated hazard ratio per 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was 0·81 (95% 
CI 0·80-0·82) below 25 kg/m2 and 1·21 (1·20-1·22) above this point. BMI was 
associated with all cause of death categories except for transport-related 
accidents, but the shape of the association varied. Most causes, including 
cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases, had a J-shaped 
association with BMI, with lowest risk occurring in the range 21-25 kg/m2. For 
mental and behavioural, neurological, and accidental (non-transport-related) 
causes, BMI was inversely associated with mortality up to 24-27 kg/m2, with 
little association at higher BMIs; for deaths from self-harm or interpersonal 
violence, an inverse linear association was observed. Associations between BMI 
and mortality were stronger at younger ages than at older ages, and the BMI 
associated with lowest mortality risk was higher in older individuals than in 
younger individuals. Compared with individuals of healthy weight (BMI 18·5-24·9 
kg/m2), life expectancy from age 40 years was 4·2 years shorter in obese (BMI 
≥30·0 kg/m2) men and 3·5 years shorter in obese women, and 4·3 years shorter in 
underweight (BMI <18·5 kg/m2) men and 4·5 years shorter in underweight women. 
When smokers were included in analyses, results for most causes of death were 
broadly similar, although marginally stronger associations were seen among 
people with lower BMI, suggesting slight residual confounding by smoking.
INTERPRETATION: BMI had J-shaped associations with overall mortality and most 
specific causes of death; for mental and behavioural, neurological, and external 
causes, lower BMI was associated with increased mortality risk.

Human life expectancy is increasing on a global scale, but healthspan—the period 
of life free from age‐associated ill health—is not improving at a comparable 
rate. This disconnect means that a greater proportion of the general population 
will spend a longer period of their life suffering from one or more debilitating 
age‐associated diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, 
osteoporosis, sarcopenia and various cancers. Understanding the processes 
underlying ageing and age‐related diseases is therefore a major and pressing 
research challenge in biomedical research.

INTRODUCTION: Statins can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients 
with diabetes. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate whether primary 
prevention with statin treatment is cost-effective for newly diagnosed type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in the Chinese context.
METHODS: An economic analysis of primary prevention with statin treatment was 
conducted using the Chinese Outcomes Model for T2DM with a time horizon of a 
lifetime, which was developed and validated based on the Chinese population. 
Clinical costs and utility inputs were gathered from published sources. Lifetime 
discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were measured. The uncertainty was evaluated by 
one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Statin treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg could add 0.08 QALYs with an 
additional $1676 compared with that of no statin management (control strategy) 
over a lifetime horizon, which led to an ICER of $21,924 per QALY gained. At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $27,351 per QALY gained, there was an 
approximately 80% probability of statin treatment being cost-effective compared 
with the control strategy. The model outcomes were most sensitive to the length 
of the expected life and age at the T2DM diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin treatment with atorvastatin is most likely cost-effective 
for primary prevention in Chinese patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

Currently, the number of chronic diseases has increased due to increasing in 
life expectancy of population. Among them, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the 
most prevalent and responsible for the high mortality and morbidity rates. 
Patients with CVD have metabolic, hemodynamic, and musculoskeletal changes. 
There is a debate regarding the correct term for musculoskeletal changes that 
affect this group of patients; therefore, we found in literature myopia, 
muscular atrophy, cardiac cachexia, and sarcopenia. However, although there is 
no standardization in relation to correct term, these musculoskeletal 
consequences directly affect the quality of life and are associated with a poor 
prognosis. In this way, the importance of prevention of muscular atrophy, but 
also of treatment for those patients with progressive muscle decline, is proven. 
We also emphasize the importance of a multi-professional team, because 
therapeutic strategies are needed that are capable of delaying the onset or 
minimizing the consequences of skeletal muscle loss, from pharmacological 
management and nutrition to physical exercise.

Older olds, that is octogenarians, spend small amounts of time for daily 
physical activity, contributing to aggravate their independence limitations up 
to force them to bed and to more and more frequent hospitalizations. All 
progressive muscle contractile impairments, including advanced age-related 
muscle power decline, need permanent management. Inspired by the proven 
capability to recover skeletal muscle contractility and strength by home-based 
functional electrical stimulation and guided by common sense, we suggested to 
older olds a 15-30 min daily routine of 12 easy and safe physical exercises. 
Since persons can do many of them in bed (full-body in-bed gym), hospitalized 
elderly can continue this kind of light training that is an extension of the 
well-established cardiovascular-ventilation rehabilitation before and after 
admission. Monitoring arterial blood pressure before and after the daily routine 
demonstrates that peripheral resistance decreases in a few minutes by the 
functional hyperemia of the trained body muscles. Continued regularly, full-body 
in-bed gym helps to maintain the independence of frail older people and may 
reduce the risks of serious consequences of accidental falls.

Chinese bayberry (Myrica rubra Sieb. et Zucc.) is a typical fruit tree grown in 
the hilly region of Southern China. The fruit is sensitive to storage and 
transportation conditions and presents a major problem in its commercialization. 
The present study was conducted to investigate the regulation of gene expression 
involved in plant hormone signaling pathway in the Chinese bayberry with 
different treatments of heat and 1-methylcyclopene (1-MCP) during postharvest 
storage. In one treatment group (HM group), we exposed Chinese bayberry fruit to 
48 °C for 10 min and then sealed them in a desiccator with 5 μl·L-1 of 1-MCP for 
24 h at 20 °C, followed by storage at 10 °C. Another group (CK group) was 
directly stored at 10 °C without any prior treatment. Samples of fruit were 
collected every three days, at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 d (CK3, CK6, CK9, CK12 and 
CK15; and HM3, HM6, HM9, HM12, and HM15, respectively). The decay index of 
fruits in the CK group increased after six days of storage but did not increase 
until nine days of storage in the HM group. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity 
in the CK group was shown a downtrend during storage, and almost no fluctuation 
from six days. In the HM group, SOD activity increased after three days, but 
decreased sharply after six days storage. Besides, peroxidase (POD) and catalase 
(CAT) activities were shown the similar trend during the storage, both of them 
first increased and then decreased form the six days of storage. These 
physiological data indicated that the sixth day is a crucial time during the 
storage of Chinese bayberry treated with heat and 1-MCP. Therefore, the 
transcriptome libraries were constructed from CK0, CK6, HM6 group, respectively. 
The analysis of top 20 KEGG pathways showed that most differentially expressed 
genes were involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, particularly 
flavonoids and flavanols biosynthesis, in CK0 vs. CK6 and CK0 vs. HM6. However, 
the top three KEGG pathways in CK6 vs. HM6 were the ribosome, RNA transport and 
endocytosis during the storage. Expression of six ethylene receptor (ETR) genes 
and four ethylene-responsive transcription factor (ERF) genes were activated at 
transcriptional level during the postharvest stage and were decreased by heat 
and 1-MCP treatment, and serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (CTR1) was also 
repressed by treatment. Abscisic acid (ABA) -responsive element binding factor 
(ABF) gene, auxin-responsive GH3 gene and transcription factor MYC2 gene also 
showed similar expression pattern with ethylene pathway genes. These results 
might improve our understanding of the mechanisms of heat and 1-MCP inhibition 
of fruit postharvest physiology and prolongation of fruit shelf life.

INTRODUCTION: There have been no reports about predicting survival of patients 
with advanced cancer constructed entirely with objective variables. We aimed to 
develop a prognostic model based on laboratory findings and vital signs using a 
fractional polynomial (FP) model.
METHODS: A multicentre prospective cohort study was conducted at 58 specialist 
palliative care services in Japan from September 2012 to April 2014. Eligible 
patients were older than 20 years and had advanced cancer. We developed models 
for predicting 7-day, 14-day, 30-day, 56-day and 90-day survival by using the FP 
modelling method.
RESULTS: Data from 1039 patients were analysed to develop each prognostic model 
(Objective Prognostic Index for advanced cancer [OPI-AC]). All models included 
the heart rate, urea and albumin, while some models included the respiratory 
rate, creatinine, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, total 
bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase and platelet/lymphocyte ratio. The area under 
the curve was 0.77, 0.81, 0.90, 0.90 and 0.92 for the 7-day, 14-day, 30-day, 
56-day and 90-day model, respectively. The accuracy of the OPI-AC predicting 
30-day, 56-day and 90-day survival was significantly higher than that of the 
Palliative Prognostic Score or the Prognosis in Palliative Care Study model, 
which are based on a combination of symptoms and physician estimation.
CONCLUSION: We developed highly accurate prognostic indexes for predicting the 
survival of patients with advanced cancer from objective variables alone, which 
may be useful for end-of-life management. The FP modelling method could be 
promising for developing other prognostic models in future research.

It is well established that human life expectancy increases considerably with an 
ever-growing number of people suffering from age-related cognitive decline and 
degenerative brain diseases. This necessitates the development of animal models 
to counteract or stop the progression of the decline early enough. Presently, 
primate models are few, and many studies argue for the marmoset as an 
interesting primate model presenting a short life span and being easily 
available in research laboratories. In this article, we propose the marmoset as 
a valid model for cognitive decline. Using a computer touch screen, we trained 
35 marmosets from 2 to 14 years of age to perform reversal learning and 
delayed-matching-to-position tasks. We found typical age-related cognitive 
deficits related to executive functions and spatial working memory. Applying a 
recursive algorithm, we detected 2 critical periods from which deficits appear. 
Mainly, response strategy deficits appear from age 4, whereas impairments in 
inhibitory control appear from age 7-8. Furthermore, the presence of outliers, 
sometimes at an early age, suggests pathological cognitive deficits that would 
require imaging exploration in parallel to behavior.

Individuals with chronic heart failure have high utilisation of hospital-related 
services towards the end of life and receive treatments that provide symptom 
relief without improving life expectancy. The aim of this discussion paper is to 
determine chronic heart failure patients' use of acute hospital-based services 
in their last year of life and to discuss the potential for palliative care to 
reduce service utilisation. A systematic search of the literature was conducted. 
Medline, Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) and SCOPUS 
databases were used to systematically search for literature from database 
commencement to September 2016. Specific inclusion criteria and search terms 
were used to identify relevant studies on heart failure patients' use of 
hospital services in their last year of life. There were 12 studies that 
evaluated the use of hospital-based services by chronic heart failure patients 
at the end of life. In all studies, it was found that chronic heart failure 
patients used acute hospital-based services as death approached. However, only 
two studies examined if palliative care consultations were obtained by patients, 
and neither study assessed the impact that these consultations had on service 
utilisation in the last year of life. Heart failure negatively impacts health 
status, and this is a predictor of service utilisation. Further research is 
needed to determine the efficacy of both primary and secondary palliative care 
in reducing resource use towards the end of life and improving the quality of 
end of life care.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol and drug use can have negative consequences on the health, 
economy, productivity, and social aspects of communities. We aimed to use data 
from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 
to calculate global and regional estimates of the prevalence of alcohol, 
amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, and opioid dependence, and to estimate global 
disease burden attributable to alcohol and drug use between 1990 and 2016, and 
for 195 countries and territories within 21 regions, and within seven 
super-regions. We also aimed to examine the association between disease burden 
and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintiles.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases for original 
epidemiological studies on alcohol and drug use published between Jan 1, 1980, 
and Sept 7, 2016, with out language restrictions, and used DisMod-MR 2.1, a 
Bayesian meta-regression tool, to estimate population-level prevalence of 
substance use disorders. We combined these estimates with disability weights to 
calculate years of life lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), 
and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 1990-2016. We also used a 
comparative assessment approach to estimate burden attributable to alcohol and 
drug use as risk factors for other health outcomes.
FINDINGS: Globally, alcohol use disorders were the most prevalent of all 
substance use disorders, with 100·4 million estimated cases in 2016 
(age-standardised prevalence 1320·8 cases per 100 000 people, 95% uncertainty 
interval [95% UI] 1181·2-1468·0). The most common drug use disorders were 
cannabis dependence (22·1 million cases; age-standardised prevalence 289·7 cases 
per 100 000 people, 95% UI 248·9-339·1) and opioid dependence (26·8 million 
cases; age-standardised prevalence 353·0 cases per 100 000 people, 309·9-405·9). 
Globally, in 2016, 99·2 million DALYs (95% UI 88·3-111·2) and 4·2% of all DALYs 
(3·7-4·6) were attributable to alcohol use, and 31·8 million DALYs (27·4-36·6) 
and 1·3% of all DALYs (1·2-1·5) were attributable to drug use as a risk factor. 
The burden of disease attributable to alcohol and drug use varied substantially 
across geographical locations, and much of this burden was due to the effect of 
substance use on other health outcomes. Contrasting patterns were observed for 
the association between total alcohol and drug-attributable burden and SDI: 
alcohol-attributable burden was highest in countries with a low SDI and 
middle-high middle SDI, whereas the burden due to drugs increased with higher S 
DI level.
INTERPRETATION: Alcohol and drug use are important contributors to global 
disease burden. Effective interventions should be scaled up to prevent and 
reduce substance use disease burden.

PURPOSE: To compare relative cost-effectiveness of serial large-volume 
paracentesis (LVP) and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) 
creation for treatment of refractory ascites.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decisional Markov model was developed to estimate payer 
cost and quality-adjusted life-ears (QALYs) associated with LVP and TIPS 
treatment strategies for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. Survival 
estimates were derived from an individual patient-level meta-analysis of 
prospective randomized clinical trials. Health utilities for potential health 
states were derived from a prospective study of patients with cirrhosis. Cost 
data were derived from national representative claims databases (MarketScan and 
Medicare) and included reimbursement amounts for relevant procedures, 
hospitalizations, and outpatient pharmaceutical costs. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: LVP resulted in 1.72 QALYs gained at a cost of $41,391, whereas TIPS 
resulted in 2.76 QALYs gained at a cost of $100,538. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of TIPS versus LVP was $57,003/QALY. At a 
willingness-to-pay ratio of $100,000/QALY, TIPS has a 62% probability of being 
acceptable compared with LVP.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that TIPS should be considered cost-effective 
in a country that places a relatively high value on health improvements but less 
so in countries with lower levels of health care resources.

Schizothorax prenanti (S. prenanti), an important species of economical fish in 
Southwest China, is susceptible to Aeromonas hydrophila (Ah). To understand the 
immune response to Ah, the transcriptome profiling of spleen of S. prenanti was 
analyzed after Ah infection. A total of 6, 213 different expression genes (DEGs) 
were obtained, including 3, 066 up-regulated DEGs and 3, 147 down-regulated 
DEGs. These DEGs were annotated by KEGG and GO databases, so that the 
immune-related DEGs (IRDs) can be identified and classified. Then, the 
interesting IRDs were screened to build heat map, and the reliability of the 
transcriptome data was validated by qPCR. In order to clarify the mechanism of 
signal transduction in the anti-bacterial immunity, the signaling pathway 
initiated by TLRs was predicted. In this pathway, TLR25 and TLR5 mediate the 
NF-κB and AP-1 signals via MyD88-dependent pathway. Meanwhile, the type I IFN 
(IFNα/β) induced by IRF1 and IRF3/7 may play an important role in the 
anti-bacterial immunity. In conclusion, this study preliminarily provides 
insights into the mechanism of signal transduction after Ah infection in S. 
prenanti, which contributes to exploring the complex anti-bacterial immunity.

Platelets, cells central to hemostasis and thrombosis, are formed from parent 
cell megakaryocytes. Whilst the process is highly efficient in vivo, our ability 
to generate them in vitro is still remarkably inefficient. We proposed that 
greater understanding of the process in vivo is needed and used an imaging 
approach, intravital correlative light-electron microscopy, to visualize 
platelet generation in bone marrow in the living mouse. In contrast to current 
understanding we found that most megakaryocytes enter the sinusoidal space as 
large protrusions rather than extruding fine proplatelet extensions. The 
mechanism for large protrusion migration also differed from that of proplatelet 
extension. In vitro, proplatelets extend by sliding of dense bundles of 
microtubules, whereas in vivo our data showed an absence of microtubule bundles 
in the large protrusion, but the presence of multiple fusion points between the 
internal membrane and the plasma membrane, at the leading edge of the protruding 
cell. Mass membrane fusion therefore drives megakaryocyte large protrusions into 
the sinusoid, significantly revising our understanding of the fundamental

BACKGROUND: To explore survival, causes of death, and the prevalence of 
cardiovascular events in a Norwegian Marfan syndrome (MFS) cohort. MFS is a 
heritable connective tissue disorder associated with reduced life 
expectancy-primarily due to aortic pathology.
METHODS: A follow-up study of 84 MFS adults, initially investigated in 
2003-2004. In 2014-2015, 16 were deceased, 47 of 68 survivors consented to new 
clinical investigations. Analyses of events were performed for 47 survivors and 
16 deceased at follow-up. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR), using the 
mortality rate of the Norwegian population as reference, were calculated for all 
84 and calculated for men and women separately. Causes of death and information 
on cardiovascular events were retrieved from death certificates and medical 
records.
