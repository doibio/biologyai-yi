The conventional definition of endophytes is that they do not cause disease, 
whereas pathogens do. Complicating this convention, however, is the poorly 
explored phenomenon that some microbes are endophytes in some plants but 
pathogens in others. Black cottonwood or poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and wheat 
(Triticum aestivum) are common wild and crop plants, respectively, in the 
Pacific Northwest USA. The former anchors wild, riparian communities, whereas 
the latter is an introduced domesticate of commercial importance in the region. 
We isolated Fusarium culmorum - a well-known pathogen of wheat causing both 
blight and rot - from the leaf of a black cottonwood tree in western Washington. 
The pathogenicity of this cottonwood isolate and of a wheat isolate of F. 
culmorum were compared by inoculating both cottonwood and wheat in a greenhouse 
experiment. We found that both the cottonwood and wheat isolates of F. culmorum 
significantly reduced the growth of wheat, whereas they had no impact on 
cottonwood growth. Our results demonstrate that the cottonwood isolate of F. 
culmorum is endophytic in one plant species but pathogenic in another. Using 
sequence-based methods, we found an additional 56 taxa in the foliar microbiome 
of cottonwood that matched the sequences of pathogens of other plants of the 
region. These sequence-based findings suggest, though they do not prove, that P. 
trichocarpa may host many additional pathogens of other plants.

BACKGROUND: Rapid increase in life expectancy in low- and middle-income 
countries including the World Health Organization's Southeast Asia Region (SEAR) 
has resulted in an increase in the global burden of dementia, which is expected 
to become a leading cause of morbidity. Accurate burden estimates are key for 
informing policy and planning. Given the paucity of data, estimates were 
developed using both a Bayesian methodology and as well as a traditional 
frequentist approach to gain better insights into methodological approaches for 
disease burden estimates.
METHODS: Seven databases were searched for studies published between 2010-2018 
regarding dementia prevalence in SEAR, generating 8 relevant articles. A 
random-effects model (REM) and a Bayesian normal-normal hierarchical model 
(NNHM) were used to obtain the pooled prevalence estimate of dementia for people 
aged 60 and above in SEAR. The latter model was also developed to estimate 
age-specific dementia prevalence. Using UN population estimates for SEAR, total 
and age-specific projections of the burden of dementia in 2015, 2020 and 2030 
were calculated.
RESULTS: The prevalence of dementia in SEAR was found to be 3% (95% confidence 
interval (CI) = 2-6%) in those above age 60 based on REM, and 3.1% (95% credible 
interval = 1.5-5.0%) based on the NNHM. The estimated prevalence varies with 
age, increasing from 1.6% (95% credible interval = 0.8-2.5%) in people aged 
60-69 to 12.4% (95% credible interval = 5.6-20%) in people above the age of 80. 
The risk of developing dementia increased exponentially with age. The number of 
people living with dementia in SEAR in 2015 was estimated at 5.51 million (95% 
credible interval = 2.66-8.82), with projections of 6.66 million (95% credible 
interval = 3.21-10.7) in 2020 and 9.6 million (95% credible 
interval = 4.62-15.36) in 2030.
CONCLUSION: The burden of dementia in SEAR is substantial and will continue to 
increase rapidly by 2030. The lack of research focusing on dementia in SEAR 
points to a significant under-recognition of this disease. The projected rise in 
dementia cases in the future should prompt urgent governmental response to 
address this growing public health issue. We also argue that given the overall 
paucity of data for the region, the Bayesian approach offers a promising 
methodology for improved estimates of disease prevalence and burden and should 
continue to be explored.

University of Hull, UK.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition characterised by the build-up of 
thick, sticky mucus that can damage many of the body's organs. It is a life-long 
disease that results in a shortened life expectancy, often due to the 
progression of advanced lung disease. Treatment has previously targeted the 
downstream symptoms such as diminished mucus clearance and recurrent infection. 
More recently, significant advances have been made in treating the cause of the 
disease by targeting the faulty gene responsible. Hope for the development of 
potential therapies lies with ongoing research into new pharmacological agents 
and gene therapy. This review gives an overview of CF, and summarises the 
current evidence regarding the disease management and upcoming strategies aimed 
at treating or potentially curing this condition.

Across the world, life expectancy is increasing. However, the years of life 
gained do not always correspond to healthy life years, potentially leading to an 
increase in frailty. Given the extent of population aging, the association 
between frailty and age and the impact of frailty on adverse outcomes for older 
people, frailty is increasingly being recognized to be a significant public 
health concern. Early identification of the condition is important to help older 
adults regain function and to prevent the negative outcomes associated with the 
syndrome. Despite the importance of diagnosing frailty, there is no definitive 
evidence or consensus of whether screening should be routinely implemented. A 
broad range of screening and assessment instruments have been developed taking a 
biopsychosocial approach, characterizing frailty as a dynamic state resulting 
from deficits in any of the physical, psychological and social domains, which 
contribute to health. All these aspects of frailty should be identified and 
addressed using an integrated and holistic approach to care. To achieve this 
goal, public health and primary health care (PHC) need to become the fulcrum 
through which care is offered, not only to older people and those that are 
frail, but to all individuals, favoring a life-course and patient-centered 
approach centered around integrated, community-based care. Public health 
personnel should be trained to address frailty not merely from a clinical 
perspective, but also in a societal context. Interventions should be delivered 
in the individuals' environment and within their social networks. Furthermore, 
public health professionals should contribute to education and training on 
frailty at a community level, fostering community-based interventions to support 
older adults and their caregivers to prevent and manage frailty. The purpose of 
this paper is to offer an overview of the concept of frailty for a public health 
audience in order to raise awareness of the multidimensional aspects of frailty 
and on how these should be addressed using an integrated and holistic approach 
to care.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: With the increase in detection of intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), a tailored approach is needed. This study was aimed 
at exploring the natural history of IPMN and suggest optimal treatment based on 
malignancy risk using a nomogram and Markov decision model.
METHODS: Patients with IPMN who underwent surveillance or surgery were included. 
Changes in worrisome features/high-risk stigmata and malignancy conversion rate 
were assessed. Life expectancy and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were 
compared using a nomogram predicting malignancy.
RESULTS: Overall, 2006 patients with histologically confirmed or radiologically 
typical IPMN were enrolled. Of these, 1773 (88.4%), 81 (4.0%), and 152 (7.6%), 
respectively, had branch duct (BD)-, main duct-, and mixed-type IPMN at initial 
diagnosis. The cumulative risk of developing worrisome feature or high-risk 
stigmata was 19.0% and 35.0% at 5- and 10-year follow-up, respectively. The 
progression of malignancy rate at 10-year follow-up was 79.9% for main and mixed 
IPMNs and 5.9% for BD-IPMN. Nomogram-based malignancy risk prediction is well 
correlated with natural history based on pathologic biopsy and shows good 
stratification of survival. The decision model recommends surgery to maximize 
survival and QALY especially in those with >35% malignancy risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with main duct- and mixed-type IPMN, which have a high 
risk of malignancy (79.9%), BD-IPMN is very indolent (5.9%). The nomogram-based 
decision model suggests surgery rather than surveillance for patients with a 
high malignancy risk. The optimal treatment strategy between surgery and 
surveillance should consider patients' health status, malignancy risk, and 
centers' experience.

Background: Research proves that the apprenticeship model, which is the gold 
standard for training surgical residents, is obsolete. For that reason, there is 
a continuing effort toward the development of high-fidelity surgical simulators 
to replace the apprenticeship model. Applying Virtual Reality Augmented Reality 
(AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) in surgical simulators increases the fidelity, level 
of immersion and overall experience of these simulators.Areas covered: The 
objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the 
application of VR, AR and MR for distinct surgical disciplines, including 
maxillofacial surgery and neurosurgery. The current developments in these areas, 
as well as potential future directions, are discussed.Expert opinion: The key 
components for incorporating VR into surgical simulators are visual and haptic 
rendering. These components ensure that the user is completely immersed in the 
virtual environment and can interact in the same way as in the physical world. 
The key components for the application of AR and MR into surgical simulators 
include the tracking system as well as the visual rendering. The advantages of 
these surgical simulators are the ability to perform user evaluations and 
increase the training frequency of surgical residents.

Extrapolating Parametric Survival Models in Health Technology Assessment: A 
Simulation Study.

Extrapolations of parametric survival models fitted to censored data are 
routinely used in the assessment of health technologies to estimate mean 
survival, particularly in diseases that potentially reduce the life expectancy 
of patients. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information 
criterion (BIC) are commonly used in health technology assessment alongside an 
assessment of plausibility to determine which statistical model best fits the 
data and should be used for prediction of long-term treatment effects. We 
compare fit and estimates of restricted mean survival time (RMST) from 8 
parametric models and contrast models preferred in terms of AIC, BIC, and 
log-likelihood, without considering model plausibility. We assess the methods' 
suitability for selecting a parametric model through simulation of data 
replicating the follow-up of intervention arms for various time-to-event 
outcomes from 4 clinical trials. Follow-up was replicated through the 
consideration of recruitment duration and minimum and maximum follow-up times. 
Ten thousand simulations of each scenario were performed. We demonstrate that 
the different methods can result in disagreement over the best model and that it 
is inappropriate to base model selection solely on goodness-of-fit statistics 
without consideration of hazard behavior and plausibility of extrapolations. We 
show that typical trial follow-up can be unsuitable for extrapolation, resulting 
in unreliable estimation of multiple parameter models, and infer that selecting 
survival models based only on goodness-of-fit statistics is unsuitable due to 
the high level of uncertainty in a cost-effectiveness analysis. This article 
demonstrates the potential problems of overreliance on goodness-of-fit 
statistics when selecting a model for extrapolation. When follow-up is more 
mature, BIC appears superior to the other selection methods, selecting models 
with the most accurate and least biased estimates of RMST.

AIM: Eating disorders have increasingly become a public health concern globally. 
This study aimed to reveal the burden of eating disorders at the global, 
regional and national levels using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2017 
data.
METHODS: We extracted the age-standardised rates (ASRs) of prevalence and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and their 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) 
of eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, between 
1990 and 2017 from the GBD 2017 data. The estimated annual percentage changes 
(EAPCs) were calculated to quantify the secular trends of the burden of eating 
disorders.
RESULTS: The ASRs of prevalence and the DALYs of eating disorders continuously 
increased worldwide from 1990 to 2017 by an average of 0.65 (95% UI: 0.59-0.71) 
and 0.66 (95% UI: 0.60-0.72), respectively. The burden of eating disorders was 
higher in females than in males, but the increment in ASRs was greater in males 
than in females over time. In 2017, the highest burden of eating disorders was 
observed in the high sociodemographic index (SDI) regions, especially 
Australasia (ASR of prevalence = 807.13, 95% UI: 664.20-982.30; ASR of DALYs = 
170.74, 95% UI: 113.43-244.14, per 100 000 population), Western Europe and 
high-income North America. However, the most significant increment of the burden 
of eating disorders was observed in East Asia (EAPC for prevalence = 2.23, 95% 
UI: 2.14-2.32; EAPC for DALYs = 2.22, 95% UI: 2.13-2.31), followed by South 
Asia. An increasing trend in the burden of eating disorders at the national 
level was observed among most countries or territories. The countries with the 
top three highest increasing trends were Equatorial Guinea, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and China. Positive associations were found between the burden 
estimates and the SDI levels in almost all geographic regions during the 
observed 28-year period. We also found that the human development indexes in 
2017 were positively correlated with the EAPCs of the ASRs of prevalence (ρ = 
0.222, P = 0.002) and DALYs (ρ = 0.208, P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: The highest burden of eating disorders remains in the high-income 
western countries, but an increasing trend was observed globally and in all 
SDI-quintiles, especially in Asian regions that were highly populous. These 
results could help governments worldwide formulate suitable medical and health 
policies for the prevention and early intervention of eating disorders.

BACKGROUND: No study to our knowledge has examined the use of observational data 
to emulate a clinical trial whereby patients at the time of kidney transplant 
proposal are randomly assigned to an awaiting transplantation or transplantation 
group. The main methodologic issue is definition of the baseline for dialyzed 
patients assigned to awaiting transplantation, resulting in the inability to use 
common propensity score-based approaches. We aimed to use time-dependent 
propensity score to better appraise the benefit of transplantation.
METHODS: We studied 23,231 patients included in the French registry and on a 
transplant waiting list from 2005 to 2016. The main outcome was time to death. 
By matching on time-dependent propensity score, we obtained 10,646 pairs of 
recipients (transplantation group) versus comparable patients remaining on 
dialysis (awaiting transplantation group).
RESULTS: The baseline exposure, that is, pseudo-randomization, was matching 
time. Median follow-up time was 3.5 years. At 10 years' follow-up, the 
restricted mean survival time was 8.8 years [95% confidence interval (CI) = 8.7, 
8.9] in the transplantation group versus 8.2 years (95% CI = 8.1, 8.3) in the 
awaiting transplantation group. The corresponding life expectancy gain was 6.8 
months (95% CI = 5.5, 8.2), and this corresponded to one prevented death at 10 
years for 13 transplantations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study has estimated the life expectancy gain due to kidney 
transplantation. It confirms transplantation as the best treatment for end-stage 
renal disease. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this simple method should also 
be considered for estimating marginal effects of time-dependent exposures.

BACKGROUND: In December 2019, COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan, China, leading to 
national and international disruptions in health care, business, education, 
transportation, and nearly every aspect of our daily lives. Artificial 
intelligence (AI) has been leveraged amid the COVID-19 pandemic; however, little 
is known about its use for supporting public health efforts.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to explore how AI technology is being used 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported in the literature. Thus, it is the 
first review that describes and summarizes features of the identified AI 
techniques and data sets used for their development and validation.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension 
for Scoping Reviews). We searched the most commonly used electronic databases 
(eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo) between April 10 and 12, 2020. These terms 
were selected based on the target intervention (ie, AI) and the target disease 
(ie, COVID-19). Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data 
extraction. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the extracted data.
RESULTS: We considered 82 studies out of the 435 retrieved studies. The most 
common use of AI was diagnosing COVID-19 cases based on various indicators. AI 
was also employed in drug and vaccine discovery or repurposing and for assessing 
their safety. Further, the included studies used AI for forecasting the epidemic 
development of COVID-19 and predicting its potential hosts and reservoirs. 
Researchers used AI for patient outcome-related tasks such as assessing the 
severity of COVID-19, predicting mortality risk, its associated factors, and the 
length of hospital stay. AI was used for infodemiology to raise awareness to use 
water, sanitation, and hygiene. The most prominent AI technique used was 
convolutional neural network, followed by support vector machine.
CONCLUSIONS: The included studies showed that AI has the potential to fight 
against COVID-19. However, many of the proposed methods are not yet clinically 
accepted. Thus, the most rewarding research will be on methods promising value 
beyond COVID-19. More efforts are needed for developing standardized reporting 
protocols or guidelines for studies on AI.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a tool for estimating the 10-year risk of death from other 
causes in men with localized prostate cancer.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We identified 2,425 patients from the Surveillance 
Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey database, age <80, 
newly diagnosed with clinical stage T1-T3a prostate cancer from 
1/1/1998-12/31/2009, with follow-up through 2/28/2013. We developed a Fine and 
Gray competing-risks model for 10-year other cause mortality considering age, 
patient-reported comorbid medical conditions, component scores and items of the 
SF-36 Health Survey, activities of daily living, and sociodemographic 
characteristics. Model discrimination and calibration were compared to 
predictions from Social Security life table mortality risk estimates.
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 7.7 years, 76 men died of prostate-specific 
causes and 465 died of other causes. The strongest predictors of 10-year other 
cause mortality risk included increasing age at diagnosis, higher approximated 
Charlson Comorbidity Index score, worse patient-reported general health (fair or 
poor vs. excellent-good), smoking at diagnosis, and marital status (all other 
vs. married) (all p<0.05). Model discrimination improved over Social Security 
life tables (c-index of 0.70 vs. 0.59, respectively). Predictions were more 
accurate than predictions from the Social Security life tables, which 
overestimated risk in our population.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide a tool for estimating the 10-year risk of dying from 
other causes when making decisions about treating prostate cancer using 
pre-treatment patient-reported characteristics.

The fundamental unit of the human body comprises of the cells which remain 
embedded in a fibrillar network of extracellular matrix proteins which in turn 
provides necessary anchorage the cells. Tissue repair, regeneration and 
reprogramming predominantly involve a traction force mediated signalling 
originating in the ECM and travelling deep into the cell including the nucleus 
via circuitry of spring-like filamentous proteins like microfilaments or actin, 
intermediate filaments and microtubules to elicit a response in the form of 
mechanical movement as well as biochemical changes. The 'springiness' of these 
proteins is highlighted in their extension-contraction behaviour which is 
manifested as an effect of differential traction force. Atomic force microscope 
(AFM) provides the magic eye to visualize and quantify such 
force-extension/indentation events in these filamentous proteins as well as in 
whole cells. In this review, we have presented a summary of the current 
understanding and advancement of such measurements by AFM based single-molecule 
force spectroscopy in the context of cytoskeletal and nucleoskeletal proteins 
which act in tandem to facilitate mechanotransduction.

This paper empirically investigates the long-run effects of major health 
improvements on income growth in the United States. To isolate exogenous changes 
in health, the econometric model uses quasi-experimental variation in 
cardiovascular disease mortality across states over time. Based on data for the 
white population, the results show that there is a causal link between health 
and income per person, and they provide novel evidence that health dynamics 
shape life-cycle incomes. Life-cycle income profiles slope more strongly at the 
beginning and at the end of work life in 2000 than in 1960, indicating that age 
becomes a more prominent determinant of income dynamics over this period. The 
channels for this transformation include better health, higher educational 
attainment, and changing labor supply.

BACKGROUND: Although bariatric surgery is well established as an effective 
treatment for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), there 
exists reluctance to increase its availability for patients with severe T2DM. 
The aims of this study were to examine the impact of bariatric surgery on T2DM 
resolution in patients with obesity and T2DM requiring insulin (T2DM-Ins) using 
data from a national database and to develop a health economic model to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of surgery in this cohort when compared to best medical 
treatment (BMT).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Clinical data from the National Bariatric Surgical 
Registry (NBSR), a comprehensive database of bariatric surgery in the United 
Kingdom, were extracted to analyse outcomes of patients with obesity and 
T2DM-Ins who underwent primary bariatric surgery between 2009 and 2017. Outcomes 
for this group were combined with data sourced from a comprehensive literature 
review in order to develop a state-transition microsimulation model to evaluate 
cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery versus BMT for patients over a 5-year 
time horizon. The main outcome measure for the clinical study was insulin 
cessation at 1-year post-surgery: relative risks (RR) summarising predictive 
factors were determined, unadjusted, and after adjusting for variables including 
age, initial body mass index (BMI), duration of T2DM, and weight loss. Main 
outcome measures for the economic evaluation were total costs, total 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) at willingness-to-pay threshold of GBP£20,000. A total of 2,484 patients 
were eligible for inclusion, of which 1,847 had 1-year follow-up data (mean age 
of 51 years, mean initial BMI 47.2 kg/m2, and 64% female). 67% of patients no 
longer required insulin at 1-year postoperatively: these rates persisted for 4 
years. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was associated with a higher rate of 
insulin cessation (71.7%) than sleeve gastrectomy (SG; 64.5%; RR 0.92, 
confidence interval (CI) 0.86-0.99) and adjustable gastric band (AGB; 33.6%; RR 
0.45, CI 0.34-0.60; p < 0.001). When adjusted for percentage total weight loss 
and demographic variables, insulin cessation following surgery was comparable 
for RYGB and SG (RR 0.97, CI 0.90-1.04), with AGB having the lowest cessation 
rates (RR 0.55, CI 0.40-0.74; p < 0.001). Over 5 years, bariatric surgery was 
cost saving compared to BMT (total cost GBP£22,057 versus GBP£26,286 
respectively, incremental difference GBP£4,229). This was due to lower treatment 
costs as well as reduced diabetes-related complications costs and increased 
health benefits. Limitations of this study include loss to follow-up of patients 
within the NBSR dataset and that the time horizon for the economic analysis is 
limited to 5 years. In addition, the study reflects current medical and surgical 
treatment regimens for this cohort of patients, which may change.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that in patients with obesity and 
T2DM-Ins, bariatric surgery was associated with high rates of postoperative 
cessation of insulin therapy, which is, in turn, a major driver of overall 
reductions in direct healthcare cost. Our findings suggest that a strategy 
utilising bariatric surgery for patients with obesity and T2DM-Ins is cost 
saving to the national healthcare provider (National Health Service (NHS)) over 
a 5-year time horizon.

Considering links between logic and physics is important because of the fast 
development of quantum information technologies in our everyday life. This paper 
discusses a new method in logic inspired from quantum theory using operators, 
named Eigenlogic. It expresses logical propositions using linear algebra. 
Logical functions are represented by operators and logical truth tables 
correspond to the eigenvalue structure. It extends the possibilities of 
classical logic by changing the semantics from the Boolean binary alphabet { 0 , 
1 } using projection operators to the binary alphabet { + 1 , - 1 } employing 
reversible involution operators. Also, many-valued logical operators are 
synthesized, for whatever alphabet, using operator methods based on Lagrange 
interpolation and on the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. Considering a superposition of 
logical input states one gets a fuzzy logic representation where the fuzzy 
membership function is the quantum probability given by the Born rule. 
Historical parallels from Boole, Post, Poincaré and Combinatory Logic are 
presented in relation to probability theory, non-commutative quaternion algebra 
and Turing machines. An extension to first order logic is proposed inspired by 
Grover's algorithm. Eigenlogic is essentially a logic of operators and its 
truth-table logical semantics is provided by the eigenvalue structure which is 
shown to be related to the universality of logical quantum gates, a fundamental 
role being played by non-commutativity and entanglement.

Semantic and Generalized Entropy Loss Functions for Semi-Supervised Deep 
Learning.

The increasing size of modern datasets combined with the difficulty of obtaining 
real label information (e.g., class) has made semi-supervised learning a problem 
of considerable practical importance in modern data analysis. Semi-supervised 
learning is supervised learning with additional information on the distribution 
of the examples or, simultaneously, an extension of unsupervised learning guided 
by some constraints. In this article we present a methodology that bridges 
between artificial neural network output vectors and logical constraints. In 
order to do this, we present a semantic loss function and a generalized entropy 
loss function (Rényi entropy) that capture how close the neural network is to 
satisfying the constraints on its output. Our methods are intended to be 
generally applicable and compatible with any feedforward neural network. 
Therefore, the semantic loss and generalized entropy loss are simply a 
regularization term that can be directly plugged into an existing loss function. 
We evaluate our methodology over an artificially simulated dataset and two 
commonly used benchmark datasets which are MNIST and Fashion-MNIST to assess the 
relation between the analyzed loss functions and the influence of the various 
input and tuning parameters on the classification accuracy. The experimental 
evaluation shows that both losses effectively guide the learner to achieve 
(near-) state-of-the-art results on semi-supervised multiclass classification.

BACKGROUND: Residential aged care facility residents experience high rates of 
hospital admissions which are stressful, costly and often preventable. The EDDIE 
program is a hospital avoidance initiative designed to enable nursing and care 
staff to detect, refer and quickly respond to early signals of a deteriorating 
resident. The program was implemented in a 96-bed residential aged care facility 
in regional Australia.
METHODS: A prospective pre-post cohort study design was used to collect data on 
costs of program delivery, hospital admission rates and length of stay for the 
12 months prior to, and following, the intervention. A Markov decision model was 
developed to synthesize study data with published literature in order to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of the program. Quality adjusted life years 
(QALYs) were adopted as the measure of effectiveness.
RESULTS: The EDDIE program was associated with a 19% reduction in annual 
hospital admissions and a 31% reduction in the average length of stay. The 
cost-effectiveness analysis found the program to be both more effective and less 
costly than usual care, with 0.06 QALYs gained and $249,000 health system costs 
saved in a modelled cohort of 96 residents. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
estimated that there was an 86% probability that the program was cost-effective 
after taking the uncertainty of the model inputs into account.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides promising evidence for the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of a nurse led, early intervention program in preventing 
unnecessary hospital admissions within a residential aged care facility. Further 
research in multi-site randomised studies is needed to confirm the 
generalisability of these results.

BACKGROUND: Expansion of designated cycling networks increases cycling for 
transport that, in turn, increases physical activity, contributing to 
improvement in public health. This paper aims to determine whether cycle-network 
construction in a large city is cost-effective when compared to the status-quo. 
We developed a cycle-network investment model (CIM) for Oslo and explored its 
impact on overall health and wellbeing resulting from the increased physical 
activity.
METHODS: First, we applied a regression technique on cycling data from 123 major 
European cities to model the effect of additional cycle-networks on the share of 
cyclists. Second, we used a Markov model to capture health benefits from 
increased cycling for people starting to ride cycle at the age of 30 over the 
next 25 years. All health gains were measured in quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs). Costs were estimated in US dollars. Other data to populate the model 
were derived from a comprehensive literature search of epidemiological and 
economic evaluation studies. Uncertainty was assessed using deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Our regression analysis reveals that a 100 km new cycle network 
construction in Oslo city would increase cycling share by 3%. Under the 
base-case assumptions, where the benefits of the cycle-network investment 
relating to increased physical activity are sustained over 25 years, the 
predicted average increases in costs and QALYs per person are $416 and 0.019, 
respectively. Thus, the incremental costs are $22,350 per QALY gained. This is 
considered highly cost-effective in a Norwegian setting.
CONCLUSIONS: The results support the use of CIM as part of a public health 
program to improve physical activity and consequently avert morbidity and 
mortality. CIM is affordable and has a long-term effect on physical activity 
that in turn has a positive impact on health improvement.

Life expectancy has grown tremendously. This incredible achievement for mankind 
has been obtained mostly thanks to three pillars: hygiene, antibiotics and 
vaccines. They represent one of the most effective forms of medical 
intervention. From Jenner's work to new vaccines, immunization has reduced the 
consequences of infectious diseases. In the last years antimicrobial resistance 
(AMR) as well as emerging infectious diseases have been rated as major threats 
for our society, as their toll is forecasted to drastically impinge on human 
health and economies. Indeed, recently, the whole world has experienced such 
problems because of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of Covid-19. Herein, we propose an excursus 
through the three main pillars (hygiene, antibiotics and vaccination) that 
contributed to improving life expectancy, their clinical and economic impact and 
the role of vaccines to fight AMR-related diseases and emerging infectious 
diseases like Covid-19.

PURPOSE: The purpose of the current investigation was to explore the extent to 
which the life partners (LPs) of people who stutter (PWS) perceive their loved 
ones' speech-situation specific emotional reaction, expectancy of speech 
disruption, and speech-related communication attitude.
METHODS: Three subtests of the Behavior Assessment Battery (BAB): the Speech 
Situation Checklist - Emotional Reaction (SSC-ER), the Speech Situation 
Checklist - Speech Disruption (SSC-SD) and the Communication Attitude Test for 
Adults Who Stutter (BigCAT) were administered to 33 PWS and modified versions 
were administered to their LPs via Qualtrics Survey Software. Effect of 
relationship duration on subtest scores was considered. Perceived stuttering 
severity by the participant and their LP was also queried as part of a 
demographic questionnaire.
RESULTS: PWS and their LPs rated BigCAT items in a similar way, while they rated 
certain SSC-ER and SSC-SD items differently. Importantly, between-group 
agreement was not affected by relationship duration. Among the PWS and LP, 
perceived stuttering severity influenced all BAB subtest scores.
CONCLUSION: LPs of PWS appear to be in tune with the cognitive aspects of their 
partner's experience of stuttering. This has important clinical implications as
