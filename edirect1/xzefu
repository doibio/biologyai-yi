Advancements in treatment have resulted in increased life expectancy for 
individuals living with HIV. However, there is a dearth of literature focused on 
the intersection of age and HIV status, particularly for older Black sexual 
minority men (SMM) who are disproportionately impacted by HIV. This study aimed 
to examine the intersecting effect of age and HIV status on Black SMM social 
networks in a sample from the Social Network and Prevention Study. Participants 
were 18 years of age or older, identified as cis-gender Black or African 
American, self-identified as SMM, reported unprotected sex within the past six 
months, and resided in Baltimore city or a surrounding county. The sample was 
divided into four categories by age (e.g., young, mature) and HIV status (e.g., 
positive, negative). Of the sample, 167 men were (a) Young & HIV negative, 116 
men were (b) Young & HIV positive, 44 men were (c) Mature & HIV negative, and 42 
men were (d) Mature & HIV positive. Among the four groups, mature men who were 
HIV positive had the fewest average number of alters who knew they were SMM. 
There was also overlap in the range of age of sexual partners across the four 
groups, ranging from 17 to 53.5 (Group 1), 20-60 (Group 2), 29.5-60 (Group 3), 
and 23-63 (Group 4) years of age. Although a cross-sectional analysis, our 
findings suggest value in life course-informed research and practice for 
providing HIV and sexual health programming. Focus on services provided by 
community organizations may help mitigate existing disparities.

OBJECTIVES: The effectiveness of Evoke closed-loop spinal cord stimulation 
(CL-SCS), a novel modality of neurostimulation, has been demonstrated in a 
randomized controlled trial (RCT). The objective of this cost-utility analysis 
was to develop a de novo economic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
Evoke CL-SCS when compared with open-loop SCS (OL-SCS) for the management of 
chronic back and leg pain.
METHODS: A decision tree followed by a Markov model was used to estimate the 
costs and outcomes of Evoke CL-SCS versus OL-SCS over a 15-year time horizon 
from the UK National Health Service perspective. A "high-responder" health state 
was included to reflect improved levels of SCS pain reduction recently reported. 
Results are expressed as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted to 
assess uncertainty in the model inputs.
RESULTS: Evoke CL-SCS was estimated to be the dominant treatment strategy at ~5 
years postimplant (ie, it generates more QALYs while cost saving compared with 
OL-SCS). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that Evoke CL-SCS has a 92% 
likelihood of being cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of 
£20,000/QALY. Results were robust across a wide range of scenario and 
sensitivity analyses.
DISCUSSION: The results indicate a strong economic case for the use of Evoke 
CL-SCS in the management of chronic back and leg pain with or without prior 
spinal surgery with dominance observed at ~5 years.

BACKGROUND: Recently, human life expectancy, aging, and age-related health 
disorders, especially neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), have increased. The increasing number of AD patients causes a heavy social 
and economic burden on society. Since there is no treatment for AD, utilization 
of natural products is currently accepted as an alternative or integrative 
treatment agent against AD.
METHODS: Selection of protein databases related to synaptic plasticity was 
obtained from a gene bank. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was 
performed using Cytoscape 3.9.1. Prediction of Centella asiatica target 
constituents and their relationship with target synaptic plasticity was 
performed using STITCH, followed by GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and 
molecular binding of ligands to presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors 
afterwards.
RESULTS: From the protein database, 446 protein coding genes related to synaptic 
plasticity were found. PPI and KEGG pathway analysis showed potentiality to 
inhibit AKT and mTORC1 pathways. The targeted proteins were TSC1, Rheb, and 
FMRP.
CONCLUSION: This study showed potentiality of Centella asiatica in AD through 
its binding to several proteins such as TSC1, Rheb, and FMRP. This compound in 
Centella asiatica was able to bind to the AKT1 and mTOR signaling pathways. 
Centella asiatica may behold greater potency in AD therapy.

AIM: This scoping review aims to explore the effect of FSS and mental simulation 
on the decision-making skills of nursing students.
BACKGROUND: Full-scale simulation (FSS) has been the most used simulation 
modality in nursing education due to its applicability to enhance both technical 
and non-technical skills. However, FSS can be excessively costly and other 
factors such as technophobia and lack of trained staff and support make FSS less 
accessible, especially for nursing education. Therefore, a novel mental 
simulation that is interactive and supported by visual elements can be a 
substitute for FSS, at least for some of the skills, such as clinical 
decision-making. Reviews comparing the effectiveness of FSS and mental 
simulation on decision-making skills in nursing students are lacking. Further 
knowledge on the effectiveness of these two modalities on decision-making skills 
for nursing students is needed to inform the nursing education curriculum and to 
decide between the two modalities.
DESIGN: This protocol adheres to the guidelines outlined in the PRISMA extension 
for scoping reviews (PRISMA-scr) checklist.
METHOD: The methodological framework for scoping reviews will be followed for 
this scoping review. Scopus, EBSCOhost the Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE and for the grey literature ERIC and 
BASE will be searched for related studies. The search will be limited to January 
2008 and April 2023 (up-to-date) and English. A detailed search strategy was 
developed with an experienced research information manager and this strategy 
will be adapted to each database. A single screening will be performed by an 
author who will screen all abstracts and titles and full-text publications. 
After the study selection step of the framework, the data from the included 
studies will be charted using a data extraction form. The data will be 
synthesised by comparing the effect of FSS and mental simulation on 
decision-making skills.
CONCLUSION: A synopsis of the publication on FSS and mental simulation on nurse 
students' decision-making skills will be useful for stakeholders when choosing 
between two modalities to deliver decision-making skills to nursing students and 
also help to inform the nursing education and simulation practice.

Quality of Life Measures in Aortic Stenosis Research: A Narrative Review.

Frank D, Kennon S, Bonaros N, Romano M, Di Mario C, van Ginkel DJ, Bor W, Kasel 
M, Backer O, Hachaturyan V, Lüske CM, Kurucova J, Bramlage P, Styra R.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with aortic stenosis (AS) not only have a reduced 
life expectancy but also a reduced quality of life (QoL). The benefits of an AS 
intervention may be considered a balance between a good QoL and a reasonably 
extended life. However, the different questionnaires being used to determine the 
QoL, were generally not developed for the specific situation of patients with AS 
and come with strengths and considerable weaknesses. The objective of this 
manuscript was to provide an overview of the available QoL instruments in AS 
research, describe their strengths and weaknesses, and to provide our assessment 
of the utility of the available scoring instruments for QoL measurements in AS.
SUMMARY: We identified and reviewed the following instruments that are used in 
AS research: Short Form Health Survey (SF-36/SF-12), EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), the 
Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale (IIRS), the HeartQoL, the Kansas City 
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure 
Questionnaire (MLHF), the MacNew Questionnaire, and the Toronto Aortic Stenosis 
Quality of Life Questionnaire (TASQ).
KEY MESSAGES: There is no standardized assessment of QoL in patients with AS. 
Many different questionaires are being used, but they are rarely specific for 
AS. There is a need for AS specific research into the QoL of patients as life 
prolongation may compete for an improved QoL in this elderly patient group.

Anaplastic Astrocytoma (AA) is a relatively rare cancer, and is associated with 
a median life expectancy of 3 years after conventional therapy. Complete cure of 
the highly infiltrative AA is uncommon, and reports of positive outcome in cases 
of partial resection of AA are rare. Further, integrative approaches to the 
management of AA remain underexplored. This paper contributes to the limited 
literature in this domain by presenting a case that was successfully treated 
through integrative conventional and Ayurvedic interventions. A patient 
diagnosed with AA in the left parieto-occipital lobe underwent partial lesion 
resection followed by post-operative radiation and chemotherapy. The patient was 
given a conservative post-surgical life expectancy of two years, and was 
referred to an Ayurveda hospital for further treatment. The Ayurvedic 
intervention was focussed on redressal of radiation and chemotherapy 
side-effects, improvement of quality of life, and improving the patient's 
strength and immunity. Following this novel integrative model of care, the 
patient was able to resume all personal and professional routines, and a 
contrast MRI revealed absence of residual lesion allowing the patient to outlive 
his initial prognosis by several years till date. We posit that the findings of 
this report merit further examination in the interest of potential improvements 
to existing models of care.

BACKGROUND: Neurotransmitter release depends on the fusion of synaptic vesicles 
with the presynaptic membrane and is mainly mediated by SNARE complex assembly. 
During the transition of Munc18-1/Syntaxin-1 to the SNARE complex, the opening 
of the Syntaxin-1 linker region catalyzed by Munc13-1 leads to the extension of 
the domain 3a hinge loop, which enables domain 3a to bind SNARE motifs in 
Synaptobrevin-2 and Syntaxin-1 and template the SNARE complex assembly. However, 
the exact mechanism of domain 3a extension remains elusive.
RESULTS: Here, we characterized residues on the domain 3a hinge loop that are 
crucial for the extension of domain 3a by using biophysical and biochemical 
approaches and electrophysiological recordings. We showed that the mutation of 
residues T323/M324/R325 disrupted Munc13-1-mediated SNARE complex assembly and 
membrane fusion starting from Munc18-1/Syntaxin-1 in vitro and caused severe 
defects in the synaptic exocytosis of mouse cortex neurons in vivo. Moreover, 
the mutation had no effect on the binding of Synaptobrevin-2 to isolated 
Munc18-1 or the conformational change of the Syntaxin-1 linker region catalyzed 
by the Munc13-1 MUN domain. However, the extension of the domain 3a hinge loop 
in Munc18-1/Syntaxin-1 was completely disrupted by the mutation, leading to the 
failure of Synaptobrevin-2 binding to Munc18-1/Syntaxin-1.
CONCLUSIONS: Together with previous results, our data further support the model 
that the template function of Munc18-1 in SNARE complex assembly requires the 
extension of domain 3a, and particular residues in the domain 3a hinge loop are 
crucial for the autoinhibitory release of domain 3a after the MUN domain opens 
the Syntaxin-1 linker region.

BACKGROUND: Healthcare coordination and continuity of care conceptualize all 
care providers and organizations involved in health care to ensure the right 
care at the right time. However, systematic evidence synthesis is lacking in the 
care coordination of health services. This scoping review synthesizes evidence 
on different levels of care coordination of primary health care (PHC) and 
primary care.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of published evidence on healthcare 
coordination. PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Web of Science 
and Google Scholar were searched until 30 November 2022 for studies that 
describe care coordination/continuity of care in PHC and primary care. We 
followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to select studies. We 
analysed data using a thematic analysis approach and explained themes adopting a 
multilevel (individual, organizational, and system) analytical framework.
RESULTS: A total of 56 studies were included in the review. Most studies were 
from upper-middle-income or high-income countries, primarily focusing on 
continuity/care coordination in primary care. Ten themes were identified in care 
coordination in PHC/primary care. Four themes under care coordination at the 
individual level were the continuity of services, linkage at different stages of 
health conditions (from health promotion to rehabilitation), health care from a 
life-course (conception to elderly), and care coordination of health services at 
places (family to hospitals). Five themes under organizational level care 
coordination included interprofessional, multidisciplinary services, community 
collaboration, integrated care, and information in care coordination. Finally, a 
theme under system-level care coordination was related to service management 
involving multisectoral coordination within and beyond health systems.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuity and coordination of care involve healthcare provisions 
from family to health facility throughout the life-course to provide a range of 
services. Several issues could influence multilevel care coordination, including 
at the individual (services or users), organizational (providers), and system 
(departments and sectors) levels. Health systems should focus on care 
coordination, ensuring types of care per the healthcare needs at different 
stages of health conditions by a multidisciplinary team. Coordinating multiple 
technical and supporting stakeholders and sectors within and beyond health 
sector is also vital for the continuity of care especially in resource-limited 
health systems and settings.

With the improvement of treatment options, multiple myeloma related life 
expectancy has been prolonged, but the disease remains largely incurable. 
Immunotherapy is a growing field that shows promise in advancements for 
treatment, and recent work has demonstrated an opportunity to use immune 
receptor, complementarity determining region-3 (CDR3)-candidate antigen chemical 
complementarity scores to identify survival distinctions among subgroups of 
patients. Here, we have applied the complementarity scoring algorithm to 
identify multiple myeloma related, CDR3-cancer testis antigen (CTA) 
relationships associated with survival distinctions. Furthermore, we have 
overlapped these immune receptor features with a previous study that showed a 
dramatic survival distinction based on T-cell receptor, V- and J-gene segment 
usage, HLA allele combinations, whereby 100% of the patients in certain 
combination groups had no mortality related to multiple myeloma, during the 
study period. This overlap evaluation was consistent with the idea that there 
are likely considerable constraints on productive TRB-antigen-HLA combinations 
but more flexibility, and unpredictability, for the TRA-antigen-HLA 
combinations. Also, the approaches in this reported indicated the potential 
importance of the CTA, IGSF11, as a multiple myeloma antigen, an antigen 
previously, independently considered as a vaccine candidate in other settings.

The full-field stimulus threshold (FST) is a psychophysical measure of 
whole-field retinal light sensitivity. It can assess residual visual function in 
patients with severe retinal disease and is increasingly being adopted as an 
endpoint in clinical trials. FST applications in routine ophthalmology clinics 
are also growing, but as yet there is no formalised standard guidance for 
measuring FST. This scoping review explored current variability in FST conduct 
and reporting, with an aim to inform further evidence synthesis and consensus 
guidance. A comprehensive electronic search and review of the literature was 
carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. Key 
source, participant, methodology and outcomes data from 85 included sources were 
qualitatively and quantitatively compared and summarised. Data from 85 sources 
highlight how the variability and insufficient reporting of FST methodology, 
including parameters such as units of flash luminance, colour, duration, test 
strategy and dark adaptation, can hinder comparison and interpretation of 
clinical significance across centres. The review also highlights an unmet need 
for paediatric-specific considerations for test optimisation. Further evidence 
synthesis, empirical research or structured panel consultation may be required 
to establish coherent standardised guidance on FST methodology and context or 
condition dependent modifications. Consistent reporting of core elements, most 
crucially the flash luminance equivalence to 0 dB reference level is a first 
step. The development of criteria for quality assurance, calibration and 
age-appropriate reference data generation may further strengthen rigour of 
measurement.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the world's most unknown and deadly 
cancers. This study aimed to provide updated epidemiological indicators and the 
recent trend of EC by age group, gender, and geographical region in the world.
METHODS: Annual case data and age-standardized rates (ASRs) of epidemiological 
indicators of EC were collected from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
study from 1990 to 2019 in 204 countries and territories based on the 
sociodemographic index (SDI). Relative difference (%), average annual percentage 
change (AAPC), and the male/female ratio were calculated. Data are reported in 
values and 95% confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: EC age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) decreased by 19%, 
age-standardized death rates (ASDR) decreased by 25%, and disability-adjusted 
life-years ASR (DALYs ASR) decreased by 30% from 1990 to 2019. The higher number 
of EC cases was in men aged 50 to 69 years and in women aged over 70. From 1990 
to 2019, Middle SDI countries experienced a decline in the ASIR and ASDR of EC. 
The High SDI countries had an increasing ASDR trend. In World Bank High-Income 
countries, the ASIR of EC has remained unchanged and decreased in other regions. 
The Asia continent has the highest rate of incidence, mortality, and burden of 
EC and the highest rate of reduction. East Asia, Southern Sub-Saharan Africa, 
and Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa respectively have the highest ASIR of EC. Central 
Asia has experienced the greatest decrease in the ASIR and ASDR of EC, the 
countries of Central Europe had a steady ASIR and High-Income North America had 
an increasing trend in ASIR and ASDR. The burden of EC shows a decreasing trend 
worldwide. Central and East Asia regions have the highest rate and the highest 
increase in the burden of EC.
CONCLUSION: Based on great variation in the geographical distribution of 
epidemiological indicators of EC, investigating the reasons for this diversity 
requires more studies to be conducted in the field of prevention, distribution 
of risk factors, and implementation of screening methods with high 
cost-effectiveness, and access to treatment methods. The provision of regional 
solutions may be more effective than global strategies.

AIM: To address the need for additional education in the management of mental 
illness in the critical care setting by providing a broad overview of the 
interrelationship between critical illness and mental illness. The paper also 
offers practical advice to support critical care staff in managing patients with 
mental illness in critical care by discussing two hypothetical case scenarios 
involving aggressive and disorganised behaviour. People living with mental 
illness are over-represented among critically unwell patients and experience 
worse outcomes, contributing to a life expectancy up to 30 years shorter than 
their peers. Strategic documents call for these inequitable outcomes to be 
addressed. Staff working in intensive care units (ICUs) possess advanced 
knowledge and specialist skills in managing critical illness but have reported 
limited confidence in managing patients with comorbid mental illness.
DESIGN & METHODS: A discursive paper, drawing on clinical experience and 
research of the authors and current literature.
RESULTS: Like all people, patients with mental illnesses draw on their 
cognitive, behavioural, social and spiritual resources to cope with their 
experiences during critical illness. However, they may have fewer resources 
available due to co-morbid mental illness, a history of trauma and social 
disadvantage. By identifying and sensitively addressing patients' underlying 
needs in a trauma-informed way, demonstrating respect and maximising patient 
autonomy, staff can reduce distress and disruptive behaviours and promote 
recovery. Caring for patients who are distressed and/or display challenging 
behaviours can evoke strong and unpleasant emotional responses. Self-care is 
fundamental to maintaining a compassionate approach and effective clinical 
judgement. Staff should be enabled to accept and acknowledge emotional responses 
and access support-informally with peers and/or through formal mechanisms as 
needed. Organisational leadership and endorsement of the principles of equitable 
care are critical to creation of the environment needed to improve outcomes for 
staff and patients.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: ICU nurses hold an important role in the care of 
patients with critical illnesses and are ideally placed to empower, advocate for 
and comfort those patients also living with mental illness. To perform these 
tasks optimally and sustainably, health services have a responsibility to 
provide nursing staff with adequate education and training in the management of 
mental illnesses, and sufficient formal and informal support to maintain their 
own well-being while providing this care.
PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT: This paper is grounded in accounts of patients 
with mental illness and clinicians providing care to patients with mental 
illness in critical care settings but there was no direct patient or public 
contribution.

The population of patients with a systemic right ventricle (sRV) in 
biventricular circulation includes those who have undergone an atrial switch 
operation for destro-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) and those with 
congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA). Despite the 
life expectancy of these patients is significantly increased, the long-term 
prognosis remains suboptimal due to late complications such as heart failure, 
arrhythmias, and premature death. These patients, therefore, need a close 
follow-up to early identify predictive factors of adverse outcomes and to 
implement all preventive therapeutic strategies. This review analyzes the late 
complications of adult patients with an sRV and TGA and clarifies which are risk 
factors for adverse prognosis and which are the therapeutic strategies that 
improve the long-term outcomes. For prognostic purposes, it is necessary to 
monitor sRV size and function, the tricuspid valve regurgitation, the functional 
class, the occurrence of syncope, the QRS duration, N-terminal pro B-type 
natriuretic peptide levels, and the development of arrhythmias. Furthermore, 
pregnancy should be discouraged in women with risk factors. Tricuspid valve 
replacement/repair, biventricular pacing, and implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator are the most important therapeutic strategies that have been 
shown, when used correctly, to improve long-term outcomes.

The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has changed the treatment 
paradigm of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), leading to a dramatic improvement of 
the outcome of CML patients, who now have a nearly normal life expectancy and, 
in some selected cases, the possibility of aiming for the more ambitious goal of 
treatment-free remission (TFR). However, the minority of patients who fail 
treatment and progress from chronic phase (CP) to accelerated phase (AP) and 
blast phase (BP) still have a relatively poor prognosis. The identification of 
predictive elements enabling a prompt recognition of patients at higher risk of 
progression still remains among the priorities in the field of CML management. 
Currently, the baseline risk is assessed using simple clinical and hematologic 
parameters, other than evaluating the presence of additional chromosomal 
abnormalities (ACAs), especially those at "high-risk". Beyond the onset, a 
re-evaluation of the risk status is mandatory, monitoring the response to TKI 
treatment. Moreover, novel critical insights are emerging into the role of 
genomic factors, present at diagnosis or evolving on therapy. This review 
presents the current knowledge regarding prognostic factors in CML and their 
potential role for an improved risk classification and a subsequent enhancement 
of therapeutic decisions and disease management.

In the complex context of French Guiana, different vulnerabilities and different 
risk factors between genders may lead to complex differences in health outcomes, 
mortality, and life expectancy. Our aim was, thus, to compare male and female 
mortality and life expectancy, to compare it between French Guiana and mainland 
France, and to look at temporal trends and the main specific causes of death in 
order to identify actionable singularities. National databases were used to 
obtain life expectancy at birth, at 20, 40, and 60 years, and mortality 
statistics. Standardized death rates and causes of death for French Guiana and 
mainland France were obtained through the CEPIDC, which analyzes information 
from death certificates. When comparing with mainland France, life expectancy at 
birth was significantly shorter both in males and females (mean = -2.9 years); 
life expectancy at 20 years, which allows to remove the effect of the greater 
child mortality in French Guiana, was also shorter in French Guiana for males 
(mean = -1.8 years) and females (mean = -2 years). The differences between 
mainland France and French Guiana regarding life expectancy at 40 and 60 years 
(mean = -1.5 and -1.3 years) was mainly found among females, males in French 
Guiana life expectancy at 40 and 60 years was closer to that in mainland France 
(mean = -0.8 and -0.6 years). Although they have a greater life expectancy at 
birth than men, women in French Guiana are substantially more affected by 
overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes. The observed patterns of life expectancy 
at different ages presumably reflect the burden of external causes and AIDS in 
males and perhaps metabolic diseases in women.

OBJECTIVE: For many years, outcomes such as mortality and morbidity were the 
standard for evaluating oncological treatment effectiveness. With the 
introduction of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), the focus shifted 
from a mere extension of a patient's life or release from disease to the 
improvement of a multilayered concept of health, decisively affecting life 
satisfaction. In this study, we deal with the topic of PROMs in liver and 
gastrointestinal randomized controlled trials.
RESULTS: The final database included 43 papers reporting results of randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) for liver or gastrointestinal cancer interventions 
where one of the primary or secondary outcomes was a health-related quality of 
life measure. The most often used PROM was the European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) 
for both liver cancer and gastrointestinal cancer (in 62% of gastrointestinal 
cancer studies and 57% of liver cancer studies). For the gastrointestinal cancer 
group, the QLQ-STO22, a cancer-specific extension of the QLQ-C30, was the second 
most commonly used PROM. In liver cancer, the generic PROM Short Form 36 and the 
EORTC QLQ-HCC18, a cancer-specific extension of the QLQ-C30, were the second 
most commonly used PROMs.
CONCLUSION: We found that RCTs often do not include comprehensive 
quality-of-life measures. When quality of life is part of an RCT, it is often 
only a secondary outcome. For a holistic view of the patient, a stronger 
integration and weighting of patient-reported outcomes in RCTs would be 
desirable.

With the increasing life expectancy and ageing population, long-term care has 
become an urgent policy issue worldwide. The informal care provided by family 
members, particularly adult children, is a key aspect of long-term care. 
However, socioeconomic transformations have resulted in changing family and 
demographic structures and increased geographic mobility, reducing the capacity 
of families to provide informal care and meet the caregiving needs of older 
adults. For ageing families, care preparation can be an effective method for 
coping with eldercare challenges, and care preparation is attracting increasing 
attention from researchers. This study seeks to conduct a systematic review for 
studies on caregiving preparation by adult children that were retrieved from six 
databases, to synthesise the available evidence, and to identify knowledge gaps 
and opportunities for future investigations. The characteristics and main themes 
of eighteen reviewed articles were identified and analysed. This study discussed 
various conceptualisations of caregiving preparation by adult children, the 
prevalence of caregiving preparation, the factors related to caregiving 
preparation, and the related consequences. On the basis of the systematic review 
findings, several limitations of the literature and directions for future 
research were proposed to promote care preparedness and the well-being of ageing 
families.

The gaseous reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) generated by cold 
atmospheric plasma (CAP) can effectively inactivate Aspergillus flavus (A. 
flavus) and prolong the shelf-life of food. Plasma-activated water (PAW) is the 
extension of cold plasma sterilization technology. Without the limitation of a 
plasma device, PAW can be applied to more scenarios of food decontamination. 
However, the efficacy of PAW as a carrier of RONS for eradicating A. flavus or 
inhibiting its growth remains unclear. In this study, the immediate fungicidal 
effect and long-term inhibitory effect of PAW on A. flavus were investigated. 
The results demonstrated that 60-min instant-prepared PAW could achieve a 3.22 
log reduction CFU/mL of A. flavus and the fungicidal efficacy of PAW gradually 
declined with the extension of storage time. Peroxynitrite (ONOO-/ONOOH) played 
a crucial role in this inactivation process, which could damage the cell wall 
and membrane structure, disrupt intracellular redox homeostasis, and impair 
mitochondrial function, ultimately leading to fungal inactivation. In addition 
to the fungicidal effect, PAW also exhibited fungistatic properties and 
inhibited the synthesis of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in A. flavus. By analyzing the 
cellular antioxidant capacity, energy metabolism, and key gene expression in the 
AFB1 synthesis pathway, it was discovered that PAW can significantly reduce ATP 
levels, while increasing SOD and CAT activity during 5-d cultivation. Meanwhile, 
PAW effectively suppressed the expression of genes related to AFB1 synthesis.

Fresh fruits and vegetables are important sources of minerals, vitamins, fibers, 
and antioxidants, essential for human well-being. However, some fruits and 
vegetables are highly perishable with a very short shelf life during storage. 
Serious consumer concern over the use of chemical preservatives for this purpose 
has led to a green revolution and a sustainable era where the design and 
fabrication of edible coatings have attracted considerable interest. In recent 
years, scientific communities have paid great attention to the development of 
bio-based edible coatings to extend the postharvest shelf life of fruits and 
vegetables. Furthermore, nanotechnology has been distinguished as a great 
strategy for improving coating properties, including a better water barrier and 
better mechanical, optical, and microstructural properties, as well as gradual 
and controlled release of bioactive compounds. In this work, patent articles on 
plant-based nano-emulsions as edible coatings in the extension of fruit and 
vegetable shelf life were reviewed. The Patentscope search service and Espacenet 
portal were used, applying a query strategy composed of mesh terms and inclusion 
criteria. Through database searching, a total of 16 patent documents met the 
inclusion criteria. Further, to demonstrate the innovation trends in this topic, 
all relevant patents are described at the end of the study, along with the 
components, technology, application, and advantages of developed preparations.
