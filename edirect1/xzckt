USA.

Pain and symptom management is a cornerstone of palliative and hospice medicine. 
The aim of this article is to educate clinicians about the uncommon causes of 
bleeding from an epidural catheter for hospice pain management. A case of a 
12-year-old female with progressive metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma-left forearm 
primary who had exhausted all treatment options is reported. She had a very 
significant cancer-related pain, which was not amenable to hospice management at 
home. A tunneled epidural catheter was placed so that she could receive better 
pain management at home as her life expectancy was very short. The patient had 
massive bleeding coming from the tunnel site developing big clots around 
dressings on the third day after the catheter placement. All methods for 
stopping the bleeding were employed but it stopped only after the epidural 
catheter was removed. In conclusion, the development of pain management strategy 
using multidisciplinary inputs with appropriate, timely use of interventional 
pain management techniques provides satisfactory pain relief for these patients 
and reduces distress in patients and relatives during this difficult period. 
Multiple approaches exist for pain management; however, systemic medications 
sometimes cause additional side effects (nausea, vomiting, constipation, 
drowsiness, respiratory depression). Unfortunately, some interventional 
procedures may also have side effects (bleeding, infection, ineffectiveness).

Mega aorta syndrome (MAS) poses a complex clinical challenge: the involvement of 
the ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending thoracic and abdominal aorta with 
extension below the origin of renal arteries requires almost total replacement 
of the aorta. The modality of treatment remains still controversial. Different 
aortic debranching techniques have been developed to re-route the origin of 
epiaortic and visceral vessels and achieve an optimal landing zone for 
implantation of subsequent endovascular grafts. We illustrate the Lupiae 
technique as a further evolution of the aortic debranching and hybrid repair of 
a mega aorta. It was developed with the purpose to exclude a very long segment 
of diseased aorta by implanting two or more endoprostheses between two 
surgically-generated landing zones. We describe a series of 27 patients treated 
by this hybrid three-stage mega-aorta repair; the tips and tricks discussed here 
facilitate a safe and effective procedure, enable treatment of frail patients 
and help to avoid life-threatening complications.

Lyon, France.

Social inequalities in cancer are increasingly relevant to research, 
implementation science, and policy. In this brief perspective we provide an 
overview of global cancer inequalities by assessing different outcomes according 
to the Human Development Index (HDI); the HDI is a United Nations Development 
Programme composite indicator including the following measures: (i) access to 
education (based on mean and expected years of schooling), (ii) a long and 
healthy life (based on life expectancy), and (iii) a decent standard of living 
(based on gross national income per capita). We additionally touch upon the 
importance of prevention, access to oncological services, and the need to 
monitor progress in reducing and avoiding inequalities at subnational, national, 
world region, and global levels.

OBJECTIVE: Long-term aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy is expected to improve the 
health outcomes with high health resource consumption in early breast cancer. 
The aim of the study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of letrozole for 
postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive early breast cancer in a 
health resource-limited setting.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to project the lifetime outcomes based on 
the clinical course of early breast cancer. The clinical and utility data were 
derived from reported results. Costs were estimated from the perspective of 
Chinese health care. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and incremental 
cost-effective ratio (ICER) were measured. Probabilistic sensitivity and one-way 
analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Compared to 5 years of tamoxifen therapy, 5 years of AI treatment with 
letrozole improved the QALYs (10.44 versus 10.84) and increased the lifetime 
costs (CNY ¥13,613 versus CNY ¥28,797), resulting in an ICER of CNY ¥38,092 
/QALY. The ICER of 5 years of letrozole versus 2-3 years of tamoxifen and then 
letrozole was CNY ¥68,233 /QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed that the age of 
initiating adjuvant endocrine therapy was the most influential parameter.
CONCLUSIONS: In health resource-limited settings, adjuvant endocrine therapy 
with letrozole is a cost-effective strategy compared to tamoxifen in women with 
early breast cancer.

High-grade glioma (HGG) is a lethal cancer with poor outcome. Accurate 
preoperative overall survival (OS) time prediction for HGG patients is crucial 
for treatment planning. Traditional presurgical and noninvasive OS prediction 
studies have used radiomics features at the local lesion area based on the 
magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, the highly complex lesion MRI 
appearance may have large individual variability, which could impede accurate 
individualized OS prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel concept, namely 
brain connectomics-based OS prediction. It is based on presurgical resting-state 
functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and the non-local, large-scale brain functional 
networks where the global and systemic prognostic features rather than the local 
lesion appearance are used to predict OS. We propose that the connectomics 
features could capture tumor-induced network-level alterations that are 
associated with prognosis. We construct both low-order (by means of sparse 
representation with regional rs-fMRI signals) and high-order functional 
connectivity (FC) networks (characterizing more complex multi-regional 
relationship by synchronized dynamics FC time courses). Then, we conduct a 
graph-theoretic analysis on both networks for a jointly, machine-learning-based 
individualized OS prediction. Based on a preliminary dataset (N = 34 with bad 
OS, mean OS, ~400 days; N = 34 with good OS, mean OS, ~1030 days), we achieve a 
promising OS prediction accuracy (86.8%) on separating the individuals with bad 
OS from those with good OS. However, if using only conventionally derived 
descriptive features (e.g., age and tumor characteristics), the accuracy is low 
(63.2%). Our study highlights the importance of the rs-fMRI and brain functional 
connectomics for treatment planning.

PURPOSE: The multidisciplinary Risk Assessment and Management Program for 
patients with diabetes mellitus (RAMP-DM) was found to be cost-saving in 
comparison with usual primary care over 5 years' follow-up. This study aimed to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of RAMP-DM over lifetime.
METHODS: We built a Discrete Event Simulation model to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of RAMP-DM over lifespan from public health service 
provider's perspective. Transition probabilities among disease states were 
extrapolated from a cohort of 17,140 propensity score matched participants in 
RAMP-DM and those under usual primary care over 5-year's follow-up. The 
mortality of patients with specific DM-related complications was estimated from 
a cohort of 206,238 patients with diabetes. Health preference and direct medical 
costs of DM patients referred to our previous studies among Chinese DM patients.
RESULTS: RAMP-DM individuals gained 0.745 QALYs and cost US$1404 less than those 
under usual care. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that RAMP-DM had 
86.0% chance of being cost-saving compared to usual care under the assumptions 
and estimates used in the model. The probability of RAMP-DM being cost-effective 
compared to usual care would be over 99%, when the willingness to pay threshold 
is HK$20,000 (US$ 2564) or higher.
CONCLUSION: RAMP-DM added to usual primary care was cost-saving in managing 
people with diabetes over lifetime. These findings support the integration of 
RAMP-DM as part of routine primary care for all patients with diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Dual-chamber (DDD) pacing is the most widely utilised pacing 
modality in many parts of the world. The present study aimed to evaluate life 
expectancy of DDD pacemaker patients in comparison to the age- and sex-matched 
general population, assess changes in baseline characteristics over three 
decades of the inclusion period and determine the association between selected 
variables and patient survival.
METHODS: This longitudinal study of consecutive de novo DDD pacemaker 
implantations performed between 1984 and 2014, with all-cause mortality until 
2016 as the endpoint, was conducted at a singlecenter university hospital.
RESULTS: Under assessment were 3928 patients with a total of 30,087 
patient-years of survival time. Compared to the general population, the observed 
survival was significantly inferior until 12 years post DDD pacemaker implant 
(HR = 1.499, p < 0.001), whereas after 12 years of follow-up the observed 
survival was significantly superior (HR = 0.555, p < 0.001). A comparison of 
patient baseline characteristics over three decades revealed the following 
significant changes: more elderly patients, more female patients, less patients 
with atrioventricular block, more patients with atrial fibrillation/atrial 
flutter (AF/AFL) and fewer patients with an apical right ventricular (RV) lead 
position in the later decades. In multivariate analysis male sex and higher age 
were the only variables significantly associated with shorter survival time. 
Indication for pacing, history of pre-implant AF/AFL, RV lead position and 
device infection were not associated with survival.
CONCLUSIONS: In the very-long-term follow-up of DDD pacemaker patients, the 
parameters associated with survival were sex and baseline age at first 
implantation.

BACKGROUND: Neck pain is presented with a variety of symptoms. Pain drawings are 
used in the clinical assessment of people with neck pain. Pain extent based upon 
pain drawings can be associated with different factors. However, the relation 
between pain extent and function limitations in people with neck pain is 
unknown.
AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the associations between pain extent 
extracted from pain drawings, and self-reported neck pain related disability, 
quality of life, depression, self-reported neck function, cervical muscle 
function, and range of motion in a chronic neck pain population and possible 
differences depending on the onset of pain being traumatic or not.
DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Primary and secondary healthcare.
POPULATION: People with chronic neck pain (N.=200) of traumatic (N.=120) or 
non-traumatic (N.=80) origin.
METHODS: Outcome measures: Pain extent, Short Form 36 Health Survey Physical and 
Mental Component Summary (SF36-PCS/MCS), TAMPA Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), 
Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Neck Disability Index (NDI), 
Craniocervical Flexion Test (CCFT), Cervical Extension Test (CE), and Cervical 
Range of Motion (ROM). Correlations were calculated using Spearman or Pearson 
correlation coefficients. Correlation between pain extent and outcomes were 
calculated for all participants collectively and then separately for those with 
a traumatic versus non-traumatic neck pain.
RESULTS: Overall, significant positive correlations were observed between pain 
extent and NDI (r=0.33; P<0.001), BDI-II (r=0.29; P<0.001), CCFT (r=-0.24; 
P=0.001) and CE (r=-0.19; P=0.006). No difference was observed in pain extent 
between patients with traumatic (mean: 7.6±6.7%) and non-traumatic onset 
(7.4±6.8%). Pain extent correlated moderately with NDI, BDI-II, TSK, CCFT and CE 
in those with non-traumatic onset, but weakly with NDI, BDI-II, CCFT and CE in 
those with trauma-induced chronic neck pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Pain extent is correlated with patient-reported neck function, 
depression and muscle test performance in people with chronic neck pain. These 
correlations were strongest in those with non-traumatic neck pain.
CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Patients presenting with larger pain areas show 
poorer psychological and physical function. Pain drawings can therefore indicate 
a need for addressing these functions in management of a person with chronic 
neck pain.

Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been linked to a variety of 
metabolic, neurological and muscular diseases which can present at any time 
throughout life. MtDNA is replicated by DNA polymerase gamma (Pol γ), twinkle 
helicase and mitochondrial single-stranded binding protein (mtSSB). The Pol γ 
holoenzyme is a heterotrimer consisting of the p140 catalytic subunit and a p55 
homodimeric accessory subunit encoded by the nuclear genes POLG and POLG2, 
respectively. The accessory subunits enhance DNA binding and promote processive 
DNA synthesis of the holoenzyme. Mutations in either POLG or POLG2 are linked to 
disease and adversely affect maintenance of the mitochondrial genome, resulting 
in depletion, deletions and/or point mutations in mtDNA. A homozygous mutation 
located at Chr17: 62492543G>A in POLG2, resulting in R182W substitution in p55, 
was previously identified to cause mtDNA depletion and fatal hepatic liver 
failure. Here we characterize this homozygous R182W p55 mutation using in vivo 
cultured cell models and in vitro biochemical assessments. Compared to control 
fibroblasts, homozygous R182W p55 primary dermal fibroblasts exhibit a two-fold 
slower doubling time, reduced mtDNA copy number and reduced levels of POLG and 
POLG2 transcripts correlating with the reported disease state. Expression of 
R182W p55 in HEK293 cells impairs oxidative-phosphorylation. Biochemically, 
R182W p55 displays DNA binding and association with p140 similar to WT p55. 
R182W p55 mimics the ability of WT p55 to stimulate primer extension, support 
steady-state nucleotide incorporation, and suppress the exonuclease function of 
Pol γ in vitro. However, R182W p55 has severe defects in protein stability as 
determined by differential scanning fluorimetry and in stimulating function as 
determined by thermal inactivation. These data demonstrate that the Chr17: 
62492543G>A mutation in POLG2, R182W p55, severely impairs stability of the 
accessory subunit and is the likely cause of the disease phenotype.

REVIEW ON BONE DISEASE (OSTEOPOROSIS) IN DIABETES MELLITUS.

El-Tawdy AHF, Ibrahim EAH, Al Sakhawy EMA, Morsy TA.

Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease known, affecting an estimated 200 
million people worldwide. Approximately 30% of all postmenopausal women are 
affected and up to 40% developed a fragility fracture within their lifetime. 
Over time, a number of risk factors have been associated with osteoporosis and 
are useful when used in screening tools and treatment algorithms. Diabetes, 
although identified more than half a century ago as being associated with bone 
frailty, has come to the forefront only within last decade as an important 
osteoporosis risk factor. While both type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) diabetes 
increased fracture risk, the link is far more profound with DM1. DM1 accounts 
for approximately 5% of all cases of diabetes in the USA and is associated with 
a 6.4-6.9-fold increase in the relative risk of hip fracture compared to 
individuals without diabetes. As life expectancy continues to increase for those 
living with DM1, an increase in number of fractures occurring in this population 
is expected in the future. For understanding of bone fragility in DM1 calls for 
an update of diabetes guidelines, better screening tools, and more research into 
the use of therapeutic strategies in these patients.

BACKGROUND: In Poland average life expectancy extends, while the number of the 
elderly who are active in the labor market decreases
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 429 people aged 50–70 
years old living in the community of south-eastern Poland. The respondents were 
divided into 2 study groups: group I – late middle age (50–60 years old) and 
group II – early old age (61–70 years old). With the use of questionnaires they 
were given, we obtained their socio-demographic data, assessed their cognitive 
and emotional state, as their physical activity levels. We used the Tinetti test 
to assess their gait and balance.
RESULTS: We did not find statistically significant difference in cognitive 
functioning between the studied groups (p = 0.109). Moreover, there was no 
significant relationship between belonging to an age group and suffering from 
depression (p = 0.06) as well as no major differences were observed in the 
general level of physical activity in relation to age (p = 0.112). Our study 
found that most of our subjects, regardless of gender, declared their 
willingness to continue professional work after reaching retirement age.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of own research did not show significant differences in 
psychophysical state between people in late middle age and at the beginning of 
old age. Most of the researched participants declared their willingness to 
continue professional work. Due to changing demographic conditions, it is 
becoming an important issue to maintain the highest possible level of 
professional activity of older people in the labor market in Poland. Med Pr

OBJECTIVES: Renal transplantation procedure markedly increased over the past few 
decades. The risk of harboring parasitic diseases may affect transplant 
recipients during life expectancy. We aimed in this study to determine the 
enteroparasitosis frequency among renal transplant recipients in Khartoum state, 
Sudan. A case-control hospital-based study performed between November 2012 and 
May 2013, on 300 renal transplant recipients attending Sudanese Kidney 
Association hospital in Khartoum state, Sudan, along with 300 normal healthy 
individuals matching the case in age and sex. Stool samples were collected for 
parasitological studies.
RESULTS: Out of the 300 renal transplant recipients: 242 (80.7%) were males mean 
age 43 ± 11.28 and 58 (19.3%) were females mean age 41 ± 13.41. Intestinal 
parasitic infection was observed in 118 participants and the overall frequency 
was 19.7%; of which 64 were cases (21.3%) and 54 (18.0%) were controls. Eight 
different species of intestinal parasites were identified; Entamoeba 
histolytica/dispar (7.5%), Entamoeba coli (6.5%), Giardia lambelia (3.2%), 
Cryptosporidium parvum (1.2%), Ascaris lumbricoides (0.6%), Enterobius 
vermicularis (0.3%), (0.2%) for each of Strongyloides stercoralis and 
Hymenolepis nana.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and fatal motor neuron 
disease. Diagnosis typically occurs in the fifth decade of life and the disease 
progresses rapidly leading to death within ~ 2-5 years of symptomatic onset. 
There is no cure, and the few available treatments offer only a modest extension 
in patient survival. A protein central to ALS is the nuclear RNA/DNA-binding 
protein, TDP-43. In > 95% of ALS patients, TDP-43 is cleared from the nucleus 
and forms phosphorylated protein aggregates in the cytoplasm of affected neurons 
and glia. We recently defined that poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) activity regulates 
TDP-43-associated toxicity. PAR is a posttranslational modification that is 
attached to target proteins by PAR polymerases (PARPs). PARP-1 and PARP-2 are 
the major enzymes that are active in the nucleus. Here, we uncovered that the 
motor neurons of the ALS spinal cord were associated with elevated nuclear PAR, 
suggesting elevated PARP activity. Veliparib, a small-molecule inhibitor of 
nuclear PARP-1/2, mitigated the formation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates in 
mammalian cells. In primary spinal-cord cultures from rat, Veliparib also 
inhibited TDP-43-associated neuronal death. These studies uncover that PAR 
activity is misregulated in the ALS spinal cord, and a small-molecular inhibitor 
of PARP-1/2 activity may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of ALS and 
related disorders associated with abnormal TDP-43 homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: There is evidence for the cost-effectiveness of health visitor (HV) 
training to assess postnatal depression (PND) and deliver psychological 
approaches to women at risk of depression. Whether this approach is 
cost-effective for lower-risk women is unknown. There is a need to know the cost 
of HV-delivered universal provision, and how much it might cost to improve 
health-related quality of life for postnatal women. A sub-study of a 
cluster-randomised controlled trial in the former Trent region (England) 
previously investigated the effectiveness of PoNDER HV training in mothers at 
lower risk of PND. We conducted a parallel cost-effectiveness analysis at 
6-months postnatal for all mothers with lower-risk status attributed to an 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score &lt;12 at 6-weeks postnatal.
METHODS: Intervention HVs were trained in assessment and cognitive behavioural 
or person-centred psychological support techniques to prevent depression. 
Outcomes examined: quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains over the period 
between 6 weeks and 6 months derived from SF-6D (from SF-36); risk-of-depression 
at 6 months (dichotomising 6-month EPDS scores into lower risk (&lt;12) and 
at-risk (⩾12).
RESULTS: In lower-risk women, 1474 intervention (63 clusters) and 767 control 
participants (37 clusters) had valid 6-week and 6-month EPDS scores. Costs and 
outcomes data were available for 1459 participants. 6-month adjusted costs were 
£82 lower in intervention than control groups, with 0.002 additional QALY 
gained. The probability of cost-effectiveness at £20 000 was very high (99%).
CONCLUSIONS: PoNDER HV training was highly cost-effective in preventing symptoms 
of PND in a population of lower-risk women and cost-reducing over 6 months.

Elevated expression of RNA binding protein HNRNPC has been reported in cancer 
cells, while the essentialness and functions of HNRNPC in tumors were not clear. 
We showed that repression of HNRNPC in the breast cancer cells MCF7 and T47D 
inhibited cell proliferation and tumor growth. Our computational inference of 
the key pathways and extensive experimental investigations revealed that the 
cascade of interferon responses mediated by RIG-I was responsible for such 
tumor-inhibitory effect. Interestingly, repression of HNRNPC resulted in 
accumulation of endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the binding ligand of 
RIG-I. These up-regulated dsRNA species were highly enriched by Alu sequences 
and mostly originated from pre-mRNA introns that harbor the known HNRNPC binding 
sites. Such source of dsRNA is different than the recently well-characterized 
endogenous retroviruses that encode dsRNA In summary, essentialness of HNRNPC in 
the breast cancer cells was attributed to its function in controlling the 
endogenous dsRNA and the down-stream interferon response. This is a novel 
extension from the previous understandings about HNRNPC in binding with introns 
and regulating RNA splicing.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the implementation of the 
Identification and Referral to Improve Safety (IRIS) programme using up-to-date 
real-world information on costs and effectiveness from routine clinical 
practice. A Markov model was constructed to estimate mean costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of IRIS versus usual care per woman 
registered at a general practice from a societal and health service perspective 
with a 10-year time horizon.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Cost-utility analysis in UK general practices, including 
data from six sites which have been running IRIS for at least 2 years across 
England.
PARTICIPANTS: Based on the Markov model, which uses health states to represent 
possible outcomes of the intervention, we stipulated a hypothetical cohort of 10 
000 women aged 16 years or older.
INTERVENTIONS: The IRIS trial was a randomised controlled trial that tested the 
effectiveness of a primary care training and support intervention to improve the 
response to women experiencing domestic violence and abuse, and found it to be 
cost-effective. As a result, the IRIS programme has been implemented across the 
UK, generating data on costs and effectiveness outside a trial context.
RESULTS: The IRIS programme saved £14 per woman aged 16 years or older 
registered in general practice (95% uncertainty interval -£151 to £37) and 
produced QALY gains of 0.001 per woman (95% uncertainty interval -0.005 to 
0.006). The incremental net monetary benefit was positive both from a societal 
and National Health Service perspective (£42 and £22, respectively) and the IRIS 
programme was cost-effective in 61% of simulations using real-life data when the 
cost-effectiveness threshold was £20 000 per QALY gained as advised by National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence.
CONCLUSION: The IRIS programme is likely to be cost-effective and cost-saving 
from a societal perspective in the UK and cost-effective from a health service 
perspective, although there is considerable uncertainty surrounding these 
results, reflected in the large uncertainty intervals.

When a medical provider(medical personnel)becomes a medical receiver(patient), 
does the consciousness about chemotherapy change ? If yes, what is the main 
reason ? In this study, we conducted a questionnaire on the consciousness of 
doctors and pharmacologists engaged in chemotherapy for gastric and/or 
colorectal cancer. The number of questionnaires collected was 83 and 92 for 
gastric and colorectal cancer, respectively. In adjuvant chemotherapy, 5%and 
4%do not want to receive any chemotherapy for gastric and colorectal cancer if 
they are patients. The main reasons are binding hours, side effects, and no wish 
for life extension. About 11%and 9%change their consciousness regarding 
chemotherapy according to whether they are care providers or receivers. The main 
reasons are medical perspective and their sense of duty. In chemotherapy for 
advanced cancer, 6% and 5% of gastric and colorectal cancer patients, do not 
want to receive any chemotherapy. The main reasons are low expectations for 
being cured, binding hours, and no wish for life extension. Further, 21%and 
14%wish to have limited chemotherapy. As regards consciousness on chemotherapy, 
26% and 18% reported changes according to whether they are providers or 
receivers. The main reasons are medical perspective and their sense of duty. As 
for the purpose of chemotherapy for advanced gastric and colorectal cancer, 96% 
and 43% answered prolonging life and relief, respectively. The proportion of 
persons who answered complete cure is statistically higher in 
colorectal(32%)than in gastric cancer(18%). The most common answer for an 
adverse event they want to avoid if they are patients is peripheral neuropathy. 
These results clearly demonstrate that a considerable proportion of medical 
personnel hold a negative attitude against or are reluctant to receiving 
chemotherapy, especially for advanced gastric and colorectal cancer. It is of 
great importance to make use of these results in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Demographic dynamics and decreasing trends in mortality from chronic 
diseases are major contributors to the phenomenon of population aging. The 
purpose of the present study was to examine the association between 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and demographic indicators, in Greece the 
past 60 years.
METHODS: Life Expectancy at birth (LE), population age structure, fertility 
rates (TFR) and all-cause, CVD mortality rates were retrieved (data provided by 
the Hellenic Statistical Authority, 1956-2015). In order to test the research 
hypothesis time-series analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: Increasing trends in LE and in the older age (>65 or >80 years) groups' 
share and declining trends in TFR were recorded. CVD mortality, after an upward 
course, showed decreasing trends during 1988-2009, accounting for the 96% and 
97% increment in LE in men and women respectively. However, newer records 
(2010-2015) show a new upward trend. The declining trends in TFR were highly 
associated with the shifts towards the upper part of the population age pyramid.
CONCLUSION: Population aging is a historically unprecedented event that cannot 
be avoided, deterred or alleviated. Its negative effects act cumulatively with 
the recent increases in cardiovascular mortality, especially in the light of the 
ongoing economic crisis which is expected to further exacerbate the existing 
contrasts. A possible way to successfully cope with the new demographic 
realities is to unlock an, up till now largely overlooked, opportunity named 
"healthy aging".

Background: In the recent decades, most studies have paid more attention to 
community expenditures in health sector and health outcomes. This study provides 
econometric evidence linking countries' health expenditures to 3 health 
outcomes: (1) infant mortality, (2) under 5 mortality and (3) life expectancy 
within 4 different health care systems. Methods: In this study, we used the 
econometric method to estimate the effect of health expenditure on health 
status. Panel data were collected and grouped for 25 countries according to the 
health care system over 15 years (2000-2015). The random effects model was 
selected over the fixed effects model based on the Hausman test to assess the 
effect of different factors on the 3 mentioned health outcomes. Results: A 
significant relationship was found between health expenditures and health 
indicators. The effect of private health expenditures on health outcomes in 
countries with mixed health financing system and traditional sickness fund 
insurance was higher than public expenditures. Also, after comparing the results 
between different health care systems, we found that the effect of health 
expenditure on the health outcome in countries with national health system (NHS) 
was more than other health care systems. Conclusion: To improve health status, 
health policymakers should focus on the factors that lie inside the health care 
system. Therefore, since private and public health expenditures have different 
effects on health outcomes in each health care system, countries should choose 
an optimal combination of private and public health expenditures.

Food shelf-life extension is important not only to food manufacturers, but also 
to home refrigeration/freezing appliance companies, whose products affect food 
quality and food waste. While freezing and refrigerating both extend the shelf 
life of foods, food quality deterioration continues regardless of the 
preservation method. This review article discusses the global fish market, the 
composition of fish meat, and the effects of freezing and thawing on salmon 
quality.

This study's purpose was to clarify the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis 
treatment. Denosumab treatment was cost-effective compared with alendronate 
treatment for elderly Japanese women at high risk of fragility fractures. 
Denosumab treatment might be cost-effective for patients with lower bone mineral 
density.
PURPOSE: In Japan's super-aged society, the prevention and treatment of 
osteoporosis are a critical issue with implications for the medical economy. 
This study's purpose was to clarify the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis 
treatment with denosumab versus weekly alendronate for elderly Japanese women at 
high risk of fragility fractures.
METHODS: A Markov model was used for simulation analysis. The modeled population 
was 75-year-old Japanese women with a bone mineral density (BMD) of 65% of the 
young adult mean (YAM) (T-score, - 2.87) and a history of previous vertebral 
body fracture. The simulation model was repeated until patient age reached 
100 years or death. Analysis was performed from the societal perspective. Costs 
and epidemiological data were derived from previous studies. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated from the simulation. We compared 
the ICER with willingness-to-pay. Additional analyses were performed with 
different combinations of age and BMD. Sensitivity analysis verified the 
robustness of the analysis.
RESULTS: For the modeled population, the ICER of denosumab versus alendronate 
treatment was estimated at US$40,241/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The ICER 
of denosumab for 80-year-old women whose BMD was 60% of YAM was estimated at 
US$22,469/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming willingness-to-pay as US$50,000/QALY, denosumab treatment 
for 75-year-old Japanese women with a BMD of 65% of YAM and a history of 
previous vertebral body fracture was cost-effective compared with alendronate 
treatment. Among over 75 years of age, denosumab treatment might be more 
cost-effective than alendronate for patients with a BMD of 65% of YAM or lower.
