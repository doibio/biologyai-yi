BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of the estimated 
11-25 years reduced life expectancy for persons with serious mental illness 
(SMI). This excess cardiovascular mortality is primarily attributable to 
obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. Obesity is associated with a 
sedentary lifestyle, limited physical activity and an unhealthy diet. Lifestyle 
interventions for persons with SMI seem promising in reducing weight and 
cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention among persons with SMI in an 
outpatient treatment setting.
METHODS: The Serious Mental Illness Lifestyle Evaluation (SMILE) study is a 
cluster-randomized controlled trial including an economic evaluation in 
approximately 18 Flexible Assertive Community Treatment (FACT) teams in the 
Netherlands. The intervention aims at a healthy diet and increased physical 
activity. Randomisation takes place at the level of participating FACT-teams. We 
aim to include 260 outpatients with SMI and a body mass index of 27 or higher 
who will either receive the lifestyle intervention or usual care. The 
intervention will last 12 months and consists of weekly 2-h group meetings 
delivered over the first 6 months. The next 6 months will include monthly group 
meetings, supplemented with regular individual contacts. Primary outcome is 
weight loss. Secondary outcomes are metabolic parameters (waist circumference, 
lipids, blood pressure, glucose), quality of life and health related 
self-efficacy. Costs will be measured from a societal perspective and include 
costs of the lifestyle program, health care utilization, medication and lost 
productivity. Measurements will be performed at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months.
DISCUSSION: The SMILE intervention for persons with SMI will provide important 
information on the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, feasibility and delivery 
of a group-based lifestyle intervention in a Dutch outpatient treatment setting.

BACKGROUND: Rural women experience health disparities in terms of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) risk compared to urban women. Cost-effective CVD-prevention 
programs are needed for this population. The objective of this study was to 
conduct cost analysis and cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of the Strong 
Hearts, Healthy Communities (SHHC) program compared to a control program in 
terms of change in CVD risk factors, including body weight and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs).
METHODS: Sixteen medically underserved rural towns in Montana and New York were 
randomly assigned to SHHC, a six-month twice-weekly experiential learning 
lifestyle program focused predominantly on diet and physical activity behaviors 
(n = 101), or a monthly healthy lifestyle education-only control program 
(n = 93). Females who were sedentary, overweight or obese, and aged 40 years or 
older were enrolled. The cost analysis calculated the total and per participant 
resource costs as well as participants' costs for the SHHC and control programs. 
In the intermediate health outcomes CEAs, the incremental costs were compared to 
the incremental changes in the outcomes. The QALY CEA compares the incremental 
costs and effectiveness of a national SHHC intervention for a hypothetical 
cohort of 2.2 million women compared to the status quo alternative.
RESULTS: The resource cost of SHHC was $775 per participant. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios from the payer's perspective was $360 per kg of weight 
loss. Over a 10-year time horizon, to avert per QALY lost SHHC is estimated to 
cost $238,271 from the societal perspective, but only $62,646 from the 
healthcare sector perspective. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses show 
considerable uncertainty in the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
CONCLUSIONS: A national SHHC intervention is likely to be cost-effective at 
willingness-to-pay thresholds based on guidelines for federal regulatory impact 
analysis, but may not be at commonly used lower threshold values. However, it is 
possible that program costs in rural areas are higher than previously studied 
programs in more urban areas, due to a lack of staff and physical activity 
resources as well as  availability for partnerships with existing organizations.

<sec id="st1"> <title>BACKGROUND</title> Detection of latent tuberculous 
infection (LTBI) is important to prevent progression to active tuberculosis 
(TB), particularly in migrant children. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
TB screening in migrant children in a low-incidence country. </sec> <sec 
id="st2"> <title>METHODS</title> Retrospective analysis of a school-based TB 
screening programme in Switzerland. Migrant children were screened using the 
tuberculin skin test (TST). TST was considered positive if induration was 10 mm 
in non-bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccinated children, and 15 mm in 
BCG-vaccinated children. Screening and treatment costs were extracted from 
hospital records. Cost impact was analysed as the difference between the cost of 
treatment for active TB and screening plus LTBI treatment. Cost per 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) was assessed based on Global Burden of 
Disease disability weight estimates. </sec> <sec id="st3"> 
<title>RESULTS</title> Of 1462 children screened, 1120 (77%; mean age 10.9 
years; 46% female) underwent a TST. TST induration of 10 mm was documented in 78 
(6.9%), and TST induration of 15 mm in 19 (1.6%). Twenty-one were TST-positive, 
and 17 children were diagnosed with LTBI; none had active TB. The highest rates 
of TST induration 10 mm were found in migrant children from Africa (16.6%) and 
Turkey (15.4%). Screening for LTBI was cost-effective if LTBI prevalence was 
14%, with a progression rate of 5%; in case of lower LTBI prevalence, LTBI 
screening is cost-effective if progression rates to active TB are higher. </sec> 
<sec id="st4"> <title>CONCLUSION</title> School-based TB screening programmes 
targeting migrant children are cost-effective if populations with a relatively

Comment in
    Eur Respir J. 2019 Aug 1;54(2):

The MIST2 (Second Multicentre Intrapleural Sepsis Trial) trial showed that 
combined intrapleural use of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and recombinant 
human DNase was effective when compared with single agents or placebo. However, 
the treatment costs are significant and overall cost-effectiveness of combined 
therapy remains unclear.An economic evaluation of the MIST2 trial was performed 
to assess the cost-effectiveness of combined therapy. Costs included were those 
related to study medications, initial hospital stay and subsequent 
hospitalisations. Outcomes were measured in terms of life-years gained. All 
costs were reported in euro and in 2016 prices.Mean annual costs were lowest in 
the t-PA-DNase group (EUR 10 605 for t-PA, EUR 17 856 for DNase, EUR 13 483 for 
placebo and EUR 7248 for t-PA-DNase; p=0.209). Mean 1-year life expectancy was 
0.988 for t-PA, 0.923 for DNase, and 0.969 for both placebo and t-PA-DNase 
(p=0.296). Both DNase and placebo were less effective, in terms of life-years 
gained, and more costly than t-PA. When placebo was compared with t-PA-DNase, 
the incremental cost per life-year gained of placebo was EUR 1.6 billion, with a 
probability of 0.85 of t-PA-DNase being cost-effective.This study demonstrates 
that combined t-PA-DNase is likely to be highly cost-effective. In light of this 
evidence, a definitive trial designed to facilitate a thorough economic 
evaluation is warranted to provide further evidence on the cost-effectiveness of 
this promising combined intervention.

PURPOSE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening in the 
National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP).
METHODS: Using a modified CISNET breast cancer simulation model, we estimated 
outcomes for women aged 40-64 years associated with three scenarios: breast 
cancer screening within the NBCCEDP, screening in the absence of the NBCCEDP (no 
program), and no screening through any program. We report screening outcomes, 
cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs), and sensitivity analyses results.
RESULTS: Compared with no program and no screening, the NBCCEDP lowers breast 
cancer mortality and improves QALYs, but raises health care costs. Base-case 
ICER for the program was $51,754/QALY versus no program and $50,223/QALY versus 
no screening. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis ICER for the program was 
$56,615/QALY [95% CI $24,069, $134,230/QALY] versus no program and $51,096/QALY 
gained [95% CI $26,423, $97,315/QALY] versus no screening.
CONCLUSIONS: On average, breast cancer screening in the NBCCEDP was 
cost-effective compared with no program or no screening.

Transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), a rare and progressive 
hereditary disorder, results from mutations in the gene coding for the 
transthyretin (TTR) protein that destabilize the protein's tetrameric structure. 
In over 40 countries worldwide, tafamidis (Vyndaqel®) is approved for the 
treatment of TTR amyloidosis in adults with stage 1 symptomatic polyneuropathy, 
to delay peripheral neurological impairment. Tafamidis is administered orally 
once daily, as a soft capsule. Evidence from clinical studies, including an 
18-month placebo-controlled trial and subsequent long-term, open-label extension 
studies (providing data from ≤ 6 years of treatment), indicate that tafamidis 
slowed deterioration of neurological function and maintained health-related 
quality of life in patients with early-stage ATTR-PN and the Val30Met mutation. 
TTR tetramers were stabilized in nearly all patients, and nutritional status was 
generally maintained or improved. Similar benefit was seen with tafamidis over 
12 months in a noncomparative trial in patients with non-Val30Met ATTR-PN, 
although disease progression in this population (which was older and had had 
ATTR-PN for longer than Val30Met patients) became more notable with continued 
therapy in an extension study. Data for up to 10 years from large registry and 
referral centre studies support the long-term effectiveness and safety of 
tafamidis in delaying disease progression and conferring survival benefits in 
patients with stage 1 ATTR-PN. Tafamidis was generally well tolerated, with no 
new safety signals detected during the long-term trial or real-world experience. 
Thus, based on up to 10 years' experience, tafamidis continues to be a valuable 
option in the treatment of early-stage ATTR-PN.

    Diabetes Ther. 2019 May 31;:

INTRODUCTION: Once-weekly semaglutide is a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
analog for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) that has been associated with 
greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight versus GLP-1 
receptor agonists dulaglutide, exenatide extended-release (ER), liraglutide and 
lixisenatide in the SUSTAIN trial program and a network meta-analysis (NMA). The 
aim of the present study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of 
semaglutide versus all available GLP-1 receptor agonists in Denmark, using a 
clinically orientated treatment approach.
METHODS: Outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE 
Diabetes Model. Baseline characteristics and treatment effects were sourced from 
the corresponding SUSTAIN trials and the NMA. Patients were assumed to initiate 
GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy and subsequently treatment-intensify according to 
clinical treatment guidelines, with addition of basal insulin and switching to 
basal-bolus insulin occurring when HbA1c exceeded recommended targets. Patients 
were assumed to receive a GLP-1 receptor agonist plus basal insulin therapy once 
HbA1c levels reached 7.5% and a basal-bolus insulin regimen once HbA1c exceeded 
8.0%. Costs were captured in 2017 Danish kroner (DKK), with future costs and 
outcomes discounted at 3% per annum.
RESULTS: Primary analyses indicated that semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg were 
associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.11 and 
0.34 quality-adjusted life years, respectively, versus dulaglutide, achieved at 
cost savings of DKK 289 and DKK 13,416, respectively. Supporting analyses 
indicated that both doses of semaglutide were either cost-effective or dominant 
versus exenatide ER, liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg and lixisenatide.
CONCLUSION: Semaglutide represents a cost-effective alternative to other GLP-1 
receptor agonist therapies available in Denmark, demonstrating clinical benefits 
versus dulaglutide, exenatide ER, liraglutide and lixisenatide for the treatment 
of patients with T2D.

In this article, we report analyses of the effects of fertility and mortality 
trends on the mutual exposure of grandparents and grandchildren and their 
consequences for multigenerational processes of social mobility in the United 
States from 1900 to 2010. Using historical vital statistics and stable 
population models, we report systematic analyses of grandparent-grandchild 
exposures from both prospective (grandparent) and retrospective (grandchild) 
perspectives. We also estimate exposure levels and trends specific to education 
levels of grandparents and grandchildren and decompose the overall trend into 
the effect of changing mortality, fertility level, and fertility timing. We show 
that changes in mutual exposure of grandparent and grandchild generations may 
have contributed to an increasing association between grandparents' and 
grandchildren's educational attainments.

OBJECTIVES: Alleviating racial/ethnic disparities in physical activity (PA) and 
health outcomes during childhood becomes an important public health priority as 
the nation's populace continues to diversify. Guided by expectancy-value model, 
the purposes of this study were (a) to examine the potential differences in 
expectancy-value beliefs, PA and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) between 
African-American (AA) children and their American-Caucasian (AC) peers, and (b) 
to determine how the relationships among these variables might differ between 
the two racial groups.
METHOD: Participants were 321 (152 boys; 189 AC) children from three schools who 
completed a previously validated questionnaire assessing their expectancy-value 
beliefs in physical education, leisure-time PA (PAQ-C), and HRQOL.
RESULTS: Students' PA was positively associated with HRQOL among AC and AA 
children (p < .01). AA children had significant higher expectancy-value beliefs 
but lower HRQOL than AC children. The regression results revealed that both 
racial groups had a nearly identical effect of expectancy beliefs on their 
self-reported PA (β = .34 in AA group, β = .33 in AC group, respectively). The 
regression analysis also suggests that expectancy-value belief was a significant 
predictor of HRQOL while controlling for all other variables (β = .36; p < .001) 
for the AC group, but not the AA group.
CONCLUSIONS: The growing health disparities across racial/ethnic subgroups are 
of great public health concern. Thus, this study provided valuable insights 
regarding how to promote AA children's PA and HRQOL through an expectancy-value 
approach.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common condition that causes 
significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy, and can have a serious 
economic impact. It is often underdiagnosed in primary care, partially due to 
the fact that the current National Institute for Health Care and 
Excellence-recommended ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) test for PAD in 
primary care is time-consuming and is technically challenging to perform. The 
availability of a simple, reliable diagnostic test has the potential to 
facilitate early PAD identification and treatment.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the preferences of primary care 
practitioners relating to the key characteristics for a new medical device for 
PAD detection.
PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 116 UK primary care setting clinicians involved in the 
diagnosis and/or management of PAD, comprising of doctors (n = 95), nurses 
(n = 17), health care assistants (n = 1) and other unspecified clinicians 
(n = 3).
OUTCOMES: Relative weights derived from a discrete choice experiment (DCE), by 
primary care practitioners regarding six key characteristics of the new device: 
device display, data integration, training, power supply, portability of the 
device, and cost.
RESULTS: Five characteristics were important for preferences. Practitioners 
favoured manual, as opposed to automated, integration of test results into 
patient records. Practitioners strongly preferred disposable batteries as the 
power supply for the device compared with other alternatives.
CONCLUSIONS: This novel study has successfully utilised a DCE to elicit primary 
care practitioner's preferences for the development of the new device. The

Since the introduction of suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV has 
become a chronic disease, with infected people in high-income countries 
approaching similar life expectancy to the general population. As this 
population ages, an increasing number of people with HIV are living with age-, 
treatment-, and disease-related comorbidities. Lifestyle factors such as 
smoking, alcohol abuse, and substance misuse have a role in age-related 
comorbidity. Some degree of immune dysfunction is suggested by the presence of 
markers of immune activation/inflammation despite effective suppression of HIV 
replication. Cumulative exposure to some antiretroviral drugs contributes to 
HIV-associated comorbidities, with risk increasing with age. Specifically, 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, and 
ritonavir-boosted lopinavir are associated with renal impairment, and TDF is 
known to cause loss of bone mineral density. Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) was 
developed to improve on the safety profile of TDF, while maintaining its 
efficacy. TAF has better stability in plasma, and higher intracellular 
accumulation of tenofovir diphosphate in target cells, which has resulted in 
improved antiviral activity at lower doses with improved renal and bone safety. 
TAF has been studied extensively in randomized clinical trials and real-world 
studies. TAF-based regimens are recommended over TDF-containing regimens for the 
improved safety profile.

Metacarpal trabecular bone varies with distinct hand-positions used in hominid 
locomotion.

Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany.

Trabecular bone remodels during life in response to loading and thus should, at 
least in part, reflect potential variation in the magnitude, frequency and 
direction of joint loading across different hominid species. Here we analyse the 
trabecular structure across all non-pollical metacarpal distal heads (Mc2-5) in 
extant great apes, expanding on previous volume of interest and whole-epiphysis 
analyses that have largely focused on only the first or third metacarpal. 
Specifically, we employ both a univariate statistical mapping and a multivariate 
approach to test for both inter-ray and interspecific differences in relative 
trabecular bone volume fraction (RBV/TV) and degree of anisotropy (DA) in Mc2-5 
subchondral trabecular bone. Results demonstrate that whereas DA values only 
separate Pongo from African apes (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla 
gorilla), RBV/TV distribution varies with the predicted loading of the 
metacarpophalangeal (McP) joints during locomotor behaviours in each species. 
Gorilla exhibits a relatively dorsal distribution of RBV/TV consistent with 
habitual hyper-extension of the McP joints during knuckle-walking, whereas Pongo 
has a palmar distribution consistent with flexed McP joints used to grasp 
arboreal substrates. Both Pan species possess a disto-dorsal distribution of 
RBV/TV, compatible with multiple hand postures associated with a more varied 
locomotor regime. Further inter-ray comparisons reveal RBV/TV patterns 
consistent with varied knuckle-walking postures in Pan species in contrast to 
higher RBV/TV values toward the midline of the hand in Mc2 and Mc5 of Gorilla, 
consistent with habitual palm-back knuckle-walking. These patterns of trabecular 
bone distribution and structure reflect different behavioural signals that could 
be useful for determining the behaviours of fossil hominins.

Spatial clusters of life expectancy and association with cardiovascular disease 
mortality and cancer mortality in the contiguous United States: 1980-2014.

The average life expectancy varies greatly from county to county in USA and 
there are also spatial variations in the county mortality rates for 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, the top two causes of death. An 
association between these two groups of diseases has not been identified by 
cluster analysis previously. The main objective in this study was to investigate 
and quantify the associations between mortality due to CVD, cancer mortality and 
life expectancy based on US county data between 1980 and 2014. Regression 
analysis was used to adjust life expectancy for the mortality due to CVD and 
that due to cancer. In addition to the spatial life expectancy trends, we also 
studied existing trends over time with the software JOINPOINT to see how life 
expectancy is influenced by changes in mortality due to CVD and cancer 
mortality. The study setting was the 48 contiguous US states, while participants 
were 3,100 counties and their populations of all ages during the period 
1980-2014. The main outcomes are spatial clusters of unusually low or high 
levels of life expectancy in addition to identifying which county level life 
expectancy locations were significantly associated with mortality due to CVD 
and/or cancer. Life expectancy has been improving steadily from 1980 to 2014, 
but the rate of increase per year (indicated by variation of the trend slope) 
changed significantly at five joinpoints, the latest of which occurred in 2010 
when the slope changed from 0.29 (1980-1982) to 0.03 (2010-2014). Our results 
reveal that there are significant, purely spatial clusters in some geographical 
areas where life expectancy rates are significantly higher (or lower) than in 
the rest of the contiguous US. It is also shown that there is a significant 
association between the life expectancy level and the corresponding CVD 
mortality, and there is also a significant association between life expectancy 
level and the corresponding overall cancer mortality. The general trends 
(regression slopes) over time for the USA in life expectancy mortality, CVD 
mortality and cancer mortality have changed significantly after 2009-2010.

Medical School, Boston, MA.

The excitement about immunotherapy is justified. Patients with advanced disease 
and limited life expectancy before immune checkpoint inhibitors are now having 
prolonged and sometimes complete responses to treatment; however, most patients 
do not respond to checkpoint inhibitors. The hope for a meaningful response with 
only a limited risk of high-grade toxicity generated a prognostic dilemma for 
patients with advanced cancers and their treating oncologists. Older adults with 
advanced cancers are at the intersection of multiple biologic and clinical 
factors that can influence the efficacy of immunotherapy. Treating physicians 
should take all of these elements into account when considering treatment 
options for an older adult with advanced disease. Oncologists should have an 
honest conversation with their patients regarding the uncertainty around the 
clinical profile of checkpoint inhibitors. Early high-quality goals of care 
discussions can help manage expectations of older adults with advanced cancer 
treated with immunotherapy. We review in this paper select clinical 
characteristics that are important to consider when evaluating an older adult 
for checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In addition, we discuss strategies to optimize 
goals of care discussion given the increasing complexity of prognostication in 
the immunotherapy era.

OBJECTIVE: Although life expectancy after spinal cord injury (SCI) has 
increased, knowledge of life satisfaction and associated factors among older 
adults with long-term SCI is still very limited. The objective of this study 
was, therefore, to assess global and domain-specific life satisfaction among 
older adults with long-term SCI and investigate the association with 
sociodemographics, injury characteristics and secondary health conditions.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. Data from the Swedish Aging with Spinal 
Cord Injury Study (SASCIS).
SETTING: Community settings in southern Sweden.
PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-eight individuals (32% women, injury levels C1-L3, 
American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) A-D) mean age 68 
years, mean time since injury 31 years.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The Life Satisfaction Questionnaire (LiSat-11).
RESULTS: The participants were at least rather satisfied with most of the 11 
life domains. They rated the lowest satisfaction with sexual life, activities of 
daily living and somatic health. Having a partner and being vocationally active 
was associated with greater satisfaction with life as a whole and with several 
other life domains. Participants with AIS D injuries were less satisfied with 
their somatic health than those with tetraplegia AIS A-C and paraplegia AIS A-C 
injuries. More secondary health conditions were negatively associated with 
satisfaction in five life domains.
CONCLUSION: Life satisfaction can be affected many years after SCI. The social 
context, participation in meaningful activities and minimizing secondary health 
conditions seem to be important for maintaining life satisfaction in older 
adults with a long-term injury.

Brontocoris tabidus Signoret (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) is a zoophytophagous 
predator of lepidopteran defoliators of eucalyptus in Brazil. This predator 
complements its diet with plants, which is fundamental for its population 
maintenance. The objective was to evaluate the B. tabidus development, 
reproduction, and life table parameters in the field on Eucalyptus cloeziana F. 
Muell. (T1), Psidium guajava Linn (Myrtales: Myrtaceae) (T2), or without plants 
(T3). The parameters estimated were: net reproductive rate (Ro); generation 
duration (DG); time for the population to double in size (TD); intrinsic 
population growth rate (rm), survival rate (lX), specific fertility (mx), life 
expectancy (ex), and mortality risk (qx). Ro, DG, TD, and rm were higher in the 
T1 and T2 than in T3. Plant presence favored the lx, mx, and qx. Ex values were 
36.1 and 56.9 in the T3 and T1, respectively. The B. tabidus fertility, 
longevity, and life table parameters improvement on E. cloeziana and P. guajava 
plants are due to the water and nutrients obtained from them. B. tabidus can be 
reared with Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus (Coleoptara: Tenebrionidae) pupae on E. 
cloeziana or P. guajava plants in the field.

Communicating About Stopping Cancer Screening: Comparing Clinicians' and Older 
Adults' Perspectives.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older adults with limited life expectancy frequently 
receive cancer screening. We sought to compare the perspectives of clinicians 
and older adults on how to communicate about stopping cancer screening.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from two studies involving 
semistructured in-person individual interviews, in which we asked about 
perspectives on communication about stopping cancer screening, with 28 primary 
care clinicians and 40 community-dwelling older adults, respectively.
RESULTS: We identified three major themes: (a) Consensus among primary care 
clinicians and older adults regarding communication around stopping cancer 
screening. Both groups considered discussing the benefits/risks of cancer 
screening and involving patients in the decision as important and mentioned 
framing screening cessation as shift in health priorities. (b) Differences in 
perceived reactions to stopping cancer screening. Primary care clinicians were 
concerned about patient reaction to stopping cancer screening, whereas older 
adults reported no negative reactions in the context of a trusting relationship. 
(c) Differences in views around whether to discuss life expectancy in the 
context of stopping cancer screening. Clinicians rarely discussed life 
expectancy in this context, whereas older adults were divided on whether life 
expectancy should be discussed.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Given the heterogeneity in older adults' 
preferences, it is important to assess whether patients want to discuss life 
expectancy when discussing stopping cancer screening, though use of the specific 
term "life expectancy" may not be necessary. Instead, focusing discussion on the 
benefits/risks of cancer screening and mentioning shift in health priorities are 
acceptable communication strategies for both clinicians and older adults.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is minimal survival benefit to cancer screening 
for those with poor clinical presentation (complex multimorbidity) or at 
advanced ages. The current screening mammography guidelines consider these 
objective indicators. There has been less attention, however, to women's 
subjective assessment of screening need. This study examines the interplay 
between complex multimorbidity, age, and subjective assessments of health and 
longevity for screening mammography receipt.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD: This cross-sectional study uses self-reported data 
from 8,938 women over the age of 52 in the 2012 Health and Retirement Study. 
Logistic regression models estimated the association between women's complex 
multimorbidity (co-occurrence of chronic conditions, functional limitations, 
and/or geriatric syndromes), subjective health and longevity assessments, age, 
and screening mammography in the 2 years before the interview. These 
associations were evaluated adjusting for sociodemographic and behavioral 
factors.
RESULTS: Both age and complex multimorbidity were negatively associated with 
screening mammography. However, women's perceived need for screening moderated 
these effects. Most significantly, women optimistic about their chances of 
living another 10-15 years were more likely to have had screening mammography 
regardless of their health conditions or advanced age.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Women with more favorable self-assessed health and 
perceived life expectancy were more likely to receive screening mammography even 
if they have poor clinical presentation or advanced age. This is contrary to 
current cancer screening guidelines and suggests an opportunity to engage 
women's subjective health and longevity assessments for cancer screening 
decision making in both for screening policy and in individual clinician 
recommendations.

BACKGROUND: The continuous increase in the life expectancy of older adults 
(elderly people) has generated interest in research into frail-aged people and 
their physical and mental well-being.
OBJECTIVES: To verify the different effects of two programs of physical exercise 
(strength training-TG, and callisthenic training-MG) on the cognitive state, 
functionality, stability and general health of frail-aged institutionalized 
older adults.
DESIGN: This study was a block randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: The study was conducted in geriatric units of the San Rosendo 
Foundation.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 77 institutionalized frail-aged people (70.1% female, 
aged 84.8±7.9) took part.
INTERVENTIONS: The TG carried out a strength program with therabands®; The MG 
performed an exercise program of multi-callisthenics, and the CG did not carry 
out any physical exercise.
MEASUREMENTS: The following measurements were used: Minimental test, Pfeiffer 
test, SF-12, Barthel test, Five times sit-to-stand and a pressure platform.
RESULTS: The TG program generated some improvement in cognitive state and 
functional independence, while in the physical and mental component of the S-12, 
significant improvement was generated. The program undertaken by MG demonstrated 
a tendency to the stabilization of the above mentioned parameters, while the GC 
demonstrated a tendency to deterioration.
CONCLUSION: Physical exercise, whether it be the strength program, or the 
multi-calisthenics program, is an effective method for improving and maintaining 
health, cognitive state, functional independence and stability in frail-aged 
institutionalized people.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy of people with depression is on average 15 years 
less than that of the general population. This excess of mortality is largely 
attributed to a deteriorated physical health. Evidence about the association 
between major depressive disorder (MDD) and physical health is still lacking in 
some areas. The aim of this study was to explore the association between MDD and 
physical health-related variables in southern Spain.
METHODS: The PISMA-ep is a cross-sectional study based on community-dwelling 
adult population. Our main outcome was current prevalence of MDD. Independent 
variables explored were: lifetime prevalence of twenty-one chronic physical 
conditions (CPCs), anthropometric measures (height, weight, body max index, and 
hip and waist circumferences), general health status, and medication use.
RESULTS: MDD was significantly associated with any CPC (OR = 2.60; 95% CI: 
2.01-3.35; p < 0.001). Increases in BMI were associated with MDD in women 
(OR=1.08; 95% CI: 1.05-1.11; p < 0.001), but not in men (OR=0.99; 95% CI: 
0.95-1.05; p = 0.916). Variables associated with MDD in the multivariate model 
were: female gender, obesity, general health status, cancer, peptic ulcer, 
tinnitus and vertigo. 21.4% of participants with MDD received antidepressant 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: MDD is associated with CPCs, obesity, and increased use of 
medication. The high rates of comorbidity between MDD and CPCs call for a more 
holistic management of patients in the clinical practice. The low rate of 
antidepressant use may be indicating underdiagnosis. Anthropometric variables 
were differently associated with MDD depending on gender, suggesting a strong 
influence of psychosocial factors.
