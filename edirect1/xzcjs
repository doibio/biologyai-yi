annual QALYs (0.844) compared with SOC alone ($2,637 and 0.767). FeNO monitoring 
with SOC resulted in decreased annual costs and increased annual QALYs compared 
with SOC alone, and this difference was consistent through all one-way 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis revealed that FeNO monitoring to guide asthma 
management is cost effective and could result in increased QALYs and decreased 
health care costs associated with asthma management.

A new methodology, based on high resolution liquid chromatography with light 
scatterin detector, is applied to analyze Hydroxypropyl-beta-Cyclodextrin 
(HPβCD) in urine samples of a child affected by Niemann-Pick Type C disease. The 
treatment not only stopped disease progression, but has also increased the life 
expectancy and quality of our patient. The pharmacokinetic of HPβCD in the 
patient was studied with a 92.8% of HPβCD recovered. At 88 h, no HPβCD was found 
in the urine. During the treatment, HPβCD has not shown toxicity. Before 
application of the new treatment, injections were given every two weeks but, we 
have demonstrated that this can be increased to every four days.

BACKGROUND: As general population life expectancy has increased, the need to 
investigate the quality of life has arisen, especially because it is important 
that people have a healthy long life and with good quality. Studies are done 
with specific populations, and in the case of this investigation, the target 
studies are the ones done with women. Female population is growing 
demographically and professionally. Women have shown increased levels of stress 
and higher number of illness. It is known that many practices can be used to 
improve the level of quality of life and that one of them is the dance. Dance is 
an activity which combines physical and psychosocial aspects. Moreover, it 
promotes self-expression, self-esteem, and self-confidence. It relieves women of 
stress. And it also helps in a variety of aspects such as group interaction, 
motivation, and positive emotions. In this systematic review, the main objective 
is to assess the effect of dance on quality of life of adult women.
METHODS: Only quantitative studies will be included. Studies will be accepted 
with any amount of dance practice time. They will have been published in the 
following bibliographic databases: Scientific Electronic Library Online 
(SciELO), Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde (BVS), Portal da Coordenação de 
Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), MEDLINE, Embase, and 
Cochrane from inception until June 30, 2018. There will be no restrictions for 
geographical location. It will be included studies published in Portuguese, 
English, and Spanish. Only published ones will be included in the review.
DISCUSSION: There is a variety of systematic review studies with men and women 
on quality of life and dance, but this is the first one focused exclusively on 
adult female audience. It is expected that this review will be useful to promote 
the discussion about quality of life of adult women and the interest of this 
population for dance practice. In order to summarize and to explain the 
characteristics and findings of those studies, tables and information from texts 
will be used in a systematic narrative synthesis.

BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are common during standard, 
long-course treatment for multidrug-resistant and rifampicin-resistant 
tuberculosis (MDR-/RR-TB). In particular, second-line injectables (SLIs) are 
associated with permanent hearing loss, acute renal injury and electrolyte 
imbalance. We adapted an established Markov model for ambulatory treatment to 
estimate the impact of the toxicity profile on the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for a proposed MDR-/RR-TB regimen replacing the 
SLI with bedaquiline (BDQ).
METHODS: Treatment effectiveness was evaluated in disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs). Clinical outcomes and ingredient costs from a provider perspective were 
derived from the South African public-sector treatment program or extracted from 
the literature. Costs and effectiveness were discounted at 3% per year over 10 
years.
RESULTS: A BDQ-based MDR-/RR-TB regimen compared with the SLI regimen had a mean 
ICER of US$516 per DALY averted using the standard Markov model. Costs for both 
regimens increased and effectiveness decreased for the SLI regimen once adjusted 
for toxicity. The resulting ICER for the BDQ-based regimen was cost saving 
(US$96/patient) and more effective (0.96 DALYs averted) after adjusting for 
ADRs.
CONCLUSION: Decision-analysis models of treatment for MDR-/RR-TB, including new 
drug regimens, should consider the costs of managing ADRs and their sequelae.

Pathogenesis of Thalassemia Major-associated Osteoporosis: A Review with 
Insights from Clinical Experience.

Due to increasing life expectancy in thalassemia major (TM), osteoporosis is 
emerging as a significant problem. Its aetiology is multifactorial, culminating 
in increased bone resorption and impaired remodelling. Hypogonadism and marrow 
expansion seem to play an important role, but iron overload, deferoxamine 
toxicity, a defective growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor-1 axis and 
multiple endocrinopathies may represent additional causes of bone damage. Many 
of these patients, though under appropriate treatment programs, do not achieve 
normal peak bone mass. The receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-ß 
(RANK)/RANK ligand/osteoprotegerin and the Wnt/β-catenin systems work as major 
mediators of imbalanced bone turnover and bone loss. Additional genetic factors, 
such as collagen type 1 alpha 1 and vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms, may 
exert some influence on the enhanced fracture risk observed in TM. To date, in 
spite of adequate hormone replacement, chelating therapy and acceptable 
haemoglobin levels, subjects with TM display impaired bone density and 
imbalanced bone turnover, thus the puzzle of the pathogenesis of TM-induced 
osteoporosis remains far from being solved.

Life expectancy and other outcomes for patients with serious mental illness 
(SMI) are unacceptably poor, largely due to a high prevalence of poorly 
controlled chronic diseases, high rates of tobacco use, and low rates of 
preventive care services. Since many of these illnesses are effectively treated 
in primary care settings, integrating primary care with behavioral health care 
is necessary to narrow health disparities for patients with SMI.

Mutations of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and the E3 ubiquitin (Ub) 
ligase parkin can cause familial parkinsonism. These two proteins are essential 
for ubiquitylation of damaged mitochondria and subsequent degradation. PINK1 
phosphorylates Ser65 of Ub and the Ub-like (UBL) domain of parkin to 
allosterically relieve the autoinhibition of parkin. To understand the 
structural mechanism of the Ub/UBL-specific phosphorylation by PINK1, we 
determined the crystal structure of Tribolium castaneum PINK1 kinase domain 
(TcPINK1) in complex with a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue at 2.5 Å resolution. 
TcPINK1 consists of the N- and C-terminal lobes with the PINK1-specific 
extension. The ATP analogue is bound in the cleft between the N- and C-terminal 
lobes. The adenine ring of the ATP analogue is bound to a hydrophobic pocket, 
whereas the triphosphate group of the ATP analogue and two coordinated Mg ions 
interact with the catalytic hydrophilic residues. Comparison with protein 
kinases A and C (PKA and PKC, respectively) unveils a putative Ub/UBL-binding 
groove, which is wider than the peptide-binding groove of PKA or PKC to 
accommodate the globular head of Ub or UBL. Further crosslinking analyses 
suggested a PINK1-interacting surface of Ub. Structure-guided mutational 
analyses support the findings from the present structural analysis of PINK1.

PURPOSE: Few studies focus on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of 
preschool children with overweight or obesity. This is relevant for evaluation 
of obesity prevention trials using a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
framework. This study examined the association between weight status in the 
preschool years and HRQoL at age 5 years, using a preference-based instrument.
METHODS: HRQoL [based on parent proxy version of the Health Utilities Index Mark 
3 (HUI3)] and weight status were measured in children born in Australia between 
2007 and 2009. Children's health status was scored across eight attributes of 
the HUI3-vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition and 
pain, and these were used to calculate a multi-attribute utility score. Ordinary 
least squares (OLS), Tobit and two-part regressions were used to model the 
association between weight status and multi-attribute utility.
RESULTS: Of the 368 children for whom weight status and HUI3 data were 
available, around 40% had overweight/obesity. After adjusting for child's sex, 
maternal education, marital status and household income, no significant 
association between weight status in the preschool years and multi-attribute 
utility scores at 5 years was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Alternative approaches for capturing the effects of weight status 
in the preschool years on preference-based HRQoL outcomes should be tested. The 
application of the QALY framework to economic evaluations of obesity-related 
interventions in young children should also consider longitudinal effects over 
the life-course. Clinical Trial Registration The Healthy Beginnings Trial was 
registered with the Australian Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRNO12607000168459).

Snell dwarf mice (Pit1dw/dw ) exhibit deficiencies in growth hormone, prolactin, 
and thyroid stimulating hormone. Besides being an experimental model of 
hypopituitarism, these mice are long-lived (>40% lifespan extension) and 
utilized as a model of slowed/delayed aging. Whether this longevity is 
accompanied by a compromised quality of life in terms of muscular performance 
has not yet been characterized. In this study, we investigated nontrained and 
trained muscles 1 month following a general validated resistance-type exercise 
protocol in 3-month-old Snell dwarf mice and control littermates. Nontrained 
Snell dwarf gastrocnemius muscles exhibited a 1.3-fold greater muscle mass to 
body weight ratio than control values although muscle quality, maximum isometric 
torque normalized to muscle mass, and fatigue recovery were compromised. For 
control mice, training increased isometric torque (17%) without altering muscle 
mass. For Snell dwarf mice, isometric torque was unaltered by training despite 
decreased muscle mass that rendered muscle mass to body weight ratio comparable 
to control values. Muscle quality and fatigue recovery improved twofold and 
threefold, respectively, for Snell dwarf mice. This accompanied a fourfold 
increase in levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), a mediator of 
progenitor cell recruitment, and muscle remodeling in the form of increased 
number of central nuclei, additional muscle fibers per unit area, and altered 
fiber type distribution. These results reveal a trade-off between muscle quality 
and longevity in the context of anterior pituitary hormone deficiency and that 
resistance-type training can diminish this trade-off by improving muscle quality 
concomitant with VCAM-1 upregulation and muscle remodeling.

Economic losses due to post-harvest fungal spoilage and mycotoxin contamination 
of cereal crops is a frequently encountered issue. Typically, chemical 
preservatives are used to reduce the initial microbial load and the 
environmental conditions during storage are controlled to prevent microbial 
growth. However, in recent years the consumers' desire for more naturally 
produced foods containing less chemical preservatives has grown increasingly 
stronger. This article reviews the latest advances in terms of novel approaches 
for chemical decontamination, namely application cold atmospheric pressure 
plasma and electrolyzed water, and their suitability for preservation of stored 
cereal crops. In addition, the alternative use of bio-preservatives, such as 
starter cultures or purified antimicrobial compounds, to prevent the growth of 
spoilage organisms or remove in-field accumulated mycotoxins is evaluated. All 
treatments assessed here show potential for inhibition of microbial spoilage. 
However, each method encounters draw-backs, making industrial application 
difficult. Even under optimized processing conditions, it is unlikely that one 
single treatment can reduce the natural microbial load sufficiently. It is 
evident that future research needs to examine the combined application of 
several treatments to exploit their synergistic properties. This would enable 
sufficient reduction in the microbial load and ensure microbiological safety of 
cereal crops during long-term storage.

A Soft Exosuit for Flexible Upper-Extremity Rehabilitation.

Lessard S, Pansodtee P, Robbins A, Trombadore JM, Kurniawan S, Teodorescu M.

For stroke survivors and many other people with upper-extremity impairment, 
daily life can be difficult without properly functioning arms. Some modern 
physical therapy exercises focus on rehabilitating people with these troubles by 
correcting patients' perceptions of their own body to eventually regain complete 
control and strength over their arms again. Augmentative wearable robots, such 
as the upper-extremity exoskeletons and exosuits, may be able to assist in this 
endeavor. A common drawback in many of these exoskeletons, however, is their 
inability to conform to the natural flexibility of the human body without a 
rigid base. We have built one such exosuit to address this challenge: Compliant 
Robotic Upper-extremity eXosuit (CRUX). This robot is a compliant, lightweight, 
multi-DoF, portable exosuit that affords its wearer the ability to augment 
themselves in many unconventional settings (i.e. outside of a clinic). These 
attributes are largely achieved by using a modified tensegrity design situated 
according to measured lines of minimal-extension, where a network of tension 
members provide a foundation to apply augmentative forces via precisely placed 
power-lines. In this paper, we detail the design process of CRUX, the report on 
CRUX's prototypical composition, and describe the mimetic control algorithm 
used. We also discuss the results of three studies that illustrate the efficacy 
of CRUX's mimetic controller, CRUX's flexibility and compliance, and the 
metabolic cost reduction when users exercise with assistance from CRUX as 
opposed to without. We conclude this paper with a summary of our findings, 
potential use cases for this technology, and the direction of future related 
work.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the neuropsychomotor development in the first year of life 
of premature infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted between January 1, 
2014, and December 30, 2015, with premature infants weighing < 1,500g at birth 
and diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia at the corrected ages of 6 and 9 
months, assessed using the DENVER II Developmental Screening Test. Quantitative 
variables were described as the means, medians and standard deviations. 
Variables with normal distribution were tested using Student's t test; 
otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used, considering significance at p-value < 
0.05. Qualitative variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages. 
Logistic regression was used with odds ratio analysis to evaluate the effects of 
other variables as risk factors for changes in neuropsychomotor development.
RESULTS: Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia showed greater developmental 
delay compared with those without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (p-value = 0.001). 
The factors associated with a higher incidence of changes in neuropsychomotor 
development, in addition to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, were antenatal steroid, 
gender, birth weight, 5-minute Apgar score, Score for Neonatal Acute 
Physiology-Perinatal Extension, duration of oxygen therapy, duration of 
mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay. Other variables may also 
have influenced the result, such as drug use by mothers of infants with 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
CONCLUSION: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia associated with other pre- and postnatal 
factors may be considered a risk factor for delayed neuropsychomotor development 
in the first year of life in premature infants born weighing less than 1,500g.

razão de chances para avaliar os efeitos das outras variáveis, como fatores de 
risco para alterações no desenvolvimento neuropsicomotor.
RESULTADOS: Os lactentes com displasia broncopulmonar apresentaram maior atraso 
no desenvolvimento neuropsicomotor quando comparados àqueles sem displasia 
broncopulmonar (p = 0,001). Os fatores associados com maior incidência para 
alterações no desenvolvimento neuropsicomotor, além da displasia broncopulmonar, 
foram: esteroide antenatal, sexo, peso ao nascimento, escore de Apgar no quinto 
minuto, Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology with Perinatal Extension, tempo de 
oxigenoterapia, ventilação mecânica e internação. Outras variáveis também podem 
ter influenciado o resultado, como uso de drogas pelas mães dos lactentes com 
displasia broncopulmonar.
CONCLUSÃO: A displasia broncopulmonar associada a outros fatores pré e 
pós-natais pode ser considerada fator de risco para o atraso do desenvolvimento 
neuropsicomotor em lactentes nascidos prematuramente e com peso inferior a 
1.500g, no primeiro ano de vida.

Objectives Examining the association between maternal smoking and losses in 
childhood health-related quality of life due to behavior problems provides 
parents and policymakers another tool for the valuation of smoking cessation 
during pregnancy. Methods Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 
Child and Young Adult data, this study retrospectively examined a cohort of 4114 
women and 8668 children. In addition to questions focusing on maternal smoking 
and general demographics, each survey included the Behavior Problems Index 
(BPI), a 28-item questionnaire with six subscales measuring childhood behavior 
problems (antisocial behavior, anxiousness/depression, headstrongness, 
hyperactivity, immature dependency, and peer conflict/social withdrawal). 
Responses to the BPI, completed by mothers with children ages 4-14, were 
summarized on a QALY scale using published preference weights. Results Children 
whose mothers smoked during pregnancy experience additional QALY losses of 
0.181, on average, per year due to increased behavior problems. Boys suffered 
larger QALY losses associated with maternal smoking (0.242) compared to girls 
(0.119; p value = .021), regardless of age. Moreover, heavier smoking during 
pregnancy (i.e., 1 or more packs/day) was associated with larger QALY losses 
(0.282; p-value < .001). Conclusions for Practice These findings illustrate the 
burden of maternal smoking during pregnancy on child health, namely behavioral 
problems. The losses in QALYs may be incorporated into economic evaluations for 
smoking cessation interventions during pregnancy. Future research will 
investigate how maternal smoking following childbirth is associated with child 
QALYs.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 3 (HER3) is recognized to be 
involved in resistance to HER-targeting therapies. A number of HER3-targeting 
monoclonal antibodies are under clinical investigation as potential cancer 
therapeutics. Smaller high-affinity scaffold proteins are attractive non-Fc 
containing alternatives to antibodies. A previous study indicated that anti-HER3 
affibody molecules could delay the growth of xenografted HER3-positive tumors. 
Here, we designed a second-generation HER3-targeting construct (TAM-HER3), 
containing two HER3-specific affibody molecules bridged by an albumin-binding 
domain (ABD) for extension of blood circulation. Receptor blocking activity was 
demonstrated in vitro. In mice bearing BxPC-3 xenografts, the therapeutic 
efficacy of TAM-HER3 was compared to the HER3-specific monoclonal antibody 
seribantumab (MM-121). TAM-HER3 inhibited heregulin-induced phosphorylation in a 
panel of HER3-expressing cancer cells and was found to be equally as potent as 
seribantumab in terms of therapeutic efficacy in vivo and with a similar safety 
profile. Median survival times were 60 days for TAM-HER3, 54 days for 
seribantumab, and 41 days for the control group. No pathological changes were 
observed in cytopathological examination. The multimeric HER3-binding affibody 
molecule in fusion to ABD seems promising for further evaluation as candidate 
therapeutics for treatment of HER3-overexpressing tumors.

OBJECTIVE: Rifaximin-α 550 mg twice daily plus lactulose has demonstrated 
efficacy in reducing recurrence of episodes of overt hepatic encephalopathy 
(OHE) and the risk of hepatic encephalopathy (HE)-related hospitalizations 
compared with lactulose alone. This analysis estimated the cost effectiveness of 
rifaximin-α 550 mg twice daily plus lactulose versus lactulose alone in United 
Kingdom (UK) cirrhotic patients with OHE.
METHOD: A Markov model was built to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER). The perspective was that of the UK National Health Service (NHS). 
Clinical data was sourced from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and an 
open-label maintenance study in cirrhotic patients in remission from recurrent 
episodes of OHE. Health-related utility was estimated indirectly from 
disease-specific quality of life RCT data. Resource use data describing the 
impact of rifaximin-α on hospital admissions and length of stay for cirrhotic 
patients with OHE was from four single-center UK audits. Costs (2012) were 
derived from published sources; costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%. The 
base-case time horizon was 5 years.
RESULTS: The average cost per patient was £22,971 in the rifaximin-α plus 
lactulose arm and £23,545 in the lactulose arm, a saving of £573. The 
corresponding values for benefit were 2.35 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and 1.83 QALYs per person, a difference of 0.52 QALYs. This translated into a 
dominant base-case ICER. Key parameters that impacted the ICER included number 
of hospital admissions and length of stay.
CONCLUSION: Rifaximin-α 550 mg twice daily in patients with recurrent episodes 
of OHE was estimated to generate cost savings and improved clinical outcomes 
compared to standard care over 5 years.

nonvalvular atrial fibrillation - A microsimulation study.

BACKGROUND: Anticoagulation decreases a patient's risk of ischemic stroke and 
increases the risk of hemorrhage. Decision analyses regarding anticoagulation 
therefore require that different outcomes be weighted in comparison to one 
another. Most decision analyses to date have weighted intracranial hemorrhage 
(ICH) as 1.5 times worse than ischemic stroke, but because death and disability 
have lifelong impact, the expected impact should vary by life expectancy. 
Therefore, a fixed weighting ratio leads to age-related bias decision analyses 
of anticoagulation. We aimed to quantify the relative impact of ICH and ischemic 
stroke and derive a ratio that allows decision analysis without microsimulation.
METHODS: We created a microsimulation model to predict QALYs lost due to ICH and 
ischemic stroke. We then applied a meta-model to predict the ratio of QALYs lost 
from ICH relative to ischemic stroke.
RESULTS: Previously-used weighting ratios (1.5) are close to our derived mean 
weighting ratio (1.60). However, the weighting ratio of QALYs lost from ICH 
relative to ischemic stroke is sensitive to age and discount rate. Patients at 
younger ages have higher mean weighting ratios, as do patients with higher 
discount rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The ratio of QALYs lost to ICH relative to ischemic stroke varies 
with age and discount rate. We present a set of such ratios here for use in 
decision analyses that do not incorporate full microsimulation models. Use of 
weighting ratios that vary with age, rather than the current fixed ratios, has 
the potential to reduce age-based bias in decision-making regarding events with 
lifelong implications. In this case, use of dynamic ratios may change 
anticoagulation recommendations for patients with nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation at relatively low stroke risk.

BACKGROUND: The estimated 300,000 adults in Australia with severe mental illness 
(SMI) have markedly reduced life expectancy compared to the general population, 
mainly due to physical health comorbidities. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the 
commonest cause of early death and people with SMI have high rates of most 
modifiable risk factors, with associated quality of life (QoL) reduction. High 
blood pressure, smoking, dyslipidaemia, diabetes and obesity are major 
modifiable CVD risk factors. Poor delivery of recommended monitoring and risk 
reduction is a national and international problem. Therefore, effective 
preventive interventions to safeguard and support physical health are urgently 
needed in this population.
METHODS: This trial used a rigorous process, including extensive piloting, to 
develop an intervention that delivers recommended physical health care to reduce 
CVD risk and improve QoL for people with SMI. Components of this intervention 
are integrated using the Flinders Program of chronic condition management (CCM) 
which is a comprehensive psychosocial care planning approach that places the 
patient at the centre of their care, and focuses on building their 
self-management capacity within a collaborative approach, therefore providing a 
recovery-oriented framework. The primary project aim is to evaluate the 
effectiveness and health economics of the CCM intervention. The main outcome 
measures examine CVD risk and quality of life. The second aim is to identify 
essential components, enablers and barriers at patient, clinical and 
organisational levels for national, sustained implementation of recommended 
physical health care delivery to people with SMI. Participants will be recruited 
from a community-based public psychiatric service.
DISCUSSION: This study constitutes the first large-scale trial, worldwide, using 
the Flinders Program with this population. By combining a standardised yet 
flexible motivational process with a targeted set of evidence-based 
interventions, the chief aim is to reduce CVD risk by 20%. If achieved, this 
will be a ground-breaking outcome, and the program will be subsequently 
translated nationwide and abroad. The trial will be of great interest to people 
with mental illness, family carers, mental health services, governments and 
primary care providers because the Flinders Program can be delivered in diverse 
settings by any clinical discipline and supervised peers.

Morocco is undergoing the third phase of its epidemiological transition. 
Mortality indicators have declined significantly. Life expectancy at birth has 
increased by 23 years over this 55-year study period. The total fertility rate 
has dropped from 7.06 in 1960 to 2.89 in 2015. The country is going through the 
epidemiological transition characterized by a shift in the overall burden of 
morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases to noncommunicable diseases and 
injuries. Chronic diseases now account for 75 % of all deaths. Cardiovascular 
diseases, diabetes, and cancer are among the leading causes of death (57 %). 
Accidents and injuries account for 7 % of deaths. The emerging diseases are 
largely related to changes in lifestyles, high blood pressure, obesity, smoking, 
and the harmful use of alcohol. This epidemiological transition, with its 
enormous health and economic consequences, presents many new challenges for the 
national health system, including in the organization of care pathways for 
diabetes and hypertension, the fight against overweight and obesity, and the 
therapeutic education of patients, health education in schools, and public 
awareness programs.

INTRODUCTION: Systemic treatment with alitretinoin is registered for all 
clinical types of severe chronic hand eczema. However, it is especially 
effective in the hyperkeratotic subtype and less effective in non-hyperkeratotic 
forms. Cyclosporine A (cyclosporine) is prescribed for hand eczema in daily 
practice as well. It has shown to be particularly effective in patients with 
vesicular hand eczema. The primary objective of this study is to compare 
efficacy of alitretinoin and cyclosporine in the treatment of severe recurrent 
vesicular hand eczema.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an investigator-initiated randomised prospective 
open-label trial with blinded outcome assessment. Severity assessments and 
laboratory measurements will be conducted corresponding to daily practice. The 
study population will consist of 72 adult patients (age 18-75 years) with severe 
recurrent vesicular hand eczema. Patients are treated with either (group I) 
alitretinoin 30 mg once daily or (group II) cyclosporine with a starting dose of 
5 mg/kg/day and a decrease in dosage after 8 weeks to 3-3.5 mg/kg/day. The 
treatment period is 24 weeks for both drugs. Primary endpoint for efficacy is 
response to treatment, defined as an improvement of ≥2 steps on a Physician 
Global Assessment, using a validated Photoguide, after 24 weeks of treatment. 
Secondary endpoints are improvement of Hand Eczema Severity Index, Quality of 
Life in Hand Eczema Questionnaire and a Patient Global Assessment. Adverse 
events and time to response will be registered. Furthermore, cost-utility, 
quality-adjusted life years and cost-effectiveness will be assessed with the 
EQ-5D-5L questionnaire while monitoring costs.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol was reviewed and approved by the Medical 
Ethical Review Board of the University Medical Centre Groningen (reference METc 
2015/375). The study will be conducted according to the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the Dutch Medical Research Involving 
Human Subjects Act.

The genus Brachypodium represents a model system that is advancing our knowledge 
of the biology of grasses, including small grains, in the postgenomics era. The 
most widely used species, Brachypodium distachyon, is a C3 plant that is 
distributed worldwide. B. distachyon has a small genome, short life cycle, and 
small stature and is amenable to genetic transformation. Due to the intensive 
and thoughtful development of this grass as a model organism, it is well-suited 
for laboratory and field experimentation. The intent of this review is to 
introduce this model system genus and describe some key outcomes of nearly a 
decade of research since the first draft genome sequence of the flagship 
species, B. distachyon, was completed. We discuss characteristics and features 
of B. distachyon and its congeners that make the genus a valuable model system 
for studies in ecology, evolution, genetics, and genomics in the grasses, review 
current hot topics in Brachypodium research, and highlight the potential for 
future analysis using this system in the coming years.

Hot-melt extrusion (HME) is a well-accepted and extensively studied method for 
preparing numerous types of drug delivery systems and dosage forms. It offers 
several advantages: no solvents are required, it is easy to scale up and employ 
on the industrial level, and, in particular, it offers the possibility of 
improving drug bioavailability. HME involves the mixing of a drug with one or 
more excipients, in general polymers and even plasticizers, which can melt, 
often forming a solid dispersion of the drug in the polymer. The molten mass is 
extruded and cooled, giving rise to a solid material with designed properties. 
This process, which can be realized using different kinds of special equipment, 
may involve modifications in the drug physicochemical properties, such as 
chemical, thermal and mechanical characteristics thus affecting the drug 
physicochemical stability and bioavailability. During process optimization, the 
evaluation of the drug solid state and stability is thus of paramount importance 
to guarantee stable drug properties for the duration of the drug product shelf 
life. This manuscript reviews the most important physicochemical factors that 
should be investigated while designing and optimizing a hot melt extrusion 
process, and by extension, during the different pre-formulation, formulation and 
process, and post-formulation phases. It offers a comprehensive evaluation of 
the chemical and thermal stability of extrudates, the solid physical state of 
extrudates, possible drug-polymer interactions, the miscibility/solubility of 
the drug-polymer system, the rheological properties of extrudates, the 
physicomechanical properties of films produced by hot melt extrusion, and drug 
particle dissolution from extrudates. It draws upon the last ten years of 
research, extending inquiry as broadly as possible.
