Breeding for increased protein without a reduction in oil content in soybeans 
[Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is a challenge for soybean breeders but an expected 
goal. Many efforts have been made to develop new soybean varieties with high 
yield in combination with desirable protein and/or oil traits. An elite line, 
R05-1415, was reported to be high yielding, high protein, and low oil. Several 
significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for protein and oil were reported in 
this line, but many of them were unstable across environments or genetic 
backgrounds. Thus, a new study under multiple field environments using the 
Infinium BARCSoySNP6K BeadChips was conducted to detect and confirm stable 
genomic loci for these traits. Genetic analyses consistently detected a single 
major genomic locus conveying these two traits with remarkably high phenotypic 
variation explained (R2 ), varying between 24.2% and 43.5%. This new genomic 
locus is located between 25.0 and 26.7 Mb, distant from the previously reported 
QTL and did not overlap with other commonly reported QTL and the recently cloned 
gene Glyma.20G085100. Homolog analysis indicated that this QTL did not result 
from the paracentric chromosome inversion with an adjacent genomic fragment that 
harbors the reported QTL. The pleiotropic effect of this QTL could be a 
challenge for improving protein and oil simultaneously; however, a further study 
of four candidate genes with significant expressions in the seed developmental 
stages coupled with haplotype analysis may be able to pinpoint causative genes. 
The functionality and roles of these genes can be determined and characterized, 
which lay a solid foundation for the improvement of protein and oil content in 
soybeans.

OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to explore the impact of different 
periodontal surgical treatments on the quality of life and postoperative 
morbidity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study is a single-center, prospective, 
observational cohort trial. One hundred fifty-five patients, referred to the 
Periodontal Department of Bologna University who needed periodontal surgical 
treatment, were recruited. The self-reported perception of the postoperative 
course was assessed using the following anonymous questionnaires: Italian oral 
health impact profile (I-OHIP-14), visual analog scale (VAS) to evaluate the 
intensity of the pain, and 5-point Likert scale.
RESULTS: Patients reported a mean OHIP-14 total score of 9.87±8.5 (range 0-42), 
significantly influenced by the female sex, flap extension, and periodontal 
dressing. A mean VAS score of 2.96±2.39 (range 0-9) was calculated, and was 
found to be influenced by the presence of vertical releasing incisions and 
palatal flap extension. Of the 155 subjects, 40 (25.8%) patients reported 
bleeding as a post-surgical complication, 96 (61.9%) swelling, 105 (67.7%) 
eating discomfort, and 44 (28.4%) reported speech discomfort.
CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of the nature of the present study, 
periodontal surgical procedures have a low impact on patients' quality of life 
evaluated through the OHIP-14 and VAS pain questionnaires.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Periodontal surgical procedures are safe procedures, with a 
limited duration of postoperative discomfort as well as the incidence of 
complications.

BACKGROUND: Many countries and regions have experienced male fertility problems 
due to various influencing factors, especially in less developed countries. 
Unlike female infertility, male infertility receives insufficient attention. 
Understanding the changing patterns of male infertility in the world, different 
regions and different countries is crucial for assessing the global male 
fertility and reproductive health.
METHODS: We obtained data on prevalence, years of life lived with disability 
(YLD), age-standardized rates of prevalence (ASPR) and age-standardized YLD rate 
(ASYR) from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. We analyzed the burden of 
male infertility at all levels, including global, regional, national, age 
stratification and Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
RESULTS: In 2019, the global prevalence of male infertility was estimated to be 
56,530.4 thousand (95% UI: 31,861.5-90,211.7), reflecting a substantial 76.9% 
increase since 1990. Furthermore, the global ASPR stood at 1,402.98 (95% UI: 
792.24-2,242.45) per 100,000 population in 2019, representing a 19% increase 
compared to 1990. The regions with the highest ASPR and ASYR for male 
infertility in 2019 were Western Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and East 
Asia. Notably, the prevalence and YLD related to male infertility peaked in the 
30-34 year age group worldwide. Additionally, the burden of male infertility in 
the High-middle SDI and Middle SDI regions exceeded the global average in terms 
of both ASPR and ASYR.
CONCLUSION: The global burden of male infertility has exhibited a steady 
increase from 1990 to 2019, as evidenced by the rising trends in ASPR and ASYR, 
particularly in the High-middle and Middle SDI regions. Notably, the burden of 
male infertility in these regions far exceeds the global average. Additionally, 
since 2010, there has been a notable upward trend in the burden of male 
infertility in Low and Middle-low SDI regions. Given these findings, it is 
imperative to prioritize efforts aimed at improving male fertility and 
reproductive health.

Peptides and their mimetics are increasingly recognised as drug-like molecules, 
particularly for intracellular protein-protein interactions too large for 
inhibition by small molecules, and inaccessible to larger biologics. In the past 
two decades, evidence associating the misfolding and aggregation of 
alpha-synuclein strongly implicates this protein in disease onset and 
progression of Parkinson's disease and related synucleinopathies. The subsequent 
formation of toxic, intracellular, Lewy body deposits, in which alpha-synuclein 
is a major component, is a key diagnostic hallmark of the disease. To reach 
their therapeutic site of action, peptides must both cross the blood-brain 
barrier and enter dopaminergic neurons to prevent the formation of these 
intracellular inclusions. In this review, we describe and summarise the current 
efforts made in the development of peptides and their mimetics to directly 
engage with alpha-synuclein with the intention of modulating aggregation, and 
importantly, toxicity. This is a rapidly expanding field with great 
socioeconomic impact; these molecules harbour significant promise as 
therapeutics, or as early biomarkers during prodromal disease stages, or both. 
As these are age-dependent conditions, an increasing global life expectancy 
means disease prevalence is rising. No current treatments exist to either 
prevent or slow disease progression. It is therefore crucial that drugs are 
developed for these conditions before health care and social care capacities 
become overrun.

Bill-EVR: An Embodied Virtual Reality Framework for Reward-and-Error-Based Motor 
Rehab-Learning.

Nardi F, Haar S, Faisal AA.

VR rehabilitation is an established field by now, however, it often refers to 
computer screen-based interactive rehabilitation activities. In recent years, 
there was an increased use of VR-headsets, which can provide an immersive 
virtual environment for real-world tasks, but they are lacking any physical 
interaction with the task objects and any proprioceptive feedback. Here, we 
focus on Embodied Virtual Reality (EVR), an emerging field where not only the 
visual input via VR-headset but also the haptic feedback is physically correct. 
This happens because subjects interact with physical objects that are 
veridically aligned in Virtual Reality. This technology lets us manipulate motor 
performance and motor learning through visual feedback perturbations. Bill-EVR 
is a framework that allows interventions in the performance of real-world tasks, 
such as playing pool billiard, engaging end-users in motivating life-like 
situations to trigger motor (re)learning - subjects see in VR and handle the 
real-world cue stick, the pool table and shoot physical balls. Specifically, we 
developed our platform to isolate and evaluate different mechanisms of motor 
learning to investigate its two main components, error-based and reward-based 
motor adaptation. This understanding can provide insights for improvements in 
neurorehabilitation: indeed, reward-based mechanisms are putatively impaired by 
degradation of the dopaminergic system, such as in Parkinson's disease, while 
error-based mechanisms are essential for recovering from stroke-induced movement 
errors. Due to its fully customisable features, our EVR framework can be used to 
facilitate the improvement of several conditions, providing a valid extension of 
VR-based implementations and constituting a motor learning tool that can be 
completely tailored to the individual needs of patients.

Organismal Responses to Coastal Acidification Informed by Interrelating Erosion, 
Roundness and Growth of Gastropod Shells.

urrent understanding of how calcifying organisms respond to externally forced 
oceanic and coastal acidification (OCA) is largely based on short-term, 
controlled laboratory or mesocosm experiments. Studies on organismal responses 
to acidification (reduced carbonate saturation and pH) in the wild, where 
animals simultaneously interact with a range of biotic and abiotic 
circumstances, are limited in scope and interpretation. The present study aimed 
to better understand how gastropod shell attributes and their interrelations can 
inform about responses to coastal acidification. We investigated shell chemical 
erosion, shell roundness, and growth rate of Planaxis sulcatus snails, which are 
locally exposed to acidified and non-acidified rocky intertidal water. We tested 
a new approach to quantifying shell erosion based on the spiral suture length 
(EI, erosion index) and found that shell erosion mirrored field acidification 
conditions. Exposure to acidification caused shells to become rounder 
(width/length). Field growth rate, determined from apertural margin extension of 
marked and later recaptured snails, was strongly negatively related to both 
shell erosion and shell roundness. Since different shell attributes are 
indicative of different relationships-shell erosion is an extrinsic passive 
marker of acidification, and shell roundness and growth rate are intrinsic 
performance responders-analyzing their interrelations can imply causation, 
enhance predictive power, and bolster interpretation confidence. This study 
contributes to the methodology and interpretation of findings of trait-based 
field investigations to understand organismal responses to coastal 
acidification.

INTRODUCTION: Rural consumption is crucial in promoting economic and social 
development in China's economic slowdown. Integrating urban-rural residents' 
health insurance has alleviated the financial burden of medical expenses for 
rural households and boosted rural household consumption. This study examines 
the effect of integrating urban-rural residents' health insurance on the 
consumption patterns of middle-aged and older adult households in rural China. 
Our research provides a reference basis for improving rural healthcare security 
and enhancing the sustainable consumption capacity in rural areas.
METHODS: We employed a Propensity Score Matching Difference-in-Differences model 
(PSM-DID) to estimate the association between health insurance integration and 
household consumption using panel data from the China Health and Retirement 
Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) from 2013 to 2018. Furthermore, we employed a 
mediation model to analyze the influencing mechanisms.
RESULTS: Our findings suggested a positive association between health insurance 
integration and survival consumption as well as total consumption among rural 
middle-aged and older adult households. The conclusion remained valid after 
endogeneity treatment, robustness and placebo tests. Furthermore, we found that 
the impact of health insurance integration is more pronounced for middle-aged, 
female, and high-income rural residents' households. Integrating urban-rural 
residents' health insurance raised consumption by reducing medical expenses and 
increasing health and life expectancy.
DISCUSSION: Policymakers should deepen the rural medical and health system 
reform, improve the convenience of medical services for middle-aged and older 
adult families in rural areas, and improve the medical and life assistance 
mechanism for vulnerable groups in rural areas. Additionally, the local 
government should continuously broaden rural household income channels to 
promote upgrading consumption structure while improving overall consumption 
levels.

INTRODUCTION: Treatment advances for hematologic malignancies (HM) have 
dramatically improved life expectancy, necessitating greater focus on long-term 
cancer pain management. This study explored real-world patterns of opioid use 
among patients with HM.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study identified adults diagnosed with HM 
from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2019 using the Truven MarketScan 
Commercial Claims and Encounters database. Across several HM types, we described 
rates of high-risk opioid use (based on Pharmacy Quality Alliance measures) and 
opioid-related harms, including incident opioid use disorder (OUD) diagnoses and 
opioid-related hospitalizations or emergency department (ED) visits. We used 
multivariable Cox regression to generate adjusted hazard ratios and 95% 
confidence intervals comparing the risk of opioid-related harms between patients 
with versus without high-risk opioid use.
RESULTS: Our sample included 43,190 patients with HM. Median age at HM diagnosis 
was 54 years (interquartile range  =  44-60). Most patients (61.9%) were 
diagnosed with lymphoma. Approximately half (49.2%) had an opioid dispensed in 
the follow-up period. Among all patients, 20.0% met criteria for high-risk 
opioid use, 0.9% had an OUD diagnosis, and 0.3% experienced an opioid-related 
hospitalization/ED visit in follow-up. High-risk opioid use increased the risk 
of an OUD diagnosis by 3.3 times (p < 0.0001) and an opioid-related 
hospitalization/ED visit 4.2 times (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: High-risk opioid use was prevalent among patients with HM and 
significantly increased the risk of opioid-related harms. However, rates of 
opioid-related harms were low. These findings highlight the importance of 
continually monitoring pain and opioid use throughout HM survivorship to provide 
safe, effective HM pain management.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise 
therapy on physical function and quality of life (QOL) in older patients with 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma undergoing inpatient chemotherapy, including differences 
between patients with and without sarcopenia.
METHODS: Thirty-one inpatients aged 70 years or older participated in this 
study. Grip and knee extensor strength, 6-minute walking test, body composition, 
nutritional status, fatigue and health-related QOL at admission and discharge 
were compared. In addition, the patients were classified into sarcopenic and 
non-sarcopenic groups, and a comparison between admission and discharge and 
2-way ANOVA were performed.
RESULTS: Overall, grip strength and skeletal muscle mass were significantly 
lower at discharge than at admission (P < .05); however, QOL significantly 
improved (P < .05). In the non-sarcopenia group, grip strength, right knee 
extension muscle strength, and skeletal muscle mass were all significantly lower 
at discharge than at admission (P < .05); however, this was not the case in the 
sarcopenia group. In terms of QOL, improvements were observed in different items 
in the non-sarcopenia and sarcopenia groups. There was a significant interaction 
between admission to discharge time period and sarcopenia regarding left grip 
strength, right knee extensor strength, and QOL.
CONCLUSION: Exercise therapy is effective in improving QOL in older non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma patients undergoing inpatient chemotherapy. However, the effect of 
exercise therapy and optimal exercise load may differ between non-sarcopenia and 
sarcopenia patients. Therefore, it is necessary to consider exercise therapy in 
the future, taking into account the presence or absence of sarcopenia.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic bronchitis is a phenotype of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), characterized by chronic cough and sputum production, 
associated with an increased rate of COPD exacerbations and hospital admissions, 
a more rapid decline in lung function and reduced life expectancy. Despite 
optimal medical therapy, chronic bronchitis remains difficult to treat. 
Interventional bronchoscopic procedures offer novel therapeutic approaches to 
this highly symptomatic condition.
RECENT FINDINGS: A characteristic feature of chronic bronchitis is the presence 
of an abnormal epithelium with excessive mucus producing cells, parasympathetic 
overactivity, and airway inflammation. Metered cryospray and bronchial 
rheoplasty are designed to target this abnormal epithelium to reduce mucus 
production and inflammation. Targeted lung denervation aims to reduce 
parasympathetic overactivity, which may drive mucus hypersecretion. Here, we 
review the available evidence to determine the safety and efficacy across the 
bronchoscopic interventions.
SUMMARY: Interventional bronchoscopy is a rapidly expanding field and its 
application in the treatment of chronic bronchitis has been recognized by the 
Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). The outcomes from 
the latest clinical trials will guide future treatment approaches in patients 
with difficult to treat chronic bronchitis.

PURPOSE: The objective of the COLLISION RELAPSE trial is to prove or disprove 
superiority of neoadjuvant systemic therapy followed by repeat local treatment 
(either thermal ablation and/or surgical resection), compared to repeat local 
treatment alone, in patients with at least one recurrent locally treatable CRLM 
within one year and no extrahepatic disease.
METHODS: A total of 360 patients will be included in this phase III, multicentre 
randomized controlled trial. The primary endpoint is overall survival. Secondary 
endpoints are distant progression-free survival, local tumour progression-free 
survival analysed per patient and per tumour, systemic therapy-related toxicity, 
procedural morbidity and mortality, length of hospital stay, pain assessment and 
quality of life, cost-effectiveness ratio and quality-adjusted life years.
DISCUSSION: If the addition of neoadjuvant systemic therapy to repeat local 
treatment of CRLM proves to be superior compared to repeat local treatment 
alone, this may lead to a prolonged life expectancy and increased disease-free 
survival at the cost of possible systemic therapy-related side effects.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 1, phase III randomized controlled trial.

Telomeres are the protective structures located at the ends of linear 
chromosomes. They were first described in the 1930s, but their biology remained 
unexplored until the early 70s, when Alexey M. Olovnikov, a theoretical 
biologist, suggested that telomeres cannot be fully copied during DNA 
replication. He proposed a theory that linked this phenomenon with the limit of 
cell proliferation capacity and the "duration of life" (theory of marginotomy), 
and suggested a potential of telomere lenghthening for the prevention of aging 
(anti-marginotomy). The impact of proliferative telomere shortening on life 
expectancy was later confirmed. In humans, telomere shortening is counteracted 
by telomerase, an enzyme that is undetectable in most adult somatic cells, but 
present in cancer cells and adult and embryonic stem and germ cells. Although 
telomere length dynamics are different in male and female gametes during 
gametogenesis, telomere lengths are reset at the blastocyst stage, setting the 
initial length of the species. The role of the telomere pathway in reproduction 
has been explored for years, mainly because of increased infertility resulting 
from delayed childbearing. Short telomere length in ovarian somatic cells is 
associated to decreased fertility and higher aneuploidy rates in embryos. 
Consequently, there is a growing interest in telomere lengthening strategies, 
aimed at improving fertility. It has also been observed that lifestyle factors 
can affect telomere length and improve fertility outcomes. In this review, we 
discuss the implications of telomere theory in fertility, especially in oocytes, 
spermatozoa, and embryos, as well as therapies to enhance reproductive success.

OBJECTIVE: Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the fatal malignancies affecting the 
life expectancy of women worldwide. Golgi Phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) has been 
shown to play a key role in the development of various tumors. However, the role 
of GOLPH3 in the development of CC is unclear.
METHODS: GOLPH3 levels were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot assays. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) 
and colony formation assays were used to detect cell proliferation. Xenograft 
tumor models were used to explore the effects of GOLPH3 on tumor growth of mice, 
and immunohistochemistry assay was performed to determine the expression of 
GOLPH3 and Ki-67. Transwell assay was performed to evaluate cell migration and 
invasion. Western blot assay was used to analyze the signaling molecules-related 
proteins regulated by GOLPH3.
RESULTS: GOLPH3 was upregulated in human CC tissues from the GEO database 
(GSE39001 and GSE63514), and further demonstrated that GOLPH3 level was elevated 
in human CC cells. GOLPH3 enhanced CC cell proliferation, and knockdown of 
GOLPH3 suppressed tumor growth and decreased Ki-67 level in xenograft mice. In 
addition, GOLPH3 aggravated the migration and invasion of CC cells. The data 
indicated that Wnt/β-catenin signaling might be one of the key targets of 
GOLPH3. Blockage of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by XAV-939 significantly affected 
the effects of GOLPH3 on cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) related molecules, whereas LiCl (a Wnt/β-catenin signal 
activator) reversed these above effects.
CONCLUSION: GOLPH3 promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion in CC, 
possibly by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which may provide a 
new idea for the development of CC therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: ART has improved the life expectancy of people living with HIV 
(PLHIV) by suppressing the virus and increasing CD4 count. Some PLHIV shows 
immune-virological discordant responses i.e. suppressed viral load to the 
undetectable level but still with immunological failure or good immunological 
response with virological failure. Immuno-virological response plays a key role 
to address treatment outcome, regimen change and management for people living 
with HIV. It is reported that PLHIV with discordant responses were found to be 
at an increased risk to develop AIDS and non-AIDS events related death.
AIMS & OBJECTIVE: To determine immuno-virological discordance amongst PLHIV on 
ART and its effect on mortality.
MATERIAL & METHOD: After getting institutional Ethics committee approval, total 
1921 patients were included in the study who were on ART for at least 6 month or 
more and have at least two CD4 count tests results and were tested from July 
2019 to June 2020. Retrospective analysis was done.
RESULTS: Total 1921 patients were included in study of which 1383 (72%) showed 
immuno-virological concordance & 538 (28%) showed immuno-virological 
discordance. Overall mortality rate among PLHIV was 3.6%. Mortality rate in 
immuno-virological concordant group was 2.8%. Of immuno-virological discordant 
population, 505 (26.3%) were virological only responders (VO) with 5.35% 
mortality rate & 33 (1.7%) were immunological only responders (IO) with 9.09% 
mortality rate. High number of immunological discordant patients in the present 
study warrants the further evaluation of these patients with change in 
appropriate treatment strategy to decrease the mortality among this group.
CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the role of immunological monitoring as well 
as virological monitoring to improve the life expectancy of PLHIV.

'Inert' co-formulants of a fungicide mediate acute effects on honey bee learning 
performance.

Managed honey bees have experienced high rates of colony loss recently, with 
pesticide exposure as a major cause. While pesticides can be lethal at high 
doses, lower doses can produce sublethal effects, which may substantially weaken 
colonies. Impaired learning performance is a behavioral sublethal effect, and is 
often present in bees exposed to insecticides. However, the effects of other 
pesticides (such as fungicides) on honey bee learning are understudied, as are 
the effects of pesticide formulations versus active ingredients. Here, we 
investigated the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide formulation Pristine 
(active ingredients: 25.2% boscalid, 12.8% pyraclostrobin) on honey bee 
olfactory learning performance in the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay. We 
also exposed a subset of bees to only the active ingredients to test which 
formulation component(s) were driving the learning effects. We found that the 
formulation produced negative effects on memory, but this effect was not present 
in bees fed only boscalid and pyraclostrobin. This suggests that the trade 
secret "other ingredients" in the formulation mediated the learning effects, 
either through exerting their own toxic effects or by increasing the toxicities 
of the active ingredients. These results show that pesticide co-formulants 
should not be assumed inert and should instead be included when assessing 
pesticide risks.

Invertebrate species are a natural reservoir of viral genetic diversity, and 
invertebrate pests are widely distributed in crop fields. However, information 
on viruses infecting invertebrate pests of crops is limited. In this report, we 
describe the deep metatranscriptomic sequencing of 88 invertebrate samples 
covering all major invertebrate pests in rice fields. We identified 296 new RNA 
viruses and 13 known RNA viruses. These viruses clustered within 31 families, 
with many highly divergent viruses constituting potentially new families and 
genera. Of the identified viruses, 13 RNA viruses clustered within the 
Fiersviridae family of bacteriophages, and 48 RNA viruses clustered within 
families and genera of mycoviruses. We detected known rice viruses in novel 
invertebrate hosts at high abundances. Furthermore, some novel RNA viruses have 
genome structures closely matching to known plant viruses and clustered within 
genera of several plant virus species. Forty-five potential insect pathogenic 
RNA viruses were detected in invertebrate species. Our analysis revealed that 
host taxonomy plays a major role and geographical location plays an important 
role in structuring viral diversity. Cross-species transmission of RNA viruses 
was detected between invertebrate hosts. Newly identified viral genomes showed 
extensive variation for invertebrate viral families or genera. Together, the 
large-scale metatranscriptomic analysis greatly expands our understanding of RNA 
viruses in rice invertebrate species, the results provide valuable information 
for developing efficient strategies to manage insect pests and virus-mediated 
crop diseases.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical manifestations of a fragility fracture of 
the sacrum (FFS) and the factors that may contribute to a misdiagnosis.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: The number of patients diagnosed with FFS has increased 
because of extended life expectancy and osteoporosis. Patients with FFS may 
report nonspecific symptoms, such as back, buttock, groin, and/or leg pain, 
leading to a misdiagnosis and a delay in definitive diagnosis.
METHODS: Fifty-six patients (13 males and 43 females) with an average age of 
80.2±9.2 years admitted to the hospital for FFS between 2006 and 2021 were 
analyzed retrospectively. The following patient data were collected using 
medical records: pain regions, a history of trauma, initial diagnoses, and rates 
of fracture detection using radiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI).
RESULTS: Forty-one patients presented with low back and/or buttock pain, nine 
presented with groin pain, and 17 presented with thigh or leg pain. There was no 
history of trauma in 18 patients (32%). At the initial visit, 27 patients (48%) 
were diagnosed with sacral or pelvic fragility fractures. In contrast, 29 
patients (52%) were initially misdiagnosed with lumbar spine disease (23 
patients), hip joint diseases (three patients), and buttock bruises (three 
patients). Fracture detection rates for FFS were 2% using radiography, 71% using 
CT, and 93% using MRI. FFS was diagnosed definitively using an MRI with a 
coronal short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence.
CONCLUSIONS: Some patients with FFS have leg pain with no history of trauma and 
are initially misdiagnosed as having lumbar spine disease, hip joint disease, or 
simple bruises. When these clinical symptoms are reported, we recommend 
considering FFS as one of the differential diagnoses and performing lumbar or 
pelvic MRIs, particularly coronal STIR images, to rule out FFS.

BACKGROUND: Starting from the 1950s, shoulder arthroplasty has been developing, 
one consequence of which has been the concept of reverse shoulder arthroplasty 
(RSA). Initially, it was supposed to be used only in patients with irreversible 
rotator cuff damage, but it quickly gained more and more indications for use. 
The aim of the present study was to assess biomechanical, objective indications 
for RSA in patients with shoulder osteoarthritis (OA) based on an inertial 
measurement system with electromyography.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 20 patients were qualified to this prospective study, 10 
each in a control and experimental group. The study was conducted between August 
2020 and October 2021. The experimental group consisted of 9 women and 1 man 
aged 55 to 85 years old, with osteoarthritis of the shoulder associated with 
rotator cuff damage. The study utilised the myoMotion inertial sensor system 
(Noraxon, USA) synchronized with the surface electromyography system Myotrace 
400 (Noraxon, USA).
RESULTS: Movement phase diagrams were used to assess the movement patterns. To 
examine the movement pattern in the shoulder, three motor tests can be proposed: 
flexion-extension, flexion in the scapular plane and abduction-adduction. The 
observation of trends for the operated limb showed the highest absolute 
improvement in the group with the greatest impairment of the movement pattern in 
the initial test. However, on final evaluation, these results were still twice 
as low as those obtained in the group with the least impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: 1. Early qualification of patients with shoulder OA for RSA could 
mean a greater likelihood of functional and quality-of-life improvement. 2. 
Movement patterns after RSA may improve, but will probably not return to 
physiological values.

(1)Division of Otolaryngology Head & Neck Surgery, University of British 
Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To review the published literature on decisional regret in adult 
patients undergoing operative otolaryngology procedures. The primary outcome was 
decisional regret scale (DRS) scores. DRS scores of 0 indicate no regret, 1-25 
mild regret, and >25 moderate to strong/severe regret.
DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive librarian-designed strategy was used to search 
MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL from inception to September 2023.
REVIEW METHODS: Inclusion criteria consisted of English-language studies of 
adult patients who underwent operative otolaryngology treatments and reported 
DRS scores. Data was extracted by two independent reviewers. Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) guidelines were followed. Oxford Centre's Levels of Evidence were 
used for quality assessment.
RESULTS: In total, 6306 studies were screened by two independent reviewers; 13 
studies were included after full-text analysis. Subspecialties comprised: Head 
and neck (10), endocrine (1), general (1), and rhinology (1). The DRS results of 
the included studies spanned a mean range of 10.1-23.9 or a median range of 
0-20.0. There was a trend toward more decisional regret after large head and 
neck procedures or when patients underwent multiple treatment modalities. 
Depression, anxiety, and patient-reported quality of life measures were all 
correlated with decisional regret. Oxford Centre's Levels of Evidence ranged 
from 2 to 4.
CONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive review of decisional regret in 
otolaryngology. The majority of patients had no or mild (DRS <25) decisional 
regret after otolaryngology treatments. Future research on pre-operative 
counseling and shared decision-making to further minimize patient decisional 
regret is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Nitrogen is one of the most important mineral nutrients for plants 
and is absorbed by the root system mainly in the inorganic form (NH+4 and NO-3). 
Plants absorb nitrogen as a food source for growth, biomass production, and 
development. Nitrogen is mainly absorbed as nitrate, which is the most common 
source of nitrogen available to higher plants. One of the unique features of 
nitrate transport is that NO-3 is both a substrate for transport and an inducer 
of NO-3 transport systems in genes and at physiological levels.
METHODS: In the present study, morphological and physiological traits 
(chlorophyll a/b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid, antioxidant enzymes, and 
protein content), correlation between traits and gene expression, and principle 
component analysis of traits among five barley cultivars were measured in 
response to nitrogen deficiency (ND). The starved plants were transferred to a 
nutrient solution containing 0.2 mM and 2 mM NO-3 up to 7 and 14 days after ND 
application and non-stressed conditions, respectively.
RESULTS: Gene expression analysis revealed that the 10 HvNRT2 genes were induced 
in the leaf and root tissues at 7 and 14 days after ND treatments in five barley 
cultivars. Expression of NRT2 genes by relative quantitative qRT-PCR analysis 
for 10 HvNRT2 genes were determined. Based on the gene expression, HvNRT2.1, 
HvNRT2.2, and HvNRT2.4 were strongly induced by NO-3, peaking at 7 and 14 days 
after ND treatment. In contrast, the HvNRT2.4 showed only moderate induction in 
both leaves and roots. From our results, the Reyhan cultivar showed a 
significant increase in root fresh weight (RFW), protein content, and 
antioxidant enzyme activity in roots at 7 and 14 days after ND treatment as 
compared to the non-stressed condition. A highly positive correlation was 
observed between root catalase (CATr) and HvNRT2.2/2.5/2.6 leaves.
CONCLUSION: The expression of HvNRT2.4 is increased during long-term nitrogen 
starvation, while the expression of HvNRT2.1 and HvNRT2.2 are transiently 
increased by ND. Based on physiological and morphological traits and molecular 
mechanisms, the Reyhan is considered a tolerant cultivar under ND condition.

OBJECTIVES: 1) to analyse the total average healthcare costs of a patient with 
an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), as well as estimating the operational 
costs of the citizen-rescuer system (CRS); 2) to conduct an early modelling of 
the effects and healthcare costs of the Dutch CRS in comparison to no CRS.
METHODS: A health economic modelling study was conducted. Adult patients with 
OHCA from cardiac causes in the province of Limburg (the Netherlands) were 
included. The time horizon was from OHCA occurrence up to one year after 
hospital discharge. First, the total average healthcare costs of OHCA patients 
were analysed as well as the yearly operating costs of the CRS. Second, an early
