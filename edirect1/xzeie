highest in Group4 (84.4%), followed by Group 2 (50.0%). The median time from EOL 
disclosure to death was longer in Groups 1 and 4 (26 and 29.5 days, 
respectively), compared to Groups 2 and 3 (18.5 and 16 days, respectively).
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: A variety of expressions are used in EOL disclosure. 
Patterns of communication are influenced by patients' gender and type of illness 
(cancer or noncancer). Euphemisms do not seem to facilitate timely disclosure of 
life expectancy or patient participation. For health professionals, not only 
devising the expressions to alleviate their patients' distress when breaking bad 
news but also considering the communication process and patient background are 
essential.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to perform an updated Markov analysis to 
determine the optimal management strategy for patients with an asymptomatic 
paraesophageal hernia (PEH): elective laparoscopic hernia repair (ELHR) versus 
watchful waiting (WW).
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Currently it is recommended that patients with an 
asymptomatic PEH not undergo repair based on a 20-year-old Markov analysis. The 
current recommendation might lead to preventable hospitalizations for acute 
PEH-related complications and compromised survival.
METHODS: A Markov model with updated variables was used to compare life-years 
(LYs) gained with ELHR versus WW in patients with a PEH. One-way sensitivity 
analyses evaluated the robustness of the analysis to alternative data inputs, 
while probabilistic sensitivity analysis quantified the level of confidence in 
the results in relation to the uncertainty across all model inputs.
RESULTS: At age 40-90 ELHR led to greater life expectancy than WW, particularly 
in women. The gain in L-Ys (2.6) was greatest in a 40-year-old woman and 
diminished with increasing age. Sensitivity analysis showed that alternative 
values resulted in modest changes in the difference in L-Ys, but ELHR remained 
the preferred strategy. Probabilistic analysis showed that ELHR was the 
preferred strategy in 100% of 10,000 simulations for age 65, 98% for age 80, 90% 
for age 85 and 59% of simulations in 90-year-old women.
CONCLUSIONS: This updated analysis showed that ELHR leads to an increase in L-Ys 
over WW in healthy patients aged 40-90 years with an asymptomatic PEH. In this 
new paradigm all patients with a PEH, regardless of symptoms, should be referred 
for consideration of elective repair to maximize their life expectancy.

Care System, Iowa City, VA, USA.

BACKGROUND: Few life events are as profound as the birth of a child. Yet for 
those who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic, the birth experience and the 
care of their newborn child were altered in significant ways.
METHOD: In this study, we examined the stories of women who gave birth during 
the COVID-19 pandemic using expectations violations theory and communication 
privacy management theory.
RESULTS: Based on focus group interviews with 65 women from 19 states across the 
U.S., we found that policies imposed by institutions and visitation rules 
negotiated by women were prominent in women's birth stories. Policies that 
affect territorial access to mothers and babies shaped communication to manage 
health and safety, resulted in intense emotional responses, and affected 
relationships with women's partners and families.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings offer practical implications for both health care 
systems and health care providers. Systems must communicate proactively to offer 
compassionate patient care, and physicians should offer guidance to help new 
parents manage visitors.

In most vertebrates, the oviducts and sperm ducts are derived from the Müllerian 
ducts and Wolffian ducts, respectively. However, in teleosts, the genital ducts 
are formed by the posterior extension of gonads in both sexes. Whether the 
genital ducts of teleosts are newly evolved organs or variants of Müllerian 
ducts is an important question for understanding evolutionary mechanisms of 
morphogenesis. One of the genes essential for Müllerian duct formation in mice 
is Wnt4, which is expressed in the mesenchyme and induces invagination of the 
coelomic epithelium and its posterior elongation. Here, we addressed the above 
question by examining genital duct development in mutants of two Wnt4 genes in 
the medaka (wnt4a is orthologous to mouse Wnt4, and wnt4b is paralogous). The 
wnt4b mutants had a short body but were fertile with normal genital ducts. In 
contrast, both male and female wnt4a mutants had their posterior elongation of 
the gonads stopped within or just outside the coelom. The mutants retained the 
posterior parts of ovarian cavities or sperm duct primordia, which are potential 
target tissues of Wnt4a. The gonads of female scl mutants (unable to synthesize 
sex steroids) lacked these tissues and did not develop genital ducts. Medaka 
wnt4a was expressed in the mesenchyme ventral to the genital ducts in both 
sexes. Taken together, the data strongly suggest that the mouse Müllerian ducts 
and the medaka genital ducts share homologous developmental processes. 
Additionally, the wnt4a or wnt4b single mutants and the double mutants did not 
show sex-reversal, implying that both genes are dispensable for gonadal sex 
differentiation in the medaka.

AIMS: Thailand's national smoking cessation services (FAH-SAI clinics) were 
founded in 2010. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is needed to inform 
policymakers of the allocation and prioritization of the limited budget to 
maximize the value for money of reimbursing these services. Chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) patients would benefit from smoking cessation services. 
Therefore, this study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of these 
multidisciplinary services compared to the usual care among COPD patients in 
Thailand from a societal perspective.
METHODS: We conducted a CEA from a societal perspective using a Markov model to 
simulate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by each 
smoking cessation intervention over the patient's lifetime. We derived the 
effectiveness of the smoking cessation services from a multicenter, longitudinal 
study of smoking cessation services in Thailand and estimated the natural quit 
rate, transition probabilities, health utility, and cost data from the published 
literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: Compared to the usual care, FAH-SAI clinics were associated with higher 
costs (4,207 THB (US$133)) and improved QALYs (0.11), with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of 37,675 THB/QALY (US$1,187/QALY). The effectiveness 
of FAH-SAI clinics was a key driver of the cost-effectiveness results. At the 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 160,000 THB (US$5,042) per QALY gained, 
the probability of being cost-effective was 96.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: FAH-SAI clinics were cost-effective under Thailand's WTP threshold. 
Our results could inform policymakers in allocating resources to support smoking 
cessation services for COPD patients in Thailand.

In this study, we explored the lifespan extension effect of a popular edible 
mushroom, Hypsizygus marmoreus, using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans 
(C. elegans). The results showed that Hypsizygus marmoreus extract (HME) could 
increase the lifespan of C. elegans and ameliorate the healthspan by improving 
motility, attenuating lipofuscin accumulation, and enhancing the ability to 
withstand oxidative and heat stress. Then, we found noteworthy enhancements in 
SOD and CAT activities and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity in 
vivo. Combined with the up-regulation of the expression of antioxidant genes 
(skn-1, sod-1, sod-3, mev-1, and gst-4), HME may function as an antioxidant in 
nematodes, which may be closely related to its phenolic compounds. Furthermore, 
we found that HME promoted the transfer of the transcription factor SKN-1 to the 
nucleus but had no impact on the lifespan of skn-1 mutants, indicating that 
SKN-1 was essential for Hypsizygus marmoreus to exert beneficial biological 
effects in C. elegans. Our findings elucidated that dietary supplementation with 
Hypsizygus marmoreus might have beneficial anti-aging effects and contribute to 
exploring the lifespan extension and underlying mechanisms of Hypsizygus 
marmoreus in C. elegans.

RATIONALE: Achieving net benefit of lung cancer screening (LCS) depends on 
optimizing patient selection.
OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with clinician assessments that a 
patient was unlikely to benefit from LCS ("LCS-inappropriate") due to 
comorbidities or limited life expectancy.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients assessed for LCS at 30 Veterans 
Health Administration facilities from 1/1/2015-2/1/2021. We conducted 
hierarchical mixed effects logistic regression analyses to determine factors 
associated with clinicians' designations of LCS-inappropriateness (primary 
outcome), accounting for 3-year predicted probability (i.e., competing risk) of 
non-lung cancer death.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 38,487 LCS-eligible patients, 1,671 (4.3%) 
were deemed LCS-inappropriate by clinicians, whereas 4,383 (11.4%) had an 
estimated 3-year competing risk of non-lung cancer death >20%. Patients with 
higher competing risks of non-lung cancer death were more likely to be deemed 
LCS-inappropriate (OR 2.66, 95% CI 2.32-3.05). Older patients (ages 75-80: OR 
1.45 [95% CI 1.18-1.78]) and those with interstitial lung disease (OR 1.98 
[1.51-2.59]) were more likely to be deemed LCS-inappropriate than would be 
explained by competing risk of non-lung cancer death, while patients currently 
smoking (OR 0.65 [0.58-0.73]) were less likely to be deemed LCS-inappropriate, 
suggesting clinicians over- or under-weight these factors. The probability of 
being deemed LCS-inappropriate varied from 0.4%-74% depending on the clinician 
making the assessment (median OR 3.07 [2.89-3.25]).
CONCLUSION: Concerningly, the likelihood that a patient is deemed 
LCS-inappropriate is more strongly associated with the clinician making the 
assessment than patient characteristics. Patient selection may be optimized by 
providing decision support to help clinicians assess net LCS benefit.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The last few decades have seen an increase in life expectancy 
in brain tumour patients; however, many patients report sensory-motor and 
cognitive disabilities due to the tumour itself, but also to the effect of 
anticancer treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy), supportive 
treatments, as well as individual patient factors. This review outlines the 
principles on which to base neurorehabilitation treatments, with the aim of 
stimulating an early rehabilitative management, in order to reduce disability 
and functional limitation and improve the quality of life of the persons 
affected by brain tumour.
RECENT FINDINGS: Although not definitive, evidences suggest that an early 
neurorehabilitative evaluation, performed with a multidisciplinary approach, may 
identify the different functional impairments that can affect people with brain 
tumour. Furthermore, identifying and classifying the person's level of 
functioning is useful for designing achievable recovery goals, through the 
implementation of tailored multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs. The 
involvement of different professional figures allows to treat all the components 
(physical, cognitive, psychological and participation) of the person, and to 
redesign one's life project, lastly improving the quality of life.
SUMMARY: Overall, the evidences suggest a critical need for the development of 
this clinical area by spreading the concept of rehabilitation among 
neuro-oncologists and producing high quality research.

Several immunopharmacological agents are effective in the treatment of cancer 
and immune-mediated conditions, with a favorable impact on life expectancy and 
clinical outcomes for a large number of patients. Nevertheless, response 
variation and undesirable effects of these drugs represent major issues, and 
overall efficacy remains unpredictable. Males and females show a distinct 
difference in immune system responses, with females generally mounting stronger 
responses to a variety of stimuli. Therefore, exploring sex differences in the 
efficacy and safety of immunopharmacological agents would strengthen the 
practice of precision medicine. As a pharmacological target highlight, 
programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) is the first functionally characterized 
ligand of the coinhibitory programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1). The PD-L1/PD-1 
crosstalk plays an important role in the immune response and is relevant in 
cancer, infectious and autoimmune disease. Sex differences in the response to 
immune checkpoint inhibitors are well documented, with male patients responding 
better than female patients. Similarly, higher efficacy of and adherence to 
tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in chronic inflammatory conditions including 
rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease have been reported in male patients. 
The pharmacological basis of sex-specific responses to immune system modulating 
drugs is actively investigated in other settings such as stroke and type 1 
diabetes. Advances in therapeutics targeting the endothelium could soon be 
wielded against autoimmunity and metabolic disorders. Based on the established 
sexual dimorphism in immune-related pathophysiology and disease presentation, 
sex-specific immunopharmacological protocols should be integrated into clinical 
guidelines.

BACKGROUND: Cashmere has long been used as the raw material for wool textiles. 
The diameter of the cashmere fibre determines its quality and economic value. 
However, the regulatory role of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in cashmere fineness 
remains unclear, especially regarding the interaction between ncRNAs and coding 
RNAs.
RESULTS: Transcriptome sequencing was used to identify the expression profiles 
of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs) and microRNAs 
(miRNAs) in the skin tissues of Jiangnan cashmere goats with different cashmere 
fineness levels. Integration analysis of ncRNA and coding RNA was performed in 
combination with previous research results. The results showed that 16,437 
lncRNAs, 2234 circRNAs, and 1322 miRNAs were identified in 8 skin samples of 
cashmere goats. A total of 403 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs, 62 DE 
circRNAs and 30 DE miRNAs were identified in the skin tissues of the fine groups 
(Fe) and coarse groups (Ce). We predicted the target gene of DE lncRNA, the 
target gene of DE miRNA and the host gene of DE circRNA. Based on functional 
annotation and enrichment analysis of target genes, we found that DE lncRNAs 
could be involved in regulating the fineness traits of cashmere. The most 
potential lncRNAs were MSTRG.42054.1, MSTRG.18602.3, and MSTRG.2199.13.
CONCLUSIONS: The data from this study enriched the cashmere goat noncoding RNA 
database and helped to supplement the annotation of the goat genome. The results 
provided a new direction for the breeding of cashmere characters.

BACKGROUND: Effects of demographic change, such as declining birth rates and 
increasing individual life expectancy, require health system adjustments 
offering age- and needs-based care. In addition, healthcare factors can also 
influence health services demand.
METHODS: The official German hospital statistics database with odd-numbered 
years between 1995 and 2011 was analysed. This is a national comprehensive 
database of all general hospital inpatient services delivered. Official data 
from hospital statistics were linked at the district level with demographic and 
socio-economic data as well as population figures from the official regional 
statistics. Panel data regression, modelling case numbers per hospital, was 
performed for 13 diagnosis groups that characterised the patient structure. 
Socio-demographic variables included age, sex, household income, and healthcare 
factors included bed capacity, personnel and hospital characteristics.
RESULTS: The median number of annual treatments per hospital increased from 6 
015 (5th and 95th percentile [670; 24 812]) in 1995 to 7 817 in 2011 (5th and 
95th percentile [301; 33 651]). We developed models characterising the patient 
structure of health care in Germany, considering both socio-demographic and 
hospital factors. Demographic factors influenced case numbers across all major 
diagnosis groups. For example, the age groups 65-74 and 75 + influenced 
cerebrovascular disease case numbers (p < 0.001). Other important factors 
included human and material resources of hospitals or the household income of 
patients. Distinct differences between the models for the individual diagnosis 
groups were observed.

also hospital infrastructure and socio-economic factors.

BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab is superior to chemotherapy as a first-line treatment 
for patients with mismatch-repair-deficient (dMMR) or 
microsatellite-instability-high (MSI-H) advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer 
(CRC), with a significant long-term survival benefit according to the 
KEYNOTE-177 trial. The current study aimed to determine whether pembrolizumab is 
a cost-effective treatment for patients with dMMR/MSI-H advanced or metastatic 
CRC in China.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model (PSM) was developed to simulate patients 
with dMMR/MSI-H advanced or metastatic CRC based on progression-free survival 
(PFS), progressive disease (PD) and death. The model was designed using a 
lifetime horizon, a 6-week cycle, and a 5% discount rate. The patients in the 
model had metastatic dMMR/MSI-H CRC and had not previously received treatment; 
these characteristics were similar to those of patients in KEYNOTE-177, a phase 
3, open-label randomized clinical trial. The health outcomes and utilities were 
based on the KEYNOTE-177 trial and published data, respectively. Costs were 
calculated based on local charges (2022) and published literature. A treatment 
was deemed cost-effective in China if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) value was less than U.S.$38,142.56 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). 
The robustness of the results was assessed via one-way deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Baseline analysis revealed that pembrolizumab provided an additional 
2.58 QALYs (3.00 life-year) at an incremental cost of U.S.$78,286.04, resulting 
in an ICER of U.S.$30,330.15 per QALY, which was below the willingness-to-pay 
threshold of U.S.$38,142.56 per QALY. When the patient assistance program (PAP) 
was considered, the ICER became U.S.$1,730.67 per QALY, manifesting absolute 
cost-effectiveness. The results of sensitivity analyses demonstrated that 
pembrolizumab was cost-effective in most cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab is a cost-effective first-line treatment for 
dMMR/MSI-H advanced or metastatic CRC patients in China, especially considering 
the PAP.

BACKGROUND: China has a high burden of influenza-associated illness among 
children. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing 
government-funded influenza vaccination to children in China (fully-funded 
policy) compared with the status quo (self-paid policy).
METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to calculate the economic and 
health outcomes, from a societal perspective, using national- and 
provincial-level data. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
[incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained] was used to 
compare the fully-funded policy with the self-paid policy under the 
willingness-to-pay threshold equivalent to national and provincial GDP per 
capita. Sensitivity analyses were performed and various scenarios were explored 
based on real-world conditions, including incorporating indirect effect into the 
analysis.
RESULTS: Compared to the self-paid policy, implementation of a fully-funded 
policy could prevent 1,444,768 [95% uncertainty range (UR): 1,203,446-1,719,761] 
symptomatic cases, 92,110 (95% UR: 66,953-122,226) influenza-related 
hospitalizations, and 6494 (95% UR: 4590-8962) influenza-related death per 
season. The fully-funded policy was cost-effective nationally (7964 USD per QALY 
gained) and provincially for 13 of 31 provincial-level administrative divisions 
(PLADs). The probability of a funded vaccination policy being cost-effective was 
56.5% nationally, and the probability in 9 of 31 PLADs was above 75%. The result 
was most sensitive to the symptomatic influenza rate among children under 
5 years [ICER ranging from - 25,612 (cost-saving) to 14,532 USD per QALY 
gained]. The ICER of the fully-funded policy was substantially lower (becoming 
cost-saving) if the indirect effects of vaccination were considered.
CONCLUSIONS: Introducing a government-funded influenza policy for children is 
cost-effective in China nationally and in many PLADs. PLADs with high 
symptomatic influenza rate and influenza-associated mortality would benefit the 
most from a government-funded influenza vaccination program.

BACKGROUND: As a result of increased life expectancy and improved care for 
patients suffering from chronic disease, the number of patients with 
multimorbidity requiring surgical intervention is increasing. For complex 
surgical patients, it is essential to balance the potential benefits of surgical 
treatment against the risk of permanent loss of functional capacity and quality 
of life due to complications. European and US guidelines on perioperative care 
recommend preoperative multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussions for high-risk 
noncardiac surgical patients. However, the evidence underlying benefits from 
preoperative MDT meetings with all relevant perioperative specialties present is 
limited. The current study aims to investigate the effect of implementation of 
preoperative MDT discussions for high-risk patients undergoing noncardiac 
surgery on serious adverse events.
METHODS/DESIGN: PREPARATION is a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial in 14 
Dutch hospitals without currently established preoperative MDT meeting. The 
intervention, preoperative MDT meetings, will be implemented sequentially with 
seven blocks of 2 hospitals switching from control (preoperative screening as 
usual) to the intervention every 3 months. Each hospital will be randomized to 
one of seven blocks. We aim to include 1200 patients. The primary outcome is the 
incidence of serious adverse events at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include 
(cost)effectiveness, functional outcome, and quality of life for up to 
12 months.
DISCUSSION: PREPARATION is the first study to assess the effectiveness of a 
preoperative MDT meeting for high-risk noncardiac surgical patients in the 
presence of an anesthesiologist. If the results suggest that preoperative MDT 
discussions for high-risk patients are (cost)-effective, the current study 
facilitates implementation of preoperative MDT meetings in clinical practice.

Mammalian female reproductive lifespan is typically significantly shorter than 
life expectancy and is associated with a decrease in ovarian NAD+ levels. 
However, the mechanisms underlying this loss of ovarian NAD+ are unclear. Here, 
we show that CD38, an NAD+ consuming enzyme, is expressed in the ovarian 
extrafollicular space, primarily in immune cells, and its levels increase with 
reproductive age. Reproductively young mice lacking CD38 exhibit larger 
primordial follicle pools, elevated ovarian NAD+ levels, and increased fecundity 
relative to wild type controls. This larger ovarian reserve results from a 
prolonged window of follicle formation during early development. However, the 
beneficial effect of CD38 loss on reproductive function is not maintained at 
advanced age. Our results demonstrate a novel role of CD38 in regulating ovarian 
NAD+ metabolism and establishing the ovarian reserve, a critical process that 
dictates a female's reproductive lifespan.

BACKGROUND: Patients, families, the healthcare system, and society as a whole 
are all significantly impacted by rare diseases (RDs). According to various 
classifications, there are currently up to 9,000 different rare diseases that 
have been recognized, and new diseases are discovered every month. Although very 
few people are affected by each uncommon disease individually, millions of 
people are thought to be impacted globally when all these conditions are 
considered. Therefore, RDs represent an important public health concern. 
Although crucial for clinical care, early and correct diagnosis is still 
difficult to achieve in many nations, especially those with low and middle 
incomes. Consequently, a sizeable amount of the overall burden of RD is 
attributable to undiagnosed RD (URD). Existing barriers and policy aspects 
impacting the care of patients with RD and URD remain to be investigated.
METHODS: To identify unmet needs and opportunities for patients with URD, the 
Developing Nations Working Group of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network 
International (DNWG-UDNI) conducted a survey among its members, who were from 20 
different nations. The survey used a mix of multiple choice and dedicated open 
questions covering a variety of topics. To explore reported needs and analyze 
them in relation to national healthcare economical aspects, publicly available 
data on (a) World Bank ranking; (b) Current health expenditure per capita; (c) 
GDP per capita; (d) Domestic general government health expenditure (% of GDP); 
and (e) Life expectancy at birth, total (years) were incorporated in our study.
RESULTS: This study provides an in-depth evaluation of the unmet needs for 20 
countries: low-income (3), middle-income (10), and high-income (7). When 
analyzing reported unmet needs, almost all countries (N = 19) indicated that 
major barriers still exist when attempting to improve the care of patients with 
UR and/or URD; most countries report unmet needs related to the availability of 
specialized care and dedicated facilities. However, while the countries ranked 
as low income by the World Bank showed the highest prevalence of referred unmet 
needs across the different domains, no specific trend appeared when comparing 
the high, upper, and low-middle income nations. No overt trend was observed when 
separating countries by current health expenditure per capita, GDP per capita, 
domestic general government health expenditure (% of GDP) and life expectancy at 
birth, total (years). Conversely, both the GDP and domestic general government 
health expenditure for each country impacted the presence of ongoing research.
CONCLUSION: We found that policy characteristics varied greatly with the type of 
health system and country. No overall pattern in terms of referral for unmet 
needs when separating countries by main economic or health indicators were 
observed. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying actionable points 
(e.g., implemented orphan drug acts or registries where not available) in order 
to improve the care and diagnosis of RDs and URDs on a global scale.

Filgotinib is an orally administered, preferential Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor 
indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The 
short-term safety, efficacy, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) with 
filgotinib from Phase 2b/3 clinical trials (DARWIN 1 and 2; FINCH 1, 2, and 3) 
are described in patients who inadequately responded to methotrexate (MTX) and 
biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or who were naïve to MTX. This 
article reviews the safety and efficacy from the long-term extension (LTE) 
trials, DARWIN 3 (N=739) and FINCH 4 (N=2731), and PROs across the filgotinib 
development program in RA. Overall, in the DARWIN clinical trials (conducted 
from 2013-2023), patients received their LTE treatment for ≤8 years, while in 
the FINCH trials (ongoing from 2016-2025), patients received filgotinib 
treatment for ≤6 years in the LTE. The longer-term safety profile and 
consistent, sustained efficacy (American College of Rheumatology 20/50/70, 
Clinical Disease Activity Index, and Disease Activity Scale in 28 joints with 
C-reactive protein response rates) of filgotinib were largely similar to those 
observed in the shorter-term parent trials ≤52 weeks. PRO results from the 
parent trials showed improvements in patients' quality of life with filgotinib 
treatment, which compared to or exceeded improvements seen with placebo and 
active comparators (adalimumab, MTX). Filgotinib has a higher specificity for 
JAK1 compared with other therapeutic treatments, leading to reduced inhibition 
of JAK2/3-dependent pathways, potentially providing a distinct safety profile. 
Filgotinib is approved in Europe and Japan for treatment of people with 
moderate-to-severe RA, though it has not been approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration, due to concerns around the benefit/risk profile of the 
filgotinib 200-mg dosage and the potential impact on semen parameters.

Objectives: Assess the prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) of vascular intestinal disorders (VID) from 1990 to 2019. Methods: This 
study conducted a secondary data analysis utilizing the Global Burden of 
Diseases Study 2019. The prevalence, mortality and DALYs of VID were analyzed by 
sex, age and socio-demographic index (SDI), respectively. Analyses were 
performed by using R software. Results: Globally, the number of prevalent VID 
cases increased from 100,158 (95% uncertainty interval: 89,428-114,013) in 
1,990-175,740 (157,941-198,969) in 2019. However, the age-standardized rates 
(ASR) of VID prevalence declined from 2.47 (95% uncertainty interval: 2.24-2.76) 
per 100,000 population to 2.21 (1.98-2.48) per 100,000 population between 1990 
and 2019. Furthermore, the ASR of mortality also decreased from 1990 to 2019. 
Between 1990 and 2019, the regions with high and high-middle level exhibited the 
highest diseases burden. Conclusion: Globally, the diseases burden associated 
with VID demonstrated a decline from 1990 to 2019. However, concerted efforts 
are still required to enhance measures to combat VID within countries 
categorized as high and high-middle SDI.
