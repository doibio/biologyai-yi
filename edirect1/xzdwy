BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the 
most prevalent chronic respiratory disease. This study investigated the global, 
regional and country burden of COPD based on gender, age and socio-demographic 
indices (SDIs) in the last 30-year period from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: The COPD data, including incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs), were obtained from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study. 
If age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) or death rate (ASDR) remains almost 
constant or decreases, the number of cases will still increase as the global 
population increases substantially. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) 
was calculated to assess incidence, mortality and DALY trends.
RESULTS: The incidence of COPD increased by 85.89% from 8,722,966 cases in 1990 
to 16,214,828 cases in 2019, and the ASIR decreased from 216.48/100,000 persons 
in 1990 (95%UI, 204.56-227.33) to 200.49 per 100,000 persons (95%UI, 
188.63-212.57) in 2019. The ASIR increased (EAPC = 0.05, 95%CI, 0.01-0.10) in 
the low SDI region, was stable in the high SDI region, and fell in the other 
three SDI regions. Men had a higher ASIR than women over the past 30 years, and 
there were differences in the incidence rates for different age groups. Male 
mortality and DALYs were higher than female mortality. ASDR decreased by 2.13% 
(95%CI, -2.23% to -2.02%) per year and the annual age-standardized DALY rate 
decreased by 1.97% (95%CI, -2.05% to -1.89%).
CONCLUSIONS: The ASIR, ASDR and age-standardized DALY rate of COPD declined 
overall in the last 30 years, and were highest in the low-middle SDI region.

INTRODUCTION: In recent years, a reduction in the life expectancy gap between 
people living with HIV (PLWH) and the general population has been observed, 
irrespective of CD4 lymphocyte count, due to widespread access to antiretroviral 
treatment. The increase in the life expectancy of PLWH has increased awareness 
of both the ageing process and gender discrepancies in immune restoration and 
survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Longitudinal data were collected for 2240 patients 
followed up at the Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Warsaw, Poland 
(n = 1482), and the Department of Acquired Immunodeficiency, Pomeranian Medical 
University, Szczecin, Poland (n = 758). Immune restoration was measured from the 
time of starting combination antiretroviral therapy until achieving 500 CD4 
lymphocytes/μL, 800 CD4 lymphocytes/μL, and CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratios of > 0.8 
and > 1.0. Full recovery was achieved when the patient was restored to both 800 
CD4 lymphocytes/μL and a CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratio > 1.0.
RESULTS: For all endpoints, immune restoration had a protective effect by 
reducing mortality. Patients who achieved immune restoration had a greater 
chance of reduced mortality than those who did not achieve immune restoration: 
for CD4 count > 500 cells/μL, HR = 5.4 (interquartile range: 3.09-9.41), 
p < 0.001; for CD4 > 800 cells/μL, HR = 5.37 (2.52-11.43), p < 0.001; for 
CD4/CD8 ratio > 0.8, HR = 3.16 (1.81-5.51), p < 0.001; for CD4/CD8 ratio > 1.0, 
HR = 2.67 (1.49-5.24), p = 0.001, and for full immune recovery, HR = 3.62 
(1.63-8.04), p = 0.002.
CONCLUSIONS: Immune restoration remains a powerful factor in improving the 
survival of PLWH, regardless of the speed of recovery.

Derived from the respiratory tracheae, bush-crickets' acoustic tracheae (or ear 
canals) are hollow tubes evolved to transmit sounds from the external 
environment to the interior ear. Due to the location of the ears in the 
forelegs, the acoustic trachea serves as a structural element that can withstand 
large stresses during locomotion. In this study, we report a new Atomic Force 
Microscopy Force Spectroscopy (AFM-FS) approach to quantify the mechanics of 
taenidia in the bush-cricket Mecopoda elongata. Mechanical properties were 
examined over the longitudinal axis of hydrated taenidia, by indenting single 
fibres using precision hyperbolic tips. Analysis of the force-displacement (F-d) 
extension curves at low strains using the Hertzian contact model showed an 
Elastic modulus distribution between 13.9 MPa to 26.5 GPa, with a mean of 5.2 ± 
7 GPa and median 1.03 GPa. Although chitin is the primary component of 
stiffness, variation of elasticity in the nanoscale suggests that resilin 
significantly affects the mechanical properties of single taenidia fibres (38% 
of total data). For indentations up to 400 nm, an intricate chitin-resilin 
response was observed, suggesting structural optimization between compliance and 
rigidity. Finite-element analysis on composite materials demonstrated that the 
Elastic modulus is sensitive to the percentage of resilin and chitin content, 
their location and structural configuration. Based on our results, we propose 
that the distinct moduli of taenidia fibres indicate sophisticated evolution 
with elasticity playing a key role in optimization. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: 
In crickets and bush-crickets, the foreleg tracheae have evolved into acoustic 
canals, which transport sound to the ears located on the tibia of each leg. 
Tracheae are held open by spiral cuticular micro-fibres called taenidia, which 
are the primary elements of mechanical reinforcement. We developed an AFM-based 
method to indent individual taenidia at the nanometre level, to quantify local 
mechanical properties of the interior acoustic canal of the bush-cricket 
Mecopoda elongata, a model species in hearing research. Taenidia fibres were 
immobilized on a hard substrate and the indenter directly approached the 
epicuticle surface. This is the first characterization of the nano-structure of 
unfixed tracheal taenidia, and should pave the way for further in vivo 
mechanical investigations of auditory structures.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered daily life on a global scale and 
has resulted in significant mortality with &gt;985,000 lives lost in the United 
States alone. Superimposed on the COVID-19 pandemic has been a concurrent 
worsening of longstanding urban gun violence. We sought to evaluate the impact 
attributable to these 2 major public health issues on the greater Louisville 
region as determined by years of potential life lost.
METHODS: Using the Collaborative Jefferson County Firearm Injury Database, all 
firearm injuries from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2021 were examined. The 
COVID-19 data was compiled from the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health 
and Wellness. Pre-COVID (March 1, 2019-February 29, 2020) and COVID (March 1, 
2020-February 28, 2021) time intervals were examined. The demographics, outcomes 
data, and years of potential life lost were determined for the groups, and 
injury locations were geocoded.
RESULTS: From 2011 to 2021, there were 6,043 firearm injuries in Jefferson 
County, Kentucky. During the COVID time interval, there were 4,574 years of 
potential life lost due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 9,722 years of potential 
life lost due to all-cause gun violence. In the pre-COVID time interval, there 
were 5,723 years of potential life lost due to all-cause gun violence.
CONCLUSION: In Louisville, greater years of potential life lost were 
attributable to firearm fatalities than the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Given the impact 
of COVID-19, the robust response has been proportionate and appropriate. The 
lack of response to firearm injury and fatality is striking in comparison. 
Additional resources to combat the sequelae of gun violence are needed.

BACKGROUND: Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a poorly recognised form 
of spinal cord injury which arises when degenerative changes in the cervical 
spine injure the spinal cord. Timely surgical intervention is critical to 
preventing disability. Despite this, DCM is frequently undiagnosed, and may be 
misconstrued as normal ageing. For a disease associated with age, we 
hypothesised that the elderly may represent an underdiagnosed population. This 
study aimed to evaluate this hypothesis by comparing age-stratified estimates of 
DCM prevalence based on spinal cord compression (SCC) data with 
hospital-diagnosed prevalence in the UK.
METHODS: We queried the UK Hospital Episode Statistics database for admissions 
with a primary diagnosis of DCM. Age-stratified incidence rates were calculated 
and extrapolated to prevalence by adjusting population-level life expectancy to 
the standardised mortality ratio of DCM. We compared these figures to estimates 
of DCM prevalence based on the published conversion rate of asymptomatic SCC to 
DCM.
RESULTS: The mean prevalence of DCM across all age groups was 0.19% (0.17, 
0.21), with a peak prevalence of 0.42% at age 50-54 years. This contrasts with 
estimates from SCC data which suggest a mean prevalence of 2.22% (0.436, 2.68) 
and a peak prevalence of 4.16% at age > 79 years.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the 
age-stratified prevalence of DCM and estimate underdiagnosis. There is a 
substantial difference between estimates of DCM prevalence derived from SCC data 
and UK hospital activity data. This is greatest amongst elderly populations, 
indicating a potential health inequality.

BACKGROUND: National projections of life expectancy are made periodically by 
statistical offices or actuarial societies in Europe and are widely used, 
amongst others for reforms of pension systems. However, these projections may 
not provide a good estimate of the future trends in life expectancy of different 
social-economic groups. The objective of this study is to provide insight in 
future trends in life expectancies for low, mid and high educated men and women 
living in the Netherlands.
METHODS: We used a three-layer Li and Lee model with data from neighboring 
countries to complement Dutch time series.
RESULTS: Our results point at further increases of life expectancy between age 
35 and 85 and of remaining life expectancy at age 35 and age 65, for all 
education groups in the Netherlands. The projected increase in life expectancy 
is slightly larger among the high educated than among the low educated. Life 
expectancy of low educated women, particularly between age 35 and 85, shows the 
smallest projected increase. Our results also suggest that inequalities in life 
expectancies between high and low educated will be similar or slightly 
increasing between 2018 and 2048. We see no indication of a decline in 
inequality between the life expectancy of the low and high educated.
CONCLUSIONS: The educational inequalities in life expectancy are expected to 
persist or slightly increase for both men and women. The persistence and 
possible increase of inequalities in life expectancy between the educational 
groups may cause equity concerns of increases in pension age that are equal 
among all socio-economic groups.

Multimorbidity relates to having multiple chronic health conditions. It is a 
risk factor for poor health and reduces life expectancy. Autistic people have 
multiple chronic health conditions and die prematurely, especially if they have 
an intellectual disability (autism spectrum disorder and intellectual 
disability). Certain pathophysiological processes observed in autism spectrum 
disorder are common to those related to the genesis and/or maintenance of 
multimorbidity. Furthermore, multimorbidity could be helpful in better 
identifying patient subgroups in autism spectrum disorder. It is therefore 
essential to better characterize multimorbidity and its consequences in the 
subgroup of autism spectrum disorder + intellectual disability individuals to 
offer them personalized care. We conducted a preliminary study of 63 autism 
spectrum disorder + intellectual disability adults to classify them according to 
their multimorbidity and search for a specific combination of chronic health 
conditions. We observed high and early multimorbidity in this sample and 
identified four classes of participants, distinguished by their multimorbidity 
status, independence and number of treatments. In addition, we observed a 
dominant combination of multimorbidity in our sample, combining immune 
dysfunction and gastrointestinal disorders, neurological and joint diseases. 
These findings support the hypothesis that an altered gut-brain relationship is 
involved in the risk of autism spectrum disorder, its outcome, and its 
association with chronic health conditions. Although larger studies are needed, 
our results suggest that subgroups of autism spectrum disorder + intellectual 
disability individuals can be identified based on their multimorbidity and 
potentially different ageing trajectories. A more comprehensive and personalized 
approach is needed to reduce the burden of multimorbidity and increase the 
quality of life and life expectancy in autism spectrum disorder/ intellectual 
disability.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of people with severe mental illness (SMI) is 
shorter than those without SMI, with multimorbidity and poorer physical health 
contributing to health inequality. Screening tools could potentially assist the 
optimisation of medicines to protect the physical health of people with SMI. The 
aim of our research was to design and validate a medicines optimisation tool 
(OPTIMISE) to help clinicians to optimise physical health in people with SMI.
METHODS: A review of existing published guidelines, PubMed and Medline was 
carried out. Literature was examined for medicines optimisation recommendations 
and also for reference to the management of physical illness in people with 
mental illness. Potential indicators were grouped according to physiological 
system. A multidisciplinary team with expertise in mental health and the 
development of screening tools agreed that 83 indicators should be included in 
the first draft of OPTIMISE. The Delphi consensus technique was used to develop 
and validate the contents. A 17-member multidisciplinary panel of experts from 
the UK and Ireland completed 2 rounds of Delphi consensus, rating their level of 
agreement to 83 prescribing indicators using a 5-point Likert scale. Indicators 
were accepted for inclusion in the OPTIMISE tool after achieving a median score 
of 1 or 2, where 1 indicated strongly agree and 2 indicated agree, and 75th 
centile value of ≤ 2. Interrater reliability was assessed among 4 clinicians 
across 20 datasets and the chance corrected level of agreement (kappa) was 
calculated. The kappa statistic was interpreted as poor if 0.2 or less, fair if 
0.21-0.4, moderate if 0.41-0.6, substantial if 0.61-0.8, and good if 0.81-1.0.
RESULTS: Consensus was achieved after 2 rounds of Delphi for 62 prescribing 
indicators where 53 indicators were accepted after round 1 and a further 9 
indicators were accepted after round 2. Interrater reliability of OPTIMISE 
between physicians and pharmacists indicated a substantial level of agreement 
with a kappa statistic of 0.75.
CONCLUSIONS: OPTIMISE is a 62 indicator medicines optimisation tool designed to 
assist decision making in those treating adults with SMI. It was developed using 
a Delphi consensus methodology and interrater reliability is substantial. 
OPTIMISE has the potential to improve medicines optimisation by ensuring 
preventative medicines are considered when clinically indicated. Further 
research involving the implementation of OPTIMISE is required to demonstrate its 
true benefit.

People do not only care about maximizing health gains but also about their 
distribution. For example, they give more weight to younger patients than older 
patients. This pilot study aims to investigate if age weighting is reinforced by 
loss aversion if young people are falling behind one's perceived 'normal' 
quality of life (QoL), while older people do not. We apply a person trade-off 
method in a large representative sample (n = 990) to estimate age weighting 
factors. We also measure QoL levels that individuals regard as 'normal' for 
different ages, serving as reference points. We observe a considerable amount of 
age weighting, with 20-year-old patients on average receiving 1.7 times as much 
weight as 80-year-old patients. Perceived 'normal' QoL rapidly decreases with 
age of a patient. Older people are more optimistic about what constitutes 
'normal QoL' than younger people, but they express a faster decline in normal 
QoL due to aging. Respondents who view all improvements to be gain enlarging 
show the least age weighting, but loss aversion cannot explain the results. 
Still, one's age-related reference level is an important predictor of age 
weights. Given the explorative nature of this study, further studies are called 
for to generate more robust evidence.

BACKGROUND: Overall life expectancy continues to rise, approaching 80 years of 
age in several developed countries. However, healthy life expectancy lags far 
behind, which has, in turn, contributed to increasing costs in healthcare. One 
way to improve health and attenuate the socio-economic impact of an aging 
population is to increase overall fitness through physical activity. Telomere 
attrition or shortening is a well-known molecular marker in aging. As such, 
several studies have focused on whether exercise influences health and aging 
through telomere biology. This systematic review examines the recent literature 
on the effect of physical activity on telomere length (TL) and/or telomerase 
activity as molecular markers of aging.
METHODS: A focused search was performed in the databases PubMed and Web of 
Science for retrieving relevant articles over the past ten years. The search 
contained the following keywords: exercise, sport, physical activity, fitness, 
sedentary, physical inactivity, telomere, telomere length, t/s ratio, and 
telomerase. PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were observed.
RESULTS: A total of 43 articles were identified and categorized into randomized 
controlled trials (RCT), observational or interventional studies. RCTs (n = 8) 
showed inconsistent findings of increased TL length with physical activity in, 
e.g. obese, post-menopausal women. In comparison with a predominantly sedentary 
lifestyle, observational studies (n = 27) showed significantly longer TL with 
exercise of moderate to vigorous intensity; however, there was no consensus on 
the duration and type of physical activity and training modality. Interventional 
studies (n = 8) also showed similar findings of significantly longer TL prior to 
exercise intervention; however, these studies had smaller numbers of enrolled 
participants (mostly of high-performance athletes), and the physical activities 
covered a range of exercise intensities and duration. Amongst the selected 
studies, aerobic training of moderate to vigorous intensity is most prevalent. 
For telomere biology analysis, TL was determined mainly from leukocytes using 
qPCR. In some cases, especially in RCT and interventional studies, different 
sample types such as saliva, sperm, and muscle biopsies were analyzed; different 
leukocyte cell types and potential genetic markers in regulating telomere 
biology were also investigated.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, physical activity with regular aerobic training of 
moderate to vigorous intensity appears to help preserve TL. However, the optimal 
intensity, duration of physical activity, as well as type of exercise still need 
to be further elucidated. Along with TL or telomerase activity, participants' 
fitness level, the type of physical activity, and training modality should be 
assessed at different time points in future studies, with the plan for long-term 
follow-up. Reducing the amount of sedentary behavior may have a positive effect 
of preserving and increasing TL. Further molecular characterization of telomere 
biology in different cell types and tissues is required in order to draw 
definitive causal conclusions on how physical activity affects TL and aging.

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential application of 
chitosan coatings incorporating epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) for preserving 
fillets of bighead carp during chilled storage. The fillets were coated with 
acetic acid and glycerol, chitosan, and chitosan-EGCG, respectively, and the 
changes in their physicochemical, microbiological, and sensory characteristics 
during storage at 4 °C were determined. Notably, total volatile basic nitrogen, 
thiobarbituric-acid-reactive substances, and K value of chitosan-EGCG coated 
fillets sampled on day 15 were 48.04 %, 60.19 %, and 32.91 % lower than 
untreated fillets, respectively. Microbial enumeration suggested that the 
inclusion of EGCG significantly improved the inhibitory effect of pure chitosan 
coating on the proliferation of microorganisms. Furthermore, the chitosan-EGCG 
coated fillets also performed the best in terms of color, texture, and sensory 
analysis, and extended the shelf-life of the fillets for at least 6 days. A 
principal component analysis further confirmed the preserving effect of the 
chitosan-EGCG coating. Mantel test results suggested that the fillets' 
organoleptic characteristics strongly correlated with physicochemical and 
microbiological indicators. Overall, this work provides an effective protocol 
for food quality control and the extension of shelf life during chilled storage, 
and it clarifies the relationships between organoleptic characteristics and 
physicochemical and microbiological indexes.

Objective: To summarize the experience of endoscopic endonasal approach in the 
treatment of anterior skull base with intra-extracranial extension meningioma, 
and to analyze the perioperative quality of life of patients, and to discuss the 
safety and efficacy of the treatment. Methods: A total of 83 cases of anterior 
skull base with intra-extracranial extension meningioma admitted to Xuanwu 
Hospital, Capital Medical University from October 2007 to October 2019, who 
underwent endoscopic endonasal approach tumor resection, were retrospectively 
analyzed. The quality of life of the patients were evaluated by Anterior Skull 
Base Questionnaire (ASBQ) before and after surgery. The surgical techniques, 
extent of tumor resection, postoperative complications and the changes of 
patients' quality of life were summarized and analyzed. SPSS 23.0 software was 
used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 57 anterior skull base with 
intra-extracranial extension meningioma patients were enrolled according to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, including 23 males and 34 females, aging 
(48.6±16.6) years. Fifty cases (87.7%) reached or exceeded Simpson gradeⅠ 
resection, and 7 cases underwent subtotal resection. Symptoms relief was as 
follows: headache relief in 45/50 (90%), vision improvement in 18/19 (94.7%), 
olfaction improvement in 6/45 (13.3%), mental symptoms improvement in 3/9 
(33.3%), and seizure relief in 5/7 (71.4%). Postoperative complication included 
mental symptoms in 5 cases, cerebrospinal fluid leakage in 2 cases, epilepsy in 
2 cases, frontal lobe hemorrhage in 1 case, and intracranial infection in 1 
case. The follow-up period was 38 to 144 months. There were two cases recurring 
and no death. ASBQ assessment showed significant improvement in general 
condition, physical function, role function, mood disorder, pain, vision 
impairment, and sleep disturbance at 1 month postoperatively, with continued 
improvement thereafter, and reached stable at 6 months postoperatively. 
Conclusion: Endoscopic endonasal approach surgery is able to achieve safe and 
effective tumor resection for anterior skull base intra-extracranial extension 
meningioma, and the quality of life of patients can be improved steadily.

BACKGROUND: Prior studies demonstrate associations between risk factors for 
obesity and related chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease) and features 
of the built environment. This is particularly true for rural populations, who 
have higher rates of obesity, cancer, and other chronic diseases than urban 
residents. There is also evidence linking health behaviors and outcomes to 
social factors such as social support, opposition, and norms. Thus, overlapping 
social networks that have a high degree of social capital and community 
cohesion, such as those found in rural communities, may be effective targets for 
introducing and maintaining healthy behaviors.
METHODS: This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the Change Club (CC) 
intervention, a civic engagement intervention for built environment change to 
improve health behaviors and outcomes for residents of rural communities. The CC 
intervention provides small groups of community residents (approximately 10-14 
people) with nutrition and physical activity lessons and stepwise built 
environment change planning workshops delivered by trained extension educators 
via in-person, virtual, or hybrid methods. We will conduct process, multilevel 
outcome, and cost evaluations of implementation of the CC intervention in a 
cluster randomized controlled trial in 10 communities across two states using a 
two-arm parallel design. Change in the primary outcome, American Heart 
Association's Life's Simple 7 composite cardiovascular health score, will be 
evaluated among CC members, their friends and family members, and other 
community residents and compared to comparable samples in control communities. 
We will also evaluate changes at the social/collective level (e.g., social 
cohesion, social trust) and examine costs as well as barriers and facilitators 
to implementation.
DISCUSSION: Our central hypothesis is the CC intervention will improve health 
behaviors and outcomes among engaged citizens and their family and friends 
within 24 months. Furthermore, we hypothesize that positive changes will 
catalyze critical steps in the pathway to improving longer-term health among 
community residents through improved healthy eating and physical activity 
opportunities. This study also represents a unique opportunity to evaluate 
process and cost-related data, which will provide key insights into the 
viability of this approach for widespread dissemination.

BACKGROUND: With the optimization of medical care structures and the rapid 
progress in the development of new therapeutic methods, an increase in life 
expectancy is observed in patients with neuromuscular diseases. This leads to an 
expansion of the phenotypic spectrum, whereby new or previously less relevant 
disease manifestations in different organ systems gain more importance. The care 
of adolescents and young adults with neuromuscular diseases, therefore, requires 
increasingly close interdisciplinary collaboration within neuromuscular centers.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How can the transition process from pediatric to adult care 
be structured so that the individual disciplines are efficiently integrated into 
the complex treatment and care process, and the patients' quality of life is 
improved?
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A structured transition process was established at the 
University Hospital in Essen, Germany. Exemplarily, a comparable care concept 
was developed based on Pompe disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and juvenile 
myasthenia gravis comprising four elements: (1) With the introduction of 
cross-department standard operating procedures, the logistical processes, as 
well as the diagnostic and therapeutic measures, are uniformly coordinated, and 
the transition process is bindingly defined. (2) To ensure a seamless 
transition, young patients are seen with their parents during joint 
consultations before they reach their 17th birthday. This creates an opportunity 
for patients to get to know the subsequent department structure and build a 
lasting relationship of trust. (3) A quarterly "transition board" regularly 
brings together the participating disciplines from pediatric and adult care 
systems for a case-related interdisciplinary exchange and continuous 
optimization of the transition process. (4) A cross-department "Transition 
Database", in which medical findings and parameters are recorded, was 
implemented as a common information platform and database.
CONCLUSION: The Essen Transition Model aims to close the gap in care for young 
patients with neuromuscular diseases during the critical transition from 
pediatric to adult medicine and to create a successful continuation of treatment 
in adulthood.

the United States, 1990-2017.

Mortality disparities between urban and rural areas in the United States widened 
in recent decades as mortality improvements in rural areas slowed. Although the 
existence of a rural mortality penalty is well-documented, previous research in 
this area has focused almost exclusively on differences in average levels of 
mortality between rural and urban areas rather than differences in levels of 
lifespan variation within rural and urban areas. This oversight is important 
because monitoring trends in lifespan variation provides unique insights into 
levels of inequality in the age-at-death distribution within a population. Does 
the rural mortality penalty in life expectancy extend to lifespan variation? We 
used U.S. Multiple Cause of Death data files to measure life disparity at birth 
( e0† ) from 1990 to 2017. We found that the rural mortality penalty extends to 
lifespan variation as large metropolitan areas had greater improvements in life 
disparity than nonmetropolitan areas. Beginning around 2011, all areas began to 
show increased life disparity with the largest increases occurring in 
nonmetropolitan areas. Age decomposition results showed that the nonmetropolitan 
increases were due to rising working-age mortality. Greater variability in the 
age-at-death distribution represents an additional dimension of inequality for 
Americans living in rural places.

Aberrant DNA methylation in multiple myeloma: A major obstacle or an 
opportunity?

Drug resistance (DR) of cancer cells leading to relapse is a huge problem 
nowadays to achieve long-lasting cures for cancer patients. This also holds true 
for the incurable hematological malignancy multiple myeloma (MM), which is 
characterized by the accumulation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow 
(BM). Although new treatment approaches combining immunomodulatory drugs, 
corticosteroids, proteasome inhibitors, alkylating agents, and monoclonal 
antibodies have significantly improved median life expectancy, MM remains 
incurable due to the development of DR, with the underlying mechanisms remaining 
largely ill-defined. It is well-known that MM is a heterogeneous disease, 
encompassing both genetic and epigenetic aberrations. In normal circumstances, 
epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and posttranslational 
histone modifications, play an important role in proper chromatin structure and 
transcriptional regulation. However, in MM, numerous epigenetic defects or 
so-called 'epimutations' have been observed and this especially at the level of 
DNA methylation. These include genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, locus specific 
hypermethylation and somatic mutations, copy number variations and/or 
deregulated expression patterns in DNA methylation modifiers and regulators. The 
aberrant DNA methylation patterns lead to reduced gene expression of tumor 
suppressor genes, genomic instability, DR, disease progression, and high-risk 
disease. In addition, the frequency of somatic mutations in the DNA methylation 
modifiers seems increased in relapsed patients, again suggesting a role in DR 
and relapse. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in understanding the 
involvement of aberrant DNA methylation patterns and/or DNA methylation 
modifiers in MM development, progression, and relapse. In addition, we discuss 
their involvement in MM cell plasticity, driving myeloma cells to a cancer stem 
cell state characterized by a more immature and drug-resistant phenotype. 
Finally, we briefly touch upon the potential of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors 
to prevent relapse after treatment with the current standard of care agents 
and/or new, promising (immuno) therapies.

Objective: Despite the use of surgical and chemoradiation therapies, head and 
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) still has a poor prognosis. Immune 
checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to prolong life expectancy but have 
limited efficacy. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) has 
received significant attention in breast cancer treatment, in which it has been 
associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT); however, the function of GPNMB in HNSCC is completely unknown. This study 
aimed to clarify the characteristics of GPNMB-positive cells in vitro and their 
association with the prognosis by immunostaining clinical specimens. Methods: We 
examined the sphere formation, invasion, and migration ability of GPNMB-positive 
cells in four HNSCC cell lines in vitro. We also immunostained biopsy specimens 
with GPNMB from 174 patients with HNSCC diagnosed, treated, and followed-up in 
our institution to evaluate overall survival and progression-free survival. 
Results: GPNMB-positive cells showed enhanced sphere formation, invasion, and 
migration, suggesting that they could have CSC characteristics and the ability 
to induce EMT, as reported for breast cancer. Clinical specimens showed that 
overall survival was 39.4% and 57.8% (p = 0.045) and that progression-free 
survival was 27.6% and 51.6% (p = 0.013) for the high-expression and the 
low-expression groups, respectively, indicating poor prognosis for the high 
GPNMB group. The high GPNMB group was also more resistant to chemoradiation and 
bioradiotherapy. GPNMB was more highly expressed in metastatic lymph nodes than 
in the primary tumor. Conclusion: GPNMB-positive cells might have CSC 
characteristics and induce EMT. Detailed functional analyses of GPNMB in HNSCC 
and the establishment of therapies targeting GPNMB will lead to improved 
prognoses.

Background: Although the management of the lumbar disease is highly dependent on 
the severity of the patient's condition, optimal surgical techniques to reduce 
the risk of adjacent degeneration disease (ADS) remain elusive. Based on in 
vitro biomechanical tests of the cadaver spine, this study aimed to 
comparatively analyze the kinematic responses of the spine with dynamic and 
rigid fixations (i.e., Coflex fixation and posterolateral fusion) after 
single-or double-level lumbar fusion in daily activities. Methods: Six human 
lumbar specimens (L1-S1) were selected for this experiment, and the sagittal 
parameters of each lumbar specimen were measured in the 3D model. The specimens 
were successively reconstructed into five groups of models: intact model, 
single-level L4-5 Coflex fixation model, single-level L4-5 Fusion (posterior 
pedicle screw fixation) model, double-level L4-5 Coflex + L5-S1 Fusion model;
