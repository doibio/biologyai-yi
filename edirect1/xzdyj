BACKGROUND: Plant organelles are highly motile where their movement is 
significant for fast distribution of material around the cell, facilitation of 
the plant's ability to respond to abiotic and biotic signals, and for 
appropriate growth. Abiotic and biotic stresses are among the major factors 
limiting crop yields, and biological membranes are the first target of these 
stresses. Plants utilize adaptive mechanisms namely myosin to repair injured 
membranes following exposure to abiotic and biotic stresses.
OBJECTIVE: Due to the economic importance and cultivation of potato grown under 
abiotic and biotic stress prone areas, identification and characterization of 
myosin family members in potato were performed in the present research.
METHODS: To identify the myosin genes in potato, we performed genome-wide 
analysis of myosin genes in the S. tuberosum genome using the phytozome. All 
putative sequences were approved with the interproscan. Bioinformatics analysis 
was conducted using phylogenetic tree, gene structure, cis-regulatory elements, 
protein-protein interaction, and gene expression.
RESULT: The majority of the cell machinery contain actin cytoskeleton and 
myosins, where motility of organelles are dependent on them. Homology-based 
analysis was applied to determine seven myosin genes in the potato genome. The 
members of myosin could be categorized into two groups (XI and VIII). Some of 
myosin proteins were sub-cellularly located in the nucleus containing 71.5% of 
myosin proteins and other myosin proteins were localized in the mitochondria, 
plasma-membrane, and cytoplasm. Determination of co-expressed network, promoter 
analysis, and gene structure were also performed and gene expression pattern of 
each gene was surveyed. Number of introns in the gene family members varied from 
1 to 39. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that StMyoXI-B and StMyoVIII-2 
had the highest transcripts, induced by biotic and abiotic stresses in all three 
tissues of stem, root, and leaves, respectively. Overall, different cis-elements 
including abiotic and biotic responsive, hormonal responsive, light responsive, 
defense responsive elements were found in the myosin promoter sequences. Among 
the cis-elements, the MYB, G-box, ABRE, JA, and SA contributed the most in the 
plant growth and development, and in response to abiotic and biotic stress 
conditions.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that myosin genes can be utilized in breeding 
programs and genetic engineering of plants with the aim of increasing tolerance 
to abiotic and biotic stresses, especially to viral stresses such as PVY, PVX, 
PVA, PVS, high light, drought, cold and heat.

Since the establishment of the modern prison system in the early nineteenth 
century, prisons and prisoners have been construed as sites of moral, social, 
and biological contagion. Historic and contemporary studies show that most 
prisoners experience severe health inequalities, higher rates of addiction and 
mental health issues, and lower life expectancy than the rest of the population. 
They also come from deprived social strata. Yet, these aspects of Irish penal 
history have been largely neglected in academia and popular histories. Our 
article discusses two public history projects-an art installation, The Trial, 
and a museum exhibition, Living Inside-that engaged different publics with the 
long history of health and welfare in Irish prisons. Developed by the research 
team on the Wellcome Trust Investigator Award "Prisoners, Medical Care and 
Entitlement to Health in England and Ireland, 1850-2000," based at University 
College Dublin, the projects adopted different methodologies to engage their 
audiences and explore the experience and management of health and welfare in 
nineteenth- and twentieth-century Irish prisons. We further examine the 
different methodological approaches of each project, their varied aims and 
audiences, and the impacts reported by audiences and participants. The article 
also considers some of the challenges of doing this kind of public history, both 
in terms of working with marginalized communities and presenting research about 
difficult subjects to various audiences.

INTRODUCTION: This study compared the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the ravulizumab 
on-body delivery system for subcutaneous (SUBQ) administration with intravenous 
(IV) ravulizumab in eculizumab-experienced patients with paroxysmal nocturnal 
hemoglobinuria (PNH).
METHODS: Patients with PNH received SUBQ ravulizumab (n = 90) or IV ravulizumab 
(n = 46) during the 10-week randomized treatment period; all patients then 
received SUBQ ravulizumab during an extension period (< 172 weeks; data cutoff 
1 year). Primary endpoint was day 71 serum ravulizumab trough concentration 
(Ctrough). Secondary endpoints were ravulizumab Ctrough and free C5 over time. 
Efficacy endpoints included change in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), breakthrough 
hemolysis (BTH), transfusion avoidance, stabilized hemoglobin, and Treatment 
Administration Satisfaction Questionnaire (TASQ) score. Safety, including 
adverse events (AEs) and adverse device effects (ADEs), was assessed until data 
cutoff.
RESULTS: SUBQ ravulizumab demonstrated PK non-inferiority with IV ravulizumab 
(day 71 SUBQ/IV geometric least-squares means ratio 1.257 [90% confidence 
interval 1.160-1.361; p < 0.0001]). Through 1 year of SUBQ administration, 
ravulizumab Ctrough values were > 175 μg/mL (PK threshold) and free 
C5 < 0.5 μg/mL (PD threshold). Efficacy endpoints remained stable: mean 
(standard deviation, SD) LDH percentage change was 0.9% (20.5%); BTH events, 
5/128 patients (3.9%); 83.6% achieved transfusion avoidance; 79.7% achieved 
stabilized hemoglobin. Total TASQ score showed improved satisfaction with SUBQ 
ravulizumab compared with IV eculizumab (mean [SD] change at SUBQ day 351, 
- 69.3 [80.1]). The most common AEs during SUBQ treatment (excluding ADEs) were 
headache (14.1%), COVID-19 (14.1%), and pyrexia (10.9%); the most common ADE 
unrelated to a device product issue was injection site reaction (4.7%). Although 
many patients had ≥ 1 device issue-related ADE, full SUBQ dose administration 
was achieved in 99.9% of attempts.
CONCLUSIONS: SUBQ ravulizumab provides an additional treatment choice for 
patients with PNH. Patients may switch to SUBQ ravulizumab from IV eculizumab or 
ravulizumab without loss of efficacy.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03748823.

Plain Language Summary: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare 
blood disorder characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis) 
within blood vessels. In addition to hemolysis, patients with PNH are 
susceptible to life-threatening blood clots (thromboses). Eculizumab and 
ravulizumab are types of treatments for PNH, called C5 inhibitors. In the blood, 
these treatments bind to C5 protein and prevent the destruction of red blood 
cells, reducing the symptoms and complications of PNH. Both treatments are 
approved for use via intravenous (through the vein) administration. Ravulizumab 
is also approved in the USA for use via subcutaneous (under the skin) 
administration. This study compared subcutaneous ravulizumab with intravenous 
ravulizumab in patients with PNH who had previously been treated with 
eculizumab. During the initial treatment period of 71 days, 90 patients received 
subcutaneous ravulizumab and 46 received intravenous ravulizumab. Following this 
period, all patients received subcutaneous ravulizumab. At day 71, the amount of 
ravulizumab in the blood of patients taking subcutaneous ravulizumab was no less 
than in patients taking intravenous ravulizumab and was maintained over 1 year 
of treatment. Efficacy measures (how well it works) remained stable in patients 
taking subcutaneous ravulizumab for 1 year and side effects were comparable with 
those of intravenous ravulizumab. Patients reported more satisfaction with 
subcutaneous ravulizumab than intravenous eculizumab, as assessed by the 
Treatment Administration Satisfaction Questionnaire. This study showed that 
patients with PNH can switch from intravenous eculizumab or ravulizumab to 
subcutaneous ravulizumab without loss of efficacy. Subcutaneous ravulizumab 
provides an additional treatment choice for patients with PNH.

Efforts have been devoted for the discovery and development of positive 
allosteric modulators (PAMs) of 5-HT2CR because of their potential advantages 
over the orthosteric agonist like Lorcaserin that was withdrawn from the market. 
On the other hand, pursuing a positive ago-allosteric modulator (PAAM) is 
considered as beneficial particularly when an agonist is not capable of 
affecting the potency of the endogenous agonist sufficiently. In search of a 
suitable PAAM of 5-HT2CR we adopted an in silico based approach that indicated 
the potential of the 3-(1-hydroxycycloalkyl) substituted isoquinolin-1-one 
derivatives against the 5-HT2CR as majority of these molecules interacted with 
the site other than that of Lorcaserin with superior docking scores. These 
compounds along with the regioisomeric 3-methyleneisoindolin-1-one derivatives 
were prepared via the Cu(OAc)2 catalyzed coupling of 2-iodobenzamide with 
1-ethynylcycloalkanol under ultrasound irradiation. According to the in vitro 
studies, most of these compounds were not only found to be potent and selective 
agonists but also emerged as PAAM of 5-HT2CR whereas Lorcaserin did not show 
PAAM activities. According to the SAR study the isoquinolin-1(2H)-ones appeared 
as better PAAM than isoindolin-1-ones whereas the presence of hydroxyl group 
appeared to be crucial for the activity. With the potent PAAM activity for 
5-HT2CR (EC50 = 1 nM) and 107 and 86-fold selectivity towards 5-HT2C over 5-HT2A 
and 5-HT2B the compound 4i was identified as a hit molecule. The compound showed 
good stability in male BALB/c mice brain homogenate (∼85 % remaining after 2 h), 
moderate stability in the presence of rat liver microsomes (42 % remaining after 
1 h) and acceptable PK properties with fast reaching in the brain 
maintaining ∼ 1:1 brain/plasma concentration ratio. The compound at a dose of 
50 mg/kg exhibited decreased trend in the food intake starting from day 3 in 
S.D. rats, which reached significant by 5th day, and the effect was comparable 
to Lorcaserin (10 mg/kg) on day 5. Thus, being the first example of PAAM of 
5-HT2CR the compound 4i is of further medicinal interest.

AIMS: During the progress of oncological diseases, there is an increased 
probability that spinal metastases may develop, requiring personalised treatment 
options. Risk calculator systems aim to provide assistance in the therapeutic 
decision-making process by estimating survival chances. The predictive ability 
of such calculators can be improved, thereby optimising the choice of 
personalised therapy. The aim of this research was to create a new risk 
assessment system and show a method with which other centres can develop their 
own local score.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created a database by retrospectively processing 454 
patients. The prognostic factors were selected via a network science-based 
correlation analysis that maximises Uno's C-index, keeping only a small number 
of predictors. To validate the new system, we calculated the D-statistic, the 
Integrated Discrimination Index, made a five-fold cross-validation and also 
calculated the integrated time-dependent Brier score.
RESULTS: As a result of multivariate Cox analysis, we found five independent 
prognostic factors suitable for the design of the risk calculator. This new 
system has a better predictive ability compared with six other well-known 
systems with an average C-index of 0.706 at 10 years (95% confidence interval 
0.679-0.733).
CONCLUSIONS: An accurate estimation of the life expectancy of cancer patients is 
essential for the implementation of personalised medicine. The training 
performance of our system is encouraging, indicating the benefit of a network 
science-based visualisation step. We believe that in order to further improve 
the prediction ability, it is necessary to systematise previously 'unknown' 
factors (e.g. radiological morphology).

An antenatal pertussis vaccination programme was introduced in 2012 in the UK in 
the context of a national outbreak of pertussis. It has been shown that a lower 
antibody response to primary immunisation can be seen for certain pertussis 
antigens in infants born to women who received pertussis-containing antenatal 
vaccines, a phenomenon known as blunting. The longer-term impact of this has not 
been documented previously, and accordingly was evaluated in this study. 
Children were predominantly recruited from a previous study in which their 
mothers had received acellular pertussis-containing antenatal vaccines 
(dTaP3-IPV [diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, three antigen acellular pertussis 
and inactivated polio] or dTaP5-IPV [diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, five 
antigen acellular pertussis and inactivated polio]), or no pertussis-containing 
vaccine. Blood samples were obtained prior to and one month after the acellular 
pertussis-containing preschool booster (dTaP5-IPV) was given at around age 
3 years 4 months. Pre- and post-booster immunoglobulin G (IgG) geometric mean 
concentrations (GMCs) against pertussis toxin, filamentous haemagglutinin, 
fimbriae 2 & 3, and pertactin, were compared. Prior to the receipt of the 
preschool booster, there was no difference in the IgG GMCs against 
pertussis-specific antigens between children born to women vaccinated with 
dTaP3-IPV and dTaP5-IPV; however, IgG GMCs against pertussis toxin were 
significantly lower in children born to women vaccinated with dTaP3-IPV compared 
with children born to unvaccinated women (geometric mean ratio 0.42 [95 % CI 
0.22-0.78], p = 0.03). One month after the receipt of the preschool booster 
there was no differences between the groups. The blunting effect of antenatal 
pertussis vaccine on pertussis responses in children can persist until preschool 
age, although it is overcome by the administration of a booster dose.

INTRODUCTION: There is an increasing incidence of cancer in older people, but 
limited data on radiotherapy uptake, and in particular, radiotherapy utilisation 
(RTU) rates. The RTU rate for older adults with cancer may be lower than 
recommended due to lower tolerance for radiotherapy as well as additional 
comorbidities, reduced life expectancy and travel for treatment. Radiotherapy 
use must be aligned with best available, age-specific evidence to ensure older 
adults with cancer receive optimal benefit without harms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to synthesise the 
published data on the actual RTU rate for patients with cancer as a function of 
age. MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched to identify relevant 
population-based and hospital-based cohort studies on radiotherapy utilisation 
for all age groups, published in English, from 1 January 1990 to 1 July 2020. We 
focused on the following common cancers in older adults for which radiotherapy 
is recommended: breast, prostate, lung, rectal cancer, glioblastoma multiforme 
(GBM), and cervical cancer. Age-specific radiotherapy utilisation data were 
extracted and analysed as a narrative synthesis.
RESULTS: From 2606 studies screened, 75 cohort and population-based studies were 
identified with age-specific radiotherapy utilisation data. The total number of 
patients in the 75 studies was 4,792,138. The RTU rate decreased with increasing 
age for all tumour sites analysed, except for patients receiving curative 
radiotherapy as definitive treatment for prostate or cervical cancer. This 
reduction with increasing age was demonstrated in both palliative and curative 
settings.
DISCUSSION: There is a global reduction in radiotherapy utilisation with 
increasing age for most tumour sites. The reduction in delivery of radiotherapy 
warrants further examination and evidence-based guidelines specific to this 
population.

BACKGROUND: Results and durability of aortic valve replacement in aortic 
stenosis are well known, but no study has focused on the results of aortic valve 
replacement in aortic insufficiency.
AIM: The aim of this retrospective study was to describe our mid-term outcomes 
after aortic valve replacement for aortic insufficiency.
METHODS: All consecutive adult patients who underwent bioprosthetic aortic valve 
replacement for aortic insufficiency at two European centres (in France and 
Germany) between May 2005 and December 2020 were analysed.
RESULTS: During the study period, 289 patients were included. Mean age was 
56.9±12.5 years. Overall operative mortality was 1.5%, and the 10-year survival 
estimate rate was 75.0%, which was significantly lower than in the age- and 
sex-matched general population, with a standardized mortality ratio of 2.88 (95% 
confidence interval 1.96-4.08; P<0001). Freedom from aortic valve-related death 
was 87.6%, and from aortic valve-related reoperation was 87.4%. No patient 
aged>60 years was reoperated on during follow-up. Freedom from severe structural 
valve deterioration at 10 years was 73.3%, and freedom from moderate structural 
valve deterioration at 10 years was 50.3%. Freedom from major adverse 
valve-related events at 10 years was 69.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Although bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement for aortic 
insufficiency shows good early results, 10-year mortality and major adverse 
valve-related event rates in young patients may be a concern, with a reduction 
in life expectancy compared with the general population.

The Late Cretaceous orogeny followed by the Eocene collision of the Adriatic 
with the European plate dissected the Northern Calcareous Alps (NCA) by a number 
of well-studied strike-slip fault systems accommodating N-S shortening and E-W 
stretching. However, the post-Miocene fault activity is poorly constrained due 
to lack of Neogene faulted sediments, and glacial erosion of geomorphic 
indicators. Using the protected environment of caves, we fill the knowledge gap 
in the post-Miocene evolution of the NCA by paleostress analysis of 172 
reactivated faults that offset passages in 28 caves near major faults. 
Constrained maximum age of caves, our results indicate that the NCA have been 
subjected to N to NE trending compression since Pliocene. Faulted speleothems 
dated with 230Th/U method, indicate that the recorded present-day stress state 
did not significantly change during the last 0.5 Ma. In contrast to the 
previously proposed post-Miocene N-S extension of NCA, but in agreement with 
what was observed in Vienna and Pannonian basins, we conclude that the eastward 
extrusion resulting from N-S convergence has continued despite a distinct 
slowdown of plate tectonic velocities in the late Miocene. The N-S extension 
affected only the Alpine front during Pliocene Molasse basin inversion, while at 
the scale of the Alpine orogen the NCA underwent successive N-S shortening and 
E-W stretching.

BACKGROUND: The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends 25 primary 
preventive services for middle-aged adults, but it can be difficult to do them 
all.
METHODS: The Personalized Disease Prevention (PDP) cluster-randomized clinical 
trial will evaluate whether patients and their providers benefit from an 
evidence-based decision tool to prioritize preventive services based on their 
potential to improve quality-adjusted life expectancy. The decision tool will be 
individualized for patient risk factors and available in the electronic health 
record. This Phase III trial seeks to enroll 60 primary care providers 
(clusters) and 600 patients aged 40-75 years. Half of providers will be assigned 
to an intervention to utilize the decision tool with approximately 10 patients 
each, and half will be assigned to usual care. Mixed-methods follow-up will 
include collection of preventive care utilization from electronic health 
records, patient and physician surveys, and qualitative interviews. We 
hypothesize that quality-adjusted life expectancy will increase by more in 
patients who receive the intervention, as compared with controls.
DISCUSSION: PDP will test a novel, holistic approach to help patients and 
providers prioritize the delivery of preventive services, based on patient risk 
factors in the electronic health record.

BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP) can 
have neuropathic pain that significantly impacts quality of life. Oral 
neuropathic pain medication often has insufficient pain relief and side effects. 
Topical phenytoin cream could circumvent these limitations. The primary 
objectives of this trial are to evaluate (1) efficacy in pain reduction and (2) 
safety of phenytoin cream in patients with painful CIAP. The main secondary 
objective is to explore the usefulness of a double-blind placebo-controlled 
response test (DOBRET) to identify responders to sustained pain relief with 
phenytoin cream.
METHODS: This 6-week, enriched enrollment randomized double-blind, 
placebo-controlled triple cross-over trial compares phenytoin 20%, 10% and 
placebo cream in 48 participants with painful CIAP. Enriched enrollment is based 
on a positive DOBRET in 48 participants who experience within 30 minutes ≥2 
points pain reduction on the 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) in the 
phenytoin 10% cream applied area and ≥1 point difference in pain reduction on 
the NRS between phenytoin 10% and placebo cream applied area, in favour of the 
former. To explore whether DOBRET has predictive value for sustained pain 
relief, 24 DOBRET-negative participants will be included. An open-label 
extension phase is offered with phenytoin 20% cream for up to one year, to study 
long-term safety. The main inclusion criteria are a diagnosis of CIAP and 
symmetrical neuropathic pain with a mean weekly pain score of ≥4 and <10 on the 
NRS. The primary outcome is the mean difference between phenytoin 20% versus 
placebo cream in 7-day average pain intensity, as measured by the NRS, over week 
2 in DOBRET positive participants. Key secondary outcomes include the mean 
difference in pain intensity between phenytoin 10% and phenytoin 20% cream, and 
between phenytoin 10% and placebo cream. Furthermore, differences between the 3 
interventions will be evaluated on the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory, 
EuroQol EQ5-5D-5L, and evaluation of adverse events.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence on the efficacy and safety of 
phenytoin cream in patients with painful CIAP and will give insight into the 
usefulness of DOBRET as a way of personalized medicine to identify responders to 
sustained pain relief with phenytoin cream.

An increasing proportion of cancer patients remains permanently tumorfree after 
primary care due to modern curative treatments. However, the life expectancy and 
quality of life deteriorate significantly in most relapsed cases in spite of 
different palliative therapies. To detect the early relapse in asymptomatic 
stage, patients undergo a preplanned care process, targeting primarily their 
improved survival. Several studies and reviews have been conducted in recent 
decades to determine the optimal and rational frequency and methods of control 
examinations. The data of different followup strategies were analyzed from 
several perspectives. Recommended followup protocols differ significantly based 
on the origin, histological characteristics, stage, prognostic factors and 
typical sites of recurrences, such as local, “oligometastatic” or systemic 
relapse of tumors. In addition to the detection of recurrence, the importance of 
qual ity of life, monitoring of psychological status and psychosomatic 
complaints as well as the costeffectiveness of protocols also came to the focus. 
Involving family doctors or qualified nurses in routine oncology followup may 
function as an alternative option to reducing the workload of specialists. The 
COVID–19 pandemic resulted in the use of telemedicine methods in the evaluation 
of examinations and followup strategies coming to the fore, while at the same 
time this made the reevaluation of control care algorithms even more important. 
In this paper, we review the results of studies comparing the different followup 
strategies, highlighting which protocols help to optimize the use of health care 
capacity while preserving the survival chance of cancer patients in relapse.

Publisher: A modern kuratív célú kezelések eredményeként a daganatos betegek 
egyre nagyobb része a primer ellátást követően tartósan tumormentes marad. A 
kiújulással érintettek többségének életkilátása és életminősége azonban 
jelentősen romlik a palliatív kezelések ellenére is. A relapsus tünetmentes 
stádiumban történő, korai észlelése érdekében a betegek előre tervezett 
gondozási folyamatban vesznek részt, amelynek elsődleges célja a túlélés 
javítása. Az ellenőrző vizsgálatok optimális és racionális gyakoriságának és 
eszközeinek evidenciaalapú meghatározására az utóbbi évtizedekben számos 
vizsgálat és átfogó tanulmány született, amelyekben több szempontból is 
elemezték az utánkövetési stratégiákat. Az ajánlott gondozási protokollok 
jelentősen különböznek a daganatok eredete, szövettani jellemzői, stádiuma, 
prognosztikai faktorai, illetve lokális, „oligometasztatikus” vagy szisztémás 
relapsusra való hajlama alapján. A recidíva észlelésének célján túl előtérbe 
került az életminőség, a pszichés status, a pszichoszomatikus panaszok 
monitorozásának, illetve a protokollok költséghatékonyságának jelentősége is. A 
szakorvosi leterheltség csökkentésére alternatív megoldás lehet a családorvos 
vagy képzett szakszemélyzet bevonása a rutin onkológiai gondozásba. A 
COVID–19-pandémia a telemedicinális leletértékelést és gondozási gyakorlatot 
hozta előtérbe, ami újabb indoka a gondozási algoritmusok újraértékelésének. A 
közleményben a gondozási stratégiákat összehasonlító tanulmányok eredményeit 
tekintjük át, az ezek alapján kialakított racionalizált gondozási protokollok az 
egészségügyi kapacitások optimális kihasználását segítik, megőrizve a relapsusba 
kerülő betegek túlélési esélyét. Orv Hetil. 2022; 163(43): 1704–1712.

BACKGROUND: Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a common urological disease 
affecting older men worldwide, but comprehensive data about the global, 
regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia and its trends 
over time are scarce. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we estimated global trends in, and prevalence of, 
benign prostatic hyperplasia and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to 
benign prostatic hyperplasia, in 21 regions and 204 countries and territories 
from 2000 to 2019.
METHODS: This study was conducted with GBD 2019 analytical and modelling 
strategies. Primary prevalence data came from claims from three countries and 
from hospital inpatient encounters from 45 locations. A Bayesian meta-regression 
modelling tool, DisMod-MR version 2.1, was used to estimate the age-specific, 
location-specific, and year-specific prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia. 
Age-standardised prevalence was calculated by the direct method using the GBD 
reference population. Years lived with disability (YLDs) due to benign prostatic 
hyperplasia were estimated by multiplying the disability weight by the 
symptomatic proportion of the prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia. 
Because we did not estimate years of life lost associated with benign prostatic 
hyperplasia, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) equalled YLDs. The final 
estimates were compared across Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintiles. The 95% 
uncertainty intervals (UIs) were estimated as the 25th and 975th of 1000 ordered 
draws from a bootstrap distribution.
FINDINGS: Globally, there were 94·0 million (95% UI 73·2 to 118) prevalent cases 
of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 2019, compared with 51·1 million (43·1 to 
69·3) cases in 2000. The age-standardised prevalence of benign prostatic 
hyperplasia was 2480 (1940 to 3090) per 100 000 people. Although the global 
number of prevalent cases increased by 70·5% (68·6 to 72·7) between 2000 and 
2019, the global age-standardised prevalence remained stable (-0·770% [-1·56 to 
0·0912]). The age-standardised prevalence in 2019 ranged from 6480 (5130 to 
8080) per 100 000 in eastern Europe to 987 (732 to 1320) per 100 000 in north 
Africa and the Middle East. All five SDI quintiles observed an increase in the 
absolute DALY burden between 2000 and 2019. The most rapid increases in the 
absolute DALY burden were seen in the middle SDI quintile (94·7% [91·8 to 
97·6]), the low-middle SDI quintile (77·3% [74·1 to 81·2]), and the low SDI 
quintile (77·7% [72·9 to 83·2]). Between 2000 and 2019, age-standardised DALY 
rates changed less, but the three lower SDI quintiles (low, low-middle, and 
middle) saw small increases, and the two higher SDI quintiles (high and 
high-middle SDI) saw small decreases.
INTERPRETATION: The absolute burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia is rising at 
an alarming rate in most of the world, particularly in low-income and 
middle-income countries that are currently undergoing rapid demographic and 
epidemiological changes. As more people are living longer worldwide, the 
absolute burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia is expected to continue to rise 
in the coming years, highlighting the importance of monitoring and planning for 
future health system strain.

Microplastics are ubiquitous in the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem, 
increasingly becoming a serious concern for aquatic organism health. However, 
information regarding the effects of microplastics on cephalopods is remain 
limited to date. Amphioctopus fangsiao, an important economic species in 
cephalopods, can serve as a potential indicator of environmental pollution due 
to its short life expectancy and high metabolic rates. Here, to explore the 
toxic effects during the microplastic stress response, we analyzed the growth 
performance, histopathological damage, oxidative stress biomarkers, metabolomic 
and transcriptomic response in digestive gland of A. fangsiao under different 
concentrations (0, 100 and 1000 μg/L) of commercial polystyrene microplastics 
(MPS) exposure (5 μm, sphere) for 21 days. The results showed that MPS exerted a 
huge influence on the growth performance of A. fangsiao. The oxidative stress 
and inflammation in digestive gland of A. fangsiao were also detected after 
exposure to MPS. In addition, most of the altered metabolites observed in the 
metabolic analysis were related to inflammation, oxidative stress and glucolipid 
metabolism. Transcriptome analysis detected the differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) and the significantly enriched KEGG pathways associated with glycolipid 
metabolism, inflammation and DNA damage. Collectively, our results indicate that 
excessive environmental microplastic exposure will cause toxicity damage and 
then initiate the detoxification mechanism in A. fangsiao digestive gland to 
maintain homeostasis. This study revealed that microplastic can cause adverse 
consequences on cephalopods, providing novel insights into the toxicological 
effect of microplastic exposure.

Dystroglycan (DG), which constitutes a part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein 
complex, connects the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton. The matriglycans 
presented by the extracellular α-DG serve as a contact point with extracellular 
matrix proteins (ECM) containing laminin G-like domains, providing cellular 
stability. However, it remains unknown whether core M1 (GlcNAcβ1-2Man) 
structures can serve as ligands among the various O-Mannosylated glycans. 
Therefore, based on the presence of N-acetylLactosamine (LacNAc) in this glycan 
following the core extension, the binding interactions with 
adhesion/growth-regulatory galectins were explored. To elucidate this process, 
the interaction between galectin (Gal)-1, -3, -4 and -9 with α-DG fragment 
372TRGAIIQTPTLGPIQPTRV390 core M1-based glycopeptide library were profiled, 
using glycan microarray and nuclear magnetic resonance studies. The binding of 
galectins was revealed irrespective of its modular architecture, adding 
galectins to the list of possible binding partners of α-DG core M1 
glycoconjugates by cis-binding (via peptide- and carbohydrate-protein 
interactions), which can be abrogated by α2,3-sialylation of the LacNAc units. 
The LacNAc-terminated α-DG glycopeptide interact simultaneously with both the S- 
and F-faces of Gal-1, thereby inducing oligomerization. Furthermore, Gal-1 can 
trans-bridge α-DG core M1 structures and laminins, which proposed a possible 
mechanism by which Gal-1 ameliorates muscular dystrophies; however, this 
proposal warrants further investigation.
