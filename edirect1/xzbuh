BACKGROUND: Determining prognosis in advanced cancer is of key importance. 
Various prognostic scores have been developed. However, they are often very 
complex. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of neutrophil/lymphocyte 
ratio (NLR) as an index to estimate survival in terminal cancer patients.
METHODS: NLR was calculated retrospectively based on blood tests performed at 3 
months, 2 months, 4 weeks, 3 weeks, 2 weeks, 1 week, and within 3 days before 
death in 160 cancer patients (82 men, 78 women; age range, 33-99 years; mean 
age, 69.8 years).
RESULTS: NLR increased significantly with time (P < 0.0001). Mean NLR was 
significantly higher in patients who died within 4 weeks (29.82) than in those 
who lived more than 4 weeks (6.15). The NLR cutoff point was set at 9.21 
according to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the 
curve, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.79-0.85). We inferred that life 
expectancy would be <4 weeks when NLR >9.21. The sensitivity, specificity, 
positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 65.6, 84.1, 90.6, 
and 51.1%, respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 4.125 
and 0.409, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: NLR appears to be a useful and simple parameter to predict the 
clinical outcomes of patients with terminal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Tolvaptan is the only vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist licensed by 
the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of hyponatraemia (HN) secondary 
to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). We have 
investigated the cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan versus no active treatment 
(NAT) in adult patients within the licensed indication who have either failed to 
respond to fluid restriction or for whom the use of fluid restriction is not 
suitable, from the societal perspective in Sweden.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis, considering a 'general SIADH' population and 
two subpopulations of patients (small-cell lung cancer [SCLC] and pneumonia) to 
broadly represent the complex clinical pathway of SIADH, was performed. A 
discrete event simulation was developed to model the progression of individuals 
through inpatient admissions over a 30-day time horizon (180 days for the SCLC 
cohort). Clinical data were derived from tolvaptan trials and observational data 
sources. All costs are given in Swedish kronor (SEK).
RESULTS: In the 'general SIADH' population, tolvaptan was associated with 
reduced costs (SEK 5,779 per patient [€624]) and increased quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) (0.0019) compared with NAT and was therefore the dominant 
treatment strategy. Tolvaptan was also associated with reduced costs and 
increased QALYs in the SCLC and pneumonia subpopulations. The most influential 
variables in our analysis were reduction in hospital length of stay, duration of 
treatment and long term treatment with tolvaptan in SCLC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Tolvaptan represents a cost-effective treatment option in Sweden 
for hospitalised patients with HN secondary to SIADH who have either failed to 
respond to or are unsuitable for fluid restriction.

BACKGROUND: Postnatal depression (PND) is a major depressive disorder in the 
year following childbirth, which impacts on women, their infants and their 
families. A range of interventions has been developed to prevent PND.
OBJECTIVES: To (1) evaluate the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, 
acceptability and safety of antenatal and postnatal interventions for pregnant 
and postnatal women to prevent PND; (2) apply rigorous methods of systematic 
reviewing of quantitative and qualitative studies, evidence synthesis and 
decision-analytic modelling to evaluate the preventive impact on women, their 
infants and their families; and (3) estimate cost-effectiveness.
DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index and other 
databases (from inception to July 2013) in December 2012, and we were updated by 
electronic alerts until July 2013.
REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts with 
consensus agreement. We undertook quality assessment. All universal, selective 
and indicated preventive interventions for pregnant women and women in the first 
6 postnatal weeks were included. All outcomes were included, focusing on the 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), diagnostic instruments and infant 
outcomes. The quantitative evidence was synthesised using network meta-analyses 
(NMAs). A mathematical model was constructed to explore the cost-effectiveness 
of interventions contained within the NMA for EPDS values.
RESULTS: From 3072 records identified, 122 papers (86 trials) were included in 
the quantitative review. From 2152 records, 56 papers (44 studies) were included 
in the qualitative review. The results were inconclusive. The most beneficial 
interventions appeared to be midwifery redesigned postnatal care [as shown by 
the mean 12-month EPDS score difference of -1.43 (95% credible interval -4.00 to 
1.36)], person-centred approach (PCA)-based and cognitive-behavioural therapy 
(CBT)-based intervention (universal), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)-based 
intervention and education on preparing for parenting (selective), promoting 
parent-infant interaction, peer support, IPT-based intervention and PCA-based 
and CBT-based intervention (indicated). Women valued seeing the same health 
worker, the involvement of partners and access to several visits from a midwife 
or health visitor trained in person-centred or cognitive-behavioural approaches. 
The most cost-effective interventions were estimated to be midwifery redesigned 
postnatal care (universal), PCA-based intervention (indicated) and IPT-based 
intervention in the sensitivity analysis (indicated), although there was 
considerable uncertainty. Expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) 
for efficacy data was in excess of £150M for each population. Given the EVPPI 
values, future trials assessing the relative efficacies of promising 
interventions appears to represent value for money.
LIMITATIONS: In the NMAs, some trials were omitted because they could not be 
connected to the main network of evidence or did not provide EPDS scores. This 
may have introduced reporting or selection bias. No adjustment was made for the 
lack of quality of some trials. Although we appraised a very large number of 
studies, much of the evidence was inconclusive.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions warrant replication within randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs). Several interventions appear to be cost-effective relative to 
usual care, but this is subject to considerable uncertainty.
FUTURE WORK RECOMMENDATIONS: Several interventions appear to be cost-effective 
relative to usual care, but this is subject to considerable uncertainty. Future 
research conducting RCTs to establish which interventions are most clinically 
effective and cost-effective should be considered.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a growing cause of mortality and 
morbidity in Tanzania, but contextualized evidence on cost-effective medical 
strategies to prevent it is scarce. We aim to perform a cost-effectiveness 
analysis of medical interventions for primary prevention of CVD using the World 
Health Organization's (WHO) absolute risk approach for four risk levels.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a societal 
perspective using two Markov decision models: CVD risk without diabetes and CVD 
risk with diabetes. Primary provider and patient costs were estimated using the 
ingredients approach and step-down methodologies. Epidemiological data and 
efficacy inputs were derived from systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We used 
disability- adjusted life years (DALYs) averted as the outcome measure. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model 
results.
RESULTS: For CVD low-risk patients without diabetes, medical management is not 
cost-effective unless willingness to pay (WTP) is higher than US$1327 per DALY 
averted. For moderate-risk patients, WTP must exceed US$164 per DALY before a 
combination of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and diuretic (Diu) 
becomes cost-effective, while for high-risk and very high-risk patients the 
thresholds are US$349 (ACEI, calcium channel blocker (CCB) and Diu) and US$498 
per DALY (ACEI, CCB, Diu and Aspirin (ASA)) respectively. For patients with CVD 
risk with diabetes, a combination of sulfonylureas (Sulf), ACEI and CCB for low 
and moderate risk (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) US$608 and US$115 
per DALY respectively), is the most cost-effective, while adding biguanide (Big) 
to this combination yielded the most favourable ICERs of US$309 and US$350 per 
DALY for high and very high risk respectively. For the latter, ASA is also part 
of the combination.
CONCLUSIONS: Medical preventive cardiology is very cost-effective for all risk 
levels except low CVD risk. Budget impact analyses and distributional concerns 
should be considered further to assess governments' ability and to whom these 
benefits will accrue.

PURPOSE: Overtreatment of screen-detected localized prostate cancer (LPC) is an 
important public health concern, since the survival benefit of aggressive 
treatment (surgery or radiation) has not been well established. We investigated 
the survival expectations of patients who had LPC with and without their chosen 
treatment.
METHODS: A population-based sample of 260 men (132 black, 128 white) 75 years 
old or younger with newly diagnosed LPC completed a self-administered survey. 
How long the patients expected to live with their chosen treatment, how long 
they would expect to live with no treatment, and factors associated with the 
difference in perceived life expectancy were assessed using multivariable 
analysis.
RESULTS: Without any treatment, 33% of patients expected that they would live 
less than 5 years, 41% 5 to 10 years, 21% 10 to 20 years, and 5% more than 20 
years. With their chosen treatment, 3% of patients expected to live less than 5 
years, 9% 5 to 10 years, 33% 10 to 20 years, and 55% more than 20 years. 
Treatment chosen, age, general health perception, and perceived cancer 
seriousness predicted the differences in perceived life expectancy, while race 
and actual tumor risk did not. After adjustment for other covariates, men who 
choose surgery or radiation expected greater gain in survival than men who chose 
watchful waiting or active surveillance.
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with LPC underestimated their life expectancy without 
treatment and overestimated the gain in life expectancy with surgery or 
radiation. These unrealistic expectations may compromise patients' ability to 
make informed treatment decisions and may contribute to overtreatment of LPC. 
Primary care physicians, when included in the decision process, should focus on 
helping patients develop realistic expectations and choices that support their 
treatment goals.

BACKGROUND: Phase III trials show sorafenib improves survival in advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because of narrow trial eligibility, results may 
not be generalizable to a broader HCC population. We sought to evaluate the 
effectiveness of initial sorafenib versus no treatment among Medicare 
beneficiaries with advanced HCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC diagnosed from 2008 to 2011 
were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare 
database. Eligible patients received initial sorafenib or no therapy and were 
covered by Medicare parts A, B, and D. Sorafenib use and outcomes were described 
in this population. Using a propensity score (PS)-matched sample, we compared 
the effectiveness of sorafenib versus no treatment by Cox proportional hazards 
and binomial regression, using a landmark requiring all patients to survive ≥60 
days after diagnosis.
RESULTS: Of 1,532 patients, 27% received initial sorafenib. Median duration of 
sorafenib use was 60 days (interquartile range [IQR], 30-107 days), and median 
survival from first prescription was 3 months (IQR, 1-8 months). In the 
PS-matched cohort, median survival was 3 months from the 60-day landmark in 
sorafenib-treated (n = 223) and 2 months in untreated (n = 223) patients 
(adjusted hazard ratio, 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78-1.16]). 
Sorafenib was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in mortality at 3 
months (44% versus 51%; adjusted risk ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.72-1.07]), but no 
reduction thereafter.
CONCLUSION: Survival after sorafenib initiation in newly diagnosed Medicare 
beneficiaries with HCC is exceptionally short, suggesting trial results are not 
generalizable to all HCC patients. The downsides of sorafenib use-high 
drug-related symptom burden and high drug cost-must be considered in light of 
this minimal benefit.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings of a median survival of only 3 months in 
Medicare beneficiaries with HCC prescribed sorafenib as first-line therapy 
highlight the questionable value of sorafenib in this population. Patients 
should be cautioned that outside of the narrow confines of randomized trials, 
their life expectancy may be very short, and any benefit of sorafenib is likely 
to be quite small. Given that sorafenib causes considerable adverse effects and 
offers no symptom palliation, supportive care should be discussed as a 
reasonable alternative to sorafenib, particularly for patients who have a poor 
performance status or advanced cirrhosis.

摘要 背景. III 期临床试验显示索拉非尼改善了晚期肝细胞癌 (HCC) 患者的生存。但由于临床试验的入选标准十分狭窄, 难以适用于较广泛的 HCC 
人群。我们试图在享有医保的晚期 HCC 患者中, 对初始索拉非尼治疗和不治疗的效果进行评价。 材料与方法. 从监测、流行病学和最终结果 (SEER) 
-医保数据库中, 识别出 2008 年至 2011 年间诊断为晚期 HCC 的患者。符合条件的患者接受初始索拉非尼治疗或不治疗均为医保 A、B 和 D 
部分所覆盖。对该人群中索拉非尼的使用和转归进行描述。我们在倾向性评分 (PS) 匹配样本中, 使用所有患者诊断后生存 ≥60天作为界标, 用 Cox 
比例风险和二项回归分析对索拉非尼治疗与不治疗的效果进行比较。 结果. 1 532 例患者中 27%接受了初始索拉非尼治疗。索拉非尼中位治疗时间为 60 
天[四分位间距 (IQR): 30∼107天], 首次处方后的中位生存时间为 3 个月 (IQR: 1∼8个月)。在 PS 匹配队列中, 索拉非尼治疗组 
(n=223) 在 60 天界标后的中位生存时间为 3 个月, 而不治疗组 (n=223) 为 2 个月[校正后风险比: 0.95, 95%置信区间 (CI): 
0.78∼1.16]。索拉非尼组 3 个月死亡率低于不治疗组, 但差异无统计学意义 (44% vs. 51%, 校正后危险度: 0.88, 95%CI: 
0.72∼1.07), 且之后未出现进一步下降。 结论. 享有医保的新诊断HCC患者接受初始索拉非尼治疗后的生存获益异常的短, 
提示临床试验结果并不适用于所有HCC患者。考虑到索拉非尼的获益非常有限, 同时药物相关性症状负担较高, 药物花费也高, 应减少索拉非尼的使用。The 
Oncologist 2016;21:1113–1120 对临床实践的提示: 在享有医保的 HCC 患者中, 处方索拉非尼进行一线治疗的中位生存时间仅为 3 
个月, 这对索拉非尼在这一人群中的价值提出了质疑。对于不符合随机临床试验中的狭窄限制条件的患者, 应提醒他们预期生存时间可能会非常短, 
从索拉非尼治疗中得到的获益也可能相当之小。鉴于索拉非尼可引起相当多的不良事件, 而且并不能缓解症状, 应考虑将支持治疗作为合理的替代疗法, 
尤其是对于体能状态不佳或合并晚期肝硬化的患者。

Local information processing in the growth cone is essential for correct wiring 
of the nervous system. As an axon navigates through the developing nervous 
system, the growth cone responds to extrinsic guidance cues by coordinating axon 
outgrowth with growth cone steering. It has become increasingly clear that axon 
extension requires proper actin polymerization dynamics, whereas growth cone 
steering involves local protein synthesis. However, molecular components 
integrating these two processes have not been identified. Here, we show that 
Down syndrome critical region 1 protein (DSCR1) controls axon outgrowth by 
modulating growth cone actin dynamics through regulation of cofilin activity 
(phospho/dephospho-cofilin). Additionally, DSCR1 mediates brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor-induced local protein synthesis and growth cone turning. Our 
study identifies DSCR1 as a key protein that couples axon growth and pathfinding 
by dually regulating actin dynamics and local protein synthesis.

MytiLec is an α-d-galactose-binding lectin with a unique primary structure 
isolated from the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis). The lectin 
adopts a β-trefoil fold that is also found in the B-sub-unit of ricin and other 
ricin-type (R-type) lectins. We are introducing MytiLec(-1) and its two variants 
(MytiLec-2 and -3), which both possess an additional pore-forming aerolysin-like 
domain, as members of a novel multi-genic "mytilectin family" in bivalve 
mollusks. Based on the full length mRNA sequence (911 bps), it was possible to 
elucidate the coding sequence of MytiLec-1, which displays an extended open 
reading frame (ORF) at the 5' end of the sequence, confirmed both at the mRNA 
and at the genomic DNA sequence level. While this extension could potentially 
produce a polypeptide significantly longer than previously reported, this has 
not been confirmed yet at the protein level. MytiLec-1 was revealed to be 
encoded by a gene consisting of two exons and a single intron. The first exon 
comprised the 5'UTR and the initial ATG codon and it was possible to detect a 
putative promoter region immediately ahead of the transcription start site in 
the MytiLec-1 genomic locus. The remaining part of the MytiLec-1 coding sequence 
(including the three sub-domains, the 3'UTR and the poly-A signal) was included 
in the second exon. The bacteriostatic activity of MytiLec-1 was determined by 
the agglutination of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, which was 
reversed by the co-presence of α-galactoside. Altogether, these data support the 
classification of MytiLec-1 as a member of the novel mytilectin family and 
suggest that this lectin may play an important role as a pattern recognition 
receptor in the innate immunity of mussels.

From Hospital to Home Care: Creating a Domotic Environment for Elderly and 
Disabled People.

Lopez NM, Ponce S, Piccinini D, Perez E, Roberti M.

Advances in medicine have led to a significant increase in human life expectancy 
and, therefore, to a growing number of disabled elderly people who need chronic 
care and assistance [1]. The World Health Organization reports that the world's 
population over 60 years old will double between 2000 and 2050 and quadruple for 
seniors older than 80 years, reaching 400 million [2]. In addition, strokes, 
traffic-related and other accidents, and seemingly endless wars and acts of 
terrorism contribute to an increasing number of disabled younger people.

Gingival Inflammation and Aggressive Periodontitis in a Child with a Specific 
Antibody Deficiency.

Liyange S, Edgar D, Shields MD, Linden GJ.

Exuberant gingival inflammation accompanied by periodontitis is a rare finding 
in a very young child and may indicate a defect in the host response. Affected 
children should be referred to appropriate specialists to establish a definitive 
diagnosis. A 5-year-old girl presented with persistent gingival inflammation and 
periodontal destruction. Immunological investigations identified specific 
polysaccharide antibody deficiency which, when treated, resulted in a 
significant improvement in the gingival condition. This case illustrates the 
need for integrated management by a wide range of dental and medical 
specialists. Antibody deficiency is rare but, if not identified and treated 
effectively, can be associated with chronic ill health and decreased life 
expectancy. CPD/Clinical Relevance: This article describes a rare case of 
gingival inflammation accompanied by periodontitis in a very young child 
secondary to an underlying host antibody deficiency and details the 
investigation, management and clinical outcomes.

AIDS has gradually changed from a fatal disease to a manageable chronic disease 
since the advent of antiretroviral drugs. In 2003, China initiated a national 
free antiretroviral treatment program for people living with HIV/AIDS, several 
death evaluation indicators have been used to evaluate public health effect of 
the program. Death evaluation indicators used frequently in domestic and 
overseas include mortality, case fatality rate, excess mortality, standard 
mortality ratio, years of potential life lost, disability-adjusted life year and 
life expectancy. This paper summarizes the different death indicators applied in 
effectiveness evaluation of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, elaborates the 
application range and significance of these indicators and suggests the research 
in related life expectancy and burden of disease which have not been conducted 
in China.

BACKGROUND: For critically ill adult patients with acute traumatic brain injury 
(TBI), we assessed the clinical and cost-effectiveness of: (a) Management in 
dedicated neurocritical care units versus combined neuro/general critical care 
units within neuroscience centres. (b) 'Early' transfer to a neuroscience centre 
versus 'no or late' transfer for those who present at a non-neuroscience centre.
METHODS: The Risk Adjustment In Neurocritical care (RAIN) Study included 
prospective admissions following acute TBI to 67 UK adult critical care units 
during 2009-11. Data were collected on baseline case-mix, mortality, resource 
use, and at six months, Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE), and quality of 
life (QOL) (EuroQol 5D-3L). We report incremental effectiveness, costs and cost 
per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) of the alternative care locations, 
adjusting for baseline differences with validated risk prediction models. We 
tested the robustness of results in sensitivity analyses.
FINDINGS: Dedicated neurocritical care unit patients (N = 1324) had similar 
six-month mortality, higher QOL (mean gain 0.048, 95% CI -0.002 to 0.099) and 
increased average costs compared with those managed in combined neuro/general 
units (N = 1341), with a lifetime cost per QALY gained of £14,000. 'Early' 
transfer to a neuroscience centre (N = 584) was associated with lower mortality 
(odds ratio 0.52, 0.34-0.80), higher QOL for survivors (mean gain 0.13, 
0.032-0.225), but positive incremental costs (£15,001, £11,123 to £18,880) 
compared with 'late or no transfer' (N = 263). The lifetime cost per QALY gained 
for 'early' transfer was £11,000.
CONCLUSIONS: For critically ill adult patients with acute TBI, within 
neuroscience centres management in dedicated neurocritical care units versus 
combined neuro/general units led to improved QoL and higher costs, on average, 
but these differences were not statistically significant. This study finds that 
'early' transfer to a neuroscience centre is associated with reduced mortality, 
improvement in QOL and is cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Oral thrush is a common fungal infection of the mouth experienced by 
palliative medicine and hospice patients who have advanced cancer. Individuals 
often experience distressing symptoms that affect their oral intake with most 
regimens adding to pill burden. This is an open-label prospective observational 
study to assess the efficacy of a single-dose fluconazole 150 mg for oral 
thrush.
METHODS: Palliative medicine and hospice patients with a clinical diagnosis of 
oral thrush, a life expectancy of more than 1 week, and were able to swallow 
were enrolled. Signs and symptoms were evaluated on day 1 prior to 
administration of 150 mg of fluconazole and between days 3 to 5 after treatment.
RESULTS: Of 57 patients, 55 (96.5%) had more than 50% improvement in signs and 
symptoms. Both the number and severity of symptoms changed significantly 
posttreatment ( P < .001). Side effects were few.
CONCLUSION: Single-dose fluconazole 150 mg is an effective treatment of oral 
thrush for individuals with advanced cancer.

Cost-Effectiveness of Pertussis Vaccination During Pregnancy in the United 
States.

Atkins KE, Fitzpatrick MC, Galvani AP, Townsend JP.

Vaccination against pertussis has reduced the disease burden dramatically, but 
the most severe cases and almost all fatalities occur in infants too young to be 
vaccinated. Recent epidemiologic evidence suggests that targeted vaccination of 
mothers during pregnancy can reduce pertussis incidence in their infants. To 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of antepartum maternal vaccination in the United 
States, we created an age-stratified transmission model, incorporating empirical 
data on US contact patterns and explicitly modeling parent-infant exposure. 
Antepartum maternal vaccination incurs costs of $114,000 (95% prediction 
interval: 82,000, 183,000) per quality-adjusted life-year, in comparison with 
the strategy of no adult vaccination, and is cost-effective in the United States 
according to World Health Organization criteria. By contrast, vaccinating a 
second parent is not cost-effective, and vaccination of either parent postpartum 
is strongly dominated by antepartum maternal vaccination. Nonetheless, 
postpartum vaccination of mothers who were not vaccinated antepartum improves 
upon the current recommendation of untargeted adult vaccination. Additionally, 
the temporary direct protection of the infant due to maternal antibody transfer 
has efficacy for infants comparable to that conferred to toddlers by the full 
primary vaccination series. Efficient protection against pertussis for infants 
begins before birth. We highly recommend antepartum vaccination for as many US 
mothers as possible.

Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis is commonly associated with motor 
impairments, neuropathic pain, fatigue, mood disorders, and decreased life 
expectancy. However, preclinical pharmacological studies predominantly rely on 
clinical scoring of motor deficit as the sole behavioral endpoint. Thus, the 
translational potential of these studies is limited. Here, we have assessed the 
therapeutic potential of a novel anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) 
non-viral gene therapy formulation (XT-101-R) in a rat relapsing remitting 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. EAE induced motor 
deficits and neuropathic pain as reflected by induction of low-threshold 
mechanical allodynia, suppressed voluntary wheel running, decreased social 
exploration, and was associated with markedly enhanced mortality. We also noted 
that voluntary wheel running was depressed prior to the onset of motor deficit, 
and may therefore serve as a predictor of clinical symptoms onset. XT-101-R was 
intrathecally dosed only once at the onset of motor deficits, and attenuated 
each of the EAE-induced symptoms and improved survival, relative to vehicle 
control. This is the first pharmacological assessment of such a broad range of 
EAE symptoms, and provides support for IL-10 gene therapy as a clinical strategy 
for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The global diabetes epidemic affects countries differently. We 
aimed to describe trends in the incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus requiring glucose-lowering treatment, together with associated life 
expectancy and risks of significant clinical complications.
METHODS: Data on patients with type 2 diabetes who filled a prescription for any 
glucose-lowering drug (GLD) during the period 2006-2013 were extracted from the 
Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, Cause of Death Register and Swedish National 
Patient Register.
RESULTS: In 2013, the prevalence of GLD-treated type 2 diabetes was 4.4% 
(n = 352,436) and the incidence was 399 per 100,000 population (n = 30,620). 
During 2006-2013, the prevalence increased by 61% while the incidence remained 
relatively stable; the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD, 34% in 2013) 
and microvascular disease (16% in 2013) was also stable. Insulin use increased 
by 29% while sulfonylurea use declined by 55%. Compared with the general 
population, patients with type 2 diabetes had increased risk of myocardial 
infarction, stroke and all-cause mortality, with age-standardised risks of 
∼1.7-, 1.5- and 1.3-fold, respectively. These risks declined over time. 
Life-years lost due to diabetes was most pronounced at younger ages and improved 
in women over time from 2006 to 2013.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes requiring GLD 
treatment in Sweden increased substantially in recent years, while the incidence 
remained stable. Use of sulfonylurea declined while insulin use increased. The 
high prevalence of diabetes-related comorbidities, increased risk of 
complications and life-years lost highlights the need for optimised and new 
preventive strategies in patients with type 2 diabetes.

L'Aquila, Piazza Italia 1, Teramo, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) was considered the gold 
standard approach in recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, with unanimous 
consensus of opinions. The cost-effectiveness analysis in the surgical treatment 
of recurrence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) was carried out 
comparing VATS with muscle-sparing axillary minithoracotomy (MSAM).
METHODS: Between July 2006 and October 2012 we treated 56 patients with a second 
episode of PSP by VATS or open approach. Time of intervention, prolonged air 
leaks, duration of pleural drainage, length of hospitalization, and long-term 
morbidity were evaluated, establishing the relationship between costs and 
quality-adjusted life for each technique.
RESULTS: The assessment of pain and threshold of tenderness was more favorable 
in VATS in respect to MSAM during the 5 years of follow-up (p = 0.004 and <0.001 
at 1st year; p = 0.006 and <0.002 at 5th year). The minimally invasive method 
was less expensive than axillary minithoracotomy (2443.44 € vs. 3170.80 €). The 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of VATS was better than that of MSAM (57.00 vs. 
49.2 at 60 months) as well as the quality-adjusted life year (0.03 at 1st year 
and 0.13 at 5th year). Incremental cost per life year gained of VATS versus MSAM 
was between 24,245.33 € (1st year) and 5776.31 € (5th year), making it 
advantageous at 3rd, 4th, and 5th years.
CONCLUSIONS: VATS compared to MSAM in the treatment of a second episode of PSP 
ensured undoubted clinical advantages associated with significant cost savings.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) encompasses deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and 
pulmonary embolism. VTE is the leading cause of lost disability-adjusted life 
years and the third leading cause of cardiovascular death in the world. DVT 
leads to post-thrombotic syndrome, whereas pulmonary embolism can cause chronic 
pulmonary hypertension, both of which reduce quality of life. Genetic and 
acquired risk factors for thrombosis include non-O blood groups, factor V Leiden 
mutation, oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy, advanced age, 
surgery, hospitalization and long-haul travel. A combination of blood stasis, 
plasma hypercoagulability and endothelial dysfunction is thought to trigger 
thrombosis, which starts most often in the valve pockets of large veins. Animal 
studies have revealed pathogenic roles for leukocytes, platelets, tissue 
factor-positive microvesicles, neutrophil extracellular traps and factors XI and 
XII. Diagnosis of VTE requires testing and exclusion of other pathologies, and 
typically involves laboratory measures (such as D-dimer) and diagnostic imaging. 
VTE is treated with anticoagulants and occasionally with thrombolytics to 
prevent thrombus extension and to reduce thrombus size. Anticoagulants are also 
used to reduce recurrence. New therapies with improved safety profiles are 
needed to prevent and treat venous thrombosis. For an illustrated summary of

BACKGROUND: An m-health application has been developed and implemented with 
community health workers to improve their counseling in a rural area of India. 
The ultimate aim was to generate demand and improve utilization of key maternal, 
neonatal, and child health services. The present study aims to assess the impact 
and cost-effectiveness of this project.
METHODS/DESIGN: A pre-post quasi-experimental design with a control group will 
be used to undertake difference in differences analysis for assessing the impact 
of intervention. The Annual Health Survey (2011) will provide pre-intervention 
data, and a household survey will be carried out to provide post-intervention 
data.Two community development blocks where the intervention was introduced will 
be treated as intervention blocks while two controls blocks are selected after 
matching with intervention blocks on three indicators: average number of 
antenatal care checkups, percentage of women receiving three or more antenatal 
checkups, and percentage of institutional deliveries. Two categories of 
beneficiaries will be interviewed in both areas: women with a child between 29 
days and 6 months and women with a child between 12 and 23 months. Propensity 
score matched samples from intervention and control areas in pre-post periods 
will be analyzed using the difference in differences method to estimate the 
impact of intervention in utilization of key services.Bottom-up costing methods 
will be used to assess the cost of implementing intervention. A decision model 
will estimate long-term effects of improved health services utilization on 
mortality, morbidity, and disability. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed in 
terms of incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year averted and cost per 
unit increase in composite service coverage in intervention versus control 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The study will generate significant evidence on impact of the 
m-health intervention for maternal, neonatal, and child services and on the cost 
of scaling up m-health technology for accredited social health activists in 
India.

Statins and Risk of Bleeding: An Analysis to Evaluate Possible Bias Due to 
Prevalent Users and Healthy User Aspects.

van Rein N, Cannegieter SC, le Cessie S, Rosendaal FR, Reitsma PH, van der Meer 
FJ, Lijfering WM.

Statins are said to protect against a wide range of diseases. We studied to what 
extent potential bias influences the results of studies on beneficial side 
effects of statins. We selected 8,188 atrial fibrillation patients who started 
treatment with anticoagulants at the Leiden Anticoagulation Clinic in the 
Netherlands between 2003 and 2009 and experienced 1,683 minor and 451 major 
bleeds during 18,105 person-years of follow-up. Statins were associated with a 
risk reduction of 9% for bleeds (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 
0.82, 1.00). Additionally, analyses were stratified by age, incident users 
(patients who started statins during follow-up, i.e., an inception cohort), and 
prevalent statin users (statin users at baseline), as restriction to incident 
users avoids overoptimistic risk estimates. After stratification, the protective 
associations disappeared or reversed (range of hazard ratios = 0.99-3.22), 
except for patients aged 75 years or older. This remaining association could be 
due to another bias as, according to guidelines, in the elderly, statins should 
be prescribed only to those with a reasonable life expectancy. This could have 
resulted in a comparison of fit statin users with less fit nonstatin users 
(healthy user effect). The apparent protective association of statins on bleeds 
may be due to bias. We recommend stratification by age and incident and 
prevalent statin use when studying associations of statins with disease outcomes 
to avoid overoptimistic risk estimates.

BACKGROUND: Population-based bowel cancer screening has resulted in increasing 
numbers of patients with T1 colonic cancer. The need for colectomy in this group 
is questioned due to the low risk of lymphatic spread and increased treatment 
morbidity, particularly for elderly, comorbid patients. This study examined the 
quality-of-life benefits and risks of endoscopic resection compared with results 
after colectomy, for low-risk and high-risk T1 colonic cancer.
METHODS: Decision analysis using a Markov simulation model was performed; 
patients were managed with either endoscopic resection (advanced therapeutic 
endoscopy) or colectomy. Lesions were considered high risk according to accepted 
national guidelines. Probabilities and utilities (perception of quality of life) 
were derived from published data. Hypothetical cohorts of 65- and 80-year-old,
