Mechanisms of molecular self-replication have the potential to shed light on the 
origins of life. In particular, self-replication through RNA-catalysed templated 
RNA synthesis is thought to have supported a primordial 'RNA world'. However, 
existing polymerase ribozymes lack the capacity to synthesize RNAs approaching 
their own size. Here, we report the in vitro evolution of such catalysts 
directly in the RNA-stabilizing medium of water ice, which yielded RNA 
polymerase ribozymes specifically adapted to sub-zero temperatures and able to 
synthesize RNA in ices at temperatures as low as -19 °C. The combination of 
cold-adaptive mutations with a previously described 5' extension operating at 
ambient temperatures enabled the design of a first polymerase ribozyme capable 
of catalysing the accurate synthesis of an RNA sequence longer than itself 
(adding up to 206 nucleotides), an important stepping stone towards RNA 
self-replication.

[The changing gaps of life expectancy on genders in urban cities of China, from 
2005 to 2010].

[Article in Chinese]

Shen J(1), Jiang QW.

Ministry of Education, Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the gender difference of life expectancy in urban people 
of China and to explore both age-specific and cause-specific contributions to 
the changing differences in life expectancy on genders.
METHODS: Data on life expectancy (male and female) and mortality were obtained 
from the"Annual Statistics of public health in China". Male-female gender 
difference was analyzed by decomposition methodologies, including age-specific 
decomposition and the cause-specific decomposition.
RESULTS: Women had lived much longer than men in the Chinese urban citizens, 
with remarkable gains in life expectancy since 2005. Difference in gender 
reached a peak in 2007, with the gap of 5.3 years. Differences on mortality 
between men and women in the 60-79 age groups made the largest contribution 
(42%-47%) to the gap of 6 years on life expectancy in genders. With the widening 
of the gaps in gender on life expectancy between 2005 and 2007, faster declining 
of mortality among groups of women in age 0-1 age and over 75 years old groups 
made the largest contributions. Between 2007 and 2008, along with the reduction 
of gaps in gender, all the age groups except the 1-15 and 50-55 year-olds showed 
negative efforts. In 2009-2010, the widening gaps in gender on life expectancy 
were caused by the positive effect in the 60-70 age group. Among all the causes 
of death, cancer (1.638-2.019 years), circulatory diseases (1.271-1.606 years), 
respiratory diseases (0.551-0.800 years) made the largest contributions to the 
gender gap. 33%-38% of the gaps in gender were caused by cancer and among all 
the cancers, among which lung cancer contributed 0.6 years to the overall gap. 
Contribution of cancers to the gender gap was reducing, but when time went on it 
was mostly influenced by the narrowing effect caused by liver cancer on the gap 
in gender. Traffic accidents and suicidal issues were the external causes that 
influencing the gender gap and contributing 10.60%-15.78% to the overall 
differentials.
CONCLUSION: Public health efforts in reducing the excess mortalities for cancer, 
circulatory and respiratory diseases, suicide, among men in particular, will 
further narrow the gender gap on life expectancy in the urban cities of China.

    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2018 May 24;5:CD006112.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2008;(4):CD006112.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-limiting genetic condition 
in Caucasians and the life-expectancy of those newly diagnosed is increasing. 
Inspiratory muscle training may be a way of improving the lung function and 
quality of life of people with cystic fibrosis. Hence there is a need to 
establish whether this intervention is beneficial.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of inspiratory muscle training on 
health-related quality of life, pulmonary function and exercise tolerance.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders 
Group Trials register comprising of references identified from comprehensive 
electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract 
books of conference proceedings.Date of most recent search: 08 July 2013.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical controlled trials 
comparing different inspiratory muscle training regimens with each other or a 
control in people with cystic fibrosis.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently applied the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria to publications and assessed the quality of the 
included studies.
MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified. Of these eight studies with 180 
participants met the review inclusion criteria. There was wide variation in the 
quality of the included studies. Data were not published in sufficient detail or 
with sufficiently similar outcome measures in these studies to perform 
meta-analyses.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We have not found any evidence to suggest that this 
treatment is either beneficial or not. We would advise that practitioners 
evaluate on a case-by-case basis whether or not to employ this therapy. We 
recommend that future studies make more use of health-related quality of life 
and exercise tolerance measures; and that there is an agreement upon a single 
standard measure of classifying the clinical status of the participants.

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis: immediate revascularization or watchful waiting?

Based on several randomized clinical trials, carotid revascularization has been 
shown to reduce future stroke risk among individuals with severe asymptomatic 
carotid stenosis. However, a well-recognized problem with such prophylactic 
intervention is the risk of periprocedural stroke, death, or myocardial 
infarction. If actual stroke risk with asymptomatic carotid stenosis can be 
reduced significantly by aggressive medical management, carotid 
revascularization may yield marginal benefit or even cause harm especially in 
those with limited life expectancy. Based on recent observational data, it is 
becoming apparent that the stroke risk in this population has been declining 
with better medical management alone. This has prompted a few to avoid carotid 
revascularization for asymptomatic carotid stenosis altogether. Others feel such 
conclusions cannot be made with observational data alone. In the midst of this 
controversy, it is important that clinicians perform carotid revascularization 
on a case by case basis while ensuring optimal medical management in all 
patients. An algorithmic approach to decision making based on available evidence 
will enable clinicians to personalize patient management with efficiency.

Development, University Extension, Davis, CA.

Adolescent parents are often ill prepared to provide their new babies with the 
care and stimulation they need for satisfactory development. A series of 
age-paced parent education booklets was designed to help these young parents 
acquire the information, knowledge, and confidence they need to improve their 
parenting practices. This is a report of a study designed to evaluate the impact 
of this parent education program on the parenting practices of adolescent 
mothers. The parenting practices of seventy young mothers who had received the 
parenting booklets monthly during their babies' first year of life were compared 
with those of a comparable group of eighty-five adolescent mothers who had not 
participated in the program. Results suggest that receiving the booklet series 
was associated with more positive parenting attitudes, beliefs, and practices. 
Implications for preventive services are discussed.

BACKGROUND: Computer simulation modeling makes it possible to project physical 
activity levels and the prevalence of related health outcomes. Such projections 
can help to inform programs that aim to increase physical activity levels and 
improve population health.
DATA AND METHODS: The Population Health Model (POHEM) platform was used to 
develop a dynamic microsimulation model of physical activity among Canadian 
adults. Key parameters were derived from the National Population Health Survey 
(1994/1995 to 2006/2007) and the 2000/2001 Canadian Community Health Survey. To 
assess the validity of the physical activity module (POHEM-PA), estimates from 
the simulation projections were compared with results from nationally 
representative surveys.
RESULTS: Trends over time in physical activity levels, chronic disease 
prevalence, and Health Utilities Index based on POHEM-PA projections were 
similar to those based on data from subsequent cycles of the Canadian Community 
Health Survey.
INTERPRETATION: The addition of a physical activity module to POHEM provides a 
tool that can improve understanding of the complex dynamics underlying the 
relationship between physical activity and health outcomes as a population ages.

Pharmacoeconomic analysis of the diabetes initiative program: a 
pharmacist-physician collaborative care model.

Author information:

TN, USA.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes treatment cost increased 41% from 2007 to 2011. Pharmacists 
have provided collaborative diabetes management for decades with improvement in 
disease-related end points. Few have reported economic benefits of pharmacist 
management of type 2 diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose was to determine if cost savings associated with 
hemoglobin A1c (A1C) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) change outweighed 
programmatic pharmacist-physician collaborative care model costs.
METHODS: This cost analysis of a 12 month, prospective, multicenter, 
observational study included English-speaking adults, 18 years or older, with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus, a life expectancy >1 year, and either a A1C >7%, SBP 
>130 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure >80 mm Hg, or low-density lipoprotein 
concentration >100 mg/dL. Pregnant patients were excluded. Primary analysis 
outcome was average cost per outcome, ratio of net cost (numerator) and 
percentage achieving outcomes (denominator). Assessment outcomes included A1C 
reduction by at least 1% and SBP reduction by at least 5.6 mm Hg.
RESULTS: 206 patients were seen by pharmacists during 1612 encounters (mean = 
7.8 encounters/patient). Pharmacists spent 983 hours caring for type 2 diabetes 
patients (mean 3.8 hours/patient). Base case net labor and program costs per 
patient were -$66.77 and $106.81, respectively. Improvement in A1C and SBP 
yielded $421.01 in cost savings per patient. Labor and program average costs per 
patient for each outcome achieved were -$100.40 and $160.61, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This multisite pharmacist-physician collaboration in diabetes 
management showed cost savings when assessing pharmacist labor costs alone. 
Total program costs, including overhead, slightly increased cost of care.

[Purpose] The purpose of this study was to compare the cervical extension angle 
and the upper trapezius muscle activity between overhead work and below-knee 
work. [Subjects] Twelve males aged 20-30 years, were recruited. [Methods] We 
measured the cervical extension angle and upper trapezius muscle activity during 
overhead work and below-knee work. [Results] The results show that the cervical 
extension angle and upper trapezius muscle activity were significantly increased 
during below-knee work compared to overhead work. [Conclusion] Below-knee work 
is more likely to cause neck and shoulder pain than overhead work. Therefore, 
future studies should investigate below-knee work in detail.

Uruguay.

BACKGROUND: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is characterized by intestinal 
polyposis, mucocutaneous pigmentation and an increased cancer risk, usually 
caused by mutations of the STK11 gene. This study collected epidemiological, 
clinical and genetic data from all Uruguayan PJS patients.
METHODS: Clinical data were obtained from public and private medical centers and 
updated annually. Sequencing of the STK11 gene in one member of each family was 
performed.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 25 cases in 11 unrelated families were registered (15 
males, 10 females). The average age of diagnosis and death was 18 and 41 years 
respectively. All patients had characteristic PJS pigmentation and 
gastrointestinal polyps. 72% required urgent surgery due to intestinal 
obstruction. 3 families had multiple cases of seizure disorder, representing 20% 
of cases. 28% developed cancer and two patients had more than one cancer. An 
STK11 mutation was found in 8 of the 9 families analyzed. A unique M136K 
missense mutation was noted in one family. Comparing annual live births and PJS 
birth records from 1970 to 2009 yielded an incidence of 1 in 155,000.
CONCLUSION: The Uruguayan Registry for Peutz-Jeghers patients showed a high 
chance of emergent surgery, epilepsy, cancer and shortened life expectancy. The 
M136K missense mutation is a newly reported STK 11 mutation.

Accounting for female reproductive cycles in a superpopulation capture-recapture 
framework.

Superpopulation capture-recapture models are useful for estimating the abundance 
of long-lived, migratory species because they are able to account for the fluid 
nature of annual residency at migratory destinations. Here we extend the 
superpopulation POPAN model to explicitly account for heterogeneity in capture 
probability linked to reproductive cycles (POPAN-tau). This extension has 
potential application to a range of species that have temporally variable life 
stages (e.g., non-annual breeders such as albatrosses and baleen whales) and 
results in a significant reduction in bias over the standard POPAN model. We 
demonstrate the utility of this model in simultaneously estimating abundance and 
annual population growth rate (lamda) in the New Zealand (NZ) southern right 
whale (Eubalaena australis) from 1995 to 2009. DNA profiles were constructed for 
the individual identification of more than 700 whales, sampled during two sets 
of winter expeditions in 1995-1998 and 2006-2009. Due to differences in 
recapture rates between sexes, only sex-specific models were considered. The 
POPAN-tau models, which explicitly account for a decrease in capture probability 
in non-calving years, fit the female data set significantly better than do 
standard superpopulation models (deltaAIC > 25). The best POPAN-tau model (AIC) 
gave a super-population estimate of 1162 females for 1995-2009 (95% CL 921, 
1467) and an estimated annual increase of 5% (95% CL--2%, 13%). The best model 
(AIC) gave a superpopulation estimate of 1007 males (95% CL 794, 1276) and an 
estimated annual increase of 7% (95% CL 5%, 9%) for 1995-2009. Combined, the 
total superpopulation estimate for 1995-2009 was 2169 whales (95% CL 1836, 
2563). Simulations suggest that failure to account for the effect of 
reproductive status on the capture probability would result in a substantial 
positive bias (+19%) in female abundance estimates.

Ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: can biomarkers improve current 
management?

Bartlett JM(1), Nofech-Moses S, Rakovitch E.

Author information:
(1)Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, ON, Canada;

BACKGROUND: Screening for invasive cancer has led to a marked increase in the 
detection of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). DCIS is, if appropriately managed, 
a low-risk disease which has a small chance of impacting on patient life 
expectancy. However, despite significant advances in prognostic marker 
development in invasive breast cancer, there are no validated diagnostic assays 
to inform treatment choice for women with DCIS. Therefore we are unable to 
target effective treatment strategies to women at high risk and avoid 
over-treatment of women at low risk of progression to invasive breast cancer. 
Paradoxically, one effect of this uncertainty is undertreatment of some women.
CONTENT: We review current practice and research in the field to identify key 
challenges in the management of DCIS. The impact of clinical research, 
particularly on the over and undertreatment of women with DCIS is assessed. We 
note slow progress toward development of diagnostic biomarkers and highlight key 
opportunities to accelerate advances in this area.
SUMMARY: DCIS is a low-risk disease, its incidence is increasing, and current 
treatment is effective. However, many women are either over- or undertreated. 
Despite repeated calls for development of diagnostic biomarkers, progress in 
this area has been slow, reflecting a relative lack of investment of research 
effort and funding. Given the low event rate in treated patients and the 
lateness of recurrences, many previous studies have only limited power to 
identify independent prognostic and predictive biomarkers. However, the 
potential for such biomarkers to personalize treatment for DCIS is extremely 
high.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest in evidence-based educational 
interventions in central venous catheter care. It is unclear how effective these 
are at reducing the risk of bloodstream infections from the use of intravascular 
catheters (catheter-BSIs) and the associated costs and health benefits.
AIM: To estimate the additional costs and health benefits from introducing such 
interventions and the costs associated with catheter-BSIs.
METHODS: A comprehensive epidemiological and economic review was performed to 
develop the parameters for an economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
introducing an educational intervention compared with clinical practice without 
the intervention. The model follows the clinical pathway of cohorts of patients 
from their admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), where some may acquire 
catheter-BSI, and estimates the associated costs, mortality and life expectancy.
FINDINGS: The additional cost per catheter-BSI episode was £3940. The results of 
this model demonstrate that introducing an additional educational intervention 
to prevent catheter-BSI improved patient life expectancy and reduced overall 
costs.
CONCLUSION: Introducing evidence-based education is likely to reduce the 
incidence of catheter-BSI and the model results suggest that the cost of 
introducing the interventions will be outweighed by savings related to reduced 
ICU bed occupancy costs.

Long-term pituitary down-regulation with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone 
(GnRH) agonist for 3–6 months prior to IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection 
(ICSI) improves clinical pregnancy rates in endometriosis patients. However, 
some discussion about this treatment strategy still exists. This retrospective 
study from a tertiary-care university hospital examined the efficacy and safety 
of IVF/ICSI with and without long-term pituitary down-regulation in severe 
endometriosis patients (surgically confirmed American Society for Reproductive 
Medicine stages III and IV). All first IVF/ICSI treatment cycles between January 
2009 and January 2012 were analysed. In patients treated with (n = 68) and 
without (n = 45) long-term pituitary down-regulation, 13 (19.1%) versus nine 
(20.0%) ongoing pregnancies after fresh embryo transfer (adjusted OR 0.58, 95% 
CI 0.18–1.86,) and 24 (35.3%) versus 10 (22.2%) ongoing pregnancies after fresh 
and cryopreserved embryo transfers (adjusted OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.60–4.38) were 
accomplished, respectively. Three complications (2.7%) and three recurrences 
(2.7%) were reported, only in patients treated with long-term pituitary 
down-regulation. The 1-year cumulative endometriosis recurrence rate was 7.3%. 
IVF/ICSI in patients with severe endometriosis is safe with low complication and 
recurrence rates. A favourable effect, albeit non-significant, of long-term 
pituitary down-regulation in achieving an ongoing pregnancy was observed only 
after including cryopreserved embryo transfers.

BACKGROUND: Depression is expensive to treat, but providing ineffective 
treatment is more expensive. Such is the case for many patients who do not 
respond to antidepressant medication.
AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) 
plus usual care for primary care patients with treatment-resistant depression 
compared with usual care alone.
METHOD: Economic evaluation at 12 months alongside a randomised controlled 
trial. Cost-effectiveness assessed using a cost-consequences framework comparing 
cost to the health and social care provider, patients and society, with a range 
of outcomes. Cost-utility analysis comparing health and social care costs with 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: The mean cost of CBT per participant was £910. The difference in QALY 
gain between the groups was 0.057, equivalent to 21 days a year of good health. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £14 911 (representing a 74% 
probability of the intervention being cost-effective at the National Institute 
of Health and Care Excellence threshold of £20 000 per QALY). Loss of earnings 
and productivity costs were substantial but there was no evidence of a 
difference between intervention and control groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of CBT to usual care is cost-effective in patients who 
have not responded to antidepressants. Primary care physicians should therefore 
be encouraged to refer such individuals for CBT.

The Asia Pacific meeting for vasculitis and ANCA workshop 2012: surgical 
treatment for Takayasu's arteritis.

Surgical interventions are performed to ameliorate the complications of 
Takayasu's arteritis, which adversely affects life expectancy. However, the 
efficacy of surgery in relation to long-term survival of the patients remains to 
be evaluated. A retrospective review was performed on 110 consecutive patients 
with Takayasu's arteritis who underwent surgical treatment at our single 
institution. Survival was compared with the reported results of medically 
treated patients according to Ishikawa's prognostic classification. There were 
12 hospital deaths, and the remaining 98 patients were followed up from 10 
months to 48.4 years (mean 21.6 years). A serious long-term complication was 
anastomotic aneurysms with a cumulative incidence at 10 and 20 years of 7.8 and 
14.8 %, respectively. Thirty-seven late deaths were observed and the major 
causes were congestive heart failure and anastomotic aneurysms. The cumulative 
survival rate at 10 and 20 years was 84.3 and 70.4 %, respectively. In patients 
classified as stage 3 by Ishikawa, surgery seemed to increase survival; however, 
surgery-associated complications conversely decreased the survival of patients 
with stage 1 disease. Surgery seems to increase the long-term survival of 
patients with stage 3 Takayasu's arteritis by Ishikawa's prognostic 
classification. Conservative treatment is recommended for those with stage 1 or 
2 disease. Anastomotic aneurysms may occur at any time after surgery, and 
regular follow-up is mandatory for the rest of the patient's life. This article 
was based on previous reports by the author with several additional patients and 
follow-up periods.

INTRODUCTION: Structural uncertainty relates to differences in model structure 
and parameterization. For many published health economic analyses in oncology, 
substantial differences in model structure exist, leading to differences in 
analysis outcomes and potentially impacting decision-making processes. The 
objectives of this analysis were (1) to identify differences in model structure 
and parameterization for cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) comparing tamoxifen 
and anastrazole for adjuvant breast cancer (ABC) treatment; and (2) to quantify 
the impact of these differences on analysis outcome metrics.
METHODS: The analysis consisted of four steps: (1) review of the literature for 
identification of eligible CEAs; (2) definition and implementation of a base 
model structure, which included the core structural components for all 
identified CEAs; (3) definition and implementation of changes or additions in 
the base model structure or parameterization; and (4) quantification of the 
impact of changes in model structure or parameterizations on the analysis 
outcome metrics life-years gained (LYG), incremental costs (IC) and the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Eleven CEA analyses comparing anastrazole and tamoxifen as ABC 
treatment were identified. The base model consisted of the following health 
states: (1) on treatment; (2) off treatment; (3) local recurrence; (4) 
metastatic disease; (5) death due to breast cancer; and (6) death due to other 
causes. The base model estimates of anastrazole versus tamoxifen for the LYG, IC 
and ICER were 0.263 years, €3,647 and €13,868/LYG, respectively. In the 
published models that were evaluated, differences in model structure included 
the addition of different recurrence health states, and associated transition 
rates were identified. Differences in parameterization were related to the 
incidences of recurrence, local recurrence to metastatic disease, and metastatic 
disease to death. The separate impact of these model components on the LYG 
ranged from 0.207 to 0.356 years, while incremental costs ranged from €3,490 to 
€3,714 and ICERs ranged from €9,804/LYG to €17,966/LYG. When we re-analyzed the 
published CEAs in our framework by including their respective model properties, 
the LYG ranged from 0.207 to 0.383 years, IC ranged from €3,556 to €3,731 and 
ICERs ranged from €9,683/LYG to €17,570/LYG.
CONCLUSION: Differences in model structure and parameterization lead to 
substantial differences in analysis outcome metrics. This analysis supports the 
need for more guidance regarding structural uncertainty and the use of 
standardized disease-specific models for health economic analyses of adjuvant 
endocrine breast cancer therapies. The developed approach in the current 
analysis could potentially serve as a template for further evaluations of 
structural uncertainty and development of disease-specific models.

"I've got a lot to do and i don't think i'll have the time": Gender differences 
in late adolescents' narratives of the future.

CA.

The present study examined gender differences in late adolescents' future 
narratives.Thirty-nine male and 43 female late adolescents (M=20.01 years) 
completed 90-minute individual interviews assessing dimensional and thematic 
aspects of the future narrative as well as psychological profile characteristics 
(abstract reasoning, psychological distress, self-concept, and self-esteem). As 
predicted, gender differences emerged in the anticipation and projected timing 
of adulthood transition events. More females than males anticipated marriage and 
parenthood; females also anticipated younger ages at marriage and parenthood 
than males. Examination of adolescents' narratives of the life course beyond the 
adulthood transition revealed greater extensionoverall among males than females. 
No gender differences in extension or densitywere obtained for the anticipated 
occupational domain, and no gender differences were obtained in extension in the 
family domain. Female adolescents, however, anticipated more events in the 
family domain than did males. The findings are discussed in terms of the 
implicit theories of adulthood that inform adolescents' future narratives.

Expected years of life free of chronic condition-induced activity limitations - 
United States, 1999-2008.

Molla MT; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Over the 20th century, the U.S. population has witnessed major changes in fatal 
and nonfatal health outcomes. Mortality has declined, and life expectancy has 
increased continuously; chronic conditions have replaced acute diseases as 
leading causes of both illness and death. During 1900-2008, average life 
expectancy at birth for the total U.S. population increased from 47.3 years in 
1900 to 78.1 years in 2008, a gain of 30.8 years. In addition, an increasing 
proportion of the U.S. population is aged >65 years. According to the U.S. 
Census Bureau estimates, at the beginning of the 20th century, the U.S. 
population aged >65 years constituted only 4.1 percent of the total population; 
by 2008, the percentage of the total U.S. population aged >65 years was 12.8%. 
However, declines in mortality are not necessarily associated with declines in 
morbidity or the consequences of chronic conditions on life activities. The 
possibility that longer life might be accompanied by poor health makes it 
essential to develop measures that account for both mortality and morbidity at 
the same time. Hence, over the past 40 years, a new set of health measures 
(e.g., "healthy life expectancies") have been developed that account for both 
mortality and life spent free of the consequences of ill health. One of these 
newly developed set of measures (called "active life expectancy") is the average 
number of years expected to be lived without activity limitations.

As Pompe disease glycogen storage disease type 2 with a severely reduced life 
expectancy is now a treatable disorder, accurate diagnostic procedures and 
evidence-based indications for therapy are mandatory. We screened the literature 
for consensus reports and published trial data of late-onset Pompe disease. 
These data were summarized in a Delphi consensus method approach. The clinical 
suspicion of late-onset Pompe disease should be substantiated by the validated 
dry blood spot test measurement for acid α-glucosidase activity. Alternatively, 
enzyme activity analysis in lymphocytes is also feasible. Glucosidase α gene 
sequencing for verifying the diagnosis is recommended. A muscle biopsy including 
measurements of acid α-glucosidase activity and glycogen concentration is 
warranted for differential diagnosis in selected cases. The confirmed diagnosis 
should lead to a multidisciplinary treatment approach, possibly including enzyme 
replacement therapy.

Gerardo, via Pergolesi 33, Monza (MB), 20900, Italy, erikpietros@tiscali.it.

The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are multisystemic inherited metabolic diseases 
caused by the deficiency of the enzymes involved in the degradation of 
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which variably involve the central nervous system, 
heart, lungs, and bones.Undegraded or only partly degraded GAGs accumulate in 
the extracellular matrix, joint fluid, and connective tissue leading to 
widespread tissue and organ dysfunction.The introduction of hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (HSCT) and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has positively 
affected the natural history of MPS patients and their life expectancy. However, 
the presence of spinal abnormalities and deposition of GAGs in soft tissues 
remains nearly unaltered.Abnormalities of the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) and 
GAG deposits can result in spinal cord compression with slowly progressive 
myelopathy or acute posttraumatic tetraplegia.The current paper discusses 
neuroimaging findings in a consecutive series of 42 MPS patients followed at our 
Center for Metabolic Diseases and their neurosurgical issues.Current 
recommendations for decompression and fusion will be discussed according to our 
experience and review of the literature.

Patient-reported outcomes in ovarian cancer clinical trials.

Friedlander ML(1), King MT.

Author information:
(1)Australia and New Zealand Gynaecology Oncology Group (ANZGOG) Level 4, 
Camperdown, New South Wales.

There is general acceptance of the importance of incorporating patient-reported 
outcome (PRO) measures including health-related quality of life (HRQOL) into 
clinical trials, and there are now a number of guidance documents available on 
how to use PRO's for regulatory authorities and in comparative effectiveness 
research. The methods used to collect, analyse and report PRO data in clinical 
trials have received considerable scrutiny, revealing many shortcomings in the 
standard of reporting of HRQOL in clinical trials as well as in how PRO's have 
been selected and analysed in clinical trials. This has led to the recent 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Clinical Trials-PRO extension statement 
which lays down a framework for selection and reporting analysis of PROs, either 
as primary or secondary trial end points, thus ensuring scientific rigour. 
Adherence to these guidelines can only improve the conduct of clinical trials 
and interpretation of their results, which may help avoid missing out on 
opportunities as in the past. We review pertinent literature on PRO measures and 
discuss how various recent PRO guidance documents should be applied to ovarian 
cancer clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of personalised treatment for 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using clinical response and serum adalimumab levels.
METHODS: A personalised treatment algorithm defined, based on clinical (European 
League Against Rheumatism) response and drug levels at 6 months, whether 
adalimumab treatment should be continued in a specific dose or discontinued 
and/or switched to a next biological. Outcomes were simulated using a patient 
level Markov model, with 3 months cycles, based on a cohort of 272 
adalimumab-treated patients with RA for 3 years and data of patients from the 
Utrecht Rheumatoid Arthritis Cohort. Costs, clinical effectiveness and quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared with outcomes as observed in usual 
care and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Analyses were 
performed probabilistically.
RESULTS: Clinical effectiveness was higher for the cohort simulated to receive 
personalised care compared with usual care; the average difference in QALYs was 
3.84 (95 percentile range -8.39 to 16.20). Costs were saved on drugs: 
€2 314 354. Testing costs amounted to €10 872. Mean total savings were 
€2 561 648 (95 percentile range -3 252 529 to -1 898 087), resulting in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €666 500 or €646 266 saved per QALY 
gained from a societal or healthcare perspective, respectively. In 72% of 
simulations personalised care saved costs and resulted in more QALYs, in 28% it 
was cost saving with lower QALYs. Scenario analyses showed cost saving along 
with QALYs gain or limited loss.
CONCLUSIONS: Tailoring biological treatment to individual patients with RA 
starting adalimumab using drug levels and short-term outcome is cost-effective. 
Results underscore the potential merit of personalised biological treatment in 
RA.

Parenting considerations in young adults with perinatally acquired HIV.

Evangeli M(1), Greenhalgh C, Frize G, Foster C, Fidler S.

Surrey , UK.

An increasing number of children born with perinatally acquired HIV (PAH) are 
surviving into late adolescence and early adulthood. At this developmental 
stage, developing intimate relationships and having children are potentially 
important goals with associated normative challenges. Young people with PAH face 
a variety of additional HIV-related stressors that may be associated with 
relationships and parenting. These may include managing HIV disclosure to their 
partner and adherence to antiretroviral medication to (a) prevent transmission 
to partners and future offspring and (b) maintain their own health. Some of 
these challenges may be impacted upon by issues associated with having been born 
with HIV, for example, managing long-standing secrecy about HIV and having been 
told from a young age that life expectancy could be shortened. To date, there 
has been limited research into the procreational and parenting reflections of 
young people with PAH. This study examined the hopes and the concerns that a
