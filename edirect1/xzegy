INTRODUCTION: Optimal radiotherapy utilisation (RTU) modelling estimates the 
proportion of people with cancer who would benefit from radiotherapy. Assessment 
of comorbidities is an important component of the assessment of suitability for 
radiotherapy in addition to chronological age and life expectancy. Comorbidities 
have not been considered in previous optimal RTU models. We aimed to develop an 
age- and comorbidity- adjusted optimal RTU model for patients with lung, rectal, 
prostate, and cervical cancer, and compare them to actual RTU rates, with a 
particular focus on those aged 80+ years, METHODS: New South Wales (NSW) Cancer 
Registry data (2010-2014) linked to radiotherapy data (2010-2015) and 
hospitalisation data (2008-2015) were used to determine the number of patients 
diagnosed with lung, rectal, prostate and cervical cancer. The Cancer Specific 
C3 'all sites' comorbidity index was calculated from hospital diagnosis data for 
each patient to determine suitability for radiotherapy. The index was then 
incorporated into a tumour site-specific decision tree model. The actual RTU was 
also calculated using the linked datasets.
RESULTS: 14,696 patients were diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
1839 with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), 5551 with rectal cancer, 30,935 with 
prostate cancer and 1216 with cervical cancer in New South Wales from 2010-2014. 
The proportion of patients aged 80+ years at cancer diagnosis was 25% (3603 
patients), 15% (279 patients), 17% (943 patients), 12% (3745 patients), and 7% 
(88 patients) respectively. The age- and comorbidity- adjusted optimal RTU rates 
for patients aged 80+ years using the C3 index were 49% (NSCLC), 49% (SCLC), 43% 
(rectal), 51% (prostate) and 40% (cervical). The corresponding actual RTU rates 
for patients aged 80+ years were 25%, 32%, 27%, 16%, and 56%.
CONCLUSION: Even after adjusting for age and comorbidities, the actual 
radiotherapy utilisation rates were lower than optimal radiotherapy utilisation 
rates in patients aged 80+ years except for patients with cervical cancer. This 
warrants further assessment and research into reasons and solutions.

Cerebellar circuitry is topographically arranged in closed loops with the 
cerebral cortex. The three cornerstones of clinical ataxia have emerged from 
studies on connectional anatomy and from clinical/neuropsychological 
observations, leading to the definition of clinical syndromes encountered in 
daily practice: (a) the cerebellar motor syndrome (CMS), (b) the 
vestibulocerebellar syndrome (VCS), and (c) the cerebellar cognitive affective 
syndrome/Schmahmann syndrome (CCAS/SS). These syndromes are either isolated or 
coexist, depending on the underlying pathological process and its degree of 
extension within the cerebellum. Dysmetria is the core feature of cerebellar 
deficits, encompassing motor dysmetria (hypermetria, hypometria) in CMS, 
oculomotor dysmetria in VCS, and dysmetria of thought in CCAS/SS. The leading 
hypothesis is that dysmetria results from errors in building or maintaining 
internal models, which are inherent to predictive behavior. Errors in prediction 
would lead to clumsiness and incoordination of limbs, oculomotor impairments, 
and aberrant cognitive/affective behavior. The cerebellum is currently viewed as 
a learning machine enriched with multiple plasticity mechanisms, allowing the 
permanent adaptation to the external world by generating and maintaining 
predictive operations, from motor to cognitive, affective, emotional, and social 
operations essential for daily human life.

Evidence shows a growing trend of the HIV epidemic in the Middle East and North 
Africa (MENA). We aimed to project the incidence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in the region from 1990 to 2019 and assess 
its trend by 2025, and 2030. We extracted the HIV incidence, mortality, and DALY 
data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and UNAIDS databases. The joinpoint 
regression model was used to examine changes in HIV trends. The trend changes 
were estimated by average annual percent change (AAPC). In most countries, an 
increasing trend was observed in HIV incidence, mortality, and DALY. 
Specifically, the highest growth in the annual incidence rate was related to 
Egypt (AAPC = 14.4, GBD) and Iran (AAPC = 9.6, UNAIDS). Notably, Qatar 
(AAPC = - 5.6, GBD), Bahrain (AAPC = - 3.3, GBD), and Somalia (AAPC = - 4.2, 
UNAIDS) demonstrated a significant reduction in incidence. Regarding mortality 
rates, Djibouti (AAPC = 24.2, GBD) and Iran (AAPC = 16.2, UNAIDS) exhibited a 
significant increasing pattern. Furthermore, the estimated increase in incidence 
by 2030 was most marked in Djibouti (985%) and Iran (174%). Iran (422%) and 
Egypt (339%) showed a prominent rise in mortality rates. GBD data showed 16 
countries had an increasing pattern in DALY in both genders. According to age 
and period effects, there was a significant upward trend in incidence, mortality 
rates, and DALY. Findings highlighted the urgent need for improved prevention 
and treatment services, including expanding access to HIV testing, promoting 
safe practices, increasing antiretroviral therapy coverage, and supporting 
targeted interventions for high-risk populations.

In April 2023, following the annual International Committee on Taxonomy of 
Viruses (ICTV) ratification vote on newly proposed taxa, the phylum 
Negarnaviricota was amended and emended. The phylum was expanded by one new 
family, 14 new genera, and 140 new species. Two genera and 538 species were 
renamed. One species was moved, and four were abolished. This article presents 
the updated taxonomy of Negarnaviricota as now accepted by the ICTV.

Obesity is a growing public health epidemic worldwide and is implicated in 
slowing improved life expectancy and increasing cardiovascular (CV) risk; 
indeed, several obesity-related mechanisms drive structural, functional, 
humoral, and hemodynamic heart alterations. On the other hand, obesity may 
indirectly cause CV disease, mediated through different obesity-associated 
comorbidities. Diet and physical activity are key points in preventing CV 
disease and reducing CV risk; however, these strategies alone are not always 
sufficient, so other approaches, such as pharmacological treatments and 
bariatric surgery, must support them. Moreover, these strategies are associated 
with improved CV risk factors and effectively reduce the incidence of death and 
CV events such as myocardial infarction and stroke; consequently, an 
individualized care plan with a multidisciplinary approach is recommended. More 
precisely, this review explores several interventions (diet, physical activity, 
pharmacological and surgical treatments) to address CV risk in obese patients 
and emphasizes the importance of adherence to treatments.

Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of mortality worldwide. 
Hypertension is a preventable risk factor leading to major cardiovascular 
events. We have not found a comprehensive study investigating Central and 
Eastern European hypertensive patients' complex metabolic status. Therefore, our 
goal was to calculate the prevalence of hypertension and associated metabolic 
abnormalities using data-mining methods in our region. We assessed the data of 
adults who visited the University of Debrecen Clinical Center's hospital (n = 
937,249). The study encompassed data from a period of 20 years (2001-2021). We 
detected 292,561 hypertensive patients. The calculated prevalence of 
hypertension was altogether 32.2%. Markedly higher body mass index values were 
found in hypertensive patients as compared to non-hypertensives. Significantly 
higher triglyceride and lower HDL-C levels were found in adults from 18 to 80 
years old. Furthermore, significantly higher serum glucose and uric acid levels 
were measured in hypertensive subjects. Our study confirms that the calculated 
prevalence of hypertension is akin to international findings and highlights the 
extensive association of metabolic alterations. These findings emphasize the 
role of early recognition and immediate treatment of cardiometabolic 
abnormalities to improve the quality of life and life expectancy of hypertensive 
patients.

Paracoccus marginatus is a highly polyphagous invasive pest that poses a 
significant quarantine threat to tropical and subtropical countries. Infested 
commodities in international trade should undergo phytosanitary treatment, and 
irradiation is recommended as a viable alternative to replace methyl bromide 
fumigation. Dose-response tests were conducted on the 2-, 4-, and 6-day-old eggs 
and gravid females of P. marginatus using the X-ray radiation doses of 15-105 Gy 
with an interval of 15 Gy. Radiotolerance was compared using ANOVA, fiducial 
overlapping and lethal dose ratio (LDR) test, resulting in no significant 
difference among treatments, except for the overall mortality and LDR at LD90 (a 
dose causing 90% mortality at 95% confidence level). The estimated dose for 
LD99.9968 was 176.5-185.2 Gy, which was validated in the confirmatory tests. No 
nymphs emerged from a total of 60,386 gravid females exposed to a gamma 
radiation dose range of 146.8-185.0 Gy in the confirmatory tests. The largest 
dose in confirmatory tests should be the minimum threshold for phytosanitary 
treatment, consequently, a minimum dose of 185 Gy is recommended for the 
phytosanitary irradiation treatment of papaya mealybug-infested commodities, 
ensuring a treatment efficacy of ≥99.9950% at 95% confidence level.

The increase in the life expectancy average has led to a growing elderly 
population, thus leading to a prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders, such as 
Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is the second most common neurodegenerative 
disorder and is characterized by a progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic 
neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The marine environment has 
proven to be a source of unique and diverse chemical structures with great 
therapeutic potential to be used in the treatment of several pathologies, 
including neurodegenerative impairments. This review is focused on compounds 
isolated from marine organisms with neuroprotective activities on in vitro and 
in vivo models based on their chemical structures, taxonomy, neuroprotective 
effects, and their possible mechanism of action in PD. About 60 compounds 
isolated from marine bacteria, fungi, mollusk, sea cucumber, seaweed, soft 
coral, sponge, and starfish with neuroprotective potential on PD therapy are 
reported. Peptides, alkaloids, quinones, terpenes, polysaccharides, polyphenols, 
lipids, pigments, and mycotoxins were isolated from those marine organisms. They 
can act in several PD hallmarks, reducing oxidative stress, preventing 
mitochondrial dysfunction, α-synuclein aggregation, and blocking inflammatory 
pathways through the inhibition translocation of NF-kB factor, reduction of 
human tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). This review 
gathers the marine natural products that have shown pharmacological activities 
acting on targets belonging to different intracellular signaling pathways 
related to PD development, which should be considered for future pre-clinical 
studies.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is common in Ethiopia, but the national guideline 
does not offer specific treatment recommendations. Consequently, different 
treatment regimens are used in the country, without quality evidence. In Boru 
Meda Hospital, sodium stibogluconate (SSG) is routinely used in combination with 
allopurinol for systemic CL treatment, although evidence on its effectiveness is 
limited. An observational cohort study was carried out to document clinical 
treatment outcomes in patients receiving SSG/allopurinol at the end of each 
28-day treatment cycle and after 180 days. Patient-reported outcomes were 
assessed by asking patients to rate lesion severity, and by the dermatological 
life quality index. A total of 104 patients were included. After one treatment 
cycle, only four patients were clinically cured, although patient-reported 
outcomes significantly improved. The majority (88) of patients were appointed 
for a second treatment cycle, of whom only 37 (42%) attended. Among the 36 
patients who came for final outcome assessment, 50% were cured. Follow-up and 
treatment were severely affected by conflict; drug stock-outs and insufficient 
ward capacity for treatment were additional challenges. The treatment outcomes 
of SSG/allopurinol were relatively poor, and most patients required more than 
one cycle of treatment. Shortages of drugs and beds indicate the existing gaps 
in providing CL treatment in Ethiopia.

BACKGROUND: Cancers are as common in individuals with intellectual disabilities 
as in the general population (GP). For the subgroup of people with profound and 
multiple disabilities (PMD) who present with both severe intellectual disability 
and major motor disorders, the frequency and distribution of cancers are 
currently not known, preventing proper cancer surveillance.
METHODS: We carried out a systematic and synthetic review of the medical 
literature, including a focused search of Japanese data.
RESULTS: The total risk of cancer in individuals with PMD is thought to be lower 
than in the GP, possibly due to a shorter life expectancy. They have reduced 
exposure to cancer risk factors, such as alcohol, tobacco, sunlight, human 
papillomavirus infection, occupational toxins, and being overweight. On the 
other hand, individuals with PMD present a greater frequency of gastroesophageal 
reflux disease, Helicobacter pylori gastritis, chronic cystitis, and 
cryptorchidism, which increase the risk for cancer of the esophagus, stomach, 
urinary bladder, and testes. In addition, certain genetic disorders underlying 
compromised motor and cognitive functions are associated with higher risk of 
childhood cancers. An analysis of 135 cancers in persons with PMD in Japan 
suggested that they present a particular tumor profile, with certain cancers 
rarer than in the GP, whereas cancers of the digestive tract are frequent. 
Cancers of the digestive tract occurred significantly earlier than in the GP 
(colon: average age 48.3 years vs. 71.3 years in the GP, esophagus: 39 years vs. 
72 years in the GP). An increasing number of therapeutic successes in children 
and adults with PMD have been reported in different countries when cancers are 
discovered early.
CONCLUSION: Individuals with PMD must be appropriately monitored for cancer. 
Screenings for breast and colon cancer, as well as regular monitoring of the 
esophagus, stomach, urinary bladder, and testicles, are necessary. 
Population-based epidemiological studies are needed to better understand risk 
factors, frequency, and distribution of cancers in the PMD population.

Small Molecules against Metastatic Tumors: Concrete Perspectives and Shattered 
Dreams.

Metastasis is the main cause of anti-cancer therapy failure, leading to 
unfavorable prognosis for patients. The true challenge to increase cancer 
patient life expectancy by making cancer a chronic disease with periodic but 
manageable relapses relies on the development of efficient therapeutic 
strategies specifically directed against key targets in the metastatic process. 
Traditional chemotherapy with classical alkylating agents, microtubule 
inhibitors, and antimetabolites has demonstrated its limited efficacy against 
metastatic cells due to their capacity to select chemo-resistant cell 
populations that undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thus 
promoting the colonization of distant sites that, in turn, sustain the initial 
metastatic process. This scenario has prompted efforts aimed at discovering a 
wide variety of small molecules and biologics as potential anti-metastatic drugs 
directed against more specific targets known to be involved in the various 
stages of metastasis. In this short review, we give an overview of the most 
recent advances related to important families of antimetastatic small molecules: 
intracellular tyrosine kinase inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, 
KRAS inhibitors, and integrin antagonists. Although the majority of these small 
molecules are not yet approved and not available in the drug market, any 
information related to their stage of development could represent a precious and 
valuable tool to identify new targets in the endless fight against metastasis.

Optimal Dosing and Patient Selection for Electrochemotherapy in Solid Abdominal 
Organ and Bone Tumors.

(1)Division of Surgical Oncology, Department of Surgery, University of 
Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.

The primary aim of this study was to analyze studies that use 
electrochemotherapy (ECT) in "deep-seated" tumors in solid organs (liver, 
kidney, bone metastasis, pancreas, and abdomen) and understand the similarities 
between patient selection, oncologic selection, and use of new procedures and 
technology across the organ systems to assess response rates. A literature 
search was conducted using the term "Electrochemotherapy" in the title field 
using publications from 2017 to 2023. After factoring in inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, 29 studies were analyzed and graded based on quality in full. The 
authors determined key patient and oncologic selection characteristics and ECT 
technology employed across organ systems that yielded overall responses, 
complete responses, and partial responses of the treated tumor. It was 
determined that key selection factors included: the ability to be administered 
bleomycin, life expectancy greater than three months, unrespectability of the 
lesion being treated, and a later stage, more advanced cancer. Regarding 
oncologic selection, all patient cohorts had received chemotherapy or surgery 
previously but had disease recurrence, making ECT the only option for further 
treatment. Lastly, in terms of the use of technology, the authors found that 
studies with better response rates used the ClinporatorTM and updated procedural 
guidelines by SOP. Thus, by considering patient, oncologic, and technology 
selection, ECT can be further improved in treating lesions in solid organs.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in 
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially in end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) patients and during the first year after transplantation. For 
these reasons, and due to the shortage of organs available for transplant, it is 
of utmost importance to identify patients with a good life expectancy after 
transplant and minimize the transplant peri-operative risk. Various conditions, 
such as severe pulmonary diseases, recent myocardial infarction or stroke, and 
severe aorto-iliac atherosclerosis, need to be ruled out before adding a patient 
to the transplant waiting list. The effectiveness of systematic coronary artery 
disease (CAD) treatment before kidney transplant is still debated, and there is 
no universal screening protocol, not to mention that a nontailored screening 
could lead to unnecessary invasive procedures and delay or exclude some patients 
from transplantation. Despite the different clinical guidelines on CAD screening 
in kidney transplant candidates that exist, up to today, there is no worldwide 
universal protocol. This review summarizes the key points of cardiovascular risk 
assessment in renal transplant candidates and faces the role of noninvasive 
cardiovascular imaging tools and the impact of coronary revascularization versus 
best medical therapy before kidney transplant on a patient's cardiovascular 
outcome.

In recent years, there has been increasing concern about the safety of additives 
used to extend the shelf-life of food products. As a result, lycopene, a natural 
phytochemical compound, has attracted attention, as it has been demonstrated to 
be a potential alternative to traditional artificial antioxidants, with 
significant health benefits when applied to food preservation. Based on this, 
this review introduces the specific forms of lycopene currently used as an 
antioxidant in foods, both in its naturally occurring forms in fruits and 
vegetables and in artificially added forms involving technologies such as 
composite coating, active film packaging, emulsion, and microcapsules. In 
addition, it also provides a comprehensive summary of the effects and progress 
of lycopene in the preservation of different types of food products, such as 
meat, seafood, oil, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables, in the last decade. 
At last, it also points out the limitations of lycopene, including its 
insolubility in water, dark color, and high sensitivity to heat or light, as 
well as the potential solutions to load lycopene on suitable carriers, such as 
combining lycopene with antimicrobial substances or other actives, in order to 
broaden its applications as an antioxidant in future foods.
