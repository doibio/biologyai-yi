distribution may be beneficial in developing lead testing methods, guiding 
implantations and improving life expectancy of implanted leads.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this two-phase study was to develop and test a novel 
biplane cine-fluoroscopy-based method to evaluate input parameters for bending 
stress in leads based on their in vivo 3D motion using precisely determined 
spatial distributions of lead curvatures. Potential tensile, compressive or 
torque forces were not subjects of this study.
METHODS: A method to measure lead curvature and curvature evolution was 
initially tested in a phantom study. In the second phase using this model 51 
patients with implanted ICD leads were included. A biplane cine-fluoroscopy 
recording of the intracardiac region of the lead was performed. The lead 
centerline and its motion were reconstructed in 3D and used to define lead 
curvature and curvature changes. The maximum absolute curvature Cmax during a 
cardiac cycle, the maximum curvature amplitude Camp and the maximum curvature 
Cmax@amp at the location of Camp were calculated. These parameters can be used 
to characterize fatigue stress in a lead under cyclical bending.
RESULTS: The medians of Camp and Cmax@amp were 0.18 cm-1 and 0.42 cm-1, 
respectively. The median location of Cmax was in the atrium whereas the median 
location of Camp occurred close to where the transit through the tricuspid valve 
can be assumed. Increased curvatures were found for higher slack grades.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reconstruction of 3D ICD lead motion is 
feasible using biplane cine-fluoroscopy. Lead curvatures can be computed with 
high accuracy and the results can be implemented to improve lead design and 
testing.

In a digital society, shall we be the authors of our own experience, not only 
during our lifetime but also after we die? We ask this question because dying 
and bereavement have become even harder, and much less private, in the digital 
age. New big data-driven digital industries and technologies are on the rise, 
with promises of interactive 3D avatars and storage of digital memories of the 
deceased, so they can continue to exist online as the "living dead" in a digital 
afterlife. Famous rock and roll icons like Roy Orbison, Frank Zappa, Ronnie 
James Dio, and Amy Winehouse have famously been turned into holograms that can 
once again give "live" performances on the touring circuit, often pulling in 
large audiences. Death studies, dying, and grief have become virtual in the 21st 
century. We live in truly unprecedented times for human-computer interactions. 
Thanatology is the scientific study of death, dying, loss, and grief. In 
contrast to the biological study of biological aging (cellular senescence) and 
programmed cell death (apoptosis), thanatology employs multiple professional 
lenses, medical, psychological, physical, spiritual, ethical, descriptive, and 
normative. In 1997, Carla Sofka introduced the term thanatechnology as 
"technological mechanisms such as interactive videodiscs and computer programs 
that are used to access information or aid in learning about thanatology 
topics." Onward to 2021, the advent of social media, the Internet of Things, and 
sensors that digitize and archive nearly every human movement and experience are 
taking thanatechnology, and by extension, digital transformation, to new 
heights. For example, what happens to digital remains of persons once they cease 
to exist physically? This article offers a critical study and snapshot of this 
nascent field, and the "un-disciplinary" sociotechnical issues digital 
thanatechnologies raise in relation to big data. We also discuss how best to 
critically govern this new frontier in systems science and the digital society. 
We suggest that new policy narratives such as (1) the right to nonparticipation 
in relation to information and communication technologies and (2) the planetary 
public goods deserve further attention to democratize thanatechnology and big 
data. To the extent that systems science often depends on data from online 
platforms, for example, in times of pandemics and ecological crises, "critical 
thanatechnology studies," introduced in this article, is a timely and essential 
field of scholarship with broad importance for systems science and planetary 
health.

Congestive Heart Filur is an epidemic and its trajectory apppears to be 
escaling. Undoubtly tremendous gains have seen improvement in life expectancy 
and quality of life, however, hospital readmissions, resource utilization and 
health system cost continue to create challenges. In this short perspective, we 
raise the prospect of extending the research phases the community and real world 
setting. Logistic have supported service supply chains during the COVID-19 
pandemic and there are lesson here to be learned.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost effectiveness of cochlear implantation (CI) for 
the treatment of single-sided deafness (SSD).
STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis in an adapted Markov model.
SETTING: Adults with single-sided deafness in a high-income country.
INTERVENTION: Unilateral CI was compared with no intervention.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were compared with 
different cost-effectiveness thresholds ($10,000 to $150,000) for different age, 
sex, and cost combinations. The calculations were based on the quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY), national life expectancy tables, and different cost settings. 
The health utility values for the QALY were either directly collected from 
published data, or, derived from published data using a regression model of 
multiple utility indices (regression estimate).
RESULTS: The regression estimate showed an increase of the health utility value 
from 0.62 to 0.74 for SSD patients who underwent CI. CI for SSD was cost 
effective for women up to 64 years ($50,000 per-QALY threshold), 80 years 
($100,000 per-QALY threshold), and 86 years ($150,000 per-QALY threshold). For 
men, these values were 58, 77, and 84, respectively. Changing the discount rate 
by up to 5% further increased the cutoff ages up to 5 years. A detailed cost and 
age sensitivity analysis is presented and allows testing for cost effectiveness 
in local settings worldwide.
CONCLUSIONS: CI is a cost-effective option to treat patients with SSD.

Ganciclovir (GCV) is the first-line therapy against human cytomegalovirus 
(HCMV), a widespread infection that is particularly dangerous for 
immunodeficient individuals. Closely resembling deoxyguanosine triphosphate, the 
tri-phosphorylated metabolite of GCV (GCV-TP) is preferentially incorporated by 
the viral DNA polymerase, thereby terminating chain extension and, eventually, 
viral replication. However, the treatment outcome of GCV varies greatly among 
individuals, therefore warranting better understanding of its metabolism. Here 
we show that NUDT15, a Nudix hydrolase known to metabolize thiopurine 
triphosphates, can similarly hydrolyze GCV-TP through biochemical studies and 
co-crystallization of the NUDT15/GCV-TP complex. More critically, GCV efficacy 
was potentiated in HCMV-infected cells following NUDT15 depletion by RNAi or 
inhibition by an in-house-developed, nanomolar NUDT15 inhibitor, TH8321, 
suggesting that pharmacological targeting of NUDT15 is a possible avenue to 
improve existing anti-HCMV regimens. Collectively, the data further implicate 
NUDT15 as a broad-spectrum metabolic regulator of nucleoside analog 
therapeutics, such as thiopurines and GCV.

Junctional coupling between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+-sensor STIM proteins 
and plasma membrane (PM) Orai channels mediates Ca2+ signals in most cells. We 
reveal that PM-tethered, fluorescently tagged C-terminal M4x (fourth 
transmembrane helix contains a cytoplasmic C-terminal extension) peptides from 
Orai channels undergo a Leu-specific signature of direct interaction with the 
STIM1 Orai-activating region (SOAR), exactly mimicking STIM1 binding to gate 
Orai channels. The 20-amino-acid Orai3-M4x peptide associates avidly with STIM1 
within ER-PM junctions, functions to competitively block native Ca2+ signals, 
and mediates a key modification of STIM-Orai coupling induced by 
2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate. By blocking STIM-Orai coupling, the Orai3-M4x 
peptide reveals the critical role of Orai channels in driving Ca2+ oscillatory 
signals and transcriptional control through NFAT. The M4x peptides interact 
independently with SOAR dimers consistent with unimolecular coupling between 
Orai subunits and STIM1 dimers. We reveal the critical role of M4x helices in 
defining the coupling interface between STIM and Orai proteins to mediate 
store-operated Ca2+ signals.

AIMS: The prevalence of ipsilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA) is rising in concert with life expectancy, putting more 
patients at risk for interprosthetic femur fractures (IPFFs). Our study aimed to 
assess treatment methodologies, implant survivorship, and IPFF clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: A total of 76 patients treated for an IPFF from February 1985 to April 
2018 were reviewed. Prior to fracture, at the hip/knee sites respectively, 46 
femora had primary/primary, 21 had revision/primary, three had primary/revision, 
and six had revision/revision components. Mean age and BMI were 74 years (33 to 
99) and 30 kg/m2 (21 to 46), respectively. Mean follow-up after fracture 
treatment was seven years (2 to 24).
RESULTS: Overall, 59 fractures were classified as Vancouver C (Unified 
Classification System (UCS) D), 17 were Vancouver B (UCS B). In total, 57 
patients (75%) were treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF); 
three developed nonunion, three developed periprosthetic joint infection, and 
two developed aseptic loosening. In all, 18 patients (24%) underwent revision 
arthroplasty including 13 revision THAs, four distal femoral arthroplasties 
(DFAs), and one revision TKA: of these, one patient developed aseptic loosening 
and two developed nonunion. Survivorship free from any reoperation was 82% (95% 
confidence interval (CI) 66.9% to 90.6%) and 77% (95% CI 49.4% to 90.7%) in the 
ORIF and revision groups at two years, respectively. ORIF patients who went on 
to union tended to have stemmed knee components and greater mean interprosthetic 
distance (IPD = 189 mm (SD 73.6) vs 163 mm (SD 36.7); p = 0.546) than nonunited 
fractures. Patients who went on to nonunion in the revision arthroplasty group 
had higher medullary diameter: cortical width ratio (2.5 (SD 1.7) vs 1.3 (SD 
0.3); p = 0.008) and lower IPD (36 mm (SD 30.6) vs 214 mm (SD 32.1); p < 0.001). 
At latest follow-up, 95% of patients (n = 72) were ambulatory.
CONCLUSION: Interprosthetic femur fractures are technically and biologically 
challenging cases. Individualized approaches to internal fixation versus 
revision arthroplasty led to an 81% (95% CI 68.3% to 88.6%) survivorship free 
from reoperation at two years with 95% of patients ambulatory. Continued 
improvements in management are warranted. Cite this article: Bone Joint

AIMS: The aim of the Scaphoid Waist Internal Fixation for Fractures Trial 
(SWIFFT) was to determine the optimal treatment for adults with a bicortical 
undisplaced or minimally displaced fracture of the waist of the scaphoid, 
comparing early surgical fixation with initial cast immobilization, with 
immediate fixation being offered to patients with nonunion.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to assess the relative 
merits of these forms of treatment. The differences in costs to the healthcare 
system and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the patients over the one-year 
follow-up of the trial in the two treatment arms were estimated using regression 
analysis.
RESULTS: Our base case analysis found that patients randomized to early surgical 
fixation had statistically significantly higher mean costs to the NHS of £1,295 
more than for the cast immobilization arm (p < 0.001), primarily due to the cost 
of surgery. They also had a marginally better quality of life, over the period, 
of 0.0158 QALYs; however, this was not statistically significant (p = 0.379). 
The mean combined cost per additional QALY was £81,962, well above the accepted 
threshold for cost-effectiveness used in the UK and internationally. The 
probability of early surgery being cost-effective in this setting was only 5.6%.
CONCLUSION: Consistent with the clinical findings of SWIFFT, these results 
indicate that initial cast immobilization of minimally displaced scaphoid 
fractures, with immediate fixation only offered to patients with nonunion, is 
the optimal form of treatment, resulting in comparable outcomes with less cost 
to the healthcare system. Cite this article: Bone Joint

BACKGROUND: The extension of palliative care services to meet the needs of 
patients with chronic non-malignant life-limiting conditions faces 
misconceptions amongst healthcare professionals. A study of prevailing 
perceptions of healthcare professionals on this wider palliative care service 
was thus conducted to identify current obstacles, guide the education of local 
healthcare professionals and improve service accessibility.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out at the Singapore General 
Hospital. An anonymised and close-ended online questionnaire was disseminated to 
120 physicians and 500 nurses in the Department of Internal Medicine. The online 
survey tool focused on participant demographics; perceptions of palliative care 
and its perceived benefits; roles and indications; and attitudes and behaviours 
towards palliative care referrals.
RESULTS: Forty four physicians and 156 nurses suggested that care of terminally 
ill patients with chronic non-malignant life-limiting conditions are compromised 
by concerns over the role of palliative care in non-cancer care and lapses in 
their prognostication and communication skills. Respondents also raised concerns 
about their ability to confront sociocultural issues and introduce palliative 
care services to patients and their families.
CONCLUSIONS: Gaps in understanding and the ability of nurses and physicians to 
communicate end of life issues, introduce palliative care services to patients 
and their families and confront sociocultural issues suggest the need for a 
longitudinal training program. With similar concerns likely prevalent in other

The Philadelphia negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) compromise a 
heterogeneous group of clonal myeloid stem cell disorders comprising 
polycythaemia vera, essential thrombocythaemia and primary myelofibrosis. 
Despite distinct clinical entities, these disorders are linked by morphological 
similarities and propensity to thrombotic complications and leukaemic 
transformation. Current therapeutic options are limited in disease-modifying 
activity with a focus on the prevention of thrombus formation. Constitutive 
activation of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway is a hallmark of pathogenesis 
across the disease spectrum with driving mutations in JAK2, CALR and MPL 
identified in the majority of patients. Co-occurring somatic mutations in genes 
associated with epigenetic regulation, transcriptional control and splicing of 
RNA are variably but recurrently identified across the MPN disease spectrum, 
whilst epigenetic contributors to disease are increasingly recognised. The 
prognostic implications of one MPN diagnosis may significantly limit life 
expectancy, whilst another may have limited impact depending on the disease 
phenotype, genotype and other external factors. The genetic and clinical 
similarities and differences in these disorders have provided a unique 
opportunity to understand the relative contributions to MPN, myeloid and cancer 
biology generally from specific genetic and epigenetic changes. This review 
provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular pathophysiology of MPN 
exploring the role of driver mutations, co-occurring mutations, dysregulation of 
intrinsic cell signalling, epigenetic regulation and genetic predisposing 
factors highlighting important areas for future consideration.

BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare disease associated with 
cognitive impairment, hypotonia, hyperphagia (an insatiable hunger), and 
obesity. Therapies that target hyperphagia are in development, but understanding 
the value of these therapies to inform patient-focused drug development (PFDD) 
requires valid data on disease burden. We estimated disease burden by measuring 
and comparing quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for 3 PWS health states 
relevant to current PFDD initiatives.
METHODS: Time trade-off (TTO) and a visual analog scale (VAS) were used to 
elicit PWS caregivers' values for 3 fixed health states for a standardized 
patient described with (1) untreated PWS, (2) PWS with controlled obesity, and 
(3) PWS with controlled obesity and hyperphagia. We excluded participants who 
left at least 1 TTO or VAS question blank or incomplete (noncompleters) and 
respondents who reported the same answer for all TTO scenarios (nontraders). The 
remaining group of respondents (traders) were used for all primary analyses. We 
assessed validity and bias of QALY estimates by comparing differences in health 
state valuations, treatment priorities, and characteristics among respondents 
who did and did not complete the TTO.
RESULTS: A total of 458 respondents completed the survey, including 226 traders, 
93 nontraders, and 139 noncompleters. Traders valued untreated PWS at 0.69 
QALYs, PWS with controlled obesity at 0.79 QALYs, and controlled 
hyperphagia/obesity at 0.91 QALY (P < 0.01 for differences among health state 
values). Reported VAS ratings were similar for traders versus nontraders for 
untreated PWS (38.64 vs 38.95, P = 0.89) and PWS with controlled obesity (57.36 
vs 55.14, P = 0.35) but varied for PWS with controlled obesity and hyperphagia 
(70.70 vs 64.46, P = 0.02). Exclusion of noncompleters did not introduce obvious 
bias because traders and noncompleters were similar in treatment priorities and 
characteristics. The exclusion of nontraders did not meaningfully alter mean or 
distribution of valuations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that avoiding hyperphagia decreases the burden of 
PWS and that these results are robust, even once imposing strict inclusion 
criteria. Use of fixed health states to estimate QALYs addresses many of the 
complexities of measuring disease burden in rare and pediatric conditions, 
indicating the potential value of this approach to inform premarket decision 
makers in identifying outcome importance.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are used in clinical trials to provide valuable 
evidence on the impact of disease and treatment on patients' symptoms, function 
and quality of life. High-quality PRO data from trials can inform shared 
decision-making, regulatory and economic analyses and health policy. Recent 
evidence suggests the PRO content of past trial protocols was often incomplete 
or unclear, leading to research waste. To address this issue, international, 
consensus-based, PRO-specific guidelines were developed: the Standard Protocol 
Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT)-PRO Extension. The 
SPIRIT-PRO Extension is a 16-item checklist which aims to improve the content 
and quality of aspects of clinical trial protocols relating to PRO data 
collection to minimise research waste, and ultimately better inform 
patient-centred care. This SPIRIT-PRO explanation and elaboration (E&E) paper 
provides information to promote understanding and facilitate uptake of the 
recommended checklist items, including a comprehensive protocol template. For 
each SPIRIT-PRO item, we provide a detailed description, one or more examples 
from existing trial protocols and supporting empirical evidence of the item's 
importance. We recommend this paper and protocol template be used alongside the 
SPIRIT 2013 and SPIRIT-PRO Extension paper to optimise the transparent 
development and review of trial protocols with PROs.

Purpose Implant-assisted removable partial dentures (IARPDs) with short implants 
improve the oral functions of removable partial dentures (RPDs). This study 
aimed to compare the patient-reported outcomes of RPDs and IARPDs with short 
implants retained by magnetic attachments.Methods We recruited 30 participants 
with mandibular Kennedy Class I or II and distal extension defects of three or 
more teeth. RPDs, IARPDs with a healing cap, and IARPDs with a magnetic 
attachment were evaluated across stages using patient-reported outcomes. All 
participants completed questionnaires (oral health-related quality of life 
[OHRQoL], patient general satisfaction, and patient's denture assessment [PDA]) 
at each stage. The OHRQoL was evaluated using the Oral Health Impact Profile-J 
54 (OHIP-J 54) score. The general patient satisfaction was evaluated using a 100 
mm visual analog scale. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Bonferroni correction 
were used to evaluate differences between the groups (α=0.05).Results The OHRQoL 
of IARPDs was significantly higher than that of RPDs. IARPDs with a magnetic 
attachment had significantly better patient general satisfaction and PDA than 
IARPDs with a healing cap.Conclusions The OHRQoL, patient general satisfaction, 
and PDA were improved by IARPD with a short implant using a magnetic attachment.

BACKGROUND: Roy-Camille reported only three patients in their Type 3 
posttraumatic transverse sacral fracture (TSF) classification. A modified 
Roy-Camille classification has been already proposed by other authors suggesting 
further categorization of the TSFs as partially displaced or completely 
displaced to predict the rate of neurological recovery following lumbopelvic 
fixation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reported three adult cases of surgical fixation of 
fracture-dislocation (3A and 3B) of the sacrum due to traumatic injuries and 
submitted to lumbopelvic posterior reconstruction. A case of a 15-year-old male 
patient affected by Type 3C with vascular pelvic injury was also reported. A 
comprehensive literature search was performed on evaluation and management of 
Type 3 TSFs.
RESULTS: In Type 3A, there is a minimal anterior dislocation and the reduction 
is feasible with good chance of recovery. In Type 3B, the anterior dislocation 
is severe, neurological deficits are present, reduction is difficult, and there 
is a risk of vascular injury both at the trauma and during the surgical 
reduction. In Type 3C, the anterior dislocation is massive, and the risk of 
vascular injury is very high requiring prompt vascular or endovascular 
treatment. Open reduction and posterior instrumentation are technically feasible 
in patients affected by Type 3 high TSFs.
CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, a modified Roy-Camille classification could be 
useful in the assessment of prognostic and therapeutic aspects of such 
fractures, In our opinion, a modified Roy-Camille classification could help 
assess the prognostic and therapeutic aspects of such fractures, in which the 
severity of the dislocation affects the surgical technique, the chance of 
neurological recovery, and the patient's life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: Spinal metastases are the most commonly encountered spinal tumors. 
With increasing life expectancy and better systemic treatment options, the 
incidence of patients seeking treatment for spinal metastasis is rising. Radical 
resections and conventional low-dose radiotherapy have given way to modern 
'separation' surgeries and stereotactic body radiotherapy which entails lesser 
morbidity and improved local control. This article provides an overview of the 
decision making and currently available treatment options for metastatic spinal 
tumors.
METHODS: A MEDLINE literature search was made for studies in English language 
reporting on human subjects, describing results of various treatment options 
that are a part of multidisciplinary management of metastatic spinal tumors. The 
highest-quality evidence available in the literature was reviewed.
DISCUSSION: Treatment of patients with metastatic spinal tumors is largely 
palliative, with radiotherapy and selective surgery being the mainstays of 
management. Multidisciplinary management that incorporates factors like patient 
performance status, expected survival and systemic burden of disease and employs 
well-validated decision-making frameworks for guiding treatment holds the key to 
an effective palliative treatment strategy. Effective pain management, achieving 
local control, adequate neurological decompression in the setting of epidural 
cord compression and surgical stabilization for mechanical stabilization are the 
main goals of treatment.
CONCLUSION: The management of metastatic spinal tumors has been rapidly 
evolving; currently, limited decompression and stabilization followed by 
postoperative SBRT for local tumor control are associated with less morbidity 
and may be referred to as the current standard of care in these patients.

Association of Hispanic ethnicity and linguistic acculturation with 
cardiovascular medication adherence in patients with suspected acute coronary 
syndrome.

Despite a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, 
Hispanic-Americans have lower rates of CVD-related and all-cause mortality, as 
well as higher life expectancy than non-Hispanic whites - a phenomenon known as 
the Hispanic health paradox. However, this survival benefit attenuates with 
increased acculturation to Western lifestyles, potentially due to adoption of 
unhealthy behaviors. Accordingly, we assessed whether Hispanic ethnicity and 
linguistic acculturation, as measured by English proficiency, were associated 
with nonadherence to cardiovascular medications. We enrolled patients presenting 
to an academic medical center emergency department with suspected acute coronary 
syndrome between May 2014 and November 2017. Ethnicity, native language, and 
English proficiency were self-reported. Cardiovascular medication adherence was 
assessed using an electronic pill bottle that recorded the date and time of each 
bottle opening. Generalized linear models with a logit link were used to examine 
the association of Hispanic ethnicity and English proficiency with daily 
cardiovascular medication adherence, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, 
and dosing frequency of the electronically-monitored medication. Among 332 
included patients, mean age was 61.68 ± 12.05 years, 43.07% were women, and 
62.95% were Hispanic, of whom 80.38% were native Spanish-speakers. Overall, 
Hispanics had higher odds of medication adherence than non-Hispanics (adjusted 
OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16-1.49, p < 0.001). However, among native Spanish-speaking 
Hispanics, greater English proficiency was associated with lower odds of 
medication adherence (adjusted OR 0.80 per 1-point increase in English 
proficiency, 95% CI 0.75-0.86, p < 0.001). Although Hispanics had better 
medication adherence than non-Hispanics overall, increased linguistic 
acculturation among native Spanish-speakers was associated with worse adherence 
behaviors.

CONTEXT: Multimorbidity (MM) is a global concern following the increase in life 
expectancy, the conquering of major infectious diseases, and the advances in the 
management of chronic illnesses. It places a substantial burden on patients and 
healthcare systems.
AIMS: This study aims to describe the prevalence and pattern of MM in adults 
among primary healthcare users in Qatar.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study design.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: Data were extracted from the electronic health records of 
patients aged 18 years and above who registered for care with 27 primary health 
centres in Qatar from 1st January 2017 to 30th June 2020. The distribution of MM 
among age groups, gender and nationality was analysed.
RESULTS: In the study population of 7,96,427, the prevalence of MM was found to 
be 22.1%. MM was more prevalent in females (51.2%) than males (48.8%). The 
prevalence of MM showed an increasing trend with increasing age, with a peak of 
25.8% found in the 46-55 age group. Qatari nationals accounted for 32.7% of MM, 
Southeast Asians for 28.3%, North Africans for 16.7% and individuals from other 
Middle Eastern countries for 14.1%. The five most common long-term chronic 
conditions were type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity 
and eczema, with the first three being the most prevalent disease clusters.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that MM is common in Qatar's primary care 
centres. While the prevalence of MM was found to increase with increasing age, 
the largest proportion of patients with MM were those aged 46-55 years. This 
information adds to the available data on MM and directs health policymakers 
towards tailoring the management for the same.
