Comment in
    Lancet. 2022 Aug 20;400(10352):540-541.
    Lancet. 2023 Feb 18;401(10376):555.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the magnitude of cancer burden attributable to 
potentially modifiable risk factors is crucial for development of effective 
prevention and mitigation strategies. We analysed results from the Global Burden 
of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 to inform cancer 
control planning efforts globally.
METHODS: The GBD 2019 comparative risk assessment framework was used to estimate 
cancer burden attributable to behavioural, environmental and occupational, and 
metabolic risk factors. A total of 82 risk-outcome pairs were included on the 
basis of the World Cancer Research Fund criteria. Estimated cancer deaths and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2019 and change in these measures 
between 2010 and 2019 are presented.
FINDINGS: Globally, in 2019, the risk factors included in this analysis 
accounted for 4·45 million (95% uncertainty interval 4·01-4·94) deaths and 105 
million (95·0-116) DALYs for both sexes combined, representing 44·4% (41·3-48·4) 
of all cancer deaths and 42·0% (39·1-45·6) of all DALYs. There were 2·88 million 
(2·60-3·18) risk-attributable cancer deaths in males (50·6% [47·8-54·1] of all 
male cancer deaths) and 1·58 million (1·36-1·84) risk-attributable cancer deaths 
in females (36·3% [32·5-41·3] of all female cancer deaths). The leading risk 
factors at the most detailed level globally for risk-attributable cancer deaths 
and DALYs in 2019 for both sexes combined were smoking, followed by alcohol use 
and high BMI. Risk-attributable cancer burden varied by world region and 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI), with smoking, unsafe sex, and alcohol use being 
the three leading risk factors for risk-attributable cancer DALYs in low SDI 
locations in 2019, whereas DALYs in high SDI locations mirrored the top three 
global risk factor rankings. From 2010 to 2019, global risk-attributable cancer 
deaths increased by 20·4% (12·6-28·4) and DALYs by 16·8% (8·8-25·0), with the 
greatest percentage increase in metabolic risks (34·7% [27·9-42·8] and 33·3% 
[25·8-42·0]).
INTERPRETATION: The leading risk factors contributing to global cancer burden in 
2019 were behavioural, whereas metabolic risk factors saw the largest increases 
between 2010 and 2019. Reducing exposure to these modifiable risk factors would 
decrease cancer mortality and DALY rates worldwide, and policies should be 
tailored appropriately to local cancer risk factor burden.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) are 
rare inherited polyposis syndromes with a high colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. 
Therefore, frequent endoscopic surveillance including polypectomy of relevant 
premalignant lesions from a young age is warranted in patients. In FAP and less 
often in MAP, prophylactic colectomy is indicated followed by lifelong 
endoscopic surveillance of the retained rectum after (sub)total colectomy and 
ileal pouch after proctocolectomy to prevent CRC. No consensus is reached on the 
right type and timing of colectomy. As patients with FAP and MAP nowadays have 
an almost normal life-expectancy due to adequate treatment of colorectal 
polyposis, challenges in the management of FAP and MAP have shifted towards the 
treatment of duodenal and gastric adenomas as well as desmoid treatment in FAP. 
Whereas up until recently upper gastrointestinal surveillance was mostly 
diagnostic and patients were referred for surgery once duodenal or gastric 
polyposis was advanced, nowadays endoscopic treatment of premalignant lesions is 
widely performed. Aiming to reduce polyp burden in the colorectum as well as in 
the upper gastrointestinal tract, several chemopreventive agents are currently 
being studied.

Evaluation of benefits and harms of adaptive screening schedules for lung 
cancer: A microsimulation study.

BACKGROUND: Although lung cancer screening (LCS) has been proven effective in 
reducing lung cancer mortality, it is associated with some potential harms, such 
as false positives and invasive follow-up procedures. Determining the time to 
next screen based on individual risk could reduce harms while maintaining health 
gains. Here, we evaluate the benefits and harms of LCS strategies with adaptive 
schedules, and compare these with those from non-adaptive strategies.
METHODS: We extended the Lee and Zelen risk threshold method to select screening 
schedules based on individual's lung cancer risk and life expectancy (adaptive 
schedules). We compared the health benefits and harms of these adaptive 
schedules with regular (non-adaptive) schedules (annual, biennial and triennial) 
using a validated lung cancer microsimulation model. Outcomes include lung 
cancer deaths (LCD) averted, life years gained (LYG), discounted quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and false positives per LCD averted. We also 
explored the impact of varying screening-related disutilities.
RESULTS: In comparison to standard regular screening recommendations, 
risk-dependent adaptive screening reduced screening harms while maintaining a 
similar level of health benefits. The net gains and the balance of benefits and 
harms from LCS with efficient adaptive schedules were improved compared to those 
from regular screening, especially when the screening-related disutilities are 
high.
CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive screening schedules can reduce the associated harms of 
screening while maintaining its associated lung cancer mortality reductions and 
years of life gained. Our study identifies individually tailored schedules that 
optimize the screening benefit/harm trade-offs.

Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), commonly known as the Kostmann syndrome, is 
a rare and complex set of disorders defined by a lack of neutrophil maturation 
in the bone marrow, leading to life-threatening complications. This case report 
discusses a young adult patient scheduled for elective laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy. The patient presented with skin lesions which are a common 
scenario of Kostmann syndrome, but along with that, our patient posed challenges 
of short neck, limited neck extension, and gynecomastia. These additional 
conditions dramatically increased the challenges for anesthesiologists to 
address the anticipated difficult airway. The anticipated difficult airway 
challenges were handled by following the protocols of difficult airway 
guidelines 2022.

The Impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) on Health 
Outcomes: A Mediating Effect Analysis Based on Cross-National Panel Data.

China.

When ICTs (Information and Communications Technologies) are combined with 
healthcare, they can make a key contribution to gradually improve national 
health outcomes. The global outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 further highlighted the 
important role of e-Health and m-Health service modes. This research structures 
a mediated effect model to explore dynamic relationships between ICT factors, 
ICT impacts, and national health outcomes, among which ICT factors are 
independent variables; ICT impacts are mediating variables, and national health 
outcome indicators selected from United Nations Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) and World Development Indicators are dependent variables. The fixed 
effect model is used to process a set of 141 countries' panel data from 2012 to 
2016 from World Bank and World Economic Forum, while the classical three-step 
test method and Sobel test combined with fixed effects are used to test the 
mediated effects of the panel data. The results show that there are significant 
associations between ICT factors and national health outcome indicators, while 
only some of the partial mediated effects are proved. ICT environment and ICT 
usage can influence both the under-five mortality rate and adolescent fertility 
rate via ICT social impact. However, the mediated effect of ICT social impact on 
maternal mortality ratio and life expectancy at birth has not been confirmed. 
Meanwhile, the mediated effect of ICT economic impact has not been proven. This 
research is an interdisciplinary research in the field of information and 
communication technology and public health and reveals the path and mechanism 
whereby ICT factors improve national health outcomes, which can help global 
policymakers drive the next phase of the implementation of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) and continue to improve the overall health at the 
national level.

Human-induced climate change is fast becoming a climate emergency as we near an 
irreversible point of no return. In our anthropocentric quest to have dominion 
over all the earth, we are putting all of life at risk, including human life and 
civilization. The introduction of collapsology serves as a reality check for 
better understanding the severity and urgency of the present crisis. Moreover, 
because of the deleterious effects of environmental racism and classism, there 
can be no climate justice without racial justice as well. It is hoped that in 
the end there will emerge a more informed pastoral theology and, by extension, a 
more informed pastoral and spiritual care, guided by the findings of climate 
science.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive function is a concern among the elderly, which is related 
to the quality of life, life expectancy, and economic burdens. The relationship 
between blood pressure (BP) control status, visit-to-visit BP variability, and 
cognitive function remains controversial.
METHODS: We aimed to explore the association between BP control status at 
baseline, visit-to-visit BP variability, and cognitive function. This study 
included 3,511 elderlies in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, 
covering four waves for 7-year follow-up (baseline 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018). 
BP was measured in Wave 2011, 2013, and 2015. Cognitive function was measured by 
Mini-Mental State Exam in Wave 2018. Participants were divided into two groups: 
mid-old group for reflecting midlife BP and cognition (45-59 years at baseline 
but aged 60 or over in Wave 2018), and old-old group for reflecting late-life BP 
and cognition (aged 60 or over at baseline). We use univariate analysis and 
general linear model to analyze.
RESULTS: Late-life BP showed stronger associations with cognitive function than 
midlife BP. As to late-life BP control status, controlled hypertension group get 
higher cognitive score than uncontrolled hypertension group in language 
(adjusted β = -0.34, 95%CI -0.68 to 0.00), and untreated hypertension group in 
orientation (adjusted β = -0.41, 95%CI -0.72 to -0.11), language (adjusted β = 
-0.35, 95%CI -0.67 to -0.04), and total (adjusted β = -0.99, 95%CI -1.85 to 
-0.12). Regarding visit-to-visit BP variability, midlife visit-to-visit systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) variability was associated with language (adjusted β = 
-3.70, 95% CI -5.83 to -1.57), while late-life visit-to-visit SBP variability 
was associated with orientation (adjusted β = -2.99, 95% CI -4.84 to -1.14), 
recall (adjusted β = -1.69, 95% CI -2.89 to -0.48), language (adjusted β = 
-2.26, 95% CI -4.13 to -0.38), and total (adjusted β = -9.50, 95% CI -14.71 to 
-4.28); Midlife diastolic blood pressure (DBP) variability and pulse pressure 
(PP) variability showed a significant relationship with language (adjusted β = 
3.25, 95% CI -1.31 to -5.19) and calculation (adjusted β = -0.26, 95% CI -0.47 
to -0.04), respectively. No significant correlation was found between midlife BP 
control status, late-life visit-to-visit DBP variability, late-life 
visit-to-visit PP variability, and cognitive score. There was no significant 
correlation between BP and memory.
CONCLUSIONS: BP control status and visit-to-visit BP variability were 
significantly related to cognitive function among the Chinese elderly. Receiving 
effective late-life antihypertensive treatment and keeping SBP stable might 
contribute to prevent the development of cognitive impairment and dementia, 
especially for orientation and language function.

A clearer understanding of research streams and players involved in efforts to 
address the sustainability of global food and agricultural systems is needed to 
clarify the current state of scientific knowledge and form collaborations to 
pursue future research directions. This study presents new insights into this 
issue through a scientometric process involving a case study of technologies for 
extending fruit shelf-life. The text mining software was utilized to analyze 
3,131 Web of Science-indexed articles published between 2000 and 2020 as a means 
to glean the conceptual structure of current knowledge and conduct a social 
network analysis to explore scientific and publication activity. The findings 
were mapped onto a strategic diagram of research productivity and collaboration 
between players at the national, organizational, and individual levels. This 
research's main findings highlight that research on shelf-life technology is in 
continuous development, and academic institutions from China, Spain, and the 
U.S. are the core national players in this field. The results provide insights 
for further investigation to strengthen co-research and technological 
development programs in other fields. Researchers who are exploring networking 
opportunities can use the model and process presented as a guideline for 
identifying emerging and future research trends and formulating strategies.

BACKGROUND: Rural US populations face a chronic shortage of physicians and an 
increasing gap in life expectancy compared to urban US populations, creating a 
need to understand how to increase residency graduates' desire to practice in 
such areas.
OBJECTIVE: This study quantifies associations between the amount of rural 
training during family medicine (FM) residencies and subsequent rural work.
METHODS: American Medical Association (AMA) Masterfile, AMA graduate medical 
education (GME) supplement, American Board of Family Medicine certification, 
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), and Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services hospital costs data were merged and analyzed. 
Multiple logistic regression measured associations between rural training and 
rural or urban practice in 2018 by all 12 162 clinically active physicians who 
completed a US FM residency accredited by the ACGME between 2008 and 2012. 
Analyses adjusted for key potential confounders (age, sex, program size, region, 
and medical school location and type) and clustering by resident program.
RESULTS: Most (91%, 11 011 of 12 162) residents had no rural training. A 
minority (14%, 1721 of 12 162) practiced in a rural location in 2018. Residents 
with no rural training comprised 80% (1373 of 1721) of those in rural practice 
in 2018. Spending more than half of residency training months in rural areas was 
associated with substantially increased odds of rural practice (OR 5.3-6.3). 
Only 4% (424 of 12 162) of residents spent more than half their training in 
rural locations, and only 5% (26 of 436) of FM training programs had residents 
training mostly in rural settings or community-based clinics.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a linear gradient between increasing levels of rural 
exposure in FM GME and subsequent rural work.

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the agriculture sector and farming communities to 
unprecedented risks. This study investigates the impact of the pandemic, 
identifying the suggestions of community elders for effective resilience via 
in-depth interviews (IDIs) and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). We also examine 
determinants of vegetable farmers' inputs and outputs market participation using 
a binary logit model. The ﬁndings reveal poor business owners' support, 
difficulties accessing inputs and outputs markets, non-availability/shortage of 
inputs recommended by extension services, and poor access to mechanizations. 
Labor shortages, lack of access to agricultural credit, and lack of information 
on innovations and markets are also barriers to market integration of farming 
communities in Pakistan. Results of the logit model show that farming experience 
and support from market owners drive the participation of both the inputs and 
outputs market. Similarly, ownership of personal vehicles and the availability 
of farm machinery drive the participation of farmers in outputs markets. Various 
strategies are suggested to mitigate the risks of the Covid-19 pandemic, 
including the establishment of inputs and outputs markets, strategies for 
transportation, access to information, and farm machinery at the local level.

BACKGROUND: Exercise therapy for patients with pediatric nephrotic syndrome is 
necessary to improve physical function to maintain the patient's activities of 
daily life and school life while managing the risk of relapse; however, few 
studies have examined exercise therapy in the acute phase of the syndrome. This 
case study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of exercise therapy in a 
patient with acute pediatric nephrotic syndrome being treated with steroids.
CASE: The patient was a 10-year-old boy diagnosed with primary nephrotic 
syndrome. Prednisolone (50 mg) was started on the 3rd day of hospitalization. 
Exercise therapy (moderate-intensity, 40 min, five times a week) was started on 
the 15th day. The urine protein/creatinine ratio from the 15th day (at the start 
of rehabilitation) to discharge decreased from 1.1  to 0.4, with no recurrence 
of nephrotic syndrome. At the initial, middle, and final evaluations, 
respectively, the grip strength was 10.1, 8.9, and 8.3 kg; the knee extension 
strength was 0.38, 0.46, and 0.45 kgf/kg; the sit-up test results were 18, 18, 
and 15 times; the side-step test results were 34, 36, and 31 times; the 
sit-and-reach test results were 22.9, 24.5, and 23.8 cm; and the 6-min walk test 
results were 420, 490, and 520 m. Leg muscle strength and exercise tolerance 
improved, but upper limb strength, trunk muscle strength, and agility decreased.
DISCUSSION: Moderate-intensity exercises may be effective and safe for pediatric 
patients with nephrotic syndrome in the acute phase. Exercise therapy may be 
beneficial to improve physical function and prevent decline during 
hospitalization in pediatric nephrotic syndrome patients.

Aras Dam Lake is a strategic aquatic ecosystem in Iran and there are reports of 
toxic phytoplankton blooms in this reservoir. This study was performed to 
determine the effect of meteorological variables on the formation and expansion 
of toxic phytoplankton communities in Aras dam reservoir. The data of this 
project have been obtained using field studies and satellite data (MODIS and 
Sentinel-2). Sampling to determine the composition of phytoplankton communities 
in the area was carried out seasonally in two time periods from 2003 to 2014, 
and environmental assessments were also performed based on meteorological and 
satellite data over an 18-year period (2003-2020). The Chlorophyll-a content was 
obtained from MODIS and correlated with meteorological data. The statistical 
analysis showed that the highest coefficient of determination is related to the 
correlation of chlorophyll-a and Evaporation (R 2 = 0.86). Also, the relative 
root mean square error is equal to 18%, 18.1% and 21.2% for the chlorophyll-a 
-SST, chlorophyll-a -wind and chlorophyll-a -Evaporation relations, 
respectively. Moreover, in a supplementary study, correlation between the 
chlorophyll-a content with selected meteorological variables including 
evaporation, wind speed and water surface temperature were investigated 
seasonally. The results showed that the trend of changes in chlorophyll-a 
content with three considered variables are parabolic functions and 
chlorophyll-a -Evp (R 2 = 0.86, MAPE = 15.2%) model indicates better 
performance. The results also showed that the eutrophication rate of the 
reservoir during lockdown period increased in comparison with the same time at 
pre-pandemic period, which can be related to increase of incoming waste loads in 
this reservoir.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a progressive and 
multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder whose primary causes are mostly 
unknown. Due to the increase in life expectancy of world population, including 
developing countries, AD, whose incidence rises dramatically with age, is at the 
forefront among neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, a definitive cure is not 
yet within reach, imposing substantial medical and public health burdens at 
every latitude. Therefore, the effort to devise novel and effective therapeutic 
strategies is still of paramount importance. Genetic, functional, structural and 
biochemical studies all indicate that new and efficacious drug delivery 
strategies interfere at different levels with various cellular and molecular 
targets. Over the last few decades, therapeutic development of nanomedicine at 
preclinical stage has shown to progress at a fast pace, thus paving the way for 
its potential impact on human health in improving prevention, diagnosis, and 
treatment of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, including AD. Clinical 
translation of nano-based therapeutics, despite current limitations, may present 
important advantages and innovation to be exploited in the neuroscience field as 
well. In this state-of-the-art review article, we present the most promising 
applications of polymeric nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery for bypassing the 
blood-brain barrier of AD preclinical models and boost pharmacological safety 
and efficacy. In particular, novel strategic chemical functionalization of 
polymeric nanocarriers that could be successfully employed for treating AD are 
thoroughly described. Emphasis is also placed on nanotheranostics as both 
potential therapeutic and diagnostic tool for targeted treatments. Our review 
highlights the emerging role of nanomedicine in the management of AD, providing 
the readers with an overview of the nanostrategies currently available to 
develop future therapeutic applications against this chronic neurodegenerative 
disease.

Cancer is among the most common causes of death for dogs (and cats) and humans 
in the developed world, even though it is uncommon in wildlife and other 
domestic animals. We provide a rationale for this observation based on recent 
advances in our understanding of the evolutionary basis of cancer. Over the 
course of evolutionary time, species have acquired and fine-tuned adaptive 
cancer protective mechanisms that are intrinsically related to their energy 
demands, reproductive strategies, and expected lifespan. These cancer protective 
mechanisms are general across species and/or specific to each species and their 
niche, and they do not seem to be limited in diversity. The evolutionarily 
acquired cancer-free longevity that defines a species' life history can explain 
why the relative cancer risk, rate, and incidence are largely similar across 
most species in the animal kingdom despite differences in body size and life 
expectancy. The molecular, cellular, and metabolic events that promote malignant 
transformation and cancerous growth can overcome these adaptive, 
species-specific protective mechanisms in a small proportion of individuals, 
while independently, some individuals in the population might achieve 
exceptional longevity. In dogs and humans, recent dramatic alterations in 
healthcare and social structures have allowed increasing numbers of individuals 
in both species to far exceed their species-adapted longevities (by 2-4 times) 
without allowing the time necessary for compensatory natural selection. In other 
words, the cancer protective mechanisms that restrain risk at comparable levels 
to other species for their adapted lifespan are incapable of providing cancer 
protection over this recent, drastic and widespread increase in longevity.
