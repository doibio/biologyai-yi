BACKGROUND: While guidelines recommend anticoagulation for all atrial 
fibrillation (AF) patients ≥75 years, evidence for the net clinical benefit 
(NCB) of anticoagulant in older adults is sparse. We sought to determine the 
association between age and NCB of anticoagulation in older adults with AF.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined adults ≥75 years with incident AF in the 
Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation-Cardiovascular Research 
Network cohort. Using a Markov state transition model, we estimated the lifetime 
NCB of warfarin and apixaban relative to no treatment in quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs). In the decision model, each month patients face a chance of 
stroke, hemorrhage, or death from a competing cause; the likelihood of each is a 
function of individual patients' stroke risk, hemorrhage risk, and life 
expectancy. We defined minimal clinically relevant lifetime benefit as 0.10 
QALYs. In a sensitivity analysis, we examined the effect of competing risks of 
death on NCB using 2 models, one including competing risks and the second 
without competing risks. We included 14 946 patients, with a median age of 81 
years and median CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4. In the main analysis, after age 87, 
NCB associated with warfarin decreased below 0.10 lifetime QALYs while NCB 
associated with apixaban did not decrease below 0.10 lifetime QALYs until after 
age 92. In sensitivity analyses, over a 3-year horizon, removing competing risks 
of death resulted in higher NCB (at 90 years, median difference using warfarin 
0.010 QALYs [95% CI, 0.009-0.013], median difference using apixaban 0.025 QALYs 
[95% CI, 0.024-0.026]).
CONCLUSIONS: The NCB of anticoagulation decreases with advancing age. The 
competing risk of death diminishes the NCB of anticoagulation for older patients 
with AF. Physicians should consider competing mortality risks when recommending 
anticoagulants to older adults with AF.

Background. Network meta-analyses (NMAs) that compare treatments for a given 
condition allow physicians to identify which treatments have higher or lower 
probabilities of reducing the risks of disease complications or increasing the 
risks of treatment side effects. Translating these data into personalized 
treatment plans requires integration of NMA data with patient-specific 
pretreatment risk estimates and preferences regarding treatment objectives and 
acceptable risks. Methods. We introduce a modeling framework to integrate data 
probabilistically from NMAs with data on individualized patient risk estimates 
for disease outcomes, treatment preferences (such as willingness to incur 
greater side effects for increased life expectancy), and risk preferences. We 
illustrate the modeling framework by creating personalized plans for 
antipsychotic drug treatment and evaluating their effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness. Results. Compared with treating all patients with the drug 
that yields the greatest quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) on average 
(amisulpride), personalizing the selection of antipsychotic drugs for 
schizophrenia patients over the next 5 years would be expected to yield 0.33 
QALYs (95% credible interval [crI]: 0.30-0.37) per patient at an incremental 
cost of $4849/QALY gained (95% crI: dominant-$12,357), versus 0.29 and 0.04 
QALYs per patient when accounting for only risks or preferences, respectively, 
but not both. Limitations. The analysis uses a linear, additive utility function 
to reflect patient treatment preferences and does not consider potential 
variations in patient time discounting. Conclusions. Our modeling framework 
rigorously computes what physicians normally have to do mentally. By integrating 
3 key components of personalized medicine-evidence on efficacy, patient risks, 
and patient preferences-the modeling framework can provide personalized 
treatment decisions to improve patient health outcomes.

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation's Advice on Extending Human 
Papillomavirus Vaccination to Boys: Were Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Guidelines 
Bent to Achieve a Politically Acceptable Decision?

In July 2018, the UK Minister of Public Health announced that human 
papillomavirus vaccination would be extended to 12-year-old boys. This decision 
was informed by updated evidence from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and 
Immunisation (JCVI) published earlier that month. Vaccination of boys had been 
found not to be cost-effective in a series of analyses conducted for the JCVI, 
including the most recent assessment prior to the minister's announcement. These 
analyses were conducted under the standard methods for cost-effectiveness 
analysis recommended by the JCVI, which are primarily based on guidelines from 
the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence. Although the JCVI 
concluded they were unable to advise extending vaccination on the basis of 
standard appraisal methods, their most recent round of assessment 
also considered analyses using nonstandard appraisal methods. In particular, the 
JCVI noted that vaccination of boys was likely to be cost-effective when a lower 
discount rate of 1.5% is applied to costs and health effects, as opposed to the 
3.5% rate usually employed. The JCVI stated that they were supportive of 
applying such alternative methods, and on this basis, they would advise 
extending vaccination to boys. This commentary explains the JCVI's application 
of nonstandard appraisal methods and considers whether it was justified. We 
conclude that the JCVI was not justified in applying the lower discount rate. We 
voice concerns that a willingness to endorse a politically popular intervention 
may have driven the JCVI to depart from a fair and consistent application of 
healthcare rationing.

BACKGROUND: For patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, 
gene-drug associations exist relevant to first-line treatment 
options-antiplatelet agent, clopidogrel, and pain medication, tramadol. 
Knowledge of genotype information may allow for avoidance of adverse drug events 
during critical clinical windows.
OBJECTIVE: This evaluation estimated cost-effectiveness associated with a 
multi-gene panel pre-emptively testing two genes providing CYP2C19 
genotype-guided strategy for antiplatelet therapy, with CYP2D6 genotype-guided 
pain management, compared to single gene test for CYP2C19 with random assignment 
for pain treatment, and to no testing (empiric clopidogrel with random 
assignment for pain treatment).
METHODS: Decision analysis modeling was used to project costs from a payer 
perspective and patient quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from the three 
strategies. The model captured composite risks of major adverse cardiovascular 
events and pain therapy-related adverse drug events and associated utility 
estimates. We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess influential input 
parameters.
RESULTS: Over 15 months, multi-gene testing was least costly and yielded more 
QALYs compared to both single gene and no testing; total incremental costs were 
$1646 lower with incremental gains of 0.04 QALYs for multi-gene compared with 
single gene and $11 368 lower with 0.17 QALY gains compared to no test. Base 
case analyses revealed multi gene was dominant compared to both single gene and 
no test, as it demonstrated cost savings with increased QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: For these patients, a multi-gene-guided strategy yields a favorable 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared to the other two treatment 
strategies. Pre-emptively ascertaining additional gene-drug pair information can 
inform clinical and economic decision-making at the point of care.

BACKGROUND: Less than 25% of stroke patients arrive to an emergency department 
within the 3-hour treatment window.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a stroke preparedness 
behavioral intervention study (Stroke Warning Information and Faster Treatment 
[SWIFT]), a stroke intervention demonstrating capacity to decrease race-ethnic 
disparities in ED arrival times.
METHODS: Using the literature and SWIFT outcomes for 2 interventions, enhanced 
educational (EE) materials, and interactive intervention (II), we assess the 
cost-effectiveness of SWIFT in 2 ways: (1) Markov model, and (2) cost-to-outcome 
ratio. The Markov model primary outcome was the cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) gained using the cost-effectiveness threshold of $100 000/QALY. 
The primary cost-to-outcome endpoint was cost per additional patient with ED 
arrival <3 hours, stroke knowledge, and preparedness capacity. We assessed the 
ICER of II and EE versus standard care (SC) from a health sector and societal 
perspective using 2015 USD, a time horizon of 5 years, and a discount rate of 
3%.
RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of the II and EE programs was, respectively, 
$227.35 and $74.63 per additional arrival <3 hours, $440.72 and $334.09 per 
additional person with stroke knowledge proficiency, and $655.70 and $811.77 per 
additional person with preparedness capacity. Using a societal perspective, the 
ICER for EE versus SC was $84 643 per QALY gained and the ICER for II versus EE 
was $59 058 per QALY gained. Incorporating fixed costs, EE and II would need to 
administered to 507 and 1693 or more patients, respectively, to achieve an ICER 
of $100 000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: II was a cost-effective strategy compared with both EE and SC. 
Nevertheless, high initial fixed costs associated with II may limit its 
cost-effectiveness in settings with smaller patient populations.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Birth cohort screening for the hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) has been implemented in the US, but there is little evidence of its 
cost-effectiveness in England. We aim to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
one-time HCV screening for individuals born between 1950 and 1979 as part of the 
National Health Service health check in England, a health check for adults aged 
40 to 74 years in primary care.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to analyze add-on HCV testing to the 
National Health Service health check for individuals in birth cohorts between 
1950 and 1979, versus current background HCV testing only, over a lifetime 
horizon. The model used data from a back-calculation model of the burden of HCV 
in England, sentinel surveillance of HCV testing, and published literature. 
Results are presented from a health service perspective in pounds in 2017, as 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life years gained.
RESULTS: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from £7648 
to £24 434, and £18 681 to £46 024, across birth cohorts when considering 2 
sources of HCV transition probabilities. The intervention is most likely to be 
cost-effective for those born in the 1970s, and potentially cost-effective for 
those born from 1955 to 1969. The model results were most sensitive to the 
source of HCV transition probabilities, the probability of referral and 
receiving treatment, and the HCV prevalence among testers. The maximum value of 
future research across all birth cohorts was £11.3 million at £20 000 per 
quality-adjusted life years gained.
CONCLUSION: Birth cohort screening is likely to be cost-effective for younger 
birth cohorts, although considerable uncertainty exists for other birth cohorts. 
Further studies are warranted to reduce uncertainty in cost-effectiveness and 
consider the acceptability of the intervention.

BACKGROUND: Motor neurone disease (MND) places a significant burden on patients, 
their carers, and healthcare systems.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate health utilities and costs of MND within the UK setting.
METHODS: Patients with MND, recruited via 22 regional clinics, completed a 
postal questionnaire of a cost and quality-of-life survey. Health outcome 
assessment included the EuroQoL (EQ)-5D-5L, EQ-5D-visual analogue scale, 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Utility Index, and the Amyotrophic Lateral 
Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised. Clinical staging was based on the 
Kings and Milano-Torino (MiToS) systems. The questionnaire asked about patients' 
use of primary, secondary, and community care services in the previous 3 months. 
Variability in total costs was examined using regression models.
RESULTS: 595 patients were included in the health utility analysis, of whom 584 
patients also completed a resource use questionnaire. Mean health utility 
decreased and costs increased between consecutive Kings stages, from 0.76 (95% 
CI 0.71-0.80) and £1096 (£757-£1240) in Kings stage 1, to 0.50 (0.45-0.54) and 
£3311 (£2666-£4151) in stage 4, respectively. The changes by MiToS stages were 
from 0.71 (0.69-0.73) and £1115 (£937-£1130) in MiToS stage 0, to 0.25 
(0.07-0.42) and £2899 (£2190-£3840) in stage 2. Kings stages 3 and 4 and MiToS 
stages 1 and 2, respectively, were significant in explaining variability in 
total costs.
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of MND on health utilities and costs differs by disease 
severity. The data provided here can be used in cost-effectiveness analyses and 
to inform decision-making regarding healthcare provision for people with MND.

OBJECTIVE: Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in the use of 
multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to support health technology assessment 
(HTA) agencies for setting healthcare priorities. However, its implementation to 
date has been criticized for being "entirely mechanistic," ignoring opportunity 
costs, and not following best practice guidelines. This article provides 
guidance on the use of MCDA in this context.
METHODS: The present study was based on a systematic review and consensus 
development. We developed a typology of MCDA studies and good implementation 
practice. We reviewed 36 studies over the period 1990 to 2018 on their 
compliance with good practice and developed recommendations. We reached 
consensus among authors over the course of several review rounds.
RESULTS: We identified 3 MCDA study types: qualitative MCDA, quantitative MCDA, 
and MCDA with decision rules. The types perform differently in terms of quality, 
consistency, and transparency of recommendations on healthcare priorities. We 
advise HTA agencies to always include a deliberative component. Agencies should, 
at a minimum, undertake qualitative MCDA. The use of quantitative MCDA has 
additional benefits but also poses design challenges. MCDA with decision rules, 
used by HTA agencies in The Netherlands and the United Kingdom and typically 
referred to as structured deliberation, has the potential to further improve the 
formulation of recommendations but has not yet been subjected to broad 
experimentation and evaluation.
CONCLUSION: MCDA holds large potential to support HTA agencies in setting 
healthcare priorities, but its implementation needs to be improved.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found rotavirus vaccination to be highly 
cost-effective in low-income countries. However, updated evidence is now 
available for several inputs (ie, rotavirus disease mortality rates, rotavirus 
age distributions, vaccine timeliness, and vaccine efficacy by duration of 
follow-up), new rotavirus vaccines have entered the market, vaccine prices have 
decreased, and cost-effectiveness thresholds have been re-examined. We aimed to 
provide updated cost-effectiveness estimates to inform national decisions about 
the new introduction and current use of rotavirus vaccines in Gavi countries.
METHODS: We calculated the potential costs and effects of rotavirus vaccination 
for ten successive birth cohorts in 73 countries previously and currently 
eligible for Gavi support, compared with no vaccination. We used a deterministic 
cohort model to calculate numbers of rotavirus gastroenteritis cases, outpatient 
visits, hospitalisations, and deaths between birth and 5 years, with and without 
rotavirus vaccination. We calculated treatment costs from the government and 
societal perspectives. The primary outcome measure was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (discounted US$ per disability-adjusted life-year 
averted). Country-specific model input parameters were based on the scientific 
literature, published meta-analyses, and international databases. We ran 
deterministic and probabilistic uncertainty analyses.
FINDINGS: Over the period 2018-27, rotavirus vaccination has the potential to 
prevent nearly 600 000 deaths in Gavi countries. Averted outpatient visits and 
hospitalisations could lead to treatment savings of approximately $484·1 million 
from the government perspective and $878·0 million from the societal 
perspective. The discounted dollars per disability-adjusted life-year averted 
has a very high probability (>90%) of being less than 0·5 times the gross 
domestic product per capita in 54 countries, and less than 1·0 times gross 
domestic product per capita in 63 countries.
INTERPRETATION: Rotavirus vaccination continues to represent good value for 
money across most Gavi countries despite lower rotavirus mortality estimates and 
more stringent willingness-to-pay thresholds.

BACKGROUND: Many countries, including India, seek locally constructed disease 
burden estimates comprising mortality and loss of health to aid priority setting 
for the prevention and treatment of diseases. We created the National Burden 
Estimates (NBE) to provide transparent and understandable disease burdens at the 
national and subnational levels, and to identify gaps in knowledge.
METHODS: To calculate the NBE for India, we combined 2017 UN death totals with 
national and subnational mortality rates for 2010-17 and causes of death from 
211 166 verbal autopsy interviews in the Indian Million Death Study for 2010-14. 
We calculated years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) 
for 2017 using published YLD-YLL ratios from WHO Global Health Estimates. We 
grouped causes of death into 45 groups, including ill-defined deaths, and summed 
YLLs and YLDs to calculate disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for these 
causes in eight age groups covering rural and urban areas and 21 major states of 
India.
FINDINGS: In 2017, there were about 9·7 million deaths and 486 million DALYs in 
India. About three quarters of deaths and DALYs occurred in rural areas. More 
than a third of national DALYs arose from communicable, maternal, perinatal, and 
nutritional disorders. DALY rates in rural areas were at least twice those of 
urban areas for perinatal and nutritional conditions, chronic respiratory 
diseases, diarrhoea, and fever of unknown origin. DALY rates for ischaemic heart 
disease were greater in urban areas. Injuries caused 11·4% of DALYs nationally. 
The top 15 conditions that accounted for the most DALYs were mostly those 
causing mortality (ischaemic heart disease, perinatal conditions, chronic 
respiratory diseases, diarrhoea, respiratory infections, cancer, stroke, road 
traffic accidents, tuberculosis, and liver and alcohol-related conditions), with 
disability mostly due to a few conditions (nutritional deficiencies, 
neuropsychiatric conditions, vision and other sensory loss, musculoskeletal 
disorders, and genitourinary diseases). Every condition that was common in one 
part of India was uncommon elsewhere, suggesting state-specific priorities for 
disease control.
INTERPRETATION: The NBE method quantifies disease burden using transparent, 
intuitive, and reproducible methods. It provides a simple, locally operable tool 
to aid policy makers in priority setting in India and other low-income and 
middle-income countries. The NBE underlines the need for many more countries to 
collect nationally representative cause of death data, paired with focused 
surveys of disability.

The increasing number of patients with heart failure HF and comorbidities is due 
to aging population and increase of life expectancy of patients with 
cardiovascular disease. Encouraging results derived by recent trials may suggest 
some comorbidities as new targets for new drugs, highlighting the need for a 
better understanding of the comorbidities' effects in HF patients and the need 
of a multidisciplinary approach for the management of chronic HF with 
comorbidities. We report a brief review about main cardiovascular and 
non-cardiovascular comorbidities in HF patients in order to update physicians 
and researchers engaged in the HF research or in "fight against heart failure."

BACKGROUND: For women with lymph node (ln)-positive, estrogen receptor-positive, 
and her2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)-negative breast cancer 
(bca), current guidelines recommend treatment with both hormonal therapy and 
chemotherapy. The 21-gene Recurrence Score (rs) assay might be helpful in 
selecting patients with bca who can be spared chemotherapy when they have 1-3 
positive lns and a lower risk of recurrence. In the present study, we performed 
a cost-utility analysis comparing use of the 21-gene rs assay with current 
practice from the perspective of a Canadian health care payer.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to determine costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (qalys) over a patient's lifetime. Patient outcomes in both study 
groups were examined based on published clinical trials. Costs were derived 
primarily from published Canadian sources. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 
1.5% annually, and costs are reported in 2016 Canadian dollars. A probabilistic 
analysis was used, and the model parameters were varied in a sensitivity 
analysis.
RESULTS: The results indicate that use of the 21-gene rs assay was less costly 
($432 less) and more effective (0.22 qalys) than current practice. The 
probabilistic analysis revealed that 70% of the 10,000 simulated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were in the southeast quadrant. The results were 
sensitive to the probability of a low rs and to the probability of receiving 
chemotherapy in the low-risk rs category and in current practice.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of the 21-gene rs assay could be a cost-effective strategy for 
Ontario patients with estrogen receptor-positive, her2-negative early bca and 
1-3 positive lns.

Cell surface receptors perceive signals from the environment and transfer them 
to the interior of the cell. The Arabidopsis thaliana PR5 receptor-like kinase 
(AtPR5K) subfamily consists of three members with extracellular domains that 
share sequence similarity with the PR5 proteins. In this study, we characterized 
the role of AtPR5K2 in plant drought-stress signaling. AtPR5K2 is predominantly 
expressed in leaves and localized to the plasma membrane. The atpr5k2-1 mutant 
showed tolerance to dehydration stress, while AtPR5K2-overexpressing plants was 
hypersensitive to drought. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays 
showed that AtPR5K2 physically interacted with the type 2C protein phosphatases 
ABA-insensitive 1 (ABI1) and ABI2 and the SNF1-related protein kinase 2 
(SnRK2.6) proteins, all of which are involved in the initiation of abscisic acid 
(ABA) signaling; however, these interactions were inhibited by treatments of 
exogenous ABA. Moreover, AtPR5K2 was found to phosphorylate ABI1 and ABI2, but 
not SnRK2.6. Taken together, these results suggest that AtPR5K2 participates in 
ABA-dependent drought-stress signaling through the phosphorylation of ABI1 and 
ABI2.

The relationships between perceived life expectancy (PLE), cancer screening 
intentions and behaviour are not well understood, despite the importance of 
remaining life expectancy for the early diagnosis benefits of screening. This 
study investigates the relationships between PLE and each of: the intention to 
complete faecal occult blood test (FOBt) screening, 'ever' uptake of FOBt 
screening, and repeat uptake of FOBt screening for colorectal cancer. Data were 
from the population-representative Attitudes, Behaviour and Cancer UK Survey II 
(ABACUS II) in England in 2015. Eligible respondents for the present analysis 
were aged 60-70 years (FOBt eligible age range), who completed the survey 
question on perceived life expectancy (N = 824). We used logistic regression 
models to estimate the associations between PLE and the intention to complete 
screening, 'ever' uptake of screening, and repeat uptake of screening, with 
adjustment for age, gender, occupation-based social grade, marital status, 
ethnicity, and smoking status. PLE was positively associated with repeated 
uptake of FOBt (adjusted OR = 2.55; 95% CI: 1.04-6.30 for expecting to live to 
≥90 years versus <80 years). Older adults may base decisions to continually 
participate in cancer screening on their expectations of remaining life 
expectancy. Future research should investigate the feasibility and acceptability 
of individualised cancer screening recommendations that take life expectancy 
into account.

The noninvasive prenatal test (NIPT) as the first trimester prenatal screening 
(FTS) for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 is offered to all pregnant women in the 
Netherlands. NIPT using genome sequencing allows for an expansion of the scope 
of FTS and the introduction of NIPT gives rise to ethical and societal concerns 
about deliberated decision-making, pressure to engage in screening, and possible 
lack of equal access due to the financial contribution (€175) to NIPT. We 
explored the opinions and experiences of pregnant women, who were offered FTS, 
about these concerns, and the possibility of a broadened scope. Nineteen 
pregnant women representing a diversity of backgrounds were interviewed using a 
semi-structured interview guide. Eight women did not opt for prenatal screening 
while 11 did (NIPT = 4, combined test = 7). Women experienced a free choice to 
accept or decline prenatal screening, despite sometimes receiving advice from 
others. Prior to pretest counseling, some women had already deliberated about 
what an abnormal test result would mean to them. Others accepted or declined FTS 
without deliberation. The current Dutch policy of requiring a co-payment was 
acceptable to some, who believed that it functioned as a threshold to think 
carefully about FTS. Others were concerned that a financial threshold would lead 
to unequal access to screening. Finally, pregnant women found it difficult to 
formulate opinions on the scope of FTS, because of lack of knowledge. Life 
expectancy, severity, and treatability were considered important criteria for 
the inclusion of a condition in NIPT.

IMPORTANCE: Basket-design clinical trials that allow investigation of treatment 
effects on different clinical syndromes that share the same molecular 
pathophysiology have not previously been attempted in neurodegenerative disease.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of the 
microtubule stabilizer TPI-287 (abeotaxane) in Alzheimer disease (AD) or the 
4-repeat tauopathies (4RT) progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal 
syndrome (CBS).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two parallel-design, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled phase 1 randomized clinical trials in AD and 4RT were 
conducted from December 20, 2013, through May 4, 2017, at the University of 
California, San Francisco, and University of Alabama at Birmingham. A total of 
94 patients with clinically diagnosed AD (n = 39) and 4RT (n = 55) were 
screened; of these, 3 refused to participate, and 10 with AD and 11 with 4RT did 
not meet inclusion criteria. A total of 29 patients with AD, 14 with PSP, and 30 
with β-amyloid-negative CBS (determined on positron emission tomography 
findings) were enrolled. Data were analyzed from December 20, 2013, through May 
4, 2017, based on modified intention to treat.
INTERVENTIONS: Randomization was 8:3 drug to placebo in 3 sequential dose 
cohorts receiving 2.0, 6.3, or 20.0 mg/m2 of intravenous TPI-287 once every 3 
weeks for 9 weeks, with an optional 6-week open-label extension.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end points were safety and tolerability 
(maximal tolerated dose) of TPI-287. Secondary and exploratory end points 
included TPI-287 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and changes on biomarker, 
clinical, and neuropsychology measures.
RESULTS: A total of 68 participants (38 men [56%]; median age, 65 [range, 50-85] 
years) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, of whom 26 had 
AD (14 women [54%]; median age, 63 [range, 50-76] years), and 42 had 4RT (16 
women [38%]; median age, 69 [range, 54-83] years). Three severe anaphylactoid 
reactions occurred in TPI-287-treated patients with AD, whereas none were seen 
in patients with 4RT, leading to a maximal tolerated dose of 6.3 mg/m2 for AD 
and 20.0 mg/m2 for 4RT. More falls (3 in the placebo group vs 11 in the TPI-287 
group) and a dose-related worsening of dementia symptoms (mean [SD] in the CDR 
plus NACC FTLD-SB [Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes with 
frontotemporal dementia measures], 0.5 [1.8] in the placebo group vs 0.7 [1.6] 
in the TPI-287 group; median difference, 1.5 [95% CI, 0-2.5]; P = .03) were seen 
in patients with 4RT. Despite undetectable TPI-287 levels in CSF, CSF biomarkers 
demonstrated decreased chitinase-3-like protein-1 (YKL-40) levels in the 4RT 
treatment arm (mean [SD], -8.4 [26.0] ng/mL) compared with placebo (mean [SD], 
10.4 [42.3] ng/mL; median difference, -14.6 [95% CI, -30.0 to 0.2] ng/mL; 
P = .048, Mann-Whitney test).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, TPI-287 was less 
tolerated in patients with AD than in those with 4RT owing to the presence of 
anaphylactoid reactions. The ability to reveal different tau therapeutic effects 
in various tauopathy syndromes suggests that basket trials are a valuable 
approach to tau therapeutic early clinical development.
