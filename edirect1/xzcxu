inequities as a Superwoman can activate inflammatory markers resulting in a 
weakened immune system, increased cardiovascular risk factors, and a shortened 
life expectancy. This article explores the Superwomen experience and its impact 
on health outcomes, with a focus on minimizing cardiovascular morbidity and 
mortality.

BACKGROUND: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is a common chronic ailment that 
causes uncomfortable symptoms and increases the risk of oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma. We aimed to report the burden of gastro-oesophageal reflux 
disease in 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2017, using data from 
the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017.
METHODS: We did a systematic review to identify measurements of the prevalence 
of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in geographically defined populations 
worldwide between 1990 and 2017. These estimates were analysed with DisMod-MR, a 
Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression tool that incorporates predictive 
covariates and adjustments for differences in study design in a geographical 
cascade of models. Fitted values for broader geographical units inform prior 
distributions for finer geographical units. Prevalence was estimated for 195 
countries and territories. Reports of the frequency and severity of symptoms 
among individuals with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were used to estimate 
the prevalence of cases with no, mild to moderate, or severe to very severe 
symptoms at a given time; these estimates were multiplied by disability weights 
to estimate years lived with disability (YLD).
FINDINGS: Data to estimate gastro-oesophageal reflux disease burden were scant, 
totalling 144 location-years (unique measurements from a year and location, 
regardless of whether a study reported them alongside measurements for other 
locations or years) of prevalence data. These came from six (86%) of seven GBD 
super-regions, 11 (52%) of 21 GBD regions, and 39 (20%) of 195 countries and 
territories. Mean estimates of age-standardised prevalence for all locations in 
2017 ranged from 4408 cases per 100 000 population to 14 035 cases per 100 000 
population. Age-standardised prevalence was highest (>11 000 cases per 100 000 
population) in the USA, Italy, Greece, New Zealand, and several countries in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, north Africa and the Middle East, and eastern 
Europe; it was lowest (<7000 cases per 100 000 population) in the high-income 
Asia Pacific, east Asia, Iceland, France, Denmark, and Switzerland. Global 
prevalence peaked at ages 75-79 years, at 18 820 (95% uncertainty interval [95% 
UI] 13 770-24 000) cases per 100 000 population. Global age-standardised 
prevalence was stable between 1990 and 2017 (8791 [95% UI 7772-9834] cases per 
100 000 population in 1990 and 8819 [7781-9863] cases per 100 000 population in 
2017, percentage change 0·3% [-0·3 to 0·9]), but all-age prevalence increased by 
18·1% (15·6-20·4) between 1990 and 2017, from 7859 (6905-8851) cases per 
100  000 population in 1990 to 9283 (8189-10 400) cases per 100  000 population 
in 2017. YLDs increased by 67·1% (95% UI 63·5-70·3) between 1990 and 2017, from 
3·60 million (1·93-6·12) in 1990 to 6·01 million (3·22-10·19) in 2017.
INTERPRETATION: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is common worldwide, although 
less so in much of eastern Asia. The stability of our global age-standardised 
prevalence estimates over time suggests that the epidemiology of the disease has 
not changed, but the estimates of all-age prevalence and YLDs, which increased 
between 1990 and 2017, suggest that the burden of gastro-oesophageal reflux 
disease is nonetheless increasing as a result of ageing and population growth.

INTRODUCTION: The appearance of a symptomatic neuroma following finger 
amputation is a devastating consequence for patient's quality of life. It could 
be cause of chronic neuropathic pain. The prevention of neuroma formation is a 
challenging effort for hand surgeons. The biological mechanisms leading to 
neuroma formation are mostly unknown and different preventing procedures have 
been tried without certain results. In this paper, a panel of Italian hand 
surgeons have been asked to express appropriateness about potentially preventive 
techniques of neuroma formation following the RAND/UCLA appropriateness 
protocol.
METHODS: A literature review was preliminarily performed identifying the most 
employed methods to reduce the pathologic nerve scar. Afterwards, the selected 
panelists were asked to score the appropriateness of each procedure in a double 
scenario: in case of a sharp amputation or in a tear injury. The appropriateness 
was evaluated according to RAND/UCLA protocol.
RESULTS: Nine Italian hand surgeons were included in the panel. Of them 5 were 
orthopaedic surgeons, 4 plastic surgeons. The identified appropriate procedures 
were: revision amputation should be done in operating room, the neurovascular 
bundles should be identified and is mandatory to treat surrounding soft tissues. 
Only in case of clean-cut amputation, it is appropriate to perform a proximal 
extension of the dissection, to use diathermocoagulation and coverage with local 
flaps. Procedures such as shortening in tension of the nerve stump, bone 
shortening, implantation of the nerve end in the soft tissue, treatment in the 
emergency room and, in both scenarios, certain results are evaluated as 
uncertain.
DISCUSSION: In order to prevent the formation of a distal stump neuroma few 
methods were judged appropriate. It is mandatory to identify the neurovascular 
bundles and treat also the surrounding tissues, but no certain results could be 
obtained with local flap, bone shortening and other ancillary surgical acts. 
Moreover, it is not possible to guarantee the non arising of neuroma in any 
cases, also when every procedure has been temped.
CONLUSIONS: The prevention of distal neuroma is actually a challenge, without a 
well known strategy due to the variability of response of nervous tissue to 
injury.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a critical role in lipid metabolism and may 
protect from hyperlipidemia; however, its beneficial effect appears to depend on 
the ambient temperature of the environment. In this study, we investigated the 
effects of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) deficiency on lipid metabolism, including 
the pathophysiology of hyperlipidemia, in apolipoprotein E knockout (APOE-KO) 
mice at a normal (23 °C) and thermoneutral (30 °C) temperature. Unexpectedly, 
UCP1 deficiency caused improvements in hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and 
glucose metabolism, regardless of an increase in hepatic lipid deposition, in 
Ucp1/Apoe double-knockout (DKO) mice fed a high-fat diet at 23 °C, with BAT 
hyperplasia and robust browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (IWAT) 
observed. Proteomics and gene expression analyses revealed significant increases 
in many proteins involved in energy metabolism and strong upregulation of 
brown/beige adipocyte-related genes and fatty acid metabolism-related genes in 
browned IWAT, suggesting an induction of beige fat formation and stimulation of 
lipid metabolism in DKO mice at 23 °C. Conversely, mRNA levels of fatty acid 
oxidation-related genes decreased in the liver of DKO mice. The favorable 
phenotypic changes were lost at 30 °C, with BAT whitening and disappearance of 
IWAT browning, while fatty liver further deteriorated in DKO mice compared with 
that in APOE-KO mice. Finally, longevity analysis revealed a significant 
lifespan extension of DKO mice compared with that of APOE-KO mice at 23 °C. 
Irrespective of the fundamental role of UCP1 thermogenesis, our results 
highlight the importance of beige fat for the improvement of hyperlipidemia and 
longevity under the atherogenic status at normal room temperature.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of lower limb strength training in 
addition to neuromuscular exercise and education (ST + NEMEX-EDU) compared to 
neuromuscular exercise and education alone (NEMEX-EDU) on self-reported physical 
function in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA).
DESIGN: Patient-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT).
METHODS: The trial included 90 patients in secondary care with radiographic and 
symptomatic KOA, ineligible for knee replacement. Both groups exercised twice 
weekly for 12 weeks. Additional strength training consisted of a single, 
fatiguing knee extension set (30-60RM) before four sets of leg-press (8-12RM). 
Primary outcome was the between-group difference on the subscale activities of 
daily living from the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOSADL) at 
12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included KOOS symptoms, pain, function in sport and 
recreation, and quality of life, 40 m walk, stair climb, leg extension power, 
EuroQol-5D-5L, pain medication usage, and adverse events.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant between-group difference in 
KOOSADL at 12-weeks; adjusted mean difference -1.15 (-6.78 to 4.48). Except for 
the stair climb test, which demonstrated an adjusted mean difference of 1.15 
(0.09-2.21) in favor of ST + NEMEX-EDU, all other outcomes showed no 
statistically significant between-group differences. Neither group improved leg 
extension power.
CONCLUSION: The addition of lower-limb strength training, using a low-dose 
approach, to neuromuscular exercise and education carried no additional benefits 
on self-reported physical function or on most secondary outcomes. Both groups 
displayed similar improvements at 12-week follow-up. Hence, the current low-dose 
strength training approach provided no additional clinical value in this group 
of KOA patients. Trial identifier (ClinicalTrials.gov): NCT03215602.

Has working-age morbidity been declining? Changes over time in survey measures 
of general health, chronic diseases, symptoms and biomarkers in England 
1994-2014.

OBJECTIVES: As life expectancy has increased in high-income countries, there has 
been a global debate about whether additional years of life are free from 
ill-health/disability. However, little attention has been given to changes over 
time in morbidity in the working-age population, particularly outside the USA, 
despite its importance for health monitoring and social policy. This study 
therefore asks: what are the changes over time in working-age morbidity in 
England over two decades?
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We use a high-quality annual cross-sectional 
survey, the Health Survey for England (HSE) 1994-2014. HSE uses a random sample 
of the English household population, with a combined sample size of over 140 000 
people. We produce a newly harmonised version of HSE that maximises 
comparability over time, including new non-response weights. While HSE is used 
for monitoring population health, it has hitherto not used for investigating 
morbidity as a whole.
OUTCOME MEASURES: We analyse all 39 measures that are fully comparable over 
time-including chronic disease diagnoses, symptomatology and a number of 
biomarkers-adjusting for gender and age.
RESULTS: We find a mixed picture: we see improving cardiovascular and 
respiratory health, but deteriorations in obesity, diabetes, some biomarkers and 
feelings of extreme anxiety/depression, alongside stability in moderate mental 
ill-health and musculoskeletal-related health. In several domains we also see 
stable or rising chronic disease diagnoses even where symptomatology has 
declined. While data limitations make it challenging to combine these measures 
into a single morbidity index, there is little systematic trend for declining 
morbidity to be seen in the measures that predict self-reported health most 
strongly.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite considerable falls in working-age mortality-and the 
assumptions of many policy-makers that morbidity will follow mortality - there 
is no systematic improvement in overall working-age morbidity in England from 
1994 to 2014.

US life expectancy stalls due to cardiovascular disease, not drug deaths.

After decades of robust growth, the rise in US life expectancy stalled after 
2010. Explanations for the stall have focused on rising drug-related deaths. 
Here we show that a stagnating decline in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality 
was the main culprit, outpacing and overshadowing the effects of all other 
causes of death. The CVD stagnation held back the increase of US life expectancy 
at age 25 y by 1.14 y in women and men, between 2010 and 2017. Rising 
drug-related deaths had a much smaller effect: 0.1 y in women and 0.4 y in men. 
Comparisons with other high-income countries reveal that the US CVD stagnation 
is unusually strong, contributing to a stark mortality divergence between the US 
and peer nations. Without the aid of CVD mortality declines, future US life 
expectancy gains must come from other causes-a monumental task given the 
enormity of earlier declines in CVD death rates. Reversal of the drug overdose 
epidemic will be beneficial, but insufficient for achieving pre-2010 pace of 
life expectancy growth.

The intake of macronutrients is crucial for the fitness of any animal and is 
mainly regulated by peripheral signals to the brain. How the brain receives and 
translates these peripheral signals or how these interactions lead to changes in 
feeding behavior is not well-understood. We discovered that 2 crustacean 
cardioactive peptide (CCAP)-expressing neurons in Drosophila adults regulate 
feeding behavior and metabolism. Notably, loss of CCAP, or knocking down the 
CCAP receptor (CCAP-R) in 2 dorsal median neurons, inhibits the release of 
neuropeptide F (NPF), which regulates feeding behavior. Furthermore, under 
starvation conditions, flies normally have an increased sensitivity to sugar; 
however, loss of CCAP, or CCAP-R in 2 dorsal median NPF neurons, inhibited sugar 
sensitivity in satiated and starved flies. Separate from its regulation of NPF 
signaling, the CCAP peptide also regulates triglyceride levels. Additionally, 
genetic and optogenetic studies demonstrate that CCAP signaling is necessary and 
sufficient to stimulate a reflexive feeding behavior, the proboscis extension 
reflex (PER), elicited when external food cues are interpreted as palatable. 
Dopaminergic signaling was also sufficient to induce a PER. On the other hand, 
although necessary, NPF neurons were not able to induce a PER. These data 
illustrate that the CCAP peptide is a central regulator of feeding behavior and 
metabolism in adult flies, and that NPF neurons have an important regulatory 
role within this system.

BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are widely used to elicit health 
state preferences. However, additional information is required to transform 
values to a scale with dead valued at 0 and full health valued at 1. This paper 
presents DCE-VAS, an understandable and easy anchoring method with low 
participant burden based on the visual analogue scale (VAS).
METHODS: Responses from 1450 members of the UK general public to a discrete 
choice experiment (DCE) were analysed using mixed logit models. Latent scale 
valuations were anchored to a full health = 1, dead = 0 scale using 
participants' VAS ratings of three states including the dead. The robustness of 
results was examined. This included a filtering procedure with the influence 
each individual respondent had on valuation being calculated, and those whose 
influence was more than two standard deviations away from the mean excluded.
RESULTS: Coefficients in all models were in the expected direction and 
statistically significant. Excluding respondents who self-reported not 
understanding the VAS task did not significantly influence valuation, but 
excluding a small number who valued 33333 extremely low did. However, after 
eight respondents were removed via the filtering procedure, valuations were 
robust to removing other participants.
CONCLUSION: DCE-VAS is a feasible way of anchoring DCE results to a 0-1 anchored 
scale with low additional respondent burden.

INTRODUCTION: The EQ-5D-3L (3L) and EQ-5D-5L (5L) are both frequently used 
measures of health status. Previous studies have found the EQ-5D-5L to have 
superior measurement properties but no study has compared the two measures in a 
large general population survey using matched respondents.
METHODS: Using data from the GP Patient Survey, coarsened exact matching was 
used to match individuals completing the 3L in 2011 with those completing the 5L 
in 2012. Measurement properties were assessed for a general population and 
multimorbid population (chronic conditions ≥ 2), with ceiling effects, 
informativity and distribution of response compared. Changes in the direction of 
response, as well as the impact on utility distributions, were quantified.
RESULTS: Matching resulted in a cohort of 1,023,218 respondents (2011: 511,609; 
2012: 511,609) for analysis. Ceiling effects for the 5L were lower than the 3L 
(43.8% vs. 54.4%). The 5L had improved informativity and broader spread of 
responses than the 3L (5L top 50 profiles: 77.4% vs. 3L: 98.8%). Overall, there 
was an upwards shift in utility values for the 5L versus the 3L as respondents 
using the 5L reported ill health more frequently but with less severity. 
Measurement improvements and effects on utility values were more pronounced for 
the multimorbid population.
CONCLUSION: The 5L had superior measurement properties than the 3L and should be 
preferred in general population surveys and for use in individuals with 
multimorbidity. At increasing levels of morbidity, the 5L is currently 
associated with higher utility values than the 3L.

One of the major factors limiting biomass productivity in algae is the low 
thermodynamic efficiency of photosynthesis. The greatest thermodynamic 
inefficiencies in photosynthesis occur during the conversion of light into 
chemical energy. At full sunlight the light-harvesting antenna captures photons 
at a rate nearly 10 times faster than the rate-limiting step in photosynthetic 
electron transport. Excess captured energy is dissipated by non-productive 
pathways including the production of reactive oxygen species. Substantial 
improvements in photosynthetic efficiency have been achieved by reducing the 
optical cross-section of the light-harvesting antenna by selectively reducing 
chlorophyll b levels and peripheral light-harvesting complex subunits. Smaller 
light-harvesting antenna, however, may not exhibit optimal photosynthetic 
performance in low or fluctuating light environments. We describe a 
translational control system to dynamically adjust light-harvesting antenna 
sizes for enhanced photosynthetic performance. By expressing a chlorophyllide a 
oxygenase (CAO) gene having a 5' mRNA extension encoding a Nab1 translational 
repressor binding site in a CAO knockout line it was possible to 
continuously alter chlorophyll b levels and correspondingly light-harvesting 
antenna sizes by light-activated Nab1 repression of CAO expression as a function 
of growth light intensity. Significantly, algae having light-regulated antenna 
sizes had substantially higher photosynthetic rates and two-fold greater biomass 
productivity than the parental wild-type strains as well as near wild-type 
ability to carry out state transitions and non-photochemical quenching. These 
results have broad implications for enhanced algae and plant biomass 
productivity.

Earthquake.

An earthquake hit the city of L'Aquila in central Italy in 2009, leaving the 
city completely destroyed and 309 casualties. Unexpectedly, lower rates of 
psychotic experiences in persons affected by the earthquake compared to 
non-affected persons were found 10 months after the earthquake. The very 
long-term impact of a natural disaster on the prevalence of psychotic 
experiences deserves more in-depth detailing. The Authors examined resilience 
and psychotic experiences in a university student sample of 494. No effect of 
direct exposure to the earthquake (odds ratio = 0.64, 95%CI [0.37, 1.11]), 
material damages (odds ratio = 0.86, 95%CI [0.60, 1.23]), psychological 
suffering (odds ratio = 1.06, 95% CI [0.83, 1.36]), or global impact severity 
(odds ratio = 0.92, 95%CI [0.76, 1.12]) on psychotic experiences was detected. 
Resilience levels did not differ between affected and non-affected persons. 
Resilience showed a strong protective effect on psychotic experiences (odds 
ratio=0.38, 95% CI [0.28, 0.51]. The protective effect of the RSA factor 
"Perception of Self" was significantly stronger in individuals affected by the 
earthquake compared to non-affected subjects. Being affected by an earthquake is 
not a risk factor for psychotic experiences in a university student sample, as 
no direct effect of the earthquake was detected after 10 years after the event. 
Resilience is confirmed as a strong protective factor for psychotic experiences 
irrespectively of large collective traumatic events. Extension of these results 
to a general population sample could provide interesting insights into recovery 
from natural disasters.

Hepato-pancreatico-biliary (HPB) surgery includes major hepatic resection and 
pancreatic surgery, both procedures are complex and have a potentially high 
complication rate. The presence of centers of excellence with a high patients 
volume has lowered the complication and increased the resection rate. Increased 
life expectancy and improved general health status have increased the number of 
elderly patients eligible for major surgery. Since old patients have more 
co-morbidities and decreased life expectancy, the benefit of these procedures 
need to be critically evaluated in this group. Analysis of the literature 
related to this argument demonstrated that pancreatoduodenectomy can be 
performed safely in selected elderly patients (70 years of age or older), with 
morbidity and mortality rates comparable those observed in younger patients. 
This aspect was also confirmed by cost analysis studies that reported similar 
data in both groups. Similar findings are also reported for major hepatic 
resection in elderly patients with either hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 
Klatskin tumor or gallbladder carcinoma. More studies are needed regarding the 
subgroup of very elderly patients (80 years or older). Nevertheless, those 
elderly patients who will benefit from surgery must be adequatelly selected.

This paper examines how older individuals living in 9 European countries 
evaluate their chances of survival. We use survey data for the years 2004 and 
2015 to construct population-level gender-specific subjective length of life (or 
subjective life expectancy) in people between 60 and 90 years of age. Using a 
specially designed statistical approach based on survival analysis, we compare 
people's estimated subjective life expectancies with those actually observed. We 
find subjective life expectancies to be lower than actual life expectancies for 
both genders in 2004. In 2015 men become more realistic in the sense that their 
subjective life expectancy is close to what was actually observed, while women 
retain their subjective expectations of a shorter than actual life expectancy. 
These results help to better understand how people might construct diverse 
decisions related to their remaining life course.

Evidence suggests that older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) might 
not receive evidence-based treatments. We explored the impact of patient MCI on 
physician decision-making and recommendations for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) 
and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a pilot concurrent mixed-methods study 
of physicians recruited from one academic center. The mailed survey included a 
clinical vignette of AIS or AMI where the patient cognitive status was 
randomized (normal cognition, MCI, or early-stage dementia). The primary outcome 
was a composite summary measure of the proportion of guideline-concordant 
treatments recommended. Linear regression compared the primary outcome across 
patient cognition groups adjusting for physician characteristics. 
Semi-structured interviews done with 18 physicians (4 cardiologists, 9 
neurologists, 5 internists) using a standard guide. Survey response rate was 72% 
(82/114) (49/61 neurologists; 33/53 cardiologists). As patient cognition 
worsened, neurologists recommended less guideline-concordant treatments after 
AIS (Ptrend<0.001 across patient cognition groups). Cardiologists did not after 
AMI (Ptrend = 0.11) in adjusted analyses. Neurologists' recommendation of 
guideline-concordant treatments after AIS was non-significantly lower in 
patients with MCI (composite measure, 0.13 points lower; P = 0.14) and 
significantly lower in patients with early-stage dementia (0.33 points lower; 
P<0.001) compared to cognitively normal patients. Interviews identified themes 
that may explain these findings including physicians assumed patients with MCI, 
compared with cognitively normal patients, have limited life expectancy, frailty 
and poor functioning, prefer less treatment, might adhere less to treatment, and 
have greater risks or burdens from treatment. These results suggest that patient 
MCI influences physician decision-making and recommendations for AIS and AMI 
treatments.

Later-Life Exposure to Moderate PM(2.5) Air Pollution and Life Loss of Older 
Adults in Taiwan.

Hwang JS(1), Hu TH(1).

Author information:
(1)Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have directly estimated expected life loss attributable 
to lifetime exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5).
METHODS: We used claims data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance to create 
63 study cohorts of 1.91 million residents aged 60-79 years old residing in 
small areas where air quality monitoring stations are situated. The survival 
status of each person was followed from 2001 to 2016. We applied an 
extrapolation algorithm to estimate the lifetime survival function so that we 
could directly estimate life expectancy (LE) and the lifetime exposure to PM2.5 
of each cohort. We estimated the association between LE and lifetime exposure to 
PM2.5 among the 63 cohorts. We also fit a Cox proportional hazards model to all 
the data combined to estimate the relative risk of mortality.
RESULTS: Older adults who lived in an area with a higher lifetime weighted 
average PM2.5 of 10 μ g / m 3 had a shortened LE by 0.34 (95% CI: 0.22-0.46) 
years. The hazard ratio of mortality was 1.0245 (1.0242-1.0248) per one μ g / m 
3 increase in lifetime average PM2.5.
CONCLUSION: This study provides strong evidence that later-life exposure to 
moderate PM2.5 air pollution had a substantial impact on the life loss of older 
adults.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy acts as a population measure of the performance of 
healthcare systems. Regional disparities on life expectancy in Indonesia has 
been persisted and become a public health policy challenge. A systematic 
clustering of provinces can be a valuable alternative for organizing cooperation 
that aimed to increase life expectancy and reduce disparities. This study aimed 
to identify determinants of life expectancy and designate clusters of Indonesian 
provinces with similar characteristics. This approach can be useful in 
generating alternative cooperation strategies to improve life expectancy.
METHODS: We carefully selected variables that have been shown to impact life 
expectancy and gathered 2015 data from Indonesia's Ministry of Health. All 34 
Indonesian provinces were included as analysis units. We performed structural 
equation modeling (SEM) to select domains that needed to work on from 
theoretical models. Based on SEM results, we performed cluster analysis to 
arrange cooperation groups.
RESULTS: Life expectancy showed correlations with mean years of schooling, 
expenditure per capita, health workforce, healthcare facilities, and 
environment. Expenditure per capita also was the strongest of all constructs. 
Based on SEM results, we performed cluster analysis to arrange cooperation 
groups of total 34 provinces and generated five clusters of provinces.
CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing the economy is the most effective approach for improving 
life expectancy and other constructs. These clusters can build cooperation that 
is new, within, and across clusters. These results may be useful in formulating 
cooperation strategies aimed at increasing life expectancy.

Semaphorin-3A Promotes Degradation of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein in 
Growth Cones via the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway.

Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that 
regulates local translation in dendrites and spines for synaptic plasticity. In 
axons, FMRP is implicated in axonal extension and axon guidance. We previously 
demonstrated the involvement of FMRP in growth cone collapse via a 
translation-dependent response to Semaphorin-3A (Sema3A), a repulsive axon 
guidance factor. In the case of attractive axon guidance factors, RNA-binding 
proteins such as zipcode binding protein 1 (ZBP1) accumulate towards the 
stimulated side of growth cones for local translation. However, it remains 
unclear how Sema3A effects FMRP localization in growth cones. Here, we show that 
levels of FMRP in growth cones of hippocampal neurons decreased after Sema3A 
stimulation. This decrease in FMRP was suppressed by the ubiquitin-activating 
enzyme E1 enzyme inhibitor PYR-41 and proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting 
that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in Sema3A-induced FMRP 
degradation in growth cones. Moreover, the E1 enzyme or proteasome inhibitor 
suppressed Sema3A-induced increases in microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) 
in growth cones, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway promotes local 
translation of MAP1B, whose translation is mediated by FMRP. These inhibitors 
also blocked the Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse. Collectively, our results 
suggest that Sema3A promotes degradation of FMRP in growth cones through the 
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, leading to growth cone collapse via local 
translation of MAP1B. These findings reveal a new mechanism of axon guidance 
regulation: degradation of the translational suppressor FMRP via the 
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease in humans. With its related 
fragility fracture, it represents a major public health problem in our region, 
with a significant medical and socio-economic burden. The high prevalence rate 
of vitamin D deficiency, the increase in life expectancy, the low socioeconomic 
level and the significant restriction to access to health care in some countries 
represent the major causes for the increasing prevalence of osteoporosis and 
incidence of fragility fractures in the Arabic countries. Bone mineral density 
(BMD) assessment is the gold standard to diagnose osteoporosis. However, a 
clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis may be made in the presence of a fragility 
fracture, without BMD measurement. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the 
preferred method for screening bone mineral density. For screening site of 
measurement, DXA of hip and spine is suggested. BMD assessment is recommended in 
all women 65 years of age and older and men 70 and older regardless of risk 
factors. Younger subjects with clinical risk factors and persons with clinical 
evidence of osteoporosis or diseases leading to osteoporosis should also be 
screened. These guidelines are aimed to provide to health care professionals in 
the region of an updated process for the diagnosis and treatment of 
osteoporosis. It includes risk factors for osteoporosis and the indications for 
screening, diagnosis of osteoporosis, treatment of osteoporosis in 
postmenopausal and premenopausal women, and men; in addition to prevention and 
treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.

Anti-synthetase syndrome is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy characterized by 
interstitial lung involvement, arthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon, mechanic's hands 
and fever. The case of anti-synthetase syndrome in a young female is reported. 
The patient presented with interstitial lung disease, initially subclinical 
muscle involvement, Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis and mechanic's hands. 
Induction therapy was administrated, that consisted of intravenous 
methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide, followed by azathioprine and prednisone 
with good response, and finally, complete remission. The presence of mechanic's 
hands in a patient with lung involvement should prompt for specific 
investigations such as anti-synthetase antibodies and muscle enzymes. 
Anti-synthetase syndrome should be aggressively managed by immunosuppressive 
therapy, as interstitial lung disease is a severe manifestation of the disease 
which may affect quality of life and life expectancy.
