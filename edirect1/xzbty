Explaining the Decrease in Deaths from Cardiovascular Disease in Poland. The 
Top-Down Risk Assessment Approach, from Policy to Health Impact.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper was to assess the relations between policy 
and health outcome
SETTING: The CVD mortality rate in Poland over the past two decades has 
decreased by about 40%. It was the highest decrease among Central and Eastern 
European countries and also exceptional on a global scale.
DESIGN: Key determinants which can account for these phenomena include 
CVD-related life style factors, better environmental indicators, and better 
access to medical technologies and to pharmacological treatment. Health policy 
played a vital role.
METHODS: The study was based on an extensive literature review, documentation 
analysis and questionnaire survey research. The top-down risk assessment 
approach model was implemented, which followed the logical pathway between the 
policy, health determinants, risk factors and health outcome.
RESULTS: Several national public health programs have been implemented since the 
beginning of the 1990s. The National Health Fund has constantly increased the 
expenditures on cardiology treatment. The number of invasive cardiology units 
has increased, as has the number of coronarography and angioplasty procedures in 
the same period.
CONCLUSIONS: The significant mortality decrease can indicate to policy makers 
that it is necessary to prioritize policies to manage effective, innovative 
medical interventions. Topdown policy risk assessment is a useful methodological 
tool to present the full chain of interactions.

The Association Between Knee Confidence and Muscle Power, Hop Performance, and 
Postural Orientation in People With Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury.

Ageberg E, Roos EM.

Study Design Cross-sectional. Background The association between muscle function 
and lack of knee confidence in people with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) 
injury has not been well investigated. Such knowledge would help in the design 
of training programs for this population. Objective To investigate associations 
between self-reported knee confidence and muscle function in patients with ACL 
injury. Methods Cross-sectional data from 54 patients (mean age, 30 years; 
range, 20-39 years; 28% women) with ACL injury, treated with training and 
reconstructive surgery (n = 36) or training only (n = 18), were assessed 3 ± 1 
years after injury. Univariate and multivariable ordinal regression analyses 
were conducted to test the association between the patient's knee confidence 
(question 3 from the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score as the 
dependent variable) and performance on tests of muscle power, hop performance, 
and postural orientation (test for substitution patterns score) as independent 
variables (absolute value on the injured leg, and limb symmetry index [LSI; 
injured leg/uninjured leg × 100] or absolute difference between the injured and 
uninjured legs). Results Sixteen patients reported no trouble with lack of knee 
confidence, 24 mild trouble, 10 moderate trouble, and 4 severe or extreme 
trouble. Univariate analyses revealed significant associations between worse 
knee confidence and lower (worse) LSIs for knee extension power, vertical jump, 
and side hop, and worse test for substitution patterns scores. In the 
multivariable analysis, worse vertical jump LSI (P = .043) and worse side hop 
LSI (P = .012) significantly accounted for 25% of the variation in perceived 
knee confidence. Conclusion Between-leg differences during demanding tasks are 
associated with knee confidence in individuals with ACL injury. J Orthop Sports

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Antiviral therapy has been demonstrated to significantly 
improve the survival in patients with advanced hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the study was to investigate the 
cost-effectiveness of antiviral therapy in patients with advanced HBV-related 
HCC treated with sorafenib.
METHODS: To conduct the analysis, a Markov model comprising three health states 
(progression-free survival, progressive disease, and death) was created. The 
efficacy data were derived from medical records. Cost data were collected based 
on the Chinese national drug prices. Utility data came from the previously 
published studies. One-way sensitivity analyses as well as probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to explore model uncertainties.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, addition of antiviral therapy to sorafenib 
generated an effectiveness of 0.68 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost 
of $25 026.04, while sorafenib monotherapy gained an effectiveness of 0.42 QALYs 
at a cost of $20 249.64. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
$18 370.77/QALY for antiviral therapy group versus non-antiviral therapy group. 
On the other hand, the ICER between the two groups in patients with high or low 
HBV-DNA load, with or without cirrhosis, normal or elevated alanine 
aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase were $16 613.97/QALY, 
$19 774.16/QALY, $14 587.66/QALY, $19 873.84/QALY, $17 947.07/QALY, and 
$18 785.58/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the cost-effectiveness threshold ($20 301.00/QALY in 
China), addition of antiviral therapy to sorafenib is considered to be a 
cost-effective option compared with sorafenib monotherapy in patients with 
advanced HBV-related HCC in China from the patient's perspective.

BACKGROUND: Dietary salt reduction is included in the top five priority actions 
for non-communicable disease control internationally. We therefore aimed to 
identify health gain and cost impacts of achieving a national target for sodium 
reduction, along with component targets in different food groups.
METHODS: We used an established dietary sodium intervention model to study 10 
interventions to achieve sodium reduction targets. The 2011 New Zealand (NZ) 
adult population (2.3 million aged 35+ years) was simulated over the remainder 
of their lifetime in a Markov model with a 3 % discount rate.
RESULTS: Achieving an overall 35 % reduction in dietary salt intake via 
implementation of mandatory maximum levels of sodium in packaged foods along 
with reduced sodium from fast foods/restaurant food and discretionary intake 
(the "full target"), was estimated to gain 235,000 QALYs over the lifetime of 
the cohort (95 % uncertainty interval [UI]: 176,000 to 298,000). For specific 
target components the range was from 122,000 QALYs gained (for the packaged 
foods target) down to the snack foods target (6100 QALYs; and representing a 
34-48 % sodium reduction in such products). All ten target interventions studied 
were cost-saving, with the greatest costs saved for the mandatory "full target" 
at NZ$1260 million (US$820 million). There were relatively greater health gains 
per adult for men and for Māori (indigenous population).
CONCLUSIONS: This work provides modeling-level evidence that achieving dietary 
sodium reduction targets (including specific food category targets) could 
generate large health gains and cost savings for a national health sector. 
Demographic groups with the highest cardiovascular disease rates stand to gain 
most, assisting in reducing health inequalities between sex and ethnic groups.

Increasing life expectancy has resulted in an increase in neurodegenerative 
disorders like Alzheimer's disease. None of the hypothesis proposed till date 
explains the exact pathobiology of the disease. It is therefore imperative to 
understand the underlying mechanisms. Amyloid beta (Aβ) is regarded as the main 
culprit and maximum therapeutic efforts are centered towards Aβ. This review 
will discuss about the biosynthesis, the physiological role of Aβ including the 
pathogenic aggregation of Aβ resulting neurodegenerative cognitive disabilities. 
Most studies of Alzheimer's disease have focused on the biochemical mechanisms 
involved in the neurodegenerative processes triggered by Aβ aggregates. Aβ is 
generated from mature amyloid precursor protein being metabolized by two 
competing pathways, α-secretase pathway (non-amyloidogenic pathway) and 
β-secretase (amyloidogenic pathway). The physiological roles of Aβ reported in 
neurotrophic properties, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, metal ion 
sequestration and specificity of blood brain barrier. The neuronal injury is the 
result of Aβ oligomerization and it is reported that oligomerization of Aβ 
contributes to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. The physiological role 
of Aβ must be considered in the development of medications that intended to 
decrease its oligomerization forming plaques in a disease like Alzheimer's 
disease. The biosynthetic pathways for transport and accumulation of Aβ need to 
be ascertained as an attempt to develop future strategies for prevention of 
neurodegenerative disorders.

As pollinators, bees are cornerstones for terrestrial ecosystem stability and 
key components in agricultural productivity. All animals, including bees, are 
associated with a diverse community of microbes, commonly referred to as the 
microbiome. The bee microbiome is likely to be a crucial factor affecting host 
health. However, with the exception of a few pathogens, the impacts of most 
members of the bee microbiome on host health are poorly understood. Further, the 
evolutionary and ecological forces that shape and change the microbiome are 
unclear. Here, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of the bee 
microbiome, and we present challenges associated with its investigation. We 
conclude that global coordination of research efforts is needed to fully 
understand the complex and highly dynamic nature of the interplay between the 
bee microbiome, its host, and the environment. High-throughput sequencing 
technologies are ideal for exploring complex biological systems, including 
host-microbe interactions. To maximize their value and to improve assessment of 
the factors affecting bee health, sequence data should be archived, curated, and 
analyzed in ways that promote the synthesis of different studies. To this end, 
the BeeBiome consortium aims to develop an online database which would provide 
reference sequences, archive metadata, and host analytical resources. The goal 
would be to support applied and fundamental research on bees and their 
associated microbes and to provide a collaborative framework for sharing primary 
data from different research programs, thus furthering our understanding of the 
bee microbiome and its impact on pollinator health.

The present study was carried out to examine the treatment effect of cognitive 
behavioral therapy provided by trainee therapists at a university clinic, 
focusing on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) optimism and symptoms. The 
study was conducted through a repeated measures design and included a treatment 
group (n = 21), which received cognitive behavioral therapy for an average of 
10.7 therapy sessions and a control group (n = 14), that was put on a wait list 
for 8.6 weeks on average. After treatment, the treatment group improved 
significantly concerning general health (p = 0.028) and optimism (p = 0.027). In 
addition, clients improved in several areas within mental health and displayed 
some reduction in anxiety symptoms. Concurrently, the results also indicated 
some improvement within the control group, which may have been caused by the 
initial therapeutic contact, expectancy effects or spontaneous remission. The 
study concluded that cognitive behavioral therapy provided by trainee therapists 
may have a positive effect on areas within HRQOL and optimism.

Treatment of hepatitis C is necessary for ensuring higher life expectancy among 
HIV/HCV co-infected patients. However antiviral treatment for chronic HCV 
infection with Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and Ribavirin (RBV) is associated 
with a variety of side effects. In Georgia up to 22% of HIV-infected patients 
were found to have active Tuberculosis (TB) and 22.4 to 32.6% had latent TB. The 
objective of this study was to describe the characteristics and clinical 
outcomes of tuberculosis in HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving hepatitis C 
treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin and calculate incidence rate 
of TB. A retrospective study was conducted among HIV/HCV co-infected patients 
receiving antiviral treatment for chronic HCV infection at the Infectious 
Diseases, AIDS and Clinical Immunology Research Center, Tbilisi, Georgia from 
December 2011 to May, 2015. A total of 420 HIV/HCV co-infected patients received 
HCV therapy with PEG-IFN and RBV during study period. Six of 420 patients 
developed TB while receiving PEG IFN + RBV therapy. These patients were on 
Antiretroviral treatment. Baseline HIV RNA load was <34 copies/ml and CD4+ cell 
counts >350 cells/mm3. No opportunistic infections were observed in all cases. 
Three of 6 patients had a previous positive tuberculin skin test (TST) result 
and had completed isoniazid chemoprophylaxis several years before TB diagnosis. 
In 2 patients TST was not performed. Only one patient had experienced a previous 
episode of TB and had completed the anti-TB therapy 1 year before hepatitis C 
treatment. In all patients TB was diagnosed during the PEG IFN + RBV therapy. 
Hepatitis C treatment was immediately stopped in all patients. The incidence 
rate of TB was 1.4 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI=0.58-2.97). Our study 
emphasizes the necessity of screening for latent TB prior to the initiation of 
chronic hepatitis C treatment with PEG IFN and RBV.

The majority of widespread cancers on the stage of clinical manifestation is 
incurable and therapy is only for the purpose of life extension. So, it isn`t 
surprising that most of people realize the word "cancer" as a verdict. A man 
himself doesn`t believe in his own death and doesn`t realize the fact that 
"Death is an appropriate phenomenon, but not punishment". Facing the death 
causes existential crisis. The understanding of inevitable fact of death arouses 
short, but desperate fight against it, which is, in most cases accompanied by 
anxiety. Some fundamental changes in phsychoemotional status take place within 
the young patients (knowing the diagnosis), which help an individual move into a 
new stage of actions with forming new values and aims. All these give conditions 
for better adaptation of an individual with phsychic traumas. So, the research 
of a person`s emotional situation, facing the death, will help to indentify the 
necessity of prophylactic pharmacotherapy with anxiolytics and to overcome both 
the negative associations with death and the fear connected with it (preserving 
life horizon).

BACKGROUND: The rising incidence of renal cell carcinoma, its more frequent 
early detection (stage T1a) and the increasing prevalence of chronic renal 
failure with higher morbidity and shorter life expectancy underscore the need 
for multimodal focal nephron-sparing therapy.
DISCUSSION: During the past decade, the gold standard shifted from radical to 
partial nephrectomy. Depending on the surgeon's experience, the patient's 
constitution and the tumor's location, the intervention can be performed 
laparoscopically with the corresponding advantages of lower invasiveness. 
A treatment alternative can be advantageous for selected patients with high 
morbidity and/or an increased risk of complications associated with anesthesia 
or surgery. Corresponding risk stratification necessitates previous confirmation 
of the small renal mass (cT1a) by histological examination of biopsy samples. 
Active surveillance represents a controlled delay in the initiation of 
treatment.
RESULTS: Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and laparoscopic 
cryoablation are currently the most common treatment alternatives, although 
there are limitations particularly for renal tumors located centrally near the 
hilum. More recent ablation procedures such as high intensity focused ultrasound 
(HIFU), irreversible electroporation, microwave ablation, percutaneous 
stereotactic ablative radiotherapy and high-dose brachytherapy have high 
potential in some cases but are currently regarded as experimental for the 
treatment of renal cell carcinoma.

Multivalvular disease (MVD) is common among patients with valvular disease, and 
has a complex pathophysiology dependent on the specific combination of valve 
lesions. Diagnosis is challenging because several echocardiographic methods 
commonly used for the assessment of stenosis or regurgitation have been 
validated only in patients with single-valve disease. Decisions about the timing 
and type of treatment should be made by a multidisciplinary heart valve team, on 
a case-by-case basis. Several factors should be considered, including the 
severity and consequences of the MVD, the patient's life expectancy and 
comorbidities, the surgical risk associated with combined valve procedures, the 
long-term risk of morbidity and mortality associated with multiple valve 
prostheses, and the likelihood and risk of reoperation. The introduction of 
transcatheter valve therapies into clinical practice has provided new treatment 
options for patients with MVD, and decision-making algorithms on how to combine 
surgical and percutaneous treatment options are evolving rapidly. In this 
Review, we discuss the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of MVD, 
focusing on the combinations of valve pathologies that are most often 
encountered in clinical practice.

Long noncoding RNAs in gastric cancer carcinogenesis and metastasis.

Nasrollahzadeh-Khakiani M, Emadi-Baygi M, Schulz WA, Nikpour P.

Recent studies of the human transcriptome, most prominently by the ENCyclopedia 
Of DNA Elements project, have revealed an unexpected number of noncoding RNAs 
(ncRNAs). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are typically referred to a 
heterogeneous group of polyadenylated long ncRNAs, with a length of > 200 nt. 
LncRNAs constitute an integral part of tumor biology, with many lncRNAs 
discovered to be aberrantly expressed in various cancer types. They are involved 
in many aspects of cancer pathogenesis from its initiation to progression, 
metastasis and treatment response. Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading 
cause of cancer death worldwide. Despite the current improvements of life 
expectancy and survival rate, most of the patients are diagnosed when their 
cancer has been progressed to advanced stages. Therefore, unraveling the 
molecular mechanisms of GC to find early-stage biomarkers is urgent. As the list 
of lncRNAs with deregulated expression in GC is steadily expanding, these 
molecules offer a source for developing GC-specific biomarkers. In this review, 
we will present and discuss those lncRNAs whose expression has been shown to be 
deregulated in GC.

Juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (jALS) is characterized by progressive 
upper and lower motor neuron degeneration leading to facial muscle spasticity, 
spastic dysarthria, and spastic gait with an early onset (before 25 years old). 
Unlike adult-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), patients with jALS tend 
to have slower progression of motor neuron disease and prolonged survival to a 
normal life expectancy. Mutations in FUS gene have been reported in jALS,(1) 
including p.P525L mutation that has been consistently associated with early 
onset and aggressive presentation.(2) Here, we report a patient carrying p.P525L 
FUS mutation and experiencing an aggressive course of ALS presenting with 
dysphonia and diplopia.

BACKGROUND: People with mental health conditions have a lower life expectancy 
and poorer physical health outcomes than the general population. Evidence 
suggests that this discrepancy is driven by a combination of clinical risk 
factors, socioeconomic factors and health system factors.
OBJECTIVE(S): To explore current service provision and map the recent evidence 
on models of integrated care addressing the physical health needs of people with 
severe mental illness (SMI) primarily within the mental health service setting. 
The research was designed as a rapid review of published evidence from 2013–15, 
including an update of a comprehensive 2013 review, together with further grey 
literature and insights from an expert advisory group.
SYNTHESIS: We conducted a narrative synthesis, using a guiding framework based 
on nine previously identified factors considered to be facilitators of good 
integrated care for people with mental health problems, supplemented by 
additional issues emerging from the evidence. Descriptive data were used to 
identify existing models, perceived facilitators and barriers to their 
implementation, and any areas for further research.
FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION: The synthesis incorporated 45 publications describing 
36 separate approaches to integrated care, along with further information from 
the advisory group. Most service models were multicomponent programmes 
incorporating two or more of the nine factors: (1) information sharing systems; 
(2) shared protocols; (3) joint funding/commissioning; (4) colocated services; 
(5) multidisciplinary teams; (6) liaison services; (7) navigators; (8) research; 
and (9) reduction of stigma. Few of the identified examples were described in 
detail and fewer still were evaluated, raising questions about the replicability 
and generalisability of much of the existing evidence. However, some common 
themes did emerge from the evidence. Efforts to improve the physical health care 
of people with SMI should empower people (staff and service users) and help 
remove everyday barriers to delivering and accessing integrated care. In 
particular, there is a need for improved communication between professionals and 
better information technology to support them, greater clarity about who is 
responsible and accountable for physical health care, and awareness of the 
effects of stigmatisation on the wider culture and environment in which services 
are delivered.
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK: The literature identified in the rapid review was 
limited in volume and often lacked the depth of description necessary to acquire 
new insights. All members of our advisory group were based in England, so this 
report has limited information on the NHS contexts specific to Scotland, Wales 
and Northern Ireland. A conventional systematic review of this topic would not 
appear to be appropriate in the immediate future, although a more interpretivist 
approach to exploring this literature might be feasible. Wherever possible, 
future evaluations should involve service users and be clear about which 
outcomes, facilitators and barriers are likely to be context-specific and which 
might be generalisable.
FUNDING: The research reported here was commissioned and funded by the Health 
Services and Delivery Research programme as part of a series of evidence 
syntheses under project number 13/05/11. For more information visit 
www.nets.nihr.ac.uk/projects/hsdr/130511.

A review of evidence suggests that better integration of physical health care 
for people with severe mental illness requires greater empowerment of staff and 
service users, improved communication, clarity about responsibility and 
accountability of care, and awareness of stigma in service delivery.

Increases in life expectancy have been followed by an upsurge of age-associated 
cognitive decline. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial 
direct current stimulation (tDCS) have risen as promising approaches to prevent 
or delay such cognitive decline. However, consensus has not yet been reached 
about their efficacy in improving cognitive functioning in healthy older adults. 
Here we review the effects of TMS and tDCS on cognitive abilities in healthy 
older adults. Despite considerable variability in the targeted cognitive 
domains, design features and outcomes, the results generally show an enhancement 
or uniform benefit across studies. Most studies employed tDCS, suggesting that 
this technique is particularly well-suited for cognitive enhancement. Further 
work is required to determine the viability of these techniques as tools for 
long-term cognitive improvement. Importantly, the combination of TMS/tDCS with 
other cognitive enhancement strategies may be a promising strategy to alleviate 
the cognitive decline associated with the healthy aging process.

BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) patients who have progressed following 
treatment with both bortezomib and lenalidomide have a poor prognosis. In this 
late stage, other effective alternatives are limited, and patients in Sweden are 
often left with best supportive care. Pomalidomide is a new anti-angiogenic and 
immunomodulatory drug for the treatment of MM. Our objective was to evaluate the 
cost effectiveness of pomalidomide as an add-on to best supportive care in 
patients with relapsed and refractory MM in Sweden.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We developed a health-economic discrete event simulation 
model of a patient's course through stable disease and progressive disease, 
until death. It estimates life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and costs from a societal perspective. Effectiveness data and utilities were 
taken from the MM-003 trial comparing pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone 
with high-dose dexamethasone (HIDEX). Cost data were taken from official Swedish 
price lists, government sources and literature.
RESULTS: The model estimates that, if a patient is treated with HIDEX, life 
expectancy is 1.12 years and the total cost is SEK 179 976 (€19 100), mainly 
indirect costs. With pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone, life expectancy 
is 2.33 years, with a total cost of SEK 767 064 (€81 500), mainly in drug and 
indirect costs. Compared to HIDEX, pomalidomide treatment gives a QALY gain of 
0.7351 and an incremental cost of SEK 587 088 (€62 400) consisting of increased 
drug costs (59%), incremental indirect costs (33%) and other healthcare costs 
(8%). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is SEK 798 613 (€84 900) per QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSION: In a model of late-stage MM patients with a poor prognosis in the 
Swedish setting, pomalidomide is associated with a relatively high incremental 
cost per QALY gained. This model was accepted by the national Swedish 
reimbursement authority TLV, and pomalidomide was granted reimbursement in 
Sweden.

The mean age of the world population has steadily increased in the last decades, 
as a result of increased life expectancy and reduced birth rate. Global aging 
has led to a greater worldwide cost for healthcare: hormonal alterations 
contribute to the pathogenesis of several conditions and might cause a 
significant reduction in the perceived sense of well-being. Menopause is 
archetypal of hormonal alterations occurring during aging: in males, sex 
hormones do not decrease abruptly, yet testosterone levels decrease steadily and 
continuously during aging, ultimately resulting in late-onset hypogonadism. 
Treatment of this condition might mitigate most symptoms; however, testosterone 
replacement therapy (TRT) should be prescribed only in selected patients and it 
should not be considered as an antiaging treatment. In recent years, different 
authors have questioned health risks associated with testosterone treatment; 
while position statements from many scientific societies seem to be reassuring, 
the Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning in regard to the possible 
side effects of this therapy. We aim to review recent controversies and 
discoveries in regard to TRT.

Participating in undergraduate research can be a pivotal experience for students 
in life science disciplines. Development of critical thinking skills, in 
addition to conveying scientific ideas in oral and written formats, is essential 
to ensuring that students develop a greater understanding of basic scientific 
knowledge and the research process. Modernizing the current life sciences 
research environment to accommodate the growing demand by students for 
experiential learning is needed. By developing and implementing a structured, 
theory-based approach to undergraduate research in the life sciences, 
specifically biochemistry, it has been successfully shown that more students can 
be provided with a high-quality, high-impact research experience. The structure 
of this approach allowed students to develop novel, independent projects in a 
computational molecular modeling lab. Students engaged in an experience in which 
career goals, problem-solving skills, time management skills, and independence 
in a research lab were developed. After experiencing this approach to 
undergraduate research, students reported feeling challenged to think critically 
and prepared for future career paths. The approach allowed for a progressive 
learning environment where more undergraduate students could participate in 
publishable research. Future areas for development include implementation in a 
bench-top lab and extension to disciplines beyond biochemistry. In this study, 
it has been shown that utilizing the structured approach to undergraduate 
research could allow for more students to experience undergraduate research and 
develop into more confident, independent life scientists well prepared for 
graduate schools and professional research environments. © 2016 by The

PURPOSE: Guiding response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (guided-NACT) allows for 
an adaptative treatment approach likely to improve breast cancer survival. In 
this study, our primary aim is to explore the expected cost-effectiveness of 
guided-NACT using as a case study the first randomized controlled trial that 
demonstrated effectiveness (GeparTrio trial).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: As effectiveness was shown in hormone-receptor positive 
(HR+) early breast cancers (EBC), our decision model compared the 
health-economic outcomes of treating a cohort of such women with guided-NACT to 
conventional-NACT using clinical input data from the GeparTrio trial. The 
expected cost-effectiveness and the uncertainty around this estimate were 
estimated via probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), from a Dutch 
societal perspective over a 5-year time-horizon.
RESULTS: Our exploratory CEA predicted that guided-NACT as proposed by the 
GeparTrio, costs additional €110, but results in 0.014 QALYs gained per patient. 
This scenario of guided-NACT was considered cost-effective at any willingness to 
pay per additional QALY. At the prevailing Dutch willingness to pay threshold 
(€80.000/QALY) cost-effectiveness was expected with 78% certainty.
CONCLUSION: This exploratory CEA indicated that guided-NACT (as proposed by the 
GeparTrio trial) is likely cost-effective in treating HR+ EBC women. While 
prospective validation of the GeparTrio findings is advisable from a clinical 
perspective, early CEAs can be used to prioritize further research from a 
broader health economic perspective, by identifying which parameters contribute 
most to current decision uncertainty. Furthermore, their use can be extended to 
explore the expected cost-effectiveness of alternative guided-NACT scenarios 
that combine the use of promising imaging techniques together with personalized 
treatments.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with chronic schizophrenia suffer a huge burden, as do their 
families/caregivers. Treating schizophrenia is costly for health systems. The 
European Medicines Agency has approved paliperidone palmitate (PP-LAI; Xeplion), 
an atypical antipsychotic depot; however, its pharmacoeconomic profile in 
Portugal is unknown. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the 
viewpoint of the Portuguese National Health Service.
METHODS: PP-LAI was compared with long acting injectables risperidone (RIS-LAI) 
and haloperidol (HAL-LAI) and oral drugs (olanzapine; oral-OLZ) adapting a 
1-year decision tree to Portugal, guided by local experts. Clinical information 
and costs were obtained from literature sources and published lists. Outcomes 
included relapses (both requiring and not requiring hospitalization) and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were expressed in 2014 euros. 
Economic outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs); including 
cost-utility (outcome = QALYs) and cost-effectiveness analyses 
(outcomes = relapse/hospitalization/emergency room (ER) visit avoided).
RESULTS: The base-case cost of oral-OLZ was 4447€ (20% drugs/20% medical/60% 
hospital); HAL-LAI cost 4474€ (13% drugs/13% medical/74% hospital); PP-LAI cost 
5326€ (49% drugs/12% medical/39% hospital); RIS-LAI cost 6223€ (44% drugs/12% 
medical/44% hospital). Respective QALYs/hospitalizations/ER visits were 
oral-OLZ: 0.761/0.615/0.242; HAL-LAI: 0.758/0.623/0.250; PP-LAI: 
0.823/0.288/0.122; RIS-LAI: 0.799/0.394/0.168. HAL-LAI was dominated by oral-OLZ 
and RIS-LAI by PP-LAI for all outcomes. The ICER of PP-LAI over oral-OLZ was 
14,247€/QALY, well below NICE/Portuguese thresholds (≈24,800€/30,000€/QALY). 
ICERs were 1973€/relapse avoided and 2697€/hospitalization avoided. Analyses 
were robust against most variations in input values, as PP-LAI was 
cost-effective over oral-OLZ in >99% of 10,000 simulations.
CONCLUSION: In Portugal, PP-LAI dominated HAL-LAI and RIS-LAI and was 
cost-effective over oral-OLZ with respect to QALYs gained, relapses avoided, and 
hospitalizations avoided.

COMPLEX MANAGEMENT OF FRAILTY FRACTURES--CASE REPORT.

Costescu EP, Dronic A, Alexa LD, Alexa O.

Frailty fractures encompass pelvic ring fractures in the elderly--a condition 
more frequently encountered in women, usually with pre-existing osteoporosis. 
The incidence of these fractures is increasing, following the increase in 
average life expectancy. Most of the times, they are the result of a minor 
injury, of which the patient has little or no recollection; the clinical signs 
and symptoms, radiological changes and the degree of fracture stability vary 
greatly. As such, there is a wide range of therapeutic options and one of the 
most important decisions for the physician is choosing between surgery and 
conservative treatment. We present the case of an elderly female patient with 
multiple pelvic ring fractures, and a medical history of cardiovascular disease 
and osteoporosis; the orthopedic examination recommended conservative treatment 
which was carried out in the Geriatric Clinic of the "Dr. C.I. Parhon" Hospital. 
Following the complete physical examination and through geriatric evaluation, a 
complex therapeutic plan was devised, which included: recovery through 
physiotherapy, adequate nutrition, psychological support, treatment of the 
cardiovascular comorbidities and prevention of the consequences of extended bed 
rest. The treatment lasted for 60 days and the outcome was favorable: decreased 
bone frailty, mainly through preserving muscle tone and osteoarticular function, 
correction of malnutrition, improvement of depression and partial recovery of 
patient's mobility; the results of our therapy made it possible for the patient 
to return home, where she leaves alone. She will need help with daily household 
chores, but she intends to continue the recovery therapy as means of increasing 
her quality of life and independence.
