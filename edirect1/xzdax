BACKGROUND & AIMS: Systemic iron status affects multiple health outcomes, 
however its net effect on life expectancy is not known. We conducted a 
two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the association of 
genetically proxied iron status with life expectancy.
METHODS: Using genetic data from 48,972 individuals, we identified three genetic 
variants as instrumental variables for systemic iron status. We obtained genetic 
associations of these variants with parental lifespan (n = 1,012,240) and 
individual survival to the 90th vs. 60th percentile age (11,262 cases and 25,483 
controls). We used the inverse-variance weighted method to estimate the effect 
of a 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted serum iron on 
each of the life expectancy outcomes.
RESULTS: We found a detrimental effect of genetically proxied higher iron status 
on life expectancy. A 1-SD increase in genetically predicted serum iron 
corresponded to 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.17, -0.24; 
P = 3.00 × 10-3) fewer years of parental lifespan and had odds ratio 0.81 (95% 
CI 0.70, 0.93; P = 4.44 × 10-3) for survival to the 90th vs. 60th percentile 
age. We did not find evidence to suggest that these results were biased by 
pleiotropic effects of the genetic variants.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher systemic iron status may reduce life expectancy. The 
clinical implications of this finding warrant further investigation, 
particularly in the context of iron supplementation in individuals with normal 
iron status.

OBJECTIVES: This study explored the prognostic factors and developed a 
prediction model for Chinese-American (CA) cervical cancer (CC) patients. We 
compared two alternative models (the restricted mean survival time (RMST) model 
and the proportional baselines landmark supermodel (PBLS model, producing 
dynamic prediction)) versus the Cox proportional hazards model in the context of 
time-varying effects.
SETTING AND DATA SOURCES: A total of 713 CA women with CC and available 
covariates (age at diagnosis, International Federation of Gynecology and 
Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, lymph node metastasis and radiation) from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database were included.
DESIGN: We applied the Cox proportional hazards model to analyse the all-cause 
mortality with the proportional hazards assumption. Additionally, we applied two 
alternative models to analyse covariates with time-varying effects. The 
performances of the models were compared using the C-index for discrimination 
and the shrinkage slope for calibration.
RESULTS: Older patients had a worse survival rate than younger patients. 
Advanced FIGO stage patients showed a relatively poor survival rate and low life 
expectancy. Lymph node metastasis was an unfavourable prognostic factor in our 
models. Age at diagnosis, FIGO stage and lymph node metastasis represented 
time-varying effects from the PBLS model. Additionally, radiation showed no 
impact on survival in any model. Dynamic prediction presented a better 
performance for 5-year dynamic death rates than did the Cox proportional hazards 
model.
CONCLUSIONS: With the time-varying effects, the RMST model was suggested to 
explore diagnosis factors, and the PBLS model was recommended to predict a 
patient's w-year dynamic death rate.

INTRODUCTION: Mental disorders represent the second cause of years lived with 
disability worldwide. Suicide mortality has been targeted as a key public health 
concern by the WHO. Smartphone technology provides a huge potential to develop 
massive and fast surveys. Given the vast cultural diversity of Mexico and its 
abrupt orography, smartphone-based resources are invaluable in order to 
adequately manage resources, services and preventive measures in the population. 
The objective of this study is to conduct a universal suicide risk screening in 
a rural area of Mexico, measuring also other mental health outcomes such as 
depression, anxiety and alcohol and substance use disorders.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A population-based cross-sectional study with a temporary 
sampling space of 9 months will be performed between September 2019 and June 
2020. We expect to recruit a large percentage of the target population (at least 
70%) in a short-term survey of Milpa Alta Delegation, which accounts for 137 927 
inhabitants in a territorial extension of 288 km2.They will be recruited via an 
institutional call and a massive public campaign to fill in an online 
questionnaire through mobile-assisted or computer-assisted web app. This 
questionnaire will include data on general health, validated questionnaires 
including Well-being Index 5, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder Scale 2, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, selected 
questions of the Drug Abuse Screening Test and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating 
Scales and Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5) 
questions about self-harm.We will take into account information regarding time 
to mobile app response and geo-spatial location, and aggregated data on social, 
demographical and environmental variables. Traditional regression modelling, 
multilevel mixed methods and data-driven machine learning approaches will be 
used to test hypotheses regarding suicide risk factors at the individual and the 
population level.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval (002/2019) was granted by the Ethics 
Review Board of the Hospital Psiquiátrico Yucatán, Yucatán (Mexico). This 
protocol has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. The starting date of the 
study is 3 September 2019. Results will serve for the planning and healthcare of 
groups with greater mental health needs and will be disseminated via 
publications in peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant mental health 
conferences.

Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) represents the most severe phenotype of pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) and 
occurs in patients with large unrepaired shunts. Despite early detection of CHD 
and major advances in paediatric cardiac surgery, ES is still prevalent and 
requires a multidisciplinary approach by adult CHD experts in tertiary centres. 
Central cyanosis is the primary clinical manifestation leading to secondary 
erythrocytosis and various multiorgan complications that increase morbidity and 
affect quality of life. Close follow-up is needed to early diagnose and timely 
manage these complications. The primary goal of care is to maintain patients' 
fragile stability. Although the recent use of advanced PAH therapies has 
substantially improved functional capacity and increased life expectancy, 
long-term survival remains poor. Progressive heart failure, infectious diseases 
and sudden cardiac death comprise the main causes of death in patients with ES. 
Impaired exercise tolerance, decreased arterial oxygen saturation, iron 
deficiency, pre-tricuspid shunts, arrhythmias, increased brain natriuretic 
peptide, echocardiographic indices of right ventricular dysfunction and 
hospitalisation for heart failure predict mortality. Endothelin receptor 
antagonists are used as first-line treatment in symptomatic patients, while 
phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors may be added. Due to the lack of evidence, 
current guidelines do not provide a clear therapeutic strategy regarding 
treatment escalation. Additional well-designed trials are required to assess the 
comparative efficacy of various PAH agents and the benefit of combination 
therapy. Finally, the development of a risk score is of utmost importance to 
guide clinical therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Multifarious chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
guidelines have been published by local, national and global respiratory 
societies. These guidelines subsume holistic evidence based on recommendations 
to diagnose, treat, prevent and manage acute exacerbation with COPD. Despite the 
existing comprehensive recommendations, readmission rates and hospitalisations 
have increased in the last decade. Evidence to date has reported suboptimal 
clinical guidelines concordance. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is a 
common hospital presentation due to varied causes such as infective 
exacerbations, worsening disease condition, medication non-adherence, lack of 
education and incomprehensive discharge planning. AECOPD directly and indirectly 
causes economic burden, disrupts health-related quality of life (HRQol), hasten 
lung function decline and increases overall morbidity and mortality. COPD being 
a multimodal chronic disease, consistent interdisciplinary interventions from 
the time of admission to discharge may reduce readmissions and enhance HRQol 
among these patients and their families.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol adheres to the Joanna Briggs Institute 
methodology for mixed methods systematic reviews and the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews 
reporting guidelines. Qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods studies will 
append this study to explore determinants of COPD guidelines concordance. 
Comprehensive three-tier search strategies will be used to search nine databases 
(COCHRANE, EBSCO HOST, MEDLINE, SCIENCE DIRECT, JBI, SCOPUS, WEB OF SCIENCE, 
WILEY and DARE) in May 2020. Two independent reviewers will screen abstracts and 
full-text articles in consonance with inclusion criteria. The convergent 
integrative method narrative review will contribute a deeper understanding of 
any discrepancies found in the existing evidence. Quality of the studies will be 
reported and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) will be used as a priori to 
synthesis data. Identified barriers, facilitators and corresponding clinical 
behavioural change solutions will be categorised using TDF indicators to provide 
future research and implementation recommendations.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required and results 
dissemination will occur through peer-reviewed publication.

Antonio, TX, USA.

Whether pornography contributes to sexual aggression in real life has been the 
subject of dozens of studies over multiple decades. Nevertheless, scholars have 
not come to a consensus about whether effects are real. The current 
meta-analysis examined experimental, correlational, and population studies of 
the pornography/sexual aggression link dating back from the 1970s to the current 
time. Methodological weaknesses were very common in this field of research. 
Nonetheless, evidence did not suggest that nonviolent pornography was associated 
with sexual aggression. Evidence was particularly weak for longitudinal studies, 
suggesting an absence of long-term effects. Violent pornography was weakly 
correlated with sexual aggression, although the current evidence was unable to 
distinguish between a selection effect as compared to a socialization effect. 
Studies that employed more best practices tended to provide less evidence for 
relationships whereas studies with citation bias, an indication of researcher 
expectancy effects, tended to have higher effect sizes. Population studies 
suggested that increased availability of pornography is associated with reduced 
sexual aggression at the population level. More studies with improved practices 
and preregistration would be welcome.

BACKGROUND: Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is used to treat 
aorto-iliac and isolated iliac aneurysms in selected patients, and prospective 
studies have shown advantages compared with open surgical repair, mainly in the 
first years of follow-up. Although this technique produces good results, 
anatomic issues (such as common iliac artery ectasia or an aneurysm that 
involves the iliac bifurcation) can make EVAR more complex and challenging and 
can lead to an inadequate distal seal zone for the stent-graft. Inadequate 
distal fixation in the common iliac arteries can lead to a type Ib endoleak. To 
avoid this complication, one of the most commonly used techniques is unilateral 
or bilateral internal iliac artery occlusion and extension of the iliac limb 
stent-graft to the external iliac arteries with or without embolisation of the 
internal iliac artery. However, this occlusion is not without harm and is 
associated with ischaemic complications in the pelvic territory such as buttock 
claudication, sexual dysfunction, ischaemic colitis, gluteal necrosis, and 
spinal cord injury. New endovascular devices and alternative techniques such as 
iliac branch devices and the sandwich technique have been described to maintain 
pelvic perfusion and decrease complications, achieving revascularisation of the 
internal iliac arteries in patients not suitable for an adequate seal zone in 
the common iliac arteries. These approaches may also preserve the quality of 
life of treated individuals and may decrease other serious complications 
including spinal cord ischaemia, ischaemic colitis, and gluteal necrosis, 
thereby decreasing the morbidity and mortality of EVAR.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of internal iliac artery revascularisation 
versus internal iliac artery occlusion during endovascular repair of aorto-iliac 
aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation.
SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialists searched the 
Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase; the 
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and the World 
Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and 
ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 28 August 2019. The review authors 
searched Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) and the 
Indice Bibliográfico Español de Ciencias de la Salud (IBECS) on 28 August 2019 
and contacted specialists in the field and manufacturers to identify relevant 
studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include all randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) that compared internal iliac artery revascularisation with internal iliac 
artery occlusion for patients undergoing endovascular treatment of aorto-iliac 
aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed 
identified studies for potential inclusion in the review. We used standard 
methodological procedures in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for 
Systematic Review of Interventions.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified no RCTs that met the inclusion criteria.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no RCTs that compared internal iliac artery 
revascularisation versus internal iliac artery occlusion for endovascular 
treatment of aorto-iliac aneurysms and isolated iliac aneurysms involving the 
iliac bifurcation. High-quality studies that evaluate the best strategy for 
managing endovascular repair of aorto-iliac aneurysms with inadequate distal 
seal zones in the common iliac artery are needed.

Squalene is a lipophilic and non-volatile triterpene with many industrial 
applications for food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Metabolic engineering 
focused on optimization of the production pathway suffer from little success in 
improving titers because of a limited space of the cell membrane accommodating 
the lipophilic product. Extension of cell membrane would be a promising approach 
to overcome the storage limitation for successful production of squalene. In 
this study, Escherichia coli was engineered for squalene production by 
overexpression of some membrane proteins. The highest production of 612 mg/L was 
observed in the engineered E. coli with overexpression of Tsr, a serine 
chemoreceptor protein, which induced invagination of inner membrane to form 
multilayered structure. It was also observed an increase in unsaturated fatty 
acid in membrane lipids composition, suggesting cellular response to maintain 
membrane fluidity against squalene accumulation in the engineered strain. This 
study potentiates the capability of E. coli for squalene production and provides 
an effective strategy for the enhanced production of such compounds.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) represents an established and 
safe therapeutic alternative to surgical valve replacement for patients with 
severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. However, some uncertainty still persists 
about long‑term outcomes of this procedure. The aim of this review was to 
analyze the actual state of the art with focus on the new advances that are 
being developed to improve this therapeutic approach. Thanks to improvements in 
technology and materials as well as a substantial standardization of the 
procedure, patients undergoing TAVI are showing increasing life expectancy. 
Although a growing body of evidence demonstrated a convincing midterm safety 
profile, the very long‑ ‑term survival after TAVI still depends on the rate of 
bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF). Structural valve deterioration, leaflet 
thrombosis, prosthesis-patient mismatch, paravalvular regurgitation, and 
endocarditis are the main complications that threaten the preservation of 
valvular function. Through the understanding of these physiopathological 
mechanisms underlying BVF, we analyzed how the management of such valve‑related 
issues has evolved in the last years and how current clinical and research 
efforts are shifting towards the ambit of prevention of valve failure. In 
conclusion, in the near future, the prevention of long‑ ‑term BVF is expected to 
be one of the major challenges regarding TAVI. Currently, promising results can 
be observed in the development of new technologies and therapeutic options.

Theloderma pyaukkya is recorded for the first time in China based on a specimen 
collected from western Yunnan. Morphologically, the specimen shows good 
agreement with the original description of T. pyaukkya, and phylogenetically is 
clustered with the type specimens and holotype of T. pyaukkya from Kachin State 
(northern Myanmar) with strong support. The taxonomic status of T. pyaukkya from 
Chin State (western Myanmar) needs further examination. In addition, Theloderma 
moloch is also recorded in Yunnan for the first time. This brings the number of 
Theloderma species recorded in Yunnan, China, to seven, namely, T. 
albopunctatum, T. baibungense, T. bicolor, T. gordoni, T. moloch, T. pyaukkya, 
and T. rhododiscus.

PURPOSE: Increasing health care costs, longer life expectancy, improved breast 
cancer (BC) survival, and higher levels of complex comorbidities have important 
implications for future Medicare expenditures.
METHODS: Data from the SEER program linked to Medicare claims records were used. 
Women with BC (cases) were categorized into 3 groups on the basis of their year 
of diagnosis (1998, 2003, or 2008) and were propensity score matched to women 
without a BC diagnosis (controls). All stage and stage-specific longitudinal 
changes in survival, morbidity levels using the Elixhauser index, and Medicare 
expenditures in 2018 dollars were calculated and compared.
RESULTS: More than 15% of BC cases were diagnosed in patients over the age of 85 
years. The prevalence of most comorbidities increased over time. Costs among 
cases increased between 1998 and 2008. Spending directly correlated with the 
stage of disease at diagnosis, with the lowest per-patient costs in the ductal 
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) subgroup ($14,792 in 1998 and $19,652 in 2008) and the 
highest in those with distant cancer ($37,667 in 1998 and $43,675 in 2008). 
Assuming no significant changes in the distribution of BC stage or age at 
diagnosis, the total annual costs of caring for patients with BC in women 65 
years of age or older at diagnosis increased by at least $1.1 billion between 
1998 and 2008.
CONCLUSION: Improvements in BC survivorship are associated with intensive use of 
health care resources and substantially higher downstream costs among Medicare 
beneficiaries. Appropriate planning, in both the fiscal and the oncology care 
infrastructure, is required to prepare the health system for these emerging 
health care trends.

Cause of death in autopsy-confirmed dementia disorders.

Degerskär ANW(1), Englund EM(1).

Author information:

Lund, Sweden.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dementia disorders predispose for lethal complications 
and decrease life expectancy. A more profound knowledge regarding end-stage 
conditions in dementia could therefore ameliorate treatment and care of these 
patients.
METHODS: Autopsy reports on 207 deceased individuals with clinically diagnosed 
neurocognitive disorder/dementia and on 200 neurocognitively healthy individuals 
of the same age range were studied. Autopsy results, especially cause of death, 
were compared between the dementia and the control groups.
RESULTS: The two most frequent causes of death in the dementia population were 
pneumonia (34.3%) and acute myocardial infarction (30.4%). This result differed 
from that of the control group, in which acute myocardial infarction (42.5%) 
accounted for most events of deaths, followed by circulatory failure (12.5%). 
The leading cause of death varied amongst dementia subtypes. Further, in 
Alzheimer's disease pneumonia was more frequent in severe/advanced cases whilst 
acute myocardial infarction was more common in milder cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Cause of death differed between the demented and the general 
population of the same age and between subtypes of dementia. Alzheimer's disease 
severity was reflected in different final conditions. The findings have 
relevance for the final stage care and treatment in dementia disorders.

Diverse neighborhood-level environmental and social impacts on health are well 
documented. While studies typically examine these impacts individually, 
examining potential health impacts from multiple sources as a whole can provide 
a broader context of overall neighborhood-level health impacts compared to 
examining each component independently. This study examined the association 
between cumulative neighborhood-level potential health impacts on health and 
expected life expectancy within neighborhoods (census tracts) across Texas using 
the Neighborhood Potential Health Impact Score tool. Among urban census tract 
neighborhoods, a difference of nearly 5 years was estimated between 
neighborhoods with the least health promoting cumulative health impacts compared 
to neighborhoods with the most health promoting cumulative health impacts. 
Differences were observed between rural and urban census tract neighborhoods, 
with rural areas having less variability in expected life expectancy associated 
with neighborhood-level cumulative potential health impacts compared to urban 
areas.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is a rare, 
life-threatening disease with infectious thrombosis causing associated 
complications resulting in high morbidity and mortality. We report a series of 
CST patients with assessment of arterial and intracranial complications.
METHODS: We used the radiology database from a large, academic tertiary care 
center to collect all patients treated with CST between 2002 and 2019. Patient 
demographics, source of infection, treatment course and outcomes were evaluated. 
A review of the recent literature was also performed for similar reported 
complications from CST.
RESULTS: 14 patients with CST treated during this time period were assessed. Of 
the 14 patients, 1 patient died. 7 patients had unilateral narrowing of ICA 
while 3 patients had bilateral narrowing. The ICA narrowing was reversible in 
10/12 patients and improvement but persistent narrowing in one patient. One 
patient had an infectious pseudo aneurysm that was treated by coiling. Extension 
of thrombosis to the transverse- sigmoid sinuses and internal jugular vein were 
seen in 3 patients. Three patients had subdural empyema which was treated 
surgically.
CONCLUSION: The prognosis of CST has improved with advancement in treatment, but 
complications are not infrequent.

Infants (n = 24, mean age 13 months and n = 24, mean age 19 months) were tested 
on an extension of the method introduced by Tomasello and Haberl (2003) to 
examine the understanding of another person's interest in a novel object. Four 
objects were presented serially. For two objects, infants played with an 
experimenter. The infant played with one object alone, and the experimenter 
played with one object alone. Finally, all four objects were presented together, 
and the experimenter excitedly asked for one without indicating which. Results 
showed that younger infants tended to chose the object that they had not yet 
played with, whereas older infants were significantly more likely to choose the 
object that the experimenter had not yet played with. These results are 
discussed in the context of research on the development of understanding 
diversity of simple object-directed attitudes in the second year of life.

INTRODUCTION: An important role of public health organisations is to monitor 
indicators of variation, so as to disclose underlying inequality in health 
improvement. In industrialised societies, more individuals than ever are 
reaching older ages and have become more homogeneous in their age at death. This 
has led to a decrease in lifespan variation, with substantial implications for 
the reduction of health inequalities. We focus on a new form of variation to 
shed further light on our understanding of population health and ageing: 
variation in causes of death.
METHODS: Data from the WHO Mortality Database and the Human Mortality Database 
are used to estimate cause-of-death distributions and life tables in 15 
low-mortality countries. Cause-of-death variation, using 19 groups of causes, is 
quantified using entropy measures and analysed from 1994 to 2017.
RESULTS: The last two decades have seen increasing diversity in causes of death 
in low-mortality countries. There have been important reductions in the share of 
deaths from diseases of the circulatory system, while the share of a range of 
other causes, such as diseases of the genitourinary system, mental and 
behavioural disorders, and diseases of the nervous system, has been increasing, 
leading to a more complex cause-of-death distribution.
CONCLUSIONS: The diversification in causes of death witnessed in recent decades 
is most likely a result of the increase in life expectancy, together with better 
diagnoses and awareness of certain diseases. Such emerging patterns bring 
additional challenges to healthcare systems, such as the need to research, 
monitor and treat a wider range of diseases. It also raises new questions 
concerning the distribution of health resources.

BACKGROUND: Charcot neuroarthropathy is a morbid and expensive complication of 
diabetes that can lead to lower extremity amputation. Current treatment of 
unstable midfoot deformity includes lifetime limb bracing, primary transtibial 
amputation, or surgical reconstruction of the deformity. In the absence of a 
widely adopted treatment algorithm, the decision to pursue more costly attempts 
at reconstruction in the United States continues to be driven by surgeon 
preference.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: To examine the cost effectiveness (defined by lifetime 
costs, quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio [ICER]) of surgical reconstruction and its alternatives (primary 
transtibial amputation and lifetime bracing) for adults with diabetes and 
unstable midfoot Charcot neuroarthropathy using previously published cost data.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare Charcot reconstruction and its 
alternatives in three progressively worsening clinical scenarios: no foot ulcer, 
uncomplicated (or uninfected) ulcer, and infected ulcer. Our base case scenario 
was a 50-year-old adult with diabetes and unstable midfoot deformity. Patients 
were placed into health states based on their disease stage. Transitions between 
health states occurred annually using probabilities estimated from the evidence 
obtained after systematic review. The time horizon was 50 cycles. Data regarding 
costs were obtained from a systematic review. Costs were converted to 2019 USD 
using the Consumer Price Index. The primary outcomes included the long-term 
costs and QALYs, which were combined to form ICERs. Willingness-to-pay was set 
at USD 100,000/QALY. Multiple sensitivity analyses and probabilistic analyses 
were performed to measure model uncertainty.
RESULTS: The most effective strategy for patients without foot ulcers was 
Charcot reconstruction, which resulted in an additional 1.63 QALYs gained and an 
ICER of USD 14,340 per QALY gained compared with lifetime bracing. 
Reconstruction was also the most effective strategy for patients with uninfected 
foot ulcers, resulting in an additional 1.04 QALYs gained, and an ICER of USD 
26,220 per QALY gained compared with bracing. On the other hand, bracing was 
cost effective in all scenarios and was the only cost-effective strategy for 
patents with infected foot ulcers; it resulted in 6.32 QALYs gained and an ICER 
of USD 15,010 per QALY gained compared with transtibial amputation. As unstable 
midfoot Charcot neuroarthropathy progressed to deep infection, reconstruction 
lost its value (ICER USD 193,240 per QALY gained) compared with bracing. This 
was driven by the increasing costs associated with staged surgeries, combined 
with a higher frequency of complications and shorter patient life expectancies 
in the infected ulcer cohort. The findings in the no ulcer and uncomplicated 
ulcer cohorts were both unchanged after multiple sensitivity analyses; however, 
threshold effects were identified in the infected ulcer cohort during the 
sensitivity analysis. When the cost of surgery dropped below USD 40,000 or the 
frequency of postoperative complications dropped below 50%, surgical 
reconstruction became cost effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons aiming to offer both clinically effective and 
cost-effective care would do well to discuss surgical reconstruction early with 
patients who have unstable midfoot Charcot neuroarthropathy, and they should 
favor lifetime bracing only after deep infection develops. Future clinical 
studies should focus on methods of minimizing surgical complications and/or 
reducing operative costs in patients with infected foot ulcers.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine perspective and costing approaches used 
in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) and the distribution of reported 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
METHODS: We analyzed the Tufts Medical Center's CEA and Global Health CEA 
registries, containing 6907 cost-per-quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) and 698 
cost-per-disability-adjusted-life-year (DALY) studies published through 2018. We 
examined how often published CEAs included non-health consequences and their 
impact on ICERs. We also reviewed 45 country-specific guidelines to examine 
recommended analytic perspectives.
RESULTS: Study authors often mis-specified or did not clearly state the 
perspective used. After re-classification by registry reviewers, a healthcare 
sector or payer perspective was most prevalent (74%). CEAs rarely included 
unrelated medical costs and impacts on non-healthcare sectors. The most common 
non-health consequence included was productivity loss in the cost-per-QALY 
studies (12%) and patient transportation in the cost-per-DALY studies (21%). Of 
19,946 cost-per-QALY ratios, the median ICER was $US26,000/QALY (interquartile 
range [IQR] 2900-110,000), and 18% were cost saving and QALY increasing. Of 5572 
cost-per-DALY ratios, the median ICER was $US430/DALY (IQR 67-3400), and 8% were 
cost saving and DALY averting. Based on 16 cost-per-QALY studies (2017-2018) 
reporting 68 ICERs from both the healthcare sector and societal perspectives, 
the median ICER from a societal perspective ($US22,710/QALY [IQR 11,991-49,603]) 
was more favorable than from a healthcare sector perspective ($US30,402/QALY 
[IQR 10,486-77,179]). Most governmental guidelines (67%) recommended either a 
healthcare sector or a payer perspective.
CONCLUSION: Researchers should justify and be transparent about their choice of 
perspective and costing approaches. The use of the impact inventory and 
reporting of disaggregate outcomes can reduce inconsistencies and confusion.

Coronavirus disease 2019, i.e. COVID-19, started as an outbreak in a district of 
China and has engulfed the world in a matter of 3 months. It is posing a serious 
health and economic challenge worldwide. However, case fatality rates (CFRs) 
have varied amongst various countries ranging from 0 to 8.91%. We have evaluated 
the effect of selected socio-economic and health indicators to explain this 
variation in CFR. Countries reporting a minimum of 50 cases as on 14th March 
2020, were selected for this analysis. Data about the socio-economic indicators 
of each country was accessed from the World bank database and data about the 
health indicators were accessed from the World Health Organisation (WHO) 
database. Various socioeconomic indicators and health indicators were selected 
for this analysis. After selecting from univariate analysis, the indicators with 
the maximum correlation were used to build a model using multiple variable 
linear regression with a forward selection of variables and using adjusted 
R-squared score as the metric. We found univariate regression results were 
significant for GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita, POD 30/70 (Probability 
Of Dying Between Age 30 And Exact Age 70 From Any of Cardiovascular Disease, 
Cancer, Diabetes or Chronic Respiratory Disease), HCI (Human Capital Index), 
GNI(Gross National Income) per capita, life expectancy, medical doctors per 
10000 population, as these parameters negatively corelated with CFR (rho = -0.48 
to -0.38 , p<0.05). Case fatality rate was regressed using ordinary least 
squares (OLS) against the socio-economic and health indicators. The indicators 
in the final model were GDP per capita, POD 30/70, HCI, life expectancy, medical 
doctors per 10,000, median age, current health expenditure per capita, number of 
confirmed cases and population in millions. The adjusted R-squared score was 
0.306. Developing countries with a poor economy are especially vulnerable in 
terms of COVID-19 mortality and underscore the need to have a global policy to 
deal with this on-going pandemic. These trends largely confirm that the toll 
from COVID-19 will be worse in countries ill-equipped to deal with it. These 
analyses of epidemiological data are need of time as apart from increasing 
situational awareness, it guides us in taking informed interventions and helps 
policy-making to tackle this pandemic.
