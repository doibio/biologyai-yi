that encompasses demographic complexity and social context to summarize unpaid 
family care work provided to children, elderly, and other family members across 
the life cycle at a population level. The measure (Care Life Expectancy), an 
application of the Sullivan method, estimates the number of years and proportion 
of adult life that people spend in an unpaid caregiving role. We demonstrate the 
value of the metric by using it to describe gender differences in unpaid care 
work in 23 European aging countries. We find that at age 15, women and men are 
expected to be in an unpaid caregiving role for over half of their remaining 
life. For women in most of the countries, over half of those years will involve 
high-level caregiving for a family member. We also find that men lag in 
caregiving across most countries, even when using the lowest threshold of 
caregiving. As we show here, demographic techniques can be used to enhance our 
understanding of the gendered implications of population aging, particularly as 
they relate to policy research and public debate.

The outbreak of coronavirus is spreading at an unprecedented rate to the human 
populations and taking several thousands of life all over the globe. In this 
paper, an extension of the well-known susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered 
(SEIR) family of compartmental model has been introduced with seasonality 
transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The stability analysis of the coronavirus depends on 
changing of its basic reproductive ratio. The progress rate of the virus in 
critical infected cases and the recovery rate have major roles to control this 
epidemic. Selecting the appropriate critical parameter from the Turing domain, 
the stability properties of existing patterns is obtained. The outcomes of 
theoretical studies, which are illustrated via Hopf bifurcation and Turing 
instabilities, yield the result of numerical simulations around the critical 
parameter to forecast on controlling this fatal disease. Globally existing 
solutions of the model has been studied by introducing Tikhonov regularization. 
The impact of social distancing, lockdown of the country, self-isolation, home 
quarantine and the wariness of global public health system have significant 
influence on the parameters of the model system that can alter the effect of 
recovery rates, mortality rates and active contaminated cases with the 
progression of time in the real world.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) are 
clinical syndromes classified as atypical parkinsonism. Due to their overlapping 
symptomatology, recent research shows the necessity of finding new methods of 
examination of these clinical entities. PSP is a heterogenic disease. PSP 
Richardson-Steele Syndrome (PSP-RS) and parkinsonism predominant (PSP-P) are the 
most common clinical variants of progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome. The 
different clinical course and life expectancy of PSP-RS and PSP-P stress the 
need of efficient examination in the early stages. The aim of the study was to 
evaluate the possible feasibility of the combined use of frontal assessment 
battery (FAB) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in the 
differentiation of PSP-RS, PSP-P, and CBS. The findings show that FAB may be 
interpreted as a possible supplementary tool in the differential diagnosis of 
PSP-P and PSP-RS. The differences in SPECT are less pronounced. The study does 
not show any advantages of performing combined frontal SPECT and FAB in the 
differential examination of PSP and CBS. Moreover, PSP-RS and CBS, in a detailed 
evaluation of the frontal lobe, do not show any significant differences. This is 
a relatively small study which, however, highlights the relevant features of 
clinical examination of these rare entities.

Confined experiments are carried out to simulate the closed environment of space 
capsule on the ground. The Chinese Controlled Ecological Life Support System 
(CELSS) is designed including a closed-loop system supporting 4 healthy 
volunteers surviving for 180 days, and we aim to reveal the temporal 
characteristics of the oropharyngeal and nasal microbiota structure in 
crewmembers stayed 180 days in the CELSS, so as to accumulate the information 
about microbiota balance associated with respiratory health for estimating 
health risk in future spaceflight. We investigated the distribution of 
microorganisms and their dynamic characteristics in the nasal cavity and 
oropharynx of occupants with prolonged confinement. Based on the 16S rDNA v3-v4 
regions using Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology, the oropharyngeal 
and nasal microbiota were monitored at eight time points during confinement. 
There were significant differences between oropharyngeal and nasal microbiota, 
and there were also individual differences among the same site of different 
volunteers. Analysis on the structure of the microbiota showed that, in the 
phylum taxon, the nasal bacteria mainly belonged to Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, 
Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, etc. In addition to the above phyla, in 
oropharyngeal bacteria Fusobacterial accounted for a relatively high proportion. 
In the genus taxon, the nasal and oropharyngeal bacteria were independent. 
Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus were dominant in nasal cavity, and 
Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, and Neisseria were dominant in oropharynx. With 
the extension of the confinement time, the abundance of Staphylococcus in the 
nasal cavity and Neisseria in the oropharynx increased, and the index Chao 
fluctuated greatly from 30 to 90 days after the volunteers entered the CELSS. 
Conclusion: The structure and diversity of the nasal and oropharyngeal 
microbiota changed in the CELSS, and there was the phenomenon of migration 
between occupants, suggesting that the microbiota structure and health of the 
respiratory tract could be affected by living in a closed environment for a long 
time.

The association between healthcare expenditures and outcomes, mainly mortality 
and life expectancy, is complex. The real explanation for this association is 
not clear, especially in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. This 
study assesses the impact of health expenditures on improving healthcare systems 
and health status and finds a relationship between health expenditures and 
health outcomes across different region. Annual time series data on healthcare 
spending and outcomes from 1995 to 2015 were used for MENA region in comparison 
to developed and developing countries. Health expenditure was adjusted by the 
consumer price index equation to the 2015 US dollar eliminate the impact of 
inflation on our results. For many countries, spending on healthcare continues 
to rise, Among MENA countries, we found that the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait 
spent more per capita on health, $1,711 and $1,420, respectively, than any other 
countries in the region. Although this study demonstrated a relationship between 
total healthcare expenditure and outcomes, some countries spend more on 
healthcare but have shorter life expectancy. In most countries, efficient and 
effective utilization of healthcare resources is the key strategy for improving 
health outcomes in any country. The lack of a positive correlation between 
healthcare spending and life expectancy may indicate that health resources are 
not allocated effectively. In those cases, increasing health spending does not 
guarantee that there is any kind of improvement in healthcare.

Secondary mitral regurgitation (MR) occurs despite structurally normal valve 
apparatus due to an underlying disease of the myocardium leading to disruption 
of the balance between tethering and closing forces with ensuing failure of 
leaflet coaptation. In patients with heart failure (HF) and left ventricular 
dysfunction, secondary MR is independently associated with poor outcome, yet 
prognostic benefits related to the correction of MR have remained elusive. 
Surgery is not recommended for the correction of secondary MR outside coronary 
artery bypass grafting. Percutaneous mitral valve repair (PMVR) with MitraClip 
implantation has recently evolved as a new transcatheter treatment option of 
inoperable or high-risk patients with severe MR, with promising results 
supporting the extension of guideline recommendations. MitraClip is highly 
effective in reducing secondary MR in HF patients. However, the derived clinical 
benefit is still controversial as two randomized trials directly comparing PMVR 
vs. optimal medical therapy in severe secondary MR yielded virtually opposite 
conclusions. We reviewed current evidence to identify predictors of PMVR-related 
outcomes in secondary MR useful to improve the timing and the selection of 
patients who would derive maximal benefit from MitraClip intervention. Beyond 
mitral valve anatomy, optimal candidate selection should rely on a comprehensive 
diagnostic workup and a fine-tuned risk stratification process aimed at (i) 
recognizing the substantial heterogeneity of secondary MR and its complex 
interaction with the myocardium, (ii) foreseeing hemodynamic consequences of 
PMVR, (iii) anticipating futility and (iv) improving symptoms, quality of life 
and overall survival.

Trust, Coventry.

UK.

OBJECTIVE: Longer life expectancy has resulted in people living with an 
increasing number of co-morbidities. The average individual with inflammatory 
arthritis has two co-morbidities, which contribute to higher mortality, poorer 
functional outcomes and increased health-care utilization and cost. A number of 
studies have investigated the prevalence of co-morbidities, whereas this study 
was designed to look at patient perspectives.
METHODS: The study comprised two parts: a patient questionnaire and an 
interview. Individuals with physician-verified inflammatory arthritis along with 
one or more Charlson co-morbidities were invited to participate. In-depth data 
were obtained by interviews with 12 willing participants.
RESULTS: One hundred and forty-six individuals were recruited; 50 (35%) had one 
co-morbidity, 69 (48%) had two and 25 (17%) had more than four co-morbidities. 
Seventy-seven individuals (53%) reported that co-morbidities affected their 
health as much as their arthritis, and 82 (56%) reported dependence on others 
for activities of daily living. Lack of education was highlighted by 106 (73%) 
participants. Qualitative data provided further support for the challenges, with 
participants highlighting the lack of time to discuss complex or multiple 
problems, with no-one coordinating their care. This, in turn, led to 
polypharmacy and insufficient discussion around drug and disease interactions, 
complications and self-help measures.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the challenges for individuals with 
inflammatory arthritis who suffer with multiple co-morbidities. The challenges 
result from limited resources or support within the current health-care 
environments. Individuals highlighted the poor quality of life, which is 
multifactorial, and the need for better educational strategies and coordination 
of care to improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is an emerging 
concept in cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Recent research has 
documented a significant improvement in favorable outcomes, notable survival to 
discharge, and neurologically intact survival.
OBJECTIVES: The present study undertakes a scoping review to summarize the 
available evidence by assessing the use of ECPR, compared with no ECPR or the 
standard of care, for adult patients who sustain cardiac arrest in any setting, 
in studies which record survival and neurologic outcomes.
METHODS: This review followed the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Four online databases were used to identify papers 
published from database inception to July 12, 2020. We selected 23 observational 
studies from Asia, Europe, and North America that used survival to discharge or 
neurologically intact survival as a primary or secondary endpoint variable in 
patients with cardiac arrest refractory to standard treatment.
RESULTS: Twenty-three observational studies were included in the review. Eleven 
studies were of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 7 studies were of in-hospital 
cardiac arrest, and 5 studies included mixed populations. Ten studies reported 
long-term favorable neurological outcomes (ie, Cerebral Performance Category 
score of 1 - 2 at 3 months [n = 3], 6 months [n = 3], and 1 year [n = 4]), of 
which only 4 had statistical significance at 5% significance levels. Current 
knowledge is mostly drawn from single-center observations, with most of the 
evidence coming from case series and cohort studies, hence is prone to 
publication bias. No randomized control trials were included.
CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review highlights the need for high-quality studies to 
increase the level of evidence and reduce knowledge gaps to change the paradigm 
of care for patients with shock-refractory cardiac arrest.

BACKGROUND: As populations age, the possible consequences of increased frailty 
are a major concern for the health sector. Here, we investigate how life 
expectancy with and without frailty has changed during a 10-11-year-period 
across Europe.
METHODS: The Sullivan method was used to investigate changes in life expectancy 
with and without frailty in 10 European countries. Frailty status (non-frail, 
pre-frail and frail) was determined by use of the Survey of Health, Ageing and 
Retirement in Europe Frailty Instrument (SHARE-FI). Data on frailty prevalence 
was obtained from 21 698 individuals in wave 1 (2004-05) and 38 859 individuals 
in wave 6 (2015) of the SHARE. Information on mortality was obtained from the 
Eurostat Database.
RESULTS: In 2015, women aged 70 spent 25.0% (95% CI: 24.0-26.1) of their 
remaining life expectancy in a frail state, and the number for men was 11.5% 
(95% CI: 10.7-12.3). Southern Europeans spent 24.2% (95% CI: 22.9-25.4) of their 
remaining life expectancy in a frail state and the numbers for Central Europeans 
and Northern Europeans were 17.0% (95% CI: 16.0-17.9) and 12.2% (95% CI: 
10.9-13.5), respectively. From 2004-05 to 2015, life expectancy increased by 
1.1 years (from 15.3 to 16.4 years) for 70-year-old Europeans. Similarly, 
non-frail life expectancy increased by 1.1 years (95% CI: 0.8-1.4), whereas no 
significant changes in life expectancy in frail states were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that Europeans today spend more years in a 
non-frail state than Europeans did 10-11 years ago. Our findings reflect a 
considerable inequality by gender and region.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
health state utility decrements associated with overweight and obesity in adults 
18 years and over, for use in modelled economic evaluations in Australia.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in nine databases to identify studies 
that reported health state utility values by weight status. Random-effects 
meta-analysis was used to synthesise average utility decrements (from healthy 
weight) associated with overweight, all obesity and obesity classes 1, 2 and 3. 
Heterogeneity surrounding utility decrements was assessed via sub-group 
analysis, random-effects meta-regression and sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Twelve studies were found for which data were used to synthesise 
utility decrements, estimated as overweight = 0.020 (95% confidence interval 
0.010-0.030), all obesity = 0.055 (0.034-0.076), obesity class 1 = 0.047 
(0.017-0.077), class 2 = 0.072 (0.028-0.116) and class 3 = 0.084 (0.039-0.130). 
There was considerable heterogeneity in our results, which could be accounted 
for by the different ages and utility instruments used in the contributing 
studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that elevated weight status is associated 
with small but statistically significant reductions in utility compared with 
healthy weight, which will result in reduced quality-adjusted life years when 
extrapolated across time and used in economic evaluations.

Rhinocerebral mucormycosis (RCM) may result in severe intracranial ischemic and 
hemorrhagic lesions. Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) play an essential role in the diagnosis of RCM, but whereas CT is 
better for assessing bone erosion, MRI is superior in evaluating soft tissue, 
intraorbital extension, and in assessing intracranial and vascular invasion. 
Specific CT and MRI techniques, such as CT angiography or enhanced MR 
angiography, and more advanced MRI sequences such as gadolinium-3D Black Blood 
imaging, contribute to the assessment of the extension of vascular invasion.In 
this pictorial review, we describe specific CT and MRI signs of RCM, mainly 
focusing on its life-threatening complications due to vascular involvement.

In January 2020, charcoal gray, dull lesions were observed on leaves of organic 
kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala) cv. Darkibor in two fields in Lexington 
County, South Carolina, the county with the most acres of leafy brassicas in the 
state. Leaf spots, also visible on the leaf underside, covered <5% of the leaf 
area. No spores were present. Portions of leaf spots from eight leaves, four per 
field, were cultured on one-quarter-strength potato dextrose agar (PDA/4). 
Eleven isolates of Alternaria spp. were recovered. Isolates ALT12 and UL3 were 
cultured in A. solani medium and DNA was extracted (Maiero et al. 1991). The 
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, translation elongation factor 1-alpha 
(tef1), RNA polymerase second largest subunit (rpb2), and Alternaria major 
allergen (Alt a 1) genes were amplified with the primer pairs V9G/ITS4, 
EF1-728F/EF1-986R, RPB2-5F2/FRPB2-7cR, and Alt-for/Alt-rev, respectively, and 
sequenced (Woudenberg et al. 2014). Sequences for isolates ALT12 and UL3, 
collected from different leaves in the same field, were identical to each other 
and to isolate AC97 (ITS accession number: LC440597; tef1: LC482018; rpb2: 
LC476803; Alt a 1: LC481628) of A. japonica Yoshii (Nishikawa and Nakashima 
2020). ITS, tef1, repb2, and Alta a 1 sequences for each isolate were deposited 
in GenBank under the accessions MW374952, MW389653, MW389655, and MW389657 for 
ALT12 and MW374951, MW389652, MW389654, and MW389656 for UL3, respectively. 
Conidia of A. japonica (20 of ALT12, 10 of UL3) produced by 7-day-old cultures 
on Spezieller Nährstoffarmer Agar measured 62.1 ± 11.4 x 18.8 ± 2.2 μm (standard 
deviation). Median numbers of transverse and longitudinal septae were 6 (4 to 8) 
and 2 (1 to 3), respectively. Conidia formed singly or in chains of two. Cells 
were constricted around the transverse septae (Nishikawa and Nakashima 2020; 
Woudenburg et al. 2014). Chlamydospores were present in cultures of ALT12. ALT12 
was pathogenic on kale cv. Darkibor and Winterbor inoculated in a greenhouse 
following procedures of Al-Lami et al. (2019). Four replicate pots with two 
plants each were used; plants were 6, 9, and 5 weeks old in trials 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively. The oldest three leaves of each plant were spray inoculated with a 
suspension of 5 x 105 conidia/ml; noninoculated control plants were sprayed with 
water. All plants were kept for 48 h at 100% RH, then moved to a bench in a 
greenhouse held at 21/16°C day/night temperatures. The second and third oldest 
leaves were rated 13 days after inoculation. Small gray or black spots developed 
on inoculated leaves and petioles in all trials, and on one noninoculated leaf 
in trial one. Disease incidence on inoculated leaves (73.1%) was greater than on 
noninoculated leaves (0.05%) (P<0.0001). Cultivars did not differ in 
susceptibility (P=0.12). Portions of lesions on inoculated leaves and portions 
of noninoculated leaves were cultured onto PDA/4 amended with antibiotics 
(Keinath 2013). A. japonica was reisolated from 46 of 50 inoculated leaf blades; 
22 of 28 inoculated petioles; and 1 of 8, 0 of 8, and 0 of 7 noninoculated 
leaves in the three trials, respectively. Growers in South Carolina consider 
black spot, or Alternaria leaf spot, the most important fungal disease on 
organic kale. The presence of a second causal agent in addition to A. brassicae 
may increase disease occurrence. A. japonica previously was reported on arugula 
in California (Tidwell et al. 2014). This is the first report of A. japonica in 
the eastern United States.

Human uniqueness? Life history diversity among small-scale societies and 
chimpanzees.

BACKGROUND: Humans life histories have been described as "slow", patterned by 
slow growth, delayed maturity, and long life span. While it is known that human 
life history diverged from that of a recent common chimpanzee-human ancestor 
some ~4-8 mya, it is unclear how selection pressures led to these distinct 
traits. To provide insight, we compare wild chimpanzees and human subsistence 
societies in order to identify the age-specific vital rates that best explain 
fitness variation, selection pressures and species divergence.
METHODS: We employ Life Table Response Experiments to quantify vital rate 
contributions to population growth rate differences. Although widespread in 
ecology, these methods have not been applied to human populations or to inform 
differences between humans and chimpanzees. We also estimate correlations 
between vital rate elasticities and life history traits to investigate 
differences in selection pressures and test several predictions based on life 
history theory.
RESULTS: Chimpanzees' earlier maturity and higher adult mortality drive species 
differences in population growth, whereas infant mortality and fertility 
variation explain differences between human populations. Human fitness is 
decoupled from longevity by postreproductive survival, while chimpanzees forfeit 
higher potential lifetime fertility due to adult mortality attrition. Infant 
survival is often lower among humans, but lost fitness is recouped via short 
birth spacing and high peak fertility, thereby reducing selection on infant 
survival. Lastly, longevity and delayed maturity reduce selection on child 
survival, but among humans, recruitment selection is unexpectedly highest in 
longer-lived populations, which are also faster-growing due to high fertility.
CONCLUSION: Humans differ from chimpanzees more because of delayed maturity and 
lower adult mortality than from differences in juvenile mortality or fertility. 
In both species, high child mortality reflects bet-hedging costs of 
quality/quantity tradeoffs borne by offspring, with high and variable child 
mortality likely regulating human population growth over evolutionary history. 
Positive correlations between survival and fertility among human subsistence 
populations leads to selection pressures in human subsistence societies that 
differ from those in modern populations undergoing demographic transition.

OBJECTIVE: The devastating event of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) 
in patients who have survived a previous AAA repair, either elective or urgent, 
is a feared and quite uncommon event. It has been suggested to partly explain 
the loss of the early survival benefit for endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) vs 
open surgical repair (OSR). The main objective of this study was to report the 
national incidence rate, risk factors and outcome of post-EVAR ruptures. 
Secondarily, the national incidence rate of ruptures after OSR (post-OSR 
ruptures) was investigated.
METHODS: We conducted a nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study 
using the inpatient and outpatient entries for all patients >40 years of age, 
receiving their first (index) surgical procedure for AAA, from 2001 to 2015. 
Only patients surviving their index procedure were included. The primary outcome 
was rAAA, registered after discharge from the index procedure (EVAR or OSR), 
identified in the Swedish National Patient Registry and the Cause of Death 
Registry.
RESULTS: In total, 14,859 patients survived their primary (index) AAA procedure. 
There were 6470 EVAR procedures, 5893 for intact AAA (iAAA) and 577 for rAAA. Of 
the 6470 EVAR patients, 86 cases of post-EVAR rupture were identified, 
corresponding with a cumulative incidence of 1.3% over a mean follow-up time of 
3.9 years. The incidence rate was 3.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
2.7-4.2)/1000 person-years. The independent risk factors identified for 
post-EVAR rupture were rAAA at index surgery HR 2.4 (95% CI, 1.4-4.1, p 0.002) 
and age (hazard ratio, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.1; P < .001). Freedom from post-EVAR 
rupture was 99%, 98%, and 96% at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Total and 
postoperative mortality after post-EVAR rupture were 42% and 17% (30 days), 45% 
and 22% (90 days), and 53% and 33% (1 year). The incidence rate of post-OSR 
rupture was 0.9/1000 person-years (95% CI, 0.7-1.2).
CONCLUSIONS: Post-EVAR rupture is a rare complication that can occur at any time 
after the index EVAR procedure. This finding may have implications for the 
discussion of limited follow-up programs and for the choice of procedure in 
patients with an AAA with a long life expectancy. An rAAA as the indication for 
the index surgery and age were identified as risk factors for post-EVAR rupture. 
The mortality associated with post-EVAR rupture is high, but lower than that of 
primary rAAA. The much lower risk of post-OSR rupture was confirmed, but must 
not be neglected as a possible late complication.

Comparison of serum monocide chemoattractant protein levels with 
immunosuppressive therapy protocols in patients with renal transplantation.

Demirci R, Akyuz O.

BACKGROUND: Renal transplantation stands out with lower cost advantages in life 
expectancy, quality of life and especially in the long-term perspective compared 
to dialysis. Having significant side effects of immunosuppressive drugs in terms 
of patient and graft survival limits the use of these drugs. A variety of 
markers are being explored to prolong the renal graft life. One of these 
molecules, monocide chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) is a marker involved in 
renal inflammation. The production of MCP-1 was blocked in kidney diseases and 
the disease was improved. Along with these promising developments, we decided to 
investigate whether there is a significant relationship between 
immunosuppressive therapies used in renal transplantation therapy and serum 
MCP-1 levels.
METHODS: Our study was performed in 80 patients who underwent kidney 
transplantation followed in Haydarpaşa Numune Training and Research Hospital. 
These 80 patients were examined in 4 groups as Group 1 (cyclosporin), Group 2 
(tacrolimus), Group 3 (sirolimus) and Group 4 (everolimus). Serum MCP-1 levels 
were compared between the groups by using ELISA method.
RESULTS: In our study, serum MCP-1 levels were significantly higher in 
cyclosporine and tacrolimus groups than in sirolimus (p<0.05). When calcineurin 
inhibitors and everolimus were compared, it was not statistically significant, 
although calcineurin inhibitors were higher.
CONCLUSION: Understanding the role of MCP-1 in monocyte homeostasis and the 
effects of MCP-1 inhibition in kidney disease will help to design better 
diagnostic and treatment strategies in patients with inflammatory kidney disease 
(Tab. 2, Fig. 7, Ref. 45).

Manchester, Manchester.

BACKGROUND: After decades of steady progress, life expectancy at birth has 
stalled in England. Inequalities are also rising, and life expectancy has fallen 
for females living in the most deprived areas. However, less attention has been 
given to trends in other measures of population health, particularly 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
AIM: To examine trends and inequalities in HRQoL in England between 2012 and 
2017.
DESIGN AND SETTING: The authors used nationally representative survey data on 
3.9 million adults to examine HRQoL (measured by EQ-5D-5L overall score, plus 
each of the five health domains - mobility, selfcare, usual activity, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression).
METHOD: The study explored trends across time, and inequalities by sex, age, and 
deprivation.
RESULTS: Although HRQoL seemed steady overall between 2012 and 2017, there is 
evidence of increasing inequality across population subgroups. There was a rise 
in sex disparity over time, the female-male gap in EQ-5D-5L increased from 
-0.009 in 2012 to -0.016 in 2017. Trends for the youngest females and those 
living in the most deprived areas were of the greatest concern. Females in the 
most deprived regions suffered a 1.3% decrease in HRQoL between 2012 and 2017, 
compared with a 0.5% decrease for males. The key contribution to the decline in 
HRQoL, particularly in females, was a 1.5% increase in reported levels of 
anxiety/depression between 2012 and 2017.
CONCLUSION: Developing interventions to address these worrying trends should be 
a policy priority. A particular focus should be on mental health in younger 
populations, especially for females and in deprived areas.

BACKGROUND: Beta-thalassemia minor and thalassemia major are an autosomal 
recessive disease with hypochromic, microcytic anemia, and morbidities, Today, 
therapeutic advances have significantly improved the life expectancy of 
thalassemia major patients, but at the cost of financial toxicity. The present 
study aimed to investigate the possibility of increasing the funding for 
thalassemia screening programs and comparing the cost-effectiveness of screening 
for thalassemia in the treatment of the patients.
METHODS: In this study, screening for thalassemia minor was compared with the 
treatment of thalassemia major patients. A decision tree model was used for 
analysis. A hospital database, supplemented with a review of published 
literature, was used to derive input parameters for the model. A lifetime study 
horizon was used and future costs and consequences were discounted at 3%. The 
approach of purchases of services was used to evaluate the screening test costs 
for patients with thalassemia major. Also, a bottom-up method was applied to 
estimate other screening and treatment costs. All the costs were calculated over 
one year. The number of gained quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was 
calculated using the EQ-5D questionnaire in the evaluated patients.
RESULTS: In this study, 26.97 births of patients with thalassemia major were 
prevented by screening techniques. On the other hand, total screening costs for 
patients with thalassemia major were estimated equal to US$ 879879, while the 
costs of preventing the birth of each thalassaemia major patient was US$ 32 624 
by screening techniques. In comparison, the cost of managing a patient with 
thalassemia major is about US$ 136 532 per year. The life time QALYs for this is 
11.8 QALYs. Results are presented using a societal perspective. Incremental cost 
per QALY gained with screening as compared with managing thalassaemia major was 
US$ 11 571.
CONCLUSION: Screening is a long-term value for money intervention that is highly 
cost effective and its long-term clinical and economic benefits outweigh those 
of managing thalassaemia major patients.

IMPORTANCE: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune-mediated neurodegenerative 
disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammatory 
demyelination with axonal transection. MS affects an estimated 900 000 people in 
the US. MS typically presents in young adults (mean age of onset, 20-30 years) 
and can lead to physical disability, cognitive impairment, and decreased quality 
of life. This review summarizes current evidence regarding diagnosis and 
treatment of MS.
OBSERVATIONS: MS typically presents in young adults aged 20 to 30 years with 
unilateral optic neuritis, partial myelitis, sensory disturbances, or brainstem 
syndromes such as internuclear ophthalmoplegia developing over several days. The 
prevalence of MS worldwide ranges from 5 to 300 per 100 000 people and increases 
at higher latitudes. Overall life expectancy is less than in the general 
population (75.9 vs 83.4 years), and MS more commonly affects women (female to 
male sex distribution of nearly 3:1). Diagnosis is made based on a combination 
of signs and symptoms, radiographic findings (eg, magnetic resonance imaging 
[MRI] T2 lesions), and laboratory findings (eg, cerebrospinal fluid-specific 
oligoclonal bands), which are components of the 2017 McDonald Criteria. Nine 
classes of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), with varying mechanisms of action 
and routes of administration, are available for relapsing-remitting MS, defined 
as relapses at onset with stable neurologic disability between episodes, and 
secondary progressive MS with activity, defined as steadily increasing 
neurologic disability following a relapsing course with evidence of ongoing 
inflammatory activity. These drugs include interferons, glatiramer acetate, 
teriflunomide, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators, fumarates, 
cladribine, and 3 types of monoclonal antibodies. One additional DMT, 
ocrelizumab, is approved for primary progressive MS. These DMTs reduce clinical 
relapses and MRI lesions (new T2 lesions, gadolinium-enhancing lesions). 
Efficacy rates of current DMTs, defined by reduction in annualized relapse rates 
compared with placebo or active comparators, range from 29%-68%. Adverse effects 
include infections, bradycardia, heart blocks, macular edema, infusion 
reactions, injection-site reactions, and secondary autoimmune adverse effects, 
such as autoimmune thyroid disease.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: MS is characterized by physical disability, cognitive 
impairment, and other symptoms that affect quality of life. Treatment with DMT 
can reduce the annual relapse rate by 29% to 68% compared with placebo or active 
comparator.

BACKGROUND: Low-value care, typically defined as health services that provide 
little or no benefit, has potential to cause harm, incur unnecessary costs, and 
waste limited resources. Although evidence-based guidelines identifying 
low-value care have increased, the guidelines differ in the type of evidence 
they cite to support recommendations against its routine use.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the evidentiary rationale underlying recommendations 
against low-value interventions.
DESIGN: We identified 1167 "low-value care" recommendations across five US 
organizations: the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the "Choosing 
Wisely" Initiative, American College of Physicians (ACP), American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), and American Society of 
Clinical Oncology (ASCO). For each recommendation, we classified the reported 
evidentiary rationale into five groups: (1) low economic value; (2) no net 
clinical benefit; (3) little or no absolute clinical benefit; (4) insufficient 
evidence; (5) no reason mentioned. We further investigated whether any cited or 
otherwise available cost-effectiveness evidence was consistent with conventional 
low economic value benchmarks (e.g., exceeding $100,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year).
RESULTS: Of the identified low-value care recommendations, Choosing Wisely 
contributed the most (N=582, 50%), followed by ACC/AHA (N=250, 21%). The 
services deemed "low value" differed substantially across organizations. "No net 
clinical benefit" (N=428, 37%) and "little or no clinical benefit" (N=296, 25%) 
were the most commonly reported reasons for classifying an intervention as low 
value. Consideration of economic value was less frequently reported (N=171, 
15%). When relevant cost-effectiveness studies were available, their results 
were mostly consistent with low-value care recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that evidentiary rationales for low-value care vary 
substantially, with most recommendations relying on clinical evidence. 
Broadening the evidence base to incorporate cost-effectiveness evidence can help 
refine the definition of "low-value" care to reflect whether an intervention's 
costs are worth the benefits. Developing a consensus grading structure on the 
strength and evidentiary rationale may help improve de-implementation efforts 
for low-value care.
