This research aims to present a state-of-the-art cleaning technology solution 
that effectively overcomes the dust accumulation issue for conventional 
photovoltaic systems. Although continuous innovations and advanced developments 
within renewable energy technologies have shown steady improvements over the 
past years, the dust accumulation issue remains one of the main factors 
hindering their efficiency and degradation rate. By harvesting abundant solar 
thermal energy, the presented self-cleaning system uses a unique 
thermomechanical property of Shape Memory Alloys to operate a solar-based 
thermomechanical actuator. Therefore, this study carries out different numerical 
and experimental validation tests to highlight the promising practicability of 
the developed self-cleaning system from thermal and mechanical perspectives. The 
results showed that the system has a life expectancy of over 20 years, which is 
closely equivalent to the life expectancy of conventional photovoltaic modules 
while operating under actual weather conditions in Dammam city. Additionally, 
the thermal to mechanical energy conversion efficiency reached 19.15% while 
providing average cleaning effectiveness of about 95%. The presented outcomes of 
this study add to the body of knowledge an innovative methodology for a unique 
solar-based self-cleaning system aimed toward smart and modern photovoltaic 
applications.

The current findings on concrete with fibers show that research has focused 
primarily on individual aspects, especially in terms of mechanical properties 
and structural uses. However, no broader view of the problems solved has been 
provided. In this study, we present a conceptual overview of a new, 
comprehensive experimental program for the assessment of fiber-reinforced 
concrete, which includes the analysis of microstructural and structural 
elements, as well as specific features such as shrinkage and resistance to 
pressurized water. The proposed experimental program included several variants 
of schemes for the dosing of fibers into concrete, using steel fibers that were 
short and straight. Fiber dosing was performed up to 110 kg/m3. The basic tests 
performed included tests of the compressive strength of concrete, and of the 
split and flexural tensile strength for different dosing amounts. Within the 
structural tests of reinforced concrete beams without shear reinforcement, two 
variants of spans with different degrees of reinforcement were implemented. 
Herein, the test results are evaluated graphically with a detailed analysis of 
the positive effect of fibers, and we also provide general recommendations for 
the structural uses of the fibers used and the design of fiber-reinforced 
concrete structures. Among the important results of this experimental program 
was the observation of a significant increase (of the order of tens) of the 
percentage of the split tensile strength and an increase of the overall 
load-bearing capacity of the reinforced concrete beams without shear 
reinforcement. Among the important aspects of our findings is the fact that a 
fine-grained concrete mixture was used, which increased resistance to pressure 
water seepage, and therefore, the effect of shrinkage can be influenced by the 
method of production and the treatment of the concrete used. We also provide 
detailed figures of the microstructure.

The neglected tropical disease (NTD) leishmaniasis is the collective name given 
to a diverse group of illnesses caused by ~20 species belonging to the genus 
Leishmania, a majority of which are vector borne and associated with complex 
life cycles that cause immense health, social, and economic burdens locally, but 
individually are not a major global health priority. Therapeutic approaches 
against leishmaniasis have various inadequacies including drug resistance and a 
lack of effective control and eradication of the disease spread. Therefore, the 
development of a rationale-driven, target based approaches towards novel 
therapeutics against leishmaniasis is an emergent need. The utilization of 
Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning methods, which have made significant 
advances in drug discovery applications, would benefit the discovery process. In 
this review, following a summary of the disease epidemiology and available 
therapies, we consider three important leishmanial metabolic pathways that can 
be attractive targets for a structure-based drug discovery approach towards the 
development of novel anti-leishmanials. The folate biosynthesis pathway is 
critical, as Leishmania is auxotrophic for folates that are essential in many 
metabolic pathways. Leishmania can not synthesize purines de novo, and salvage 
them from the host, making the purine salvage pathway an attractive target for 
novel therapeutics. Leishmania also possesses an organelle glycosome, 
evolutionarily related to peroxisomes of higher eukaryotes, which is essential 
for the survival of the parasite. Research towards therapeutics is underway 
against enzymes from the first two pathways, while the third is as yet 
unexplored.

Chemotherapy has an essential role not only in advanced solid tumor therapy 
intervention but also in society's health at large. Chemoresistance, however, 
seriously restricts the efficiency and sensitivity of chemotherapeutic agents, 
representing a significant threat to patients' quality of life and life 
expectancy. How to reverse chemoresistance, improve efficacy sensitization 
response, and reduce adverse side effects need to be tackled urgently. Recently, 
studies on the effect of ultrasonic microbubble cavitation on enhanced tissue 
permeability and retention (EPR) have attracted the attention of researchers. 
Compared with the traditional targeted drug delivery regimen, the microbubble 
cavitation effect, which can be used to enhance the EPR effect, has the 
advantages of less trauma, low cost, and good sensitization effect, and has 
significant application prospects. This article reviews the research progress of 
ultrasound-mediated microbubble cavitation in the treatment of solid tumors and 
discusses its mechanism of action to provide new ideas for better treatment 
strategies.

Background. With the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLHIV) rapidly 
approaching that of the general population, cardiovascular health in this group 
is as relevant as ever. Adenovirus 36 (Adv36) is one of the few viruses 
suspected to be a causative factor in promoting obesity in humans, yet there is 
a lack of data on this infection in PLHIV. Methods. PLHIV on stable suppressive 
antiretroviral therapy were included in the study, with assessment of 
anthropometric measures, blood pressure, serum lipid levels, fasting serum 
glucose and insulin, non-classical serum cardiovascular risk markers related to 
inflammation (hsCRP, resistin, calprotectin), and anti-Adv36 antibodies during a 
routine check-up. Results. 91 participants were recruited, of which 26.4% were 
Adv36-seropositive (Adv36(+)). Compared to Adv36-seronegative (Adv36(−)) 
controls, Adv36(+) individuals had a lower waist circumference (Adv36(+) 89.6 ± 
7.7 cm, Adv36(−) 95.5 ± 11.7 cm, p = 0.024) and a lower waist-to-hip ratio 
(Adv36(+) 0.88 ± 0.06, Adv36(−) 0.92 ± 0.09, p = 0.014), but this did not reach 
statistical significance in the multivariate analysis (p > 0.05). Adv36(+) 
participants were less likely to be on lipid-lowering treatment (Adv36(+) 12.5%, 
Adv36(−) 34.3%, p = 0.042), even after adjustment for relevant baseline 
characteristics (OR = 0.23, 95%CI = 0.04−0.91), but no differences in 
cholesterol or triglyceride levels were found. No other statistically 
significant associations were observed. Conclusions. We found no evidence to 
support the claim that past Adv36-infection is associated with an increased 
prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors or with elevated inflammatory markers 
in PLHIV. More research is needed to replicate these findings in other samples 
of PLHIV and to compare them with the HIV-negative population.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this scoping review is to map the available evidence about 
the use of health technology assessment (HTA) in the assessment of whole genome 
sequencing (WGS).
METHODS: A scoping review methodology was adopted. The population, concept, and 
context framework was used to build up the research question and to establish 
the eligibility criteria. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews was adopted to implement a 
comprehensive search strategy. Evidence was retrieved from scientific databases 
and HTA organizations Web sites. Reports were classified as full HTA, mini-HTA, 
rapid reviews or other.
RESULTS: The search strategy identified seven reports. Five HTA organizations 
from five countries elaborated the reports: one full HTA, four rapid reviews, 
and two classified as others. The reports were mainly focused on the evaluation 
of the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of genome-wide sequencing as well 
as informing policy questions by providing analyses of organizational and 
ethical considerations.
CONCLUSIONS: Few HTA organizations are drafting reports for WGS. It is essential 
to stimulate a critical reflection during the elaboration of HTA reports for WGS 
to steer choices of decision makers in the establishment of priorities for 
research and policy and reimbursement rates.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) in 
patients treated by hemodialysis (HD) impairs quality of life (QoL). 
Difelikefalin, a selective κ-opioid receptor agonist, decreased the intensity of 
CKD-aP in patients undergoing HD. This pooled analysis evaluated difelikefalin's 
efficacy and the itch-related QoL overall and in subgroups defined by 
demographics or disease characteristics.
STUDY DESIGN: In KALM-1 and KALM-2, participants were randomized (1:1) to 
receive intravenous difelikefalin or placebo 3 times/wk for 12 weeks, followed 
by a 52-week open-label extension.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Adults with moderate to severe CKD-aP treated by HD in 
North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.
INTERVENTION: Intravenous difelikefalin at 0.5 mcg/kg or placebo.
OUTCOMES: Itch intensity (Worst Itching Intensity Numerical Rating Scale 
[WI-NRS]) and itch-related QoL (Skindex-10 and 5-D Itch questionnaires).
RESULTS: 851 participants were randomized (difelikefalin, n = 426; placebo, n = 
425). This pooled analysis demonstrated early     (week 1), sustained 
difelikefalin efficacy, with significantly greater achievement of ≥3-point 
WI-NRS reduction with difelikefalin (51.1%) versus placebo (35.2%; P < 0.001). 
Achievement of a ≥4-point WI-NRS reduction was significantly greater with 
difelikefalin (38.7%) versus placebo (23.4%; P < 0.001). Difelikefalin reduced 
itch intensity in subgroups based on age, sex, anti-itch medication use, the 
presence of specific medical conditions, and gabapentin or pregabalin use. More 
participants receiving difelikefalin versus placebo achieved clinically 
meaningful decreases of ≥15 points on the Skindex-10 scale (55.5% vs 40.5%, 
respectively; P < 0.001) and ≥5 points on the 5-D Itch scale (52.1% vs 42.3%, 
respectively; P = 0.01), with sustained 5-D Itch effects up to 64 weeks.
LIMITATIONS: Subgroup samples were small. The WI-NRS, Skindex-10, and 5-D Itch 
are not used in routine clinical care of dialysis patients; therefore, findings 
may not reflect the real-world effectiveness of difelikefalin.
CONCLUSIONS: Difelikefalin demonstrated rapid, sustained efficacy, with 
consistent results in diverse populations of patients treated by HD.

How to successfully administer palliative treatment with a stent for malignant 
gastric outlet obstruction?

Maetani I(1).

Toho University Ohashi Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.

Although endoscopic stenting (ES) has been widely used as a less-invasive 
palliation method for malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO), recent reports 
have highlighted issues related to the procedure. For successful treatment, 
various aspects must be assessed before considering the practices. First, it is 
necessary to eliminate cases with contraindications such as coexistence of 
distal small-bowel obstruction or perforation. Other factors potentially related 
to clinical failure (i.e., peritoneal carcinomatosis) may require consideration 
but remain controversial. ES has better short-term outcomes than surgical 
gastrojejunostomy (GJ). GJ has recently been considered preferable in cases with 
longer life expectancy because of superior sustainability. Various types of 
stents are now commercially available, but their ideal structure and mechanical 
properties have not yet been clarified. Covered metal stent may reduce stent 
obstruction but is prone to increase stent migration, and its significance 
remains uncertain. Subsequent chemotherapy after stenting should be considered, 
as it is expected to prolong patient survival without increasing the risk of 
adverse events. Furthermore, it may be helpful in preventing tumor ingrowth. In 
cases with GOO combined with biliary obstruction, biliary intervention is often 
difficult. Recently, endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) has 
been widely used as an alternative procedure for endoscopic transpapillary 
biliary drainage (ETBD). Despite the lack of consensus as to whether ETBD or 
EUS-BD is preferred, EUS-BD is useful as a salvage technique for cases where 
ETBD is difficult. To perform stent placement successfully, it is important to 
pay attention to the above points; however, many remaining issues need to be 
clarified in the future.

Commissural alignment in transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A literature 
review.

Khalid AM(1), O'Sullivan CJ(1).

Author information:
(1)College of Medicine and Health, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.

INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a minimally 
invasive procedure to replace a diseased and faulty aortic valve in patients 
with severe aortic stenosis. As TAVR gains popularity among lower-risk younger 
patients with a longer life expectancy; there is a need to investigate the 
long-term shortcomings and limitations of the procedure for this patient group. 
One such shortcoming is that commissural alignment of transcatheter heart valves 
(THV) appears to be random; meaning that the THV neo-commissures can misalign 
with the native commissures of the aortic valve during deployment or 
self-expansion.
OBJECTIVES: Identify techniques and procedures used to obtain commissural 
alignment in TAVR. Evaluate the effectiveness of these procedures in terms of 
the degree of commissural alignment. Analyse the impact of commissural alignment 
on coronary filling and re-access.
METHODS: Two electronic online databases were searched to identify existing 
literature relevant to the aim and objectives of this review: EBSCOhost and 
PubMed. After search filters were applied and duplicates removed; a total of 64 
articles from both databases were screened against the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. This resulted in a total of thirteen articles which met the objectives 
of this review and thus; were included.
RESULTS: All studies focused on a patient centered approach involving pre-TAVR 
computed tomography to obtain commissural alignment. Other studies modified this 
approach and combined techniques. All studies that implemented a technique to 
reduce commissural misalignment were significantly successful in obtaining 
commissural alignment when compared to a study in which alignment was random 
when no technique was implemented. Severe coronary overlapping in commissural 
aligned heart valves was relatively low compared to severe coronary overlapping 
when no technique was implemented.
CONCLUSIONS: An increase in optimal commissural alignment via introduction of an 
alignment technique may seem attractive; however; the categorization of 
commissural alignment is arbitrary and does not accurately reflect real life 
clinical implications. Further research is needed to determine whether a routine 
procedure to achieve commissural alignment is necessary in low-risk younger 
patients undergoing TAVR.

BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is uncommon in most areas of the 
world but poses a significant public health burden in endemic regions.
OBJECTIVES: We provide an overview of the most recent global epidemiology of 
nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC).
METHODS: We estimated the burden of NPC in 204 countries and territories by age, 
sex, and Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: At the GBD regional level, the most severe age-standardized incidence 
in 2019 occurred in East Asia. From 1990 to 2019, the East Asia and High-income 
Asia Pacific had the greatest increase in percentage in age-standardized 
incidence. Central Asia and the Caribbean had the greatest increase in 
percentage in age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) and death 
rates. At the national level, Cabo Verde, Romania, and the Cyprus reported the 
largest percentage increases in the age-standardized incidence. Cabo Verde, 
Romania, and Jamaica reported the largest increases in the age-standardized DALY 
and death rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The global age-standardized incidence of NPC increased globally 
between 1990 and 2019, especially in the East Asia.

TYÖTERVEYSLAITOS, Finland. elli.hartikainen@ttl.fi.

OBJECTIVES: The use of part-time sickness absence (pSA) instead of full-time 
sickness absence (fSA) is known to increase work participation. Yet, its effect 
on the total length of working lives remains unclear. We carried out a 
quasi-experiment to assess the impact of using pSA versus fSA on the length of 
working lives.
METHODS: We used a register-based 70% random sample of the working-age 
population living in Finland on 31 December 2007 to (i) form 
propensity-score-matched groups of users of pSA and fSA and (ii) calculate their 
working life expectancy (WLE) and working years lost (WYL). We applied the 
Sullivan method based on daily measured time spent at work and other labor 
market statuses, followed up over a four-year period until the end of year 2017. 
The study population consisted of private and public sector employees with SA 
due to mental and musculoskeletal disorders, ie, the diagnostic groups where pSA 
has been primarily used.
RESULTS: Among both genders, the pSA group had a significantly higher WLE at age 
30 than the fSA group, with larger differences seen in mental disorders compared 
to musculoskeletal diseases and in the private versus public sector. Overall, 
the pSA group had fewer WYL due to unemployment and disability retirement but 
more expected years working with partial disability benefits than the fSA group.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on beneficial working career effects, the use of pSA instead 
of fSA should always be recommended for persons with mental or musculoskeletal 
disorders where feasible.

Gains in Quality of Life in Chronic Otitis Media Patients After Surgery, 
Adjusted for Placebo Bias.

OBJECTIVE: Using a short-form specific questionnaire, we sought to quantify 
specific and generic benefits of surgery for chronic otitis media (COM) while 
adjusting for expectancy (placebo) bias.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective observational pretreatment/posttreatment study.
SETTING: A national tertiary referral center.
PATIENTS: Consecutive adult COM patients were enrolled for 1 year. Of 246 
patients, 205 were recommended for surgery, and 167 were operated on the (more) 
affected ear.
INTERVENTIONS: All patients filled out two questionnaires, one specific (Chronic 
Otitis Media Questionaire-12) and one generic (Short Form-36) at baseline, and 
then again 6 and 12 months after surgery.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Factor-based scores of questionnaires, standardized 
response means (SRMs) for treatment effects, with multiple linear regression for 
implementing bias adjustment.
RESULTS: All but one (generic Short Form-36 "mental" scale) of the seven 
considered measures gave very highly significant ( p < 0.001) improvements. 
Unadjusted SRMs were large (1.0-2.0 standard deviation units) for audiometry, 
symptoms of ear discharge, reported hearing, and aggregate specific quality of 
life, but only moderate for the less specific activity/healthcare. The proposed 
bias adjustment reduced SRM magnitudes for most measures by about a third, for 
activity/healthcare and ear discharge by only a tenth to a fifth, and for 
audiometry not at all.
CONCLUSION: Most scores of the specific questionnaire displayed definite 
placebo-like biases; this demands caution in interpreting improvement after COM 
surgery. With bias adjustments, credible and worthwhile magnitudes of 
improvements remained for Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire-12 total and

Ontario, Canada (Athwal).

The increased utilization of shoulder arthroplasty, including revision 
procedures, combined with rises in life expectancy, is expected to translate 
into a substantial increase in periprosthetic humeral fractures. The evaluation 
and management of these fractures needs to be updated to consider fractures that 
complicate anatomic and reverse arthroplasties and contemporary short-stem and 
stemless implants. Although conservative treatment is successful in a large 
proportion of these fractures, several surgical reconstructive techniques are 
required for the management of all fracture types. Surgical options include 
internal fixation, graft augmentation, standard revision procedures, and 
occasionally complex reconstructions including modular segmental prosthesis and 
allograft prosthetic composites. Most studies on the outcomes of periprosthetic 
humeral fractures have analyzed small samples and have typically reported on 
anatomic total shoulders with a standard-length humeral implant. Additional 
research is required to optimize the management of periprosthetic postoperative 
humeral fractures in the era of reverse arthroplasty, short stems, and stemless 
arthroplasty.

BACKGROUND: The Ross procedure is not commonly performed, owing to the 
procedural complexity and the risk of autograft and/or homograft reoperation. 
This study examined outcomes of patients undergoing Ross reinterventions at a 
dedicated Ross center.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 225 consecutive patients who underwent a 
Ross procedure between 1994 and 2019. Index and redo operation characteristics 
and outcomes were compared between patients with and those without redo 
operations. Multivariate analysis was used to identify independent predictors of 
Ross-related reinterventions. Survival was estimated with Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (29.3%) required redo Ross surgery, 41 patients 
(18.2%) underwent autograft reoperation only, 8 patients (3.6%) had a homograft 
reintervention, and 17 patients (7.6%) had both autograft and homograft 
reoperations (12 as a combined procedure and 5 as sequential procedures). The 
mean time to reintervention was 11 ± 6 years for autograft reoperations and 
12 ± 7 years for homograft reoperations. Patients who underwent Ross-related 
reinterventions were younger (mean, 38 ± 11 years vs 43 ± 11 years; P < .01) and 
had a higher rate of New York Heart Association class III/IV (56% vs 38%; 
P = .02) at the index Ross procedure. Most patients undergoing autograft 
reintervention had aortic insufficiency and/or aneurysm (98.2%; 57 of 58). The 
primary reason for homograft reintervention was pulmonary stenosis (92%; 23 of 
25). The operative mortality of Ross reintervention was 1.5% (1 of 66). Survival 
at 15 years was similar in patients who required a redo operation and those who 
did not (91.2% vs 93.9%; P = .23).
CONCLUSIONS: Ross reinterventions can be performed safely and maintain patients 
at the normal life expectancy restored by the index Ross procedure up to 
15 years at experienced centers.

Propolis, a resinous substance produced by honeybees from various plant sources, 
has been used for thousands of years in traditional medicine for several 
purposes all over the world. The precise composition of propolis varies 
according to plant source, seasons harvesting, geography, type of bee flora, 
climate changes, and honeybee species at the site of collection. This apiary 
product has broad clinical applications such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
antimicrobial, anticancer, analgesic, antidepressant, and anxiolytic as well 
asimmunomodulatory effects. It is also well known from traditional uses in 
treating purulent disorders, improving the wound healing, and alleviating many 
of the related discomforts. Even if its use was already widespread since ancient 
times, after the First and Second World War, it has grown even more as well as 
the studies to identify its chemical and pharmacological features, allowing to 
discriminate the qualities of propolis in terms of the chemical profile and 
relative biological activity based on the geographic place of origin. Recently, 
several in vitro and in vivo studies have been carried out and new insights into 
the pharmaceutical prospects of this bee product in the management of different 
disorders, have been highlighted. Specifically, the available literature 
confirms the efficacy of propolis and its bioactive compounds in the reduction 
of cancer progression, inhibition of bacterial and viral infections as well as 
mitigation of parasitic-related symptoms, paving the way to the use of propolis 
as an alternative approach to improve the human health. However, a more 
conscious use of propolis in terms of standardized extracts as well as new 
clinical studies are needed to substantiate these health claims.

BACKGROUND: For many cell types, directional locomotion depends on their 
maintaining filopodia at the leading edge. Filopodia lack any Ca2+-binding 
structural protein but respond to store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE).
METHODS: SOCE was induced by first replacing the medium with Ca2+-free salt 
solution with cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). This lowers Ca2+ in the ER and causes 
stromal interacting molecule (STIM) to be translocated to the cell surface. 
After this priming step, CPA was washed out, and Ca2+ influx restored by 
addition of extracellular Ca2+. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were measured by 
calcium orange fluorescence. Regulatory mechanisms were identified by 
pharmacological treatments. Proteins mediating SOCE were localized by 
immunofluorescence and analyzed after image processing.
RESULTS: Depletion of the ER Ca2+ increased filopodia prevalence briefly, 
followed by a spontaneous decline that was blocked by inhibitors of endocytosis. 
Intracellular Ca2+ increased continuously for ~ 50 min. STIM and a transient 
receptor potential canonical (TRPC) protein were found in separate compartments, 
but an aquaporin unrelated to SOCE was present in both. STIM1- and TRPC1-bearing 
vesicles were trafficked on microtubules. During depletion, STIM1 migrated to 
the surface where it coincided with Orai in punctae, as expected. TRPC1 was 
partially colocalized with Vamp2, a rapidly releasable pool marker, and with 
phospholipases (PLCs). TRPC1 retreated to internal compartments during ER 
depletion. Replenishment of extracellular Ca2+ altered the STIM1 distribution, 
which came to resemble that of untreated cells. Vamp2 and TRPC1 underwent 
exocytosis and became homogeneously distributed on the cell surface. This was 
accompanied by an increased prevalence of filopodia, which was blocked by 
inhibitors of TRPC1/4/5 and endocytosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Because the media were devoid of ligands that activate receptors 
during depletion and Ca2+ replenishment, we could attribute filopodia extension 
to SOCE. We propose that the Orai current stimulates exocytosis of TRPC-bearing 
vesicles, and that Ca2+ influx through TRPC inhibits PLC activity. This allows 
regeneration of the substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2), a 
platform for assembling proteins, e. g. Enabled and IRSp53. TRPC contact with 
PLC is required but is broken by TRPC dissemination. This explains how STIM1 
regulates the cell's ability to orient itself in response to attractive or 
repulsive cues. Video Abstract.

AIMS: A recent trial has shown that screening of men for cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) may reduce all-cause mortality. This study assesses the cost effectiveness 
of such screening vs. no screening from the perspective of European healthcare 
systems.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Randomized controlled trial-based cost-effectiveness 
evaluation with a mean 5.7 years of follow-up. Screening was based on low-dose 
computed tomography to detect coronary artery calcification and aortic/iliac 
aneurysms, limb blood pressure measurement to detect peripheral artery disease 
and hypertension, telemetric assessment of the heart rhythm to detect atrial 
fibrillation, and measurements of the cholesterol and HgbA1c levels. 
Censoring-adjusted incremental costs, life years (LY), and quality-adjusted LY 
(QALY) were estimated and used for cost-effectiveness analysis. The incremental 
cost of screening for the entire health care sector was €207 [95% confidence 
interval (CI) -24; 438, P = 0.078] per invitee for which gains of 0.019 LY (95% 
CI -0.007; 0.045, P = 0.145) and 0.023 QALY (95% CI -0.001; 0.046, P = 0.051) 
were achieved. The corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were of 
€10 812 per LY and €9075 per QALY, which would be cost effective at 
probabilities of 0.73 and 0.83 for a willingness to pay of €20 000. Assessment 
of population heterogeneity showed that cost effectiveness could be more 
attractive for younger men without CVD at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive screening for CVD is overall cost effective at 
conventional thresholds for willingness to pay and also competitive to the cost 
effectiveness of common cancer screening programmes. The screening target group, 
however, needs to be settled.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the years of life gained when meeting the sleep duration 
recommendations across the adult lifespan.
METHODS: Three pieces of information were used to estimate and compare life 
expectancy at each age of adult life among Canadian adults who did and did not 
meet sleep duration recommendations: (i) the prevalence of self-reported short 
sleep duration, recommended sleep duration, and long sleep duration; (ii) the 
relative risks of all-cause mortality associated with sleep duration obtained 
from recent meta-analyses; and (iii) the probability of death during each year 
of life obtained from life tables.
RESULTS: Adults who meet the sleep duration recommendations have an estimated 
life expectancy at age 20 years that is 1.2 years longer than short sleepers and 
2.6 years longer than long sleepers. Differences between men and women were 
minimal.
CONCLUSION: Meeting sleep duration recommendations is associated with increases 
in longevity in Canada.

OBJECTIVE: Although the predictors of long-term prognosis after endovascular 
aneurysm repair (EVAR) have been investigated, several reports have suggested 
that early sac shrinkage (ESS) is associated with superior long-term prognosis. 
However, it was not clear whether ESS was associated with aneurysm-related 
mortality. The aim of this study was to define fatal adverse events and to 
examine their association with ESS.
METHODS: All consecutive patients who underwent EVAR for an abdominal aortic 
aneurysm at Nagoya University Hospital between June 2007 and August 2018 were 
identified. We defined ESS as an aneurysm diameter decrease of 10 mm or more at 
1 year after EVAR, and we defined fatal adverse events as aneurysm-related 
death, aneurysm sac rupture, open conversion, secondary type Ia endoleak, or 
secondary type IIIa/b endoleak. Then, we evaluated the association between ESS 
and fatal adverse events and identified predictors of ESS.
RESULTS: During the study period, 553 patients were identified and included. 
Fatal adverse events occurred in 42 patients (7.6%), and the details of the 
fatal adverse events were as follows: 13 aneurysm-related deaths, 17 aneurysm 
sac ruptures, 14 open conversions, 13 type Ia endoleaks, and 6 type III 
endoleaks. ESS occurred in 146 patients (26.4%). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that 
the ESS group had a significantly lower incidence of fatal adverse events (P < 
.001). Multivariate analysis showed that there were significant differences in 
terms of 5 or more preoperatively patent lumbar arteries (odds ratio [OR], 0.67; 
P = .049; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-1.00), chronic kidney disease (OR, 
0.49; P < .01; 95% CI, 0.29-0.84), and Zenith endograft use (OR, 1.76; P < .01; 
95% CI, 1.16-2.67). Furthermore, the percentage of cases that achieved an 
aneurysm diameter of less than 40 mm was significantly higher in the ESS group 
(76.0% vs 15.5%; P < .01). The use of Zenith endografts showed a significantly 
higher rate of aneurysm disappearance than the use of Endurant endografts (P < 
.01) and Excluder endografts (P < .01). In addition, it was found that ESS was 
more likely to occur with the use of Zenith endografts, even when propensity 
score matching was performed for the neck morphology.
CONCLUSIONS: ESS was associated with a lower rate of life-threatening adverse 
events after EVAR. The use of Zenith endografts was a predictor of ESS and was 
associated with increased rates of long-term sac shrinkage and aneurysm 
disappearance compared with the Endurant and Excluder endografts. Using the 
predictors of ESS identified in this study, we may be able to expand the 
indications for EVAR to patients with a longer life expectancy.
