we demonstrated the acceptability of CBT-i in the treatment of insomnia comorbid 
to PD and its effectiveness for the management of noctural and diurnal symptoms 
of insomnia associated with this neurological condition. The objective of this 
paper is to raise awareness among health professionals of the relevance of 
psychological therapies (mostly CBT) for insomnia in PD. Unlike drug treatments, 
these therapies are safe for patients who are already weakened by PD itself.

Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni a non-caloric, safe and natural sweetener has been 
shown pharmaceutically important in the management of blood disorders. This 
study was designed to investigate hematology and safety of stevia aqueous 
extract through animal modeling. For this purpose, fifty albino rats were 
categorized into 5 groups and all the groups were received aqueous stevia 
extract at different dosage levels (200, 300, 400 and 500 ppm/kg b. wt) for 8 
weeks except control group. Hematological and toxicological analyses were 
conducted using standard recommended procedures. The results indicated that 
biochemical parameters (RBC, HB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, WBC, eosinophils, 
lymphocytes and neutrophils) of albino rats significantly (P<0.05) increased and 
PLT, MPV and monocytes levels non-significantly decreased by using aqueous 
extract of stevia at different levels after eight weeks of study. Furthermore, 
Stevia aqueous extracts had non-toxic effect on liver functioning tests. 
However, stevia aqueous extracts were insignificant in their impression 
regarding organ to body weight ratios. The stevia aqueous extract has positive 
effect on hematological parameters of albino rats and is toxicologically safe. 
Therefore it could be used as a natural remedy for the management of 
hematological disorders without any health hazards.

INTRODUCTION: Craniofacial trauma may potentially have significant blood loss 
which may lead to death in some trauma patients.
CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 43-year-old male who had a lethal 
noncompressible arterial hemorrhage from a penetrating wound on his left 
frontotemporal and preauricular region. Extensive bleeding was successfully 
temporarily controlled by external carotid artery (ECA) occlusion. The 
definitive operation was completed in a staged fashion following a computed 
tomography angiography assessment extension of the injury.
CONCLUSION: Temporarily controlling the bleeding from the carotid artery should 
be considered as a life saving procedure in a lethal craniofacial injury.

Are Older Persons in China Living More Years in an Independent Living 
Arrangement? Estimates Using Multistate Life Tables.

Adopting a multistate life table approach, this study estimates number of years 
the very old in China expect to live in an independent living arrangement (alone 
or with spouse only)-an estimate we term "independent living life expectancy" 
(ILLE)-as opposed to in coresidence with adult children or others. We also 
estimate how ILLE and proportion of total life expectancy (TLE) residing 
independently has changed over time. The backdrop for this study is a society 
experiencing both increasing longevity and social changes that influence the 
tendency to live in an independent living arrangement. The study concentrates on 
assessing whether changes in ILLE match or surpass gains in TLE experienced by 
oldest-old Chinese adults. Data are from the 2002-2014 Chinese Longitudinal 
Healthy Longevity Survey, and estimation is conducted using the Stochastic 
Population Analysis for Complex Events software. Results suggest that on 
balance, gains in ILLE are proportionately greater than gains in TLE, indicating 
an expansion of ILLE for most Chinese elders. Males, septuagenarian females, and 
disabled septuagenarians are the most likely to be living proportionately longer 
lives in an independent living arrangement. In contrast, extremely old 
(nonagenarian and centenarian) females and extremely old disabled individuals 
are least likely to have experienced dramatic changes in proportion of life 
residing independently. The findings imply some support for the hypothesis that 
given the maintenance of family solidarity in China, those in greatest need are 
least likely to encounter the most extreme changes toward independent living 
arrangements.

When did mortality first start to decline, and among whom? We build a large, new 
data set with more than 30,000 scholars covering the sixteenth to the early 
twentieth century to analyze the timing of the mortality decline and the 
heterogeneity in life expectancy gains among scholars in the Holy Roman Empire. 
The large sample size, well-defined entry into the risk group, and heterogeneity 
in social status are among the key advantages of the new database. After 
recovering from a severe mortality crisis in the seventeenth century, life 
expectancy among scholars started to increase as early as in the eighteenth 
century, well before the Industrial Revolution. Our finding that members of 
scientific academies-an elite group among scholars-were the first to experience 
mortality improvements suggests that 300 years ago, individuals with higher 
social status already enjoyed lower mortality. We also show, however, that the 
onset of mortality improvements among scholars in medicine was delayed, possibly 
because these scholars were exposed to pathogens and did not have germ theory 
knowledge that might have protected them. The disadvantage among medical 
professionals decreased toward the end of the nineteenth century. Our results 
provide a new perspective on the historical timing of mortality improvements, 
and the database accompanying our study facilitates replication and extensions.

BACKGROUND: Dietary risks have raised attention worldwide during recent decades. 
The present burden-of-disease study aimed to evaluate the global dietary risks 
for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) from 1990 to 2019 and quantify their impact 
on mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Data from the 2019 
Global Burden of Disease Study on deaths and DALYs from NCDs attributable to 
worldwide dietary risks were obtained and underwent deep analysis by year, age, 
gender, location, leading risks and leading causes, and their associations were 
examined. The socio-demographic index (SDI) was used as an indicator of national 
socio-economic status, as well as the relationships between age-standardised 
rates of deaths or DALYs and socio-economic status.
RESULTS: In 2019, 7.9 million deaths and 187.7 million DALYs were attributable 
to dietary risk factors. High intake of sodium and low intake of whole grains 
and fruits were leading dietary risks for deaths and DALYs worldwide. However, 
both indices showed a decreasing trend by year, an increase by age and a higher 
disease burden in males. The main distribution of dietary-related NCDs was 
located in highly populated countries. A negative association between the SDI 
and disease burden and a positive association between the SDI and male 
preponderance were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Dietary risk factors for NCDs increased significantly and varied 
across regions during 1990-2019. Therefore, greater efforts are needed to raise 
public awareness of interventions and improve dietary practices aiming to reduce 
the disease burden caused by suboptimal dietary intake, especially in developing 
countries and among males.

BACKGROUND: Pelvic vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare complication of pregnancy 
that can lead to life-threatening complications, such as pulmonary embolism 
(PE).
OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics of PVT and its treatment in pregnancy in 
the province of Quebec, Canada.
PATIENTS/METHODS: We developed a province-wide case series of PVT in pregnancy 
including four tertiary care centers and the Registry of Rare Diseases of the 
Groupe d'Étude en Médecine Obstétricale du Québec. Using diagnostic codes, we 
included cases with confirmed PVT on imaging during pregnancy or within 6 weeks 
postpartum from July 2003 to June 2018.
RESULTS: A total of 47 cases were identified. PVT diagnosis was generally made 
in the early postpartum period (median of 9 [interquartile range (IQR) 4.5-12] 
days postpartum). Most PVT (94%) included in this series were symptomatic. Women 
presented primarily with abdominal pain (77%) and fever (55%), often prolonged 
despite antibiotics (mean 4.45 ± 2.39 days, with 39% having fever for more than 
5 days). The most common risk factor was surgery (57%) and peripartum infections 
(54%). Thirty-eight (83%) women received antibiotics and 41 (89%) were 
anticoagulated. Three cases of PE (7%) occurred concomitantly, 11% of women 
required intensive care, and 19% had inferior vena cava (IVC) clot extension. 
The episode resulted in prolonged hospitalization (median 6 [IQR 3-10.75] days), 
with 48% being hospitalized more than 7 days.
CONCLUSION: Symptomatic PVT has significant clinical implications with prolonged 
fever and risks of extension in the IVC and PE, leading to prolonged 
hospitalization including in the intensive care unit. Therapeutic 
anticoagulation and antibiotics, when infection is documented, should be 
considered for management.

PURPOSE: TEVAR (thoracic endovascular aortic repair) + PETTICOAT (Provisional 
ExTension to Induce COmplete ATtachment) technique has been selectively employed 
since 2005 at our institution during endovascular treatment of type B aortic 
dissection (TBD). The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term (>5 years) 
clinical results and the evolution of aortic volume.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the patients receiving an endovascular treatment for 
TBD with the PETTICOAT technique were collected in a prospectively maintained 
database and follow-up computed tomography scan were retrospectively analyzed. 
Study endpoints included short- and long-term clinical success (absence of need 
for reintervention) and any major adverse event. The volumes of thoracic and 
abdominal aorta at long-term follow-up were also analyzed.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients received a TEVAR + PETTICOAT and were followed up 
(median follow-up 85 months). Primary 30-day clinical success rate was 82% with 
an adverse event rate of 31%; 4 type I endoleak and 1 retrograde dissection were 
recorded. Secondary mid-term clinical success was 96% while the long-term 
clinical success rate was 79%. Six cases (21%) received either an open repair or 
an endovascular repair for a significant distal aortic enlargement at follow-up. 
With regards to volumetric analysis, an increase of overall (thoracic and 
abdominal) aortic volume was observed in 8 cases mainly related to an increase 
(mean: +31%) of the abdominal volume that was observed in 11 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: PETTICOAT technique does not protect from long-term significant 
aneurysmal degeneration that may require aortic open or endovascular 
reinterventions. Aortic growth occurs mainly in the bare-stented aorta and thus, 
life-long surveillance is advisable in these patients.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is cost-effective in many Western 
countries, and many have successfully implemented CRC screening programs. For 
countries with a lower CRC incidence, like Saudi Arabia, the value of CRC 
screening is less evident and requires careful weighing of harms, benefits, and 
costs.
METHODS: We used the MISCAN-Colon microsimulation model to simulate a male and 
female cohort with life expectancy and CRC risk as observed in Saudi Arabia. For 
both cohorts, we evaluated strategies without screening, with annual or biennial 
faecal immunochemical testing (FIT), and with 10-yearly or once-only 
colonoscopy. We also considered different start and end ages of screening. For 
both cohorts, we estimated lifetime costs and effects of each strategy. We then 
identified a set of potentially cost-effective strategies using incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) defined as the additional cost per additional 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY).
RESULTS: Without CRC screening, an estimated 14 per 1,000 males would develop 
CRC during their lifetime and 9 would die from CRC. Several strategies proved 
potentially cost-effective including biennial FIT at ages 55-65 (ICER of 
$7,400), once-only colonoscopy at age 55 (ICER of $7,700), and 10-yearly 
colonoscopy at ages 50-65, 45-65, and 45-75 (ICERs of $34,000, 71,000, and 
375,000, respectively). For females, risk of CRC was lower and CRC screening was 
therefore less cost-effective, but efficient strategies were largely similar.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite low CRC incidence in Saudi Arabia, some FIT or colonoscopy 
screening strategies may meet reasonable thresholds of cost-effectiveness. The 
optimal strategy will depend on multiple factors including the willingness to 
pay per QALY, the colonoscopy capacity, and the accepted budget impact.

OBJECTIVE: Specific survival estimates are needed for the increasing number of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. The aim of this population-based study was to 
determine conditional loss in expectation of life (LEL) due to CRC.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: All surgically treated patients with CRC registered in 
the Netherlands Cancer Registry with stage I-III between 1990-2016, were 
included (N = 203,216). Estimates of conditional LEL were predicted using 
flexible parametric models and the total life years lost due to cancer were 
estimated.
RESULTS: LEL decreased with older age and patients with rectal cancer or higher 
disease stage had highest LEL. In 2010, LEL for sixty-year old male and female 
patients was 2 vs. 2, 4 vs. 4, and 7 vs. 8 years for colon cancer, and 2 vs. 2, 
4 vs. 5 and 7 vs. 8 years for rectal cancer, respectively. Conditional LEL in 
patients with CRC decreased during follow-up. Patients with combined stage I-III 
colon and rectal cancer in 2010 lost an estimated 18,628 and 11,336 life years.
CONCLUSION: This study quantified the impact of CRC on patient's life 
expectancy, both on individual and population level and demonstrated temporal 
improvements in CRC survival. These results provide meaningful information that 
can be used during follow-up.

A 4-y college degree is increasingly the key to good jobs and, ultimately, to 
good lives in an ever-more meritocratic and unequal society. The bachelor's 
degree (BA) is increasingly dividing Americans; the one-third with a BA or more 
live longer and more prosperous lives, while the two-thirds without face rising 
mortality and declining prospects. We construct a time series, from 1990 to 
2018, of a summary of each year's mortality rates and expected years lived from 
25 to 75 at the fixed mortality rates of that year. Our measure excludes those 
over 75 who have done relatively well over the last three decades and focuses on 
the years when deaths rose rapidly through drug overdoses, suicides, and 
alcoholic liver disease and when the decline in mortality from cardiovascular 
disease slowed and reversed. The BA/no-BA gap in our measure widened steadily 
from 1990 to 2018. Beyond 2010, as those with a BA continued to see increases in 
our period measure of expected life, those without saw declines. This is true 
for the population as a whole, for men and for women, and for Black and White 
people. In contrast to growing education gaps, gaps between Black and White 
people diminished but did not vanish. By 2018, intraracial college divides were 
larger than interracial divides conditional on college; by our measure, those 
with a college diploma are more alike one another irrespective of race than they 
are like those of the same race who do not have a BA.

BACKGROUND: Living with undiagnosed symptomatic coeliac disease is connected 
with deteriorated health, and persons with coeliac disease often wait a long 
time for their diagnosis. A mass screening would lower the delay, but its 
cost-effectiveness is still unclear. Our aim was to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of a coeliac disease mass screening at 12 years of age, 
taking a life course perspective on future benefits and drawbacks.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was derived as cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) using a Markov model. As a basis for our assumptions, we mainly 
used information from the Exploring the Iceberg of Celiacs in Sweden (ETICS) 
study, a school-based screening conducted in 2005/2006 and 2009/2010, where 
13,279 12-year-old children participated and 240 were diagnosed with coeliac 
disease, and a study involving members of the Swedish Coeliac Association with 
1031 adult participants.
RESULTS: The cost for coeliac disease screening was 40,105 Euro per gained QALY. 
Sensitivity analyses support screening based on high compliance to a gluten-free 
diet, rapid progression from symptom-free coeliac disease to coeliac disease 
with symptoms, long delay from celiac disease with symptoms to diagnosis, and a 
low QALY score for undiagnosed coeliac disease cases.
CONCLUSIONS: A coeliac disease mass screening is cost-effective based on the 
commonly used threshold of 50,000 Euro per gained QALY. However, this is based 
on many assumptions, especially regarding the natural history of coeliac disease 
and the effects on long-term health for individuals with coeliac disease still 
eating gluten.

BACKGROUND: Cystic Fibrosis newborn screening (CFNBS) is the optimal method to 
diagnose the disease during the asymptomatic period. The aim of the study was to 
determine how CFNBS affects long term clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Data from infants who were born in Lodz Voivodship, referred to CF 
center as a part of CFNBS according to IRT/DNA protocol were compared to the 
data of children with established CF diagnosis before the start of NBS in Poland 
(Group CF, n = 52).
RESULTS: In 37 children (during 151 referred infants) the diagnosis of CF was 
established due to CF NBS (CF NBS Group, n = 37). The average time of diagnosis 
was 1.59 month in Group CF NBS and 45.25 months in 52 children from Group CF. 
Pulmonary exacerbations occurred on average 4.2 times in Group CFNBS and they 
were hospitalized on average 0.5 times compared to Group CF - respectively 6.77 
and 2.14 (p < 0.001). The number of PA infected patients increased between the 
fifth and eighth year of age (OR = 1.16 (95% CI: 1.04-19) (P = 0.007)) 
regardless of the study group (P = 0.984). Patients with MRSA infection have a 
higher risk of PA infections in subsequent years of their life (OR = 1.45 (95% 
CI: 1.03-2.03) (P = 0.032)).
CONCLUSIONS: CF NBS has beneficial effects primarily on decrease of pulmonary 
withhope for a longer life expectancy and better and centralised treatment in 
multidisciplinary CF focused centres.

Tay-Sachs disease, or GM2 gangliosidosis, is a congenital and neurodegenerative 
disease caused by the absence or deficiency of the essential enzyme 
B-hexosaminidase. The timing of the development of neurological manifestations 
and their severity depend on the mutation, time since disease onset and the 
patient's characteristics. The disease impairs quality of life and increases 
mortality. In the most aggressive forms, life expectancy is 3 years. Despite 
various clinical trials and ongoing research, there is currently no cure for 
Tay-Sachs disease. Treatment focuses on symptom control and ensuring greater 
patient wellbeing. Consequently, rehabilitation plays a fundamental role in the 
management of these patients and in enhancing their quality of life.

Environmental factors can induce detrimental consequences into adulthood life. 
In this study, we examined the epigenetic effects induced by in utero 
chlordecone (CD) exposure on human male cord blood as well as in blood-derived 
Ke-37 cell line. Genome-wide analysis of histone H3K4me3 distribution revealed 
that genes related to chromosome segregation, chromatin organization, and cell 
cycle have altered occupancy in their promoters. The affected regions were 
enriched in ESR1, SP family, and IKZF1 binding motifs. We also observed a global 
reduction in H3K9me3, markedly in repeated sequences of the genome. Decrease in 
H3K9me3 after CD exposure correlates with decreased methylation in LINE-1 
promoters and telomere length extension. These observations on human cord blood 
were assessed in the Ke-37 human cell line. H3K4me3 and the expression of genes 
related to immune response, DNA repair, and chromatin organization, which were 
affected in human cord blood were also altered in CD-exposed Ke-37 cells. Our 
data suggest that developmental exposure to CD leads to profound changes in 
histone modification patterns and affects the processes controlled by them in 
human cord blood.

Life expectancy, and longevity have been increasing in recent years. However, 
this is, in most cases, accompanied by age-related diseases. Thus, it became 
essential to better understand the mechanisms inherent to aging, and to 
establish biomarkers that characterize this physiological process. Among all 
biomolecules, lipids appear to be a good target for the study of these 
biomarkers. In fact, some lipids have already been associated with age-related 
diseases. With the development of analytical techniques such as Mass 
Spectrometry, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Lipidomics has been increasingly 
used to study pathological, and physiological states of an organism. Thus, the 
study of serum, and plasma lipidome in centenarians, and elderly individuals 
without age-related diseases can be a useful tool for the identification of 
aging biomarkers, and to understand physiological aging, and longevity. This 
review focus on the importance of lipids as biomarkers of aging, and summarize 
the changes in the lipidome that have been associated with aging, and longevity.

PURPOSE: We assessed the validity of the EQ-5D instrument; explored correlations 
between area of residence's conflict intensity and individual health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL); and identified factors associated with HRQoL in a 
conflict-affected population in Colombia.
METHODS: We conducted a household survey among residents of the Meta province, 
collecting longitudinal information about HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L instrument), health, 
demographic and socio-economic indicators, for years 2014 (pre-2016 peace 
accord), 2018 (post-peace accord) and 2019 (follow-up). After examining EQ-5D's 
validity, we analysed panel data using multivariate random effects models to 
explore associations between area conflict levels (and other factors) and HRQoL. 
We scrutinised these results further through multivariate linear regressions 
using cross-sectional data, and provided preliminary estimates of 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained since the Colombian peace accord.
RESULTS: In total, 1309 individuals provided information for years 2014 and 
2018; 1106 individuals were followed-up in 2019. Mean EQ-5D scores in 2014, 2018 
and 2019 were 0.898, 0.846 and 0.902, respectively. The tests confirmed the 
validity of EQ-5D. Our estimations indicated a dose-response relationship 
between conflict levels and HRQoL: people in lightly and heavily affected areas 
had 0.019 and 0.037 lower EQ-5D scores (respectively) than people in 
non-affected areas. Other relevant factors included age, marital status, 
education, assets and health status. We estimated QALY gain of 0.0343 per 
individual and 20,752 for all Meta adults since the peace accord.
CONCLUSION: We found EQ-5D to be a valid instrument for HRQoL measurement in a 
conflict-affected population. Area conflict intensity was negatively associated 
with individual HRQoL.

INTRODUCTION: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib for patients 
with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who failed conventional 
synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs from the Chinese healthcare 
system perspective.
METHODS: An individual patient simulation model was used to estimate the 
lifetime cost and effectiveness. The comparator sequence commenced with 
etanercept, followed by rituximab-tocilizumab- non-biologic therapy. The 
intervention sequences were assumed to add tofacitinib to different positions in 
the comparator sequence. Quality-of-life estimates were generated by mapping 
Health Assessment Questionnaire scores to utility with the algorithm derived 
from a Chinese population. Scenario analyses, univariable and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the model uncertainty.
RESULTS: Compared with the comparator sequence, patients receiving tofacitinib 
as the first-, second-, third- and fourth-line treatment gained additional 0.49, 
0.59, 0.44 and 0.53 QALYs, respectively, and the use of tofacitinib as the 
first- and second-line treatment was less costly, whereas the use of tofacitinib 
as the third- and fourth-line treatment cost an additional $234,998 and 
$381,116, respectively. This produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$333.73 and $9669.34/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Tofacitinib is estimated to be dominant in both the first- and 
second-line settings and to be highly cost-effective in both the third- and 
fourth-line settings.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate automatic and voluntary motor 
control performances, which have an important function in maintaining balance, 
in children and adolescents with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS).
METHODS: The records of 70 patients were retrospectively analyzed. The results 
of Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP) performed according to the age and 
development of the individuals were examined. The results of 10 children and 
adolescents with MPS (mean age: 9.43 ranging from 6 to 14; four males and six 
females) who completed the sensory analysis, Weight-Bearing Squat Test, and 
Adaptation Test were retrieved from the database of the CDP. Nine healthy 
children and adolescents with typical development (mean age: 9.63 ranging from 6 
to 14; four males and five females) were included as the control group.
RESULTS: In the sensory analysis test, there was a statistically significant 
difference between the two groups in the visual ratio parameter. In the 
adaptation test, there was a statistically significant difference between the 
two groups in the toes up and toes down trials. There was no statistically 
significant difference between the groups in the Weight-Bearing Squat test at 0° 
knee extension and various knee flexions.
CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with MPS should be directed to the 
appropriate exercise and therapy programs to develop postural and balance 
control, which have a significant effect on their quality of life and the 
ability to independently perform daily activities of living. In addition to 
routine hearing assessments for patients with MPS, other objective tests used in 
the differential diagnosis of balance and vestibular system should also be 
implemented.

INTRODUCTION: Lolland-Falster is a rural area in south-eastern Denmark that 
scores unfavourable in health surveys and has the lowest life expectancy in the 
country. To determine the origin of poor health in Lolland-Falster, we 
investigated impact on mortality of long-term population movements.
METHODS: We used data from the Danish Central Population Register 1968-2017 to 
track movements in and out of Lolland-Falster. This enabled us to calculate 
mortality based on tenure of residence. Poisson regression adjusted for sex, 
5-year age-groups, and calendar year; separately for men and women; and ages 
<30, 30-64 and ≥ 65 years; was reported as mortality rate ratios (MRR) with 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CI).
RESULTS: Until 1988, mortality in Lolland-Falster was fairly similar to that in 
the rest of Denmark. Hereafter, mortality rates drifted apart. In 2008-2017, MRR 
of the total Lolland-Falster population was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.19-1.23). In each 
10-year calendar period, people recently in-migrating constituted about one 
fourth of the population. MRRs of the in-migrating population increased over 
time from 1.17 (95% CI: 1.08-1.26) in 1968-1977, to 1.82 (95% CI: 1.75-1.89) in 
2008-2017. Persons aged 30-64 constituted the largest in-migrating group and had 
highest excess mortality, MRR 2.34 (95% CI: 2.19-2.50) in 2008-2017.
CONCLUSION: Long-term selective in-migration of vulnerable persons was behind 
the gradual build-up of the currently high mortality in Lolland-Falster compared 
to the rest of Denmark. In particular, people of working age in-migrating to 
Lolland-Falster contributed to this disparity.

Behavioral Savings: Heterogeneous Household Beliefs and Aggregate 
Nonlinearities.

Gomes O(1).

Author information:
(1)Lisbon Accounting and Business School, Lisbon Polytechnic Institute, Lisbon, 
Portugal.

Well documented empirical evidence points to the existence of strong 
heterogeneity regarding households' savings behavior over the life cycle: 
individuals endowed with identical inherited wealth, and with similar 
prospective income earnings and life expectancy, often select antithetical 
strategies when formulating their consumption-savings intertemporal plans. 
Underlying this evidence resides the fact that psychology matters, i.e., that 
economic agents are frequently influenced by their intrinsic beliefs (commanded 
by genetics and education) and by social and cultural motivations, thus 
deviating from strict rationality and strict optimal behavior. In this paper, a 
model of behavioral savings is proposed. In the model, three psychological 
profiles potentially coexist: individuals can be aligned with the rationality 
benchmark or, alternatively, they may depart from it by holding optimistic or 
pessimistic beliefs about future earnings. Each generation of households assumes 
one of the profiles (rational - optimistic - pessimistic), and new generations 
form their beliefs by making a constrained assessment of the utility levels 
attained by the existing generations (namely, they will mimic the behavior of 
generations which they perceive as being role models). The analysis 
characterizes the life-cycle implications of assuming each one of the belief 
profiles and proposes an explanation for aggregate fluctuations in savings and 
consumption based on the cyclical renewal of beliefs across the mentioned 
states.

BACKGROUND: The illicit use of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) has become a 
societal concern. We developed a decision-analytic model for assessing the 
cost-effectiveness of preventive interventions targeting AAS-use. We used 
scenario analyses to demonstrate: a) the potential health economic consequences 
of AAS use in Sweden, and b) the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical preventive 
intervention.
METHODS: A population-based cohort model compared a hypothetical preventive 
intervention targeting AAS with a 'no intervention' scenario, from a limited 
societal perspective. The model simulated how a cohort of 18 year-old males 
transitioned between different states and predicted their health status and 
complications until the age of 41. Health outcomes were estimated as 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). Costs included intervention costs, drug 
costs, and costs of complications.
RESULTS: Total yearly costs related to AAS use amounted to nearly half a million 
US$, with the largest cost borne by the healthcare sector. Results suggest that 
AAS prevention could entail large costs and benefits with a mean incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $550 per QALY, in a scenario where the intervention 
would decrease the probability of initiating AAS use by 5%.
CONCLUSION: Results show large AAS related costs, and suggest that the 
implementation of a preventive intervention could offer good value for money 
given different effectiveness scenarios. This model can be used to estimate the 
value of interventions targeting AAS use.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lynch syndrome is associated with pathogenic variants in 4 
mismatch repair (MMR) genes that increase lifetime risk of colorectal cancer. 
Guidelines recommend intensive colorectal cancer surveillance with colonoscopy 
every 1-2 years starting at age 25 years for all carriers of Lynch 
syndrome-associated variants, regardless of gene product. We constructed a 
simulation model to analyze the effects of different ages of colonoscopy 
initiation and surveillance intervals for each MMR gene (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and 
PMS2) on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, quality-adjusted life-years, 
and cost.
METHODS: Using published literature, we developed a Markov simulation model of 
Lynch syndrome progression for patients with each MMR variant. The model 
simulated clinical trials of Lynch syndrome carriers, varying age of colonoscopy 
initiation (5-year increments from 25-40 years), and surveillance intervals (1-5 
years). We assessed the optimal strategy for each gene, defined as the strategy 
with the highest quality-adjusted life-years and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio below a $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold.
RESULTS: Optimal surveillance for patients with pathogenic variants in the MLH1 
and MSH2 genes was colonoscopy starting at age 25 years, with 1- to 2-year 
surveillance intervals. Initiating colonoscopy at age 35 and 40 years, with
