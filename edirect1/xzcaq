BACKGROUND: Forward head posture (FHP) may be associated with neck pain and poor 
health-related quality of life. Literature describes only qualitative muscle 
length changes associated with FHP.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to quantify how muscle-tendon unit 
lengths are altered when human cadaveric specimens are placed in alignments 
representing different severities of FHP.
DESIGN: This biomechanical study used 13 fresh-frozen cadaveric cervical spine 
specimens (Occiput-T1, 54±15 y).
METHODS: Specimens' postural changes simulating increasing FHP severity while 
maintaining horizontal gaze were assessed. Specimen-specific anatomic models 
derived from computed tomography-based anatomic data were combined with postural 
data and specimen-specific anatomy of muscle attachment points to estimate the 
muscle length changes associated with FHP.
RESULTS: Forward head posture was associated with flexion of the mid-lower 
cervical spine and extension of the upper cervical (sub-occipital) spine. 
Muscles that insert on the cervical spine and function as flexors (termed 
"cervical flexors") as well as muscles that insert on the cranium and function 
as extensors ("occipital extensors") shortened in FHP when compared to neutral 
posture. In contrast, muscles that insert on the cervical spine and function as 
extensors ("cervical extensors") as well as muscles that insert on the cranium 
and function as flexors ("occipital flexors") lengthened. The greatest 
shortening was seen in the major and minor rectus capitis posterior muscles. 
These muscles cross the Occiput-C2 segments, which exhibited extension to 
maintain horizontal gaze. The greatest lengthening was seen in posterior muscles 
crossing the C4-C6 segments, which exhibited the most flexion.
LIMITATIONS: This cadaver study did not incorporate the biomechanical influence 
of active musculature.
CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a novel way to quantify postural alignment and 
muscle length changes associated with FHP. Model predictions are consistent with 
qualitative descriptions in the literature.

BACKGROUND: Epidural hematoma (EDH) is a common and potentially deadly 
occurrence following a severe traumatic brain injury. Our aim was to determine 
whether craniotomy is cost-effective when indicated for the treatment of EDH 
when a trained neurosurgeon is available.
METHODS: A decision tree was used to model the cost-effectiveness of craniotomy 
available versus craniotomy unavailable for the management of traumatic EDH from 
a Cambodian societal and provider perspective. Costs and effectiveness 
parameters were obtained from patient data at a large government hospital in 
Cambodia. Outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). 
Incremental cost per QALY and budget impact were calculated for each 
intervention at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $9787.80/QALY (3× GDP 
per capita PPP). The time horizon reflected full life span, and costs and QALYs 
were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted.
RESULTS: Compared to craniotomy unavailable for EDH ($945.80; 11.78 QALYs), 
craniotomy available came at a higher cost and greater effectiveness ($1520.73; 
12.78 QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
$574.93. One-way analysis demonstrated that craniotomy unavailable became more 
cost-effective than craniotomy available when the percent chance of having a GOS 
of 4 or 5 was 60% for patients with an EDH where craniotomy was indicated but 
not performed. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that craniotomy 
available was more cost-effective than conservative management in 84.4% of 
simulations at the WTP threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Craniotomy is a cost-effective treatment for patients with a 
traumatic EDH who meet criteria for operation when trained neurosurgeons are 
available onsite.

BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can be diagnosed early by 
noninvasive ultrasonography; however, the cost-effectiveness of ultrasonography 
screening with intensive weight reduction program in metabolic syndrome patients 
is not clear. This study aims to estimate economic and clinical outcomes of 
ultrasonography in Thailand.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis used decision tree and Markov models to 
estimate lifetime costs and health benefits from societal perspective, based on 
a cohort of 509 metabolic syndrome patients in Thailand. Data were obtained from 
published literatures and Thai database. Results were reported as incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2014 US dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained with discount rate of 3%. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed to assess the influence of parameter uncertainty on the results.
RESULTS: The ICER of ultrasonography screening of 50-year-old metabolic syndrome 
patients with intensive weight reduction program was 958 USD/QALY gained when 
compared with no screening. The probability of being cost-effective was 67% 
using willingness-to-pay threshold in Thailand (4848 USD/QALY gained). Screening 
before 45 years was cost saving while screening at 45 to 64 years was 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with metabolic syndromes, ultrasonography screening 
for NAFLD with intensive weight reduction program is a cost-effective program in 
Thailand. Study can be used as part of evidence-informed decision making.
TRANSLATIONAL IMPACTS: Findings could contribute to changes of NAFLD diagnosis 
practice in settings where economic evidence is used as part of decision-making 
process. Furthermore, study design, model structure, and input parameters could 
also be used for future research addressing similar questions.

BACKGROUND: To improve continuity of care at hospital admission and discharge 
and to decrease medication errors pharmaceutical care programs are developed. 
This study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of the COACH program in 
comparison with usual care from a societal perspective.
METHODS: A controlled clinical trial was performed at the Internal Medicine 
department of a general teaching hospital. All admitted patients using at least 
one prescription drug were included. The COACH program consisted of medication 
reconciliation, patient counselling at discharge, and communication to 
healthcare providers in primary care. The primary outcome was the proportion of 
patients with an unplanned rehospitalisation within three months after 
discharge. Also, the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was assessed. 
Cost data were collected using cost diaries. Uncertainty surrounding cost 
differences and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between the groups was 
estimated by bootstrapping.
RESULTS: In the COACH program, 168 patients were included and in usual care 151 
patients. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with 
unplanned rehospitalisations (mean difference 0.17%, 95% CI -8.85;8.51), and in 
QALYs (mean difference -0.0085, 95% CI -0.0170;0.0001). Total costs for the 
COACH program were non-significantly lower than usual care (-€1160, 95% CI 
-3168;847). Cost-effectiveness planes showed that the program was not 
cost-effective compared with usual care for unplanned rehospitalisations and 
QALYs gained.
CONCLUSION: The COACH program was not cost-effective in comparison with usual 
care. Future studies should focus on high risk patients and include other 
outcomes (e.g. adverse drug events) as this may increase the chances of a 
cost-effective intervention. Dutch trial register NTR1519.

During aging, innate immunity progresses to a chronically active state. However, 
what distinguishes those that "age well" from those developing age-related 
neurological conditions is unclear. We used Drosophila to explore the cost of 
immunity in the aging brain. We show that mutations in intracellular negative 
regulators of the IMD/NF-κB pathway predisposed flies to toxic levels of 
antimicrobial peptides, resulting in early locomotor defects, extensive 
neurodegeneration, and reduced lifespan. These phenotypes were rescued when 
immunity was suppressed in glia. In healthy flies, suppressing immunity in glial 
cells resulted in increased adipokinetic hormonal signaling with high nutrient 
levels in later life and an extension of active lifespan. Thus, when levels of 
IMD/NF-κB deviate from normal, two mechanisms are at play: lower levels 
derepress an immune-endocrine axis, which mobilizes nutrients, leading to 
lifespan extension, whereas higher levels increase antimicrobial peptides, 
causing neurodegeneration. Immunity in the fly brain is therefore a key lifespan 
determinant.

BACKGROUND: Metrics based on self-reports of health status have been proposed 
for tracking population health and making comparisons among different 
populations. While these metrics have been used in the US to explore disparities 
by sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic position, less is known about how 
self-reported health varies geographically. This study aimed to describe 
county-level trends in the prevalence of poor self-reported health and to assess 
the face validity of these estimates.
METHODS: We applied validated small area estimation methods to Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance System data to estimate annual county-level prevalence of 
four measures of poor self-reported health (low general health, frequent 
physical distress, frequent mental distress, and frequent activity limitation) 
from 1995 and 2012. We compared these measures of poor self-reported health to 
other population health indicators, including risk factor prevalence (smoking, 
physical inactivity, and obesity), chronic condition prevalence (hypertension 
and diabetes), and life expectancy.
RESULTS: We found substantial geographic disparities in poor self-reported 
health. Counties in parts of South Dakota, eastern Kentucky and western West 
Virginia, along the Texas-Mexico border, along the southern half of the 
Mississippi river, and in southern Alabama generally experienced the highest 
levels of poor self-reported health. At the county level, there was a strong 
positive correlation among the four measures of poor self-reported health and 
between the prevalence of poor self-reported health and the prevalence of risk 
factors and chronic conditions. There was a strong negative correlation between 
prevalence of poor self-reported health and life expectancy. Nonetheless, 
counties with similar levels of poor self-reported health experienced life 
expectancies that varied by several years. Changes over time in life expectancy 
were only weakly correlated with changes in the prevalence of poor self-reported 
health.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis adds to the growing body of literature documenting 
large geographic disparities in health outcomes in the United States. Health 
metrics based on self-reports of health status can and should be used to 
complement other measures of population health, such as life expectancy, to 
identify high need areas, efficiently allocate resources, and monitor geographic 
disparities.

Microparticles (MP) are small membrane vesicles released from many different 
cell types in response to cellular activation or apoptosis, which have the 
procoagulant effect. Hemolytic anemia(HA) is a type of anemia that have a short 
life expectancy of red blood cells due to the destruction which exceed the 
hematopoietic compensatory capacity of bone marrow. Sickle cell anemia(SCD), 
thalassemia and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria(PNH) are all characterized 
by hypercoagulation and thromboembolism (TE). Research shows that MP can promote 
the formation of hypercoagulative state which in turn increases the risk of 
thromboembolism in HA. This review mainly summarized the advance research of MP 
in HA in the past 5 years. Moreover the relationship between the abnormal MP and 
hypercoagulation in HA, the impact of the related treatment to the MP, the 
research of MP in animal model of HA and the application of the MP-proteomics in 
HA are also disscussed.

The initial kinetochore (KT) encounter with a spindle microtubule (MT; KT 
capture) is one of the rate-limiting steps in establishing proper KT-MT 
interaction during mitosis. KT capture is facilitated by multiple factors, such 
as MT extension in various directions, KT diffusion, and MT pivoting. In 
addition, KTs generate short MTs, which subsequently interact with a spindle MT. 
KT-derived MTs may facilitate KT capture, but their contribution is elusive. In 
this study, we find that Stu1 recruits Stu2 to budding yeast KTs, which promotes 
MT generation there. By removing Stu2 specifically from KTs, we show that 
KT-derived MTs shorten the half-life of noncaptured KTs from 48-49 s to 28-34 s. 
Using computational simulation, we found that multiple factors facilitate KT 
capture redundantly or synergistically. In particular, KT-derived MTs play 
important roles both by making a significant contribution on their own and by 
synergistically enhancing the effects of KT diffusion and MT pivoting. Our study 
reveals fundamental mechanisms facilitating the initial KT encounter with 
spindle MTs.

In recent years, an extension of the Darwinian framework is being considered for 
the study of prebiotic chemical evolution, shifting the attention from 
homogeneous populations of naked molecular species to populations of 
heterogeneous, compartmentalized and functionally integrated assemblies of 
molecules. Several implications of this shift of perspective are analysed in 
this critical review, both in terms of the individual units, which require an 
adequate characterization as self-maintaining systems with an internal 
organization, and also in relation to their collective and long-term 
evolutionary dynamics, based on competition, collaboration and selection 
processes among those complex individuals. On these lines, a concrete proposal 
for the set of molecular control mechanisms that must be coupled to bring about 
autonomous functional systems, at the interface between chemistry and biology, 
is provided.

Worldwide increase in life expectancy is a major contributor to the epidemic of 
chronic degenerative diseases. Aging, indeed, simultaneously affects multiple 
organ systems, and it has been hypothesized that systemic alterations in 
regulators of tissue physiology may regulate this process. Cardiac aging itself 
is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and, because of the intimate 
relationship with the brain, may contribute to increase the risk of 
neurodegenerative disorders. Blood-borne factors may play a major role in this 
complex and still elusive process. A number of studies, mainly based on the 
revival of parabiosis, a surgical technique very popular during the 70s of the 
20th century to study the effect of a shared circulation in two animals, have 
indeed shown the potential that humoral factors can control the aging process in 
different tissues. In this article we review the role of circulating factors in 
cardiovascular aging. A better understanding of these mechanisms may provide new 
insights in the aging process and provide novel therapeutic opportunities for 
chronic age-related disorders.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare disorder associated with 
increased risk for thrombosis and reduced life expectancy. Retinal vein 
occlusion (RVO) is a frequent cause of vision loss but its relationship with PNH 
has not been studied systematically. Patients followed up for RVO in our 
ophthalmology department were screened for the presence of a PNH clone in 
peripheral blood by means of flow cytometry. The presence of other 
well-documented risk factors for RVO was also analyzed. In a series of 110 
patients (54 males, median age of 67) we found no evidence of PNH. Most patients 
(97/110) had cardiovascular risk factors and/or hyperhomocysteinemia (67/110). 
Inherited thrombophilias were rare (three confirmed cases). Therefore, PNH does 
not appear to play a role in the development of RVO. However, this finding does 
not necessarily apply to young patients and/or those with no conventional risk 
factors for RVO, due to the low number of patients in these subgroups in our 
population.

AIM: For selected patients with brain metastases (BMs), the role of stereotactic 
radiosurgery (SRS) or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SFRT) is well 
recognized. The recent introduction of flattening filter free (FFF) delivery 
during linac-based SRS or SFRT allows shorter beam-on-time, improving patients' 
comfort and facility workflow. Nevertheless, limited experiences evaluated the 
impact of FFF linac-based SRS and SFRT in BMs treatment. Aim of the current 
study was to analyze SRS/SFRT linac-based FFF delivery for BMs in terms of 
dosimetric and early clinical results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with life expectancy >3 months, number of BMs 
<5, diameter <3 cm, and controlled or synchronous primary tumor received 
SRS/SFRT. The prescribed total dose and fractionation, based on BMs size and 
proximity to organs at risk, ranged from 15 Gy in 1 fraction to 30 Gy in 5 
fractions. A FFF volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plan was generated with 
one or two coplanar partial arcs. Toxicity was assessed according to CTCAE v4.0.
RESULTS: From April 2014 to February 2016, 45 patients (89 BMs) were treated 
with SRS/SFRT linac-based FFF delivery. The mean beam-on-time was 140 s for each 
lesion (range 90-290 s) and the average brain Dmean was 1 Gy (range 0.1-4.8 Gy). 
At the time of analysis, local control was reported in 93.2% (83/89 BMs). With a 
median follow-up time of 12 months (range 1-27 months), the median overall 
survival was 14 months and the 6-month overall survival was 77%. Finally, the 
median intracranial disease control was 11 months. Acute and late toxicities 
were acceptable without severe events (no adverse events ≥G2 were recorded).
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results highlighted the feasibility and safety of 
linac-based SRS/SFRT with FFF mode for BMs patients. A longer follow-up is 
necessary to confirm the efficacy of this treatment modality in BM patients.

Lower extremities varicose veins are among the most frequent diseases in the 
general population. They can cause complaints with a deterioration of the 
quality of life and are associated with potentially threatening clinical 
conditions such as chronic venous ulceration, haemorrhage from ruptured varicose 
veins, and venous thromboembolism. An accurate diagnostic work-up is crucial to 
confirm the presence and the extension of the venous problem, in order to obtain 
an optimal management of the condition. In the past years, great efforts have 
been made to reach an international consensus on the terminology, the 
symptomatology, the classification, and the duplex ultrasound examination of 
lower extremities varicose veins. Mainly guided by these consensus documents, 
the present article describes the diagnostic work-up of lower extremities 
varicose veins, based on a careful medical history, physical examination, and 
duplex ultrasound examination.

To test the applicability of postexercise blood flow restriction (PEBFR) in 
practical training programmes, we investigated whether PEBFR enhances muscle 
hypertrophy induced by multiple-set high-load resistance exercise (RE). Seven 
men completed an eight-week RE programme for knee extensor muscles. Employing a 
within-subject design, one leg was subjected to RE + PEBFR, whereas 
contralateral leg to RE only. On each exercise session, participants performed 
three sets of unilateral knee extension exercise at approximately 70% of their 
one-repetition maximum for RE leg first, and then performed three sets for 
RE + PEBFR leg. Immediately after completion of the third set, the proximal 
portion of the RE + PEBFR leg was compressed with an air-pressure cuff for 5 min 
at a pressure ranging from 100 to 150 mmHg. If participants could perform 10 
repetitions for three sets in two consecutive exercise sessions, the work load 
was increased by 5% at the next exercise session. Muscle thickness and strength 
of knee extensor muscles were measured before and after the eight-week training 
period and after the subsequent eight-week detraining period. There was a main 
effect of time but no condition × time interaction or main effect of condition 
for muscle thickness and strength. Both muscle thickness and strength increased 
after the training period independent of the condition. This result suggests 
that PEBFR would not be an effective training method at least in an early phase 
of adaptation to high-load resistance exercise.

Combination antiretroviral therapies (cART)can lead to normal life expectancy in 
HIV-infected persons, and people aged >50 yrs represent the fastest growing HIV 
group. Although HIV and aging are independently associated with impaired humoral 
immunity, immune status in people aging with HIV is relatively unexplored. In 
this study influenza vaccination was used to probe age associated perturbations 
in the B cell compartment of HIV-negative "healthy controls" (HC) and 
virologically controlled HIV-infected participants on cART (HIV) (n=124), 
grouped by age as young (<40 yrs), middle-aged (40-59yrs) or old (>60 yrs). H1N1 
antibody response at d21 post-vaccination correlated inversely with age in both 
HC and HIV. Immunophenotyping of cryopreserved PBMC demonstrated increased 
frequencies of double negative B cells and decreased plasmablasts in old 
compared to young HC. Remarkably, young HIV were different from young HC but 
similar to old HC in B cell phenotype, influenza specific spontaneous (d7) or 
memory (d21) antibody secreting cells. We conclude that B cell immune senescence 
is a prominent phenomenon in young HIV in comparison to young HC, but 
distinctions between old HIV and old HC are less evident though both groups 
manifest age-associated B cell dysfunction.

OBJECTIVES: Improved life expectancy and reduced transmission probabilities due 
to ART may result in behavioural disinhibition - that is an increase in sexual 
risk behaviour in response to a perceived lower risk of HIV. We examined trends 
in sexual risk behaviour in the general population of sub-Saharan African 
countries 1999-2015.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed scientific literature of sexual behaviour 
and reviewed trends in Demographic and Health Surveys. A meta-analysis on four 
indicators of sexual risk behaviour was performed: unprotected sex, multiple 
sexual partners, commercial sex and prevalence of sexually transmitted 
infections.
RESULTS: Only two peer-reviewed studies met our inclusion criteria, while our 
review of DHS data spanned 18 countries and 16 years (1999-2015). We found 
conflicting trends in sexual risk behaviour. Reported unprotected sex decreased 
consistently across the 18 countries, for both sexes. In contrast, reporting 
multiple partners was decreasing over the period 1999 to the mid-2000s, yet has 
been consistently increasing thereafter. Similar trends were found for reported 
sexually transmitted infections and commercial sex (men only).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found no clear evidence of behavioural 
disinhibition due to expanded access to ART in sub-Saharan Africa. Substantial 
increases in condom use coincided with increases in reported multiple partners, 
commercial sex and sexually transmitted infections, especially during the period 
of ART scale-up. Further research is needed into how these changes might affect 
HIV transmission.

Kong, Hong Kong.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: In Asia-Pacific where cost is a major concern, peginterferon 
plus ribavirin (PR) often remain as the standard of care in chronic hepatitis C 
(CHC) treatment, while the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are commonly 
recommended as retreatment. Newer DAAs can achieve a sustained virological 
response (SVR) of nearly 100% with pan-genotypic coverage, that is "Highly 
Effective DAAs." We aimed to investigate the most desirable cost range for the 
Highly Effective DAAs using Hong Kong as an example.
METHODS: Markov modeling was performed using PR as the reference strategy. The 
cost-effectiveness of the Highly Effective DAAs was compared with sofosbuvir-PR 
(first-line and rescue) and boceprevir-PR therapies. A 50-year-old genotype 1b 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected treatment-naïve patient with METAVIR F3 was 
used as the base case scenario to reflect the commonest HCV genotype in Hong 
Kong.
RESULTS: The use of PR would incur a lifetime cost of US$35,854 and 
effectiveness of 14.85 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sofosbuvir-PR as 
first-line treatment was dominated by other regimes. If Sofosbuvir-PR rescue 
therapy was used, the drug cost of Highly Effective DAAs should be set below 
US$43,553, with a cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) of US$3035/QALY compared with 
PR. In regions where Boceprevir-PR was still used as first-line therapy, the 
desirable drug cost of Highly Effective DAAs would be below US$56,985 to achieve 
a CER of US$5427/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The most desirable costs of the Highly Effective DAAs would be 
below US$43,553 if Sofosbuvir-PR rescue therapy is used and below US$56,985 if 
Boceprevir-PR therapy is used.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and analyze the outcomes of a 
treat-and-extend (T&E) treatment regimen with ranibizumab for wet age-related 
macular degeneration (ARMD) in real life clinical settings over the first 
2 years (24 months) of treatment.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of visual acuity, spectral domain optical 
coherence tomography (SD-OCT) parameters and treatment burden data of 56 eyes of 
54 unselected treatment naive patients diagnosed with exudative ARMD. Monthly 
injections were offered until no signs of disease activity such as intra-retinal 
(IRF) or sub-retinal fluid (SRF) were evident on SD-OCT, followed by a gradual 
extension of the treatment interval by 2 weeks until a maximum of 12 weeks.
RESULTS: The study met its main objective, demonstrating a mean best-corrected 
visual acuity gain of 8.3 letters (mean 68.8 ± 11) at month 12 and 5.2 letters 
(mean 65.7 ± 12.3) at 24 months compared to baseline (mean 60.5 ± 8.9). 
Anatomical improvement was also documented with a mean reduction of central 
retinal thickness by 139.7 μm at 24 months (244.9 ± 48.3) compared to baseline 
(384.6 ± 154.9). Forty-seven eyes (83.9% N = 56) gained vision or preserved 
baseline vision with 23 eyes (41.1%) gaining 10 letters or more at month 12. Out 
of the 46 eyes that completed 24 months of treatment and monitoring, 27 (58.7% 
N = 46) kept a BCVA above baseline with 18 of those (39% N = 46) maintaining a 
10-letter gain throughout the 24 months. Six eyes (13% N = 46) lost more than 10 
letters by month 24. The mean number of injections was 12.1 ± 2.8 over the 
24-month period. Twenty-seven eyes (55.1% N = 56) achieved a treatment interval 
of 10 weeks or more at month 12, while the respective number at month 24 was 20 
eyes (43.4% N = 46) in addition though to four more patients (8.7% N = 46) who 
were not receiving injections at month 24 since they were placed on a Monitor & 
Extend regime.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first UK real-life study of a T&E treatment protocol 
with ranibizumab for exudative ARMD in a 24-month period and suggests that such 
a regimen is clinically effective and can achieve favourable outcomes with a 
significant reduction of the treatment burden compared to monthly PRN.

PURPOSE: The present study aimed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of 
ingenol mebutate (IM) versus other topical alternatives for the treatment of 
actinic keratosis (AK).
METHODS: The analysis used a decision tree to calculate the clinical effects and 
costs of AK first-line treatments, IM (2-3 days), diclofenac 3% (for 8 or 12 
weeks), imiquimod 5% (for 4 or 8 weeks), during a 24-month horizon, using 
discrete intervals of 6 months. A hypothetical cohort of immunocompetent adult 
patients with clinically confirmed AK on the face and scalp or trunk and 
extremities was considered. Clinical data on the relative efficacy were obtained 
from a network meta-analysis. Inputs concerning resource use derived from an 
expert panel. All costs were calculated from a Greek third-party payer 
perspective.
FINDINGS: IM 0.015% and 0.05% were both cost-effective compared with diclofenac 
and below a willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) (€199 and €167 per QALY, respectively). Comparing IM on the 
face and scalp AK lesions for 3 days versus imiquimod for 4 weeks resulted in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €10,868 per QALY. IM was dominant during 
the 8-week imiquimod period. IM use on the trunk and extremities compared with 
diclofenac (8 or 12 weeks) led to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
estimated at €1584 and €1316 per QALY accordingly. Results remained robust to 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
IMPLICATIONS: From a social insurance perspective in Greece, IM 0.015% and IM 
0.05% could be the most cost-effective first-line topical field treatment 
options in all cases for AK treatment.

Hyperbaric storage (HS) of raw watermelon juice, at 50, 62.5 and 75MPa, at 
temperatures of 10, 15 and ≈25°C (room temperature, RT), was studied to evaluate 
shelf-life comparatively to refrigeration (RF, 4°C). Generally, RF caused an 
increase of microbial loads to values ≥6.0logCFU/mL after 7days of storage. 
Contrarily, HS at 62.5/75MPa (15°C) showed a reduction of initial loads, by at 
least 2.5logCFU/mL, up to 58days, while pH and colour values did not changed 
under these HS conditions. Additionally, the combination of a lower temperature 
with HS has beneficial effects to control microbial development, particularly 
for the lower pressure studied (50MPa/10°C). In conclusion, HS increased 
watermelon juice shelf-life for at least 58days, indicating a great potential 
for future RF replacement.

BACKGROUND: Increased focus has been placed on perioperative and long-term 
outcomes in the treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD), both for purposes 
of quality improvement and for assessment of performance at a surgeon and 
institutional level. This study evaluates regional variation in outcomes after 
treatment for PAD within the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI). By describing 
the variation in practice patterns and outcomes across regions, we hope that 
each regionally based quality group can select which areas are most important 
for them to focus on as they will have access to their regional data to compare.
METHODS: We identified all patients in the VQI who had infrainguinal bypass or 
endovascular intervention from 2009 to 2014. We compared variation in 
perioperative and 1-year outcomes stratified by symptom status and 
revascularization type among the 16 regional groups of the VQI. We analyzed 
variation in perioperative end points using χ2 analysis, and 1-year end points 
were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and life-table analysis.
RESULTS: We identified 15,338 bypass procedures for symptomatic PAD: 27% for 
claudication, 59% for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLI; 61% of these for 
tissue loss), and 14% for acute limb ischemia. We identified 33,925 endovascular 
procedures for symptomatic PAD: 42% for claudication, 48% for CLI (73% of these 
for tissue loss), and 10% for acute limb ischemia. Thirty-day mortality varied 
significantly after endovascular intervention for CLI (0.5%-3%; P < .001) but 
not for claudication (0.0%-0.5%, P = .77) or for bypass for claudication 
(0.0%-2.6%; P = .37) or CLI (0.0%-5.0%; P = .08). After bypass, rates of >2 
units transfused red blood cells (claudication, 0.0%-13% [P < .001]; CLI, 
6.9%-27% [P < .001]) varied significantly. In-hospital major amputation was 
variable after bypass for CLI (0.0%-4.3%; P = .004) but not for claudication 
(0.0%-0.6%; P = .98), as was postoperative myocardial infarction (claudication, 
0.0%-4% [P = .36]; CLI, 0.8%-6% [P = .001]). One-year survival varied 
significantly for endovascular interventions for claudication (92%-100%; P < 
.001), bypass for CLI (85%-94% [P < .001]), and endovascular interventions for 
CLI (77%-96%; P < .001) but not after bypass for claudication (95%-100%; P = 
.57).
CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world comparison among VQI regions, we found 
significant variation in perioperative and 1-year end points for patients with 
PAD undergoing bypass or endovascular intervention. This study highlights 
opportunities for quality improvement efforts to reduce variation and to improve 
outcomes.

Designing Methuselah: an ethical argument against germline genetic modification 
to prolong human longevity.

Robertson IL.

Precise editing of the human germline has been considered an unlikely and an 
unethical proposition. Recently, tools to edit the human germline have been 
developed and it is now a realistic prospect. Consequently, the ethical 
arguments around prohibiting human genome editing need to be re-evaluated. It is 
anticipatable that using it to eradicate disease-causing mutations will be 
acceptable if clinical risks can be shown to be sufficiently low. Some go 
further and advocate that genetically 'enhancing' humans will also be
