Understanding the global burden of trauma, particularly upper extremity trauma, 
is necessary in addressing the need for surgical services. Critical to that 
mission is to understand, and accurately measure, disability and related 
disability-adjusted life-years from massive upper extremity trauma. The impact 
of these injuries is magnified when considering that they frequently occur to 
young people in prime working years. This article discusses these social and 
medical system issues and reviews components of a comprehensive approach to 
measuring outcomes after these injuries. Patient-reported outcomes are 
highlighted. Methods of optimizing outcomes measurements and studies, disability 
assessments, and associated research are also discussed.

Skin cancer (melanoma- and non-melanoma skin cancer) is one of the most rapidly 
increasing cancers worldwide. This study analysed the current and future 
economic burden of skin cancer in Belgium and the cost-effectiveness of primary 
prevention of skin cancer. A retrospective bottom-up cost-of-illness study was 
performed, together with a Markov model in order to analyse the 
cost-effectiveness and the budget impact analysis of primary prevention of skin 
cancer in Belgium. Total prevalence of skin cancer in Belgium was estimated to 
triple in the next 20years. The total economic burden of skin cancer in 2014 in 
Belgium was estimated at €106 million, with a cumulative cost of €3 billion in 
2034. The majority of this total cost was due to melanoma (65%). Over a period 
of 50years, both a sensitisation campaign and a total ban on sunbed use would 
lead to a gain in quality-adjusted life-years and cost-savings. For every euro 
invested in the campaign, €3.6 would be saved on the long-term for the 
healthcare payer. Policy makers and clinicians should promote UV protection 
strategies, as they were estimated to be dominant strategies.

Apple orchard management practices may affect development and phenology of 
arthropod pests, such as the codling moth (CM), Cydia pomonella (L.) 
(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), which is a serious internal fruit-feeding pest of 
apples worldwide. Estimating population dynamics and accurately predicting the 
timing of CM development and phenology events (for instance, adult flight, and 
egg-hatch) allows growers to understand and control local populations of CM. 
Studies were conducted to compare the CM flight phenology in commercial and 
abandoned apple orchard ecosystems using a logistic function model based on 
degree-days accumulation. The flight models for these orchards were derived from 
the cumulative percent moth capture using two types of commercially available CM 
lure baited traps. Models from both types of orchards were also compared to 
another model known as PETE (prediction extension timing estimator) that was 
developed in 1970s to predict life cycle events for many fruit pests including 
CM across different fruit growing regions of the United States. We found that 
the flight phenology of CM was significantly different in commercial and 
abandoned orchards. CM male flight patterns for first and second generations as 
predicted by the constrained and unconstrained PCM (Pennsylvania Codling Moth) 
models in commercial and abandoned orchards were different than the flight 
patterns predicted by the currently used CM model (i.e., PETE model). In 
commercial orchards, during the first and second generations, the PCM 
unconstrained model predicted delays in moth emergence compared to current 
model. In addition, the flight patterns of females were different between 
commercial and abandoned orchards. Such differences in CM flight phenology 
between commercial and abandoned orchard ecosystems suggest potential impact of 
orchard environment and crop management practices on CM biology.

BACKGROUND: With a steep increase in the number of instrumented spinal fusion 
procedures, there is a need for comparative data to develop evidence based 
treatment recommendations. Currently, the available data on cost and clinical 
effectiveness of the two most frequently performed surgeries for lumbar 
spondylolisthesis, transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and posterior 
lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), are not sufficient. Therefore, current 
guidelines do not advise which is the most appropriate surgical treatment 
strategy for these patients. Non-randomized studies comparing TLIF and PLIF 
moreover suggest that TLIF is associated with fewer complications, less blood 
loss, shorter surgical time and hospital duration. TLIF may therefore be more 
cost-effective. The results of this study will provide knowledge on short- and 
long-term clinical and economical effects of TLIF and PLIF procedures, which 
will lead to recommendations for treating patients with lumbar 
spondylolisthesis.
METHODS: Multicenter blinded Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT; blinding for the 
patient and statistician, not for the clinician and researcher). A total of 144 
patients over 18 years old with symptomatic single level lumbar degenerative, 
isthmic or iatrogenic spondylolisthesis whom are candidates for LIF (lumbar 
interbody fusion) surgery through a posterior approach will be randomly 
allocated to TLIF or PLIF. The study will consist of three parts: 1) a clinical 
effectiveness study, 2) a cost-effectiveness study, and 3) a process evaluation. 
The primary clinical outcome measures are: change in disability measured with 
Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and change in quality adjusted life years (QALY) 
measured with EQ-5D-5L. Secondary clinical outcome measures are: Short Form (36) 
Health Survey (SF-36), VAS back pain, VAS leg pain, Hospital Anxiety Depression 
Scale (HADS), complications, productivity related costs (iPCQ) and medical costs 
(iMCQ). Measurements will be carried out at five fixed time points 
(pre-operatively and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months).
DISCUSSION: It is hypothesized that TLIF, compared to PLIF, has similar clinical 
outcome or is possibly better in reducing disability. Moreover, direct medical 
costs are expected to be lower due to less surgical morbidity, shorter hospital 
stay and shorter surgical time. Indirect costs are assumed to be lower for TLIF 
as well, because we suspect less working days are lost. Currently, prospective 
data comparing clinical and cost-effectiveness of both techniques are not 
available. Therefore, in clinical practice both techniques are used and the 
choice for technique is greatly based on surgeon's preference. The demand for 
spinal fusion surgery has risen steeply over the last 10 years and is expected 
to increase even further in the near future. As a result, the burden on society 
(and the working population) will increase. In case our hypothesis is confirmed, 
treatment guidelines will be adapted, and TLIF will be recommended as first 
choice surgical treatment of lumbar spondylolisthesis. Ultimately this will lead 
to reduction of (direct and indirect) costs and better clinical outcome for 
spondylolisthesis patients eligible for instrumented spinal surgery.

BACKGROUND: Optimizing patient selection is a necessary step to design better 
clinical trials. 'Life expectancy' is a frequent inclusion criterion in phase II 
trial protocols, a measure that is subjective and often difficult to estimate. 
The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with early death in 
patients included in phase II studies.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected medical records of patients with advanced 
solid tumors included in phase II trials in two French Comprehensive Cancer 
Centers (Bordeaux, Center 1 set; Lille, Center 2 set). We analyzed patients' 
baseline characteristics. Predictive factors associated with early death 
(mortality at 3 months) were identified by logistic regression. We built a model 
(PREDIT, PRognostic factor of Early Death In phase II Trials) based on 
prognostic factors isolated from the final multivariate model.
RESULTS: Center 1 and 2 sets included 303 and 227 patients, respectively. 
Patients from Center 1 and 2 sets differed in tumor site, urological (26 % vs 
15 %) and gastrointestinal (18 % vs 28 %) and in lung metastasis incidence (10 % 
vs 49 %). Overall survival (OS) at 3 months was 88 % (95 % CI [83.5; 91.0], 
Center 1 set) and 91 % (95 % CI [86.7; 94.2], Center 2 set). Presence of a 'life 
expectancy' inclusion criterion did not improve the 3-month OS (HR 0.6, 95 % CI 
[0.2; 1.2], p = 0.2325). Independent factors of early death were an ECOG score 
of 2 (OR 13.3, 95%CI [4.1; 43.4]), hyperleukocytosis (OR 5.5, 95 % CI [1.9; 
16.3]) and anemia (OR 2.8, 95 % CI [1.1; 7.1]). Same predictive factors but with 
different association levels were found in the Center 2 set. Using the Center 1 
set, ROC analysis shows a good discrimination to predict early death (AUC: 0.89 
at 3 months and 0.86 at 6 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Risk modeling in two independent cancer populations based on simple 
clinical parameters showed that baseline ECOG of 2, hyperleukocytosis and anemia 
are strong early-death predictive factors. This model allows identifying 
patients who may not benefit from a phase II trial investigational drug and may, 
therefore, represent a helpful tool to select patients for phase II trial entry.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is affecting 
thousands of patients worldwide. Adjuvant anti-inflammatory treatment is an 
important component of cystic fibrosis treatment, and has shown promise in 
preserving lung function and prolonging life expectancy. Inhaled high molecular 
weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA) is reported to improve tolerability of hypertonic 
saline and thus increase compliance, and has been approved in some European 
countries for use as an adjunct to hypertonic saline treatment in cystic 
fibrosis. However, there are theoretical concerns that HMW-HA breakdown products 
may be pro-inflammatory. In this clinical pilot study we show that sputum 
cytokines in CF patients receiving HMW-HA are not increased, and therefore 
HMW-HA does not appear to adversely affect inflammatory status in CF airways.

BACKGROUND: Our objective was to assess the efficiency of treatments in patients 
with localized prostate cancer, by synthesizing available evidence from European 
economic evaluations through systematic review.
METHODS: Articles published 2000-2015 were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE and NHS 
EED (Prospero protocol CRD42015022063). Two authors independently selected 
studies for inclusion and extracted the data. A third reviewer resolved 
discrepancies. We included European economic evaluations or cost comparison 
studies, of any modality of surgery or radiotherapy treatments, regardless the 
comparator/s. Drummond's Checklist was used for quality assessment.
RESULTS: After reviewing 8,789 titles, 13 European eligible studies were 
included: eight cost-utility, two cost-effectiveness, one cost-minimization, and 
two cost-comparison analyses. Of them, five compared interventions with 
expectant management, four contrasted robotic with non robotic-assisted surgery, 
three assessed new modalities of radiotherapy, and three compared radical 
prostatectomy with brachytherapy. All but two studies scored ≥8 in the quality 
checklist. Considering scenario and comparator, three interventions were 
qualified as dominant strategies (active surveillance, robotic-assisted surgery 
and IMRT), and six were cost-effective (radical prostatectomy, robotic-assisted 
surgery, IMRT, proton therapy, brachytherapy, and 3DCRT). However, QALY gains in 
most of them were small. For interventions considered as dominant strategies, 
QALY gain was 0.013 for active surveillance over radical prostatectomy; and 
0.007 for robotic-assisted over non-robotic techniques. The highest QALY gains 
were 0.57-0.86 for radical prostatectomy vs watchful waiting, and 0.72 for 
brachytherapy vs conventional radiotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Currently, relevant treatment alternatives for localized prostate 
cancer are scarcely evaluated in Europe. Very limited available evidence 
supports the cost-effectiveness of radical prostatectomy over watchful waiting, 
brachytherapy over radical prostatectomy, and new treatment modalities over 
traditional procedures. Relevant disparities were detected among studies, mainly 
based on effectiveness. These apparently contradictory results may be reflecting 
the difficulty of interpreting small differences between treatments regarding 
QALY gains.

Secreting pituitary adenomas that cause acromegaly and Cushing's disease, as 
well as prolactinomas and thyrotroph adenomas, are uncommon, usually benign, 
slow-growing tumours. The rarity of these conditions means that their diagnosis 
is not familiar to most non-specialist physicians. Consequently, pituitary 
adenomas may be overlooked and remain untreated, and affected individuals may 
develop serious comorbidities that reduce their quality of life and life 
expectancy. Because many signs and symptoms of pituitary adenomas overlap with 
those of other, more common disorders, general practitioners and 
non-endocrinology specialists need to be aware of the "red flags" suggestive of 
these conditions. A long duration of active disease in patients with secreting 
pituitary adenomas is associated with an increased risk of comorbidities and 
reduced quality of life. Appropriate treatment can lead to disease remission, 
and, although some symptoms may persist in some patients, treatment usually 
reduces the incidence and severity of comorbidities and improves quality of 
life. Therefore, correct, early diagnosis and characterization of a pituitary 
adenoma is crucial for patients, to trigger timely, appropriate treatment and to 
optimize outcome. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology of 
hormonal syndromes associated with pituitary adenomas, discusses the 
difficulties of and considerations for their diagnosis, and reviews the 
comorbidities that may develop, but can be prevented, by accurate diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment. We hope this review will help general practitioners and 
non-endocrinology specialists to suspect secreting pituitary adenomas and refer 
patients to an endocrinologist for confirmation of the diagnosis and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Approximately half of new invasive breast cancer cases diagnosed 
each year in the United States occur among women aged 65 years and older. The 
increasing life expectancy coupled with the attendant rise in breast cancer 
incidence and elimination of out-of-pocket expenses for screening mammography as 
a result of the Affordable Care Act could lead to higher utilization rates of 
screening mammography. Although research indicates that life expectancy should 
be a strong consideration when making screening decisions among older women, the 
extent to which screening mammography utilization is tailored to comorbidity and 
life expectancy is not well established.
METHODS/DESIGN: To identify relevant studies, a systematic search of the 
literature will be conducted using PubMed and EMBASE between January 1, 1991, 
and March 1, 2016. Additional studies will be found through citation review or 
by contacting experts in the field. The inclusion criteria will be any study 
design comprised of women aged 65 and older, assessing women's comorbidity, 
functional impairments, and/or health status, and reporting outcome measures 
that addressed mammography utilization within the last 1-5 years. For each 
study, two authors will independently abstract data regarding study eligibility 
and outcomes to determine relevance. Quantitative results will be extracted from 
text and tables, choosing preferably those adjusted for important confounders.
DISCUSSION: The review will provide evidence on the impact of comorbidity, 
functional limitations, and health status on screening mammography utilization 
in older women and inform decision aids in this area.

AIM: Increased morbidity and mortality could mitigate the positive effect of 
surgery in elderly patients undergoing colorectal resections. This retrospective 
study aims to describe early morbidity and mortality together with long-term 
survival in octogenarians and nonagenarians undergoing colorectal surgery. 
Predictors for in-hospital mortality are identified. The predictive value of 
CR-POSSUM is assessed.
METHOD: Data on consecutive patients 80 years old or more undergoing a 
colorectal resection in our centre from 2004 until 2010 were analysed.
RESULTS: Some 286 patients [median age 84 years; interquartile range (IQR) 
81.6-86.1; 133 men, 47%] underwent a colorectal resection. Median follow-up was 
32 months (IQR 14.5-51.2). Two hundred and fifty-eight patients (90%) were 
operated on for malignancy. Only 64 patients (22.4%) underwent a laparoscopic 
procedure. Overall median hospital stay was 12 days (IQR 9.0-20.0) and 
in-hospital mortality was 9.4%. Seventy-six per cent (n = 170) of patients could 
return home after discharge. The 1-year survival rate was 78.6% (95% CI 
73.8-82.7). Median CR-POSSUM for in-hospital mortality was 12.6% (IQR 
11.9-21.0). The concordance probability estimate was 0.668 (95% CI 0.609-0.728), 
reflecting a moderate predictive capacity of CR-POSSUM. Once patients had been 
discharged from hospital, life expectancy was similar to that of the Belgian 
general population.
CONCLUSION: Colorectal surgery in octogenarians and nonagenarians resulted in a 
considerable in-hospital mortality of about 9%. One-year mortality added an 
additional 12%, which is in concordance with the overall life expectancy at that 
age.

AIMS: Schizophrenia is associated with cardiovascular co-morbidity and a reduced 
life-expectancy of up to 20 years. Antipsychotics are dopamine D2 receptor 
antagonists and are the standard of medical care in schizophrenia, but the drugs 
are associated with severe metabolic side effects such as obesity and diabetes. 
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are registered for 
treatment of both obesity and type 2 diabetes. We investigated metabolic effects 
of the GLP-1RA, exenatide once-weekly, in non-diabetic, antipsychotic-treated, 
obese patients with schizophrenia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antipsychotic-treated, obese, non-diabetic, schizophrenia 
spectrum patients were randomized to double-blinded adjunctive treatment with 
once-weekly subcutaneous exenatide (n = 23) or placebo (n = 22) injections for 3 
months. The primary outcome was loss of body weight after treatment and repeated 
measures analysis of variance was used as statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Between March 2013 and June 2015, 40 patients completed the trial. At 
baseline, mean body weight was 118.3 ± 16.0 kg in the exenatide group and 111.7 
± 18.0 kg in the placebo group, with no group differences ( P = .23). The 
exenatide and placebo groups experienced significant ( P = .004), however 
similar ( P = .98), weight losses of 2.24 ± 3.3 and 2.23 ± 4.4 kg, respectively, 
after 3 months of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with exenatide once-weekly did not promote weight loss in 
obese, antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia compared to placebo. 
Our results could suggest that the body weight-lowering effect of GLP-1RAs 
involves dopaminergic signaling, but blockade of other receptor systems may also 
play a role. Nevertheless, anti-obesity regimens effective in the general 
population may not be readily implemented in antipsychotic-treated patients with 
schizophrenia.

INTRODUCTION: Ukraine occupies the 143 place in the world in life expectancy and 
the first place in terms of mortality. The main cause of death - cardiovascular 
diseases - 58%. Recent studies show the important and independent role of 
endothelium in the development of cardiovascular disease.
THE AIM: examination of the endothelium destruction in aging men by determining 
the level of surface specific antigens of endothelial microparticles.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 88 men age from 45 to 76 years. 50 people of the main 
group had a history of the second type diabetes mellitus (DM-2) combined with 
arterial hypertension (AH). The control group included 38 men without 
aforementioned diseases. Also, men were divided into two groups by age: 45-59 
years and over 60.
RESULTS: in the main subgroup I endothelin level was higher than the control 
subgroup I: 2,07 ± 0,6 and 1,27 ± 0,25 (p <0.05). In main subgroup II endothelin 
level was also significantly higher compared with the specified index in control 
subgroup II: 3,91 ± 0,7 and 1,79 ± 0,27 (p <0.05). Among patients of the main 
subgroup II endothelin level (3,88 ± 0,7 and 2,04 ± 0,6 (p <0.05)), and 
triglycerides (2,77 ± 0,08 vs. 1.99 ± 0.05 (p <0.05)) was higher compared with 
the I subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS: age androgen deficiency is accompanied by lipid metabolism, 
development of endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, diabetes and 
hypertension. Reduction of the cardiovascular risk includes measures aimed at 
normalizing hormonal balance and lipid metabolism in aging men with DM-2 and 
hypertension.

OBJECTIVES: Kids in Control OF Food (KICk-OFF) is a 5-day structured education 
program for 11- to 16-year-olds with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who are 
using multiple daily insulin injections. This study evaluates the 
cost-effectiveness of the KICk-OFF education program compared with the usual 
care using data from the KICk-OFF trial.
METHODS: The short-term within-trial analysis covers the 2-year postintervention 
period. Data on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), severe hypoglycemia, and diabetic 
ketoacidosis (DKA) were collected over a 2-year follow-up period. Sub-group 
analyses have been defined on the basis of baseline HbA1c being below 7.5 
percent (58.5 mmol/mol) (low group), between 7.5 percent and 9.5 percent (80.3 
mmol/mol) (medium group), and over 9.5 percent (high group). The long-term 
cost-effectiveness evaluation has been conducted by using The Sheffield Type 1 
Diabetes Policy Model, which is a patient-level simulation model on T1DM. It 
includes long-term microvascular (retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy) and 
macrovascular (myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and angina) 
diabetes-related complications and acute adverse events (severe hypoglycemia and 
DKA).
RESULTS: The most favorable within-trial scenario for the KICk-OFF arm led to an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £23,688 (base year 2009) with a 
cost-effectiveness probability of 41.3 percent. Simulating the long-term 
complications using the full cohort data, the mean ICER for the base case was 
£28,813 (base year 2011) and the probability of the KICk-OFF intervention being 
cost-effective at £20,000/QALY threshold was 42.6 percent, with considerable 
variation due to treatment effect duration. For the high HbA1c sub-group, the 
KICk-OFF arm was "dominant" (meaning it provided better health gains at lower 
costs than usual care) over the usual care arm in each scenario considered.
CONCLUSIONS: For the whole study population, the cost-effectiveness of KICk-OFF 
depends on the assumption for treatment effect duration. For the high baseline 
HbA1c sub-group, KICk-OFF arm was estimated to be dominant over the usual care 
arm regardless of the assumption on the treatment effect duration.

Headache disorders cause significant disability. The public and most health 
professionals tend to perceive migraine as a minor or trivial complaint. In the 
past decade, important epidemiologic studies enjoining extensive surveys, 
pathophysiologic and genetic insights, and revised headache classification 
paradigms have produced clear evidence of the public health importance of 
headache disorders. The Global Campaign to reduce the burden of headache 
worldwide known as "Lifting the Burden" was launched in 2004 by the World Health 
Organization, the International Headache Society, the World Headache Alliance, 
and the European Headache Federation. This paper reviews salient progress in the 
neuroepidemiology of migraine headaches.

The extraordinarily long lifespans of queens (and kings) in eusocial insects and 
the strikingly large differences in life expectancy between workers and queens 
challenge our understanding of the evolution of aging and provide unique 
opportunities for studying the causes underlying adaptive variation in lifespan 
within species. Here we review the major evolutionary theories of aging, 
focusing on their scope and limitations when applied to social insects. We show 
that reproductive division of labor, interactions between kin, caste-specific 
gene regulation networks, and the integration of colony-level trade-offs with 
individual-level trade-offs provide challenges to the classical theories We 
briefly indicate how these challenges could be met in future models of adaptive 
phenotypic plasticity in lifespan between and within different castes.

Comment in
    Lancet. 2016 Nov 12;388(10058):2330-2331.

BACKGROUND: Child and maternal health outcomes have notably improved in Mexico 
since 1990, whereas rising adult mortality rates defy traditional 
epidemiological transition models in which decreased death rates occur across 
all ages. These trends suggest Mexico is experiencing a more complex, dissonant 
health transition than historically observed. Enduring inequalities between 
states further emphasise the need for more detailed health assessments over 
time. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2013 (GBD 
2013) provides the comprehensive, comparable framework through which such 
national and subnational analyses can occur. This study offers a state-level 
quantification of disease burden and risk factor attribution in Mexico for the 
first time.
METHODS: We extracted data from GBD 2013 to assess mortality, causes of death, 
years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and healthy life expectancy (HALE) in 
Mexico and its 32 states, along with eight comparator countries in the Americas. 
States were grouped by Marginalisation Index scores to compare subnational 
burden along a socioeconomic dimension. We split extracted data by state and 
applied GBD methods to generate estimates of burden, and attributable burden due 
to behavioural, metabolic, and environmental or occupational risks. We present 
results for 306 causes, 2337 sequelae, and 79 risk factors.
FINDINGS: From 1990 to 2013, life expectancy from birth in Mexico increased by 
3·4 years (95% uncertainty interval 3·1-3·8), from 72·1 years (71·8-72·3) to 
75·5 years (75·3-75·7), and these gains were more pronounced in states with high 
marginalisation. Nationally, age-standardised death rates fell 13·3% 
(11·9-14·6%) since 1990, but state-level reductions for all-cause mortality 
varied and gaps between life expectancy and years lived in full health, as 
measured by HALE, widened in several states. Progress in women's life expectancy 
exceeded that of men, in whom negligible improvements were observed since 2000. 
For many states, this trend corresponded with rising YLL rates from 
interpersonal violence and chronic kidney disease. Nationally, age-standardised 
YLL rates for diarrhoeal diseases and protein-energy malnutrition markedly 
decreased, ranking Mexico well above comparator countries. However, amid 
Mexico's progress against communicable diseases, chronic kidney disease burden 
rapidly climbed, with age-standardised YLL and DALY rates increasing more than 
130% by 2013. For women, DALY rates from breast cancer also increased since 
1990, rising 12·1% (4·6-23·1%). In 2013, the leading five causes of DALYs were 
diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, low back and neck 
pain, and depressive disorders; the latter three were not among the leading five 
causes in 1990, further underscoring Mexico's rapid epidemiological transition. 
Leading risk factors for disease burden in 1990, such as undernutrition, were 
replaced by high fasting plasma glucose and high body-mass index by 2013. 
Attributable burden due to dietary risks also increased, accounting for more 
than 10% of DALYs in 2013.
INTERPRETATION: Mexico achieved sizeable reductions in burden due to several 
causes, such as diarrhoeal diseases, and risks factors, such as undernutrition 
and poor sanitation, which were mainly associated with maternal and child health 
interventions. Yet rising adult mortality rates from chronic kidney disease, 
diabetes, cirrhosis, and, since 2000, interpersonal violence drove deteriorating 
health outcomes, particularly in men. Although state inequalities from 
communicable diseases narrowed over time, non-communicable diseases and injury 
burdens varied markedly at local levels. The dissonance with which Mexico and 
its 32 states are experiencing epidemiological transitions might strain 
health-system responsiveness and performance, which stresses the importance of 
timely, evidence-informed health policies and programmes linked to the health 
needs of each state.

OBJECTIVES: Octogenarians considered for cardiac surgery encounter more 
complications than other patients. Postoperative complications raise the 
question of continuation of high-cost care for patients with limited life 
expectancy. Duration of hospitalization in intensive care after cardiac surgery 
may differ between octogenarians and other patients. The objectives were 
evaluating the mortality rate of octogenarians experiencing prolonged 
hospitalization in intensive care and defining the best cut-off for prolonged 
intensive care unit length of stay.
DESIGN: A single-center observational study.
SETTING: A postoperative surgical intensive care unit in a tertiary teaching 
hospital in Paris, France.
PARTICIPANTS: All consecutive patients older than 80 years considered for aortic 
valve replacement for aortic stenosis were included.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mortality rate was determined among patients 
experiencing prolonged stay in intensive care with organ failure and without 
organ failure. An ROC curve determined the optimal cut-off defining prolonged 
hospitalization in intensive care according to the occurrence of postoperative 
complications. Multivariate analysis determined risk factors for early death or 
prolonged intensive care stay. The optimal cut-off defining prolonged intensive 
care unit length of stay was 4 days. Low ventricular ejection fraction (odds 
ratio [OR] = 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-0.83; p = 0.0016), coronary 
disease (OR = 2.34; 95% CI 1.19-4.85; p = 0.014), and need for catecholamine (OR 
= 2.79; 95% CI 1.33-5.88; p = 0.0068) were associated with eventful 
postoperative course. There was not a hospitalization duration beyond which the 
prognosis significantly worsened.
CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged length of stay in ICU without organ failure is not 
associated with increased mortality. No specific duration of hospitalization in 
intensive care was associated with increased mortality. Continuation of care 
should be discussed on an individual basis.

BACKGROUND: The post-2015 End TB Strategy sets global targets of reducing 
tuberculosis incidence by 50% and mortality by 75% by 2025. We aimed to assess 
resource requirements and cost-effectiveness of strategies to achieve these 
targets in China, India, and South Africa.
METHODS: We examined intervention scenarios developed in consultation with 
country stakeholders, which scaled up existing interventions to high but 
feasible coverage by 2025. Nine independent modelling groups collaborated to 
estimate policy outcomes, and we estimated the cost of each scenario by 
synthesising service use estimates, empirical cost data, and expert opinion on 
implementation strategies. We estimated health effects (ie, disability-adjusted 
life-years averted) and resource implications for 2016-35, including 
patient-incurred costs. To assess resource requirements and cost-effectiveness, 
we compared scenarios with a base case representing continued current practice.
FINDINGS: Incremental tuberculosis service costs differed by scenario and 
country, and in some cases they more than doubled existing funding needs. In 
general, expansion of tuberculosis services substantially reduced 
patient-incurred costs and, in India and China, produced net cost savings for
