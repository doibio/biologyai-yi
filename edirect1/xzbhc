Muscle injury frequently occurs in the medial head of the gastrocnemius (MG), 
and stretching is used for treatment. However, there are no studies based on 
anatomical considerations and biomechanics. This study therefore examined the 
macroscopic anatomical structure of the triceps surae muscle to design an 
effective and selective MG stretching method, before quantitatively verifying 
that method by ultrasonography. The macroscopic anatomy was analyzed in 16 
Japanese cadavers (25 legs). Based on the anatomical findings and the 
arrangement of fascicles in the MG, we concluded that ankle inversion might be 
advantageous for selective stretching of the tendon fiber bundles into which the 
MG inserts. We devised a method in which the limb was initially positioned with 
the knee joint in extension and the ankle joint in plantar flexion. Then, the 
ankle was dorsiflexed and inverted. The proposed method was compared with 
standard stretching and verified by ultrasonography in eight healthy adult 
males. This method effectively and selectively stretched the MG, producing a 
significantly decreased pennation angle and increased muscle fiber length. This 
method may be beneficial for preventing future injuries and may enhance the 
effect of therapy on the MG.

PMP22 related neuropathies: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A and Hereditary 
Neuropathy with liability to Pressure Palsies.

PMP22 related neuropathies comprise (1) PMP22 duplications leading to 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), (2) PMP22 deletions, leading to 
Hereditary Neuropathy with liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP), and (3) PMP22 
point mutations, causing both phenotypes. Overall prevalence of CMT is usually 
reported as 1:2,500, epidemiological studies show that 20-64% of CMT patients 
carry the PMP22 duplication. The prevalence of HNPP is not well known. CMT1A 
usually presents in the first two decades with difficulty walking or running. 
Distal symmetrical muscle weakness and wasting and sensory loss is present, legs 
more frequently and more severely affected than arms. HNPP typically leads to 
episodic, painless, recurrent, focal motor and sensory peripheral neuropathy, 
preceded by minor compression on the affected nerve. Electrophysiological 
evaluation is needed to determine whether the polyneuropathy is demyelinating. 
Sonography of the nerves can be useful. Diagnosis is confirmed by finding 
respectively a PMP22 duplication, deletion or point mutation. Differential 
diagnosis includes other inherited neuropathies, and acquired polyneuropathies. 
The mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant and de novo mutations occur. 
Offspring of patients have a chance of 50% to inherit the mutation from their 
affected parent. Prenatal testing is possible; requests for prenatal testing are 
not common. Treatment is currently symptomatic and may include management by a 
rehabilitation physician, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and 
orthopaedic surgeon. Adult CMT1A patients show slow clinical progression of 
disease, which seems to reflect a process of normal ageing. Life expectancy is 
normal.

Based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Eco-indicator 99 method, a LCA model 
was applied to conduct environmental impact and end-of-life treatment policy 
analysis for secondary batteries. This model evaluated the cycle, recycle and 
waste treatment stages of secondary batteries. Nickel-Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) 
batteries and Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries were chosen as the typical 
secondary batteries in this study. Through this research, the following results 
were found: (1) A basic number of cycles should be defined. A minimum cycle 
number of 200 would result in an obvious decline of environmental loads for both 
battery types. Batteries with high energy density and long life expectancy have 
small environmental loads. Products and technology that help increase energy 
density and life expectancy should be encouraged. (2) Secondary batteries should 
be sorted out from municipal garbage. Meanwhile, different types of discarded 
batteries should be treated separately under policies and regulations. (3) The 
incineration rate has obvious impact on the Eco-indicator points of Nickel-Metal 
Hydride (Ni-MH) batteries. The influence of recycle rate on Lithium ion (Li-ion) 
batteries is more obvious. These findings indicate that recycling is the most 
promising direction for reducing secondary batteries' environmental loads. The 
model proposed here can be used to evaluate environmental loads of other 
secondary batteries and it can be useful for proposing policies and 
countermeasures to reduce the environmental impact of secondary batteries.

Reintervention following endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair is uncommon 
after five-years: results of greater than a decade follow-up.

Manchester, Manchester, UK - lauratod@doctors.org.uk.

BACKGROUND: Endovascular aneurysm repair offers improved perioperative morbidity 
and mortality compared to open repair, counterbalanced by a higher incidence of 
graft-related complications and re-interventions. Randomized studies comparing 
EVAR to open repair are yet to report greater than ten-year outcomes. This study 
reports the outcomes of patients who underwent EVAR greater than ten years ago.
METHODS: Retrospective review of prospectively collected data of all patients 
who underwent EVAR between 1997 and 2001, supplemented with case-note review, 
interrogation of imaging and correspondence with general practitioners and 
coroners' offices.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients underwent EVAR. Technical success was 100% and 
30-day mortality was 0%. The re-intervention rate was 27.3%, including 5 
elective open conversions, 2 emergency open repairs, 5 embolizations of 
endoleaks and 3 extensions. Median time to primary re-intervention was 30 months 
(1-98). Four graft related complications occurred beyond 5 years however only 
one reintervention was performed beyond this time point. Four patients died from 
ruptured AAA.
CONCLUSIONS: Stable long-term aneurysm exclusion was achieved in the majority of 
patients with most re-interventions occurring early in the follow up period. 
Whilst life-long surveillance should be continued, these data raise the question 
of the appropriate duration of CT surveillance and suggest that EVAR should be 
considered for patients with longer life expectancy and favourable anatomy who 
traditionally would have undergone open repair.

Integrated disease prevention campaigns: assessing country opportunity for 
implementation via an index approach.

OBJECTIVES: To help stakeholders identify and prioritise countries with the best 
opportunities for implementation of an integrated prevention campaign (IPC) 
focused on diarrhoea, malaria and HIV prevention.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of country-specific epidemiological data using 
an index tool developed for this purpose.
SETTING: We calculated the total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
attributed to diarrhoea, malaria and HIV for 214 World Bank economies. Criteria 
for inclusion were: low-income and middle-income countries, and total annual 
DALY burden in the top tertile (â¥87 000 DALYs). 70 countries met inclusion 
criteria and were included in our opportunity analysis.
OUTCOME MEASURES: We synthesised data on 10 indicators related to the potential 
reduction in burden and new coverage achievable by an IPC. We scored and ranked 
countries based on three summary opportunity metrics: DALYs per capita across 
the diseases, a composite score of tertile rankings of burden for each disease, 
and a score combining burden and intervention opportunity.
RESULTS: We estimated the total annual global burden attributable to diarrhoea, 
malaria and HIV at 135 million DALYs. All of the countries with the highest 
opportunity for implementation of a diarrhoea, malaria and HIV IPC are in 
sub-Saharan Africa, regardless of opportunity metric used. Although the overall 
rank order changes, 16 countries rank among the top 23 highest opportunity 
countries for all three metrics.
CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders can use this objective metric-based approach to 
prioritise countries for IPC scale-up. Priority countries are largely robust to 
the opportunity metric chosen.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) lowered quality of life and shortened life expectancy 
amongst those affected. Evidence indicates interaction between advanced 
glycation end products (AGEs), activated protein kinase C (PKC) and angiotensin 
II exacerbate the progression of DN. Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme 
(ACEIs), renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), AGEs, and PKC have been 
tested for slowing down the progression of DN. The exact molecular drug targets 
that lead to the amelioration of renal injury in DN are not well understood. 
This review summarizes the potential therapeutic targets, based on putative 
mechanism in the progression of the disease.

Lung cancer is one of the most commonly encountered human malignancies. Due to 
the increase in life expectancy as well as the incidence of lung cancer, the 
incidence of senile lung cancer has increased significantly. We conducted a 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gefitinib combined with Î³-ray 
stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as the first-line treatment regimen 
for senile patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung. A total of 122 senile 
patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung were divided into 3 groups according to 
the treatment method. Group A included 35 patients treated with gefitinib 
combined with Î³-ray SBRT, group B included 45 patients treated with Î³-ray SBRT 
alone and group C included 42 patients treated with gefitinib alone. The 
patients received 250 mg of gefitinib per day, from the first day of the 
treatment until disease progression or discontinuation due to other causes. The 
patients were treated with Î³-ray SBRT, initiated on the second day. The dose 
curve for this case group was 50-80%. The encircled dose was 4.0-6.5 Gy per 
fraction and the range of the total radiation dose was 36-48 Gy. The total 
number of treatments was 8-12, at a frequency of 5 times per week. All 122 
patients were assessed by contrast-enhanced double helical computed tomography 
(CT) at 2 months. The tumor response rate (RR) of group A was 68.6% (24/35), the 
disease control rate (DCR) was 88.6% (31/35), the median overall survival (OS) 
was 15.5 months (range, 3-52 months) and the progression-free survival (PFS) was 
7.8 months. The 1-year OS rate was 40.0% (14/35). The main side effects included 
skin rash and diarrhea. The RR of group B was 51.1% (23/45), the DCR was 71.1% 
(32/45), the OS was 9.6 months (range, 3-22 months) and the PFS was 5.3 months. 
The 1-year OS rate was 15.6% (7/45). The RR of group C was 40.5% (17/42), the 
DCR was 61.9% (26/42), the OS was 10.3 months (range, 3-26 months) and the PFS 
was 5.1 months. The 1-year OS rate was 35.7% (15/42). The main side effects 
included skin rash and diarrhea. The short-term therapeutic effect (RR) in group 
A was higher compared to that in group C (P=0.014, Ï2=6.053); however, there was 
no significant difference compared to group B (P=0.116, Ï2=2.477). The PFS of 
group A was higher compared with that of groups B and C (7.8 vs. 5.9, P=0.018 
and 7.8 vs. 5.1, P=0.013, respectively). The OS of group A was higher compared 
with that of groups B and C (15.5 vs. 9.6, P=0.002 and 15.5 vs. 10.3, P=0.017, 
respectively). No significant differences were observed in PFS and OS between 
groups B and C. In conclusion, gefitinib combined with Î³-ray SBRT appears to be 
feasible and effective as the first-line treatment in senile patients with 
adenocarcinoma of the lungs.

Head and neck tumors are a major health concern worldwide, due to their high 
incidence and mortality rates, particularly in developing countries. In Brazil, 
this type of cancer is commonly diagnosed and studies suggested that it may be 
the leading cause of mortality in the country. The increase in life expectancy 
worldwide, as well as environmental and behavioral factors, are related to 
carcinogenesis. Therefore, an understanding of basic epidemiology and 
statistical methods is critical, in order to promote early diagnosis and cancer 
prevention. Cancer patients with an indication for prosthesis were selected from 
the medical records of the Oral Oncology Center, School of Dentistry, SÃ£o Paulo 
State University (UNESP), AraÃ§atuba, between 1991 and 2010. The following 
variables were recorded: gender, age, type and location of the lesion, radiation 
dose and dental prosthesis. The majority of the patients were male (74.15%) and 
>60 years of age (53.37%). Tumors were most commonly located in the floor of the 
mouth (11.1%) and squamous cell carcinoma was the most prevalent type (72.8%). 
This study provides the profiles of patients who attended the Oral Oncology 
Center and the results may aid in the creation of cancer prevention programs.

Objective. To identify modifiable cardio-metabolic and lifestyle risk factors 
among indigenous populations from Australia (Aboriginal Australians/Torres 
Strait Islanders), New Zealand (MÄori), and the United States (American Indians 
and Alaska Natives) that contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods. 
National health surveys were identified where available. Electronic databases 
identified sources for filling missing data. The most relevant data were 
identified, organized, and synthesized. Results. Compared to their 
non-indigenous counterparts, indigenous populations exhibit lower life 
expectancies and a greater prevalence of CVD. All indigenous populations have 
higher rates of obesity and diabetes, hypertension is greater for MÄori and 
Aboriginal Australians, and high cholesterol is greater only among American 
Indians/Alaska Natives. In turn, all indigenous groups exhibit higher rates of 
smoking and dangerous alcohol behaviour as well as consuming less fruits and 
vegetables. Aboriginal Australians and American Indians/Alaska Natives also 
exhibit greater rates of sedentary behaviour. Conclusion. Indigenous groups from 
Australia, New Zealand, and the United States have a lower life expectancy then 
their respective non-indigenous counterparts. A higher prevalence of CVD is a 
major driving force behind this discrepancy. A cluster of modifiable 
cardio-metabolic risk factors precede CVD, which, in turn, is linked to 
modifiable lifestyle risk factors.

Author information:
(1)Department of Geriatric Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, The University 
of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

Age-related cognitive decline is a main predictor of disability among elderly 
people, and with the continued expansion of the aging population and the 
increase in life expectancy, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and 
dementia represented by Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a multifactorial 
neurodegenerative disorder of older adults, have increased. Recent 
epidemiological and observational studies suggest a relationship exists between 
lifestyle factors, including nutrition and diet, and cognitive function in aging 
adults. It is also suggested that malnutrition and nutrient deficiencies are 
associated with cognitive decline in patients with dementia. There are a variety 
of nutritional factors, including nutritional status and dietary patterns, that 
might be associated with cognitive function, and specific micronutrients and 
dietary components have been suggested to have an association with cognitive 
function as well. Based on these findings and evidence, evaluation of 
nutritional state, as well as nutritional intervention, might be able to play a 
role in the management and prevention of dementia.

Assessment, LinkÃ¶ping University , LinkÃ¶ping , Sweden.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating patients with acute 
coronary syndromes (ACS) for 12 months with ticagrelor compared with generic 
clopidogrel in Sweden and Denmark.
DESIGN: Decision-analytic model to estimate lifetime costs, life-expectancy, and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with ticagrelor and clopidogrel. Event 
rates, healthcare resource use, and health-related quality of life during 12 
months of therapy were estimated from the PLATelet inhibition and patient 
Outcomes (PLATO) trial. Beyond 12 months, quality-adjusted survival and costs 
were estimated conditional on events occurring during the 12 months of therapy. 
When available, country-specific data were employed in the analysis. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios are presented from a healthcare perspective and a 
broader societal perspective including costs falling outside the healthcare 
sector in 2010 local currency.
RESULTS: The cost per QALY with ticagrelor compared with generic clopidogrel was 
SEK 25 022 and DKK 26 892 for Sweden and Denmark, respectively, from a 
healthcare perspective. The cost per QALY from a broader societal perspective 
was SEK 24 290 and DKK 25 051 for Sweden and Denmark, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The cost per QALY of treating ACS-patients with ticagrelor compared 
with generic clopidogrel is below the conventional thresholds of 
cost-effectiveness in Sweden and Denmark.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: In treatment-naive patients mono-infected with genotype 1 
chronic HCV, treatments with telaprevir/boceprevir (TVR/BOC)-based triple 
therapy are standard-of-care. However, more efficacious direct-acting antivirals 
(IFN-based new DAAs) are available and interferon-free (IFN-free) regimens are 
imminent (2015).
METHODS: A mathematical model estimated quality-adjusted life years, cost and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of (i) IFN-based new DAAs vs. 
TVR/BOC-based triple therapy; and (ii) IFN-based new DAAs initiation strategies, 
given that IFN-free regimens are imminent. The sustained virological response in 
F3-4/F0-2 was 71/89% with IFN-based new DAAs, 85/95% with IFN-free regimens, vs. 
64/80% with TVR/BOC-based triple therapy. Serious adverse events leading to 
discontinuation were taken as: 0-0.6% with IFN-based new DAAs, 0% with IFN-free 
regimens, vs. 1-10% with TVR/BOC-based triple therapy. Costs were â¬60,000 for 
12weeks of IFN-based new DAAs and two times higher for IFN-free regimens.
RESULTS: Treatment with IFN-based new DAAs when fibrosis stage â©¾F2 is 
cost-effective compared to TVR/BOC-based triple therapy (â¬37,900/QALY gained), 
but not at F0-1 (â¬103,500/QALY gained). Awaiting the IFN-free regimens is more 
effective, except in F4 patients, but not cost-effective compared to IFN-based 
new DAAs. If we decrease the cost of IFN-free regimens close to that of 
IFN-based new DAAs, then awaiting the IFN-free regimen becomes cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with IFN-based new DAAs at stage â©¾F2 is both effective 
and cost-effective compared to TVR/BOC triple therapy. Awaiting IFN-free 
regimens and then treating regardless of fibrosis is more efficacious, except in 
F4 patients; however, the cost-effectiveness of this strategy is highly 
dependent on its cost.

Economic evaluation of a web-based tailored lifestyle intervention for adults: 
findings regarding cost-effectiveness and cost-utility from a randomized 
controlled trial.

BACKGROUND: Different studies have reported the effectiveness of Web-based 
computer-tailored lifestyle interventions, but economic evaluations of these 
interventions are scarce.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility 
of a sequential and a simultaneous Web-based computer-tailored lifestyle 
intervention for adults compared to a control group.
METHODS: The economic evaluation, conducted from a societal perspective, was 
part of a 2-year randomized controlled trial including 3 study groups. All 
groups received personalized health risk appraisals based on the guidelines for 
physical activity, fruit intake, vegetable intake, alcohol consumption, and 
smoking. Additionally, respondents in the sequential condition received personal 
advice about one lifestyle behavior in the first year and a second behavior in 
the second year; respondents in the simultaneous condition received personal 
advice about all unhealthy behaviors in both years. During a period of 24 
months, health care use, medication use, absenteeism from work, and quality of 
life (EQ-5D-3L) were assessed every 3 months using Web-based questionnaires. 
Demographics were assessed at baseline, and lifestyle behaviors were assessed at 
both baseline and after 24 months. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses 
were performed based on the outcome measures lifestyle factor (the number of 
guidelines respondents adhered to) and quality of life, respectively. We 
accounted for uncertainty by using bootstrapping techniques and sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 1733 respondents were included in the analyses. From a 
willingness to pay of â¬4594 per additional guideline met, the sequential 
intervention (n=552) was likely to be the most cost-effective, whereas from a 
willingness to pay of â¬10,850, the simultaneous intervention (n=517) was likely 
to be most cost-effective. The control condition (n=664) appeared to be 
preferred with regard to quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the sequential and the simultaneous lifestyle interventions 
were likely to be cost-effective when it concerned the lifestyle factor, whereas 
the control condition was when it concerned quality of life. However, there is 
no accepted cutoff point for the willingness to pay per gain in lifestyle 
behaviors, making it impossible to draw firm conclusions. Further economic 
evaluations of lifestyle interventions are needed.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)-infected patients appears to be coupled with increased incidence of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD).
AIM: The aim of our study was to determine the presence of early atherosclerosis 
among Slovenian HIV-infected patients below the age of 55 years.
METHODS: A total of 86 HIV-infected male patients below the age of 55 years 
participated in our study. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured using a 
handheld Doppler ultrasonic probe and a blood pressure cuff. Carotid 
intima-media thickness (CIMT) was assessed by the B-mode high-resolution 
ultrasound technique. Low ABI, CIMT >â0.8Â mm or presence of carotid plaques were 
considered markers of early atherosclerosis.
RESULTS: Average CIMT was lowest among treatment-naÃ¯ve patients (0.65Â mm); 10 
(38.4â%) had CIMT >â0.8Â mm, and carotid plaques were detected in 1 (3.8â%). 
Average CIMT among treated patients was 0.71Â mm; 30 (50.0â%) had CIMT >â0.8Â mm, 
and plaques were detected in 11 (18.3â%). Low ABI (â¤â0.90) was found in five 
patients (5.8â%) without symptoms of peripheral artery disease; two were 
treatment-naÃ¯ve, and three received antiretroviral therapy. Early 
atherosclerosis was found in 43 (50.0â%) patients; 10 (38.4â%) were in 
treatment-naÃ¯ve and 33 (55.0â%) in the treated group.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased prevalence of early atherosclerosis among Slovenian 
HIV-infected patients below the age of 55 years has been demonstrated. Screening 
for early atherosclerosis should be implemented in the evaluation of young 
HIV-infected patients because a more aggressive treatment approach, aimed to 
delay the progression of atherosclerosis, may be warranted especially when 
carotid plaques are detected. We have shown that although ABI contributes to CVD 
risk assessment, CIMT assessment remains the more sensitive method.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy is one of the measurements that have been used to 
monitor socioeconomic development within and among countries. During the last 30 
years, life expectancy has increased worldwide mainly due to medical and 
technological developments. However, access to health care, new technologies and 
social determinants remain unevenly distributed among regions and countries in 
the world.
OBJECTIVE: To assess inequalities in life expectancy by gender and regions 
(departments) in Colombia between 2000 and 2009.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ecological study. Life expectancy was estimated for each 
Colombian department using yearly life tables from 2000 to 2009. We used data 
from the death registries and the estimated population series, provided by the 
Departamento Administrativo Nacional de EstadÃ­stica (DANE). For the study 
period, estimates of life expectancy by departments were compared with those 
from Japan for the years 2000, 2006 and 2009, which is the country with the 
highest life expectancy in the world, and with the Colombian department with the 
highest life expectancy from 2000 to 2009.
RESULTS: Compared with the highest life expectancy in the world, Colombian 
departments showed differences ranged between 5.7 and 21 years. We found 
significant differences between departments, with the largest difference being 
15.3 years. Additionally, in some departments life expectancy decreased during 
the analyzed period.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified differences in life expectancy in Colombian 
departments suggesting inequalities in health and living conditions among them. 
These differences increased in some departments during the period 2000-2009.

This study aimed to explore the structural contributions of socioeconomic status 
(SES), comorbidity, and activity limitation to the healthy life expectancy 
(HALE) of Japanese suburban elderly. A questionnaire survey was distributed to 
all residents aged 65 years and older in Tama City, Tokyo, in 2001; a follow-up 
study was conducted in 2004; and individual vital status data from the municipal 
residents' registry were tracked until 2007. In all, 7,905 respondents were 
included for analysis. Data analysis was performed by structural equation 
modeling (SEM). The data were well fit by the models, and HALE was found to be 
well explained by SES, comorbidity, and activity limitation (R (2) = .59 for men 
and R (2) = .71 for women). In conclusion, elderly people with higher SES were 
more likely to live longer with good self-rated health, via living with less 
chronic diseases and better performance in daily living activities, especially 
for elderly women.

Radiation therapy in malignant spinal cord compression: what is the current 
knowledge on fractionation schedules? A systematic literature review.

LÃ¸hre ET(1), Lund JÃ, Kaasa S.

Author information:

Hospital, Trondheim, Norway.

Malignant spinal cord compression (MSCC) in patients with short life expectancy 
is most frequently treated with radiotherapy and/or corticosteroids. 
Hypofractionation has been proven to be efficient in metastatic bone pain, but 
the level of evidence for hypofractionation in MSCC is limited. Searches were 
performed in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library for all relevant articles. 
Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified. The first RCT compared 
hypofractionation (8 gray (Gy)Ã2) with a more fractionated regimen. No 
differences in symptom control, duration of response or survival were detected. 
The second RCT compared 8 GyÃ2 with 8 GyÃ1. No significant differences in 
symptom control, duration of response or survival were detected. Five 
prospective non-randomised studies identified no differences in post-treatment 
motor function. Of 17 identified retrospective studies the largest included 1304 
patients, treated with five different regimens ranging from 8 GyÃ1 to 2 GyÃ20, 
and found similar post-treatment ambulatory status. A Cochrane review based on 
the first published RCT concluded that short courses of radiotherapy appear to 
be justified in patients with a poor prognosis.

Unprotected left main percutaneous coronary intervention in a 108-year-old 
patient.

Rahman A(1), Islam AM(1).

Author information:

Dhaka, Bangladesh.

With the increase in life expectancy, the proportion of very elderly people is 
increasing. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is an important cause of mortality and 
morbidity in this age group, for which myocardial revascularization is often 
indicated. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the very elderly bears 
the inherent risks of complications and mortality, but the potential benefits 
may outweigh these risks. A number of observational studies, registries, and few 
randomized controlled trials have shown the safety and feasibility of PCI in 
octogenarians and nonagenarians. However, PCI is only rarely done in 
centenarians; so, the outcome of percutaneous coronary revascularization in this 
age group is largely unknown. PCI in a centenarian with complex CAD is described 
here; the patient presented with unstable angina despite optimum medical 
therapy, and surgery was declined. Good angiographic success was followed by 
non-cardiac complications, which were managed with a multidisciplinary approach.

Continuous palliative sedation until death: practice after introduction of the 
Dutch national guideline.

Swart SJ(1), van der Heide A, Brinkkemper T, van Zuylen L, Perez R, Rietjens J.

Author information:
(1)Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam.

BACKGROUND: In 2005, a national palliative guideline was launched in The 
Netherlands. The authors describe the practice of continuous palliative sedation 
until death (CPS) after the introduction of this guideline.
METHODS: In 2008, a random sample of physicians (n=1580) were asked to fill out 
a questionnaire regarding the last patient in whom they had provided CPS until 
death.
RESULTS: The response was 38%. In all, 82% of the respondents were aware of the 
existence of the national guideline. Dyspnoea, pain and physical exhaustion were 
most often mentioned as decisive indications for continuous sedation. The 
decision to use sedation was discussed with all competent patients, but in 18% 
this merely involved informing the patient. Life expectancy at the start of 
continuous sedation was estimated to be less than 2 weeks in 97% of the cases. 
In 14%, the physicians had felt pressure to start the sedation, predominantly 
from patients and relatives. Physicians were present at the start of the 
sedation in 81% of the cases. Midazolam was used to induce the sedation in 92%. 
Overall, 41% of the physicians estimated that continuous sedation had hastened 
death to some extent. Most physicians thought that patients' complaints were 
adequately relieved by continuous sedation, that relatives were satisfied and 
that a good quality of dying was achieved.
INTERPRETATION: Continuous palliative sedation practice in The Netherlands 
largely reflects the recommendations from the national guideline. Issues needing 
further attention are the pressure felt by physicians to start continuous 
sedation and the potential life-shortening effect as mentioned by the 
physicians.

Measuring patients' experiences with palliative care: the Consumer Quality Index 
Palliative Care.

Claessen SJ(1), Francke AL, Sixma HJ, de Veer AJ, Deliens L.

Author information:
(1)Department of Public and Occupational Health, VU University medical center, 
EMGO Institute for Health and Care Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: The Consumer Quality Index Palliative Care (CQ-index PC) is a 
structured questionnaire for measuring the quality of palliative care from the 
perspective of care users. CQ-indices assess which care aspects need quality 
improvement by relating answers about actual care experiences to answers about 
the importance of certain aspects of care.
METHODS: To improve the chance that the new instrument has good content 
validity, a literature study and individual and group discussions were 
performed, and a steering committee was consulted to establish the instrument's 
face and content validity. The questionnaire was administered to patients with a 
life expectancy of 6 months or less and/or who were receiving palliative 
treatment. Descriptive analyses were carried out on the items about actual care 
experiences and the importance of care aspects, and on 'need for improvement' 
scores.
RESULTS: 15 care organisations participated. 133 patients met the inclusion 
criteria (net response n=85). Patients considered the following aspects the most 
important: 'offering help in good time in acute situations', 'caregivers having 
the necessary expertise' and 'caregivers taking the patient seriously'. The 
three care aspects with the highest 'need for improvement' scores were: 'support 
when the patient feels depressed', 'support when the patient is anxious' and 
'support when the patient has shortness of breath'.
CONCLUSIONS: The CQ-index PC provides opportunities for care organisations to 
assess which care aspects have the highest priority for quality improvement 
within their organisation. Further research is needed to assess whether the 
instrument has enough discriminative power to assess differences between 
organisations.

Lung transplantation in patients with cystic fibrosis: special focus to 
infection and comorbidities.

Dorgan DJ(1), Hadjiliadis D.

Author information:
(1)Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care, Perelman School of 
Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

Despite advances in medical care, patients with cystic fibrosis still face 
limited life expectancy. The most common cause of death remains respiratory 
failure. End-stage cystic fibrosis can be treated with lung transplantation and 
is the third most common reason for which the procedure is performed. Outcomes 
for cystic fibrosis are better than most other lung diseases, but remain limited 
(5-year survival 60%). For patients with advanced disease lung transplantation 
appears to improve survival. Outcomes for patients with Burkholderia cepacia 
remain poor, although they are better for patients with certain genomovars. 
Controversy exists about Mycobacterium abscessus infection and appropriateness 
for transplant. More information is also becoming available for comorbidities, 
including diabetes and pulmonary hypertension among others. Extra-corporeal 
membrane oxygenation is used more frequently for end-stage disease as a bridge 
to lung transplantation and will likely be used more in the future.

BACKGROUND: The proportion of strokes occurring in younger adults has been 
rising over the past decade. Due to the far longer life expectancy in the young, 
stroke in this group has an even larger socio-economic impact. However, 
information on etiology and prognosis remains scarce.
METHODS/DESIGN: ODYSSEY is a multicentre prospective cohort study on the 
prognosis and risk factors of patients with a first-ever TIA, ischemic stroke or 
intracerebral hemorrhage aged 18 to 49 years. Our aim is to include 1500 
patients. Primary outcome will be all cause mortality and risk of recurrent 
vascular events. Secondary outcome will be the risk of post-stroke epilepsy and 
cognitive impairment. Patients will complete structured questionnaires on 
outcome measures and risk factors. Both well-documented and less well-documented 
risk factors and potentially acute trigger factors will be investigated. 
Patients will be followed every 6 months for at least 3 years. In addition, an 
extensive neuropsychological assessment will be administered both at baseline 
and 1 year after the stroke/TIA. Furthermore we will include 250 stroke-free 
controls, who will complete baseline assessment and one neuropsychological 
assessment.
DISCUSSION: ODYSSEY is designed to prospectively determine prognosis after a 
young stroke and get more insight into etiology of patients with a TIA, ischemic 
stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage in patients aged 18 to 49 years old in a 
large sample size.

This article focuses on the relevance that the dimension of the future has for 
promoting healthy and active aging. Older people generally have difficulties in 
talking about the future and when they do they generally express very negative 
perspectives on it. The data analyzed in this paper are part of an on-going 
interdisciplinary research project: "Aging, poverty and social exclusion: an 
interdisciplinary study on innovative support services" 
(https://apseclunl.wordpress.com/). The project aims at documenting good 
practices in social intervention with older people who are at risk of exclusion. 
This study describes and critically discusses an activity carried out in 
Portugal among older women in a poor area in the suburb of Lisbon entitled 
"self-awareness workshop on the future". Through a detailed discourse analysis 
within an ethnomethodological framework the study shows age membership 
categorizations in use and categorization processes, examining the workshop 
interaction. In particular, the article describes how the psychologist works at 
deconstructing and problematizing the negative connotations related to age 
membership categories. Taking into consideration the interactionally constructed 
nature of aging and the material consequences that different attitudes towards 
aging can imply is very important in particular in relation to the provision of 
services to older people.
