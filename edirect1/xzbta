OBJECTIVES: Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) among 65 year old men 
has been proven cost-effective, but nowadays is conducted partly under new 
conditions. The prevalence of AAA has decreased, and endovascular aneurysm 
repair (EVAR) has become the predominant surgical method for AAA repair in many 
centers. At the Malmö Vascular Center pharmacological secondary prevention with 
statins, antiplatelet therapy, and blood pressure reduction is initiated and 
given to all patients with AAA. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of 
AAA screening under the above mentioned conditions.
METHODS: This was a Markov cohort simulation. A total of 4,300 65 year old men 
were invited to annual AAA screening; the attendance rate was 78.3% and AAA 
prevalence was 1.8%. A Markov model with 11 health states was used to evaluate 
cost-effectiveness of AAA screening. Background data on rupture risks, costs, 
and effectiveness of surgical interventions were obtained from the participating 
unit, the national Swedvasc Registry, and from the scientific literature.
RESULTS: The additional costs of the screening strategy compared with no 
screening were €169 per person and year. The incremental health gain per subject 
in the screened cohort was 0.011 additional quality adjusted life years (QALYs), 
corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €15710 per 
QALY. Assuming a 10% reduction of all cause mortality, the incremental cost of 
screening was €175 per person and year. The gain per subject in the screened 
cohort was 0.013 additional QALYs, corresponding to an ICER of €13922 per QALY 
CONCLUSIONS: AAA screening remains cost-effective according to both the Swedish 
recommendations and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
recommendations in the new era of lower AAA prevalence, EVAR as the predominant 
surgical method, and secondary prevention for all AAA patients.

PURPOSE: Most women with unilateral breast cancer (BC) without BRCA1/2 gene 
mutations are at low risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC). One CBC 
risk-management option is contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM). While 
there is no evidence that CPM increases life-expectancy, its uptake is 
increasing. This study aimed to assess the validity of an extended 
social-cognition model, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), in predicting 
women's intentions to undergo CPM.
METHOD: Four hundred women previously treated for BC completed an online survey 
exploring demographic and disease factors, attitude, subjective norm, perceived 
behavioural control, anticipated regret, uncertainty avoidance, self-efficacy to 
not have CPM and intentions to undergo CPM in a common hypothetical 
decision-making scenario.
RESULTS: The TPB uniquely explained 25.7% of intention variance. Greater 
anticipated regret, uncertainty avoidance and lower self-efficacy to cope with 
not having CPM were associated with stronger CPM intentions, explaining an 
additional 7.7%, 10.6% and 2.9% respectively, of variance over and above the 
TPB. Women who had undergone CPM, had not attended university, and had children 
reported stronger CPM intentions.
CONCLUSIONS: A holistic understanding of CPM decision-making appears to require 
consideration beyond CBC risk, demographics and disease characteristics, 
exploring women's expectations about CPM outcomes, others' opinions, and 
avoidance of emotionality and difficulties associated with not undergoing 
surgery. This study provides a theoretical basis from which the complexity of 
CPM decision-making may be understood, and from which resources for patients and 
treating staff may be developed to support women's informed decision-making 
aligning with their personal values.

BACKGROUND: In the transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) years, very 
elderly patients with aortic stenosis (AS) are referred to surgery with 
reluctance despite excellent hospital outcomes. A poorly assessed outcome of 
discharged survivors might further overlook the actual efficacy of the surgical 
strategy in this cohort. We thus evaluated life-expectancy and functional 
results in discharged survivors over 85 years operated on for AS.
METHODS: Between January 2001 and December 2013, 57 consecutive patients aged 
≥85 years underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) with or without concomitant 
procedures at our institution. Late survival rate (SR), New York Heart 
Associaion (NYHA) functional class and quality of life (RAND SF-36) were 
assessed. SR and quality of life (QoL) were than compared to the contemporary 
general population matched for age and gender, as calculated by the Italian 
National Institute of Statistics.
RESULTS: Overall in-hospital mortality was 8.8% (5 pts). In patients without 
concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), in-hospital mortality was 
2.9%. Survival at 5 and 9 years was 57.7 ± 8.4% and 17.9 ± 11.4%, respectively. 
No predictors of late mortality including concomitant CABG were identified at 
Cox analysis. The mean NYHA class for long-term survivors improved from 3.1 to 
1.6 (p&lt;0.001). Survivors reported better QoL-scores compared to the age- and 
gender-matched contemporary general population in 4 RAND SF-36 domains. 
Life-expectancy resulted comparable to that predicted for the age and 
gender-matched general population.
CONCLUSIONS: Isolated AVR in patients aged ≥85 years can be performed with 
acceptable risk. Survivors improve in NYHA class and, when compared to age- and 
gender-matched individuals, show a similar life expectancy and a no lower QoL.

IMPORTANCE: There is substantial uncertainty about optimal glycemic control in 
older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
OBSERVATIONS: Four large randomized clinical trials (RCTs), ranging in size from 
1791 to 11,440 patients, provide the majority of the evidence used to guide 
diabetes therapy. Most RCTs of intensive vs standard glycemic control excluded 
adults older than 80 years, used surrogate end points to evaluate microvascular 
outcomes and provided limited data on which subgroups are most likely to benefit 
or be harmed by specific therapies. Available data from randomized clinical 
trials suggest that intensive glycemic control does not reduce major 
macrovascular events in older adults for at least 10 years. Furthermore, 
intensive glycemic control does not lead to improved patient-centered 
microvascular outcomes for at least 8 years. Data from randomized clinical 
trials consistently suggest that intensive glycemic control immediately 
increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia 1.5- to 3-fold. Based on these data 
and observational studies, for the majority of adults older than 65 years, the 
harms associated with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) target lower than 7.5% or higher 
than 9% are likely to outweigh the benefits. However, the optimal target depends 
on patient factors, medications used to reach the target, life expectancy, and 
patient preferences about treatment. If only medications with low treatment 
burden and hypoglycemia risk (such as metformin) are required, a lower HbA1c 
target may be appropriate. If patients strongly prefer to avoid injections or 
frequent fingerstick monitoring, a higher HbA1c target that obviates the need 
for insulin may be appropriate.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: High-quality evidence about glycemic treatment in 
older adults is lacking. Optimal decisions need to be made collaboratively with 
patients, incorporating the likelihood of benefits and harms and patient 
preferences about treatment and treatment burden. For the majority of older 
adults, an HbA1c target between 7.5% and 9% will maximize benefits and minimize 
harms.

Objectives The aim of the present study was to explore Aboriginal patients' 
lived experiences of cardiac care at a major metropolitan hospital in Melbourne. 
Methods The study was a qualitative study involving in-depth interviews with a 
purposive sample of 10 Aboriginal patients who had been treated in the 
cardiology unit at the study hospital during 2012-13. A phenomenological 
approach was used to analyse the data. Results Eight themes emerged from the 
data, each concerning various aspects of participants' experiences: 'dislike of 
hospitals', 'system failures', 'engagement with hospital staff', 'experiences of 
racism', 'health literacy and information needs', 'self-identifying as 
Aboriginal', 'family involvement in care' and 'going home and difficulties 
adapting'. Most participants had positive experiences of the cardiac care, but 
hospitalisation was often challenging because of a sense of dislocation and 
disorientation. The stress of hospitalisation was greatly mediated by positive 
engagements with staff, but at times exacerbated by system failures or negative 
experiences. Conclusion Cardiac crises are stressful and hospital stays were 
particularly disorienting for Aboriginal people dislocated from their home land 
and community. What is known about the topic? Aboriginal people have higher 
mortality rates due to cardiovascular diseases compared with other Australians. 
Along with different factors contributing to the life expectancy gap, Aboriginal 
people also face significant barriers in the use of the healthcare system. What 
does this paper add? Aboriginal patients' lived experience of cardiac care at a 
major metropolitan hospital in Melbourne is explored in this paper. Different 
issues were revealed during their interaction with the hospital staff and the 
hospital system in conjunction with their cultural aspect of patient care. What 
are the implications for practitioners? Positive interactions with staff, 
ongoing support from family and community, culturally appropriate cardiac 
rehabilitation programs can improve the cardiac care experiences of Aboriginal 
patients.

PURPOSE: Reported 5-year survival rates in patients undergoing vitreous surgery 
for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) range from 68-95%. Studies relating 
survival rates to medical baseline characteristics predate the millennium. This 
study aimed to update data on life expectancy of patients undergoing vitrectomy 
for PDR and identify baseline factors which may influence survival.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients who underwent 
their first pars-plana vitrectomy for PDR between April 2004 and May 2005 was 
performed. Survival status on 1 May 2012 was the primary endpoint. The 
Kaplan-Meier life table method was used to determine survival rates. Univariate 
and multiple variable Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to identify 
risk factors for mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 148 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 
54 years (range 20-80 years) at time of surgery. The 3-, 5- and 7-year survival 
rates were 94%, 86% and 77%, respectively (95% confidence interval, CI, 88-97%, 
79-91% and 68-84%, respectively). Renal failure was the most common cause of 
death. The presence of limb ulcers at baseline was the most important prognostic 
indicator for mortality, with a hazard ratio of 3.13 (95% CI 1.46-6.71, p = 
0.003) and a survival rate at 5 years reduced to 79%.
CONCLUSION: The 5-year survival rate remains comparable to those reported 20 
years ago despite a lowering in threshold for vitrectomy and increased health 
awareness. Limb ulcers are strongly associated with increasing mortality. 
Clinicians should remain mindful of the systemic associations of diabetes 
particularly in advanced retinal disease.

BACKGROUND: One of the most important members of the genus Brassica, cabbage, 
requires a relatively high level of calcium for normal growth (Plant Cell 
Environ 7: 397-405, 1984; Plant Physiol 60: 854-856, 1977). Localized Ca(2+) 
deficiency in cabbage leaves causes tip-burn, bringing about serious economic 
losses (Euphytica 9:203-208, 1960; Ann Bot 43:363-372, 1979; Sci Hortic 
14:131-138, 1981). Although it has been known that the occurrence of tip-burn is 
related to Ca(2+) deficiency, there is limited information on the underlying 
mechanisms of tip-burn or the relationship between Ca(2+) and tip-burn 
incidence. To obtain more information on the genetic control of tip-burn 
symptoms, we focused on the identification of genes differentially expressed in 
response to increasing intracellular Ca(2+) and K(+) concentrations in B. 
oleracea lines derived from tip-burn susceptible, tip-burn resistant cabbages 
(B. oleracea var. capitata), and kale (B. oleracea var. acephala).
RESULTS: We compared the levels of major macronutrient cations, including Ca(2+) 
and K(+), in three leaf segments, the leaf apex (LA), middle of leaf (LM), and 
leaf base (LB), of tip-burn susceptible, tip-burn resistant cabbages, and kale. 
Ca(2+) and K(+) concentrations were highest in kale, followed by tip-burn 
resistant and then tip-burn susceptible cabbages. These cations generally 
accumulated to a greater extent in the LB than in the LA. Transcriptome analysis 
identified 58,096 loci as putative non-redundant genes in the three leaf 
segments of the three B. oleracea lines and showed significant changes in 
expression of 27,876 loci based on Ca(2+) and K(+) levels. Among these, 1844 
loci were identified as tip-burn related phenotype-specific genes. Tip-burn 
resistant cabbage and kale-specific genes were largely related to stress and 
transport activity based on GO annotation. Tip-burn resistant cabbage and kale 
plants showed phenotypes clearly indicative of heat-shock, freezing, and drought 
stress tolerance compared to tip-burn susceptible cabbages, demonstrating a 
correlation between intracellular Ca(2+) and K(+) concentrations and tolerance 
of abiotic stress with differential gene expression. We selected 165 genes that 
were up- or down-regulated in response to increasing Ca(2+) and K(+) 
concentrations in the three leaf segments of the three plant lines. Gene 
ontology enrichment analysis indicated that these genes participated in 
regulatory metabolic processes or stress responses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the genes involved in regulatory 
metabolic processes or stress responses were differentially expressed in 
response to increasing Ca(2+) and K(+) concentrations in the B. oleracea leaf. 
Our transcriptome data and the genes identified may serve as a starting point 
for understanding the mechanisms underlying essential macronutrient deficiencies 
in plants, as well as the features of tip-burn in cabbage and other Brassica 
species.

BACKGROUND: Hitherto, a population-based analysis of the cause of death in urban 
areas of Western China has not been undertaken over an extended period. The aims 
of this study were to calculate the overall and annual cause-specific mortality 
rates by age and sex in urban areas of Western China from 2003 to 2012 and to 
evaluate the quality of the data.
METHODS: We used Excel software, cause-of-death registrations, and International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, codes to calculate the overall and 
yearly cause-specific crude mortality rates by age and sex, the Chinese 
age-standardized mortality rate, and life expectancies.
RESULTS: In the Jiulongpo District from 2003 to 2012, there was an increase in 
the number of death case reports in the census-registered population, a decrease 
in the number of omitted deaths, and rise in the crude mortality rate. Except 
for 2003, the Chinese age-standardized mortality rate was the lowest in 2012 
(330.83/100,000) and highest in 2005 (390.08/100,000). Life expectancy increased 
from 78.36 years in 2005 to 81.67 years in 2012.
CONCLUSIONS: With the development of its social economy, the Chinese government 
and public attach greater importance to cause-of-death surveillance. The quality 
of cause-of-death registrations has gradually increased, crude mortality rates 
have risen, the Chinese age-standardized mortality rate has fallen, and life 
expectancies have increased.

A clear link exists between the extension of life expectancy throughout the 
world and the increased incidence of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. 
Diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are chronic diseases with devastating 
consequences for patients and their families. They also represent a major 
economic cost for society. Therapeutic progress has been made mainly by 
alleviating some of the symptoms of these diseases, but currently no cure is 
available. Attempts to develop new therapies have been hampered mainly because 
of gaps in our current knowledge about the pathogenic mechanism underlying 
neurodegeneration, making difficult the identification of targets for new drug 
development, and also because of the lack of biomarkers essential for early 
diagnosis, patient stratification and follow up of treatment. Taking advantage 
of the latest technical developments, proteomics and peptidomics based 
approaches are being used to identify new cellular pathophysiological pathways 
as well as biomarkers in biological fluids. Here we will review the results, 
mainly published in the last five years, of unbiased proteomics and peptidomics 
approaches for biomarker research using biological fluids of Alzheimer's, 
Parkinson's and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis patients.

OBJECTIVES: Untreated obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is 
associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, increased risk of cardiovascular 
(CV) disease, and road traffic accidents (RTAs), which impact survival and 
health-related quality of life. This study, funded by the French National 
Authority for Health (HAS), aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of different 
treatments (i.e., continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], dental devices, 
lifestyle advice, and no treatment) in patients with mild-to-moderate OSAHS in 
France.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the progression of two 
cohorts, stratified by CV risk, over a lifetime horizon. Daytime sleepiness and 
RTAs were taken into account for all patients while CV events were only 
considered for patients with high CV risk.
RESULTS: For patients with low CV risk, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of dental devices versus no treatment varied between 32,976 EUR (moderate 
OSAHS) and 45,579 EUR (mild OSAHS) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and 
CPAP versus dental devices, above 256,000 EUR/QALY. For patients with high CV 
risk, CPAP was associated with a gain of 0.62 QALY compared with no treatment, 
resulting in an ICER of 10,128 EUR/QALY.
CONCLUSION: The analysis suggests that it is efficient to treat all OSAHS 
patients with high CV risk with CPAP and that dental devices are more efficient 
than CPAP for mild-to-moderate OSAHS with low CV risk. However, out-of-pocket 
costs are currently much higher for dental devices than for CPAP (i.e., 3,326 
EUR versus 2,430 EUR) as orthodontic treatment is mainly non-refundable in 
France.

Withanolide A (steroidal lactone) forms the major constituent of the most 
popular herbal drug in Ayurvedic medicine, Ashwagandha. It has been used since 
ancient times as an alternative medicine for the treatment of a variety of age 
related disorders. Here we provide multiple lines of evidence indicating that 
Withanolide A improves healthspan, delays age-associated physiological changes 
and also extends the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. We also report several 
neuroprotective benefits of this natural product, including its 
anti-amyloidogenic effects, alleviation of α-synuclein aggregation and 
neuroprotection through modulation of neural mediators like acetylcholine. We 
observed that Withanolide A mediates lifespan extension and promotes stress 
resistance via insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway. Such 
findings could be helpful to develop a therapeutic medicine from this natural 
product for the prevention or reversal of age-related ailments and to improve 
the survival of patients suffering from Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.

INTELLIGENCE AND TRANSPARENCY IN HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT.

Richardson HS(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Philosophy and Senior Research Scholar,Kennedy Institute of 
ethics,Georgetown Universityrichardh@georgetown.edu.

Current thinking about the methodology of health technology assessment (HTA) 
seems to be dominated by two fundamental tensions: [1] between maintaining a 
tight focus on quality-adjusted life-years and broadening its concern out to pay 
attention to a broader range of factors, and [2] between thinking of the 
evaluative dimensions that matter as being objectively important factors or as 
ones that are ultimately of merely subjective importance. In this study, I will 
argue that health is a tremendously important all-purpose means to enjoying 
basic human capabilities, but a mere means, and not an end. The ends to which 
health is a means are manifold, requiring all those engaged in policy making to 
exercise intelligence in a continuing effort to identify them and to think 
through how they interrelate. Retreating to the subjective here would be at odds 
with the basic idea of HTA, which is to focus on certain objectively describable 
dimensions of what matters about health and to collect empirical evidence 
rigorously bearing on what produces improvements along those dimensions. To 
proceed intelligently in doing HTA, it is important to stay open to reframing 
and refashioning the ends we take to apply to that arena. The only way for that 
to happen, as an exercise of public, democratic policy making, is for the 
difficult value questions that arise when ends clash not to be buried in 
subjective preference information, but to be front-and-center in the analysis.

INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is a chronic disease that leads to bone fragility and 
is associated with fracture risks and serious consequences for mobility.
OBJECTIVE: To verify the effects of two linear programs of resistance training 
(RT) on bone mineral density (BMD), functional autonomy (FA), muscular strength 
and quality of life (QoL) of postmenopausal women in pharmacological treatment.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial, code: RBR-6bqsw8.
METHODS: 52 volunteers were distributed into three groups, according to randomly 
parallel form: RT3times-per-week (RT3, n=20); RT2times-per-week (RT2, n=16) and 
control group (CG, n=16). The following assessment tools were used: bone mineral 
density (BMD) by dual X-ray absorptiometry, 'Latin America Group for maturity' 
(GDLAM) protocol for FA, 10RM test for leg exercises and the 'Osteoporosis 
Assessment Questionnaire' (OPAQ) for QoL. The physical activities were planned 
for 13 months in cycles with different intensities. A two-way ANOVA with 
Bonferroni post-hoc test were used.
RESULTS: The results showed that the RT3/week was significantly more efficient 
(p<0.05) compared with RT2/week, including: All BMD variables, FA (Δ%=29.3%), 
leg press at 45° (Δ%=24.97%) and OPAQ (Δ%=20.23%). In addition, both RT3 and RT2 
groups were more efficient (p<0.05) compared with CG, including: total BMD 
(Δ%=0.09%) and (Δ%=0.06%); FA (Δ%=7.1%) and RT2 (Δ%=3.78%); Leg press at 45° 
(Δ%=84.1%) and (Δ%=59.1%); keen extension (Δ%=15.28%) and (Δ%=20.37%); OPAQ 
(Δ%=57.61%) and (Δ%=37.37%), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The study showed that both experimental groups presented favorable 
results for BMD, strength, FA and QoL. However, the RT3 showed the best results 
compared to other groups after 13 months of intervention.

The presence of comorbid physical illnesses especially, cardiovascular diseases 
(CVD) in schizophrenia is a growing area of concern in recent years. In order to 
reduce disease burden, to improve quality of life and to provide holistic care, 
it is important to know about the relationship between schizophrenia and CVD. 
The objective of this review is to explore the extent of CVD problems, relevant 
risk factors and potential measures for early diagnosis and prevention of CVD 
among patients with schizophrenia. Worldwide studies show that patients with 
schizophrenia have a higher mortality and lower life expectancy than the general 
population. CVD is the leading cause of increased mortality in schizophrenia. 
Common CVD risk factors in schizophrenia include metabolic syndrome, sedentary 
behaviour, tobacco smoking, effects of antipsychotics, long chain omega-3 fatty 
acid deficiency and shared genetics between CVD and schizophrenia. The potential 
methods for early detection and prevention of CVD in schizophrenia are also 
discussed. Though the patients with schizophrenia form a high risk group for 
CVD, consensus guidelines for early detection and prevention of CVD in 
schizophrenia are lacking. Comorbidity of CVD in schizophrenia needs more 
serious attention by clinicians and researchers.

PURPOSE: The disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost due to eye diseases and 
trends in DALYs in Iran has not been previously reported. The object of this 
study is to report the burden of eye diseases in Iran and to compare changes 
from 1990 to 2010 based on age and gender.
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010) are used 
to report DALYs for cataract, refraction/accommodation (functional) disorders, 
macular degeneration, and glaucoma.
RESULTS: Cataract, refraction/accommodation (functional) disorders, macular 
degeneration, and glaucoma were the 84(th), 87(th), 138(th), and 151(st) causes 
of DALY in 1990 and the 89(th), 72(nd), 99(th), and 137(th) in 2010, 
respectively. Cataract accounted for 0.085% of national DALY in 1990 and 0.09% 
in 2010, refraction/accommodation (functional) disorders accounted for 0.42% in 
1990 and 0.47% in 2010, macular degeneration accounted for 0.017% in 1990 and 
0.071% in 2010 and glaucoma accounted for 0.0099% in 1990 and 0.025% in 2010. 
There was a steady increase in DALY with age for each eye disease for both 
genders and dichotomized for males and females from 1990 to 2010.
CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiologic transition is reflected in major ophthalmic and 
blinding diseases in the GBD data for Iran. The burden of macular degeneration 
is rising, followed by glaucoma. The burden of presbyopia affected individuals 
past their middle age. The burden of cataract manifested as a slower increase 
that could be attributable to better access to treatment.

Poverty and inequality - but of what - as social determinants of health in 
Africa?

BACKGROUND: Many African economies have achieved substantial economic growth 
over the past recent years, yet several of the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) including those concerned with health, remain considerably behind target. 
This paper examines whether progress towards these goals is being hampered by 
existing levels of poverty and income inequality. It also considers whether the 
inequality hypothesis of Wilkinson and Pickett1 applies to population health 
outcomes in African states.
METHODS: Correlation analysis and scatter plots were used to assess graphically 
the link between variations in health outcomes, level of poverty and income 
inequality in different countries. Health status outcomes were measured by using 
four indicators: infant and under-five (child) mortality rates; maternal 
mortality ratios; and life expectancy at birth. In each of the 52 African 
nations, the proportion of the population living below the poverty line is used 
as an indicator of the level of poverty and Gini coefficient as a measure of 
income inequality. The study used a comprehensive review of secondary and 
relevant literature that are pertinent in the subject area. The data datasets 
obtained online from UNICEF2 and UNDP3 (2009) used to test the research 
questions. World Health Organization the three broad dimensions to consider when 
moving towards better population health outcome through Universal Health 
Coverage and the Social Determinants of Health framework reviewed to establish 
the poverty and income inequality link in African countries population health 
outcomes.
RESULTS: The study shows that poverty is strongly associated with all health 
outcome differences in Africa (IMR, cc = 0.63; U5MR, cc = 0.64; MMR, cc = 0.49; 
life expectancy at birth, cc = -0.67); income inequality with only one of the 
four indicators (IMR, cc = 0.14; U5MR, cc = 0.07; MMR, cc = 0.22; life 
expectancy at birth, cc = -0.49), whereas income inequality is associated with 
one of the four indicators.
CONCLUSION: The study shows that tackling poverty should be the immediate 
concern in Africaas a means of promoting better health for all. There is a 
question mark over whether the findings of Wilkinson and Pickett1 on the 
relationship between income inequality and health apply to Africa. The reasons 
for this question mark are discussed. More research is needed to investigate 
whether the inequality results found in this study are replicated in other 
studies of African health.

mobile Digital Access to a Web-enhanced Network (mDAWN): Assessing the 
Feasibility of Mobile Health Tools for Self-Management of Type-2 Diabetes.

The mobile Digital Access to a Web-enhanced Network (mDAWN) program was 
implemented as an online, mobile self-management system to support patients with 
type-2 diabetes and their informal caregivers. Patients used wireless 
physiological sensors, received text messages, and had access to a secure web 
platform with health resources and semi-facilitated discussion forum. Outcomes 
were evaluated using (1) pre and post self-reported health behavior measures, 
(2) physiological outcomes, (3) program cost, and (4) in-depth participant 
interviews. The group had significantly decreased health distress, HbA1c levels, 
and systolic blood pressure. Participants largely saw the mDAWN as providing 
good value for the costs involved and found the program to be empowering in 
gaining control over their diabetes. mHealth programs have the potential to 
improve clinical outcomes through cost effective patient-led care for chronic 
illness. Further evaluation needs to examine integration of similar mHealth 
programs into the patient-physician relationship.

OBJECTIVE: For chronically critically ill elderly patients on mechanical 
ventilation, prognosis for significant recovery may be minimal. These 
individuals, or their surrogates, may decide for "palliative extubation." A 
common prognostic question arises: "How long does she/he have?" This study 
describes demographics, mortality, time to death, and factors associated with 
death after palliative extubation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective 3-year study in community hospital 
with ethnically diverse elderly population. Chronically critically ill patients 
followed from palliative extubation to death or survival to discharge.
MEASURES: Mortality/survival following palliative extubation, time to death or 
discharge, factors associated with death.
RESULTS: Hundred and forty-eight subjects underwent palliative extubation. Mean 
age: 78 years, 60% female, ethnically diverse with 46% white, and 54% others. 
Top diagnostic categories: sepsis (47%) and respiratory failure (22%). After 
extubation, 114 patients (77%) died in hospital and 34 (23%) were discharged. Of 
those who died, median time to death 8.9 hours (range, 4 min to 7 d). Mortality 
proportion was 56% at 24 hours and increased with time. Factors associated with 
early death: Systolic blood pressure less than 90 (p = 0.002) and Charlson 
Comorbidity Index that is above 6 or 0 (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Palliative extubation at end of life was an option selected by an 
ethnically diverse elderly population. Approximately three-fourths of subjects 
died in hospital, and one-fourth was discharged alive. Over 50% who died did so 
within 24 hours, making this useful information for counseling and anticipatory 
planning. Subjects with systolic blood pressure less than 90 and Charlson 
Comorbidity Index that is very low or very high had higher mortality.

INTRODUCTION: In advanced cancer quality of life (QoL) is the most important 
goal of care. It is measured by patient-reported-outcomes (PRO). This structured 
review evaluated how randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on anti-cancer therapy 
in advanced cancer reported PRO.
METHODS: Search was performed in MEDLINE via PubMed for RCTs with median patient 
survival of ≤2 years. Reporting was rated with the Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) PRO extension.
RESULTS: Of 370 retrieved publications, 117 were eligible, but only 30/117 (26%) 
reported PRO. QoL was most frequently measured (29/30). On average, 4.4 (SD 2.5) 
of the 14 CONSORT items were met.
CONCLUSION: PRO are insufficiently reported in advanced cancer trials. Yet, this 
is paramount to enable an informed and patient-oriented decision making process.

BACKGROUND: Complications in patients with liver transplant may occur in less 
than 10 % of cases. These appear in short and/or long term and are due to a 
vascular or biliary cause, rejection, recurrence of the disease or adverse 
effects of immunosuppression, among others, which may affect the quality of 
life. The aim of this article is to evaluate the quality of life in patients 
with deceased donor liver transplantation through the questionnaire SF-36.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study. The quality of life of patients 
with deceased donor liver transplantation was assessed during the period from 
January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2012. The variables evaluated were: age, sex, 
time and main reason for transplantation and quality of life using the short 
form SF-36 version 1.1 for Mexican population.
RESULTS: 37 patients were included. The mean age was 48.7 years. The most 
frequent cause was cirrhosis (n = 35). The highest average score corresponded to 
the mental health component, and the lowest score to the physical component. The 
average time of liver transplantation was 6.73 ± 3.53 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation is still the most effective treatment for 
end-stage liver disease. It can increase the patient's life expectancy and their 
quality of life, assessed with the SF-36 questionnaire. The results were similar 
to those in other studies in both the physical and mental component.

Publisher: Introducción: los pacientes con trasplante hepático pueden presentar 
complicaciones en menos del 10 % de los casos. Las complicaciones a corto y/o 
largo plazo son de origen vascular, biliar, de rechazo, recidiva de la 
enfermedad y efectos adversos de la inmunosupresión, entre otros, lo que puede 
repercutir en la calidad de vida. El objetivo de este artículo es evaluar la 
calidad de vida de los pacientes con trasplante hepático de donante fallecido 
mediante el cuestionario de salud formato corto-36 (SF-36). Métodos: estudio 
transversal analítico. Se evaluó la calidad de vida de los pacientes con 
trasplantes hepáticos de donante fallecido, realizados del 1 de enero de 2005 al 
31 de diciembre de 2012. Variables de estudio: edad, sexo, tiempo de trasplante, 
motivo de trasplante y calidad de vida a través del formato corto SF-36 versión 
1.1 para población mexicana. Resultados: se incluyeron 37 pacientes. Edad 
promedio, 48.7 años. Etiología más frecuente, cirrosis (n = 35). La calificación 
del SF-36 promedio más alta correspondió al componente de salud mental, y la más 
baja al componente de salud físico. El promedio de tiempo del postrasplante 
hepático fue de 6.73 ± 3.53 años. Conclusiones: el trasplante hepático es el 
único tratamiento eficaz para la enfermedad hepática terminal que logra 
incrementar la expectativa y calidad de vida. Los resultados del SF-36 fueron 
similares a otros estudios tanto en el componente físico y mental.

Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Convolutional Neural Networks in MRI Images.

Pereira S, Pinto A, Alves V, Silva CA.

Among brain tumors, gliomas are the most common and aggressive, leading to a 
very short life expectancy in their highest grade. Thus, treatment planning is a 
key stage to improve the quality of life of oncological patients. Magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging technique to assess these 
tumors, but the large amount of data produced by MRI prevents manual
