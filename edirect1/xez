The structure and change of mortality in a Maya community.

Early JD.

PIP: This is the first known report on the demographic details of a Maya group. 
The predominantly Maya town of Santiago Atitlan is in the Guatemalan highlands 
in the Department of Solola. The town contains 2 distinct cultural groups, the 
Ladinos and Indians. Ladinos is a term applied to persons whose style of life is 
not predominantly Indian. They are 3.8% of the town's population. Racial 
composition is unimportant. The age and sex distribution is characterized by 
high birth and death rates. The total fertility rate indicates that the average 
Atitlan family has 8 live births during its reproductive period. There is little 
deliberate population control. From 1960 to 1968 the crude death rate averaged 
23 per 1000 population. Previously it had been much higher. In the 1960 decade 
the life expectancy at birth was 43.3 for males and 41 for females. Female 
mortality in childbirth is believed to be the cause of their higher mortality in 
early life. A higher mortality in later life, is not explained. The infant and 
preschool age group contribute 50 to 70% of all deaths each year. The effect of 
migration is negligible. The population increase is 3% per year. As most are 
subsistence farmers and a land shortage exists, problems are expected to 
develop. A colonial record written in 1585 estimated that a larger population of 
about 12,000 had occupied the are before 1524. By 1650 the population was about 
1000 people. An 1689 estimate was 2235 persons. In 1770 the population was 
recorded as about 900. Currently they are regaining their PreColumbian level 
with 10,462 people in 1964. Present records of births, deaths, and population 
numbers are considered to be accurate.

Life tables for cystic fibrosis.

George L, Norman AP.

Life tables for 128 children with cystic fibrosis without meconium ileus, and 
for 43 cases with meconium ileus, have been constructed for the five years 
starting in 1964. These are compared with similar tables constructed for the 
preceding 20 years and show narrowing of the gap between the life expectancy of 
those entered at birth and at diagnosis, and a very obvious improvement in 
survival rate. It is suggested that this is due to earlier diagnosis and 
treatment.

Cholesteatoma of the ear.

Thomas GL.

Cholesteatoma is a hazardous condition because of the erosion and tissue 
destruction, which result in deafness, and the complications which threaten 
life. Early diagnosis and treatment provide the best opportunity for eradication 
of the disease and preservation of hearing. The patient usually complains of 
intermittent or persistent ear drainage and of diminished hearing acuity. Close 
examination of the tympanic membrane reveals a perforation, which at times may 
be quite small, with epithelial extension into the middle ear space. In most 
instances surgical intervention is necessary for eradication of the disease.

Lasting biological effects of early environmental influences. I. Conditioning of 
adult size by prenatal and postnatal nutrition.

Dubos R, Schaedler RW, Costello R.

Newborn specific-pathogen-free mice (SPF) were separated from their mothers 
shortly after birth and immediately reallocated at random to foster mothers, 
each of which received eight young. Under these conditions, the growth rate and 
adult size of the young were profoundly and lastingly conditioned by some 
unidentified influence exerted by the foster mother. In SPF mice nursed by their 
own mothers, the diet of the latter during gestation and lactation, or during 
lactation alone, conditioned the weight of the young at weaning time, and 
throughout their whole life span. Lasting depression of growth has been achieved 
by minor alterations of the dam's diet, for example by lowering its content in 
magnesium, or in lysine and threonine. The growth-depressing effect so achieved 
persisted throughout the whole life-span of the young, even though they were 
given at weaning time and constantly thereafter unlimited amounts of an optimum 
diet. In contrast, the weight-depressing effect of a diet deficient in lysine 
and threonine administered to adult animals was completely and rapidly 
reversible when a complete diet was later substituted for the deficient one. 
Depression of growth resulting from nutritional experiences during gestation or 
lactation did not seem to affect adversely the health of the young, or to 
decrease their longevity. In fact, the results of two experiments in which the 
animals nursed by mothers on different diets, were kept undisturbed and on 
optimum diets throughout their whole life span, suggest that the smaller animals 
had a greater average life expectancy than the larger ones.

Maximal shelf life was determined and microbial flora were compared for 
irradiated (0.1 and 0.2 Mrad) and nonirradiated yellow perch fillets stored at 1 
C. Shelf life was estimated by organoleptic determinations. Microbiological 
studies included determination of the effects of irradiation on the total 
aerobic microbial population, lag phase, and rate of growth. Genera of organisms 
isolated from fillets through the course of microbial spoilage were identified, 
and the proteolytic activity of the organisms was determined. Plate counts for 
fish prior to irradiation showed the presence of approximately 10(6) organisms 
per g of sample. Irradiation to 0.1 and 0.2 Mrad produced 1.4 and 3 logarithm 
reductions of the initial count, respectively. Irradiation to 0.1 and 0.2 Mrad 
approximately doubled the product's shelf life. Organisms initially isolated 
from the nonirradiated fillets, in order of decreasing number, consisted of 
Flavobacterium, Micrococcus-Sarcina, Achromobacter-Alcaligenes-Mima, 
Pseudomonas, Microbacterium, Vibrio, Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus, 
Brevibacterium, and Aeromonas. By the 6th and 9th days of fillet storage, 
Pseudomonas and the Achromobacter group were the predominant organisms. All 
members of the genus Flavobacterium, but not all members of the genus 
Pseudomonas, were proteolytically active on raw fish juice-agar and skim 
milk-agar media. The Achromobacter group was found to be nonproteolytic on both 
media. Residual flora of fillets irradiated to 0.1 and 0.2 Mrad consisted of the 
Achromobacter group, Lactobacillus, Micrococcus-Sarcina, and Bacillus. Their 
sequence in predominance, however, varied with dose level. Not all proteolytic 
bacteria in the fillets were eliminated by 0.1 and 0.2 Mrad; proteolytic 
Micrococcus-Sarcina survived these treatments.
