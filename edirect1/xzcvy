sugarcane and itch grass in Nigeria. This study was conducted to understand the 
status and genetic diversity of MaYMV in maize fields in the northern guinea 
savannah region of Nigeria. A survey was conducted in 2017 and maize (n = 90) 
and itch grass (n = 10) plants suspected of virus infection based on appearance 
of mosaic and/or yellowing symptoms were sampled in Kaduna (n = 65) and Katsina 
(n = 35) states. The samples were screened individually by reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction using the genus-specific primers targeting 
poleroviruses and potyviruses Pol-G-F and Pol-G-R primers encompassing the 
partial P1-P2 fusion protein and coat protein genes of poleroviruses and primer 
pair CI-For & CI-Rev encompassing the partial cylindrical inclusion proteins of 
most potyviruses. A subset of amplified DNA fragments was cloned, 
Sanger-sequenced, and the obtained sequences were bioinformatically analyzed 
along with corresponding sequences from GenBank. The ~ 1.1 Kb polerovirus 
fragment was detected in 32.2% (29/90) of the maize samples while all 10 itch 
grass samples tested negative. BLASTN analysis of sequences derived from six 
polerovirus samples confirmed the virus identity as MaYMV. In pairwise 
comparisons, the MaYMV sequences derived in this study shared 97-99% nucleotide 
identity with sequences of other MaYMV isolates available in the NCBI GenBank. 
Phylogenetic analysis revealed the segregation of global MaYMV sequences into 
three host-independent clusters with pattern of geographic structuring.

Genetic code expansion, which enables the site-specific incorporation of 
unnatural amino acids into proteins, has emerged as a new and powerful tool for 
protein engineering. Currently, it is mainly utilized inside living cells for a 
myriad of applications. However, the utilization of this technology in a 
cell-free, reconstituted platform has several advantages over living systems. 
The typical limitations to the employment of these systems are the laborious and 
complex nature of its preparation and utilization. Herein, we describe a 
simplified method for the preparation of this system from Escherichia coli 
cells, which is specifically adapted for the expression of the components needed 
for cell-free genetic code expansion. Besides, we propose and demonstrate a 
modular approach to its utilization. By this approach, it is possible to prepare 
and store different extracts, harboring various translational components, and 
mix and match them as needed for more than four years retaining its high 
efficiency. We demonstrate this with the simultaneous incorporation of two 
different unnatural amino acids into a reporter protein. Finally, we demonstrate 
the advantage of cell-free systems over living cells for the incorporation of 
δ-thio-boc-lysine into ubiquitin by using the methanosarcina mazei wild-type 
pyrrolysyl tRNACUA and tRNA-synthetase pair, which could not be achieved in a 
living cell.

Across the Life Span.

Mainly for methodological reasons, little is known about the course of 
development of early cognitive competencies diagnosed with the violation of 
expectation (VoE) method in infants. The goal of this research was to evaluate 
the use of pupillometry as a unified approach to assess expectancy violations 
during and beyond the "dark ages" between 1 and 3 years. We tested children aged 
1-6 years and adults (N = 279) with pictures of animals combined with matching 
or mismatching animal sounds. All age groups exhibited significantly greater 
pupil dilation in mismatched than matched trials. We conclude that pupillometry 
is a viable alternative to the VoE method that, by contrast to the latter, can 
be used throughout the life span.

DYT1 dystonia is an inherited movement disorder without obvious 
neurodegeneration. Multiple mutant mouse models exhibit motor deficits without 
overt "dystonic" symptoms and neurodegeneration. However, some mouse models do. 
Among the later models, the N-CKO mouse model, which has a heterozygous 
Tor1a/Dyt1 knockout (KO) in one allele and Nestin-cre-mediated conditional KO in 
the other, exhibits a severe lack of weight gain, neurodegeneration, overt 
"dystonic" symptoms, such as overt leg extension, weak walking, twisted hindpaw 
and stiff hindlimb, and complete infantile lethality. However, it is not clear 
if the overt dystonic symptoms were caused by the neurodegeneration in the dying 
N-CKO mice. Here, the effects of improved maternal care and nutrition during 
early life on the symptoms in N-CKO mice were analyzed by culling the litter and 
providing wet food to examine whether the overt dystonic symptoms and severe 
lack of weight gain are caused by malnutrition-related neurodegeneration. 
Although the N-CKO mice in this study replicated the severe lack of weight gain 
and overt "dystonic" symptoms during the lactation period regardless of culling 
at postnatal day zero or later, there was no significant difference in the brain 
astrocytes and apoptosis between the N-CKO and control mice. Moreover, more than 
half of the N-CKO mice with culling survived past the lactation period. The 
surviving adult N-CKO mice did not display overt "dystonic" symptoms, and in 
addition they still exhibited small body weight. The results suggest that the 
overt "dystonic" symptoms in the N-CKO mice were independent of prominent 
neurodegeneration, which negates the role of neurodegeneration in the 
pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia.

Post-cut surface browning is one of the major constraints for shelf-life 
extension of lotus root slices. In the present study, lotus roots slices were 
treated with 0, 5 and 10 mmol L-1 oxalic acid and stored at 20 ± 1 °C for 
5 days. Results showed that 10 mmol L-1 oxalic acid treated lotus slices 
exhibited reduced browning, superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, electrolyte 
leakage and malondialdehyde content than control. The 10 mmol L-1 treated slices 
had better visual quality and higher ascorbic acid and total phenolic contents. 
In addition, 10 mmol L-1 treated slices showed reduced total bacterial count 
along with lower soluble quinones, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activities 
in contrast to control. Similarly, 10 mmol L-1 treatment showed higher 
superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activities as compared 
to control. In conclusion, 10 mmol L-1 oxalic acid application could be 
considered suitable to delay post-cut browning of lotus root slices.

INTRODUCTION: Postural alignment is altered with spine deformities that might 
occur with age. Alteration of spino-pelvic and postural alignment parameters are 
known to affect daily life activities such as gait. It is still unknown how 
spino-pelvic and postural alignment parameters are related to gait kinematics.
RESEARCH QUESTION: To assess the relationships between spino-pelvic/postural 
alignment parameters and gait kinematics in asymptomatic adults.
METHODS: 134 asymptomatic subjects (aged 18-59 years) underwent 3D gait 
analysis, from which kinematics of the pelvis and lower limbs were extracted in 
the 3 planes. Subjects then underwent full-body biplanar X-rays, from which 
skeletal 3D reconstructions and spino-pelvic and postural alignment parameters 
were obtained such as sagittal vertical axis (SVA), center of auditory meatus to 
hip axis plumbline (CAM-HA), thoracic kyphosis (TK) and radiologic pelvic tilt 
(rPT). In order to assess the influence of spino-pelvic and postural alignment 
parameters on gait kinematics a univariate followed by a multivariate analysis 
were performed.
RESULTS: SVA was related to knee flexion during loading response (β = 0.268); 
CAM-HA to ROM pelvic obliquity (β = -0.19); rPT to mean pelvic tilt (β = -0.185) 
and ROM pelvic obliquity (β = -0.297); TK to ROM hip flexion/extension in stance 
(β = -0.17), mean foot progression in stance (β = -0.329), walking speed 
(β = -0.19), foot off (β = 0.223) and step length (β = -0.181).
SIGNIFICANCE: This study showed that increasing SVA, CAM-HA, TK and rPT, which 
is known to occur in adults with spinal deformities, could alter gait 
kinematics. Increases in these parameters, even in asymptomatic subjects, were 
related to a retroverted pelvis during gait, a reduced pelvic obliquity and hip 
flexion/extension mobility, an increased knee flexion during loading response as 
well as an increase in external foot progression angle. This was associated with 
a decrease in the walking pace: reduced speed, step length and longer stance 
phase.

INTRODUCTION: According to WHO, in worldwide cancer mortality statistics, the 
first place is occupied by bronchopulmonary cancer. This reason has led us to 
carry out the present pilot study, was with the participation of the Clinics of 
Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy Bucharest in order to apply a 
technique developed earlier by Stefan-van Staden, for early detection of this 
type of cancer, initiate a personalized diagnosis, and implicitly apply a 
personalized treatment in order to increase the life expectancy among these 
patients. In recent years, there has been a tendency to find fast non-invasive 
screening methods for the early diagnosis of cancer. Therefore, the present 
pilot study proposed simultaneous detection of tumor markers (NSE and CEA) by 
different methods: (1) ELISA kits, (2) the method developed earlier by 
Stefan-van Staden-which used stochastic sensors, and (3) IHC. All selected 
patients selected by Dr Claudiu-Eduard Nistor, were suspected of microcellular 
bronchopulmonary cancer. Tumor tissue samples were collected by conventional and 
minimally invasive surgical techniques. The results obtained for the detection 
of markers in blood using ELISA, and stochastic methods (based on stochastic 
sensors) were correlated with the results obtained using anatomopathological and 
immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor tissues.
EXPERIMENTAL: Stochastic sensors have been used to analyze NSE in blood samples 
and whole tissues. The IHC was performed for analyzing tumor tissue using 
standard procedures. ELISA has been used as a standard method to determine 
specific biomarkers in whole blood samples.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A good correlation was found for results obtained using 
stochastic and ELISA methods, and IHC for blood and tissue analysis. Statistical 
evaluation of the data showed that the results of whole blood analysis are 
correlating very good with the analysis of pulmonary tumor tissue. Therefore, 
the stochastic method can be used for the detection and for the pursuit of 
therapeutic efficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained, as well as the statistics, showed that the 
proposed method can be used as a screening method for fast and early detection 
of microcellular bronchopulmonary, being minim invasive. It can also be used for 
monitoring the therapeutic efficiency of the prescribed medication.

BACKGROUND: Advanced age is associated with cognitive and physical decline and 
is a major risk factor for a multitude of disorders. There is also a gap in life 
expectancy between males and females. DNA methylation differences have been 
shown to be associated with both age and sex. Here, we investigate age-by-sex 
differences in blood-based DNA methylation in an unrelated cohort of 2586 
individuals between the ages of 18 and 87 years, with replication in a further 
4450 individuals between the ages of 18 and 93 years.
METHODS: Linear regression models were applied, with stringent genome-wide 
significance thresholds (p < 3.6 × 10-8) used in both the discovery and 
replication data. A second, highly conservative mixed linear model method that 
better controls the false-positive rate was also applied, using the same 
genome-wide significance thresholds.
RESULTS: Using the linear regression method, 52 autosomal and 597 X-linked CpG 
sites, mapping to 251 unique genes, replicated with concordant effect size 
directions in the age-by-sex interaction analysis. The site with the greatest 
difference mapped to GAGE10, an X-linked gene. Here, DNA methylation levels 
remained stable across the male adult age range (DNA methylation by age 
r = 0.02) but decreased across female adult age range (DNA methylation by age 
r = - 0.61). One site (cg23722529) with a significant age-by-sex interaction 
also had a quantitative trait locus (rs17321482) that is a genome-wide 
significant variant for prostate cancer. The mixed linear model method 
identified 11 CpG sites associated with the age-by-sex interaction.
CONCLUSION: The majority of differences in age-associated DNA methylation 
trajectories between sexes are present on the X chromosome. Several of these 
differences occur within genes that have been implicated in sexually dimorphic 
traits.

BACKGROUND: Gene expression data contains key information which can be used for 
subtyping cancer patients. However, computational methods suffer from 'curse of 
dimensionality' due to very high dimensionality of omics data and therefore are 
not able to clearly distinguish between the discovered subtypes in terms of 
separation of survival plots.
METHODS: To address this we propose a framework based on Topological Mapper 
algorithm. The novelty of this work is that we suggest a method for defining the 
filter function on which the mapper algorithm heavily depends. Survival analysis 
of the discovered cancer subtypes is carried out and evaluated in terms of 
minimum pairwise separation between the Kaplan-Meier plots. Furthermore, we 
present a method to measure the separation between the discovered subtypes based 
on hazard ratios.
RESULTS: Five cancer genomics datasets obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
portal have been used for comparisons with Robust Sparse Correlation-Otrimle 
(RSC-Otrimle) algorithm and Similarity Network Fusion(SNF). Comparisons show 
that the minimum pairwise life expectancy difference (in days) between the 
discovered subtypes for lung, colon, breast, glioblastoma and kidney cancers is 
107, 204, 20, 88 and 425 days, respectively, for the proposed methodology 
whereas it is only 69, 43, 6, 61 and 282 days for RSC-Otrimle and 9, 95, 18, 60 
and 148 days for SNF. Hazard ratio analysis also shows that the proposed 
methodology performs better in four of the five datasets. A visual inspection of 
Kaplan-Meier plots reveals that the proposed methodology achieves lesser overlap 
in Kaplan-Meier plots especially for lung, breast and kidney cases. Furthermore, 
relevant genetic pathways for each subtype have been obtained and pathways which 
can be possible targets for treatment have been discussed.
CONCLUSION: The significance of this work lies in individualized understanding 
of cancer from patient to patient which is the backbone of Precision Medicine.

We conducted genotypic analyses of interleukin-10 (IL-10) (-1082 G/A; GG, GA, 
AA) and interleukin-28B (CC, CT, TT) genes polymorphisms in acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL) pediatric patients in descriptive study to evaluate the 
prevalence of these mutations. In amplification refractory mutation system-PCR 
(ARMS-PCR), one reaction was carried out for each patient's DNA sample. For 
IL-28B gene, two forward and two reverse primers specific for C-allele and 
T-allele were used separately. For human IL-10 gene, two different forward 
primers specific for A and G alleles were used in combination with common 
reverse primer. IL-10 gene promoter showed highest frequency (n=29, 58%) of 
heterozygous (GA) allele, while genotypic analysis of IL-28B gene showed highest 
frequency (n=28, 56%) of homozygous (CC) allele. The IL-10 (AA) genotype related 
to its protein's less production in body which may be associated with the least 
survival of ALL's patients, while IL-28b (CT and TT) genotypes may be associated 
with less IFNλ3 levels and less life expectancy.

Massive blood loss, a common pathological complication in the clinic, is often 
accompanied by altered gut integrity and intestinal wall damage. Little is known 
to what extent the gut microbiome could be correlated with this process. The gut 
microbiome plays a crucial role in human health, especially in immune and 
inflammatory responses. This study aims to determine whether acute blood loss 
affects the gut microbiome and the dynamic variation of the gut microbiome 
following the loss of blood. We used New Zealand rabbits to mimic the blood loss 
complication and designed a five-time-point fecal sampling strategy including 
24-h pre-blood loss procedure, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, and 1-week post-blood loss 
procedure. Gut microbiome composition and diversity were analyzed using 16S rRNA 
gene sequencing and downstream α-diversity, β-diversity, and taxonomy analysis. 
The gut microbiome changed dramatically after blood loss procedure. There was a 
significant increase in diversity and richness of the gut microbiome at 24-h 
post-procedure (P = 0.038). Based on an analysis of similarities, the 
composition of gut microbiome in the samples collected at 24-h post-procedure 
was significantly different from that of pre-procedure samples (r = 0.79, 
P = 0.004 weighted unifrac distance; r = 0.99, P = 0.002, unweighted unifrac 
distance). The relative abundance of Lactobacillus was significantly decreased 
in the post-procedure samples (P = 0.0006), while the relative abundance of 
Clostridiales (P = 0.018) and Bacteroidales (P = 0.015) was significantly 
increased after procedure. We also found the relative abundance of Bacilli, 
Lactobacillus, Myroides, and Prevotella decreased gradually at different time 
points after blood loss. The relative abundance of the Clostridia, 
Alphaproteobacteria, and Sporosarcina increased at 24-h post-procedure and 
decreased thereafter. This preliminary study discovered potential connections 
between blood loss and dysbiosis of gut microbiome. The diversity and abundance 
of the gut microbiome was affected to various extents after acute blood loss and 
unable to be restored to the original microbiome profile even after one week. 
The increase in relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens after blood loss 
could be an important indication to reconsider immune and inflammatory responses 
after acute blood loss from the perspective of gut microbiome.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DECT versus multiphasic CT and 
MRI for characterizing small incidentally detected indeterminate renal lesions 
using a Markov Monte Carlo decision-analytic model.
BACKGROUND: Incidental renal lesions are commonly encountered due to the 
increasing utilization of medical imaging and the increasing prevalence of renal 
lesions with age. Currently recommended imaging modalities to further 
characterize incidental indeterminate renal lesions have some inherent 
drawbacks. Single-phase DECT may overcome these limitations, but its 
cost-effectiveness remains uncertain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic (Markov) model was constructed to 
estimate life expectancy and lifetime costs for otherwise healthy 64-year-old 
patients with small (≤ 4 cm) incidentally detected, indeterminate renal lesions 
on routine imaging (e.g., ultrasound or single-phase CT). Three strategies for 
evaluating renal lesions for enhancement were compared: multiphase SECT (e.g., 
true unenhanced and nephrographic phase), multiphasic MRI, and single-phase DECT 
(nephrographic phase in dual-energy mode). The model incorporated 
modality-specific diagnostic test performance, incidence, and prevalence of 
incidental renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), effectiveness, costs, and health 
outcomes. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to identify 
strategy preference at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $50,000 and 
$100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, expected mean costs per patient undergoing 
characterization of incidental renal lesions were $2567 for single-phase DECT, 
$3290 for multiphasic CT, and $3751 for multiphasic MRI. Associated 
quality-adjusted life-years were the highest for single-phase DECT at 0.962, for 
multiphasic MRI it was 0.940, and was the lowest for multiphasic CT at 0.925. 
Because of lower associated costs and higher effectiveness, the single-phase 
DECT strategy dominated the other two strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Single-phase DECT is potentially more cost-effective than 
multiphasic SECT and MRI for evaluating small incidentally detected 
indeterminate renal lesions.

PURPOSE: Patients with high rates of developing new brain metastases have an 
increased likelihood of dying of neurologic death. It is unclear, however, 
whether this risk is affected by treatment choice following failure of primary 
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).
METHODS: From July 2000 to March 2017, 440 patients with brain metastasis were 
treated with SRS and progressed to have a distant brain failure (DBF). 
Eighty-seven patients were treated within the immunotherapy era. Brain 
metastasis velocity (BMV) was calculated for each patient. In general, the 
institutional philosophy for use of salvage SRS vs whole brain radiotherapy 
(WBRT) was to postpone the use of WBRT for as long as possible and to treat with 
salvage SRS when feasible. No further treatment was reserved for patients with 
poor life expectancy and who were not expected to benefit from salvage 
treatment.
RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-five patients were treated with repeat SRS, 91 
patients were treated with salvage WBRT, and 64 patients received no salvage 
radiation therapy. One-year cumulative incidence of neurologic death after 
salvage SRS vs WBRT was 15% vs 23% for the low- (p = 0.06), 30% vs 37% for the 
intermediate- (p < 0.01), and 31% vs 48% (p < 0.01) for the high-BMV group. 
Salvage WBRT was associated with increased incidence of neurologic death on 
multivariate analysis (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.13-2.39, p = 0.01) when compared to 
repeat SRS. One-year cumulative incidence of neurologic death for patients 
treated within the immunotherapy era was 9%, 38%, and 38% for low-, 
intermediate-, and high-BMV groups, respectively (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Intermediate and high risk BMV groups are predictive of neurologic 
death. The association between BMV and neurologic death remains strong for 
patients treated within the immunotherapy era.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) programme 
for high-risk men who have sex with men (MSM), which includes gonorrhoea testing 
and treatment, on the transmission of HIV and Neisseria among MSM in the 
Netherlands and the cost-effectiveness of such programme with and without risk 
compensation (in the form of reduced condom use).
METHODS: We developed a stochastic agent-based transmission model of HIV and 
gonorrhoea. We simulated a capped (max 2.5% of MSM) and uncapped (5.5% of MSM in 
2018 declining to 3% in 2027) daily PrEP programme for high-risk MSM, with 
3-monthly HIV and gonorrhoea testing, with and without risk compensation. 
Epidemiological outcomes were calculated from the transmission model and used in 
an economic model to calculate costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), over 2018-2027, taking a 
healthcare payer perspective.
RESULTS: Without risk compensation, PrEP can lead to a reduction of 61 or 49% in 
the total number of new HIV infections in 2018-2027, if the programme is 
uncapped or capped to 2.5% of MSM, respectively. With risk compensation, this 
reduction can be 63 or 46% in the uncapped and capped programmes, respectively. 
In all scenarios, gonorrhoea prevalence decreased after introducing PrEP. 
Without risk compensation, 92% of simulations were cost-effective (of which 52% 
cost-saving). With risk compensation, 73% of simulations were cost-effective (of 
which 23% was cost-saving).
CONCLUSION: A nationwide PrEP programme for high-risk MSM can result in 
substantial reductions in HIV and gonorrhoea transmission and be cost-effective, 
even with risk compensation.

IMPORTANCE: Rising cancer incidence combined with improvements in systemic and 
local therapies extending life expectancy are translating into more patients 
with spinal metastases. This makes the multidisciplinary management of spinal 
metastases and development of new therapies increasingly important. Spinal 
metastases may cause significant pain and reduced quality of life and lead to 
permanent neurological disability if compression of the spinal cord and/or nerve 
root occurs. Until recently, treatments for spinal metastases were not optimal 
and provided temporary local control and pain relief. Spinal stereotactic 
ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is an effective approach associated with an 
improved therapeutic ratio, with evolving clinical application.
OBJECTIVE: To review the literature of spinal SABR for spinal metastases, 
discuss a multidisciplinary approach to appropriate patient selection and 
technical considerations, and summarize current efforts to combine spinal SABR 
with systemic therapies.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: The MEDLINE database was searched to identify articles 
reporting on spinal SABR to September 30, 2018. Articles including clinical 
trials, prospective and retrospective studies, systematic reviews, and consensus 
recommendations were selected for relevance to multidisciplinary management of 
spinal metastases.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine unique publications with 5655 patients who underwent SABR 
for spinal metastases were included. Four comprehensive frameworks for patient 
selection were discussed. Spinal SABR was associated with 1-year local control 
rates of approximately 80% to 90% in the de novo setting, greater than 80% in 
the postoperative setting, and greater than 65% in the reirradiation setting. 
The most commonly discussed adverse effect was development of a vertebral 
compression fracture with variable rates, most commonly reported as 
approximately 10% to 15%. High-level data on the combination of SABR with modern 
therapies are still lacking. At present, 19 clinical trials are ongoing, mainly 
focusing on combined modality therapies, radiotherapy prescription dose, and 
oligometastic disease.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that spinal SABR may be an 
effective treatment option for well-selected patients with spinal metastases, 
achieving high rates of local tumor control with moderate rates of adverse 
effects. Optimal management should include review by a multidisciplinary care 
team.

IMPORTANCE: Advances in childhood and adolescent cancer treatment have been 
associated with increased rates of cure during the past 3 decades; however, 
improvement in adult life expectancy for these individuals has not yet been 
reported.
OBJECTIVES: To project long-term survival and assess whether life expectancy 
will improve among adult survivors of childhood cancer who were treated in more 
recent decades.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A microsimulation model of competing 
mortality risks was developed using data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor 
Study on 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1999. 
The model included (1) late recurrence, (2) treatment-related late effects 
(health-related [subsequent cancers, cardiac events, pulmonary conditions, and 
other] and external causes), and (3) US background mortality rates.
EXPOSURES: Treatment subgroups (no treatment or surgery only, chemotherapy 
alone, radiotherapy alone, and radiotherapy with chemotherapy) and individuals 
with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during childhood by era (1970-1979, 1980-1989, 
and 1990-1999).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Conditional life expectancy (defined as the number 
of years a 5-year survivor can expect to live), cumulative cause-specific 
mortality risk, and 10-year mortality risks conditional on attaining ages of 30, 
40, 50, and 60 years.
RESULTS: Among the hypothetical cohort of 5-year survivors of childhood cancer 
representative of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study participants (44% female 
and 56% male; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 7.3 [5.6] years), conditional life 
expectancy was 48.5 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 47.6-49.6 years) for 
5-year survivors diagnosed in 1970-1979, 53.7 years (95% UI, 52.6-54.7 years) 
for those diagnosed in 1980-1989, and 57.1 years (95% UI, 55.9-58.1 years) for 
those diagnosed in 1990-1999. Compared with individuals without a history of 
cancer, these results represented a gap in life expectancy of 25% (95% UI, 
24%-27%) (16.5 years [95% UI, 15.5-17.5 years]) for those diagnosed in 
1970-1979, 19% (95% UI, 17%-20%) (12.3 years [95% UI, 11.3-13.4 years]) for 
those diagnosed in 1980-1989, and 14% (95% UI, 13%-16%) (9.2 years [95% UI, 
8.3-10.4 years]) for those diagnosed in 1990-1999. During the 3 decades, the 
proportion of survivors treated with chemotherapy alone increased (from 18% in 
1970-1979 to 54% in 1990-1999), and the life expectancy gap in this 
chemotherapy-alone group decreased from 11.0 years (95% UI, 9.0-13.1 years) to 
6.0 years (95% UI, 4.5-7.6 years). In contrast, during the same time frame, only 
modest improvements in the gap in life expectancy were projected for survivors 
treated with radiotherapy (21.0 years [95% UI, 18.5-23.2 years] to 17.6 years 
[95% UI, 14.2-21.2 years]) or with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (17.9 years 
[95% UI, 16.7-19.2 years] to 14.8 years [95% UI, 13.1-16.7 years]). For the 
largest group of survivors by diagnosis-those with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia-the gap in life expectancy decreased from 14.7 years (95% UI, 12.8-16.5 
years) in 1970-1979 to 8.0 years (95% UI, 6.2-9.7 years).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Evolving treatment approaches are projected to be 
associated with improved life expectancy after treatment for pediatric cancer, 
in particular among those who received chemotherapy alone for their childhood 
cancer diagnosis. Despite improvements, survivors remain at risk for shorter 
lifespans, especially when radiotherapy was included as part of their childhood 
cancer treatment.

Patient-reported outcomes and efficiency of complete dentures made with 
simplified methods: A meta-analysis.

BACKGROUND: An increasing lifetime expectancy of the elderly highlights the 
importance of prosthodontic techniques, such as preparing complete dentures, 
which can restore the complete loss of teeth.
OBJECTIVES: The present study compared patient-reported outcomes and efficiency 
in terms of preparation time and cost of a simplified complete denture (SCD) and 
a conventional complete denture (CCD) in edentulous patients using a 
meta-analysis of clinical trials (CTs).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted for studies comparing 
SCD and CCD in MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus and World of Science, and through 
analyzing the reference lists of the retrieved studies, without language or time 
limits. Studies fitting the pre-specified inclusion criteria were assessed for 
quality and the extracted data referred to the following issues: patient 
satisfaction measured using a 100-millimeter visual analog scale (VAS); impact 
on quality of life estimated using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP)-19 on a 
scale from 0 to 38; the proportion of cost of SCD to CCD; and time in minutes to 
deliver dentures. The results were pooled in meta-analyses and displayed in 
forest plots.
RESULTS: Eleven publications referring to 7 studies were included in the 
meta-analysis. There were no differences between SCD and CCD in patient 
satisfaction (mean difference: 0.896, 95% CI (confidence interval): -2.947, 
4.739) or their impact on quality of life (mean difference: 0.379, 95% CI: 
-0.994, 1.751). It required significantly less time to deliver SCD (mean 
difference: -274.16, 95% CI: -348.37, -199.96) and it cost significantly less 
(proportion: 0.740, 95% CI: 0.597, 0.882). Both SCD and CCD similarly impacted 
the patient's quality of life and satisfaction. It took about 4.5 h less to 
deliver SCD to patients as compared to CCD and the cost of SCD was 75% of the 
cost of CCD.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to CCD, SCD had a similar impact in terms of satisfaction 
and quality of life with reduced treatment time and cost. More studies are 
needed in low-resource settings, where SCD may have a greater advantage.

Epidemiological shift of hepatitis A in EAGLE countries - a projection.

Ghildayal N(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, 
University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.

PURPOSE: Many world regions are developing quickly and experiencing increasing 
levels of sanitation, causing an epidemiological shift of hepatitis A in these 
areas. The shift occurs when children avoid being infected with the disease 
until a later age due to cleaner water sources, food, and hygiene practices in 
their environment; but if they are infected at later age, the disease is much 
more severe and lost productivity costs are higher. The purpose of this paper is 
to examine what could occur if an epidemiological shift of the disease continues 
in these regions, and what type of future burden hepatitis A may have in a 
hypothetical rapidly developing country.
DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Initially, annual hepatitis A mortality was 
regressed on the Human Development Index (HDI) for each country classified as an 
emerging and growth-leading economy (EAGLE) to provide an overview of how 
economic development and hepatitis A mortality related. Data from the various
