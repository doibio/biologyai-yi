deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) to evaluate 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: Compared to targeted risk-based testing (current standard of care), 
routine testing increased the lifetime medical cost by $80 and discounted QALYs 
by 0.0013 per person. Across all strategies, rapid testing provided higher QALYs 
at a lower cost per QALY gained and was always preferred. Counselor-initiated 
routine rapid testing was associated with an ICER of $71000/QALY gained. Results 
were sensitive to offer and result receipt rates. Counselor-initiated routine 
rapid testing was cost-effective (ICER <$100000/QALY) unless the prevalence of 
PWID was <0.59%, HCV prevalence among PWID was <16%, reinfection rate was >26 
cases per 100 person-years, or reflex confirmatory testing followed all reactive 
venipuncture diagnostics. In PSA, routine rapid testing was the optimal strategy 
in 90% of simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine rapid HCV testing among 15- to 30-year-olds may be 
cost-effective when the prevalence of PWID is >0.59%.

Psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences with participant-attributed 
increases in well-being. However, little research has examined enduring changes 
in traits. This study administered psilocybin to participants who undertook a 
program of meditation/spiritual practices. Healthy participants were randomized 
to three groups (25 each): (1) very low-dose (1 mg/70 kg on sessions 1 and 2) 
with moderate-level ("standard") support for spiritual-practice (LD-SS); (2) 
high-dose (20 and 30 mg/70 kg on sessions 1 and 2, respectively) with standard 
support (HD-SS); and (3) high-dose (20 and 30 mg/70kg on sessions 1 and 2, 
respectively) with high support for spiritual practice (HD-HS). Psilocybin was 
administered double-blind and instructions to participants/staff minimized 
expectancy confounds. Psilocybin was administered 1 and 2 months after 
spiritual-practice initiation. Outcomes at 6 months included rates of spiritual 
practice and persisting effects of psilocybin. Compared with low-dose, high-dose 
psilocybin produced greater acute and persisting effects. At 6 months, compared 
with LD-SS, both high-dose groups showed large significant positive changes on 
longitudinal measures of interpersonal closeness, gratitude, life 
meaning/purpose, forgiveness, death transcendence, daily spiritual experiences, 
religious faith and coping, and community observer ratings. Determinants of 
enduring effects were psilocybin-occasioned mystical-type experience and rates 
of meditation/spiritual practices. Psilocybin can occasion enduring trait-level 
increases in prosocial attitudes/behaviors and in healthy psychological 
functioning. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00802282.

Overcoming sleep disordered breathing and ensuring sufficient good sleep time 
for a healthy life expectancy.

Medicine, Kyoto University.

Recent advances in basic and clinical medicine have resulted in major 
improvements in human health. Currently sleep has been considered an essential 
factor in maintaining and promoting a healthy life expectancy. Sleep disorders 
include more than 60 diseases. Sleep disordered breathings (SDB) have 17 
disorders, including sleep apnea. SDB usually induces hypoxemia and hypercapnia, 
which would have significant effects on cells, organs, and the whole body. We 
have investigated SDB for nearly 35 years. We found that SDB has significant 
associations with humoral factors, including coagulation systems, the body's 
protective factors against diseases, and metabolic and organ diseases. Currently 
we have been giving attention to the associations among SDB, short sleep 
duration, and obesity. In addition, SDB is important not only in the home but 
under critical care such as in the perioperative stage. In this review, I would 
like to describe several aspects of SDB in relation to systemic diseases and 
overall health based mainly on our published reports.

Ghana's healthcare expenditure has increased over the past two decades. 
Increased healthcare expenditures are required to enhance the acquisition of 
better hospital resources that may improve healthcare. This study presents an 
overview of healthcare expenditures and health outcomes (i.e. infant mortality, 
under-5 mortality and life expectancy) from 1995 to 2014 in Ghana. Infant and 
under-5 mortalities have declined by 50 and 25%, respectively, as of 2014, while 
life expectancy has increased from 60.7 to 64.8 years. Private spending on 
health, especially out-of-pocket payments, declined but is higher than the World 
Health Organization's recommended financial threshold. Non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs) are rising with healthcare costs leading to catastrophically high 
healthcare expenditures in the future. While government's investments on 
healthcare have yielded positive results, the improvement in the health outcomes 
cannot be attributed to increased health expenditure alone. Therefore, this 
paper outlines policies on maternal health, national health insurance and 
healthcare reforms that have influenced health outcomes. In parallel, the paper 
highlights challenges of the Ghana health system of which the major ones are (1) 
inadequate financial investments in health and (2) limited health workforce and 
facilities. These challenges can be ameliorated by (1) establishing new health 
institutions and expanding existed ones; (2) providing incentives to discourage 
the exodus of health workers; (3) introduction of the concept of predictive, 
preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM) for treating NCDs; and (4) 
alternative insurance schemes for vulnerable groups. This, coupled with the will 
of the government to curb misappropriation of funds, will be important to 
achieving better health outcomes.

Cardiovascular dysfunction and heart failure associated with aging not only 
impairs the cardiac function but also the quality of life eventually decreasing 
the life expectancy of the elderly. Notably, cardiac tissue can prematurely age 
under certain conditions such as genetic mutation, persistent redox stress and 
overload, aberrant molecular signaling, DNA damage, telomere attrition, and 
other pathological insults. While cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality 
is on the rise and remains a global health threat, there has been only little to 
moderate improvements in its medical management. This is due to the fact that 
the lifestyle changes to molecular mechanisms underlying age-related myocardial 
structure and functional remodeling are multifactorial and intricately operate 
at different levels. Along these lines, the intrinsic redox mechanisms and 
oxidative stress (OS) are widely studied in the myocardium. The accumulation of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) with age and the resultant oxidative damage has 
been shown to increase the susceptibility of the myocardium to multiple 
complications such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, 
cardiac myopathy, and heart failure. There has been growing interest in trying 
to enhance the mechanisms that neutralize the ROS and curtailing OS as a 
possible anti-aging intervention and as a treatment for age-related disorders. 
Natural defense system to fight against OS involves a master transcription 
factor named nuclear erythroid-2-p45-related factor-2 (Nrf2) that regulates 
several antioxidant genes. Compelling evidence exists on the Nrf2 gain of 
function through pharmacological interventions in counteracting the oxidative 
damage and affords cytoprotection in several organs including but not limited to 
lung, liver, kidney, brain, etc. Nevertheless, thus far, only a few studies have 
described the potential role of Nrf2 and its non-pharmacological induction in 
cardiac aging. This chapter explores the effects of various modes of exercise on 
Nrf2 signaling along with its responses and ramifications on the cascade of OS 
in the aging heart.

OBJECTIVES: Myelofibrosis (MF) is a severe disease, with decreased life 
expectancy and heavy symptom burden. Ruxolitinib is the only approved 
pharmacotherapy for the treatment of MF patients. In Belgium, ruxolitinib is 
only reimbursed for MF patients with splenomegaly for whom the disease is 
categorized as intermediate-2 or high risk. The improvement of symptoms without 
spleen volume reduction is not considered sufficient to continue treatment. The 
aim of this manuscript is to provide guidance for the safe and effective 
administration of ruxolitinib, considering the particularities of the Belgian 
reimbursement criteria.
METHODS: Our recommendations are based on a consensus reached during two 
meetings, where available data and observations derived from clinical experience 
were discussed.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We recommend changing the current Belgian reimbursement 
conditions to include the evaluation of disease-related symptoms along with 
splenomegaly to decide whether ruxolitinib treatment should be continued or not. 
Indeed, the decrease in disease-related symptoms seems to be an equally 
important parameter as the decrease in splenic volume in the evaluation of the 
response to ruxolitinib. We also advocate for the treatment with ruxolitinib of 
MF patients in lower-risk categories with severe disease-related symptoms, as 
this drug could greatly improve their quality of life. Optimization of the 
ruxolitinib dose is recommended to avoid an unnecessary decrease in platelet 
count or hemoglobin that may jeopardize treatment continuation.
CONCLUSION: With the aim to optimize the treatment of MF patients, the Belgian 
regulation for ruxolitinib should be revised in terms of reimbursement criteria, 
dose titration, stopping rules, and patient follow-up.

Hangzhou, China.

This article proposes a comprehensive review of evaluation tools based on life 
cycle thinking, as applied to waste-to-energy. Habitually, life cycle assessment 
is adopted to assess environmental burdens associated with waste-to-energy 
initiatives. Based on this framework, several extension methods have been 
developed to focus on specific aspects: Exergetic life cycle assessment for 
reducing resource depletion, life cycle costing for evaluating its economic 
burden, and social life cycle assessment for recording its social impacts. 
Additionally, the environment-energy-economy model integrates both life cycle 
assessment and life cycle costing methods and judges simultaneously these three 
features for sustainable waste-to-energy conversion. Life cycle assessment is 
sufficiently developed on waste-to-energy with concrete data inventory and 
sensitivity analysis, although the data and model uncertainty are unavoidable. 
Compared with life cycle assessment, only a few evaluations are conducted to 
waste-to-energy techniques by using extension methods and its methodology and 
application need to be further developed. Finally, this article succinctly 
summarises some recommendations for further research.

A Kinetic Model of Nonenzymatic RNA Polymerization by 
Cytidine-5'-phosphoro-2-aminoimidazolide.

The nonenzymatic polymerization of RNA may have enabled copying of functional 
sequences during the origin of life. Recent progress utilizing 
5'-phosphoro-2-aminoimidazole activation has reinvigorated the possibility of 
using nonenzymatic RNA polymerization for copying arbitrary sequences. However, 
the reasons why 2-aminoimidazole (AI) is a superior activation group remain 
unclear. Here we report that the predominant mechanism of polymerization using 
cytidine-5'-phosphoro-2-aminoimidazolide (Cp*) involves a 
2-aminoimidazolium-bridged dinucleotide (Cp*pC) intermediate. To explore the 
role of this intermediate, we first identify and quantify four reactions 
involving the synthesis and breakdown of Cp*pC that occur in the absence of the 
primer-template duplex. We then analyze the dependence of the rate of 
polymerization on the concentration of the Cp*pC intermediate in the presence 
and absence of the competitive inhibitor Cp. We also show that the contribution 
of the monomer Cp* to the polymerization rate is negligible under our primer 
extension conditions. Finally, we use the experimentally determined rate 
constants of these reactions to develop a kinetic model that helps explain the 
changing rate of nonenzymatic RNA polymerization over time. Our model accounts 
for the concentration of Cp*pC formed by Cp* under primer extension conditions. 
The model does not completely account for the decline in polymerization rate 
observed over long times, which indicates that additional important inhibitory 
processes have not yet been identified. Our results suggest that the superiority 
of 2-aminoimidazole over the traditional 2-methylimidazole activation is mostly 
due to the higher level of accumulation of the imidazolium-bridged intermediate 
under primer extension conditions.

INTRODUCTION: Alcohol use is a major risk factor for mortality and morbidity 
burden, and alcohol use disorders contribute markedly to this burden. Effective 
interventions for alcohol use disorders improve health, and are potentially 
cost-effective or even cost saving.
AREAS COVERED: We searched the literature for the cost-effectiveness of alcohol 
interventions. We included behavioral, pharmacological and combined 
interventions, and research from both a health care provider and a societal 
perspective. Overall, many economic research studies pointed towards existing 
cost-beneficial therapies from the perspective of a health care provider; i.e. 
the costs for interventions were smaller than the savings in services delivery 
in the years thereafter. Even if this was not the case, the interventions proved 
to be cost-effective with a threshold below $20,000 per quality-adjusted life 
year.
EXPERT COMMENTARY: While most of the economic research to date shows promising 
results, such research is relatively scarce and not always rigorous. More, and 
more rigorous economic research is needed to fully understand the potential 
impact of alcohol interventions. However, even with this research, something 
needs to be done to reduce stigmatization of alcohol use disorders in order to 
fully reap the benefits of alcohol interventions.

A late presentation of Loeys-Dietz syndrome associated with an aortic root 
aneurysm.

Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is characterised by a mutation in the transforming 
growth factor beta receptor, and is strongly associated with aortic aneurysms 
and rupture. Most cases of LDS present in the second decade of life, with the 
average life expectancy being 37 years. We report a case of suspected LDS (owing 
to significant family history of the disorder) that presented in the seventh 
decade of life. Our patient had aortic root dilation and was initially believed 
to have Marfan syndrome. However, subsequent tests were negative. On further 
investigation of her family history, it was revealed that she had a strong 
positive family history of aortic rupture and aneurysms associated with 
genetically confirmed atypical LDS. By reporting this case, we aim to highlight 
the importance of considering inherited connective tissue disorders when a 
patient presents with aortic aneurysms or dissections associated with a strong 
family history of aortic pathology.

Candida albicans is an inhabitant of mucosal surfaces in healthy individuals but 
also the most common cause of fungal nosocomial blood stream infections, 
associated with high morbidity and mortality. As such life-threatening 
infections often disseminate from superficial mucosal infections we aimed to 
study the use of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in prevention of 
mucosal C. albicans infections. Here, we demonstrate that LGG protects oral 
epithelial tissue from damage caused by C. albicans in our in vitro model of 
oral candidiasis. Furthermore, we provide insights into the mechanisms behind 
this protection and dissect direct and indirect effects of LGG on C. albicans 
pathogenicity. C. albicans viability was not affected by LGG. Instead, 
transcriptional profiling using RNA-Seq indicated dramatic metabolic 
reprogramming of C. albicans. Additionally, LGG had a significant impact on 
major virulence attributes, including adhesion, invasion, and hyphal extension, 
whose reduction, consequently, prevented epithelial damage. This was accompanied 
by glucose depletion and repression of ergosterol synthesis, caused by LGG, but 
also due to blocked adhesion sites. Therefore, LGG protects oral epithelia 
against C. albicans infection by preventing fungal adhesion, invasion and 
damage, driven, at least in parts, by metabolic reprogramming due to nutrient 
limitation caused by LGG.

BACKGROUND: Hospice, a patient-centered care system for those with limited life 
expectancy, is important for enhancing quality of life and is understudied in 
integrated health care systems.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 21,860 decedents with 
advanced-stage lung cancer diagnosed from January 2007 to June 2013 in the 
national US Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Trends over time, geographic 
regional variability, and patient and tumor characteristics associated with 
hospice use and the timing of enrollment were examined. Multivariable logistic 
regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used.
RESULTS: From 2007 to 2013, 70.3% of decedents with advanced-stage lung cancer 
were enrolled in hospice. Among patients in hospice, 52.9% were enrolled in the 
last month of life, and 14.7% were enrolled in the last 3 days of life. Hospice 
enrollment increased (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.07; P < .001), whereas the 
mean time from the cancer diagnosis to hospice enrollment decreased by 65 days 
(relative decrease, 32%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.04; P < .001). Relative 
decreases in late hospice enrollment were observed in the last month (7%; AOR, 
0.98; P = .04) and last 3 days of life (26%; AOR, 0.95; P < .001). The Southeast 
region of the United States had both the highest rate of hospice enrollment and 
the lowest rate of late enrollment. Patient sociodemographic and lung cancer 
characteristics were associated with hospice enrollment.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced-stage lung cancer in the Veterans 
Affairs Health Care System, overall and earlier hospice enrollment increased 
over time. Considerable regional variability in hospice enrollment and the 
persistence of late enrollment suggests opportunities for improvement in 
end-of-life care. Cancer 2018;124:426-33. © 2017 American Cancer Society.

Despite progress in dentistry, tooth loss in old age is still a reality, even 
more so in long-term-care residents. However, recent trends indicate that 
natural teeth are lost later in life. Functional decline and age-related 
pathologies have to be considered in oral health care for this vulnerable 
population. Retaining and restoring teeth and oral function in elders is 
important. Tooth loss significantly impairs masticatory performance, which 
cannot be fully restored by prosthodontic means. Hence an unconscious change in 
food intake occurs, often involving malnutrition and withdrawal from common 
meals. Poor oral appearance and bad breath may further impede social activities. 
Although a chewing activity may be beneficial for cognitive function, natural 
teeth can present a considerable risk for fragile elders, in whom aspiration of 
biofilm can lead to pneumonia and death. The presence of natural teeth is also 
correlated with higher life expectancy, but socio-economic confounding factors 
have to be considered. When evaluating oral health in the elderly population, 
standards and priorities for reporting oral health outcome measures have to be 
defined. Anatomical indicators such as the number of natural teeth or the 
presence of prostheses might be one option for reporting. However, functional 
indicators such as masticatory performance and patient-centred outcome measures 
may be more relevant. In conclusion, there is an overwhelming body of evidence 
that maintaining a healthy natural dentition in old age is beneficial from a 
structural, functional and psycho-social point of view.

Compound promiscuity can be viewed in different ways. We distinguish "bad" 
promiscuity resulting from chemical liabilities, nonspecific binding, or assay 
artifacts, from "good" promiscuity representing true multitarget activities. 
Investigating multitarget activities of small molecules is scientifically 
stimulating and therapeutically relevant. To better understand the molecular 
basis of multitarget activities, structure-promiscuity relationships (SPRs) are 
explored. For this purpose, "promiscuity cliffs" (PCs) have been introduced, 
which can be rationalized as an extension of the activity cliff (AC) concept. A 
PC is defined as a pair of structural analogues that are active against 
different numbers of targets (given a difference threshold). As discussed herein 
PCs frequently capture surprising SPRs and encode many experimentally testable 
hypotheses.

OBJECTIVES: The economic evaluation (EE) of healthcare interventions has become 
a necessity. However, high quality needs to be ensured in order to achieve 
validated results and help making informed decisions. Thus, the objective of the 
present study was to systematically identify and review published pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma-related EEs and to assess their quality.
METHODS: Systematic literature research was conducted in PubMed and Cochrane to 
identify published EEs between 2000 and 2015. The quality of each selected EE 
was assessed by two independent reviewers, using the Drummond's checklist.
RESULTS: Our systematic review was based on 32 EEs and showed a wide variety of 
methodological approaches, including different perspectives, time horizon, and 
cost effectiveness analyses. Nearly two-thirds of EEs are full EEs (n = 21), and 
about one-third of EEs had a Drummond score ≥7, synonymous with 'high quality'. 
Close to 50% of full EEs had a Drummond score ≥7, whereas all of partial EEs had 
a Drummond score <7 (n = 11).
CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 15 years, a lot of interest has been evinced over the 
EE of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and its direct impact on 
therapeutic advances in PDAC. To provide a framework for health care 
decision-making, to facilitate transferability and to lend credibility to health 
EEs, their quality must be improved. For the last 4 years, a tendency towards a 
quality improvement of these studies has been observed, probably coupled with a 
context of rational decision-making in health care, a better and wider spread of 
recommendations and thus, medical practitioners' full endorsement.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between frailty, physical activity 
and depression in community-dwelling geriatric women.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional research design.
SETTING: Community geriatric women in Illan County, Taiwan.
STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Of note 216 participants, 65 years and older with full 
mobility, independent and able to communicate in Mandarin or Taiwanese Hokkien.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: An average weekly physical activity score International 
Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) and Taiwan Geriatric 
Depression Scale. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to 
perform decision analysis.
RESULTS: The average IPAQ-SF score for the 216 participants was 9109.52. When an 
IPAQ-SF score of 4452 or below was obtained by participants, 38% of them 
encountered depression-like syndromes, regardless of their frailty status. 
Diabetes, high risk of metabolic syndrome and lower education were the risk 
factors found to cause depression among participants with low physical activity 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: As women have a longer life expectancy and experience twice the 
rates of depression of men particularly after menopause, healthcare providers 
should emphasize exercise and lifestyle changes in order to improve the quality 
of health in geriatric women.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of the first patient 
self-paying pharmacist-assisted warfarin monitoring (PAWM) program in Taiwan.
DESIGN: A Markov model with a 1-month cycle length and a 20-year time horizon 
was employed in this study. The model is composed of the following eight states: 
three no-event states (i.e. 'subtherapeutic,' 'within therapeutic' and 
'supratherapeutic' states), two serious adverse events (AEs) (i.e. bleeding and 
thromboembolism), two sequelae states and death. The likelihood of events, costs 
and utilities were derived from local databases and literature, if applicable. 
This study was conducted with a payer's perspective and all costs were 
discounted with a rate of 3%.
SETTING: A pharmacist-led clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of 10 000 participants.
INTERVENTION(S): PAWM versus usual care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Average quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and 
cost increments per patient, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: The PAWM program resulted in an average of 0.13 QALYs gained and a cost 
increment of NT$53 850 (US$1683) per patient. As the ICER (NT$410 749 [US$12 
836]) was less than the gross domestic product per capita (NT$631 142 [US$19 
723]), the PAWM was considered to be very cost-effective. The sensitivity 
analyses suggested that our result was robust and that the PAWM program had an 
86% probability of being very cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Even if the costs saved from avoiding AEs were thought to be 
minimal due to the low-medical expenditures in Taiwan, the PAWM program was 
demonstrated to be economical. According to our findings, the policymakers 
should consider reimbursing such a service.

A Markov Analysis of Screening for Late-Onset Cytomegalovirus Disease in 
Cytomegalovirus High-Risk Kidney Transplant Recipients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Management strategies are unclear for late-onset 
cytomegalovirus infection occurring beyond 6 months of antiviral prophylaxis in 
cytomegalovirus high-risk (cytomegalovirus IgG positive to cytomegalovirus IgG 
negative) kidney transplant recipients. Hybrid strategies (prophylaxis followed 
by screening) have been investigated but with inconclusive results. There are 
clinical and potential cost benefits of preventing cytomegalovirus-related 
hospitalizations and associated increased risks of patient and graft failure. We 
used decision analysis to evaluate the utility of postprophylaxis screening for 
late-onset cytomegalovirus infection.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We used the Markov decision 
analysis model incorporating costs and utilities for various cytomegalovirus 
clinical states (asymptomatic cytomegalovirus, mild cytomegalovirus infection, 
and cytomegalovirus infection necessitating hospitalization) to estimate 
cost-effectiveness of postprophylaxis cytomegalovirus screening strategies. Five 
strategies were compared: no screening and screening at 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-week 
intervals. Progression to severe cytomegalovirus infection was modeled on 
cytomegalovirus replication kinetics. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 
calculated as a ratio of cost difference between two strategies to difference in 
quality-adjusted life-years starting with the low-cost strategy. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test model's robustness.
RESULTS: There was an incremental gain in quality-adjusted life-years with 
increasing screening frequency. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $783 
per quality-adjusted life-year (every 4 weeks over no screening), $1861 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (every 3 weeks over every 4 weeks), $10,947 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (every 2 weeks over every 3 weeks), and $197,086 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (weekly over every 2 weeks). Findings were sensitive 
to screening cost, cost of hospitalization, postprophylaxis cytomegalovirus 
incidence, and graft loss after cytomegalovirus infection. No screening was 
favored when willingness to pay threshold was <$14,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year, whereas screening weekly was favored when willingness to pay 
threshold was >$185,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Screening every 2 weeks 
was the dominant strategy between willingness to pay range of $14,000-$185,000 
per quality-adjusted life-year.
CONCLUSIONS: In cytomegalovirus high-risk kidney transplant recipients, compared 
with no screening, screening for postprophylactic cytomegalovirus viremia is 
associated with gains in quality-adjusted life-years and seems to be cost 
effective. A strategy of screening every 2 weeks was the most cost-effective 
strategy across a wide range of willingness to pay thresholds.

Healthcare spending and health outcomes: evidence from selected East African 
countries.

University, Lefkosa, Turkey.

Famagusta, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, total healthcare expenditures, comprised of 
both public and private healthcare expenditures, have increased in most East 
African countries. At the same time, health outcomes such as infant mortality 
rates, life expectancy at birth and other health outcome indicators have 
improved.
OBJECTIVES: This paper examines the association between healthcare expenditures 
and health outcomes for eight East African countries: Burundi, Eritrea, 
Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. In this study, health 
outcomes are defined as an improvement in adult life expectancy and a reduction 
in the number of neonatal, infant, and under-five deaths.
METHODS: We implemented a panel data regression technique, analyzing both 
cross-sectional and time series information. This combined method has been used 
in healthcare studies by several authors. Data obtained from world development 
indicators for the years 2000-2014 was used for the panel study.
RESULTS: First, we documented that there is a strong, positive association 
between total healthcare expenditures and total life expectancy. While we 
identified a positive relationship between healthcare expenditures and female 
and male life expectancy, we found that healthcare had a stronger effect on 
improving life expectancy in females than in males. Moreover, we found a 
negative relationship between healthcare expenditures and the number of 
neonatal, infant, and under-five deaths.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study have important policy and management 
implications for the eight East African countries. From a policy perspective, it 
is necessary to understand if a greater allocation of resources to the 
healthcare sector is worthwhile and to determine whether to encourage private 
healthcare investment. From the management perspective, investing in more 
private institutions, such as hospitals and clinics, is essential for health 
outcomes in the average country. The results of this study can be used by the 
World Health Organization as well as other non-governmental organizations that 
provide financial assistance to East African countries.

BACKGROUND: Concurrent with increase in life expectancy, the prevalence of 
chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD) has also increased. 
Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between healthy 
eating index (HEI) score and CVD risk factors among Iranian elderly.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on a sample of elderly persons 
from Isfahan, Iran, in 2013. Totally, 107 retired subjects were entered in 
statistical analysis. A semi- quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used 
to assess the dietary intake of participants. Anthropometric measurements and 
blood pressure of participants were determined. Fasting blood samples were taken 
for biochemical assessments.
RESULTS: The results of linear regression determined a significant inverse 
association between HEI score and homeostasis model assessment of insulin 
resistance [HOMA-IR, β = -0.238 (-0.426, -0.048)], fasting blood glucose [β = 
-0.194 (-0.383, -0.004)], and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP, β = 
-0.196, (-0.386, -0.005)]. In addition, a significant positive association was 
observed between HEI score and high density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C, β = 
0.196 (0.006, 0.385)] levels. However, after adjusting for confounding 
variables, these significant associations were disappeared except for hs-CRP [β 
= -0.074 (-0.145, -0.003)].
CONCLUSION: Healthy eating index was associated with reduced risk of 
cardiovascular risk factors in old people. It seems that more adherence with 
healthy eating index could provide cardio-protective effects in elderly persons.

Centre, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.

INTRODUCTION: Overall improvement in the living standards of country's 
population is leading to longer life expectancy. To emphasize the medical and 
psychological difficulties faced by geriatric people is essential to know status 
of their quality of life (QOL).
METHODOLOGY: A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out at urban 
field practice area of one of the teaching institutes of Ahmedabad, Gujarat. 
Considering the prevalence of about 7.5% of 60 years and above people sample 
size of 250 was calculated. A predesigned questionnaire related to the QOL of 
elderly people devised by the World Health Organization-QOL was used.
RESULTS: Mean age of the study population was 65.8 years with standard deviation 
of 5 years. Almost two-thirds of geriatrics were currently married and having 
spouse alive. List of common morbidities observed among study population was 
joint pain (42.8%), cataract (32.8%), hypertension (22.4%), diabetes mellitus 
(17.2%), and dental problems (12.4%). Scoring of QOL profile revealed that none 
of the geriatric had poor QOL, whereas 56% fall into category "good" and 50.8% 
had "excellent" QOL. QOL as per four different domains was significantly better 
among males as compared to females. Physical, environmental, and psychological 
domains were better in those who were educated and married individuals living 
with their spouse.
CONCLUSION: Overall QOL was good to excellent. Social characteristics, such as 
education, marital status, and gender, all play role for the perceived QOL among 
the respondents.
