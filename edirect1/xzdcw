BACKGROUND: Few studies have estimated the probability of being cured for cancer 
patients. This study aims to estimate population-based indicators of cancer cure 
in Europe by type, sex, age and period.
METHODS: 7.2 million cancer patients (42 population-based cancer registries in 
17 European countries) diagnosed at ages 15-74 years in 1990-2007 with follow-up 
to 2008 were selected from the EUROCARE-5 dataset. Mixture-cure models were used 
to estimate: (i) life expectancy of fatal cases (LEF); (ii) cure fraction (CF) 
as proportion of patients with same death rates as the general population; (iii) 
time to cure (TTC) as time to reach 5-year conditional relative survival (CRS) 
>95%.
RESULTS: LEF ranged from 10 years for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients to 
<6 months for those with liver, pancreas, brain, gallbladder and lung cancers. 
It was 7.7 years for patients with prostate cancer at age 65-74 years and 
>5 years for women with breast cancer. The CF was 94% for testis, 87% for 
thyroid cancer in women and 70% in men, 86% for skin melanoma in women and 76% 
in men, 66% for breast, 63% for prostate and <10% for liver, lung and pancreatic 
cancers. TTC was <5 years for testis and thyroid cancer patients diagnosed below 
age 55 years, and <10 years for stomach, colorectal, corpus uteri and melanoma 
patients of all ages. For breast and prostate cancers, a small excess 
(CRS < 95%) remained for at least 15 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Estimates from this analysis should help to reduce unneeded 
medicalization and costs. They represent an opportunity to improve patients' 
quality of life.

The effects of the preharvest application of calcium chloride (1 and 2%), 
salicylic acid (1 and 2 mM), and putrescine (1 and 2 mM) on the quality 
attributes and biochemical changes of two ber (Ziziphus mauritiana Lamk.) 
genotypes ("Sibi" and "Khormaee") were investigated at harvest and after 30 days 
of storage (5 ± 1°C and 85 ± 5% RH). The results showed that softening and 
weight loss in the treated fruit were significantly lower in comparison with the 
control. The antioxidant capacity of the fruit was higher in treated fruit than 
the control. Moreover, all the treatments significantly reduced the polyphenol 
oxidase (PPO) activity, increased the catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) 
activities, and prevented the quick color change of ber fruit. The best overall 
visual quality (OVQ) was observed in the fruit treated with calcium chloride 
(1.5%) and putrescine (2 mM). Compared to the two genotypes, "Khormaee" showed a 
better appearance, relative to the "Sibi" genotypes. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Ber 
(Ziziphus mauritiana Lamk.) fruit is a popular fruit which is cultivated widely 
in the tropical and subtropical countries of the world, due to its high 
nutritional value. It is rich in bioactive compounds and minerals. However, 
Indian jujube as a climacteric fruit is highly perishable and have a limited 
shelf life due to softening, browning, and shrinking. So that, the researchers 
still need more challenge to keep the quality of this fruit for consumers. In 
this study, the results showed that the preharvest application of calcium 
chloride (1.5%), putrescine (2 mM), and salicylic acid (2 mM) effectively kept 
the total quality of the Indian jujube fruit during storage by improving the 
firmness of the fruit, retarding the color change and browning, increasing the 
antioxidant enzymes such as; CAT and POD, and preserving the higher ascorbic 
acid. Therefore, these treatments can be useful to maintain the quality of 
Indian jujube during storage.

Incorporation of Reversible Electroporation Into Electrolysis Accelerates 
Apoptosis for Rat Liver Tissue.

Tissue electrolysis is an alternative modality that uses a low intensity direct 
electric current passing through at least 2 electrodes within the tissue and 
resulting electrochemical products including chlorine and hydrogen. These 
products induce changes in pH around electrodes and cause dehydration resulting 
from electroosmotic pressure, leading to changes in microenvironment and thus 
metabolism of the tissues, yielding apoptosis. The procedure requires adequate 
time for electrochemical reactions to yield products sufficient to induce 
apoptosis of the tissues. Incorporation of electroporation into electrolysis can 
decrease the treatment time and enhance the efficiency of electrolytic ablation. 
Electroporation causes permeabilization in the cell membrane allowing the efflux 
of potassium ions and extension of the electrochemical area, facilitating the 
electrolysis process. However, little is known about the combined effects on 
apoptosis in liver ablation. In this study, we performed an immunohistochemical 
evaluation of apoptosis for the incorporation of electroporation into 
electrolysis in liver tissues. To do so, the study was performed with 
microelectrodes for fixed treatment time while the applied voltage varied to 
increase the applied total energy for electrolysis. The apoptotic rate for 
electrolytic ablation increased with enhanced applied energy. The apoptotic rate 
was 4.31 ± 1.73 times that of control in the synergistic combination compared to 
1.49 ± 0.33 times that of the control in electrolytic ablation alone. 
Additionally, tissue structure was better preserved in synergistic combination 
ablation compared to electrolysis with an increment of 3.8 mA. Thus, synergistic 
ablation may accelerate apoptosis and be a promising modality for the treatment 
of liver tumors.

University, Gaza, Palestine.

BACKGROUND: Aging population and life expectancy are increasing globally, to 
cope with this trend, successful aging (SA) attracted the attention of 
gerontology research to determine its prevalence, risk factors, and its 
correlates. However, the published research about SA and older adult's health 
are sparse in Palestine.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and correlates of SA, 
normal aging, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among Palestinian older adults 
in Hebron governorates.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during March 2018-May 2018 among 
a total of 185 participants selected by stratified random sampling from five 
different areas in Hebron governance. SA was defined based on the 
multidimentional model; absence of chronic diseases, normal functional status 
with complete independency, maintains normal cognitive and psychological 
function and social engagement. Sociodemographic data, nutrition, and health 
status were also collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: The prevalence of SA among older Palestinians (22.2%), usual aging 
(58.9%), and the MCI (18.9%), with no significant difference in the prevalence 
between men and women P <0.05. The most prevalent subdomain is independent 
living skill (77.8%) and the lowest is the absence of chronic diseases (30.8%). 
SA was associated with younger older age (60-70 years), still working, and 
well-nourished participants.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study revealed, successful aging is associated 
with younger age, still working and good nutritional status. Further research 
with appropriate methodology different parts of Palestine is required.

Rehabilitation in Warsaw, Poland.

BACKGROUND: According to WHO statistics, injuries are among the main causes of 
contemporary health problems. Injury statistics have been showing a continuing 
upward trend over years. This is due to numerous factors, such as technological 
progress, increased life expectancy, change of lifestyle, growing popularity of 
sports and changes in working conditions. The structures affected by injuries 
within the knee joint include the ligaments, menisci, articular cartilage and 
patellar retinacula, with the most common injuries being those to the 
ligamentous apparatus and menisci. The main objective of this paper is to 
determine the number of patients hospitalised due to a primary knee injury.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Determination of the number of patients hospitalised due 
to a primary knee injury was performed using the API Interface of National 
Health Fund (NFZ) Statistics-Benefits Version 1.0. The process of acquiring 
information on the number of patients consisted of four stages: preparation of a 
list of primary diagnoses according to ICD-10 classification, analysis of the 
ordinances of the President of NFZ concerning the conclusion and implementation 
of contracts on hospital treatment to select products that could be used to bill 
hospitalisation of patients with selected types of diagnosis, generating medical 
data using the API Interface of National Health Fund Statistics-Benefits and 
analysis of reporting data obtained.
RESULTS: According to data reported to NFZ, a total of 101,773 patients were 
hospitalised due to traumatic knee injuries over the period of three years 
(2016-2018), which gives an average of ca. 34,000 patients annually.
CONCLUSIONS: 1. Knee injuries represent a very serious health problem in Poland. 
2. Knee injuries most frequently affect the ligaments and menisci. 3. It seems 
necessary to develop a complete nation-wide database with up-to-date information 
on injuries in Poland that would enable providers to adapt medical services to 
the current needs of the patients.

IMPORTANCE: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is frequently driven by 
oncogenic KIT variations. Imatinib targeting of KIT marked a new era in GIST 
treatment and ushered in precision oncological treatment for all solid malignant 
neoplasms. However, studies on the molecular biological traits of GIST have 
found that tumors respond differentially to imatinib dosage based on the KIT 
exon with variation. Despite this knowledge, few patients undergo genetic 
testing at diagnosis, and empirical imatinib therapy remains routine. Barriers 
to genetic profiling include concerns about the cost and utility of testing.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether targeted gene testing (TGT) is a cost-effective 
diagnostic for patients with metastatic GIST from the US payer perspective.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation developed a Markov 
model to compare the cost-effectiveness of TGT and tailored first-line therapy 
compared with empirical imatinib therapy among patients with a new diagnosis of 
metastatic GIST. The main health outcome, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
and costs were obtained from the literature, and transitional probabilities were 
modeled from disease progression and survival estimates from randomized clinical 
trials of patients with metastatic GIST. Data analyses were conducted October 
2019 to January 2020.
EXPOSURE: TGT and tailored first-line therapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was QALYs and cost. 
Cost-effectiveness was defined using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, 
with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than $100 000/QALY considered 
cost-effective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
assess model stability.
RESULTS: Therapy directed by TGT was associated with an increase of 0.10 QALYs 
at a cost of $9513 compared with the empirical imatinib approach, leading to an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $92 100. These findings were sensitive 
to the costs of TGT, drugs, and health utility model inputs. Therapy directed by 
TGT remained cost-effective for genetic testing costs up to $3730. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis found that TGT-directed therapy was considered 
cost-effective 70% of the time.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that using genetic testing to 
match treatment of KIT variations to imatinib dosing is a cost-effective 
approach compared with empirical imatinib.

Ideas About Resourcing Health Care in the United States: Can Economic Evaluation 
Achieve Meaningful Use?

York, York, United Kingdom (W.V.P.).

The United States is one of the few high-income countries not to apply economic 
evaluation routinely to health care decision making on a national level, yet it 
excels at spending least efficiently on health care. In the interest of 
continuing to develop new solutions to curb spending on health care and reduce 
waste in the United States, perhaps now is an important moment to reconsider the 
benefits of economic evaluation and the barriers that must be overcome to have 
it emerge as a solution for health care institutions and the patients they 
serve. This article offers several distinct considerations to make economic 
evaluation methods (such as cost-effectiveness analysis) an effective component 
of value-based decision making in the United States. These considerations 
include overcoming the barriers presented by opportunity costs, spending on 
health care services versus biomedical technologies, phasing out low-value care, 
using value of information to prioritize resources, and determining what to do 
with the quality-adjusted life-year. These issues need to be addressed to 
achieve a collective purpose for economic evaluation at state and national 
levels.

BACKGROUND: Digitalisation affects 90% of healthcare. Digital health, however, 
does not only refer to technological transformation but also has considerable 
cultural and social consequences. It fundamentally reshapes the roles of 
physicians and patients, as well as their relationship. Moreover, from the 
second half of the 20th century, the growing number of chronic patients and the 
increase in life expectancy have posed new challenges to the medical workforce.
OBJECTIVES: To explore the digitally engaged physician's knowledge and attitudes 
towards digital health technologies and the transformation of the doctor-patient 
relationship.
METHODS: A qualitative interview study analysed with Interpretative 
Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The study is based on qualitative, 
semi-structured interviews with 11 digitally engaged physicians from 9 
countries. We identified four main themes emerging from e-physicians' responses 
and experience: 1) the past: intentions and experiences of change, 2) the 
present: the role of digital health and technology in the medical practice and 
their everyday challenges, 3) the present: the practical and ideal 
physician-patient relationship, and 4) the future: skills and competencies 
needed for working with e-patients and visions about the future of the medical 
practice.
RESULTS: The interviewed physicians state that digital health solutions could 
create a deeper doctor-patient relationship: knowledgeable patients are a huge 
help in the joint work effort and technology is the main tool for creating a 
more involved and responsible patient. Medical professionals in the future might 
rather get a role as a translator between technical data and the patient; as a 
guide in the jungle of digital health. However, the interviewed physicians also 
noted that digital transition today is more beneficial to patients than to their 
doctors.
CONCLUSIONS: We state that digitally engaged physicians are characterized by a 
kind of dichotomy: they use digital opportunities enthusiastically, but they 
also feel the difficulties related to digital health.

Life expectancy of contemporary cardiac pacemakers is limited due to the use of 
an internal primary battery. Repeated device replacement interventions are 
necessary, which leads to an elevated risk for patients and an increase of 
health care costs. The aim of our study is to investigate the feasibility of 
powering an endocardial pacemaker by converting a minimal amount of the heart's 
kinetic energy into electric energy. The intrinsic cardiac muscle activity makes 
it an ideal candidate as continuous source of energy for endocardial pacemakers. 
For this reason, we developed a prototype able to generate enough power to 
supply a pacing circuit at different heart rates. The prototype consists of a 
mass imbalance that drives an electromagnetic generator while oscillating. We 
developed a mathematical model to estimate the amount of energy harvested from 
the right ventricle. Finally, the implemented prototype was successfully tested 
during in-vitro and in-vivo experiments.

Fabry Disease (FD) is a systemic disorder that can result in cardiovascular, 
renal, and neurovascular disease leading to reduced life expectancy. FD should 
be considered in the differential of all patients with unexplained left 
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We therefore performed a prospective screening 
study in Edmonton and Hong Kong using Dried Blood Spot (DBS) testing on patients 
with undiagnosed LVH. Participants found to have unexplained LVH on 
echocardiography were invited to participate and subsequently subjected to DBS 
testing. DBS testing was used to measure α-galactosidase (α-GAL) enzyme activity 
and for mutation analysis of the α-galactosidase (GLA) gene, both of which are 
required to make a diagnosis of FD. DBS testing was performed as a screening 
tool on patients (n = 266) in Edmonton and Hong Kong, allowing for detection of 
five patients with FD (2% prevalence of FD) and one patient with 
hydroxychloroquine-induced phenocopy. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) by GLA 
genotype showed a higher LVMI in patients with IVS4 + 919G > A mutations 
compared to those without the mutation. Two patients were initiated on ERT and 
hydroxychloroquine was discontinued in the patient with a phenocopy of FD. 
Overall, we detected FD in 2% of our screening cohort using DBS testing as an 
effective and easy to administer screening tool in patients with unexplained 
LVH. Utilizing DBS testing to screen for FD in patients with otherwise 
undiagnosed LVH is clinically important due to the availability of effective 
therapies and the value of cascade screening in extended families.

Although females in human and the great ape populations reach the end of 
fertility at similar ages (approximately 45 years), female humans often live 
well beyond their post-fertile years, while female primates typically die before 
or shortly after the end of fertility. The grandmother hypothesis proposes that 
the care-giving role provided by post-fertile females contributed to the 
evolution of longevity in human populations. When post-fertile females provide 
care for weaned infants, mothers are able to have their next baby sooner without 
compromising the chances of survival of their previous offspring. Thus, the 
post-menopausal longevity that is unique to human populations may be an 
evolutionary adaptation. In this work, we construct, simulate, and analyze an 
ordinary differential equations mathematical model to study the grandmother 
hypothesis. Our model describes the passage of the individuals of a population 
through five life stages in the cases with and without grandmothering. We 
demonstrate via numerical simulation of the mathematical model that 
grandmothering care is sufficient to significantly increase adult life 
expectancy. We also investigate the relationship between the number of weaned 
infants that a post-fertile female can care for at a given time and the 
steady-state age distributions of a population.

INTRODUCTION: Decision making in refractory colorectal cancer (rCRC) is 
challenging, with limited data available to predict patient outcome. We 
conducted a study to assess the pace of cancer progression as a potential 
prognostic and decision tool.
METHODS: CORIOLAN was a prospective, single-center, single-arm trial recruiting 
refractory CRC patients with an ECOG performance status of ≤1 and an estimated 
life expectancy of ≥12 weeks. 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) scan and blood sample collection 
were carried out at baseline and after 2 weeks with no cancer treatment given 
between these timepoints. The primary objective was to evaluate the association 
between pace of cancer progression as defined by changes of the whole-body 
metabolically active tumor volume (WB-MATV) and overall survival (OS). 
Exploratory objectives included evaluation of the prognostic value of 
circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and 
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).
RESULTS: 47 eligible patients who had received a median number of 5 (range 2-8) 
prior treatments were enrolled. At the time of analysis, 45 deaths had occurred, 
with 26% of patients dying within 12 weeks. The median OS was 6.3 months (range 
0.4-14.3). The median relative delta between WB-MATV at baseline and 2 weeks was 
+21%. Changes of WB-MATV, however, failed to predict OS (hazard ratio (HR) 1.3, 
p = 0.383). Similarly, no association was observed between changes of any of the 
circulating biomarkers investigated and prognosis. By contrast, high WB-MATV 
(4.2 versus 9.4 months; HR 3.1, p = 0.003), high CEA (4.4 versus 7.0 months; HR 
1.9, p = 0.053), high cfDNA (4.7 versus 7.0 months; HR 2.2, p = 0.015) and high 
CTC count (3.3 versus 7.5 months; HR 6.5, p < 0.001) at baseline were associated 
with worse OS.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, approximately 1 out of 4 refractory CRC patients who 
were judged to have a life expectancy >12 weeks actually died within 12 weeks. 
Baseline assessment of WB-MATV, cfDNA, CTCs and CEA, but not early change 
evaluation of the same, may help to refine patient prognostication and guide 
management decisions.

Thyroid carcinoma represents a complex pathology that can still be considered a 
medical challenge, despite having a better prognosis and life expectancy than 
most other neoplasms; also the scenario of multiple malignancies involving 
thyroid cancer is nowadays a common reality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the literature regarding the aggressive 
presentation of synchronous thyroid and breast cancer. In the current paper, we 
report the case of a 59 years-old woman, diagnosed with invasive ductal breast 
carcinoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma, presenting a natural history of both 
aggressive synchronous tumors. At the moment of hospitalization, the diagnosis 
was breast carcinoma with multiple secondary lesions, suggestive of lung and 
bone metastases, and nodular goiter.
RESULTS: Searching the literature in PUBMED with the terms "thyroid carcinoma 
and synchronous breast carcinoma, we found 86 studies; introducing the term 
"aggressive," the result included 4 studies, among which, none showed to be 
relevant to the terms aggressive and synchronous. A similar search was done in 
SCOPUS finding 92 documents and after introducing the term aggressive, the 
number of papers was 8, none including the literature on synchronous aggressive 
metastatic thyroid and breast carcinoma. A majority of imaging diagnostic tools 
were used in this particular medical case in order to ensure the best potential 
outcome. The final diagnosis was papillary thyroid carcinoma with lung and 
unusual multiple bone metastases and synchronous invasive ductal breast 
carcinoma with subcutaneous metastases.
CONCLUSION: The case illustrates the challenges in the correct assessment of 
oncologic patients, despite the advances in medical imaging and technologies and 
underlines the essential role of nuclear medicine procedures in the diagnostic 
and therapy protocols.

INTRODUCTION: For older adults with type 2 diabetes, the American Diabetes 
Association (ADA) Framework uses comorbidities and functional status to 
categorize patients by estimated life expectancy to guide individualization of 
glycemic treatment. We evaluated whether modifying the ADA Framework by removing 
three comorbidities and incorporating age could improve life expectancy 
stratification and better identify patients likely to benefit from intensive 
treatment.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined 3166 Health and Retirement Study 
participants aged ≥65 with diabetes from 1998 to 2004, using a prospective 
cohort design with mortality follow-up through 2016. We classified participants 
into one of three ADA Framework categories: Healthy, Intermediate Health, and 
Poor Health. We created modified categories by excluding comorbidities weakly 
associated with mortality (hypertension, arthritis, and incontinence). Using 
Gompertz regression, we estimated life expectancy across age strata for both 
original and modified ADA Framework categories.
RESULTS: The original ADA Framework classified 34% as Healthy (likely to benefit 
from intensive treatment), 50% as Intermediate Health, and 16% as Poor Health 
(unlikely to benefit from intensive treatment). Our comorbidity modification 
reclassified 20% of participants from Intermediate Health to Healthy. Using the 
modified ADA Framework, median life expectancy of the Healthy varied greatly by 
age (aged 65-69: 16.3 years; aged ≥80: 7.6 years), indicating differing 
likelihood of benefit. Additionally, age ≥80 made extended life expectancy 
unlikely (median life expectancy for Healthy 7.6 years, Intermediate Health 5.9 
years, Poor Health 2.5 years), suggesting adults ≥80 are unlikely to benefit 
from intensive treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Modifying the ADA Framework by incorporating age and focusing on 
comorbidities associated with mortality improved life expectancy stratification, 
resulting in different treatment recommendations for many older adults.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Hypothalamic-pituitary (HT-P) dysfunction is one of the most 
common endocrine late effects following cranial radiotherapy. However, there are 
currently no specific data describing this complication in adult-onset cancer 
patients after whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). The present cohort study aims to 
establish the prevalence of HT-P axis dysfunction in this group of patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six cancer patients previously treated with WBRT 
(median follow-up=20.5 months) received standardized endocrine check-up focusing 
on HT-P function.
RESULTS: In 50% of the patients, impaired hypothalamic-pituitary function was 
detected during follow-up. While functional loss of a single hormonal axis was 
evident in 34.6% of patients, 7.7% showed an impairment of multiple endocrine 
axes, and one patient developed adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency. 
Hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction did not directly correlate with the applied 
WBRT total doses.
CONCLUSION: In our cohort, hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction appeared to be 
common after WBRT and was diagnosed as early as 6 months following radiation. 
This finding highlights the need for routine endocrine follow-up even in 
patients with limited life expectancy.

and survival in fed and fasting Drosophila.

Lipins are eukaryotic proteins with functions in lipid synthesis and the 
homeostatic control of energy balance. They execute these functions by acting as 
phosphatidate phosphatase enzymes in the cytoplasm and by changing gene 
expression after translocation into the cell nucleus, in particular under 
fasting conditions. Here, we asked whether nuclear translocation and the 
enzymatic activity of Drosophila Lipin serve essential functions and how gene 
expression changes, under both fed and fasting conditions, when nuclear 
translocation is impaired. To address these questions, we created a Lipin null 
mutant, a mutant expressing Lipin lacking a nuclear localization signal 
(LipinΔNLS ), and a mutant expressing enzymatically dead Lipin. Our data support 
the conclusion that the enzymatic but not nuclear gene regulatory activity of 
Lipin is essential for survival. Notably, adult LipinΔNLS flies were not only 
viable but also exhibited improved life expectancy. In contrast, they were 
highly susceptible to starvation. Both the improved life expectancy in the fed 
state and the decreased survival in the fasting state correlated with changes in 
metabolic gene expression. Moreover, increased life expectancy of fed flies was 
associated with a decreased metabolic rate. Interestingly, in addition to 
metabolic genes, genes involved in feeding behavior and the immune response were 
misregulated in LipinΔNLS flies. Altogether, our data suggest that the nuclear 
activity of Lipin influences the genomic response to nutrient availability with 
effects on life expectancy and starvation resistance. Thus, nutritional or 
therapeutic approaches that aim at lowering nuclear translocation of lipins in 
humans may be worth exploring.

INTRODUCTION: While guidelines recommend against routine colorectal cancer 
screening in adults >75 years and/or those with limited life expectancies, there 
is no clear guidance on when surveillance colonoscopies following prior adenoma 
detection should stop. How primary care clinicians weigh the potential risks and 
benefits of surveillance colonoscopies in older adults with prior adenomas is 
unknown.
METHODS: We conducted semistructured in-person interviews with 30 primary care 
clinicians from 21 clinics in Maryland. We asked how clinicians decided whether 
to continue or stop surveillance colonoscopies in older adults (65+ years) with 
prior adenomas. Interview transcripts were independently coded by 2 
investigators using qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: Participants described a range of decision-making approaches. Some 
deferred to specialists because they did not feel confident making decisions 
about stopping surveillance in light of the higher cancer risk involved. Some 
took a more active role and discussed the decision with patients and/or 
specialists. Other clinicians felt comfortable stopping surveillance 
colonoscopies and made these decisions based on patient age, comorbidities, or 
life expectancy.
DISCUSSION: We found a range of decision-making approaches among primary care 
clinicians on whether to continue surveillance colonoscopies in older adults 
with prior adenomas. Separate bodies of evidence currently exist on how prior 
adenoma characteristics influence colorectal cancer risk and on how older age 
and declining health influence the benefit/harm balance of screening. 
Information is lacking on the benefits and harms of surveillance in older adults 
with prior adenomas. Developing the evidence to address this knowledge gap is 
critically needed to inform clinical decision making.

BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) still remains the 
gold-standard bariatric procedure. Short-term weight loss and improvement of 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) after LRYGB are well-documented. Little data are 
available on long-term weight loss and continued remission of DM2 in these 
patients.
METHODS: This study reports on weight loss and remission of DM2 in 576 
consecutive patients who underwent primary LRYGB between August 2001 and August 
2009 with at least 10-year follow up. All patients were treated at a single 
institution by a single surgeon. All data were collected and entered into the 
database prospectively.
RESULTS: A total of 576 patients were included in the study. Patients' mean age 
was 38.2 ± 10.9 years and females represented 88.2% of patients. Patients' 
ethnicity was diverse, including African Americans (44.4%), Caucasians (34.0%), 
Hispanics (18.1%), and 3.5% from other backgrounds. On average, there were 
6.9 ± 2.7 comorbidities per patient and DM2 was initially present in 150/576 
patients (26.0%). Mean preoperative weight and BMI were 132.4 ± 22.0 kg and 
48.3 ± 6.7 kg/m2, respectively. Ten-year follow-up reporting rate was 145/576 
(25.2%). Maximum weight loss occurred at 18 months (mean weight 83.4 ± 16.5 kg, 
mean BMI 30.5 ± kg/m2). At 10 years, mean weight was maintained at 
94.8 ± 20.5 kg and mean BMI was 34.3 ± 6.8 kg/m2. The average weight regain 
between one and ten years was 8.27 kg. Among patients with preoperative DM2, 
continued remission of DM2 at 10 years occurred in 19/32 (59.4%) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: LRYGB provides durable long-term weight loss, as well as successful 
remission of DM2 at 10 years. More long-term follow-up studies evaluating weight 
loss and comorbidities extending beyond the initial 10-year period are needed. 
Such studies are essential for projecting late outcomes of LRYGB, particularly 
in younger patients with life expectancy exceeding several decades.

BACKGROUND: Malignant intrinsic brain tumors are a hazardous disease with 
limited life expectancy despite intensive research in new targeted treatment 
options. Lately, proteasome inhibitors have been identified as potent agents 
causing death in glioma cell lines. It is the aim of the present study to 
identify proteasomal activity in the CSF of patients suffering from malignant 
brain tumors.
METHODS: A total of 24 patients with histological confirmed brain tumors (12 
malignant gliomas, 12 metastases) were included and CSF probes preoperatively 
analyzed for concentration and enzymatic activity of free circulating 
proteasome. Tumor volumina were assessed using the preoperative MRI and 
correlated with the CSF findings. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 
(18.0.3; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
RESULTS: Extracellular proteasomes were found in all CSF samples showing 
enzymatic activity. Proteasome concentrations (28 ng/mL and 23 ng/mL, resp.) 
were elevated compared to a historical control group. Proteasomal enzymatic 
chymotrypsin-like activity was significantly raised in patients with gliomas 
(mean 31 fkat/ mL) compared to controls (P<0.049), whereas the enzymatic 
activity was not significantly elevated in metastases (P=0.109). In gliomas, 
neither concentration nor enzymatic activity correlated with the preoperative 
assessed tumor volume.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study clearly showed that the proteasomal activity in 
the CSF is significantly elevated in patients with intrinsic brain tumors. 
Further studies need to identify the proteasomal concentration and enzymatic 
activity as a potential biomarker for the effectiveness of any treatment and for 
the early diagnosis of a possible recurrence of the disease.

Nowadays, as life expectancy grows, the healthcare industry faces growing 
challenges related to corresponding increases in chronic diseases. Home care 
services (HCS) are the solution to this growing problem. It's a general premise 
that information and communication technology (ICT) can address these health 
issues and enhances HCS. The scope of our study was the active managerial and 
supervisory roles of these technologies within HCS. The study aimed to extract, 
accumulate, and classify the challenges of using active ICT for elderly HCS. We 
employed the keywords, their synonyms, and their combinations into the searching 
areas of title, keywords, and abstract. More than 300 resources were collected, 
and found those 33 articles of those 33 articles were eligible for our study. 
Later, a team of experts provided their opinions on our gatherings, which were 
collected individually. According to the expert team's opinions, researchers 
classified challenges into; technology, human factors, and management.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In France, there are approximately 2,400 new cases of 
neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) annually. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy 
with 177Lu-Dotatate plus long-acting repeatable [LAR] octreotide 30 mg has been 
shown to significantly improve progression-free survival and overall survival 
relative to high-dose octreotide LAR 60 mg in patients with unresectable or 
metastatic progressive midgut NETs. A long-term cost-effectiveness analysis was 
performed to assess whether 177Lu-Dotatate is a cost-effective option versus 
octreotide 60 mg for patients with unresectable/metastatic progressive midgut 
NETs from the perspective of French healthcare payer.
METHODS: The analysis was performed using a three-state partitioned survival 
model. In the base case analysis 177Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide LAR 30 mg was 
compared with high-dose octreotide LAR 60 mg in patients with midgut NETs.
