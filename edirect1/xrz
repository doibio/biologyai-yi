Biology of aging is well understood at a descriptive level. Based on these data, 
biogerontological research is now able to develop various possibilities for 
intervention. A promising approach for the identification of gerontogenes and 
gerontogenic processes is through the hormetic effects of mild stress on slowing 
down aging. Although there are several issues remaining to be resolved, 
specially with regard to the notion of mild stress, application of hormesis in 
aging research and therapy is a powerful new approach.

Arthroplasty with a metal radial head for unreconstructible fractures of the 
radial head.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of unreconstructible comminuted fractures of the radial 
head remains controversial. There is limited information on the outcome of 
management of these injuries with arthroplasty with a metal radial head implant.
METHODS: The functional outcomes of arthroplasties with a metal radial head 
implant for the treatment of twenty-five displaced, unreconstructible fractures 
of the radial head in twenty-four consecutive patients (mean age, fifty-four 
years) were evaluated at a mean of thirty-nine months (minimum, two years). 
There were ten Mason type-III and fifteen Mason-Johnston type-IV injuries. Two 
of these injuries were isolated, and twenty-three were associated with other 
elbow fractures and/or ligamentous injuries.
RESULTS: At the time of follow-up, Short Form-36 (SF-36) summary scores 
suggested that overall health-related quality of life was within the normal 
range (physical component = 47 +/- 10, and mental component = 49 +/- 13). Other 
outcome scales indicated mild disability of the upper extremity (Disabilities of 
the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score = 17 +/- 19), wrist (Patient-Rated Wrist 
Evaluation score = 17 +/- 21 and Wrist Outcome Score = 60 +/- 10), and elbow 
(Mayo Elbow Performance Index = 80 +/- 16). According to the Mayo Elbow 
Performance Index, three results were graded as poor; five, as fair; and 
seventeen, as good or excellent. The poor and fair outcomes were associated with 
concomitant injury in two patients, a history of a psychiatric disorder in 
three, comorbidity in two, a Workers' Compensation claim in two, and litigation 
in one. Subjective patient satisfaction averaged 9.2 on a scale of 1 to 10. 
Elbow flexion of the injured extremity averaged 140 degrees +/- 9 degrees; 
extension, -8 degrees +/- 7 degrees; pronation, 78 degrees +/- 9 degrees; and 
supination, 68 degrees +/- 10 degrees. A significant loss of elbow flexion and 
extension and of forearm supination occurred in the affected extremity, which 
also had significantly less strength of isometric forearm pronation (17%) and 
supination (18%) as well as significantly less grip strength (p < 0.05). 
Asymptomatic bone lucencies surrounded the stem of the implant in seventeen of 
the twenty-five elbows. Valgus stability was restored, and proximal radial 
migration did not occur. Complications, all of which resolved, included one 
complex regional pain syndrome, one ulnar neuropathy, one posterior interosseous 
nerve palsy, one episode of elbow stiffness, and one wound infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with a metal radial head implant for a severely 
comminuted radial head fracture will have mild-to-moderate impairment of the 
physical capability of the elbow and wrist. At the time of short-term follow-up, 
arthroplasty with a metal radial head implant was found to have been a safe and 
effective treatment option for patients with an unreconstructible radial head 
fracture; however, long-term follow-up is still needed.

Implant-supported mandibular telescopic prostheses in oral cancer patients: an 
up to 9-year retrospective study.

Hufelandstrasse 55, 45122 Essen, Germany. TJWeischer@t-online.de

PURPOSE: The aim of this retrospective study was to present the results of 
implant-supported telescopic prostheses in the mandible after removal of 
malignant tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1991 and 2000, 24 patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma (16 irradiated, eight nonirradiated) underwent mandibular 
rehabilitation with implant-supported telescopic prostheses. A total of 111 
dental implants were placed. Treatment complications were observed. The 
cumulative survival rates of the implants and prostheses were evaluated by 
lifetable analysis.
RESULTS: Within a mean follow-up period of 30 months (1 to 108 months), only 
three implants failed. All other implants are still in function. Of 24 patients, 
23 were satisfied with their implant-supported telescopic restorations. Soft 
tissue, implant, or prosthetic complications occurred very rarely. The 
cumulative implant survival rate was about 97% and the cumulative prosthesis 
survival rate was about 95% at 9 years.
CONCLUSION: Implants and implant-supported telescopic maxillofacial prostheses 
can successfully remain in function over a long period. Increased implant and 
prosthetic complications should not be expected. Therefore, telescopic implant 
attachments seem to be very useful as a treatment option for prosthetic 
restoration of the mandible in tumor patients.

Changes in the quality of life: a major goal of cardiac rehabilitation.

Shephard RJ(1), Franklin B.

royjshep@mountain-inter.net

BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QOL) is a major goal in the context of preventive 
and therapeutic cardiology. In this article, quality of life concepts are 
reviewed, factors limiting QOL in cardiac disease are identified, methods of 
measurement are explored, and clinically significant changes are defined. The 
changes effected by cardiac rehabilitation are considered, together with their 
physiological and psychological correlates. A final section suggests avenues for 
future research.
METHODS: Relevant articles were identified by computer literature searches and 
review of extensive personal files.
FINDINGS: In the past, there has been an excessive focus on extending the length 
rather than the quality of the cardiac patient's life. The overall QOL is a 
broad concept, influenced by personal perceptions, coping mechanisms, and 
environmental constraints. The ideal test instrument would be reliable, valid, 
and responsive to clinical change. Potential options include a Gestalt-type 
instrument, a disease-specific instrument, a function-specific instrument, or a 
detailed generic questionnaire. There have been relatively few comparisons 
between these potential approaches. Currently, the Standard Gamble 
(Gestalt-type), and Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (disease-specific 
type), and the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey 
(generic-type) are among the most popular approaches. Problems arise in 
distinguishing a clinically important from a statistically significant change; 
commonly a score change of 1 standard error of the mean is regarded as 
clinically important. Correlations of scores with clinical, physiological, and 
psychological change are sometimes weak, in part because of floor and ceiling 
effects. Nevertheless, potential gains in QOL provide a stronger argument for 
preventive and therapeutic programs than do increases in longevity.
CONCLUSIONS: The current literature supports the value of QOL measurements in 
the management of patients with cardiac disease. However, further research is 
needed to determine the optimum test instrument, and the best method of 
interpreting resultant scores.

Intervention Research, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53202, USA.

Adults with severe mental illness are at high risk for human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) infection and transmission. Small-group interventions that focus on 
sexual communication, condom use skills, and motivation to practice safer sex 
have been shown to be effective at helping mentally ill persons reduce their 
risk for HIV. However, the cost-effectiveness of these interventions has not 
been established. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a 9-session small-group 
intervention for women with mental illness recruited from community mental 
health clinics in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We used standard techniques of 
cost-utility analysis to determine the cost per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) saved by the intervention. This analysis indicated that the intervention 
cost $679 per person, and over $136,000 per QALY saved. When the analysis was 
restricted to the subset of women who reported having engaged in vaginal or anal 
intercourse in the 3 months prior to the baseline assessment, the cost per QALY 
saved dropped to approximately $71,000. These estimates suggest that this 
intervention is marginally cost-effective in comparison with other health 
promotion interventions, especially if high-risk, sexual-active women are 
preferentially recruited.

This report describes trends, predictors, and causes of mortality in persons 
with cerebral palsy (CP) using individuals identified by the Western Australian 
Cerebral Palsy Register and born between 1958 and 1994. Two thousand and 
fourteen people were identified (1154 males, 860 females), of whom 225 had died 
by 1 June 1997. Using date-of-death data, crude and standardized mortality rates 
were estimated and predictors of mortality sought using survival analysis 
stratified by decade of birth, description of impairments, and demographic and 
perinatal variables. For those born after 1967, the cause of death profile was 
examined over time. Mortality exceeded 1% per annum in the first 5 years and 
declined to age 15 years after which it remained steady at about 0.35% for the 
next 20 years. The strongest single predictor was intellectual disability, but 
all forms of disability contributed to decreased life expectancy. Half of those 
with IQ/DQ score <20 survived to adulthood, increasing to 76% with IQ/DQ score 
20-34, and exceeding 92% for higher scores. Severe motor impairment primarily 
increased the risk of early mortality. Despite there being 72 persons aged from 
25 to 41 years with severe motor impairment in our data set, none had died after 
the age of 25 years. Infants born after more than 32 weeks' gestation were at 
significantly higher risk of mortality than very preterm infants, accounted for 
by their higher rates of intellectual disability. No improvements in survival of 
persons with CP were seen over the study period despite advances in medical 
care, improved community awareness, and the increasing proportion of very 
preterm births among people with CP. This may be the result of improved neonatal 
care enabling the survival of infants with increasingly severe disabilities.

CONTEXT: A high homocysteine level has been identified as an independent 
modifiable risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) events and death. Since 
January 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration has required that all enriched 
grain products contain 140 microg of folic acid per 100 g, a level considered to 
decrease homocysteine levels.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the potential effect of grain fortification with folic 
acid on CHD events and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of additional vitamin 
supplementation (folic acid and cyanocobalamin) for CHD prevention.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Cost-effectiveness analysis using the Coronary Heart Disease 
Policy Model, a validated, state-transition model of CHD events in adults aged 
35 through 84 years. Data from the third National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES III) were used to estimate age- and sex-specific 
differences in homocysteine levels.
INTERVENTION: Hypothetical comparison between a diet that includes enriched 
grain products projected to increase folic acid intake by 100 microg/d with the 
same diet without folic acid fortification; and a comparison between vitamin 
therapy that consists of 1 mg of folic acid and 0.5 mg of cyanocobalamin and the 
diet that includes grains fortified with folic acid.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of myocardial infarction and death from CHD, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved, and medical costs.
RESULTS: Grain fortification with folic acid was predicted to decrease CHD 
events by 8% in women and 13% in men, with comparable reductions in CHD 
mortality. The model projected that, compared with grain fortification alone, 
treating all patients with known CHD with folic acid and cyanocobalamin over a 
10-year period would result in 310 000 fewer deaths and lower costs. Over the 
same 10-year period, providing vitamin supplementation in addition to grain 
fortification to all men aged 45 years or older without known CHD was projected 
to save more than 300 000 QALYs, to save more than US $2 billion, and to be the 
preferred strategy. For women without CHD, the preferred vitamin supplementation 
strategy would be to treat all women older than 55 years, a strategy projected 
to save more than 140 000 QALYs over 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Folic acid and cyanocobalamin supplementation may be cost-effective 
among many population subgroups and could have a major epidemiologic benefit for 
primary and secondary prevention of CHD if ongoing clinical trials confirm that 
homocysteine-lowering therapy decreases CHD event rates.

OBJECTIVE: Many patients with advanced lung cancer invading the airway require 
only palliation; however, induction chemotherapy and surgery may sometimes be 
considered. Preliminary endoscopic palliation may improve quality of life and 
functional status, allows better evaluation of tumor extension and contributes 
to prevent infectious complications. We reviewed our experience with preliminary 
laser treatment, induction chemotherapy and surgical resection in patients with 
lung cancer invading the airway.
METHODS: Twenty-one patients with stage IIIA and IIIB lung cancer presenting 
with an 80% unilateral airway obstruction were treated with laser resection, 
induction chemotherapy and surgery. Spirometry, arterial blood gas analysis, 
quality of life (QLQ-C30 score) and performance status were recorded before and 
after laser treatment and after chemotherapy. Complications during chemotherapy, 
surgical morbidity and mortality, and survival were also recorded.
RESULTS: No complications were observed after endoscopic treatment. FEV(1) 
significantly improved from 1.4+/-0.4 l/s to 2.2+/-0.7 l/s, as well as FVC (from 
2+/-0.5 to 3.1+/-0.8 l), and remained stable after chemotherapy. The QLQ-C30 
score significantly improved after laser treatment (from 45+/-4.8 to 31+/-2.5) 
as well as the Karnofsky status (from 76+/-5 to 90). One patient developed 
pneumonia during induction chemotherapy. Three patients were not operated on. We 
performed five pneumonectomies (one right tracheal sleeve pneumonectomy) and 13 
lobectomies (five associated to a bronchial sleeve resection). One patient 
(5.5%) died after the operation. Four patients experienced minor postoperative 
complications. Three-year survival after the operation was 52%.
CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary endoscopic palliation of lung cancer invading the 
airway is feasible, improves evaluation and staging, helps to reduce the 
incidence of complications during induction chemotherapy without increasing 
surgical morbidity and mortality.

Plasmid vaccination with insulin B chain prevents autoimmune diabetes in 
nonobese diabetic mice.

The insulin B (InsB) chain bears major type 1 diabetes-associated epitopes of 
significance for disease in humans and nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Somatic 
expression of InsB chain initiated early in life by plasmid inoculation resulted 
in substantial protection of female NOD mice against disease. This was 
associated with a T2 shift in spleen, expansion of IL-4-producing and, to a 
lesser extent, of IFN-gamma-secreting T cells in pancreatic lymph nodes, as well 
as intermolecular Th2 epitope spreading to glutamic acid decarboxylase 
determinants. A critical role of IL-4 for the Ag-specific protective effect 
triggered by plasmid administration was revealed in female IL-4(-/-) NOD mice 
that developed diabetes and higher Th1 responses. Coadministration of 
IL-4-expressing plasmid or extension of the vaccination schedule corrected the 
unfavorable response of male NOD mice to DNA vaccination with InsB chain. Thus, 
plasmid-mediated expression of the InsB chain early in diabetes-prone mice has 
the potential to prevent transition to full-blown disease depending on the 
presence of IL-4.

[Impact of tobacco, alcohol overconsumption and drug abuse on mortality in 
Denmark. Trends over 25 years, 1973-1997].

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to estimate the national impact of 
smoking, alcohol, and drugs on mortality.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analysis was based on the cause of death register. 
Deaths attributable to smoking were calculated by an indirect method. Deaths 
related to alcohol and drugs (illegal drugs and prescription drugs) were defined 
by the underlying and contributory causes of death.
RESULTS: In the period, 1993-1997, 30% of all deaths in men and 20% in women 
were related to tobacco, alcohol, or drugs. The percentages of all deaths for 
tobacco, alcohol, and drugs were respectively 22.8%, 6.3%, and 1.2% for men and 
16.5%, 2.5%, and 0.7% for women. Every year 12,000 Danes die 11-13 years 
prematurely, because of tobacco, more than 2500 die more than 20 years 
prematurely, because of alcohol, and about 600 die almost 30 years prematurely, 
because of drugs. The standardised lifetime risk of death from one of these 
three causes was about 30% for men, highest in the middle five-year period. For 
women--because of substantially increased mortality attributable to 
smoking--there was a large increase from 8% to 20%. In the municipality of 
Copenhagen, the lifetime risk for men was about 50%, for women it increased from 
15% in the middle of the 1970s to more than 30% in the middle of the 1990s. For 
both men and women, mortality in the age group 35-74 declined sharply, when 
mortality related to the three causes was excluded. However, the heavy increase 
in smoking-related deaths in women means that the total mortality over the 
entire period has been almost constant.
DISCUSSION: It is a tremendous challenge to change the impact of tobacco, 
alcohol, and drugs on mortality in Denmark.

In France, city size has very little bearing on the mortality rate as a function 
of age and life expectancy and it is in large cities that these indicators are 
the most favorable. No increase in maternal or infant mortality rates or deaths 
due to cancers has been observed in large cities. The lower mortality rate 
linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in large urban areas 
contradicts the fears concerning the impact of air pollution. Deaths linked to 
lifestyle are less frequent in big cities, which could be due to social 
structures (socio-professional level: the proportion of white-collar workers and 
professionals is higher in bigger cities than in the suburbs or small cities). 
However, although the overall mortality rate is lower, it should be emphasized 
that there is in large cities a greater incidence of sexually transmitted 
diseases, AIDS and certain infectious diseases (because of social diversity and 
the fact that certain individuals seeking anonymity and marginality are drawn to 
large cities). In terms of mental health, the breakdown of family structures, 
instability, unemployment, the lack of parental authority and failing schools 
render adolescents vulnerable and hinder their social integration. When the 
proportion of adolescents at risk is high in a neighborhood, individual problems 
are amplified and social problems result. In order to restore mental and social 
health to these neighborhoods, ambitious strategies are necessary which take 
into account family and social factors as well as environmental ones. At the 
present time, when physical health is constantly improving, the most pressing 
problems are those related to lifestyle and mental health which depend for a 
large part on social factors.

Limb-salvage operations such as vascularised or non-vascularised osseous grafts 
and allograft and callus distraction methods have replaced amputations because 
of the increase in the life expectancy of patients with malignant tumours. In 
this study we aimed to evaluate the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on 
distraction osteogenesis. For this purpose, 23 rabbits randomly divided into two 
groups were included in the study. The experimental group and the control group 
consisted of 12 rabbits and 11 rabbits, respectively. The experimental group 
were administered chemotherapeutic agents with the protocol identified in the 
osteogenic sarcoma regimen. All the subjects were corticotomised in the 
metaphyseal-diaphyseal region, and both groups underwent distraction with a 
circular ring fixator. X-ray films, bone scintigraphy and histopathological 
examination were performed three times during the study. No difference between 
the two groups was observed in radiological, scintigraphical and 
histopathological studies carried out before the distraction period and 
following the end of the distraction period. In this study, it was shown that 
the use of antineoplastic drugs has no significant negative effect on 
distraction osteogenesis applied for reconstruction in rabbits. We think that it 
can be an alternative treatment method in humans as well.

OBJECTIVES: Previous evaluation demonstrated that the Mpowerment Project 
community-level intervention for young gay men reduces HIV risk behaviors. The 
current analysis was undertaken to estimate the intervention's health and 
economic outcomes.
DESIGN/METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis. We 
estimated HIV infections averted, the gain in quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), cost per infection averted, and net cost. Using a population-level 
model, we portrayed two epidemic scenarios: the first with stable HIV prevalence 
and the other with rising HIV prevalence. Inputs included behavior change 
resulting from the intervention and program cost data. Cost was calculated from 
three perspectives: societal; societal excluding volunteer time; and that of a 
community-based organization (CBO). Outcomes were calculated for 1, 5 
(baseline), and 20 years.
RESULTS: The Mpowerment Project averted an estimated 2.0 to 2.3 HIV infections 
in the first year (according to the epidemic scenario), 5.0 to 6.2 over 5 years, 
and 9.2 to 13.1 over 20 years. The societal cost per HIV infection averted was 
estimated at between $14,600 and $18,300 over 5 years. Costs per infection 
averted were 28% lower when excluding volunteer time and 35% lower from the CBO 
perspective. Net savings were $700,000 to $900,000 over 5 years from the 
societal perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: The Mpowerment Project is cost-effective compared with many other 
HIV prevention strategies. The cost per HIV infection prevented is far less than 
the lifetime medical costs of HIV disease.

Gene targeting in mosquito cells: a demonstration of 'knockout' technology in 
extrachromosomal gene arrays.

Staffordshire, ST5 5BG, UK. p.eggleston@keele.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: Gene targeting would offer a number of advantages over current 
transposon-based strategies for insect transformation. These include freedom 
from both position effects associated with quasi-random integration and concerns 
over transgene instability mediated by endogenous transposases, independence 
from phylogenetic restrictions on transposon mobility and the ability to 
generate gene knockouts.
RESULTS: We describe here our initial investigations of gene targeting in the 
mosquito. The target site was a hygromycin resistance gene, stably maintained as 
part of an extrachromosomal array. Using a promoter-trap strategy to enrich for 
targeted events, a neomycin resistance gene was integrated into the target site. 
This resulted in knockout of hygromycin resistance concurrent with the 
expression of high levels of neomycin resistance from the resident promoter. PCR 
amplification of the targeted site generated a product that was specific to the 
targeted cell line and consistent with precise integration of the neomycin 
resistance gene into the 5' end of the hygromycin resistance gene. Sequencing of 
the PCR product and Southern analysis of cellular DNA subsequently confirmed 
this molecular structure.
CONCLUSIONS: These experiments provide the first demonstration of gene targeting 
in mosquito tissue and show that mosquito cells possess the necessary machinery 
to bring about precise integration of exogenous sequences through homologous 
recombination. Further development of these procedures and their extension to 
chromosomally located targets hold much promise for the exploitation of gene 
targeting in a wide range of medically and economically important insect 
species.

The aim of this observational study was to estimate the survival function and 
risk of death in Botucatu, Southeast Brazil, by occupation. The occupational 
history of inhabitants of Botucatu who died after their 10th birthday from 
January 1, 1997, to March 31, 1998, was analyzed, as were the occupational 
histories of workers' spouses. A total of 992 subjects were studied. Data were 
analyzed by fitting a proportional hazards model where the time variable was age 
at death or at time of interview and the main co-variable was occupation. 
Results showed that risk of death increased consistently as the level of 
occupational specialization decreased, displaying a 12-year increase in life 
expectancy for professional as compared to unskilled workers.

[Socioeconomic situation and population's health in the Republic of North 
Ossetia-Alania in the nineties].

[Article in Russian]

Shchepin VO, Demurov TM.

The economic situation for the population of North Ossetia-Alania has 
drastically deteriorated in the 90s, which primarily affected the population 
well-being. Birth rates decreased and mortality increased, because of increased 
number of suicides and murders and decrease of mean expected life-span. Results 
of analysis indicate common regularities and trends and differences between the 
medical demographic processes in North Ossetia-Alania and the entire Russian 
Federation; these common and individual features should be taken into 
consideration when organizing and planning the activity of public health system 
and institutions.

[Laboratory diagnosis of osteoporosis].

Bone is biologically a highly active tissue whose cells are embedded in a 
complex network of systemically acting hormones and local mediators. The 
mechanisms of action involved are as yet only partially understood. With the 
increase in life expectancy and the resultant change of the population's age 
structure, diseases of the musculoskeletal system and bones have increased in 
importance. Thus, research is directed to a greater extent toward bone 
metabolism and the most frequent bone disease, osteoporosis. Until a few decades 
ago, the diagnosis of a bone disease was based principally on clinical and 
radiological methods. Laboratory methods only included the measurement of total 
alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium and phosphate balance. The development 
and introduction of new biochemical markers of bone metabolism in recent years 
led to a considerable increase in available laboratory methods. To evaluate the 
activity of osteoblastic synthesis, alkaline phosphatase and other bone-forming 
markers with higher tissue specificity such as bone alkaline phosphatase, 
osteocalcin, and several collagen propeptides are used. Bone degradation 
(calcium and hydroxyproline were the only markers until several years ago) can 
now be detected quickly and reliably with many new serological and urinary 
markers. Pyridinium derivatives and telopeptides as products of the metabolic 
activity of osteoclasts have been proved efficacious in diagnosis and therapy 
control.

[Physical exercise in the rehabilitation of the coronary patient].

[Article in Portuguese]

Mota E(1).

Author information:

Coronary patients comprise an heterogeneous population. Many patients, after 
adequate screening, can benefit from physical training, which determines 
hemodynamic changes that are globally useful to the coronary patient. Under 
adequate supervision, physical exercise may help to condition the 
cardiocirculatory system in a favorable way. After successful training, efforts 
require a lower double product. By dumping sharp variations in heart rate and 
blood pressure, an increased margin of safety is obtained, and the coronary 
patient will be able to perform physical activity at a level closer to normal. 
Even without definitive evidence that life expectancy is increased and without 
direct effects on the heart and the coronary arteries, physical exercise 
promotes a better quality of life and decreases the negative impact of the 
coronary heart disease.

experience of a Specialized cancer Registry.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is still unclear whether recent advancements in 
colorectal cancer research have led to an improvement in management and 
prognosis of the disease. Through the data of a specialized colorectal cancer 
Registry we aimed at analysing pathological staging and 5-year survival of all 
patients with malignancies of large bowel diagnosed between 1984 and 1997. Main 
objective was to ascertain whether or not we are making progress in the control 
of this common neoplasm.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the 14-year period 1984-97, a total of 2,240 
colorectal cancer patients were registered, for a crude incidence rate of 64.5 
and 55.2/100,000/year in males and females, respectively Tumours were staged 
with "Tumour, Node, Metastasis" system, corresponding to Dukes' classification, 
into four main groups. Survival was assessed with Life Table analysis, and 
statistical significance--between various subgroups--evaluated with Log-Rank 
Test.
RESULTS: Crude incidence rates of colorectal neoplasms showed minor fluctuations 
during initial period of registration, increasing sharply after 1990 mainly due 
to localized (stage I and II) lesions and, to a lesser degree, to stage III 
tumours. Number of advanced (stage IV and unstaged) malignancies remained 
virtually stable. When results were expressed as percent of total cases, the 
fraction of localized lesions increased from 39% in the biennium 1984-5 to 51.6% 
in 1986-97, and the proportion of advanced tumours fell from 39% to 21.6% (p for 
trend <0.001). As expected, 5-year survival was significantly (p<0.002) more 
favourable for individuals diagnosed in 1990-91 than for patients registered in 
1984-89.
CONCLUSIONS: In Northern Italy, incidence rates of colorectal carcinoma are 
rising. This trend is associated with a sharp increase of newly detected 
localized lesions and with a significant improvement of overall 5-year survival. 
The result may be attributed to several concomitant factors, such as: A] wider 
use of colonoscopy, B) increased education of patients, C) more attention given 
to symptoms.

Prevention of fungal spoilage is a key microbiological issue for the shelf life 
of fat spreads. Our aim was to assess and model the scope of (natural) 
antimicrobials for extending shelf life of spreads (water-in-oil emulsions). 
Production conditions were established to make 60% model fat spreads with 
reproducible droplet size distributions. The mould vulnerabilities ranged from 1 
to 20 weeks. The system allowed feasibility testing of lytic enzymes (Novozym 
234) and LMW compounds against Penicillium roqueforti, a key-spoilage mould. The 
action of Novozym 234, carvacrol, undecanol and dihydrocarveol was benchmarked 
against sorbate and preservative-free controls under ambient and chilled 
conditions. Novozym 234 was ineffective to prevent outgrowth of P. roqueforti. 
Carvacrol, undecanol and dihydrocarveol had limited effects on shelf-life 
extension compared to sorbate. Fungal growth boundaries of (un-)preserved 
spreads were modelled. The emulsion droplet size distribution (DSD) was first 
captured in a mechanistic parameter DSD-I (I = Influence). DSD-I was a move away 
from the mean droplet diameter D3,3 as sole quantitative droplet-size 
distribution parameter for mould susceptibility of emulsions. DSD-I is a 
combination of available water droplets and surface area to initiate and sustain 
fungal outgrowth. Followup experiments showed that modelling D3,3 and 
distribution width (e(sigma)) instead of DSD-I gave better results for emulsions 
with high e(sigma). Empirical predictive models were subsequently developed for 
the effects of D3,3, e(sigma) and undissociated sorbic acid (HSO) on the shelf 
life of emulsions.

University, UK. mtroke@brookes.ac.uk

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To generate gender-specific and broadly based age-related 
indices for normative lumbar ranges of motion for all planes of movement.
DESIGN: This was a repeated measures prospective study of spinal range of motion 
in a sample of volunteer subjects utilizing a portable modified CA6000 Spine 
Motion Analyzer (Orthopedic Systems Inc., Union City, CA, USA).
SETTING: Data collection was carried out in a variety of community locations 
including fire, police and ambulance stations, offices and community centres.
SUBJECTS: A total of 405 asymptomatic subjects (196 female, 209 male) were 
recruited, aged 16-90 years, from sedentary, mixed and physically demanding 
occupations.
METHODOLOGY: Indices of lumbar spine ranges of motion were measured in standing 
following a standardized protocol for sagittal flexion/extension, coronal 
lateral flexion and horizontal axial rotation movements.
RESULTS: Male and female normative flexion ranges declined by approximately 40% 
(72-40 degrees) across the age spectrum. Extension declined the greatest, by 
approximately 76% (29-6 degrees) overall. In lateral flexion male and female 
ranges declined approximately 43% (29-15 degrees) in each direction (total 58-30 
degrees). In axial rotation no age-related decline was observed and ranges of 
motion remained at approximately 7 degrees in each direction (total 14 degrees) 
across all the ages of the subject group.
CONCLUSIONS: Data have been generated that provide comprehensive, 
gender-specific, broadly based and age-related indices for normative lumbar 
ranges of motion in all planes of movement. These are applicable to individuals 
throughout adult life, from adolescence through to old age.

Seizure incidence varies significantly with age, with seizure susceptibility 
particularly high during the first few years of life. Of significant concern is 
what effects do brief, repetitive seizures have on the developing brain. We 
approached this issue by examining the change in seizure threshold, and related 
markers of neuronal activity and metabolic activity (c-fos mRNA and 
2-deoxyglucose [2DG]), as a function of repetitive seizure episodes in immature 
and mature rats. Starting on postnatal day 15 (P15) (immature) or P60 (adult) 
rats were given two flurothyl seizures a day for 5 days (nine or ten seizures). 
The seizure latency profile, our measure of threshold, in immature versus adult 
rats across the 5-day testing period was different. In immature rats, threshold 
for the second seizure on each day was significantly lower than for the first 
seizure, suggesting that there was little refractoriness after the first seizure 
of the day. In contrast, the mature animal had a significantly longer threshold 
latency to the second seizure for the first 3 days of testing. The immature 
animal was also more likely than the adult to exhibit tonic extension as a 
feature of the first seizure of the day. Following repetitive seizures, more
