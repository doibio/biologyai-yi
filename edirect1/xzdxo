survived. The survival rate is as high as 87.5%. One of them died of RDD in the 
fifth year. One case was lost to follow-up 2 years after treatment. Patients 
survive for at least 2 years and up to 9 years. There was no significant 
difference in life expectancy of extranodal RDD among different parts of ENT 
(P = 0.508 > 0.05). The average ages of laryngeal and nasal RDD were similar 
(P = 0.898 > 0.05). However, the age of both was significantly higher than ear 
RDD (P = 0.023 and 0.019 < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The average diagnostic age was more than 20 years. Nasal RDD was 
the most common in this area. All laryngeal RDD had infiltrated subglottis. 
Functional surgery and postoperative radiotherapy can be used to achieve 
long-term remission and survival.

CKD: The burden of disease invisible to research funders.

AIRG-E; EKPF; ALCER; FRIAT; REDINREN; RICORS2040; SENEFRO; SET; ONT. Electronic 
address: aortiz@fjd.es.

The uptake of the current concept of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by the public, 
physicians and health authorities is low. Physicians still mix up CKD with 
chronic kidney insufficiency or failure. In a recent manuscript, only 23% of 
participants in a cohort of persons with CKD had been diagnosed by their 
physicians as having CKD while 29% has a diagnosis of cancer and 82% had a 
diagnosis of hypertension. For the wider public and health authorities, CKD 
evokes kidney replacement therapy (KRT). In Spain, the prevalence of KRT is 
0.13%. A prevalent view is that for those in whom kidneys fail, the problem is 
"solved" by dialysis or kidney transplantation. However, the main burden of CKD 
is accelerated aging and all-cause and cardiovascular premature death. CKD is 
the most prevalent risk factor for lethal COVID-19 and the factor that most 
increases the risk of death in COVID-19, after old age. Moreover, men and women 
undergoing KRT still have an annual mortality which is 10-100-fold higher than 
similar age peers, and life expectancy is shortened by around 40 years for young 
persons on dialysis and by 15 years for young persons with a functioning kidney 
graft. CKD is expected to become the fifth global cause of death by 2040 and the 
second cause of death in Spain before the end of the century, a time when 1 in 4 
Spaniards will have CKD. However, by 2022, CKD will become the only top-15 
global predicted cause of death that is not supported by a dedicated well-funded 
CIBER network research structure in Spain. Leading Spanish kidney researchers 
grouped in the kidney collaborative research network REDINREN have now applied 
for the RICORS call of collaborative research in Spain with the support of the 
Spanish Society of Nephrology, ALCER and ONT: RICORS2040 aims to prevent the 
dire predictions for the global 2040 burden of CKD from becoming true. However, 
only the highest level of research funding through the CIBER will allow to 
adequately address the issue before it is too late.

El impacto del concepto actual de enfermedad renal crónica (ERC) en la 
población, médicos y autoridades sanitarias ha sido bajo. Los médicos aún 
confunden la ERC con la insuficiencia renal crónica. En un manuscrito reciente, 
en una cohorte de personas con ERC, solo el 23% de los participantes fueron 
diagnosticados de ERC por sus médicos mientras que el 29% estaban diagnosticados 
de cáncer y el 82% de hipertensión. Para el público en general y las autoridades 
sanitarias, la ERC evoca la terapia de reemplazo renal (TRR). En España, la 
prevalencia de TRR es del 0,13%. La opinión predominante es que para aquellos en 
los que fallan los riñones, el problema se “resuelve” mediante diálisis o 
trasplante de riñón. Sin embargo, la principal carga sanitaria de la ERC es el 
envejecimiento acelerado y la muerte prematura de causa cardiovascular o de 
cualquier causa. La ERC es el factor mas prevalente de riesgo de mortalidad por 
COVID-19 después de la edad avanzada. Además, los hombres y mujeres que se 
someten a TRR todavía tienen una mortalidad anual que es de 10 a 100 veces 
superior a sus pares de edades similares, y la esperanza de vida se reduce en 
alrededor de 40 años para jóvenes en diálisis y en 15 años para jóvenes con un 
injerto renal funcionante. Se espera que la ERC se convierta en la quinta causa 
mundial de muerte para 2040 y la segunda causa de muerte en España antes de fin 
de siglo, época en la que 1 de cada 4 españoles tendrá ERC. Sin embargo, para 
2022, la ERC se convertirá en la única causa de muerte entre las 15 principales 
a nivel mundial que no cuenta con el respaldo de una estructura de investigación 
CIBER en España. Los Principales grupos de investigación renal en España 
agrupados en la red de investigación colaborativa renal REDINREN han solicitado 
la convocatoria RICORS de investigación colaborativa en España con el apoyo de 
la Sociedad Española de Nefrología, ALCER y ONT: RICORS 040 tiene como objetivo 
evitar que se hagan realidad las terribles predicciones sobre la carga mundial 
de ERC para 2040. Sin embargo, solo el más alto nivel de financiación de la 
investigación a través del CIBER permitirá abordar adecuadamente el problema 
antes de que sea demasiado tarde.

Increased life expectancy has led to a rise in age-related disorders including 
neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. 
Limited progress has been made in the development of clinically translatable 
therapies for these central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Challenges including 
the blood-brain barrier, brain complexity, and comorbidities in the elderly 
population are some of the contributing factors toward lower success rates. 
Various invasive and noninvasive ways are being employed to deliver small and 
large molecules across the brain. Biodegradable, implantable drug-delivery 
systems have gained lot of interest due to advantages such as sustained and 
targeted delivery, lower side effects, and higher patient compliance. 3D 
printing is a novel additive manufacturing technique where various materials and 
printing techniques can be used to fabricate implants with the desired 
complexity in terms of mechanical properties, shapes, or release profiles. This 
review discusses an overview of various types of 3D-printing techniques and 
illustrative examples of the existing literature on 3D-printed systems for CNS 
drug delivery. Currently, there are various technical and regulatory impediments 
that need to be addressed for successful translation from the bench to the 
clinical stage. Overall, 3D printing is a transformative technology with great 
potential in advancing customizable drug treatment in a high-throughput manner.

[Emergency Surgical Management of Mediastinal Tumors].

[Article in Japanese]

Mediastinal tumors rarely lead to acute symptomatic manifestations due to 
spontaneous rupture and perforation, intra-tumoral hemorrhage, and bacterial 
contamination. Moreover, giant mediastinal tumors can compress and infiltrate 
surrounding mediastinal structures, such as the trachea, bronchus, cardiac sac, 
and superior vena cava, at the first visit. In addition, mediastinal mature 
teratomas include various ectopic tissues such as digestive glands and sebaceous 
glands that can cause specific pathological conditions. To address and properly 
manage patients with these rare conditions, prior learning must be emphasized to 
facilitate in clinical decision-making. In this article, we classified four 
pathological conditions of emergency due to mediastinal tumors. These include 
the clinical conditions resulting from the compression of anatomical structures 
by the tumor, those resulting from infiltration and extension into the 
surrounding mediastinal structures by the tumor, the specific conditions 
attributable to mature teratomas, and the occurrence of hemothorax due to 
spontaneous rupturing of the tumor. Based on the review of our cases and other 
recently reported cases, we summarize and discuss practical pitfalls and pearls 
in the emergency surgical management of these rare but life-threatening clinical 
situations.

Training in Palliative Care (PC) at the undergraduate level has proven to be an 
effective strategy to expand access to this type of services. In Chile, the 
increase in magnitude of serious health-related suffering and the recently 
approved Law that guarantees universal access to Palliative Care, requires the 
extension of PC undergraduate training in medical and nursing schools. 
Therefore, this study assessed and described the characteristics of current PC 
training in the Schools of Medicine and Nursing of Chile through an online 
survey of their directors. Nursing schools report higher frequency of mandatory 
training hours and access to clinical training, while Medicine schools report 
higher frequency of elective internships. However, gaps persist in the number of 
teaching hours and the teaching methods used, which may be due to the scarcity 
of qualified professionals in PC, limited access to clinical fields and 
disciplinary differences. Strengthening and expanding PC training at the 
undergraduate level with practical and interdisciplinary methodologies are 
fundamental steps so that future medical and nursing professionals can provide 
adequate care and relief of serious health-related suffering to an aging 
population until the end of their life.

BACKGROUND: Accessing quality palliative care, especially at the end of life is 
vital in reducing physical and emotional distress and optimising quality of 
life. For people living in rural and remote Australia, telehealth services can 
be effective in providing access to after-hours palliative care.
OBJECTIVE: To review and map the available evidence on the use of telehealth in 
providing after-hours palliative care services in rural and remote Australia.
METHOD: Scoping review using Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework. 
Findings are reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). 
Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Complete, Embase via Ovid, Emcare via Ovid, and 
Medline via Ovid databases were searched. Peer-reviewed studies and grey 
literature published in English from 2000 to May 2021 were included.
RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in the review. Four main themes were 
identified: 1) Stakeholder perceptions of service; 2) benefits to services and 
users; 3) service challenges; and 4) recommendations for service improvement.
CONCLUSION: Telehealth can connect patients and families with healthcare 
professionals and enable patients to continue receiving care at home. However, 
challenges relating to patients, service, staff skills, and experience need to 
be overcome to ensure the success and sustainability of this service. Improved 
communication and care coordination, better access to patient records, and 
ongoing healthcare professional education are required.
IMPLICATIONS: Protocols, comprehensive policy documents and standardized 
operating procedures to guide healthcare professionals to provide after-hours 
palliative care is needed. Ongoing education and training for staff is crucial 
in managing patients' symptoms. Existing service gaps need to be explored and 
alternative models of after-hours palliative care need to be tested.

BACKGROUND: Capecitabine maintenance therapy is safe and efficacious for 
early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, but the 
cost-effectiveness of its long-term use has not been investigated. Here, we 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of capecitabine maintenance therapy, compared 
with routine follow-up, in early-stage TNBC patients after standard treatment 
from a perspective of Chinese society.
METHODS: A three-state Markov model based on the data from the SYSUCC-001 trial 
was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of capecitabine maintenance 
therapy in a month cycle over a period of 30-year time horizon. A 5% annual 
discount rate was set for all costs and benefits. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the model uncertainties. The main 
outcomes include quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 
one additional event.
RESULTS: Compared with routine follow-up, 1-year capecitabine maintenance 
therapy yielded an additional 1.29 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at an 
additional cost of $3391.70, with an ICER of $2630.53 (95% CI: 
$1159.81-$5090.12) per QALY gained. The ICER was considerably lower than the 
recommended willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold (i.e., $28,130.00 per QALY). The 
results were sensitive to the discount rate, drug cost, and treatment cost after 
relapse. Further, the NNT to prevent one additional relapse case was 29.2 (95% 
CI: 13.2-196.6), 16.7 (95% CI: 8.4-111.6), and 12.0 (95% CI: 5.7-82.6) at 1, 2, 
and 5 years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: One-year capecitabine maintenance therapy for early-stage TNBC 
after standard treatment, compared with routine follow-up, was found to be 
highly cost-effective with promising clinical benefits and acceptable increased 
costs. Real-world studies are warranted to validate our findings in the future.

BACKGROUND: Spina bifida (SB) is a condition resulting from the improper closure 
of the neural tube and vertebral column during fetal development. While 
patients' life expectancy and quality of life have improved dramatically due to 
medical advances, children continue to experience health-related issues that 
often require hospitalizations.
OBJECTIVE: The association among sociodemographic and clinical characteristics 
with potentially preventable hospitalizations (PPH) in children and youth with 
myelomeningocele type SB was investigated in this cross-sectional study.
METHODS: Chart reviews and data extraction were conducted on 108 children and 
youth, ages 1 month to 21 years, admitted for PPH in a regional children's 
academic medical center between May 2017 and July 2019. Sociodemographic 
variables included sex, age, type of insurance and ethnicity. Clinical variables 
included level of lesion, ambulation status, shunt dependency and selected 
diagnostic categories. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were 
conducted to identify factors associated with PPH.
RESULTS: Factors associated with PPH included being male, ages 5-18 years, low 
lumbar level lesions, non-ambulatory, with public insurance, Hispanic and shunt 
dependent. Most hospitalizations (73%) were for neurologic or urologic 
conditions. Factors independently associated with PPH were ethnicity for 
urologic conditions, being ambulatory for metabolic conditions, and age for 
gastroenterology conditions.
CONCLUSION: Selected demographic and clinical variables were found to be 
associated with PPH of children and youth with myelomeningocele-type SB. The 
most common reasons for PPH were shunt malfunctions and urinary tract 
infections, consistent with other studies.

A prospective randomised control trial (RCT) was conducted in National Institute 
of Rehabilitation Medicine (NIRM), Islamabad, on 40 children with hemiplegic 
cerebral palsy (HCP). Children between the ages of four and12 years with 
ipsilateral, bilateral or severely asymmetrical impairments who had wrist 
extension (20°) and fingers flexion (10°) were included. The outcomes tools, Box 
and Block Test, Quality of Upper Extremity Skill Test, CP (Quality of Life) and 
Kid screen were used at baseline, mid- and post- treatment assessment. Both the 
treatment approaches (CCIMT AND MCIMT) equally improved upper limb motor 
functions and psychosocial life of the children with HCP. On Quest tool, results 
of dissociated movement were significant (p=0.021) and on CPQOL tool two domains 
(participation & physical health and family health) showed significant 
difference (p=0.042, p=0.025). But no significant difference was noted regarding 
other domains of the tools. The study concluded that both the treatment 
approaches (CCIMT AND MCIMT) are effective in enhancing the upper limb motor 
functions and psychosocial life of children with HCP.

China is striving to build a "Beautiful China" characterized by clean air. The 
country has committed to further reducing its national mean fine particle 
(PM2.5) concentration by 10% from 2020 to 2025, following the substantial 
improvements in its air quality during the past decade. Meanwhile, the "Healthy 
China" mission has pledged to increase the national mean life expectancy by one 
year during the same period. Yet, to what extent will the "Beautiful China" 
mission contribute to the "Healthy China" vision by reducing the levels of the 
detrimental PM2.5 is still unclear. Here, by coupling the life table approach 
and an epidemiological concentration-response model, this study quantifies the 
potential benefits of achieving China's 2025 air quality target on the national 
life expectancy. The analysis reveals that the Chinese citizen could expect to 
extend the average life expectancy by 42.5 days by 2025 due to improved air 
quality. In addition, if the Chinese government outperforms the planned air 
quality target, as it usually does, the gains would increase to 65.4 days, ∼18% 
of the "Healthy China" life expectancy increment task. Further reductions in 
PM2.5 concentration would lead to accelerated gains in life expectancy both 
nationally and at the city level, providing strong incentives for the 
authorities to keep improving air quality. This study reveals the notable 
benefits on individual life that could be expected from air quality improvement 
in China and suggests that longer life expectancy is achievable by implementing 
a health-prioritized air quality management mechanism.

The Influence of Trunk Impairment Level on the Kinematic Characteristics of 
Alpine Sit-Skiing: A Case Study of Paralympic Medalists.

Performance Sport Center, Kita-ku, Tokyo, Japan.

This study aimed to examine the relationship between the trunk impairment level 
and the trunk kinematic characteristics during alpine sit-skiing from a 
classification perspective. Three Paralympic medalists in sitting classes 
(LW10-2, LW11, and LW12-2) participated in the present study. To simulate the 
racing conditions, giant slalom gates were set. To measure the kinematics of the 
skier and sit-ski during skiing, a motion capture method with inertial 
measurement units was used. The muscle activities of the trunk muscles were 
evaluated using electromyography. Chest lateral flexion, chest flexion, and hip 
flexion/extension angle during sit-skiing were reduced due to impairment. 
Additionally, the insufficient lateral flexion (angulation) caused a decrease in 
edging angle, and that the insufficient chest and hip flexion/extension caused a 
lower loading in the latter half of the turn through smaller vertical movement. 
Since edging angle and loading are key factors in ski control, the three joint 
motions could be measures of sport-specific activity limitation in sit-skiing 
classification. Between the LW10-2 and LW11 skiers, no distinct differences in 
trunk kinematics were found. Assuming the scaling factor of race time as a 
measure of skiing performance, one possible reason is that the difference in 
skiing performance the LW10-2 and LW11 skiers is considerably smaller relative 
to differences between the LW11 and LW12-2 skiers. There were no distinct 
differences among classes in the results of muscle activity, and therefore, this 
information appears to play a minimal role for classification.

Early detection of pancreatic cancer has long eluded clinicians because of its 
insidious nature and onset. Often metastatic or locally invasive when 
symptomatic, most patients are deemed inoperable. In those who are symptomatic, 
multi-modal imaging modalities evaluate and confirm pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma. In asymptomatic patients, detected pancreatic lesions can be 
either solid or cystic. The clinical implications of identifying small 
asymptomatic solid pancreatic lesions (SPLs) of < 2 cm are tantamount to a 
better outcome. The accurate detection of SPLs undoubtedly promotes higher life 
expectancy when resected early, driving the development of existing imaging 
tools while promoting more comprehensive screening programs. An imaging tool 
that has matured in its reiterations and received many image-enhancing adjuncts 
is endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). It carries significant importance when risk 
stratifying cystic lesions and has substantial diagnostic value when combined 
with fine needle aspiration/biopsy (FNA/FNB). Adjuncts to EUS imaging include 
contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS and EUS-elastography, both having improved the 
specificity of FNA and FNB. This review intends to compile all existing 
enhancement modalities and explore ongoing research around the most promising of 
all adjuncts in the field of EUS imaging, artificial intelligence.

Globally, it is estimated that 43 million people are living with human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and there are more than 600,000 acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related deaths in 2020. The only way to 
increase the life expectancy of these patients right now is to use combination 
antiretroviral therapy (cART) for the lifetime. Due to the integration of the 
HIV-1 DNA in lymphocytes, the replication of the virus can only be reduced by 
using antiretroviral drugs. If the drug is stopped, the virus will replicate and 
reduce the number of lymphocytes. In recent years, the clustered regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease 
Cas9-mediated genome editing system has been considered, preventing HIV-1 
replication by causing DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) or disrupting the 
integrated virus replication by targeting the provirus. In this study, we 
utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 without the nuclear localization signal sequence (w/o 
NLS) system to inhibit the VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 replication by targeting the 
HIV-1 DNA as a prophylactic method. To this end, we designed a multiplex gRNA 
(guide RNA) cassette to target the pol, env, and nef/long terminal repeat 
(nef/LTR) regions of the HIV-1 genome and then cloned it in plasmid expressing 
no-NLS-Cas9 protein as an all-in-one CRISPR/Cas9 vector. Using HIV-1 pseudovirus 
transduction into HEK-293T cell lines, our results showed that the 
CRISPR/Cas9-no NLS system disrupts the pseudotyped HIV-1 DNA and significantly 
(P-value < 0.0001) decreases the p24 antigen shedding and viral RNA load in cell 
culture supernatants harvested 48h after virus transduction. Although these 
results revealed the potential of the CRISPR/Cas9-no NLS nuclease system as a 
prophylactic strategy against HIV-1 infections, due to inefficient impairments 
of HIV-1 DNA, further studies are required to enhance its effectiveness and 
application in clinical practice.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or 
function, present for ˃3 months, with implications for health. The most used 
diagnostic criteria are a urinary albumin: creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g or an 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Either of these 
diagnostic thresholds is associated with adverse health outcomes. GFR decreases 
with age and the prevalence of CKD is highest in older adults; moreover, the 
presence of CKD is associated with an increased risk of all-cause and 
cardiovascular death related to accelerated ageing in all age ranges, and the 
absolute increase in risk is highest for those aged ˃75 years. Indeed, premature 
death is a more common outcome than CKD progression to kidney failure requiring 
kidney replacement therapy. The progressive ageing of the world population 
contributes to the projection that CKD will become the second most common cause 
of death before the end of the century in countries with long life expectancy. 
The current collection of selected studies on kidney disease and ageing 
published in Age&Ageing, NDT and CKJ provides an overview of key topics, 
including cognitive decline, sarcopaenia, wasting and cardiovascular and 
non-cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the management of kidney failure and 
gender differences in CKD progression.

BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on long-term consequences of bloodstream 
infections (BSIs). We aimed to examine incidence, 1-year mortality, and years of 
potential life lost (YPLL) following BSI. We estimated the relative contribution 
of hospital-onset BSI (HO-BSI) and antibiotic-resistant BSI to incidence, 
mortality and YPLL.
METHODS: We used data from Israel's national BSI surveillance system (covering 
eight sentinel bacteria, comprising 70% of all BSIs) and the national death 
registry. Adults with BSI between January 2018 and December 2019 were included. 
The outcomes were all-cause 30-day and 1-year mortality, with no adjustment for 
co-morbidities. We calculated the age-standardized mortality rate and YPLL using 
the Global Burden of Disease reference population and life expectancy tables.
FINDINGS: In total, 25,376 BSIs occurred over 2 years (mean adult population: 
6,068,580). The annual incidence was 209·1 BSIs (95% CI 206·5-211·7) per 100,000 
population. The case fatality rate was 25·6% (95% CI 25·0-26·2) at 30 days and 
46·4% (95% CI 45·5-47·2) at 1 year. The hazard of death increased by 30% for 
each decade of age (HR=1·3 [95% CI 1·2-1·3]). The annual age-standardized 
mortality rate and YPLL per 100,000 were 50·8 (95% CI 49·7-51·9) and 1,012·6 
(95% CI 986·9-1,038·3), respectively. HO-BSI (6,962 events) represented 27·4% 
(95% CI 26·9-28·0) of BSIs, 33·9% (95% CI 32·6-35·0) of deaths and 39·9% (95% CI 
39·5-40·2) of YPLL. HO-BSI by drug-resistant bacteria (3,072 events) represented 
12·1% (95% CI 11·7-12·5) of BSIs, 15·6% (95% CI 14·7-16·5) of deaths, and 18·4% 
(95% CI 18·1-18·7) of YPLL.
INTERPRETATION: One-year mortality following BSI is high. The burden of BSI is 
similar to that of ischemic stroke. HO-BSI and drug-resistant BSI contribute 
disproportionately to BSI mortality and YPLL.
FUNDING: None.

During aging, physical integrity and cognitive abilities, especially executive 
function, become compromised, directly influencing the quality of life of the 
elderly. One good strategy to ensure healthy aging is the practice of physical 
exercise. Activities to improve aerobic capacity and muscle strength are 
extremely important in old age. However, some genetic factors can interfere both 
positively and negatively with these gains. In this context, the polymorphism 
rs1815739 (R577X) of the α-actinin 3 gene (ACTN-3) is commonly studied and 
related to muscle phenotype. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the 
effect of the ACTN-3 gene polymorphism on the functional fitness (measured by 
the Senior Fit test) and cognitive capacity (evaluated by the Stroop test) of 
the elderly (n = 347), both men and women. We did not find the effect of 
genotype on functional fitness, but we did observed a positive effect of the 
ACTN-3 gene polymorphism on executive function. The presence of the X allele of 
the ACTN3 gene in the elderly was related to a better performance in the Stroop 
test (shorter answer time). Our results showed that ACTN-3 gene polymorphism 
affects the executive function of the elderly but not their functional fitness.

INTRODUCTION: Insomnia is a common sleep disorder in elderly. Although the 
HIV-positive population have a similar life expectancy when compared to the 
general population, some factors may interact with immunity conditions and 
therefore contribute to a worse prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: This is a review of literature that aims to identify prevalence of 
insomnia in older HIV-positive patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a review of literature conducted by using 
MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, 
SciELO, LILACS, and VHL databases, in addition to conducting manual searches. 
The terms used for the search were related to prevalence, HIV, insomnia, and 
advanced age. Inclusion criteria were: cross-sectional, cohort, and longitudinal 
studies, patients with a previous diagnosis of HIV in old age, studies reporting 
the frequency of insomnia or insomnia symptoms. The criteria for exclusion were: 
clinical trials, animal studies, letters, abstracts, conference proceedings, 
studies with other sleep scales that did not include insomnia.
RESULTS: There were 2,805 publications found in the database and a further 10 
articles were included manually. Of this total, four were included in this 
review, resulting in a total of 2,227 participants. The prevalence of insomnia 
in HIV-positive patients over 50 years varied from 12.5% to 76.5%.
CONCLUSION: The frequency of insomnia was higher in the profile of the 
population studied than in the general population. This should be clinically 
relevant in order to adequately treat and impact on the prognosis of those 
patient.

Smoking and the widening inequality in life expectancy between metropolitan and 
nonmetropolitan areas of the United States.

University, Princeton, NJ, United States.

BACKGROUND: Geographic inequality in US mortality has increased rapidly over the 
last 25 years, particularly between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. 
These gaps are sizeable and rival life expectancy differences between the US and 
other high-income countries. This study determines the contribution of smoking, 
a key contributor to premature mortality in the US, to geographic inequality in 
mortality over the past quarter century.
METHODS: We used death certificate and census data covering the entire US 
population aged 50+ between Jan 1, 1990 and Dec 31, 2019. We categorized 
counties into 40 geographic areas cross-classified by region and metropolitan 
category. We estimated life expectancy at age 50 and the index of dissimilarity 
for mortality, a measure of inequality in mortality, with and without smoking 
for these areas in 1990-1992 and 2017-2019. We estimated the changes in life 
expectancy levels and percent change in inequality in mortality due to smoking 
between these periods.
RESULTS: We find that the gap in life expectany between metros and nonmetros 
increased by 2.17 years for men and 2.77 years for women. Changes in 
smoking-related deaths are responsible for 19% and 22% of those increases, 
respectively. Among the 40 geographic areas, increases in life expectancy driven 
by changes in smoking ranged from 0.91 to 2.34 years for men while, for women, 
smoking-related changes ranged from a 0.61-year decline to a 0.45-year 
improvement. The most favorable trends in years of life lost to smoking tended 
to be concentrated in large central metros in the South and Midwest, while the 
least favorable trends occurred in nonmetros in these same regions. Smoking 
contributed to increases in mortality inequality for men aged 70+, with the 
contribution ranging from 8 to 24%, and for women aged 50-84, ranging from 14 to 
44%.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality attributable to smoking is declining fastest in large 
cities and coastal areas and more slowly in nonmetropolitan areas of the US. 
Increasing geographic inequalities in mortality are partly due to these 
geographic divergences in smoking patterns over the past several decades. 
Policies addressing smoking in non-metropolitan areas may reduce geographic 
inequality in mortality and contribute to future gains in life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: To study the corresponding strategies to control inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD), a comprehensive assessment of the disease burden is required. 
Herein, we present long-term trends in the burden of IBD in China over the last 
three decades, as well as its epidemiological features.
METHODS: We characterized the burden of IBD in China using the GBD 2019 methods 
and results, based on prevalence, incidence, mortality, years lost (YLLs), years 
lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
estimated using the DisMod-MR 2-1. We also used joinpoint and age-period-cohort 
(apc) analysis methods to interpret IBD epidemiological characteristics and 
compare them to global prevalence trends.
RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence and mortality rates in both sexes 
changed from 1.47 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.74) to 3.01 (95% CI: 2.59, 3.50) and from 
0.86 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.16) to 0.30 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.35) per 100,000 people in 
China from 1990 to 2019. The age-standardized DALY rate in China decreased from 
24.47 (95% CI: 17.88, 30.19) per 100,000 people in 1990 to 13.10 (95% CI: 10.29, 
16.31) per 100,000 people in 2019. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) 
in age-standardized incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates for IBD in China 
were 2.51 (95% CI: 2.44, 2.57), 2.53 (95% CI: 2.41, 2.66), and -3.62 (95% CI: 
-3.85, -3.39). The effects of age, period, and cohort on incidence and mortality 
rates differed.
CONCLUSIONS: The increasing age-standardized prevalence rates are contributed to 
by the reduction in age-standardized mortality rates and DALYs, compounded by 
the rise in the age-standardized incidence rates between 1990 and 2019 in China. 
The burden of IBD in China will be a major public health challenge, given the 
country's large population base and aging population.

BACKGROUND: High body mass index (BMI) plays a critical role in the initiation 
and development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Up to now, far too little attention 
has been paid to the global burden of T2D attributable to high BMI. This study 
aims to report the deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of T2D 
related to high BMI in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data on T2D burden attributable to high BMI were retrieved from the 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019. The 
global cases, age-standardized rates of mortality (ASMR), and 
disability-adjusted life years (ASDR) attributable to high BMI were estimated by 
age, sex, geographical location, and socio-demographic index (SDI). The 
estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to quantify the trends 
of ASMR and ASDR during the period 1990-2019.
RESULTS: Globally, there were 619,494.8 deaths and 34,422,224.8 DALYs of T2D 
attributed to high BMI in 2019, more than triple in 1990. Moreover, the pace of 
increase in ASMR and ASDR accelerated during 1990-2019, with EAPC of 1.36 (95% 
CI: 1.27 to 1.45) and 2.13 (95% CI: 2.10 to 2.17) separately, especially in men, 
South Asia, and low-middle SDI regions. Oceania was the high-risk area of 
standardized T2D deaths and DALYs attributable to high BMI in 2019, among which 
Fiji was the country with the heaviest burden. In terms of SDI, middle SDI 
regions had the biggest T2D-related ASMR and ASDR in 2019.
CONCLUSION: The global deaths and DALYs of T2D attributable to high BMI 
substantially increased from 1990 to 2019. High BMI as a major public health 
problem needs to be tackled properly and timely in patients with T2D.
