exercise responses involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematopoietic, 
neuropsychological, and skeletal muscle systems, which are not adequately 
reflected through the measurement of individual organ system function. This 
relatively noninvasive, dynamic, physiologic overview allows the evaluation of 
both submaximal and peak exercise responses, providing the physician with 
relevant information for clinical decision-making. Chronic heart failure is a 
significant cause of worldwide mortality and morbidity, whose clinical picture 
is characterized by exercise intolerance and impaired quality of life. The 
purpose of this review is to provide an update of the role of cardiopulmonary 
exercise testing in patients with heart failure with specific comorbidities. 
Patients with heart failure frequently present concomitant clinical conditions, 
such as obesity, anemia, lung or kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, 
depression, and psychogenic disorders, which could affect length and quality of 
life, including everyday activities and exercise performance. Poor effort and 
malingering may be suspected when early discontinuation of the exercise test 
with irregular breathing occurs.

In this study cinnamon essential oil-incorporated chitosan nanoparticles 
(CEO-CSNPs) were produced by an emulsion-gelation method. Size, zeta potential 
and polydispersity index of the formed nanoparticles were 235.6nm, 25.1mV and 
0.33, respectively. In vitro release evaluation showed an initial burst effect, 
followed by a slow CEO release during 104h (at pH∼5). Different formulations of 
patties including control, samples containing free and encapsulated CEO and 
ascorbic acid were analyzed for physicochemical characteristics, microbial 
growth and sensorial attributes during 8days of storage at 4°C. Both free and 
encapsulated CEO decreased the microbial population of patties compared to the 
control (p<0.05) throughout the experiment. On the 8th day, the best 
formulations in TBARS test were AA-0.05 (0.05% of ascorbic acid) and 0.1-EN-CEO 
(0.1% of encapsulated CEO). During storage, the color parameters of the patties 
containing encapsulated CEO changed slightly whereas color and metmyoglobin 
content significantly decreased in samples containing free CEO and control. Free 
CEO had an unfavorable impact on color and odor but the incorporation of 
encapsulated CEO improved the consumer acceptability. The principle component 
analysis clearly distinguished 6 formulation groups based on physicochemical 
characteristics.

Chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogs, such as Ara-C, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and 
Trifluridine (FTD), are frequently incorporated into DNA by the replicative DNA 
polymerases. However, it remains unclear how this incorporation kills cycling 
cells. There are two possibilities: Nucleoside analog triphosphates inhibit the 
replicative DNA polymerases, and/or nucleotide analogs mis-incorporated into 
genomic DNA interfere with the next round of DNA synthesis as replicative DNA 
polymerases recognize them as template DNA lesions, arresting synthesis. To 
address the first possibility, we selectively disrupted the proofreading 
exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase ε (Polε), the leading-strand replicative 
polymerase in avian DT40 and human TK6 cell lines. To address the second, we 
disrupted RAD18, a gene involved in translesion DNA synthesis, a mechanism that 
relieves stalled replication. Strikingly, POLE1exo-/- cells, but not RAD18-/- 
cells, were hypersensitive to Ara-C, while RAD18-/- cells were hypersensitive to 
FTD. gH2AX focus formation following a pulse of Ara-C was immediate and did not 
progress into the next round of replication, while gH2AX focus formation 
following a pulse of 5-FU and FTD was delayed to the next round of replication. 
Biochemical studies indicate that human proofreading-deficient Polε-exo- 
holoenzyme incorporates Ara-CTP, but subsequently extend from this base several 
times less efficiently than from intact nucleotides. Together our results 
suggest that Ara-C acts by blocking extension of the nascent DNA strand and is 
counteracted by the proofreading activity of Polε, while 5-FU and FTD are 
efficiently incorporated but act as replication fork blocks in the subsequent S 
phase, which is counteracted by translesion synthesis.

Gliomas represent a broad spectrum of disease with life-expectancy outcomes 
ranging from months to decades. As our understanding of the molecular profiles 
of gliomas expands rapidly, practitioners are now better able to identify 
patients with favorable versus nonfavorable prognoses. Radiation therapy plays a 
key role in glioma treatment, improving disease control and oftentimes survival. 
However, for survivors, either long-term or short-term, radiation-induced 
cognitive impairments may negatively impact their quality of life. For patients 
with both favorable and unfavorable prognoses, intensity modulated proton 
therapy (IMPT) may offer significant, yet unproven benefits. IMPT is the newest 
and most advanced proton delivery technique, one with substantial benefits 
compared with historical proton techniques. IMPT allows practitioners to 
maximize the physical benefits of protons, increasing normal tissue sparing and 
reducing the potential for adverse effects. For more aggressive tumors, the dose 
conformality and normal tissue sparing afforded by IMPT may also allow for dose 
escalation to target volumes. However, in order to truly maximize the clinical 
potential of IMPT, the field of radiation oncology must not only implement the 
most advanced technologies, but also understand and capitalize on the unique 
biologic aspects of proton therapy.

AIMS: To investigate the development of healthy life expectancy from 65 years 
(HLE65) in Sweden in the period 1980-2011 using the health indicators activities 
of daily living (ADL) and mobility limitations within the framework of the 
postponement, compression and expansion theories.
METHODS: Sources of data for the HLE computations were Swedish national 
mortality statistics and the nationwide Swedish Surveys of Living Conditions, 
conducted biennially by Statistics Sweden since 1974. We used the Sullivan 
method for calculations of HLE and a decomposition into mortality and disability 
effects was made.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at age 65 (LE65) increased by 3.1 years for women and 
4.0 years for men from 1980-1985 to 2006-2011. HLE65 calculated according to ADL 
and mobility limitations increased more rapidly than LE65 for both men and women 
( p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results for trends in the Swedish LE65 and HLE65, computed on 
the basis of ADL and mobility limitations and using the Swedish Surveys of 
Living Conditions study, are in line with the postponement hypothesis and there 
is also a tendency for compression. Thus the years with ADL dependence and 
mobility limitations are postponed to a higher age and the numbers of these 
years have decreased.

AIMS: Nordic welfare states have achieved admirable population health profiles 
as a result of public policies that provide economic and social security across 
the life course. Denmark has been an exception to this rule, as its life 
expectancies and infant mortality rates since the mid-1970s have lagged behind 
the other Nordic nations and, in the case of life expectancy, behind most 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations.
METHODS: In this review paper, we identify a number of new hypotheses for why 
this may be the case.
RESULTS: These hypotheses concern the health effects of neo-liberal 
restructuring of the economy and its institutions, the institution of 
flexi-security in Denmark's labour market and the influence of Denmark's tobacco 
and alcohol industries. Also of note is that Denmark experienced higher 
unemployment rates during its initial period of health stagnation, as well as 
its treatment of non-Western immigrants and high wealth inequality and, until 
recently, the fact that Denmark did not systematically address the issue of 
health inequalities.
CONCLUSIONS: These hypotheses may serve as covering explanations for the usually 
provided accounts of elevated behavioural risks and psychosocial stress as being 
responsible for Denmark's health profile.

There is a growing recognition of the complex interplay between renal cell 
cancer (RCC), kidney function, mechanical reduction of nephron mass, and 
systemic agents targeting the cancer. Earlier detection of RCC and rising life 
expectancy of cancer survivors places a greater emphasis on preservation of 
renal function after cancer resection and during systemic therapy. Unique 
adverse effects associated with RCC drugs not only help reveal cancer 
pathophysiology but also expand our knowledge of normal cell signaling and 
metabolism. In this review, we outline our current understanding of RCC biology 
and treatment, their bidirectional relationship with kidney function, and unmet 
research needs in this field.

OBJECTIVES: Evaluating the cost effectiveness and cost utility of an integrated 
care intervention and participatory workplace intervention for workers with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to improve their work productivity.
METHODS: Twelve month follow-up economic evaluation alongside a randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) within specialized rheumatology treatment centers. Adults 
diagnosed with RA between 18-64 years, in a paid job for at least eight hours 
per week, experiencing minor difficulties in work functioning were randomized to 
the intervention (n = 75) or the care-as-usual (CAU) group (n = 75). Effect 
outcomes were productivity and quality of life (QALYs). Costs associated with 
healthcare, patient and family, productivity, and intervention were calculated 
from a societal perspective. Cost effectiveness and cost utility were assessed 
to indicate the incremental costs and benefits per additional unit of effect. 
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses evaluated the robustness of the findings.
RESULTS: At-work productivity loss was about 4.6 hours in the intervention group 
and 3.5 hours in the care as usual (CAU) group per two weeks. Differences in 
QALY were negligible; 0.77 for the CAU group and 0.74 for the intervention 
group. In total, average costs after twelve months follow-up were highest in the 
intervention group (€7,437.76) compared to the CAU group (€5,758.23). The 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses show that the intervention was less 
effective and (often) more expensive when compared to CAU. Sensitivity analyses 
supported these findings.
DISCUSSION: The integrated care intervention and participatory workplace 
intervention for workers with RA provides gains neither in productivity at the 
workplace nor in quality of life. These results do not justify the additional 
costs.

BACKGROUND: Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation are at increased risk of 
developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. This economic modeling study evaluated 
different preventive interventions for 30-year-old women with a confirmed BRCA 
(1 or 2) mutation.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the costs and benefits [i.e., 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and life years gained (LYG)] associated 
with prophylactic bilateral mastectomy (BM), prophylactic bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), BM plus BSO, BM plus BSO at age 40, and intensified 
surveillance. Relevant input data was obtained from a large German database 
including 5902 women with BRCA 1 or 2, and from the literature. The analysis was 
performed from the German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) perspective. In order 
to assess the robustness of the results, deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: With costs of €29,434 and a gain in QALYs of 17.7 (LYG 19.9), BM plus 
BSO at age 30 was less expensive and more effective than the other strategies, 
followed by BM plus BSO at age 40. Women who were offered the surveillance 
strategy had the highest costs at the lowest gain in QALYs/LYS. In the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of cost-saving was 57% for 
BM plus BSO. At a WTP of 10,000 € per QALY, the probability of the intervention 
being cost-effective was 80%.
CONCLUSIONS: From the SHI perspective, undergoing BM plus immediate BSO should 
be recommended to BRCA 1 or 2 mutation carriers due to its favorable comparative 
cost-effectiveness.

This study investigates the antibacterial mechanism of action of electrospun 
chitosan-based nanofibers (CNFs), against Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica 
serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria innocua, bacteria 
frequently involved in food contamination and spoilage. CNFs were prepared by 
electrospinning of chitosan and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) blends. The in vitro 
antibacterial activity of CNFs was evaluated and the susceptibility/resistance 
of the selected bacteria toward CNFs was examined. Strain susceptibility was 
evaluated in terms of bacterial type, cell surface hydrophobicity, and charge 
density, as well as pathogenicity. The efficiency of CNFs on the preservation 
and shelf life extension of fresh red meat was also assessed. Our results 
demonstrate that the antibacterial action of CNFs depends on the protonation of 
their amino groups, regardless of bacterial type and their mechanism of action 
was bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic. Results also indicate that 
bacterial susceptibility was not Gram-dependent but strain-dependent, with 
non-virulent bacteria showing higher susceptibility at a reduction rate of 
99.9%. The susceptibility order was: E. coli > L. innocua > S. aureus > S. 
Typhimurium. Finally, an extension of one week of the shelf life of fresh meat 
was successfully achieved. These results are promising and of great utility for 
the potential use of CNFs as bioactive food packaging materials in the food 
industry, and more specifically in meat quality preservation.

STUDY QUESTION: What are the parameters of semen quality in Baltic men?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Combined parameters of sperm concentration, motility and 
morphology revealed that 11-15% of men had low semen quality, 37-50% 
intermediate and 38-52% high semen quality.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Previous studies have revealed regional differences in 
semen parameters, and semen quality of Baltic men has been suggested to be 
better than that of other European men.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a cross-sectional study of 1165 men aged 
16-29 years from Estonia (N = 573), Latvia (N = 278) and Lithuania (N = 314) 
conducted in 2003-2004.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: Men from the general population, median 
age 19.8 years, provided one semen sample each, had blood samples taken, had 
testis size determined, and provided information on lifestyle. Based on combined 
data of sperm concentration, sperm motility and morphology the cohort was 
classified into three categories: low, intermediate or high semen quality. 
Comparisons between groups (including subgroups of Estonian men of Russian 
versus Estonian ethnicity) were tested, adjusting for ejaculation abstinence and 
age.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The median sperm concentration of the 
Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian populations of Baltic men was 63 mill/ml. Low 
semen quality was detected in 11-15% of the men, intermediate in 37-50% and high 
in 38-52%. No crucial differences between national subgroups were detected, 
except that a higher percentage (9.6%) of the subgroup of Russian Estonians 
reported having had cryptorchidism compared to the other men (2.5-3.6%, P < 
0.001). Smoking had an adverse impact on both sperm concentration and total 
sperm counts (P < 0.001).
LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: The semen quality data were collected >10 years 
ago. Thus, a recent change in semen quality cannot be excluded. Owing to the 
study design, it is assumed, but unproven, that the men were representative of 
the general populations. Some men were very young (16 years), however, this was 
also the case for other European studies of similar populations. Assessment of 
sperm motility is associated with inter-observer variation, and no quality 
control was undertaken for sperm motility assessment to account for that. Thus, 
estimates of sperm motility should be interpreted with caution.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Analysis of the semen variables separately 
did not identify that a considerable percentage of Baltic men had low semen 
quality. The combined analysis, however, showed that more than one out of nine 
men had semen quality at a level indicating reduced fertility chances. We 
suggest that future studies of semen quality should be carried out reporting 
both results of single semen parameters and estimates that combine the most 
frequently assessed variables.
STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was funded by the EU fifth 
framework project Number QLK4-1999-01422 'Envir.Repro.Health' extension to 
Baltic countries Number QLRT-2001-02911; Estonian Science Foundation, grant 
numbers 2991 and PUT181. There are no competing interests.

Carcinomas of unknown primary (CUP) form a whole group of heterogeneous 
neoplasias. CUP are defined as metastatic epithelial tumors in which the initial 
work up has failed to detect the primary site. Their frequency is 3-5 % of the 
adult solid neoplasias. The prognosis is poor with a life expectancy of a few 
months (inferior to 1 year). The treatment depends on the histology and, 
particularly, on the metastatic localiza¬tion. Surgery with or without 
radiotherapy is the preferred treatment option for isolated lesions. Systemic 
chemotherapy (with platinum compound) will be recommended for multiple lesions. 
The genetic expression profile of tumor cells could be useful in the future to 
determine the site of the primary tumor and/or to offer the best therapy for 
each patient.

Publisher: Les carcinomes de site primitif inconnu ou CaPI, forment un groupe 
d’entités pathologiques très hétérogènes de par leurs modes de révélation et 
leurs présentations cliniques. Le CaPI se définit par une tumeur épithéliale 
maligne, d’emblée métastatique, dont le site initial reste occulte au terme du 
bilan pré-thérapeutique exhaustif. Il représente 3 à 5 % des tumeurs solides 
malignes de l’adulte. Son pronostic est sombre avec une médiane de survie allant 
de 6 à 10 mois. La thérapeutique sera fonction de l’histologie tumorale, de la 
localisation métastatique et de la suspicion d’origine du primitif. En présence 
d’une néoplasie localisée, une prise en charge chirurgicale accompagnée ou non 
d’une radiothérapie sera proposée; en cas de dissémination métastatique 
multiple, une chimiothérapie systémique à base de sels de platine est 
recommandée. L’espoir réside dans l’analyse du profil moléculaire, afin de 
définir avec précision l’origine tumorale primitive et d’offrir la thérapeutique 
la mieux adaptée possible.

PURPOSE: The rising incidence and life expectancy associated with prostate 
cancer (PCa) has led to increasing interest in predicting the risk of second 
primary malignancies (SPMs) among PCa survivors, although data regarding SPMs 
after PCa are controversial.
METHODS: We identified 30,964 patients from the National Health Insurance 
Research Database in Taiwan who had newly diagnosed PCa between 2000 and 2010. 
Each patient was randomly frequency-matched with an individual without PCa, 
based on age, comorbidity, and index year. Competing-risks regression models 
were used to estimate subhazard ratios (SHRs) of SPMs development associated 
with PCa. The Bonferroni adjustment was used in multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: Men with PCa had a trend of lower risk of developing overall SPMs 
compared to those without PCa (adjusted SHR = 0.94, 99.72% confidence interval 
[CI] = 0.89-1.00, p = 0.06). The risks of lung and liver cancer were 
significantly lower. In contrast, these patients had a significantly higher risk 
of thyroid cancer. There is a trend for a higher risk of developing SPMs in the 
urinary bladder and rectum/anus. Further analyses indicated that PCa patients 
who received radiation therapy (RT) had an increased risk of overall SPMs, 
hematologic malignancies, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, and 
urinary bladder cancer compared with those who did not receive RT.
CONCLUSION: Men with PCa tended to have a lower risk of SPMs, but a 
significantly higher risk of subsequent thyroid cancer. Continued cancer 
surveillance is required among PCa survivors, especially in specific sites and 
in individuals who received RT.

The well-being of older adults is frequently tied to support from their adult 
children. Here, we assess whether the education of adult offspring is associated 
with changes to older parents' short- and long-term health in Mexico, a rapidly 
aging context with historically limited institutional support for the elderly. 
Educational expansion over the past half century, however, provides older adults 
with greater resources to rely on via the education of their children. Using 
longitudinal data from the Mexican Health and Aging Study (2001-2012), we find 
that offspring education is not associated with short-term changes in parents' 
physical functioning, but is associated with increased parental longevity, net 
of children's financial status and transfers. In addition, we find that mothers' 
longevity is more sensitive to offspring education than fathers. Our findings 
add to a growing body of literature that urges policy-makers to consider the 
multi-generational advantages of expanding educational opportunities in Mexico.

Novel Augmentation Strategies in Major Depression.

Martiny K(1).

Author information:

Hypothesis The hypotheses of all the four included studies share the common idea 
that it is possible to augment the effect of antidepressant drug treatment by 
applying different interventions and with each intervention attain a clinically 
meaningful better effect compared to a control condition, and with minor side 
effects, thus improving the short- and medium-term outcome in major depression. 
Procedures Study design The basic study design has been the double blind 
randomised controlled trial (RCT). In the light therapy study, all patients were 
treated with sertraline for the whole of the study duration. In the first five 
weeks of the study, patients were randomised to treatment with either 60 minutes 
of bright white or 30 minutes of dim red light (sham condition). In the four 
weeks follow-up period, patients were treated with sertraline alone. In the 
Pindolol study, all patients were treated with venlafaxine and randomised to 
augmentation with either active or placebo matching pindolol tablets. In the 
PEMF study patients were continued on ongoing medication and randomised to 
augmentation with active or inactive (sham) 30 minutes daily PEMF treatment on 
weekdays. In the Chronos study all patients were treated with duloxetine and 
randomized to either a combination of three wake therapies with daily bright 
light treatment and sleep time stabilisation (wake group) or to daily exercise 
of minimum 30 minutes as an active control intervention (exercise group). The 
Chronos study was divided into: (1) a one-week run-in phase where duloxetine 
were started (and continued for the whole 29 week study period), (2) a one-week 
inpatient intervention phase where patient in the wake group did three wake 
therapies (sleep abstinence for the whole night and the following day until 
evening) in combination with daily light therapy and guidance on sleep time 
stabilisation and patients in the exercise group started a daily exercise 
program, (3) a seven week continuation phase where patient in the wake group 
continued light therapy and sleep time stabilisation and patients in the 
exercise group continued an individual exercise program, and (4) a 20 week 
follow-up phase with the same treatment elements but where duloxetine dosage 
could be adjusted or changed to other antidepressants. Recruitment Patients 
recruited for these studies were allocated from general practitioners, 
psychiatric specialist practices and for the lesser part from open psychiatric 
wards. Only a few patients were re-cruited through advertisements (in the PEMF 
and Chronos studies).   Inclusion criteria Inclusion criteria were major 
depression according to the DSM-IV, including a depressive episode as part of a 
bipolar disorder. For the PEMF study, treatment resistance was a specific 
inclusion criterion. Duration of studies Study duration was nine weeks for the 
light therapy study, 19 days for the Pindolol study, five weeks for the PEMF 
study, and 29 weeks for the Chronos study. Assessments In all studies, 
assessments were done with clinician rated scales, patient self-assessment 
scales, including quality of life scales and a side effect scale. As clinician 
rated scales we used the Hamilton depression rating scale: the HAM-D17 and its 6 
item subscale: the HAM-D6, the Bech Rafaelsen Melancholia scale (MES), and the 
Bech Rafaelsen Mania scale (MAS). As self-assessment scales we used the Major 
Depression Inventory (MDI), the Symptom Check-list (SCL-92), and the Preskorn 
scale. For side effects we used the UKU scale. Further scales used are mentioned 
in the specific study sections. Assessments in the light therapy study were done 
weekly for the first six weeks and finally after nine weeks; at four time points 
in the Pindolol study (baseline, days 6, 11 and 19), weekly for five weeks in 
the PEMF study and weekly for the first nine weeks of the Chronos study and 
thereafter every four weeks. The clinical setting for evaluation has been the 
Psychiatric Research Unit at Mental Health Centre North Zealand. For the Bright 
Light study, Pindolol and PEMF study patients were also seen at a psychiatric 
specialist practice in Copenhagen. Biochemical measures In the Light therapy 
study saliva cortisol was collected at baseline before start of light therapy 
and sertraline and blood was drawn for thyroid analysis. In the Chronos study 
saliva and 24 hour urine cortisol was collected in the patients randomised to 
the exercise group. Main results The main results from the Bright Light study 
covering the first five weeks of the study are given in the PhD thesis 
"Adjunctive bright light in nonseasonal major depression" defended and awarded 
on the 18 November 2004 at the University of Copenhagen. Results from the 
cortisol measurement and for the four weeks extension period were published in 
separate papers after the PhD thesis and are included in this thesis. Results 
from the Bright Light study Analysis of the saliva cortisol measurements taken 
at baseline of the study as cortisol awakening profiles (CAR) showed that 
patients responded differentially to light treatment according to their CAR 
levels (dichotomized to high or low about the mean). Thus, in the bright light 
group HAM-D17 scores were reduced by 15.7 (4.2) points for patients with a low 
CAR (below mean), and 11.4 (4.8) points for patients with a high CAR (above 
mean). In the dim light group the corresponding values were 11.1 (5.2) for 
patients with a low CAR and 11.3 (5.3) for patients with a high CAR. This 
interaction between CAR and treatment group was statistically significant (p = 
0.006). Survival analysis, for the first five weeks of the study period, showed 
a statistically significant higher response rate (χ2= 9.6, p =0.002) and higher 
remission rate (χ2 = 12.5, p = 0.0004) for the bright light treated group versus 
the dim light treated group. At end of the five weeks of light treatment 
response rates were 66.7% versus 40.7 % and remission rates were 41.7 % versus 
14.8 % for the bright versus dim light treated group. In the subsequent 
publication that covered the four weeks extension period where light treatment 
was discontinued, data showed that the attained differences in response and 
remission rates between groups were not sustained. The offset of effect was 
nearly complete after four weeks of continued treatment on sertraline only. 
Thus, at end-point, response rates were 79.2 % versus 75.9 % and remission rates 
were 60 .4 % versus 55.6% in the bright versus dim light groups. The conclusion 
reached was that bright light in non-seasonal depression should be used to 
achieve an earlier antidepressant response and that light therapy probably 
should be of longer duration. Results from the Pindolol study The results from 
the Pindolol study showed that pindolol did not augment the effect of 
venlafaxine for the whole sample. However, for those patients classified as slow 
metabolizers, based on their O-desmethylvenlafaxine/venlafaxine ratio (ODV/V), 
pindolol did augment the antidepressant effect. For patients classified as fast 
metabolizers, pindolol worsened the outcome. This interaction between ODV/V 
ratio and treatment group was statistically significant (p = 0.01). Results from 
the PEMF study The results from the PEMF Study showed that treatment with active 
versus sham PEMF augmented the effect of the ongoing anti-depressant medication 
treatment. Thus, patients in the active PEMF group attained a statistically 
significant greater score reduction from week one and at all subsequent 
assessments compared to the sham treated group (p < 0.01). Response and 
remission rates in the active PEMF group were also larger than in the sham 
treated group with response rates at endpoint of 61.0 % versus 12.9 % (p < 0.01) 
and remission rates of 33.9 % versus 4.1 % (p < 0.05). Results from the Chronos 
study The Chronos study, published in three papers, covers a one-week 
intervention phase, a seven weeks continuation phase, and a 20 weeks follow-up 
phase. Results from the intervention week showed that patient treated in the 
wake group, from the day after the first wake therapy, had en clinically and 
statistically significant better antidepressant effect compared to the exercise 
group. On the HAM-D6 scale (which does not contains sleep items), patients in 
the wake group had a response rate after the first wake therapy of 58.7% versus 
13.7% i the exercise group (p <0.0001) and a remission rate of 38.6% versus 2.9% 
(p <0.0001). After the second recovery sleep (the night after the second wake 
therapy = dag 5) patients in the wake group had a response rate of 75.0% versus 
25.1% in the exercise group (p <0.0001) and remission rates of 58.6% versus 6.0% 
(p <0.0001). Results from the continuation phase showed, on the HAM-D17 scale 
which was used at all the following assessments, at week two response rates of 
41.4% in the wake group and 12.8% in the exercise group (p = 0.003) and 
remission rates of 23.9% versus 5.4% (p = 0,004). This clinically relevant and 
statistically significant difference between the wake and exercise groups was 
maintained at all the subsequent assessments with response rates of 71.4% versus 
47.3% (p = 0.04) and remission rates of 45.6% versus 23.1% (p = 0.04), at week 
nine. Results from the 20 weeks follow-up phase showed a continued better effect 
in the wake group at all visits with HAM-D17 depression scored at week 29 of 7.5 
(SE = 0.9) in the wake group versus 10.1 (SE = 0.9), (p = 0.02) in the exercise 
group. Remission rates were higher in the wake group with endpoint rates of 
61.9% versus 37.9% (p = 0.01) in the exercise group. Response rates was only 
numerically, but not statistically, higher in the wake group with 74.6% versus 
64.4% in the exercise group (p = 0.22). The sleep diary data showed a 
statistically smaller day-to-day variation in sleep onset, sleep midpoint, sleep 
offset and sleep duration in the wake group compared to the exercise group as a 
sign of better day-to-day sleep-wake cycle control in the wake group (p < 0.01). 
In the first nine weeks of the study patients in the wake group had a moderate 
sleep phase advance that diminished during the follow-up period. The 
hypothesised predictors for response to wake therapy were confirmed. Thus, in 
the wake group, a positive diurnal variation (morning worst, evening best) was 
associated with a better out-come, after the wake therapies, compared to a 
negative diurnal variation (morning best, evening worst). In the exercise group, 
the reverse was found, as a positive diurnal variation was associated with worse 
outcome, compared to a negative diurnal variation. This interaction between 
group and diurnal variation was statistically significant (p = 0.0004). The 
positive predictive value of response to the first wake therapy (i.e. 
maintaining response also at week two) was 56.3 % and the negative predictive 
value of non-response to the first wake therapy (i.e. maintaining no response 
also at week two) was 75.0 %. The impact of naps on depression severity was 
examined. In the wake group, patients who napped on the days after wake therapy 
compared to those patients not napping, had a more severe deterioration at the 
following assessment at week two (p = 0.02). Patients in the exercise group were 
able to perform exercise with a mean of 63.0 minutes/day (55.3) for the first 
eight weeks.

The aim of this study was to examine the temporal relationship between 
intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content and the expression of genes associated 
with IMCL turnover, fat metabolism, and inflammation during recovery from an 
acute bout of resistance type exercise in old versus young men. Seven healthy 
young (23±2years, 77.2±2.9kg) and seven healthy older (72±1years, 79.3±4.9kg) 
males performed a single bout of resistance exercise involving 6 sets of 10 
repetitions of leg press and 6 sets of 10 repetitions of leg extension at 75% 
one-repetition maximum (1-RM). Muscle biopsy samples were obtained before and 
12, 24 and 48h after the completion of exercise and analysed for IMCL content 
and the expression of 48 genes. The subjects refrained from further heavy 
physical exercise and consumed a standardized diet for the entire experimental 
period. The IMCL content was ~2-fold higher at baseline and 12h post-exercise in 
old compared with young individuals. However, no differences between groups were 
apparent after 48h of recovery. There was higher expression of genes involved in 
fatty acid synthesis (FASN and PPARγ) during the first 24h of recovery. 
Differential responses to exercise were observed between groups for a number of 
genes indicating increased inflammatory response (IL6, IkBalpha, CREB1) and 
impaired fat metabolism and TCA cycle (LPL, ACAT1, SUCLG1) in older compared 
with younger individuals. A singe bout of resistance type exercise leads to 
molecular changes in skeletal muscle favouring reduced lipid oxidation, 
increased lipogenesis, and exaggerated inflammation during post-exercise 
recovery in the older compared with younger individuals, which may be indicative 
of a blunted response of IMCL turnover with ageing.

Liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have worldwide impact but 
continue to lack safe, low cost, and effective treatments. In this study, we 
show how the simple polyamine spermidine can relieve cancer cell defects in 
autophagy, which trigger oxidative stress-induced cell death and promote liver 
fibrosis and HCC. We found that the autophagic marker protein LC3 interacted 
with the microtubule-associated protein MAP1S, which positively regulated 
autophagy flux in cells. MAP1S stability was regulated in turn by its 
interaction with the histone deacetylase HDAC4. Notably, MAP1S-deficient mice 
exhibited a 20% reduction in median survival and developed severe liver fibrosis 
and HCC under stress. Wild-type mice or cells treated with spermidine exhibited 
a relative increase in MAP1S stability and autophagy signaling via depletion of 
cytosolic HDAC4. Extending recent evidence that orally administered spermidine 
can extend lifespan in mice, we determined that life extension of up to 25% can 
be produced by lifelong administration, which also reduced liver fibrosis and 
HCC foci as induced by chemical insults. Genetic investigations established that 
these observed impacts of oral spermidine administration relied upon 
MAP1S-mediated autophagy. Our findings offer a preclinical proof of concept for 
the administration of oral spermidine to prevent liver fibrosis and HCC and 
potentially extend lifespan. Cancer Res; 77(11); 2938-51. ©2017 AACR.

Grade III valgus deformity (tibiofemoral alignment > 20°) is present in only 
0.5% of patients receiving total knee arthroplasty. Furthermore, cases with a 
valgus deformity exceeding 40° are even rarer. Since they mostly affect elderly, 
polymorbid patients, successful outcome means a great challenge. We report on a 
case of a 90-year-old patient with a valgus deformity of 47°. The patient was 
preoperatively restricted to a wheel chair, unable to walk, and only able to 
stand for a few seconds. The maximal knee flexion was 100°, and there was an 
extension deficit of 15°. The WOMAC score was 91; the EQ-5D-5L Index was 0.048. 
She was treated with a constrained hinged prosthesis. Postoperatively, the axis 
was 6° valgus. After 3 months of rehabilitation, she was independent using a 
wheeled walker. The maximal flexion of the knee was 110° and there was no 
extension deficit. The WOMAC score was 45; the EQ-5D-5L Index was 0.813. This 
case demonstrates the possibility of a satisfactory result and an improvement in 
quality of life and mobility with a plausible timetable and with reasonable use 
of resources even in advanced age and severe valgus deformity.
