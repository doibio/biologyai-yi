for HMs from ingestion.
CONCLUSION: Through a comprehensive assessment of the health risks in housewives 
exposed to emissions from coal combustion, we can gain insight into the hazards 
from PAHs and HMs in housewives, and take measures to reduce their exposure 
risks.

Research on religiosity and health has generally focussed on the United States, 
and outcomes of health or mortality but not both. Using the European Values 
Survey 2008, we examined cross-sectional associations between four dimensions of 
religiosity/spirituality: attendance, private prayer, importance of religion, 
belief in God; and healthy life expectancy (HLE) based on self-reported health 
across 47 European countries (n = 65,303 individuals). Greater levels of private 
prayer, importance of religion and belief in God, at a country level, were 
associated with lower HLE at age 20, after adjustment for confounders, but only 
in women. The findings may explain HLE inequalities between European countries.

Effects of passive heat stress and recovery on human cognitive function: An ERP 
study.

Sciences, Okazaki, Japan.

Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we investigated the effects of passive 
heat stress and recovery on the human cognitive function with Flanker tasks, 
involving congruent and incongruent stimuli. We hypothesized that modulation of 
the peak amplitude and latency of the P300 component in ERP waveforms would 
differ with task difficulty during passive heat stress and recovery. Subjects 
performed the Flanker tasks before (Pre), at the end of whole body heating 
(Heat: internal temperature increase of ~1.2°C from the pre-heat baseline), and 
after the internal temperature had returned to the pre-heat baseline (Recovery). 
The internal temperature was regulated by a tube-lined suit by perfusing 50°C 
water for heat stress and 25°C water for recovery immediately after the heat 
stress. Regardless of task difficulty, the reaction time (RT) was shortened 
during Heat rather than Pre and Recovery, and standard deviations of RT (i.e., 
response variability) were significantly smaller during Heat than Pre. However, 
the peak amplitudes of the P300 component in ERPs, which involved selective 
attention, expectancy, and memory updating, were significantly smaller during 
Heat than during Pre, suggesting the impairment of neural activity in cognitive 
function. Notably, the peak amplitudes of the P300 component were higher during 
Recovery than during Heat, indicating that the impaired neural activity had 
recovered after sufficient whole-body cooling. An indicator of the stimulus 
classification/evaluation time (peak latency of P300) and the RT were shortened 
during Heat stress, but such shortening was not noted after whole-body cooling. 
These results suggest that hyperthermia affects the human cognitive function, 
reflected by the peak amplitude and latency of the P300 component in ERPs during 
the Flanker tasks, but sufficient treatment such as whole-body cooling performed 
in this study can recover those functions.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Total hip arthroplasty is known as one of the best 
advancements in orthopedics in the 20th century. Due to age or trauma hip joint 
has to replace by an artificial implant. After the hip arthroplasty, the 
patients can return to normal day-to-day activities with a normal range of 
motion. There are several types and designs are currently available. These 
designs usually depend upon the anatomy of the patients. There is a need for 
revision surgery due to dislocation and aseptic loosening in these joints over 
time in actively younger patients. Minor changes in the design stage can 
certainly improve the life expectancy of the implant and will also further 
reduce the revision rate.
METHODS: In this current work, finite element analysis is carried out by varying 
the neck length with a change in femoral head size for a circular-shaped stem. 
The effects of using a shorter neck are analyzed. A total of nine combinations 
are considered for analysis. Modeling is carried out in CATIA V-6 and analysis 
is performed in ANSYS R-19. A femoral head of 36, 40, and 44 mm and taper neck 
length of 18, 16, and 14 mm is considered. CoPE is considered as the material 
combination for all the models.
RESULTS: It was observed that the von Mises stresses in the complete implant 
tend to decrease with an increase in the femoral head size. Maximum 5% variation 
in stress values when 36 mm femoral head is compared with 44 mm. The stresses in 
the taper neck region tend to decrease with a decrease in the neck length. 
Minimum von Mises stress of 161.83 MPa was found for the complete implant and in 
the head-neck region, a minimum von Mises stress found 91.9 MPa.
CONCLUSIONS: Performance evaluation of hip implant under static loading 
conditions gives a clear idea about the behavior of implant. It was found that a 
decrease in the von Mises stresses with a decrease in the taper length. However, 
these variations won't affect much in the performance of the hip implant. Also, 
a reduction in taper length can significantly increase the dislocation in the 
implant. So it is advised to consider the optimal taper length with an increase 
in the femoral head size.

PURPOSE: Angiosarcomas represents a diverse group of aggressive high-grade 
vascular tumours with limited therapeutic options. We sought to determine the 
safety and efficacy of regorafenib, a small-molecule multikinase inhibitor, in 
the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced unresectable angiosarcoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this single-arm multicentre, open-label phase II 
clinical trial, 31 patients were enrolled and received regorafenib 160 mg PO 
daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint for the study was 
progression-free survival at 4 months. Secondary endpoints included overall 
survival, response rate, and safety. Patients (≥18 years) with an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0-1, a life expectancy of at least 4 
months who had progressed on at least one but no more than 4 prior lines of 
therapy were eligible.
RESULTS: Of the 23 patients evaluable for efficacy, 2 had a complete response 
(8.7%), and 2 had a partial response (8.7%), for a total overall response rate 
of 17.4%. Median PFS was 5.5 months, and 12/23 patients (52.2%) had a PFS of 
greater than 4 months. 10/31 (32.3%) patients evaluable for toxicity had a grade 
3 or higher adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Regorafenib is a safe and active treatment for refractory 
metastatic and unresectable angiosarcoma. Rates of adverse events were 
comparable to prior studies of regorafenib for other tumour types. Regorafenib, 
the single agent, could be considered as therapy for patients with metastatic or 
unresectable AS.

With the increase of life expectancy, the world's population is aging rapidly. 
Previous work in the field of aging greatly increases our understanding of 
biological mechanisms underlying longevity. Researchers have unraveled a number 
of longevity pathways conserved from yeast to mammals. However, recent evidence 
shows that mechanisms regulating the life span and those regulating age-related 
behavioral decline could be dissociated. The regulatory mechanisms underlying 
behavioral and cognitive aging is largely unknown. Previous work has described a 
significant age-related decline in cognitive behaviors including episodic 
memory, working memory, processing speed, as well as motor function 
deterioration and circadian dysfunction. With the advance of neuroscience and 
technology, more and more studies have focused on the age-related changes in 
structure and function of the brain. In this review, we briefly describe the 
deterioration of cognitive function and other behaviors in the aging process, 
and survey the role of age-related changes in brain structure and network, 
neuron morphology and function, transcriptome in brain and some conserved 
biological pathways on age-related cognitive and behavioral decline. Further 
studies on the mechanisms underpinning age-related cognitive and behavioral 
decline may provide clues not only for improving the quality of life for the 
ageing population, but also for developing intervention approaches for 
neurodegenerative diseases.

随着人类预期寿命延长,人口老龄化问题越来越严重。过去几十年关于衰老的研究使人们对长寿的生物学机理有了一定的认识,然而延长寿命应以保持老年个体健康的行为和认知功能为前提,近期研究显示延长寿命不一定延缓衰老过程中的行为和认知功能退化。衰老相关行为退化的调控机制目前知道的还很少,如何实现老年人口健康的衰老是现代社会极具挑战也是迫切需要解决的问题。衰老过程伴随着明显的认知等行为功能的退化,过去的研究对这些功能的退化进行了比较详细的描述,包括情节记忆、工作记忆、信息处理速度等认知功能的衰退,运动能力降低,节律紊乱等。随着神经科学与技术的发展,越来越多的研究集中到大脑的结构和功能随衰老的改变。本文在简单描述衰老过程中行为功能退化现象的基础上,主要对大脑结构和网络连接、神经元形态和功能、大脑基因表达以及一些保守的生物学信号通路等方面在衰老过程中的改变的研究进展展开综述性介绍,重点关注这些变化与行为和认知功能退化之间的联系。目前大部分的研究结果还只建立了这些变化与行为和认知功能退化的相关关系,因果关系的确立还有待进一步的研究。相信更多对衰老过程中行为和认知功能退化的调控机制的研究将对改善老年人的生活质量有极大帮助,同时对寻找预防神经退行性疾病发生的方法也有指示作用。.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading causes of death and 
disability worldwide. Reducing dietary salt consumption is a potentially 
cost-effective way to reduce blood pressure and the burden of CVD. To date, 
economic evidence has focused on sodium reduction in food industry or processed 
food with blood pressure as the primary outcome. This study protocol describes 
the planned within-trial economic evaluation of a low-sodium salt substitute 
intervention designed to reduce the risk of stroke in China.
METHODS AND ANALYSES: The economic evaluation will be conducted alongside the 
Salt Substitute and Stroke Study: a 5-year large scale, cluster randomised 
controlled trial. The outcomes of interest are quality of life measured using 
the EuroQol-5-Dimensions and major adverse cardiovascular events. Costs will be 
estimated from a healthcare system perspective and will be sought from the 
routinely collected data available within the New Rural Cooperative Medical 
Scheme. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be conducted, 
resulting in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per 
cardiovascular event averted and cost per quality-adjusted life year gained, 
respectively.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial received ethics approval from the University 
of Sydney Ethics Committee (2013/888) and Peking University Institutional Review 
Board (IRB00001052-13069). Informed consent was obtained from each study 
participant. Findings of the economic evaluation will be published in a 
peer-reviewed journal and presented at international conferences.

INTRODUCTION: with the increase in life expectancy, women will live longer 
during their postmenopausal period. To improve their quality of life, they 
should be aware of what challenges they will be facing. This study aimed to 
evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of middle-aged women towards 
menopause.
METHODS: in this cross-sectional study, data collected using a multistage 
clustered random sampling from 54 health centres in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo were used. Participants filled a questionnaire derived from the menopause 
rating scale and from local beliefs. The knowledge, attitudes and practices 
towards menopause were evaluated among pre- and postmenopausal women.
RESULTS: of the 353 women, both pre- and postmenopausal women knew the 
definition of menopause but for the symptoms, postmenopausal women were more 
informed than premenopausal. For the attitudes and practices towards menopause, 
while both had equally positive attitudes, the premenopausal women did not know 
which practice to adopt.
CONCLUSION: Congolese women had limited knowledge, positive attitudes and 
unconventional practices towards menopause. Health-care providers, therefore, 
need to dispense appropriate advice to middle-aged women before the advent of 
menopause.

INTRODUCTION: the provision of antiretroviral treatment (ART) to people living 
with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) has improved their life expectancy significantly. 
Conversely, this has been associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular 
diseases. Yet, research to improve understanding of cardiovascular risk factors 
among PLHIV remains limited. This study examines the prevalence and correlates 
of cardiovascular risk factors among PLHIV at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital 
(KBTH) in Accra, Ghana.
METHODS: a cross-sectional study was conducted at the KBTH, Accra, Ghana. 
Patients were recruited from the adult HIV outpatient clinic at the infectious 
disease unit, KBTH. The sample comprised 525 PLHIV, aged 18 years and above. 
Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and a multivariable binary 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: among the patients, 9.7% (n=51) had hypertension and 15.6% (n=82) were 
reportedly patients with diabetes. With respect to the serum lipid profile, 
24.8% (n=130) had hypertriglyceridemia, 49.1% (n=258) had hypercholesterolemia, 
26.3% (138) had low high-density lipoprotein, and high low-density lipoprotein 
was found in 27.2% (n=143) of the cohort. The multivariable binary logistic 
regression results showed that being unemployed, underweight, being on ART, 
being male, having a higher level of education, and not having health insurance 
subscription significantly increased the odds of cardiovascular risk factors 
among the patients.
CONCLUSION: current findings buttress concern for elevated risk of 
cardiovascular diseases among PLHIV and calls for increased attention for 
comprehensive care that includes the prevention and management of cardiovascular 
diseases and its risk factors among this vulnerable group.

Penile necrosis is an uncommon condition associated, in most cases, with 
calciphylaxis, also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy. It is a progressive 
disease found in approximately 1%-4% of patients with end stage renal disease. 
Patients with penile calciphylaxis present a mortality rate of up to 70%, with 
life expectancy of two-and a half months following the diagnosis. We report a 
severe calciphylaxis case that had to be submitted to a penectomy but survived 
the penile event.

The advances in artificial intelligence (AI) provide an opportunity to expand 
the frontier of medicine to improve diagnosis, efficiency and management. By 
extension of being able to perform any task that a human could, a machine that 
meets the requirements of artificial general intelligence ('strong' AI; AGI) 
possesses the basic necessities to perform as, or at least qualify to become, a 
doctor. In this emerging field, this article explores the distinctions between 
doctors and AGI, and the prerequisites for AGI performing as clinicians. In 
doing so, it necessitates the requirement for a classification of medical AI and 
prepares for the development of AGI. With its imminent arrival, it is beneficial 
to create a framework from which leading institutions can define specific 
criteria for AGI.

BACKGROUND: The endogenous nature of healthcare expenditure means that 
instruments are often used when estimating the relationship between expenditure 
and mortality. Previous English studies of this relationship have largely relied 
on statistical tests to justify their instruments. A recent paper proposed that 
exogenous components of the resource allocation formula, used to distribute the 
national healthcare budget to local health authorities, be used as instruments.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the relationship between healthcare expenditure and 
mortality by disease area for England from 2003/4 to 2012/13 using exogenous 
elements from the resource allocation formula as instruments for expenditure. To 
use these disease-specific estimates to calculate the marginal cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for English NHS expenditure. To compare these 
estimates with those that relied on statistical tests to justify their 
instruments.
METHODS: The two-stage least squares estimator is used to determine the annual 
relationship between mortality and healthcare expenditure by disease area across 
151 local authorities. These disease-specific outcome elasticities are combined 
with information about survival and morbidity disease burden in different 
disease areas to calculate the marginal cost per QALY for English National 
Health Service (NHS) expenditure.
RESULTS: The results suggest an annual marginal cost per QALY of between £5000 
and £10,000. This is similar to that reported previously by studies that used 
statistical tests to justify their instruments.
CONCLUSION: These cost per QALY estimates are much lower than the threshold 
currently used by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE) (£20,000 to £30,000) to assess whether a new pharmaceutical product 
should be funded by the NHS. Our estimates suggest that guidance issued by NICE 
is likely to do more harm than good, reducing health outcomes overall for the 
NHS. There may be legitimate reasons why such harms are deemed appropriate, but 
it is only through the type of empirical analysis in this paper that the reasons 
for these 'harms' are likely to be articulated and explicitly justified.

OBJECTIVE: The embolization of thrombi formed within the atria can occur in any 
form of atrial fibrillation (AF), i.e., paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent. 
Although ischemic stroke is the most frequent embolic event associated with AF, 
embolization to other sites in the pulmonary and systemic circulations may 
occasionally occur. To avert the risk of embolization, long-term oral 
anticoagulation therapy is recommended for all AF patients if the CHA2DS2-VASC 
score is at least 1 for men and at least 2 for women. Since anticoagulant 
therapy is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, the choice of oral 
anticoagulant agent should be made by careful consideration of the 
benefit-to-risk ratio. The use of a newer class of direct oral anticoagulants 
(DOACs) as an alternative to the anti-vitamin K (AVK) anticoagulants (warfarin, 
acenocumarol, etc.) can help mitigate the need for periodic monitoring of 
International Normalized Ratio (INR) and adverse bleeding events that are 
commonly associated with the use of AVK anticoagulants. Though the use of DOACs 
(dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, apixaban, etc.) is gaining ground due to 
their relative safety profile and the low overall cost, quite a few clinicians 
remain skeptical about their use.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our objective was to evaluate the risk of thromboembolism, 
stroke, neuropsychiatric illness, depression, and dementia, in patients with 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation who have been treated with either acenocumarol 
or apixaban, as well as to see the inflammatory status (ESR) and levels of 
fibrinogen. Our team at Municipal Emergency University Hospital, Timisoara, 
Romania, conducted a retrospective study using the medical records of AF 
patients who were treated with either apixaban or acenocumarol between 
2016-2019. We divided the patients into two groups and compared the groups for 
the aforementioned outcomes.
RESULTS: AF patients who were prescribed apixaban had a lower rate of stroke and 
psychiatric illness compared to those on acenocumarol. No significant 
correlation was found in terms of risk of developing depression or dementia 
between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-valvular AF patients on apixaban had lower rates of 
thromboembolic events than the patients on acenocumarol. This article will serve 
as a reminder of the positive health and financial outcomes of apixaban use, 
especially to those healthcare systems that are still oblivious to the decrease 
in economic burden and gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALY) by the 
long-term use of NOACS/ DOACS instead of the AVK anticoagulants.

OBJECTIVES: Incidence and prevalence of patients in dialytic therapy increased 
considerably in recent years. The onset of new issues, once overshadowed, linked 
to a lower quality of life like sexual dysfunction became increasingly common. 
The first study in this area, dating back to the 1970s, shows the high 
prevalence of sexual dysfunction among patients in dialytic therapy of both 
sexes. Later studies proved an association of sexual dysfunction with psyche 
disorders, anxiety, depression and lack of self-confidence. The aim of this 
study is to describe the incidence of male and female sexual main dysfunctions, 
the latter not least in literature, in patients in hemodialytic therapy. With 
this aim two dialytic centers have been compared, one located in northern Italy 
and one in southern Italy, and the different prevalence has been compared to the 
general population.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional observational study in 
patients undergoing dialytic therapy in two hemodialysis centers, one located in 
Palermo and one in Lecco. Male sexual dysfunction was investigated by the 
International Index of Erectile Function-15 (IIEF15) questionnaire and the 
Premature Ejaculation Diagnotic Tool (PEDT) questionnaire, and the female 
dysfunction by Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire. Criteria for 
inclusion in our study were: age < 75 years and dialytic age > 3 months; 
exclusion criteria were: advanced cancer diseases, life expectancy < 6 months, 
previous urological manipulation, anti-androgenic therapy, sexual dysfunction 
unrelated to kidney disease, psychiatric disorders. Data were compared with 
mean-standard deviation (SD) and with the variance analysis (ANOVA). A value of 
p < 0.05 is considered significant. Discrete data were analyzed with contingency 
analysis. A chi2 < 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Data of 78 patients have been collected. Mean age and dialytic time 
were 54 ± 12 years and 42 ± 35 month; 33 patients were from Palermo and 24 from 
Lecco; 21 patients were excluded. Age and dialytic age of the two subgroups did 
not demonstrate statistically significant differences. Between the two centers 
there was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.005) in the distribution 
of basic nephropathy: an higher incidence of diabetic and obstructive 
nephropathy has been observed in the southern center compared to northern 
center, while glomerulonephritis and polycystic kidney disease had an higher 
incidence in the northern center compared to southern one. The main sexual 
dysfunctions in both sexes, erectile dysfunction (ED) and premature ejaculation 
(PE) in men and orgasm disorder and pelvic pain in women, have been 
investigated. ED was present in 70%  of hemodialyzed patients, which is an 
higher incidence compared to the general population. The severity of ED between 
patients of the two groups was significantly different (chi2 < 0.001) with 
higher incidence of moderate/severe forms in northern Italy. The score, in 
addition to discrete data (severe, moderate, mild, absence), of ED was 
significantly different (p < 0.001) between patients of the two centers (22 ± 7 
Palermo vs. 9 ± 8, Lecco). The PE was absent in 20 patients (54%), present in 12 
patients (32%) and probable in 5 patients (14%) (scores of 7.6 ± 4.0 and 8.9 ± 
6.8, respectively in Palermo and Lecco patients). For women, orgasmic 
dysfunction was severe in 10 patients (50%), mild in 4 patients (20%), very mild 
in 5 patients (25%), while it was normal in 1 patient (5%), with a statistically 
significant difference (p< 0.05) between Palermo and Lecco patients (3.0 ± 1.4 
vs 1.2 ± 2.0). Sexual pain in women was severe in 11 patients (55%), moderate in 
4 patients (20%) and mild in 5 patients (25%). Sexual pain was present in all 
patients (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of sex, sexual dysfunction is one of the most common 
side effect in patients with end stage renal disease in dialytic therapy. Our 
study confirms literature data. The growing number of the dialytic population 
with sexual disorders needs specialist support to improve quality of life of 
these patients.

Human malignant gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumor. 
Composed of glial cells and their precursors, they are aggressive and highly 
invasive, leading to a poor prognosis. Due to the difficulty of surgically 
removing tumors and their resistance to treatments, novel therapeutic approaches 
are needed to improve patient life expectancy and comfort. Drosophila 
melanogaster is a compelling genetic model to better understanding human 
neurological diseases owing to its high conservation in signaling pathways and 
cellular content of the brain. Here, glioma has been induced in Drosophila by 
co-activating the epidermal growth factor receptor and the 
phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase signaling pathways. Complementary nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques were used to obtain metabolic profiles in 
the third instar larvae brains. Fresh organs were directly studied by 1H high 
resolution-magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) NMR, and brain extracts were analyzed 
by solution-state 1H-NMR. Statistical analyses revealed differential metabolic 
signatures, impacted metabolic pathways, and glioma biomarkers. Each method was 
efficient to determine biomarkers. The highlighted metabolites including 
glucose, myo-inositol, sarcosine, glycine, alanine, and pyruvate for 
solution-state NMR and proline, myo-inositol, acetate, and glucose for HR-MAS 
show very good performances in discriminating samples according to their nature 
with data mining based on receiver operating characteristic curves. Combining 
results allows for a more complete view of induced disturbances and opens the 
possibility of deciphering the biochemical mechanisms of these tumors. The 
identified biomarkers provide a means to rebalance specific pathways through 
targeted metabolic therapy and to study the effects of pharmacological 
treatments using Drosophila as a model organism.

Aim: Many economic evaluations used linear or log-transformed additive methods 
to estimate the disutility of hypoglycemic events in diabetes, both nonsevere 
(NSHEs) and severe (SHEs). Methods: We conducted a literature search for studies 
of disutility for hypoglycemia. We used additive, minimum and multiplicative 
methods, and the adjusted decrement estimator to estimate the disutilities of 
joint health states with both NSHEs and SHEs in six scenarios. Results: 
Twenty-four studies reported disutilities for hypoglycemia in diabetes. Based on 
construct validity, the adjusted decrement estimator method likely provides less 
biased estimates, predicting that when SHEs occur, the additional impact from 
NSHEs is marginal. Conclusion: Our proposed new method provides a different 
perspective on the estimation of quality-adjusted life-years in economic 
evaluations of hypoglycemic treatments.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death and a main economic 
burden in China. Investigating the differences in cancer patterns and control 
strategies between China and developed countries could provide reference for 
policy planning and contribute to improving cancer control measures. In this 
study, we reviewed the rates and trends of cancer incidence and mortality and 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) burden in China, and compared them with 
those in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK).
METHODS: Cancer incidence, mortality, and DALY data for China, US and UK were 
obtained from the GLOBOCAN 2020 online database, Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
2019 study, and Cancer Incidence in Five Continents plus database (CI5 plus). 
Trends of cancer incidence and mortality in China, US, and UK were analyzed 
using Joinpoint regression models to calculate annual percent changes (APCs) and 
identify the best-fitting joinpoints.
RESULTS: An estimated 4,568,754 newly diagnosed cancer cases and 3,002,899 
cancer deaths occurred in China in 2020. Additionally, cancers resulted in 
67,340,309 DALYs in China. Compared to the US and UK, China had lower cancer 
incidence but higher cancer mortality and DALY rates. Furthermore, the cancer 
spectrum of China was changing, with a rapid increase incidence and burden of 
lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer in addition to a high incidence 
and heavy burden of liver, stomach, esophageal, and cervical cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The cancer spectrum of China is changing from a developing country 
to a developed country. Population aging and increase of unhealthy lifestyles 
would continue to increase the cancer burden of China. Therefore, the Chinese 
authorities should adjust the national cancer control program with reference to 
the practices of cancer control which have been well-established in the 
developed countries, and taking consideration of the diversity of cancer types 
by of different regions in China at the same time.

BACKGROUND: Operative and nonoperative treatments for spinal metastases are 
expensive interventions with a high rate of complications. We sought to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of a surgical procedure compared with 
nonoperative management as treatment for spinal metastases.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model with health states 
defined by ambulatory status and estimated the quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) and costs for operative and nonoperative management of spine metastases. 
We considered 2 populations: 1 in which patients presented with independent 
ambulatory status and 1 in which patients presented with nonambulatory status 
due to acute (e.g., <48 hours) metastatic epidural compression. We defined the 
efficacy of each treatment as a likelihood of maintaining, or returning to, 
independent ambulation. Transition probabilities for the model, including the 
risks of mortality and becoming dependent or nonambulatory, were obtained from 
secondary data analysis and published literature. Costs were determined from 
Medicare reimbursement schedules. We conducted analyses over patients' remaining 
life expectancy from a health system perspective and discounted outcomes at 3% 
per year. We conducted sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in data 
inputs.
RESULTS: Among patients presenting as independently ambulatory, QALYs were 0.823 
for operative treatment and 0.800 for nonoperative treatment. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for a surgical procedure was $899,700 per QALY. 
Among patients presenting with nonambulatory status, those undergoing surgical 
intervention accumulated 0.813 lifetime QALY, and those treated nonoperatively 
accumulated 0.089 lifetime QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a 
surgical procedure was $48,600 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness of a surgical 
procedure was most sensitive to the variability of its efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the value to society of a surgical procedure 
for spinal metastases varies according to the features of the patient 
population. In patients presenting as nonambulatory due to acute neurologic 
compromise, surgical intervention provides good value (ICER, $48,600 per QALY). 
There is a low value for a surgical procedure performed for patients who are 
ambulatory at presentation (ICER, $899,700 per QALY).

Cancer, one of the major public health problems in the world, threatens human 
health seriously, and the burden of disease is heavy. Disability adjusted life 
years (DALYs) have been increasingly used to estimate the burden of disease 
worldwide. Disability weights is a key ingredient for estimating DALYs, and its 
value directly affects the calculation of disease burden. In this review, we 
summarize the research methods, key issues, and progress on disability weights 
for cancer both domestic and abroad, in order to provide valuable information 
for the estimation of cancer disability weights in China.

Avapritinib for Systemic Mastocytosis.

Bose P(1), Verstovsek S(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 
Houston, TX, USA.

INTRODUCTION: Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a rare myeloid neoplasm driven in 
≈95% of cases by activating KIT mutations, usually D816V. SM can be indolent 
(ISM), smoldering (SSM) and advanced (AdvSM), the latter characterized by organ 
damage resulting from infiltrating neoplastic mast cells. The vast majority of 
cases are indolent, with near-normal life expectancy, although symptoms can be 
severe. AdvSM, comprising aggressive SM, SM with an associated hematologic 
neoplasm and mast cell leukemia, however, carries a poor prognosis. Avapritinib 
is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of mutant KIT.
AREAS COVERED: We provide an overview of SM, including the current therapeutic 
landscape, and discuss avapritinib in detail: its chemistry and discovery, 
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data, current approval status and safety and 
efficacy profiles in both advanced and non-advanced SM.
EXPERT OPINION: With a response rate of 75% amongst evaluable patients with 
AdvSM and marked reductions observed in measures of mast cell and disease 
burden, avapritinib stands out as a highly effective targeted therapy for this 
mutant KIT-driven disease. Cognitive impairment may occur, and intracranial 
hemorrhage has been reported, particularly in association with severe 
thrombocytopenia. Early results in patients with ISM/SSM are encouraging. 
Avapritinib is now approved in the US for AdvSM.

PURPOSE: The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, in collaboration 
with St. John Providence Health System, initiated voluntary school-wide sexually 
transmitted disease (STD) screenings in four Detroit public high schools. We 
sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of the STD screening program from 2010 
to 2015, with a focus on chlamydia.
METHODS: The costs and effectiveness of the school-based screening were compared 
with those of a "no school screening" scenario using a healthcare system 
perspective. A decision tree model was constructed to project cases of
