BACKGROUND: The epidemiological transition of non-communicable diseases 
replacing infectious diseases as the main contributors to disease burden has 
been well documented in global health literature. Less focus, however, has been 
given to the relationship between sociodemographic changes and injury. The aim 
of this study was to examine the association between disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) from injury for 195 countries and territories at different levels 
along the development spectrum between 1990 and 2017 based on the Global Burden 
of Disease (GBD) 2017 estimates.
METHODS: Injury mortality was estimated using the GBD mortality database, 
corrections for garbage coding and CODEm-the cause of death ensemble modelling 
tool. Morbidity estimation was based on surveys and inpatient and outpatient 
data sets for 30 cause-of-injury with 47 nature-of-injury categories each. The 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI) is a composite indicator that includes lagged 
income per capita, average educational attainment over age 15 years and total 
fertility rate.
RESULTS: For many causes of injury, age-standardised DALY rates declined with 
increasing SDI, although road injury, interpersonal violence and self-harm did 
not follow this pattern. Particularly for self-harm opposing patterns were 
observed in regions with similar SDI levels. For road injuries, this effect was 
less pronounced.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall global pattern is that of declining injury burden with 
increasing SDI. However, not all injuries follow this pattern, which suggests 
multiple underlying mechanisms influencing injury DALYs. There is a need for a 
detailed understanding of these patterns to help to inform national and global 
efforts to address injury-related health outcomes across the development 
spectrum.

BACKGROUND: The global burden of road injuries is known to follow complex 
geographical, temporal and demographic patterns. While health loss from road 
injuries is a major topic of global importance, there has been no recent 
comprehensive assessment that includes estimates for every age group, sex and 
country over recent years.
METHODS: We used results from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 study to 
report incidence, prevalence, years lived with disability, deaths, years of life 
lost and disability-adjusted life years for all locations in the GBD 2017 
hierarchy from 1990 to 2017 for road injuries. Second, we measured 
mortality-to-incidence ratios by location. Third, we assessed the distribution 
of the natures of injury (eg, traumatic brain injury) that result from each road 
injury.
RESULTS: Globally, 1 243 068 (95% uncertainty interval 1 191 889 to 1 276 940) 
people died from road injuries in 2017 out of 54 192 330 (47 381 583 to 61 645 
891) new cases of road injuries. Age-standardised incidence rates of road 
injuries increased between 1990 and 2017, while mortality rates decreased. 
Regionally, age-standardised mortality rates decreased in all but two regions, 
South Asia and Southern Latin America, where rates did not change significantly. 
Nine of 21 GBD regions experienced significant increases in age-standardised 
incidence rates, while 10 experienced significant decreases and two experienced 
no significant change.
CONCLUSIONS: While road injury mortality has improved in recent decades, there 
are worsening rates of incidence and significant geographical heterogeneity. 
These findings indicate that more research is needed to better understand how 
road injuries can be prevented.

Apis mellifera scutellata and Apis mellifera capensis, two native subspecies of 
western honey bees in the Republic of South Africa (RSA), are important to 
beekeepers in their native region because beekeepers use these bees for honey 
production and pollination purposes. Additionally, both bees are important 
invasive pests outside of their native ranges. Recently, whole mitogenome 
sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphisms were used to study their genetic 
diversity. To add to our knowledge of the molecular ecology of both bees, we 
tested the ability of microsatellites to be used as a tool to discriminate 
between A.m. capensis and A.m. scutellata. We analyzed the genetic variability 
and overall population structure of both bee subspecies and hybrids of the two 
by genotyping individuals collected from RSA (N = 813 bees from 75 apiaries) at 
19 microsatellite DNA loci. Overall, populations averaged between 9.2 and 11.3 
alleles per locus, with unbiased heterozygosity values ranging from 0.81 to 0.86 
per population. Bayesian clustering analyses revealed two distinct evolutionary 
units, though the results did not match those of earlier morphometric and 
molecular analyses. This suggests that the microsatellites we tested were not 
sufficient for subspecies identification purposes, especially for Cape and 
hybrid bees. Nevertheless, the microsatellite data highlight the considerable 
genetic diversity within both populations and a larger-than-expected 
hybridization zone between the natural distributions of A.m. capensis and A.m. 
scutellata.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common chronic disease affecting humans globally. 
During the last few years, the incidence of diabetes has increased and has 
received more attention. In addition to growing DM populations, DM complications 
are involving injuries to more organs, such as the heart and cerebral vessel 
damage. DM complications can reduce quality of life and shorten life spans and 
eventually also impede social and economic development. Therefore, effective 
measures to curb the occurrence and development of diabetes assist in improving 
patients' quality of life, delay the progression of DM in the population, and 
ease a social burden. The liver is regarded as an important link in the 
management and control of DM, including the alleviation of glucose metabolism 
and lipid metabolism and others via glucose storage and endogenous glucose 
generation from glycogen stored in the liver. Liver cirrhosis is a very common 
chronic disease, which often lowers the quality of life and decreases life 
expectancy. According to a growing body of research, diabetes shows a close 
correlation with hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Moreover, 
coexistence of liver complications would accelerate the deterioration of 
patients with diabetes. Liver cirrhosis and diabetes influence each other. Thus, 
in addition to pharmacological treatments and lifestyle interventions, effective 
control of cirrhosis might assist in a better management of diabetes. When it 
comes to different etiologies of liver cirrhosis, different therapeutic methods, 
such as antiviral treatment, may be more effective. Effective control of 
cirrhosis might be a strategy for better management of diabetes.

To study dietary pH effects on Lymantria dispar asiatica larvae and provide a 
theoretical basis for its control in different forests, phosphate buffers (PBs) 
of pH 6, 7, and 8 were used to prepare experimental diets. The diet prepared 
with pH 6 PB was named as DPB6, with pH 8 PB as DPB8, and with pH 7 PB as DPB7 
(control). The dietary pH was 5.00 in DPB6, 6.05 in control, and 6.50 in DPB8. 
After feeding on the diets with different pH values for 84 hr, fourth-instar 
caterpillars were randomly collected. Growth and various physiological traits 
were determined and 16S recombinant DNA sequencing was performed using the 
intestinal microflora of surviving larvae. Results showed that the mortality was 
30% in DPB6, and 10% in DPB8, while no mortality was observed in control. The 
partial least squares discriminant analyses suggested that diets prepared with 
PB of different pH resulted in different food intake, amount of produced feces, 
weight gain, digestive enzyme activities, and antioxidant enzyme activities in 
larvae. Interestingly, both the highest weight gain and the lowest total 
antioxidant capacities were seen in control larvae. Results also showed that the 
larval gut microbiota community structure was significantly affected by dietary 
pH. Moreover, linear discriminant analysis effect size suggested that the family 
Acetobacteraceae in control, genus Prevotella in DPB8, and genus Lactococcus, 
family Flavobacteriaceae, family Mitochondria, and family Burkholderiaceae in 
DPB6 contributed to the diversity of the larval gut microbial community.

Cost-effectiveness of Intravitreal Ranibizumab With Verteporfin Photodynamic 
Therapy Compared With Ranibizumab Monotherapy for Patients With Polypoidal 
Choroidal Vasculopathy.

Medical School, Singapore.

IMPORTANCE: The EVEREST II trial showed that for patients with polypoidal 
choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), intravitreal ranibizumab in combination with 
verteporfin photodynamic therapy improves visual acuity relative to ranibizumab 
monotherapy. However, whether combination therapy is incrementally 
cost-effective relative to monotherapy during a lifetime is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of combination therapy 
compared with ranibizumab monotherapy in patients with PCV.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This model-based, economic evaluation used 
2018 unit cost data from a tertiary eye hospital in Singapore, first- and 
second-year outcomes and resource use data from a multicenter trial across 
various Asian countries (EVEREST II) to model a hypothetical cohort of patients 
with symptomatic PCV. Scenario analyses and deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed to examine uncertainty. Data were collected 
from October 2018 through April 2019 and analyzed from March through October 
2019.
INTERVENTIONS: This model used data from the EVEREST II trial, in which all 
participants were given 0.5 mg of intravitreal ranibizumab once every 4 weeks 
for the first 3 months. Subsequent administration occurred as needed. For 
participants receiving combination therapy, standard fluence (50 J/cm3) 
photodynamic therapy with 6-mg/m2 verteporfin was administered once during the 
first 3 months and thereafter as needed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained for combination therapy relative to monotherapy for patients with 
PCV.
RESULTS: In this model based on a cohort of 1000 patients aged 68 years, a 
patient with PCV incurred a total cost in Singapore dollars (SGD) of 92 327 (US 
$67 399) with combination therapy and SGD 92 371 (US $67 431) with monotherapy 
during a lifetime horizon, generating a modest cost savings of SGD 44 (US $32) 
per patient undergoing combination therapy. Lifetime QALYs were estimated to be 
7.87 for combination therapy and 7.85 for monotherapy, for an incremental gain 
of 0.02 QALYs. Combination therapy remained cost-saving or cost-effective in all 
lifetime scenarios modeled, but during shorter time horizons and at lower 
monotherapy costs, it may not be cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found combination therapy to be a dominant 
(more effective and less costly) strategy, being similar in costs and slightly 
more effective than ranibizumab monotherapy during a lifetime horizon. However, 
decreasing the time horizon to less than 10 years and/or reductions in the cost 
of monotherapy may result in combination therapy no longer being cost-effective.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs, health gains, and cost-effectiveness of 
operative versus nonoperative treatment of calcaneal fractures over a 5-year 
time horizon from both US societal and payer perspectives.
METHODS: The societal perspective analysis included both direct medical costs 
and costs for missed work, whereas the health care payer perspective analysis 
included only direct medical costs associated with treatment and complications. 
A decision tree simulation model was developed to estimate the direct medical 
and indirect costs (2018 US$) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for 
treatment of patients sustaining intra-articular calcaneal fractures fixed with 
an extensile lateral approach. Direct medical costs were obtained from a large 
US health care system in Utah, Intermountain Healthcare, and indirect costs from 
the literature. Utility and probability parameters were also derived from the 
literature. Parameter uncertainty was explored using both one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: From a US societal perspective, operative treatment costs less ($35,110 
vs. $39,870) and yielded more QALYs (3.89 vs. 3.51) over 5 years compared with 
nonoperative treatment. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY, 
operative fixation had an 89% probability of being cost-effective. From a health 
care payer perspective, operative management remained cost-effective as the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is below the willingness-to-pay threshold 
of $50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: From both US societal and health care payer perspectives, operative 
treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures utilizing an 
extensile lateral approach is cost-effective at commonly accepted 
willingness-to-pay thresholds compared with nonoperative treatment over a 5-year 
time horizon. Patient variability may impact cost-effectiveness and should be 
explored in future research.

University Hospital, Jeju, Korea.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate functional outcomes after the application of a 
critical pathway for inpatient rehabilitation of total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: A total of 184 patients (57 males and 127 females; average age, 
71.5±5.9 years) who underwent unilateral or bilateral TKA were included. The 
critical pathway included early, intensive individualized rehabilitation 
exercises. Patients completed the following performance-based physical function 
tests: the stair climbing test (SCT), 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and Timed Up 
and Go test (TUG) as well as measurement of isometric knee flexor and extensor 
strength of the operated knee, gait speed, and range of knee flexion and 
extension. Self-reported physical function and pain were measured using the 
Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and visual 
analog scale (VAS), respectively, and self-reported quality of life was measured 
using the EuroQoL 5 dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire. These evaluations were 
performed preoperatively and at 1 month and 3 months postoperatively.
