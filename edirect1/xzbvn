of life (QOL) for survivors' after CPR and the influence cognitive impairment, 
anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has had on their 
QOL.
REVIEW METHODS: This review follows Whittemore and Knafl's framework for an 
integrative literature review. Electronic databases EBSCO, Ovid, PubMed and 
EMBASE were searched. After application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
thirty-six papers published from January 2000 to June 2015 were included in this 
review.
RESULTS: These papers represent a broad spectrum of research evaluating quality 
of life for survivors of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The heterogeneous 
research methods and vast number of different research tools make it challenging 
to compare the findings. The majority of papers concluded that quality of life 
for survivors of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was generally 
acceptable. However, studies also described survivors' experience of anxiety, 
depression, post-traumatic stress and cognitive dysfunction.
CONCLUSION: A majority of papers reported an acceptable quality of life if the 
patient survived to hospital discharge. The heterogeneity in quantitative papers 
was noticeable and indicates a marked variance in patient outcomes. This review 
highlights the absence of specialized tools used to investigate survivors' 
experience of the event. Further exploration of the impact cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation has on the individual may improve ongoing rehabilitation and 
quality of life levels for survivors.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) 
compared to medical therapy for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with 
and without nasal polyposis (NP).
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort-style Markov decision-tree economic model with a 36-year 
time horizon.
METHODS: Two cohorts of 229 CRS patients with and without NP who underwent ESS 
were compared with a matched cohort of 229 CRS patients from the Medical 
Expenditures Survey Panel database (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 
Rockville, MD) who underwent medical management. Utility scores were calculated 
from sequential patient responses to the EuroQol five-dimensions questionnaire. 
Decision-tree analysis and a 10-state Markov model utilized published event 
probabilities and primary data to calculate long-term costs and utility. The 
primary outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). 
Thorough sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The reference case for CRS with NP yielded an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for ESS versus medical therapy of 
$5,687.41/QALY. The reference case for CRS without NP yielded an ICER of 
$5,405.44/QALY. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve in both cases 
demonstrated 95% certainty that the ESS strategy was the most cost-effective 
option at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $20,000/QALY or higher. These 
results were robust to one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of ESS compared to 
medical therapy alone for the management of CRS patients both with and without 
NP. The presence of nasal polyps was not found to affect the overall 
cost-effectiveness of ESS.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-utility of the internet-based intervention 
"Featback" provided with different levels of therapist support, in comparison to 
a waiting list.
METHOD: This economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective and 
was part of a randomized controlled trial in which participants (N = 354) with 
self-reported ED symptoms were randomized to: (1) 8 weeks of Featback, 
consisting of psychoeducation and a fully automated monitoring- and feedback 
system, (2) Featback with low-intensity (weekly) therapist support, (3) Featback 
with high-intensity (three times a week) therapist support, and (4) a waiting 
list. Participants were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 3-month 
follow-up. Cost-utility acceptability curves were constructed.
RESULTS: No significant differences between the study conditions were found 
regarding quality-adjusted life-years (P = 0.55) and societal costs (P = 0.45), 
although the mean costs per participant were lowest in the Featback condition 
with low-intensity therapist support (€1951), followed by Featback with 
high-intensity therapist support (€2032), Featback without therapist support 
(€2102), and the waiting list (€2582). Featback seemed to be cost-effective as 
compared to the waiting list. No clear preference was found for Featback with or 
without therapist support.
DISCUSSION: A fully automated Internet-based intervention for ED symptoms with 
no, low-, or high-intensity therapist support represented good value for money 
when compared to a waiting list. This finding may have important implications 
for clinical practice, as both the unguided- and guided intervention could allow 
for more efficient care and widespread dissemination, potentially increasing the 
accessibility and availability of mental health care services for individuals 
with ED symptoms. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (Int J Eat Disord 2016;

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating illness associated with 
considerable impairment of quality of life and substantial costs to health care 
systems. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established surgical treatment 
option for some patients with advanced PD. The EARLYSTIM trial has recently 
demonstrated its clinical benefit also in patients with early motor 
complications. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DBS, compared to 
best medical therapy (BMT), among PD patients with early onset of motor 
complications, from a United Kingdom (UK) payer perspective.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to represent the progression of PD as rated 
using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) over time in patients 
with early PD. Evidence sources were a systematic review of clinical evidence; 
data from the EARLYSTIM study; and a UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink 
(CPRD) dataset including DBS patients. A mapping algorithm was developed to 
generate utility values based on UPDRS data for each intervention. The 
cost-effectiveness was expressed as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken 
to explore the effect of parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: Over a 15-year time horizon, DBS was predicted to lead to additional 
mean cost per patient of £26,799 compared with BMT (£73,077/patient versus 
£46,278/patient) and an additional mean 1.35 QALYs (6.69 QALYs versus 5.35 
QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £19,887 per QALY 
gained with a 99% probability of DBS being cost-effective at a threshold of 
£30,000/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses suggested that the results were not 
significantly impacted by plausible changes in the input parameter values.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that DBS is a cost-effective intervention in 
PD patients with early motor complications when compared with existing 
interventions, offering additional health benefits at acceptable incremental 
cost. This supports the extended use of DBS among patients with early onset of 
motor complications.

Late pregnancy - a clue to prolonging life?

Ferraz T(1), Matias A(1).

Author information:
(1).

The relation between fertility and longevity has always been a subject of study 
and controversy. Indeed, life expectancy extension is found to be tied to late 
births. This conclusion can be drawn from social-observational studies like the 
Long Life Family Study in New England and the New England Centenarian Study on 
which was found that women whose last birth was after 40 years of age are more 
likely to live longer. Recently, a group in Israel published a review on animal 
and human studies that shed some understanding on the cellular mechanisms behind 
the association between pregnancy and tissue regeneration and repair. These 
studies shed some understanding to draw biological plausibility on the 
association between late pregnancy and life expectancy.

Life-Time Risk, Screening and The Cost of Cardiovascular Comorbidities in CKD 
Patients.

Zoccali C, Abd ElHafeez S, Dounousi E, Anastasi R, Tripepi G, Mallamaci F.

CKD is a problem of epidemic dimension. The risk of death and cardiovascular 
complications in this condition is of the same order of that by myocardial 
infarction, which qualifies CKD as "risk equivalent". Calculations made on the 
basis of the epidemiological data of the MONICA-Augsburg study and analyses of 
the costs of myocardial infarction in a large health insurance company in 
Germany show that the economic burden of cardiovascular comorbidities with CKD 
in this country is substantial. These estimates, which may be valid also for 
other large member states of the European Community, represent a call for 
studies looking at the cost-effectiveness of preventive interventions aimed at 
reducing the risk for CKD and at lowering the concerning incidence rate of death 
and disability due to CKD-triggered cardiovascular complications in CKD 
patients.

INTRODUCTION: The Croatian Association for Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders of 
the Croatian Medical Association has issued in 2011 the first national 
guidelines for the nutrition, education, self-control, and pharmacotherapy of 
diabetes type 2. According to the increased number of available medicines and 
new evidence related to the effectiveness and safety of medicines already 
involved in the therapy there was a need for update of the existing guidelines 
for the pharmacotherapy of type 2 diabetes in the Republic of Croatia.
PARTICIPANTS: as co-authors of the Guidelines there are listed all members of 
the Croatian Association for Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, as well as other 
representatives of professional societies within the Croatian Medical 
Association, who have contributed with comments and suggestions to the 
development of the Guidelines.
EVIDENCE: These guidelines are evidence-based, according to the GRADE system 
(eng. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation), which 
describes the level of evidence and strength of recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: An individual patient approach based on physiological principles in 
blood glucose control is essential for diabetes' patients management. Glycemic 
targets and selection of the pharmacological agents should be tailored to the 
patient, taking into account the age, duration of disease, life expectancy, risk 
of hypoglyce- mia, comorbidities, developed vascular and other complications as 
well as other factors. Because of all this, is of national interest to have a 
practical, rational and applicable guidelines for the pharmacotherapy of type 2 
diabetes.

Human life expectancy has increased dramatically in the last century and as a 
result also the prevalence of a variety of age-related diseases and syndromes. 
One such syndrome is frailty, which is defined as a combination of organ 
dysfunctions leading to increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. In 
humans, frailty is associated with various biomarkers of ageing and predicts 
relevant outcomes such as responses to therapies and progression of health 
status and mortality. Moreover, it is relatively easy to assess. To foster 
translation of mechanistic understanding of the ageing process and, importantly, 
of interventions that may extend healthy lifespan, frailty scales have been 
reverse translated into mice in recent years. We will review these approaches 
with a view to identify what is known and what is not known at present about 
their validity, reproducibility and reliability with a focus on the potential 
for further improvement.

Improving the physical health of people with severe mental illness in a low 
secure forensic unit: An uncontrolled evaluation study of staff training and 
physical health care plans.

The life expectancy of people with severe mental illnesses is substantially 
reduced, and monitoring and screening for physical health problems is a key part 
of addressing this health inequality. Inpatient admission presents a window of 
opportunity for this health-care activity. The present study was conducted in a 
forensic mental health unit in England. A personal physical health plan 
incorporating clearly-presented and easily-understood values and targets for 
health status in different domains was developed. Alongside this, a brief 
physical education session was delivered to health-care staff (n = 63). Printed 
learning materials and pedometers and paper tape measures were also provided. 
The impact was evaluated by a single-group pretest post-test design; follow-up 
measures were 4 months' post-intervention. The feasibility and acceptability of 
personal health plans and associated resources were examined by free-text 
questionnaire responses. Fifty-seven staff provided measures of attitudes and 
knowledge before training and implementation of the physical health plans. 
Matched-pairs analysis indicated a modest but statistically-significant 
improvement in staff knowledge scores and attitudes to involvement in physical 
health care. Qualitative feedback indicated limited uptake of the care plans and 
perceived need for additional support for better adoption of this initiative. 
Inpatient admission is a key setting for assessing physical health and promoting 
improved management of health problems. Staff training and purpose-designed 
personalized care plans hold potential to improve practice and outcomes in this 
area, but further support for such innovations appears necessary for their 
uptake in inpatient mental health settings.

BACKGROUND: Despite the high burden of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in 
sub-Saharan Africa, absence of widespread screening and poor access to treatment 
leads to most people remaining undiagnosed until later stages of disease when 
prognosis is poor and treatment options are limited. We examined the 
cost-effectiveness of community-based screening and early treatment with 
antiviral therapy for HBV in The Gambia.
METHODS: In this economic evaluation, we combined a decision tree with a Markov 
state transition model to compare a screen and treat intervention consisting of 
adult community-based screening using a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) 
rapid test and subsequent HBV antiviral therapy versus current practice, in 
which there is an absence of publicly provided screening or treatment for HBV. 
We used data from the PROLIFICA study to parameterise epidemiological, primary 
screening, and cost information, and other model parameter inputs were obtained 
from a literature search. Outcome measures were cost per disability-adjusted 
life-year (DALY) averted; cost per life-year saved; and cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We calculated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between current practice and the screen and 
treat intervention. Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective. 
Costs (expressed in 2013 US$) and health outcomes were discounted at 3% per 
year.
FINDINGS: In The Gambia, where the prevalence of HBsAg is 8·8% in people older 
than 30 years, adult screening and treatment for HBV has an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $540 per DALY averted, $645 per life-year 
saved, and $511 per QALY gained, compared with current practice. These ICERs are 
in line with willingness-to-pay levels of one times the country's gross domestic 
product per capita ($487) per DALY averted, and remain robust over a wide range 
of epidemiological and cost parameter inputs.
INTERPRETATION: Adult community-based screening and treatment for HBV in The 
Gambia is likely to be a cost-effective intervention. Higher cost-effectiveness 
might be achievable with targeted facility-based screening, price reductions of 
drugs and diagnostics, and integration of HBV screening with other public health 
interventions.

BACKGROUND: In a patient population with a limited life expectancy, malignant 
pleural effusion can significantly impact quality of life (QoL). Different 
treatment options are available, each with its own effect on QoL. To date, 
satisfaction with treatment options has not been evaluated.
PURPOSE: To evaluate QoL and satisfaction with treatment using patient-reported 
outcomes for four different treatment strategies.
DESIGN: A prospective, cohort study that compared four treatment options: 
indwelling pleural catheter (IPC); video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and 
IPC; chest tube and talc slurry; and VATS talc poudrage.
SETTING: A total of 104 participants were treated across four acute care 
teaching hospitals in a large Canadian city.
MEASUREMENTS: Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using functional 
assessment of chronic illness therapy-palliative (FACIT-PAL), London Chest 
Activity of Daily Living scale and FACIT-treatment satisfaction questionnaires.
RESULTS: No significant difference was identified between the four treatments 
based on patient-reported outcomes. VATS talc poudrage provided the most durable 
improvement. At the 6-week post-treatment time point, the highest patient 
satisfaction was noted in patients who received VATS and talc pleurodesis, 
lowest satisfaction in patients with chest tube and talc pleurodesis; however, 
the differences were not statistically significant (p=0.20). VATS and talc 
pleurodesis had the highest scores at 6 weeks for recommendation of treatment to 
others; however, the comparison with other treatment groups was not 
statistically significant (p=0.22). For FACIT-PAL, total scores when analysed as 
one group, there was a statistically significant increasing trend (indicating 
improvement) (p<0.0001). Breathlessness, measured using the London Chest 
Activity of Daily Living scale, indicated a statistically decreasing trend, 
suggesting an improvement (p=0.0003). There was no statistically significant 
difference in trends over time between the four treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS: While all treatment options addressed the patients' symptoms and 
relieved dyspnoea, an IPC offered effective treatment with minimal discomfort 
and time in hospital yet still high satisfaction.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have dramatically improved the life expectancy 
of patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); however, patients 
will eventually develop resistance to TKI therapy or adverse side effects due to 
secondary off-target mechanisms associated with TKIs. CML patients exhibiting 
TKI resistance are at greater risk of developing an aggressive and 
drug-insensitive disease. Drug-resistant CML typically arises in response to 
spontaneous mutations within the drug binding sites of the targeted 
oncoproteins. To better understand the mechanism of drug resistance in 
TKI-resistant CML patients, the BCR-ABL transformed cell line KCL22 was grown 
with increasing concentrations of imatinib for a period of 6 weeks. 
Subsequently, a drug-resistant derivative of the parental KCL22 cell line 
harboring the T315I gatekeeper mutation was isolated and investigated for TKI 
drug sensitivity via multi-agent drug screens. A synergistic combination of 
ponatinib- and forskolin-reduced cell viability was identified in this 
clinically relevant imatinib-resistant CML cell line, which also proved 
efficacious in other CML cell lines. In summary, this study provides new insight 
into the biological underpinnings of BCR-ABL-driven CML and potential rationale 
for investigating novel treatment strategies for patients with T315I CML.

Health Technology Assessment is increasingly used to evaluate the value of 
healthcare products and to prioritize resources; however, defining exactly what 
value is and how it should be measured remains a challenge. In this article, we 
report the results of a literature review, focusing on nine European countries, 
with the aim of investigating how value is defined from the perspective of 
different stakeholders, how definitions of value are used, and how value is 
incorporated into decision making. Only three articles were identified that 
presented definitions of value, and there was no single shared definition of 
value in healthcare, which appears to be a highly subjective concept. The 
majority of the countries investigated combine clinical assessment with economic 
evaluation to make reimbursement recommendations; the quality-adjusted life-year 
is the most commonly used measure of value but does not capture broader aspects 
of value that may be important to patients and healthcare systems. We describe 
the use of value-based pricing and multi-criteria decision analysis, two 
approaches to the incorporation of broader aspects of value into decision 
making. Overall, we have identified considerable variation in how a product's 
value is defined by different stakeholders. Although a universal understanding 
of value in healthcare is important, it is clear that current definitions are 
insufficient, potentially leading to inconsistent reimbursement decisions. 
Ultimately, the establishment of clearer policies for defining and measuring 
value in healthcare is needed, and is likely to lead to improvements in the 
consistency of decision making.

The impact of a belief in life after death on health-state preferences: True 
difference or artifact?

PURPOSE: In most religions, the preservation of one's own, God-given, life is 
considered obligatory, while the time trade-off method (TTO) forces one to 
voluntarily forego life years. We sought to verify how this conflict impacts 
TTO-results among the religious.
METHODS: We used the data from the only EQ-5D valuation in Poland (2008, 
three-level, 321 respondents, 23 states each)-a very religious, mostly Catholic 
country. We measured the religiosity with the belief in afterlife question on 
two levels: strong (definitely yes) and some (also rather yes), both about a 
third of the sample.
RESULTS: The religious more often are non-traders, unwilling to give up any time 
in exchange for quality of life: odds ratio (OR) equal to 1.97 (strong 
religiosity), OR 1.55 (some religiosity); and less often consider a state worse 
than death: OR 0.67 (strong), OR 0.81 (some). These associations are 
statistically significant ([Formula: see text]) and hold when controlling for 
possible demographic confounders. Strong religiosity abates the utility loss: in 
the additive approach by 0.14, in the multiplicative approach by the factor of 
2.1 (both [Formula: see text]), especially among the older. Removing the effect 
of religiosity from the value set reduces the utility by 0.05 on average.
CONCLUSION: The results may stem from a true difference in preferences or be a 
TTO-artifact and would vanish for other elicitation methods. Juxtaposing our 
findings with comments from respondents in other studies suggests the latter. 
Therefore, this Weltanschauung effect should be removed in cost-utility 
analysis.

INTRODUCTION: This study analyses the health status of patients diagnosed with 
diabetes mellitus (DM), their health related quality of life (HRQoL) and their 
use of healthcare resources in Spain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive analysis was conducted using the Spanish 
Health National Survey (ENSE, 2012), gathering data on those patients aged 15 
and over diagnosed with DM. Their health status, their HRQoL, and their use of 
healthcare resources were systematically compared with those of patients 
diagnosed with other chronic conditions (OCC), as well as a population without 
DM (non-DM).
RESULTS: Out of 21,007 subjects that took part, 7.4% were diagnosed with DM and 
59% with OCC conditions (mean age 65.6±14.2 years with DM, 51.3±18.1 years with 
OCC, and 45.7±18.2 years with non-DM). When compared to non-DM and OCC, DM was 
statistically significantly associated with higher frequencies of hypertension, 
hypercholesterolaemia, obesity, myocardial infraction, hospital admissions in 
the last year, and drug consumption, but with a lower number of visits to 
secondary healthcare. The mean quality adjusted life years (QALY) of patients 
with DM was 0.75 per year, significantly lower (P<.05) to that of individuals 
with OCC (0.89), and those without DM (0.92). The difference vs. non-DM remained 
statistically significant after adjusting for age, gender, and number of 
comorbidities (P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In Spain, DM is associated with a high comorbidity, involves a 
greater loss in HRQoL than those diagnosed with other chronic conditions as a 
whole, and generates a significant burden on the healthcare system.

BACKGROUND: Ethiopia constitutes approximately 1% of the world's population but 
it contributes to 7% of the world's HIV/AIDS cases. Malaria is the most 
important disease of humans in terms of mortality, morbidity, and long-term 
effects upon quality of life, especially in Ethiopia. Despite the ongoing 
efforts and progress in fighting HIV/AIDS and malaria, these diseases remain the 
leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the country. In this study, we 
assessed community knowledge and the role of health extension workers on 
integrated diseases among households in East Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community-based multistage stratified cross-sectional study was 
conducted from February to March 2014 among six woredas of the East Hararghe 
Zone, Ethiopia. The data were collected from 2,319 households using structured 
questionnaires. A total of 12 well trained data collectors conducted a 
face-to-face interview with the head female of each household. The data entered 
on Epi-Data version 3 were then exported for analysis on STATA version 11.
RESULTS: Multivariable logistic regression showed that among the 1,967 (92.7%) 
study participants who scored above the mean value in regard to the overall 
knowledge of HIV/AIDS, study participants who could read/write (adjusted odd 
ratios [AOR] =2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-5.61, P=0.021) and worked 
as a daily laborer (AOR =0.40, 95% CI: 0.17-0.91, P=0.029) were significantly 
associated with comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS. Meanwhile, out of the 
2,172 eligible study participants for the malaria interview, 934 (43%) scored 
above the mean in regard to the overall knowledge about malaria. Rural residents 
(AOR =0.27, 95% CI: 0.17-0.44, P<0.005), >45 years of age (AOR =1.44, 95% CI: 
1.04-1.99, P=0.030), and single marital status (AOR =3.81, 95% CI: 1.97-7.37, 
P<0.005) were significantly associated with comprehensive knowledge about 
malaria.
CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, health extension workers' 
number of monthly regular visits of each household was high, with the overall 
knowledge of study participants regarding malaria was unsatisfactory, unlike the 
overall knowledge of study participants regarding HIV/AIDS, which is very high.

A physically active lifestyle has been related to positive health outcomes and 
high life expectancy, but the underlying psychological mechanisms maintaining 
physical activity are rarely investigated. Tremendous technological progress 
yielding sophisticated methodological approaches, i.e., ambulatory assessment, 
have recently enabled the study of these mechanisms in everyday life. In 
practice, accelerometers allow to continuously and objectively monitor physical 
activity. The combination with e-diaries makes it feasible to repeatedly assess 
mood states in real-time and real life and to relate them to physical activity. 
This state-of-the-art methodology comes with several advantages, like bypassing 
systematic distortions of retrospective methods, avoiding distortions seen in 
laboratory settings, and revealing an objective physical activity assessment. 
Most importantly, ambulatory assessment studies enable to analyze how physical 
activity and mood wax and wane within persons over time in contrast to existing 
studies on physical activity and mood which mostly investigated between-person 
associations. However, there are very few studies on how mood dimensions (i.e., 
feeling well, energetic and calm) drive non-exercise activity (NEA; such as 
climbing stairs) within persons. Recent reviews argued that some of these 
studies have methodological limitations, e.g., scarcely representative samples, 
short study periods, physical activity assessment via self-reports, and low 
sampling frequencies. To overcome these limitations, we conducted an ambulatory 
assessment study in a community-based sample of 106 adults over 1 week. 
Participants were asked to report mood ratings on e-diaries and to wear an 
accelerometer in daily life. We conducted multilevel analyses to investigate 
whether mood predicted NEA, which was defined as the mean acceleration within 
the 10-min interval directly following an e-diary assessment. Additionally, we 
analyzed the effects of NEA on different time frames following the e-diary 
prompts in an exploratory manner. Our results revealed that valence 
significantly and positively predicted NEA within persons (p = 0.001). Feeling 
more energetic was associated with significantly increased NEA (p < 0.001), 
whereas feeling calmer was associated with significantly decreased NEA (p < 
0.001) on the within-person level. The analyses on different time frames of NEA 
largely confirmed our findings. In conclusion, we showed that mood predicted NEA 
within adults but with distinct magnitudes and directions of effects for each 
mood dimension.

A single early prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level has been correlated with a 
higher likelihood of prostate cancer diagnosis and death in younger men. PSA 
testing in older men has been considered of limited utility. We evaluated 
prostate cancer death in relation to age and PSA level immediately prior to 
prostate cancer diagnosis. Using the Veterans Affairs database, we identified 
230,081 men aged 50-89 years diagnosed with prostate cancer and at least one 
prior PSA test between 1999 and 2009. Prostate cancer-specific death over time 
was calculated for patients stratified by age group (e.g., 50-59 years, through 
80-89 years) and PSA range at diagnosis (10 ranges) using Kaplan-Meier methods. 
Risk of 10-year prostate cancer mortality across age and PSA was compared using 
log-rank tests with a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. 10.5% of men 
diagnosed with prostate cancer died of cancer during the 10-year study period 
(mean follow-up = 3.7 years). Higher PSA values prior to diagnosis predict a 
higher risk of death in all age groups (p < 0.0001). Within the same PSA range, 
older age groups are at increased risk for death from prostate cancer 
(p < 0.0001). For PSA of 7-10 ng/mL, cancer-specific death, 10 years after 
diagnosis, increased from 7% for age 50-59 years to 51% for age 80-89 years. Men 
older than 70 years are more likely to die of prostate cancer at any PSA level 
than younger men, suggesting prostate cancer remains a significant problem among 
older men (even those aged 80+) and deserves additional study.

AIMS: To identify and establish a research database of ageing New Zealand people 
who sustained a traumatic or non-traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) before 1990.
METHODS: All living New Zealand residents incurring a SCI before 1 January 1990 
were eligible. A co-ordinated consultation with apposite New Zealand 
organisations was undertaken to identify and access existing SCI databases, and 
remove duplicate or ineligible records.
RESULTS: 1,400 people were identified. Using the national patient information 
management system to determine eligibility, 1,174 people remained after 
exclusions; 600 (51.1%) through the Auckland Spinal Rehabilitation Unit and 574 
(48.9%) through the Burwood Spinal Unit. Common to both databases were people's 
National Health Index number, contact details, basic demographic data, date of 
injury, and neurological level of SCI.
CONCLUSIONS: An unexpectedly large SCI population was uncovered; a population 
largely hidden due to the uncoordinated, fragmented and inconsistently collected 
information held within different organisations. As life expectancy rapidly 
increases for those with SCI, coupled with an accelerated ageing general 
population, this hidden SCI population can be expected to grow. A single, 
well-managed and coordinated national SCI registry is urgently needed in New 
Zealand for planning and delivery of services, especially for those developing 
age-related complex interwoven secondary conditions.

While β-thalassemia major (β-TM)-related physiological complications have been 
well established, less is known about implications for neuropsychological and 
cognitive function. The few existing studies have focused almost exclusively on 
children. We evaluated cognitive function in adult β-TM patients compared to 
healthy controls (study 1) and in β-TM patients before and after blood 
transfusion (study 2). Performance intelligence quotient (IQ) was evaluated with 
four subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III). Attention 
functions were evaluated using the online continuous performance test (OCPT). 
The results of study 1 revealed poorer performance of β-TM patients on three of 
the four intelligence subtests, with significantly lower total performance IQ 
scores compared with controls. The percentage of participants with abnormal 
performance IQ (<85) was almost five times higher in the β-TM group (58%) than 
in the control group (12%). In study 2, significant differences were found in 
OCPT performance as a function of blood transfusion. Before transfusion, 
patients had higher rates of omission and commission errors, slower response 
times (RTs), and lower RT consistency than after transfusion. As β-TM patients' 
life expectancy is increasing, assessment and treatment of neurocognitive 
functions should become an integral part of appropriate follow-up to improve 
patients' quality of life.

PURPOSE: The prevalence of osteoporosis has continuously increased over the past 
decades and it is set to increase substantially as life expectancy rises 
steadily. Fragility or osteoporotic fractures of the pelvis often occur after 
low energy falls e.g. from standing, however, some patients present with assumed 
insufficiency fractures of the pelvis without a previous trauma. Osteoporotic
