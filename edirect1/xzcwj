OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of the IL-6 receptor 
antibody tocilizumab in patients with Takayasu arteritis (TAK).
METHODS: Patients completing the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
period of the TAKT (Takayasu arteritis Treated with Tocilizumab) trial were 
followed up during open-label extended treatment with weekly s.c. tocilizumab 
162 mg for up to 96 weeks or longer, with oral glucocorticoid tapering performed 
at the investigators' discretion. Endpoints of the extension analysis included 
steroid-sparing effects of tocilizumab, imaging data, patient-reported outcomes 
(36-Item Short Form Health Survey) and safety.
RESULTS: All 36 patients enrolled in the double-blind period entered the 
open-label extension; 28 patients received tocilizumab for 96 weeks. The median 
glucocorticoid dose was 0.223 mg/kg/day at the time of relapse before study 
entry, 0.131 mg/kg/day (interquartile range 0.099, 0.207) after 48 weeks and 
0.105 mg/kg/day (interquartile range 0.039, 0.153) after 96 weeks. Overall, 
46.4% of patients reduced their dose to <0.1 mg/kg/day, which was less than half 
the dose administered at relapse before study entry (mean difference 
-0.120 mg/kg/day; 95% CI -0.154, -0.087). Imaging evaluations indicated that 
most patients' disease was improved (17.9%) or stable (67.9%) after 96 weeks 
compared with baseline. Mean 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical and 
mental component summary scores and 7 of 8 domain scores were clinically 
improved from baseline and maintained over 96 weeks of tocilizumab treatment. No 
unexpected safety issues were reported.
CONCLUSION: These results in patients with Takayasu arteritis provide evidence 
of a steroid-sparing effect and improvements in well-being during long-term 
treatment with once-weekly tocilizumab 162 mg, with no new safety concerns.

BACKGROUND: Ambient fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) is one leading 
cause of disease burden, but no study has quantified the association between 
daily PM2.5 exposure and life expectancy. We aimed to assess the potential 
benefits in life expectancy by attaining the daily PM2.5 standards in 72 cities 
of China during 2013-2016.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We applied a two-stage approach for the analysis. At the 
first stage, we used a generalized additive model (GAM) with a Gaussian link to 
examine the city-specific short-term association between daily PM2.5 and years 
of life lost (YLL); at the second stage, a random-effects meta-analysis was used 
to generate the regional and national estimations. We further estimated the 
potential gains in life expectancy (PGLE) by assuming that ambient PM2.5 has met 
the Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS, 75 μg/m3) or the 
ambient air quality guideline (AQG) of the World Health Organization (WHO) (25 
μg/m3). We also calculated the attributable fraction (AF), which denoted the 
proportion of YLL attributable to a higher-than-standards daily mean PM2.5 
concentration. During the period from January 18, 2013 to December 31, 2016, we 
recorded 1,226,849 nonaccidental deaths in the study area. We observed 
significant associations between daily PM2.5 and YLL: each 10 μg/m3 increase in 
three-day-averaged (lag02) PM2.5 concentrations corresponded to an increment of 
0.43 years of life lost (95% CI: 0.29-0.57). We estimated that 168,065.18 (95% 
CI: 114,144.91-221,985.45) and 68,684.95 (95% CI: 46,648.79-90,721.11) years of 
life lost can be avoided by achieving WHO's AQG and Chinese NAAQS in the study 
area, which corresponded to 0.14 (95% CI: 0.09-0.18) and 0.06 (95% CI: 
0.04-0.07) years of gain in life expectancy for each death in these cities. We 
observed differential regional estimates across the 7 regions, with the highest 
gains in the Northwest region (0.28 years of gain [95% CI: 0.06-0.49]) and the 
lowest in the North region (0.08 [95% CI: 0.02-0.15]). Furthermore, using WHO's 
AQG and Chinese NAAQS as the references, we estimated that 1.00% (95% CI: 
0.68%-1.32%) and 0.41% (95% CI: 0.28%-0.54%) of YLL could be attributable to the 
PM2.5 exposure at the national level. Findings from this study were mainly 
limited by the unavailability of data on individual PM2.5 exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that significantly longer life expectancy 
could be achieved by a reduction in the ambient PM2.5 concentrations. It also 
highlights the need to formulate a stricter ambient PM2.5 standard at both 
national and regional levels of China to protect the population's health.

AIMS: Cardiac surgery has improved life expectancy of patients with congenital 
heart diseases (CHDs). Exercise capacity is an important determinant of survival 
in patients with CHDs. There is a lack of studies focusing on the role of 
resting respiratory performance in reducing exercise tolerance in these 
patients.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and severity of respiratory functional 
impairment in different types of corrected/palliated CHDs, and its impact on an 
exercise test.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective single-center study involving 168 
corrected/palliated patients with CHD and 52 controls. Patients CHD were divided 
into subgroups according to the presence of native pulmonary blood flow or total 
cavopulmonary connection (TCPC). All subjects performed complete pulmonary 
function tests and gas diffusion; patients with CHD also performed 
cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX).
RESULTS: Mean values of lung volumes were within the normal range in all CHD 
groups. Comparing to controls, patients with the reduced pulmonary flow and with 
TCPC had the highest reduction in lung volumes. CPX was reduced in all groups, 
most severely in TCPC, and it was correlated to decreased dynamic volumes in all 
CHD groups except in TCPC. Younger age at intervention and number of surgical 
operations negatively affected lung volumes.
CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory function is within the normal range in our patients 
with different CHDs at rest but altered in all CHDs during exercise when 
cardiorespiratory balance is likely to be inadequate. Comparing the different 
groups, patients with reduced pulmonary flow and TCPC are the most impaired.

Aim: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab compared with docetaxel 
and nivolumab for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
as a second-line treatment, in a French setting.Materials and methods: A 
three-state partitioned-survival model was developed (progression-free survival, 
post-progression survival, death) based on the phase IIIOAK trial on a 10-year 
time horizon. The comparison between nivolumab and atezolizumab came from a 
network meta-analysis. Utilities were estimated from the OAK trial EQ-5D 
applying the French utility tariffs. Overall survival (OS), progression-free 
survival (PFS), and treatment duration were estimated using parametric models 
selected using Akaike and Bayesian information criterion. Extrapolation beyond 
the trial duration followed NICE DSU TSD 14. Economic perspective was the one of 
all payers, discount rate fixed at 4% on benefits and costs. This analysis was 
aligned with French Haute Autorité de Santé recommendations. Results were 
expressed in total cost (2019) and €/QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Year). Model 
robustness was checked through sensitivity analyses, and a probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis was conducted.Results: In comparison to docetaxel, 
atezolizumab costs 49,429€ more and increased life expectancy by 8 months, 
generating 0.47 QALY. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at 
104,835€/QALY. When comparing nivolumab to atezolizumab, a cost minimization 
analysis was conducted since no clear evidence supporting a difference in terms 
of survival benefit was reported. Using list price, and the Market Access 
Authorization regimens, atezolizumab saved approximately 6,000€, 9.5% of its 
total costs. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our 
findings.Conclusion: Atezolizumab is more efficient and more costly than 
docetaxel in the second-line treatment of NSCLC of stage IIIB or IV, in France, 
with results consistent to previous French authorities' evaluation of 
immunotherapies in similar indication. Lastly, atezolizumab is a cost saving 
alternative to nivolumab, based on list price.

Aims: To assess the cost-utility of cladribine tablets versus fingolimod in 
patients with highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in 
Portugal.Methods: A 1-year cycle cohort-based Markov state transition model was 
developed to simulate disease progression, measured by Kurtzke Expanded 
Disability Status Scale (EDSS), relapses, and conversion to 
secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Patients were assumed to remain on treatment 
until progression to EDSS level 7, conversion to SPMS, or complete loss of 
efficacy due to waning effect. Natural history was based on British Columbia 
Multiple Sclerosis registry, London Ontario database, UK MS Trust, and 
cladribine tablets clinical trial (CLARITY). Portuguese all-cause mortality was 
adjusted for the MS associated increased mortality. Clinical inputs for active 
treatments (disability progression and relapse rate) were estimated on a network 
meta-analysis. Utility weights were derived from UK-MS Survey and published 
literature. Resource consumption by EDSS and due to relapses was based on 
published literature, National DRG microdata and expert opinion. Unit costs were 
obtained from official sources. The analysis was conducted from payers' 
perspective, time horizon of 50 years and discount rate of 5%, for both costs 
and benefits. Uncertainty was assessed via probabilistic and deterministic 
sensitivity analyses.Results: Compared to fingolimod, cladribine tablets were 
associated with a delay in progression, resulting in a gain of 0.85 quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs) and a cost decrease of 25,935 €. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis resulted in a mean ICER of -31,781 € per QALY and was 
dominant in 98.7% of the simulations. Cladribine tablets were dominant across 
the scenario analyses tested.Conclusions: Treatment of highly active RRMS with 
cladribine tablets was less costly and more effective than treatment with 
fingolimod. Hence, it is a dominant strategy in the Portuguese setting. No 
conclusions can be drawn from the present study regarding other treatment 
options, in particular natalizumab and alemtuzumab.

PURPOSE: With increased implant-prosthodontic rehabilitation for mandibular 
edentulism together with the increased life expectancy and activity of the 
elderly population, a greater number of implant patients may be at risk of 
facial trauma. The aim of this 3-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis (FEA) 
was to evaluate the biomechanical effects of the edentulous mandible (EM) with 
and without implants exposed to frontal facial trauma including assessment of 
the fracture risk of different mandibular areas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: By use of a 3D FEA, our experimental study design 
comprised 3 different models (model A, EM; model B, EM with 4 unsplinted 
interforaminal implants; and model C, EM with 4 splinted interforaminal 
implants) exposed to application of symphyseal frontal trauma of 2 MPa. In 3 
defined regions of interest (ROIs) (ROI 1, symphyseal area; ROI 2, mental 
foraminal area; and ROI 3, condylar neck), the effective stress was measured at 
predefined sites in the superficial cortical mandibular area. The stress values 
of all ROIs evaluated were compared within each model (intramodel) as well as 
between the 3 models (intermodel).
RESULTS: For all models evaluated, a frontal traumatic load generated the 
highest stress levels in the condylar neck. However, for both models with 
implants (models B and C), the stress values were reduced significantly 
(P < .01) in the condylar neck region (ROI 3) but increased significantly 
(P < .001) in the mental foraminal area (ROI 2) compared with the EM model 
without implants. For the symphyseal area (ROI 1) evaluated, the unsplinted 
4-implant model (model B) presented significantly (P < .001) higher stress 
values than the splinted implant model (model C) when frontal forces were 
applied.
CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of splinting or lack of splinting of 4 interforaminal 
implants, force absorption or transmission may shift the predominant risk factor 
from the condylar neck to the corpus or foramen mandibulae. However, splinting 
of 4 interforaminal implants may be beneficial in reducing the risk of bone 
fracture by providing protection for anterior risk situations.

BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and treatment of osteoarthritis of the thumb allows 
for early interventions that may mitigate osteoarthritis progression and 
decrease severity later in life. Early identification of motion changes is 
limited by the clinical reliance on single planar measurements using goniometry. 
Multi-planar measurements using motion capture can provide insights into joint 
function and pathophysiology that cannot be obtained from single-plane 
goniometry measurements. Thus, the goals of this research were 1) to determine 
differences in thumb motions across three groups of participants (young healthy 
(n = 23), older healthy (n = 11), and those with carpometacarpal osteoarthritis 
(n = 24)) and 2) to determine if multi-planar motions provided additional 
movement information in comparison to standard planar measures.
METHODS: In this study, a motion capture system was used to collect standard 
clinical ranges of motion and complex multi-planar tasks. Differences in motion 
patterns due to aging and osteoarthritis were identified. Motions tested 
included palmar adduction-abduction, radial adduction-abduction, 
metacarpophalangeal flexion-extension, interphalangeal flexion-extension, 
functional adduction-abduction, opposition, and circumduction.
FINDINGS: Results indicated that motion capture was capable of detecting changes 
in carpometacarpal mobility that were not detected using standard approaches. 
Our results suggested that use of multi-planar measurements have the potential 
to identify changes that are indicators of early stages of osteoarthritis.
INTERPRETATION: Early indicators are clinically useful as they will enhance 
patient treatment by permitting the application of treatment approaches sooner, 
potentially leading to reduced overall functional deficits.

BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) have proved beneficial for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC), particularly when combined with predictive biomarkers of response. 
International guidelines recommend anti-EGFR therapy only for RAS (NRAS,KRAS) 
wild-type tumors because tumors with RAS mutations are unlikely to benefit.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to review the cost-effectiveness of RAS testing in mCRC 
patients before anti-EGFR therapy and to assess how well economic evaluations 
adhere to guidelines.
METHODS: A systematic review of full economic evaluations comparing RAS testing 
with no testing was performed for articles published in English between 2000 and 
2018. Study quality was assessed using the Quality of Health Economic Studies 
scale, and the British Medical Journal and the Philips checklists.
RESULTS: Six economic evaluations (2 cost-effectiveness analyses, 2 cost-utility 
analyses, and 2 combined cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses) were 
included. All studies were of good quality and adopted the perspective of the 
healthcare system/payer; accordingly, only direct medical costs were considered. 
Four studies presented testing strategies with a favorable incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio under the National Institute for Clinical Excellence 
(£20 000-£30 000/QALY) and the US ($50 000-$100 000/QALY) thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: Testing mCRC patients for RAS status and administering EGFR 
inhibitors only to patients with RAS wild-type tumors is a more cost-effective 
strategy than treating all patients without testing. The treatment of mCRC is 
becoming more personalized, which is essential to avoid inappropriate therapy 
and unnecessarily high healthcare costs. Future economic assessments should take 
into account other parameters that reflect the real world (eg, NRAS mutation 
analysis, toxicity of biological agents, genetic test sensitivity and 
specificity).

Role of Culture, Values, and Politics in the Implementation of Health Technology 
Assessment in India: A Commentary.

India is a diverse land with different cultures, social norms, castes, 
religions, faiths, languages, politics, and a complex healthcare system. As a 
step to enhance healthcare, the government of India announced a move toward 
universal health coverage to increase accessibility and affordability of 
health-related services. Recently, there has been an introduction of health 
technology assessment (HTA) in India to help inform evidence-based decision 
making in cases of limited resources and budgets. Nevertheless, there are 
challenges related to biased decision making, an unregulated healthcare 
framework, and the lack of data and capacity that will (directly or indirectly) 
affect the use of HTA in India. For HTA to be successful in India and in similar 
low- and middle-income countries, it is important that the decision makers 
acknowledge these challenges and embrace differences in ideologies, cultures, 
and politics instead of ignoring them. Drawing lessons from countries with 
well-developed HTA bodies may help, but these need to be modified for the 
country-specific context. Ensuring quality and transparency is key to building 
trust in medical decision making. Improved coordination at all levels of 
healthcare is vital to ensure the long-term success of HTA in India. This is 
challenging but achievable by spreading awareness among stakeholders and 
achieving moderate health-sector regulation that can combat corruption. HTA will 
prosper in India if it incorporates cultural and institutional diversity, 
alongside tackling socioeconomic inequalities.

In April 2019, Japan formally introduced health technology assessment (HTA) and, 
more specifically, a cost-effectiveness analysis, to inform healthcare decision 
making, mainly when it comes to the pricing of new technologies. This article 
provides an overview of this new policy, which was implemented formally after a 
pilot program. In the fiscal year (FY) 2012, discussions on cost-effectiveness 
assessments were initiated in Japan. After 7 years of deliberations, a 
cost-effectiveness assessment was implemented formally in April 2019. In Japan, 
the cost-effectiveness analysis has been used to inform price adjustments of 
healthcare technologies, although it has not yet been used for decision making 
on insurance coverage. Selection criteria were established because not all drugs 
and medical devices could be evaluated owing to a shortage of experts. Exclusion 
criteria have also been applied to prevent access restriction. The scope of the 
evaluation's price adjustment target is limited to part of the product price. If 
the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) threshold falls below ¥5 million 
per QALY, the price adjustment rate changes stepwise according to the cost per 
QALY. In addition to price reduction, a price-raising scheme has also been 
implemented for scenarios where products are evaluated to be highly 
cost-effective and innovative. This article describes the first formally 
implemented HTA system in Japan. Although it is too early to make any 
conclusions about its effect, the Japan-specific context makes this system 
unique. To fully understand the opportunities and challenges of the new system, 
it is vital that Japan accumulates experience with this system and develops 
human resources in health economic evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Many high cost treatments for advanced melanoma have become 
available in recent years. National health technology assessment agencies have 
raised concerns regarding uncertainty in their clinical and cost-effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is to identify economic evaluations 
of treatments for advanced melanoma and review model assumptions, outcomes, and 
quality as preparation for a health technology assessment.
METHODS: A search of Embase, MEDLINE, EconLit, and the Cochrane Database was 
conducted. Only studies using decision-analytic models were included. Two 
authors independently completed full-text review and data extraction.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies were identified. There were major differences in the 
structural assumptions underpinning the models. There was general agreement in 
study conclusions, although the predicted costs and quality-adjusted life years 
for each treatment varied. BRAF monotherapy (vemurafenib, dabrafenib) or 
BRAF/MEK combination therapy (BRAF monotherapy with cobimetinib or trametinib) 
has not been shown to be cost-effective in any jurisdiction. PD-1 inhibitors 
(pembrolizumab, nivolumab) are consistently found to be cost-effective compared 
with ipilimumab, although their cost-effectiveness compared with chemotherapy is 
not established. Combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab is unlikely 
to be cost-effective in any setting. One study including all agents found that 
none of the new treatments were cost-effective relative to chemotherapy. 
Publication of the study in a health economics journal is associated with better 
reporting of and higher-quality assessment than those published in clinical 
journals.
CONCLUSION: Despite differences in model structures and assumptions, the 
conclusions of most included studies were consistent. Health technology 
assessment has a key role in maximizing value from high-cost innovative 
treatments. Consideration should be given to divestment from BRAF/MEK inhibitors 
and ipilimumab in favor of reimbursement of PD-1 inhibitors.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of multigene testing (CYP2C19, 
SLCO1B1, CYP2C9, VKORC1) compared with single-gene testing (CYP2C19) and 
standard of care (no genotyping) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients 
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) from Medicare's perspective.
METHODS: A hybrid decision tree/Markov model was developed to simulate patients 
post-PCI for ACS requiring antiplatelet therapy (CYP2C19 to guide antiplatelet 
selection), statin therapy (SLCO1B1 to guide statin selection), and 
anticoagulant therapy in those that develop atrial fibrillation (CYP2C9/VKORC1 
to guide warfarin dose) over 12 months, 24 months, and lifetime. The primary 
outcome was cost (2016 US dollar) per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
gained. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA) varied input parameters (event probabilities, 
prescription costs, event costs, health-state utilities) to estimate changes in 
the cost per QALY gained.
RESULTS: Base-case-discounted results indicated that the cost per QALY gained 
was $59 876, $33 512, and $3780 at 12 months, 24 months, and lifetime, 
respectively, for multigene testing compared with standard of care. Single-gene 
testing was dominated by multigene testing at all time horizons. PSA-discounted 
results indicated that, at the $50 000/QALY gained willingness-to-pay threshold, 
multigene testing had the highest probability of cost-effectiveness in the 
majority of simulations at 24 months (61%) and over the lifetime (81%).
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of projected simulations, multigene testing for 
Medicare patients post-PCI for ACS has a higher probability of being 
cost-effective over 24 months and the lifetime compared with single-gene testing 
and standard of care and could help optimize medication prescribing to improve 
patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To find an alternative for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and 
equal value of life (EVL) measures. Despite the importance of QALY in 
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)-because it captures the effects of both life 
expectancy and health-related quality of life (QOL) and enables comparisons 
across interventions and disease areas-its potential to be discriminatory 
towards patients with lower QOL presents a critical challenge that has resulted 
in the exclusion of its use in some public decision making (eg, US Medicare) on 
healthcare in the United States. Alternatives to QALY, such as EVL, have not 
gained traction because EVL fails to recognize the QOL gains during added years 
of life.
METHODS: We present a new metric for effectiveness for CEA, health years in 
total (HYT), which overcomes both the specific distributional issue raised by 
QALY and the efficiency challenges of EVL.
RESULTS: The HYT framework separates life expectancy changes and QOL changes on 
an additive scale. HYT have the same axiomatic foundations as QALY and perform 
better than both QALY, in terms of the discriminatory implications, and EVL, in 
terms of capturing QOL gains during added years of life. HYT are straightforward 
to calculate within a CEA model. We found that thresholds of $34 000/HYT and $89 
000/HYT correspond to CEA thresholds of $50 000/QALY and $150 000/QALY, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The HYT framework may provide a viable alternative to both the QALY 
and the EVL; its application to diverse healthcare technologies and stakeholder 
assessments are important next steps in its development and evaluation.

INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: In the 1990s, a strong inverse relationship between life 
expectancy (LE) in Russia and mortality from alcohol poisoning was observed. 
This association is remarkable as this cause accounts for less than 2% of deaths 
each year. It can be explained by treating the alcohol poisoning mortality as 
the best available measure in Russia of the population prevalence of harmful 
drinking in any year which in turn associated with mortality from a wide range 
of causes. This study analyses the evolving relationship of LE with this 
mortality-based measure of harmful drinking since 1965, and places it in a 
policy context.
DESIGN AND METHODS: We examine three periods: 1965-1984, a period of gradual LE 
decline; 1984-2003, a period of massive LE fluctuations; and 2003-2017, a period 
of LE improvement. Pearson's correlation coefficients and a linear relationship 
between annual changes in LE and alcohol poisoning were estimated for each 
period.
RESULTS: The strongest negative correlation between changes in LE and alcohol 
poisonings was found in 1984-2003. Over the period 2003-2017 a consistent 
positive LE trend emerged that was statistically independent of alcohol 
poisoning.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in the period from the 
mid-2000s a growth of LE in Russia was to a large extent independent of changes 
in the population prevalence of harmful drinking. While there has been a 
reduction in mortality at ages 15-64, at older ages mortality reduction 
unrelated to alcohol has become an increasingly important driver of overall 
mortality improvements.

OBJECTIVE: Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are a commonly used treatment 
strategy for low back pain and lumbar radiculopathy. However, their 
cost-effectiveness and ability to mediate long-term quality of life (QOL) 
improvements is debated. We sought to analyze the cost-effectiveness of lumbar 
epidural steroid injections (ESIs) compared to medical management alone for 
patients with lumbar radiculopathy and low back pain.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: QOL outcomes were prospectively collected at 3- and 
6-months following initial consultation. Metrics included the EuroQol-5 
Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire, the Pain Disability Questionnaire (PDQ), the 
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Cost 
estimations were based on Medicare national payment amounts, median income, and 
missed workdays. A cost-utility analysis was performed based upon cost 
estimations and a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000/Quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY).
RESULTS: One hundred forty-one patients met our inclusion/exclusion criteria; 89 
received ESI and 52 were treated with medical management alone. Both cohorts 
showed improved EQ-5D scores at 3 months but were similar to one another: ESI 
(ΔEQ-5D = 0.06; p = 0.03) and medical-alone (ΔEQ-5D = 0.07; p = 0.03). No 
significant difference was seen between groups for total costs ($2,190 vs. 
$1,772; p = 0.18) or cost-utility ratios ($38,710/QALY vs. $27,313/QALY; p = 
0.73). At both the 3-month and 6-month endpoints, absolute differences in 
cost-utility was driven by overall costs as opposed to QALY gains. Medical 
management alone was more cost effective at both points owing to lower 
expenditures, however these differences were not significant. No benefits were 
seen in either group on the EQ-5D or any of the patient reported outcomes at the 
6-month time point.
CONCLUSION: ESIs were not cost-effective at either the 3-month or 6-month 
follow-up period. At 3 months, ESIs provide similar improvements in QOL outcomes 
relative to medical management and at similar costs. At 6 months, neither ESIs 
nor conservative management provide significant improvements in QOL outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Because of the inadequate number of deceased kidney donors, living 
kidney donation remains an important issue for kidney transplantation. Previous 
studies have shown that living donation does not differ life expectancy and 
progression to end-stage renal disease compared with the normal population. In 
this study, we investigated short-term cardiovascular changes after donor 
nephrectomy.
METHODS: Thirty-four patients who underwent donor nephrectomy between January 
2015 and July 2015 at Ege University Renal Transplantation Unit were included in 
the study. Arterial stiffness, multifrequency bioimpedance analysis, renal ARFI 
elastography, and echocardiography performed prior to the donor nephrectomy and 
6 months after nephrectomy.
RESULTS: A total of 34 kidney donors were enrolled in this study. Twenty donors 
were female (59%) and 14 donors were male (41%). The pathological evaluation of 
donor kidneys using implantation renal biopsy sample revealed mean Karpinski 
Renal Score of 1.5 and the mean glomerulosclerosis ratio was 5% for all donated 
kidneys. Arterial stiffness, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measures, 
body fluid composition, and left atrial size did not change significantly during 
the follow-up. However, interventricular septum thickness of donors increased by 
1 mm during a 6-month period (9.6 mm vs 10.6 mm, P = .002).
CONCLUSION: We observed an increase in interventricular septum thickness in 
kidney donors during a 6-month follow-up. In order to evaluate the net effect of 
this change on donor morbidity, prospective studies investigating an increased 
number of donors with long-term follow-up should be needed.

OBJECTIVES: Stunting increases a child's susceptibility to diseases, increases 
mortality, and is associated over long term with reduced cognitive abilities, 
educational achievement, and productivity. We aimed to assess the most effective 
public health nutritional intervention to reduce stunting in Myanmar.
METHODS: We searched the literature and developed a conceptual framework for 
interventions known to reduce stunting. We focused on the highest impact and 
most feasible interventions to reduce stunting in Myanmar, described policies to 
implement them, and compared their costs and projected effect on stunting using 
data-based decision trees. We estimated costs from the government perspective 
and calculated total projected cases of stunting prevented and cost per case 
prevented (cost-effectiveness). All interventions were compared to projected 
cases of stunting resulting from the current situation (e.g., no additional 
interventions).
RESULTS: Three new policy options were identified. Operational feasibility for 
all three options ranged from medium to high. Compared to the current situation, 
two were similarly cost-effective, at an additional USD 598 and USD 667 per case 
of stunting averted. The third option was much less cost-effective, at an 
additional USD 27,741 per case averted. However, if donor agencies were to 
expand their support in option three to the entire country, the prevalence of 
22.5 percent would be reached by 2025 at an additional USD 667 per case averted.
CONCLUSIONS: A policy option involving immediate expansion of the current 
implementation of proven nutrition-specific interventions is feasible. It would 
have the highest impact on stunting and would approach the WHO 2025 target.

PURPOSE: Evaluating whether a new health technology provides good value for 
money requires an assessment of its opportunity cost. If the opportunity cost of 
the new health technology exceeds the benefits, however measured, a net loss is 
produced. Value frameworks using economic evaluation methods have been developed 
to guide the assessment of the value of new technologies within health care in 
response to rising spending. However, few explicitly consider health opportunity 
costs and fewer still base health opportunity costs on empirical estimates. This 
may partly be due to the dearth of estimates available, with only a handful of 
countries having estimates based on within-country data. To fill this gap, this 
study provides estimates of cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) 
averted for 33 high-income countries and the remaining Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) and BRIICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, 
Indonesia, China and South Africa).
METHODS: Cost per DALY averted for each country was based on estimated 
elasticities of the health effects of changes in expenditure on health outcomes 
from applying an existing published econometric model that uses cross-country 
data to an expanded dataset and other existing elasticities drawn from selected 
UK within-country studies to country-level data on health expenditure, 
demographic characteristics, and burden of ill health. To provide a 
comprehensive picture of the state of research around empirical estimates of 
health opportunity costs for these countries, results from this study are 
reported against previously published estimates of cost per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained for the same countries.
FINDINGS: All but one of the ranges estimated fall below 3× the gross domestic 
product (GDP) per capita, the upper end of the widely applied range of 1-3× GDP 
per capita. The range of estimates based on applying an existing published 
econometric model that uses cross-country data to an expanded dataset are higher 
than when cost per DALY averted is calculated from other existing elasticities 
of the health effects of changes in expenditure drawn from selected UK 
within-country studies. They also tend to be higher than published estimates of 
cost per QALY gained.
IMPLICATIONS: This study provides placeholder cost per DALY averted estimates 
that reflect health opportunity costs for 33 high-income countries and the 
remaining OECD and BRIICS countries. These estimates can be used to estimate the 
health opportunity costs of government health care expenditure until 
country-specific health opportunity cost are estimated using within-country 
data.
