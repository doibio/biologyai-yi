BACKGROUND: Premature mortality observed among the mentally ill is largely 
attributable to chronic illnesses. Veterans seen within Veterans Affairs (VA) 
have a higher prevalence of mental illness than the general population but there 
is limited investigation into the common causes of death of Veterans with mental 
illnesses.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the life expectancy of mentally ill Veterans seen in 
VA primary care, and to determine the most death rates of combinations of mental 
illnesses.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of decedents.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Veterans seen in VA primary care clinics between 2000 and 
2011 were included. Records from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) were 
merged with death information from the National Death Index.
MAIN MEASURES: Mental illnesses were determined using ICD9 codes. Direct 
standardization methods were used to calculate age-adjusted gender and 
cause-specific death rates per 1000 deaths for patients with and without 
depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use 
disorder (SUD), serious mental illness (SMI), and combinations of those 
diagnoses.
KEY RESULTS: Of the 1,763,982 death records for Veterans with 1 + primary care 
visit, 556,489 had at least one mental illness. Heart disease and cancer were 
the two leading causes of death among Veterans with or without a mental illness, 
accounting for approximately 1 in 4 deaths. Those with SUD (n = 204,950) had the 
lowest mean age at time of death (64 ± 12 years). Among men, the death rates 
were as follows: SUD (55.9/1000); anxiety (49.1/1000); depression (45.1/1000); 
SMI (40.3/1000); and PTSD (26.2/1000). Among women, death rates were as follows: 
SUD (55.8/1000); anxiety (36.7/1000); depression (45.1/1000); SMI (32.6/1000); 
and PTSD (23.1/1000 deaths). Compared to men (10.8/1000) and women (8.7/1000) 
without a mental illness, these rates were multiple-fold higher in men and in 
women with a mental illness. A greater number of mental illness diagnoses was 
associated with higher death rates among men and women (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Veterans with mental illnesses, particularly those with SUD, and 
those with multiple diagnoses, had shorter life expectancy than those without a 
mental illness. Future studies should examine both patient and systemic sources 
of disparities in providing chronic illness care to Veterans with a mental 
illness.

BACKGROUND: The potential benefit of mobile health (M-Health) in developing 
countries for improving the efficiency of health care service delivery, health 
care quality, and patient safety, as well as reducing cost, has been 
increasingly recognized and emphasized in the last few years.
OBJECTIVE: Limited research has investigated the facilitators and barriers for 
the adoption of M-Health in developing countries to secure successful 
implementation of the technology. To fill this knowledge gap, we propose an 
integrative model that explains the patient's adoption behavior of M-Health in 
developing countries grounded on the unified theory of acceptance and use of 
technology, dual-factor model, and health belief model.
METHOD: We empirically tested and evaluated the model based on data collected 
using a survey method from 280 patients living in a developing country. Partial 
least squares (PLS-SEM) technique was used for data analysis.
RESULTS: The results showed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, 
social influence, perceived health threat, M-Health app quality, and life 
quality expectancy have a direct positive effect on patients' intention to use 
M-Health. The results also showed that security and privacy risks have a direct 
negative effect on the patient's intention to use M-Health. However, resistance 
to change was found to have an indirect negative effect on patients' intention 
to use M-Health through the performance expectancy.
CONCLUSION: The research contributes to the existing literature of health 
information systems and M-Health by better understanding how technological, 
social, and functional factors are associated with digital health applications 
and services use and success in the context of developing countries. With the 
widespread availability of mobile technologies and services and the growing 
demand for M-Health apps, this research can help guide the development of the 
next generation of M-Health apps with a focus on the needs of patients in 
developing countries. The research has several theoretical and practical 
implications for the health care industry, government, policy makers, and 
technology developers and designers.

Background: Chiari I malformation (CMI) is usually a chronic disorder, although 
it may also present as a life-threatening condition with need for urgent 
decompression. Studies of acute deterioration of CMI are scarce. The 
identification of preoperative radiological factors that predict acute 
deterioration in adult patients with CMI facilitates planning of early 
decompression and decreases CMI-related morbidity.Patients and methods: This is 
a retrospective study of all adult patients with CMI who were referred to 
Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sweden and underwent occipitocervical 
decompression in the period 2006-2016. In total, 65 consecutive patients were 
included and data regarding the preoperative degree of tonsillar herniation and 
syrinx (size, length and degree of rostral extension) were registered. Acute 
deterioration and the need for urgent surgical decompression within 24 h of 
hospitalisation were noted.Results: Three patients presented with acute 
deterioration of symptoms (4.6%) and showed an increased length and size of 
syrinx and more rostral extension of syrinx as compared to non-acute patients 
with CMI.Conclusion: Our study highlights the incidence of acute deterioration 
of CMI and shows the importance of assessing preoperative size, length and 
rostral extension of CMI-associated syrinx as indicators of acute deterioration 
so that CMI patients can be assigned to early surgical decompression.

Comment in
    Lancet. 2019 Nov 16;394(10211):1784-1786.

BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews have consistently shown that individuals with 
mental disorders have an increased risk of premature mortality. Traditionally, 
this evidence has been based on relative risks or crude estimates of reduced 
life expectancy. The aim of this study was to compile a comprehensive analysis 
of mortality-related health metrics associated with mental disorders, including 
sex-specific and age-specific mortality rate ratios (MRRs) and life-years lost 
(LYLs), a measure that takes into account age of onset of the disorder.
METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we included all people younger 
than 95 years of age who lived in Denmark at some point between Jan 1, 1995, and 
Dec 31, 2015. Information on mental disorders was obtained from the Danish 
Psychiatric Central Research Register and the date and cause of death was 
obtained from the Danish Register of Causes of Death. We classified mental 
disorders into ten groups and causes of death into 11 groups, which were further 
categorised into natural causes (deaths from diseases and medical conditions) 
and external causes (suicide, homicide, and accidents). For each specific mental 
disorder, we estimated MRRs using Poisson regression models, adjusting for sex, 
age, and calendar time, and excess LYLs (ie, difference in LYLs between people 
with a mental disorder and the general population) for all-cause mortality and 
for each specific cause of death.
FINDINGS: 7 369 926 people were included in our analysis. We found that 
mortality rates were higher for people with a diagnosis of a mental disorder 
than for the general Danish population (28·70 deaths [95% CI 28·57-28·82] vs 
12·95 deaths [12·93-12·98] per 1000 person-years). Additionally, all types of 
disorders were associated with higher mortality rates, with MRRs ranging from 
1·92 (95% CI 1·91-1·94) for mood disorders to 3·91 (3·87-3·94) for substance use 
disorders. All types of mental disorders were associated with shorter life 
expectancies, with excess LYLs ranging from 5·42 years (95% CI 5·36-5·48) for 
organic disorders in females to 14·84 years (14·70-14·99) for substance use 
disorders in males. When we examined specific causes of death, we found that 
males with any type of mental disorder lost fewer years due to neoplasm-related 
deaths compared with the general population, although their cancer mortality 
rates were higher.
INTERPRETATION: Mental disorders are associated with premature mortality. We 
provide a comprehensive analysis of mortality by different types of disorders, 
presenting both MRRs and premature mortality based on LYLs, displayed by age, 
sex, and cause of death. By providing accurate estimates of premature mortality, 
we reveal previously underappreciated features related to competing risks and 
specific causes of death.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A progressive decrease in muscle mass until full-blown 
sarcopenia may occur in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and worsen their 
life quality and expectancy. Here we investigate the prevalence of obesity and 
obesity-associated muscle wasting in PD patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study design was observational, cross sectional. Body 
composition was assessed with BIA and BIVA in 88 PD patients (53.4 ± 13.1 years; 
67% male). Patients with obesity and/or with reduced muscle mass were identified 
using FMI and SM/BW cutoff values, respectively. Inflammatory status was 
assessed by measuring CRP and fibrinogen blood levels.
RESULTS: A total of 44.3% of the patients showed a reduced muscle mass (37.5% 
moderate and 6.8% severe). The prevalence of obesity was 6.1%, 81.8%, and 100% 
in patients with normal, moderately, and severely reduced muscle mass, 
respectively (p < 0.05). Of the total, 15.2% of the patients with normal muscle 
mass, 18.4% of those with moderately reduced muscle mass, and 66.7% of those 
with severely reduced muscle mass had diabetes. The prevalence of severe muscle 
mass loss was higher in those with diabetes than in those without diabetes 
(22.2% vs. 2.8%, p < 0.05). Patients with obesity-associated muscle wasting 
showed higher fibrinogen (613.9 ± 155.1 vs. 512.9 ± 159.5 mg/dL, p < 0.05) and 
CPR (1.4 ± 1.3 vs. 0.6 ± 0.8 mg/dL, p < 0.05) blood concentrations than those 
with normal body composition.
CONCLUSION: Obesity and diabetes were strongly associated with muscle mass loss 
in our PD patients. It remains to be established whether prevention of obesity 
with nutritional interventions can halt the occurrence of muscle mass loss in 
patients on PD.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in women caused 
by the human papillomavirus (HPV) that leads to a substantial disease burden for 
health systems. Prevention through vaccination can significantly reduce the 
prevalence of cervical cancer. The objective of this study is to evaluate the 
potential health and economic impacts of introducing two-dose bivalent 
(Cervarix) and quadrivalent (Gardasil) HPV vaccines in Bangladesh.
METHODS: The study uses the Papillomavirus Rapid Interface for Modelling and 
Economics (PRIME) model to assess the cost-effectiveness of introducing HPV 
vaccination. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated 
per disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted using the cost-effectiveness 
threshold (CET). The analyses were done from a health system perspective in 
terms of vaccine delivery routes.
RESULTS: Introduction of bi-valent HPV vaccination was found highly 
cost-effective (ICER = US$488/DALY) at Gavi (The Vaccine Alliance for Vaccines 
and Immunizations) negotiated prices. The value of ICERs were US$710, US$356 and 
US$397 per DALY averted for school-based, health facility-based, and 
outreach-based programs, respectively, which is consistent with the CET range 
(US$67 to US$854). However, bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines at listed prices 
were not found cost-effective, with ICERs of US$1405 and US$3250 per DALY 
averted, respectively, that exceeds the CETs values.
CONCLUSIONS: Introducing a two-dose bi-valent HPV vaccination program is 
cost-effective in Bangladesh at Gavi negotiated prices. Vaccine price is the 
dominating parameter for the cost-effectiveness of bivalent and quadrivalent 
vaccines. Both vaccines are not cost-effective at listed prices in Bangladesh. 
The evaluation highlights that introducing the two-dose bivalent HPV vaccine at 
Gavi negotiated prices into a national immunization program in Bangladesh is 
economically viable to reduce the burden of cervical cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse the quality and impact of cost-utility evaluations of 
medical devices carried out by the Spanish Network of Assessment Agencies 
(RedETS).
METHOD: The cost-utility evaluations of medical devices were identified by 
searching the evaluation reports of the RedETS website database (2006-2016). 
Quality and its impact were evaluated with a RedETS quality checklist, comparing 
cost-utility results and inclusion in the portfolio of common services of the 
National Health System. The portfolio inclusion status was analysed considering 
whether the cost-effectiveness incremental ratio was or was not less than 
€25,000/quality adjusted life years.
RESULTS: 25 cost-utility evaluations of medical devices were found (12 
cost-utility, 10 cost-effectiveness and 3 both). Fifteen selected cost-utility 
studies with 19 cost-utility ratios met at least 18 of 25 verification criteria. 
Also, 12 of the 15 studies met 19 of the 25 criteria. On the impact, in 6 out of 
the 19 results, the product was included in the portfolio even though the ratio 
exceeded €25,000/quality adjusted life years. There are three cases undergoing a 
re-evaluation process, another case being reconsidered once the efficacy-safety 
of new devices has been reported and in two cases the portfolio states that 
protocols are required.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the cost-utility evaluations of medical devices published 
by RedETS fulfil most of the items on the checklist and, therefore, were 
thorough. These cost-utility evaluations of medical devices are consistent with 
the decision-making framework to efficiently manage the National Health System 
portfolio.

Ladybird beetles have successfully been used to control different pests. 
Cheilomenes sexmaculata (Fabricius) and Oenopia conglobata 
contaminata)Menetries((Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are two dominant and efficient 
predators of the common pistachio psylla, Agonoscena pistaciae (Hem.: Psyllidae) 
in Iran. In the current study, the impact of two diets, i.e., nymphs of A. 
pistaciae and eggs of Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lep.: Pyralidae), were 
investigated on the cold hardiness, supercooling point (SCP), and lethal 
temperature of different life stages of the coccinellids. The results suggested 
that the eggs of E. kuehniella are a suitable diet for both predators. In 
general, beetles of O. conglobata contaminata were more cold tolerant than those 
of C. sexmaculata. The SCP of the adults of C. sexmaculata, feeding on psyllid 
was about -15 °C, whereas the SCP of the beetles, feeding on the eggs of flour 
moth, was about -19 °C. However, the diets had no significant effects on the SCP 
of O. conglobata contaminata. For both ladybird beetles, eggs were the most 
sensitive stage, and adulthood was the most tolerant developmental stage. No 
eggs survived at zero and subzero temperatures. The survival of C. sexmaculata 
increased from 6.25% for adults fed on psyllids to 13.75% for those fed on flour 
moth eggs after 24 h exposure to cold at -4 °C. The survival of O. conglobata 
contaminata adults after exposure to cold at -4 °C for 24 h raised from 28.75% 
for adults fed on psyllids to 42.50% for those fed on flour moth eggs. 
Regardless of the diet, both beetles were considered to be chill-intolerant 
insects as the most mortality occurred above the SCP.

PURPOSE: Clinical evidence regarding optimal radiation dose for palliation of 
dysphagia from esophageal cancer is generally lacking. In an effort to 
investigate optimal radiation dose, we assessed 2 different radiation schedules 
for palliation of dysphagia.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a multicenter, retrospective study comparing 
low-dose radiation therapy (LR: 5 x 4 Gy external beam radiation therapy [EBRT]) 
with high-dose radiation therapy (HR: 10 x 3 Gy EBRT and 12-Gy single-dose 
intraluminal brachytherapy) for palliation of dysphagia in patients with 
inoperable or metastasized esophageal cancer. Primary outcome was improvement of 
dysphagia at 6 weeks after start of radiation therapy. Additional outcomes were 
persistent and recurrent dysphagia during patients' remaining life, severe 
adverse events, and survival.
RESULTS: In total, 292 patients (LR, n = 117; HR, n = 175) were included in this 
study. After matching, 144 patients (72 in each group) were compared. 
Improvement of dysphagia at 6 weeks was achieved in 50% of patients after LR and 
in 66% after HR (P = .071). Persistent or recurrent dysphagia occurred in 64% of 
patients after LR and in 42% after HR (P = .012). No difference in the rate of 
severe adverse events was found (P = .889). Median survival was 88 days (95% 
confidence interval, 64-112) after LR and 177 days (95% confidence interval, 
131-223) after HR (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that both LR and HR were well tolerated and 
effective in short-term relief of dysphagia in patients with inoperable or 
metastasized esophageal cancer. HR was associated with better long-term relief 
of dysphagia compared with LR. Our findings suggest that HR could be considered 
for patients with a longer life expectancy, but prospective studies are 
required.

Betula utilis (BU), an important medicinal plant that grows in high altitudes of 
the Himalayan region, has been utilized traditionally due to it's antibacterial, 
hepatoprotective, and anti-tumor properties. Here, we demonstrated the longevity 
and amyloid-β toxicity attenuating activity of B. utilis ethanolic extract (BUE) 
in Caenorhabditis elegans. Lifespan of the worms was observed under both the 
standard laboratory and stress (oxidative and thermal) conditions. Effect of BUE 
was also observed on the attenuation of age-dependent physiological parameters. 
Further, gene-specific mutants and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged 
strains were used to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the 
beneficial effects mediated by BUE supplementation. Our results showed that BUE 
(50 μg/ml) extended the mean lifespan of C. elegans by 35.99% and increased its 
survival under stress conditions. The BUE also reduced the levels of 
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 22.47%. A delayed amyloid-β 
induced paralyses was observed in CL4176 transgenic worms. Interestingly, the 
BUE supplementation was also able to reduce the α-synuclein aggregation in 
NL5901 transgenic strain. Gene-specific mutant studies suggested that the 
BUE-mediated lifespan extension was dependent on daf-16, hsf-1, and skn-1 but 
not on sir-2.1 gene. Furthermore, transgenic reporter gene expression assay 
showed that BUE treatment enhanced the expression of stress-protective genes 
such as sod-3 and gst-4. Present findings suggested that ROS scavenging 
activity, together with multiple longevity mechanisms, were involved in 
BUE-mediated lifespan extension. Thus, BUE might have potential to increase the 
lifespan and to attenuate neuro-related disease progression.

The use of combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) correlates with longer and 
healthier life and with nearly normal life expectancy in people living with HIV. 
However, cART does not completely restore health. Chronic immune activation and 
inflammation persist in treated patients and have been described as predictors 
for clinical events and mortality in HIV-infected patients. Limited information 
is available on the impact of the various cART regimens on 
inflammation/immunoactivation. The aim of this work was to explore the impact of 
elvitegravir, dolutegravir, raltegravir (integrase strand transfer inhibitors, 
INSTIs) and atazanavir (protease inhibitor, PI) on several soluble markers of 
immune activation and inflammation during the first year of effective 
combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART). We conducted an observational 
retrospective cohort study in HIV-infected cART-naïve patients who initiated an 
INSTI or atazanavir regimen between March 2015 and February 2016 and a serum 
sample was available at baseline, 6 and 12 months after initiation. We compared 
the trend of D-Dimer, TNF- α, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, CCL4/MIP1-β, CCL5/RANTES, 
s-CD14, s-CD163, hs-CRP levels among the 4 arms of treatment. Percentage of 
variation from baseline was also measured for all markers. A total of 36 
patients were included. We observed heterogeneous modifications in inflammation 
markers among arms. In particular, we noted that EVG have significant negative 
effect on s-CD14, hs-CRP, IL-6 and D-Dimer in respect to other INSTIs and this 
different effect occurs mainly during the first 6 months of cART. IL-7 values 
increased in the three arms with INSTIs (significantly only in EGV, 159.8%, 
p = 0.0003) and decreased significantly in patients on PI (-48.96%; p = 0.04) 
over the period. In conclusion, our results provide further data on changes of 
inflammatory marker levels, especially for the new INSTIs. Our data show that 
among INSTIs, EVG seems to have a worse impact on inflammation.

S011-2111 is a semicarbazone and chalcone hybrid demonstrating antiproliferative 
tumor cell-selective effects along with unique antimetastatic potential by 
mitigating PP2A-β-catenin signalling pathway. The present study envisaged to 
explore the in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetics of S011-2111. A sensitive and 
selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry bioanalytical method 
was developed and validated to determine S011-2111. It has high permeability 
across intestinal membrane as observed in in situ single-pass intestinal 
perfusion study. It has high plasma protein binding and poor aqueous solubility. 
It was rapidly partitioning into plasma of blood, where it was moderately 
stable. In mice liver microsomal stability study, S011-2111 was stable against 
cytochrome P450 enzymes but undergoes rapid glucuronidation with intrinsic 
clearance of 148.6 ± 48.3 µL/min/mg. Following 100 mg/kg oral dosing of 
S011-2111, the compound was detectable in the plasma samples up to 24 h with a 
maximum plasma concentration of 45 ± 16.5 ng/mL at 2.4 ± 0.1 h and absolute 
bioavailability of 1.68%. Knowledge from this research will assist in further 
development of S011-2111 as an anti-cancer agent.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an innovative and 
effective treatment in high-surgical-risk (HR) and inoperable patients with 
symptomatic severe aortic stenosis.
OBJECTIVES: This cost-effectiveness analysis of transfemoral TAVI (TF-TAVI) 
compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) conforms with the 
methodological guidelines for cost-effectiveness evaluation by the Ministry of 
Health, Labor, and Welfare in Japan.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of TF-TAVI using SAPIEN XT was evaluated using a 
lifetime Markov simulation from the national payer perspective. Comparators were 
SAVR for HR patients and standard of care (SOC) for inoperable patients. A 
systematic literature review for clinical evidence of TF-TAVI and comparators 
was conducted. The evidence for TF-TAVI was derived from the SOURCE XT registry 
and Japanese post marketing surveillance. Because there was no literature 
directly or indirectly comparing TF-TAVI using SAPIEN XT with comparators, the 
comparator data were selected from relevant published studies, considering the 
similarity of study eligibility criteria and patient backgrounds (eg, age and 
surgical risk scores). Sensitivity analyses were used to validate the robustness 
of results.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of TF-TAVI versus SAVR for HR 
patients was ¥1.3 million/quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of TF-TAVI versus SOC for inoperable patients was ¥3.5 
million/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: TF-TAVI was cost-effective when compared with SAVR for HR patients 
and when compared with SOC for inoperable patients, using a threshold of ¥5 
million/QALY.

BACKGROUND: Ischemic heart disease and stroke remain the leading causes of death 
globally. Poor adherence to treatment amongst patients with chronic health 
conditions is a global unresolved problem of enormous magnitude. Despite 
extensive research in the field of adherence behaviors, few studies have focused 
on motivational aspects that can enhance adherence from the patients' points of 
view post myocardial infarction.
AIM: To gain insights into the perceptions that underline health-related 
adherence behaviors, from the perspective of patients who experienced a heart 
attack.
DESIGN: A phenomenological approach.
METHODS: The study used a content analysis method, with qualitative criteria to 
establish trustworthiness. Interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 
22 participants post myocardial infarction, recruited from a hospital cardiac 
rehabilitation program and communities in Northern Israel.
RESULTS: The abstraction process generated two main categories and six 
sub-categories imbedded in the Self Determination Theory framework. While inner 
self determination or willpower, as expressed by the participants, was perceived 
as the most crucial motivator, it was insufficient. A sense of self competency 
and the ability to tailor life changes, according to personal preferences, is 
needed to turn willpower into practice. Extrinsic motivators such as family 
members, especially spouses and health professionals, are important to 
strengthen intrinsic motivation. Attitudes of caring, respect for values, and 
autonomy as opposed to patronization were perceived as helpful. The benefits of 
a cardiac rehabilitation program were articulated by attendees of the program in 
contrast to excuses by non-attendees CONCLUSION: Understanding adherence as a 
complex holistic phenomenon could advance theoretical insights and enhance 
adherence to therapies and healthy lifestyle among people post myocardial 
infarction.
IMPACT: Study findings may advance the self-care of people with long-term health 
conditions, and assist professionals to conduct interventions that strengthen 
adherence. Increased adherence can impact life expectancy, quality of life, and 
reduce the economic burden on health care systems and societies.

A large variety of drugs bind effectively to melanin, and this binding 
influences their ocular pharmacokinetic and distribution profiles. We aimed to 
establish a correlation between in vitro melanin binding and in vivo ocular 
pharmacokinetics (PK). The extent of melanin binding in vitro was determined for 
a set of model drugs; binding kinetics and binding isotherms were generated and 
fitted to a mechanistic model to derive the drug-melanin binding parameters 
(Bmax, KD, kon, and koff). In addition, in vitro ADME properties such as 
cellular permeability, P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux, plasma protein binding, 
and octanol partition coefficients were determined. Moreover, cellular uptake 
was measured in the nonpigmented ARPE-19 cells and in lightly pigmented human 
epidermal melanocytes. Finally, in vivo ocular PK studies were performed in 
albino and pigmented rats using intravenous injections. Substantial drug 
enrichment accompanied by a very long residence time was observed in pigmented 
ocular tissues, which could be linked to the melanin binding determined in vitro 
and to the intracellular drug uptake into the pigmented cells. The resulting 
ocular PK profile is shown to be a consequence of the interplay of melanin 
binding with concurrent processes such as systemic clearance, plasma protein 
binding, cellular permeation, P-glycoprotein efflux, pH partitioning, and tissue 
binding. Understanding this interplay at a mechanistic level could help in the 
rational design and development of new small-molecule drug candidates with the 
desired PK/pharmacodynamic profile to target the back of the eye.

Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer, and a worldwide problem with 
increasing incidence. Little is known about the burden of melanoma in the 
Chinese population. We evaluated temporal trends and geographic variation in 
melanoma-associated burden, to narrow an important knowledge gap concerning the 
consequences of this disorder across time, provinces in China. After the general 
analytic strategy used in the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study, we analyzed 
the incidence, mortality, prevalence and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) 
of melanoma, by age, sex and geography from 1990 to 2017. Levels in melanoma 
burden were assessed for 33 province-level administrative units between 1990 and 
2017. We used joinpoint regression analysis to estimate the slope of incidence 
and mortality trends. The age-standardized incidence rate of melanoma was 0.9 
per 100,000 in 2017, with a 110.3% rise compared to 1990. Although the 
age-standardized DALYs rate (per 100,000) decreased from 9.1 in 1990 to 7.6 in 
2017, it showed an upward trend from 2007 to 2017. The DALYs rate increased 
steadily with age for females while increased and peaked at 55-59 years for 
males. The incidence of melanoma was higher in the clustered eastern provinces 
than western provinces, while the DALYs showed a pattern in opposite direction. 
In China, there has been a substantial increase in the burden of melanoma over 
the last decade, representing an ongoing challenge in Chinese population. More 
targeted strategies should be developed for elderly population, especially for 
females, to reduce the melanoma burden throughout China, particularly the 
western provinces.

Human life expectancy has gradually increased in part through rapid advances in 
technology, including the development and use of wearable and implantable 
biomedical electronic devices and sensing monitors. A new architecture is 
proposed in this paper to replace the traditional diode circuit implementation 
in wireless power supply systems applied to the above-mentioned devices and 
monitors. By achieving near-ideal power transistor switching and leveraging the 
characteristics of conventional diodes to prevent reverse current, the proposed 
approach greatly improves the performance of the energy harvester in power 
conversion. The MOS harvester used in the uninterrupted permanent wireless 
near-field power supply described here for use in biomedical systems was 
designed and verified using the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 
(TSMC) standard 180-nm process, achieving performance results of Voltage 
conversion efficiency (VCE) = 73.55-95.12% and Power conversion efficiency (PCE) 
= 80.36-90.08% with the output load (0.1-1 kΩ) under 3.3 V ac input with an 
overall area of 1.189 mm2. These results are expected to create an important 
technical niche for new "green-energy" miniaturized energy sensing systems 
including cutting edge wirelessly powered biomedical electronics applications.

In this paper, human security-related causes of large-scale forced migration 
(LSFM) in Africa are investigated for the period 2011-2017. As distinct from the 
conventional understanding of (national) security, human security involves 
economic, public health, environmental and other aspects of people's wellbeing. 
Testing various hypotheses, we have found that civil and interstate conflicts, 
lack of democracy and poverty are the most important drivers of mass population 
displacements, whereas climate change has an indirect effect on the dependent
