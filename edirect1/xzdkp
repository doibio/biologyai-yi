BACKGROUND: Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare disease caused by 
complement dysregulation that can lead to progressive kidney damage or death if 
untreated. Owing to its rarity, the impact of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome 
and available therapies (eculizumab and ravulizumab) on patients' health-related 
quality of life is difficult to describe, but such data are required for an 
economic evaluation.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate utility values for 
atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome-related attributes in five countries for an 
economic evaluation.
METHODS: Using discrete choice experiment surveys, key atypical hemolytic uremic 
syndrome-related attributes (life expectancy, administration frequency, risk of 
meningitis, need for hospitalization, and risk of kidney impairment) were 
evaluated in adult general population samples from Australia, Canada, the 
Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK. Survey choice sets were constructed using a 
published orthogonal array. A mixed-effects logit model estimated preference 
strength for each attribute. Utilities were estimated using marginal 
substitution rates between overall survival and other attributes, weighted 
against average life expectancy.
RESULTS: Across all countries (N = 2382), utility weights revealed a consistent 
pattern: participants were averse to the risk of kidney impairment 
(disutility/utility weight range: -0.185 to -0.158), risk of meningitis (-0.041 
to -0.032), and the need for hospitalization (-0.063 to -0.048), but preferred 
8-weekly vs 2-weekly infusions over 1 h (0.013-0.039).
CONCLUSIONS: Although all attributes played a role in determining treatment 
preferences, the largest drivers were life expectancy and risk of kidney 
impairment. Participants favored 8-weekly dosing (corresponding to ravulizumab 
administration frequency) vs 2-weekly dosing. The discrete choice experiment was 
designed such that estimated (dis)utility weights can be used in future 
cost-effectiveness models in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.

BACKGROUND: The palliative prognostic index (PPI) predicts the life expectancy 
of patients with terminally ill cancer in hospice settings. This study aimed to 
evaluate PPI as a prognostic tool for predicting the life expectancy of patients 
with hematological malignancies admitted to the acute ward.
METHODS: A total of 308 patients with hematological malignancies admitted to the 
hematological ward at a medical center between January 2016 and December 2017 
were consecutively enrolled. PPI was scored within 24 h of admission. All 
patients were categorized into 3 groups by PPI for comparing survival and 
in-hospital mortality rates.
RESULTS: The median survival times were 38.4, 3.6, and 1.1 months for patients 
with good, intermediate, and poor prognostic group, respectively. The hazard 
ratio was 2.31 (95% CI 1.59-3.35, p < 0.001) when comparing the intermediate and 
good prognosis groups, and 3.90 (95% CI 2.52-6.03, p < 0.001) when comparing the 
poor and good prognosis groups. Forty-five (14.6%) patients died at discharge; 
in-hospital mortality rates among the good, intermediate, and poor prognostic 
groups were 9.0%, 23.4%, and 46.4%, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio for 
in-hospital mortality was 1.96 (95% CI, 0.80-4.82, p = 0.14) and 5.25 (95% CI, 
2.01-13.7, p < 0.001) for patients in the intermediate and poor prognostic 
groups compared to those in the good prognostic group.
CONCLUSION: PPI is an accurate prognostic tool for predicting survival times and 
in-hospital mortality rates in patients with hematological malignancies in an 
acute ward setting. PPI could assist clinicians in discussing end-of-life issues 
and in referring patients with hematological malignancies to palliative care.

BACKGROUND: Dissociative (non-epileptic) seizures are potentially treatable by 
psychotherapeutic interventions; however, the evidence for this is limited.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
dissociative seizure-specific cognitive-behavioural therapy for adults with 
dissociative seizures.
DESIGN: This was a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel-arm, mixed-methods 
randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: This took place in 27 UK-based neurology/epilepsy services, 17 liaison 
psychiatry/neuropsychiatry services and 18 cognitive-behavioural therapy 
services.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults with dissociative seizures in the previous 8 weeks and no 
epileptic seizures in the previous year and meeting other eligibility criteria 
were recruited to a screening phase from neurology/epilepsy services between 
October 2014 and February 2017. After psychiatric assessment around 3 months 
later, eligible and interested participants were randomised between January 2015 
and May 2017.
INTERVENTIONS: Standardised medical care consisted of input from neurologists 
and psychiatrists who were given guidance regarding diagnosis delivery and 
management; they provided patients with information booklets. The intervention 
consisted of 12 dissociative seizure-specific cognitive-behavioural therapy 
1-hour sessions (plus one booster session) that were delivered by trained 
therapists, in addition to standardised medical care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was monthly seizure frequency at 12 
months post randomisation. The secondary outcomes were aspects of seizure 
occurrence, quality of life, mood, anxiety, distress, symptoms, psychosocial 
functioning, clinical global change, satisfaction with treatment, 
quality-adjusted life-years, costs and cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: In total, 698 patients were screened and 368 were randomised 
(standardised medical care alone, n = 182; and cognitive-behavioural therapy 
plus standardised medical care, n = 186). Primary outcome data were obtained for 
85% of participants. An intention-to-treat analysis with multivariate imputation 
by chained equations revealed no significant between-group difference in 
dissociative seizure frequency at 12 months [standardised medical care: median 
of seven dissociative seizures (interquartile range 1-35 dissociative seizures); 
cognitive-behavioural therapy and standardised medical care: median of four 
dissociative seizures (interquartile range 0-20 dissociative seizures); 
incidence rate ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.09; p = 0.144]. Of 
the 16 secondary outcomes analysed, nine were significantly better in the arm 
receiving cognitive-behavioural therapy at a p-value < 0.05, including the 
following at a p-value ≤ 0.001: the longest dissociative seizure-free period in 
months 7-12 inclusive post randomisation (incidence rate ratio 1.64, 95% 
confidence interval 1.22 to 2.20; p = 0.001); better psychosocial functioning 
(Work and Social Adjustment Scale, standardised treatment effect -0.39, 95% 
confidence interval -0.61 to -0.18; p < 0.001); greater self-rated and 
clinician-rated clinical improvement (self-rated: standardised treatment effect 
0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.62; p = 0.001; clinician rated: 
standardised treatment effect 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.17 to 0.57; 
p < 0.001); and satisfaction with treatment (standardised treatment effect 0.50, 
95% confidence interval 0.27 to 0.73; p < 0.001). Rates of adverse events were 
similar across arms. Cognitive-behavioural therapy plus standardised medical 
care produced 0.0152 more quality-adjusted life-years (95% confidence interval 
-0.0106 to 0.0392 quality-adjusted life-years) than standardised medical care 
alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year) for cognitive-behavioural therapy plus standardised medical care 
versus standardised medical care alone based on the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, 
five-level version, and imputed data was £120,658. In sensitivity analyses, 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged between £85,724 and £206,067. 
Qualitative and quantitative process evaluations highlighted useful study 
components, the importance of clinical experience in treating patients with 
dissociative seizures and potential benefits of our multidisciplinary care 
pathway.
LIMITATIONS: Unlike outcome assessors, participants and clinicians were not 
blinded to the interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant additional benefit of dissociative 
seizure-specific cognitive-behavioural therapy in reducing dissociative seizure 
frequency, and cost-effectiveness over standardised medical care was low. 
However, this large, adequately powered, multicentre randomised controlled trial 
highlights benefits of adjunctive dissociative seizure-specific 
cognitive-behavioural therapy for several clinical outcomes, with no evidence of 
greater harm from dissociative seizure-specific cognitive-behavioural therapy.
FUTURE WORK: Examination of moderators and mediators of outcome.

Plain Language Summary: Dissociative seizures resemble epileptic seizures or 
faints, but can be distinguished from them by trained doctors. Dissociation is 
the medical word for a ‘trance-like’ or ‘switching off’ state. People with 
dissociative seizures commonly have other psychological or physical problems. 
Quality of life may be low. The condition accounts for about one in every six 
patients seen in hospitals because of seizures. We wanted to find out if people 
with dissociative seizures receiving standardised treatment would also benefit 
from a talking therapy, called cognitive–behavioural therapy, made specific to 
this disorder. We did a randomised controlled trial to find out if people with 
dissociative seizures given standardised treatment and cognitive–behavioural 
therapy (talking therapy) would do better than those given standardised 
treatment alone. Standardised treatment of dissociative seizures began with 
careful diagnosis from a neurologist and then further assessment and treatment 
from a psychiatrist. In total, 368 people with dissociative seizures 
participated, with half receiving standardised treatment alone and half having 
talking therapy plus standardised treatment. We measured seizures and 
psychological and physical health in both trial groups. We also investigated 
whether or not cognitive–behavioural therapy was good value for money. After 12 
months, patients in both trial groups seemed to have fewer monthly seizures, but 
there was no advantage in the talking therapy group. Patients in the talking 
therapy group had more consecutive days without seizures, reporting less impact 
from them in everyday situations. Patients in the talking therapy group, and 
their doctors, considered improvements to be better, and patients in this group 
reported greater satisfaction with treatment. However, the talking therapy was 
expensive and not as cost-effective as hoped. Interviews with patients and study 
clinicians showed that they valued aspects of both treatments and of the care 
provided by the multidisciplinary teams. Overall, cognitive–behavioural therapy 
designed for dissociative seizures plus standardised treatment was not better at 
reducing the total numbers of seizures reported, but did produce several 
positive benefits for participants compared with standardised treatment alone.

As highly active antiretroviral therapies have advanced, HIV patients who are 
treatment-adherent can achieve undetectable viral loads, virtual elimination of 
opportunistic infection, improved quality of life, and normal life expectancy. 
This issue focuses on emergency department management of HIV patients both with 
successful disease suppression from long-term therapy as well as the patient 
with low CD4 counts in the context of lack of engagement with care, 
nonadherence, or undiagnosed disease. Optimal emergency department management of 
patients with HIV also includes identifying and treating undiagnosed patients, 
helping to re-establish care for those who have been lost to followup, and 
preventing new HIV infections with pre-exposure and postexposure prophylaxis.

Lung transplant is increasingly performed for the treatment of end-stage lung 
disease. As the number of lung transplants and transplant centers continues to 
rise, radiologists will more frequently participate in the care of patients 
undergoing lung transplant, both before and after transplant. Potential donors 
and recipients undergo chest radiography and CT as part of their pretransplant 
assessment to evaluate for contraindications to transplant and to aid in 
surgical planning. After transplant, recipients undergo imaging during the 
postoperative hospitalization and also in the long-term outpatient setting. 
Radiologists encounter a wide variety of conditions leading to end-stage lung 
disease and a myriad of posttransplant complications, some of which are unique 
to lung transplantation. Familiarity with these pathologic conditions, including 
their imaging findings and their temporal relationship to the transplant, is 
crucial to accurate radiologic interpretation. Knowledge of the surgical 
techniques and expected postoperative appearance prevents confusing normal 
posttransplant imaging findings with complications. A basic understanding of the 
indications, contraindications, and surgical considerations of lung transplant 
aids in imaging interpretation and protocoling and also facilitates 
communication between radiologists and transplant physicians. Despite medical 
and surgical advances over the past several decades, lung transplant recipients 
currently have an average posttransplant life expectancy of only 6.7 years. As 
members of the transplant team, radiologists can help maximize patient survival 
and hopefully increase posttransplant life expectancy and quality of life in the 
coming decades. ©RSNA, 2021 An invited commentary by Bierhals is available

Previous research has linked political ideology - right-wing authoritarianism 
and social dominance orientation - with more positive attitudes toward life 
extension. The purpose of this study was to investigate death attitudes and 
religious commitment as mediators of the relationship between political ideology 
and attitudes toward life extension. College students (N = 406) completed an 
online survey. One death attitude - neutral acceptance - and not religious 
commitment mediated the relationship between political ideology and attitudes 
toward life extension. Individuals with more intolerant political ideology may 
see death as aberrant and thus be more likely to embrace life extension 
technology.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is increasing in most high-income countries, but 
gains in life years are maximized if spent in good health and if cognitive 
abilities are maintained until old age. Age-related decline of cognitive 
abilities does nevertheless occur, but the pace of decline is decisive. This was 
the starting point for our study that aims to examine cohort effects of 
cognitive aging in women and men in Germany, Spain and Sweden by analyzing 
changes from 2004 to 2013 by estimating cohort effects within age groups 
starting from the age of 50 years.
METHODS: A cohort study was conducted that was based on data of the surveys 2004 
(N = 6,081) and 2013 (N = 8,650) from the Survey of Health, Ageing and 
Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The analyses were based on data of female and male 
respondents aged 50 years and older. Age-specific means of verbal fluency and 
delayed recall from the German, Spanish and Swedish samples were the cognitive 
domains considered in the study.
RESULTS: In both domains of cognitive ability the achievements in the later 
surveys were higher than in the earlier ones. This was found in all countries, 
abut achievement levels increased markedly in the German and the Spanish 
samples, while the scores of the Swedish samples were not significantly 
different. While the highest scores were found for Sweden, Germany ranked in the 
middle and the lowest scores were found in the Spanish samples. Over time, the 
scores of the German samples approached those of Sweden.
CONCLUSIONS: From the first to the second survey, improvements of older adults' 
cognitive abilities were found for all countries considered. This may indicate 
improvements of the underlying educational systems, but also increasingly 
stimulating general living conditions.

Sour has been studied almost exclusively as an aversive taste modality. Yet 
recent work in Drosophila demonstrates that specific carboxylic acids are 
attractive at ecologically relevant concentrations. Here, we demonstrate that 
lactic acid is an appetitive and energetic tastant, which stimulates feeding 
through activation of sweet gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs). This activation 
displays distinct, mechanistically separable stimulus onset and removal phases. 
Ionotropic receptor 25a (IR25a) primarily mediates the onset response, which 
shows specificity for the lactate anion and drives feeding initiation through 
proboscis extension. Conversely, sweet gustatory receptors (Gr64a-f) mediate a 
non-specific removal response to low pH that primarily impacts ingestion. While 
mutations in either receptor family have marginal impacts on feeding, lactic 
acid attraction is completely abolished in combined mutants. Thus, specific 
components of lactic acid are detected through two classes of receptors to 
activate a single set of sensory neurons in physiologically distinct ways, 
ultimately leading to robust behavioral attraction.

In 2020, the global prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 
was estimated to be 38 million, and a total of 690,000 people died from acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complications. Notably, around 12.6 
million people living with HIIV/AIDS did not have access to life-saving 
treatment. The advent of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the 
mid-1990s remarkably enhanced the life expectancy of people living with HIV/AIDS 
as a result of improved immune functions. However, HAART has several drawbacks, 
especially when it is not used properly, including a high risk for the 
development of drug resistance, as well as undesirable side effects such as 
lipodystrophy and endocrine dysfunctions, which result in HAART intolerability. 
HAART is also not curative. Furthermore, new HIV infections continue to occur 
globally at a high rate, with an estimated 1.7 million new infections occurring 
in 2018 alone. Therefore, there is still an urgent need for an affordable, 
effective, and readily available preventive vaccine against HIV/AIDS. Despite 
this urgent need, however, progress toward an effective HIV vaccine has been 
modest over the last four decades. Reasons for this slow progress are mainly 
associated with the unique aspects of HIV itself and its ability to rapidly 
mutate, targeting immune cells and escape host immune responses. Several 
approaches to an HIV vaccine have been undertaken. However, this review will 
mainly discuss progress made, including the pre-clinical and clinical trials 
involving vector-based HIV DNA vaccines and the use of integrating lentiviral 
vectors in HIV vaccine development. We concluded by recommending particularly 
the use of integrase-defective lentiviral vectors, owing to their safety 
profiles, as one of the promising vectors in HIV DNA vaccine strategies both for 
prophylactic and therapeutic HIV vaccines.

Business, University of Murcia, 30100 Murcia, Spain.

The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has left millions infected and dead around the 
world, with Latin America being one of the most affected areas. In this work, we 
have sought to determine, by means of a multiple regression analysis and a study 
of correlations, the influence of population density, life expectancy, and 
proportion of the population in vulnerable employment, together with GDP per 
capita, on the mortality rate due to COVID-19 in Latin American countries. The 
results indicated that countries with higher population density had lower 
numbers of deaths. Population in vulnerable employment and GDP showed a positive 
influence, while life expectancy did not appear to significantly affect the 
number of COVID-19 deaths. In addition, the influence of these variables on the 
number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was analyzed. It can be concluded that the 
lack of resources can be a major burden for the vulnerable population in 
combating COVID-19 and that population density can ensure better designed 
institutions and quality infrastructure to achieve social distancing and, 
together with effective measures, lower death rates.

An annotated photoplethysmogram (PPG) is required when evaluating PPG algorithms 
that have been developed to detect the onset and systolic peaks of PPG 
waveforms. However, few publicly accessible PPG datasets exist in which the 
onset and systolic peaks of the waveforms are annotated. Therefore, this study 
developed a MATLAB toolbox that stitches predetermined annotated PPGs in a 
random manner to generate a long, annotated PPG signal. With this toolbox, any 
combination of four annotated PPG templates that represent regular, irregular, 
fast rhythm, and noisy PPG waveforms can be stitched together to generate a 
long, annotated PPG. Furthermore, this toolbox can simulate real-life PPG 
signals by introducing different noise levels and PPG waveforms. The toolbox can 
implement two stitching methods: one based on the systolic peak and the other on 
the onset. Additionally, cubic spline interpolation is used to smooth the 
waveform around the stitching point, and a skewness index is used as a signal 
quality index to select the final signal output based on the stitching method 
used. The developed toolbox is free and open-source software, and a graphical 
user interface is provided. The method of synthesizing by stitching introduced 
in this paper is a data augmentation strategy that can help researchers 
significantly increase the size and diversity of annotated PPG signals available 
for training and testing different feature extraction algorithms.

Parasitic plants belonging to the Orobanchaceae family include species that 
cause heavy damage to crops in Mediterranean climate regions. Phelipanche 
aegyptiaca is the most common of the Orobanchaceae species in Israel inflicting 
heavy damage to a wide range of broadleaf crops, including processing tomatoes. 
P. aegyptiaca is extremely difficult to control due to its minute and vast 
number of seeds and its underground association with host plant roots. The 
highly efficient attachment of the parasite haustoria into the host phloem and 
xylem enables the diversion of water, assimilates and minerals from the host 
into the parasite. Drip irrigation is the most common method of irrigation in 
processing tomatoes in Israel, but the delivery of herbicides via drip 
irrigation systems (herbigation) has not been thoroughly studied. The aim of 
these studies was to test, under laboratory and greenhouse conditions, the 
factors involved in the behavior of soil-herbigated imazapic, and the 
consequential influence of imazapic on P. aegyptiaca and tomato plants. 
Dose-response Petri dish studies showed that imazapic does not impede P. 
aegyptiaca seed germination and non-attached seedlings, even at the high rate of 
5000 ppb. Imazapic applied to tomato roots inoculated with P. aegyptiaca seeds 
in a PE bag system revealed that the parasite is killed only after its 
attachment to the tomato roots, at concentrations as low as 2.5 ppb. Imazapic 
sorption curves and calculated Kd and Koc values indicated that the herbicide Kd 
is similar in all soils excluding a two-fold higher coefficient in the Gadash 
farm soil, while the Koc was similar in all soils except the Eden farm soil, in 
which it was more than twofold lower. In greenhouse studies, control of P. 
aegyptiaca was achieved at >2.5 ppb imazapic, but adequate control requires 
repeated applications due to the 7-day half-life (t1/2) of the herbicide in the 
soil. Tracking of imazapic in soil and tomato roots revealed that the herbicide 
accumulates in the tomato host plant roots, but its movement to newly formed 
roots is limited. The data obtained in the laboratory and greenhouse studies 
provide invaluable knowledge for devising field imazapic application strategies 
via drip irrigation systems for efficient and selective broomrape control.

Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of dabrafenib plus trametinib 
combination therapy versus vemurafenib as first-line treatment in patients with 
BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma from a 
healthcare system perspective in China. Methods: This study employed a 
partitioned survival model with three health states (progression-free survival, 
post-progression survival and dead) to parameterize the data derived from 
Combi-v trial and extrapolated to 30 years. Health states' utilities were 
measured by EQ-5D-3L, also sourced from the Combi-v trial. Costs including drug 
acquisition costs, disease management costs and adverse event costs were based 
on the Chinese Drug Bidding Database and physician survey in China. The primary 
outcomes of the model were lifetime costs, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted, 
respectively. Result: Dabrafenib plus trametinib is projected to increase a 
patient's life expectancy by 0.95 life-years over vemurafenib (3.03 vs. 2.08) 
and 1.09 QALY gains (2.48 vs. 1.39) with an incremental cost of $3833. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $3511 per QALY. In the 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses, at a threshold of $33,357 per QALY (three 
times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in China in 2020), the 
probability of dabrafenib plus trametinib being cost-effective was 90%. In the 
deterministic sensitivity analyses, the results were most sensitive to the 
dabrafenib plus trametinib drug costs, vemurafenib drug costs and discount rate 
of cost. Conclusion: Dabrafenib plus trametinib therapy yields more clinical 
benefits than vemurafenib. Using a threshold of $33,357 per QALY, dabrafenib 
plus trametinib is very cost-effective as compared with vemurafenib in China.

Role of Intestinal Ultrasound in the Management of Patients with Inflammatory 
Bowel Disease.

Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) has gained popularity as a first line technique for 
the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) 
due to its many advantages. It is a non-invasive imaging technique with 
non-ionizing radiation exposure. It can be easily performed not only by 
radiologists but also by trained gastroenterologists at outpatient clinics. In 
addition, the cost of IUS equipment is low when compared with other imaging 
techniques. IUS is an accurate technique to detect inflammatory lesions and 
complications in the bowel in patients with suspected or already known Crohn's 
disease (CD). Recent evidence indicates that IUS is a convenient and accurate 
technique to assess extension and activity in the colon in patients with 
ulcerative colitis (UC), and can be a non-invasive alternative to endoscopy. In 
patients with IBD, several non-specific pathological ultrasonographic signs can 
be identified: bowel wall thickening, alteration of the bowel wall echo-pattern, 
loss of bowel stratification, increased vascularization, decreased bowel 
peristalsis, fibro-fatty proliferation, enlarged lymph nodes, and/or abdominal 
free fluid. Considering the transmural CD inflammation, CD complications such as 
presence of strictures, fistulae, or abscesses can be detected. In patients with 
UC, where inflammation is limited to mucosa, luminal inflammatory 
ultrasonographic changes are similar to those of CD. As the technique is related 
to the operator's experience, adequate IUS training, performance in daily 
practice, and a generalized use of standardized parameters will help to increase 
its reproducibility.

Increased life expectancy in combination with modern life style and high 
prevalence of obesity are important risk factors for development of 
neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroinflammation is a feature of neurodegenerative 
diseases, and microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, are central 
players in it. The present review discusses the effects of obesity, chronic 
peripheral inflammation and obesity-associated metabolic and endocrine 
perturbations, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and increased 
glucocorticoid levels, on microglial function.

(1) Background and objectives: Due to increasing life expectancy, more than 
one-third of women's life can be spent in the postmenopausal period. In this 
period, women have different somatic, psychological, and urogenital symptoms. 
The present study was done to evaluate postmenopausal symptoms and their 
correlations among Saudi women attending different primary health centers. (2) 
Methods: adopting a cross-sectional study was done among 845 postmenopausal 
women attending different primary health centers. The menopause rating scale 
(MRS) was utilized to investigate the prevalence and severity of different 
menopausal manifestations. Data collection was done using a structured anonymous 
questionnaire disseminated during face-to-face interviews. Analysis of data was 
done utilizing the SPSS program, version 24. (3) Results: The total MRS score 
was 15.68 ± 6.85. The mean score of the subscales were: 5.56 ± 2.78 for the 
somatic domain, 6.04 ± 2.89 for the psychological domain, and 4.08 ± 2.32 for 
the urogenital domain. Joint and muscle pain (25.2%) and sleep problems (18.6%) 
were the most prevalent severe/very severe somatic symptoms. The most 
severe/very severe symptoms of the psychological domain were mental and physical 
exhaustion (20.2%) and depressed mode (19.2%), while that of the urogenital 
domain were sexual problems (20.1%) and bladder problems (16.3%). Significant 
predictors of the subscales of MRS were sociodemographic characteristics such as 
age, residence, marital status, educational level, and occupation. Furthermore, 
history of chronic diseases, parity, and menopause duration were significant 
predictors of the subscales of MRS. (4) Conclusion: women in the present study 
experience different postmenopausal symptoms. Health care providers should 
consider this crucial stage of women's life to help elderly women manage these 
different postmenopausal manifestations.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is more common among young women, although 
it frequently presents in older patients. Despite an aging population, there 
remains a paucity of data on the treatment of TNBC in elderly women. We 
conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and unpublished literature 
that captures the management and breast-cancer-specific survival (BCSS) of women 
≥70 years old with TNBC. Out of 739 papers, five studies met our inclusion 
criteria. In total, 2037 patients with TNBC treated between 1973 and 2014 were 
captured in the analysis. Women ≥70 years old were less likely to undergo 
surgical resection compared to those <70 (92.8% vs. 94.6%, p = 0.002). Adjuvant 
therapy, including radiation and chemotherapy, was also less likely to be 
utilized in women ≥70 years of age. These treatment differences were associated 
with more than a doubling of cancer-specific mortality in the elderly cohort 
(5.9% vs. 2.7% in ≤70 years old, p < 0.0001). Two of the five studies showed 
improved BCSS with adjuvant treatment while others showed no difference. Our 
systemic review questions the appropriateness of therapeutic de-escalation in 
this cohort and highlights the significant gap in our understanding of the 
optimal management for elderly patients with TNBC. Until more data are 
available, multidisciplinary treatment decision-making should carefully balance 
the available clinical evidence as well as the patient's predicted life 
expectancy and goals-of-care preferences.

Self-healing asphalt, which is designed to achieve autonomic damage repair in 
asphalt pavement, offers a great life-extension prospect and therefore not only 
reduces pavement maintenance costs but also saves energy and reduces CO2 
emissions. The combined asphalt self-healing system, incorporating both 
encapsulated rejuvenator and induction heating, can heal cracks with melted 
binder and aged binder rejuvenation, and the synergistic effect of the two 
technologies shows significant advantages in healing efficiency over the single 
self-healing method. This study explores the fatigue life extension prospect of 
the combined healing system in porous asphalt. To this aim, porous asphalt (PA) 
test specimens with various healing systems were prepared, including: (i) the 
capsule healing system, (ii) the induction healing system, (iii) the combined 
healing system and (iv) a reference system (without extrinsic healing). The 
fatigue properties of the PA samples were characterized by an indirect tensile 
fatigue test and a four-point bending fatigue test. Additionally, a 24-h rest 
period was designed to activate the built-in self-healing system(s) in the PA. 
Finally, a damaging and healing programme was employed to evaluate the fatigue 
damage healing efficiency of these systems. The results indicate that all these 
self-healing systems can extend the fatigue life of porous asphalt, while in the 
combined healing system, the gradual healing effect of the released rejuvenator 
from the capsules may contribute to a better induction healing effect in the 
damaging and healing cycles.

Neurodegenerative diseases are sociosanitary challenges of today, as a result of 
increased average life expectancy, with Alzheimer's disease being one of the 
most prevalent. This pathology is characterized by brain impairment linked to a 
neurodegenerative process culminating in cognitive decline and behavioral 
disorders. Though the etiology of this pathology is still unknown, it is usually 
associated with the appearance of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. 
The most used prophylaxis relies on anticholinesterase drugs and NMDA receptor 
antagonists, whose main action is to relieve symptoms and not to treat or 
prevent the disease. Currently, the scientific community is gathering efforts to 
disclose new natural compounds effective against Alzheimer's disease and other 
neurodegenerative pathologies. Marine natural products have been shown to be 
promising candidates, and some have been proven to exert a high neuroprotection 
effect, constituting a large reservoir of potential drugs and nutraceutical 
agents. The present article attempts to describe the processes of extraction and 
isolation of bioactive compounds derived from sponges, algae, marine bacteria, 
invertebrates, crustaceans, and tunicates as drug candidates against AD, with a 
focus on the success of pharmacological activity in the process of finding new 
and effective drug compounds.
