cost-effective than ESS with EFS or medical management. ESS without EFS compared 
to medical management yielded an ICER of $9,004/quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY). ESS with EFS compared to ESS without EFS yielded an ICER of 
$62,310/QALY. At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000/QALY, ESS 
without EFS was more cost-effective than ESS with EFS with 52.1% certainty. 
These results were robust to one-way analysis and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: ESS remains a cost-effective intervention compared to medical 
therapy alone for patients with CRSwNP. In this study, the addition of frontal 
sinusotomy during ESS for patients with CRSwNP was not found to be 
cost-effective at a WTP threshold of $50,000/QALY, but may be cost effective at 
a higher threshold of $100,000/QALY.

AIM: Associations between short sleep duration and obesity and the relationship 
between obesity and chronic illness are well documented. Obese children are 
likely to become obese adults. To date, there is a paucity of information 
regarding sleep duration and quality for Indigenous Australian people. It may be 
that poor-quality, short sleep is contributing to the gap in health outcomes for 
Indigenous people compared with non-Indigenous adults and children. This study 
sought to investigate the possibility that poor sleep quality may be 
contributing to health outcomes for Indigenous children by exploring 
associations between sleep duration and body mass index (BMI).
METHODS: Participants included 1253 children aged 7-12 years in Wave 7 of the 
national Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children survey. Interviewers asked 
primary carers about children's sleep times. BMI was derived from measurements 
of children made by researchers.
RESULTS: Regardless of age, relative socio-economic disadvantage and level of 
remoteness, unhealthy weight was associated with less sleep duration than 
healthy weight for Indigenous children.
CONCLUSION: The relationship between short sleep duration and BMI in Indigenous 
children has important implications for their future health outcomes. Both 
overweight conditions and short sleep are established modifiable risk factors 
for metabolic dysfunction and other chronic illnesses prominent in the 
Indigenous population. It is important to consider strategies to optimise both 
for Indigenous children in an attempt to help 'close the gap' in health outcomes 
and life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.

with their combined antiretroviral therapy.

Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.

OBJECTIVES: Thanks to the success of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), 
HIV-infected patients can have almost a normal life expectancy. This has 
resulted in an aging HIV-infected population with other chronic comorbidities 
such as cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, and depression. Our hypothesis is 
that patients' perceptions of and attitudes towards their cART, which is 
perceived as crucial to their survival, differ from their beliefs about their 
co-treatments, and this may have an impact on their medication adherence.
METHODS: We used the French version of the Beliefs about Medicine Questionnaire 
(BMQ-f) to measure the perceptions of patients about their co-treatments and the 
Beliefs about Medicine Questionnaire for Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy 
(BMQ-HAART) to measure their beliefs about their cART in a representative sample 
(n = 150) of patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and followed 
at the Infectious Disease Service at the University Hospital in Lausanne, 
Switzerland. The survey was administered to all eligible patients by the order 
of their scheduled appointments at the end of their medical visit. The BMQ 
comprises two subscores: Specific-Necessity (5 identical items in BMQ-f and 
BMQ-HAART) and Specific-Concerns (also 5 identical items in BMQ-f and 
BMQ-HAART). The subscores were standardized by dividing the score scale by the 
number of questions in the scale, resulting in a range of responses between 1 
(low) and 5 (high). Self-reported medication adherence was measured using the 
SHCS Adherence Questionnaire (SHCS-AQ). Adherence was defined as not missing any 
dose or missing one dose of the treatment in the past 4 weeks. Sociodemographic 
variables were retrieved by reviewing the SHCS database.
RESULTS: A response rate of 73% (109 of 150) was achieved. A total of 105 
patients were included in the analysis: their median age was 56 [interquartile 
range (IQR) 51, 63] years and 74 were male (70%). Eighty-seven patients (83%) 
were adherent to cART and 75 (71%) were adherent to their co-treatments 
(P = 0.0001). The standardized mean responses for the BMQ Specific-Necessity 
subscores were 4.46 [standard deviation (SD): 0.58] and 2.86 (SD: 1.02) for cART 
and co-treatments, respectively (P < 0.0001). For Specific-Concerns, the 
standardized mean responses were 2.9 (SD: 1.02) for cART and 4.09 (SD: 1.02) 
(P < 0.0001) for co-treatments. cART and co-treatment concerns increased as the 
number of co-treatments increased (P = 0.03 and P < 0.0001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients had higher Necessity and lower Concerns scores for their 
cART in comparison with their co-treatments. A higher percentage of patients 
reported being adherent to cART compared with the co-treatments that they 
reported they were most likely to miss. Further research using a bigger sample 
size and more objective measures of adherence is needed to explore the 
association between adherence and patients' perceptions.

Diverging Life Expectancies and Voting Patterns in the 2016 US Presidential 
Election.

University School of Public Health, Boston, MA.

OBJECTIVES: To assess whether voting patterns in the 2016 US presidential 
election were correlated with long-run trends in county life expectancy.
METHODS: I examined county-level voting data from the 2008 and 2016 presidential 
elections and assessed Donald Trump's share of the 2016 vote, change in the 
Republican vote share between 2008 and 2016, and changes in absolute numbers of 
Democratic and Republican votes. County-level estimates of life expectancy at 
birth were obtained for 1980 and 2014 from the Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation.
RESULTS: Changes in county life expectancy from 1980 to 2014 were strongly 
negatively associated with Trump's vote share, with less support for Trump in 
counties experiencing greater survival gains. Counties in which life expectancy 
stagnated or declined saw a 10-percentage-point increase in the Republican vote 
share between 2008 and 2016.
CONCLUSIONS: Residents of counties left out from broader life expectancy gains 
abandoned the Democratic Party in the 2016 presidential election. Since coming 
to power, the Trump administration has proposed cuts to health insurance for the 
poor, social programs, health research, and environmental and worker 
protections, which are key determinants of population health. Health gaps likely 
will continue to widen without significant public investment in population 
health.

Life expectancy (LE) based on a period life table (PLT) traditionally serves as 
a general population summary metric. It is, however, becoming more frequently 
reported for chronically afflicted subpopulations. In general populations, there 
is always an obvious real cohort sharing the hypothetical PLT cohort 
characteristics, and the LE estimate is intuitively understood as that real 
cohort mean survival time, assuming constancy of death risks. In diseased 
subpopulations, the correspondence between the hypothetical cohort and a real 
cohort is not straightforward. Furthermore, the excess mortality of chronic 
diseases usually changes according to age at onset and time since onset. The 
standard PLT method does not allow for proper control of these issues, so the LE 
estimate can only be deemed valid under specific assumptions. Without clear 
statements about the real cohort to whom the estimate is intended and the 
assumptions allowing disregard of the effect of age at onset and time since 
onset, LEs of afflicted subpopulations computed with the PLT are only abstract 
numbers summarizing mortality rates. If called "life expectancy," they can be 
seriously misleading. The same applies to health-adjusted LE.

OBJECTIVES: To assess years of life lost to each cause of death in the United 
States between 1995 and 2015, and compare it with the number of deaths.
METHODS: We used Vital Statistics mortality data and defined "life-years lost" 
as remaining life expectancy for each decedent's age, sex, and race. We 
calculated the share of life-years lost to each cause of death in each year, and 
examined reasons for changes.
RESULTS: In 2015, heart disease caused the most deaths, but cancer caused 23% 
more life-years lost. Life-years lost to heart disease declined 6% since 1995, 
whereas life-years lost to cancer increased 16%. The increase for cancer was 
entirely attributable to population growth and longer life expectancy; had these 
factors remained constant, life-years lost to heart disease and cancer would 
have fallen 56% and 38%, respectively. Accidents (including overdoses), 
suicides, and homicides each caused twice the share of life-years lost as 
deaths. Measuring life-years lost highlighted racial disparities in heart 
disease, homicides, and perinatal conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Life-years lost may provide additional context for understanding 
long-term mortality trends.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a community-based patient 
navigation program to improve cervical cancer screening among Hispanic women 18 
or older in San Antonio, Texas.
STUDY DESIGN: We used a microsimulation model of cervical cancer to project the 
long-term cost-effectiveness of a community-based patient navigation program 
compared with current practice.
METHODS: We used program data from 2012 to 2015 and published data from the 
existing literature as model input. Taking a societal perspective, we estimated 
the lifetime costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life-years and 
conducted 2-way sensitivity analyses to account for parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: The patient navigation program resulted in a per-capita gain of 0.2 
years of life expectancy. The program was highly cost-effective relative to no 
intervention (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $748). The program costs 
would have to increase up to 10 times from $311 for it not to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The 3-year community-based patient navigation program effectively 
increased cervical cancer screening uptake and adherence and improved the 
cost-effectiveness of the screening program for Hispanic women 18 years or older 
in San Antonio, Texas. Future research is needed to translate and disseminate 
the patient navigation program to other socioeconomic and demographic groups to 
test its robustness and design.

Pathways to pulmonary hypertension in sickle cell disease: the search for 
prevention and early intervention.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) develops in a significant number of patients with 
sickle cell disease (SCD), resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. This 
review focuses on PH pathophysiology, risk stratification, and new 
recommendations for screening and treatment for patients with SCD. Areas 
covered: An extensive PubMed literature search was performed. While the 
pathophysiology of PH in SCD is yet to be fully deciphered, it is known that the 
etiology is multifactorial; hemolysis, hypercoagulability, hypoxemia, 
ischemic-reperfusion injury, oxidative stress, and genetic susceptibility all 
contribute in varying degrees to endothelial dysfunction. Hemolysis, in 
particular, seems to play a key role by inciting an imbalance in the regulatory 
axis of nitric oxide and arginine metabolism. Systematic risk stratification 
starting in childhood based on clinical features and biomarkers that enable 
early detection is necessary. Multi-faceted, targeted interventions, before 
irreversible vasculopathy develops, will allow for improved patient outcomes and 
life expectancy. Expert commentary: Despite progress in our understanding of PH 
in SCD, clinically proven therapies remain elusive and additional controlled 
clinical trials are needed. Prevention of disease starts in childhood, a 
critical window for intervention. Given the complex and multifactorial nature of 
SCD, patients will ultimately benefit from combination therapies that 
simultaneously targets multiple mechanisms.

CONTEXT: The health and economic burden of hypertension, a major risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease, is substantial. This systematic review evaluated the 
economic evidence of self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) monitoring 
interventions to control hypertension.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The literature search from database inception to March 
2015 identified 22 studies for inclusion with three types of interventions: SMBP 
used alone, SMBP with additional support, and SMBP within team-based care (TBC). 
Two formulae were used to convert reductions in systolic BP (SBP) to 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to produce cost per QALY saved. All analyses 
were conducted in 2015, with estimates adjusted to 2014 U.S. dollars.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Median costs of intervention were $60 and $174 per person 
for SMBP alone and SMBP with additional support, respectively, and $732 per 
person per year for SMBP within TBC. SMBP alone and SMBP with additional support 
reduced healthcare cost per person per year from outpatient visits and 
medication (medians $148 and $3, respectively; median follow-up, 12-13 months). 
SMBP within TBC exhibited an increase in healthcare cost (median, $369 per 
person per year; median follow-up, 18 months). SMBP alone varied from cost 
saving to a maximum cost of $144,000 per QALY saved, with two studies reporting 
an increase in SBP. The two translated median costs per QALY saved were $2,800 
and $4,000 for SMBP with additional support and $7,500 and $10,800 for SMBP 
within TBC.
CONCLUSIONS: SMBP monitoring interventions with additional support or within TBC 
are cost effective. Cost effectiveness of SMBP used alone could not be 
determined.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to show whether and how levels, trends 
and patterns obtained from estimates of premature deaths from adverse effects 
(AEs) of medical treatment depended on the deprivation level in England over the 
24-year period, 1990-2013. We provide a report to inform decision-making 
strategies to reduce the burden of disease arising from AEs of medical treatment 
in the most deprived areas of the country.
METHODS: Comparative analysis was driven by a single cause-of-injury 
category-AEs of medical treatment-from the Global Burden of Disease 2013 study. 
We report the mean values with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for five 
socioeconomic deprivation areas of England.
RESULTS: In the most deprived areas of England, the death rate declined from 
2.27 (95% UI 1.65 to 2.57) to 1.54 (1.28 to 2.08) deaths (32.16% change). The 
death rate in the least deprived areas was 1.22 (0.88 to 1.38) in 1990; it was 
1.17 (0.97 to 1.59) in 2013 (4.1% change). Regarding disability-adjusted life 
year (DALY) rates, the same trend is observed. Although the gap between the most 
deprived and least deprived populations of England narrowed with regards to 
number of deaths, and rates of deaths and DALYs from AEs of medical treatment, 
inequalities between marginal levels of deprivation remain.
CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that a relationship between deprivation level 
and health loss from the AEs of medical treatment across England is possible. 
This could then be used when devising and prioritising health policies and 
strategies.

OBJECTIVE: The clinical effectiveness of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy 
(TARGIT-IORT) has been confirmed in the randomised TARGIT-A (targeted 
intraoperative radiotherapy-alone) trial to be similar to a several weeks' 
course of whole-breast external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in patients with 
early breast cancer. This study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
TARGIT-IORT to inform policy decisions about its wider implementation.
SETTING: TARGIT-A randomised clinical trial (ISRCTN34086741) which compared 
TARGIT with traditional EBRT and found similar breast cancer control, 
particularly when TARGIT was given simultaneously with lumpectomy.
METHODS: Cost-utility analysis using decision analytic modelling by a Markov 
model. A cost-effectiveness Markov model was developed using TreeAge Pro V.2015. 
The decision analytic model compared two strategies of radiotherapy for breast 
cancer in a hypothetical cohort of patients with early breast cancer based on 
the published health state transition probability data from the TARGIT-A trial. 
Analysis was performed for UK setting and National Health Service (NHS) 
healthcare payer's perspective using NHS cost data and treatment outcomes were 
simulated for both strategies for a time horizon of 10 years. Model health state 
utilities were drawn from the published literature. Future costs and effects 
were discounted at the rate of 3.5%. To address uncertainty, one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, TARGIT-IORT was a highly cost-effective 
strategy yielding health gain at a lower cost than its comparator EBRT. 
Discounted TARGIT-IORT and EBRT costs for the time horizon of 10 years were £12 
455 and £13 280, respectively. TARGIT-IORT gained 0.18 incremental QALY as the 
discounted QALYs gained by TARGIT-IORT were 8.15 and by EBRT were 7.97 showing 
TARGIT-IORT as a dominant strategy over EBRT. Model outputs were robust to 
one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: TARGIT-IORT is a dominant strategy over EBRT, being less costly and 
producing higher QALY gain.

OBJECTIVE Translabyrinthine resection is one of a number of treatment options 
available to patients with vestibular schwannomas. Though this procedure is 
hearing destructive, the authors have noted excellent clinical outcomes for 
patients with small tumors. The authors review their experience at a tertiary 
acoustic neuroma referral center in using the translabyrinthine approach to 
resect small vestibular schwannomas. All operations were performed by a surgical 
team consisting of a single neurosurgeon and 1 of 7 neurotologists. METHODS Data 
from a prospectively maintained clinical database were extracted and reviewed. 
Consecutive patients with a preoperative diagnosis of vestibular schwannoma that 
had less than 1 cm of extension into the cerebellopontine angle, operated on 
between 2008 and 2013, were included. Patents with neurofibromatosis Type 2, 
previous treatment, or preexisting facial weakness were excluded. In total, 107 
patients were identified, 74.7% of whom had poor hearing preoperatively. RESULTS 
Pathologically, 6.5% of patients were found to have a tumor other than 
vestibular schwannoma. Excluding two malignancies, the tumor control rates were 
98.7%, as defined by absence of radiographic disease, and 99.0%, as defined by 
no need for additional treatment. Facial nerve outcome was normal 
(House-Brackmann Grade I) in 97.2% of patients and good (House-Brackmann Grade 
I-II) in 99.1%. Complications were cerebrospinal fluid leak (4.7%) and sigmoid 
sinus thrombosis (0.9%), none of which led to long-term sequelae. CONCLUSIONS 
Translabyrinthine resection of small vestibular schwannomas provides excellent 
results in terms of complication avoidance, tumor control, and facial nerve 
outcomes. This is a hearing-destructive operation that is advocated for selected 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are a leading cause of premature 
mortality, mainly in low- and middle-income countries Objective: To estimate the 
2014 burden of RTIs in Mexico calculating years of life lost (YLL) and 
age-standardized YLL rates (ASYLL), and to evaluate sex, age, and region-related 
differences in premature mortality.
METHODS: Mortality data were obtained from the National Institute of Statistics 
and Geography and 14,637 deaths of individuals 15 years of age and older were 
analyzed. The YLL and ASYLL were computed.
RESULTS: The overall burden of RTIs was 332,922 YLL and 82.4% of the deaths 
occurred in males. Males from 25 to 34 years of age and females from 15 to 
24 years of age showed the highest age-adjusted YLL rates (933 and 158 YLL per 
100,000 inhabitants, respectively). The national ASYLL rate was 416 per 100,000 
inhabitants and the highest state-stratified mortality rates were observed in 
Tabasco (851), Sinaloa (709), Durango (656), Zacatecas (642), and Baja 
California Sur (570).
CONCLUSIONS: RTIs contributed to the premature mortality rate in the study 
population. Our findings may be useful from a health policy perspective for 
designing and prioritizing interventions focused on the prevention of premature 
loss of life.

in Adult Patient Populations.

Tube feeding (TF) is the most common form of nutrition support. In recent years, 
TF administration has increased among patient populations within and outside 
hospital settings, in part due to greater insurance coverage, reduced use of 
parenteral nutrition, and improved formularies suitable for sole source 
nutrition. With increasing life expectancy and improved access to TFs, the 
number of adults dependent on enteral nutrition is expected to grow. However, 
enteral TF intolerance (ETFI) is the most common complication of TFs, typically 
presenting with at least 1 adverse gastrointestinal event, including nausea, 
diarrhea, and constipation. ETFI often leads to reductions in TF volume with 
associated energy and protein deficits. Potentially ensuing malnutrition is a 
major public health concern due its effects on increased risk of morbidity and 
mortality, infections, prolonged hospital length of stay, and higher healthcare 
costs. As such, there is a need for intervention strategies to prevent and 
reduce ETFI. Incorporating whole foods with bioactive properties is a promising 
strategy. Emerging research has elucidated bioactive properties of whole foods 
with specific benefits for the prevention and management of adverse 
gastrointestinal events commonly associated with TFs. However, lack of 
evidence-based recommendations and technological challenges have limited the use 
of such foods in commercial TF formulas. This review addresses research gaps by 
discussing 5 whole foods (rhubarb, banana, curcumin, peppermint oil, and ginger) 
with bioactive attributes identified through literature searches and clinical 
experience as having substantial scientific rationale to consider their 
application for ETFI in adult populations.

BACKGROUND: Population is aging rapidly in Europe. Older age life expectancy 
(OLE) can be influenced by country-level depth of credit information (DCI) as an 
indicator of financial crisis, gross national income (GNI) per capita, and 
gender inequality index (GII). These factors are key indicators of 
socio-ecological inequality. They can be used to develop strategies to reduce 
country-level health disparity. The objective of this study was to confirm the 
relationship between socio-ecological factors and OLE in Europe.
METHODS: Data were obtained from World Bank, WHO, and UN database for 34 Europe 
countries. Associations between socio-ecological factors and OLE were assessed 
with Pearson correlation coefficients and three regression models. These models 
assumed that appropriate changes in country-level strategies of healthy aging 
would produce changes in GNI per capital as personal perspective, GII in social 
environment perspective, and DCI in public policy perspective to implement 
socio-ecological changes. Hierarchal linear regression was used for final 
analysis.
RESULTS: Although OLE (women and men) had significant negative correlation with 
GII (gender inequality index, r = - 0.798, p = 0.001), it had positive 
correlations with GNI (gross national income per capita, r = 0.834, p = 0.001) 
and DCI (depth of credit information index, r = 0.704, p = 0.001) levels caused 
by financial crisis. Higher levels GNI and DCI but lower GII were found to be 
predictors of OLE (women and men) (R2 = 0.804, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Factors affecting older age life expectancy in Europe were 
identified from socio-ecological perspective. Socio-ecological indicators (GII, 
GNI, and DCI) in Europe appear to have a latent effect on OLE levels. Thus, 
country-level strategies of successful aging in Europe should target 
socio-ecological factors such as GII, GNI, and DCI value.

INTRODUCTION: Emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the culprit 
lesion for patients with acute myocardial infarctions is an accepted practice. A 
majority of patients present with multivessel disease with additional relevant 
stenoses apart from the culprit lesion. In haemodynamically stable patients, 
there is increasing evidence from randomised trials to support the practice of 
immediate complete revascularisation. However, in the presence of cardiogenic 
shock, the optimal management strategy for additional non-culprit lesions is 
unknown. A multicentre randomised controlled trial, CULPRIT-SHOCK, is examining 
whether culprit vessel only PCI with potentially subsequent staged 
revascularisation is more effective than immediate multivessel PCI. This paper 
describes the intended economic evaluation of the trial.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The economic evaluation will be conducted using a 
pre-trial decision model and within-trial analysis. The modelling-based analysis 
will provide expected costs and health outcomes, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio over the lifetime for the cohort of patients included 
in the trial. The within-trial analysis will provide estimates of cost per life 
saved at 30 days and in 1 year, and estimates of health-related quality of life. 
Bootstrapping and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be used to 
address any uncertainty around these estimates. Different types of regression 
models within a generalised estimating equation framework will be used to 
examine how the total cost and quality-adjusted life years are explained by 
patients' characteristics, revascularisation strategy, country and centre. The 
cost-effectiveness analysis will be from the perspective of each country's 
national health services, where costs will be expressed in euros adjusted for 
purchasing power parity.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the study was granted by the 
local Ethics Committee at each recruiting centre. The economic evaluation 
analyses will be published in peer-reviewed journals of the concerned literature 
and communicated through the profiles of the authors at www.twitter.com and

We conducted a study of 19 biology instructors participating in small, local 
groups at six research-intensive universities connected to the Automated 
Analysis of Constructed Response (AACR) project (www.msu.edu/∼aacr). Our aim was 
to uncover participants' motivation to persist in a long-term teaching 
professional development effort, a topic that is understudied in 
discipline-based educational research. We interviewed each participant twice 
over a 2-year period and conducted qualitative analyses on the data, using 
expectancy-value theory as a framework for considering motivation. Our analyses 
revealed that motivation among instructors was high due to their enjoyment of 
the AACR groups. The high level of motivation is further explained by the fact 
that AACR groups facilitated instructor involvement with the larger AACR 
project. We also found that group dynamics encouraged persistence; instructors 
thought they might never talk with colleagues about teaching in the absence of 
AACR groups; and groups were perceived to have a low-enough time requirement to 
warrant sustained involvement. We conclude that instructors have persisted in 
AACR groups because the groups provided great value with limited cost. The 
characterization of instructor experiences described here can contribute to a 
better understanding of faculty needs in teaching professional development.

The aim of the study is an evaluation of years of life lost by inhabitants of 
Poland according to the most important causes of mortality and identification of 
trends in the period 2000-2014. The study material included a database which 
contained information gathered from 5,601,568 death certificates of inhabitants 
of Poland. In order to calculate years of life lost, the SEYLLp index (Standard 
Expected Years of Life Lost per living person) was applied. We also calculated 
AAPC (Average Annual Percentage Change). The SEYLLp index (per 10,000 
population) in Poland decreased from 2503.4 in 2000 to 2193.2 in 2014 among 
males (AAPC = -0.8%, p < 0.05) and from 1430.2 in 2000 to 1269.4 in 2014 among 
females (AAPC = -0.6%, p < 0.05). In 2014, the top 5 causes of years of life 
lost were: cardiovascular diseases (721.4 per 10,000 males and 475.6 per 10,000 
females), malignant tumours (575.5 and 418.3), unintentional injuries (202.2 and 
46.8), intentional injuries (114.6 and 16.3) and digestive diseases (120.2 and 
58.3). Due to negative trends, there is a need to implement preventative 
measures, aimed at reducing mortality caused by respiratory infections in both 
males and females, malignant tumours in females and diabetes mellitus and 
intentional injuries in males.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines advocate no prophylactic dissection of the 
lateral neck compartment for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) without clinical 
evidence of lateral neck metastasis (cN1b). However, lateral neck recurrence can 
affect patient treatment outcomes and quality of life. Therefore, this study 
examined the risk factors for lateral neck recurrence after the definitive 
treatment of PTC without cN1b.
METHODS: The study enrolled 1928 consecutive patients who underwent total 
thyroidectomy between 2006 and 2012 for PTC without cN1b. Logistic regression 
analysis was used to identify the relationship of clinicopathologic factors with 
lateral neck recurrence. Uni- and multivariate Cox-proportional hazards 
regression analyses were used to identify factors predictive of lateral neck 
recurrence-free survival (LRFS).
RESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 94 months (range, 24-133 months), 
lateral neck recurrence occurred in 47 patients (2.4%). Binary logistic 
regression showed that tumor size (>2 cm), multifocality, clinical central neck 
metastasis (cN1a), number of positive lymph nodes (LNs, >5), and LN ratio (>0.5) 
were significantly associated with lateral neck recurrence (P < 0.05). 
Multivariate analyses showed that multifocality (hazards ratio [HR], 2.338; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.126-4.858; P = 0.023), cN1a (HR, 5.301; 95% CI, 
2.416-11.630; P < 0.001), LN ratio (HR, 2.628; 95% CI, 1.228-5.626; P = 0.013), 
extranodal extension (HR, 2.570; 95% CI, 1.063-6.213; P = 0.036), and MACIS 
(distant metastasis, patient age, completeness of resection, local invasion and 
tumour size) score (HR, 2.513; 95% CI, 1.211-5.216; P = 0.013) were independent 
factors for LRFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Lateral neck recurrence after thyroidectomy is predicted by the 
clinicopathologic factors of multifocality, cN1a, LN ratio, extranodal 
extension, and MACIS score in N0/N1a PTC patients.

More than 2,400 continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are 
implanted each year in the United States alone. Both the number of patients 
living with LVADs and the life expectancy of these patients are increasing. As a 
result, patients with LVADs are increasingly encountered by non-LVAD specialists 
who do not have training in managing advanced heart failure for general medical 
care, cardiovascular procedures, and other subspecialty care. An understanding 
of the initial evaluation and management of patients with LVADs is now an 
essential skill for many health care providers. In this State-of-the-Art Review, 
we discuss current LVAD technology, summarize our clinical experience with 
LVADs, and review the current data for the medical management of patients living 
with LVADs.

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed patient and physician perceptions of heart 
failure (HF) disease severity and treatment options.
BACKGROUND: The prognosis for ambulatory patients with advanced HF on medical 
therapy is uncertain, yet has important implications for decision making 
regarding transplantation and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement.
METHODS: Ambulatory patients with advanced HF (New York Heart Association 
functional class III to IV, Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted 
Circulatory Support profiles 4 to 7) on optimized medical therapy were enrolled 
across 11 centers. At baseline, treating cardiologists rated patients for 
perceived risk for transplant, LVAD, or death in the upcoming year. Patients 
were also surveyed about their own perceptions of life expectancy and 
willingness to undergo various interventions.
RESULTS: At enrollment, physicians regarded 111 of 161 patients (69%) of the 
total cohort to be at high risk for transplant, LVAD, or death, whereas only 23 
patients (14%) felt they were at high risk. After a mean follow-up of 13 months, 
61 patients (38%) experienced an endpoint of 33 deaths (21%), 13 transplants 
(8%), and 15 LVAD implants (9%). There was poor discrimination between risk 
prediction among both patients and physicians. Among physician-identified 
high-risk patients, 77% described willingness to consider LVAD, but 63% 
indicated that they would decline 1 or more other simpler forms of 
life-sustaining therapy such as ventilation, dialysis, or a feeding tube.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced HF, physicians identified most to be 
at high risk for transplantation, LVAD, or death, whereas few patients 
recognized themselves to be at high risk. Patients expressed inconsistent 
attitudes toward lifesaving treatments, possibly indicating poor understanding 
of these therapies. Educational interventions regarding disease severity and 
treatment options should be introduced prior to the need for advanced therapies 
such as intravenous inotropic therapy, transplantation, or LVAD.
