low-educated groups in Spain.
METHODS: We use sex-, age-, education- and cause-specific mortality and 
population data for individuals aged 30 and over for 2016-19 in Spain. We 
estimated life expectancies, and standard deviations of the age-at-death 
distribution (lifespan variation), and we disentangled the contribution of 
age-causes of death to educational differences in both indicators.
FINDINGS: Life expectancy at age 30 was higher for high-educated groups compared 
to low-educated groups, 5.5 years for males and 3.0 years for females. Lifespan 
variation was higher for low-educated groups compared to high-educated groups, 
2.9 years for males and 2.2 years for females. The main contributors to the life 
expectancy gaps in males were lung cancer (0.58 years) and ischaemic heart 
diseases (0.42 years), and in females were other cardiovascular causes (0.26 
years), and ischaemic heart diseases (0.22 years). The main contributors to the 
lifespan variation gaps were in males lung cancer (-0.25 years) and ischaemic 
heart diseases (-0.22 years), while in females were other neoplasms and other 
diseases of the nervous system.
INTERPRETATION: Whereas behavioural causes are more important in explaining 
educational inequalities in mortality among men, ageing-related causes of death 
seem more important among women. Attempts at narrowing socioeconomic gaps in 
mortality may benefit from applying gender-specific preventive policy measures.

BACKGROUND: With the advent of antiretroviral treatment (ART), human 
immunodeficiency virus/AIDS has become a chronic manageable disease. Though life 
expectancy has improved, it brings alongside effects of long-term medical 
treatment. One of the major side effects is body dysmorphism, which leads to 
esthetic problems. Problems of lipodystrophy (LDS), especially facial 
lipoatrophy as well as facial and upper back lipohypertrophy are perceived by 
patients as highly stigmatizing manifestations of their human immunodeficiency 
virus infection. It has been reported to affect mood and quality of life, as 
well as reduced adherence to antiretroviral medications. Patients feel 
discomfort while sleeping, dressing, and during day-to-day activities.
AIM: The aim of this study was to test a relatively cost-effective and 
efficacious treatment modality for long-standing ART-associated lipohypertrophy 
of the submental fat and dorsocervical fat.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective open-label clinical study, in 
which 21 patients on regular ART with associated lipohypertrophy were enrolled 
in this open-label study. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) was given intralesionally once 
every 4-6 weeks. Patients were assessed for response, any adverse events, and 
patient satisfaction during every visit.
RESULTS: Intralesional DCA seems to be a promising treatment modality for 
long-standing ART-induced LDS with better cost-benefit in comparison with 
surgical interventions.
LIMITATIONS: It was a small-sized sample that was studied. The lag time between 
starting the treatment and optimum results was long in comparison with 
liposuction. The result is better appreciated at the end of treatment rather 
than after every session implying that it has a cumulative effect. Neither pre- 
and post-ultrasonography nor metric documentation was done.
CONCLUSIONS: Intralesional DCA seems to be a promising treatment modality for 
long-standing ART-induced LDS with better cost-benefit in comparison with 
surgical interventions.

BACKGROUND: The Ross procedure has demonstrated excellent long-term results, 
with restoration of life-expectancy in patients with severe aortic valve 
dysfunction. However, reintervention after Ross can occur, and herein we 
describe our center's experience with redo surgery after previous Ross 
procedures.
METHODS: We searched our prospective database for aortic valve-repair and 
recruited all adult (≥18 years) patients who have undergone valve-sparing root 
replacements (VSRRs) and/or aortic valve-repair after Ross procedure between 
July 2001 and July 2022. Univariable logistic regression analysis was performed 
to identify variables affecting early mortality. Survival, 
freedom-from-valve-reintervention and freedom-from-aortic regurgitation (AR) 
grade ≥3 were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were recruited for this study. Indication for 
reoperation after Ross was aortic aneurysm without AR in 17 (27%), aortic 
aneurysm with AR in 27 (43%), and isolated AR in 19 (30%) patients. Median 
follow-up time was 7.82 years. The majority of patients (76%) had undergone the 
free root technique during their index Ross operation. Cumulative survival, 
after redo surgery following Ross, was 98.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 
89.3-99.8%] at 1 year, 96.3% (95% CI: 88.2-98.3%) at 5 years, and 92.4% (95% CI: 
87.1-98.0%) at 10 years. Freedom-from-reoperation on the aortic valve at 1 year 
was 98.4% (95% CI: 97.0-99.8%), at 5 years was 96.7% (95% CI: 87.6-99.0%), and 
79.7% (95% CI: 71.1-88.3%) at 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival after redo surgery following the Ross operation 
is excellent. The data support our aggressive valve-sparing approach after Ross.

Background Particulate matter (PM) pollution is a significant risk factor for 
cardiovascular diseases, causing substantial disease burden and deaths 
worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the global burden of cardiovascular 
diseases attributed to PM from 1990 to 2019. Methods and Results We used the GBD 
(Global Burden of Disease) study 2019 to investigate disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability 
(YLDs), and deaths attributed to PM as well as its subgroups. It was shown that 
all burden measures' age-standardized rates for PM were in the same decreasing 
trend, with the highest decline recorded for deaths (-36.7%). However, the 
all-age DALYs increased by 31%, reaching 8.9 million in 2019, to which YLLs 
contributed the most (8.2 million [95% uncertainty interval, 7.3 million-9.2 
million]). Men had higher deaths, DALYs, and YLLs despite lower years lived with 
disability in 2019 compared with women. There was an 8.1% increase in the 
age-standardized rate of DALYs for ambient PM; however, household air pollution 
from solid fuels decreased by 65.4% in the assessed period. Although higher in 
men, the low and high sociodemographic index regions had the highest and lowest 
attributed YLLs/YLDs ratio for PM pollution in 2019, respectively. Conclusions 
Although the total age-standardized rate of DALYs for PM-attributed 
cardiovascular diseases diminished from 1990 to 2019, the global burden of PM on 
cardiovascular diseases has increased. The differences between men and women and 
between regions have clinical and policy implications in global health planning 
toward more exact funding and resource allocation, in addition to addressing 
inequity in health care access.

Malignant psoas syndrome is a rare and under-recognised entity with a life 
expectancy of months. Its presentation is characterised by refractory back pain, 
which is a red flag that should raise suspicion about the condition. We present 
a case of a man who presented with refractory back pain and bilateral 
hydronephrosis without hydroureter who had no evident initial obstruction and 
showed stent-placement failure. Three months later, a recurrence of colorectal 
cancer associated with malignant psoas syndrome was diagnosed. We review the 
current literature on malignant psoas syndrome and hydronephrosis in relation to 
the presentation of cancer.

Neurodegenerative disorders have a devastating disease course and an increasing 
prevalence due to prolonged life expectancy. In the last decades, it has become 
increasingly clear that these diseases often start much earlier, before the 
onset of symptoms, creating a potential window for pre-symptomatic treatment, a 
strategy that is desirable from both the biologic and the ethical point of view. 
However, studying treatments for a pre-symptomatic population presents objective 
difficulties. This article intends to give a perspective about opportunities and 
challenges of pre-symptomatic prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. Besides 
the requirement for biomarkers that would facilitate both the selection of study 
population and demonstrating a treatment effect, further considerations about 
balancing benefits, risks and uncertainties pertaining a pre-symptomatic 
population will be examined.

Unsafe sex has become a public safety problem that endangers society, and 
research on deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) related to unsafe 
sex is valuable for global policy-making. We aimed to estimate the deaths and 
DALYs attributable to unsafe sex by country, gender, age group, and 
sociodemographic status from 1990 to 2019. We extracted data on disease burden 
from the Global Disease Burden 2019 (GBD 2019) database for unsafe sex, 
including deaths, DALYs and age-standardized rates (ASRs). Comparative analyses 
were performed on data about deaths, DALYs and the responding ASRs attributable 
to unsafe sex in different countries and regions using the Social Demographic 
Index (SDI). The global age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and 
age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) attributable to unsafe sex were 11.98 (95% 
uncertainty intervals (UI): 10.97-13.52) per 100,000 people and 570.78 (95% UI: 
510.24-658.10) per 100,000 people, respectively. Both the ASMRs and ASDRs were 
the highest in southern sub-Saharan Africa and lowest in Australasia and 
decreased with increasing SDI levels. About unsafe-sex-related disease, HIV/AIDS 
has the highest ASMR [8.48 (95% UI: 7.62-9.95)/100,000 people] and ASDR [447.44 
(95% UI: 394.82-533.10)/100,000 people], followed by Cervical cancer [ASMR: 3.40 
(95% UI: 2.90-3.81)/100,000 people and ASDR: 107.2 (95% UI: 
90.52-119.43)/100,000 people] and sexually transmitted infections excluding HIV 
[ASMR: 0.10 (95% UI: 0.08-0.11)/100,000 people and ASDR: 16.14 (95% UI: 
10.51-25.83)/100,000 people]. The death and DALY burden caused by these three 
diseases were more serious in the over 75 years old age group. The 40-44 age 
group for men and the 35-39 age group for women had the highest population of 
unsafe sex-related deaths and DALYs, respectively. In addition, the burden of 
unsafe sex in women was more serious than those in men. Unsafe sex is an 
important risk factor for global disease burden and a leading cause of 
substantial health loss. We found that the risk of ASMRs and ASDRs attributable 
to unsafe sex had negative correlation with SDI levels. These results 
demonstrate that the need for revised policies that focus on efforts to reduce 
overall unsafe sex worldwide.

A carbon emission factor (CEF) database is required for the basis of carbon 
emission calculation in construction projects. However, the default values for 
existing CEF databases cannot cover the complex resources involved in a 
construction project. Therefore, this paper proposes a three-step method to 
guide the establishment of an extensible CEF database for the construction 
industry, including (1) data collection and parser, (2) data extension, and (3) 
data encoding and storage. The data extension mechanisms provide the supply 
chain perspective considering temporal issues and the accounting perspective to 
streamline the process. Aiming to address the lack of a comprehensive CEF 
database for the construction industry in China, this paper uses this method to 
establish a carbon emission factor database for the Chinese construction 
industry (CEFD for CCI). This database is open and free with 646 CEFs, including 
five parts: energy, human, material, machinery, and greenspace. This paper 
provides a way for developing and less developed countries to establish an 
expandable CEF database, which benefits the parser, extension, encoding, and 
storage of new resources, as well as computer access.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on life expectancy 
at birth (e0) for 51 Asian countries and territories from January 1, 2020 to 
December 31, 2021.
METHOD: Based on age-sex-specific mortality used for estimating the changes in 
e0 for years 2019, 2020, and 2021 from the 2022 revision of the World Population 
Prospects, we employed Arriaga's discrete method to decompose changes in e0 into 
both absolute and relative contributions of changes in age-specific death rate, 
and further obtained the age-sex-specific contribution to changes in e0 by 
country/territory and period (i.e., 2019-2020 and 2020-2021) for Asia.
FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic reduced 1.66 years in e0 of the Asian population 
from 2019 to 2021, slightly lower than the world average of 1.74 years. South 
Asia had a high loss of 3.01 years, whereas Eastern Asia had almost no changes. 
Oman, Lebanon, India, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Indonesia, and the Philippines 
experienced a high loss of above 2.5 years in e0. Despite significant national 
and territorial variations, the decline of e0 in Asia was mostly from the age 
group of 60-79 years, followed by age groups of 80 + and 45-59 years; and age 
groups of children contributed little (i.e., 0-4 and 5-14 years old). Males 
suffered more losses than females in this pandemic. Asian nations saw less loss 
in e0 in the second year of the pandemic, i.e., 2020-2021, than in the first 
year, i.e., 2019-2020, but this recovery trend was not observed in Southern Asia 
and South-Eastern Asia. Countries from Central Asia and Western Asia, such as 
Kazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Lebanon, and Oman, had extraordinarily more 
losses in e0 in the first year at ages around 70.
CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had significantly affected e0 of Asian 
populations, and most contribution to the reduction of e0 came from the three 
older age groups, 60-79 years, 80 + years, and 45-59 years, with great 
variations across countries/territories. Our findings could have important 
implications for development of more resilient public health systems in Asian 
societies with better policy interventions for vulnerable demographic groups.

The average worldwide human life expectancy is 70 years, with a significantly 
higher value in Western societies. Many modern diseases are not associated with 
premature mortality but with a decreased quality of life in aged patients and an 
excessive accumulation of various toxic compounds in the human body during life. 
Today, scientists are especially interested in finding compounds that can help 
increase a healthy lifespan by detoxifying the body. Phytotherapy with specific 
approaches is used in alternative medicine to remove toxins from the body. 
Worldwide, research is conducted to identify medicinal plant-derived molecules 
that, with few or no side effects, may protect the liver and other organs. This 
review provides updated information about the detoxification process, the 
traditional and modern use of the most effective medicinal plants, their active 
metabolites as detoxifying agents, and the mechanisms and pathways involved in 
the detoxification process. Among medicinal plants with substantial detoxifying 
properties, a major part belongs to the Asteraceae family (Silybum marianum, 
Cynara scolymus, Arctium lappa, Helichrysum spp, Inula helenium, and Taraxacum 
officinale). The most widely used hepatoprotective phytocomponent is silymarin, 
a standardized extract from the Silybum marianum seeds containing a mixture of 
flavonolignans. Many polysaccharides, polyphenols, and terpenoids have a 
detoxifying effect. Overall, scientific data on medicinal plants used in 
phytotherapeutic practice worldwide provides an understanding and awareness of 
their efficacy in detoxification.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWHIV) 
has significantly improved in recent decades, mostly due to antiretroviral (ARV) 
therapy. Aging can affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs and, as a consequence, 
increase the risk of drug interactions and toxicity that may impact treatment. 
The aim of this study was to carry out a systematic review of the literature on 
the effect of aging on ARV pharmacokinetics.
METHODS: Searches were performed in the BVS, EMBASE and PUBMED databases until 
November 2022. All studies available in English, Spanish and Portuguese 
investigating the pharmacokinetics of ARV approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) from 2005 to 2020 were selected. Peer-reviewed publications 
were included if they met all criteria: adults (≥ 18 years of age) living with 
or without HIV; report any pharmacokinetic parameter or plasma concentration of 
at least one of the following ARVs: tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF); 
doravirine (DOR), rilpivirine (RIL) and etravirine (ETR); darunavir (DRV), 
tipranavir (TPV) and fostemsavir (FTR); dolutegravir (DTG), raltegravir (RAL), 
bictegravir (BIC) and elvitegravir (EVG); maraviroc (MVC); ibalizumab (IBA); 
cobicistat (COBI). Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported stratified per age 
group: young adults (aged 18-49 years) or older (age ≥ 50 years) and all studies 
were evaluated for quality. The review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO 
database (registration number CRD42021236432).
RESULTS: Among 97 studies included, 20 reported pharmacokinetic evaluation in 
older individuals (age ≥ 50 years). Twenty five percent of the articles were 
phase I randomized clinical trials with HIV-negative participants and 
non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis presenting the parameters area under 
the curve (AUC) and peak drug concentration (Cmax). Seven age-stratified studies 
evaluated BIC, ETR, DRV, DTG, DOR and RAL. We found publications with discordant 
results for ETR and DTG pharmacokinetics in different age groups. DRV exposure 
was highly variable but modestly increased in aging PLWHIV. In contrast, no 
influence of age on BIC, DOR and RAL exposure was observed. A variability in 
pharmacokinetic parameters could be observed for the other ARVs (TAF and MVC) in 
different age groups.
CONCLUSION: Exposure to DRV increases modestly with age, while exposure to BIC, 
DOR and RAL appears to be unaffected by age. As the available evidence to 
confirm a potential effect of aging on ARV pharmacokinetics is limited, further 
studies are necessary.

Many people, including nearly half of American households, own a pet dog. 
Previous work has found that therapy dog interactions reduce distress, but 
little work to date has empirically established the mood-enhancing effects of 
interaction with one's own pet dog. In this study, dog owners (N = 73; 86.3% 
female, 13.7% male; age 25-77 years) underwent a stress-inducing task followed 
by random assignment to either (a) interacting with their dog (n = 24), (b) an 
expectancy control (n = 25; "stress-reducing" coloring books), or (c) a waiting 
control (n = 24). We compared the effects of each condition on affect and state 
anxiety. Participants assigned to the dog interaction showed greater increases 
in positive affect, as well as greater reductions in anxiety compared to both 
expectancy and waiting controls (ds > 0.72, ps < .018). No significant 
reductions in negative affect were detected. Second, we found that self-reported 
experiences with animals, attitudes toward animals, or bondedness with their dog 
did not differentially predict the condition's impact on the owner's mood. 
Finally, we coded participants' degree of engagement (e.g., time spent playing) 
with the dog and found that higher engagement predicted reduced negative affect. 
Overall, interacting with one's own pet dog reduced owners' distress. Such 
interactions, which occur commonly in daily life, may have the potential to 
alleviate distress at a large scale. Precisely how this works and for whom it is 
especially well suited remain intriguing open questions. (PsycInfo Database

Decreased physical fitness and being overweight are highly prevalent in 
schizophrenia, represent a major risk factor for comorbid cardio-vascular 
diseases and decrease the life expectancy of the patients. Thus, it is important 
to understand the underlying mechanisms that link psychopathology and weight 
gain. We hypothesize that the dopaminergic reward system plays an important role 
in this. We analyzed the seed-based functional connectivity (FC) of the ventral 
tegmental area (VTA) in a group of schizophrenic patients (n=32) and age-, as 
well as gender-, matched healthy controls (n=27). We then correlated the 
resting-state results with physical fitness parameters, obtained in a fitness 
test, and psychopathology. The FC analysis revealed decreased functional 
connections between the VTA and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), as well as 
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which negatively correlated with 
psychopathology, and increased FC between the VTA and the middle temporal gyrus 
in patients compared to healthy controls, which positively correlated with 
psychopathology. The decreased FC between the VTA and the ACC of the patient 
group further positively correlated with total body fat (p = .018, FDR-corr.) 
and negatively correlated with the overall physical fitness (p = .022). This 
study indicates a link between decreased physical fitness and higher body fat 
with functional dysconnectivity between the VTA and the ACC. These findings 
demonstrate that a dysregulated reward system might also be involved in 
comorbidities and could pave the way for future lifestyle therapy interventions.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of atezolizumab versus best supportive care (BSC) as adjuvant treatment 
following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with stage 
II-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumours have a programmed 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression ≥ 50% of tumour cells and excluding those with 
ALK/EGFR mutations, from a French collective perspective.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A five state Markov model over a 20-year time horizon was 
considered, including disease-free survival (DFS1) from IMpower010 trial, three 
progression states (locoregional recurrence, first and second-line metastatic 
recurrence) and death. Utilities, quality-adjusted life year (QALY) decrements 
associated to adverse events, costs, resource use, and transition probabilities 
were considered in the model. These inputs were sourced from IMpower010 trial, 
literature, and clinical experts' opinion. Model uncertainty was assessed 
through deterministic, probabilistic sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses.
RESULTS: Atezolizumab was associated with a QALY gain of 1.662, mainly driven by 
additional time spent in the DFS state, and a life-year gain of 2.112 years. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for atezolizumab versus BSC was 
€21,348/QALY gained. The sensitivity analyses highlighted that uncertainty 
within the model had limited impact on results. Changing the DFS survival curves 
to other plausible distributions produced ICERs below €20,000/QALY. Introducing 
an increasing proportion of cured patients (91.5%) from year two to year five 
reduced the ICER to €13,083/QALY, while including a loss of efficacy at year two 
in the atezolizumab treatment arm increased the ICER to €33,755/QALY.
DISCUSSION: Atezolizumab as adjuvant treatment in stage II-IIIA NSCLC resected 
patients with PDL1 ≥ 50% and without ALK/EGFR mutations has a lower ICER than 
other oncology drugs in France and a similar ICER to other adjuvant treatment in 
oncology.

Pegozafermin (also known as BIO89-100) is a glycoPEGylated analog of fibroblast 
growth factor 21 (FGF21) under development to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH) and severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG). In cell-based assays, 
pegozafermin had a similar receptor engagement profile as recombinant FGF21, 
with approximately eightfold higher potency at fibroblast growth factor receptor 
1c (FGFR1c). In diabetic monkeys, once-weekly and once-every-2-weeks regimens of 
subcutaneous pegozafermin provided rapid and robust benefits for an array of 
metabolic biomarkers, including triglycerides, cholesterol, fasting glucose, 
glycated hemoglobin, adiponectin, alanine aminotransferase, food intake, and 
body weight. In a single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers, 
subcutaneously administered pegozafermin was associated with statistically 
significant improvements in triglycerides, low- and high-density 
lipoprotein-cholesterol, and adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing and 
anti-inflammatory adipokine. Pharmacokinetic half-lives ranged from 55 to 100 
hours over the clinically relevant dose range, consistent with the expected 
half-life extension by glycoPEGylation. These findings provide evidence that 
pegozafermin is a promising candidate molecule for the treatment of patients 
with NASH or SHTG. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) 
is a stress-inducible hormone that has important roles in regulating energy 
balance and glucose and lipid homeostasis. Studies presented here demonstrate 
that a novel long-acting FGF21 analog, pegozafermin, has similar pharmacologic 
properties as FGF21 and that repeated, subcutaneous dosing of pegozafermin in 
diabetic monkeys and healthy humans improves lipid metabolism, glucose 
metabolism, weight, and liver transaminases. These results support future 
development of pegozafermin for the treatment of metabolic diseases, including 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and severe hypertriglyceridemia.

BACKGROUND: The shortened life expectancy in schizophrenia (SCZ) patients may be 
correlated with most cancers, yet there is heterogeneity in the studies 
examining these correlations. This study explored the expression of SCZ-related 
genes (HTR2A, COMT, and PRODH) in pan-cancer analysis. It helped to enhance the 
mechanistic understanding of the SCZ-cancer relationship and their immune 
mechanisms at the genetic level. Additionally, this study established a survival 
prediction model for glioblastoma and low-grade glioma (GBMLGG).
METHODS AND RESULTS: SCZ-associated genes (HTR2A, COMT, and PRODH) were 
subjected to pan-cancer analysis. COX regression analysis and survival analysis 
were carried out for differentially expressed genes in multiple cancers, and 
finally, GBMLGG was derived as the focus for further detailed analysis. The 
immune scores and immune cell infiltration analyses were performed. All three 
genes were considerably linked with immune infiltration in GBMLGG, consistent 
with survival analysis. Based on the immunocyte analysis, it was observed that 
CD8+ T cells might be critically involved in the survival of GBMLGG. Genomic 
heterogeneity studies identified correlations of three genes with GBMLGG in 
tumor mutational burden (TMB) and mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH). 
HTR2A and COMT were significantly negatively correlated in TMB. Furthermore, it 
was found that HTR2A had a significant positive correlation with MATH, whereas 
PRODH had a significant negative correlation with MATH. Accordingly, a survival 
prediction model was constructed for GBMLGG using these three genes and clinical 
data, with better results obtained when evaluated in two separate datasets. 
Finally, gene expression validation and further immunocyte analysis were carried 
out in the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of glioma.
CONCLUSION: SCZ-associated genes (HTR2A, COMT, and PRODH) were significantly 
differentially expressed in the carcinogenesis and survival of multiple cancers. 
The up or downregulation of gene expression varied across cancer types. In the 
GBMLGG analysis, upregulation of HTR2A and COMT was significantly positively 
correlated with carcinogenesis, while the opposite was noted for PRODH. 
Furthermore, a negative correlation was found between the upregulation of HTR2A 
and COMT and the survival of GBMLGG, and the opposite was also noted for PRODH. 
As reflected in the immunocyte analysis, abnormal expression of the three genes 
might be linked with CD8+ T cell infiltration, which might be critically 
involved in the survival of GBMLGG patients. The expression of HTR2A and COMT 
may inversely affect the efficacy of immunotherapy through the TMB pathway and 
further affect the prognosis of patient survival. The expression of HTR2A might 
positively indicate the degree of tumor heterogeneity through MATH and further 
affect the survival and prognosis of patients. The negative correlation of PRODH 
led to the opposite effect. Finally, the constructed survival prediction model 
demonstrated good predictive value, which was well validated in scRNA-seq 
analysis.

BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are recommended as the preferred therapy 
for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. As 
a result, aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal symptom (AIMSS) have 
become a major problem leading to therapy discontinuation and decreased quality 
of life in patients receiving adjuvant AIs treatment. Multiple therapies have 
been attempted, but have yielded limited clinical results. This study will be 
performed to determine whether acupoint thread embedding (ATE) combined with 
Wenshen Bugu Decoction can effectively treat AIMSS, so as to improve the AIs 
medication compliance of postmenopausal breast cancer patients.
METHODS: This study will utilize a randomized, 2 parallel groups controlled 
trial design. A total of 128 eligible postmenopausal breast cancer women with 
AIMSS will be randomized to receive a 12-week treatment with Wenshen Bugu 
Decoction alone (control group) or in combination with ATE (treatment group) in 
a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome will be the 12 week Brief Pain Inventory Worst 
Pain (BPI-WP) score. The secondary outcome measures will include response rate, 
Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BFI-SF), Western Ontario and McMaster 
Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy-Endocrine Symptom (FACT-ES), Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), bone marrow density (BMD), blood markers of bone 
metabolite, Morisky medication adherence scale-8 (MMAS-8), credibility and 
expectancy, and survival outcomes.
DISCUSSION: This trial may provide clinical evidence that ATE combined with 
Wenshen Bugu Decoction can be beneficial for treating AIMSS among postmenopausal 
breast cancer survivors. Our findings will be helpful to enhance the quality of 
life and reduce the occurrence of AIs withdrawal.
