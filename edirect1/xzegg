OBJECTIVE: Post-stroke spasticity is a common complication in stroke survivors, 
causing severe burden to patients living with it. The aim of this review was to 
conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of the treatment of post-stroke 
spasticity, in adults, with abobotulinumtoxinA compared to the best supportive 
care, based on results from a systematic literature review. Given that 
abobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT-A) is always accompanied by the best supportive care 
treatment, the CEA compared aboBoNT-A plus the best supportive care with the 
best supportive care alone.
METHODS: A systematic literature review in EMBASE (including Medline and 
PubMed), Scopus, and other sources (Google Scholar) was conducted. Articles of 
all types, providing information on the costs and/or effectiveness measures for 
the current treatments of post-stroke spasticity in adults were included. The 
synthesis of information from the review provided the parameters for the design 
of a CEA of the mentioned treatment of interest. The societal perspective was 
compared to a perspective where only direct costs were observed.
RESULTS: In total, 532 abstracts were screened. Full information was revised 
from 40 papers and 13 of these were selected as core papers for full data 
extraction. Data from the core publications formed the basis for the development 
of a cost-effectiveness model. In all the included papers physiotherapy was the 
best supportive care treatment. The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that even 
in the most conservative scenario, assuming the worst case scenario, the 
probability of a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained below 
€40,000, for aboBoNT-A together with physiotherapy is above 0.8, and with 
certainty below €50,000/QALY when either a direct costs, or a societal 
perspective was taken. On average, the probabilistic model obtains a negative 
mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of around -15,000 €/QALY.
CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness analyses show that aboBoNT-A together with 
physiotherapy would be a cost-effective treatment compared with physiotherapy 
alone, independently of the perspective considered.

Australia.

Although Australia maintains relatively high standards of health and healthcare, 
there exists disparity in health outcomes and longevity among different segments 
of the population. Internationally, there is growing evidence that life 
expectancy gains are not being shared equally among the rich and the poor. In 
this paper we examine the evolution of mortality inequality in Australia between 
2001 and 2018. Using a spatial inequality model and combining data from several 
administrative data sources, we document significant mortality inequality 
between the rich and the poor in Australia. For most age groups, mortality 
inequality has remained unchanged over the last 20 years. However, mortality 
inequality is increasing for middle-aged men and women. In part, this can be 
explained by improvements in longevity which favor urban over rural Australians. 
Another contributing factor we identify is differential access to healthcare in 
rich and poor regions. Although Australia's socioeconomic gradient of mortality 
is flatter than in the US, due to universal health coverage, the fact that 
mortality inequality is increasing for some groups accentuates the importance of 
safeguarding health care accessibility.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to quantify the contribution of narrowing the life 
expectancy gap between urban and rural areas to the overall life expectancy at 
birth in Korea and examine the age and death cause-specific contribution to 
changes in the life expectancy gap between urban and rural areas.
METHODS: We used the registration population and death statistics from 
Statistics Korea from 2000 to 2019. Assuming two hypothetical scenarios, namely, 
the same age-specific mortality change rate in urban and rural areas and a 20% 
faster decline than the observed decline rate in rural areas, we compared the 
increase in life expectancy with the actual increase. Changes in the life 
expectancy gap between urban and rural areas were decomposed into age- and 
cause-specific contributions.
RESULTS: Rural disadvantages of life expectancy were evident. However, life 
expectancies in rural areas increased more rapidly than in urban areas. Life 
expectancy would have increased 0.3-0.5 less if the decline rate of age-specific 
mortality in small-to-middle urban and rural areas were the same as that of 
large urban areas. Life expectancy would have increased 0.7-0.9 years further if 
the decline rate of age-specific mortality in small-to-middle urban and rural 
areas had been 20% higher. The age groups 15-39 and 40-64, and chronic diseases, 
such as neoplasms and diseases of the digestive system, and external causes 
significantly contributed to narrowing the life expectancy gap between urban and 
rural areas.
CONCLUSION: Pro-health equity interventions would be a good strategy to reduce 
the life expectancy gap and increase overall life expectancy, particularly in 
societies where life expectancies have already increased.

BACKGROUND: Although overall health status in the last decades improved, health 
inequalities due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) persist between and within 
European countries. There is a lack of studies giving insights into health 
inequalities related to NCDs in the European Economic Area (EEA) countries. 
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to quantify health inequalities in 
age-standardized disability adjusted life years (DALY) rates for NCDs overall 
and 12 specific NCDs across 30 EEA countries between 1990 and 2019. Also, this 
study aimed to determine trends in health inequalities and to identify those 
NCDs where the inequalities were the highest.
METHODS: DALY rate ratios were calculated to determine and compare inequalities 
between the 30 EEA countries, by sex, and across time. Annual rate of change was 
used to determine the differences in DALY rate between 1990 and 2019 for males 
and females. The Gini Coefficient (GC) was used to measure the DALY rate 
inequalities across countries, and the Slope Index of Inequality (SII) to 
estimate the average absolute difference in DALY rate across countries.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2019, there was an overall declining trend in DALY 
rate, with larger declines among females compared to males. Among EEA countries, 
in 2019 the highest NCD DALY rate for both sexes were observed for Bulgaria. For 
the whole period, the highest DALY rate ratios were identified for digestive 
diseases, diabetes and kidney diseases, substance use disorders, cardiovascular 
diseases (CVD), and chronic respiratory diseases - representing the highest 
inequality between countries. In 2019, the highest DALY rate ratio was found 
between Bulgaria and Iceland for males. GC and SII indicated that the highest 
inequalities were due to CVD for most of the study period - however, overall 
levels of inequality were low.
CONCLUSIONS: The inequality in level 1 NCDs DALYs rate is relatively low among 
all the countries. CVDs, digestive diseases, diabetes and kidney diseases, 
substance use disorders, and chronic respiratory diseases are the NCDs that 
exhibit higher levels of inequality across countries in the EEA. This might be 
mitigated by applying tailored preventive measures and enabling healthcare 
access.

Mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes (mcr-1 to mcr-10) are plasmid-encoded 
genes that threaten the clinical utility of colistin (COL), one of the 
highest-priority critically important antibiotics (HP-CIAs) used to treat 
infections caused by multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant bacteria 
in humans and animals. For more than six decades, COL has been used largely 
unregulated in the poultry sector in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), 
and this has led to the development/spread of mcr gene-containing bacteria 
(MGCB). The prevalence rates of mcr-positive organisms from the poultry sector 
in LMICs between January 1970 and May 2023 range between 0.51% and 58.8%. 
Through horizontal gene transfer, conjugative plasmids possessing insertion 
sequences (ISs) (especially ISApl1), transposons (predominantly Tn6330), and 
integrons have enhanced the spread of mcr-1, mcr-2, mcr-3, mcr-4, mcr-5, mcr-7, 
mcr-8, mcr-9, and mcr-10 in the poultry sector in LMICs. These genes are 
harboured by Escherichia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella, Cronobacter, 
Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Shigella, Providencia, Aeromonas, Raoultella, 
Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter species, belonging to diverse clones. The mcr-1, 
mcr-3, and mcr-10 genes have also been integrated into the chromosomes of these 
bacteria and are mobilizable by ISs and integrative conjugative elements. These 
bacteria often coexpress mcr with virulence genes and other genes conferring 
resistance to HP-CIAs, such as extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems, 
fosfomycin, fluoroquinolone, and tigecycline. The transmission routes and 
dynamics of MGCB from the poultry sector in LMICs within the One Health triad 
include contact with poultry birds, feed/drinking water, manure, poultry farmers 
and their farm workwear, farming equipment, the consumption and sale of 
contaminated poultry meat/egg and associated products, etc. The use of 
pre/probiotics and other non-antimicrobial alternatives in the raising of birds, 
the judicious use of non-critically important antibiotics for therapy, the 
banning of nontherapeutic COL use, improved vaccination, biosecurity, hand 
hygiene and sanitization, the development of rapid diagnostic test kits, and the 
intensified surveillance of mcr genes, among others, could effectively control 
the spread of MGCB from the poultry sector in LMICs.

Integrin receptors are essential contributors to neurite outgrowth and axon 
elongation. Activated integrins engage components of the extracellular matrix, 
enabling the growth cone to form point contacts, which connect the extracellular 
substrate to dynamic intracellular protein complexes. These adhesion complexes 
facilitate efficient growth cone migration and neurite extension. Major 
signalling pathways mediated by the adhesion complex are instigated by focal 
adhesion kinase (FAK), whilst axonal guidance molecules present in vivo promote 
growth cone turning or retraction by local modulation of FAK activity. 
Activation of FAK is marked by phosphorylation following integrin engagement, 
and this activity is tightly regulated during neurite outgrowth. FAK inhibition 
slows neurite outgrowth by reducing point contact turnover; however, mutant FAK 
constructs with enhanced activity stimulate aberrant outgrowth. Importantly, FAK 
is a major structural component of maturing adhesion sites, which provide the 
platform for actin polymerisation to drive leading edge advance. In this review, 
we discuss the coordinated signalling of integrin receptors and FAK, as well as 
their role in regulating neurite outgrowth and axon elongation. We also discuss 
the importance of the integrin-FAK axis in vivo, as integrin expression and 
activation are key determinants of successful axon regeneration following 
injury.

Biological Fitness Cost, Demographic Growth Characteristics, and Resistance 
Mechanism in Alpha-Cypermethrin-Resistant Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae).

Protection, College of Food and Agriculture Sciences, King Saud University,

Musca domestica L., a pest of animals and humans, has developed resistance to 
alpha-cypermethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide commonly used to control medically 
important pests in many countries, including Saudi Arabia. We investigated the 
mechanism underlying the development of alpha-cypermethrin resistance and life 
history characteristics of alpha-cypermethrin-susceptible (Alpha-SS) and 
alpha-cypermethrin-resistant (Alpha-RS) M. domestica using the age-stage, 
two-sex life table theory, which is crucial for developing a future rational 
management strategy and minimizing the negative effects of alpha-cypermethrin on 
the environment. Our results showed that Alpha-RS M. domestica had a 405.93-fold 
increase in resistance to alpha-cypermethrin relative to Alpha-SS M. domestica. 
This increase in the resistance toward insecticide was attributed to metabolic 
enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferases, specific esterases, and cytochrome 
P450 monooxygenases. Furthermore, Alpha-RS M. domestica exhibited lower relative 
fitness (0.50), longevity, survival rate, life expectancy, reproductive values, 
intrinsic rate of increase, net reproductive rate, fecundity, maternity, and 
finite rate of increase, along with shorter larval, female preadult, and adult 
durations than Alpha-SS M. domestica, indicating fitness costs associated with 
most parameters. However, no significant differences were found between the 
strains in the following parameters: egg, pupa, and male preadult durations; 
adult preoviposition, total preoviposition, and oviposition periods; female 
ratio; and total generation time. Additionally, Alpha-RS M. domestica had a 
markedly lower intrinsic rate of increase, net reproductive rate, and finite 
rate of increase than Alpha-SS M. domestica. The results of this study suggest 
that alpha-cypermethrin resistance may lead to dominant fitness costs in M. 
domestica. Overall, these findings will aid in the development of rational 
control strategies for M. domestica as well as help to reduce pesticide 
pollution.

Although the proportion of ulcer patients with medical problems among the 
elderly has increased with the extension of human life expectancy, treatment 
efficiency is drastically low, incurring substantial social costs. MSCs have 
independent regeneration potential, making them useful in clinical trials of 
difficult-to-treat diseases. In particular, ADMSCs are promising in the stem 
cell therapy industry as they can be obtained in vast amounts using non-invasive 
methods. Furthermore, studies are underway to enhance the regeneration potential 
of ADMSCs using cytokines, growth factors, and gene delivery to generate highly 
functional ADMSCs. In this study, key regulators of wound healing, SOCS-1, -3, 
and -5, were combined to maximize the regenerative potential of ADMSCs in 
pressure ulcer treatments. After transfecting SOCS-1, -3, -5, and SOCS-com into 
ADMSCs using a non-viral method, the expression of the inflammatory factors 
TNF-alpha, INF-gamma, and IL-10 was confirmed. ADMSCs transfected with SOCS-com 
showed decreased overall expression of inflammatory factors and increased 
expression of anti-inflammatory factors. Based on these results, we implanted 
ADMSCs transfected with SOCS-com into a pressure ulcer mouse model to observe 
their subsequent wound-healing effects. Notably, SOCS-com improved wound closure 
in ulcers, and reconstruction of the epidermis and dermis was observed. The 
healing mechanism of ADMSCs transfected with SOCS-com was examined by RNA 
sequencing. Gene analysis results confirmed that expression changes occurred in 
genes of key regulators of wound healing, such as chemokines, MMP-1, 9, CSF-2, 
and IL-33, and that such genetic changes enhanced wound healing in ulcers. Based 
on these results, we demonstrate the potential of ADMSCs transfected with 
SOCS-com as an ulcer treatment tool.

Obesity is a multifactorial chronic impairment that further decreases quality of 
life and life expectancy. Worldwide, childhood obesity has become a pandemic 
health issue causing several comorbidities that frequently present already in 
childhood, including cardiovascular (hypertension, dyslipidemia), metabolic 
(Type 2 diabetes mellitus, fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome), 
respiratory, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal disorders. In addition, obese 
children frequently experience stress and psychosocial symptoms, including mood 
disorders, anxiety, prejudice and low self-esteem. Given that cardiovascular 
risk factors and pediatric obesity have the tendency to pertain into adulthood, 
obesity management, including weight control and physical activity, should start 
before the late teens and certainly before the first signs of atherosclerosis 
can be detected. This review aims to concisely present options for childhood 
obesity management, including lifestyle modification strategies and 
pharmacological treatment, as well as the respective treatment indications for 
the general practitioner.

Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) is an immune system protein that is found on the 
surface of all nucleated human cells. B2M is naturally shed from cell surfaces 
into the plasma, followed by renal excretion. In patients with impaired renal 
function, B2M will accumulate in organs and tissues leading to significantly 
reduced life expectancy and quality of life. While current hemodialysis methods 
have been successful in managing electrolyte as well as small and large molecule 
disturbances arising in chronic renal failure, they have shown only modest 
success in managing plasma levels of B2M and similar sized proteins, while 
sparing important proteins such as albumin. We describe a systematic protein 
design effort aimed at adding the ability to selectively remove specific, 
undesired waste proteins such as B2M from the plasma of chronic renal failure 
patients. A novel nanoparticle built using a tetrahedral protein assembly as a 
scaffold that presents 12 copies of a B2M-binding nanobody is described. The 
designed nanoparticle binds specifically to B2M through protein-protein 
interactions with nanomolar binding affinity (~4.2 nM). Notably, binding to the 
nanoparticle increases the effective size of B2M by over 50-fold, offering a 
potential selective avenue for separation based on size. We present data to 
support the potential utility of such a nanoparticle for removing B2M from 
plasma by either size-based filtration or by polyvalent binding to a stationary 
matrix under blood flow conditions. Such applications could address current 
shortcomings in the management of problematic mid-sized proteins in chronic 
renal failure patients.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of PET/CT on 
clinical management of patients with germ cell tumors (GCTs) conducted in a 
real-world setting, including avoidance of invasive procedures, additional 
diagnostic imaging, and changes in treatment.
METHODS: Patients with GCTs were prospectively enrolled into a PET/CT registry 
study between May 2013 and April 2021. Intended patient management prior and 
after PET/CT was documented using standardized questionnaires. Changes in 
oncologic staging and clinical management after PET/CT were recorded, including 
planned treatment and planned additional diagnostics.
RESULTS: Forty-three male patients with GCTs were included consecutively in this 
study. After PET/CT, oncologic staging changed in 22/43 patients (51%), with 
upstaging in seven cases (16%), downstaging in ten cases (23%), and cancer 
relapse in five cases (11%). The number of patients with intended curative 
treatment remained stable, while a considerable change in intended therapeutic 
intervention was noted after PET/CT, with an increase in planned chemotherapy 
from three to eleven patients and a decrease in planned surgical resection from 
eleven to two patients. In addition, PET/CT contributed to preventing patients 
from intended invasive procedures including biopsy and surgery in 8/43 (19%) 
cases and from additional diagnostic procedures in 25 (58%) cases.
CONCLUSION: With the use of FDG-PET/CT as a tool to guide patient management in 
GCTs, we observed a notable impact on clinical staging and a consequent 
reduction in the need for additional invasive and diagnostic procedures. These 
findings are expected to be even more consequential in the future as treatment 
modalities improve and the life expectancy of GCT patients further increases.
KEY POINTS: PET/CT considerably influences the clinical stage of GCT patients. 
PET/CT has remarkable influence on the choice of therapeutic interventions and 
reduces additional diagnostic procedures.

Nanotechnology application in cancer treatment is promising and is likely to 
quickly spread worldwide in the near future. To date, most scientific studies on 
nanomaterial development have focused on deepening the attitudes of end users 
and experts, leaving clinical practice implications unexplored. Neuro-oncology 
might be a promising field for the application of nanotechnologies, especially 
for malignant brain tumors with a low-survival rate such as glioblastoma (GBM). 
As to improving patients' quality of life and life expectancy, innovative 
treatments are worth being explored. Indeed, it is important to explore 
clinicians' intention to use experimental technologies in clinical practice. In 
the present study, we conducted an exploratory review of the literature about 
healthcare workers' knowledge and personal opinions toward nanomedicine. Our 
search (i) gives evidence for disagreement between self-reported and factual 
knowledge about nanomedicine and (ii) suggests the internet and television as 
main sources of information about current trends in nanomedicine applications, 
over scientific journals and formal education. Current models of risk assessment 
suggest time-saving cognitive and affective shortcuts, i.e., heuristics support 
both laypeople and experts in the decision-making process under uncertainty, 
whereas they might be a source of error. Whether the knowledge is poor, 
heuristics are more likely to occur and thus clinicians' opinions and 
perspectives toward new technologies might be biased.

Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain tumor with an average life expectancy 
between 14 and 16 months after diagnosis. The Ki-67 labeling index (LI), a 
measure of cellular proliferation, is emerging as a prognostic marker in GBM. In 
this study, we investigated the ultrastructure of glioblastoma tissue from 9 
patients with the same molecular profile (adult IDH wild-type glioblastoma, 
wild-type ATRX, and positive for TP53 expression, GFAP expression, and EGFR 
overexpression) to find possible ultrastructural features to be used as 
biomarkers and correlated with the only parameter that differs among our 
samples, the Ki-67 LI. Our main results were the visualization of the anatomical 
basis of astrocyte-endothelial cells crosstalk; the ultrastructural in situ 
imaging of clusters of hyperactivated microglia cells (MsEVs); the 
ultrastructural in situ imaging of microglia cells storing lipid vesicles 
(MsLVs); the ultrastructural in situ imaging of neoplastic cells mitophagy 
(NCsM). The statistical analysis of our data indicated that MsEVs and MsLVs 
correlate with the Ki-67 LI value. We can thus assume they are good candidates 
to be considered morphological biomarkers correlating to Ki-67 LI. The role of 
NCsM instead must be further evaluated. Our study findings demonstrate that by 
combining ultrastructural characteristics with molecular information, we can 
discover biomarkers that have the potential to enhance diagnostic precision, aid 
in treatment decision-making, identify targets for therapy, and enable 
personalized treatment plans tailored to each patient. However, further research 
with larger sample sizes is needed to validate these findings and fully utilize 
the potential of ultrastructural analysis in managing glioblastoma.

Aging-related molecular and cellular alterations in the lung contribute to an 
increased susceptibility of the elderly to devastating diseases. Although the 
study of the aging process in the lung may benefit from the use of genetically 
modified mouse models and omics techniques, these approaches are still not 
available to most researchers and produce complex results. In this article, we 
review works that used naturally aged mouse models, together with 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative morphologic (QM) methods in the 
study of the mechanisms of the aging process in the lung and its most commonly 
associated disorders: cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 
infectious diseases. The advantage of using naturally aged mice is that they 
present characteristics similar to those observed in human aging. The advantage 
of using IHC and QM methods lies in their simplicity, economic accessibility, 
and easy interpretation, in addition to the fact that they provide extremely 
important information. The study of the aging process in the lung and its 
associated diseases could allow the design of appropriate therapeutic 
strategies, which is extremely important considering that life expectancy and 
the number of elderly people continue to increase considerably worldwide.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancerous condition characterized by the 
proliferation of plasma cells within the hematopoietic marrow, resulting in 
multiple osteolytic lesions. MM patients typically experience bone pain, kidney 
damage, fatigue due to anemia, and infections. Historically, MM was an incurable 
disease with a life expectancy of around three years after diagnosis. However, 
over the past two decades, the development of novel therapeutics has 
significantly improved patient outcomes, including response to treatment, 
remission duration, quality of life, and overall survival. These advancements 
include thalidomide and its derivatives, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, which 
exhibit diverse mechanisms of action against the plasma cell clone. 
Additionally, proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, ixazomib, and 
carfilzomib disrupt protein degradation, proving specifically toxic to cancerous 
plasma cells. Recent advancements also involve monoclonal antibodies targeting 
surface antigens, such as elotuzumab (anti-CS1) and daratumumab (anti-CD38), 
bispecific t-cell engagers such as teclistamab (anti-BCMA/CD3) and Chimeric 
antigen receptor T (CAR-T)-based strategies, with a growing focus on drugs that 
exhibit increasingly targeted action against neoplastic plasma cells and 
relevant effects on the tumor microenvironment.

Fresh fish is a perishable food in which chemical (namely oxidation) and 
microbiological degradation result in undesirable odor. Non-processed fish 
(i.e., raw fish) is increasingly commercialized in packaging systems which are 
convenient for its retailing and/or which can promote an extension of its 
shelf-life. Compared to fish sent to its retail unpackaged, fish packaging 
results in a modification of the gaseous composition of the atmosphere 
surrounding it. These modifications of atmosphere composition may affect both 
chemical and microbiological degradation pathways of fish constituents and 
thereby the volatile organic compounds produced. In addition to monitoring Total 
Volatile Basic Nitrogen (TVB-N), which is a common indicator to estimate 
non-processed fish freshness, analytical techniques such as gas chromatography 
coupled to mass spectrometry or techniques referred to as "electronic nose" 
allow either the identification of the entire set of these volatile compounds 
(the volatilome) and/or to selectively monitor some of them, respectively. 
Interestingly, monitoring these volatile organic compounds along fish storage 
might allow the identification of early-stage markers of fish alteration. In 
this context, to provide relevant information for the identification of volatile 
markers of non-processed packaged fish quality evolution during its storage, the 
following items have been successively reviewed: (1) inner atmosphere gaseous 
composition and evolution as a function of fish packaging systems; (2) fish 
constituents degradation pathways and analytical methods to monitor fish 
degradation with a focus on volatilome analysis; and (3) the effect of different 
factors affecting fish preservation (temperature, inner atmosphere composition, 
application of hurdle technology) on volatilome composition.

This study evaluated the efficiency of UV radiation doses (4.68-149.76 J/cm2) 
and nisin (50-200 ppm) and their combination in comparison with thermal 
pasteurization on the microbial inhibition kinetics and physicochemical 
properties of tangerine juice. It was noted that UV-149.76 J/cm2 and nisin (NS) 
at 200 ppm in conjunction exhibited the highest log reduction in spoilage and 
pathogenic microbes including Escherichia coli, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, 
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, yeast and molds, and total plate count in 
tangerine juice. Additionally, the first-order kinetic model provides a better 
fit for spoilage and pathogenic strains compared with the zero-order model 
(higher coefficient of determination, R2), particularly for E. coli. UV and NS 
showed insignificant effects (p > 0.05) on pH, TSS, and TA values compared with 
pasteurization. However, there were notable differences observed in color 
analysis, total phenolic compound, total flavonoid content, vitamin C, 
carotenoid content, and antioxidant activity using DPPH and FRAP assays. The 
optimized UV + NS samples were subjected to refrigerated storage for 21 days. 
The results revealed that during the entire storage period, the pH values and 
the TSS values slightly decreased, and the TA values increased in the treated 
samples. The UV + NS treatment insignificantly impacted the color properties. 
The total phenolic, total flavonoid, and carotenoid contents, and vitamin C 
decreased over time for all sample treatments, whereas the antioxidant 
properties exhibited varying outcomes, compared with an untreated control and 
pasteurization. Therefore, UV radiation and nisin (UV-149.76 J/cm2 + NS-200 ppm) 
in combination could serve as a viable alternative to traditional heat 
pasteurization of fruit juice during cold storage.

Breast cancer is a disease that affects women in different countries around the 
world. The real cause of breast cancer is particularly challenging to determine, 
and early detection of the disease is necessary for reducing the death rate, due 
to the high risks associated with breast cancer. Treatment in the early period 
can increase the life expectancy and quality of life for women. CAD (Computer 
Aided Diagnostic) systems can perform the diagnosis of the benign and malignant 
lesions of breast cancer using technologies and tools based on image processing, 
helping specialist doctors to obtain a more precise point of view with fewer 
processes when making their diagnosis by giving a second opinion. This study 
presents a novel CAD system for automated breast cancer diagnosis. The proposed 
method consists of different stages. In the preprocessing stage, an image is 
segmented, and a mask of a lesion is obtained; during the next stage, the 
extraction of the deep learning features is performed by a CNN-specifically, 
DenseNet 201. Additionally, handcrafted features (Histogram of Oriented 
Gradients (HOG)-based, ULBP-based, perimeter area, area, eccentricity, and 
circularity) are obtained from an image. The designed hybrid system uses CNN 
architecture for extracting deep learning features, along with traditional 
methods which perform several handcraft features, following the medical 
properties of the disease with the purpose of later fusion via proposed 
statistical criteria. During the fusion stage, where deep learning and 
handcrafted features are analyzed, the genetic algorithms as well as mutual 
information selection algorithm, followed by several classifiers (XGBoost, 
AdaBoost, Multilayer perceptron (MLP)) based on stochastic measures, are applied 
to choose the most sensible information group among the features. In the 
experimental validation of two modalities of the CAD design, which performed two 
types of medical studies-mammography (MG) and ultrasound (US)-the databases 
mini-DDSM (Digital Database for Screening Mammography) and BUSI (Breast 
Ultrasound Images Dataset) were used. Novel CAD systems were evaluated and 
compared with recent state-of-the-art systems, demonstrating better performance 
in commonly used criteria, obtaining ACC of 97.6%, PRE of 98%, Recall of 98%, 
F1-Score of 98%, and IBA of 95% for the abovementioned datasets.

Lifestyle, a major determinant of health status, comprises a number of habits 
and behaviours that form a part of daily life. People with healthy lifestyles 
have a better quality of life, suffer less disease, and have a longer life 
expectancy. This work reports the design and content validation of a 
questionnaire-the 'PONTE A 100' questionnaire-assessing the lifestyle of adults. 
This collects information across five dimensions-'Eating Habits', 'Physical 
Activity', 'Smoking and use of Alcohol and other Drugs', 'Emotional Wellbeing', 
and 'Safety and Non-intentional Injuries'-via the answering of a total 33 items. 
Psychometric validation of the instrument's content was obtained via expert 
opinions. This was performed by two rounds of assessment and involved 34 experts 
representing different health science disciplines (mean experience, 27.4 ± 9.4 
years). At the end of each round, adjustments were made according to their 
recommendations. Agreement between the experts was examined using the Aiken V 
test. A final V value of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-1.00) was obtained for the 
questionnaire as a whole, highlighting the validity of its content. The 
questionnaire would therefore appear to be an appropriate instrument for 
assessing the lifestyle of adults.
