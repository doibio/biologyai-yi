most interventions under a societal perspective. In all three countries, 
expansion of access to care produced substantial health gains. Compared with 
current practice and conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds, most 
intervention approaches seemed highly cost-effective.
INTERPRETATION: Expansion of tuberculosis services seems cost-effective for 
high-burden countries and could generate substantial health and economic 
benefits for patients, although substantial new funding would be required. 
Further work to determine the optimal intervention mix for each country is 
necessary.

The first clinical trial aimed at targeting fundamental processes of aging will 
soon be launched (TAME: Targeting Aging with Metformin). In its wake is a robust 
pipeline of therapeutic interventions that have been demonstrated to extend 
lifespan or healthspan of preclinical models, including rapalogs, antioxidants, 
anti-inflammatory agents, and senolytics. This ensures that if the TAME trial is 
successful, numerous additional clinical trials are apt to follow. But a 
significant impediment to these trials remains the question of what endpoints 
should be measured? The design of the TAME trial very cleverly skirts around 
this based on the fact that there are decades of data on metformin in humans, 
providing unequaled clarity of what endpoints are most likely to yield a 
positive outcome. But for a new chemical entity, knowing what endpoints to 
measure remains a formidable challenge. For economy's sake, and to achieve 
results in a reasonable time frame, surrogate markers of lifespan and healthy 
aging are desperately needed. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of 
molecular endpoints that are currently being used as indices of age-related 
phenomena (e.g., morbidity, frailty, mortality) and proposes an approach for 
validating and prioritizing these endpoints.

Podosomes are cytoskeletal structures crucial for cell protrusion and matrix 
remodelling in osteoclasts, activated endothelial cells, macrophages and 
dendritic cells. In these cells, hundreds of podosomes are spatially organized 
in diversely shaped clusters. Although we and others established individual 
podosomes as micron-sized mechanosensing protrusive units, the exact scope and 
spatiotemporal organization of podosome clustering remain elusive. By 
integrating a newly developed extension of Spatiotemporal Image Correlation 
Spectroscopy with novel image analysis, we demonstrate that F-actin, vinculin 
and talin exhibit directional and correlated flow patterns throughout podosome 
clusters. Pattern formation and magnitude depend on the cluster actomyosin 
machinery. Indeed, nanoscopy reveals myosin IIA-decorated actin filaments 
interconnecting multiple proximal podosomes. Extending well-beyond podosome 
nearest neighbours, the actomyosin-dependent dynamic spatial patterns reveal a 
previously unappreciated mesoscale connectivity throughout the podosome 
clusters. This directional transport and continuous redistribution of podosome 
components provides a mechanistic explanation of how podosome clusters function 
as coordinated mechanosensory area.

We exploit exogenous variation in years of completed college induced by 
draft-avoidance behavior during the Vietnam War to examine the impact of college 
on adult mortality. Our estimates imply that increasing college attainment from 
the level of the state at the 25th percentile of the education distribution to 
that of the state at the 75th percentile would decrease cumulative mortality for 
cohorts in our sample by 8 to 10 percent relative to the mean. Most of the 
reduction in mortality is from deaths due to cancer and heart disease. We also 
explore potential mechanisms, including differential earnings and health 
insurance.

Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the world. In Argentina, in 
2000, 16% of deaths were attributable to tobacco in over 35 years. In Tucuman it 
exis data on prevalence of, snuff consumption but not on mortality related to 
smoking. Our objective was to estimate the number of deaths attributable to 
tobacco smoking, the percentage attributable fraction, the rate of age-adjusted 
mortality and disability-adjusted life years. A cross-sectional descriptive 
study of mortality associated with smoking in adults over 35 years in Tucuman 
was conducted between 2001 and 2010; 19 causes provided by Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention were grouped in cardiovascular diseases, malignancies and 
respiratory diseases. In the last decade, from a total of 77 220 deaths 
documented in Tucuman, 3131 [4.1% (CI 95%: 3.9-4.2)] were attributed to snuff, 
77% in men with the highest attributable fraction percentage in the range of 35 
to 64 years. Rate age-adjusted mortality ranged from 87.5 in 2001 to 52.1 in 
2008. In the first half period cardiovascular diseases predominated, followed by 
malignancies. On average 3203 years of potential life lost were quantified; 
where cardiovascular diseases accounted for 55.3%. The percentage of deaths 
attributable to snuff in Tucuman was lower than that recorded for Argentina. 
Even though there is anti-tobacco legislation in Tucuman, it is necessary to 
strengthen it.

Epidermal Growth Factor like domain 7 (EGFL7), also known as Vascular 
Endothelial-statin (VE-statin), is a secreted angiogenic factor. Recent data 
have demonstrated the potential oncogenic role and prognostic significance of 
EGFL7 in several human cancers. However, the clinical signature and further 
mechanisms of EGFL7's function in gliomagenesis are poorly understood. In the 
present study, we found that increased EGFL7 expression was associated with 
tumor grade. High expression of EGFL7 in EGFRvIII-positive glioblastoma 
multiforme (GBM) was determined to be a strong and independent risk factor for 
reduced life expectancy. EGFRvIII cells can secrete the EGFL7 protein to improve 
the activity of the β-catenin/TCF4 Transcription complex in EGFRwt cells, thus 
promoting their own EGFL7 expression. Our research demonstrates that oncogenic 
activation of EGFRwt in GBM is likely maintained by a continuous EGFL7 autocrine 
flow line, and may be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.

OBJECTIVES: Many aging workers wish to continue working as long as they can for 
a better life in the future. However, symptoms of pain are a key obstacle in the 
continuation of work among older workers. The impact of pain on work is 
understudied. Thus, we investigated the relationship between pain 
characteristics (total site and severity) and aging workers' working life 
expectancy scale (WoLES) in Korea.
METHODS: We included 1,979 participants (1,175 men and 804 women) from a 
well-established survey of a nationally representative population: the Korean 
Longitudinal Study of Ageing. A self-questionnaire was used to assess pain 
characteristics and WoLES. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
for the lower-WoLES group were calculated using multiple logistic regression 
models.
RESULTS: Compared with the absence of pain, ORs and 95% CIs of the lower-WoLES 
group were increased, as follows: 1 pain site, 1.75 (1.20-2.55); 2 pain sites, 
1.99 (1.32-3.03); 3 or more pain sites, 2.28 (1.51-3.42); mild pain, 1.74 
(1.32-2.61); moderate pain, 2.02 (1.28-3.22); and severe pain, 2.12 (1.46-3.08). 
The statistical trend was significant in both total sites and severity of pain 
(p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant association between WoLES and both total 
pain sites and severity of pain, even after adjusting for potential confounding 
factors.

We developed a Markov microsimulation model among hypothetical cohorts of 
community-dwelling US white women without prior major osteoporotic fractures 
over a lifetime horizon. At ages 75 and 80, adding 1 year of exercise to 5 years 
of oral bisphosphonate therapy is cost-effective at a conventionally accepted 
threshold compared with bisphosphonates alone.
INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of 
the combined strategy of oral bisphosphonate therapy for 5 years and falls 
prevention exercise for 1 year compared with either strategy in isolation.
METHODS: We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs] (2014 US 
dollars per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]), using a Markov microsimulation 
model among hypothetical cohorts of community-dwelling US white women with 
different starting ages (65, 70, 75, and 80) without prior history of hip, 
vertebral, or wrist fractures over a lifetime horizon from the societal 
perspective.
RESULTS: At ages 65, 70, 75, and 80, the combined strategy had ICERs of 
$202,020, $118,460, $46,870, and $17,640 per QALY, respectively, compared with 
oral bisphosphonate therapy alone. The combined strategy provided better health 
at lower cost than falls prevention exercise alone at ages 70, 75, and 80. In 
deterministic sensitivity analyses, results were particularly sensitive to the 
change in the opportunity cost of participants' time spent exercising. In 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probabilities of the combined strategy 
being cost-effective compared with the next best alternative increased with age, 
ranging from 35 % at age 65 to 48 % at age 80 at a willingness-to-pay of 
$100,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Among community-dwelling US white women ages 75 and 80, adding 
1 year of exercise to 5 years of oral bisphosphonate therapy is cost-effective 
at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per QALY, compared with oral bisphosphonate 
therapy only. This analysis will help clinicians and policymakers make better 
decisions about treatment options to reduce fracture risk.

This study was performed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a combined 
physical exercise and psychosocial intervention for children with cancer 
compared with usual care. Sixty-eight children, aged 8-18 years old, during or 
within the first year post-cancer treatment were randomised to the intervention 
(n = 30) and control group (n = 38). Health outcomes included fitness, muscle 
strength and quality adjusted life years; all administered at baseline, 4- and 
12-month follow-up. Costs were gathered by 1 monthly cost questionnaires over 
12 months, supplemented by medication data obtained from pharmacies. Results 
showed no significant differences in costs and effects between the intervention 
and control group at 12-month follow-up. On average, societal costs were €299 
higher in the intervention group than in the control group, but this difference 
was not significant. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated that the 
intervention needs large societal investments to reach reasonable probabilities 
of cost-effectiveness for quality of life and lower body muscle strength. Based 
on the results of this study, the intervention is not cost-effective in 
comparison with usual care.

UK.

Cardiovascular disease remains the most common cause of death in persons with 
diabetes regardless of age. Increasing age combined with diabetes exert a 
synergistic effect on the vascular system increasing the atherosclerosis burden 
in older people with diabetes. Due to their high baseline risk, they stand to 
benefit most from interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk. Older people with 
diabetes are functionally heterogeneous and their management is challenging. Fit 
and independent individuals are likely to benefit from tight targets while a 
relaxed approach putting quality of life at the heart of management plans is 
more appropriate in the frail and dependent individuals with limited life 
expectancy.

Replication and Extension of the Weight Loss For Life Community-Based Treatment 
Protocol.

Maintaining weight-loss beyond 6-9 months within behavioral treatments has been 
problematic. However, a social cognitive theory-driven, community-based 
curriculum emphasizing the generalization of physical activity-related 
self-regulation, to eating-related self-regulation (phase 1 treatment; n = 55), 
demonstrated success at both inducing lost weight over its initial 6 months, and 
maintaining that loss through month 24. The present replication study contrasted 
those outcomes with a phase 2 version of the year-long treatment (n = 74) that 
added a follow-up component during year 2 consisting of 5 brief phone 
interactions to reinforce self-regulatory skills. Participants were all women 
with obesity (body mass index 30-40 kg/m2; mean age = 48 years). In phase 2, the 
mean weight loss of 6.3% during baseline-month 6, and regain of 0.7% through 
month 24, did not significantly differ from phase 1. However, phase 2 methods 
were associated with significantly better retention of improvements in 
self-regulation, fruit/vegetable intake, and physical activity. For phase 2 
results, second-year change in fruit/vegetable consumption completely mediated 
the significant relationship between self-regulation and weight change, and 
change in physical activity completely mediated the significant relationship 
between self-regulation and weight change, over the 2-year study. Findings 
suggest the importance of moderate physical activity and more intensive 
follow-up focused on self-regulation processes.

PURPOSE: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of a new telemedicine 
technician-based assessment relative to an existing model of family physician 
(FP)-based assessment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in Singapore from the health 
system and societal perspectives.
DESIGN: Model-based, cost-effectiveness analysis of the Singapore Integrated 
Diabetic Retinopathy Program (SiDRP).
PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of patients aged 55 years with type 2 
diabetes previously not screened for DR.
METHODS: The SiDRP is a new telemedicine-based DR screening program using 
trained technicians to assess retinal photographs. We compared the 
cost-effectiveness of SiDRP with the existing model in which FPs assess 
photographs. We developed a hybrid decision tree/Markov model to simulate the 
costs, effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SiDRP 
relative to FP-based DR screening over a lifetime horizon. We estimated the 
costs from the health system and societal perspectives. Effectiveness was 
measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Result robustness was 
calculated using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The ICER.
RESULTS: From the societal perspective that takes into account all costs and 
effects, the telemedicine-based DR screening model had significantly lower costs 
(total cost savings of S$173 per person) while generating similar QALYs compared 
with the physician-based model (i.e., 13.1 QALYs). From the health system 
perspective that includes only direct medical costs, the cost savings are S$144 
per person. By extrapolating these data to approximately 170 000 patients with 
diabetes currently being screened yearly for DR in Singapore's primary care 
polyclinics, the present value of future cost savings associated with the 
telemedicine-based model is estimated to be S$29.4 million over a lifetime 
horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: While generating similar health outcomes, the telemedicine-based DR 
screening using technicians in the primary care setting saves costs for 
Singapore compared with the FP model. Our data provide a strong economic 
rationale to expand the telemedicine-based DR screening program in Singapore and 
elsewhere.

BACKGROUND: New drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are becoming 
available for the first time in over 40 y. Optimal strategies for introducing 
these drugs have not yet been established. The objective of this study was to 
compare different strategies for introducing the new TB drug bedaquiline based 
on patients' resistance patterns.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We created a Markov decision model to follow a 
hypothetical cohort of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB patients under different 
bedaquiline use strategies. The explored strategies included making bedaquiline 
available to all patients with MDR TB, restricting bedaquiline usage to patients 
with MDR plus additional resistance and withholding bedaquiline introduction 
completely. We compared these strategies according to life expectancy, risks of 
acquired resistance, and the expected number and health outcomes of secondary 
cases. For our simulated cohort, the mean (2.5th, 97.5th percentile) life 
expectancy from time of initiation of MDR TB treatment at age 30 was 36.0 y 
(33.5, 38.7) assuming all patients with MDR TB received bedaquiline, 35.1 y 
(34.4, 35.8) assuming patients with pre-extensively drug-resistant (PreXDR) and 
extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB received bedaquiline, and 34.9 y (34.6, 
35.2) assuming only patients with XDR TB received bedaquiline. Although 
providing bedaquiline to all MDR patients resulted in the highest life 
expectancy for our initial cohort averaged across all parameter sets, for 
parameter sets in which bedaquiline conferred high risks of added mortality and 
only small reductions in median time to culture conversion, the optimal strategy 
would be to withhold use even from patients with the most extensive resistance. 
Across all parameter sets, the most liberal bedaquiline use strategies 
consistently increased the risk of bedaquiline resistance but decreased the risk 
of resistance to other MDR drugs. In almost all cases, more liberal bedaquiline 
use strategies reduced the expected number of secondary cases and resulting life 
years lost. The generalizability of our results is limited by the lack of 
available data about drug effects among individuals with HIV co-infection, drug 
interactions, and other sources of heterogeneity, as well as changing 
recommendations for MDR TB treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: If mortality benefits can be empirically verified, our results 
provide support for expanding bedaquiline access to all patients with MDR TB. 
Such expansion could improve patients' health, protect background MDR TB drugs, 
and decrease transmission, but would likely result in greater resistance to 
bedaquiline.

BACKGROUND: People with diabetes have a high risk of developing micro- and 
macrovascular complications associated with diminished life expectancy and 
elevated treatment costs. Patient education programs can improve diabetes 
control in the short term, but their cost-effectiveness is uncertain. Our study 
aimed to analyze the lifelong cost-effectiveness of a nurse-led telecoaching 
program compared to usual care in people with type 2 diabetes from the 
perspective of the Belgian healthcare system.
METHODS: The UKPDS Outcomes Model was populated with patient-level data from an 
18-month randomized clinical trial in the Belgian primary care sector involving 
574 participants; trial data were extrapolated to 40 years; Quality Adjusted 
Life Years (QALYs), treatment costs and Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio 
(ICER) were calculated for the entire cohort and the subgroup with poor glycemic 
control at baseline ("elevated HbA1c subgroup") and the associated uncertainty 
was explored.
RESULTS: The cumulative mean QALY (95% CI) gain was 0.21 (0.13; 0.28) overall 
and 0.56 (0.43; 0.68) in elevated HbA1c subgroup; the respective incremental 
costs were €1,147 (188; 2,107) and €2,565 (654; 4,474) and the respective ICERs 
€5,569 (€677; €15,679) and €4,615 (1,207; 9,969) per QALY. In the scenario 
analysis, repeating the intervention for lifetime had the greatest impact on the 
cost-effectiveness and resulted in the mean ICERs of €13,034 in the entire 
cohort and €7,858 in the elevated HbA1c subgroup.
CONCLUSION: Taking into account reimbursement thresholds applied in 
West-European countries, nurse-led telecoaching of people with type 2 diabetes 
may be considered highly cost-effective within the Belgian healthcare system.

AIM: Paediatricians caring for severely ill children may receive requests for 
physician-assisted dying (PAD). Dutch euthanasia law only applies to patients 
over 12 who make well-considered requests. These limitations have been widely 
debated, but little is known about paediatricians' positions on PAD. We explored 
the situations in which paediatricians found PAD conceivable and described the 
roles of the patient and parents, the patient's age and their life expectancy.
METHODS: We sent a questionnaire to a national sample of 276 Dutch 
paediatricians and carried out semi-structured interviews with eight 
paediatricians.
RESULTS: The response rate was 62%. Most paediatricians said performing PAD on 
request was conceivable (81%), conceivability was independent of the patient's 
age and whether the patient or parent(s) requested it. The paediatricians 
interviewed felt a duty to relieve suffering, irrespective of the patient's age 
or competency to decide. When this was not possible through palliative care, PAD 
was seen as an option for all patients who were suffering unbearably, although 
some paediatricians saw parental agreement and reduced life expectancy as 
prerequisites.
CONCLUSION: Most Dutch paediatricians felt PAD was conceivable, even under the 
age of 12 if requested by the parents. They seemed driven by a sense of duty to 
relieve suffering.

Nanoscaled Porphyrinic Metal-Organic Frameworks for Electrochemical Detection of 
Telomerase Activity via Telomerase Triggered Conformation Switch.

In this work, we designed a nanoscaled porphyrinic metal-organic framework 
(PorMOF) with iron porphyrin as linker and zirconium ion as node for 
electrochemical detection of telomerase activity. The as-prepared PorMOF was 
characterized with scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and 
spectroscopic techniques and demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity 
toward O2 reduction. Sequentially, the functionalization of PorMOF with 
streptavidin results in a water-stable electrochemical tracer for detection of 
telomerase. Upon the telomerase-triggered extension, the assistant DNA 1 
(aDNA1)-assistant DNA 2 (aDNA2) duplex could switch into a hairpin structure, 
and thus, the aDNA2 was released and then hybridized with the capture DNA. 
Therefore, the PorMOF@SA tracer could be introduced on the electrode surface via 
biotin-streptavidin recognition, leading to the strong electrochemical signal 
for readout. The developed approach displayed desirable dynamic range and 
limitation of detection down to 30 HeLa cells mL-1. The telomerase activity was 
2.2 × 10-11 IU in a single HeLa cell with good reproducibility and stability. 
The nanoscaled porphyrinic MOF provided a powerful platform for electrochemical 
signal transduction and had a promising application in the determination of 
various biomolecules.

    Breast Cancer Res. 2016 Jul 26;18(1):71.

The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) theory focuses on the 
consequences of periconceptional and in utero exposures. A wide range of 
environmental conditions during early development are now being investigated as 
a driving force for epigenetic disruptions that enhance disease risk in later 
life, including cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine, and mental disorders and 
even breast cancer. Most studies involve mother-child dyads, with less focus on 
environmental influences through the father. Over the last few years, however, 
new insights have been introduced on paternal effects and the plasticity of the 
epigenome of developing sperm cells have been proposed to underlie inheritable 
changes from ancestral exposures. The field is evolving rapidly and study 
results from animal models are promising. Although caution should be taken in 
translating animal data to humans, epidemiological findings also suggest a 
prominent role of the father. Therefore, we here propose an extension to the 
DOHaD theory to include also paternally inheritable influences.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) accounts approximately for 0.2% of 
cases of acute coronary syndrome. It is defined "spontaneous" in absence of any 
coronary wall damage. This disease affects primarily young women in good health, 
with no risk factors for coronary artery disease, especially during the 
postpartum period. Since the clinical presentation varies widely from no 
symptoms to typical angina and sudden cardiac death, SCAD incidence is 
underestimated.A 40-year-old woman, in the 8th week after delivery, was admitted 
to our emergency department because of acute chest pain, and a diagnosis of 
inferior and posterior non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction was made. 
Emergency coronary angiography showed a small SCAD of the distal segment of a 
little marginal branch. Because of the small dimension of the dissection, 
optimal medical therapy was started. However, two days later, symptoms recurred 
and the ECG showed an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The patient 
was therefore transferred to the cath lab and coronary angiography showed 
extensive dissection of the left anterior descending coronary artery with good 
angiographic result. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed and three 
drug-eluting stents were implanted.No retrospective studies or randomized 
clinical trials are available to guide the best treatment option in patients 
with SCAD, because of the wide variety of clinical presentation and the rarity 
of the pathology. Early and correct diagnosis of SCAD is key for adequate 
management. First, the site and precise quantification of lesion severity should 
be assessed with multiple angiographic projections. Intravascular ultrasound and 
optical coherence tomography can provide additional information about the entry 
point of the lesion. Hemodynamic status and extension of the myocardium at risk 
should be also evaluated to determine the best therapeutic strategy. Since the 
presence of SCAD may be associated with aneurysm formation and dissections of 
other arteries, screening of the arterial tree may be useful, especially of the 
supra-aortic trunks and splanchnic circulation.

Review of endoscopic radiofrequency in biliopancreatic tumours with emphasis on 
clinical benefits, controversies and safety.

Most pancreatic cancers and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas are unresectable at 
the time of diagnosis, and even in case of a resectable cancer, for elderly or 
patients with coexistent comorbidities, surgery is not an option. Current 
treatment alternatives in these scenarios are very limited. Biliary stenting 
with self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) is the mainstay palliative treatment of 
biliary obstruction due to unresectable pancreatic cancer or cholangiocarcinoma. 
Nevertheless, more than 50% of SEMS become occluded after 6 mo due to tumour 
over- and ingrowth, leading to hospital readmissions and reinterventions that 
significantly impair quality of life. Regimes of chemotherapy or 
chemoradiotherapy also provide minimal survival benefits. Therefore, novel 
therapies are eagerly awaited. Radiofrequency (RF) energy causes coagulative 
necrosis leading to local destruction of the accessed malignant tissue and has 
an established role in the treatment of malignancies in several solid organs, 
especially liver cancers. However, pancreatic and extrahepatic biliary cancers 
are not easily accessed by a percutaneous route, making the procedure dangerous. 
Over the past five years, the development of dedicated devices compatible with 
endoscopic instruments has offered a minimally invasive option for RF energy 
delivery in biliopancreatic cancers. Emerging experience with endoscopic RF 
ablation (RFA) in this setting has been reported in the literature, but little 
is known about its feasibility, efficacy and safety. A literature review makes 
it clear that RFA in biliopancreatic tumours is feasible with high rates of 
technical success and acceptable safety profile. Although available data suggest 
a benefit of survival with RFA, there is not enough evidence to draw a firm 
conclusion about its efficacy. For this reason, prospective randomized trials 
comparing RFA with standard palliative treatments with quality-of-life and 
survival endpoints are required. Anecdotal reports have also highlighted a 
potential curative role of RFA in small pancreatic tumours and benign 
conditions, such as ductal extension of ampullomas, intrahepatic adenomas or 
non-tumoural biliary strictures. These newest indications also deserve further 
examination in larger series of studies.

OBJECTIVES: The Implantable Systems Performance Registry (ISPR) was created to 
monitor the product performance of Medtronic Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) and 
implanted intrathecal drug infusion systems available in the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected on 2605 patients from 44 centers from 
various geographic regions across the United States implanting and following 
patients with SCS systems between June 25, 2004 and January 31, 2014. Actuarial 
life table methods are used to estimate device performance over time. Of the 
2605 patients, 1490 (57.2%) were female, 1098 (42.1%) were male and 17 (0.7%) 
did not provide gender data. The average age at enrollment was 56.3 years 
(range: 4-97, SD = 14.3) and average follow-up time was 20.1 months (SD = 22.5).
RESULTS: Currently the estimates of device survival from neurostimulator-related 
events exceed 97% for all neurostimulator models across the applicable follow-up 
time points and all applicable extension models had greater than 95% survival 
from extension events. The majority of product performance events were 
lead-related. At 5 years of follow-up, all applicable lead families, with the 
exception of the Pisces-Quad LZ family, had greater than 75% survival from lead 
events.
CONCLUSIONS: The ISPR is designed to serve as an ongoing source of system and 
device-related information with a focus on "real-world" safety and product 
performance. ISPR data continue to be used to guide future product development 
efforts aimed at improving product reliability and quality.

dementia: a registry study.

BACKGROUND: Both persons with intellectual disability (ID) and persons with 
dementia have high disease burdens, and consequently also high health care 
needs. As life expectancy increases for persons with ID, the group of persons 
with the dual diagnosis of ID and dementia will become larger.
METHOD: Through national registries, we identified 7936 persons who had received 
support directed to persons with ID during 2012, and an age- and gender-matched 
sample from the general population. A national registry was also used to collect 
information on health care utilisation (excluding primary care) for the period 
2002-2012. Health care utilisation was measured as presence and number of 
planned and unplanned in-patient and out-patient visits, as well as length of 
stay.
RESULTS: In comparison with persons with ID but without dementia, persons with 
ID and dementia were more likely to have at least one planned out-patient visit 
(odds ratio [OR] 8.07), unplanned out-patient visit (OR 2.41), planned 
in-patient visit (OR 2.76) or unplanned in-patient visit (OR 4.19). However, 
among those with at least one of each respective outcome, the average number of 
visits did not differ between those with and without dementia. Persons with ID 
and dementia were less likely to have at least one planned out-patient visit 
than persons with dementia in the general population sample (OR 0.40), but more 
likely to have at least one unplanned in-patient visit (OR 1.90). No 
statistically significant differences were found for having at least one 
unplanned out-patient or planned in-patient visit. Nevertheless, among those 
with at least one unplanned out-patient visit, the number of visits was higher 
in the general population sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Persons with ID and dementia are less likely to receive planned 
health care than persons with dementia in the general population. They have, 
however, higher levels of unplanned health care utilisation. This may be an 
indication that the current support system is not sufficient to meet the 
challenges of increased longevity among persons with ID.

The truth about ageing in the future.

Allen D.

Every minute that you spend reading this article, the average life expectancy in 
Britain will rise by 12 seconds. That was the arresting claim made at the start 
of a four- page feature by Alok Jha in The Guardian on 'the future of old age'. 
So by this time tomorrow, life expectancy will have risen by nearly five hours.
