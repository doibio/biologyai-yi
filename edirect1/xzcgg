Radiation therapy is commonly used for prostate cancer treatment; however, 
normal tissues can be damaged from the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by 
radiation. In separate reports, we and others have shown that manganese 
porphyrins (MnPs), ROS scavengers, protect normal cells from radiation-induced 
damage but inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. However, there have been no 
studies demonstrating that MnPs protect normal tissues, while inhibiting tumor 
growth in the same model. LNCaP or PC3 cells were orthotopically implanted into 
athymic mice and treated with radiation (2 Gy, for 5 consecutive days) in the 
presence or absence of MnPs. With radiation, MnPs enhanced overall life 
expectancy and significantly decreased the average tumor volume, as compared to 
the radiated alone group. MnPs enhanced lipid oxidation in tumor cells but 
reduced oxidative damage to normal prostate tissue adjacent to the prostate 
tumor in combination with radiation. Mechanistically, MnPs behave as 
pro-oxidants or antioxidants depending on the level of oxidative stress inside 
the treated cell. We found that MnPs act as pro-oxidants in prostate cancer 
cells, while in normal cells and tissues the MnPs act as antioxidants. For the 
first time, in the same in vivo model, this study reveals that MnPs enhance the 
tumoricidal effect of radiation and reduce oxidative damage to normal prostate 
tissue adjacent to the prostate tumor in the presence of radiation. This study 
suggests that MnPs are effective radio-protectors for radiation-mediated 
prostate cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: models projecting future disease burden have focussed on one or two 
diseases. Little is known on how risk factors of younger cohorts will play out 
in the future burden of multi-morbidity (two or more concurrent long-term 
conditions).
DESIGN: a dynamic microsimulation model, the Population Ageing and Care 
Simulation (PACSim) model, simulates the characteristics (sociodemographic 
factors, health behaviours, chronic diseases and geriatric conditions) of 
individuals over the period 2014-2040.
POPULATION: about 303,589 individuals aged 35 years and over (a 1% random sample 
of the 2014 England population) created from Understanding Society, the English 
Longitudinal Study of Ageing, and the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study II.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the prevalence of, numbers with, and years lived with, 
chronic diseases, geriatric conditions and multi-morbidity.
RESULTS: between 2015 and 2035, multi-morbidity prevalence is estimated to 
increase, the proportion with 4+ diseases almost doubling (2015:9.8%; 
2035:17.0%) and two-thirds of those with 4+ diseases will have mental ill-health 
(dementia, depression, cognitive impairment no dementia). Multi-morbidity 
prevalence in incoming cohorts aged 65-74 years will rise (2015:45.7%; 
2035:52.8%). Life expectancy gains (men 3.6 years, women: 2.9 years) will be 
spent mostly with 4+ diseases (men: 2.4 years, 65.9%; women: 2.5 years, 85.2%), 
resulting from increased prevalence of rather than longer survival with 
multi-morbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: our findings indicate that over the next 20 years there will be an 
expansion of morbidity, particularly complex multi-morbidity (4+ diseases). We 
advocate for a new focus on prevention of, and appropriate and efficient service 
provision for those with, complex multi-morbidity.

BACKGROUND: The Socio-Technical Allocation of Resources (STAR) has been 
developed for value for money analysis of health services through stakeholder 
workshops. This article reports on its application for prioritization of 
interventions within public health programmes.
METHODS: The STAR tool was used by identifying costs and service activity for 
interventions within commissioned public health programmes, with benefits 
estimated from the literature on economic evaluations in terms of costs per 
Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs); consensus on how these QALY values applied 
to local services was obtained with local commissioners.
RESULTS: Local cost-effectiveness estimates could be made for some 
interventions. Methodological issues arose from gaps in the evidence base for 
other interventions, inability to closely match some performance monitoring data 
with interventions, and disparate time horizons of published QALY data. 
Practical adjustment for these issues included using population prevalences and 
utility states where intervention specific evidence was lacking, and subdivision 
of large contracts into specific intervention costs using staffing ratios. The 
STAR approach proved useful in informing commissioning decisions and 
understanding the relative value of local public health interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Further work is needed to improve robustness of the process and 
develop a visualization tool for use by public health departments.

[Article in Bulgarian]

Gavrailova D, Dimitrova A, Hadgideleva D.

Recently, in connection with the increased life expectancy; considerable 
interest in the problems of menopause has risen. The climax is a natural 
biological period of a woman's life during which a decrease in the production of 
sex hormones occurs. In response to the sharp decline in estrogen and altered 
hormonal environment characterizing menopause, a number of unfavourable changes 
in metabolism develop, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 
deterioration in the quality of life of menopausal women.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a complex 
disease, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. AD represents 70% of all 
dementia cases, affecting up to 50% of elderly persons aged 85 or older, with 
functional dependence, poor quality of life, institutionalization and mortality. 
Advanced age is the main risk factor of AD, that is why population ageing, due 
to life expectancy improvements, increases AD incidence and prevalence, as well 
as the economic, social, and emotional costs associated with this illness. 
Existing anti-AD drugs present some limitations, as they target specific 
downstream neurochemical abnormalities while the upstream underlying pathology 
continues unchecked. Chronic hypertension has been suggested as one of the 
largest modifiable risk factors for developing AD. At least 25% of all adults 
and more than 50% of those over 60 years of age have hypertension. 
Epidemiological studies have shown that hypertension is a risk factor for 
dementia and AD, but the association is complex. Some studies have demonstrated 
that antihypertensive drugs can reduce the risk of AD. This review focuses on 
current knowledge about the relationship between chronic hypertension and AD as 
well as antihypertensive treatment effect on AD pathogenesis and its clinical 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Adults aged 18-64¬†years with comorbid conditions are at high risk 
for complications of certain vaccine-preventable diseases, including influenza 
and pneumococcal disease. The 4 Pillars‚Ñ¢ Practice Transformation Program (4 
Pillars Program) increases uptake of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, 
influenza vaccine and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine by 5-10% 
among adults with high-risk medical conditions, but its cost-effectiveness is 
unknown.
METHODS: A decision tree model estimated the cost-effectiveness of implementing 
the 4 Pillars Program in primary care practices compared to no program for a 
population of adults 18-64¬†years of age at high risk of illness complications 
over a 10¬†year time horizon. Vaccination rates and intervention costs were 
derived from a randomized controlled cluster trial in diverse practices in 
2¬†U.S. cities. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: From a third-party payer perspective, which considers direct medical 
costs, the 4 Pillars Program cost $28,301 per quality-adjusted life year gained; 
from a societal perspective, which adds direct nonmedical and indirect costs, 
the program was cost saving and more effective than no intervention. Cost 
effectiveness results favoring the program were robust in sensitivity analyses. 
From a public health standpoint, the model predicted that the intervention 
reduced influenza cases by 1.4%, with smaller decreases in pertussis and 
pneumococcal disease cases.
CONCLUSION: The 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program is an economically 
reasonable, and perhaps cost saving, strategy for protecting the health of 
adults aged <‚Äâ65¬†years with high-risk medical conditions.

OBJECTIVES: Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The 
number of deaths and years of life lost (YLL) due to a disease can be used to 
monitor health status, assess healthcare needs and determine the prioritisation 
and allocation of health resources within a population; in addition, the latter 
calculation can serve as a baseline indicator of premature mortality. This study 
aimed to measure prostate cancer-related mortality and YLL in Yazd Province, 
Iran.
METHODS: This study included all prostate cancer-related deaths in Yazd Province 
reported between March 2001 and March 2010. Mortality data were obtained from a 
provincial death registration system which integrates data from different 
sources. YLL was calculated based on an individual's age at death and their life 
expectancy according to age group.
RESULTS: During the study period, prostate cancer was the fourth most common 
fatal cancer among men, resulting in 324 deaths or 10.0% of all cancer-related 
deaths. The crude mortality rate per 100,000 individuals increased from 4.7 in 
2001 to 8.8 in 2010. Premature deaths caused 1,358.7 YLL and the YLL caused by 
prostate cancer deaths more than doubled from 94.7 in 2001 to 196.5 in 2010.
CONCLUSION: Due to changes in population structure, it is likely that the burden 
of prostate cancer will continue to increase in Yazd Province. As such, it is 
necessary that the national health system implements screening programmes and 
improves public awareness of prostate cancer-associated risk factors.

Acute ischemia of an extremity occurs in several stages, a lack of oxygen being 
the primary contributor of the event. Although underlying patho-mechanisms are 
similar, it is important to determine whether it is an acute or chronic event. 
Healthy tissue does not contain enlarged collaterals, which are formed in 
chronically malperfused tissue and can maintain a minimum supply despite 
occlusion. The underlying processes for enhanced collateral blood flow are 
sprouting vessels from pre-existing vessels (via angiogenesis) and a lumen 
extension of arterioles (via arteriogenesis). While disturbed flow patterns with 
associated local low shear stress upregulate angiogenesis promoting genes, 
elevated shear stress may trigger arteriogenesis due to increased blood volume. 
In case of an acute ischemia, especially during the reperfusion phase, fluid 
transfer occurs into the tissue while the vascular bed is simultaneously reduced 
and no longer reacts to vaso-relaxing factors such as nitric oxide. This process 
results in an exacerbative cycle, in which increased peripheral resistance leads 
to an additional lack of oxygen. This whole process is accompanied by an 
inundation of inflammatory cells, which amplify the inflammatory response by 
cytokine release. However, an extremity is an individual-specific composition of 
different tissues, so these processes may vary dramatically between patients. 
The image is more uniform when broken down to the single cell stage. Because 
each cell is dependent on energy produced from aerobic respiration, an event of 
acute hypoxia can be a life-threatening situation. Aerobic processes responsible 
for yielding adenosine triphosphate (ATP), such as the electron transport chain 
and oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria, suffer first, thus disrupting 
the integrity of cellular respiration. One consequence of this is irreparable 
damage of the cell membrane due to an imbalance of electrolytes. The eventual 
increase in net fluid influx associated with a decrease in intracellular pH is 
considered an end-stage event. Due to the lack of ATP, individual cell 
organelles can no longer sustain their activity, thus initiating the cascade 
pathways of apoptosis via the release of cytokines such as the BCL2 associated X 
protein (BAX). As ischemia may lead to direct necrosis, inflammatory processes 
are further aggravated. In the case of reperfusion, the flow of nascent oxygen 
will cause additional damage to the cell, further initiating apoptosis in 
additional surrounding cells. In particular, free oxygen radicals are formed, 
causing severe damage to cell membranes and desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). 
However, the increased tissue stress caused by this process may be transient, as 
radical scavengers may attenuate the damage. Taking the above into final 
consideration, it is clearly elucidated that acute ischemia and subsequent 
reperfusion is a process that leads to acute tissue damage combined with 
end-organ loss of function, a condition that is difficult to counteract.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy at birth (LE) has been calculated for states and 
counties. LE estimates at these levels mask health disparities in local 
communities. There are no nationwide estimates at the sub-county level. We 
present a stepwise approach for calculating LE using census tracts in New York 
state to identify health disparities.
METHODS: Our study included 2751 census tracts in New York state, but excluded 
New York City. We used population data from the 2010 United States Census and 
2008-2010 mortality data from the state health department. Tracts were assigned 
to 99.97% of the deaths. We removed tracts which had a majority of people living 
in group quarters. Deaths in these tracts are often recorded elsewhere. Of the 
remaining 2679 tracts, 6.6% of the tracts had standard errors ‚â• 2 years. A 
geographic aggregation tool was used to aggregate tracts with fewer than 60 
deaths, and then aggregate areas that had standard errors of ‚â• 2 years.
RESULTS: Aggregation resulted in a 9.9% reduction in the number of areas. Tracts 
with <‚Äâ2% of population living below the poverty level had a LE of 82.8¬†years, 
while tracts with a poverty level‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ25% had a LE of 75.5. We observed 
differences in LE in border areas, of up to 10.4¬†years, when excluding or 
including deaths of study area residents that occurred outside the study area. 
The range and standard deviation at the county level (77.5-82.8, SD‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.2¬†years) 
were smaller than our final sub-county areas (64.7-92.0, SD‚Äâ=‚Äâ3.3¬†years). The 
correlation between LE and poverty were similar and statistically significant 
(p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001) at the county (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ-‚Äâ0.58) and sub-county level (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ-‚Äâ0.58). The 
correlations between LE and percent African-American at the county level were 
(r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.11, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.43) and at the sub-county level (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ-‚Äâ0.25, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The proposed approach for geocoding and aggregation of mortality and 
population data provides a solution for health departments to produce stable 
empirically-derived LE estimates using data coded to the tract. Reliable 
estimates within sub-county areas are needed to aid public health officials in 
focusing preventive health programs in areas where health disparities would be 
masked by county level estimates.

The Winding Path Towards an Inverse Relationship Between Sun Exposure and 
All-cause Mortality.

For a long time, skin cancer has been known to be related to extensive UV 
exposure. New emerging data have, however, shown low UV exposure/low vitamin D 
levels to be related to increased mortality rate due to skin cancer. In 
addition, low sun exposure habits in regions of low solar intensity have been 
shown to be a major risk factor for all-cause mortality in the same range as 
that for smoking. This is mainly due to lower all-cause mortality due to 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD/non-cancer disease among women with 
active sun exposure. Women with active sun exposure habits were estimated to 
have a 1- to 2-year longer life-expectancy during the Melanoma in Southern 
Sweden study interval. These findings are in line with those to be expected from 
an evolutionary perspective and research findings, but in opposition to present 
guidelines and recommendations.

Objective: To analyze the deaths attributable to alcohol use and its impact on 
people's life expectancy in China in 2013. Methods: The mortality data from the 
Disease Surveillance Points System and alcohol use data from China Chronic 
Disease Surveillance (2013) were used. The deaths attributed to alcohol use and 
its impact on the life expectancy of Chinese residents were estimated based on 
the principle of comparative risk assessment by calculating population 
attributable fraction. Results: In 2013, alcohol use resulted in 381 200 deaths, 
including 97 100 hemorrhagic stroke deaths, 88 200 liver cancer deaths, 61 400 
liver cirrhosis deaths and 48 700 esophageal cancer deaths, and prevented 76 500 
deaths, including 68 500, 4 900 and 3 100 deaths which might be caused by 
ischemic heart disease, hemorrhagic stroke and diabetes respectively. If risk 
factor of alcohol use is removed, the people's life expectancy would rise by an 
average of 0.43 years, especially in western China by 0.52 years, which was 0.12 
years higher than that in eastern and central China, and the life expectancy of 
the population in rural and urban areas would rise by 0.48 years and 0.31 years 
respectively. Conclusions: Although alcohol has a protective effect on reducing 
ischemic heart disease, stroke and diabetes deaths, alcohol use is still a risk 
factor influencing the mortality and life expectancy of residents in China. It 
is necessary to take targeted measures to reduce the health problems caused by 
harmful use of alcohol.

Mexico is experiencing a demographic transition in which the percentage of the 
population older than 50 years of age is growing rapidly as a result of 
increases in life expectancy. This population has special needs that must be 
taken into account when formulating policy, especially in terms of access to 
health care services and social security. In this article we present a general 
description of the Mexican Health and Aging Survey (MHAS), a panel study that 
began in 2001 and that provides a unique opportunity to study complex 
demographic and economic issues through the exploration of personal 
characteristics, socioeconomic transfers and health indicators for a sample of 
15 186 middle and older age adults. We also present the most important results 
from different studies that have used MHAS up to date. Our review shows that 
Mexico faces substantial challenges in order to be able to satisfy the demand 
for health services for a population that is being increasingly threatened by 
chronic disease, particularly the elderly population that lacks health insurance 
coverage.

M√©xico vive una transici√≥n demogr√°fica en la cual el porcentaje de la poblaci√≥n 
mayor de 50 a√±os de edad crece aceleradamente como resultado de un aumento 
considerable en la esperanza de vida. Dicha poblaci√≥n tiene necesidades 
particulares que deben ser tomadas en cuenta en la formulaci√≥n de pol√≠ticas, 
sobre todo en materia de acceso a servicios de salud y seguridad social. En este 
art√≠culo presentamos una descripci√≥n general de la Encuesta Nacional de Salud y 
Envejecimiento (Enasem), un estudio de panel que comenz√≥ en 2001 y que ofrece 
una oportunidad √∫nica para abordar temas demogr√°ficos y econ√≥micos complejos por 
medio de la exploraci√≥n de las caracter√≠sticas personales, transferencias 
socioecon√≥micas e indicadores de salud para una muestra de 15 186 adultos de 
edad media y avanzada. Tambi√©n presentamos los resultados m√°s relevantes de 
diferentes estudios que han utilizado la Enasem hasta la fecha. Nuestra revisi√≥n 
indica que M√©xico enfrenta desaf√≠os considerables para satisfacer la demanda de 
servicios m√©dicos para una poblaci√≥n que es amenazada por una creciente 
presencia de enfermedades cr√≥nicas, sobre todo para la poblaci√≥n de edad 
avanzada que no cuenta con cobertura de seguro m√©dico.

An Experimental Evaluation of Competing Age-Predictions of Future Time 
Perspective between Workplace and Retirement Domains.

Future time perspective (FTP) is defined as "perceptions of the future as being 
limited or open-ended" (Lang and Carstensen, 2002; p. 125). The construct 
figures prominently in both workplace and retirement domains, but the 
age-predictions are competing: Workplace research predicts decreasing FTP 
age-change, in contrast, retirement scholars predict increasing FTP age-change. 
For the first time, these competing predictions are pitted in an experimental 
manipulation of subjective life expectancy (SLE). A sample of N = 207 older 
adults (age 45-60) working full-time (>30-h/week) were randomly assigned to SLE 
questions framed as either 'Live-to' or 'Die-by' to evaluate competing 
predictions for FTP. Results indicate general support for decreasing age-change 
in FTP, indicated by independent-sample t-tests showing lower FTP in the 
'Die-by' framing condition. Further general-linear model analyses were conducted 
to test for interaction effects of retirement planning with experimental 
framings on FTP and intended retirement; While retirement planning buffered 
FTP's decrease, simple-effects also revealed that retirement planning increased 
intentions for sooner retirement, but lack of planning increased intentions for 
later retirement. Discussion centers on practical implications of our findings 
and consequences validity evidence in future empirical research of FTP in both 
workplace and retirement domains.

A novel moderately halophilic, Gram-stain negative and aerobic bacterium, 
designated strain TBZ21T, was isolated from a water sample of Urmia Lake, Iran. 
Cells were observed to be non-motile rods with no flagellum, showing positive 
catalase and oxidase reactions. Strain TBZ21T was found to grow at 10-40¬†¬∞C 
(optimum, 30¬†¬∞C), at pH 7-10 (optimum, pH 8) and in the presence of 1-22% 
(optimum, 10%). The major fatty acids were identified as C19:0 cyclo œâ8c, C16:0, 
Summed features 3 (C13:0 3-OH and/or iso-C15:1 H) and 8 (C18:1 œâ7c and/or C18:1 
œâ6c) and C12:0 3-OH. The major polar lipids were identified as 
diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an 
unidentified phosphoaminolipid. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain TBZ21T was 
determined to be 63.3¬†mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene 
sequences indicated that strain TBZ21T belongs to the genus Halomonas, and shows 
high sequence similarities to Halomonas fontilapidosi 5CRT (99.43%), Halomonas 
ventosae AL12T (98.64%), Halomonas sediminicola CPS11T (98.63%) and Halomonas 
aestuarii Hb3T (98.08%), and has low similarities (below 98.0%) with other 
members of the genus. The values of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain TBZ21T 
and the closely related strains H. fontilapidosi LMG 24455T and H. ventosae LMG 
26187T were 42¬†¬±¬†11% and 54¬†¬±¬†16%, respectively. On the basis of phenotypic, 
chemotaxonomic and molecular characteristics, strain TBZ21T is concluded to 
represent a novel species of the genus Halomonas, for which the name Halomonas 
tabrizica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TBZ21T (=LMG 25445T=DSM 
23018T).

OBJECTIVE: To compare 1-year costs and benefits of dapagliflozin (DAPA), a 
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, with those of other 
treatments for type 2 diabetes (T2D), such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
agonists (GLP-1RAs), sulfonylureas (SUs), thiazolidinediones (TZDs), and 
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), all combined with metformin.
METHODS: A short-term decision-analytic model with a 1-year time horizon was 
developed from a payer's perspective in the United States setting. Costs and 
benefits associated with four clinical end-points (glycated hemoglobin [A1C], 
body weight, systolic blood pressure [SBP], and risk of hypoglycemia) were 
evaluated in the analysis. The impact of DAPA and other glucose-lowering therapy 
classes on these clinical end-points was estimated from a network meta-analysis 
(NMA). Data for costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with a 
per-unit change in these clinical end-points were taken from published 
literature. Drug prices were taken from an annual wholesale price list. All 
costs were inflation-adjusted to December 2016 costs using the medical care 
component of the consumer price index. Total costs (both medical and drug 
costs), total QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were 
estimated. Sensitivity analyses (SA) were performed to explore uncertainty in 
the inputs. To assess face validity, results from the short-term model were 
compared with long-term models published for these drugs.
RESULTS: The total annual medical cost for DAPA was less than that for GLP-1RA 
($186 less), DPP-4i ($1,142 less), SU ($2,474 less), and TZD ($1,640 less). 
Treatment with DAPA resulted in an average QALY gain of 0.0107, 0.0587, 0.1137, 
and 0.0715 per treated patient when compared with GLP-1RA, DPP-4i, SU, and TZD, 
respectively. ICERs for DAPA vs SU and TZD were $19,005 and $25,835, 
respectively. DAPA was a cost-saving option when compared with GLP-1RAs and 
DPP-4is. Among all four clinical end-points, change in weight had the greatest 
impact on total annual costs and ICERS. Sensitivity analysis showed that results 
were robust, and results from the short-term model were found to be similar to 
those of published long-term models.
CONCLUSION: This analysis showed that DAPA was cost-saving compared with GLP-1RA 
and DPP-4i, and cost-effective compared with SU and TZD in the US setting over 1 
year. Furthermore, the results suggest that, among the four composite clinical 
end-points, change in weight and SBP had an impact on cost-effectiveness 
results.

The mechanisms underlying life span extension by sulfur amino acid restriction 
(SAAR) are unclear. Cysteine and methionine are essential for the biosynthesis 
of proteins and glutathione (GSH), a major redox buffer in the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER). We hypothesized that SAAR alters protein synthesis by modulating 
the redox milieu. Male F344-rats were fed control (CD: 0.86% methionine without 
cysteine) and SAAR diets (0.17% methionine without cysteine) for 12 weeks. 
Growth rates, food intake, cysteine and GSH levels, proteins associated with 
redox status and translation, and fractional protein synthesis rates (FSRs) were 
determined in liver. Despite a 40% higher food intake, growth rates for SAAR 
rats were 27% of those fed CD. Hepatic free cysteine in SAAR rats was 55% 
compared with CD rats. SAAR altered tissue distribution of GSH, as hepatic and 
erythrocytic levels were 56% and 196% of those in CD rats. Lower GSH levels did 
not induce ER stress (i.e., unchanged expression of Xbp1s , Chop, and Grp78), 
but activated PERK and its substrates eIF2-Œ± and NRF2. SAAR-induced changes in 
translation-initiation machinery (higher p-eIF2-Œ± and 4E-BP1, and lower eIF4G-1) 
resulted in slower protein synthesis rates (53% of CD). Proteins involved in the 
antioxidant response (NRF2, KEAP1, GCLM, and NQO1) and protein folding (PDI and 
ERO1-Œ±) were increased in SAAR. Lower FSR and efficient protein folding might be 
improving proteostasis in SAAR.

AIMS: Insulin therapy is indicated for people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus; 
however, treatment-related weight gain and hypoglycaemia represent barriers to 
optimal glycaemic management. This study assessed the health economic value of 
maintained reductions in HbA1c , BMI and hypoglycaemia incidence among the UK 
Type 1 diabetes population.
METHODS: The Cardiff Type 1 Diabetes Model was used to estimate lifetime costs, 
life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for individuals with Type 1 
diabetes at different baseline HbA1c , BMI and hypoglycaemic event rates. 
Results were discounted at 3.5%, and the net monetary benefit associated with 
improving Type 1 diabetes management was derived at ¬£20¬†000/QALY gained. 
Per-person outputs were inflated to national levels using UK Type 1 diabetes 
prevalence estimates.
RESULTS: Modelled subjects with an HbA1c of 86¬†mmol/mol (10.0%) were associated 
with discounted lifetime per-person costs of ¬£23¬†795; ¬£12¬†649 of which may be 
avoided by maintaining an HbA1c of 42¬†mmol/mol (6.0%). Combined with estimated 
QALY gains of 2.80, an HbA1c of 42¬†mmol/mol (6.0%) vs. 86¬†mmol/mol (10.0%) was 
associated with a ¬£68¬†621 per-person net monetary benefit. Over 1¬†year, unit 
reductions in BMI produced ¬£120 per-person net monetary benefit, and up to ¬£197 
for the avoidance of one non-severe hypoglyceamic event.
CONCLUSIONS: Maintained reductions in HbA1c significantly alleviate the burden 
associated with Type 1 diabetes in the UK. Given the influence of weight and 
hypoglycaemia on health economic outcomes, they must also be key considerations 
when assessing the value of Type 1 diabetes technologies in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Earlier studies show that the main reasons for admission to 
long-term nursing home care are cognitive impairment and functional impairments 
of activities of daily life. However, descriptive evidence of mobility is scant. 
The aims of this study were to describe mobility at admission to nursing homes 
and to assess the association between mobility and degree of dementia.
METHODS: We included 696 residents at admission to 47 nursing homes in Norway. 
Inclusion criteria were expected stay for more than 4¬†weeks and 65¬†years or 
older. In addition, younger residents with dementia were included. Residents 
with life expectancy shorter than six weeks were excluded. Mobility was assessed 
using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and the Nursing Home Life 
Space Diameter (NHLSD). The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) was used to 
describe the degree of dementia. The associations between mobility and degree of 
dementia was analysed using the Chi-square and the Kruskal-Wallis test 
(KW-test). When the KW-test indicated a statistical significant difference, we 
proceeded with planned group comparisons with the Mann-Whitney U-test. In 
addition, we performed multiple linear regression analyses to control for 
potential confounders.
RESULTS: Forty-three percent of the residents were not able to perform the 
balance test in SPPB. Twenty-four percent of the residents were not able to walk 
four meters, while only 17.6% had a walking speed of 0.83¬†m/s or higher. 
Sixty-two percent of the residents were not able to rise from a chair or spent 
more than 60¬†s doing it. The median score on NHLSD area was 22 (IQR 17) and the 
median score on NHLSD dependency was 36 (IQR 26). Residents with severe dementia 
had significantly lower levels of mobility than residents with moderate 
dementia. Cognitive function was associated with SPPB and NHLSD dependency in 
the adjusted models.
CONCLUSION: Nursing home residents form a frail, but heterogeneous group both in 
terms of cognition and mobility at admission. Mobility was negatively associated 
with cognitive function, and residents with severe dementia had significantly 
lower levels of mobility than residents with moderate dementia.

BACKGROUND: Cutaneous leishmaniasis causes a high disease burden in Colombia, 
and available treatments present systemic toxicity, low patient compliance, 
contraindications, and high costs. The purpose of this study was to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of thermotherapy versus Glucantime in patients with cutaneous 
leishmaniasis in Colombia.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness study from an institutional perspective in 8133 
incident cases. Data on therapeutic efficacy and safety were included, 
calculating standard costs; the outcomes were disability adjusted life years 
(DALYs) and the number of patients cured. The information sources were the 
Colombian Public Health Surveillance System, disease burden studies, and one 
meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials. Incremental cost-effectiveness was 
determined, and uncertainty was evaluated with tornado diagrams and Monte Carlo 
simulations.
RESULTS: Thermotherapy would generate costs of US$ 501,621; the handling of 
adverse effects, US$ 29,224; and therapeutic failures, US$ 300,053. For 
Glucantime, these costs would be US$ 2,731,276, US$ 58,254, and US$ 406,298, 
respectively. With thermotherapy, the cost would be US$ 2062 per DALY averted 
and US$ 69 per patient cured; with Glucantime, the cost would be US$ 4241 per 
DALY averted and US$ 85 per patient cured. In Monte Carlo simulations, 
thermotherapy was the dominant strategy for DALYs averted in 67.9% of cases and 
highly cost-effective for patients cured in 72%.
CONCLUSION: In Colombia, thermotherapy can be included as a cost-effective 
strategy for the management of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Its incorporation into 
clinical practice guidelines could represent savings of approximately US$ 10,488 
per DALY averted and costs of US$ 116 per additional patient cured, compared to 
the use of Glucantime. These findings show the relevance of the incorporation of 
this treatment in our country and others with similar parasitological, clinical, 
and epidemiological patterns.
