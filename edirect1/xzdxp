(ASR) of incidence remained stable in the four countries, and the ASR of 
mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) have declined in four 
countries (except for the increase in U.S.), the number of CKD incidence, death, 
and DALY increased significantly. The average disease burden per case in U.S. 
has increased between 1990 and 2019, with an increasing proportion of 
death-related disease burden. For the CKD due to diabetes and hypertension, 
whose incidences accounted for < 25% of the total CKD, while it accounts for 
more than 70% of the deaths (except in U.K. with 54.14% in women and 51.75% in 
men). CKD due to diabetes and hypertension should be the focus of CKD prevention 
and control. Considering the high treatment costs of CKD and ESRD, it is urgent 
and necessary to transform CKD treatment into primary and secondary prevention.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hemorrhage (PH) in neonates is a life-threatening 
respiratory complication. We aimed to analyze the perinatal risk factors and 
morbidity with PH among very preterm infants in a large multicenter study.
METHODS: This was a multicenter case-control study based on a prospective 
cohort. Participants included 3,680 in-born infants with a gestational age at 
24-32 weeks (birth weight <1,500 g) who were admitted between January 1, 2019, 
and October 31, 2021. All infants were divided into two groups, namely, the PH 
and no-PH groups, at a ratio of 1:2 according to the following factors: 
gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), and the Score for Neonatal Acute 
Physiology with Perinatal extension II (SNAPPE II). Perinatal factors and 
outcomes were compared between the two groups by logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 3,680 infants were included in the study, and the number of 
identified cases of PH was 262 (7.1%). The incidence was 16.9% (136/806) for 
neonates with extremely low BW (BW < 1,000 g) infants. The multivariate analysis 
showed that CPAP failure (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.57, 5.08) was significantly 
associated with PH. PH was associated with a high likelihood of death (OR 3.81, 
95% CI 2.67, 5.43) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (≥grade II) (OR 1.58, 
95% CI 1.00, 2.48).
CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter case-control study based on a prospective 
cohort, PH to be common among VLBW infants. PH is associated with significant 
morbidity and mortality, and perinatal management, especially CPAP failure. 
Respiratory management strategies to decrease the risk of PH should be 
optimized.

BACKGROUND: As people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH) 
enjoy longer life expectancy with highly effective antiretroviral therapy, they 
are encountering challenging cardiovascular health risks.
AIM: To retrospectively examine the increasing burden of cardiovascular diseases 
in PLWH over the past decade.
METHODS: All hospitalizations for heart failure (HF), ischemic heart disease 
(IHD), and cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) in PLWH were identified using the 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM) and ICD-10-CM codes in the National Inpatient Sample from 2008 to 
2018. Outcomes included number of hospitalizations, in-hospital mortality, 
length of stay, and total hospital charge. Trend of the outcomes from 2008 to 
2018 were analyzed using Cochran-Armitage trend test and simple linear 
regression.
RESULTS: The number of hospitalizations for HF in PLWH increased from 4212 in 
2008 to 6700 in 2018 (P trend < 0.01). Similar increasing trend was seen with 
those for IHD and CeVD over the decade (P trend < 0.01). A decreasing trend of 
in-hospital mortality was observed in all hospitalizations of PLWH (P trend < 
0.01) and CeVD in PLWH (P trend < 0.01), but not in those for HF (P trend = 
0.67) and IHD (P trend = 0.13). The trend of length of stay was decreasing in 
all hospitalizations of PLWH (P trend < 0.01), but increasing in those for HF in 
PLWH (P trend < 0.01). An increasing trend of total hospital charge was observed 
in hospitalizations for HF, IHD, and CeVD (P trend < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The burden of cardiovascular diseases has significantly increased in 
hospitalizations of PLWH from 2008 to 2018. Continued efforts are needed to 
address the additional cardiovascular risks in this vulnerable population.

People with disabilities have a higher mortality risk than non-disabled people. 
However, mortality patterns and life expectancy according to disability types 
are under-researched. This study investigated the sociodemographic 
characteristics and compared mortality and life expectancy among people with 
disabilities according to disability type in Korea using 10-year combined data 
between 2008 and 2017. The National Health Information Database from the 
National Health Insurance Service covering the total Korean population between 
2008 and 2017 was obtained. This study described the age and income 
distributions of people with disabilities and calculated the mortality rate, 
proportional mortality ratio, and life expectancy according to disability type. 
Most disability subgroups had higher average ages than were found for 
non-disabled people. The proportion of the bottom 20% household income group was 
also higher in all types of disabilities than in non-disabled people. The crude 
mortality rate, age-standardized mortality rate, and life expectancy were all 
worse in people with all types of disabilities than in their non-disabled 
counterparts, but variations according to disability type were found. The 
composition of causes of death also varied across disability types. Although all 
types of disabilities were associated with higher mortality rates and lower life 
expectancy, the sociodemographic characteristics and mortality and life 
expectancy patterns differed across types of disability. People with 
disabilities experienced various health-related problems and financial burdens. 
Public assistance needs to be strengthened to guarantee adequate income and 
health care services for people with disabilities, considering their 
sociodemographic characteristics and mortality patterns.

Compared to their non-homeless peers, chronically homeless adults are much more 
likely to have a history of incarceration. In turn, homelessness is associated 
with increased morbidity, lack of access to adequate healthcare services, and 
decreased life expectancy. This study investigates whether age at first 
incarceration is associated with age at first homeless experience and with 
lifetime duration of literal homelessness. Study participants are homeless 
adults entering permanent supportive housing (PSH) in Los Angeles County, 
California, that have experienced incarceration prior to their first experience 
of homelessness (n=230). Multivariate linear regressions were conducted to 
determine association between age at first incarceration with: 1) age at first 
literal homelessness and 2) lifetime duration of literal homelessness. Results 
indicate that incarceration as a juvenile and young adult is significantly 
associated with earlier literal homelessness experiences and may be associated 
with longer durations of literal homelessness, for adults entering PSH. 
Moreover, women incarcerated as juveniles and entering PSH first experienced 
literal homelessness earlier than comparable men. Our findings suggest the need 
for long-term supportive services for persons incarcerated before 25 years old, 
especially for women. Moreover, these findings refine the working knowledge that 
prior incarceration increases risk for prolonged homelessness and can help 
agencies complete more accurate risk assessments.

The incidence and prevalence of Huntington's disease (HD) based on a systematic 
review and meta-analysis of 20 studies published from 1985 to 2010 was estimated 
at 0.38 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.94) and 
2.71 per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 1.55-4.72), respectively. Since 2010, there 
have been many new epidemiological studies of HD. We sought to update the global 
estimates of HD incidence and prevalence using data published up to February 
2022 and perform additional analyses based on study continent. Medline and 
Embase were searched for epidemiological studies of HD published between 2010 
and 2022. Risk of bias was assessed using a quality assessment tool. Estimated 
pooled prevalence or incidence was calculated using a random-effects 
meta-analysis. A total of 33 studies published between 2010 and 2022 were 
included. Pooled incidence was 0.48 cases per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 
0.33-0.63). Subgroup analysis by continent demonstrated a significantly higher 
incidence of HD in Europe and North America than in Asia. Pooled prevalence was 
4.88 per 100,000 (95% CI, 3.38-7.06). Subanalyses by continent demonstrated that 
the prevalence of HD was significantly higher in Europe and North America than 
in Africa. The minor increase in prevalence (more so than incidence) 
demonstrated in this updated review could relate to the enhanced availability of 
molecular testing, earlier diagnosis, increased life expectancy, and de novo 
mutations. Limitations include variable case ascertainment methods and lacking 
case validation data. © 2022 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. Movement

To evaluate the effect of fatigue and aging on the crystalline content and 
reliability of a zirconia-toughened-alumina (ZTA) composite compared to its 
individual counterpart materials (3Y-TZP and Al2O3). Thirty-six disc-shaped 
specimens per group were obtained to comply with ISO 6872:2015. Crystalline 
content, microstructure and reliability of experimental groups were evaluated in 
four stages: 1) immediate; 2) aged; 3) fatigued; 4) aged + fatigue. Aging was 
performed in autoclave and Step-Stress-Accelerated-Life-Testing (SSALT) was 
performed using three stress profiles. Weibull statistics were used to determine 
Weibull parameters and life-expectancy. A significant increase in monoclinic 
phase in 3Y-TZP was observed after aging (19.31%), fatigue (17.88%) and 
aging + fatigue (55.81%), while ZTA evidenced minimal variation among all 
conditions (<5.69%). 3Y-TZP presented higher reliability than ZTA at 300 and 
500 MPa, and ZTA outperformed Al2O3 at the same stress missions. None of the 
ceramics yielded acceptable reliability at 800 MPa. A higher characteristic 
strength was observed for 3Y-TZP, followed by ZTA and Al2O3. While after aging 
ZTA and Al2O3 remained stable, 3Y-TZP exhibited a significant increase in the 
characteristic stress. Aging did not affect the reliability of ZTA and Al2O3. 
3Y-TZP demonstrated an increase in monoclinic content and characteristic 
strength after aging.

AIMS: to investigate the effects of resveratrol on glycogen catabolism and 
gluconeogenesis in perfused livers of healthy and arthritic rats. The actions of 
resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide (R3G) and the biotransformation of resveratrol into 
R3G was further evaluated in the livers.
MAIN METHODS: arthritis was induced with Freund's adjuvant. Resveratrol at 
concentrations of 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200 μM and 200 μM R3G were introduced in 
perfused livers. Resveratrol and metabolites were measured in the outflowing 
perfusate. Respiration of isolated mitochondria and activity of gluconeogenic 
enzymes were also evaluated in the livers.
KEY FINDINGS: resveratrol inhibited glycogen catabolism when infused at 
concentrations above 50 μM and gluconeogenesis even at 10 μM in both healthy and 
arthritic rat livers, but more sensitive in these latter. Resveratrol above 
100 μM inhibited ADP-stimulated respiration and the activities of NADH- and 
succinate-oxidases in mitochondria, which were partially responsible for 
gluconeogenesis inhibition. Pyruvate carboxylase activity was inhibited by 25 μM 
resveratrol and should inhibit gluconeogenesis already at low concentrations. 
Resveratrol was significantly metabolized to R3G in healthy rat livers, however, 
R3G formation was lower in arthritic rat livers. The latter must be in part a 
consequence of a lower glucose disposal for glucuronidation. When compared to 
resveratrol, R3G inhibited gluconeogenesis in a lower extension and glycogen 
catabolism in a higher extension.
SIGNIFICANCE: the effects of resveratrol and R3G tended to be transitory and 
existed only when the resveratrol is present in the organ, however, they should 
be considered because significant serum concentrations of both are found after 
oral ingestion of resveratrol.

for patients with treatment-resistant depression in the US utilizing clinical 
trial efficacy and real-world effectiveness estimates.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
esketamine nasal spray relative to intravenous ketamine for patients with 
treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in the US.
METHODS: We used a Markov model with a 1-month cycle length, and we estimated 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs (2020 USD), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of esketamine relative to ketamine over a 
3-year time horizon, from both the healthcare sector and patient perspectives. 
We ran the model using efficacy estimates from both clinical trial and 
real-world effectiveness (RWE) data. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses (PSAs) were performed to evaluate the robustness of findings.
RESULTS: Over a 3-year time horizon, the use of esketamine yielded 1.98 QALYs 
(RWE/clinical trial efficacy), and the use of ketamine yielded 2.03 QALYs 
(clinical trial efficacy) or 1.99 QALYs (RWE). Esketamine was dominated by 
ketamine using the healthcare perspective. ICERs were above $150,000/QALY 
threshold with the patient perspective. Under the healthcare perspective, PSA 
showed there are no scenarios where esketamine was cost-effective compared to 
ketamine. With the patient's perspective, the probability that esketamine was 
cost-effective compared to ketamine was 0.0055 (clinical trial efficacy) and 
0.35 (RWE).
LIMITATIONS: The data utilized for efficacy have limitations. The time horizon 
may fail to capture longer-term costs and benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: In this decision analytic model evaluating esketamine versus 
ketamine for TRD, we found esketamine unlikely to be cost-effective under a 
healthcare sector perspective. Under a patient perspective, esketamine had 
similar effectiveness and was less costly than ketamine due to insurance 
coverage.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The EORTC Quality of Life Utility Core 10 Dimensions 
(QLU-C10D) and the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System 
Preference Score (PROPr) are new health state utility (HSU) scores for 
quality-adjusted life years in cost-effectiveness analyses. Both are expected to 
measure HSU more comprehensively than existing measures in cancer patients by 
including cancer-related health domains such as fatigue. The aim of this study 
is to compare both scores in a sample of breast cancer patients.
METHODS: We collected QLU-C10D and PROPr from 291 patients 90 days after 
treatment in the outpatient clinic of the breast cancer center at Charité - 
University Medicine Berlin between June 2018 and April 2021. We assessed both 
scores' convergent and known-groups validity, agreement, and ceiling and floor 
effects.
RESULTS: The mean QLU-C10D score [0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.74] 
and the mean PROPr score (0.43, 95% CI 0.41-0.46) differed systematically (0.28, 
95% CI 0.27-0.30) and showed fair agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient 
0.46, 95% CI 0.32-0.57). The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.83 (95% CI 
0.79-0.86). Both scores showed similar discrimination across known groups of 
age, treatment, cancer stage, marital status, and education. The QLU-C10D showed 
relevant ceiling effects.
CONCLUSION: QLU-C10D and PROPr measure HSU differently as a result of different 
utility models. The choice between QLU-C10D and PROPr should be informed by 
context, population, disease, and treatment.

The emergence of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) mutants and breakthrough infections despite available coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines calls for antiviral therapeutics. The 
application of soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a SARS-CoV-2 
decoy that reduces cell bound ACE2-mediated virus entry is limited by a short 
plasma half-life. This work presents a recombinant human albumin ACE2 genetic 
fusion (rHA-ACE2) to increase the plasma half-life by an FcRn-driven cellular 
recycling mechanism, investigated using a wild type (WT) albumin sequence and 
sequence engineered with null FcRn binding (NB). Binding of rHA-ACE2 fusions to 
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subdomain 1 (S1) was demonstrated (WT-ACE2 KD = 32.8 nM 
and NB-ACE2 KD = 31.7 nM) using Bio-Layer Interferometry and dose-dependent in 
vitro inhibition of host cell infection of pseudotyped viruses displaying 
surface SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. FcRn-mediated in vitro recycling was 
translated to a five times greater plasma half-life of WT-ACE2 (t½ β = 13.5 h) 
than soluble ACE2 (t½ β = 2.8 h) in humanised FcRn/albumin double transgenic 
mice. The rHA-ACE2-based SARS-CoV-2 decoy system exhibiting FcRn-driven 
circulatory half-life extension introduced in this work offers the potential to 
expand and improve the anti-COVID-19 anti-viral drug armoury. STATEMENT OF 
SIGNIFICANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid 
development of efficient antiviral therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2 and new 
mutants to lower morbidity and mortality in severe cases, and for people that 
are unable to receive a vaccine. Here we report a therapeutic albumin ACE2 
fusion protein (rHA-ACE2), that can bind SARS-CoV-2 S protein decorated 
virus-like particles to inhibit viral infection, and exhibits extended in vivo 
half-life compared to ACE2 alone. Employing ACE2 as a binding decoy for the 
virus is expected to efficiently inhibit all SARS-CoV-2 mutants as they all rely 
on binding with endogenous ACE2 for viral cell entry and, therefore, rHA-ACE2 
constitutes a versatile addition to the therapeutic arsenal for combatting 
COVID-19.

Cancer is the second-leading disease-related cause of global mortality after 
cardiovascular disease. Despite significant advances in cancer therapeutic 
strategies, cancer remains one of the major obstacles to human life extension. 
Cancer pathogenesis is extremely complicated and not fully understood. 
Epithelial splicing regulatory proteins (ESRPs), including ESRP1 and ESRP2, 
belong to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family of RNA-binding 
proteins and are crucial regulators of the alternative splicing of messenger 
RNAs (mRNAs). The expression and activity of ESRPs are modulated by various 
mechanisms, including post-translational modifications and non-coding RNAs. 
Although a growing body of evidence suggests that ESRP dysregulation is closely 
associated with cancer progression, the detailed mechanisms remain inconclusive. 
In this review, we summarize recent findings on the structures, functions, and 
regulatory mechanisms of ESRPs and focus on their underlying mechanisms in 
cancer progression. We also highlight the clinical implications of ESRPs as 
prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer treatment. The 
information reviewed herein could be extremely beneficial to the development of 
individualized therapeutic strategies for cancer patients.

AIM: This survey derived from the collaboration between the Palliative Care and 
Reirradiation Study Groups of the Italian Association of Radiotherapy and 
Clinical Oncology (AIRO). Its aim was to obtain a real "snapshot" on the 
treatments of spinal metastases, focusing on reirradiation, among radiation 
oncologists in Italy.
METHODS: The survey was elaborated on SurveyMonkey's online interface and was 
sent via e-mail to all Radiation Oncologists of AIRO that were invited to 
anonymously fill in the electronic form within 60 days. The questionnaire was 
prepared by the AIRO "Palliative care" and "Reirradiation" Study Groups and it 
consisted of 36 questions, 19 single-choice questions, 10 multiple-choice 
questions and 6 open questions. The data were analyzed and represented with 
tables and graphs.
RESULTS: The survey shows that palliative radiotherapy remains a field of 
interest for most ROs in the Italian centers. 3D Conventional Radiation Therapy 
(3DCRT) alone or in combination with other techniques is the primary choice for 
patients with a life expectancy of less than 6 months. For patients with a life 
expectancy of more than six months, there is an increased use of new 
technologies, such as Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT). Factors 
considered for retreatment are time between first and second treatment, dose 
delivered to spine metastasis and spinal cord in the first treatment, vertebral 
stability, symptoms, and/or performance status. The most feared complication are 
myelopathy followed by vertebral fracture and local recurrence. This explain an 
increasing focus on patient selection and the use of high technology in the 
treatment of metastatic patients.
CONCLUSION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and image-guided radiotherapy 
allow the administration of ablative RT doses while sparing the constraints of 
healthy tissue in spinal metastases. However, there is still an unclear and 
heterogeneous reality in the reirradiation of spinal metastases. A national 
registry with the aim of clarifying the most controversial aspects of vertebral 
metastasis retreatments will enable better management of these patients and 
design more targeted study designs.

Objective: To depict gastric cancer burden trends globally and analyze 
geographical and socioeconomic disparities among different countries and 
territories. Methods: We extracted the data from Global Burden of Disease 2019 
Database. We conducted the Joinpoint regression and calculated the average 
annual percent change (AAPC) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for 
age-standardized gastric cancer incidence and mortality from 1990 to 2019. 
Linear regression was performed to measure the association of sociodemographic 
index (SDI) with each country's gastric cancer incidence and mortality AAPC. We 
applied the age-period-cohort analysis to assess the cohort effect on gastric 
cancer incidence and mortality. Results: The AAPCs for gastric cancer 
age-standardized incidence and mortality rates from 1990 to 2019 were -1.27% 
(95% CI: -1.43%, -1.11%) and -1.87% (95% CI: -2.01%, -1.72%), respectively. SDI 
levels were negatively associated with AAPCs, which means that countries with 
higher SDI had higher AAPC (P<0.001). The decrease of gastric cancer burden in 
countries with low or medium SDI levels was slower than that globally. The 
age-period-cohort analysis indicated that countries with higher SDI levels had 
more apparent decline in birth cohort effects from 1900 to 1999. Conclusions: 
Countries with different socioeconomic levels have various decreasing rates for 
gastric cancer incidence and deaths. Countries with higher SDI levels have 
higher declining rates for gastric cancer burden.

Publisher: 目的： 分析全球胃癌发病率和死亡率变化趋势，探讨不同地理区域和社会经济发展水平国家和地区的疾病负担差异。 方法： 
基于2019年全球疾病负担研究数据库，采用Joinpoint回归模型计算1990—2019年胃癌年龄标化发病率和死亡率的平均年度变化百分比(AAPC)及95% 
CI，采用线性回归分析胃癌标化发病率和死亡率的AAPC与社会人口指数(SDI)的关联，采用年龄－时期－队列模型探讨不同SDI水平的地区1900—1999年出生队列胃癌发病和死亡风险的变化趋势。 
结果： 1990—2019年全球胃癌标化发病率和死亡率的AAPC分别为－1.27%(95% CI：－1.43%~－1.11%)和－1.87%(95% 
CI：－2.01%~－1.72%)。SDI与胃癌发病和死亡率AAPC均呈负相关(均P<0.001)，SDI较高的国家胃癌发病和死亡率下降较快，中低SDI国家胃癌疾病负担下降速度落后于全球平均水平。年龄－时期－队列模型显示，SDI较高的国家1900—1999年出生队列人群的胃癌发病和死亡风险下降幅度也要更大。 
结论： 不同社会经济发展水平国家的胃癌发病率和死亡率下降速度有明显差异，社会经济发展水平较高的国家胃癌疾病负担下降较快。.

Understanding the burden of mesothelioma with the contribution of occupational 
asbestos exposure globally provides essential foundations for cancer control, 
policy decisions and resource allocation. Globally, 34,511 incident cases, 
29,251 deaths and 668,104 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of mesothelioma 
were estimated in 2019. The age-standardized rates of incidence, mortality and 
DALYs all showed a slightly declining trend over the past 30 years, but the 
latest absolute number of mesothelioma burden almost doubled since 1990. The 
burden rate decreased among the population aged under 70 years, but increased 
among the population aged over 80 years, especially in the High 
socio-demographic index (SDI) region. The burden rate of mesothelioma 
attributable to asbestos exposure was positively associated with SDI at the 
national level. This study depicted a continuous increase in mesothelioma burden 
globally over the past 30 years. Controlling occupational asbestos exposure will 
reduce the mesothelioma burden, especially for higher SDI regions.

Application of essential oils to mitigate aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) contamination in 
food is a current research hotspot; however, their direct incorporation may 
cause toxic effects, and changes in food organoleptic properties. This work 
aimed to synthesize novel synergistic formulation of Pinus roxburghii, Juniperus 
communis, and Cupressus sempervirens essential oils by mixture design assay 
(PJC) and encapsulation of PJC formulation into chitosan nanocomposite (Nm-PJC) 
with an aim to protect stored rice (Oryza sativa L., prime staple food) against 
fungi and AFB1 mediated loss of valuable minerals, macronutrients, and fatty 
acids. Nm-PJC was characterized through DLS, SEM, FTIR, and XRD analyses, along 
with controlled delivery from chitosan nanobiopolymer. Encapsulation of 
synergistic formulation into chitosan-nanomatrix improved antifungal 
(4.0 μL/mL), antiaflatoxigenic (3.5 μL/mL), and antioxidant activities 
(P < 0.05). Impairment in ergosterol and methylglyoxal biosynthesis along with 
in-silico-homology-modeling of major components with Ver-1 and Omt-A proteins 
advocated chemico-molecular interaction responsible for fungal growth inhibition 
and AFB1 secretion. In addition, in-situ efficacy against lipid-peroxidation, 
fatty acid biodeterioration, and preservation of minerals, macronutrients 
without affecting organoleptic attributes in rice and high mammalian safety 
profile (9874.23 μL/kg) suggested practical application of synergistic 
nanoformulation as innovative smart, and green candidate to mitigate AFB1 
contamination, and shelf-life extension of stored food products.

INTRODUCTION: Haemophilia is a rare congenital bleeding disorder, and the most 
common manifestation is spontaneous bleeding in muscles and joints. Despite the 
benefits linked to recent and dramatic pharmacological advances at least in high 
income setting, many patients still develop musculoskeletal dysfunctions during 
their lifetime, which must be managed by physiotherapists in the frame of a 
multidisciplinary team. The aim of the scoping review is to map the available 
evidence by providing an overview on the past and present physiotherapy scenario 
in persons with haemophilia (PWH).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The review was conducted according to the guidelines of 
the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. Scientific articles on physiotherapy 
and sport interventions for PWH published from 1960 up to September 2021 have 
been included. Search was conducted on the e-databases PubMed and PEDro without 
restrictions for the study design.
RESULTS: Sixty eight articles were included, 52 related to rehabilitation and 
preventive physiotherapy, 16 to sport. The results have been reported in 
chronological order and divided into two categories: (1) rehabilitation and 
preventive physiotherapy; (2) sport activities.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first scoping review on physiotherapy in haemophilia, 
based on the existing evidence on this topic which allowed us to underline how 
the role of the physiotherapist changed over time. Historically this specialist 
did intervene only after an acute bleed or surgical operation, but now he has a 
pivotal role in the multidisciplinary team that acts to improve from birth the 
quality of life of the PWH. His activity is also closely intertwined with sport 
promotion and supervision.

OBJECTIVES: Endovascular therapy (EVT) has proven to be clinically effective in 
treating large vessel occlusion acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), either alone or in 
combination with intravenous alteplase. Despite this, there is a limited 
evidence on the cost-effectiveness of EVT in Thailand and other low-income and 
middle-income countries. This study aims to assess whether EVT is a 
cost-effective therapy for AIS, and to estimate the fiscal burden to the Thai 
government through budget impact analysis.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed to compare AIS therapy with and 
without EVT from a societal perspective. The primary outcome was incremental 
cost-effectiveness per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Clinical 
parameters were derived from both national and international literature, while 
cost and utility data were collected locally. The analysis applied a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of 160 000 Baht (~$5000) per QALY, as set by the 
Thai government.
RESULTS: Both EVT alone and EVT combined with intravenous alteplase, among 
patients who are ineligible and eligible for intravenous alteplase, 
respectively, improved health outcomes but incurred additional cost. The 
combination of EVT and intravenous alteplase was associated with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 146 800 THB per QALY gained compared with 
intravenous alteplase alone, and the ICER of EVT alone compared with supportive 
care among patients ineligible for intravenous alteplase was estimated at 115 
000 THB per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that the price of EVT has 
the greatest impact on model outcomes. Over a time horizon of 5 years, the 
introduction of EVT into the Thai health benefit package would require an 
additional budget of 887 million THB, assuming 2000 new cases per year.
CONCLUSIONS: EVT represents good value for money in the Thai context, both when 
provided to patients eligible for intravenous alteplase, and when provided alone 
to those who are ineligible for intravenous alteplase.
