epidemiology of AA and its associated diseases.
RESULTS: Alopecia areata was responsible for 0.024% of the total DALYs. 
Age-standardized DALYs rate of AA was 7.51 [4.73-11.14] per 100,000. Overall 
ASPR, ASIR and age-standardized YLDs rates were stable from 1990 to 2019 
globally. All three rates were about two times higher in females compared to 
males and had a bimodal distribution with peaks at age 30-34 years and 
60-64 years. AA burden was positively correlated with SDI (r = .375, p < .001) 
and was most prevalent in high-income countries, especially North America. 
Countries with a high AA incidence were more likely to have high incidences of 
autoimmune diseases and low incidences of ischaemic heart disease and ischaemic 
stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of AA was prominent in females, young adults, high 
sociodemographic countries and North Americans. The study corroborates sex- and 
region-specific implications and public health measures for AA and its 
associated burdens. These epidemiological data on AA burden can guide future 
research efforts, prevention strategies and allocation of resources.

State-level disparities in life expectancy are wide, persistent, and potentially 
growing in the United States. However, the extent to which differences in 
lifespan variability by state have changed over time is unclear. This research 
note describes trends in lifespan variability for the United States overall and 
by state from 1960 to 2019 using period life table data from the United States 
Mortality Database. Lifespan disparity at birth (e0†) decreased over time in the 
United States overall from 14.0 years in 1960-1964 to 12.2 in 2015-2019. 
Lifespan variability decreased in all states, but states differed in the level 
and pace with which these changes occurred. Southern states and the District of 
Columbia exhibited consistently higher (i.e., less equitable) levels of lifespan 
variability than the nation overall. Conversely, lifespan variability was lower 
among several states in the Northeast (e.g., Connecticut and Massachusetts), 
Upper Midwest (e.g., Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), and West (e.g., 
California, Oregon, Utah, and Washington). We observe a particularly worrisome 
trend of increasing lifespan variability for the United States overall and for 
most states from 2010-2014 to 2015-2019. Monitoring state-level trends in 
lifespan variability has the potential to inform policies designed to ameliorate 
population health disparities.

Life expectancy (LE) is an objective and highly reliable marker for events 
affecting demography. Analysing LE changes during the Covid pandemic shows 
widely different situations in a sample of 29 countries, highlighting 
comparatively efficient management in most Western European countries, in 
contrast to catastrophic results in Eastern Europe and in the United States. 
Loss of LE is also inversely correlated with vaccination uptake, confirming the 
efficacy of vaccines at the population level.

Increased life expectancy in cystic fibrosis has made transition from pediatric 
to adult cystic fibrosis centers a crucial step for patients, their families and 
caregivers. This transition must be gradual and carefully prepared. A formalized 
process, early discussion with patients and families about transition, patient's 
empowerment prior to transfer, and close links between pediatric and adult teams 
are key points to succeed. Therapeutic education, validated questionnaires, 
personalized action plans or connected tools can help. Transfer will take place 
at the appropriate time for each patient, ideally during a period of disease 
stability, in a progressive manner, with joint or alternating consultations 
between pediatric and adult cystic fibrosis center teams. Other chronic 
respiratory diseases with pediatric onset may benefit from similar transition 
processes.

Publisher: TITLE: Transition des patients atteints d’une maladie respiratoire 
chronique depuis la pédiatrie vers les services pour adultes - L’exemple de 
la mucoviscidose.
ABSTRACT: Du fait de l’augmentation de l’espérance de vie des individus atteints 
de mucoviscidose, la transition de la pédiatrie vers les services de médecine 
pour adultes est devenue une étape essentielle pour les patients, les aidants et 
les soignants. Cette transition doit être progressive et longuement préparée. 
Avoir un processus établi et formalisé, aborder tôt le thème de la transition 
avec le patient et sa famille, autonomiser le patient avant le transfert et 
établir des liens étroits entre les structures médicales pédiatriques et pour 
adultes sont des éléments importants pour la réussite de cette étape. 
L’éducation thérapeutique ainsi que l’utilisation de questionnaires validés, 
d’un plan d’action personnalisé ou d’outils connectés peuvent aider. Le 
transfert se fera au moment le mieux adapté pour le patient, idéalement en 
période de stabilité de la maladie, de manière progressive, avec des 
consultations conjointes ou alternées entre les équipes de pédiatrie et de 
médecine pour adultes. D’autres maladies respiratoires chroniques débutant dans 
l’enfance ou à l’adolescence pourront bénéficier d’un processus de transition 
similaire.

Ongoing demographic changes and global population ageing require organisations 
to pay special attention to their employment policies. With working life 
extension and age management increasingly included in discussions about reactive 
versus proactive personnel policies, the term 'generativity' gains special 
importance as an approach to managing a generationally diverse workforce. 
Generativity can be understood as an attitude of openness towards the younger 
generations that focuses on exchanging values, knowledge, and experiences with 
them. It is a source of positive emotions and better social relationships, 
personal fulfilment, good energy, and aliveness. In the paper, generativity is 
discussed in the framework of two theories: the socio-emotional selectivity 
theory (SST) and successful ageing theory (SOC). The aim of this paper is to 
assess the relationship between generativity and individual work outcomes. We 
considered both in-role and extra-role outcomes analysed in the job context. 
Meta-analysis is conducted of studies that investigate generativity and its 
relationships with motivational outcomes (job satisfaction, engagement, work 
motivation, affective commitment, self-efficacy), cognitive outcomes (attitudes 
toward retirement, career success, self-control), personal outcomes (wellbeing, 
health, job strain), relational outcomes and extra-role behaviours 
(organisational citizenship behaviour and sustainable behaviour). The analysis 
examines 65 independent samples that included 30,540 individuals, and considers 
the role of three moderators-the cultural context, the measurement method and 
age. It demonstrates that generativity has significant and positive 
motivational, cognitive and extra-role behaviour outcomes for workers and that 
it improves their well-being.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization declared a pandemic of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2), on March 11, 2020. The standardized approach of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) allows for quantifying the combined 
impact of morbidity and mortality of diseases and injuries. The main objective 
of this study was to estimate the direct impact of COVID-19 in France in 2020, 
using DALYs to combine the population health impact of infection fatalities, 
acute symptomatic infections and their post-acute consequences, in 28 days 
(baseline) up to 140 days, following the initial infection.
METHODS: National mortality, COVID-19 screening, and hospital admission data 
were used to calculate DALYs based on the European Burden of Disease Network 
consensus disease model. Scenario analyses were performed by varying the number 
of symptomatic cases and duration of symptoms up to a maximum of 140 days, 
defining COVID-19 deaths using the underlying, and associated, cause of death.
RESULTS: In 2020, the estimated DALYs due to COVID-19 in France were 990 710 
(1472 per 100 000), with 99% of burden due to mortality (982 531 years of life 
lost, YLL) and 1% due to morbidity (8179 years lived with disability, YLD), 
following the initial infection. The contribution of YLD reached 375%, assuming 
the duration of 140 days of post-acute consequences of COVID-19. Post-acute 
consequences contributed to 49% of the total morbidity burden. The contribution 
of YLD due to acute symptomatic infections among people younger than 70 years 
was higher (67%) than among people aged 70 years and above (33%). YLL among 
people aged 70 years and above, contributed to 74% of the total YLL.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a substantial impact on population health in France in 
2020. The majority of population health loss was due to mortality. Men had 
higher population health loss due to COVID-19 than women. Post-acute 
consequences of COVID-19 had a large contribution to the YLD component of the 
disease burden, even when we assume the shortest duration of 28 days, long COVID 
burden is large. Further research is recommended to assess the impact of health 
inequalities associated with these estimates.

AIM AND BACKGROUND: Smoking is a modifiable risk factor for cancers. The aim of 
the study is to estimate the trend of mortality and DALYs of smoking-attributed 
cancers in the North Africa and Middle East (NAME) countries.
METHODS: In this study, estimates from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 
(GBD-2019) study were used to report the mortality and DALYs for 16 
smoking-attributed cancers. The mortality and DALYs rates from 
smoking-attributed cancers were evaluated by age, sex, and the 21 countries of 
the NAME countries from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: Age standardized mortality rates (ASMR) for the 29 smoking-attributed 
cancers in the NAME countries in 1990 and 2019 were estimated to be 24.7 (95% 
Uncertainty Interval: 21.5, 27.8) and 22.4 (95%UI: 19.8, 25.4) respectively, 
which shows a 9.2% decrease in the three decades. DALYs/100,000 for 
smoking-attributed cancers was, also, estimated to be 600.3 (95%UI: 521.6, 
682.6) and 515.6 (95%UI: 454.9, 585.4) respectively, which indicates a 14.1% 
decreased in these three decades. In the last three decades, the percentage 
changes in DALYs/100,000 for smoking-attributed cancers in males and females 
were - 0.16 and - 0.03, respectively. Plus, The percentage changes in ASMR in 
males and females were - 12% and 8%, respectively. Furthermore, The highest ASMR 
and DALYs were observed in Lebanon, Turkey, and Palestine in 2019.
CONCLUSION: The mortality rates of cancers from smoking have increased 
substantially among females, in most countries of the NAME region, in recent 
years. The burden caused by smoking can be reduced through modifying lifestyle 
and applying strict laws on smoking by governments and policymakers.

BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend shared decision making (SDM) for mammography 
screening for women ≥ 75 and not screening women with < 10-year life expectancy. 
High-quality SDM requires consideration of women's breast cancer (BC) risk, life 
expectancy, and values but is hard to implement because no models simultaneously 
estimate older women's individualized BC risk and life expectancy.
METHODS: Using competing risk regression and data from 83,330 women > 55 years 
who completed the 2004 Nurses' Health Study (NHS) questionnaire, we developed 
(in 2/3 of the cohort, n = 55,533) a model to predict 10-year non-breast cancer 
(BC) death. We considered 60 mortality risk factors and used best-subsets 
regression, the Akaike information criterion, and c-index, to identify the 
best-fitting model. We examined model performance in the remaining 1/3 of the 
NHS cohort (n = 27,777) and among 17,380 Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) 
participants, ≥ 55 years, who completed the 2009 questionnaire. We then included 
the identified mortality predictors in a previously developed competing risk BC 
prediction model and examined model performance for predicting BC risk.
RESULTS: Mean age of NHS development cohort participants was 70.1 years (± 7.0); 
over 10 years, 3.1% developed BC, 0.3% died of BC, and 20.1% died of other 
causes; NHS validation cohort participants were similar. BWHS participants were 
younger (mean age 63.7 years [± 6.7]); over 10-years 3.1% developed BC, 0.4% 
died of BC, and 11.1% died of other causes. The final non-BC death prediction 
model included 21 variables (age; body mass index [BMI]; physical function [3 
measures]; comorbidities [12]; alcohol; smoking; age at menopause; and 
mammography use). The final BC prediction model included age, BMI, alcohol and 
hormone use, family history, age at menopause, age at first birth/parity, and 
breast biopsy history. When risk factor regression coefficients were applied in 
the validation cohorts, the c-index for predicting 10-year non-BC death was 
0.790 (0.784-0.796) in NHS and 0.768 (0.757-0.780) in BWHS; for predicting 
5-year BC risk, the c-index was 0.612 (0.538-0.641) in NHS and 0.573 
(0.536-0.611) in BWHS.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a novel competing-risk model that 
predicts 10-year non-BC death and 5-year BC risk. Model risk estimates may help 
inform SDM around mammography screening.

BACKGROUND: Injury deaths constitute a major avoidable cause of death affecting 
life expectancy to a different degree in men and women. This study quantified 
the contributions of injury deaths to the gender gap in life expectancy (GGLE) 
and life disparity (GGLD) in nine Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries.
METHODS: We retrieved annual data on age-sex specific causes of death from the 
World Health Organization mortality database for EMR countries with at least 
2-year consecutive data during 2010-2019. The injury-related deaths were 
categorized into five groups: transport accidents, other accidental injuries, 
intentional self-harm, assault and events of undetermined intent. Considering 
women as the reference, the GGLE and GGLD were decomposed by age and causes of 
death, using a continuous-change model.
RESULTS: The largest and smallest GGLE were observed in Kuwait (5.2 years) and 
Qatar (- 1.2 years), respectively. Qatar (- 2.2 years) and Oman (0.2 years) had 
the highest and lowest GGLD. The highest contributions of injury deaths to the 
GGLE/GGLD were seen in Libya (1.8/- 1.2 years), followed by Iran 
(1.2/- 0.8 years). Among injury causes, transport accidents were the leading 
cause of GGLE in all countries but Libya and Morocco, with Iran having the 
greatest contributions (0.6 years). Injury deaths in men aged 15-29 years 
accounted for 33% [41%] (Kuwait) to 55% [65%] (Oman) of total GGLE [GGLD] 
attributable to injury deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: High injury deaths, particularly transport accidents, among young 
men contributed substantially to the GGLE and GGLD across nine EMR countries in 
this study. This highlights the need for implementing preventing policies to 
reduce the burden of injury deaths specifically in young men.

Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.

BACKGROUND: Primary cardiac tumours are rare, and diagnosis may be difficult, as 
symptoms and cardiac imaging may mimic other cardiac diseases. The intimal 
sarcoma is the least commonly reported cardiac tumour with only few cases 
reported worldwide. In this case report, we present a case of an intimal sarcoma 
with a highly aggressive disease course.
CASE SUMMARY: A 60-year-old male with a history of prior aortoplasty due to 
congenital aortic stenosis, mechanical aortic valve replacement, and aortic 
stenting due to aortic dilatation presented with night sweats, malaise, and 
dyspnoea. Initial imaging (including transthoracic and transoesophageal 
echocardiography and emergency computed tomography) revealed masses suspected to 
be thrombi in the left atrium and ventricle. However, a positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography scan revealed that the masses were suspicious for 
malignancy. The patient underwent non-radical tumour resection and insertion of 
biological valve prostheses. Subsequent tissue analysis and pathology assessment 
revealed an intimal sarcoma. There were no curative treatment options, and the 
patient succumbed to his illness <3 months after surgery.
DISCUSSION: This case report presents a case of a highly aggressive intimal 
sarcoma. As complete tumour resection is of great importance when it comes to 
life expectancy in cardiac sarcomas, early diagnosis using non-invasive and 
invasive imaging modalities is essential to start early treatment and to improve 
outcomes in this patient group.

PROSPERO ID: CRD42022303890.
DATA SOURCES: The CINAHL, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Scopus, SocINDEX and Web of Science 
databases were searched in December 2021.
REVIEW METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist was followed. Two researchers independently 
applied eligibility criteria, selected studies and conducted quality appraisals. 
Data-based convergent synthesis and thematic analysis were used.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included, most of which were survey-based. Eleven 
studies were quantitative, six were qualitative and one used mixed methods. Our 
results reveal that willingness to continue in work increased with age. Six 
factors promoted working until and beyond the official retirement age among 
nurses: good health and work ability, the significance of work sufficient 
income, meaningful relationships and support in the working community, 
individually tailored work arrangements, and organizational support and 
recognition.
CONCLUSION: To sustain experienced nurses in working life and promote their 
working beyond retirement age organizations urgently need to apply throughout 
working lives supporting age management schemes. Interventions should target 
supportive relations and individual and flexible arrangements at the workplace. 
Scarce studies investigated factors contributing to an extension of working life 
among nurses. Most published evidence on this topic is based primarily on 
nurses' subjective opinions and preferences: no intervention studies or 
objective evaluations of factors affecting retirement were found.
IMPACT: The available evidence suggests the most critical factors for extending 
nurses' working lives are support and individual and flexible arrangements in 
the workplace. There is a need to test interventions and evaluate the 
effectiveness of measures encouraging nurses to extend their working lives.

Modern root-form endosseous dental implants have been used to successfully 
replace missing teeth for more than four decades. The implant industry has grown 
substantially during this time, with many hundreds of dental implant 
manufacturers providing components for clinicians around the globe. Increased 
acceptance of dental implants has greatly amplified the number of dental 
implants placed worldwide. As the dental implant patient population continues to 
age, long-term follow-up after implant placement has become increasingly 
important due to various factors associated with the condition and maintenance 
of implants placed. Although dental implants exhibit a high success rate as a 
medical device, their life expectancy may be limited depending on the patient's 
changing health, use of medications, lifestyle changes, nutrition, occlusal/bite 
issues, loss of additional teeth, experiences of trauma, lack of sufficient 
keratinized soft tissue, loss of bony support, and oral hygiene habits. When 
loss of soft-tissue coverage and/or bone occurs, the resultant inflammation 
surrounding the implant is known as peri-implantitis.

BACKGROUND/AIM: The ever-increasing population and life expectancy worldwide 
increase the prevalence of ophthalmic diseases, and the need for ophthalmic 
research expands accordingly. In our study, we aimed to evaluate many aspects of 
the barriers, especially gender disparities, confronting ophthalmologists who 
aspire to conduct scientific research (SR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this descriptive quantitative study, we distributed an 
online questionnaire to ophthalmologists in Turkey with 21 questions presented 
on a five-point Likert scale and two open-ended questions. The survey was 
prepared with Google forms. Participants were recruited via e-mail and social 
networks. A multicenter survey was conducted between January 29 and February 20, 
2021, and a total of 210 valid responses were recorded.
RESULTS: Participants' responses were grouped into four types of barriers: 
motivation, time constraints, research support, and competence. Participants' 
motivation to conduct research was above average (3.54±0.96), but most stated 
that they have time constraints (3.74±0.97). Participants did not agree that 
there is adequate support for research (2.35±0.76), and they self assessed their 
level of the required competence to be average (2.87±1.08). Women were more 
motivated to do SR than men (p = 0.008), but there were no statistically 
significant differences between women and men in terms of time constraints, 
research support, and level of competence (p = 0.853, p = 0.482, and p = 0.558, 
respectively). Although there is no statistically significant difference between 
men and women regarding time constraints, female physicians mentioned more about 
the barriers arising from their personal responsibilities (p = 0.038).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that ophthalmologists are enthusiastic about 
doing SR but encounter obstacles with regard to time availability and research 
support. In addition, there is a need to reinforce competence in SR. Although 
female physicians are more motivated than men, they must deal with competing 
domestic responsibilities.

Previous studies have shown a relationship between fine particulate matter 
(PM2.5) exposure and an increased risk of neonatal disorders. Considering the 
huge burden of neonatal disorders, we assessed spatiotemporal trends of neonatal 
disorders burden caused by ambient and household PM2.5 at the global, regional, 
and national levels from 1990 to 2019. The number, rate, and population 
attributable fraction (PAF) of ambient and household PM2.5-related neonatal 
disorders disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 204 countries and 
territories from 1990 to 2019 were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2019 to measure the related neonatal disorders burden by age, sex, 
subtype, and region. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was estimated to 
quantify temporal trends. In 2019, approximately a fifth of the global neonatal 
disorders burden was attributable to PM2.5 exposure, with 7.54% for ambient 
PM2.5 and 13.23% for household PM2.5. Although the global neonatal disorders 
burden attributable to household PM2.5 has decreased substantially in the past 
30 years, that attributable to ambient PM2.5 has increased, especially in lower 
sociodemographic index (SDI) regions. The highest rate and PAF of ambient 
PM2.5-related neonatal disorders DALYs in 2019 were in South Asia and East Asia, 
respectively, and the fastest increases were in Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa (for 
rate: EAPC = 2.55, 95% CI: 2.37-2.73) and South Asia (for PAF: EAPC = 3.88, 95% 
CI: 3.68-4.08). In addition, we found an inverted V-shaped between rates and 
PAFs of ambient PM2.5-related neonatal disorders DALYs in 2019, as well as 
corresponding EAPCs, and SDI, while rates and PAFs of household PM2.5-related 
neonatal disorders DALYs in 2019 were highly negatively correlated with SDI. In 
the past three decades, the global ambient PM2.5-related neonatal disorders 
burden largely increased, especially in lower SDI regions. Comparatively, the 
household PM2.5-related neonatal disorders burden decreased but still accounted 
for about two-thirds of the PM2.5-related neonatal disease burden.

Glucocorticoids - commonly known as stress hormones - belong to the family of 
steroid hormones and regulate numerous life essential physiological processes. 
As lipophilic molecules, glucocorticoids are known to cross the placental 
barrier in mammals, which - applied for therapeutic reasons or arising from 
environmental influences - illustrates the role of prenatal stress during 
embryonic developmental processes. The hormones employ their functions by 
binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and thus are involved in regulating 
the transcription of thousands of genes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
investigate the spatiotemporal expression pattern of the GR during early 
embryonic vertebrate development, using the chicken embryo as a model organism. 
The results should contribute to enhance and expand the current understanding of 
glucocorticoid signaling. By performing in-situ hybridization on whole mount 
chicken embryos from stage HH10 to HH29 and analyzing vibratome sections of 
hybridized embryos, we described the spatiotemporal expression pattern of the GR 
during early embryogenesis. Moreover, we compared the expression pattern of the 
GR with other developmental markers such as Pax7, Desmin, MyoD and HNK-1 using 
double in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. We were able to determine 
the first emergence of GR expression in stage HH13 of chicken development in the 
cranial area, especially in the muscle anlagen of the branchial arches and of 
non-somitic neck muscles. Furthermore, we monitored the extension of GR 
expression pattern throughout later stages and found transcripts of GR during 
somitogenesis, limb development, myogenesis, neurulation and neural 
differentiation and moreover during organogenesis of the gastrointestinal 
organs, the heart, the kidneys and the lungs. Toward later stages, GR expression 
transitioned from more distinct areas of expression to an increasingly 
ubiquitous expression pattern. Our results support the notion of an enormous 
relevance of glucocorticoid signaling during vertebrate embryonic development 
and contribute to a better understanding of the consequences of prenatal stress 
and the clinical administration of prenatal glucocorticoids.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic disease is a leading cause of death and disability that 
disproportionately burdens culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) 
communities. Self-management is a cornerstone of effective chronic disease 
management. However, research suggests that patients from CALD communities may 
be less likely to engage with self-management approaches. The Natural Helper 
Programme aims to facilitate patient engagement with self-management approaches 
(ie, 'activation') by embedding cultural mentors with lived experience of 
chronic disease into chronic disease clinics/programmes. The Natural Helper 
Trial will explore the effect of cultural mentors on patient activation, health 
self-efficacy, coping efforts and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) while 
also evaluating the implementation strategy.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A hybrid type-1 effectiveness-implementation 
cluster-randomised controlled trial (phase one) and a mixed-method controlled 
before-and-after cohort extension of the trial (phase 2). Hospital clinics in 
highly multicultural regions in Australia that provide healthcare for patients 
with chronic and/or complex conditions, will participate. A minimum of 16 
chronic disease clinics (clusters) will be randomised to immediate (active arm) 
or delayed implementation (control arm). In phase 1, the active arm will receive 
a multifaceted strategy supporting them to embed cultural mentors in their 
services while the control arm continues with usual care. Each cluster will 
recruit an average of 15 patients, assessed at baseline and 6 months (n=240). In 
phase 2, clusters in the control arm will receive the implementation strategy 
and evaluate the intervention on an additional 15 patients per cluster, while 
sustainability in active arm clusters will be assessed qualitatively. Change in 
activation over 6 months, measured using the Patient Activation Measure will be 
the primary effectiveness outcome, while secondary effectiveness outcomes will 
explore changes in chronic disease self-efficacy, coping strategies and HRQoL. 
Secondary implementation outcomes will be collected from patient-participants, 
mentors and healthcare providers using validated questionnaires, customised 
surveys and interviews aligning with the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, 
Implementation, Maintenance framework to evaluate acceptability, reach, dose 
delivered, sustainability, cost-utility and healthcare provider determinants.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has full ethical approval (2021/ETH12279). 
The results from this hybrid trial will be presented at scientific meetings and 
published in peer-reviewed journals.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Intramedullary spinal cord metastases (ISCM) are deemed 
extremely aggressive, as confirmed by the low life expectancy since the 
diagnosis. Up to 26.5% of total ISCM stem from breast cancer (BC), representing 
the second most frequent primary site after the lung. The increasing incidence 
of BC and the widespread use of MRI for the diagnosis could therefore lead to an 
earlier diagnosis and, therefore, to a progressively longer survival in patients 
affected by ISCM from BC. This systematic review is intended to provide an 
orientation through a management algorithm for the most appropriate therapeutic 
approach in these patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research strategy initially relied on title and 
abstract analysis. The article's full text was retrieved for further 
investigation if the title and abstract met the inclusion criteria. The 
extracted data included the following: authors, publication time, study design, 
patient characteristics, ISCM location, treatment modalities, time interval from 
initial cancer diagnosis to ISCM diagnosis, clinical outcomes, and survival 
time.
RESULTS: This systematic search regarding ISCM from BC yielded 574 articles. 
After screening, a total of 44 studies were included in this systematic review. 
A total of 123 patients were evaluated. The mean patient age was 53.2 years with 
a standard deviation of 10.4 years. Female patients were 122. There was only one 
male patient.
CONCLUSION: ISCM from BC have a better prognosis than lung metastases and, 
thanks to recent advances in diagnostic imaging and intraoperative planning and 
neuromonitoring, an early diagnosis and a prompt multidisciplinary treatment may 
be accomplished. Prospective studies to generate evidence-based data regarding 
the most appropriate treatment for ISCM are mandatory.

Although maxillofacial trauma is relatively common, it still presents a 
challenging management. Its management includes treatment of facial bone 
fractures, dentoalveolar trauma and soft tissue injuries as well as associated 
injuries. Plastic surgeons, maxillofacial surgeons and prosthodontists have an 
interest in the subject of maxillofacial injuries, particularly in the area of 
functional as well as aesthetical stomatognathic rehabilitation. Present case 
was a clinical scenario with maxillofacial trauma due to entanglement in 
agricultural equipment leading to fracture of palatal bone and fracture of 
mandible in symphysis region. The patient's mastication, phonetics, aesthetics 
and social life were affected. Initial management was performed by the plastic 
surgeons. Rehabilitation of maxillary defect was performed using fixed removable 
bridge with palatal extension to cover the cleft part, and cortical 
implant-supported fixed prosthesis was planned as the prosthetic treatment for 
mandibular arch. On follow-up, there was improvement in speech and mastication, 
and patient felt more confident in social interaction after prosthetic 
rehabilitation.
