lifetime cost (£18 197 vs. £16 829) per person, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of £2093 per QALY. The probability of empagliflozin 
being cost-effective in the HF subpopulation at a £20 000 per QALY 
willingness-to-pay threshold was 91%.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that adding empagliflozin to SoC in HF 
patients with T2D constitutes a cost-effective use of UK healthcare resources 
and may provide long-term health benefits to patients.

Cost-utility analyses are slowly becoming part of randomized control trials 
evaluating physical and mental health treatments and (preventive) interventions 
in child and adolescent development. The British National Institute of Health 
and Care Excellence, for example, insists on the use of gains in Quality 
Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) to compute the "value for money" of interventions. 
But what counts as a gain in quality of life? For one of the most widely used 
instruments, the EuroQol 5 Dimensions scale (EQ-5D), QALYs are estimated by 
healthy individuals who provide utility scores for specific health states, 
assuming that the best life is a life without self-experienced problems in five 
domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression. The worst imaginable outcome is defined as "a lot of 
problems" in each of these five domains. The impact of the individual's problems 
on the social network is not weighted, and important social-developmental 
domains (externalizing problems, social competence) are missing. Current 
cost-utility computations based on EQ-5D favor physical health over mental 
health, and they rely on adult weights for child and adolescent quality of life. 
Thus, a level playing field is absent, and developmental expertise is sorely 
missing.

PURPOSE: Life expectancy has become a core consideration in prostate cancer 
care. While multiple prediction tools exist to support decision making, their 
discriminative ability remains modest, which hampers usage and utility. We 
examined whether combining patient reported and claims based health measures 
into prediction models improves performance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results)-CAHPS (Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) we 
identified men 65 years old or older diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2004 to 
2013 and extracted 4 types of data, including demographics, cancer information, 
claims based health measures and patient reported health measures. Next, we 
compared the performance of 5 nested competing risk regression models for other 
cause mortality. Additionally, we assessed whether adding new health measures to 
established prediction models improved discriminative ability.
RESULTS: Among 3,240 cases 246 (7.6%) died of prostate cancer while 631 (19.5%) 
died of other causes. The National Cancer Institute Comorbidity Index score was 
associated but weakly correlated with patient reported overall health (p <0.001, 
r=0.21). For predicting other cause mortality the 10-year area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve improved from 0.721 (demographics only) 
to 0.755 with cancer information and to 0.777 and 0.812 when adding claims based 
and patient reported health measures, respectively. The full model generated the 
highest value of 0.820. Models based on existing tools also improved in their 
performance with the incorporation of new data types as predictor variables (p 
<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Prediction models for life expectancy that combine patient reported 
and claims based health measures outperform models that incorporate these 
measures separately. However, given the modest degree of improvement, the 
implementation of life expectancy tools should balance model performance with 
data availability and fidelity.

BACKGROUND: Independent decision-making is one of the basic rights of patients. 
However, in clinical practice, most older cancer patients' treatment decisions 
are made by family members.
OBJECTIVE: This study attempted to analyze the treatment decision-making process 
and formation mechanism for older cancer patients within the special cultural 
context of Chinese medical practice.
METHOD: A qualitative study was conducted. With the sample saturation principle, 
data collected by in-depth interviews with 17 family members and 12 patients 
were subjected to thematic analysis.
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The study was approved by the ethics committees of Sun 
Yat-sen University. All participants provided verbal informed consent after 
being told their rights of confidentiality, anonymity, and voluntary 
participation. They had the right to refuse to answer questions and could 
withdraw at any time.
RESULTS: Three themes emerged: (1) complex process; (2) transformation of family 
decision-making power; and (3) individual compromise. Family members inevitably 
had different opinions during the long process of treatment decision-making for 
older cancer patients. The direction of this process could be regarded as an 
extension of the family power relationship. The patient usually compromised the 
decision to survive, which was made by family members.
CONCLUSION: This study describes the treatment decision-making process of older 
cancer patients in the context of Chinese culture. The reasons underlying this 
process are related to the views on life and death and family values. An 
individual is a part of the family, which is often seen as the minimal 
interpersonal unit in Chinese society. It is significant that while emphasizing 
patient autonomy in the decision-making process, health professionals should 
also pay attention to the important roles of culture and family.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of low-dose 
rivaroxaban plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for patients with stable 
cardiovascular diseases in the Taiwan setting.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to project the lifetime direct medical 
costs and quality-adjusted life-years of both therapies. Transitional 
probabilities were derived from the COMPASS trial, and the costs and utilities 
were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database and published 
studies. One-way, scenario, subgroup, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were performed to assess the uncertainty. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
was presented as the outcome. The threshold of willingness-to-pay was set at 
US$76,368 (3 times the gross domestic product per capita of Taiwan). All 
analyses were operated by TreeAge 2019 and Microsoft Excel.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of rivaroxaban plus aspirin 
versus aspirin alone in the patients with stable cardiovascular diseases, 
coronary artery diseases, and peripheral artery diseases were US$83,459, 
US$69,852 and -US$13,823 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. 
The probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the probabilities of 
cost-effectiveness for the regimen with rivaroxaban among those with 
cardiovascular diseases and coronary artery diseases were 44.1% and 65.3% at 
US$76,368.
CONCLUSION: Low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin is less likely to be a 
cost-effective alternative to aspirin in secondary prevention for the patients 
with stable cardiovascular diseases; however, among these patients, the regimen 
may have pharmacoeconomic incentives for the group merely having chronic 
coronary artery diseases from the Taiwan national payer's perspective. The 
pharmacoeconomic incentives are influenced by the drug price, event treatment 
fees, and willingness-to-pay threshold.

Background Anthracycline based chemotherapy is commonly used in many 
malignancies. While life expectancy increases with the use of this medication, 
cardiac toxicity causes a risk for patients' health due to anthracyclines. 
Objective This systematic review and meta-analysis emphasizes on prevention of 
anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity in breast cancer and lymphoma patients. 
Methods We conducted a systematic review of electronic databases including 
PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, and the Cochrane 
Library from inception to June 2019 collecting published articles on primary 
prevention of anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity in breast cancer and 
lymphoma patients. We conducted a network meta-analysis and a pairwise 
meta-analysis in order to compare direct and indirect cardiac agents group with 
control group calculate left ventricular ejection fraction change. Primary 
studies results were pooled using random effects model, frequent network 
meta-analyses, and performed pairwise meta-analysis using netmeta and meta 
packages respectively in R software version 3.5.1. Results Twelve studies 
reported left ventricular ejection fraction outcome among 526 patients in the 
cardiac agent group and 508 in the control group. Based on Surface Under the 
Cumulative Ranking cure result, spironolactone was the best in left ventricular 
ejection fraction change and based on meta-analysis, cardiac group had 1.98 unit 
left ventricular ejection fraction more than the control group (MD = 1.98, 95% 
CI 0.15-3.81, p value = 0.03). Conclusions The amount of left ventricular 
ejection fraction used by cardiac agents in anthracycline-based chemotherapy was 
reduced to a lesser extent. The effective and ineffective drugs were 
spironolactone and metoprolol, respectively.

Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome (SWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by 
skeletal dysplasia and severe dysautonomia, evidencing a difficult airway 
approach and likely increased malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. 
Developmental dysmorphism classically worsens with age, therefore translating in 
a poor prognosis. In this article, we describe a case of a 27-year-old woman 
diagnosed with SWS proposed for abscess drainage under dissociative anesthesia. 
This patient has outlived the life expectancy described for SWS, acknowledging 
the importance of reporting this rare adult clinical case in what SWS anesthetic 
management is concerned.

The public health crisis caused by COVID-19 disease has bring again to the 
public arena the old debate of the role in decision-making process of politics 
and science. In this paper we analyze, in the context of the current pandemics, 
how politics has left a stellar role for science, either because science has 
anticipated in its proposals to politics, or because politics has opted for it 
as a premeditated strategy. The references to the opinion of scientists as a 
decision-making criterion or, furthermore, their presence as true spokesmen for 
authority have been so frequent. This means rediscovering science and health as 
instruments of power, in terms that remind us of what Foucault denounced almost 
fifty years ago with his Biopolitics.

BACKGROUND: The recent innovation activities of global top-tier pharmaceutical 
companies in accordance with global and regional health concerns were 
investigated in order to identify their innovations contributing to population 
health.
METHODS: "Innovation activity" was defined as the number of drugs for which R&D 
activities have been reported within the last three years. Such activities were 
measured by collecting the data on drug developments and classifying them by 
developer company, phase of development, therapeutic use, and the country in 
which the development conducted. Subsequently, we examined and compared the 
correlations between the global innovation activities of the top 20 
pharmaceutical companies and the disease burden measured in disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) by income level and region. In addition, this study analyzed 
the association between country-specific innovations and DALYs in the 
corresponding countries.
RESULTS: At a global level, the innovation activities were not associated with 
global DALYs. However, when analyzed by income level, the innovation activities 
were associated with DALYs in high income and upper middle income countries 
while it was not associated with DALYs in low middle income and low income 
countries. In terms of region, correlations were found between the innovation 
activities and DALYs in the European region, the Americas, and the Western 
Pacific region whereas such correlations were not found in the African, Eastern 
Mediterranean, and South-East Asian regions. Similar to the analyses by income 
level and region, correlations between country-specific innovations and DALYs 
were only found in high income or high GDP countries. In addition, an empirical 
analysis of several cases including Canada, Germany, South Korea, and the United 
Kingdom revealed that pharmaceutical innovation is more closely related to 
market size than disease burden.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that discrepancies between pharmaceutical 
innovation and public health needs, i.e., disease burden values, have persisted 
until recently. To alleviate this imbalance, both public and private sectors 
should not only fulfill their respective roles and responsibilities regarding 
these issues, but also make strategic and collaborative efforts such as Product 
Development Partnerships (PDPs) directed toward public health improvement.

Ecologic association between influenza and COVID-19 mortality rates in European 
countries.

Kong, Hong Kong, China.

Ecologic studies investigating COVID-19 mortality determinants, used to make 
predictions and design public health control measures, generally focused on 
population-based variable counterparts of individual-based risk factors. 
Influenza is not causally associated with COVID-19, but shares population-based 
determinants, such as similar incidence/mortality trends, transmission patterns, 
efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions, comorbidities and underdiagnosis. 
We investigated the ecologic association between influenza mortality rates and 
COVID-19 mortality rates in the European context. We considered the 3-year 
average influenza (2014-2016) and COVID-19 (31 May 2020) crude mortality rates 
in 34 countries using EUROSTAT and ECDC databases and performed correlation and 
regression analyses. The two variables - log transformed, showed significant 
Spearman's correlation ρ = 0.439 (P = 0.01), and regression coefficients, b = 
0.743 (95% confidence interval, 0.272-1.214; R2 = 0.244; P = 0.003), b = 0.472 
(95% confidence interval, 0.067-0.878; R2 = 0.549; P = 0.02), unadjusted and 
adjusted for confounders (population size and cardiovascular disease mortality), 
respectively. Common significant determinants of both COVID-19 and influenza 
mortality rates were life expectancy, influenza vaccination in the elderly 
(direct associations), number of hospital beds per population unit and crude 
cardiovascular disease mortality rate (inverse associations). This analysis 
suggests that influenza mortality rates were independently associated with 
COVID-19 mortality rates in Europe, with implications for public health 
preparedness, and implies preliminary undetected SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe.

Hypertension in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) is largely 
undiagnosed and uncontrolled, representing an untapped opportunity for public 
health improvement. Implementation of hypertension control strategies in 
low-resource settings depends in large part on cost considerations. However, 
evidence on the cost-effectiveness of hypertension interventions in LMICs is 
varied across geographical, clinical and evaluation contexts. We conducted a 
comprehensive search for published economic evaluations of hypertension 
treatment programmes in LMICs. The search identified 71 articles assessing a 
wide range of hypertension intervention designs and cost components, of which 42 
studies across 15 countries reported estimates of cost-effectiveness. Although 
comparability of results was limited due to heterogeneity in the interventions 
assessed, populations studied, costs and study quality score, most interventions 
that reported cost per averted disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) were 
cost-effective, with costs per averted DALY not exceeding national income 
thresholds. Programme elements that may reduce cost-effectiveness included 
screening for hypertension at younger ages, addressing prehypertension, or 
treating patients at lower cardiovascular disease risk. Cost-effectiveness 
analysis could provide the evidence base to guide the initiation and development 
of hypertension programmes.

OBJECTIVES: The impact of coronary heart disease (CHD) and its effect on work 
productivity at a population level remains unknown in Indonesia. This study 
estimates the health and productivity lost to CHD in terms of years of life, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and productivity-adjusted life years 
(PALYs).
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A life-table model was constructed to simulate the 
experiences of Indonesians currently aged 15-54 years (working age) with CHD, 
followed-up to 55 years (retirement age). The life-table analysis was then 
repeated assuming that the cohort did not have CHD. Differences in the results 
reflected the impact of CHD. Demographical, prevalence and mortality data were 
based on the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study and 2018 Indonesian National 
Health Survey. Costs, productivity indices and utilities were derived from 
published sources. The cost of each PALY was assumed to be equivalent to gross 
domestic product per equivalent full-time worker (US$11 765). Future costs and 
outcomes were discounted by 3% annually.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in total deaths, years of 
life and PALYs represented the impact of CHD.
RESULTS: At present, 1 954 543 (1.45%) Indonesians of working-age have CHD. By 
retirement age, it was estimated that CHD resulted in 32 492 (36.6%) excess 
deaths, 128 132 (0.5%) years of life lost, 2 331 495 (10.5%) QALYs lost and 
1 589 490 (6.9%) PALYs lost. The economic impact of lost productivity amounted 
to US$33.3 billion, and healthcare costs to US$139 billion.
CONCLUSION: The health and economic burden of CHD in Indonesia looms large. This 
highlights the importance of its prevention and control, strategies for which, 
if effective, will deliver financial return.

INTRODUCTION: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is offered to reduce the risk of 
further cardiac events and to improve patients' health and quality of life 
following a cardiac event. Psychological care is a common component of CR as 
symptoms of depression and/or anxiety are more prevalent in this population, 
however evidence for the cost-effectiveness of current interventions is limited. 
Metacognitive therapy (MCT), is a recent treatment development that is effective 
in treating anxiety and depression in mental health settings and is being 
evaluated in CR patients. This protocol describes the planned approach to the 
economic evaluation of MCT for CR patients.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The economic evaluation work will consist of a 
within-trial analysis and an economic model. The PATHWAY Group MCT study has 
been prospectively designed to collect comprehensive self-reported resource use 
and health outcome data, including the EQ-5D, within a randomised controlled 
trial study design (UK Clinical Trials Gateway). A within-trial economic 
evaluation and economic model will compare the cost-effectiveness of MCT plus 
usual care (UC) to UC, from a health and social care perspective in the UK. The 
within-trial analysis will use intention-to-treat and estimate total costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the trial follow-up. Single imputation 
will be used to impute missing baseline variables. Multiple imputation will be 
used to impute values missing at follow-up. Items of resource use will be 
multiplied by published national healthcare costs. Regression analysis will be 
used to estimate net costs and net QALYs and these estimates will be 
bootstrapped to generate 10 000 net pairs of costs and QALYs to inform the 
probability of cost-effectiveness. A decision analytical economic model will be 
developed to synthesise trial data with the published literature over a longer 
time frame. Sensitivity analysis will explore uncertainty. Guidance of the 
methods for economic models will be followed and dissemination will adhere to 
reporting guidelines.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The economic evaluation includes a within-trial 
analysis. The trial which included the collection of this data was reviewed and 
approved by Ethics. Ethics approval was obtained by the Preston Research Ethics 
Committee (project ID 156862). The modelling analysis is not applicable for 
Ethics as it will use data from the trial (secondary analysis) and the published 
literature. Results of the main trial and economic evaluation will be published 
in the peer-reviewed National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) journals 
library (Programme Grants for Applied Research), submitted to a peer-reviewed 
journal and presented at appropriate conferences.

INTRODUCTION: Increased life expectancy has led to an increased demand for 
family members to provide informal care for their older relatives in the home. 
Many studies suggest informal caregivers are at greater risk of experiencing 
symptoms of depression. However, there is a lack of research examining the 
effectiveness of psychological interventions targeting these symptoms alongside 
clinical and methodological moderators potentially associated with intervention 
effectiveness. This review aims to address this gap and will inform the 
development of a psychological intervention targeting depression among 
adult-child caregivers of older parents, given many studies show that among 
informal caregivers of older adults, adult children experience specific 
difficulties and needs for psychological support. Further, the lack of studies 
targeting adult children specifically necessitates conducting this review 
targeting caregivers of older adults in general.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Randomised controlled trials of psychological 
interventions targeting symptoms of depression among informal caregivers will be 
identified via a systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, Cumulative 
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Excerpta Medica DataBase, 
PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and Web of Science) and supplemented by handsearching 
of previous systematic reviews, reference and forward citation checking, and 
expert contact. If possible, a meta-analysis will be conducted to examine the: 
(1) effectiveness of psychological interventions for depression among informal 
caregivers of older adults, (2) effectiveness of psychological interventions for 
secondary outcomes such as anxiety, stress, caregiver burden, psychological 
distress, quality of life, well-being and self-efficacy and (3) moderating 
effects of clinical and methodological factors on effectiveness.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval will not be necessary for this study 
given primary data will not be collected. Results will inform the development of 
a psychological intervention for adult-child caregivers of older parents and 
will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and 
conference presentations.

INTRODUCTION: Early childhood is an important life stage which is crucial for 
determining health and health inequalities in later life. At the meso-level 
(institutional-level), early childcare facilities (eg, kindergartens, 
preschools) are the most important agent of socialisation next to families in 
young children aged 06 years. In recent years, an increasing amount of studies 
has focused on contextual and compositional characteristics of early childcare 
facilities and their association with health (eg, self-rated health), health 
behaviour (eg, physical activity) and well-being (eg, emotional well-being) in 
this age group. However, as currently no overview of the available literature on 
this topic exists, we will conduct a scoping review including various study 
designs (eg, cross-sectional studies, prospective studies, qualitative studies).
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. A systematic 
search of the following scientific databases will be conducted: PubMed/Medline, 
PsycInfo, Sociological Abstracts, Education Resources Information Center and The 
Cochrane Library. During the selection process, we will follow a two-step 
process. First, two reviewers will independently screen titles/abstracts of all 
potentially eligible articles by applying a set of previously defined inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. After the completion of the title/abstract screening, 
full texts of the remaining articles will be screened following the same 
procedure. To determine inter-rater agreement between reviewers, we will 
calculate Cohen's Kappa after both steps. Key characteristics (eg, country of 
origin, sample size, study design) of included articles will be extracted. We 
will map the evidence available by providing a summary table on the key 
characteristics extracted and by presenting the associations using various types 
of illustrations.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Since no primary data will be collected for this 
review, ethical approval is not required. Our findings will be published in an 
international peer-reviewed journal and presented at national and international 
conferences.

BACKGROUND: Income has seldom been used to study social differences in 
disability-free life expectancy (DFLE). This study investigates income 
inequalities in life expectancy and DFLE at age 50 and 65 and estimates the 
contributions from the mortality and disability effects on the differences 
between income groups.
METHODS: Life tables by income quintile were constructed using Danish register 
data on equivalised disposable household income and mortality. Data on activity 
limitations from the Danish part of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement 
in Europe (SHARE) was linked to register data on income. For each income 
quintile, life table data and prevalence data of no activity limitations from 
SHARE were combined to estimate DFLE. Differences between income quintiles in 
DFLE were decomposed into contributions from mortality and disability effects.
RESULTS: A clear social gradient was seen for life expectancy as well as DFLE. 
Life expectancy at age 50 differed between the highest and lowest income 
quintiles by 8.6 years for men and 5.5 years for women. The difference in DFLE 
was 12.8 and 11.0 years for men and women, respectively. The mortality effect 
from the decomposition contributed equally for men and slightly more for women 
to the difference in expected lifetime without than with activity limitations. 
The disability effect contributed by 8.5 years for men and 8.0 years for women.
CONCLUSION: The income inequality gradient was steeper for DFLE than life 
expectancy. Since income inequality increases, DFLE by income is an important 
indicator for monitoring social inequality in the growing share of elderly 
people.

Trigger finger (TF) disorder is a sudden release or locking of a finger during 
flexion or extension. Treatments for this disease are conservative and surgical, 
including NSAIDs, hand splints, corticosteroid injections, physical therapies 
and percutaneous or open surgery. However, the effectiveness about the optimal 
treatment of TF is still in lack of evidence. The aim of this study is to 
investigate the effectiveness of physical therapies as conservative treatment 
for trigger finger. A comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE (via 
PubMed), Cochrane Library Databases and PEDro databases has been conducted 
without limits because few papers were published about this argument. The 
literature search identified four papers in PubMed. Two types of physical 
therapies were used in the conservative management of trigger finger: external 
shock wave therapy (ESWT) in three papers, and ultrasound therapy (UST) in one 
paper. ESWT is an effective and safe therapy for the conservative management of 
TF. It seems to reduce pain and trigger severity and to improve functional level 
and quality of life. UST has proven to be useful to prevent the recurrence of TF 
symptoms. Even if the results suggest the effectiveness of ESWT and UST for TF, 
future studies are necessary to understand the characteristics of the optimal 
treatment protocol for trigger finger.

Atypical progeroid syndrome (APS) comprises heterogeneous disorders 
characterized by variable degrees of fat loss, metabolic alterations, and 
comorbidities that affect skeleton, muscles, and/or the heart. We describe 3 
patients that were referred to our center for the suspicion of lipodystrophy. 
They had precocious aging traits such as short stature, mandibular hypoplasia, 
beaked nose, and partial alopecia manifesting around 10 to 15 years of age 
recurrently associated with: (1) partial lipodystrophy; (2) proteinuric 
nephropathy; (3) heart disease (rhythm disorders, valvular abnormalities, and 
cardiomyopathy); and (4) sensorineural hearing impairment. In all patients, 
genetic testing revealed a missense heterozygous lamin A/C gene (LMNA) mutation 
c.1045 C > T (p.Arg349Trp). Ten patients with LMNA p.R349W mutation have been 
reported so far, all presenting with similar features, which represent the key 
pathological hallmarks of this subtype of APS. The associated kidney and cardiac 
complications occurring in the natural history of the disease may reduce life 
expectancy. Therefore, in these patients a careful and periodic cardiac and 
kidney function evaluation is required.

Do changes in psychosocial factors, lifestyle factors and sitting posture 
influence the likelihood of musculoskeletal pain in high school computer users?

South Africa.

OBJECTIVES: Adolescents regularly engage in screen-based activities. Complex 
factors influence adolescents' growth, and habitual sitting posture. The 
association between over-time changes in their sitting posture, and upper 
quadrant musculoskeletal pain (UQMP) is poorly understood. This study tested the 
association between change over 12 months in seated posture angles (neck flexion 
[NF]; craniocervical angle [CCA] into flexion and extension; and thoracic 
flexion [TF]), UQMP, and predictor variables (anxiety and depression; sport 
activity, music participation; computer use).
METHODS: A one-year prospective longitudinal study enrolled 211 asymptomatic 
15-18-year students. 3D motion analysis captured postural angles while students 
worked on desktop computers, at baseline and 12 months later. Height, weight, 
computing time, sport and music participation, and depression and anxiety were 
measured at both time periods. UQMP in the previous month was captured at 
12 months. The association between over-time change in sitting posture angles 
and predictor variables was determined using linear regression analysis (r2 ; 
p-values). The association between predictor variables with UQMP, and predictor 
variables on the association between postural angles and UQMP was assessed using 
logistic regression models (Odds Ratios [95%CI]). Significant confounding 
effects were determined when the addition of a predictor variable to the 
posture-UQMP model significantly changed the Likelihood Ratio chi square value.
RESULTS: N = 153 students (72%) completed the study (48 with UQMP). Significant 
associations occurred between head flexion (HF) and body mass index (BMI) (r2= 
4.20, p = .01); NF and computer use (r2= 2.87, p = .036) and CCA and music 
participation (r2= 9.99, p = .047). Music participants and non-participants in 
sport or music had increased risk of UQMP with CCA changes into flexion (OR 
12.0) and TF changes into extension (OR 7.6) respectively.
CONCLUSION: The association between over-time-change in sitting posture angles 
and UQMP is not influenced by anthropometrics, psychosocial factors or time 
spent computing. Music students, and students not participating in sport, 
require further postural analysis.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to provide objective and real-life 
data concerning the impact of the COVID-19 pandemicon ophthalmology residency 
training in Portugal.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive survey-based study applied to current 
Portuguese ophthalmology residents (n = 80 eligible).
RESULTS: Seventy-five residents participated (94% response rate). All except one 
(99%) admitted a change in their routine clinical practice during the pandemic, 
and most (89%) continued to be engaged in ophthalmology department duties. 
Twenty-five percent were deployed to COVID-19 units, which was combined with 
ophthalmological activities in about half of them (47%). A significant 
proportion of participants stated that they were enrolled in the following 
ophthalmological activities: emergency/inpatient care (87%), outpatient visits 
(73%; general 70% vs subspecialty 29%), and surgical procedures (64%). 
Twenty-five percent did not assist in any outpatient visits and 36% did not 
participate in any surgical procedures. On a scale from 1 (no impact) to 5 
(maximum impact), most participants classified their perceived negative impact 
of the pandemic on the training program as 3 (24%), 4 (40%), or 5 (27%). 
Participants highly agreed with the extension of the residency program (80%) in 
order to to make up for training disruption.
DISCUSSION: Most trainees provided ophthalmological care during the pandemic. 
However, those clinical activities were essentially related to general and 
emergency care. Surgical experience was significantly curtailed. As such, 
strategies are needed to guarantee a high-quality learning process. Further 
studies are required to develop an international perspective on how 
ophthalmology training programs have been affected so that educational
