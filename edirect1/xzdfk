Variability in climate exerts a strong influence on vegetation productivity 
(gross primary productivity; GPP), and therefore has a large impact on the land 
carbon sink. However, no direct observations of global GPP exist, and estimates 
rely on models that are constrained by observations at various spatial and 
temporal scales. Here, we assess the consistency in GPP from global products 
which extend for more than three decades; two observation-based approaches, the 
upscaling of FLUXNET site observations (FLUXCOM) and a remote sensing derived 
light use efficiency model (RS-LUE), and from a suite of terrestrial biosphere 
models (TRENDYv6). At local scales, we find high correlations in annual GPP 
among the products, with exceptions in tropical and high northern latitudes. On 
longer time scales, the products agree on the direction of trends over 58% of 
the land, with large increases across northern latitudes driven by warming 
trends. Further, tropical regions exhibit the largest interannual variability in 
GPP, with both rainforests and savannas contributing substantially. Variability 
in savanna GPP is likely predominantly driven by water availability, although 
temperature could play a role via soil moisture-atmosphere feedbacks. There is, 
however, no consensus on the magnitude and driver of variability of tropical 
forests, which suggest uncertainties in process representations and underlying 
observations remain. These results emphasize the need for more direct long-term 
observations of GPP along with an extension of in situ networks in 
underrepresented regions (e.g., tropical forests). Such capabilities would 
support efforts to better validate relevant processes in models, to more 
accurately estimate GPP.

Cancer is the second cause of death worldwide, surpassed only by cardiovascular 
diseases, due to the lack of early diagnosis, and high relapse rate after 
conventional therapies. Chemotherapy inhibits the rapid growth of cancer cells, 
but it also affects normal cells with fast proliferation rate. Therefore, it is 
imperative to develop other safe and more effective treatment strategies, such 
as gene therapy, in order to significantly improve the survival rate and life 
expectancy of patients with cancer. The aim of gene therapy is to transfect a 
therapeutic gene into the host cells to express itself and cause a beneficial 
biological effect. However, the efficacy of the proposed strategies has been 
insufficient for delivering the full potential of gene therapy in the clinic. 
The type of delivery vehicle (viral or non viral) chosen depends on the desired 
specificity of the gene therapy. The first gene therapy trials were performed 
with therapeutic genes driven by viral promoters such as the CMV promoter, which 
induces non-specific toxicity in normal cells and tissues, in addition to cancer 
cells. The use of tumor-specific promoters over-expressed in the tumor, induces 
specific expression of therapeutic genes in a given tumor, increasing their 
localized activity. Several cancer- and/or tumor-specific promoters systems have 
been developed to target cancer cells. This review aims to provide up-to-date 
information concerning targeting gene therapy with cancer- and/or tumor-specific 
promoters including cancer suppressor genes, suicide genes, anti-tumor 
angiogenesis, gene silencing, and gene-editing technology, as well as the type 
of delivery vehicle employed. Gene therapy can be used to complement traditional 
therapies to provide more effective treatments.

In the last decades, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) 
revolutionized the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. The efficacy 
and safety of TAVR were first proven in inoperable and high-risk patients. Then, 
subsequent randomized clinical trials showed non-inferiority of TAVR as compared 
to surgical aortic valve replacement also in intermediate- and low-risk 
populations. As TAVR was progressively studied and clinically used in lower-risk 
patients, issues were raised questioning its opportunity in a younger population 
with a longer life-expectancy. As long-term follow-up data mainly derive from 
old studies with early generation devices on high or intermediate surgical risk 
patients, results can hardly be extended to most of currently treated patients 
who often show a low surgical risk and are treated with newer generation 
prostheses. Thus, in this low-risk younger population, decision making is 
difficult due to the lack of supporting data. The aim of the present review is 
to revise current literature regarding TAVR in younger patients.

Children with trisomy 13 and 18 (previously deemed "incompatible with life") are 
living longer, warranting a comprehensive overview of their unique comorbidities 
and complex care needs. This Review Article provides a summation of the recent 
literature, informed by the study team's Interdisciplinary Trisomy Translational 
Program consisting of representatives from: cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, 
neonatology, otolaryngology, intensive care, neurology, social work, chaplaincy, 
nursing, and palliative care. Medical interventions are discussed in the context 
of decisional-paradigms and whole-family considerations. The communication 
format, educational endeavors, and lessons learned from the study team's 
interdisciplinary care processes are shared with recognition of the potential 
for replication and implementation in other care settings.

Scythians: An exploration by using Bayesian methods.

OBJECTIVES: Studies of the demography of past populations involving 
deterministic life tables can be criticized for ignoring the errors of 
estimation. Bayesian methods offer an alternative, by focusing on the 
uncertainty of the estimates, although their results are often sensitive to the 
choice of prior distributions. The aim of this study is to explore a range of 
Bayesian methods for estimating age at death for a population of nomadic 
warriors-Scythians from the Black Sea region.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, skeletons of 312 individuals (93 children and 
219 adults) from Glinoe (Moldova), dated to the 5th-2nd century BCE, were 
examined. We unified the age categories corresponding to different aging 
methods, allowing an application of a probabilistic assessment of the age 
categorization. A hierarchical Bayesian multinomial-Dirichlet-Dirichlet model 
was applied, with a hypothetical, subjective reference population, a real 
reference population, and no reference.
RESULTS: Stationary-population life expectancy was estimated as 27.7 years (95% 
CI: 25.1-30.3) for a newborn (e0 ), and 16.4 years (14.0-19.0) for 20-year-olds 
(e20 ), although with high uncertainty, and sensitive to the model 
specification. Slight differences in longevity between different social strata 
and between the Classical and Late chronological periods were found, although 
with high estimation errors. A more robust finding, confirming earlier studies, 
was a high probability of death in young adulthood, which could depend on 
Scythian lifestyle (conflicts, wars).
DISCUSSION: Our study shows a way to overcome some limitations of broad age 
categorization by using the Bayesian approach with alternative model 
specifications, allowing to assess the impact of reference populations.

Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in women and accounts for 30% of 
all new cancers in the United States. The highest incidence of breast cancer is 
in women 70 to 74 years of age. Numerous risk factors are associated with the 
development of breast cancer. A risk assessment tool can be used to determine 
individual risk and help guide screening decisions. The U.S. Preventive Services 
Task Force (USPSTF) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend 
against teaching average-risk women to perform breast self-examinations. The 
USPSTF and AAFP recommend biennial screening mammography for average-risk women 
50 to 74 years of age. However, there is no strong evidence supporting a net 
benefit of mammography screening in average-risk women 40 to 49 years of age; 
therefore, the USPSTF and AAFP recommend individualized decision-making in these 
women. For average-risk women 75 years and older, the USPSTF and AAFP conclude 
that there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening, but the American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Cancer Society state 
that screening may continue depending on the woman's health status and life 
expectancy. Women at high risk of breast cancer may benefit from mammography 
starting at 30 years of age or earlier, with supplemental screening such as 
magnetic resonance imaging. Supplemental ultrasonography in women with dense 
breasts increases cancer detection but also false-positive results.

OBJECTIVES: Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) encompass 
histologically benign, dysplastic, and cancerous lesions that are often 
indistinguishable by appearance and inconsistently managed. We assessed the 
potential impact of test-and-treat pathways enabled by a point-of-care test for 
OPMD characterization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic model to compare life 
expectancy of test-treat strategies for 60-year-old patients with OPMDs in the 
primary dental setting, based on a trial for a point-of-care cytopathology tool 
(POCOCT). Eight strategies of OPMD detection and evaluation were compared, 
involving deferred evaluation (no further characterization), prompt OPMD 
characterization using POCOCT measurements, or the commonly recommended usual 
care strategy of routine referral for scalpel biopsy. POCOCT pathways differed 
in threshold for additional intervention, including surgery for any dysplasia or 
malignancy, or for only moderate or severe dysplasia or cancer. Strategies with 
initial referral for biopsy also reflected varied treatment thresholds in 
current practice between surgery and surveillance of mild dysplasia. Sensitivity 
analysis was performed to assess the impact of variation in parameter values on 
model results.
RESULTS: Requisite referral for scalpel biopsy offered the highest life 
expectancy of 20.92 life-years compared with deferred evaluation (+0.30 
life-years), though this outcome was driven by baseline assumptions of limited 
patient adherence to surveillance using POCOCT. POCOCT characterization and 
surveillance offered only 0.02 life-years less than the most biopsy-intensive 
strategy, while resulting in 27% fewer biopsies. When the probability of 
adherence to surveillance and confirmatory biopsy was ≥ 0.88, or when metastasis 
rates were lower than reported, POCOCT characterization extended life-years 
(+0.04 life-years) than prompt specialist referral.
CONCLUSION: Risk-based OPMD management through point-of-care cytology may offer 
a reasonable alternative to routine referral for specialist evaluation and 
scalpel biopsy, with far fewer biopsies. In patients who adhere to surveillance 
protocols, POCOCT surveillance may extend life expectancy beyond biopsy and 
follow up visual-tactile inspection.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a pediatric neuromuscular disease caused by 
genetic deficiency of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Pathological 
hallmarks of SMA are spinal motor neuron loss and skeletal muscle atrophy. The 
molecular mechanisms that elicit and drive preferential motor neuron 
degeneration and death in SMA remain unclear. Transcriptomic studies 
consistently report p53 pathway activation in motor neurons and spinal cord 
tissue of SMA mice. Recent work has identified p53 as an inducer of spinal motor 
neuron loss in severe Δ7 SMA mice. Additionally, the cyclin-dependent kinase 
inhibitor P21 (Cdkn1a), an inducer of cell cycle arrest and mediator of skeletal 
muscle atrophy, is consistently increased in motor neurons, spinal cords, and 
other tissues of various SMA models. p21 is a p53 transcriptional target but can 
be independently induced by cellular stressors. To ascertain whether p53 and p21 
signaling pathways mediate spinal motor neuron death in milder SMA mice, and how 
they affect the overall SMA phenotype, we introduced Trp53 and P21 null alleles 
onto the Smn2B/- background. We found that p53 and p21 depletion did not 
modulate the timing or degree of Smn2B/- motor neuron loss as evaluated using 
electrophysiological and immunohistochemical methods. Moreover, we determined 
that Trp53 and P21 knockout differentially affected Smn2B/- mouse lifespan: p53 
ablation impaired survival while p21 ablation extended survival through 
Smn-independent mechanisms. These results demonstrate that p53 and p21 are not 
primary drivers of spinal motor neuron death in Smn2B/- mice, a milder SMA mouse 
model, as motor neuron loss is not alleviated by their ablation.

This study aimed to analyse ten trace metal concentrations in the edible part of 
the freshwater clam Corbicula javanica and to provide a critical assessment of 
the potential risks to human health through consumption of this clam as food 
based on well-established indices and food safety guidelines. The clams were 
captured from a pristine original site and transplanted to other sites with 
different environmental qualities. The trace metal levels in the edible total 
soft tissue (TST) of the clam were below those of the food safety guidelines 
referred to except for Pb, which exceeded the permissible limit set by the 
European Commission (2006) and the US Food and Drug Administration/ Center for 
Food Safety and Applied Nutrition); Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference. 
(USFDA/CFSAN; ISSC) (2007). The estimated daily intake (EDI) values of the clam 
were found to be lower than the oral reference dose and the calculated target 
hazard quotient (THQ) and total THQ were found to be less than 1. Therefore, in 
conclusion, the human health risk for consumption of TST of C. javanica at both 
average and high-level were insignificant regardless of the environment it was 
exposed to.

Unpredictable disease trajectories make early clarification of end-of-life (EoL) 
care preferences in older patients with multimorbidity advisable. This mixed 
methods systematic review synthesizes studies and assesses such preferences. Two 
independent reviewers screened title/abstracts/full texts in seven databases, 
extracted data and used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool to assess risk of bias 
(RoB). We synthesized findings from 22 studies (3243 patients) narratively and, 
where possible, quantitatively. Nineteen studies assessed willingness to receive 
life-sustaining treatments (LSTs), six, the preferred place of care, and eight, 
preferences regarding shared decision-making processes. When unspecified, 21% of 
patients in four studies preferred any LST option. In three studies, fewer 
patients chose LST when faced with death and deteriorating health, and more when 
treatment promised life extension. In 13 studies, 67% and 48% of patients 
respectively were willing to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 
mechanical ventilation, but willingness decreased with deteriorating health. 
Further, 52% of patients from three studies wished to die at home. Seven studies 
showed that unless incapacitated, most patients prefer to decide on their EoL 
care themselves. High non-response rates meant RoB was high in most studies. 
Knowledge of EoL care preferences of older patients with multimorbidity 
increases the chance such care will be provided.

BACKGROUND: Perimenopause is the period in a woman's life during which she 
passes from the reproductive to the nonreproductive stage. According to the 2008 
estimates, the number of menopausal women in India was 43 million. Projected 
values in 2026 depict the menopausal population at 103 million. Due to the 
increasing life expectancy, improved quality of life is imperative to decrease 
the disability and frailty of a society.
OBJECTIVES: To study the quality of life of perimenopausal women in rural areas 
of Etawah district, Uttar Pradesh, and the various factors associated with it.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a community-based cross-sectional study conducted 
in 4 villages in the Saifai block of Etawah district, Uttar Pradesh, India. One 
hundred and ninety-nine healthy, perimenopausal women of the age group 45-55 
years were included in the study. Data were collected on sociodemographic 
variables, and Menopause Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire - Intervention 
version questionnaire was used to assess the quality of life.
RESULTS: The mean age of attainment of menopause was 45.38 ± 3.58 years. 
Majority of the women experienced physical (100%) and psychosocial (94.5%) 
symptoms; the most common symptom being "decrease in physical strength" (86.4%) 
and being able to "accomplish less than previously" (80.4%). Women who handled 
stress poorly showed severe vasomotor (P = 0.047) and psychosocial (P = 0.014) 
symptoms. Postmenopausal women who regularly exercised were 52.6% less likely to 
have vasomotor symptoms (odd's ratio OR 0.474 (0.235-0.960), P = 0.038).
CONCLUSION: The quality of life among the study population was affected by the 
physical and psychosocial problems they experienced. By taking appropriate 
preventive measures, these can be ameliorated, and further deterioration can be 
checked.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Large non-age-specific radiotherapy utilisation rate 
(RTU) studies have demonstrated that actual RTU is below the optimal recommended 
utilisation rate for both curative and palliative intent radiotherapy 
indications. The optimal utilisation rate for the geriatric oncology cohort of 
patients has not yet been determined. The purpose of this research was to 
examine the actual RTU for patients treated in New South Wales (NSW), Australia 
as a function of increasing age, and the relationship between RTU and tumour 
site, travelling distance and socio-economic status.
MATERIALS & METHODS: NSW Central Cancer Registry data (2009-2011) were linked to 
the NSW Radiotherapy Dataset (2009-2012). RTU was calculated for patients aged 
<80 years and ≥80 years. RTU was defined as the proportion of patients receiving 
at least a single course of radiotherapy within 12 months of a cancer diagnosis.
RESULTS: 110,645 patients were diagnosed with cancer, of whom 27,721 received at 
least one course of radiotherapy. The overall RTU was 25%. RTU for patients aged 
<80 years was 28% compared to 14% for patients aged 80+ years (p < 0.001). On 
both univariate and multivariate analysis, increasing age, residential address 
in disadvantaged socioeconomic areas and increasing distance to the nearest 
radiotherapy department were associated with a reduction in RTU.
CONCLUSION: Geriatric oncology patients are less likely to receive radiotherapy 
than their younger counterparts. Some of the reduction in RTU may be justifiable 
on the basis of limited life expectancy and co-morbidity. Further research is 
required to determine the co-morbidity adjusted optimal RTU in older patients.

Cancer is predominantly a disease of the elderly and as population life 
expectancy increases, so will the incidence of malignant disease. Elderly 
patients often have other comorbidities and social complexities, increasing the 
support required to safely deliver all treatment modalities. Brachytherapy is a 
relatively simple technique by which radiation therapy can be delivered. It 
offers dosimetric advantages through a highly conformal dose distribution 
thereby limiting radiation exposure to normal tissues reducing toxicity. 
Requiring fewer hospital visits, it also offers practical and logistical 
advantages to the elderly population and in many cases can be performed without 
the need for general anaesthesia. In tumour streams where brachytherapy forms 
part of the curative management, it should not be omitted in elderly patients 
who are medically fit for treatment. In the palliative setting, brachytherapy 
often offers an excellent means for achieving either local tumour and/or symptom 
control and should be actively considered in the therapeutic armamentarium of 
the oncologist in this context.

PURPOSE: Infiltrative-appearance hepatocellular carcinoma presents a challenge 
to clinicians as diagnostic criteria continue to evolve and evidence-based 
treatment guidelines have yet to be established. While transarterial 
radioembolization has shown efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma, many studies 
exclude infiltrative-appearance HCC in their analysis. The purpose of this study 
was to describe imaging features of infiltrative-appearance hepatocellular 
carcinoma and evaluate effects of radioembolization on survival.
METHODS: In a retrospective review, infiltrative HCC patients treated from 2008 
to 2017 were identified. Patients were divided into two groups: TARE versus 
systemic therapy/palliative care. Demographics, dates of diagnosis/expiry, 
albumin, international normalized ratio (INR), sodium, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), 
creatinine, Child-Pugh class, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, 
bilirubin, radiation dose and volume were collected. Patients with bilirubin > 3 
were excluded. Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test assessed differences 
between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazard analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were identified, 15 underwent TARE while 38 served 
as control. Mean age was 60, 43 patients were male. The mean overall survival 
was 16.2 months for the TARE group and 5.3 months for the control group 
(Log-rank p < 0.0001). Cox proportional regression analysis revealed significant 
associations between survival and albumin (HR 0.210, 0.052-0.839, p = 0.027), 
Child-Pugh class B (HR 0.196, 0.055-0.696, p = 0.012), sorafenib (HR 0.106, 
0.031-0.360, p < 0.001), and number of affected liver lobes (HR 1.864, 
1.387-2.506, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Transarterial radioembolization for infiltrative HCC improves life 
expectancy compared to treatment with comfort measures or systemic therapy.

The advent of combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) as a treatment for HIV-1 
infection has not only resulted in a dramatic decrease in the peripheral viral 
load but has also led to increased life expectancy of the infected individuals. 
Paradoxically, increased lifespan is accompanied with higher prevalence of 
age-related comorbidities, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders 
(HAND). Present study was aimed at exploring the role of HIV TAT protein in 
mediating microglial mitochondrial oxidative stress, ultimately resulting in 
neuroinflammation and microglial senescence. Our findings demonstrated that 
exposure of mouse primary microglial cells (mPMs) to HIV TAT protein resulted in 
a senescence-like phenotype, that was characterized by elevated expression of 
both p16 and p21 proteins, increased numbers of 
senescence-associated-β-galactosidase positive cells, augmented cell-cycle 
arrest, increased release of proinflammatory cytokines and decreased telomerase 
activity. Additionally, exposure of mPMs to HIV TAT also resulted downregulation 
of SIRT3 with a concomitant increase in mitochondrial oxidative stress. Dual 
luciferase reporter assay identified miR-505 as a novel target of SIRT3, which 
was upregulated in mPMs exposed to HIV TAT. Furthermore, transient transfection 
of mPMs with either the SIRT3 plasmid or miRNA-505 inhibitor upregulated the 
expression of SIRT3 and mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes, with a concomitant 
decrease in microglial senescence. These in vitro findings were also validated 
in the prefrontal cortices and striatum of HIV transgenic rats as well as 
cART-treated HIV-infected individuals. In summary, this study underscores a yet 
undiscovered novel mechanism(s) underlying HIV TAT-mediated induction of 
senescence phenotype in microglia, involving the miR-505-SIRT3 axis-mediated 
induction of mitochondrial oxidative stress.

Prediction of Half-Life Extension of Peptides via Serum Albumin Binding: Current 
Challenges.

The development of peptide therapeutics has increased enormously in recent 
decades. Many of the peptide drugs and antibody fragments that lack Fc backbone 
have a short half-life in circulation. In general, the half-life supports the 
design of the dosing regimen and frequency of administration, which are key 
aspects in the discovery of peptide drugs intended for long duration of action. 
Less frequent administration such as weekly or monthly can improve compliance 
and adherence to therapy. Serum albumin binding is a key approach to extend the 
half-life of peptide drugs. Despite the evidence of half-life prolongation of a 
variety of peptide drugs via albumin, quantitative prediction for humans is 
still a key question. Challenges in the measurement of albumin binding and in 
understanding the clearance mechanisms can limit quantitative prediction. We 
integrated pharmacokinetic concepts and albumin binding across species in a 
quantitative model to be used as a tool for prediction of half-life. Preliminary 
validation on a limited dataset indicated a good correlation between predicted 
and observed values. Further development of more quantitative models is 
warranted.

INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Urinary bladder injury during cesarean delivery is 
an uncommon complication with substantial maternal morbidity. The aim of this 
study was to identify possible risk factors for bladder injury during cesarean 
delivery and to describe the role of retrograde bladder filling in the 
assessment of bladder wall integrity.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study at a large tertiary referral center. Women 
who underwent cesarean delivery between 2003 and 2017 were included. Women 
diagnosed with urinary bladder injury were compared to women who did not have 
such injuries. Data retrieved included demographic characteristics, general 
medical history, obstetric history and intra-partum and intra-operative data. 
Information regarding use of retrograde bladder filling intra-operatively was 
retrieved as well.
RESULTS: During the study period, 21,177 cesarean deliveries were performed of 
which 68 (0.3%) cases of urinary bladder injury were identified. Two-thirds of 
injuries were located at the urinary bladder dome with the remaining third 
located at the posterior bladder wall. Most injuries were formed during uterine 
incision extension (60.0%) followed by peritoneal entry (22.0%). Following uni- 
and multivariate analyses, three parameters remained independent risk factors 
for bladder injury: urinary bladder adhesions, failed vacuum attempt prior to 
cesarean delivery and size of the uterine incision extension. In 15.4% of cases 
in which retrograde bladder filling was utilized following bladder repair, 
leakage of fluid was evident.
CONCLUSION: Urinary bladder adhesions, failed vacuum attempt prior to cesarean 
delivery and size of uterine incision extension are independent risk factors for 
urinary bladder injury during cesarean delivery.

The aim of this study is to explore whether the single nucleotide polymorphism 
rs2275294 in the ZNF512B gene is related to the length of survival of patients 
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This prospective study examined 212 
patients with ALS, who were genotyped at the rs2275294 locus in ZNF512B using 
the ligase method. Genotype was compared with clinical data and survival. 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox hazard regression were used to identify 
risk factors of shorter survival. Our results were meta-analyzed together with 
previous work in order to examine the potential association between the 
rs2275294-C allele and survival. Of the 212 patients, 166 carried the CC + CT 
genotype at the rs2275294 locus, while 46 carried the TT genotype. Patients with 
the C allele showed significantly shorter survival than those without it 
(34.13 ± 1.9 vs. 45.32 ± 5.7 months, p = 0.036). Cox analysis identified the C 
allele and time from symptom onset to diagnosis as risk factors for shorter 
survival. Meta-analysis of 447 patients in China and Japan confirmed the 
rs2275294-C allele to be an independent risk factor of shorter survival in ALS 
patients. The C allele at the rs2275294 locus in ZNF512B is a risk factor for 
shorter survival in patients with ALS.

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is increasingly being 
used to treat oligometastatic cancers, but high-level evidence to provide a 
basis for policy making is scarce. Additional evidence from a real-world setting 
is required. We present the results of a national study of patients with 
extracranial oligometastases undergoing SABR, representing the largest dataset, 
to our knowledge, on outcomes in this population so far.
METHODS: In 2015, National Health Service (NHS) England launched a Commissioning 
through Evaluation scheme that funded a prospective, registry-based, single-arm, 
observational, evaluation study of patients with solid cancer and extracranial 
oligometastases treated with SABR. Prescribed doses ranged from 24-60 Gy 
administered in three to eight fractions. The study was done at 17 NHS 
radiotherapy centres in England. Patients were eligible for the scheme if aged 
18 years or older with confirmed primary carcinoma (excluding haematological 
malignancies), one to three extracranial metastatic lesions, a disease-free 
interval from primary tumour development to metastases of longer than 6 months 
(with the exception of synchronous colorectal liver metastases), a WHO 
performance status of 2 or lower, and a life expectancy of at least 6 months. 
The primary outcome was overall survival at 1 year and 2 years from the start of 
SABR treatment. The study is now completed.
