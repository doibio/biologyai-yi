OBJECTIVE: Alongside a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy 
of the ConquerFear intervention for reducing fear of cancer recurrence in cancer 
survivors, the cost-effectiveness of this novel intervention was assessed, 
primarily from the health sector perspective, with broader societal productivity 
impacts assessed.
METHODS: Health care resource use was collected by a tailored cost diary. 
Incremental costs were calculated as the difference in total costs between the 
intervention and control groups. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
were estimated by cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, comparing 
incremental costs with incremental outcomes measured. Nonparametric bootstrap 
analysis was performed to evaluate uncertainty in costs and outcomes.
RESULTS: Cancer survivors were randomized into ConquerFear (n = 121), or an 
active control group receiving relaxation training (n = 101). Participants 
received on average 3.69 sessions, incurring an average cost of $297 per person, 
with no group difference. The ITT analysis results indicated a mean ICER $34 300 
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with average incremental cost $488 and 
health gain of 0.0142 QALYs, from the health care sector perspective. Bootstrap 
analysis showed 30% of iterations were dominant and overall 53% ICERs were 
cost-effective as judged by the commonly used $50 000/QALY threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: The ConquerFear intervention is associated with a modest cost and 
may provide good value for money, but further evidence is needed. Long-term 
cost-effectiveness needs further investigation to capture full benefits from the 
intervention beyond the trial follow-up.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common hemoglobinopathy in the United 
States. SCD affects about 100,000 Americans, mostly of African 
descent. Approximately 20 million individuals worldwide are affected by SCD. The 
molecular basis of SCD was poorly understood when the disease was first 
described in the early 1900s. It was not until 1949 when Dr. Linus Pauling 
carried out a landmark study, that it was determined that this condition is 
caused by abnormal hemoglobin that sickles when exposed to a low-oxygen 
environment. The abnormal form of hemoglobin in SCD arises from a single amino 
acid mutation in the beta-globin gene called hemoglobin S. Because SCD is an 
autosomal recessive disorder, both beta-globin genes must be mutated for an 
individual to develop overt disease. When only a single copy of the gene is 
mutated, the resulting phenotype is termed sickle cell trait. Sickle cell trait 
is usually benign, but affected persons may develop sickled cells when exposed 
to exceptionally low pressures of oxygen. Since 1949, scientists have made 
steady progress in understanding the complex molecular pathology of SCD. 
However, until about two decades ago, no known cure for this genetic disorder 
existed. According to Dr. Mary T. Basset, a physician during the American civil 
rights movement, SCD research, screening, and treatment received little to no 
funding and was neglected because patients were primarily of African 
descent. One of the significant achievements of the civil rights movement in the 
1970s was the establishment of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of 
America and the creation of the Sickle Cell Anemia Act of 1972. Since then, 
there has been greater public awareness of SCD and incrementally more funding 
towards finding a cure, culminating in the first bone marrow stem cell 
transplant for SCD.  The Sickle Cell Anemia Act also improved screening 
processes for SCD. Today, in most parts of the United States, sickle cell 
screening is performed before discharging neonates from the hospital. This 
screening allows for early medical intervention and reduces morbidity and 
mortality from SCD. Treatment of SCD has improved, incorporating penicillin 
prophylaxis for children younger than 5, hydroxyurea to boost fetal hemoglobin 
levels, prophylactic blood transfusions, and pain medications, including 
opioids. Unfortunately, most of these treatments are palliative, and 
patients continue to experience poor quality of life because of recurrent pain 
episodes, end-organ damage, and a reduced life expectancy, underscoring the 
importance of seeking a cure for this condition. In September 2018, the National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) launched the Cure Sickle Cell 
Initiative. Under this initiative, efforts are being made to develop new genetic 
approaches to cure SCD. Advancement in gene therapy techniques has shown 
promising results in preclinical and clinical trials, but formal approval by the 
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is still awaited.

BACKGROUND: Burden of disease (BoD) estimations are increasingly used to 
prioritize public health interventions. Previous Cryptosporidium BoD models 
accounted only for acute episodes, while there is increasing evidence of 
long-term manifestations. Our objective was to update Cryptosporidium BoD and 
cost-of-illness (COI) models and to estimate BoD and COI for the Netherlands in 
years 2013-2017.
METHODS: We performed a scoping literature review and drew an outcome tree 
including long-term manifestations for which sufficient evidence was found, such 
as recurrent diarrhea and joint pain. We chose the Disability-Adjusted Life Year 
(DALY) metric to synthesize years of life lost due mortality (YLLs) and years 
lived with disability due to non-fatal outcomes (YLDs). For the costs, we 
adopted a societal perspective accounting for direct healthcare costs, patient 
costs and productivity losses. Uncertainty was managed using Latin Hypercube 
sampling (30,000 iterations).
RESULTS: In the Netherlands in 2017, we estimated 50,000 Cryptosporidium cases 
(95% uncertainty interval (UI): 15,000-102,000), 7,000 GP visits, 300 
hospitalizations and 3 deaths, resulting in 137 DALYs (95%UI: 54-255) and €19.2 
million COI (95%UI: €7.2 million- €36.2 million). Estimates were highest for 
2016 (218 DALYs and €31.1 million in COI), and lowest in 2013 (100 DALYs and 
€13.8 million in COI). Most of the BoD was attributable to YLD (≈80% of DALYs). 
The most important cost was productivity losses (≈90% of total COI). Long-term 
manifestations, including recurring diarrhea and joint pain, accounted for 9% of 
the total DALYs and 7% of the total COI.
CONCLUSION: Current evidence supports the inclusion of long-term manifestations 
in Cryptosporidium models, which contribute close to 10% of the total DALYs and 
costs. This may be an underestimation, as we were conservative in our 
assumptions. Cryptosporidium should be considered a priority organism with 
respect to public health surveillance, even in industrialized countries with 
high hygiene standards.

The relevance of gastrointestinal manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF) is 
increasing due to an improved life expectancy. We report on 2 adult patients 
with prior lung transplantation who presented with a severe inflammatory 
disorder of the ileocecal region. One patient underwent ileocecal resection; the 
second patient died after emergency surgery for intestinal perforation. Both 
cases did not show typical signs of CF-related distal intestinal obstruction 
syndrome or extensive fibrosing colonopathy. However, the clinical and 
histopathological findings revealed CF-induced inflammatory alterations of 
the intestinal mucosa. Thus, these cases illustrate a further CF-related bowel 
disorder, which can be especially relevant in long-term CF survivors.

Publisher: Aufgrund der gestiegenen Lebenserwartung von Patienten mit Zystischer 
Fibrose (CF) nimmt die Bedeutung gastrointestinaler Manifestationen der 
Erkrankung zu. In zwei Fallberichten stellen wir erwachsene, 
lungentransplantierte CF-Patienten mit ausgeprägten inflammatorischen 
Veränderungen der Ileozökalregion vor, welche letztlich einer operativen 
Versorgung zugeführt werden mussten. In beiden Fällen konnten keine eindeutigen 
Zeichen eines distalen intestinalen Obstruktionssyndroms oder einer 
zugrundeliegenden fibrosierenden Kolonopathie festgestellt werden. Dennoch 
sprechen sowohl das klinische Erscheinungsbild als auch die histopathologischen 
Befunde für das Vorliegen einer CF-induzierten entzündlichen intestinalen 
Erkrankung. Daher muss von einer bisher nicht ausreichend charakterisierten 
CF-Manifestation des Intestinums ausgegangen werden, welche besonders für 
erwachsene CF-Patienten von klinischer Relevanz ist.

China.

Objective: To investigate application value of "point-line-surface-volume" four 
dimensional holmium laser enucleation of prostate (HoLEP) in the treatment of 
benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Methods: From December 2016 to November 
2017, the clinical data of 60 cases of BPH with the treatment of 
"Point-line-surface-volume" four dimensional HoLEP at Department of Urology, 
Peking University Third Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. The age was 
(73.8±8.0) years (range: 60 to 96 years), body mass index was (23.2±3.6) kg/m(2) 
(range: 14.9 to 31.1 kg/m(2)), volume of prostate was (64.5±36.9) ml (range: 
15.5 to 197.9 ml). All the cases were operated by the same chief surgeon expert 
in endoscopic surgery. First of all, taking verumontanum as the anchor point, 
crossing point between the outer 45° line of verumontanum and middle line of the 
lateral lobe and verumontanum was made as the breakthrough point. The "blasting 
and paddling" method was used to find prostatic surgery capsule, and the two 
sides of the capsule plane were connected in front of the verumontanum. 
Secondly, the plane was maintained by the "fan tunnel" method, and the middle 
lobe and the lateral lobes were divided at the 5 o'clock and 7 o'clock 
positions. The glands of the middle lobe were first removed and pushed into the 
bladder. Then, on the anteroinferior inclined coronal plane through 12 o'clock 
point right above of verumontanum, the urethral mucosa was cut apart in a 
semi-curved shape in advance. Bilateral semi-curved incision confluenced above 
the verumontanum, and extend to the bladder neck to form an inverted Y-shaped 
groove which completely divided the bilateral lobes. Finally, the bilateral 
lobes were enucleated respectively, and glands in the bladder were removed by 
tissue morcellator. Clinical data included operative time, hemoglobin decrease, 
catheterization duration, postoperative hospital stay, preoperative and 
postoperative international prostate symptom score and quality of life (QOL) 
score. The efficiency of enucleation was calculated as prostatic volume divided 
by enucleation time (not including morcellation time). The efficiency of 
morcellation was calculated as prostatic volume divided by morcellation time. 
Paired t-test was used to compare the indexes before and after surgery. Results: 
All the operations of 60 cases were sumlessful, one of which prostate tissue was 
removed by conversion to transurethral resection prostate due to malfunction of 
tissue morcellator. The operative time was (115.2±52.9) minutes (range: 25 to 
276 minutes). The enucleation efficiency was (0.81±0.35) ml/minutes (range: 0.17 
to 1.58 ml/minutes). The morcellation efficiency was (6.60±4.28) ml/minutes 
(range: 0.89 to 17.42 ml/minutes). The hemoglobin was decreased by (15.9±12.3) 
g/L (range:-10 to 57 g/L). Meanwhile, catheterization duration was (5.2±2.9) 
days (range: 0.8 to 19.8 days), and postoperative hospital stays were (5.0±1.5) 
days (range: 1.9 to 11.9 days). Preoperative and postoperative IPSS scores 
(10.92±6.98 vs. 23.37±7.49, t=10.357, P=0.000) and QOL scores (1.75±1.62 vs. 
4.53±1.47, t=9.373, P=0.000) were significantly different. Postoperative 
complications included: 4 cases of fever (greater than 38.5 ℃), 1 case of acute 
epididymitis, 1 case of bladder mucosal injury, and 1 case of active bleeding 
need blood transfusion therapy. Conclusion: "Point-line-surface-volume" four 
dimensional HoLEP is an effective and safe minimally invasive method in the 
treatment of BPH.

Publisher: 目的： 总结"点线面体"四维法钬激光前列腺剜除术治疗良性前列腺增生的手术经验。 方法： 
回顾性分析2016年12月至2017年11月在北京大学第三医院泌尿外科接受"点线面体"四维法钬激光前列腺剜除术治疗的60例良性前列腺增生患者的临床资料。年龄（73.8±8.0）岁（范围：60~96岁），体重指数（23.2±3.6）kg/m(2)（范围：14.9~31.1 
kg/m(2)），前列腺体积（64.5±36.9）ml（范围：15.5~197.9 ml）。手术由同一名泌尿外科医师实施。（1）以精阜为定位点，其外上方45 
°侧叶内侧缘与精阜连线的中点为突破点，"爆破划桨法"寻找包膜，并在精阜前方将两侧的包膜平面相连。（2）通过"扇面坑道法"保持平面，从5点钟和7点钟方向将中叶和两侧叶分割，将中叶的腺体先剜除并推入膀胱。（3）在经过精阜正上方12点钟方向的向前下倾斜的冠状断面上，半弧形提前离断尿道黏膜，在精阜上方汇合并向膀胱颈部延伸形成"倒Y"形沟槽，将左右叶完全分割。（4）分别剜除两侧叶，并将膀胱内剜除下来的腺体粉碎吸出。记录患者术前术后国际前列腺症状评分和生活质量评分、手术时间、血红蛋白下降值、留置尿管时间和术后住院时间。用前列腺体积除以剜切时间计算剜切效率，用前列腺体积除以粉碎时间计算粉碎效率。手术前后指标比较采用配对t检验。 
结果： 60例手术均获得成功，其中1例因粉碎设备故障，改行经尿道前列腺电切术取出前列腺组织标本。手术时间（115.2±52.9）min（范围：25~276 
min），剜切效率（0.81±0.35）ml/min（范围：0.17~1.58 
ml/min），粉碎效率（6.60±4.28）ml/min（范围：0.89~17.42 
ml/min），血红蛋白下降（15.9±12.3）g/L（范围：-10~57 g/L），留置尿管时间（5.2±2.9）d（范围：0.8~19.8 
d）；术后住院时间（5.0±1.5）d（范围：1.9~11.9 
d）。患者术后IPSS评分[（10.92±6.98）分比（23.37±7.49）分，t=10.357，P=0.000]和QOL评分[（1.75±1.62）分比（4.53±1.47）分，t=9.373，P=0.000]较术前明显改善。术后并发症包括：4例发热（>38.5 
℃），1例急性附睾炎，1例膀胱黏膜损伤，1例术后活动性出血接受输血治疗。 结论： 
"点线面体"四维法钬激光前列腺剜除术治疗良性前列腺增生较为安全并可获得较满意的临床效果。.

PURPOSE: Combinations of long-acting bronchodilators are recommended to reduce 
the rate of COPD exacerbations. Evidence from the DYNAGITO trial showed that the 
fixed-dose combination of tiotropium + olodaterol reduced the annual rate of 
total exacerbations (P<0.05) compared with tiotropium monotherapy. This study 
aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the fixed-dose combination of 
tiotropium + olodaterol vs tiotropium monotherapy in COPD patients in the French 
setting.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A recently developed COPD patient-level simulation model 
was used to simulate the lifetime effects and costs for 15,000 patients 
receiving either tiotropium + olodaterol or tiotropium monotherapy by applying 
the reduction in annual exacerbation rate as observed in the DYNAGITO trial. The 
model was adapted to the French setting by including French unit costs for 
treatment medication, COPD maintenance treatment, COPD exacerbations (moderate 
or severe), and pneumonia. The main outcomes were the annual (severe) 
exacerbation rate, the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total 
lifetime costs.
RESULTS: The number of QALYs for treatment with tiotropium + olodaterol was 
0.042 higher compared with tiotropium monotherapy. Using a societal perspective, 
tiotropium + olodaterol resulted in a cost increase of +€123 and an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €2,900 per QALY compared with tiotropium 
monotherapy. From a French National Sickness Fund perspective, total lifetime 
costs were reduced by €272 with tiotropium + olodaterol, resulting in tiotropium 
+ olodaterol being the dominant treatment option, that is, more effects with 
less costs. Sensitivity analyses showed that reducing the cost of exacerbations 
by 34% increased the ICER to €15,400, which could still be considered 
cost-effective in the French setting.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with tiotropium + olodaterol resulted in a gain in QALYs 
and savings in costs compared with tiotropium monotherapy using a National 
Sickness Fund perspective in France. From the societal perspective, tiotropium + 
olodaterol was found to be cost-effective with a low cost per QALY.

The romantic relationship refers to the specific relationship in which partners 
are dependent upon each other to obtain satisfactory outcomes and facilitate the 
pursuit of their most important needs and goals. Satisfying romantic 
relationships is a strong predictor of better psychological well-being, better 
physical health, and longer life expectancy. However, romantic relationships are 
not all smooth-sailing and lovers are often confronted with a variety of 
unavoidable issues that constantly challenge the stability of their romantic 
relationships. Dissatisfying romantic relationships are harmful and even 
destructive. Dyads of lovers engage in a variety of efforts to protect and 
maintain their romantic relationships based on qualitative research methods 
including theories- and psychological consultation-based approaches. 
Unfortunately, those existing approaches do not seem to effectively improve 
romantic relationships. Thus, it is necessary to seek an efficient approach 
regulating dyads of lovers in romantic relationships simultaneously. 
Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) with advantages over 
existing approaches satisfies this purpose. We discuss the practicability of 
tACS in detail, as well as why and how tACS can be utilized to improve romantic 
relationships. In summary, this review firstly introduced the concept of 
romantic relationship and the necessity of enhancing it. Then, it discussed 
methods to improve romantic relationships including some existing approaches. 
This review next discussed the practicability of using tACS to improve romantic 
relationships. Finally, it shone a spotlight on potential future directions for 
researches aiming to improve romantic relationships.

BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery is a choice for treatment in morbidly obese 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM type 2) who have inadequate diabetes 
control with only medical treatment. However, bariatric surgery requires highly 
sophisticated equipment, and thus the cost of surgery seems to be very high 
following the procedure compared with the cost of conventional diabetes care. 
This raises the question of whether bariatric surgery is cost-effective for 
morbidly obese people with diabetes in Thailand.
OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness evaluation of bariatric surgery 
compared with ordinary treatment for diabetes control in morbidly obese DM type 
2 patients in Thailand.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness study was conducted, using a combination of decision 
tree and Markov model in analysis. Treatment outcomes and healthcare costs were 
incurred by data from literature review and retrospective cohort in King 
Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from September 2009 to March 2016 for the 
conventional and bariatric surgery group, respectively. One-way sensitivity was 
used for analysis of the robustness of the model. Cost-effectiveness was 
assessed by calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Monetary 
benefits at a threshold of 150,000 to 200,000 Thai baht (THB) per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) based on the Thailand gross domestic products 
(GDP) value was regarded as cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery.
RESULTS: Bariatric surgery significantly improves the clinical outcome including 
long-term diabetes remission rate, hemoglobin A1C, and body mass index (BMI). 
The incremental cost per QALY of bariatric surgery compared with the medication 
control is 26,907.76 THB/QALY which can consider bariatric surgery as a 
cost-effective option.

BACKGROUND: An aging population combined with an increased colorectal cancer 
(CRC) incidence in the older population will increase its prevalence in the 
elderly, questioning how many years of life are lost (YLLs) in these patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 32,568 Dutch CRC patients ≥ 80 years were used 
to estimate the number of YLLs after diagnosis, using a reference age-, sex- and 
year-of-onset-matched cohort derived from national life tables. YLLs were 
additionally adjusted by comorbidities. Number needed to treat (NNT) was used as 
measure of surgical effect size.
RESULTS: Surgery was applied in 74.9% of patients leading to 1.3 YLLs, being 
superior in 86.1% of cases with respect to alternative therapies (YLLs 
4.8 years) and resulting in a number of two patients needed to operate to 
achieve one positive outcome. YLLs and NNTs depended on CRC stage, patient' age 
and comorbidities. For Stage I-II patients in the best clinical conditions 
(80-85 years without comorbidities), YLLs increased up to 4.1 years after 
surgery and up to 8.8 years without surgery (NNT 3). For Stage III patients, the 
NNT of surgery varied between 2 when they were in the best clinical conditions 
and 4 when they were older with high comorbidities. In Stage IV patients, the 
NNT ranged between 6 and 31.
CONCLUSIONS: YLLs represents a novel approach to evaluate CRC prognosis. Stage 
I-III surgical patients can have a life expectancy similar to that of general 
population, being the NNT of surgery reasonably small compared with 
alternatives. Personalized comorbidity data are needed to confirm present 
findings.

The objective of this review is to provide an update on prognostication in 
patients with advanced cancer and to discuss future directions for research in 
this field. Accurate prognostication of survival for patients with advanced 
cancer is vital, as patient life expectancy informs many important personal and 
clinical decisions. The most common prognostic approach is clinician prediction 
of survival (CPS) using temporal, surprise, or probabilistic questions. The 
surprise and probabilistic questions may be more accurate than the temporal 
approach, partly by limiting the time frame of prediction. Prognostic models 
such as the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), Palliative Performance Scale (PPS), 
Palliative Prognostic Score (PaP), Palliative Prognostic Index (PPI), or 
Prognosis in Palliative Care Study (PiPS) predictor model may augment CPS. 
However, care must be taken to select the appropriate tool since prognostic 
accuracy varies by patient population, setting, and time frame of prediction. In 
addition to life expectancy, patients and caregivers often desire that expected 
treatment outcomes and bodily changes be communicated to them in a sensible 
manner at an appropriate time. We propose the following 10 major themes for 
future prognostication research: (1) enhancing prognostic accuracy, (2) 
improving reliability and reproducibility of prognosis, (3) identifying the 
appropriate prognostic tool for a given setting, (4) predicting the risks and 
benefits of cancer therapies, (5) predicting survival for pediatric populations, 
(6) translating prognostic knowledge into practice, (7) understanding the impact 
of prognostic uncertainty, (8) communicating prognosis, (9) clarifying outcomes 
associated with delivery of prognostic information, and (10) standardizing 
prognostic terminology.

Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has become the pandemic of the 
new century. About 36.9 million people are living with HIV worldwide. The 
introduction of antiretroviral therapy in 1996 has dramatically changed the 
global landscape of HIV care, resulting in significantly improved survival and 
changing HIV to a chronic disease. With near-normal life expectancy, 
contemporary cardiac care faces multiple challenges of cardiovascular diseases, 
disorders specific to HIV/AIDS, and those related to aging and higher prevalence 
of traditional risk factors. Non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases are major 
components of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in HIV/AIDS. Non-invasive 
cardiac imaging plays a pivotal role in the management of these diseases. This 
review summarizes the non-ischemic presentation of the HIV cardiovascular 
spectrum focusing on the role of cardiac imaging in the management of these 
disorders.

BACKGROUND: The inclusion of future medical costs in cost-effectiveness analyses 
remains a controversial issue. The impact of capturing future medical costs is 
likely to be particularly important in patients with cancer where costly 
lifelong medical care is necessary. The lack of clear, definitive 
pharmacoeconomic guidelines can limit comparability and has implications for 
decision making.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the impact of incorporating 
future medical costs through an applied example using original data from a 
clinical study evaluating the cost effectiveness of a sepsis intervention in 
cancer patients.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was used to capture quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and lifetime costs of cancer patients from an Australian 
healthcare system perspective over a lifetime horizon. The evaluation considered 
three scenarios: (1) intervention-related costs (no future medical cost), (2) 
lifetime cancer costs and (3) all future healthcare costs. Inputs to the model 
included patient-level data from the clinical study, relative risk of death due 
to sepsis, cancer mortality and future medical costs sourced from published 
literature. All costs are expressed in 2017 Australian dollars and discounted at 
5%. To further assess the impact of future costs on cancer heterogeneity, 
variation in survival and lifetime costs between cancer types and the 
implications for cost-effectiveness analysis were explored.
RESULTS: The inclusion of future medical costs increased incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) resulting in a shift from the intervention 
being a dominant strategy (cheaper and more effective) to an ICER of $7526/QALY. 
Across different cancer types, longer life expectancies did not necessarily 
result in greater lifetime healthcare costs. Incremental costs differed across 
cancers depending on the respective costs of managing cancer and survivorship, 
thus resulting in variations in ICERs.
CONCLUSIONS: There is scope for including costs beyond intervention costs in 
economic evaluations. The inclusion of future medical costs can result in 
markedly different cost-effectiveness results, leading to higher ICERs in a 
cancer population, with possible implications for funding decisions.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of frequently used monitoring 
strategies for vestibular schwannoma (VS).
DESIGN: A state transition model was developed to compare six monitoring 
strategies for patients with VS: lifelong annual monitoring; annual monitoring 
for the first 10 years after diagnosis; scanning at 1-5, 7, 9, 12, 15 years 
after diagnosis and subsequently every 5 years; a personalised monitoring 
strategy for small and large tumours; scanning at 1, 2 and 5 years after 
diagnosis and no monitoring. Input data were derived from literature and expert 
opinion. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and healthcare costs of each 
strategy were modelled over lifetime. Net monetary benefits (NMBs) were 
calculated to determine which strategy provided most value for money. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to address uncertainty.
RESULTS: Omitting monitoring is least effective with 18.23 (95% CI 16.84-19.37) 
QALYs per patient, and lifelong annual monitoring is most effective with 18.66 
(95% CI 17.42-19.65) QALYs. Corresponding costs were €6526 (95% CI 5923-7058) 
and €9429 (95% CI 9197-9643) per patient, respectively. Lifelong annual 
monitoring provided the best value with a NMB of €363 765 (339 040-383 697), but 
the overall probability of being most cost-effective compared to the other 
strategies was still only 23%. Sensitivity analysis shows that there is large 
uncertainty in the effectiveness of all strategies, with largely overlapping 95% 
confidence intervals for all strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the largely overlapping 95% confidence intervals of all 
monitoring strategies for VS, it is unclear which monitoring strategy provides 
most value for money at this moment.

IMPORTANCE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the top cause of death in 
China. To our knowledge, no consistent and comparable assessments of CVD burden 
have been produced at subnational levels, and little is understood about the 
spatial patterns and temporal trends of CVD in China.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the national and province-level burden of CVD from 1990 
to 2016 in China.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Following the methodology framework and 
analytical strategies used in the 2016 Global Burden of Disease study, the 
mortality, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of CVD in the 
Chinese population were examined by age, sex, and year and according to 10 
subcategories. Estimates were produced for all province-level administrative 
units of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macao.
EXPOSURES: Residence in China.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mortality, prevalence, and DALYs of CVD.
RESULTS: The annual number of deaths owing to CVD increased from 2.51 million to 
3.97 million between 1990 and 2016; the age-standardized mortality rate fell by 
28.7%, from 431.6 per 100 000 persons in 1990 to 307.9 per 100 000 in 2016. 
Prevalent cases of CVD doubled since 1990, reaching nearly 94 million in 2016. 
The age-standardized prevalence rate of CVD overall increased significantly from 
1990 to 2016 by 14.7%, as did rates for ischemic heart disease (19.1%), ischemic 
stroke (36.6%), cardiomyopathy and myocarditis (23.1%), and endocarditis 
(26.7%). Substantial reduction in the CVD burden, as measured by 
age-standardized DALY rate, was observed from 1990 to 2016 nationally, with a 
greater reduction in women (43.7%) than men (24.7%). There were marked 
differences in the spatial patterns of mortality, prevalence, and DALYs of CVD 
overall as well as its main subcategories, including ischemic heart disease, 
hemorrhagic stroke, and ischemic stroke. The CVD burden appeared to be lower in 
coastal provinces with higher economic development. The between-province gap in 
relative burden of CVD increased from 1990 to 2016, with faster decline in 
economically developed provinces.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Substantial discrepancies in the total CVD burden and 
burdens of CVD subcategories have persisted between provinces in China despite a 
relative decrease in the CVD burden. Geographically targeted considerations are 
needed to tailor future strategies to enhance CVD health throughout China and in 
specific provinces.

BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity has become a major global epidemic that causes 
substantial social and health burdens worldwide. The effectiveness of childhood 
obesity control and prevention depends largely on understanding the issue, 
including its current development and associated factors in a contextualized 
perspective.
OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to gauge this kind of understanding.
METHODS: We systematically searched the Web of Science database for studies 
concerning child obesity published up to 2017 and analyzed the volume of 
publications, growth rates, impact scores, collaborations, authors, 
affiliations, and journals. A total of 57,444 research papers were included.
RESULTS: The three subject categories with the highest number of papers (over 
3,000) were (1) nutrition and dietetics, (2) pediatrics, and (3) public, 
environmental, and occupational health. We found a dramatic increase in the 
amount of scientific literature on childhood obesity in the past one or two 
decades, led by scholars from the USA - ranking at the top regarding the total 
number of papers (23,965 papers; 30.8%) and total number of citations (859,793 
citations) - and multiple Western countries where the obesity epidemic is 
prevalent.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the need for improving international and 
local research capacities and collaboration to accelerate knowledge production 
and translation into contextualized and effective childhood obesity prevention.

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the risk of adverse events, 
life expectancy, and event-free life expectancy after the Ross procedure in 
adults.
METHODS: We searched databases for reports evaluating the Ross procedure in 
patients aged more than or equal to 16 years of age. A microsimulation model was 
used to evaluate age- and gender-specific life expectancy for patients 
undergoing the Ross procedure.
RESULTS: Data were pooled from 63 articles totaling 19 155 patients from 20 
countries. Perioperative mortality was 2.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.9-3.1; N = 9978). We found a mortality risk of 5.9% (95% CI: 4.8-7.2) at a 
mean follow-up of 7.2 years (N = 7573). The rate of perioperative clinically 
significant bleeding was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.1-3.0); re-exploration for bleeding 
4.6% (95% CI: 3.1-6.3); postoperative clinically significant bleeding from 30 
days until a mean of 7.1 years was 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.0). At a mean of 6.9 
years of follow-up, reintervention rate of any operated valve was 7.9% (95% CI: 
5.7-10.3). The risk of valve thrombosis was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.5) at 7.6 years; 
peripheral embolism 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.4) at 6.4 years; stroke 0.9% (95% CI: 
0.7-1.2) at 6.5 years; and endocarditis 2.1% (95% CI: 1.6-2.6) at 8.0 years. 
Microsimulation reported a 40-year-old undergoing the Ross procedure to have a 
life expectancy of 35.4 years and event-free life expectancy of 26.6 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Ross procedure in nonelderly adults is associated with low 
mortality and low risk of adverse events both at short- and long-term follow-up. 
The surgical community must prioritize a large, expertize-based randomized 
controlled trial to definitively address the risks and benefits of the Ross 
procedure compared to conventional aortic valve replacement.

Processed ready-to-cook broiler carcasses were obtained from a commercial 
poultry processing plant on three separate occasions. The birds were identified 
at the plant as being either normal or as exhibiting the appearance and feel of 
birds exhibiting the phenomena collectively termed as "oily bird syndrome" 
(OBS). The carcasses were packed in ice, transported to the Food Science 
Department, University of Georgia, held on ice for 24 h and individually bagged 
and stored under retail conditions at 2°C. At 2, 8, 14 and 20 days postmortem, 
the birds were examined microbiologically for total plate counts and observed 
for evidence of spoilage. No consistent trends could be ascertained to indicate 
that birds exhibiting OBS would have higher total bacterial numbers or shorter 
shelf-life. Thus, it would appear that birds exhibiting OBS would pose no 
problems regarding initial microbial loads, microbial growth rates or reduced 
fresh shelf-life as compared to carcasses not exhibiting OBS.

In both beef extract medium and on the surface of rib-eye steaks, potassium 
sorbate inhibited growth of psychrotrophic beef-spoilage bacteria by prolonging 
the lag phase of growth without affecting rate of growth. As a result, steak 
retail shelf life was extended by 2 days following a 10% potassium sorbate dip.
