Objective: Based on the data of Global Burden of Disease 2019 data, to analyze 
the past, current, and future burden of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
in China and compare with the international status. Methods: The total number of 
DALYs, age-standardized DALY rate, and the composition of different subgroups 
were extracted and described to analyze the time trend in 2000-2019 and the 
current situation in 2019 for Chinese female breast cancer. The burden of DALYs 
in 2050 was predicted by Joinpoint using average annual percent change (AAPC). 
Results: In 2000-2019, the ranking of DALYs caused by female breast cancer in 
China rose from the fourth to the second in all female cancers. The total DALYs 
increased by 48.4%, of which the years lived with disability increased from 4.8% 
to 8.8%. The age-standardized DALY rate only slightly decreased (AAPC=-0.3%; 
which increased during 2016-2019, AAPC=1.6%). In 2019, the age-standardized DALY 
rate for breast cancer in China was 278.0/100 000. The DALYs were 2.88 million 
(accounting for 14.2% of the global burden and 12.1% of all female cancers 
burden in China), 26.5% of which attributed known risk factors (overweight and 
obesity were the largest: 0.34 million DALYs, but some common breast cancer risk 
factors were not available on the platform, such as menstruation and fertility). 
In 2050, the prediction suggests that the total DALYs caused by female breast 
cancer in China will reach 3.80 million person-years-5.16 million person-years, 
increasing 32.1%-79.4% over 2019. From 2000 to 2019, the peak age of DALYs and 
DALY rate became older, and the DALYs among females aged 65 years and above 
increased faster than those younger than 65 years (AAPC were 4.8% and 1.3%, 
respectively). In 2019, females aged 45-74 (the starting age recommended by 
local guidelines for breast cancer screening) contributed 74.3% of the total 
DALYs. Conclusions: Over the past 20 years, the age-standardized DALY rate for 
breast cancer in female populations in China has not changed obviously. Without 
the continuous expansion of effective intervention and population aging, the 
burden of DALYs for female breast cancer in China will increase. DALYs for 
breast cancer attributed leading risk factors were still limited.

基于全球疾病负担项目2019年最新开放数据，分析我国女性人群因乳腺癌所致伤残调整寿命年（DALY）负担的现况、既往与未来并行国际比较。 方法： 
摘录描述DALY总数、世界标化率值及不同亚组构成，分析我国女性乳腺癌2000-2019年趋势、2019年现况与国际现况比较；利用Joinpoint行2050年预测，主要指标为平均年度变化百分比（AAPC）。 
结果： 
2000-2019年，我国女性乳腺癌所致的DALY数在所有女性癌种中的顺位由第四位升至第二位，DALY总数增长了48.4%，其中伤残损失寿命年的占比从4.8%增至8.8%；标化DALY率仅有略微下降（AAPC=-0.3%，其中2016-2019年转为上升，AAPC=1.6%）。2019年，我国女性乳腺癌所致标化DALY率为278.0/10万，DALY数为287.7万人年（占全球乳腺癌的14.2%，占我国女性全部癌种负担的12.1%），其中26.5%有明确归因（以超重与肥胖最多，为33.6万人年；月经、生育等常见乳腺癌影响因素相关数据在平台未见）；预测提示，2050年，我国女性乳腺癌所致DALY总数将达380.0万人年~516.2万人年，较2019年增加32.1%~79.4%。年龄分布方面，2000-2019年，年龄别DALY数和DALY率峰值均后移，年龄≥65岁者的DALY数较<65岁者增长更快（AAPC分别为4.8%和1.3%）；2019年的45~74岁（中国女性乳腺癌筛查与早诊早治指南推荐筛查起始年龄）女性贡献了全部DALY负担的74.3%。 
结论： 
近20年我国女性乳腺癌所致DALY率基本未变，近年甚至有增加；若无持续扩大的有效干预，伴随人口老龄化的放大作用，乳腺癌所致DALY在我国女性人群的负担将会加重。乳腺癌主要危险因素相关DALY负担归因数据报道仍有限。.

INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer screening improved outcomes for patients 
diagnosed between the age of 45-75. Present life expectancy is beyond this 
limit, yet there are no guidelines for these ages. We aim to identify outcomes 
after screening and intervention in patients ≥75 years and correlate with 
frailty.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records between 2011 and 2019 were queried. Patients ≥75 
screened and treated for colorectal cancer were included. Patient demographics, 
perioperative mortality, age at last colonoscopy and frailty score were 
calculated. A Modified Frailty Index from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging 
Frailty Index was used. A score of 1 to 11 was calculated based on patient 
comorbidities. The MFI was assigned from 0 to 11: 0 signified absence of frailty 
and 11 indicated maximum frailty.
RESULTS: Of 179 patients were identified, 46.3% males. 171(95%) had elective and 
8 (5%) had emergent surgery. The average age was 81.8 years. All colonoscopies 
were performed for symptoms. A modified frailty index was retrospectively 
calculated; 75% of patients scored between 0 and 2 and 1% scored >6.
CONCLUSION: Older patients who underwent colonoscopy and surgery for symptomatic 
colon cancer had a low mortality, 2%. The average age was 6.8 years older than 
the recommended cutoff for colonoscopy screening. Most patients scored 0 to 2 on 
the modified frailty index, suggesting that not only are older patients more fit 
than previously thought, but also able to tolerate colorectal interventions more 
liberally. Utilizing frailty indices to identify screening patterns beyond 75 
years of age might prove beneficial for this patient population. Further studies 
are recommended.

We present the update of the recommendations of the French society for radiation 
oncology on radiation therapy for the management of brain metastases. It has 
evolved in recent years and has become more complex. As the life expectancy of 
patients has increased and retreatments have become more frequent, side effects 
must be absolutely avoided. Cognitive side effects must in particular be 
prevented, and the most modern radiation therapy techniques must be used 
systematically. New prognostic classifications specific to the primary tumour of 
patients, advances in imaging and radiation therapy technology and new systemic 
therapeutic strategies, are making treatment more relevant. Stereotactic 
radiation therapy has supplanted whole-brain radiation therapy both for patients 
with metastases in place and for those who underwent surgery. Hippocampus 
protection is possible with intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Its relevance 
in terms of cognitive functioning should be more clearly demonstrated but the 
requirement for its use is constantly increasing. New targeted cancer treatment 
therapies based on the nature of the primitive have complicated the notion of 
the place and timing of radiation therapy and the discussion during 
multidisciplinary care meeting to indicate the best sequences is becoming a 
challenging issue as data on the interaction between treatments remain to be 
documented. In the end, although aimed at patients in the palliative phase, the 
management of brain metastases is one of the locations for which technical 
reflection is the most challenging and treatment become increasingly 
personalized.

Diversity scaling (changes) of human gut microbiome is important because it 
measures the inter-individual heterogeneity of diversity and other important 
parameters of population-level diversity. Understanding the heterogeneity of 
microbial diversity can be used as a reference for the personalized medicine of 
microbiome-associated diseases. Similar to diversity per se, diversity scaling 
may also be influenced by host factors, especially lifestyles and ethnicities. 
Nevertheless, this important topic regarding Chinese populations has not been 
addressed, to our best knowledge. Here, we fill the gap by applying a recent 
extension to the classic species-area relationship (SAR), i.e., diversity-area 
relationship (DAR), to reanalyze a large dataset of Chinese gut microbiomes 
covering the seven biggest Chinese ethnic groups (covering > 95% Chinese) living 
rural and urban lifestyles. Four DAR profiles were constructed to investigate 
the diversity scaling, diversity overlap, potential maximal diversity, and the 
ratio of local to global diversity of Chinese gut microbiomes. We discovered the 
following: (i) The diversity scaling parameters (z) at various taxon levels are 
little affected by either ethnicity or lifestyles, as exhibited by less than 
0.5% differences in pairwise comparisons. (ii) The maximal accrual diversity 
(potential diversity) exhibited difference in only about 5% of pairwise 
comparisons, and all of the differences occurred in ethnicity comparisons (i.e., 
lifestyles had no effects). (iii) Ethnicity seems to have stronger effects than 
lifestyles across all taxon levels, and this may reflect the reality that China 
has been experiencing rapid urbanization in the last few decades, while the 
ethnic-related genetic background may change relatively little during the same 
period.

Objective: To assess the long-term (50 years) cost-effectiveness of the 
self-efficacy-focused structured education program (SSEP) as opposed to routine 
education among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in mainland China 
from a healthcare service perspective. Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis 
method was used. The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (version 9.0) was adopted to 
estimate the outcomes. The baseline cohort characteristics, variations of 
physiological parameters, costs of intervention and other treatments, and 
management-related diabetes were derived from a randomized controlled trial. 
Moreover, the complications costs and utilities were extracted from published 
sources. Furthermore, the univariate sensitivity analysis and the probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis were conducted. Results: As compared with the control 
group, the life expectancy and quality-adjusted life-year in the intervention 
group were increased. Besides, the intervention group achieved lower cumulative 
incidences of complications and saved more direct medical costs compared with 
the control group. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the SSEP had 100% 
probability to be cost-effective. Conclusion: The SSEP is recognized as a highly 
cost-effective option for managing patients with T2DM, which are projected to 
both improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs.

The impact of multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions on controlling COVID-19 
outbreak without lockdown in Hong Kong: A modelling study.

Kong SAR, China.

BACKGROUND: The 'third wave' of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, China was suppressed by 
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Although social distancing regulations 
were quickly strengthened, the outbreak continued to grow, causing increasing 
delays in tracing and testing. Further regulations were introduced, plus 
'targeted testing' services for at-risk groups. Estimating the impact of 
individual NPIs could provide lessons about how outbreaks can be controlled 
without radical lockdown. However, the changing delays in confirmation time 
challenge current modelling methods. We used a novel approach aimed at 
disentangling and quantifying the effects of individual interventions.
METHODS: We incorporated the causes of delays in tracing and testing (i.e. 
load-efficiency relationship) and the consequences from such delays (i.e. the 
proportion of un-traced cases and the proportion of traced-cases with 
confirmation delay) into a deterministic transmission model, which was fitted to 
the daily number of cases with and without an epi‑link (an indication of being 
contact-traced). The effect of each NPI was then calculated.
FINDINGS: The model estimated that after earlier relaxation of regulations, Re 
rose from 0.7 to 3.2. Restoration of social distancing to the previous state 
only reduced Re to 1.3, because of increased delay in confirmation caused by 
load on the contact-tracing system. However, Re decreased by 20.3% after the 
introduction of targeted testing and by 17.5% after extension of face-mask 
rules, reducing Re to 0.9 and suppressing the outbreak. The output of the model 
without incorporation of delay failed to capture important features of 
transmission and Re.
INTERPRETATION: Changing delay in confirmation has a significant impact on 
disease transmission and estimation of transmissibility. This leads to a clear 
recommendation that delay should be monitored and mitigated during outbreaks, 
and that delay dynamics should be incorporated into models to assess the effects 
of NPIs.

The current study aims to determine the potential benefits of calorie 
restriction (CR), one of the most promising paradigms for life span and 
healthspan extension, on cognitive performances in female Wistar rats during 
aging. As a measure of a healthspan, we evaluated the effects of different onset 
and duration of CR on frailty level. Female Wistar rats were exposed to either 
ad libitum (AL) or CR (60% of AL daily intake) food intake during aging. Two 
different CR protocols were used, life-long CR with an early-onset that started 
at the adult stage (6 months) and 3-month-long CR, started at the middle (15 
months) and late-middle (21 months) age, thus defined as a late-onset CR. The 
effects of CR were evaluated using open-field, Y-maze, and novel object 
recognition tests. We broadened 2 tools for frailty assessment currently in use 
for experimental animals, and in alignment with our previous study, we created a 
physical-cognitive frailty tool that combines both physical and cognitive 
performances. Our results clearly showed that CR effects are highly dependent on 
CR duration and onset. While a life-long restriction with an early-onset has 
been proven as protective and beneficial, short-term restriction introduced at 
late age significantly worsens an animal's behavior and frailty. These results 
complement our previous study conducted in males and contribute to the 
understanding of sex differences in a response to CR during aging.

BACKGROUND: The burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Ghana is rising, but 
details on its epidemiology are scarce. We sought to quantify mortality due to 
CVD in two districts in rural Ghana using verbal post-mortem (VPM) data.
METHODS: We conducted a proportional sub-hazards analysis of 10 232 deaths in 
the Kassena-Nankana East and West districts from 2005 to 2012, to determine 
adult mortality attributed to CVD over time. We stratified results by age, 
gender and socio-economic status (SES), and compared CVD mortality among SES and 
gender strata over time. A competing risk model estimated the cumulative effect 
of eliminating CVD from the area.
RESULTS: From 2005 to 2012, CVD mortality more than doubled overall, from 0.51 
deaths for every 1000 person-years in 2005 to 1.08 per 1000 person-years in 
2012. Mortality peaked in 2008 at 1.23 deaths per 1000 person-years. Increases 
were comparable in men (2.0) and women (2.3), but greater among the poorest 
residents (3.3) than the richest (1.3), and among persons aged 55-69 years (2.1) 
than those aged ≥70 years (1.8). By 2012, male and female CVD mortality was 
highest in middle-SES persons. We project that eliminating CVD would increase 
the number of individuals reaching age 73 years from 35% to 40%, adding 
1.6 years of life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of CVD on overall mortality in the Upper East Region is 
substantial and markedly increasing. CVD mortality has especially increased in 
lower-income persons and persons in middle age. Further initiatives for the 
surveillance and control of CVD in these vulnerable populations are needed.

Demographic Studies (INED), Aubervilliers, Île de France, France.

BACKGROUND: Preliminary studies have suggested a link between socio-economic 
characteristics and COVID-19 mortality. Such studies have been carried out on 
particular geographies within the USA or selective data that do not represent 
the complete experience for 2020.
METHODS: We estimated COVID-19 mortality rates, number of years of life lost to 
SARS-CoV-2 and reduction in life expectancy during each of the three pandemic 
waves in 2020 for 3144 US counties grouped into five socio-economic status 
categories, using daily death data from the Johns Hopkins University of Medicine 
and weekly mortality age structure from the Centers for Disease Control.
RESULTS: During March-May 2020, COVID-19 mortality was highest in the most 
socio-economically advantaged quintile of counties and lowest in the two 
most-disadvantaged quintiles. The pattern reversed during June-August and 
widened by September-December, such that COVID-19 mortality rates were 2.58 
times higher in the bottom than in the top quintile of counties. Differences in 
the number of years of life lost followed a similar pattern, ultimately 
resulting in 1.002 (1.000, 1.004) million years in the middle quintile to 1.381 
(1.378, 1.384) million years of life lost in the first (most-disadvantaged) 
quintile during the whole year.
CONCLUSIONS: Diverging trajectories of COVID-19 mortality among the poor and 
affluent counties indicated a progressively higher rate of loss of life among 
socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Accounting for socio-economic 
disparities when allocating resources to control the spread of the infection and 
to reinforce local public health infrastructure would reduce inequities in the 
mortality burden of the disease.

Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) was first implemented as an extension of 
cardiopulmonary bypass technology. The early use of ECLS in patients with acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was discouraging, likely due to limitations 
of technology and understanding of the disease process. However, over the last 
decade, there has been a rapid expansion in ECLS use. This "rebirth" in 2009 was 
largely driven by the need for ECLS during the Influenza A subtype H1N1 pandemic 
and the results of the conventional ventilatory support versus extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation for severe adult respiratory failure (CESAR) trial showing 
improved outcomes in patients with ARDS on ECLS compared to traditional 
management. Along with the increase in overall use of ECLS, there has been an 
increase in the number of patients with lung failure who are on long-term 
support, either awaiting lung recovery or transplantation. Many of these 
patients are awake, participating in physical rehabilitation, and even 
ambulating while supported with ECLS. Given the recent advances in patient care, 
and improvements in ECLS technology, the movement towards home for stable 
patients supported with ECLS may be on the horizon. Patients supported with 
ventricular assist devices (VAD) underwent a similar transition towards home in 
the 1990s, before which they were hospital bound. The road to an ambulatory home 
wearable lung will likely mirror that pathway. This review will give a brief 
overview of the transition of VAD patients out of the hospital, the history of 
ECLS, the current state of ECLS for lung failure, new and upcoming ECLS 
technology, and hurdles on the road home for ECLS patients.

Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) improves the clinical outcomes in 
patients with cardiovascular diseases. However, few data exist regarding the 
role of early short-term CR in patients undergoing pacemaker (PM) implantation. 
We assessed whether short-term CR following PM implantation was sufficient to 
improve both physical function and quality of life (QOL). A total of 27 patients 
with a 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) of less than 85% of the predicted value 
on the day following PM implantation were randomly assigned to either the CR 
group (n = 12, 44.4%) or the non-CR group (n = 15, 55.6%). The CR group involved 
individualized exercise-based training with moderate intensity for 4 weeks after 
PM implantation. Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), 6MWD, muscle strength, 
and Short Form (SF)-36 were assessed at baseline and at the 4-week follow-up. 
After a mean follow-up period of 38.3 days, both groups showed significantly 
improved 6MWD. Peak oxygen uptake improved in both groups on CPET, but the 
difference was not statistically significant. Knee extension power and handgrip 
strength were similar in both groups. Regarding QOL, only the CR group showed 
improved SF-36 scores in the items of vitality and mental health. There was no 
difference in any subscale in the non-CR group. Neither lead dislodgement nor 
significant changes in PM parameters were observed in any patient. Early 
short-term CR following PM implantation was associated with improved 
psychological subscales and can be safely performed without increasing the risk 
of procedure-related complications.

OBJECTIVES: The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established 
Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial showed reduced renal and 
cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and diabetic 
kidney disease (DKD) treated with canagliflozin 100 mg added to Standard of Care 
(SoC) versus SoC alone. This led to an extension of the canagliflozin 100 mg 
European marketing authorisation, making canagliflozin the first pharmacological 
therapy to receive authorisation for the treatment of DKD since the RENAAL and 
IDNT trials more than 20 years ago. Given the importance of cost-effectiveness 
analyses in health care, this study aimed to leverage the CREDENCE trial 
outcomes to estimate the cost-effectiveness of canagliflozin 100 mg from the 
perspective of the Belgian healthcare system.
METHODS: A microsimulation model (CREDENCE Economic Model of DKD), developed 
using patient-level CREDENCE trial data, was leveraged to model the progression 
of DKD and CV outcomes, associated costs, and life quality. Unit costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were sourced from the literature. The time 
horizon was 10 years and sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Canagliflozin was associated with sizable gains in life-years and QALYs 
over 10 years, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio cost offsets 
associated with reductions in CV and renal complications resulted in overall net 
cost savings from the perspective of the Belgian healthcare system.
CONCLUSION: Model-based results suggest that adding canagliflozin 100 mg to SoC 
can improve outcomes for patients with DKD while reducing overall net costs for 
the Belgian healthcare system.

Word learning difficulties are often found in children with Developmental 
Language Disorder (DLD). Lexical patterns of difficulties appear to be well 
described in the context of DLD but very little research focuses on their 
underlying causes. Word learning is known to be an inference-based process, 
constrained by categorization, which helps the extension of new words to 
unfamiliar referents and situations. These processes appear integrated in 
Bayesian models of cognition, which supposes that learning relies on an 
inductive inference process that recruits prior knowledge and principles of 
statistical learning (detection of regularities). Taken together, these 
mechanisms remain underexplored in DLD. Our study aims to define whether 
children with DLD can draw inductive inferences in a word learning context using 
categorization. Twenty children with DLD (between 6;0 and 12;6), and 20 
language-matched and 16 age-matched controls were exposed to a word learning 
task where they were given exemplars of objects associated with pseudo-words. 
The objects belonged to six categories spread across three hierarchical levels. 
For each item, the children chose which one(s), among a set of test objects from 
the same categories, could be labelled the same way (word extension). Results 
showed that school-aged children with DLD could extend new words to broader 
categories as well as their typically developing (TD) peers. Nevertheless, none 
of the DLD or TD children showed a specification of their categorization of 
familiar instances that referred to more restricted instances. Our study 
suggests preserved abilities in using conceptual knowledge in order to learn new 
words, which could be used as a compensative strategy in the context of therapy. 
Further studies are needed to investigate this ability in more complex learning 
contexts.

AIMS: Whether bilateral internal thoracic artery (BITA) grafting benefits 
elderly patients in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains unclear since 
they tend to have a limited life expectancy and severe comorbidities. We aim to 
evaluate the outcomes of BITA vs. single internal thoracic artery (SITA) 
grafting in elderly patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A meta-analysis was performed by database searching until 
May 2021. Studies comparing BITA and SITA grafting among elderly patients were 
included. One randomized controlled trial, nine propensity score matching, and 
six unmatched studies were identified, with a total of 18 146 patients (7422 
received BITA grafting and 10 724 received SITA grafting). Compared with SITA 
grafting, BITA grafting had a higher risk of deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) 
[odds ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-2.28], and this risk could 
not be significantly reduced by the skeletonization technique. Meanwhile, BITA 
grafting was associated with a higher long-term survival [hazard ratio: 0.83; 
95% CI: 0.77-0.90], except for the octogenarian subgroup. Reconstructed 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed 4-year, 8-year, and 12-year overall 
survival rates of 85.5%, 66.7%, and 45.3%, respectively, in the BITA group and 
79.3%, 58.6%, and 34.9%, respectively, in the SITA group. No significant 
difference was observed in early mortality, perioperative myocardial infarction, 
perioperative cerebral vascular accidents, or re-exploration for bleeding.
CONCLUSION: Compared with SITA grafting, BITA grafting could provide a long-term 
survival benefit for elderly patients, although this benefit remained uncertain 
in octogenarians. Meanwhile, elderly patients who received BITA were associated 
with a higher risk of DSWI and such a risk could not be eliminated by the 
skeletonization technique.

BACKGROUND: Optimal treatment of bicondylar plateau fractures is still a matter 
of debate. Accelerometer-measured physical activity levels may help us to obtain 
objective information regarding the quality of life of patients. The aim of this 
study was to compare the physical activity levels, objective and subjective 
functional results and stabilities of fixations of patients with treated 
bicondylar plateau fractures.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study of 23 patients, accelerometer-measured 
physical activity levels, daily energy consumption and measurements of knee 
joint range of motion (ROM) and muscle strength were measured. While Knee Injury 
and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was used as a patient-reported outcome 
measurement, Rasmussen Radiological Score was used for radiological evaluation.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of 
physical activity levels and daily energy consumption (P = 0.667). While Total 
KOOS, Symptom and Stiffness and Sports Activities scores were higher in patients 
with a single plate (P = 0.034, P = 0.003 and P = 0.014, respectively), knee 
flexion and extension ROM and flexor and extensor muscle strength were similar 
between groups (P = 0.405, P = 0.095, P = 0.982 and P = 0.988, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: While patient-reported outcome measurements were better with single 
plating, there was no difference between the groups in terms of physical 
activity levels, ROM, muscle strength and radiological results. Although it 
should be kept in mind that the choice of the primary surgeon, the condition of 
the soft tissue and the fracture geometry are also effective in the 
decision-making process, single plating seems to be a valid surgical option in 
the treatment of bicondylar plateau fractures.

Cancer has been identified as a leading cause of death worldwide, and the 
increasing number of cancer cases threatens to shorten the average life 
expectancy of people. Recently, we reported a 3-azido-3-deoxythymidine 
(AZT)-based amphipathic small molecule, ADG-2e that revealed a notable potency 
against tumor metastasis. To evaluate the anticancer potential of ADG-2e, we 
assessed its anticancer potency in vitro and in vivo. Anticancer screening of 
ADG-2e against cervical cancer cells, HeLa CCL2, and BT549 mammary gland ductal 
carcinoma showed significant inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. 
Furthermore, mechanistic investigations revealed that cancer cell death 
presumably proceeded through an oncosis mechanistic pathway because ADG-2e 
treated cells showed severe damage on the plasma membrane, a loss of membrane 
integrity, and leakage of α-tubulin and β-actin. Finally, evaluation of the 
antitumorigenic potential of ADG-2e in mouse xenograft models revealed that this 
compound potentially inhibits cancer cell proliferation. Collectively, these 
findings suggest that ADG-2e can evolve as an anticancer agent, which may 
represent a model for nucleoside-based small molecule anticancer drug discovery.

The aim of a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was to 
assess the effect of daily supplementation with a natural extract of Spinacia 
oleracea L. (4 × 500 mg capsules/day; total 2 g per day) combined with a 
moderate-intensity training program (1 h session/3 times a week) on skeletal 
muscle fitness in adults over 50 years of age. Muscle strength assessed by 
isokinetic and isometric dynamometry improved significantly in the experimental 
(n = 23) and the placebo (n = 22) groups, but the magnitude of improvement was 
higher in the experimental group, with between-group differences in almost all 
variables, including isokinetic at 60° s-1 in knee extension, peak torque (p < 
0.007); total work per repetition maximum (p < 0.009); isokinetic at 180°s-1 in 
knee extension, peak torque (p < 0.002); total work (p < 0.007); total work per 
repetition maximum (p < 0.005); average power (p < 0.027); isometric in knee 
extension, peak torque (p < 0.005); and average peak torque (p < 0.002). Similar 
findings were observed for muscle quality. Changes in quality of life (SF-36) 
were not found, except for improvements in the role physical (p < 0.023) and 
role emotional (p < 0.001) domains, likely as a result of the physical training 
sessions. A nutritional survey did not revealed changes in dietary habits. No 
adverse events were recorded. In subjects over 50 years of age, 
moderate-intensity strength training combined with daily supplementation for 12 
weeks with a natural extract of Spinacia oleracea L. improved muscle-related 
variables and muscle quality. Maintaining muscle health is a key component of 
healthy aging.

The population in the Western Pacific region is aging rapidly. Nutritional 
deficiency is prevalent in older adults; however, information regarding 
nutritional deficiency in this population is scarce. Using the 2019 Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) results, the age-standardized disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) and years of healthy life lost due to disability (YLDs) from 
nutritional deficiency were estimated between 1990 and 2019 for this population. 
Average annual percentage change (AAPC) was used to assess temporal trends, and 
linear mixed-effects models were used to examine socioeconomic and sex 
inequalities. From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized DALYs of nutritional 
deficiency in this population decreased from 697.95 to 290.95 per 100,000, and 
their age-standardized YLDs decreased from 459.03 to 195.65 per 100,000, with 
the greatest declines seen in South Korea (AAPCs < -5.0). Tonga had the least 
decline in DALYs (AAPC = -0.8), whereas Fiji experienced an increase in YLDs 
(AAPC = 0.1). Being female and having a lower sociodemographic index score was 
significantly associated with higher age-standardized DALYs and YLDs. The 
magnitude and temporal trends of the nutritional deficiency burden among older 
adults varied across countries and sex in the region, indicating that health 
policies on nutritional deficiency among older adults must be crafted to local 
conditions.

BACKGROUND: We evaluated how plasma proteomic signatures in patients with 
suspected COVID-19 can unravel the pathophysiology, and determine kinetics and 
clinical outcome of the infection.
METHODS: Plasma samples from patients presenting to the emergency department 
(ED) with symptoms of COVID-19 were stratified into: (1) patients with suspected 
COVID-19 that was not confirmed (n = 44); (2) non-hospitalized patients with 
confirmed COVID-19 (n = 44); (3) hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 
(n = 53) with variable outcome; and (4) patients presenting to the ED with minor 
diseases unrelated to SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 20). Besides standard of care 
diagnostics, 177 circulating proteins related to inflammation and cardiovascular 
disease were analyzed using proximity extension assay (PEA, Olink) technology.
RESULTS: Comparative proteome analysis revealed 14 distinct proteins as highly 
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 12 proteins with subsequent 
hospitalization (p < 0.001). ADM, IL-6, MCP-3, TRAIL-R2, and PD-L1 were each 
predictive for death (AUROC curve 0.80-0.87). The consistent increase of these 
markers, from hospital admission to intensive care and fatality, supported the 
concept that these proteins are of major clinical relevance.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified distinct plasma proteins linked to the presence and 
course of COVID-19. These plasma proteomic findings may translate to a protein 
fingerprint, helping to assist clinical management decisions.

The epidemiological scenario of COVID-19, social distancing, and business 
restrictions has increased food preparation and consumption at home. Food 
mishandling at home can significantly raise the risk of foodborne diseases. This 
study investigates food-mishandling behavior predictors by applying the extended 
theory of planned behavior (TPB), with the addition of knowledge and risk 
perception, to households during the COVID-19 pandemic. One thousand and 
sixty-eight consumers (n = 1068) in Brazil participated in this study before the 
COVID-19 vaccination period. Data were collected using an online questionnaire 
with 40 questions and different anchors; they were analyzed using structural 
equation modeling. The following original TPB factors positively affected the 
intention to implement safe food-handling practices: attitude (p < 0.001), 
perceived behavioral control (p < 0.001), and subjective norms (p < 0.001). More 
robust effects of attitude and perceived behavioral control on intention were 
also observed. Although food-safety knowledge did not affect intention 
(p = 0.30), it positively affected the other TPB factors. Perceived risk 
positively affected all TPB factors. The results of this study support the 
usefulness of TPB and its extension, providing evidence that public-health 
crises can contribute to changes in food-safety-related consumer behavior.
