differences in the level of road safety in regions, estimated on the basis of 
the RFR and the available data in Eurostat databases. This in turn allows for 
indicating regions in which activities to improve road safety should have the 
highest priority. The model shows a large spatial diversity of factors affecting 
the RFR, which indicates the need to take different actions to improve road 
safety depending on the region. The results suggest that the GWR model can be 
useful for predicting and more efficient management of road safety at the 
regional level in Europe.

BACKGROUND: On Nov 17, 2020, WHO launched a global initiative to accelerate the 
elimination of cervical cancer through the implementation of HPV vaccination, 
cervical cancer screening and treatment for precancer and cancer. China has the 
largest burden of cervical cancer in the world, but only has a national cervical 
cancer screening program in rural areas since 2009. Here, we aimed to evaluate 
the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening in urban 
China, using Shenzhen City as an example.
METHODS: We use an extensively validated platform ('Policy1-Cervix'), calibrated 
to data from Shenzhen city and Guandong Province. We evaluated a range of 
strategies that have previously been implemented as pilot studies in China, or 
recommended as guidelines within China and globally, spanning primary HPV, 
cytology and co-testing strategies. We additionally considered alternate 
triaging methods, age ranges and screening intervals, resulting in 19 algorithms 
in total.
RESULTS: Of the 19 strategies considered, the most effective approach involved 
primary HPV testing. At 3- to 10-yearly intervals, primary HPV testing reduced 
the age-standardized cancer mortality rate by 37-71 %. The most cost-effective 
strategy was 5-yearly primary HPV testing with partial genotyping triage for 
ages 25-65, discharging to 10-yearly screening for low-risk women (ICER = 
US$7191/QALYS using 2018 costs; willingness-to-pay threshold<1xGDP [US$9771]). 
This strategy gave an incidence and mortality reduction of 56 % and 63 %, 
respectively. This remained the most cost-effective strategy under most 
conditions in sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: Primary HPV testing would be cost-effective in Shenzhen and could 
more than halve cervical cancer incidence rates to 6 per 100,000 over the long 
term. In order to achieve rates below 4 per 100,000, the elimination threshold 
set by the World Health Organization, vaccination will likely also be necessary.

Overcoming the transcatheter aortic valve replacement Achilles heel: coronary 
re-access.

Arshi A(1), Yakubov SJ(1), Stiver KL(1), Sanchez CE(1).

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative to surgical 
aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic 
stenosis (AS). Coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in patients with severe 
AS. As the indications for TAVR extend to lower risk patients with longer life 
expectancy and as CAD is a progressive condition, coronary angiography will 
become increasingly common in patients who have had a previous TAVR. Coronary 
artery re-access after TAVR may be challenging but is possible in most cases. 
Commissural alignment of the prosthesis with the native coronary ostia plays an 
important role in successful coronary re-access. Coronary artery obstruction is 
a potentially devastating complication of TAVR, particularly in valve-in-valve 
procedures. In the present keynote lecture, we review techniques used to 
mitigate the risk of coronary obstruction, as well as catheter selection and 
strategies for selective coronary artery engagement for specific transcatheter 
aortic valve (TAV) bioprostheses.

BACKGROUND: With increasing life expectancy, stem cell therapy is receiving 
increasing attention. However, its application is restricted by ethical 
concerns. Hence a need exists for design of safe procedures for stem cell 
procurement. Here, we investigated whether hemovac blood (HVB) is an appropriate 
stem cell source.
METHODS: HVB concentrates (HVBCs) from 20 total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients 
and bone marrow aspirate (BMA) concentrates (BMACs) from 15 patients who 
underwent knee cartilage repair were comparatively evaluated. A bone marrow 
aspiration needle was inserted into the anterior superior iliac spine. 
Aspiration was performed using a 50-mL syringe, including 4 mL of anticoagulant, 
followed by centrifugation to obtain BMACs. To obtain HVBCs, blood was aspirated 
from the hemovac immediately after TKA surgery. Different cell types were 
enumerated. Isolation of BMA and HVB mononuclear cells was performed using 
density gradient centrifugation. Non-hematopoietic fibroblast colonies were 
quantified by colony forming unit-fibroblast assay surface marker analysis of 
HVB, HVBC, BMA, and BMAC was performed via flow cytometry. Mesenchymal stem 
cells (MSCs) isolated from HVBCs and BMACs were examined for osteogenic, 
adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation potential. Gene expression analysis 
was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
RESULTS: The number of cells from HVB and HVBC was significantly lower than from 
BMA and BMAC; however, the number of colonies in HVBC and BMAC did not differ 
significantly (P>0.05). Isolated cells from both sources had a fibroblast-like 
appearance, adhered to culture flasks, and formed colonies. Under different 
culture conditions, MSC-specific surface markers (CD29, CD44, CD90, CD105), 
osteogenic markers [RUNX2, osteopontin, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP)] and adipogenic markers (PPARγ and C/EBPα) were expressed. Moreover, SOX9, 
type II collagen, and aggrecan were significantly upregulated upon chondrogenic 
differentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: HVB from TKA patients is a useful source of stem cells for 
research.

Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), also called "sanqi" in Chinese, are the main 
active ingredients which are extracted from the root of Panax notoginseng 
(Burk.) F. H. Chen., and they have been traditionally used as a medicine in 
China for hundreds of years with magical medicinal value. PNS have varied 
biological functions, such as anti-inflammatory effects, anti-cancer effects, 
anti-neurotoxicity, and the prevention of diabetes. Nervous system disorders, a 
spectrum of diseases originating from the nervous system, have a significant 
impact on all aspects of patients' lives. Due to the dramatic gains in global 
life expectancy, the prevalence of nervous system disorders is growing 
gradually. Even if the mechanism of these diseases is still not clear, they are 
mainly characterized by neuronal dysfunction and neuronal death. Consequently, 
it is essential to find measures to slow down or prevent the onset of these 
diseases. At present, traditional Chinese medicines, as well as their active 
components, have gained widespread popularity in preventing and treating these 
diseases because of their merits, especially PNS. In this review, we 
predominantly address the recent advances in PNS researches and their biological 
functions, and highlight their applications in nervous system disorders, such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke.

OBJECTIVE: Being able to predict a patient's life expectancy can help doctors 
and patients prioritize treatments and supportive care. For predicting life 
expectancy, physicians have been shown to outperform traditional models that use 
only a few predictor variables. It is possible that a machine learning model 
that uses many predictor variables and diverse data sources from the electronic 
medical record can improve on physicians' performance. For patients with 
metastatic cancer, we compared accuracy of life expectancy predictions by the 
treating physician, a machine learning model, and a traditional model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A machine learning model was trained using 14 600 
metastatic cancer patients' data to predict each patient's distribution of 
survival time. Data sources included note text, laboratory values, and vital 
signs. From 2015-2016, 899 patients receiving radiotherapy for metastatic cancer 
were enrolled in a study in which their radiation oncologist estimated life 
expectancy. Survival predictions were also made by the machine learning model 
and a traditional model using only performance status. Performance was assessed 
with area under the curve for 1-year survival and calibration plots.
RESULTS: The radiotherapy study included 1190 treatment courses in 899 patients. 
A total of 879 treatment courses in 685 patients were included in this analysis. 
Median overall survival was 11.7 months. Physicians, machine learning model, and 
traditional model had area under the curve for 1-year survival of 0.72 (95% CI 
0.63-0.81), 0.77 (0.73-0.81), and 0.68 (0.65-0.71), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning model's predictions were more accurate than 
those of the treating physician or a traditional model.

BACKGROUND: Health state utility values ('utilities') are an integral part of 
health technology assessment. Though traditionally categorised by disease status 
in oncology (i.e. progression), several recent assessments have adopted values 
calculated according to the time that measures were recorded before death. We 
conducted a simulation study to understand the limitations of each approach, 
with a focus on mismatches between the way utilities are generated, and 
analysed.
METHODS: Survival times were simulated based on published literature, with 
permutations of three utility generation mechanisms (UGMs) and utility analysis 
methods (UAMs): (1) progression based, (2) time-to-death based, and (3) a 
'combination approach'. For each analysis quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
were estimated. Goodness of fit was assessed via percentage mean error (%ME) and 
mean absolute error (%MAE). Scenario analyses were performed varying individual 
parameters, with complex scenarios mimicking published studies. The statistical 
code is provided for transparency and to aid future work in the area.
RESULTS: %ME and %MAE were lowest when the correct analysis form was specified 
(i.e. UGM and UAM aligned). Underestimates were produced when a time-to-death 
element was present in the UGM but not included in the UAM, while the 'combined' 
UAM produced overestimates irrespective of the UGM. Scenario analysis 
demonstrated the importance of the volume of available data beyond the initial 
time period, for example follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that the use of an incorrectly or over-specified UAM can 
result in substantial bias in the estimation of utilities. We present a 
flowchart to highlight the issues that may be faced.

The steady rise in life expectancy occurred across all developed countries 
during the last century. This demographic trend is, however, not accompanied by 
the same healthspan extension. This is since aging is the main risk factor for 
all age-associated pathological conditions. Therefore, slowing the rate of aging 
is suggested to be more efficient in preventing or delaying age-related diseases 
than treat them one by one, which is the common approach in a current 
pharmacological disease-oriented paradigm. To date, a variety of medications 
designed to treat particular pathological conditions have been shown to exhibit 
pro-longevity effects in different experimental models. Among them, there are 
many commonly used prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals such as 
metformin, rapamycin, aspirin, statins, melatonin, vitamin antioxidants, etc. 
All of them are being increasingly investigated in preclinical and clinical 
trials with the aim of determine whether they have potential for extension of 
human healthspan. The results from these trials are frequently inconclusive and 
fall short of initial expectations, suggesting that innovative research ideas 
and additional translational steps are required to overcome obstacles for 
implementation of such approaches in clinical practice. In this review, recent 
advances and challenges in the field of repurposing widely used conventional 
pharmaceuticals to target the aging process are summarized and discussed.

BACKGROUND: Real-world data for patients with positive colorectal cancer (CRC) 
screening stool-tests demonstrate that adenoma detection rates are lower when 
endoscopists are blinded to the stool-test results. This suggests adenoma 
sensitivity may be lower for screening colonoscopy than for follow-up to a known 
positive stool-based test. Previous CRC microsimulation models assume identical 
sensitivities between screening and follow-up colonoscopies after positive 
stool-tests. The Colorectal Cancer and Adenoma Incidence and Mortality 
Microsimulation Model (CRC-AIM) was used to explore the impact on screening 
outcomes when assuming different adenoma sensitivity between screening and 
combined follow-up/surveillance colonoscopies.
METHODS: Modeled screening strategies included colonoscopy every 10 years, 
triennial multitarget stool DNA (mt-sDNA), or annual fecal immunochemical test 
(FIT) from 50 to 75 years. Outcomes were reported per 1000 individuals without 
diagnosed CRC at age 40. Base-case adenoma sensitivity values were identical for 
screening and follow-up/surveillance colonoscopies. Ranges of adenoma 
sensitivity values for colonoscopy performance were developed using different 
slopes of odds ratio adjustments and were designated as small, medium, or large 
impact scenarios.
RESULTS: As the differences in adenoma sensitivity for screening versus 
follow-up/surveillance colonoscopies became greater, life-years gained (LYG) and 
reductions in CRC-related incidence and mortality versus no screening increased 
for mt-sDNA and FIT and decreased for screening colonoscopy. The LYG relative to 
screening colonoscopy reached >90% with FIT in the base-case scenario and with 
mt-sDNA in a "medium impact" scenario.
CONCLUSIONS: Assuming identical adenoma sensitivities for screening and 
follow-up/surveillance colonoscopies underestimate the potential benefits of 
stool-based screening strategies.

To examine the suitability of Myzus persicae, Lipaphis erysimi, Semiaphis 
heraclei and Aphis gossypii to propagation of Harmonia axyridis population, we 
studied the development and reproduction of this ladybird by constructing 
two-sex life table in the laboratory with those four aphid species as diet. The 
results showed that the immature duration of H. axyridis decreased in an order 
of L. erysimi (18.18 d), A. gossypii (17.48 d), S. heraclei (16.23 d), and M. 
persicae (15.77 d). The survival rates of preadult period were S. heraclei 
(88.3%), M. persicae (86.7%), L. ery-simi (55.0%), and A. gossypii (55.0%). The 
fecundity of those species were S. heraclei (1750.5), M. persicae (1441.5), A. 
gossypii (1006.3), and L. erysimi (965.2). The longevity of adult ladybird were 
S. heraclei (78.8 d), M. persicae (63.1 d), A. gossypii (54.3 d), and L. erysimi 
(48.4 d). The intrinsic rate of increase (rm) of H. axyridis population 
decreased in an order of M. persicae (0.19), S. heraclei (0.18), L. erysimi 
(0.14), and A. gossypii (0.14). The net reproduction rates (R0) were S. heraclei 
(895.83), M. persicae (600.62), L. erysimi (273.47), and A. gossypii (268.33). 
Among those four aphid species, S. heraclei and M. persicae were more suitable 
for the propagation of H. axyridis population.

The spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula (White), is a new invasive pest in 
the United States. To quantify spotted lanternfly population abundance, one must 
understand this pest's dispersion pattern, that is, the spatial arrangement of 
individuals within a population. Spotted lanternflies overwinter in egg masses 
from late fall to May, making this life stage suitable for population 
assessments. We measured the dispersion pattern of egg masses at two types of 
sites: a suburban housing development, where we used individual trees as the 
sampling unit, and rural woodlots, where we used individual trees and also plots 
with 5.64 m radius as sampling units. Plots were the same size as those 
recommended for monitoring the gypsy moth, a well-studied pest with similar egg 
laying habit to the spotted lanternfly. Egg masses in both sampling units were 
counted up to a height of 3 m. With trees as the sampling unit, egg masses were 
aggregated in 12 of 20 rural sampling universes, randomly dispersed at 6, and 
completely absent at 2. Similar patterns were seen when using the 5.64-m radius 
rural sampling units and for suburban sampling universes. We calculated sample 
size requirements for a range of mean densities at a precision of 25 and 30%. 
Additionally, the vertical distribution of egg masses was characterized on the 
invasive tree of heaven [Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle], a preferred host 
for spotted lanternflies. For small trees, there was a positive relationship 
between number of egg masses in the bottom 3 m of the tree and the total count.

The mortality rate of patients with schizophrenia is high, and life expectancy 
is shorter by 10 to 20 years. Metabolic abnormalities including type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) are among the main reasons. The prevalence of T2DM in patients 
with schizophrenia may be epidemiologically frequent because antipsychotics 
induce weight gain as a side effect and the cognitive dysfunction of patients 
with schizophrenia relates to a disordered lifestyle, poor diet, and low 
socioeconomic status. Apart from these common risk factors and risk factors 
unique to schizophrenia, accumulating evidence suggests the existence of common 
susceptibility genes between schizophrenia and T2DM. Functional proteins 
translated from common genetic susceptibility genes are known to regulate 
neuronal development in the brain and insulin in the pancreas through several 
common cascades. In this review, we discuss common susceptibility genes, 
functional cascades, and the relationship between schizophrenia and T2DM. Many 
genetic and epidemiological studies have reliably associated the comorbidity of 
schizophrenia and T2DM, and it is probably safe to think that common cascades 
and mechanisms suspected from common genes' functions are related to the onset 
of both schizophrenia and T2DM. On the other hand, even when genetic analyses 
are performed on a relatively large number of comorbid patients, the results are 
sometimes inconsistent, and susceptibility genes may carry only a low or 
moderate risk. We anticipate future directions in this field.

The ratio of expansion to compression: A new measure of lifespan disparity.

Numerous studies have shown that high life expectancy is closely related to low 
life disparity. Unlike life expectancy, which can be increased by mortality 
decline at any age, life disparity can either increase or decrease in response 
to mortality decline. Disparity can thus be decomposed into two opposite 
components, called compression and expansion, depending on the effect of 
mortality decline on the age distribution of mortality. Without specifying the 
two components, various conventional measures of disparity may provide 
misleading information relating to how life chances in society can be equalized. 
Based on the relevant properties of changes in disparity, we develop a new 
measure of disparity-the ratio of expansion to compression-that can account for 
the relative importance of the two components. This simple measure not only 
provides a clear view of the evolution of disparity, but also permits changes in 
disparity related to mortality decline to be interpreted in a consistent manner 
similar to life expectancy. Simulations and an empirical analysis demonstrated 
the advantages of this new measure over conventional measures of disparity.

Thermoresponsive cell culture plates release cells as confluent living sheets in 
response to small changes in temperature, with recovered cell sheets retaining 
functional extracellular matrix proteins and tight junctions, both of which 
indicate formation of intact and functional tissue. Our recent studies 
demonstrated that cell sheets are highly effective in promoting mouse 
submandibular gland (SMG) cell differentiation and recovering tissue integrity. 
However, these studies were performed only at early time points and extension of 
the observation period is needed to investigate duration of the cell sheets. 
Thus, the goal of this study was to demonstrate that treatment of wounded mouse 
SMG with cell sheets is capable of increasing salivary epithelial integrity over 
extended time periods. The results indicate that cell sheets promote tissue 
organization as early as eight days after transplantation and that these effects 
endure through Day 20. Furthermore, cell sheet transplantation in wounded SMG 
induces a significant time-dependent enhancement of cell polarization, 
differentiation and ion transporter expression. Finally, this treatment restored 
saliva quantity to pre-wounding levels at both eight and twenty days 
post-surgery and significantly improved saliva quality at twenty days 
post-surgery. These data indicate that cell sheets engineered with 
thermoresponsive cell culture plates are useful for salivary gland regeneration 
and provide evidence for the long-term stability of cell sheets, thereby 
offering a potential new therapeutic strategy for treating hyposalivation.

BACKGROUND: Addressing non-communicable disease (NCDs) is a global priority in 
the Sustainable Development Goals, especially for adolescents. However, existing 
literature on NCD burden, risk factors and determinants, and effective 
interventions and policies for targeting these diseases in adolescents, is 
limited. This study develops an evidence-based conceptual framework, and 
highlights pathways between risk factors and interventions to NCD development 
during adolescence (ages 10-19 years) and continuing into adulthood. 
Additionally, the epidemiologic profile of key NCD risk factors and outcomes 
among adolescents and preventative NCD policies/laws/legislations are examined, 
and a multivariable analysis is conducted to explore the determinants of NCDs 
among adolescents and adults.
METHODS: We reviewed literature to develop an adolescent-specific conceptual 
framework for NCDs. Global data repositories were searched from Jan-July 2018 
for data on NCD-related risk factors, outcomes, and policy data for 194 
countries from 1990 to 2016. Disability-Adjusted Life Years were used to assess 
disease burden. A hierarchical modeling approach and ordinary least squares 
regression was used to explore the basic and underlying causes of NCD burden.
RESULTS: Mental health disorders are the most common NCDs found in adolescents. 
Adverse behaviours and lifestyle factors, specifically smoking, alcohol and drug 
use, poor diet and metabolic syndrome, are key risk factors for NCD development 
in adolescence. Across countries, laws and policies for preventing NCD-related 
risk factors exist, however those targeting contraceptive use, drug harm 
reduction, mental health and nutrition are generally limited. Many effective 
interventions for NCD prevention exist but must be implemented at scale through 
multisectoral action utilizing diverse delivery mechanisms. Multivariable 
analyses showed that structural/macro, community and household factors have 
significant associations with NCD burden among adolescents and adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Multi-sectoral efforts are needed to target NCD risk factors among 
adolescents to mitigate disease burden and adverse outcomes in adulthood. 
Findings could guide policy and programming to reduce NCD burden in the 
sustainable development era.

BACKGROUND: In vivo assessment of neuroinflammation by 18-kDa translocator 
protein positron-emission-tomography (TSPO-PET) ligands receives growing 
interest in preclinical and clinical research of neurodegenerative disorders. 
Higher TSPO-PET binding as a surrogate for microglial activation in females has 
been reported for cognitively normal humans, but such effects have not yet been 
evaluated in rodent models of neurodegeneration and their controls. Thus, we 
aimed to investigate the impact of sex on microglial activation in amyloid and 
tau mouse models and wild-type controls.
METHODS: TSPO-PET (18F-GE-180) data of C57Bl/6 (wild-type), AppNL-G-F (β-amyloid 
model), and P301S (tau model) mice was assessed longitudinally between 2 and 12 
months of age. The AppNL-G-F group also underwent longitudinal β-amyloid-PET 
imaging (Aβ-PET; 18F-florbetaben). PET results were confirmed and validated by 
immunohistochemical investigation of microglial (Iba-1, CD68), astrocytic 
(GFAP), and tau (AT8) markers. Findings in cerebral cortex were compared by sex 
using linear mixed models for PET data and analysis of variance for 
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Wild-type mice showed an increased TSPO-PET signal over time (female 
+23%, male +4%), with a significant sex × age interaction (T = - 4.171, 
p < 0.001). The Aβ model AppNL-G-F mice also showed a significant sex × age 
interaction (T = - 2.953, p = 0.0048), where cortical TSPO-PET values increased 
by 31% in female AppNL-G-F mice, versus only 6% in the male mice group from 2.5 
to 10 months of age. Immunohistochemistry for the microglial markers Iba-1 and 
CD68 confirmed the TSPO-PET findings in male and female mice aged 10 months. 
Aβ-PET in the same AppNL-G-F mice indicated no significant sex × age interaction 
(T = 0.425, p = 0.673). The P301S tau model showed strong cortical increases of 
TSPO-PET from 2 to 8.5 months of age (female + 32%, male + 36%), without any 
significant sex × age interaction (T = - 0.671, p = 0.504), and no sex 
differences in Iba-1, CD68, or AT8 immunohistochemistry.
CONCLUSION: Female mice indicate sex-dependent microglia activation in aging and 
in response to amyloidosis but not in response to tau pathology. This calls for 
consideration of sex difference in TSPO-PET studies of microglial activation in 
mouse models of neurodegeneration and by extension in human studies.

BACKGROUND: Theory-based methods to support the uptake of evidence-based 
practices (EBPs) are critical to improving mental health outcomes. 
Implementation strategy costs can be substantial, and few have been rigorously 
evaluated. The purpose of this study is to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis 
to identify the most cost-effective approach to deploying implementation 
strategies to enhance the uptake of Life Goals, a mental health EBP.
METHODS: We used data from a previously conducted randomized trial to compare 
the cost-effectiveness of Replicating Effective Programs (REP) combined with 
external and/or internal facilitation among sites non-responsive to REP. REP is 
a low-level strategy that includes EBP packaging, training, and technical 
assistance. External facilitation (EF) involves external expert support, and 
internal facilitation (IF) augments EF with protected time for internal staff to 
support EBP implementation. We developed a decision tree to assess 1-year costs 
and outcomes for four implementation strategies: (1) REP only, (2) REP+EF, (3) 
REP+EF add IF if needed, (4) REP+EF/IF. The analysis used a 1-year time horizon 
and assumed a health payer perspective. Our outcome was quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs). The economic outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER). We conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA).
RESULTS: Our results indicate that REP+EF add IF is the most cost-effective 
option with an ICER of $593/QALY. The REP+EF/IF and REP+EF only conditions are 
dominated (i.e., more expensive and less effective than comparators). One-way 
sensitivity analyses indicate that results are sensitive to utilities for REP+EF 
and REP+EF add IF. The PSA results indicate that REP+EF, add IF is the optimal 
strategy in 30% of iterations at the threshold of $100,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the most cost-effective implementation 
support begins with a less intensive, less costly strategy initially and 
increases as needed to enhance EBP uptake. Using this approach, implementation 
support resources can be judiciously allocated to those clinics that would most 
benefit. Our results were not robust to changes in the utility measure. Research 
is needed that incorporates robust and relevant utilities in implementation 
studies to determine the most cost-effective strategies. This study advances 
economic evaluation of implementation by assessing costs and utilities across 
multiple implementation strategy combinations.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of combined exercise-nutrition 
interventions in prefrail/frail hospitalised older adults on frailty, 
frailty-related indicators, quality of life (QoL), falls and its 
cost-effectiveness.
DESIGN: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of combined exercise-nutrition 
interventions on hospitalised prefrail/frail older adults ≥65 years were 
collated from MEDLINE, Emcare, CINAHL, Ageline, Scopus, Cochrane and PEDro on 10 
October 2019. The methodological quality was appraised, and data were summarised 
descriptively or by meta-analysis using a fixed effects model. The standardised 
mean difference (SMD) or difference of means (MD) with 95% CIs was calculated.
RESULTS: Twenty articles from 11 RCTs experimenting exercise-nutrition 
interventions on hospitalised older adults were included. Seven articles were 
suitable for the meta-analyses. One study had low risk of bias and found 
improvements in physical performance and frailty-related biomarkers. Exercise 
interventions were mostly supervised by a physiotherapist, focusing on strength, 
ranging 2-5 times/week, of 20-90 min duration. Most nutrition interventions 
involved counselling and supplementation but had dietitian supervision in only 
three studies. The meta-analyses suggest that participants who received 
exercise-nutrition intervention had greater reduction in frailty scores (n=3, 
SMD 0.25; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.46; p=0.02) and improvement in short physical 
performance battery (SPPB) scores (n=3, MD 0.48; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.84; p=0.008) 
compared with standard care. Only the chair-stand test (n=3) out of the three 
SPPB components was significantly improved (MD 0.26; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.43; 
p=0.003). Patients were more independent in activities of daily living in 
intervention groups, but high heterogeneity was observed (I2=96%, p<0.001). The 
pooled effect for handgrip (n=3)±knee extension muscle strength (n=4) was not 
statistically significant. Nutritional status, cognition, biomarkers, QoL, falls 
and cost-effectiveness were summarised descriptively due to insufficient data.
CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence, albeit weak, showing that exercise-nutrition 
interventions are effective to improve frailty and frailty-related indicators in 
hospitalised older adults.

INTRODUCTION: Radiation therapy is a very useful treatment for central nervous 
systemS neoplasms. The time range of its complications is very wide; they appear 
even many years after its completion. These late complications behave clinically 
and radiologically similar to a relapse; a functional diagnostic study with 
radioactive isotopes can help to make a therapeutic decision.
CASE REPORT: A male suddenly presented deficient neurological symptoms in the 
same site where he received radiation therapy 25 years earlier for a pilocytic 
astrocytoma. The MRI findings suggested a lacunar stroke but a finding in the 
perfusion sequence forced us to be more precise in the diagnosis. A PET-CT 
11C-methionine was performed which showed an increased uptake compatible with 
neoplasia. The spontaneous regressive evolution of the symptoms inclined us to 
take a conservative attitude. Lacunar ictus was confirmed on MRI three months 
later.
CONCLUSIONS: The reappearance of neurological symptoms years after radiotherapy 
of a brain neoplasm poses a diagnostic dilemma. Current diagnostic techniques 
are very accurate but present false positives. The various nuclear medicine 
techniques, in particular PET-CT 11C-methionine, are a diagnostic aid. With the 
presentation of this case we intend to draw attention to one of the late 
complications of radiation therapy and the various differential diagnoses. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic advances have increased the life expectancy of cancer 
patients, so these late complications are expected to be more frequent.

Publisher: TITLE: Ictus lacunar como complicación muy tardía de la radioterapia: 
valor de las técnicas de medicina nuclear.
Introducción. La radioterapia es un tratamiento de gran utilidad en las 
neoplasias del sistema nervioso central. El rango temporal de sus complicaciones 
es muy amplio, ya que aparecen incluso muchos años más tarde de haberla 
finalizado. Estas complicaciones tardías se comportan clínica y radiológicamente 
de forma similar a una recidiva; un estudio funcional diagnóstico con isótopos 
radiactivos puede ayudar a tomar una decisión terapéutica. Caso clínico. Varón 
que presentó de forma brusca sintomatología neurológica deficitaria en la misma 
localización donde 25 años antes había recibido radioterapia por un astrocitoma 
pilocítico. La resonancia magnética sugería un ictus lacunar, pero un hallazgo 
en la secuencia de perfusión obligaba a ser más preciso en el diagnóstico. Una 
tomografía por emisión de positrones-tomografía computarizada (PET-TC) con 
C11-metionina mostró un aumento de captación compatible con neoplasia. La 
evolución espontánea regresiva de los síntomas inclinó a tomar una actitud 
conservadora. Una resonancia magnética realizada tres meses más tarde confirmó 
el ictus lacunar. Conclusiones. La reaparición de síntomas neurológicos años más 
tarde de la radioterapia de una neoplasia cerebral supone un dilema diagnóstico.
