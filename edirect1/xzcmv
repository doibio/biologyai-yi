BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) 2017 comparative risk assessment (CRA) is a comprehensive approach to risk 
factor quantification that offers a useful tool for synthesising evidence on 
risks and risk-outcome associations. With each annual GBD study, we update the 
GBD CRA to incorporate improved methods, new risks and risk-outcome pairs, and 
new data on risk exposure levels and risk-outcome associations.
METHODS: We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to 
estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location 
for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or 
groups of risks from 1990 to 2017. This study included 476 risk-outcome pairs 
that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of 
causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46 749 
randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, household surveys, census data, 
satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, 
adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario 
of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of 
deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the 
relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship 
between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence 
and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. 
Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing 
those changes into six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) 
population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in 
exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to 
behavioural risks; (5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes 
due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and DALY rates, 
where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced 
the exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017.
FINDINGS: In 2017, 34·1 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 33·3-35·0) deaths 
and 1·21 billion (1·14-1·28) DALYs were attributable to GBD risk factors. 
Globally, 61·0% (59·6-62·4) of deaths and 48·3% (46·3-50·2) of DALYs were 
attributed to the GBD 2017 risk factors. When ranked by risk-attributable DALYs, 
high systolic blood pressure (SBP) was the leading risk factor, accounting for 
10·4 million (9·39-11·5) deaths and 218 million (198-237) DALYs, followed by 
smoking (7·10 million [6·83-7·37] deaths and 182 million [173-193] DALYs), high 
fasting plasma glucose (6·53 million [5·23-8·23] deaths and 171 million 
[144-201] DALYs), high body-mass index (BMI; 4·72 million [2·99-6·70] deaths and 
148 million [98·6-202] DALYs), and short gestation for birthweight (1·43 million 
[1·36-1·51] deaths and 139 million [131-147] DALYs). In total, risk-attributable 
DALYs declined by 4·9% (3·3-6·5) between 2007 and 2017. In the absence of 
demographic changes (ie, population growth and ageing), changes in risk exposure 
and risk-deleted DALYs would have led to a 23·5% decline in DALYs during that 
period. Conversely, in the absence of changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted 
DALYs, demographic changes would have led to an 18·6% increase in DALYs during 
that period. The ratios of observed risk exposure levels to exposure levels 
expected based on SDI (O/E ratios) increased globally for unsafe drinking water 
and household air pollution between 1990 and 2017. This result suggests that 
development is occurring more rapidly than are changes in the underlying risk 
structure in a population. Conversely, nearly universal declines in O/E ratios 
for smoking and alcohol use indicate that, for a given SDI, exposure to these 
risks is declining. In 2017, the leading Level 4 risk factor for 
age-standardised DALY rates was high SBP in four super-regions: central Europe, 
eastern Europe, and central Asia; north Africa and Middle East; south Asia; and 
southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania. The leading risk factor in the 
high-income super-region was smoking, in Latin America and Caribbean was high 
BMI, and in sub-Saharan Africa was unsafe sex. O/E ratios for unsafe sex in 
sub-Saharan Africa were notably high, and those for alcohol use in north Africa 
and the Middle East were notably low.
INTERPRETATION: By quantifying levels and trends in exposures to risk factors 
and the resulting disease burden, this assessment offers insight into where past 
policy and programme efforts might have been successful and highlights current 
priorities for public health action. Decreases in behavioural, environmental, 
and occupational risks have largely offset the effects of population growth and 
ageing, in relation to trends in absolute burden. Conversely, the combination of 
increasing metabolic risks and population ageing will probably continue to drive 
the increasing trends in non-communicable diseases at the global level, which 
presents both a public health challenge and opportunity. We see considerable 
spatiotemporal heterogeneity in levels of risk exposure and risk-attributable 
burden. Although levels of development underlie some of this heterogeneity, O/E 
ratios show risks for which countries are overperforming or underperforming 
relative to their level of development. As such, these ratios provide a 
benchmarking tool to help to focus local decision making. Our findings reinforce 
the importance of both risk exposure monitoring and epidemiological research to 
assess causal connections between risks and health outcomes, and they highlight 
the usefulness of the GBD study in synthesising data to draw comprehensive and 
robust conclusions that help to inform good policy and strategic health 
planning.

Health Disparities Among American Indians/Alaska Natives - Arizona, 2017.

Adakai M, Sandoval-Rosario M, Xu F, Aseret-Manygoats T, Allison M, Greenlund KJ, 
Barbour KE.

Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, American Indians/Alaska Natives 
(AI/AN) have a lower life expectancy, lower quality of life, and are 
disproportionately affected by many chronic conditions (1,2). Arizona has the 
third largest population of AI/AN in the United States (approximately 266,000 in 
2017), and is home to 22 federally recognized American Indian tribal nations.* 
The small AI/AN sample size in previous Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System (BRFSS) surveys has presented analytic challenges in making statistical 
inferences about this population. To identify health disparities among AI/AN 
living in Arizona, the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) and CDC 
analyzed data from the 2017 BRFSS survey, for which AI/AN were oversampled. 
Compared with whites, AI/AN had significantly higher prevalences of 
sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (33.0% versus 26.8%), being overweight or 
having obesity (76.7% versus 63.2%), diabetes (21.4% versus 8.0%), high blood 
pressure (32.9% versus 27.6%), report of fair or poor health status (28.7% 
versus 16.3%), and leisure-time physical inactivity during the past month (31.1% 
versus 23.0%). AI/AN also reported a lower prevalence of having a personal 
doctor or health care provider (63.1%) than did whites (72.8%). This report 
highlights the need to enhance surveillance measures at the local, state, and 
national levels and can inform interventions centered on confronting social 
inequities, developing culturally competent prevention strategies, and 
facilitating access to care to improve population health and work toward health 
equity.

BACKGROUND: The increasing numbers of people living with HIV (PLHIV) who are 
receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) have near normal life-expectancy, 
resulting in more people living with HIV over the age of 50 years (PLHIV50+). 
Estimates of the number of PLHIV50+ are needed for the development of tailored 
therapeutic and prevention interventions at country, regional and global level.
METHODS: The AIDS Impact Module of the Spectrum software was used to compute the 
numbers of PLHIV, new infections, and AIDS-related deaths for PLHIV50+ for the 
years 2000-2016. Projections until 2020 were calculated based on an assumed ART 
scale-up to 81% coverage by 2020, consistent with the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment 
targets.
RESULTS: Globally, there were 5.7 million [4.7 million- 6.6 million] PLHIV50+ in 
2016. The proportion of PLHIV50+ increased substantially from 8% in 2000 to 16% 
in 2016 and is expected to increase to 21% by 2020. In 2016, 80% of PLHIV50+ 
lived in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with Eastern and Southern 
Africa containing the largest number of PLHIV50+. While the proportion of 
PLHIV50+ was greater in high income countries, LMICs have higher numbers of 
PLHIV50+ that are expected to continue to increase by 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of PLHIV50+ has increased dramatically since 2000 and 
this is expected to continue by 2020, especially in LMICs. HIV prevention 
campaigns, testing and treatment programs should also focus on the specific 
needs of PLHIV50+. Integrated health and social services should be developed to 
cater for the changing physical, psychological and social needs of PLHIV50+, 
many of whom will need to use HIV and non-HIV services.

The health and life span of Drosophila melanogaster are partly determined by 
intestinal barrier integrity, metabolic rate as well as stress response and the 
expression of longevity-associated genes, depending on genetic and dietary 
factors. Ursolic acid (UA) is a naturally occurring triterpenoid exhibiting 
potential antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antiobesity activity and 
counteracting age-related deficits in muscle strength. In this study, UA was 
dietarily administered to w1118 D. melanogaster which significantly elongated 
the health and life span of males. Spargel (srl) is the Drosophila orthologue of 
mammalian peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 
α(PGC1α), an important regulator of energy homeostasis and mitochondrial 
function. Our results indicate that the health-promoting effect of UA, 
demonstrated by a significant increase in climbing activity, occurs via an 
upregulation of srl expression leading to a metabolic shift in the fly without 
reducing fecundity or gut integrity. Moreover, UA affected the flies' microbiota 
in a manner that contributed to life span extension. Srl expression and 
microbiota both seem to be affected by UA, as we determined by using srl-mutant 
and axenic flies. © 2018 BioFactors, 45(2):169-186, 2019.

PURPOSE: Developing a quantitative decision-support strategy estimating the 
impact of normal tissue complications from definitive radiation therapy (RT) for 
head and neck cancer (HNC). We developed this strategy to identify patients with 
oropharyngeal HNC who may benefit most from receiving proton RT.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Recent normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) 
models for dysphagia, esophagitis, hypothyroidism, xerostomia, and oral 
mucositis were used to estimate NTCP for 33 patients with oropharyngeal HNC 
previously treated with photon intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). 
Comparative proton therapy plans were generated using clinical protocols for HNC 
RT at a collaborating proton center. Organ-at-risk (OAR) doses from photon and 
proton RT plans were used to calculate NTCPs; Monte Carlo sampling 10,000 times 
was used for each patient to account for model parameter uncertainty. The 
latency and duration of each complication were modeled from calculated NTCP, 
accounting for age-, sex-, smoking- and p16-specific conditional survival 
probability. Complications were then assigned quality-adjustment factors based 
on severity to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost from each 
complication.
RESULTS: Based on our institutional-delivered photon IMRT doses and the 
achievable proton therapy doses, the average QALY reduction from all HNC RT 
complications for photon and proton therapy was 1.52 QALYs versus 1.15 QALYs, 
with proton therapy sparing 0.37 QALYs on average (composite 95% confidence 
interval, 0.27-2.53 QALYs). Long-term complications (dysphagia and xerostomia) 
contributed most to the QALY reduction. The QALYs spared with proton RT varied 
considerably among patients, ranging from 0.06 to 0.84 QALYs. Younger patients 
with p16-positive tumors who smoked ≤10 pack-years may benefit most from proton 
therapy, although this finding should be validated using larger patient series. 
A sensitivity analysis reducing photon IMRT doses to all OARs by 20% resulted in 
no overall estimated benefit with proton therapy with -0.02 QALYs spared, 
although some patients still had an estimated benefit in this scenario, ranging 
from -0.50 to 0.43 QALYs spared.
CONCLUSIONS: This quantitative decision-support strategy allowed us to identify 
patients with oropharyngeal cancer who might benefit the most from proton RT, 
although the estimated benefit of proton therapy ultimately depends on the OAR 
doses achievable with modern photon IMRT solutions. These results can help 
radiation oncologists and proton therapy centers optimize resource allocation 
and improve quality of life for patients with HNC.

BACKGROUND: For demanding activities in daily life, such as negotiating stairs, 
ramps and uneven ground, the functionality of conventional prosthetic feet 
("Daily Life Feet" - DLF) is often limited. With the introduction of 
microprocessor-controlled feet (MPF) it was expected that the functional 
limitations of DLF might be reduced. The purpose of the present study was to 
investigate biomechanical gait parameters with DLF and MPF when walking on a 
specifically designed ramp involving abruptly changing inclination angles as a 
scenario reflecting typical situations related to walking on uneven ground.
RESEARCH QUESTION: The specific aim of the study was to answer the research 
question if the advanced adaptability of MPF to different ground slopes would 
lead to more natural motion patterns and reduced joint loading compared with DLF 
feet.
METHODS: A specifically designed ramp was installed within a gait lab. During 
downward motion on this ramp biomechanical parameters - ground reaction forces, 
joint moments and joint angles were obtained both with DLF and MPF used by four 
transtibial amputees. A control group of 10 non-amputees (NA) was measured with 
for comparison.
RESULTS: The NA group managed the ramp element with the abruptly changing 
inclination with a specific ankle joint adaptation. Compared to DLF the MPF 
considerably improved the ankle adaptation to the abruptly changing inclination 
which was reflected by a significantly increased stance phase dorsiflexion which 
was comparable to the NA group. The peak value of the knee extension moment on 
the prosthetic side was significantly increased with DLF, whereas it was almost 
normal with MPF (DLF: 0.71 ± 0.13 Nm/kg, MPF: 0.42 ± 0.12 Nm/kg, NA: 
0.36 ± 0.07 Nm/kg, p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). The external knee adduction moment 
was generally reduced for the transtibial amputees and did not show differences 
between foot designs.
SIGNIFICANCE: The adaptable ankle joint motion of the MPF is a crucial 
requirement for a more natural motion pattern and leads to a reduction of 
sagittal knee joint loading on the prosthetic side.

Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a rare cutaneous malignancy most commonly 
affecting the genitals, perineum, and perianal area of the elderly. Despite its 
rarity, to those impacted, the disease and its treatment can have a tremendous 
impact on quality of life. Commonly confined to the epidermis, EMPD can be 
invasive, associated with contiguous extension or upward pagetoid spread of 
underlying malignancy or with distant synchronous malignancy. Because of its 
association with other cancers, formal evaluation is warranted. Treatment varies 
widely and evidence-based approaches are lacking. The authors review the workup 
and management options for the patient with EMPD.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported national and regional Global Burden 
of Disease (GBD) estimates for the UK. Because of substantial variation in 
health within the UK, action to improve it requires comparable estimates of 
disease burden and risks at country and local levels. The slowdown in the rate 
of improvement in life expectancy requires further investigation. We use GBD 
2016 data on mortality, causes of death, and disability to analyse the burden of 
disease in the countries of the UK and within local authorities in England by 
deprivation quintile.
METHODS: We extracted data from the GBD 2016 to estimate years of life lost 
(YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs), and attributable risks from 1990 to 2016 for England, Scotland, Wales, 
Northern Ireland, the UK, and 150 English Upper-Tier Local Authorities. We 
estimated the burden of disease by cause of death, condition, year, and sex. We 
analysed the association between burden of disease and socioeconomic deprivation 
using the Index of Multiple Deprivation. We present results for all 264 GBD 
causes of death combined and the leading 20 specific causes, and all 84 GBD 
risks or risk clusters combined and 17 specific risks or risk clusters.
FINDINGS: The leading causes of age-adjusted YLLs in all UK countries in 2016 
were ischaemic heart disease, lung cancers, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease. Age-standardised rates of YLLs for all causes 
varied by two times between local areas in England according to levels of 
socioeconomic deprivation (from 14 274 per 100 000 population [95% uncertainty 
interval 12 791-15 875] in Blackpool to 6888 [6145-7739] in Wokingham). Some 
Upper-Tier Local Authorities, particularly those in London, did better than 
expected for their level of deprivation. Allowing for differences in age 
structure, more deprived Upper-Tier Local Authorities had higher attributable 
YLLs for most major risk factors in the GBD. The population attributable 
fractions for all-cause YLLs for individual major risk factors varied across 
Upper-Tier Local Authorities. Life expectancy and YLLs have improved more slowly 
since 2010 in all UK countries compared with 1990-2010. In nine of 150 
Upper-Tier Local Authorities, YLLs increased after 2010. For attributable YLLs, 
the rate of improvement slowed most substantially for cardiovascular disease and 
breast, colorectal, and lung cancers, and showed little change for Alzheimer's 
disease and other dementias. Morbidity makes an increasing contribution to 
overall burden in the UK compared with mortality. The age-standardised UK DALY 
rate for low back and neck pain (1795 [1258-2356]) was higher than for ischaemic 
heart disease (1200 [1155-1246]) or lung cancer (660 [642-679]). The leading 
causes of ill health (measured through YLDs) in the UK in 2016 were low back and 
neck pain, skin and subcutaneous diseases, migraine, depressive disorders, and 
sense organ disease. Age-standardised YLD rates varied much less than equivalent 
YLL rates across the UK, which reflects the relative scarcity of local data on 
causes of ill health.
INTERPRETATION: These estimates at local, regional, and national level will 
allow policy makers to match resources and priorities to levels of burden and 
risk factors. Improvement in YLLs and life expectancy slowed notably after 2010, 
particularly in cardiovascular disease and cancer, and targeted actions are 
needed if the rate of improvement is to recover. A targeted policy response is 
also required to address the increasing proportion of burden due to morbidity, 
such as musculoskeletal problems and depression. Improving the quality and 
completeness of available data on these causes is an essential component of this 
response.

BACKGROUND: The number of individuals living with dementia is increasing, 
negatively affecting families, communities, and health-care systems around the 
world. A successful response to these challenges requires an accurate 
understanding of the dementia disease burden. We aimed to present the first 
detailed analysis of the global prevalence, mortality, and overall burden of 
dementia as captured by the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors (GBD) Study 2016, and highlight the most important messages for 
clinicians and neurologists.
METHODS: GBD 2016 obtained data on dementia from vital registration systems, 
published scientific literature and surveys, and data from health-service 
encounters on deaths, excess mortality, prevalence, and incidence from 195 
countries and territories from 1990 to 2016, through systematic review and 
additional data-seeking efforts. To correct for differences in cause of death 
coding across time and locations, we modelled mortality due to dementia using 
prevalence data and estimates of excess mortality derived from countries that 
were most likely to code deaths to dementia relative to prevalence. Data were 
analysed by standardised methods to estimate deaths, prevalence, years of life 
lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs; computed as the sum of YLLs and YLDs), and the fractions of 
these metrics that were attributable to four risk factors that met GBD criteria 
for assessment (high body-mass index [BMI], high fasting plasma glucose, 
smoking, and a diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages).
FINDINGS: In 2016, the global number of individuals who lived with dementia was 
43·8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 37·8-51·0), increased from 20.2 
million (17·4-23·5) in 1990. This increase of 117% (95% UI 114-121) contrasted 
with a minor increase in age-standardised prevalence of 1·7% (1·0-2·4), from 701 
cases (95% UI 602-815) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 712 cases (614-828) per 
100 000 population in 2016. More women than men had dementia in 2016 (27·0 
million, 95% UI 23·3-31·4, vs 16.8 million, 14.4-19.6), and dementia was the 
fifth leading cause of death globally, accounting for 2·4 million (95% UI 
2·1-2·8) deaths. Overall, 28·8 million (95% UI 24·5-34·0) DALYs were attributed 
to dementia; 6·4 million (95% UI 3·4-10·5) of these could be attributed to the 
modifiable GBD risk factors of high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, smoking, 
and a high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages.
INTERPRETATION: The global number of people living with dementia more than 
doubled from 1990 to 2016, mainly due to increases in population ageing and 
growth. Although differences in coding for causes of death and the heterogeneity 
in case-ascertainment methods constitute major challenges to the estimation of 
the burden of dementia, future analyses should improve on the methods for the 
correction of these biases. Until breakthroughs are made in prevention or 
curative treatment, dementia will constitute an increasing challenge to 
health-care systems worldwide.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) are 
increasingly recognised as global health priorities in view of the 
preventability of most injuries and the complex and expensive medical care they 
necessitate. We aimed to measure the incidence, prevalence, and years of life 
lived with disability (YLDs) for TBI and SCI from all causes of injury in every 
country, to describe how these measures have changed between 1990 and 2016, and 
to estimate the proportion of TBI and SCI cases caused by different types of 
injury.
METHODS: We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors (GBD) Study 2016 to measure the global, regional, and national burden of 
TBI and SCI by age and sex. We measured the incidence and prevalence of all 
causes of injury requiring medical care in inpatient and outpatient records, 
literature studies, and survey data. By use of clinical record data, we 
estimated the proportion of each cause of injury that required medical care that 
would result in TBI or SCI being considered as the nature of injury. We used 
literature studies to establish standardised mortality ratios and applied 
differential equations to convert incidence to prevalence of long-term 
disability. Finally, we applied GBD disability weights to calculate YLDs. We 
used a Bayesian meta-regression tool for epidemiological modelling, used 
cause-specific mortality rates for non-fatal estimation, and adjusted our 
results for disability experienced with comorbid conditions. We also analysed 
results on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index, a compound measure of 
income per capita, education, and fertility.
FINDINGS: In 2016, there were 27·08 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
24·30-30·30 million) new cases of TBI and 0·93 million (0·78-1·16 million) new 
cases of SCI, with age-standardised incidence rates of 369 (331-412) per 100 000 
population for TBI and 13 (11-16) per 100 000 for SCI. In 2016, the number of 
prevalent cases of TBI was 55·50 million (53·40-57·62 million) and of SCI was 
27·04 million (24·98-30·15 million). From 1990 to 2016, the age-standardised 
prevalence of TBI increased by 8·4% (95% UI 7·7 to 9·2), whereas that of SCI did 
not change significantly (-0·2% [-2·1 to 2·7]). Age-standardised incidence rates 
increased by 3·6% (1·8 to 5·5) for TBI, but did not change significantly for SCI 
(-3·6% [-7·4 to 4·0]). TBI caused 8·1 million (95% UI 6·0-10·4 million) YLDs and 
SCI caused 9·5 million (6·7-12·4 million) YLDs in 2016, corresponding to 
age-standardised rates of 111 (82-141) per 100 000 for TBI and 130 (90-170) per 
100 000 for SCI. Falls and road injuries were the leading causes of new cases of 
TBI and SCI in most regions.
INTERPRETATION: TBI and SCI constitute a considerable portion of the global 
injury burden and are caused primarily by falls and road injuries. The increase 
in incidence of TBI over time might continue in view of increases in population 
density, population ageing, and increasing use of motor vehicles, motorcycles, 
and bicycles. The number of individuals living with SCI is expected to increase 
in view of population growth, which is concerning because of the specialised 
care that people with SCI can require. Our study was limited by data sparsity in 
some regions, and it will be important to invest greater resources in collection 
of data for TBI and SCI to improve the accuracy of future assessments.

BACKGROUND: Multiple pathway models of ADHD suggest that multiple, separable 
biological pathways may lead to symptoms of the disorder. If this is the case, 
it should be possible to identify subgroups of children with ADHD based on 
distinct patterns of brain activity. Previous studies have used latent class 
analysis (LCA) to define subgroups at the behavioral and cognitive level and to 
then test whether they differ at the neurobiological level. In this proof of 
concept study, we took a reverse approach. We applied LCA to functional imaging 
data from two previously published studies to explore whether we could identify 
subgroups of children with ADHD symptoms at the neurobiological level with a 
meaningful relation to behavior or neuropsychology.
METHODS: Fifty-six children with symptoms of ADHD (27 children with ADHD and 29 
children with ASD and ADHD symptoms) and 31 typically developing children 
performed two neuropsychological tasks assessing reward sensitivity and temporal 
expectancy during functional magnetic resonance imaging. LCA was used to 
identify subgroups with similar patterns of brain activity separately for 
children with ADHD-symptoms and typically developing children. Behavioral and 
neuropsychological differences between subgroups were subsequently investigated.
RESULTS: For typically developing children, a one-subgroup model gave the most 
parsimonious fit, whereas for children with ADHD-symptoms a two-subgroup model 
best fits the data. The first ADHD subgroup (n = 49) showed attenuated brain 
activity compared to the second subgroup (n = 7) and to typically developing 
children (n = 31). Notably, the ADHD subgroup with attenuated brain activity 
showed less behavioral problems in everyday life.
CONCLUSIONS: In this proof of concept study, we showed that we could identify 
distinct subgroups of children with ADHD-symptoms based on their brain activity 
profiles. Generalizability was limited due to the small sample size, but 
ultimately such neurobiological profiles could improve insight in individual 
prognosis and treatment options.
