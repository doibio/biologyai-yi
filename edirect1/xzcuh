Endocrine organs are metastatic targets for several primary cancers, either 
through direct extension from nearby tumour cells or dissemination via the 
venous, arterial and lymphatic routes. Although any endocrine tissue can be 
affected, most clinically relevant metastases involve the pituitary and adrenal 
glands with the commonest manifestations being diabetes insipidus and adrenal 
insufficiency respectively. The most common primary tumours metastasing to the 
adrenals include melanomas, breast and lung carcinomas, which may lead to 
adrenal insufficiency in the presence of bilateral adrenal involvement. Breast 
and lung cancers are the most common primaries metastasing to the pituitary, 
leading to pituitary dysfunction in approximately 30% of cases. The thyroid 
gland can be affected by renal, colorectal, lung and breast carcinomas, and 
melanomas, but has rarely been associated with thyroid dysfunction. Pancreatic 
metastasis can lead to exo-/endocrine insufficiency with renal carcinoma being 
the most common primary. Most parathyroid metastases originate from breast and 
lung carcinomas and melanoma. Breast and colorectal cancers are the most 
frequent ovarian metastases; prostate cancer commonly affects the testes. In the 
presence of endocrine deficiencies, glucocorticoid replacement for adrenal and 
pituitary involvement can be life saving. As most metastases to endocrine organs 
develop in the context of disseminated disease, surgical resection or other 
local therapies should only be considered to ameliorate symptoms and reduce 
tumour volume. Although few consensus statements can be made regarding the 
management of metastases to endocrine tissues because of the heterogeneity of 
the variable therapies, it is important that clinicians are aware of their 
presence in diagnosis.

[Towards an effective assessment of the sustainability of health interventions].

In a sluggish economy, cost containment is a central issue for the national 
health service, and health authorities are increasingly requiring proof of the 
economic and clinical value of health interventions. In this context, the 
integration and/or evolution of techniques to measure the economic sustain- 
ability of new technologies is essential. The disability-adjusted life year 
(DALY) and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) are two measures used in the 
assessment of health interventions, which, although based on the same 
theoretical concept, differ in a number of important aspects. DALY can overcome 
the limit of using arbitrary economic threshold values since it is a benchmark 
directly comparable with the GDP per capita, an unbiased measure of 
sustainability. Indeed, in 2002 the World Health Organization (WHO) suggested 
that interventions costing less than 3 times the per-capita GDP per DALY averted 
could be considered cost effective. The Expected Value of Information and an 
estimate of the contribution to GDP (social costs due to presenteeism and 
absenteeism), along with Health Technology Assessment-based disinvestment 
decisions and the generation of a comprehensive health dataset (to be analysed 
using artificial intelligence) should be implemented. These procedures may 
improve the effectiveness of health governance and lead to better quality of 
healthcare services.

Services, Trento, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Enhanced focus on primary care provision is essential for lowering 
the risk of asthma exacerbation and complications, as well as for decreasing 
asthma-related hospitalizations and deaths. This article provides an update on 
current worldwide epidemiology of asthma.
METHODS: Worldwide epidemiologic information on asthma was obtained through 
electronic searches in the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) database.
RESULTS: In 2017, the incidence of asthma was 43.12 million new cases/year 
(0.56%), while in that same year, prevalence and mortality accounted for 272.68 
million cases (3.57%) and 0.49 million deaths (0.006%), respectively. Although 
the number of asthma cases significantly increased during the last 25 years, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths constantly declined. After 
adjustment of asthma incidence, prevalence, and DALYs for worldwide demographic 
variation, no significant changes could be seen during the last 25 years, while 
asthma mortality significantly declined during the same period. Asthma incidence 
peaks before the age of 5 years, whereas prevalence and DALYs peaks are observed 
between 0 and 14 years. DALYs also display a second peak, between 45 and 74 
years. Asthma mortality increases with aging, reaching the peak after 80 years. 
The epidemiologic burden and mortality of asthma are constantly higher in women 
than in men. An inverse, highly significant correlation can be found between 
sociodemographic index and asthma incidence (r = -0.98) or mortality (r = 
-0.96).
CONCLUSION: Although the worldwide burden of asthma remains high, incidence and 
prevalence are not apparently translating into an escalating clinical and 
economic burden in terms of health loss and deaths.

OBJECTIVE: To know the key points of the diagnosis announcement for metastatic 
prostate cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Free interviews with patients and their relatives over a 
period of five years. Interviews in nurse out patient clinics, and coordination 
of complex care pathways with an active line of 350 patients per year.
RESULTS: The announcement of prostate cancer remains pejorative, regardless of 
the disease stage. It is even more traumatic when the patient has metastases, 
meaning for them, difficult days, heavy treatments and a considered compromised 
life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: The announcement program frames the management of patients. It 
allows to weight the impact of the initial trauma and establish between the 
patient and all the medical and paramedical teams a therapeutic pact that opens 
on a life project.

Gall bladder torsion: a disease of the elderly.

We describe the case of a gall bladder torsion in an elderly female patient, 
which was discovered during laparoscopic exploration for presumed acute 
cholecystitis. The rising incidence of this relatively uncommon process can be 
attributed to increasing life expectancy. Gall bladder torsion typically 
manifests in septuagenarians and octogenarians of the female gender, as seen in 
the presented case. It is thought that local mesenteric redundancy predisposes 
to the development of mechanical organoaxial torsion along the gall bladder's 
longitudinal axis involving the cystic duct and artery. Clinicians must have a 
high index of suspicion for gall bladder torsion, as a mimicker of acute 
cholecystitis, in the described patient demographic. Preoperative diagnosis is 
challenging with the vast majority of reported cases being diagnosed 
intraoperatively, and only five cases preoperatively. Prompt surgical 
intervention results in an overall mortality rate of approximately 5%, while a 
delay in diagnosis can lead to catastrophic patient outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Because spermatocytic tumors of the testis are rare, only limited 
evidence exists regarding the malignant potential and the optimal management of 
localized and metastatic disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review through MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Web of Science to identify 
reports including patients with testicular spermatocytic tumors.
RESULTS: From originally 7863 studies, we extracted data of 146 patients of 
which 99% were treated with radical orchiectomy. Metastases in patients with 
initially localised disease were diagnosed in 7% of patients and detected after 
a median follow-up of 5.5 months (range 2-21 months). Patients with aggressive 
histology (sarcoma or anaplastic subtype) were more likely to have metastatic 
disease (6/124 (5%) vs 9/22 (41%), p < 0.001). Patients with metastatic disease 
had larger primary tumors (92.5 vs 67.5 mm, p = 0.05). Life expectancy in 
patients with metastatic disease ranged from 1 to 25 months.
CONCLUSION: The published literature does neither support the use of testis 
sparing surgery nor adjuvant therapy. Patients with aggressive variants or 
larger tumors were more likely to have metastases and develop recurrences within 
the first few years. Patients with metastatic disease have a limited life 
expectancy and metastatic spermatocytic tumors are not as responsive to 
chemotherapy as germ cell cancers.

BACKGROUND: Almost 99% of pregnancy or childbirth-related complications globally 
is estimated to occur in developing regions. Yet, little is known about the 
demographic impact of maternal causes of death (COD) in low-and middle-income 
countries. Assuming that critical interventions were implemented such that 
maternal mortality is eradicated as a major cause of death, how would it 
translate to improved longevity for reproductive-aged women in the Kintampo 
districts of Ghana?
METHODS: The study used longitudinal health and demographic surveillance data 
from the Kintampo districts to assess the effect of hypothetically eradicating 
maternal COD on reproductive-aged life expectancy by applying multiple decrement 
and associated single decrement life table techniques.
RESULTS: According to the results, on the average, women would have lived an 
additional 4.4 years in their reproductive age if maternal mortality were 
eradicated as a cause of death, rising from an average of 28.7 years lived 
during the 2005-2014 period to 33.1 years assuming that maternal mortality was 
eradicated. The age patterns of maternal-related mortality and all-cause 
mortality depict that the maternal-related mortality is different from the 
all-cause mortality for women of reproductive age.
CONCLUSION: This observation suggests that other COD are competing with maternal 
mortality among the WRA in the study area and during the study period.

08006, Barcelona, Spain.

BACKGROUND: Cancer mortality is one of the major causes of productivity loss; 
and within all cancer sites, malignant neoplasms of the lung continue to be the 
principal cancer-related cause of death in Spain, with a survival rate of only 
10.7%. Thus its effects in labour productivity are a major concern and represent 
a great social impact. The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
productivity losses that occur as a result of premature deaths due to lung 
cancer in Spain.
METHODS: The human capital approach was used to calculate the costs derived from 
the premature mortality due to lung cancer, via the extraction of data on 
mortality, reference salaries and unemployment rates.
RESULTS: Deaths due to lung cancer represented the 28.90% and the 10.83% of all 
cancer-related deaths in 2017 in males and females respectively, with an 
increasing tendency in this last group. In addition, the YPPLL count increased 
in the study period among females. Lung cancer was responsible annually for 
60,846 YPPLL, and productivity losses summed €13.1 billion over the 10 year 
period.
CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of productivity losses due to lung cancer provides 
new information that may assist decision makers in the allocation of resources, 
reducing the burden it supposes in working-age individuals.

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that children become fatter and less fit 
over the summer holidays but get leaner and fitter during the in-school period. 
This could be due to differences in diet and time use between these distinct 
periods. Few studies have tracked diet and time use across the summer holidays. 
This study will measure rates of change in fatness and fitness of children, 
initially in Grade 4 (age 9 years) across three successive years and relate 
these changes to changes in diet and time use between in-school and summer 
holiday periods.
METHODS: Grade 4 Children attending Australian Government, Catholic and 
Independent schools in the Adelaide metropolitan area will be invited to 
participate, with the aim of recruiting 300 students in total. Diet will be 
reported by parents using the Automated Self-Administered 24-h Dietary 
Assessment Tool. Time use will be measured using 24-h wrist-worn accelerometry 
(GENEActiv) and self-reported by children using the Multimedia Activity Recall 
for Children and Adults (e.g. chores, reading, sport). Measurement of diet and 
time use will occur at the beginning (Term 1) and end (Term 4) of each school 
year and during the summer holiday period. Fitness (20-m shuttle run and 
standing broad jump) and fatness (body mass index z-score, waist circumference, 
%body fat) will be measured at the beginning and end of each school year. 
Differences in rates of change in fitness and fatness during in-school and 
summer holiday periods will be calculated using model parameter estimate 
contrasts from linear mixed effects model. Model parameter estimate contrasts 
will be used to calculate differences in rates of change in outcomes by 
socioeconomic position (SEP), sex and weight status. Differences in rates of 
change of outcomes will be regressed against differences between in-school and 
summer holiday period diet and time use, using compositional data analysis. 
Analyses will adjust for age, sex, SEP, parenting style, weight status, and 
pubertal status, where appropriate.
DISCUSSION: Findings from this project may inform new, potent avenues for 
intervention efforts aimed at addressing childhood fitness and fatness. 
Interventions focused on the home environment, or alternatively extension of the 
school environment may be warranted.

BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with stroke incidence and 
mortality. Distribution of stroke risk factors is changing worldwide; evidence 
on these trends is crucial to the allocation of resources for prevention 
strategies to tackle major modifiable risk factors with the highest impact on 
stroke burden.
METHODS: We extracted data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017. We analysed trends in global and SES-specific 
age-standardised stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost from 1990 to 2017. We also estimated 
the age-standardised attributable risk of stroke mortality associated with 
common risk factors in low-, low-middle-, upper-middle-, and high-income 
countries. Further, we explored the effect of age and sex on associations of 
risk factors with stroke mortality from 1990 to 2017.
RESULTS: Despite a growth in crude number of stroke events from 1990 to 2017, 
there has been an 11.3% decrease in age-standardised stroke incidence rate 
worldwide (150.5, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 140.3-161.8 per 100,000 in 
2017). This has been accompanied by an overall 3.1% increase in age-standardised 
stroke prevalence rate (1300.6, UI 1229.0-1374.7 per 100,000 in 2017) and a 
33.4% decrease in age-standardised stroke mortality rate (80.5, UI 78.9-82.6 per 
100,000 in 2017) over the same time period. The rising trends in 
age-standardised stroke prevalence have been observed only in middle-income 
countries, despite declining trends in age-standardised stroke incidence and 
mortality in all income categories since 2005. Further, there has been almost a 
34% reduction in stroke death rate (67.8, UI 64.1-71.1 per 100,000 in 2017) 
attributable to modifiable risk factors, more prominently in wealthier 
countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of stroke-related deaths are attributable to poor 
management of modifiable risk factors, and thus potentially preventable. We 
should appreciate societal barriers in lower-SES groups to design tailored 
preventive strategies. Despite improvements in general health knowledge, access 
to healthcare, and preventative strategies, SES is still strongly associated 
with modifiable risk factors and stroke burden; thus, screening of people from 
low SES at higher stroke risk is crucial.

BACKGROUND: Poststroke spasticity affects motor function and the ability to 
perform activities of daily living, with the potential to affect quality of life 
(QoL) and increase caregiver burden.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of repeated incobotulinumtoxinA treatment 
on spasticity-associated functional disability, caregiver burden, and QoL in the 
36-week open-label extension of the phase 3 PURE study (NCT01392300).
DESIGN: Open-label extension period of a prospective, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter study.
SETTING: Forty-six investigation sites in seven countries (Czech Republic, 
Germany, Hungary, India, Poland, Russia, United States).
PARTICIPANTS: Adults, aged 18-80 years, ≥12 months since last botulinum 
neurotoxin injection or entirely toxin naïve, with median poststroke upper-limb 
spasticity of >2 years' duration.
METHODS: Participants who completed the 12-week, double-blind main period could 
enter the open-label extension and receive up to three additional 
incobotulinumtoxinA treatments (fixed total dose 400 U at 12-week intervals) 
into the affected muscles of one upper limb.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional disability (Disability Assessment Scale; DAS), 
caregiver burden (Carer Burden Scale), and quality of life (QoL; EuroQol [EQ] 
5-dimensions three-level [EQ-5D-3L]).
RESULTS: The open-label extension included 296 treated patients. Mean DAS score 
for the principal target domain improved significantly from the main period 
baseline to the end-of-study visit (P < .0001). Carer Burden Scale scores also 
significantly improved from the main period baseline to the end-of-study visit 
(P < .05 for all caregiving activities except "applying a splint"). At the 
end-of-study visit, versus the main period baseline, 19.7%-33.3% of patients 
experienced improvements for each parameter on the EQ-5D-3L, except "mobility," 
with significant improvement in EQ-5D visual analog scale scores (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Repeated incobotulinumtoxinA treatments at 12-week intervals in 
participants with chronic poststroke upper-limb spasticity resulted in 
significant improvements in QoL, as well as significant reductions in upper-limb 
functional disability and caregiver burden.

IMPORTANCE: The DRCR Retina Network Protocol S randomized clinical trial 
suggested that the mean visual acuity of eyes with proliferative diabetic 
retinopathy (PDR) treated with ranibizumab is not worse at 5 years than that of 
eyes treated with panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). Moreover, the ranibizumab 
group had fewer new cases of diabetic macular edema (DME) with vision loss or 
vitrectomy but had 4 times the number of injections and 3 times the number of 
visits. Although 2-year cost-effectiveness results of Protocol S were previously 
identified, incorporating 5-year data from Protocol S could alter the 
longer-term cost-effectiveness of the treatment strategies from the perspective 
of the health care system.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 5- and 10-year cost-effectiveness of therapy with 
ranibizumab, 0.5 mg, compared with PRP for treating PDR.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A preplanned secondary analysis of the 
Protocol S randomized clinical trial using efficacy, safety, and resource 
utilization data through 5 years of follow-up for 213 adults diagnosed with PDR 
and simulating results through 10 years.
INTERVENTIONS: Intravitreous ranibizumab, 0.5 mg, at baseline and as frequently 
as every 4 weeks based on a structured retreatment protocol vs PRP at baseline 
for PDR; eyes in both groups could receive ranibizumab for concomitant DME with 
vision loss.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of 
ranibizumab therapy compared with PRP were evaluated for those with and without 
center-involved DME (CI-DME) and vision loss (Snellen equivalent, 20/32 or 
worse) at baseline.
RESULTS: The study included 213 adults with a mean (SD) age of 53 (12) years, of 
whom 92 (43%) were women and 155 (73%) were white. The ICER of the ranibizumab 
group compared with PRP for patients without CI-DME at baseline was $582 268 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) at 5 years and $742 202/QALY at 10 years. For 
patients with baseline CI-DME, ICERs were $65 576/QALY at 5 years and $63 
930/QALY at 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that during 5 to 10 years of 
treatment, ranibizumab, 0.5 mg, as given in the studied trial compared with PRP 
may be within the frequently cited range considered cost-effective in the United 
States for eyes presenting with PDR and vision-impairing CI-DME, but not for 
those with PDR but without vision-impairing CI-DME. Substantial reductions in 
anti-vascular endothelial growth factor cost may make the ranibizumab therapy 
cost-effective within this range even for patients without baseline CI-DME.

BACKGROUND: Neurologic disorders impose a heavy burden on healthcare in 
Singapore. To date, no data on the willingness to pay (WTP) for neurologic 
treatments has been reported in the local population.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify the value of various health domains to 
neuroscience patients and their caregivers by comparing their WTP for different 
types of treatments.
METHODS: A questionnaire using a mixed open-ended and closed-ended contingent 
valuation method was developed to elicit WTP and self-administered by 112 
visitors to a neuroscience outpatient clinic. The WTP for treatments in 3 health 
domains (advanced restoration of function, life extension, and cosmesis) was 
evaluated and compared. Subgroup regression analysis was performed to 
investigate the impact of demographic and socioeconomic factors.
RESULTS: Treatment that improved cosmesis had the highest median WTP of 
Singapore dollar (SGD) 35 000, followed by treatment that provided 1 year of 
life extension (SGD 20 000) and 1 year of advanced restored function (SGD 
10 000; P < .001). Respondents with a university education were willing to pay 
as much as 2 to 3 times of those without across all health domains.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to provide data on how different health 
domains are valued by neuroscience patients and caregivers in our population. 
Respondents valued treatment that restored or improved their physical 
appearances the most. These findings could contribute to future policies on the 
improvement of neuroscience care.

Mycosis Fungoides (MF) is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. 
Early stage patients are treated with topical therapies and have normal life 
expectancy whereas patients with advanced disease encounter frequent relapses 
and have a five-year survival rate that does not exceed 15%. The aim of the 
present study was to characterize the expression of microRNA-16 (miR-16) and 
microRNA-93 (miR-93) in early and advanced cases of MF in relation to the 
clinicopathological parameters. Ten skin biopsies of early and advanced MF were 
investigated for the expression of miR-16 and miR-93 using RT-PCR. 
Immunohistochemical expression of apoptosis markers (BCL-2 and Survivin) were 
also investigated in the studied cases compared to normal skin and eczema 
biopsies. In the present study, BCL-2 and Survivin showed strong positive 
expression on neoplastic lymphocytes in all cases of MF regardless of their 
stage. We have also shown that miR-16 was significantly upregulated in advanced 
cases of MF compared to cases with early disease (p-value was less than 0.05). 
However, expression of miR-16 did not show any statistically significant 
correlation with age, gender, or expression of apoptotic markers. On the other 
hand, the expression of miR-93 showed significant downregulation in all lymphoma 
cases irrespective of their stage, compared to normal and eczema cases. Our 
results suggest that upregulation of miR-16 could be used to predict an 
aggressive course of the disease. We also suggest that miR-93 downregulation 
could serve as possible tool for establishing early diagnosis in early 
challenging cases. Our findings also provide consistent evidence that the 
anti-apoptotic molecules may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this 
type of cutaneous lymphomas and promote the idea that their inhibition could be 
an interesting novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of MF.

BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of mortality and 
morbidity worldwide. Efficient use of resources is fundamental for best use of 
money among the available and novel treatment options for the management of 
pneumonia. The objective of this study was to systematically review the economic 
analysis of management strategies of pneumonia.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed using Academic Search Complete, 
MEDLINE, EconLit, Global health, MEDLINE complete and Embase databases using 
specific subject headings or key words in May 2018 without restricting 
publication year. All search results were recorded and any type of economic 
evaluation for management of CAP was included for detailed review. The 
Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist 
was used for quality appraisal.
RESULTS: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria; ten studies were trial 
based, five conducted analysis using model based techniques and the rest of the 
studies were either based on observational, record review or pre-post 
intervention studies. Most of the studies conducted cost-effectiveness analysis 
(n = 15) and compared different combinations of antimicrobials. Most were based 
on developed countries (n = 17), considered adult age groups (n = 16) and used a 
provider perspective (n = 14). Nine studies reported dominant alternatives 
(lower cost with higher benefit). Sensitivity analysis was performed by the 
majority of studies (n = 15). Fourteen studies were assessed as either being 
excellent, very good or good quality, with no relationship found between 
publication year and study quality. Methodological variation, type of microbial 
used, perspective, costs and outcome measures limit the compatibility among the 
results of the included studies.
CONCLUSION: Economic evaluation of interventions for management of CAP to date 
supports cost-effectiveness of studied interventions. However, evidence relates 
largely to antimicrobials choice in older populations in developed countries. 
Parallel economic evaluation of different management strategies of CAP is 
recommended for both developed and developing countries to support rigorous and 
robust comparative economic analysis within health care systems. PROSPERO

BACKGROUND: A pertussis outbreak occurred in Brazil from 2011 to 2014, despite 
high coverage of whole-cell pertussis containing vaccines in early childhood. 
Infants were the most affected. This study aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of introducing universal adult vaccination with Tdap into the 
National Immunization Program in Brazil.
METHODS: Economic evaluation using a dynamic model to compare two strategies: 
(1) universal vaccination with single dose of Tdap at 20 years of age and (2) 
current practice (only pregnant women pertussis vaccination). The health system 
perspective was adopted. Temporal horizon was 10 years. Discount rate of 5% was 
applied to costs and benefits. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was obtained from a 
population-based observational study. Epidemiological, resource utilization and 
cost estimates were obtained from the Brazilian Health Information Systems. The 
primary outcome was cost per life year saved (LYS), based on life expectancy at 
birth in Brazil in 2015. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analysis were 
performed.
RESULTS: Adult vaccination with VE of 82.6% and coverage of 40%, at price of 
US$7.01 per dose, and assuming herd protection would avoid 167 infant deaths by 
pertussis, saving 12,325 years of life and costing a total of US$105495891.61, 
from the health system perspective. The universal immunization would result in 
ICER of US$8459.13. The results were highly sensitive to disease incidence.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that universal adult vaccination with Tdap 
would not be a cost-effective intervention for preventing pertussis cases and 
deaths in infants in Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Stomach cancer is a major health problem in many countries. 
Understanding the current burden of stomach cancer and the differential trends 
across various locations is essential for formulating effective preventive 
strategies. We report on the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) due to stomach cancer in 195 countries and territories from 
21 regions between 1990 and 2017.
METHODS: Estimates from GBD 2017 were used to analyse the incidence, mortality, 
and DALYs due to stomach cancer at the global, regional, and national levels. 
The rates were standardised to the GBD world population and reported per 100 000 
population as age-standardised incidence rates, age-standardised death rates, 
and age-standardised DALY rates. All estimates were generated with 95% 
uncertainty intervals (UIs).
FINDINGS: In 2017, more than 1·22 million (95% UI 1·19-1·25) incident cases of 
stomach cancer occurred worldwide, and nearly 865 000 people (848 000-885 000) 
died of stomach cancer, contributing to 19·1 million (18·7-19·6) DALYs. The 
highest age-standardised incidence rates in 2017 were seen in the high-income 
Asia Pacific (29·5, 28·2-31·0 per 100 000 population) and east Asia (28·6, 
27·3-30·0 per 100 000 population) regions, with nearly half of the global 
incident cases occurring in China. Compared with 1990, in 2017 more than 356 000 
more incident cases of stomach cancer were estimated, leading to nearly 96 000 
more deaths. Despite the increase in absolute numbers, the worldwide 
age-standardised rates of stomach cancer (incidence, deaths, and DALYs) have 
declined since 1990. The drop in the disease burden was associated with improved 
Socio-demographic Index. Globally, 38·2% (21·1-57·8) of the age-standardised 
DALYs were attributable to high-sodium diet in both sexes combined, and 24·5% 
(20·0-28·9) of the age-standardised DALYs were attributable to smoking in males.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings provide insight into the changing burden of stomach 
cancer, which is useful in planning local strategies and monitoring their 
progress. To this end, specific local strategies should be tailored to each 
country's risk factor profile. Beyond the current decline in age-standardised 
incidence and death rates, a decrease in the absolute number of cases and deaths 
will be possible if the burden in east Asia, where currently almost half of the 
incident cases and deaths occur, is further reduced.
