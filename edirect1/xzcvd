The vast majority of thyroid cancers of follicular origin (TC) have a very 
favourable outcome, but 5-10% of cases will develop metastatic disease. Around 
60-70% of this subset, hence less than 5% of all patients with TC, will become 
radioiodine refractory (RAI-R), with a significant negative impact on prognosis 
and a mean life expectancy of 3-5 years. Since no European expert consensus or 
guidance for this challenging condition is currently available, a task force of 
TC experts was nominated by the European Thyroid Association (ETA) to prepare 
this document based on the principles of clinical evidence. The task force 
started to work in September 2018 and after several revision rounds, prepared a 
list of recommendations to support the treatment and follow-up of patients with 
advanced TC. Criteria for advanced RAI-R TC were proposed, and the most 
appropriate diagnostic tools and the local, systemic and palliative treatments 
are described. Systemic therapy with multikinase inhibitors is fully discussed, 
including recommendations on how to start it and at which dosage, on the 
duration of treatment, and on the management of side effects. The appropriate 
relationship between the specialist and the patient/family as well as ethical 
issues are covered. Based on the available studies and on personal experience, 
the experts provided 39 recommendations aimed to improve the management of 
advanced RAI-R TCs. Above all of them is the indication to treat and follow 
these patients in a specialized setting which allows the interaction between 
several specialists in a multidisciplinary team.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of cognitive 
rehabilitation for attention and memory problems in people with multiple 
sclerosis.
DESIGN: Multicentre, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: People with multiple sclerosis aged 18-69 years, who reported 
cognitive problems in daily life and had cognitive problems on standardized 
assessment.
INTERVENTIONS: A group cognitive rehabilitation programme delivered in 10 weekly 
sessions in comparison with usual care.
MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale 
Psychological subscale at 12 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes 
included measures of everyday memory problems, mood, fatigue, cognitive 
abilities and employment at 6 and 12 months after randomization.
RESULTS: In all, 245 participants were allocated to cognitive rehabilitation and 
204 to usual care. Mean Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale Psychological at 
12 months was 22.2 (SD = 6.1) for cognitive rehabilitation and 23.4 (SD = 6.0) 
for usual care group; adjusted difference -0.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 
-1.5 to 0.3, P = 0.20. No differences were observed in cognitive abilities, 
fatigue or employment. There were small differences in favour of cognitive 
rehabilitation for the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale Psychological at 6 months 
and everyday memory and mood at 6 and 12 months. There was no evidence of an 
effect on costs (-£808; 95% CI = -£2248 to £632) or on quality-adjusted life 
year gain (0.00; 95% CI = -0.01 to 0.02).
CONCLUSION: This rehabilitation programme had no long-term benefits on the 
impact of multiple sclerosis on quality of life, but there was some evidence of 
an effect on everyday memory problems and mood.

Aim: To assess the cost-effectiveness of CYP2D6*10 genetic testing for the 
management of Chinese women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer 
treated with selective estrogen receptor modulator. Methods: A Markov model was 
developed to evaluate a total expected cost and an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Robustness of the model was addressed in 
one-way analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: The cost of 
strategies of tamoxifen, toremifene without genotyping and the strategy base on 
CYP2D6*10 genotype were $63,879.19, $90,156.60 and $95,021.41, and the 
quality-adjusted life years gained are 8.1588, 12.89687 and 13.85911, 
respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the CYP2D6*10 testing 
versus toremifene were 5,055.74221/quality-adjusted life year, respectively. 
Conclusion:CYP2D6*10 pharmacogenetic-guided selective estrogen receptor 
modulator can be a cost-effective strategy in the Chinese patients with hormone 
receptor-positive breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pathological and radiological features, hormone 
profiles, surgery and treatment methods of metaplastic breast carcinoma cases 
diagnosed at our center in the light of current literature.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 38 metaplastic breast cancer cases diagnosed 
between 2006-2018 at our center were included in the study. The patients were 
evaluated in terms of age, tumor size, localization, histological grade, hormone 
profiles (ER, PR, Her2-neu), American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Tumor, 
Lymph node status, Metastases (TNM) stage, progression, survival, radiological 
features, types of surgery and therapy modalities (chemotherapy and / or 
radiotherapy).
RESULTS: The age of the patients ranged between 32 and 95 years. Pathological 
evaluation of cases showed that 14 were pure epithelial (IC-NST + squamous cell 
carcinoma) and 24 were metaplastic carcinomas with mesenchymal differentiation. 
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) was accompanying an invasive component in twenty 
cases. Seventeen patients had lymph node metastasis. Twelve patients developed 
distant metastasis. Thirty patients were triple negative for hormone receptors. 
The mean follow-up period of the patients was 34 months. The estimated life 
expectancy was 116 months. All of the patients received chemotherapy and 28 
patients received adjuvant radiotherapy. There was no correlation between tumor 
size and lymph node or distant metastasis in our series. Our findings are 
consistent with the literature.
CONCLUSION: Metaplastic breast carcinoma is a rare entity among breast 
carcinomas. Metaplastic carcinomas of the breast draw attention with the 
differences in their clinical course and the radiological and pathological 
heterogeneity.

Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the current strategy combining 
universal vaccination with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) treatment for 
infants of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive mothers compared with 
universal vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine only.Methods: A decision tree 
model with a Markov process was constructed and used to simulate the lifetime of 
the birth cohort in Zhejiang Province during 2016. The current strategy was 
compared against universal vaccination with respect to costs and health effects. 
Costs were assessed from the health care system perspective. Health effects were 
measured by the number of hepatitis B virus (HBV) related diseases and deaths 
avoided and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. The incremental 
cost‑effectiveness ratio (ICER) is calculated and compared to standard 
willingness-to-pay thresholds. A one-way sensitivity analysis and a 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were performed to assess parameter 
uncertainties.Results: Over the cohort's lifetime, 182 acute symptomatic 
infections, 2215 chronic infections, 872 cases of cirrhosis, 595 cases of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 1,350 HBV-related deaths among the cohort of 
624,000 infants would be further avoided by the current strategy compared to 
universal vaccination. Universal vaccination was dominated by the current 
strategy that produced not only higher total QALYs, but also had lower costs. 
The results remained robust over a wide range of assumptions.Conclusions: The 
current strategy was cost saving compared to universal vaccination, and 
continuing the current strategy is recommended to further decrease the burden of 
hepatitis B.

IMPORTANCE: US life expectancy has not kept pace with that of other wealthy 
countries and is now decreasing.
OBJECTIVE: To examine vital statistics and review the history of changes in US 
life expectancy and increasing mortality rates; and to identify potential 
contributing factors, drawing insights from current literature and an analysis 
of state-level trends.
EVIDENCE: Life expectancy data for 1959-2016 and cause-specific mortality rates 
for 1999-2017 were obtained from the US Mortality Database and CDC WONDER, 
respectively. The analysis focused on midlife deaths (ages 25-64 years), 
stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography 
(including the 50 states). Published research from January 1990 through August 
2019 that examined relevant mortality trends and potential contributory factors 
was examined.
FINDINGS: Between 1959 and 2016, US life expectancy increased from 69.9 years to 
78.9 years but declined for 3 consecutive years after 2014. The recent decrease 
in US life expectancy culminated a period of increasing cause-specific mortality 
among adults aged 25 to 64 years that began in the 1990s, ultimately producing 
an increase in all-cause mortality that began in 2010. During 2010-2017, midlife 
all-cause mortality rates increased from 328.5 deaths/100 000 to 348.2 
deaths/100 000. By 2014, midlife mortality was increasing across all racial 
groups, caused by drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, suicides, and a diverse list of 
organ system diseases. The largest relative increases in midlife mortality rates 
occurred in New England (New Hampshire, 23.3%; Maine, 20.7%; Vermont, 19.9%) and 
the Ohio Valley (West Virginia, 23.0%; Ohio, 21.6%; Indiana, 14.8%; Kentucky, 
14.7%). The increase in midlife mortality during 2010-2017 was associated with 
an estimated 33 307 excess US deaths, 32.8% of which occurred in 4 Ohio Valley 
states.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: US life expectancy increased for most of the past 60 
years, but the rate of increase slowed over time and life expectancy decreased 
after 2014. A major contributor has been an increase in mortality from specific 
causes (eg, drug overdoses, suicides, organ system diseases) among young and 
middle-aged adults of all racial groups, with an onset as early as the 1990s and 
with the largest relative increases occurring in the Ohio Valley and New 
England. The implications for public health and the economy are substantial, 
making it vital to understand the underlying causes.

(1)Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, John A. Moran Eye Center, 
University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review various techniques of manual small incision 
cataract surgery (MSICS), updates on training residents and fellows, and 
cost-effectiveness of the surgery.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent population studies estimate that there are 53 million 
people blind worldwide from cataracts, up from previous figures. This is in part 
because of population growth and increased life expectancy worldwide. MSICS 
continues to play a significant role in addressing cataract burden and there is 
an increasing need to train surgeons in the technique. In response to this need, 
several modules and rubrics have been developed to assist in the training 
process.
SUMMARY: MSICS has been refined over recent decades with overall outcomes 
comparable to phacoemulsification (phaco) in certain settings. MSICS cost and 
efficiency advantages support its ongoing essential role in addressing global 
cataract blindness.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Anbainuo (ABN) 
plus methotrexate (MTX) (ABN + MTX) versus conventional disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.Forty-eight 
moderate to severe RA patients underwent ABN + MTX or cDMARDs treatment were 
consecutively enrolled and assigned to ABN + MTX group (n = 26) and control 
group (n = 22). Patients were followed up and their disease activity and quality 
of life (QoL) were evaluated at 3rd month, 6th month and 12th month after 
initiation of treatment. Treatment costs of 2 groups were calculated, then 
pharmacoeconomic analysis was performed.ABN + MTX increased drug cost and total 
cost while decreased indirect cost compared with cDMARDs after 12-month 
treatment. ABN + MTX group gained additional 0.22 quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY) and yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ¥104,293.6 
per QALY after treatment. Sensitivity analysis reveals that rising ABN price by 
20% produced an ICER of ¥130,403.6 per QALY, which was still lower than 3 times 
of the mean gross domestic product (GDP) per capita during the same period in 
China (¥165,960). Besides, ABN + MTX was more cost-effective in severe RA 
patients compared to moderate RA patients.ABN + MTX is cost-effective in 
treating moderate to severe RA patients compared with cDMARDs, although the 
total cost of ABN + MTX is relatively higher.

BACKGROUND: Opioid addiction is a major public health threat to healthy life 
expectancy; however, little is known of long-term mortality for mothers with 
opioid use in pregnancy. Pregnancy and delivery care are opportunities to 
improve access to addiction and supportive services. Treating neonatal 
abstinence syndrome (NAS) as a marker of opioid use during pregnancy, this study 
reports long-term maternal mortality among mothers with a birth affected by NAS 
in relation to that of mothers without a NAS-affected birth in 2 high-prevalence 
jurisdictions, England and Ontario, Canada.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a population-based study using linked 
administrative health data to develop parallel cohorts of mother-infant dyads in 
England and Ontario between 2002 and 2012. The study population comprised 13,577 
and 4,966 mothers of infants with NAS and 4,205,675 and 929,985 control mothers 
in England and Ontario, respectively. Death records captured all-cause maternal 
mortality after delivery through March 31, 2016, and cause-specific maternal 
mortality to December 31, 2014. The primary exposure was a live birth of an 
infant with NAS, and the main outcome was all deaths among mothers following 
their date of delivery. We modelled the association between NAS and all-cause 
maternal mortality using Cox regression, and the cumulative incidence of 
cause-specific mortality within a competing risks framework. All-cause mortality 
rates, 10-year cumulative incidence risk of death, and crude and age-adjusted 
hazard ratios were calculated. Estimated crude 10-year mortality based on 
Kaplan-Meier curves in mothers of infants with NAS was 5.1% (95% CI 4.7%-5.6%) 
in England and 4.6% (95% CI 3.8%-5.5%) in Ontario versus 0.4% (95% CI 
0.41%-0.42%) in England and 0.4% (95% CI 0.38%-0.41%) in Ontario for controls (p 
< 0.001 for all comparisons). Survival curves showed no clear inflection point 
or period of heightened risk. The crude hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 
12.1 (95% 11.1-13.2; p < 0.001) in England and 11.4 (9.7-13.4; p < 0.001) in 
Ontario; age adjustment did not reduce the hazard ratios. The cumulative 
incidence of death was higher among NAS mothers than controls for almost all 
causes of death. The majority of deaths were by avoidable causes, defined as 
those that are preventable, amenable to care, or both. Limitations included lack 
of direct measures of maternal opioid use, other substance misuse, and 
treatments or supports received.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that approximately 1 in 20 mothers of 
infants with NAS died within 10 years of delivery in both England and Canada-a 
mortality risk 11-12 times higher than for control mothers. Risk of death was 
not limited to the early postpartum period targeted by most public health 
programs. Policy responses to the current opioid epidemic require effective 
strategies for long-term support to improve the health and welfare of 
opioid-using mothers and their children.

INTRODUCTION: Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin care bundles (e.g. 
genotyping, patient self-testing or self-management) are alternatives to usual 
warfarin care for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). 
We aim to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of NOACs and warfarin care bundles in 
patients with AF in a middle-income country, Thailand.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate the economic and 
treatment outcomes of warfarin care bundles and NOACs compared with usual 
warfarin care. Cost-effectiveness was assessed from a societal perspective over 
a lifetime horizon with 3% discount rate in a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old 
atrial fibrillation patients. Input parameters were derived from published 
literature, meta-analysis and local data when available. The outcome measure was 
incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained (ICER).
RESULTS: Using USD5104 as the threshold of willingness-to-pay per QALY, 
patient's self-management of warfarin was cost-effective when compared to usual 
warfarin care, with an ICER of USD1395/QALY from societal perspective. All NOACs 
were not cost-effective in Thailand, with ICER ranging from USD8678 to 
USD14,247/QALY. When compared to the next most effective intervention, patient's 
self-testing and genotype-guided warfarin dosing were dominated. In the 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, patient's self-management had the 
highest probability of being cost-effective in Thailand, approximately 78%. 
Results were robust over a range of inputs in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: In Thailand, NOACs were unlikely to be cost-effective at current 
prices. Conversely, patient's self-management is a highly cost-effective 
intervention and may be considered for adoption in developing regions with 
resource-limited healthcare systems.

We present a simple extension in which a single parameter tunes the dynamics of 
cellular automata (CA) by consequently expanding their discrete state space into 
a Cantor set. Such an implementation serves as a potent platform for further 
investigation of several emergent phenomena, including deterministic phase 
transitions, pattern formation, autocatalysis, and self-organization. We first 
apply this approach to Conway's Game of Life and observe sudden changes in the 
asymptotic dynamics of the system accompanied by the emergence of complex 
propagators. Incorporation of the new state space with system features is used 
to explain the transitions and formulate the tuning parameter range where the 
propagators adaptively survive by investigating their autocatalytic local 
interactions. Similar behavior is present when the same recipe is applied to 
Rule 90, an outer totalistic elementary one-dimensional cellular automaton. In 
addition, the latter case shows that deterministic transitions between classes 
of CA can be achieved by tuning a single parameter continuously.

Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: People with early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) seem to suffer 
greater impact. But there is a lack of population-based studies on loss of life 
expectancy (LE) and lifetime healthcare costs.
OBJECTIVES: We conducted this study to estimate LE, expected years of life lost 
(EYLL), and lifetime healthcare costs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Taiwan 
stratified by onset age and gender, using a method which integrates the product 
of the survival function and the mean cost function over a lifetime horizon.
METHODS: We linked the National Health Insurance datasets with the National 
Mortality Registry and extrapolated the survival to lifetime to estimate the 
mean cumulative costs since the date of the first AD diagnosis using medical 
claims between 2001 and 2012.
RESULTS: A total of 21,615 mild to moderate AD patients (including 20,358 
late-onset (LOAD) and 1,257 EOAD) were recruited. The average onset age for EOAD 
was 61 years old, while that of LOAD was 78. Although the LE of EOAD was 4.8 
years longer than that of LOAD due to younger age, the EYLL for the former was 
8.7 years versus 1.7 years for the latter. EOAD also had higher lifetime 
healthcare costs than the LOAD group (USD$37,957±2,403 versus 33,809±786).
CONCLUSIONS: Since EOAD patients had both higher EYLL and lifetime healthcare 
costs than LOAD, future studies should pay more attention to the needs of EOAD 
patients.

BACKGROUND: One of the main objectives of the food industry is the shelf life 
extension of food products, taking into account the safety requirements and the 
preference of consumers attracted by a simple and clear label. Following this 
direction, many researchers look to find out antimicrobials from natural 
sources.
METHODS: Tomato, carrot, and melon by-products were used as substrates for 
lactic acid fermentation using seven strains belonging to the Lactobacillus 
genus, L. plantarum, L. casei, L. paracasei, and L. rhamnosus. The obtained 
fermented by-products were then extracted and the antimicrobial activity toward 
fourteen pathogenic strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., 
Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus Aureus, and Bacillus cereus was tested through 
agar well diffusion assay.
RESULTS: All the extracts obtained after fermentation had highlighted 
antimicrobial activity against each pathogen tested. In particular, a more 
effective activity was observed against Salmonella spp., L. monocytogenes, S. 
aureus, and B. cereus, while a lower activity was observed against E. coli.
CONCLUSION: Lactic acid fermentation of vegetable by-products can be a good 
strategy to obtain antimicrobials useful in food biopreservation.

How Energy Consumption and Pollutant Emissions Affect the Disparity of Public 
Health in Countries with High Fossil Energy Consumption.

Public health issues are a global focus, but recent research on the links 
between fossil energy consumption, pollutant emissions, and public health in 
different regions have presented inconsistent conclusions. In order to quantify 
the effect of fossil energy use and pollutant emissions on public health from 
the global perspective, this paper investigates 33 countries with high GDP and 
fossil energy consumption from 1995 to 2015 using a fixed effect model. Further, 
this paper utilizes heterogeneity analysis to characterize the disparity of 
countries with different features. Empirical results indicate that total fossil 
energy consumption is beneficial to the life expectancy of the population (LEP), 
but pollutant emissions (PM10 concentration and greenhouse gas scale) have a 
negative effect on LEP. Moreover, the heterogeneity test indicates that 
pollutant emissions lowers LEP in net energy importers more than in net energy 
exporters, and the effect of such emissions in low- and middle-income countries 
on public health is more harmful than that in high-income countries. These 
findings suggest that it is a greater priority for governments to strengthen the 
control of pollutant emissions through enhancing the efficiency of energy 
consumption, rather than by reducing its scale of use in low- and middle-income, 
and net energy importing countries. Additionally, governments also need to focus 
on the volatility of pollutant emissions in high-income countries with necessary 
control measures.

HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa: Where Are We Today? Abstract. In sub-Saharan Africa 
the HIV epidemic has changed remarkedly due to expanded testing and easier 
access to antiretroviral medication. The rate of new infections has decreased 
substantially since 2005, the life expectancy of people living with HIV has 
increased and the mortality rate has declined. Yet still a lot needs to be 
achieved to stop the ongoing epidemic. Women are still at a higher risk to get 
infected and stigma and discrimination are a hindrance to further reduce the 
incidence. Challenges like the lack of technical capacities, especially to 
perform viral load and resistance testing, refusal of testing or condom use and 
increasing drug resistance to first-line therapies jeopardize the goal of 
90-90-90: 90 % of people tested, 90 % of positives under care and 90 % of 
treated persons virologically controlled. New testing strategies and medication 
with higher efficacies which, when taken regularly, stop the transmission 
completely, provide hope in the fight against HIV.

Publisher: Zusammenfassung. In den vergangenen 15 Jahren hat sich die 
HIV-Epidemie in Subsahara-Afrika durch den verbesserten Zugang zu HIV-Tests und 
antiretroviralen Medikamenten deutlich verändert. Die Zahl der jährlichen 
Neuinfektionen ist seit 2005 stark rückläufig, die Lebenserwartung von Menschen 
mit HIV ist gestiegen und die Anzahl der jährlichen Todesfälle ist gesunken. 
Allerdings haben Frauen weiterhin ein ungleich hohes Risiko, sich anzustecken, 
und Stigma und Diskriminierung erschweren das Senken der Infektionsraten. 
Herausforderungen wie der Mangel an adäquater technischer Ausstattung vor allem 
zum Bestimmen der Viruslast, Skepsis gegenüber Tests und Gebrauch von 
mechanischer Verhütung sowie Zunahme der Resistenzen gegen die 
Erstlinientherapie stehen dem Ende der Epidemie im Weg. Dennoch schaffen neue 
Teststrategien und Therapien mit höherer Effektivität, die – wenn zuverlässig 
eingenommen – die Virus-Übertragung verhindern, neue Hoffnung im Kampf gegen das 
Virus.

BACKGROUND: In Norway, changes in life expectancy have led to increased 
attention to older people who are ageing at home, by means of home care 
services, adapted technology and informal caregivers. The caring situation has 
become difficult for many caregivers. The use of telecare has now offered them 
the possibility to receive support at home. The purpose of this study was to 
explore how nurses provide support and care at a distance, using a web camera 
and a web forum in a closed telecare network for caregivers to persons suffering 
from stroke and dementia.
METHODS: The study had an explorative design with a qualitative approach. The 
data sources consisted of interviews with nurses and excerpts from posts in a 
closed telecare network. Content analysis was used to analyse the text from the 
interviews and the text from the web forum.
RESULTS: The main theme, "Balancing asymmetric and symmetric relationships" 
described nurses' relationship with caregiver. Two categories, "Balancing 
personal and professional qualities" and "Balancing caregivers' dependence 
versus independence" were identified. The first describing the tension in their 
dialogue, the second describing how nurses provided the caregivers with a sense 
of security as well as strengthening them to master their daily lives.
CONCLUSIONS: The nurses provided long distance support and care for the 
caregivers, by using computer-meditated communication. This communication was 
characterized by closeness as well as empathy. To strengthen the caregivers' 
competence and independence, the nurses were easy accessible and provided 
virtual supervision and support. This study increases the knowledge about online 
dialogues and relationship between nurses and caregivers. It contributes to 
knowledge about balancing in the relationship, as well as knowledge about 
bridging the gap between technologies and nursing care as potential conflicting 
dimensions. Maintenance of ethical principles are therefore critical to be aware 
of.

BackgroundHealthcare-associated infections (HAIs) pose a major challenge to 
health systems. Burden of disease estimations in disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) are useful for comparing and ranking HAIs.AimTo estimate the 
number of five common HAIs, their attributable number of deaths and burden for 
Germany.MethodsWe developed a new method and R package that builds on the 
approach used by the Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) project 
to estimate the burden of HAIs for individual countries. We used data on 
healthcare-associated Clostridioides difficile infection, healthcare-associated 
pneumonia, healthcare-associated primary bloodstream infection, 
healthcare-associated urinary tract infection and surgical-site infection, which 
were collected during the point prevalence survey of HAIs in European acute-care 
hospitals between 2011 and 2012.ResultsWe estimated 478,222 (95% uncertainty 
interval (UI): 421,350-537,787) cases for Germany, resulting in 
16,245 (95% UI: 10,863-22,756) attributable deaths and 
248,920 (95% UI: 178,693-336,239) DALYs. Despite the fact that Germany has a 
relatively low hospital prevalence of HAIs compared with the European 
Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) average, the burden of HAIs in 
Germany (308.2 DALYs/100,000 population; 95% UI: 221.2-416.3) was higher than 
the EU/EEA average (290.0 DALYs/100,000 population; 95% UI: 214.9-376.9). Our 
methodology is applicable to other countries in or outside of the EU/EEA. An R 
package is available from https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BHAI.ConclusionThis 
is the first study to estimate the burden of HAIs in DALYs for Germany. The 
large number of hospital beds may be a contributing factor for a relatively high 
burden of HAIs in Germany. Further focus on infection prevention control, paired 
with reduction of avoidable hospital stays, is needed to reduce the burden of 
HAIs in Germany.

Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is the most prevalent cause of advanced 
liver disease and liver cirrhosis in Europe, including Spain. According to the 
World Health Organization the fraction of liver cirrhosis attributable to 
alcohol use in Spain is 73.8% among men and 56.3% among women. ARLD includes 
various stages such as steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. In 
addition, patients with underlying ARLD and heavy alcohol intake may develop 
alcoholic hepatitis, which is associated with high mortality. To date, the only 
effective treatment to treat ARLD is prolonged withdrawal. There are no specific 
treatments, and the only treatment that increases life expectancy in alcoholic 
hepatitis is prednisolone. For patients with alcoholic hepatitis who do not 
respond to treatment, some centres offer the possibility of an early transplant. 
These clinical practice guidelines aim to propose recommendations on ARLD taking 
into account their relevance as a cause of advanced chronic liver disease and 
liver cirrhosis in our setting. This paper aims to answer the key questions for 
the clinical practice of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, as well as Internal 
Medicine and Primary Health Centres, making the most up-to-date information 
regarding the management and treatment of ARLD available to health 
professionals. These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the 
clinical management of this disease.

BACKGROUND: Understanding patient perceptions of their spiritual needs when 
approaching the end of life is essential to support the delivery of 
patient-centred care.
AIM: To conduct a qualitative evidence synthesis on spirituality and spiritual 
care needs at the end of life in all healthcare settings from the patients' 
perspective.
DESIGN: Studies were included where they were primary qualitative studies 
exploring spirituality in patients with a life expectancy of 12 months or less 
in any setting. Two reviewers independently screened titles, extracted data and 
conducted methodological quality appraisal. A thematic synthesis was conducted. 
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) - 
Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (CERQual) was 
used to summarise the certainty of the evidence.
DATA SOURCES: Six databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, PsycINFO, 
Applied Social Science Index and Abstracts) were searched from inception up to 
January 2019.
RESULTS: Fifty papers (42 unique datasets), incorporating data from 710 patients 
were included. Studies recruited from a mix of inpatient, outpatient, hospice 
and community settings across 12 different countries. Three overarching themes 
were generated: the concept of spirituality, spiritual needs and distress, and 
spiritual care resources. Relationships were an intrinsic component of 
spirituality.
CONCLUSION: Meeting patients' spiritual needs is an integral part of end-of-life 
care. This work emphasises that supporting relationships should be a central 
focus of spiritual care for patients at the end of life.
