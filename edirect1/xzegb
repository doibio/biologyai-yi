3,548 adult respondents, selected from 5 different states of India using a 
multistage stratified random sampling technique. A novel extended EQ-VT design 
was created that included 18 blocks of 10 health states, comprising 150 unique 
health states and 135 observations per health state. In addition to the standard 
EQ-VT design, which is based on 86 health states and 100 observations per health 
state, 3 extended designs were assessed for their predictive performance. The 
extended designs were created by 1) increasing the number of observations per 
health state in the design, 2) increasing the number of health states in the 
design, and 3) implementing both 1) and 2) at the same time. Subsamples of the 
data set were created for separate designs. The root mean squared error (RMSE) 
and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to measure the predictive accuracy of 
the conventional and extended designs.
RESULTS: The average RMSE and MAE for the standard EQ-VT design were 0.055 and 
0.041, respectively, for the 150 health states. All 3 types of design extensions 
showed lower RMSE and MAE values as compared with the standard design and hence 
yielded better predictive performance. RMSE and MAE were lowest (0.051 and 
0.039, respectively) for the designs that use a greater number of health states. 
Extending the design with inclusion of more health states was shown to improve 
the predictive performance even when the sample size was fixed at 1,000.
CONCLUSION: Although the standard EQ-VT design performs well, its prediction 
accuracy can be further improved by extending its design. The addition of more 
health states in EQ-VT is more beneficial than increasing the number of 
observations per health state.
HIGHLIGHTS: The EQ-5D-5L value sets are developed using the standardized EuroQol 
Valuation Technology (EQ-VT) protocol. This is the first study to empirically 
assess how much can be gained from extending the standard EQ-VT design in terms 
of sample size and/or health states. It not only presents useful insights into 
the performance of the standard design of the EQ-VT but also tests the potential 
extensions in the standard EQ-VT design in terms of increasing the health states 
to be directly valued as well as the number of observations recorded to predict 
the utility value of each of these health states.The study demonstrates that the 
standard EQ-VT design performs good, and an extension in the design of the 
standard EQ-VT can lead to further improvement in its performance. The addition 
of more health states in EQ-VT is more beneficial than increasing the number of 
observations per health state. Extending the design with inclusion of more 
health states marginally improves the predictive performance even when the 
sample size was fixed at 1,000.The findings of the study will streamline the 
systematic process for generating precise EQ-5D-5L value sets, thus facilitating 
the conduct of credible, transparent, and robust outcome valuation in health 
technology assessments.

Pelvic actinomycosis with an intrauterine device accounts for approximately 3% 
of all actinomycoses. It is a chronic infectious disease characterized by 
infiltrative, suppurative, or granulomatous inflammation, sinus fistula 
formation, and extensive fibrosis, and caused by filamentous, gram-positive, 
anaerobic bacteria called Actinomyces israelii. The slow and silent progression 
favors pseudo tumor pelvic extension and exposes the patient to acute 
life-threatening complications, namely colonic occlusion with hydronephrosis. 
Preoperative diagnosis is often difficult due to the absence of specific 
symptomatology and pathognomonic radiological signs simulating pelvic cancer. We 
discuss the case of a 67-year-old woman who complained of pelvic pain, 
constipation, and weight loss for 4 months, and who presented to the emergency 
department with a picture of colonic obstruction and a biological inflammatory 
syndrome. The computed tomography scan revealed a suspicious heterogeneous 
pelvic mass infiltrating the uterus with an intrauterine device, the sigmoid 
with extensive upstream colonic distension, and right hydronephrosis. The 
patient underwent emergency surgery with segmental colonic resection and 
temporary colostomy, followed by antibiotic therapy. The favorable clinical and 
radiological evolution under prolonged antibiotic therapy with the almost total 
disappearance of the pelvic pseudo tumor infiltration confirms the diagnosis of 
pelvic actinomycosis and thus makes it possible to avoid an extensive and 
mutilating surgery with important morbidity.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is the world's leading cause of death and a key hindrance to 
extending life expectancy. Celastrol, a bioactive compound derived from 
Tripterygium wilfordii, has been shown to have excellent antitumor activity, but 
its poor solubility and severe organ toxicity side effects have hampered its 
clinical application.
METHODS: In this study, a self-assembled nanodrug (PLC-NP) was designed to 
deliver celastrol to tumor sites while efficiently reducing its side effects by 
conjugating celastrol with the bioactive material LMWH and P-selectin targeting 
peptide (PSN). Extensive in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to 
investigate both therapeutic efficacy and adverse effects. Furthermore, the 
specific mechanism of the antitumor activity has also been explored.
FINDING: The PLC-NP nanodrugs were spherical in shape, with a mean particle size 
of 115.83 ± 6.93 nm. PLC-NP was sufficiently stable during blood circulation, 
with a selective target to P-selectin-highly expressed tumor cells, followed by 
releasing the containing celastrol under acidic environment and high levels of 
esterase in tumor cells. Both in vitro and in vivo results confirmed that 
celastrol's antitumor and anti-metastatic abilities were not attenuated and were 
actually strengthened after being formed into nanodrugs. More importantly, the 
organ toxicities of the modified celastrol nanodrug were dramatically reduced. 
Mechanistic study indicated that the inactivation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling 
pathway and ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction play critical roles in 
celastrol-mediated autophagy and apoptosis.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings could offer a potential strategy for the 
translation of toxic compounds into clinical therapeutic nanomedicine.

OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Despite its high prevalence, little information is 
available about the course of insomnia symptoms over the life span. In this 
study, we analyzed the self-reported insomnia symptoms of the general population 
over more than 20 years, covering young up to middle adulthood.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Data from waves 12 to 32 of the Saxon Longitudinal Study 
(1996-2021), were analyzed. Based on data from the 12th wave, n = 115 adults (48 
men (41.7%), 67 women (58.3%), Mage = 23.59, SD = 0.59) completed the G-Score 
Item #3 in the following 18 waves, thus forming the basis for our analyses. The 
G-Score Item #3 reads "In the last 12 months, have you had the following 
complaints? Please indicate how often they occurred - Insomnia". The G-Score 
Item #3 was dichotomized using a cut-off score of 2, and prevalence and 
incidence rates were calculated by gender.
RESULTS: The minimum prevalence rate was 23.48% (Mage = 32.11, SD = 0.40), and 
the maximum was 47.83% (Mage = 48.43, SD = 0.64), indicating an increase in 
insomnia symptoms with age. In most cases, no evidence was found for gender 
differences in prevalence rates. The incidence rates were 10.43% for the 1st 
year of follow-up and 8.7% for the 5th year and 6th year of follow-up, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence for the high prevalence rates 
of insomnia symptoms in the general population. As this study is the first 
epidemiological study of insomnia symptoms based on a single-item (screening) 
instrument, it should be rather seen as an extension than a replication of 
previous study findings.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) plays a pivotal diagnostic role in 
myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA). To date, a 
prognostic stratification of these patients is still lacking.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the prognostic role of CMR in MINOCA.
METHODS: The authors assessed 437 MINOCA from January 2017 to October 2021. They 
excluded acute myocarditis, takotsubo syndromes, cardiomyopathies, and other 
nonischemic etiologies. Patients were classified into 3 subgroups according to 
the CMR phenotype: 1) presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and abnormal 
mapping (M) values (LGE+/M+); 2) regional ischemic injury with abnormal mapping 
and no LGE (LGE-/M+); and 3) nonpathological CMRs (LGE-/M-). The primary outcome 
was the presence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The mean 
follow-up was 33.7 ± 12.0 months and CMR was performed on average at 4.8 ± 
1.5 days from the acute presentation.
RESULTS: The final cohort included 198 MINOCA; 116 (58.6%) comprised the LGE+/M+ 
group. During follow-up, MACE occurred significantly more frequently in MINOCA 
LGE+/M+ than in the LGE+/M- and normal-CMR (LGE-/M-) subgroups (20.7% vs 6.7% 
and 2.7%; P = 0.006). The extension of myocardial damage at CMR was 
significantly greater in patients who developed MACE. In multivariable Cox 
regression, %LGE was an independent predictor of MACE (HR: 1.123 [95% CI: 
1.064-1.185]; P < 0.001) together with T2 mapping values (HR: 1.190 [95% CI: 
1.145-1.237]; P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In MINOCA with early CMR execution, the %LGE and abnormal T2 
mapping values were identified as independent predictors of adverse cardiac 
events at ∼3.0 years of follow-up. These parameters can be considered as 
high-risk markers in MINOCA.

Withania Somnifera (WS) is a popular nutritional supplement in the USA, Europe, 
and Asia, known for its pharmacological effects on neurological disorders. 
However, the bioanalytical method development, validation, and pharmacokinetics 
of WS NMITLI-118R AF1 biomarkers Withanolide A (WLD A), Withanone (WNONE), 
Withanolide B (WLD B), Withaferin A (WF A), and 12 Deoxywithastramonolide (12 
DEOXY) in rats have not been comprehensively explored. This study aimed to 
develop and validate a sensitive and selective LC-ESI-MS/MS method for these 
biomarkers in male Sprague Dawley rats plasma and brain matrix. Rats were 
divided into eight groups, each containing five rats. A plant extract of 
NMITLI-118R AF1 at 50 mg/kg was orally administered to the rats for in-vivo 
pharmacokinetic investigation. All the analytes had a linear calibration curve 
(r2 > 0.999), and intra-day and inter-day precision (%) were found in the range 
of 2.46 - 13.71% and accuracy were within the acceptable range (±15%). The 
biomarkers of NMITLI-118R AF1 were found stable in in-vitro plasma and simulated 
gastro-intestinal fluids. The observed (Cmax) and (Tmax) values for the 
biomarkers in the systemic circulation were WLD A (5.59 ± 0.34 ng/mL, Tmax 
1.00 ± 0.00 h), WNONE (6.28 ± 0.41 ng/mL, Tmax 0.95 ± 0.11 h), WLD B 
(6.45 ± 2.87 ng/mL, Tmax 0.95 ± 0.11 h), WF A (6.50 ± 0.27 ng/mL, Tmax 
1.00 ± 0.00 h), and 12 DEOXY (5.68 ± 0.39 ng/mL, Tmax 1.00 ± 0.00 h). In 
contrast to the old method, our approach exhibits a lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ), shorter run time (less than10 min), and enables the 
detection of WF A and WNONE in fresh rat plasma by other quantitative analysis 
of mass spectrometry (m/z) [M]+. Shows high sample volumes for both, larger 
plasma volumes, costlier sample collection techniques dried blood spot (DBS), 
more expensive solid phase extraction techniques (SPE) and longer analysis time 
14 min. Moreover, our method requires a smaller sample volume 10 µL, offers 
faster analysis time 4 min, and achieves a higher sensitivity 1 ng/mL. This is 
the first report of a comprehensive study on in-vitro and in-vivo 
pharmacokinetics of NMITLI-118R AF1 biomarkers, which may aid in further 
pre-clinical and clinical trial investigations.

Oxidation of PUFAs in LDLs trapped in the arterial intima plays a critical role 
in atherosclerosis. Though there have been many studies on the atherogenicity of 
oxidized derivatives of PUFA-esters of cholesterol, the effects of cholesteryl 
hemiesters (ChEs), the oxidation end products of these esters, have not been 
studied. Through lipidomics analyses, we identified and quantified two ChE types 
in the plasma of CVD patients and identified four ChE types in human 
endarterectomy specimens. Cholesteryl hemiazelate (ChA), the ChE of azelaic acid 
(n-nonane-1,9-dioic acid), was the most prevalent ChE identified in both cases. 
Importantly, human monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and neutrophils 
exhibit inflammatory features when exposed to subtoxic concentrations of ChA 
in vitro. ChA increases the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as 
interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 and modulates the surface-marker profile of 
monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophage. In vivo, when zebrafish larvae were 
fed with a ChA-enriched diet, they exhibited neutrophil and macrophage 
accumulation in the vasculature in a caspase 1- and cathepsin B-dependent 
manner. ChA also triggered lipid accumulation at the bifurcation sites of the 
vasculature of the zebrafish larvae and negatively impacted their life 
expectancy. We conclude that ChA behaves as an endogenous damage-associated 
molecular pattern with inflammatory and proatherogenic properties.

Abrocitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) 1-selective inhibitor approved for the 
treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Although specific dose 
recommendations for abrocitinib vary across regional product labels, abrocitinib 
100 mg once daily is recommended as a starting and maintenance dose. This review 
summarizes the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib 100 mg once daily for patients 
with moderate-to-severe AD based on data from the pivotal phase 3 studies of the 
JAK1 Atopic Dermatitis Efficacy and Safety (JADE) clinical program, JADE MONO-1 
(NCT03349060), JADE MONO-2 (NCT03575871), JADE COMPARE (NCT03720470), JADE TEEN

and safety data are also summarized from the long-term extension study JADE 
EXTEND (NCT03422822). Expert opinion on use of abrocitinib 100 mg once daily in 
clinical practice is provided. In addition to efficacy, the decision to use 
abrocitinib for the treatment of AD should allow for individual patient factors 
such as age, comorbidities, previous therapy, quality of life, and treatment 
tolerability, and involve shared decision-making between the patient and 
clinician.

BACKGROUND: Eating an adequate diet and maintaining a healthy body weight can be 
challenging for patients with muscular disorders (MD). Starting tube feeding can 
have a positive impact on nutritional status, functioning and quality of life. 
Guidelines on when to start tube feeding in adults with MD are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to review the scientific literature on indications to start 
tube feeding in adults with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), inclusion body 
myositis (IBM), muscular dystrophy type 1 (DM1), oculopharyngeal muscular 
dystrophy (OPMD) and congenital myopathies.
METHODS: This scoping review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Relevant studies were identified in Pubmed, Embase and 
Cinahl (April 2022). The medical subject headings (MeSH) and text words used 
were related to FSHD, IBM, DM1, OPMD or congenital myopathies and dysphagia, 
enteral nutrition or malnutrition.
RESULTS: Of 1046 unique articles, 9 case reports and 2 retrospective case series 
were included. Indications to start tube feeding were dysphagia, 
malnutrition/weight loss and respiratory infections (due to aspiration). 
Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes were used most often and 
complications were respiratory failure, problems with the tube itself, 
accidental tube removal, cutaneous symptoms, digestive symptoms, and 
peritonitis.
CONCLUSION: Data on tube feeding in MD is scarce. Indications to start tube 
feeding were similar across the various MD. We call for more research in this 
field and suggest to include screening for dysphagia, aspiration and 
malnutrition in for the treatment of various MD.

The North American pawpaw (Asimina triloba) is a tropical fruit that is known to 
be the largest edible fruit native to the United States. The fruit has remained 
uncommercialized because of the rapid changes in quality that occur after the 
fruit is harvested. However, only a few studies have evaluated the quality of 
the fruit during postharvest storage. This study aimed to assess the effect of 
different concentrations of chitosan and sodium alginate coatings, and freshness 
paper treatments on the quality characteristics of pawpaw fruits during storage 
and use TOPSIS-Shannon entropy analyses to determine which treatment best 
maintains the quality of the fruits from three cultivars. The results show that 
the chitosan coatings were more effective in slowing moisture loss in Sunflower 
fruits than in Susquehanna and 10-35 fruits over time. Similarly, the freshness 
paper treatment controlled moisture loss more effectively than sodium alginate 
coatings. The 10-35 fruits with 1% chitosan coating had very little change in 
skin color and physical appearance compared to all the other treatments. The 
TOPSIS-Shannon entropy analyses showed that the 10-35 fruits with 1% chitosan 
had the most stable quality over time, followed by the Susquehanna and Sunflower 
fruits with 2% chitosan coatings. The experimental data from different 
cultivars, treatments, and storage conditions, proved the shelf-life of pawpaw 
fruit could be extended from 5 days to 15-20 days depending on the cultivar. 
These findings will enable the creation of markets for pawpaw fruits and allow 
countries that grow them to generate revenue from this underutilized specialty 
crop.

Incidental finding of undiagnosed aortic coarctation in an elderly patient with 
a rare association with thymic carcinoma: a case report with review of the 
literature.

Aortic coarctation is a congenital malformation that is relatively prevalent, 
occurring in approximately 5 out of every 1000 births. The narrowing typically 
happens at the aortic isthmus between the left subclavian artery and the 
arterial ligament. It is frequently associated with a bicuspid aortic valve. 
Generally, coarctation of the aorta is identified and treated during childhood 
or early adulthood. If left untreated, this condition can lead to a reduced life 
expectancy in individuals who have not received treatment. We present a case of 
a 52-year-old man who complained of chest pain, sputum, and hemoptysis 
persisting for approximately 2 years. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) 
scans revealed the presence of an anterior mediastinal mass, which was later 
confirmed to be a thymic carcinoma (on histological study). Additionally, an 
incidental finding of a thoracic aortic coarctation with a well-developed 
collateral circulation was observed. The discovery of aortic coarctation in 
adult patients as an incidental finding is rare and particularly uncommon in 
association with mediastinal or thoracic tumor pathology. Adult and elderly 
patients with uncorrected coarctation generally have a low survival rate, and 
the management strategies for such cases are controversial, especially when it 
is associated to other pathologies. Due to the complexity of therapeutic 
management and the limited literature available on postsurgical outcomes in 
these cases, making therapeutic decisions requires a multidisciplinary approach 
and personalized consideration for each individual case. This approach is 
necessary to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio and determine the most suitable 
therapeutic solution.

This study aimed to investigate the establishment of relationship between 
inbreeding and life expectancy in dogs. A dataset of N = 30,563 dogs sourced 
from the VetCompass™ Program, UK was made available by the Royal Veterinary 
College, University of London, containing information about breed and longevity 
and was subject to survival analysis. A Cox regression proportional hazards 
model was used to differentiate survivability in three groups of dogs (mongrel, 
cross-bred and pure breed). The model was found highly significant (p < 0.001) 
and we found that mongrel dog had the highest life expectancy, followed by 
cross-bred dogs with only one purebred ancestor and purebred dogs had the lowest 
life expectancy. A second Cox regression was also found highly significant 
(p < 0.001) differentiating the lifespan of different dog breed and correlating 
positively the hazard ratio and the Genetic Illness Severity Index for Dogs 
(GISID). The results show that survivability is higher in mongrel dogs followed 
by cross-bred with one of the ancestor only as a pure breed, and pure breed dog 
have the highest morbidity level. Higher morbidity is associated with higher 
GISID scores, and therefore, higher inbreeding coefficients. These findings have 
important implications for dog breeders, owners, and animal welfare 
organizations seeking to promote healthier, longer-lived dogs.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a serious autosomal recessive disorder. 
Early diagnosis, comorbidity prevention, and control are cornerstones for a 
quality life and for improving life expectancy. In Colombian Caribbean, where 
there is a genetically admixed population, CF is an orphan disease affecting 
children and adults, and it remains a challenging issue to be addressed 
carefully. This work describes the genetic, clinical, and paraclinical profiles 
of CF patients from Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.
METHODS: Thirty-six patients were included in the study. The subjects were 
identified and evaluated through the Regional Program for CF patients. CFTR gene 
mutations, anthropometric parameters, microbiological infections, and pulmonary 
function were analyzed. Data on demographic parameters, pharmacological 
treatments, and comorbidities were reported. Frequency and percentages were 
established for the categorical variables and mean or median for the 
quantitative variables. In addition, comparisons were made by sex.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 11.9 ± 5.3 years and the median age 
at diagnosis was 14 months. 55.5% were women and 44.5% were men. The mean values 
for weight, height, and body mass index were 35 ± 17.6 kg, 139.9 ± 28 cm, and 
16.5 ± 2.9 kg/m2, respectively. The clinical manifestations that occurred more 
frequently were steatorrhea (65.4%) and recurrent pneumonia (46.2%). Chronic 
airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified in 71.4% of the 
cases and the p.F508del mutation was found in 47.2% of the subjects.
CONCLUSION: The current profile of CF patients from the Colombian Caribbean 
showed some concerning features, such as nutritional status; however, progress 
in early diagnosis and clinical follow-up could contribute to improve the 
general conditions of patients. It is necessary to continue efforts to increase 
the life expectancy and quality of life of the patients.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an important 
interventional option for the treatment of complications related to cirrhosis 
and portal hypertension. Emergent TIPS placement can be a life-saving measure in 
patients with uncontrolled variceal hemorrhage. After TIPS placement, patients 
may benefit from additional interventions for clinical optimization including 
stent dilation, stent extension, and embolization of varices. Here, we describe 
a case of emergent TIPS placement and revision which resulted in TIPS stent 
migration requiring stent removal and replacement. We discuss our technique and 
review previously reported methods for the management of migrated TIPS stents.

BACKGROUND: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN) is the most common chronic 
complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). DSPN may lead to more serious 
complications, such as diabetic foot ulcer, amputation, and reduced life 
expectancy. Observational studies have suggested that vitamin D deficiency may 
be associated with the development of DSPN in T2DM. However, interventional 
studies have found that low-dose vitamin D supplementation does not 
significantly improve neuropathy in DSPN. This study aims to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of intramuscular injection of high-dose vitamin D (HDVD) in 
T2DM with DSPN combined with vitamin D insufficiency.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, 
and placebo-controlled trial in four large hospitals. All eligible participants 
will be randomly assigned to either the vitamin D2 supplement or placebo control 
group and injected intramuscularly monthly for 3 months. Additionally, 
anthropometric measurements and clinical data will be collected at baseline and 
3 months. Adverse events will be collected at 1, 2, and 3 months. The primary 
outcome measure is the change in the mean Michigan Neuropathy Screening 
Instrument (MNSI) score at baseline and 3 months post-intervention. We will use 
the gold-standard liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to 
distinguish between 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels. The MNSN score before the 
intervention will be used as a covariate to compare the changes between both 
groups before and after the intervention, and the analysis of covariance will be 
used to analyze the change in the MNSI score after HDVD supplementation.
DISCUSSION: Glycemic control alone does not prevent the progression of DSPN in 
T2DM. Some studies have suggested that vitamin D may improve DSPN; however, the 
exact dose, method, and duration of vitamin D supplementation are unknown. 
Additionally, neuropathy repair requires HDVD supplementation to sustain 
adequate vitamin D levels. This once-a-month intramuscular method avoids daily 
medication; therefore, compliance is high. This study will be the first 
randomized controlled trial in China to analyze the efficacy and safety of HDVD 
supplementation for patients with T2DM and DSPN and will provide new ideas for 
pharmacological research and clinical treatment of diabetic neuropathy.

University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an irreversible and fatal lung disease 
that is primarily found in the elderly population, and several studies have 
demonstrated that aging is the major risk factor for IPF. IPF is characterized 
by the presence of apoptosis-resistant, senescent fibroblasts that generate an 
excessively stiff extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM profoundly affects 
cellular functions and tissue homeostasis, and an aberrant ECM is closely 
associated with the development of lung fibrosis. Aging progressively alters ECM 
components and is associated with the accumulation of senescent cells that 
promote age-related tissue dysfunction through the expression of factors linked 
to a senescence-associated secretary phenotype (SASP). There is growing evidence 
that SASP factors affect various cell behaviors and influence ECM turnover in 
lung tissue through autocrine and/or paracrine signaling mechanisms. Since life 
expectancy is increasing worldwide, it is important to elucidate how aging 
affects ECM dynamics and turnover via SASP and thereby promotes lung fibrosis. 
In this review, we will focus on the molecular properties of SASP and its 
regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, the pathophysiological process of ECM 
remodeling by SASP factors and the influence of an altered ECM from aged lungs 
on the development of lung fibrosis will be highlighted. Finally, recent 
attempts to target ECM alteration and senescent cells to modulate fibrosis will 
be introduced.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Aging is the most prominent nonmodifiable risk 
factor for various human diseases including Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Aging 
progressively alters extracellular matrix components and is associated with the 
accumulation of senescent cells that promote age-related tissue dysfunction. In 
this review, we will discuss the pathological impact of aging and senescence on 
lung fibrosis via senescence-associated secretary phenotype factors and 
potential therapeutic approaches to limit the progression of lung fibrosis.

OBJECTIVE: Executive functions (EFs) are a multifaceted construct, important for 
several outcomes throughout life. The most commonly addressed executive 
components are inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. To 
map how other executive components are addressed conceptually and 
methodologically in the literature, a scoping review was carried out.
METHOD: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses 
extension for Scoping Reviews guideline was used. The database search 
(2017-2022) was carried out on the APA PsycInfo, Medline, Scopus, LILACS, and 
SciELO databases. A total of 3,473 articles were identified; 1,302 remained 
after screening. Given the large number of articles, a sample calculation was 
performed (95% CI and 5% error), with 297 articles randomly selected for 
full-text reading and 242 studies included for analysis.
RESULTS: There was a predominance of health application studies in adults and 
older adults and in developed countries. There is relative conceptual consensus 
that EF are a multidimensional construct; however, there is no explicit 
identification of the theoretical model used in the studies. A diversity of EF 
was evidenced, which broadens the understanding of the construct, its 
assessment, and intervention targets. Furthermore, there was a variety of 
instruments used to assess these skills, with a predominance of performance 
tests, often with construct-instrument ambivalence between studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The mapping showed a diversity of skills referred to as EF in 
addition to the core components and identified the instruments used in their 
assessment. Greater conceptual and structural clarity and greater methodological 
care are fundamental to support the assessment of EF and their intervention.

Artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is a rapidly growing field aimed at 
using machine learning models to improve health outcomes and patient 
experiences. Many new platforms have become accessible and therefore it seems 
inevitable that we consider how to implement them in our day-to-day practice. 
Currently, the specialty of urogynecology faces new challenges as the population 
grows, life expectancy increases, and quality of life expectation is much 
improved. As AI has a lot of potential to promote the discipline of 
urogynecology, we aim to explore its abilities and possible use in the future. 
Challenges and risks are associated with using AI, and a responsible use of such 
resources is required.
