BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK first adopted physical 
distancing measures in March, 2020. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 became available 
in December, 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing 
SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing in the UK to gain insights 
about possible future scenarios in a post-vaccination era.
METHODS: We used an age-structured dynamic transmission and economic model to 
explore different scenarios of UK mass immunisation programmes over 10 years. We 
compared vaccinating 75% of individuals aged 15 years or older (and annually 
revaccinating 50% of individuals aged 15-64 years and 75% of individuals aged 65 
years or older) to no vaccination. We assumed either 50% vaccine efficacy 
against disease and 45-week protection (worst-case scenario) or 95% vaccine 
efficacy against infection and 3-year protection (best-case scenario). Natural 
immunity was assumed to wane within 45 weeks. We also explored the additional 
impact of physical distancing on vaccination by assuming either an initial 
lockdown followed by voluntary physical distancing, or an initial lockdown 
followed by increased physical distancing mandated above a certain threshold of 
incident daily infections. We considered benefits in terms of quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and costs, both to the health-care payer and the national 
economy. We discounted future costs and QALYs at 3·5% annually and assumed a 
monetary value per QALY of £20 000 and a conservative long-run cost per vaccine 
dose of £15. We explored and varied these parameters in sensitivity analyses. We 
expressed the health and economic benefits of each scenario with the net 
monetary value: QALYs × (monetary value per QALY) - costs.
FINDINGS: Without the initial lockdown, vaccination, and increased physical 
distancing, we estimated 148·0 million (95% uncertainty interval 48·5-198·8) 
COVID-19 cases and 3·1 million (0·84-4·5) deaths would occur in the UK over 10 
years. In the best-case scenario, vaccination minimises community transmission 
without future periods of increased physical distancing, whereas SARS-CoV-2 
becomes endemic with biannual epidemics in the worst-case scenario. Ongoing 
transmission is also expected in intermediate scenarios with vaccine efficacy 
similar to published clinical trial data. From a health-care perspective, 
introducing vaccination leads to incremental net monetary values ranging from 
£12·0 billion to £334·7 billion in the best-case scenario and from -£1·1 billion 
to £56·9 billion in the worst-case scenario. Incremental net monetary values of 
increased physical distancing might be negative from a societal perspective if 
national economy losses are persistent and large.
INTERPRETATION: Our model findings highlight the substantial health and economic 
value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Smaller outbreaks could continue 
even with vaccines, but population-wide implementation of increased physical 
distancing might no longer be justifiable. Our study provides early insights 
about possible future post-vaccination scenarios from an economic and 
epidemiological perspective.

BACKGROUND: Mental disorders account for a substantial proportion of the years 
lived with disability (YLDs) globally. These estimates have generally been 
calculated top down based on summary statistics. The aim for this study was to 
calculate YLDs and a novel related measure, Health Loss Proportion (HeLP), for 
18 mental and substance use disorders, based on person-level register data 
(bottom up).
METHODS: A cohort of 6 989 627 Danish residents (5·9% had a diagnosis of a 
mental or substance use disorder registered in the Danish Psychiatric Central 
Research Register) was investigated. YLDs (the duration of disease multiplied by 
a disability weight) were calculated for the disorder of interest and for 
comorbid mental and substance use disorders. HeLPs were estimated as YLDs 
associated with an index disorder and comorbid mental and substance use 
disorders divided by person-years at risk in persons with the index disorder. 
All analyses were adjusted for mental and substance use comorbidity using a 
multiplicative model of disability weights.
FINDINGS: Major depressive disorder was the most prevalent disorder, although 
schizophrenia was the leading cause of YLDs in both sexes combined (YLDs 273·3 
[95 % CI 232·3-313·6] per 100 000 person-years). People diagnosed with 
schizophrenia lost the equivalent of 73% (63-83%) of healthy life per year due 
to mental and substance use disorders, the largest HeLP of all mental and 
substance use disorders. Comorbidity of mental and substance use disorders 
accounted for 69-83% of HeLPs in people with either cannabis use disorders, 
other drug use disorder and ADHD. By contrast, comorbidity explained 11-23% of 
the HeLPs in people with autism spectrum disorders, conduct disorder, and 
schizophrenia.
INTERPRETATION: Substantial variation in disability was observed across age, 
sex, and disorders. The new HeLP metric provides novel details of the 
contribution of comorbidity to the disability associated with mental and 
substance use disorders.

BACKGROUND: The nonavalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been shown to 
extend protection against oncogenic HPV types 31/33/45/52/58 (HPV-OV) not 
covered by the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines. Besides its clinical 
benefit, evidence on the economic value of the nonavalent vaccine is required to 
inform local vaccination strategies and funding decisions. This study evaluated 
the cost-effectiveness of replacing the bivalent vaccine with the nonavalent 
vaccine in the national school-based HPV vaccination programme in Singapore.
METHODS: An existing age-structured dynamic transmission model coupled with 
stochastic individual-based simulations was adapted to project the health and 
economic impact of vaccinating 13-year-old girls with two doses of the 
nonavalent or bivalent HPV vaccines in Singapore. Direct costs (in Singapore 
dollars, S$) were obtained from public healthcare institutions in Singapore, 
while health state utilities were sourced from the literature. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated over a lifetime horizon, from a 
healthcare system perspective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed 
to obtain the ICERs and corresponding variations across variable uncertainty. 
Particularly, this study tested the scenarios of lifelong and 20-year 
vaccine-induced protection, assumed 96.0% and 22.3% cross-protection against 
HPV-OV by nonavalent and bivalent vaccines respectively, and fixed vaccine 
prices per dose at S$188 for nonavalent and S$61.50 for bivalent vaccines.
RESULTS: Compared with the bivalent vaccine, the use of the nonavalent vaccine 
was associated with an ICER of S$61,629 per quality-adjusted life year gained in 
the base case. The result was robust across a range of plausible input values, 
and to assumptions regarding the duration of vaccine protection.
CONCLUSION: Given the high ICER, the nonavalent vaccine is unlikely to represent 
a cost-effective option compared with the bivalent vaccine for school-based HPV 
vaccination of 13-year old female students in Singapore. Substantial price 
reductions would be required to justify its inclusion in the school-based 
programme in the future.

OBJECTIVES: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health problem. 
An advanced, or innovative, CKD care system of clinical practice collaboration 
among general physicians (GPs), nephrologists, and other healthcare workers 
achieved behavior modification in patients with Stage 3 CKD in the Frontier of 
Renal Outcome Modifications in Japan (FROM-J) study. This behavior modification 
intervention consisted of educational sessions on nutrition and lifestyle, as 
well as encouragement of patients' regular visits. The intervention contributed 
to slowing CKD progression. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of the widespread diffusion of the behavior modification intervention proven 
effective by the FROM-J study.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out to compare the behavior 
modification intervention with the current practice recommended by the latest 
CKD clinical guidelines for GPs. A Markov model with a societal perspective 
under Japan's health system was constructed. We assumed that the behavior 
modification intervention proven effective by the FROM-J study would be 
initiated by GPs for targeted patient cohorts-patients aged 40-74 years with 
Stage 3 CKD-as a part of the innovative CKD care system.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the behavior modification 
intervention compared with current guideline-based practice was calculated as 
145,593 Japanese yen (¥; $1,324 United States dollars [$]) per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Using the suggested value of social willingness to pay for a 
one-QALY gain in Japan of ¥5 million (US$45,455) as the threshold to judge 
cost-effectiveness, the behavior modification intervention is cost-effective. 
Our results suggest that diffusing the behavior modification intervention proven 
effective by the FROM-J study could be justifiable as an efficient use of finite 
healthcare resources. GPs could be encouraged to initiate this intervention by 
revising the National Health Insurance fee schedule and strengthening clinical 
guidelines regarding behavior modification interventions.

AIMS: To assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of novel glucagon-like 
peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog oral semaglutide versus sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
inhibitor empagliflozin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin and 
injectable GLP-1 analog liraglutide in the Netherlands, based on the results of 
the PIONEER clinical trials.
METHODS: Outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE 
Diabetes Model. Clinical data were derived from PIONEER 2, 3 and 4. Patients 
were assumed to receive initial treatments until glycated hemoglobin exceeded 
7.5%, then treatment-intensified to basal insulin therapy. Costs were accounted 
from a societal perspective in 2019 euros (EUR).
RESULTS: Oral semaglutide 14 mg was associated with improvements in 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.15, 0.22 and 0.09quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) versus empagliflozin 25 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg and liraglutide 
1.8 mg, respectively, with combined costs EUR1,032 higher, EUR115 higher and 
EUR1,267 lower. Oral semaglutide was therefore associated with incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios of EUR7,061 and EUR516 per QALY gained versus 
empagliflozin and sitagliptin, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on long-term projections, oral semaglutide 14 mg was 
considered cost-effective versus empagliflozin 25 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg and 
dominant versus liraglutide 1.8 mg for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the 
Netherlands.

Previous studies demonstrated that lifelong treatment with a slow H2S releasing 
donor extends yeast chronological lifespan (CLS), but it is not clear when the 
action of H2S benefits to CLS during yeast growth. Here, we show that short H2S 
treatments by using NaHS as a fast H2S releasing donor at 96 hours after 
inoculation extended yeast CLS while NaHS treatments earlier than 72 hours after 
inoculation failed to do so. To reveal the mechanism, we analyzed the 
transcriptome of yeast cells with or without the early and late NaHS treatments. 
We found that both treatments had similar effects on pathways related to CLS 
regulation. Follow-up qPCR and ROS analyses suggest that altered expression of 
some antioxidant genes by the early NaHS treatments were not stable enough to 
benefit CLS. Moreover, transcriptome data also indicated that some genes were 
regulated differently by the early and late H2S treatment. Specifically, we 
found that the expression of YPK2, a human SGK2 homolog and also a key regulator 
of the yeast cell wall synthesis, was significantly altered by the late NaHS 
treatment but not altered by the early NaHS treatment. Finally, the key role of 
YPK2 in CLS regulation by H2S is revealed by CLS data showing that the late NaHS 
treatment did not enhance the CLS of a ypk2 knockout mutant. This study sheds 
light on the molecular mechanism of CLS extension induced by H2S, and for the 
first time addresses the importance of H2S treatment timing for lifespan 
extension.

Nonenzymatic copying of RNA templates with activated nucleotides is a useful 
model for studying the emergence of heredity at the origin of life. Previous 
experiments with defined-sequence templates have pointed to the poor fidelity of 
primer extension as a major problem. Here we examine the origin of mismatches 
during primer extension on random templates in the simultaneous presence of all 
four 2-aminoimidazole-activated nucleotides. Using a deep sequencing approach 
that reports on millions of individual template-product pairs, we are able to 
examine correct and incorrect polymerization as a function of sequence context. 
We have previously shown that the predominant pathway for primer extension 
involves reaction with imidazolium-bridged dinucleotides, which form 
spontaneously by the reaction of two mononucleotides with each other. We now 
show that the sequences of correctly paired products reveal patterns that are 
expected from the bridged dinucleotide mechanism, whereas those associated with 
mismatches are consistent with direct reaction of the primer with activated 
mononucleotides. Increasing the ratio of bridged dinucleotides to activated 
mononucleotides, either by using purified components or by using 
isocyanide-based activation chemistry, reduces the error frequency. Our results 
point to testable strategies for the accurate nonenzymatic copying of arbitrary 
RNA sequences.

INTRODUCTION: Pembrolizumab monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy are 
two new treatment options for patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and high (≥ 50%) programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
expression. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis for Switzerland comparing 
these two options but also pembrolizumab to chemotherapy.
METHODS: We constructed a 3-state Markov model with a time horizon of 10 years. 
Parametric functions were fitted to Kaplan-Meier overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS) using 2-year follow-up data from the KN-024 and 
KN-189 registration trials. We included estimated costs for further treatment 
lines and costs for best supportive care. Costs were assessed from the Swiss 
healthcare payer perspective. We used published utility values.
RESULTS: Combination therapy resulted in an expected gain of 0.17 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient and incremental costs of Swiss 
Francs (CHF) 81,085 as compared to pembrolizumab. These estimates led to an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CHF 475,299/QALY. Pembrolizumab 
in comparison to chemotherapy was estimated to generate mean incremental QALYs 
of 0.83 and incremental costs of CHF 56,585, resulting in an ICER of 
CHF 68,580/QALY. Results were most sensitive to changes in costs of 1L 
pembrolizumab and combination therapy, together with changes in PFS. In the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, we estimated combination therapy was 
cost-effective in 4.9% of the simulations and pembrolizumab monotherapy in 
82.9%, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF 100,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab is likely to be cost-effective from the Swiss 
healthcare payer perspective, whereas pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is not.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
surgical release to botulinum toxin injections in the treatment of 
upper-extremity (UE) cerebral palsy (CP).
METHODS: A Markov transition-state model was developed to assess the direct and 
indirect costs as well as accumulated quality-adjusted life-years associated 
with surgery (surgery group) and continuous botulinum toxin injections 
(botulinum group) for the treatment of UE CP in children aged 7 to 12 years. 
Direct medical costs were obtained from institutional billing departments. The 
number of parental missed workdays associated with each treatment was estimated 
and previously published regressions were used to calculate indirect costs 
associated with missed work. Total costs, cost-effectiveness, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
and willingness to pay thresholds were used to make decisions regarding 
society's willingness to pay for the incremental cost of each treatment given 
the incremental benefit.
RESULTS: The surgery group demonstrated lower direct, indirect, and total costs 
compared with the botulinum group. Direct costs were $29,250.50 for the surgery 
group and $50,596.00 for the botulinum group. Indirect costs were $9,467.46 for 
the surgery group and $44,428.60 for the botulinum group. Total costs were 
$38,717.96 for the surgery group and $95,024.60 for the botulinum group, a 
difference of $56,306.64. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
-$42,019.88, indicating that surgery is a less costly and more effective 
treatment and that botulinum injections fall outside the societal willingness to 
pay threshold. Excluding indirect costs associated with parental missed work 
during home occupational therapy did not have a significant impact on the model.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is associated with lower direct, indirect, and total costs, 
as well as a greater number of accumulated quality-adjusted life-years. Surgery 
provides a greater benefit at a lower cost, which suggests that botulinum 
injections should be used sparingly in this population. Treatment with surgery 
could represent savings of $5.6 to $11.3 billion annually in the United States.

"Community Care": Historical Perspective on Deinstitutionalization.

Scull A.

This article examines the discrepancies between the rhetoric surrounding 
deinstitutionalization and community care and the reality of the abandonment of 
the seriously mentally ill to their fate. It discusses how the earlier 
commitment to the asylum came to be abandoned, analyzes various attempts to 
explain why the mentally ill were decanted from institutions into a largely 
unreceptive community, and dissects the shortcomings of these actions. The 
realities of care in the community and the connections of deinstitutionalization 
to the collapse of public psychiatry, the epidemic of homelessness, and the 
place of jails as our primary in-patient response to serious mental illness are 
explored, as is the curious political coalition that endorsed the end of the 
asylum. The connections of deinstitutionalization to the rise of neoliberal 
ideas are documented, and the impact of the changed public policy on the life 
expectancy of those with serious mental illness is analyzed.

systematic review of measurement properties.

The population is ageing, but while average life expectancy continues to 
increase, healthy life expectancy has not necessarily matched this and negative 
ageing stereotypes remain prevalent. Self-directed ageing stereotypes are 
hypothesised to play an important role in older adults' health and well-being; 
however, a wide variety of terms and measures are used to explore this construct 
meaning there is a lack of clarity within the literature. A review was conducted 
to identify tools used to measure self-directed ageing stereotype in older 
adults and evaluate their quality. Searches identified 109 papers incorporating 
40 different measures. Most common were the Philadelphia Geriatric Centre Morale 
Scale Attitude Towards Own Ageing (ATOA) subscale, Ageing Perceptions 
Questionnaire (APQ) and Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire. Despite being most 
frequently used, the ATOA was developed to measure morale in older adults rather 
than self-directed ageing stereotypes. Over 25 terms were used to describe the 
concept, and it is suggested that for consistency the term "self-directed ageing 
stereotype" be adopted universally. Across measures, poor reporting of 
psychometric properties made it difficult to assess scale quality and more 
research is needed to fully assess measures before conclusions can be drawn as 
to the best tool; however, the Brief-APQ appears to hold most promise. Future 
research must address this issue before interventions to reduce negative 
self-directed ageing stereotypes can be developed and fully evaluated.

Background: The potential value of patient preference studies has been 
recognized in clinical individual treatment decision-making between clinicians 
and patients, as well as in upstream drug decision-making. Drug developers, 
regulators, reimbursement and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies are 
exploring how the use of patient preference studies could inform drug 
development, regulatory benefit risk-assessment and reimbursement decisions 
respectively. Understanding patient preferences may be especially valuable in 
decisions regarding Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) treatment options, where 
a variety of treatment options with different characteristics raise uncertainty 
about which features are most important to NSCLC patients. As part of the 
Innovative Medicines Initiative PREFER project, this qualitative study aimed to 
identify patient-relevant lung cancer treatment characteristics. Methods: This 
study consisted of a scoping literature review and four focus group discussions, 
2 in Italy and 2 in Belgium, with a total of 24 NSCLC patients (Stages III-IV). 
The focus group discussions sought to identify which treatment characteristics 
patients find most relevant. The discussions were analyzed thematically using a 
thematic inductive analysis. Results: Patients highlighted themes reflecting: 1) 
positive effects or expected gains from treatment such as greater life 
expectancy and maintenance of daily functioning, 2) negative effects or adverse 
events related to therapy that negatively impact patients' daily functioning 
such as fatigue and 3) uncertainty regarding the duration and type of treatment 
effects. These overarching themes were consistent among patients from Belgium 
and Italy, suggesting that treatment aspects related to efficacy and safety as 
well as the psychological impact of lung cancer treatment are common areas of 
concern for patients, regardless of cultural background or country. Discussion: 
Our findings illustrate the value of using qualitative methods with patients to 
identify preferred treatment characteristics for advanced lung cancer. These 
could inform a subsequent quantitative preference survey that assesses patient 
trade-offs regarding treatment options.

This study is aimed to develop a novel edible coating based on Plantago major 
seed mucilage (PMSM) and Citrus limon essential oil (CLEO) to increase the 
shelf-life of buffalo meat during cold storage. The CLEO was firstly isolated by 
the hydrodistillation method, and it contained mainly limonene (40.5%) and 
carene (15.4%) with remarkable antioxidant activity (55.7%, 63.8%, and 51.85% 
based on the DPPH-radical scavenging, ABTS-radical scavenging, and 
carotene-linoleic acid bleaching tests, respectively) and antibacterial effect 
against some pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. The CLEO (0%, 0.5%, 1%, 
1.5%, and 2%) was then incorporated into PMSM solution to develop a novel 
CLEO-loaded PMSM edible coating for improving the shelf-life of buffalo meat. 
The edible coating was able to significantly reduce the progression of lipid 
oxidation (peroxide value) and microbial growth (total viable count, 
psychrotrophic bacteria, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and fungi) in 
buffalo meat during storage period of 10 days at 4°C in comparison with the 
control (noncoated sample). The meat hardness and sensory properties (i.e., 
odor, color, appearance, texture, and overall acceptability) were also 
maintained better upon edible coating applications. Based on the results, the 
CLEO-rich PMSM edible coating could be applied as a new and effective 
preservative to improve the stability of meat products to lipid oxidation and 
microbial spoilage.

cancer and its attributable risk factors in 195 countries and territories, 1990 
to 2017: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.

BACKGROUND: The global burden of gallbladder and biliary tract cancer (GBTC) is 
increasing. A comprehensive evaluation of the burden is crucial to improve 
strategies for GBTC prevention and treatment.
METHODS: The incidence rates, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) of GBTC from 1990 to 2017 were extracted from the Global Burden of 
Diseases Study (GBD) 2017. Estimated annual percent changes (EAPCs) were 
calculated to quantify GBTC trends during the study period.
RESULTS: Globally, there were 210,878 new cases, 173,974 deaths, and 3,483,046 
DALYs because of GBTC in 2017. GBTC incidence increased by 76%, mortality 
increased by 65%, and DALYs increased by 52% from 1990 to 2017. In addition, 
relatively higher Socio-Demographic Index regions had greater incidence and 
death rates but greatly decreased age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and 
age-standardized death rate (ASDR). At the national level, Chile had the highest 
ASIR (10.38 per 100,000 population) and the highest ASDR (10.43 per 100,000 
population) in 2017. The largest increases in ASIR (EAPC, 3.38) and ASDR (EAPC, 
3.39) were observed in Georgia. Nonlinear associations were observed between the 
ASDR, the Socio-Demographic Index, and DALYs at the 21 GBD regional levels and 
at the national level. The proportions of GBTC age-standardized deaths and DALYs 
attributable to high body mass index were 15.4% and 16%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: GBTC remains a major health burden worldwide. These findings are 
expected to prompt policymakers to establish a cost-effective method for the 
early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of GBTC, reducing its modifiable risk 
factors and reversing its increasing trends.
LAY SUMMARY: Although the rates of age-standardized incidence, death, and 
disability-adjusted life-years for gallbladder and biliary tract cancer 
decreased from 1990 to 2017, the numbers of these measures increased. Nonlinear 
associations existed between the age-standardized death rate, the 
Socio-Demographic Index, and disability-adjusted life-years at the 21 regional 
and national levels in the Global Burden of Disease Study.

BACKGROUND: Expanding statin use may help to alleviate the excess burden of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in people living with HIV (PLHIV). 
Pravastatin and pitavastatin are preferred agents due to their lack of 
substantial interaction with antiretroviral therapy. We aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of pravastatin and pitavastatin for the primary prevention of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease among PLHIV in the United States.
METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model that randomly selected (with 
replacement) individuals from the Data-collection on Adverse Effects of Anti-HIV 
Drugs study with follow-up between 2013 and 2016. Our study population was PLHIV 
aged 40 to 75 years, stable on antiretroviral therapy, and not currently using 
lipid-lowering therapy. Direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) were assigned in annual cycles and discounted at 3% per year. We assumed 
a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY gained. The interventions 
assessed were as follows: (1) treating no one with statins; (2) treating 
everyone with generic pravastatin 40 mg/day (drug cost $236/year) and (3) 
treating everyone with branded pitavastatin 4 mg/day (drug cost $2,828/year). 
The model simulated each individual's probability of experiencing 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease over 20 years.
RESULTS: Persons receiving pravastatin accrued 0.024 additional QALYs compared 
with those not receiving a statin, at an incremental cost of $1338, giving an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $56,000/QALY gained. Individuals 
receiving pitavastatin accumulated 0.013 additional QALYs compared with those 
using pravastatin, at an additional cost of $18,251, giving an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,444,000/QALY gained. These findings were most 
sensitive to the pill burden associated with daily statin administration, statin 
costs, statin efficacy and baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. 
In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, no statin was optimal in 5.2% of 
simulations, pravastatin was optimal in 94.8% of simulations and pitavastatin 
was never optimal.
CONCLUSIONS: Pravastatin was projected to be cost-effective compared with no 
statin. With substantial price reduction, pitavastatin may be cost-effective 
compared with pravastatin. These findings bode well for the expanded use of 
statins among PLHIV in the United States. To gain greater confidence in our 
conclusions it is important to generate strong, HIV-specific estimates on the 
efficacy of statins and the quality-of-life burden associated with taking an 
additional daily pill.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disease that 
causes a range of motor, sensory, and cognitive symptoms. Due to these symptoms, 
people with MS are at a high risk for falls, fall-related injuries, and 
reductions in quality of life. There is no cure for MS, and managing symptoms 
and disease progression is important to maintain a high quality of life. Mobile 
health (mHealth) apps are commonly used by people with MS to help manage their 
health. However, there are limited health apps for people with MS designed to 
evaluate fall risk. A fall risk app can increase access to fall risk assessments 
and improve self-management. When designing mHealth apps, a user-centered 
approach is critical for improving use and adoption.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to undergo a user-centered approach to 
test and refine the usability of the app through an iterative design process.
METHODS: The fall risk app Steady-MS is an extension of Steady, a fall risk app 
for older adults. Steady-MS consists of 2 components: a 25-item questionnaire 
about demographics and MS symptoms and 5 standing balance tasks. Data from the 
questionnaire and balance tasks were inputted into an algorithm to compute a 
fall risk score. Two iterations of semistructured interviews (n=5 participants 
per iteration) were performed to evaluate usability. People with MS used 
Steady-MS on a smartphone, thinking out loud. Interviews were recorded, 
transcribed, and developed into codes and themes. People with MS also completed 
the System Usability Scale.
RESULTS: A total of 3 themes were identified: intuitive navigation, efficiency 
of use, and perceived value. Overall, the participants found Steady-MS efficient 
to use and useful to learn their fall risk score. There were challenges related 
to cognitive overload during the balance tasks. Modifications were made, and 
after the second iteration, people with MS reported that the app was intuitive 
and efficient. Average System Usability Scale scores were 95.5 in both 
iterations, representing excellent usability.
CONCLUSIONS: Steady-MS is the first mHealth app for people with MS to assess 
their overall risk of falling and is usable by a subset of people with MS. 
People with MS found Steady-MS to be usable and useful for understanding their 
risk of falling. When developing future mHealth apps for people with MS, it is 
important to prevent cognitive overload through simple and clear instructions 
and present scores that are understood and interpreted correctly through visuals 
and text. These findings underscore the importance of user-centered design and 
provide a foundation for the future development of tools to assess and prevent 
scalable falls for people with MS. Future steps include understanding the 
validity of the fall risk algorithm and evaluating the clinical utility of the 
app.

BACKGROUND: Prior studies have reported that greater numbers of primary care 
physicians (PCPs) per population are associated with reduced population 
mortality, but the effect of increasing PCP density in areas of low density is 
poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate how alleviating PCP shortages might change life 
expectancy and mortality.
DESIGN: Generalized additive models, mixed-effects models, and generalized 
estimating equations.
SETTING: 3104 U.S. counties from 2010 to 2017.
PARTICIPANTS: Children and adults.
MEASUREMENTS: Age-adjusted life expectancy; all-cause mortality; and mortality 
due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, infectious disease, respiratory disease, 
and substance use or injury.
RESULTS: Persons living in counties with less than 1 physician per 3500 persons 
in 2017 had a mean life expectancy that was 310.9 days shorter than for persons 
living in counties above that threshold. In the low-density counties (n = 1218), 
increasing the density of PCPs above the 1:3500 threshold would be expected to 
increase mean life expectancy by 22.4 days (median, 19.4 days [95% CI, 0.9 to 
45.6 days]), and all such counties would require 17 651 more physicians, or 
about 14.5 more physicians per shortage county. If counties with less than 1 
physician per 1500 persons (n = 2636) were to reach the 1:1500 threshold, life 
expectancy would be expected to increase by 56.3 days (median, 55.6 days [CI, 
4.2 to 105.6 days]), and all such counties would require 95 754 more physicians,
