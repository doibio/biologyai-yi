aspects the dependence of trait values on the topology of the tree 
("phylogenetic dependence"). We also propose four complementary test statistics 
to be computed from orthogram values that help to diagnose both the intensity 
and the nature of phylogenetic dependence. The relevance of the method is 
illustrated by the analysis of three phylogenetic data sets, drawn from the 
literature and typifying contrasted levels and aspects of phylogenetic 
dependence. Freely available routines which have been programmed in the R 
framework are also proposed.

Izmir, Turkey. belgina@liv.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: The prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) is 
complex. A variety of models have therefore been developed to try and explain 
past trends and predict future possibilities. The aim of this systematic review 
was to evaluate the strengths and limitations of existing CHD policy models.
METHODS: A search strategy was developed, piloted and run in MEDLINE and EMBASE 
electronic databases, supplemented by manually searching reference lists of 
relevant articles and reviews. Two reviewers independently checked the papers 
for inclusion and appraisal. All CHD modelling studies were included which 
addressed a defined population and reported on one or more key outcomes (deaths 
prevented, life years gained, mortality, incidence, prevalence, disability or 
cost of treatment).
RESULTS: In total, 75 articles describing 42 models were included; 12 (29%) of 
the 42 models were micro-simulation, 8 (19%) cell-based, and 8 (19%) life table 
analyses, while 14 (33%) used other modelling methods. Outcomes most commonly 
reported were cost-effectiveness (36%), numbers of deaths prevented (33%), 
life-years gained (23%) or CHD incidence (23%). Among the 42 models, 29 (69%) 
included one or more risk factors for primary prevention, while 8 (19%) just 
considered CHD treatments. Only 5 (12%) were comprehensive, considering both 
risk factors and treatments. The six best-developed models are summarised in 
this paper, all are considered in detail in the appendices.
CONCLUSION: Existing CHD policy models vary widely in their depth, breadth, 
quality, utility and versatility. Few models have been calibrated against 
observed data, replicated in different settings or adequately validated. Before 
being accepted as a policy aid, any CHD model should provide an explicit 
statement of its aims, assumptions, outputs, strengths and limitations.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, with 80% of 
cases occurring in developing countries. We therefore aimed to establish whether 
use of evidence-based multidrug regimens for patients at high risk for 
cardiovascular disease would be cost-effective in low-income and middle-income 
countries.
METHODS: We used a Markov model to do a cost-effectiveness analysis with two 
combination regimens. For primary prevention, we used aspirin, a calcium-channel 
blocker, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, and a statin, and assessed 
them in four groups with different thresholds of absolute risks for 
cardiovascular disease. For secondary prevention, we assessed the same 
combination of drugs in one group, but substituted a beta blocker for the 
calcium-channel blocker. To compare strategies, we report incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), in US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY).
FINDINGS: We recorded that preventive strategies could result in a 2-year gain 
in life expectancy. Across six developing World Bank regions, primary prevention 
yielded ICERs of US746-890 dollars/QALY gained for patients with a 10-year 
absolute risk of cardiovascular disease greater than 25%, and 1039-1221 
dollars/QALY gained for those with an absolute risk greater than 5%. ICERs for 
secondary prevention ranged from 306 dollars/QALY to 388 dollars/QALY gained.
INTERPRETATION: Regimens of aspirin, two blood-pressure drugs, and a statin 
could halve the risk of death from cardiovascular disease in high-risk patients. 
This approach is cost-effective according to WHO recommendations, and is robust 
across several estimates of drug efficacy and of treatment cost. Developing 
countries should encourage the use of these inexpensive drugs that are currently 
available for both primary and secondary prevention.

BACKGROUND: Live donor kidney transplantation is a procedure conducted with 
proven efficacy and safety for its recipients, although the post-operative 
outcome of the donors has been subjected to little investigation.
METHODS: This study assessed 100 donors (34 men and 66 women) for kidney 
transplants conducted at the Hospital of Clinics of the Federal University of 
Minas Gerais, Brazil in a post-operative period longer than 2 years. The quality 
of life evaluation was performed according to the SF-36 health survey.
RESULTS: The quality of life of donors, especially female ones, was equal to or 
higher than the quality of life of the control group with respect to all the 
parameters of the short-form health survey. The main complaints were 
dissatisfaction with the medical service (31%) and with the aspect of the scar 
(24%). Six percent of the donors regretted the donation and the relationship of 
13% of the donors with the recipient of the transplant deteriorated. The rates 
of overweight and obesity were larger than the Brazilian people averages. The 
frequency of arterial hypertension did not differ from the average of the 
Brazilian population, although half of these patients did not previously know 
their blood pressure levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The quality of life of kidney donors was not different than it was 
for the healthy individuals of the community, although there were variations 
among donor subgroups. There was dissatisfaction related to the medical service 
and over the surgical scar, in addition to prevalence of obesity and arterial 
hypertension above the expectancy.

GPO, Nairobi, Kenya. sekesi@icipe.org

Field infestation rates of an invasive fruit fly species, Bactrocera invadens 
Drew Tsuruta & White on mango was determined at different localities in Kenya. 
At most of the locations and especially at low elevations, B. invadens 
frequently shared the same fruit with the indigenous fruit fly species Ceratitis 
cosyra (Walker) but often occurred at higher numbers than C. cosyra. The level 
of infestation varied with location ranging from 3.0 to 97.2 flies per kg of 
fruit. There was a significant inverse relationship between numbers of flies per 
kg of fruit and elevation at which fruit was collected, suggesting that B. 
invadens is a predominantly lowland pest. On an artificial diet, development of 
B. invadens immatures lasted 25 days; egg incubation required 1.2 days, larval 
development 11.1 days and puparia-adult development 12.4 days. About 55% of eggs 
developed to the adult stage. Life expectancy at pupal eclosion was 75.1 days in 
females and 86.4 days in males. Average net fecundity and net fertility were 
794.6 and 608.1 eggs, respectively, while average daily oviposition was 18.2 
eggs. Daily population increase was 11% and mean generation time was 31 days. 
Results are discussed in relation to the biology and ecology of the insect and 
in the development of mass rearing and control measures for B. invadens.

BACKGROUND: More than 50% of all Europeans over 65 years of age have alterations 
to the fundus that should give rise to the suspicion of incipient age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD). Demographic changes in the German population and the 
longer life expectancy now are causing a rapid increase in the absolute number 
of AMD patients. On the one hand, new treatment options are causing an increase 
in treatment costs; on the other, social costs are also rising because patients 
are often left with some sight impairment. The authors attempt to forecast 
prevalence and incidence on the basis of the epidemiological data known for 
Germany and, using model calculations, to highlight trends that illustrate the 
increasing socioeconomic significance of this disease.
RESULTS: Forecasts show that the number of patients with advanced AMD will 
increase from 710,000 at present to over a million by 2020. In the same period, 
the number of patients with neovascular AMD will increase from 485,000 to 
700,000. There are currently 50,000 new cases of neovascular AMD every year in 
Germany, and it has only just become possible to treat these with the new 
anti-VEGF drugs. The new treatment options will cause additional annual costs of 
1.1-2.9 billion euro for Germany alone.
CONCLUSION: The new treatment options for AMD will lead to a pronounced 
reduction in the number of visually impaired and blind people. However, this 
progress cannot be achieved without the financial resources dedicated to 
ophthalmology being approximately doubled.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of primary hormone therapy for localized or 
locally advanced prostate cancer, by analysing the 10-year survival rates for 
men with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer treated with primary 
hormone therapy or prostatectomy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between February 1993 and March 1995, men with T1b, T1c or 
T2-3 N0M0 prostate cancer were enrolled. In all, 176 men who had a prostatectomy 
were assigned to Study 1 and were given adjuvant luteinizing hormone-releasing 
hormone (LHRH) agonist; 151 men who did not have a prostatectomy were assigned 
to Study 2 and had LHRH agonist monotherapy or combined androgen blockade. They 
were followed until death, loss to follow-up, or until the end of the 
observation period (31 March 2004). We analysed all cases in each study as a 
single population, and compared Study 1 with Study 2.
RESULTS: The mean patient ages were 67.2 years in Study 1 and 75.7 years in 
Study 2. During a median of 10.4 years of follow-up, 20 men in Study 1 and 17 in 
Study 2 died from prostate cancer, and 21 men in Study 1 and 50 in Study 2 died 
from other causes. In Study 1, the 10-year overall survival rate was 73% and the 
10-year cause-specific survival rate was 86%, vs 41% and 78% in Study 2. Overall 
survival curves were similar to expected survival curves in both studies. There 
was no significant difference between studies in cause-specific survival.
CONCLUSIONS: The progression of prostate cancer was retarded by primary hormone 
therapy in men with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. With primary 
hormone therapy or prostatectomy, the men had a life-expectancy similar to that 
of the normal population.

Reductions of circulating matrix metalloproteinase 2 and vascular endothelial 
growth factor levels after treatment with pegvisomant in subjects with 
acromegaly.

BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is involved in activation 
of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) system; the latter is implicated in 
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Patients with acromegaly have 
reduced life expectancy primarily due to cardiac disease.
AIM: This study assessed plasma MMPs and VEGF levels in patients with active 
acromegaly (IGF-I > 130% upper limit of normal), and on treatment with 
pegvisomant.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients [nine female, mean age 56.1 +/- 13.8 yr 
(mean +/- sd)] were studied at baseline and on pegvisomant therapy and compared 
with data from 25 healthy volunteers (12 female; 56.6 +/- 14.2 yr). Plasma 
MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF levels were measured.
RESULTS: Serum IGF-I fell from a baseline (mean +/- sd) level of 620.1 +/- 209.3 
ng/ml to 237.5 +/- 118.5 ng/ml on pegvisomant (doses 10-60 mg; P < 0.001). MMP-2 
levels at baseline were significantly higher in patients compared with healthy 
controls (380.7 +/- 204.8 vs. 207.4 +/- 62.6 ng/ml; P < 0.001), but with 
treatment a significant reduction in MMP-2 [380.7 +/- 204.8 vs. 203.0 +/- 77.4 
ng/ml; P < 0.001] and VEGF (283.4 +/- 233.6 vs. 229.1 +/- 157.4 pg/ml; P = 
0.008) was noted. There was no significant difference in MMP-9 levels between 
patients and controls at baseline (797.5 +/- 142.1 vs. 788.3 +/- 218.0 ng/ml; P 
= 0.87) or between baseline and posttreatment levels (797.5 +/- 142.1 vs. 780.0 
+/- 214 ng/ml; P = 0.76).
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel data demonstrate that treatment of acromegaly with 
pegvisomant leads to reductions in MMP-2 and VEGF concentrations. Further 
studies are required to determine the significance of these findings with 
relation to cardiac disease.

INTRODUCTION: Despite having increased life expectancy, patients with congenital 
heart disease are sometimes presumed to have a diminished quality of life. This 
study therefore assessed the quality of life and perceived health of adults with 
congenital heart disease and compared these two measures with those reported by 
healthy control subjects.
METHODS: Using a comparative study design, we examined quality of life and 
perceived health in 404 patients who were matched for age, sex, educational 
level, and employment status with 404 healthy counterparts. Quality of life was 
measured using a linear analog scale and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. 
Problems and concerns relevant to patients' quality of life were assessed by the 
Congenital Heart Disease-TNO-AZL Adult Quality of Life scale. Perceived health 
was also assessed with a linear analog scale.
RESULTS: Patients perceived their quality of life (median linear analog scale 
score 80; median Satisfaction with Life Scale score 28) and health status to be 
good (median linear analog scale 80). Quality of life was significantly better 
in patients with congenital heart disease than in healthy peers, with a mean 
standardized difference of 0.22 on the linear analog scale and 0.34 on the 
Satisfaction with Life Scale. No group difference was found for perceived 
health. Problems and concerns in adults with congenital heart disease overlapped 
to a large extent with those identified by control subjects. Patients reported 
significantly higher distress scores for 16 of 77 items, whereas control 
subjects perceived more distress for 20 items.
CONCLUSION: Adults with congenital heart disease perceived their quality of life 
to be better than did their healthy counterparts. This finding refutes the 
presumed lower quality of life in patients with cardiac anomalies.

Education, Port Said, Suez Canal University.

Filarial disease is endemic in Egypt in some villages of Nile Delta governorates 
where it is transmitted by Culex pipiens female. GIS functions are used to 
identify environmental indicators of high-risk village as indicated by mosquito 
density, human infection rate, vector species composition, mean life expectancy 
"e(o)" & environmental variables (geology, hydrology, soil types, etc) as well 
as meteorological factors (temperature, RH and rainfall) in relation to filaria 
transmission risk. Remote-sensing technology was used to distinguish between the 
two studied villages as high and non-infected, as defined by microfilarial 
prevalence. The results indicate that filaria transmission risk is higher at an 
area characterized by highly productive aquifers, silt clay soil, receiving 
little amount of rain with low relative humidity (RH). The results indicate that 
the most important landscape elements associated with prevalence are water and 
different vegetation. This work showed that the integration between GIS and 
remote sensing technologies to analyze and identify the environmental factors, 
associated with the disease, did not only allow mapping icurrent spatial 
patterns, but also predicting its distribution under expected future 
developmental and environmental changes.

Health Systems, 305 John Morgan Building, 3620 Hamilton Walk, Philadelphia, PA

The prevalence of the neurodegenerative disorders is increasing as life 
expectancy lengthens, and there exists concern that environmental influences may 
contribute to this increase. These disorders are varied in their clinical 
presentation, but appear to have a common biophysical initiation. At this level, 
it is both plausible and now proven that anesthetics can enhance aggregation of 
some disease-causing proteins. Although data in support of an interaction in 
animal models are still lacking, data from clinical studies indicate an 
association, which provides further cause for concern. Many opportunities exist 
for rapid progress at all levels on defining whether anesthetics do indeed 
contribute to the pathogenesis of these progressive, debilitating disorders.

BACKGROUND: Whole genome amplification is an increasingly common technique 
through which minute amounts of DNA can be multiplied to generate quantities 
suitable for genetic testing and analysis. Questions of amplification-induced 
error and template bias generated by these methods have previously been 
addressed through either small scale (SNPs) or large scale (CGH array, FISH) 
methodologies. Here we utilized whole genome sequencing to assess 
amplification-induced bias in both coding and non-coding regions of two 
bacterial genomes. Halobacterium species NRC-1 DNA and Campylobacter jejuni were 
amplified by several common, commercially available protocols: multiple 
displacement amplification, primer extension pre-amplification and degenerate 
oligonucleotide primed PCR. The amplification-induced bias of each method was 
assessed by sequencing both genomes in their entirety using the 454 Sequencing 
System technology and comparing the results with those obtained from unamplified 
controls.
RESULTS: All amplification methodologies induced statistically significant bias 
relative to the unamplified control. For the Halobacterium species NRC-1 genome, 
assessed at 100 base resolution, the D-statistics from GenomiPhi-amplified 
material were 119 times greater than those from unamplified material, 164.0 
times greater for Repli-G, 165.0 times greater for PEP-PCR and 252.0 times 
greater than the unamplified controls for DOP-PCR. For Campylobacter jejuni, 
also analyzed at 100 base resolution, the D-statistics from GenomiPhi-amplified 
material were 15 times greater than those from unamplified material, 19.8 times 
greater for Repli-G, 61.8 times greater for PEP-PCR and 220.5 times greater than 
the unamplified controls for DOP-PCR.
CONCLUSION: Of the amplification methodologies examined in this paper, the 
multiple displacement amplification products generated the least bias, and 
produced significantly higher yields of amplified DNA.

BACKGROUND: Prolonged cross-clamp time during cardiac surgery increases the risk 
of postoperative mortality and myocardial injury. This subanalysis from the 
pexelizumab for reduction of infarction and mortality in coronary artery bypass 
grafting surgery (PRIMO-CABG) trial, a phase III double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of 3,099 patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery 
bypass graft surgery with or without valve surgery, assessed the impact of 
pexelizumab, an investigational C5 complement inhibitor, on postoperative 
outcomes after prolonged aortic cross-clamp time.
METHODS: The composite endpoint of death or myocardial infarction through 
postoperative day 30 and death alone through days 30, 90, and 180 were examined 
in subpopulations of patients across different cross-clamp times.
RESULTS: After prolonged cross-clamping (> or = 90 minutes), death, or 
myocardial infarction through day 30 and death through days 30, 90, and 180 were 
significantly increased in the intent-to-treat population and were even higher 
in patients with two or more prespecified risk factors, compared with all 
patients cross-clamped less than 90 minutes. Pexelizumab significantly reduced 
the incidence of death or myocardial infarction through day 30, and 
significantly reduced the incidence of mortality through day 180, in patients 
with two or more risk factors that required prolonged cross-clamp time. 
Pexelizumab also significantly reduced perioperative myocardial injury in all 
patients requiring prolonged cross-clamp time.
CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective, subgroup analysis, pexelizumab reduced 
postoperative morbidity and myocardial injury in patients with multiple risk 
factors who underwent prolonged cross-clamp time during coronary artery bypass 
surgery. The clinical benefit of pexelizumab may be related to the effect of 
complement inhibition in the presence of potential ischemic-reperfusion injury 
associated with prolonged aortic cross-clamp time.

BACKGROUND: Although coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) has long been 
the "gold standard" for treatment of multivessel coronary artery disease, 
current percutaneous interventional technologies are challenging that claim. We 
sought to determine long-term survival after isolated CABG to establish a 
baseline for comparison with interventional patients.
METHODS: From 1968 through 2003, 20,835 patients underwent 22,378 isolated CABG 
procedures by a single surgical team. The intermittent fibrillation technique 
without use of cardioplegia was consistently utilized as a method of myocardial 
protection, using cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were prospectively followed 
with direct contact at annual intervals. Age stratified survival was analyzed. 
Long-term survival was compared between pre-stent era patients and post-stent 
era patients.
RESULTS: Operative mortality was 2.5% (95% confidence interval: 2.2% to 2.7%) 
and remained approximately constant since 1974 despite increasing patient age 
and comorbidities. Follow-up was 84% complete with 172,773 patient-years. 
Overall 5-, 15-, 25-, and 35-year survival was 86% +/- 0.3%, 48% +/- 0.5%, 19% 
+/- 0.6%, and 7% +/- 1.2%. By Cox regression, older age, prior myocardial 
infarction, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and history of CABG were risk 
factors for long-term survival. Surgery performed during the post-stent era was 
a protective factor for long-term survival.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the long-term survival of a large series of 
patients after CABG performed by a single surgical team with intermittent 
fibrillation technique. There was no difference in observed survival up to 8 
years between the pre-stent and post-stent eras. This study establishes a 
baseline of long-term CABG survival that could be used for comparison with other 
methods of surgical, or nonsurgical coronary revascularization.

BACKGROUND: Factors predicting long-term survival and reoperative risk after 
mitral valve repair for subsets with prolapse involving the anterior leaflet in 
the current era are unclear.
METHODS: Between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1999, surgical correction of 
mitral regurgitation was performed in 2,219 patients. We analyzed a subset of 
1,411 patients with isolated mitral regurgitation due to leaflet prolapse 
undergoing mitral repair or replacement (+/- coronary bypass).
RESULTS: Mean age was 64 years, and 1,003 (71%) were men. Mitral repair was 
performed in 1,173 (83%) patients. Factors independently predicting overall 
long-term survival included valve repair, younger age, better functional class, 
and the absence of significant coronary artery disease. After adjusting for 
these, smaller preoperative left ventricular end-systolic dimension and greater 
preoperative ejection fraction were associated with superior survival. Mitral 
reoperation occurred in 97 patients (75 repairs, 22 replacements), at a mean of 
4.8 years after initial procedure. Cumulative risk of reoperation was similar 
for patients having valve repair or replacement. Factors predictive of need for 
reoperation after initial repair were younger age, anterior leaflet prolapse, 
chordal shortening, no leaflet resection, no prosthetic annuloplasty, greater 
than mild residual mitral regurgitation, and coronary artery disease. After 
valve replacement, the sole determinant of reoperation was use of a biological 
prosthesis. The durability of repair for prolapse of the anterior leaflet 
improved significantly during the second decade of the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Mitral repair affords superior long-term survival, with permanence 
comparable with mechanical valve replacement. In all categories of mitral 
leaflet prolapse, durability of valve repair has improved over the past decade.

BACKGROUND: The ATS Open Pivot Heart Valve was first introduced in 1992 and has 
been implanted routinely at our institution since 1993. Valve selection was 
based on surgeon preference. The objective of this study is to retrospectively 
analyze our 11-year clinical results with ATS prostheses.
METHODS: Between January 1993 and December 2003, 601 ATS valves (393 aortic 
valve replacement [AVR], 168 mitral valve replacement [MVR], 20 aortic plus 
mitral valve replacement [DVR]) were implanted in 581 patients (377 male, 204 
female; mean age, 63.7 years; range 18 to 89). Preoperatively, 47 (8%) were New 
York Heart Association class I, 212 (36.5%) were class II, 267 (46%) were class 
III, and 55 (9.5%) were class IV. Preoperative comorbidities were coronary 
artery disease, 167 (29%); diabetes mellitus, 72 (12%); cerebrovascular disease, 
2 (0.3%); endocarditis, 53 (9%); and atrial fibrillation, 115 (20%).
RESULTS: Follow-up is 99% complete. Data represent 2,500 cumulative 
patient-years. Mean follow-up is 4.3 +/- 2.6 years (range, 0.1 to 11.6). Overall 
hospital mortality is as follows: AVR, 3.8% (15 patients); MVR, 1.8% (3 
patients); DVR, 10% (2 patients). Structural valve failure was not encountered. 
Overall survival at 10 years is AVR, 84.7% +/- 3.1%, AVR plus coronary artery 
bypass, 67.5% +/- 8.2%; MVR, 59.8% +/- 7.1%, MVR plus coronary artery bypass, 
39% +/- 27.8%; and DVR, 74.3% +/- 10%. Freedom from valve-related death at 10 
years is AVR, 99.2%; MVR, 94.6%; and DVR, 100%. Linearized rates for 
postoperative complications are paravalvular leak, 0.6% per patient-year; valve 
thrombosis, 0.04% per patient-year; thromboembolism, 1.1% per patient-year; 
major bleeding, 0.5% per patient-year; and de novo prosthesis endocarditis, 0.1% 
per patient-year. Postoperative mortality risk was significantly elevated by 
diabetes (p < 0.01), but not by other comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: Our 11-year experience demonstrates low rates of adverse events and 
valve-related complications with the ATS Open Pivot heart valve.

Sciences, Padua University Medical School, Padua, Italy. gino.gerosa@unipd.it

BACKGROUND: TRI Technologies (TT) valves evidenced a propensity to structural 
failure, consisting in fracture of the pivoting system, leading to leaflet 
escape. At our institution, between 2000 and 2002, 36 TT valves were implanted 
in 34 patients. Here we report the final results of the Tritech survey program.
METHODS: In February 2002, the first valve-related death occurred. After the 
event, patients were enrolled in the TT valve survey program and strictly 
followed up. The option of a reintervention was advised to each patient and 
weighed against the redo operative risk. The prophylactic TT valve replacement 
program took place in two time frames, dependent on each patient's personal 
choice: between September 2002 and October 2003 (first phase), and between 
September 2004 and October 2004 (second phase). Overall, 22 (10 women, 12 men) 
patients underwent reoperation. Mean time interval between TT valve implantation 
and replacement was 23 +/- 11 months. Patients' mean age was 59 +/- 11 years 
(median age, 64 years).
RESULTS: All recipients adhering to the program successfully underwent 
reoperation. Operative mortality was 0%.
CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the timing of the second surgery was fundamental 
for the favorable outcome of each patient and the absence of operative 
mortality. We are convinced that the tailored programming of the reintervention, 
together with the strong motivation of each patient, contributed in minimizing 
the risks related to surgery. The circumscribed cohort of patients involved was 
compatible with a tailored therapeutic plan. We strongly advise prophylactic 
reoperation of recipients of TT valves.

BACKGROUND: Infectious complications of median sternotomy carry significant 
morbidity and mortality. However, the outcomes of noninfectious sternal 
dehiscence have not been addressed. We have identified the preoperative 
characteristics, postoperative complications, and long-term functional outcomes 
of patients after reoperation for noninfectious sternal dehiscence and compared 
these patients with a control group to determine risk factors for dehiscence.
METHODS: Retrospective review of the cardiac surgery database identified 48 
patients with noninfectious sternal dehiscence in a group of 12,380 median 
sternotomies between 1994 and 2004. The review included diagnosis, demographics, 
concomitant medical conditions, and surgical outcomes. Functional outcomes were 
assessed using the Short Form-12 questionnaire. One hundred fifty-six median 
sternotomy patients served as controls. Follow-up was 97.9% (47 of 48 patients) 
complete, for a total of 150.1 patient-years.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients at reoperation was 58.8 +/- 12.8 years, with a 
male to female ratio of 45:3. Multivariate analysis determined that New York 
Heart Association class IV, obesity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
were preoperative risk factors for sternal dehiscence. The incidence of sternal 
dehiscence was 0.39% at a mean interval between initial operation and 
reoperation of 5.4 months. At a mean interval of 3.9 months, 14.6% (7 of 48) of 
patients required additional sternal procedures. Infectious complications after 
reoperation occurred in 12.5% (6 of 48). Functional outcomes demonstrated that 
72.2% (26 of 36) had no or mild limitation of physical activities, with 90.5% 
(38 of 42) reporting no or mild sternal pain at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Although patients undergoing surgical correction of noninfectious 
sternal dehiscence fare better than those with infectious complications, optimal 
sternal approximation during the initial procedure and sternal precautions 
during convalescence should be emphasized to prevent recurrent complications.

patients.

BACKGROUND: Unifocalization of major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) 
in pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and intracardiac repair has 
become the standard of care. However, there are no reports addressing 
unifocalization of MAPCAs in single-ventricle patients. It is unknown whether 
their pulmonary vascular bed can be reconstructed and low enough pulmonary 
vascular resistance achieved to allow for superior or total cavopulmonary 
connections.
METHODS: We reviewed data on all patients with functional single ventricles and 
unifocalization procedures of MAPCAs. From 1997 to 2005, 14 consecutive children 
with various single-ventricle anatomies were operated on.
RESULTS: Patients had a median of three surgical procedures (range, 1 to 5). Two 
patients had absent, all others diminutive central pulmonary arteries, with an 
average of 3.5 +/- 1.2 MAPCAs. Seven patients (50%) had bidirectional Glenn 
procedures, and 3 of these had Fontan procedures. Median postoperative pulmonary 
artery pressures measured 12.5 mm Hg (Glenn) and 14 mm Hg (Fontan), 
respectively. Six patients are alive today (46%), with 1 patient lost to 
follow-up. Three patients died early and 3 late after initial unifocalization to 
shunts. One other patient survived unifocalization, but was not considered a 
candidate for a Glenn procedure and died after high-risk two-ventricle repair. 
Another patient with right-ventricle-dependent coronary circulation died of 
sepsis late after Glenn.
CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients with functional single ventricles and MAPCAs, 
the pulmonary vascular bed can be reconstructed sufficiently to allow for 
cavopulmonary connections. Venous flow to the pulmonary vasculature decreases 
cardiac volume load and is likely to increase life expectancy and quality of 
life for these patients.

BACKGROUND: Results of thymectomy in patients with myasthenia gravis need to be 
reported in a standardized way to allow accurate comparison.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of 107 patients with myasthenia 
gravis without thymoma. Patients were followed-up for more than 12 months after 
thoracoscopic thymectomy and analyzed according to Myasthenia Gravis Foundation 
of America Recommendations for Clinical Research Standards.
RESULTS: The study population was aged 8 to 60 years old and included 15 men 
(14%) and 92 women (86%). A right-side approach was used in 36 patients, and the 
remaining 71 patients had a left-side approach. Mortality was 0% and morbidity 
was 9.34%. The mean operative time was 90 +/- 45 minutes. The histologic 
diagnosis of the resected thymus was hyperplasia (78.5%), atrophy (15%), and 
normal status (6.5%). The mean length of hospitalization was 2.3 days (range, 2 
to 6 days). The mean follow-up was 36.4 months (range, 12 to 74 months). The 
rate of complete stable remission was 59.5% by the end of postoperative year 6. 
An earlier onset age and early operation were significantly associated with 
complete stable remission and pharmacologic remission. A comparison of right 
side versus left side approach showed similarities in mean operative time, mean 
length of hospitalization, histopathologic results, and remission rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of the thoracoscopic approach in myasthenia gravis without 
thymoma were similar to those provided by open surgery, with the acknowledged 
benefits of minimally invasive surgery and good patient acceptance.

BACKGROUND: The outcomes of a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy for 
lung cancer, with a special focus on its locoregional control, were compared 
with a conventional lobectomy.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 160 patients who had undergone a 
lobectomy either by means of thoracoscopic surgery (n = 81) or a standard 
thoracotomy (n = 79) for clinical T1N0M0 nonsmall-cell lung cancer. The overall, 
disease-free, and locoregional recurrence-free survival were compared. In a 
separate multivariate analysis, the ability of numerous clinical and surgical 
factors, including the surgical approach, to predict locoregional recurrence was 
investigated.
RESULTS: The total recurrence of the primary disease occurred in 28 cases (12 
locoregional and 14 distant). In the 12 documented local recurrences, 8 belonged 
to the thoracoscopic surgery group and 4 were in the standard thoracotomy group, 
without significant differences (p = 0.229). The overall 5-year survival rates 
associated with the thoracoscopic and standard procedure were 89.1% and 77.7%, 
respectively (p = 0.149). No significant differences in the disease-free or 
locoregional recurrence-free survivals were observed between the groups. The 
results of a multivariate analysis for the incidence of total and locoregional 
recurrence demonstrated that two covariates, lymph node metastasis and the 
surgical side (right or left lung), were significant factors for both total and 
locoregional recurrence. No significant relationship was found between 
thoracoscopic surgery or standard thoracotomy, and the incidence of locoregional 
recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that thoracoscopic surgery is not inferior 
regarding its ability to achieve locoregional control in comparison with the 
standard procedure.

BACKGROUND: Few reports have described surgery for lung cancer in patients with 
liver cirrhosis. The objective of this study was to clarify the efficacy of 
surgical treatment and evaluate its postoperative outcome.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of 17 patients between 
1985 and 2005 who were found to have nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with 
liver cirrhosis. The grading of the severity of liver cirrhosis was made 
according to the Child-Pugh classification.
RESULTS: Four patients were classified as Child-Pugh class A, whereas another 13 
patients were classified as Child-Pugh class B. Of these 17 patients, 11 
underwent lobectomies, 3 underwent pneumonectomies, and 3 underwent wedge 
resections. The only patient who experienced hospital death (5.9%) was a male 
patient with Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis. There were five 
respiratory-associated postoperative complications including pneumonia, bleeding 
from the staple line, and prolonged air leak. The morbidity rate was 29.5%. 
Median duration of chest tube insertion was 6.8 days, and mean volume of pleural 
effusion was 1,015.0 mL at 3 days total postoperatively. A total of 9 deaths 
occurred during follow-up (3 from cancer, 4 from hepatic failure, 1 from cardiac 
causes, and 1 unknown). The overall survival was 87.8%, 57.0%, and 45.6% at 1, 
3, and 5 years, respectively. None of the patients experienced morbidity or 
mortality in Child-Pugh class A, but class B had 30.8% morbidity and 7.6% 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment may be an acceptable and valuable approach for 
NSCLC patients who also have low severity liver cirrhosis.

BACKGROUND: The significance of tumor cell type on survival after esophageal 
resection for carcinoma is uncertain. We reviewed our experience in order to 
compare the outcome in the two main histologic groups.
METHODS: Between January 1987 and April 2000, 621 patients underwent 
esophagectomy with curative intention for squamous cell carcinoma or 
adenocarcinoma. The postoperative outcomes of patients with adenocarcinoma and 
squamous cell carcinoma were compared.
RESULTS: Of the cohort, 424 patients had adenocarcinoma (group A) and 197 had 
squamous cell carcinoma (group B). The commonest approach in group A was a left 
thoracotomy (67%), while in group B, it was an Ivor Lewis resection (55%) (p < 
0.0001). Operative mortality was 3.5% for group A and 8.1% for group B (p = 
0.03). Cardiorespiratory complication rate was similar, but anastomotic leaks 
occurred more frequently in group B (4.2% vs 8.6%, p = 0.04). Patients in group 
B tended to have earlier pathologic tumor, node, metastasis (pTNM) stage (p = 
0.06). Overall, survival was significantly better for group B (p = 0.003). Group 
B had a significantly better survival than group A in lymph node (LN) negative 
status (p = 0.01), and a relatively improved survival in LN positive status (p = 
0.35). On multivariate analysis, squamous cell subtype (p = 0.034), pTNM stage 
(p = 0.005), LN status (p = 0.008), and completeness of resection (p = 0.028) 
were significant predictors of survival.
CONCLUSIONS: After esophagectomy, patients with squamous cell carcinoma have a 
poorer perioperative outcome as compared with those with adenocarcinoma. 
However, in the longer term, squamous cell type appears to confer a significant 
survival advantage.
