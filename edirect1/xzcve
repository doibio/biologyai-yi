Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease: An Overview.

Turcios NL.

Although better insights into the natural course of cystic fibrosis (CF) have 
led to treatment approaches that have improved pulmonary health and increased 
the life expectancy of individuals with this disorder, lung disease remains the 
main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. Evidence suggests 
that airway epithelial defects in ions-water transport lead to dehydrated mucus, 
impaired mucus clearance, and mucus adhesion to airway surfaces. An increase in 
mucin secretion is also suggested by the formation of endobronchial mucus 
plaques and plugs, which become the main sites of air flow obstruction, 
infection, and inflammation conducing to early small airways disease followed by 
the development of bronchiectasis. The lung involvement is usually progressive 
with intermittent exacerbations. Aggressive management and advances in treatment 
delay, but, do not prevent progression of lung disease. Respiratory failure 
ensues and is the major cause of death. The lung parenchyma is virtually 
untouched for much of the course of the disease. This review focuses on the lung 
involvement in cystic fibrosis and summarizes new developments on the diagnostic 
approach of CF and pathogenesis of related lung disease. Current therapeutic 
modalities, novel therapies targeting the basic genetic defect, and lung 
transplantation are also reviewed.

For patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors, radiation therapy plays a 
central role in treatment. However, despite its efficacy, cranial radiation is 
associated with a range of side effects ranging from mild cognitive impairment 
to overt brain necrosis. Given the negative effects on patient quality of life, 
radiation-induced neurotoxicities have been the subject of intense study for 
decades. Photon-based therapy has been and largely remains the standard of care 
for the treatment of brain tumors. This is particularly true for patients with 
metastatic tumors who may need treatment to the whole brain or those with very 
aggressive tumors and a limited life expectancy. Particle therapy is now 
becoming more widely available for clinical use with the two most common 
particles used being protons and carbon ions. For patients with favorable 
prognoses, particularly childhood brain tumors, proton therapy is increasingly 
used for treatment. This is, in part, driven by the desire to reduce the 
potential for radiation-induced side effects, including lasting cognitive 
impairment, which may potentially be achieved by reducing dose to normal tissues 
using the unique physical properties of particle therapy. There is also interest 
in using carbon ion therapy for the treatment of aggressive brain tumors, as 
this form of particle therapy not only spares normal tissues but may also 
improve tumor control. The biological effects of particle therapy, both proton 
and carbon, may differ substantially from those of photon radiation. In this 
review, we briefly describe the unique physical properties of particle therapy 
that produce differential biological effects. Focusing on the effects of various 
radiation types on brain parenchyma, we then describe biological effects and 
potential mechanisms underlying these, comparing to photon studies and 
highlighting potential clinical implications.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia in elderly. Increasing 
life expectancy is behind the growing prevalence of AD worldwide with 
approximately 45 million cases currently documented and projection studies 
suggesting a triplication of this number by 2050. Mexico does not have an 
accurate AD registry, but 860,000 cases were reported in 2014 and the prediction 
reaches 3.5 million cases by 2050. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles 
represent the main hallmarks of AD, being constituted of amyloid beta (Aβ) 
peptide and phosphorylated tau, respectively. The risk factors for AD include 
genetic mutations, lifestyle and environmental pollution. Particularly, lead 
(Pb) has attracted attention due to its ability to target multiple pathways 
involved in the pathophysiology of AD. Although the epidemiological data are 
limiting, animal and in vitro studies show growing evidence of causal effects of 
Pb exposure on AD-linked features including Aβ aggregation and tau 
phosphorylation. Interestingly, many Pb effects occur selectively following 
early-life exposure to the metal, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism. This 
hypothesis is supported by changes in DNA methylation and microRNA expression 
patterns inflicted by early-life Pb exposure. Pb pollution in Mexico represents 
a significant problem because past and current mining activities, historical use 
of Pb as fuel additive and culturally rooted use of Pb in glazed ceramics, 
contribute to high levels of Pb pollution in Mexico. In this review we will 
discuss potential risks of AD development in Mexican populations chronically 
exposed to Pb in their childhood.

Schizophrenia patients have higher mortality rates and lower life expectancy 
than the general population. However, forensic investigations of their deaths 
often fail to determine the cause of death, hindering prevention. As 
schizophrenia is a highly heritable condition and given recent advances in our 
understanding of the genetics of schizophrenia, it is now possible to 
investigate how genetic factors may contribute to mortality. We made use of 
findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to design a targeted panel 
(PsychPlex) for sequencing of exons of 451 genes near index single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) identified with GWAS. We sequenced the DNA of 95 deceased 
schizophrenia patients included in SURVIVE, a prospective, autopsy-based study 
of mentally ill persons in Denmark. We compared the allele frequencies of 1039 
SNPs in these cases with the frequencies of 2000 Danes without psychiatric 
diseases and calculated their deleteriousness (CADD) scores. For 81 SNPs highly 
associated with schizophrenia and CADD scores above 15, expression profiles in 
the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project indicated that these variants were 
in exons, whose expressions are increased in several types of brain tissues, 
particularly in the cerebellum. Molecular pathway analysis indicated the 
involvement of 163 different pathways. As for rare SNP variants, most variants 
were scored as either benign or likely benign with an average of 17 variants of 
unknown significance per individual and no pathogenic variant. Our results 
highlight the potential of DNA sequencing of an exon panel to discover genetic 
factors that may be involved in the development of schizophrenia.

The increase in life expectancy together with better care of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) has led to higher proportions of elderly individuals with RA. 
This has challenged the treatment of the disease in older aged patients, usually 
characterized by comorbid conditions and polypharmacy. Overall, the lung 
involvement in RA is present in up to 80% of patients, depending on the 
assessment tools used, and interstitial abnormalities are among the most common; 
when present, interstitial lung disease (ILD) worsens the prognosis of RA, and 
is the second most common cause of mortality. The aged lung undergoes functional 
and structural changes termed immunosenescence and inflammaging, which 
facilitate the occurrence of fibrosis of the lung. Therefore, ILD tends to occur 
more frequently in older patients with RA. The age at onset of RA distinguishes 
patients as having young-onset RA (YORA, < 60 years) or late-onset RA 
(LORA, > 60 years); the latter are characterized by more severe features of the 
disease and higher rates of lung involvement. The most frequent RA-related ILD 
radiological pattern is usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP); this includes 
peripheral and basal predominant reticulation and honeycombing with or without 
associated traction bronchiectasis. Patients with the UIP pattern are usually 
older and have more rapid decline in lung function and a worse prognosis. 
Treatment with corticosteroids in elderly patients carries the risk of adverse 
effects, such as osteoporosis, infections, diabetes, peptic ulcers, and 
cataract. The use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is generally 
well-tolerated by the elderly. The current narrative review aims at elucidating 
the association between ILD and RA in older individuals.

BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis 
(DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is an important cause of post-surgery 
morbidity and mortality. However, it is unclear whether thromboprophylaxis with 
the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin after non-orthopedic surgery 
could balance the cost and clinical outcomes or not.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of enoxaparin for the universal prophylaxis of VTE and associated long-term 
complications in patients after non-orthopedic surgery compared with no 
prevention in a Chinese healthcare setting.
METHODS: A decision model, which included both acute VTE and long-term 
complications, was developed to assess the economic outcomes of the two 
strategies for patients after non-orthopedic surgery. Quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) and direct medical costs were measured over a 5-year horizon. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated.
RESULTS: Compared with no prevention, patients under enoxaparin treatment with 
Caprini risk scores of 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and ≥ 9 increased by 0.012, 0.017, 0.034, 
and 0.102 in QALYs, respectively. The results were either that ICERs of 
thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin over no prevention were lower than the 
thresholds or that thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin was dominant. For patients 
with a Caprini risk score ≥ 9, thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin is dominant 
across the whole drug use duration range. The sensitivity analysis confirmed the 
results.
CONCLUSIONS: As the first analysis evaluating the economic outcomes of 
enoxaparin in patients undergoing general non-orthopedic surgery, this study 
suggests that thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin is highly cost-effective 
compared with no prevention in patients with Caprini risk score ≥ 3.

NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? The effects of 
long-term muscle disuse on neuromuscular function are unclear because disuse 
studies are typically short term. In this study, we used a new model (unilateral 
transtibial amputees) to investigate the effects of long-term disuse on 
quadriceps neuromuscular function. What is the main finding and its importance? 
Kinetic analysis (knee-extension moments during gait) indicated habitual disuse 
of the amputated limb quadriceps, accompanied by lower quadriceps muscle 
strength (60-76%) and neural activation (32-44%), slower contractile properties 
and altered muscle architecture in the amputated limb, which could not be 
predicted from short-term disuse studies.
ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to determine: (i) whether individuals 
with unilateral transtibial amputations (ITTAs), who habitually disuse the 
quadriceps muscles of their amputated limb, provide an effective model for 
assessing the effects of long-term muscle disuse; and (ii) the effects of such 
disuse on quadriceps muscle strength and neuromuscular function in this 
population. Nine ITTAs and nine control subjects performed isometric voluntary 
knee extensions of both limbs to assess maximal voluntary torque (MVT) and the 
rate of torque development (RTD). The interpolated twitch technique and EMG 
normalized to maximal M-wave were used to assess neural activation, involuntary 
(twitch and octet) contractions to assess intrinsic contractile properties, and 
ultrasound images of the vastus lateralis to assess muscle architecture. 
Clinical gait analysis was used to measure knee kinetic data during walking at 
an habitual speed. The ITTAs displayed 54-60% lower peak knee-extensor moments 
during walking in the amputated compared with intact/control limbs, but the 
intact and control limbs were comparable for loading during walking and muscle 
strength variables, suggesting that the intact limb provides a suitable internal 
control for comparison with the disused amputated limb. The MVT and RTD were ∼60 
and ∼75% lower, respectively, in the amputated than intact/control limbs. The 
differences in MVT appeared to be associated with ∼40 and ∼43% lower muscle 
thickness and neural activation, respectively, and the differences in RTD 
appeared to be associated with the decline in MVT coupled with slowing of the 
intrinsic contractile properties. These results indicate considerable changes in 
strength and neuromuscular function with long-term disuse that could not be 
predicted from short-term disuse studies.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess whether a counselor-initiated (CI) 
adaptation of the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) intensive lifestyle 
intervention in a military setting was cost-effective relative to a self-paced 
(SP) adaptation.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis from a payer perspective was 
performed alongside a 2014-2017 randomized behavioral weight loss trial among 
248 active-duty military personnel stationed at a US Air Force base in Texas. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for weight loss, 
reductions in waist circumference, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: After 12 months, the CI adaptation cost more per participant compared 
with the SP adaptation ($1,081 vs. $120) but achieved greater weight loss (1.86 
kg vs. 0.06 kg), greater reductions in waist circumference (1.85 cm vs. 0.48 
cm), and more QALYs (0.871 vs. 0.856). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
for the CI adaptation relative to the SP adaptation was $61,268 per additional 
QALY. At willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY, the CI 
adaptation was 45% and 49% likely to be cost-effective, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The CI delivery of the Look AHEAD Intensive Lifestyle Intervention 
may offer a cost-effective approach to tackle excess weight in the US military.

BACKGROUND: The use of artificial nutrition, defined as a medical treatment that 
allows a non-oral mechanical feeding, for cancer patients with limited life 
expectancy is deemed nonbeneficial. High-quality evidence about the use of 
artificial nutrition near the end of life is lacking. This study aimed (a) to 
quantify the use of artificial nutrition near the end-of-life, and (b) to 
identify the factors associated with the use of artificial nutrition.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of decedents based on data from 
the French national hospital database. The study population included adult 
cancer patients who died in hospitals in France between 2013 and 2016 and 
defined to be in a palliative condition. Use of artificial nutrition during the 
last 7 days before death was the primary endpoint.
RESULTS: A total of 398 822 patients were included. The median duration of the 
last hospital stay was 10 (interquartile range, 4-21) days. The artificial 
nutrition was used for 11 723 (2.9%) during the last 7 days before death. Being 
a man, younger, having digestive cancers, metastasis, comorbidities, 
malnutrition, absence of dementia, and palliative care use were the main factors 
associated to the use of artificial nutrition.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the use of artificial nutrition near the 
end of life is in keeping with current clinical guidelines. The identification 
of factors associated with the use of artificial nutrition, such as cancer 
localization, presence of comorbidities or specific symptoms, may help to better 
manage its use.

Access Clinic: A student-run clinic model to address gaps in the healthcare 
needs of the homeless population in Adelaide.

Konduru L(1).

Author information:
(1)BTech, MS, medical student, Flinders University College of Medicine and 
Public Health, SA.

BACKGROUND: The average life expectancy of people who are homeless is 
approximately 20 years lower than the general population. Lack of access to 
healthcare is one of the key contributors to the increased morbidity and 
mortality.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to describe a student-run clinic that was 
established at a homeless shelter in Adelaide, Australia, to improve healthcare 
access for individuals who are homeless.
DISCUSSION: By enhancing the target population's health literacy, the clinic 
functioned as a bridge between healthcare services and individuals experiencing 
homelessness who were disengaged from society. Such clinics, if encouraged, can 
foster a symbiotic relationship where students learn clinical medicine while 
gaining experience in providing healthcare to vulnerable individuals, and 
individuals who are homeless can access much-needed services in an environment 
they already engage with and feel safe in.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy increases, more people have chronic psychiatric 
and medical health disorders. Comorbidity may increase the risk of premature 
mortality, an important challenge for health service delivery.
METHODS: Population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada of all 11 246 910 
residents aged ⩾16 and <105 on 1 April 2012 and alive on 31 March 2014. 
Secondary analyses included subjects having common medical disorders in 10 
separate cohorts. Exposures were psychiatric morbidity categories identified 
using aggregated diagnosis groups (ADGs) from Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical 
Groups software® (v10.0); ADG 25: Persistent/Recurrent unstable conditions; e.g. 
acute schizophrenic episode, major depressive disorder (recurrent episode), ADG 
24: Persistent/Recurrent stable conditions; e.g. depressive disorder, paranoid 
personality disorder, ADG 23: Time-limited/minor conditions; e.g. adjustment 
reaction with brief depressive reaction. The outcome was all-cause mortality 
(April 2014-March 2016).
RESULTS: Over 2 years' follow-up, there were 188 014 deaths (1.7%). ADG 25 
conferred an almost threefold excess mortality after adjustment compared to 
having no psychiatric morbidity [adjusted hazard ratio 2.94 (95% CI 2.91-2.98, p 
< 0.0001)]. Adjusted hazard ratios for ADG 24 and ADG 23 were 1.12 (95% CI 
1.11-1.14, p < 0.0001) and 1.31 (95% CI 1.26-1.36, p < 0.0001). In all 10 
medical disorder cohorts, ADG 25 carried significantly greater mortality risk 
compared to no psychiatric comorbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric disorders, particularly those graded 
persistent/recurrent and unstable, were associated with excess mortality in the 
whole population, and in the medical disorder cohorts examined. Future research 
should examine whether service design accounting for psychiatric disorder 
comorbidity improves outcomes across the spectrum of medical disorders.

The effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy and its increasing availability 
globally means that millions of people living with HIV now have a much longer 
life expectancy. However, people living with HIV have disproportionately high 
incidence of major comorbidities and reduced health-related quality of life. 
Health systems must respond to this situation by pioneering care and service 
delivery models that promote wellness rather than mere survival. In this Series 
paper, we review evidence about the emerging challenges of the care of people 
with HIV beyond viral suppression and identify four priority areas for action: 
integrating HIV services and non-HIV services, reducing HIV-related 
discrimination in health-care settings, identifying indicators to monitor health 
systems' progress toward new goals, and catalysing new forms of civil society 
engagement in the more broadly focused HIV response that is now needed 
worldwide. Furthermore, in the context of an increasing burden of chronic 
diseases, we must consider the shift that is underway in the HIV field in 
relation to burgeoning policy and programmatic efforts to promote healthy 
ageing.

OBJECTIVE: To determine how the UK National Health Service (NHS) is performing 
relative to health systems of other high income countries, given that it is 
facing sustained financial pressure, increasing levels of demand, and cuts to 
social care.
DESIGN: Observational study using secondary data from key international 
organisations such as Eurostat and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development.
SETTING: Healthcare systems of the UK and nine high income comparator countries: 
Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the US.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 79 indicators across seven domains: population and 
healthcare coverage, healthcare and social spending, structural capacity, 
utilisation, access to care, quality of care, and population health.
RESULTS: The UK spent the least per capita on healthcare in 2017 compared with 
all other countries studied (UK $3825 (£2972; €3392); mean $5700), and spending 
was growing at slightly lower levels (0.02% of gross domestic product in the 
previous four years, compared with a mean of 0.07%). The UK had the lowest rates 
of unmet need and among the lowest numbers of doctors and nurses per capita, 
despite having average levels of utilisation (number of hospital admissions). 
The UK had slightly below average life expectancy (81.3 years compared with a 
mean of 81.7) and cancer survival, including breast, cervical, colon, and rectal 
cancer. Although several health service outcomes were poor, such as 
postoperative sepsis after abdominal surgery (UK 2454 per 100 000 discharges; 
mean 2058 per 100 000 discharges), 30 day mortality for acute myocardial 
infarction (UK 7.1%; mean 5.5%), and ischaemic stroke (UK 9.6%; mean 6.6%), the 
UK achieved lower than average rates of postoperative deep venous thrombosis 
after joint surgery and fewer healthcare associated infections.
CONCLUSIONS: The NHS showed pockets of good performance, including in health 
service outcomes, but spending, patient safety, and population health were all 
below average to average at best. Taken together, these results suggest that if 
the NHS wants to achieve comparable health outcomes at a time of growing 
demographic pressure, it may need to spend more to increase the supply of labour 
and long term care and reduce the declining trend in social spending to match 
levels of comparator countries.

Hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis is a rare, inherited, 
progressively debilitating, and often fatal disease caused by deposition of 
mutated transthyretin (TTR) protein. Patisiran is an RNA interference 
therapeutic comprising a novel small interfering ribonucleic acid (ALN-18328) 
formulated with 2 novel lipid excipients, DLin-MC3-DMA and PEG2000 -C-DMG, in a 
lipid nanoparticle targeted to inhibit hepatic TTR synthesis. Here we report the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of ALN-18328, DLin-MC3-DMA, and PEG2000 -C-DMG from a 
phase 2 multiple-ascending-dose study and its open-label extension (OLE) in 
patients with hATTR amyloidosis. Twenty-nine patients received 2 intravenous 
infusions of patisiran of 0.01, 0.05, 0.15, or 0.3 mg/kg at 3- or 4-week 
intervals; of these, 27 patients received 0.3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks over 
24 months in the OLE study. Plasma PK profiles of ALN-18328 and DLin-MC3-DMA 
exhibited 2 phases, the first characterized by a short distribution half-life 
and the second by a minor peak and relatively long terminal elimination 
half-life. PK exposures to 3 analytes increased proportionally across the dose 
range of 0.01 to 0.3 mg/kg. For ALN-18328, mean terminal elimination half-life 
was 3.2 days, mean total clearance was 3.0 mL/h/kg, and urinary excretion was 
negligible. All 3 analytes exhibited stable PK profiles with chronic dosing over 
2 years. The 2- to 3-fold plasma accumulation (AUCτ ) of ALN-18328 at steady 
state is attributable to the association of ALN-18328 with the cationic lipid 
DLin-MC3-DMA. There was no appreciable accumulation of PEG2000 -C-DMG.

STUDY QUESTION: What is the safety and efficacy profile during long-term 
(12-24 months) uninterrupted treatment with the selective progesterone receptor 
modulator asoprisnil, 10 and 25 mg in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) 
associated with uterine fibroids?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Uninterrupted treatment with asoprisnil should be avoided due to 
endometrial safety concerns and unknown potential long-term consequences.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Asoprisnil was well tolerated in shorter-term studies and 
effectively suppressed HMB and reduced fibroid volume.
STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: Women with uterine fibroids who had previously 
received placebo (n = 87) or asoprisnil 10 mg (n = 221) or 25 mg (n = 215) for 
12 months in two double-blind studies entered this randomized uncontrolled 
extension study and received up to 12 additional months of treatment followed by 
6 months of post-treatment follow-up. Women who previously received placebo were 
re-randomized to either asoprisnil 10 or 25 mg for the extension study. This 
report focuses on the 436 women who received asoprisnil in the double-blind 
studies and this extension study. Results for women who previously received 
placebo in the double-blind studies are not described.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: Women ≥18 years of age who completed a 
12-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, had estradiol levels 
indicating that they were not menopausal and had no endometrial hyperplasia or 
other significant endometrial pathology were eligible. The safety endpoints were 
focused on endometrial assessments. The composite primary efficacy endpoint was 
the proportion of women who demonstrated a response to treatment by meeting all 
three of the following criteria at the final month for participants who 
prematurely discontinued or at month 12 for those who completed the study: a 
reduction from initial baseline to final visit of ≥50% in the menstrual 
pictogram score, hemoglobin concentration ≥11 g/dl or an increase of ≥1 g/dl 
from initial baseline at the final visit, and no surgical or invasive 
intervention for uterine fibroids. Other efficacy endpoints included rates for 
amenorrhea and suppression of bleeding, changes in fibroid and uterine volume 
and changes in hematologic parameters. No statistical tests were planned or 
performed for this uncontrolled study.
MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: Imaging studies revealed a progressive increase 
in endometrial thickness and cystic changes that frequently prompted invasive 
diagnostic procedures. Endometrial biopsy results were consistent with 
antiproliferative effects of asoprisnil. Two cases of endometrial cancer were 
diagnosed. At the final month of this extension study (total duration of 
uninterrupted treatment up to 24 months), the primary efficacy endpoint was 
achieved in 86 and 92% of women in the asoprisnil 10- and 25-mg groups, 
respectively. During each month of treatment, amenorrhea was observed in the 
majority of women (up to 77 and 94% at 10 and 25 mg, respectively). There was a 
progressive, dose-dependent decrease in the volume of the primary fibroid with 
asoprisnil 10 and 25 mg (-55.7 and -75.2% median decrease, respectively, from 
baseline [i.e. the beginning of the placebo-controlled study] to month 12 
[cumulative months 12-24] of this extension study). These effects were 
associated with improvements in quality of life measures.
LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was uncontrolled, which limits the 
interpretation of safety and efficacy findings. The study also had multiple 
protocol amendments with the addition of diagnostic procedures and, because no 
active comparator was included, the potential place of asoprisnil in comparison 
to therapies such as GnRH agonists and surgery cannot be determined.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Long-term, uninterrupted treatment with 
asoprisnil leads to prominent cystic endometrial changes that are consistent 
with the 'late progesterone receptor modulator' effects, which prompted invasive 
diagnostic procedures, although treatment efficacy is maintained. Although 
endometrial cancers were uncommon during both treatment and follow-up, these 
findings raise concerns regarding endometrial safety during uninterrupted 
long-term treatment with asoprisnil. This study shows that uninterrupted 
treatment with asoprisnil should be avoided due to safety concerns and unknown 
potential long-term consequences.

GATA factors play central roles in the programming of blood and cardiac cells 
during embryonic development. Using the experimentally accessible Xenopus and 
zebrafish models, we report observations regarding the roles of GATA-2 in the 
development of blood stem cells and GATA-4, -5, and -6 in cardiac development. 
We show that blood stem cells develop from the dorsal lateral plate mesoderm and 
GATA-2 is required at multiple stages. Firstly, GATA-2 is required to make the 
cells responsive to VEGF-A signalling by driving the synthesis of its receptor, 
FLK-1/KDR. This leads to differentiation into the endothelial cells that form 
the dorsal aorta. GATA-2 is again required for the endothelial-to-haematopoietic 
transition that takes place later in the floor of the dorsal aorta. GATA-2 
expression is dependent on BMP signalling for each of these inputs into blood 
stem cell programming. GATA-4, -5, and -6 work together to ensure the 
specification of cardiac cells during development. We have demonstrated 
redundancy within the family and also some evolution of the functions of the 
different family members. Interestingly, one of the features that varies in 
evolution is the timing of expression relative to other key regulators such as 
Nkx2.5 and BMP. We show that the GATA factors, Nkx2.5 and BMP regulate each 
other and it would appear that what is critical is the mutually supportive 
network of expression rather than the order of expression of each of the 
component genes. In Xenopus and zebrafish, the cardiac mesoderm is adjacent to 
an anterior population of cells giving rise to blood and endothelium. This 
population is not present in mammals and we have shown that, like the cardiac 
population, the blood and endothelial precursors require GATA-4, -5, and -6 for 
their development. Later, blood-specific or cardiac-specific regulators 
determine the ultimate fate of the cells, and we show that these regulators act 
cross-antagonistically. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling drives the 
cardiac fate, and we propose that the anterior extension of the FGF signalling 
field during evolution led to the recruitment of the blood and endothelial 
precursors into the heart field ultimately resulting in a larger four chambered 
heart. Zebrafish are able to successfully regenerate their hearts after injury. 
To understand the pathways involved, with a view to determining why humans 
cannot do this, we profiled gene expression in the cardiomyocytes before and 
after injury, and compared those proximal to the injury with those more distal. 
We were able to identify an enhancement of the expression of regulators of the 
canonical Wnt pathway proximal to the injury, suggesting that changes in Wnt 
signalling are responsible for the repair response to injury.

INTRODUCTION: SHP656 is the first factor VIII (FVIII) product developed using 
polysialylation (PSA) technology, in which full-length recombinant (r) FVIII 
(anti-haemophilic factor [recombinant]) is conjugated with a 20 kDa PSA polymer.
AIM: To compare the safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics of SHP656 vs the 
parent rFVIII (octocog alfa) after single infusions of 25-75 IU/kg in patients 
with severe haemophilia A (FVIII activity <1%).
METHODS: Multinational, phase 1, prospective, open-label, two-period, 
fixed-sequence, dose-escalation trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02716194). Patients 
received single doses of rFVIII and then SHP656 sequentially at the same dose: 
25 ± 3 IU/kg (Cohort 1), 50 ± 5 IU/kg (Cohort 2) and 75 ± 5 IU/kg (Cohort 3).
RESULTS: Forty patients received rFVIII: 11 in Cohort 1, 16 in Cohort 2 and 13 
in Cohort 3. Two patients withdrew before receiving SHP656, leaving 38 patients 
who completed the study and received both treatments. No treatment-related 
adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, deaths, study withdrawals, thrombotic events 
or allergic reactions were reported; and no significant treatment-related 
changes in laboratory parameters or vital signs. No patients developed FVIII 
inhibitors or antibodies to PSA. FVIII activity was significantly prolonged 
following SHP656 administration vs rFVIII with an approximately 1.5-fold 
extension in mean residence time (P < .05). Exposure increased proportional to 
the SHP656 dose over the 25-75 IU/kg dose range.
CONCLUSION: Polysialylation of rFVIII confers a half-life extension similar to 
that of approved extended half-life products that use either PEGylation or Fc 
fusion technology and was not associated with any treatment-related adverse 
events.
