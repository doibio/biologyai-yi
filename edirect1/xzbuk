BACKGROUND: Childhood tension-type headache (TTH) is a prevalent and 
debilitating condition for the child and family. Low-cost nonpharmacological 
treatments are usually the first choice of professionals and parents. This study 
examined the outcomes of specific strength training for girls with TTH.
METHODS: Forty-nine girls aged 9-18 years with TTH were randomized to patient 
education programs with 10 weeks of strength training and compared with those 
who were counseled by a nurse and physical therapist. Primary outcomes were 
headache frequency, intensity, and duration; secondary outcomes were 
neck-shoulder muscle strength, aerobic power, and pericranial tenderness, 
measured at baseline, after 10 weeks intervention, and at 12 weeks follow-up. 
Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires were assessed at baseline 
and after 24 months.
RESULTS: For both groups, headache frequency decreased significantly, P=0.001, 
as did duration, P=0.022, with no significant between-group differences. The 
odds of having headache on a random day decreased over the 22 weeks by 0.65 
(0.50-0.84) (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]). For both groups, neck 
extension strength decreased significantly with a decrease in cervicothoracic 
extension/flexion ratio to 1.7, indicating a positive change in muscle balance. 
In the training group, shoulder strength increased $10% in 5/20 girls and 
predicted [Formula: see text] increased $15% for 4/20 girls. In the training 
group, 50% of girls with a headache reduction of $30% had an increase in 
[Formula: see text] >5%. For the counseling group, this was the case for 29%. A 
24-month follow-up on HRQOL for the pooled sample revealed statistically 
significant improvements. Fifty-five percent of the girls reported little to 
none disability.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that both physical health and HRQOL can be 
influenced significantly by physical exercise and nurse counseling. More 
research is needed to examine the relationship between physical exercise, 
[Formula: see text], and TTH in girls. Thus, empowering patient education to 
promote maximum possible outcomes for all children needs more attention.

INTRODUCTION: The blood count is a routine laboratory test prescribed to 
patients suffering from high blood pressure. This study aims to describe the 
results of blood count from hypertensive patients and to identify conditions 
associated.
METHODS: This retrospective and descriptive study concerns the period from the 
1st of December 2012 to 31 th of December 2013 in the laboratory of University 
Hospital Center CHU-HJRB of Antananarivo. All records of results from 
hypertensive patients who requested blood count have been exploited.
RESULTS: Among 151 hypertensive patients, 91 (60.3%) had pathological blood 
counts. Of these, 64 (70.4%) showed one type of abnormality and 27 (29.6%) had 
multiple abnormalities. The anaemia (33.91%), the leukocytosis (33.04%), the 
polycythemia (10.43%) and the leukopenia (9.57%) are the most frequent. Among 
the multiple abnormalities, anaemia associated with leukocytosis is the most 
observed (29.6%). The microcytosis anaemia (41%) and the neutrophil 
polymorphonuclear leukocytosis are the most dominant (47.4%). Patients in 
nephrology (90%) and in endocrinology (81.3%) are the most concerned (p = 
0,008). Hypertensive under 20 years old (100%) and women (61.5%) are the most 
affected (p > 0, 05). The seizures (100%), the edema of the lower limbs (100%) 
and diabetes (70%) are the signs and pathology most encountered.
CONCLUSION: The blood count should be prescribed for all hypertensive patients 
to identify the affections that will be treated simultaneously with the high 
blood pressure. Thus, hypertensive patients will have a good follow-up and their 
life expectancy will be improved.

INTRODUCTION: L'hémogramme est un bilan biologique de routine demandé chez tout 
patient souffrant d'Hypertension Artérielle (HTA). Cette étude se propose de 
décrire les résultats d'hémogramme chez les hypertendus et d'identifier les 
pathologies associées.
MÉTHODES: Il s'agit d'une étude rétrospective type descriptif s’étalant du 01 
Décembre 2012 au 31 Décembre 2013 au laboratoire du Centre 
Hospitalo-Universitaire Hôpital Joseph Raseta Befelatanana (CHU-HJRB) 
d'Antananarivo. Tous les registres des résultats des hypertendus demandant un 
hémogramme ont été exploités.
RÉSULTATS: Parmi les 151 hypertendus, 91 (60,3%) ont présenté des hémogrammes 
pathologiques. Parmi ces derniers, 64 (70,4%) ont montré un seul type d'anomalie 
et 27 (29,6%) des anomalies multiples. Les anémies (33,91%), les 
hyperleucocytoses (33,04%), les polyglobulies (10,43%) et les leucopénies 
(9,57%) sont les plus fréquentes. Pour les anomalies multiples, les anémies 
associées aux hyperleucocytoses sont les plus observées (29,6%). Les anémies 
microcytaires (41%) et les hyperleucocytoses à polynucléaires neutrophiles sont 
les plus dominantes (47,4%). Les patients hospitalisés en néphrologie (90%) et 
en endocrinologie (81,3%) sont les plus concernés (p = 0,008). Les hypertendus 
moins de 20 ans (100%) et les femmes (61,5%) sont les plus affectés (p > 0,05). 
Les crises convulsives (100%), les œdèmes des membres inférieurs (100%) et le 
diabète (70%) sont les signes et pathologies associés les plus rencontrés (p > 
0,05).
CONCLUSION: L'hémogramme doit être prescrit chez tout patient hypertendu pour 
connaître les affections sous-jacentes qui seront traitées simultanément avec 
l'HTA. Ainsi, le patient hypertendu sera pris en charge convenablement et son 
espérance de vie sera améliorée.

INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality of 
women from cancer in the developing World. It is the primary cause of reduced 
life expectancy in Sub-Saharan countries such as Democratic Republic of Congo. 
The aim of this work was to determinate the socio-demographic profile of women 
with precancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix, to determinate the 
frequency of VIA and VILI positive cases and to show the challenges that can be 
faced in managing patients with abnormalities in the city of Mbuji-Mayi in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo.
METHODS: As part of its activities, the "Association de Lutte contre le Cancer 
du Col utérin" (ALCC) organized a community outreach followed by free voluntary 
testing for cervical cancer for two weeks (26(th)March to 10(th) April 2011) at 
the General Referral Hospital Kayembe in Mbuji-Mayi (Democratic Republic of 
Congo).
RESULTS: A total of 229 women were examined. 38% of tests (VIA + VILI) were 
positive with 6 clinically suspected cases of invasive cancer at stage 1 (7% of 
cases). Nearly 70% of patients were still of childbearing age and had started 
their first sexual intercourse before 18 years of age and 86% of cases were 
multiparous. Given the material, financial and technical constraints, 75% of 
patients were placed in a monitoring program of 9 months to 1 year (= 
expectation and another test) while 11% of them were selected for a biopsy to be 
locally practiced and sent to the pathologist. Nearly 8% of the cases were 
candidates for hysterectomy.
CONCLUSION: Given the difficulties encountered and the frequency of positive 
tests, we recommend another study with a larger sample, improved working 
conditions (mainly equipment) and the association of another test such as the 
Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) test.

The majority of tumor cells overcome proliferative limit by expressing 
telomerase. Whether or not telomerase preferentially extends the shortest 
telomeres is still under debate. When human cancer cells are cultured at neutral 
pH, telomerase extends telomeres in telomere length-independent manner. However, 
the microenvironment of tumor is slightly acidic, and it is not yet known how 
this influences telomerase action. Here, we examine telomere length homeostasis 
in tumor cells cultured at pHe 6.8. The results indicate that telomerase 
preferentially extends short telomeres, such that telomere length distribution 
narrows and telomeres become nearly uniform in size. After growth at pHe 6.8, 
the expression of telomerase, TRF1, TRF2 and TIN2 decreases, and the abundance 
of Cajal bodies decreases. Therefore, telomerase are insufficient for extending 
every telomere and shorter telomeres bearing less shelterin proteins are more 
accessible for telomerase recruitment. The findings support the 
'protein-counting mechanism' in which extended and unextended state of telomere 
is determined by the number of associated shelterin proteins and the abundance 
of telomerase. Decreased expression of telomerase and preferential extension of 
short telomeres have important implications for tumor cell viability, and 
generate a strong rationale for research on telomerase-targeted anti-cancer 
therapeutics.

Model organisms subject to dietary restriction (DR) generally live longer. 
Accompanying this lifespan extension are improvements in overall health, based 
on multiple metrics. This indicates that pharmacological treatments that mimic 
the effects of DR could improve health in humans. To find new chemical 
structures that extend lifespan, we screened 30 000 synthetic, diverse drug-like 
chemicals in Caenorhabditis elegans and identified several structurally related 
compounds that acted through DR mechanisms. The most potent of these NP1 
impinges upon a food perception pathway by promoting glutamate signaling in the 
pharynx. This results in the overriding of a GPCR pathway involved in the 
perception of food and which normally acts to decrease glutamate signals. Our 
results describe the activation of a dietary restriction response through the 
pharmacological masking of a novel sensory pathway that signals the presence of 
food. This suggests that primary sensory pathways may represent novel targets 
for human pharmacology.

BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is the most common form of inflammatory 
bowel disease in the UK. UC can have a considerable impact on patients' quality 
of life. The burden for the NHS is substantial.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of interventions, 
to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of all interventions and 
comparators (including medical and surgical options), to estimate the expected 
net budget impact of each intervention, and to identify key research priorities.
DATA SOURCES: Peer-reviewed publications, European Public Assessment Reports and 
manufacturers' submissions. The following databases were searched from inception 
to December 2013 for clinical effectiveness searches and from inception to 
January 2014 for cost-effectiveness searches for published and unpublished 
research evidence: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied 
Health Literature, The Cochrane Library including the Cochrane Systematic 
Reviews Database, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Database of Abstracts of 
Reviews of Effects, the Health Technology Assessment database and NHS Economic 
Evaluation Database; ISI Web of Science, including Science Citation Index, and 
the Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science and Bioscience Information 
Service Previews. The US Food and Drug Administration website and the European 
Medicines Agency website were also searched, as were research registers, 
conference proceedings and key journals.
REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review [including network meta-analysis (NMA)] was 
conducted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of named 
interventions. The health economic analysis included a review of published 
economic evaluations and the development of a de novo model.
RESULTS: Ten randomised controlled trials were included in the systematic 
review. The trials suggest that adult patients receiving infliximab (IFX) 
[Remicade(®), Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd (MSD)], adalimumab (ADA) (Humira(®), 
AbbVie) or golimumab (GOL) (Simponi(®), MSD) were more likely to achieve 
clinical response and remission than those receiving placebo (PBO). 
Hospitalisation data were limited, but suggested more favourable outcomes for 
ADA- and IFX-treated patients. Data on the use of surgical intervention were 
sparse, with a potential benefit for intervention-treated patients. Data were 
available from one trial to support the use of IFX in paediatric patients. 
Safety issues identified included serious infections, malignancies and 
administration site reactions. Based on the NMA, in the induction phase, all 
biological treatments were associated with statistically significant beneficial 
effects relative to PBO, with the greatest effect associated with IFX. For 
patients in response following induction, all treatments except ADA and GOL 
100 mg at 32-52 weeks were associated with beneficial effects when compared with 
PBO, although these were not significant. The greatest effects at 8-32 and 32-52 
weeks were associated with 100 mg of GOL and 5 mg/kg of IFX, respectively. For 
patients in remission following induction, all treatments except ADA at 8-32 
weeks and GOL 50 mg at 32-52 weeks were associated with beneficial effects when 
compared with PBO, although only the effect of ADA at 32-52 weeks was 
significant. The greatest effects were associated with GOL (at 8-32 weeks) and 
ADA (at 32-52 weeks). The economic analysis suggests that colectomy is expected 
to dominate drug therapies, but for some patients, colectomy may not be 
considered acceptable. In circumstances in which only drug options are 
considered, IFX and GOL are expected to be ruled out because of dominance, while 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ADA versus conventional treatment 
is approximately £50,300 per QALY gained.
LIMITATIONS: The health economic model is subject to several limitations: 
uncertainty associated with extrapolating trial data over a lifetime horizon, 
the model does not consider explicit sequential pathways of non-biological 
treatments, and evidence relating to complications of colectomy was identified 
through consideration of approaches used within previous models rather than a 
full systematic review.
CONCLUSIONS: Adult patients receiving IFX, ADA or GOL were more likely to 
achieve clinical response and remission than those receiving PBO. Further data 
are required to conclusively demonstrate the effect of interventions on 
hospitalisation and surgical outcomes. The economic analysis indicates that 
colectomy is expected to dominate medical treatments for moderate to severe UC.

The multi-target colorimetric aptasensors can be easily fabricated by using two 
different aptamer sequences. However, there have been no research reports about 
improvement or enhancing of colorimetric signals based on the aggregation 
properties of AuNPs. Herein, we report a simple and efficient method to control 
and enhance the function of the multi-target aptasensor using an aptamer-aptamer 
linkage method. The aptasensor was developed for highly sensitive 
multiple-target detection of small molecules. The extension of aptamer DNA 
sequences using this method resulted in the enhanced analytical sensitivity of 
this aptasensor in sensing applications for two small molecule targets. 
Furthermore, the mechanism of the interaction between DNA aptamer and AuNPs was 
studied by measuring the zeta potential to explain the enhancement of the 
sensitivity of this multi-target aptasensor. The limit of detection of this 
multi-target aptasensor was found to be 1 nM and 37 nM for kanamycin (KAN) and 
chlortetracycline (CHLOR), respectively. It is 25-fold lower than in the 
previous report using an AuNP-based sensor for defining the limit of detection 
(LOD) of KAN and five times lower than the LOD for CHLOR. This aptasensor has 
great potential in the simultaneous detection of a wide range of KAN and CHLOR 
concentrations.

Lobectomy is a more Cost-Effective Option than Total Thyroidectomy for 1 to 4 cm 
Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma that do not Possess Clinically Recognizable 
High-Risk Features.

BACKGROUND: Although lobectomy is a viable alternative to total thyroidectomy 
(TT) in low-risk 1 to 4 cm papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), lobectomy is 
associated with higher locoregional recurrence risk and need for completion TT 
upon discovery of a previously unrecognized histologic high-risk feature (HRF). 
The present study evaluated long-term cost-effectiveness between lobectomy and 
TT.
METHODS: Our base case was a hypothetical female cohort aged 40 years with a 
low-risk 2.5 cm PTC. A Markov decision tree model was constructed to compare 
cost-effectiveness between lobectomy and TT after 25 years. Patients with an 
unrecognized HRF (including aggressive histology, microscopic extrathyroidal 
extension, lymphovascular invasion, positive resection margin, nodal metastasis 
>5 mm, and multifocality) underwent completion TT after lobectomy. Outcome 
probabilities, utilities, and costs were estimated from the literature. The 
threshold for cost-effectiveness was set at US$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY). Sensitivity and threshold analyses were used to examine model 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: After 25 years, each patient who underwent lobectomy instead of TT cost 
an extra US$772.08 but gained an additional 0.300 QALY. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was US$2577.65/QALY. In the sensitivity analysis, the 
lobectomy arm began to become cost-effective only after 3 years. Despite varying 
the reported prevalence of clinically unrecognized HRFs, complication from 
surgical procedures, annualized recurrence rates, unit cost of surgical 
procedure or complication, and utility score, lobectomy remained more 
cost-effective than TT.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the higher locoregional recurrence risk and having almost 
half of the patients undergoing completion TT after lobectomy upon discovery of 
a previously unrecognized HRF, initial lobectomy was a more cost-effective 
long-term option than initial TT for 1 to 4 cm PTCs without clinically 
recognized HRFs.

Favored by increased life expectancy and reduced birth rate, worldwide 
demography is rapidly shifting to older ages. The golden age of aging is not 
only an achievement but also a big challenge because of the load of the elderly 
on social and medical health care systems. Moreover, the impact of age-related 
decline of attention, memory, reasoning and executive functions on 
self-sufficiency emphasizes the need of interventions to maintain cognitive 
abilities at a useful degree in old age. Recently, neuroscientific research 
explored the chance to apply Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NiBS) techniques 
(as transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation) to healthy aging 
population to preserve or enhance physiologically-declining cognitive functions. 
The present review will update and address the current state of the art on NiBS 
in healthy aging. Feasibility of NiBS techniques will be discussed in light of 
recent neuroimaging (either structural or functional) and neurophysiological 
models proposed to explain neural substrates of the physiologically aging brain. 
Further, the chance to design multidisciplinary interventions to maximize the 
efficacy of NiBS techniques will be introduced as a necessary future direction.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic 
progressive disease that has been spread worldwide over the past three decades 
and associated with increased morbidity and mortality resulting in considerable 
socioeconomic implications for national healthcare systems. Effective management 
of disease is highly needed ensuring patients receive the best possible care 
within the available budget. The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
long-term cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 
(SGLT-2) inhibitor, compared with a sulfonylurea (SU) or a 
dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i), when added to metformin, in T2DM 
patients inadequately controlled on metformin alone in Greece.
METHODS: The published and validated Cardiff diabetes model, a lifetime 
micro-simulation model, was adapted to a Greek healthcare setting to determine 
the incidence of micro- and macro-vascular complications and diabetes-specific 
and all-cause mortality. Clinical, cost, and utility data were retrieved from 
literature and assigned to model parameters to calculate total quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and total costs as well as incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs). The analysis was conducted from the perspective of a third-party 
payer in Greece. Uncertainty surrounding important model parameters was explored 
with univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA).
RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime, dapagliflozin was associated with 0.48 and 
0.04 incremental QALYs compared with SU and DPP-4i, respectively, at additional 
costs of €5142 and €756, respectively. The corresponding ICERs were €10,623 and 
€17,695 per QALY gained versus the treatment with SU and DPP-4i, respectively. 
Results were robust across various univariate and scenario analyses. At the 
defined willingness-to-pay threshold of €34,000 per QALY gained, PSA estimated 
that treatment with dapagliflozin had a 100 % and 79.7 % probability of being 
cost-effective relative to the SU and DPP-4i treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin in combination with metformin was shown to be a 
cost-effective treatment alternative for patients with T2DM whose metformin 
regimen does not provide sufficient glycemic control in a Greek healthcare 
setting.

BACKGROUND: Stomach cancer (SC) is the second leading cause of cancer death with 
the rate of 10.4% in the world. The correlation between the incidence and 
mortality rates of SC and human development index (HDI) has not been globally 
determined. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association between the 
incidence and mortality rates of SC and HDI in various regions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this global ecological study, we used the data about 
the incidence and mortality rate of SC and HDI from the global cancer project 
and the United Nations Development Programme database, respectively.
RESULTS: In 2012, SCs were estimated to have affected a total of 951,594 
individuals (crude rate: 13.5 per 100,000 individuals) with a male/female ratio 
of 1.97, and caused 723,073 deaths worldwide (crude rate: 10.2 per 100,000 
individuals). There was a positive correlation between the HDI and both 
incidence (r=0.28, <0.05) and mortality rates of SC (r=0.13, P = 0.1) in the 
world in 2012.
CONCLUSIONS: The high incidence and mortality rates of SC in countries with high 
and very high HDI is remarkable which should be the top priority of 
interventions for global health policymakers. In addition, health programs 
should be provided to reduce the burden of this disease in the regions with high 
incidence and mortality rates of SC.

BACKGROUND: Liver cancer (LC) is the sixth world most common cancer and the 
second leading cause of cancer death. Due to the importance and necessity of 
awareness about the incidence and mortality of diseases to perform prevention 
programs, this study focused on data for LC and its relationship with the human 
development index (HDI) and its components in Asia in 2012.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This ecological study was based on GLOBOCAN data for 
Asian countries. We assessed correlations between standardized incidence rates 
(SIR) and standardized mortality rates (SMR) of LC with HDI and its components 
using of SPSS18.
RESULTS: A total of 582,420 incident cases and 557,097 deaths were recorded in 
Asian countries in 2012. The five with the highest SIR were Mongolia, Lao PDR, 
Vietnam, Republic of Korea and Thailand and those with the highest SMR were 
Mongolia, Lao PDR, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. A negative relation was 
observed between HDI and LC for SIR of 0.049 (P=0.748) and for SMR of 0.07 
(P=0.645), with life expectancy at birth a positive relation for SIR of 0.061 
(P=0.687) and a negative relation for SMR of 0.079 (P=0.603), with the average 
years of education a negative relation fo SIR of 0.476 (p=0.952) and for SMR of 
0.032 (P=0.832), and with the country income level per person a negative 
relation for SMI of 0.11 (p=0.465) and for SMR of 0.113 (P=0.455).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of LC is more in less developed and developing 
countries but statistically significant correlations were not found between 
standardized incidence and mortality rates of LC, and HDI and its dimensions.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is currently one of the main public health problems all over 
the world and its economic burden is substantial both for health systems and for 
society as a whole.To inform priorities for cancer control, we here estimated 
years of potential life lost (YPLL) and productivity losses due to 
cancer-related premature mortality in Iran from 2006 to 2010.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The number of cancer deaths by sex and age groups for top 
ten leading cancers in Iran were obtained from the Ministry of Health and 
Medical Education. To estimate theYPLL and the cost of productivity loss due to 
cancer-related premature mortality, the life expectancy method and the human 
capital approach were used, respectively.
RESULTS: There were 138,228 cancer-related deaths in Iran (without Tehran 
province) of which 76 % (106,954) were attributable to the top 10 ranked 
cancers. Some 63 % of total cancer-related deaths were of males. The top 10 
ranked cancers resulted in 106,766,942 YPLL in total, 64,171,529 (60 %) in males 
and 42,595,412 (40%) in females. The estimated YPPLL due to top 10 ranked 
cancers was 58,581,737 during the period studied of which 32,214,524 (54%) was 
accounted for in males.The total cost of lost productivity caused by premature 
deaths because of top 10 cancers was 1.68 billion dollars (US$) from 2006 to 
2010, ranging from 251 million dollars in 2006 to 283 million dollars in 2010.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the economic burden of premature mortality 
attributable to cancer is significant for Iranian society. The findings provide 
useful information about the economic impact of cancer for health system policy/ 
decision makers and should facilitate planning of preventive intervention and 
effective resource allocation.

(BODE), Department of Public Health, University of Otago, Wellington, New 
Zealand.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to improve on previous modelling work to determine 
the health gain, cost-utility and health equity impacts from home safety 
assessment and modification (HSAM) for reducing injurious falls in older people.
METHODS: The model was a Markov macrosimulation one that estimated 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. The setting was a country with 
detailed epidemiological and cost data (New Zealand (NZ)) for 2011. A health 
system perspective was taken and a discount rate of 3% was used (for both health 
gain and costs). Intervention effectiveness estimates came from a Cochrane 
systematic review and NZ-specific intervention costs were from a randomised 
controlled trial.
RESULTS: In the 65 years and above age group, the HSAM programme cost a total of 
US$98 million (95% uncertainty interval (UI) US$65 to US$139 million) to 
implement nationally and the accrued net health system costs were US$74 million 
(95% UI: cost saving to US$132 million). Health gains were 34 000 QALYs (95% UI: 
5000 to 65 000). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was US$6000 
(95% UI: cost saving to US$13 000), suggesting that HSAM is highly 
cost-effective. Targeting HSAM only to older people with previous injurious 
falls and to older people aged 75 years and above were also cost-effective 
(ICERs=US$1000 and US$11 000, respectively). There was no evidence for 
differential cost-effectiveness by gender or by ethnicity (Indigenous New 
Zealanders: Māori vs non-Māori).
CONCLUSIONS: As per other studies, this modelling study indicates that the 
provision of an HSAM intervention produces considerable health gain and is 
highly cost-effective among older people. Targeting this intervention to older 
people with previous injurious falls is a promising initial approach before any 
scale up.

BACKGROUND: Changes of life expectancy over time serve as an interesting public 
health indicator for medical, social and economic developments within 
populations. The aim of this study was to quantify changes of life expectancy 
between 1950 and 2010 and relate these to main causes of death.
METHODS: Pollard's actuarial method of decomposing life expectancy was applied 
to compare the contributions of different age- and disease-groups on life 
expectancy in 5-year intervals.
RESULTS: From the 1960 to 70s on, declines in cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
mortality play an increasing role in improving life expectancy in many developed 
countries. During the past decades gains in life expectancy in these countries 
were mainly observed in age groups ≥65 years. A further consistent pattern was 
that life expectancy increases were stronger in men than in women, although life 
expectancy is still higher in women. In Japan, an accelerated epidemiologic 
transition in causes of death was found, with the highest increases between 1950 
and 1955. Short-term declines and subsequent gains in life expectancy were 
observed in Eastern Europe and the former states of the Union of Soviet 
Socialist Republics (USSR), reflecting the changes of the political system.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes of life years estimated with the decomposing method can be 
directly interpreted and may therefore be useful in public health communication. 
The development within specific countries is highly sensitive to changes in the 
political, social and public health environment.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics 
and radiologic findings in patients with a previous history of malignancy who 
underwent computed tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer.
METHODS: Patients with a previous history of malignancy and a life expectancy of 
at least 5 years who were referred for lung cancer screening between May 2, 
2011, and September 24, 2014, were included. CT scan features assessed included 
nodule size, morphologic features, and number. The Lung-CT Reporting and Data 
System scoring system was retrospectively applied to all studies.
RESULTS: A total of 139 patients were studied (mean age of 66 years and median 
smoking history of 50 pack-years). All had a previous history of cancer, most 
often breast cancer (60 patients [43%]), head or neck cancer (26 patients 
[19%]), and lung cancer (16 patients [12%]). Of these patients, 42 (30%) had a 
positive screening study result. Lung cancer was diagnosed in seven patients 
(5%), and a radiation-induced chest wall sarcoma was diagnosed in one patient 
(1%); 42 patients (30%) had a positive chest CT scan per the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network lung cancer screening nodule follow-up algorithm.
CONCLUSION: The rate of diagnosis of lung cancer in our patient population is 
higher than in several previously published studies. Smokers with a history of 
malignancy may be a group at particularly high risk for the development of 
subsequent lung cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the economic value of carfilzomib (Kyprolis), this study 
developed the Kyprolis Global Economic Model (K-GEM), which examined from a 
United States (US) payer perspective the cost-effectiveness of 
carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (KRd) versus lenalidomide-dexamethasone 
(Rd) in relapsed multiple myeloma (RMM; 1-3 prior therapies) based on results 
from the phase III ASPIRE trial that directly compared these regimens.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model that included three health states of 
progression-free (on or off treatment), post-progression, and death was 
developed. Using ASPIRE data, the effect of treatment regimens as administered 
in the trial was assessed for progression-free survival and overall survival 
(OS). Treatment effects were estimated with parametric regression models 
adjusting for baseline patient characteristics and applied over a lifetime 
horizon. US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (1984-2014) registry data 
were matched to ASPIRE patients to extrapolate OS beyond the trial. Estimated 
survival was adjusted to account for utilities across health states. The K-GEM 
considered the total direct costs (pharmacy/medical) of care for patients 
treated with KRd and Rd.
RESULTS: KRd was estimated to be more effective compared to Rd, providing 1.99 
life year and 1.67 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains over the modeled 
horizon. KRd-treated patients incurred $179,393 in total additional costs. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $107,520 per QALY.
LIMITATIONS: Extrapolated survival functions present the greatest uncertainty in 
the modeled results. Utilities were derived from a combination of sources and 
assumed to reflect how US patients value their health state.
CONCLUSIONS: The K-GEM showed KRd is cost-effective, with an ICER of $107,520 
per QALY gained against Rd for the treatment of patients with RMM (1-3 prior 
therapies) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000. Reimbursement of KRd 
for patients with RMM may represent an efficient allocation of the healthcare 
budget.

Muscle regeneration is an important process for skeletal muscle growth and 
recovery. Repair of muscle damage is exquisitely programmed by cellular 
mechanisms inherent in myogenic stem cells, also known as muscle satellite 
cells. We demonstrated previously the involvement of homeobox transcription 
factors, SIX1, SIX4 and SIX5, in the coordinated proliferation and 
differentiation of isolated satellite cells in vitro. However, their roles in 
adult muscle regeneration in vivo remain elusive. To investigate SIX4 and SIX5 
functions during muscle regeneration, we introduced knockout alleles of Six4 and 
Six5 into an animal model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), mdx (Dmd(mdx) 
/Y) mice, characterized by frequent degeneration-regeneration cycles in muscles. 
A lower number of small myofibers, higher number of thick ones and lower serum 
creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities were noted in 50-week-old 
Six4(+/-) 5(+/-) Dmd(mdx) /Y mice than Dmd(mdx) /Y mice, indicating improvement 
of dystrophic phenotypes of Dmd(mdx) /Y mice. Higher proportions of cells 
positive for MYOD1 and MYOG (markers of regenerating myonuclei) and SIX1 (a 
marker of regenerating myoblasts and newly regenerated myofibers) in 12-week-old 
Six4(+/-) 5(+/-) Dmd(mdx) /Y mice suggested enhanced regeneration, compared with 
Dmd(mdx) /Y mice. Although grip strength was comparable in Six4(+/-) 5(+/-) 
Dmd(mdx) /Y and Dmd(mdx) /Y mice, treadmill exercise did not induce muscle 
weakness in Six4(+/-) 5(+/-) Dmd(mdx) /Y mice, suggesting higher regeneration 
capacity. In addition, Six4(+/-) 5(+/-) Dmd(mdx) /Y mice showed 33.8% extension 
of life span. The results indicated that low Six4 and Six5 gene dosage improved 
dystrophic phenotypes of Dmd(mdx) /Y mice by enhancing muscle regeneration, and 
suggested that SIX4 and SIX5 are potentially useful de novo targets in 
therapeutic applications against muscle disorders, including DMD.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer kills more people than any other cancer in the UK 
(5-year survival < 13%). Early diagnosis can save lives. The USA-based National 
Lung Cancer Screening Trial reported a 20% relative reduction in lung cancer 
mortality and 6.7% all-cause mortality in low-dose computed tomography 
(LDCT)-screened subjects.
OBJECTIVES: To (1) analyse LDCT lung cancer screening in a high-risk UK 
population, determine optimum recruitment, screening, reading and care pathway 
strategies; and (2) assess the psychological consequences and the 
health-economic implications of screening.
DESIGN: A pilot randomised controlled trial comparing intervention with usual 
care. A population-based risk questionnaire identified individuals who were at 
high risk of developing lung cancer (≥ 5% over 5 years).
SETTING: Thoracic centres with expertise in lung cancer imaging, respiratory
