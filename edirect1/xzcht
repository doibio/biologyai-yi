INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have shown the safety and efficacy of curative 
resection of esophageal cancer with multiple primary cancers. However, our 
literature search revealed no curative surgery cases for esophageal cancer in 
patients with multiple primary cancers with distant metastasis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old woman visited our hospital with dysphagia. She 
had a history of breast cancer with multiple bone metastasis. 
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a circumferential mass in the upper 
intrathoracic esophagus. Histopathological examination of the biopsy showed 
squamous cell carcinoma. Other imaging findings revealed multiple nodules in the 
liver. The nodules were thought to have originated from the breast, but 
metastasis of esophageal cancer was considered a possibility. Intraoperative 
frozen sections of the liver and peritoneal nodules showed adenocarcinoma. 
Thoracoscopic esophagectomy was then performed. Following surgery, the patient 
received fulvestrant therapy, followed by capecitabine therapy, and the liver 
tumors decreased in size. She is currently alive after 1.5 years of the surgery 
without local recurrence of esophageal cancer.
DISCUSSION: Although the patient had metastatic breast cancer, her relapse-free 
interval of 20 years and good response to hormone therapy for 15 years were 
favorable prognostic factors. Her life expectancy was estimated to be a few 
years and surgery was performed.
CONCLUSION: Curative resection could be considered for patients with esophageal 
cancer who have an additional cancer with distant metastasis when the prognosis 
of the additional cancer is not poor.

PURPOSE: Age-related slowing of gait speed predicts many clinical conditions in 
later life. We examined the kinematic and kinetic mechanisms of how lower 
extremity power training increases healthy old adults' gait speed.
METHODS: We randomly allocated old adults to a training (age 74.3 y, 9 males, 6 
females) and a control group (age 73.6 y, 3 males, 4 females) and compared the 
biomechanics of habitual and fast gait before and after 16 sessions (8 weeks) of 
lower extremity power training.
RESULTS: Training increased maximal leg press load by ∼40% (P < 0.05) and 
maximal voluntary force in five groups of leg muscles by ∼32% (P < 0.05) in the 
training group. Training vs. control tended to increase habitual (10.8 vs. 7.6%) 
and fast gait speed (17.6 vs. 9.0%; all P < 0.05) more. In the training group 
only, these increases in gait speed correlated with increases in stride length 
(habitual: r2 = 0.84, fast: r2 = 0.89). Training made old adults' gait more 
erect: hip and knee extension increased in the stance phase of gait. Training 
increased ankle joint positive work by 3.3 J (control: -0.4 J, Group by Time 
interaction: P < 0.05), which correlated r2 = 0.58 and r2 = 0.67 with increases 
in habitual and fast gait speed without changes in hip and knee joint powers.
CONCLUSION: Increases in leg muscle power increased healthy old adults' gait 
speed through correlated increases in stride length and ankle plantarflexor work 
generation.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness (cost-utility) of introducing 
general practitioner screening for anxiety and depression in patients consulting 
for osteoarthritis (OA).
METHODS: A cluster-randomized trial-based economic evaluation to assess general 
practitioners screening for anxiety and depression symptoms in patients 
consulting for OA compared to usual care (screening for pain intensity) was 
undertaken over a 12-month period from a UK National Health Service and societal 
perspective. Patient-level mean costs and mean quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) were estimated, and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves controlling 
for cluster-level data were constructed. The base-case analysis used the net 
benefit regressions approach. The 2-stage nonparametric sampling technique was 
explored in a sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis demonstrated that the intervention was as costly 
as, and less effective than, the control (QALY differential -0.029 [95% 
confidence interval -0.062, 0.003]). In the base-case analyses, general 
practitioner screening for anxiety and depression was unlikely to be a 
cost-effective option (probability <5% at £20,000/QALY). Similar results were 
observed in all sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Prompting general practitioners to routinely screen and manage 
comorbid anxiety and depression in patients presenting with OA is unlikely to be 
cost-effective. Further research is needed to explore clinically effective and 
cost-effective models of managing anxiety and depression in patients presenting 
with clinical OA.

When in the lampbrush configuration, chromosomes display thousands of visible 
DNA loops that are transcribed at exceptionally high rates by RNA polymerase II 
(pol II). These transcription loops provide unique opportunities to investigate 
not only the detailed architecture of pol II transcription sites but also the 
structural dynamics of chromosome looping, which is receiving fresh attention as 
the organizational principle underpinning the higher-order structure of all 
chromosome states. The approach described here allows for extended imaging of 
individual transcription loops and transcription units under conditions in which 
loop RNA synthesis continues. In intact nuclei from lampbrush-stage Xenopus 
oocytes isolated under mineral oil, highly specific targeting of fluorescent 
fusions of the RNA-binding protein CELF1 to nascent transcripts allowed 
functional transcription loops to be observed and their longevity assessed over 
time. Some individual loops remained extended and essentially static structures 
over time courses of up to an hour. However, others were less stable and shrank 
markedly over periods of 30-60 min in a manner that suggested that loop 
extension requires continued dense coverage with nascent transcripts. In stable 
loops and loop-derived structures, the molecular dynamics of the visible nascent 
RNP component were addressed using photokinetic approaches. The results 
suggested that CELF1 exchanges freely between the accumulated nascent RNP and 
the surrounding nucleoplasm, and that it exits RNP with similar kinetics to its 
entrance. Overall, it appears that on transcription loops, nascent transcripts 
contribute to a dynamic self-organizing structure that exemplifies a 
phase-separated nuclear compartment.

PURPOSE: Prognostic factors for survival ≥ 15 years and life years lost after 
liver transplantation are largely unknown.
METHODS: One thousand six hundred thirty primary adult liver transplants between 
1983 and 2014 were analyzed. Risk factors for survival were identified with 
multivariable Cox regression and subsequently tested for their relevance as 
prognostic factors for observed 15-year survival using multivariable logistic 
regression and c statistics. The difference of life expectancy between a matched 
national reference population and survival in patients with post-transplant 
survival ≥ 15 years was calculated.
RESULTS: Survival of ≥ 15 years was observed in 361 patients (22%). Sixty-nine 
adults died after more than 15 years losing a median of 15 years of life 
expectancy. One of those patients lived longer while 292 patients still have the 
chance to survive longer than their normal life expectancy. The indication 
primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and later eras of transplantation were 
identified as significant independent protective factors while recipient age 
> 36.8 years, graft loss due to initial non-function or thrombosis, the 
indications hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hepatitis-C-virus-related cirrhosis 
(HCV-cirrhosis) and all other indications, donor age > 53 years, the number of 
surgical complications, and operative durations > 4.5 h were identified as 
significant independent risk factors limiting survival. All of these factors 
except the duration of operation had also a significant independent influence on 
observed 15-year survival (AUROC = 0.739).
CONCLUSIONS: Recipients can exceptionally live longer than their normal life 
expectancy. Older recipients and patients with the indications HCC, 
HCV-cirrhosis, or other indications except PSC, should be transplanted with 
younger donor organs.

OBJECTIVE: Advanced cancer patients' prognostic understanding is associated with 
completion of Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders, which often represent engagement 
in advance care planning (ACP). Given caregivers' critical roles in patient 
decision-making about ACP and end-of-life care, caregivers' prognostic 
understanding may have a large additive effect. The present study examined the 
association between the main and interactive effects of advanced cancer patient 
and caregiver prognostic understanding on DNR order completion.
METHODS: Data were analyzed from a combined dataset of 2 sequential 
multi-institutional, longitudinal cohort studies of patients with advanced 
cancer and their informal caregivers (n = 279 dyads) from 2002 to 2008 (Coping 
with Cancer 1) and 2010 to 2015 (Coping with Cancer 2). Patients' and 
caregivers' prognostic understanding regarding life-expectancy (≤ 12 months 
[prognostic understanding], >12 months [lack of prognostic understanding]) was 
assessed. DNR order completion was assessed through self-report and confirmed 
through cross-checking with medical records.
RESULTS: Multivariable modeling of the main and interactive effects revealed the 
interactive effect, but not the individual effects, of patients' and caregivers' 
prognostic understanding was significantly associated with higher odds of 
patients' DNR order completion, adjusting for potential confounds (AOR = 5.89, 
P = 0.04). For dyads in which both the patient and caregiver had prognostic 
understanding regarding life expectancy of ≤12 months, 70.7% of patients had 
completed DNR orders compared with 31.6% to 38.9% in which 1 or both lacked 
prognostic understanding.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the need for ensuring accurate patient and 
caregiver prognostic understanding in increasing DNR order completion, which may 
provide a framework for improving engagement in ACP more broadly.

MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN THE OLD PATIENT: Even old patients may crucially 
benefit from reopening the occluded coronary artery by percutaneous coronary 
intervention with stent implantation. Bleeding complications can be reduced by 
choosing the radial instead of the femoral vascular approach for cardiac 
catheterization.
STATINS FOR THE ELDERLY: WHEN TO START UND WHEN TO STOP?: Elderly benefit no 
less than the younger from statins. "Goal-oriented statin therapy" is preferable 
to the "statin strategy of fixed dose". In a patient with life expectancy of 
less than three years, statin therapy is dispensable. MALNUTRITION IN THE OLD 
AGE - SERIOUSLY UNDERVALUED AND UNDERTREATED: Cachexia, sarcopenia and 
deficiencies in micronutrients can effectively be met by an individualized 
nutrition therapy.
TAVI APT FOR PATIENTS WITH INTERMEDIATE SURGICAL RISK, AS WELL: The SURTAVI 
trial showed TAVI to be a noninferior alternative to surgery in patients with 
severe aortic stenosis at intermediate surgical risk.
POST-TAVI-ENDOCARDITIS: A NOVEL SYNDROME OF THE AGED PATIENT: Diabetes mellitus 
and preexisting aortic insufficiency increase the risk. Enterococci and S. 
aureus trigger every other post-TAVI-endocarditis.

von der Wiedereröffnung des verschlossenen Herzkranzgefäßes mit

BEIM äLTEREN MENSCHEN: WANN INDIZIERT UND WANN NICHT MEHR INDIZIERT?:  Ältere 
profitieren nicht weniger als Jüngere von einer Statintherapie. Die

Sickle cell disease: Classification of clinical complications and approaches to 
preventive and therapeutic management.

Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin structure that 
has no established cure in adult patients. Cure has been achieved in selected 
children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) using allogeneic bone marrow 
transplantation or cord blood transplantation. SCD is essentially a triumvirate 
of (1) pain syndromes, (2) anemia and its sequelae and (3) organ failure, 
including infection. Pain, however, is the hallmark of SCD and dominates its 
clinical picture throughout the life of the patients. The prevalence of these 
complications varies with age from infancy through adult life. However, pain, 
infections and anemia requiring blood transfusion occur throughout the life span 
of affected patients. The overall medical care of patients with SCD in developed 
countries has improved such that their life expectancy has almost doubled since 
1951. Currently, there are at least five major approaches for the general 
management of SCD and its complications. These include (i) symptomatic 
management, (ii) supportive management, (iii) preventive management, (iv) 
abortive management, and (v) curative therapy.

Genetic modifiers of severity in sickle cell disease.

Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common single disease disorders 
world-wide. It is remarkable for its clinical heterogeneity, even among 
individuals with identical genotypes. Some individuals experience morbidity and 
mortality in early childhood, while others have a relatively mild course, and 
normal or near normal life expectancy. Many clinical complications are 
associated with SCD; most notably frequent pain episodes, stroke, acute chest 
syndrome, avascular necrosis, nephropathy, retinopathy and pulmonary 
hypertension. While the effects of higher fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels, UGTA1A 
polymorphisms, alpha-thalassemia and G6PD deficiency on SCD has been extensively 
studied, these variables do not explain all of the clinical heterogeneity of 
SCD. It is not known why some patients develop certain complications, and it is 
difficult to predict which complications a particular patient will experience. 
Much work has been done to identify genetic variants associated with these 
disease complications; many associations remain unvalidated. As the field 
continues to move beyond small sample collections and candidate gene approaches 
into whole genome sequencing and merging of samples from all over the world, we 
will identify more genetic variants associated with development of specific SCD 
related complications, and hopefully leverage this knowledge into targeted 
therapies.

BACKGROUND: Biomarkers of biological aging - DNA methylation age (DNAm age) and 
leukocyte telomere length (LTL)- correlate strongly with chronological age 
across the life course. It is, however, unclear how these measures of cellular 
wear and tear are associated with muscle strength and functional capacity, which 
are known to decline with older age and are associated with mortality. We 
investigated if DNAm age and LTL were associated with body composition and 
physical functioning by examining 48 monozygotic twin sisters.
METHODS: White blood cell DNAm age (predicted years) was calculated from 
Illumina 450 k BeadChip methylation data using an online calculator. DNAm age 
acceleration was defined from the residuals derived from a linear regression 
model of DNAm age on chronological age. LTL was measured by qPCR. Total body 
percentage of fat and lean mass were estimated using bioimpedance. Physical 
functioning was measured by grip strength, knee extension strength and by 10 m 
maximal walking speed test.
RESULTS: In all participants, DNAm age (58.4 ± 6.6) was lower than chronological 
age (61.3 ± 5.9 years). Pairwise correlations of monozygotic co-twins were high 
for DNAm age (0.88, 95% CI 0.79, 0.97), age acceleration (0.68, 95% CI 0.30, 
0.85) and LTL (0.77, 95% CI 0.60, 0.94). Increased age acceleration i.e. faster 
epigenetic aging compared to chronological age was associated with lower grip 
strength (β = - 5.3 SE 1.9 p = 0.011), but not with other measures of physical 
functioning or body composition. LTL was not associated with body composition or 
physical functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, accelerated DNAm age is associated with lower grip 
strength, a biomarker known to be associated with physiological aging, and which 
predicts decline in physical functioning and mortality. Further studies may 
clarify whether epigenetic aging explains the decline in muscle strength with 
aging or whether DNAm age just illustrates the progress of aging.

BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and abdominal pain are commonly seen in 
a pediatric emergency department (8 and 18% incidence respectively in our 
center). They are manifestations of a wide variety of diseases ranging from 
benign to immediately life-threatening. Trichobezoar is an under-diagnosed 
entity that has to be considered in children and adolescents, expecially female, 
suffering from trichotillomania (compulsion to pull hair) and trichophagy 
(compulsion to swallow hair). When undiagnosed, gastric bezoars may cause 
gastric ulceration, perforation, haemorrhage and obstruction.
CASE PRESENTATION: To underline the importance of including this pathology in 
the differential diagnosis of IDA and abdominal pain, we present the case of a 
14 year-old girl with a huge trichobezoar which completely filled the stomach 
and extended into the small bowel. Since trichobezoar has an extension to the 
small bowel, it is classified as Rapunzel syndrome. As the bezoar couldn't be 
removed by endoscopy, the girl underwent surgical intervention. The patient 
passed through a gradual re-feeding, with iron and vitamins supplementation, and 
through a psychiatric counselling.
CONCLUSION: The Rapunzel syndrome is a rare entity that may be complicated by 
life-threatening events. A prompt diagnosis and an appropriate therapy can 
reduce comorbidities. Gradual re-feeding with supplementation of micronutrients 
allows adequate catch-up weight with normalization of haematochemical 
nutritional parameters. Since many of these patients suffer from psychiatric 
pathology such as PICA with emotional problems and mental retardation, 
psychological/psychiatric counselling plays an important role in order to 
prevent bezoar recurrence.

    BMC Psychiatry. 2019 Oct 28;19(1):321.

BACKGROUND: Rates of psychiatric conditions common to end-stage cancer patients 
(delirium, depression, anxiety disorders) remain unchanged. However, patient 
numbers have increased as the population has aged; indeed, cancer is a chief 
cause of mortality and morbidity in older populations. Effectiveness of 
psychiatric interventions and research to evaluate, inform, and improve 
interventions is critical to these patients' care. This article's intent is to 
report results from a recent review study on the effectiveness of interventions 
for psychiatric conditions common to end-stage cancer patients; the review study 
assessed the state of research regarding treatment effectiveness. Unlike 
previous review studies, this one included non-traditional/alternative therapies 
and spirituality interventions that have undergone scientific inquiry.
METHODS: A five-phase systematic strategy and a theoretic grounded iterative 
methodology were used to identify studies for inclusion and to craft an 
integrated, synthesized, comprehensive, and reasonably current end-product.
RESULTS: Psychiatric medication therapies undoubtedly are the most powerful 
treatments. Among them, the most effective (i.e., "best practices benchmarks") 
are: (1) for delirium, typical antipsychotics-though there is no difference 
between typical vs. atypical and other antipsychotics, except for different 
side-effect profiles, (2) for depression, if patient life expectancy is 
≥4-6 weeks, then a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and if 
< 3 weeks, then psychostimulants or ketamine, and these generally are useful 
anytime in the cancer disease course, and (3) for anxiety disorders, 
bio-diazepams (BDZs) are most used and most effective. A universal consensus 
suggests that psychosocial (i.e., talk) therapy and spirituality interventions 
fortify the therapeutic alliance and psychiatric medication protocols. However, 
trial studies have had mixed results regarding effectiveness in reducing 
psychiatric symptoms, even for touted psychotherapies.
CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings prompted a testable linear conceptual model 
of co-factors and their importance for providing effective psychiatric care for 
end-stage cancer patients. The complicated and tricky part is negotiating 
patients' diagnoses while articulating internal intricacies within and between 
each of the model's co-factors. There is a relative absence of scientifically 
derived information and need for more large-scale, diverse scientific inquiry. 
Thus, this article is an impassioned plea for accelerated study and better care 
for end-stage cancer patients' psychiatric conditions.

BACKGROUND: We studied anteromedial varus angulation (VA) in the proximal third 
of the ulna. The importance of restoration of the anatomical orientation of the 
ulnar after a proximal fracture is unclear. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate the impact of minimal proximal ulna malunion on elbow function after a 
proximal ulna fracture.
METHODS: We reviewed the follow-up of 60 patients who had undergone open 
reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) of a proximal fracture of the ulna. 
Patients were divided into two groups, defined as either more or less than 5° of 
the difference between the VA of the fractured and contralateral ulna. The range 
of motion(ROM)of elbow flexion, extension and forearm rotation on both sides, 
Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were 
measured.
RESULTS: The average postoperative time was 3.1 years (1-5 years). Mean VA of 
the fractured arm was different from the normal side (7.8 ± 3.0 vs 12.7 ± 3.0). 
Compared to the unfractured arm there was a loss in mean elbow flexion 
(14.2 ± 4.9 vs 18.0 ± 5.9), extension ROM (7.1 ± 2.5 vs 9.3 ± 1.9, p < 0.05) and 
forearm rotation ROM (15.6 ± 8.6 vs 21.8 ± 9.5) that were statistically 
significant (p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in 
the MEPS and VAS score results between the two groups (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The function of the elbow and forearm was restricted after VA 
malunion in the proximal ulna, but the quality of life of these patients had not 
been significantly affected. We suggest that orthopedic surgeons should assess 
whether the specialized structures of the proximal ulna are damaged or not 
before surgery. If the anatomy of the fractured bone cannot be restored through 
manipulation of the connected end directly, it is better to image the anatomical 
structure of the healthy side from using an elbow X-ray before surgery, and then 
reset using a pre-shaped plate to prevent malunion.

Longer life expectancy and decreasing fertility rates mean that the proportion 
of older people is continually increasing worldwide, and particularly in Europe. 
Ageing is associated with an increase in the risk and severity of infectious 
diseases. These diseases are also more difficult to diagnose and manage in 
seniors who often have at least one comorbid condition (60% of seniors have two 
or more conditions). Infectious diseases increase the risk of hospitalization, 
loss of autonomy and death in seniors. Effective vaccines are available in 
Europe for infectious diseases such as influenza, pneumococcal diseases, herpes 
zoster, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. Their effectiveness has been 
demonstrated in terms of reducing the rates of hospitalization, disability, 
dependency and death. The prevention of diseases in seniors also results in 
savings in healthcare and societal costs each year in Europe. Despite the 
availability of vaccines, vaccine-preventable diseases affect millions of 
European citizens annually, with the greatest burden of disease occurring in 
seniors, and the medical and economic benefits associated with are not being 
achieved. Vaccination coverage rates must be improved to achieve the full 
benefits of vaccination of seniors in Europe.

Ebolaviruses comprises 5 species that exert varying degrees of 
mortality/infectivity in humans with Reston ebolaviruses (REBOV) showing the 
lowest and Zaire ebolaviruses (ZEBOV) showing the highest. However, the 
molecular basis of this differential mortality/infectivity remains unclear. 
Here, we report that the structural features of ebolavirus envelope 
glycoproteins (GPs) and one of their counter receptors, macrophage 
galactose-type calcium-type lectin (MGL/CD301), play crucial roles in 
determining viral infectivity. The low infectivity of REBOV mediated by the 
interaction between GPs and MGL/CD301 dramatically increased when the N-terminal 
18 amino acids (33rd through 50th) of GPs were replaced with that of ZEBOV. 
Furthermore, structural analysis of glycans of GPs revealed that N-glycans were 
more extended in REBOV than in ZEBOV. N-glycan extension was reversed by the 
replacement of aforementioned N-terminal 18 amino acid residues. Therefore, 
these data strongly suggest that extended N-glycans on GPs reduce 
MGL/CD301-mediated viral infectivity by hindering the interaction between GPs 
and MGL/CD301 preferentially binds O-glycans.

Culture and the Trajectories of Developmental Pathology: Insights from Control 
and Information Theories.

Cognition in living entities-and their social groupings or institutional 
artifacts-is necessarily as complicated as their embedding environments, which, 
for humans, includes a particularly rich cultural milieu. The asymptotic limit 
theorems of information and control theories permit construction of a new class 
of empirical 'regression-like' statistical models for cognitive developmental 
processes, their dynamics, and modes of dysfunction. Such models may, as have 
their simpler analogs, prove useful in the study and re-mediation of cognitive 
failure at and across the scales and levels of organization that constitute and 
drive the phenomena of life. These new models particularly focus on the roles of 
sociocultural environment and stress, in a large sense, as both trigger for the 
failure of the regulation of bio-cognition and as 'riverbanks' determining the 
channels of pathology, with implications across life-course developmental 
trajectories. We examine the effects of an embedding cultural milieu and its 
socioeconomic implementations using the 'lenses' of metabolic optimization, 
control system theory, and an extension of symmetry-breaking appropriate to 
information systems. A central implication is that most, if not all, human 
developmental disorders are fundamentally culture-bound syndromes. This has deep 
implications for both individual treatment and public health policy.

PURPOSE: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) measure health by combining length 
and quality of life. QALYs constitute the effect side of incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios, describing the results of health economic 
evaluations. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate the prevalence 
of states worse than dead (SWD) when using the EuroQol-5D UK value set, and (2) 
to study to what extent SWDs are reasonable with a starting point in 
experience-based valuations of health states.
METHODS: Data from a Swedish cross-sectional population survey were used. The 
survey was directed to 10,000 persons 65 years and older and its primary aim was 
to investigate the prevalence and consequences of chronic pain. The survey 
included questions reflecting life situation and well-being. Some of these were 
used in order to characterise people in SWD.
RESULTS: SWD were found in 1.8% of the 6611 respondents. The prevalence of SWD 
increased with advancing age and was more common among women than men. The 
control questions used indicated that most of the persons being in SWD according 
to the EQ-5D UK value set most probably would not judge themselves to be in a 
SWD.
CONCLUSIONS: Though negative QALY-weights are not very common, they constitute a 
non-negligible part of health states in a Swedish population 65 years and older. 
Prevalence of SWD is higher among women than men and increases with age. From 
responses to other questions on well-being and life situation, there is reason 
to doubt the reasonableness of experience-based negative QALY-weights in many 
cases.

CONTEXT: Evidence suggests an association between rurality and decreased life

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether rural hospitals have higher hospital mortality,
