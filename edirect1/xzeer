associated with a higher all-cause mortality risk. Considering the high 
prevalence of limb muscle weakness among older adults in China, especially in 
those aged ≥80 years, limb strength could be considered as an easy-to-perform 
potential mortality predictor in community health care.

INTRODUCTION: Appropriate treatment for people with an increased risk for 
developing chronic Persistent Somatic Symptoms (PSS) is of great importance at 
an early stage to improve quality of life and prevent high costs for society.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an integrated blended care 
intervention compared to usual care for QALYs, subjective symptom impact and 
physical and mental health status in patients with moderate PSS.
METHODS: This economic evaluation was conducted alongside a 12-month 
prospective, multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial in Dutch primary 
care. 80 participants received the intervention and 80 participants received 
usual care. Seemingly unrelated regression analyzes were performed to estimate 
cost and effect differences. Missing data were imputed using multiple 
imputation. Bootstrapping techniques were used to estimate uncertainty.
RESULTS: We found no significant difference in total societal costs. 
Intervention, primary and secondary healthcare and absenteeism costs were higher 
for the intervention group. The ICER for QALYs demonstrated the intervention was 
on average less costly and less effective compared to usual care. For the 
subjective symptom impact and physical health, the ICER indicated that the 
intervention group was on average less costly and more effective. For mental 
health, the intervention was on average more costly and less effective.
CONCLUSION: We didn't find an integrated blended primary care intervention to be 
cost-effective compared to usual care. However, when looking on relevant, but 
specific outcome measures (subjective symptom impact and physical health) for 
this population, average costs are found to be lower and the effectiveness found 
to be higher.

BACKGROUND: Regimens for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis 
(MDR-TB) have been changed from injectable-containing regimens to all-oral 
regimens. The economic effectiveness of new all-oral regimens compared with 
conventional injectable-containing regimens was scarcely evaluated. This study 
was conducted to compare the cost-effectiveness between all-oral longer-course 
regimens (the oral regimen group) and conventional injectable-containing 
regimens (the control group) to treat newly diagnosed MDR-TB patients.
METHODS: A health economic analysis over lifetime horizon (20 years) from the 
perspective of the healthcare system in Korea was conducted. We developed a 
combined simulation model of a decision tree model (initial two years) and two 
Markov models (remaining 18 years, six-month cycle length) to calculate the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between the two groups. The 
transition probabilities and cost in each cycle were assumed based on the 
published data and the analysis of health big data that combined country-level 
claims data and TB registry in 2013-2018.
RESULTS: The oral regimen group was assumed to spend 20,778 USD more and lived 
1.093 years or 1.056 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) longer than the control 
group. The ICER of the base case was calculated to be 19,007 USD/life year 
gained and 19,674 USD/QALY. The results of sensitivity analyses showed that base 
case results were very robust and stable, and the oral regimen was 
cost-effective with a 100% probability for a willingness to pay more than 21,250 
USD/QALY.
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that the new all-oral longer regimens for the 
treatment of MDR-TB were cost-effective in replacing conventional 
injectable-containing regimens.

AIMS: To understanding the net regional, national, and economic effect of global 
population ageing on diabetes and its trends during 1990 and 2019 worldwide.
METHODS: We employed a decomposition method to estimate the impact of population 
ageing on diabetes-related disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and total 
deaths in 204 countries from 1990 to 2019 at the global, regional, and national 
level. This method separated the net effect of population ageing from population 
growth and changes in mortality.
RESULTS: Globally, population ageing has become the major contributor to 
diabetes-related deaths since 2013. The increases in diabetes-related deaths 
attributed to population ageing exceeding the decreases in mortality change. 
Population ageing produced an additional 0.42 million diabetes-related deaths 
and 14.95 million DALYs from 1990 to 2019. At the regional level, population 
ageing is associated with the increases in diabetes-related deaths in 18 out of 
22 regions. The highest increase in diabetes-related deaths attributed to 
population ageing occurred in men in East Asia (136.31%) and women in Central 
Latin America (118.58%). The proportion of diabetes-related deaths and DALYs 
attributable to population ageing showed a bell-shaped relationship with 
sociodemographic index (SDI) and peaked at high-middle-SDI countries.
CONCLUSIONS: The decreases in diabetes-related deaths attributed to mortality 
change exceeded the increases attributed to population ageing between 1990 and 
2019 globally and regionally. The diabetes-related deaths in high-middle-SDI 
countries were most impacted by population ageing.

Studies have identified that mating induces a series of physiological changes in 
animals. In this period, males tending to invest more energy, immune peptides, 
and other substances to reduce the cost of living for females. This results in 
lower survival rates in later life than females. Meanwhile, both males and 
females shorten lifespans due to reproduction. However, the reasons why 
termites' queens and kings are both extremely long-lived and highly fecund are 
unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of mating on the 
expression of immune and DNA repair genes for lifespan extension in termite 
queens and kings. Here, we reported that mated queens show relatively higher 
expression of immune genes (phenoloxidase, denfensin, termicin, transferrin), 
antioxidant genes (CAT, SOD), detoxification genes (GST, CYP450) than virgin 
queens in the Reticulitermes chinensis. In addition, mated kings also highly 
expressed these genes, except for termicin, transferrin, GST, and CYP450. After 
mating, both queens and kings significantly upregulated the expression of DNA 
repair genes (MLH1, BRCA1, XRCC3, RAD54-like). Mismatch repair genes (MMR) MSH2, 
MSH4, MSH6 were considerably increased in mated queens, while MSH4, MSH5, MSH6 
were upregulated in mated kings. Our results suggest that mating increases the 
expression of immune and DNA repair genes in the termite queens and kings, and 
thus possibly improving their survival during reproductive span due to the 
omnipresent pathogens.

BACKGROUND: Darolutamide and enzalutamide are second-generation androgen 
receptor inhibitors with activity in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer 
(CRPC) and different toxicity profiles.
OBJECTIVE: ODENZA is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, cross-over, phase 2 
trial designed to assess preference between darolutamide and enzalutamide in men 
with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC (mCRPC).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 
either darolutamide 1200 mg/d for 12 wk followed by enzalutamide 160 mg/d for 12 
wk or enzalutamide followed by darolutamide. In both arms, the second treatment 
was given in absence of cancer progression.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was patient 
preference between the two drugs, as assessed by a preference questionnaire (p 
value calculated with the Prescott test). After week 24, patients entered an 
extension period during which they received their preferred treatment until 
progression or toxicity. The main secondary objectives included reasons for 
patient preference, response at week 12, tolerance of each drug, and measurement 
compared with baseline of cognitive outcomes assessed using tablet 
questionnaires.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 249 patients, with a median age of 72 yr, were 
randomized. Among the 200 patients who fulfilled the preplanned criteria for the 
evaluation of the primary endpoint of preference, 97 (49% [41; 56]), 80 (40% 
[33; 47]), and 23 (12% [7; 16]) chose darolutamide, chose enzalutamide, and had 
no preference, respectively (p = 0.92). Reduced fatigue, easier administration, 
and better quality of life were the main criteria that influenced patient 
choice. A moderate benefit in episodic memory from darolutamide was observed for 
the acquisition of new information (least square [LS] means difference = 2.2, 
effect size = 0.5) and for the recall of that information after a brief delay 
(LS means difference = 0.7, effect size = 0.3). Using the Brief Fatigue 
Inventory questionnaire, patients reported greater fatigue with enzalutamide 
(3.3 [3.0; 3.6]) than with darolutamide (2.7 [2.4; 3.0]). There was no 
difference in terms of depression, seizures, and falls.
CONCLUSIONS: The study did not show a difference in preference between the two 
treatments. In men with mCRPC, darolutamide was associated with a clinically 
meaningful benefit in episodic memory and less fatigue compared with 
enzalutamide.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Preference between darolutamide and enzalutamide was well 
balanced in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Darolutamide was 
associated with a significant benefit in verbal learning and less fatigue 
compared with enzalutamide.

India has remarkably achieved some level of decline in infant mortality rate and 
increase in aged person through increase in life expectancy due to improvement 
on its health care sector but still remain amongst the countries with the 
highest rate of infant mortality within the Asian countries. Literature on 
environmental implication remains scarce, and for this we utilised India's data 
from 1975 to 2020 to research on this topic. Relevant scientific methods 
(residual Augmented Least Squares - RALS, Engle and Granger - EG, and its newly 
augmented version - RALS-EG) are adopted in this study. Further, to estimate the 
long-run elasticities of the regressors, the symmetric analyses, i.e., dynamic 
ordinary least squares (DOLS) and Engle and Granger causality test techniques, 
are employed. Findings according to DOLS revealed that renewable energy sources 
and social (GDP per capita) and public subsidies (general government final 
consumption expenditure) have lessening effect on infant mortality in India, 
whilst the private subsidies (gross capital formation), fossil fuels, and carbon 
dioxide cause an increase in infant mortality in India. This exposes renewable 
energy source as a mitigating factor in Indian environmental degradation which 
as well lessen the infant mortality level in India; hence, policy is suggested 
to be framed on improving renewable energy and health sectors. The graphical 
presentation of the abstract is done with the diagram below. The graph shows the 
interactions amongst the selected variables in this study. The impacts of the 
explanatory variables on the dependent variable are shown with different colours 
showing positive (green) and negative (red) impacts.

INTRODUCTION: Depression in the elderly constitutes 7.3% of the total Malaysian 
national prevalence of depression. However, depression is commonly 
underdiagnosed by primary care physicians, which may impact coexisting comorbid 
conditions and general well-being. As depression in the elderly increases with 
age, its prevalence is expected to become even more significant due to the 
increased life expectancy and isolation during the pandemic. This study aims to 
determine the perceptions, views and barriers encountered among primary care 
physicians on screening for depression among the elderly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This qualitative study involved five public healthcare 
clinics in the Kuching district with indepth interviews (IDI) conducted on 14 
primary care doctors (PCDs). Semi-structured interviews and in-depth discussions 
were conducted via videoconferencing. One representative was selected from each 
clinic at initiation, followed by snowball method for subsequent subject 
selection until saturation of themes. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and 
analysis based on framework analysis principles via NVivo software. Themes were 
analysed deductively according to study objectives and evidence from literature.
RESULTS: Three main themes emerged from the IDI: (1) The perception of 
depression in elderly patients, (2) The perceived barriers to screening, and (3) 
The screening processes. Majority of the PCDs perceived depression as part of 
ageing process. Time constraints, lack of privacy in consultation rooms, 
dominant caregivers and failure to recognise recurrent somatic symptoms as part 
of depression influenced PCDs decision to screen. Screening was technically 
challenging for PCDs to use the DASS-21, which was not socio-culturally 
validated for local native population. Only 21.4% of respondents (3/14) reported 
screening at least three out 10 elderly patients seen over 1- month period. 
During the covid pandemic, due to the same human resource support and practices, 
most participants thought their screening for depression in elderlies had not 
changed.
CONCLUSION: Awareness of depression among PCDs needs to be re-enforced via 
continuous medical education programs to use appropriate screening tools, 
address infrastructure related barriers to optimise screening practices. The use 
of appropriate locally validated and socio-culturally adapted tool is vital to 
correctly interpret the screening test for patients.

Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide and a major 
impediment to increasing life expectancy. However, survival rates with average 
standard cancer treatment strategies have not significantly improved in recent 
decades, with tumor metastasis, adverse drug reactions, and drug resistance 
still posing major challenges. Replacement therapies are essential for treating 
this terrible disease. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the use 
of phytochemical-derived conjugated chemotherapeutic agents due to their 
biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, low resistance, and dynamic physiochemical 
properties that distinguish normal cells in treating various types of cancer. 
The use of plant-based carriers has many advantages, such as the availability of 
raw materials, lower cost, lower toxicity in most cases, and greater 
compatibility with the body's structure compared to chemical and mineral types 
of carriers. Unfortunately, several challenges complicate the efficient 
administration of herbal medicines, including physicochemical disadvantages such 
as poor solubility and instability, and pharmacokinetic challenges such as poor 
absorption and low bioavailability that can cause problems in clinical trials. 
Novel delivery systems such as liposomes, phytosomes, nanoparticles, and 
nanocapsules are more suitable as delivery systems for phytomedicinal components 
compared to conventional systems. The use of these delivery systems can improve 
bioavailability, pharmacological activity, prolonged delivery, and provide 
physical and chemical stability that increases half-life. This article discusses 
different types of phytocompounds used in cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: The present study examined changes in the working hours of Korean 
workers from 2010 to 2020 according to employment status and industrial sector.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data from the third (2010), fourth 
(2014), fifth (2017) and sixth (2020) Korean Working Conditions Surveys, which 
were conducted by the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency.
RESULTS: During the past 10 years, workers classified as employees, 
self-employed, or employers experienced clear declines in average weekly working 
hours and in the percentages of individuals who worked more than 48 hours per 
week. During 2020, the largest proportion of employees (52.8%) had 40-hour work 
weeks, whereas the largest proportions of self-employed individuals (26.8%) and 
employers (25.1%) had very long work weeks (≥ 60 h/week). Also during 2020, 
individuals who were self-employed or employers in the sectors of 'Accommodation 
and food service' had the longest weekly work hours, whereas employees in the 
sector of 'Transportation' had the longest weekly work hours. All three groups 
(employees, self-employed, and employers) in all 21 industrial sectors 
experienced declines in average weekly working hours from 2017 to 2020.
CONCLUSION: From 2010 to 2020, employees, self-employed individuals, and 
employers experienced clear declines in average weekly working hours, and in the 
percentages of individuals with long weekly working hours. However, there were 
also differences in the weekly working hours of those who had different 
employment status and who worked in different industrial sectors. The 
implementation of the 40-hour work-week and the 52-hour maximum work-week in 
Korea reduced excessive work hours by individuals who had different employment 
status and who worked in different industrial sectors, and probably improved 
worker quality-of-life. We recommend extension of these regulations to 
workplaces with fewer than 5 employees.

PURPOSE: Prostate cancer (PC) is the second leading cause of cancer and the 
fifth cause of cancer-related death. This manuscript aims to determine the 
incidence, mortality, and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) trends of PC in 
the last 30 years in Latin America and Mexico.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a publicly available data 
set. Data regarding the burden of prostate cancer in 20 Latin-American 
countries, and the 32 states of Mexico, were retrieved from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2019. Collected information included incidence and mortality rates 
(per 100,000), as well as the DALYs as absolute numbers and rates (per 100,000) 
and the annual rates of change in rates from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: In Latin America in males aged 55 years or older, the mean incidence 
rate was 344 cases per 100,000. The number of deaths attributable to prostate 
cancer observed was 67,110 and the mean mortality rate was 210 per 100,000. The 
overall burden of disease was 1,120,709 DALYs and the contribution of years of 
life lost (YLL) was 91.7% ([Formula: see text] = 1,027,946). Mexico presented an 
incidence rate (279.6) and mortality (99.1) rate (per /100 thousand). In Mexico, 
13 states had a DALYs' rate above the national mean (883 per 100,000) and the 
highest burden (1360 DALYs/100,000) were documented in the state of Guerrero 
(Southwestern Mexico).
CONCLUSION: Only two Latin-American countries (Brazil and Colombia) and eight 
states of Mexico showed a decreased trend about the rate of change of DALYs in 
the last 30 years.

BACKGROUND: Due to a constantly increasing life expectancy and the need to stay 
mobile at a high age, the proportion of over 65-year-olds in traffic accidents 
is increasing from year to year.
METHOD: In order to identify potentials for increasing the safety of seniors in 
road traffic, accident data were analyzed with respect to the categories of road 
users and accident types of this age group. Based on the accident data analysis, 
active and passive safety systems are described that could increase the road 
safety particular for senior citizens.
RESULTS: It was found that older road users are frequently involved in accidents 
as car occupants, cyclists and pedestrians. In addition, car drivers and 
cyclists aged 65 years and older are frequently involved in driving, turning and 
crossing accidents. Lane departure warning and emergency braking assistants have 
a high potential for accident avoidance as they can defuse critical situations 
at the last moment. Restraint systems (airbags, seat belts) adapted to physical 
characteristics could minimize the severity of injuries to older car occupants.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Durch eine stetig steigende 
Lebenserwartung und das Bedürfnis, auch im höheren Alter mobil zu sein, wird der 
Anteil der über 65-Jährigen im Verkehrsunfallgeschehen von Jahr zu Jahr größer.
METHODE: Um Potenziale zur Erhöhung der Sicherheit von Senioren (65 Jahre und 
älter) im Straßenverkehr zu identifizieren, wurden die Unfälle in Deutschland 
hinsichtlich der Verkehrsbeteiligung und der Unfalltypen dieser Altersgruppe 
analysiert. Auf Basis der Unfalldatenanalyse werden aktive und passive 
Sicherheitssysteme vorgestellt, die insbesondere die Verkehrssicherheit von 
Senioren erhöhen könnten.
ERGEBNISSE: Es zeigt sich, dass ältere Verkehrsteilnehmer häufig als 
Pkw-Insassen, Radfahrende und Fußgänger verunglücken. Zudem sind Pkw-Fahrer und 
Radfahrende im Alter von 65 Jahren und älter häufig an Fahrunfällen und 
Abbiege‑, Einbiege- und Kreuzenunfällen beteiligt. Spurhalte- und 
Notbremsassistenten haben ein hohes Unfallvermeidungspotenzial, da sie kritische 
Situationen im letzten Moment entschärfen können. An die körperlichen 
Eigenschaften angepasste Rückhaltesysteme (Airbags, Gurte) könnten dagegen die 
Verletzungsschwere der älteren Pkw-Insassen minimieren.

PURPOSE: Propose further indicators for helping to detect hand osteoarthritis 
(HOA) using either active or functional ranges of motion (AROM or FROM).
METHOD: Hand kinematics data of 16 hand joint angles from previous studies were 
used, taken from healthy participants and HOA patients with differently affected 
joints and distinct levels of compromise. Data consisted of: (i) AROM (extreme 
values and ranges); (ii) FROM while performing the Sollerman Hand Function Test 
(mean, extreme percentiles and ranges). Two linear discriminant analyses 
(stepwise method) were conducted, one per dataset (AROM and FROM), with 
condition (healthy/patient) as the grouping variable. The potential predictors 
were the data from the joints with significant differences between samples for 
each analysis (A-predictors and F-predictors).
RESULTS: Good sensitivity-specificity values of 85.2-90.9% and 93.8-93.9% for 
F-predictors and A-predictors, respectively. Sets of predictors corresponded to 
the joints more commonly affected by HOA. F-predictors: lower maximal flexion of 
carpometacarpal and interphalangeal thumb joints, higher maximal flexion of 
thumb metacarpal joint, lower flexion/extension range of ring proximal 
interphalangeal joint and higher maximal little finger adduction. A-predictors: 
narrower flexion/extension range of the thumb carpometacarpal joint, lesser 
extension of the ring metacarpophalangeal joint; lower flexion of the middle 
finger proximal interphalangeal joint along with a narrower palmar arch range.
CONCLUSION: Both sets of predictors provide discrimination capacity of HOA with 
good sensitivity-specificity, slightly better for A-predictors. The AROM 
measurement is technically less demanding and can be clinically applied even 
with manual goniometry.

Plain Language Summary: Range of motion is affected by hand osteoarthritis even 
before joint deformity is noticeable.Active (AROM) or functional (FROM) ranges 
of motion can help to identify potential hand osteoarthritis and opening up the 
possibility of applying rehabilitation treatments to improve quality of life.The 
AROM measurement is technically less demanding and can be clinically applied 
even with manual goniometry.

Background: Biomarkers are measurable indicators of normal biological processes, 
which provide an objective assessment of the physiologic state of living 
systems. Saliva contains several biomarkers that serve as a diagnostic tool in 
health and disease. Evaluation of a multitude of salivary components could 
potentially predict the clinical outcome. This is especially critical in a 
chronic, potentially life-threatening condition like human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) infection. Scrupulous evaluation of relevant biomarkers could 
facilitate the early detection of HIV, determine the stage of infection and 
monitor the disease progression. Currently, there is a paucity of validated 
biomarkers in saliva predicting the disease progression in people living with 
HIV. In this scoping review, we aim to provide an overview of the available 
evidence on salivary markers associated with the progression of disease in 
people living with HIV. Methods: The authors shall develop a tailored search 
strategy for each database using relevant keywords. We will search for eligible 
studies indexed in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane 
Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and 
gray literature. We will restrict the search to studies published in the English 
language. Following deduplication, all search results will be exported to the 
EPPI reviewer web, where two independent reviewers using a data extraction tool 
developed and pretested by the review authors will screen eligible studies. The 
result of this review will be reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) 
checklist and reporting guidelines. Discussion: The proposed scoping review 
protocol will enable the identification and assessment of salivary biomarkers, 
which can predict disease progression in patients with HIV infection. The 
synthesis of evidence from this review will assist in improving our current 
understanding of biomarkers used to evaluate the progression of HIV infection.

Introduction The Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 
criteria for axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA) allow for the 
classification of patients with an age of onset of disease of less than 45 
years. However, SpA can start after this age. This study aimed to assess the 
characteristics of late-onset SpA (SpA>45 years) in the Moroccan registry of 
biological therapies in rheumatic diseases (RBSMR). Methods A cross-sectional 
study was conducted using the baseline data of the RBSMR. The protocol for the 
original RBSMR study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee for 
Biomedical Research Mohammed V University - Rabat, Faculty of Medicine and 
Pharmacy of Rabat (approval number for the study was 958/09/19, and the date of 
approval was September 11, 2019), and all patients had given their written 
consent. Patients who met the 2009 ASAS criteria for SpA were included. They 
were divided into two groups: early-onset SpA (≤ 45 years) and late-onset SpA 
(>45 years). Clinical, biological, radiological, and therapy data of the two 
groups were compared. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v25 software 
(IBM Corp. Armonk, NY). Parameters with a p-value ≤0.05 were considered 
significant. Results Our population consisted of 194 patients. Thirty-one 
patients (16%) had late-onset SpA. Comparison between patients with early-onset 
(≤45 years) and late-onset SpA (>45 years) revealed that late-onset SpA had a 
higher tender joint count (p=0.01), a higher swollen joint count (p=0.02), 
depression (p=0.00), fibromyalgia (p=0.001), hypercholesterolemia (p=0.01), and 
a lower frequency of coxitis (p=0.008). Logistic regression analysis confirmed 
that late-onset SpA was associated with a higher tender joint count (OR=0.93, CI 
95%: 0.88-0.98), a higher swollen joint count (OR=0.92, CI 95%: 0.85-0.99), 
depression ( OR=0.19, CI 95%:0.04-0.38), fibromyalgia (OR=1.75, CI 95%: 
1.74-17.85), and a lower frequency of coxitis ( OR=0.29, CI 95%: 0.11-0.75). 
Conclusion As life expectancy increases, late-onset SpA will become increasingly 
common. It is therefore imperative to determine its characteristics. In the 
RBSMR study, late-onset SpA was associated with a high number of tender and 
swollen joints, depression, fibromyalgia, and a lower frequency of coxitis.

Edible insects (EI) are also becoming as a part of the diet due to their 
nutritional value and health benefits in many regions of the world. These EI are 
inexhaustible sources accessible by garnering from the wild with high feed 
conversion efficiency. Appreciating the budding of EI in justifiable food 
production, enlightening food security and biodiversity conversion, is promising 
a sufficient supply of the insect resource for future food to the world. These 
insects are processed to develop new products, improve organoleptic and 
nutritional parameters as well as the extension of shelf life. In this review, 
we discuss the edible insect characteristics, the potential application of EI in 
food industry, processing, pretreatments, drying, extraction of edible compounds 
like protein, lipid and chitin various food products formulation, safety 
regulation. Availability of broad nutritional spectrum of EI includes protein, 
mono and poly unsaturaturated fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, amino aids and 
minerals has been used as an ingredient in development of various forms of food 
products such as flours in the form of whole insect powder, protein isolate, 
canned products, extruded products, hard candies, spreads, liquor infusion, 
cookies and other products.

Tumor heterogeneity remains a major challenge for disease subtyping, risk 
stratification, and accurate clinical management. Exosome-based liquid biopsy 
can effectively overcome the limitations of tissue biopsy, achieving minimal 
invasion, multi-point dynamic monitoring, and good prognosis assessment, and has 
broad clinical prospects. However, there is still lacking comprehensive analysis 
of tumor-derived exosome (TDE)-based stratification of risk patients and 
prognostic assessment for breast cancer with systematic dissection of biological 
heterogeneity. In this study, the robust corroborative analysis for biomarker 
discovery (RCABD) strategy was used for the identification of exosome molecules, 
differential expression verification, risk prediction modeling, heterogenous 
dissection with multi-ome (6101 molecules), our ExoBCD database (306 molecules), 
and 53 independent studies (481 molecules). Our results showed that a 
10-molecule exosome-derived signature (exoSIG) could successfully fulfill breast 
cancer risk stratification, making it a novel and accurate exosome prognostic 
indicator (Cox P = 9.9E-04, HR = 3.3, 95% CI 1.6-6.8). Interestingly, HLA-DQB2 
and COL17A1, closely related to tumor metastasis, achieved high performance in 
prognosis prediction (86.35% contribution) and accuracy (Log-rank P = 0.028, AUC 
= 85.42%). With the combined information of patient age and tumor stage, they 
formed a bimolecular risk signature (Clinmin-exoSIG) and a convenient nomogram 
as operable tools for clinical applications. In conclusion, as an extension of 
ExoBCD, this study conducted systematic analyses to identify prognostic 
multi-molecular panel and risk signature, stratify patients and dissect 
biological heterogeneity based on breast cancer exosomes from a multi-omics 
perspective. Our results provide an important reference for in-depth exploration 
of the "biological heterogeneity - risk stratification - prognosis prediction".

BACKGROUND: Receiving a diagnosis of lung cancer is an emotional event, not 
least because it is usually diagnosed at advanced stages with limited life 
expectancy. Although evidence-based educational, emotional, and social 
interventions exist, they reach few patients and usually when it is too late.
OBJECTIVE: This project will be carried out in a comprehensive center for cancer 
care and health research, aiming to study the efficacy, costs, and utility of an 
eHealth ecosystem to meet the psychosocial needs of patients with advanced lung 
cancer.
METHOD: We will enroll 76 patients with advanced lung cancer into an eHealth 
ecosystem of stepped and personalized psychosocial care for 9 months. These
