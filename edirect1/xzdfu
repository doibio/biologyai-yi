IMPORTANCE: The BEACON trial showed that combination therapy with encorafenib 
(BRAF inhibitor) and cetuximab (EGFR inhibitor) was associated with prolonged 
overall survival compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with metastatic 
BRAF variant colorectal cancer. However, the cost-effectiveness of using these 
agents in this clinical setting is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To create a cost-effectiveness model to compare doublet therapy 
(encorafenib plus cetuximab) with standard chemotherapy (cetuximab plus 
irinotecan or cetuximab plus folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan) in 
treating patients with metastatic BRAF variant colorectal cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation constructed a Markov 
model to compare the lifetime cost and utility of doublet therapy and standard 
chemotherapy. Parametric survival modeling was used to extrapolate the 
effectiveness of each line of therapy from large clinical trials. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed the uncertainty in the model. 
Patients mirrored the cohorts in the BEACON trial: they had metastatic BRAF 
variant colorectal cancer and were followed up as they progressed through 
multiple lines of therapy, best supportive care, and death. Data collection and 
data analysis were performed from November 15, 2019, to July 14, 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, which was calculated using the cumulative cost and 
effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), of doublet therapy 
compared with standard chemotherapy.
RESULTS: The model patient cohort had a mean age of 61 years, and 53% of the 
patients were women, 66% had 1 previous line of therapy, and 8% had high 
microsatellite instability. Doublet therapy was associated with an improvement 
of 0.15 QALYs compared with standard chemotherapy. However, the incremental cost 
of doublet therapy was $78 233, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $523 374 per QALY gained. Concomitant decreases in the price of 
encorafenib and cetuximab are needed to achieve cost-effectiveness at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that doublet therapy for metastatic 
BRAF variant colorectal cancer was unlikely to be cost-effective under current 
pricing. Cost-effectiveness needs to be considered in clinical trial design, 
particularly when combining new therapies with non-cost-effective treatments 
that are coadministered without a fixed duration.

OBJECTIVE: To identify social and health-related predictors of the number of 
days lost due to sickness absence (SA) and disability pension (DP) among 
initially 55-year-old public-sector workers.
METHODS: The data from the Finnish Helsinki Health Study included participants 
aged 55 years at the baseline (in 2000-2002, N = 1630, 81% women), and were 
enriched with register-based information on SA and DP. The cumulative number of 
calendar days lost due to SA ≥ 1 day or DP between ages 55 and 65 was 
calculated. Negative binomial regression model was used to identify the 
predictors of days lost.
RESULTS: The average calendar days lost was 316 days (about 220 working days) 
during a 10-year follow-up, and 44% were due to SA and 56% due to DP. Smoking 
[incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.40 for past and IRR = 1.30, CI 
1.07-1.58 for current], binge drinking (IRR = 1.22, CI 1.02-1.46), lifting or 
pulling/pushing heavy loads (IRR = 1.35, CI 1.10-1.65), awkward working 
positions (IRR = 1.24, CI 1.01-1.53), long-standing illness limiting work or 
daily activities (IRR = 2.32, CI 1.93-2.79), common mental disorder (IRR = 1.52, 
CI 1.30-1.79), and multisite pain (IRR = 1.50, CI 1.23-1.84) increased the 
number of days lost, while high level of education (IRR = 0.66, CI 0.52-0.82) 
and moderate level of leisure-time physical activity (IRR = 0.80, CI 0.67-0.94) 
reduced the number of days lost.
CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable lifestyle risk factors, workload factors, common mental 
disorder, and multisite pain substantially increase the number of days lost. 
However, the findings of this study could be generalized to female workers in 
the public sector. Future research should also consider shorter SA spells in 
estimating working years lost and working life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Association mapping has been advocated as the method of choice for 
identifying loci involved in the inheritance of complex traits in crop species. 
This method involves identifying markers with significant differences in allele 
frequency between individuals with a phenotype of interest and a set of 
unrelated control individuals.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study is not only to investigate the genetic 
diversity and relationships of the basic molecular markers of near-isogenic 
lines (NILs) of waxy maize, but it is also to identify molecular markers related 
to interesting seed characteristics including 4 seed quantity traits and 4 seed 
phenotypic traits using association analysis with population structure.
METHODS: We performed association mapping of 200 SSR markers and 8 seed 
characteristics among 10 NILs of waxy maize and two parental lines (HW3, HW9) 
(recurrent parent) of "Mibaek 2" variety.
RESULTS: In population structure and cluster analysis, the 10 NILs and two 
parental lines were divided into two groups. Seven inbred lines, including HW3, 
were assigned to Group I. Group II contained 5 inbred lines, including HW9. In 
addition, we found that 32 SSR markers associate with 8 seed characteristics in 
10 NILs. In particular, five SSR markers (umc1986, umc1747, umc2275, phi078, 
umc1366) were together associated with more than one seed characteristics such 
as EL, 100 KW, SCC, R, L*, and V.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the utility of SSR analysis for studying GD, 
population structure, and association mapping in 10 NILs and two parental lines 
(HW3, HW9) of "Mibaek 2" variety.

BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization launched the Global Action Plan for 
Physical Activity (GAPPA) in 2018, which set a global target of a 15% 
relative reduction in the prevalence of physical inactivity by 2030. This 
target, however, could be acheived in various ways.
METHODS: We use an established multi-state life table model to estimate the 
health and economic gains that would accrue over the lifetime of the 2011 New 
Zealand population if the GAPPA target was met under two different approaches: 
(1) an equal shift approach where physical activity increases by the same 
absolute amount for everyone; (2) a proportional shift approach where physical 
activity increases proportionally to current activity levels.
FINDINGS: An equal shift approach to meeting the GAPPA target would result in 
197,000 health-adjusted life-years (HALYs) gained (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 
152,000-246,000) and healthcare system cost savings of US$1.57b (95%UI 
$1.16b-$2.03b; 0% discount rate). A proportional shift to the GAPPA target would 
result in 158,000 HALYs (95%UI 127,000-194,000) and US$1.29billion (95%UI 
$0.99b-$1.64b) savings to the healthcare system.
INTERPRETATION: Achieving the GAPPA target would result in large health gains 
and savings to the healthcare system. However, not all population approaches to 
increasing physical activity are equal-some population shifts bring greater 
health benefits. Our results demonstrate the need to consider the entire 
population physical activity distribution in addition to evaluating progress 
towards a target.

Plain Language Summary: The World Health Organization launched the Global Action 
Plan for Physical Activity in 2018, which set a global target to reduce physical 
inactivity. We explored different ways in which this target could be met and 
found that some approaches to meeting the target would bring larger health gains 
and savings to the healthcare system than others.

SUMMARY: Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) is a lysosomal storage disorder 
(LSD) that results in the accumulation of sulfate esters which go on to cause 
neurological deterioration and mental delay, skin changes, and dysmorphism. The 
disease can be categorized into three subtypes based on the age of onset: 
neonatal, late infantile, or juvenile. Our patient is a 2.5-year-old girl, the 
only child of a healthy couple. Prior to the presentation of the disease, she 
had not been noted to have any previous health complications. The condition 
began at the age of 6 months with developmental regression and global hypotonia. 
Following thorough evaluation and testing, the patient was diagnosed with severe 
late infantile MSD, although some features, such as minimal mental 
deterioration, minimal dysmorphic facial features, and minimal organ 
enlargement, did not fully correlate with the diagnosis, since in cases of 
severe forms of the condition these features are almost always quite marked. The 
unexpected minimalism of some of the patient's MSD signs in spite of the 
severity of her MSD condition made her case worth further studying.
LEARNING POINTS: Treating dermatologic signs and symptoms greatly eased our 
patient's discomfort. We would suggest the use of appropriate supportive 
treatment for symptom management regardless of the life expectancy of the 
patient. As regards the diagnosis of MLD, given that in some cases the patient 
may present with irregular features of the condition, a genetic evaluation may 
be useful for accurate diagnosis. If motor function impairment is followed by 
dermatologic involvement, as seen in our patient and in many cases in the 
literature, MSD must be considered, and additional tests should be done to rule 
it out.

Air pollution has association with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
and reduced life expectancy. This study investigated the deleterious effects 
caused by tobacco smoke and diesel exhaust particles (DEP) from vehicles 
operating under EURO 3 and EURO 5 standards. Experiments were carried out on 
C57BL/6 mice divided into six groups: control group, group exposed to cigarette 
smoke (CS), two groups exposed to DEP (AAE3 and AAE5), and two groups exposed to 
tobacco smoke and vehicle DEP (CSE3 and CSE5). Results showed that, when 
compared to AA, groups AAE3 and AAE5 showed changes in respiratory mechanics, 
and that DEP originating from EURO 5 diesel vehicles was less harmful when 
compared to DEP originating from EURO 3 diesel vehicles. Analyses of groups CSE3 
and CSE5 revealed increased inspiratory capacity and decreased tissue elastance, 
when compared to their respective controls, suggesting an exacerbation of 
changes in respiratory system mechanics compatible with COPD development.

BACKGROUND: Due to the increased life expectancy, the prevalence of 
aging-related health conditions, such as cognitive impairment, dementia and 
Alzheimer's disease is increasing. Among the modifiable risk factors, dietary 
factors have proved to be of primary importance in preserving and improving 
mental health and cognitive status in older adults, possibly through the 
modulation of adult neurogenesis, neuronal plasticity and brain signaling. 
Feeding/fasting timing manipulation has emerged as an innovative strategy to 
counteract and treat cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the association between the timing of the feeding period and cognitive status in 
a cross-sectional cohort of adults living in the Mediterranean area.
METHODS: Demographic and dietary characteristics of 883 adults living in 
Southern Italy (Sicily) were analyzed. Food frequency questionnaires were used 
to calculate the time window between the first and the last meal of an average 
day. Participants with an eating time window duration of more than 10 h were 
then identified, as well as those with eating time restricted to less than 10 h 
(TRF).
RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounding factors, individuals adherent 
to TRF were less likely to have cognitive impairment, compared to those with no 
eating time restrictions [odds ratio (OR) = 0.28; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 
0.07-0.90]; a similar association was found for individuals having breakfast (OR 
= 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16-0.89), but not for those having dinner.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study reveal that time restricted eating may be 
positively associated with cognitive status, and thus exert plausible effects on 
brain health.

Studies connecting microbiome composition and functional performance in wildlife 
have received little attention and understanding their connections with wildlife 
physical condition are sorely needed. We studied the variation in gut microbiota 
(hard fecal pellets) between allopatric subspecies of the European wild rabbit 
in wild populations and in captured individuals studied under captivity. We 
evaluated the influence of environmental and host-specific factors. The 
microbiome of wild rabbit populations reduced its heterogeneity under controlled 
conditions. None of the host-specific factors tested correlated with the 
microbiota composition. We only observed significant intra-group dispersion for 
the age factor. The most diverse microbiomes were rich in Ruminococcaceae 
potentially holding an enriched functional profile with dominance of cellulases 
and xylanases, and suggesting higher efficiency in the digestion of fiber-rich 
food. Conversely, low diversity gut microbiomes showed dominance of 
Enterobacteriaceae potentially rich in amylases. We preliminary noticed 
geographical variations in field populations with higher dominance of 
Ruminococcaceae in south-western than in north-eastern Spain. Spatial 
differences appeared not to be subspecies driven, since they were lost in 
captivity, but environmentally driven, although differences in social structure 
and behavior may also play a role that deserve further investigations. A 
marginally significant relationship between the 
Ruminococcaceae/Enterobacteriaceae ratio and potential life expectancy was 
observed in captive rabbits. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome may 
determine the efficiency of feeding resource exploitation, and can also be a 
potential proxy for life expectancy, with potential applications for the 
management of declining wild herbivorous populations. Such hypotheses remain to 
be explored in the future.

BACKGROUND: Statistical models are increasingly being used to estimate and 
project the prevalence and burden of asthma. Given substantial variations in 
these estimates, there is a need to critically assess the properties of these 
models and assess their transparency and reproducibility. We aimed to critically 
appraise the strengths, limitations and reproducibility of existing models for 
estimating and projecting the global, regional and national prevalence and 
burden of asthma.
METHODS: We undertook a systematic review, which involved searching Medline, 
Embase, World Health Organization Library and Information Services (WHOLIS) and 
Web of Science from 1980 to 2017 for modelling studies. Two reviewers 
independently assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion and then 
assessed their strengths, limitations and reproducibility using pre-defined 
quality criteria. Data were descriptively and narratively synthesised.
RESULTS: We identified 108 eligible studies, which employed a total of 51 
models: 42 models were used to derive national level estimates, two models for 
regional estimates, four models for global and regional estimates and three 
models for global, regional and national estimates. Ten models were used to 
estimate the prevalence of asthma, 27 models estimated the burden of asthma - 
including, health care service utilisation, disability-adjusted life years, 
mortality and direct and indirect costs of asthma - and 14 models estimated both 
the prevalence and burden of asthma. Logistic and linear regression models were 
most widely used for national estimates. Different versions of the DisMod-MR- 
Bayesian meta-regression models and Cause Of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) were 
predominantly used for global, regional and national estimates. Most models 
suffered from a number of methodological limitations - in particular, poor 
reporting, insufficient quality and lack of reproducibility.
CONCLUSIONS: Whilst global, regional and national estimates of asthma prevalence 
and burden continue to inform health policy and investment decisions on asthma, 
most models used to derive these estimates lack the required reproducibility. 
There is a need for better-constructed models for estimating and projecting the 
prevalence and disease burden of asthma and a related need for better reporting 
of models, and making data and code available to facilitate replication.

INTRODUCTION: Cerebrovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of 
morbidity and mortality globally. In South Africa, it was the fourth leading 
cause of death in 2016, responsible for 5.1% of all deaths - the leading cause 
of death in individuals 65 years and older. Atrial fibrillation accounts for 15% 
of all strokes and 25% are diagnosed when patients present with a stroke. We set 
out to determine the prevalence of atrial fibrillation in patients with 
confirmed ischaemic strokes in a district level hospital in the Western Cape, 
South Africa.
METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted at Mitchells Plain Hospital in 
Cape Town and data was collected over a one-year period. Patients diagnosed with 
a stroke were identified from an electronic patient register and relevant 
radiology and clinical data were sourced retrospectively. The diagnosis of 
ischaemic stroke was confirmed by a CT scan report and ECGs were independently 
screened by two Emergency Physicians. Ethical approval was granted by the 
University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee [790/2018].
RESULTS: The proportion of adult patients with a stroke diagnosis was 2%. Of the 
included cases, 80% had ischaemic strokes and 11% had haemorrhagic strokes. 11% 
of all patients with ischaemic strokes had atrial fibrillation, 67% of those 
presumed new. A total of 60 (15%) of all patients with ischaemic stroke were 
aged 45 years or younger. The inpatient mortality rate was statistically higher 
in patients who had atrial fibrillation (26% vs 7%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: With the increasing population life expectancy, and prevalence of 
cardiovascular disease the prevalence of atrial fibrillation and its 
complications will increase. Since the risk of stroke related to atrial 
fibrillation can be reduced significantly by oral anticoagulation, further 
studies should aim to explore barriers and challenges to effective screening.

BACKGROUND: Currently, one-year survival of older people with complex 
co-morbidities is unpredictable. Identifying older adults with a reduced life 
expectancy will lead to more targeted care and better healthcare resource 
allocation.
METHODS: Development and validation of one-year and three-month mortality risks 
in people aged ≥65 years who had completed an International Resident Assessment 
Instrument-Home Care (interRAI-HC) assessment between July 2012 and March 2018. 
Data was split into development (90%) and validation data sets (10%). A 
multivariable logistic regression model using data from 108 interRAI questions 
across multiple domains was developed and validated using discrimination metrics 
and calibration curves. Variables each explaining at least 1% of the model were 
then used to develop and validate a parsimonious model. Subgroups by sex, age, 
ethnicity, and comorbidities were evaluated.
FINDINGS: There were 104,436 persons (60.2% female; mean age 82.1 years) in the 
study cohort of whom 20,972 (20.1%) died within one year. The full multivariable 
model had area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.778 to 0.795 in the 5 validation 
datasets and was well calibrated. After variable reduction a parsimonious model 
consisted of 16 variables and was well calibrated and the AUC remained high: 
0.773 (0.769 to 0.777). The three-month parsimonious model comprised 22 
variables and was well calibrated with an AUC of 0.843 (95%CI: 0.839 to 0.848).
INTERPRETATION: These community-based risk prediction models accurately predict 
mortality in older people with complex co-morbidities. They may contribute to 
both forecasting for policy making and clinical decision making regarding an 
individual's needs.

PURPOSE: The three-layered thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) encapsulates the erector 
spinae and the quadratus lumborum and has been a major concern for physical 
therapists. However, knowledge of its prenatal development and growth is 
limited.
METHODS: Histological examination of 25 embryos and fetuses at 6-37 weeks (CRLs, 
15-310 mm).
RESULTS: At the posterior end, the abdominal muscles continued toward an initial 
posterior layer of the TLF (pTLF) at 6 weeks, but the connection became narrow 
and limited to the obliquus externus aponeurosis until near term. The middle 
layer of the TLF (mTLF) appeared as a posterior continuation of the 
transversalis fascia at 9 weeks and, depending on a mechanical demand for the 
vertebral column extension near term, it grew as a thick intermuscular septum 
between the iliocostalis and quadratus lumborum. Thus, the mTLF lateral end 
changed from the abdominal wall to the back or pTLF. The serratus posterior 
inferior originated from the pTLF after 9 weeks, but a connection of the 
latissimus dorsi with the fascia was established much later. Near term, the 
gluteus maximus was attached to an aponeurosis covering the multifidus behind 
the sacrum. Therefore, the pTLF extended to cover the gluteal muscles.
CONCLUSION: We rejected the hypothesis that the mTLF develops as a marginal 
tissue between the primitive epaxial and hypaxial muscles. This study seemed to 
be the first report showing a fact that, within prenatal life, a drastic change 
is likely to occur in interfascial connections and their topographical relation 
to muscles; the TLF might be the best sample.

The number of older patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing 
due to both improvements in the life expectancy of patients with long-lasting 
IBD and later onset of the disease. In spite of a less aggressive IBD phenotype, 
disease management in older patients is hampered by comorbidities and 
polypharmacy (which increase the risk of drug-related adverse events and errors 
in medication intake) and also by an increased risk of the infections and 
malignancies associated with the immunosuppressive drugs that are frequently 
used to treat IBD. Thiopurines are the most frequently used immunosuppressive 
drugs in IBD, though they are often discontinued due to adverse events. However, 
when tolerated, thiopurines are efficient in the maintenance of remission in 
ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. In fact, thiopurines still have a role 
to play in the treatment algorithm of older patients with IBD because anti-tumor 
necrosis factor agents do not provide clear advantages for this population in 
terms of their safety profile, while data on the new biological drugs are still 
scarce. In this article, we review the optimal use of thiopurines in older 
patients with IBD.

OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The goal of this scoping review is to evaluate and 
synthesize the published research regarding bullying and children who are deaf 
or hard-of-hearing (DHH).
STUDY DESIGN: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for scoping review (PRISMA-ScR) statement was used as 
the guideline for conducting this review.
METHODS: This review included studies assessing pediatric (0-21 years) DHH 
children. Seventy records underwent the initial title-abstract screening, 33 
underwent full-text review, and 23 studies met inclusion criteria. During the 
data extraction process, an additional six were excluded, resulting in a total 
of 17 evaluated studies.
RESULTS: Of the 17 studies assessed, nine compared peer victimization of DHH 
children and their hearing peers. Of those, seven studies reported that hearing 
loss (HL) is significantly associated with increased victimization. Two studies 
found that HL is significantly associated with decreased bullying perpetration. 
Notably, bullying in DHH children was not associated with a visible sign of 
disability, such as a hearing assistive device. Rather, variables such as 
educational setting, parental, and peer support are more likely to mediate 
bullying in this population.
CONCLUSIONS: DHH children have a higher risk of peer victimization and may bully 
others less often than their hearing peers. Studies described the health 
consequences of bullying in children who are DHH, including sleep issues and 
anxiety. These consequences may have implications for the patients' overall HL 
management. Additional research regarding bullying interventions and prevention 
in this population should be conducted.

IMPORTANCE: Prostate radiation therapy (PRT) is a treatment option in men with 
low-volume metastatic prostate cancer based on the results of the Systemic 
Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy 
Arm H (STAMPEDE-H) trial. However, the cost-effectiveness of this treatment 
remains unaddressed.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of PRT when added to androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) for men with low-volume metastatic hormone-sensitive 
prostate cancer (mHSPC).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation used microsimulation 
modeling to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding PRT to ADT. A simulated 
cohort of 10 000 individuals with low-volume mHSPC was created. Data from men 
with low-volume mHSPC were extracted and analyzed from January 18, 2019, through 
July 4, 2020. Transition probabilities were extracted from the STAMPEDE-H study. 
Health states included stable disease, progression, second progression, and 
death. Individual grade 2 or higher genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxic 
events associated with PRT were tracked. Univariable deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty with regard to the model 
assumptions. Health state utility estimates were based on the published 
literature.
EXPOSURES: The combination of PRT and ADT using regimens of 20 fractions and 6 
weekly fractions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included net quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), costs in US dollars, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A 
strategy was classified as dominant if it was associated with higher QALYs at 
lower costs than the alternative and dominated if it was associated with fewer 
QALYs at higher costs than the alternative.
RESULTS: For the base case scenario of men 68 years of age with low-volume 
mHSPC, the modeled outcomes were similar to the target clinical data for overall 
survival, failure-free survival, and rates of PRT-related toxic effects. The 
addition of PRT was a dominant strategy compared with ADT alone, with a gain of 
0.16 QALYs (95% CI, 0.15-0.17 QALYs) and a reduction in net costs by $19 472 
(95% CI, $23 096-$37 362) at 37 months of follow-up and a gain of 0.81 QALYs 
(95% CI, 0.73-0.89 QALYs) and savings of $30 229 (95% CI, $23 096-$37 362) with 
lifetime follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the economic evaluation, PRT was a dominant 
treatment strategy compared with ADT alone. These findings suggest that addition 
of PRT to ADT is a cost-effective treatment for men with low-volume mHSPC.

BACKGROUND: Circulating biomarkers are associated with the development of 
coronary heart disease (CHD) and its complications by reflecting 
pathophysiological pathways and/or organ dysfunction. We explored the 
associations between 157 cardiovascular (CV) and inflammatory biomarkers and CV 
death using proximity extension assays (PEA) in patients with chronic CHD.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The derivation cohort consisted of 605 cases with CV death 
and 2,788 randomly selected non-cases during 3-5 years follow-up included in the 
STabilization of Atherosclerotic plaque By Initiation of darapLadIb TherapY 
(STABILITY) trial between 2008 and 2010. The replication cohort consisted of 245 
cases and 1,042 non-cases during 12 years follow-up included in the Ludwigshafen 
Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study between 1997 and 2000. Biomarker 
levels were measured with conventional immunoassays and/or with the OLINK PEA 
panels CVD I and Inflammation. Associations with CV death were evaluated by 
Random Survival Forest (RF) and Cox regression analyses. Both cohorts had the 
same median age (65 years) and 20% smokers, while there were slight differences 
in male sex (82% and 76%), hypertension (70% and 78%), and diabetes (39% and 
30%) in the respective STABILITY and LURIC cohorts. The analyses identified 18 
biomarkers with confirmed independent association with CV death by Boruta 
analyses and statistical significance (all p < 0.0001) by Cox regression when 
adjusted for clinical characteristics in both cohorts. Most prognostic 
information was carried by N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide 
(NTproBNP), hazard ratio (HR for 1 standard deviation [SD] increase of the log 
scale of the distribution of the biomarker in the replication cohort) 2.079 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.799-2.402), and high-sensitivity troponin T (cTnT-hs) 
HR 1.715 (95% CI 1.491-1.973). The other proteins with independent associations 
were growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) HR 1.728 (95% CI 1.527-1.955), 
transmembrane immunoglobulin and mucin domain protein (TIM-1) HR 1.555 (95% CI 
1.362-1.775), renin HR 1.501 (95% CI 1.305-1.727), osteoprotegerin (OPG) HR 
1.488 (95% CI 1.297-1.708), soluble suppression of tumorigenesis 2 protein 
(sST2) HR 1.478 (95% CI 1.307-1.672), cystatin-C (Cys-C) HR 1.370 (95% CI 
1.243-1.510), tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2 
(TRAIL-R2) HR 1.205 (95% CI 1.131-1.285), carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125) HR 
1.347 (95% CI 1.226-1.479), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) HR 1.399 (95% CI 
1.255-1.561), interleukin 6 (IL-6) HR 1.478 (95% CI 1.316-1.659), hepatocyte 
growth factor (HGF) HR 1.259 (95% CI 1.134-1.396), spondin-1 HR 1.295 (95% CI 
1.156-1.450), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) HR 1.349 (95% CI 
1.237-1.472), chitinase-3 like protein 1 (CHI3L1) HR 1.284 (95% CI 1.129-1.461), 
tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1) HR 1.486 (95% CI 1.307-1.689), and 
adrenomedullin (AM) HR 1.750 (95% CI 1.490-2.056). The study is limited by the 
differences in design, size, and length of follow-up of the 2 studies and the 
lack of results from coronary angiograms and follow-up of nonfatal events.
CONCLUSIONS: Profiles of levels of multiple plasma proteins might be useful for 
the identification of different pathophysiological pathways associated with an 
increased risk of CV death in patients with chronic CHD.

BACKGROUND: The paradigm shift in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment options in 
the last five years has raised the prospect of eliminating the disease as a 
global health threat. This will require a step-change in the number being 
treated with the new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Given constrained budgets 
and competing priorities, policy makers need information on how to scale-up 
access to HCV treatment. To inform such decisions, we examined the cost 
effectiveness of screening and treatment interventions in Yunnan, China.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We simulated the HCV epidemic using a previously published 
model of HCV transmission and disease progression, calibrated to Yunnan data, 
and implemented a range of treatment and screening interventions from 2019. We 
incorporated treatment, diagnosis, and medical costs (expressed in 2019 US 
Dollars, USD) to estimate the lifetime benefits and costs of interventions. 
Using this model, we asked: is introducing DAAs cost effective from a healthcare 
sector perspective; what is the optimal combination of screening interventions; 
and what is the societal return on investment of intervention? The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of switching to DAAs with a median cost of 7,400 
USD (50,000 Chinese Yuan) per course is 500 USD/disability adjusted life year 
(DALY) averted; at a threshold of 50% of Yunnan gross domestic product (2,600 
USD), switching to DAAs is cost effective 94% of the time. At this threshold, 
the optimal, cost-effective intervention comprises screening people who inject 
drugs, those in HIV care, men who have sex with men, and ensuring access to DAAs 
for all those newly diagnosed with HCV. For each USD invested in this 
intervention, there is an additional 0·80 USD (95% credible interval: 0·17-1·91) 
returned through reduced costs of disease or increased productivity. Returns on 
investment are lower (and potentially negative) if a sufficiently long-term 
horizon, encompassing the full stream of future benefits, is not adopted. The 
study had two key limitations: costing data were not always specific to Yunnan 
province but were taken from China-level studies; and modelled interventions may 
require more operational research to ensure they can be effectively and 
efficiently rolled-out to the entire province.
CONCLUSIONS: Introducing DAAs is cost effective, the optimal package of 
screening measures is focussed on higher risk groups, and there are likely to be 
positive returns from investing in such HCV interventions. Our analysis shows 
that targeted investment in HCV interventions will have net benefits to society; 
these benefits will only increase as DAA costs fall.

University, Leon, Bozeman, MT.

The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (F.), contributes to the 
pollination of more than two-thirds of alfalfa used in seed production in North 
America. However, losses in managed populations of more than 50% are common in 
the United States. Thus, understanding the causes of mortality of M. rotundata 
is critical to find ways to maintain and increase bee populations. Over 2 yr, we 
identified and quantified six mortality classes of M. rotundata, as well as 
estimated mortality risk using the demographic life-table model, M-DEC. Research 
was conducted on an alfalfa field in Toston, Montana and offspring mortality was 
assessed in the fall of each year. Nest shelters were manipulated for a main 
temperature treatment (low vs high), and nest boxes inside the shelters were 
manipulated for a parasitism sub-treatment (parasitism-resistant vs 
parasitism-enabled). Total mortality was approximately 15% for both years, but
