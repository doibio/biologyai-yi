PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Optimal blood pressure (BP) parameters among patients with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been a matter of debate. This review 
critically evaluates recent literature to better define the associations of BP 
parameters and death among individuals with non-dialysis-dependent CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Observational studies report a "U- or J-shaped" association 
between BP and all-cause mortality in CKD and caution-intensive BP lowering in 
the elderly. Causes of death have been evaluated in a recent report noting 
higher cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular/non-malignant-related mortality 
among CKD population with SBP < 110 and > 150 mmHg. Very few randomized control 
trials evaluated the impact of different BP targets on patient-centered outcomes 
in those with CKD. Recently published SPRINT trial results suggest that 
intensive SBP control (<120 mm Hg) reduces cardiovascular events and all-cause 
death among non-diabetic patients with and without CKD. Clinical trial evidence 
supports lower BP target in those with mild to moderate non-diabetic CKD. 
However, clinical trials are warranted to further determine the beneficial 
effects of intensive blood pressure control in diabetic CKD population. In 
elderly population with CKD, BP targets might need to be individualized based on 
their comorbidities, life expectancy, and other factors.

Over recent years, public involvement in health research has expanded 
considerably. However, public involvement in designing and conducting health 
economics research is seldom reported. Here we describe the development, 
delivery and assessment of an approach for involving people in a clearly defined 
piece of health economics research: selecting health states for valuation in 
estimating quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). This involvement formed part of 
a study to develop a condition-specific preference-based measure of 
health-related quality of life, the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-8D), 
and the work reported here relates to the identification of plausible, or 
realistic, health states for valuation. An Expert Panel of three people with 
multiple sclerosis (MS) was recruited from a local involvement network, and two 
health economists designed an interactive task that enabled the Panel to 
identify health states that were implausible, or unlikely to be experienced. 
Following some initial confusion over terminology, which was resolved by 
discussion with the Panel, the task worked well and can be adapted to select 
health states for valuation in the development of any preference-based measure. 
As part of the involvement process, five themes were identified by the Panel 
members and the researchers which summarised our experiences of public 
involvement in this health economics research example: proportionality, task 
design, prior involvement, protectiveness and partnerships. These are described 
in the paper, along with their practical implications for involving members of 
the public in health economics research. Our experience demonstrates how members 
of the public and health economists can work together to improve the validity of 
health economics research. Plain Language Summary It has become commonplace to 
involve members of the public in health service research. However, published 
reports of involving people in designing health economics research are rare. We 
describe how we designed a way of involving people in a particular piece of 
health economics research.The aim of the work was to produce descriptions of 
different states of health experienced by people with multiple sclerosis (MS). 
These descriptions have since been rated in terms of how good or bad they are in 
a way that can be used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE) to make decisions about what services to fund on the NHS.We formed a 
panel of three people with MS, and designed a task to help the group produce 
health descriptions likely to be experienced by people with MS. After discussion 
about jargon, and working together to find more layman's terms, the task worked 
well, and can be adapted to produce health descriptions for any condition.We 
identified some key themes about working together that give insights into how 
members of the public can be involved in health economics research, and show the 
importance of their involvement in improving the relevance of this research.

OBJECTIVE: We examine whether drugs' excluded versus recommended status on 
pharmacy benefit manager exclusion lists corresponds to evidence from 
cost-effectiveness analyses, lack of evidence, or rebates.
DATA SOURCES: To find cost-effectiveness data for drugs on 2016 exclusion lists 
of CVS Caremark and Express Scripts, we searched the Tufts Cost-Effectiveness 
Analysis Registry and the peer-reviewed literature.
STUDY DESIGN: For each excluded and recommended drug, we compared the mean 
cost-per-QALY, and we calculated the difference between the numbers of excluded 
and recommended drugs for which we could find no cost-effectiveness evidence.
DATA COLLECTION: As keywords in our searches, we used the brand and generic drug 
name and "cost-effectiveness" and "cost-per-quality-adjusted life-year." Of 240 
retrieved studies, 110 were selected for analysis.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The mean cost-per-QALY for excluded drugs was higher 
($51,611) than the cost-per-QALY for recommended drugs ($49,474), but not 
statistically significant. We could find no cost-effectiveness evidence in the 
Registry or peer-reviewed literature for 23 of the excluded drugs, and no 
evidence for 5 of the recommended drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness does not correlate with a drug's excluded or 
recommended status. Lack of cost-effectiveness evidence favors a drug's excluded 
status.

Objective This study analyses the relationship between pro- and anti-longevity 
attitudes, attitudes toward centenarians, and the wish to reach 100 years of age 
in a sample of community dwelling older adults. Methods Participants ( N = 137) 
completed a questionnaire on attitudes toward life-extension and an aging 
semantic differential using centenarians as an attitudinal target. 
Sociodemographic information, perceived health status, and information on 
knowing a centenarian were also obtained. A cluster analysis was used to 
identify subgroups (leaning anti-longevity group vs. leaning prolongevity 
group), and their associations with personal attributes were tested using 
logistic regression models. Results Most respondents said they would wish to 
reach 100 years old (54.7%) and presented a leaning positive attitude toward 
centenarians (52.6%). Holding a negative attitude toward centenarians rather 
than any other attribute increases the odds of having more negative attitudes 
toward life extension. Conclusion Results stress the importance of social views 
on extreme longevity in shaping life extension attitudes.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer among men 
and the second among women in Iran. First-Degree Relatives (FDRs) of patients 
with CRC are known to be at higher risk of CRC. The aim of this study was to 
identify the most cost-effective strategy for CRC screening in Iranian high risk 
individuals.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of six 
colonoscopy screening strategies for individuals at increased risk of CRC 
because of positive history of the disease in at least one first-degree relative 
in their family. Our strategies included five-yearly or ten-yearly colonoscopy 
starting from the age of 40 or 50 and colonoscopy once at 50 or 55 years. Data 
were extracted from the published literature, Globocan 2012 database, and 
national cancer registry reports. The Markov model contained 11 mutually 
exclusive health states. Time horizon of model was life time and cycle duration 
was 1 year. Outcomes included life year gains, Quality Adjusted Life Years 
(QALYs) and costs. The TreeAge Pro software was used for data modeling.
RESULTS: All six screening strategies increased the life expectancy and QALY and 
were costlier than no screening. The incremental cost per QALY gained for CRC 
screening varied from $489 for one colonoscopy screening per lifetime at 55 
years to $3,135 for colonoscopy screening every five years starting at the age 
of 40, compared with no screening. When strategies were compared with the next 
best strategy, dominated strategies were removed from analysis, one colonoscopy 
screening per lifetime at 55 years old; or every ten years starting at the age 
40; or every five years starting at age 40 remained with incremental cost 
effective ratios of $489, $2,505, and $26,080 per QALY gained, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: CRC colonoscopy screening in high-risk individuals is 
cost-effective in Iran. Colonoscopy screening every 10 years starting at the age 
of 40 was the most cost-effective strategy.

INTRODUCTION: Following the implementation of Family Physician (FP) Program in 
rural areas and cities with populations under 20000 in 2005, the Iranian 
Ministry of Health and Medical Education in 2012 decided to implement urban FP 
in large cities with populations more than 20000. Along with the development and 
implementation of urban FP in Iran, local websites and newspapers reflected the 
viewpoints of experts in various levels of health system regarding the various 
stages of Family Medicine (FM) development (from agenda setting to initial 
stages of implementation). This study aimed to explore the major infrastructures 
perceived to be required to achieve desirable implementation of urban FP through 
analyzing experts' viewpoints reflected in the media and interviews.
METHODS: In a qualitative study, we analyzed the contents of health related 
national websites as well as transcribed interviews with key informants. 
Documents were collected from December 2011 to January 2014 and interviews were 
conducted from February 2014 to June 2015. We used mixed thematic approach 
(inductive and deductive) for analysis that was assisted by MAXQDA 12 software.
RESULTS: Infrastructures needed for the implementation of FP were categorized in 
five main themes and 23 subthemes. The themes are: 'Stewardship/governance', 
'Actors and stakeholders', 'structural infrastructure', 'technical 
infrastructure and needed resources', and 'information and communication 
infrastructure'.
CONCLUSIONS: Expansion of FP program to urban settings needs appropriate 
attention to the principles of policy implementation as well as provision of 
robust infrastructures. Well-defined stewardship, revised approach to financial 
regulation and payment system, stakeholder's commitment to collaboration, policy 
for conflict resolution, and universal insurance coverage are pivotal for the 
expansion of family physician program to the urban settings in Iran.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to perform a cost-utility analysis of 
nonsurgical treatments for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in healthy adult 
women with a health system perspective over a 1-year time horizon.
METHODS: A decision tree model was constructed to evaluate the following 
nonsurgical treatment options for SUI in a simulated healthy adult female cohort 
who had failed Kegel exercises: pelvic floor muscle therapy (PFMT), a disposable 
tampon device (Impressa), a self-fitting intravaginal incontinence device 
(Uresta), and a traditional incontinence pessary. Published data and 
consultation with health care providers were used to estimate efficacies and 
costs. Health utility estimates were derived from existing literature. 
Deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed as well as Monte Carlo 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis to account for the impact of parameter 
uncertainty on costs and efficacies for each treatment. Our primary outcome was 
the highest net monetary benefit (NMB), which represents the monetary value of 
the health benefits less the treatment costs. The standard willingness-to-pay 
threshold of US $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year was used.
RESULTS: The utility of SUI in an otherwise healthy patient was 0.81 ± 0.16 and 
for subjective cure was 0.93 ± 0.08. Using base-case estimates, PFMT was the 
most cost-effective treatment with an NMB of US $44,098. The Impressa tampon, 
Uresta, and traditional pessary had NMBs of US $43,970, $43,785, and $42,846, 
respectively. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed PFMT to be the 
most cost-effective treatment option at a willingness to pay of US $50,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of our cost-utility analysis favor PFMT as the most 
cost-effective nonsurgical treatment option for SUI. Cost-effectiveness for 1 
year of treatment was also favorable for Impressa and Uresta. In jurisdictions 
where there is no public funding for PFMT, Impressa or Uresta are alternatives 
for women wishing to avoid surgery.

IMPORTANCE: Preliminary cost-effectiveness analyses of proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) were based on benefits estimated from 
reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that occurred in PCSK9i trials 
with variable results. The recent Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with 
PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial provides better 
information about the effectiveness of the drug.
OBJECTIVE: To use the trial results to determine the cost-effectiveness of a 
PCSK9i and statin treatment strategy compared with a statin alone strategy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We derived observed rates of events, 
outcomes, cost of care, and health insurance from existing literature for a 
theoretical cohort of patients designed to resemble the FOURIER PCSK9i trial 
population and created a Markov model during the time horizon of a full 
lifetime.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio from a health system perspective, and the return on investment from a 
private payer perspective. For both measures, we assumed an annual PCSK9i drug 
price of $14 300, with a lapse in US patent protection that would reduce the 
price by 43% in year 12. Costs were reported in 2016 US dollars.
RESULTS: This study modeled 1000 hypothetical patients with attributes similar 
to those of the FOURIER trial cohort. At the current price, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of statin plus PCSK9i therapy was $337 729 per 
quality-adjusted life-year. Our probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that a 
statin plus PCSK9i strategy had a low probability (<1%) of being cost effective 
at the commonly accepted societal threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year. Furthermore, PCSK9i produced a negative return on investment of 86% 
for private payers. In our threshold analysis, the price of PCSK9i would need to 
drop 62%, to $5459 per year, to reach $100 000 per quality-adjusted life year.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: At current prices, the addition of PCSK9i to statin 
therapy is estimated to provide an additional quality-adjusted life year for 
$337 729 . Significant discounts are necessary to meet conventional 
cost-effectiveness standards.

IMPORTANCE: Telomere length is a marker of biological aging that may provide a 
cellular memory of exposures to oxidative stress and inflammation. Telomere 
length at birth has been related to life expectancy. An association between 
prenatal air pollution exposure and telomere length at birth could provide new 
insights in the environmental influence on molecular longevity.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of prenatal exposure to particulate matter 
(PM) with newborn telomere length as reflected by cord blood and placental 
telomere length.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a prospective birth cohort (ENVIRONAGE 
[Environmental Influence on Ageing in Early Life]), a total of 730 
mother-newborn pairs were recruited in Flanders, Belgium between February 2010 
and December 2014, all with a singleton full-term birth (≥37 weeks of 
gestation). For statistical analysis, participants with full data on both cord 
blood and placental telomere lengths were included, resulting in a final study 
sample size of 641.
EXPOSURES: Maternal residential PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter 
≤2.5 μm) exposure during pregnancy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In the newborns, cord blood and placental tissue 
relative telomere length were measured. Maternal residential PM2.5 exposure 
during pregnancy was estimated using a high-resolution spatial-temporal 
interpolation method. In distributed lag models, both cord blood and placental 
telomere length were associated with average weekly exposures to PM2.5 during 
pregnancy, allowing the identification of critical sensitive exposure windows.
RESULTS: In 641 newborns, cord blood and placental telomere length were 
significantly and inversely associated with PM2.5 exposure during midgestation 
(weeks 12-25 for cord blood and weeks 15-27 for placenta). A 5-µg/m3 increment 
in PM2.5 exposure during the entire pregnancy was associated with 8.8% (95% CI, 
-14.1% to -3.1%) shorter cord blood leukocyte telomeres and 13.2% (95% CI, 
-19.3% to -6.7%) shorter placental telomere length. These associations were 
controlled for date of delivery, gestational age, maternal body mass index, 
maternal age, paternal age, newborn sex, newborn ethnicity, season of delivery, 
parity, maternal smoking status, maternal educational level, pregnancy 
complications, and ambient temperature.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mothers who were exposed to higher levels of PM2.5 
gave birth to newborns with shorter telomere length. The observed telomere loss 
in newborns by prenatal air pollution exposure indicates less buffer for 
postnatal influences of factors decreasing telomere length during life. 
Therefore, improvements in air quality may promote molecular longevity from 
birth onward.

IMPORTANCE: Testing for and treating latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is 
among the main strategies to achieve TB elimination in the United States. The 
best approach to testing among non-US born residents, particularly those with 
comorbid conditions, is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate health outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of LTBI 
testing and treatment among non-US born residents with and without medical 
comorbidities.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Decision analytic tree and Markov cohort 
simulation model among non-US born residents with no comorbidities, with 
diabetes, with HIV infection, or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) using a 
health care sector perspective with 3% annual discounting. Strategies compared 
included no testing, tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon gamma release assay 
(IGRA), confirm positive (initial TST, IGRA only for TST-positive results; both 
tests positive indicates LTBI), and confirm negative (initial IGRA, then TST for 
IGRA-negative; any test positive indicates LTBI). All strategies were coupled to 
treatment with 3 months of self-administered rifapentine and isoniazid.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number needed to test and treat to prevent 1 case of 
TB reactivation, discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), discounted 
lifetime medical costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: Improving health outcomes increased costs, with choice of test 
dependent on willingness to pay. Strategies ranked by ascending costs and 
benefits: no testing, confirm positive, TST, IGRA, and confirm negative. The 
ICERs varied by non-US born patient risk group: patients with no comorbidities, 
IGRA was likely cost-effective at $83 000/QALY; patients with diabetes, both 
confirm positive ($53 000/QALY) and IGRA ($120 000/QALY) were likely 
cost-effective; patients with HIV, confirm negative was clearly preferred 
($63 000/QALY); and patients with ESRD, no testing was cost-effective. Increased 
LTBI prevalence and reduced return for TST reading improved IGRA's relative 
performance. In 10 000 probabilistic simulations among non-US born patients with 
no comorbidities, with diabetes, and with HIV, some form of testing was 
virtually always cost-effective. These simulations highlight the uncertainty of 
test choice for non-US born patients with no comorbidities and non-US born 
patients with diabetes, but strategies including IGRA were preferred in over 60% 
of simulations for all non-US born populations except those with ESRD.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Testing for and treating LTBI among non-US born 
residents with and without selected comorbidities is likely cost-effective 
except among those with ESRD in whom competing risks of death limit benefits. 
Strategies including IGRA fell below a $100 000/QALY willingness-to-pay 
threshold for non-US born patients with no comorbidities, patients with 
diabetes, and patients with HIV.

INTRODUCTION: Primary spinal epidural extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma (EES) is 
extremely rare, with a peak incidence in the second decade of life. EES in old 
people is challenging to treat due to the lack of specific guidelines. In this 
paper, I present a unique case of adult primary cervical epidural EES with a 
13-month follow-up. A short literature review of the therapeutic approaches and 
prognosis is also presented.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: I present a case of a 49-year old male patient who 
presented with right upper limb pain, numbness, hand grip weakness, and 
hyperreflexia of 3 months duration. Enhanced cervical magnetic resonance imaging 
showed a homogenously enhancing epidural and paravertebral soft tissue mass 
extending from the C6 to the T2 that appeared hypointense on T1 and hyperintense 
on T2. The patient underwent biopsy that confirmed EES via histopathology. 
Treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy resulted in tumor resolution and 
symptom relief.
DISCUSSION: EES is a type of PNET. Surgical removal is generally the treatment 
of choice, followed by adjunctive chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In old patients 
with large tumors, a more conservative approach with biopsy, adjuvant 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy is recommended.
CONCLUSIONS: Adult primary cervical epidural EES is a neurosurgical challenge 
due to the extension to the surrounding vital structures making the tumor not 
amenable for total resection as in the present case. In the absence of specific 
therapeutic guidelines, our case highlights the need to individualize the 
treatment modality according to age, tumor extension, and feasibility of total 
tumor resection.

The treatment of seeds with systemic insecticides has become a common practice 
worldwide. However, this prophylactic use of insecticides has been questioned 
recently because of the potential risks to non-target organisms. This study 
assessed the non-target effects of chlorantraniliprole and thiamethoxam seed 
treatments on the life history and walking behavior of Podisus nigrispinus 
(Dallas), as well as the efficacy of these insecticides for controlling 
Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith). Thiamethoxam caused mortality of P. nigrispinus, 
increased the pre-oviposition period, and reduced the oviposition period and the 
fecundity and survival of females compared to chlorantraniliprole. In contrast, 
the life expectancy of P. nigrispinus females was prolonged by 
chlorantraniliprole, which also increased the intrinsic rate of growth (rm) and 
the finite growth rate (λ), and reduced the population doubling time (DT) 
compared to thiamethoxam. The net reproductive rate (R0) and mean generation 
time (T) were not affected by either insecticide treatment, and neither were the 
walking velocity of P. nigrispinus females, nor the distance they covered. Both 
chlorantraniliprole and thiamethoxam reduced soybean leaf consumption by 
S. frugiperda larvae. Given the observed lethal and sublethal effects, soybean 
seed treatments with chlorantraniliprole and thiamethoxam were judged to present 
low and moderate risks for P. nigrispinus, respectively.

TGFβ induced factor homeobox 1 promotes colorectal cancer development through 
activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers, but the mechanisms 
underlying its initiation and progression are largely unknown. TGIF1 (TGFB 
induced factor homeobox 1) is a transcriptional corepressor that belongs to the 
three-amino acid loop extension (TALE) superclass of atypical homeodomains. It 
has been reported that TGIF1 is highly expressed in mammary cancer and non-small 
cell lung cancer and can enhance tumor progression. However, the role of TGIF1 
in colorectal cancer remains unknown. Here, we report that TGIF1 is 
significantly upregulated in colorectal cancers, and its high expression 
predicts poor prognosis. Overexpression of TGIF1 markedly promotes the 
proliferation of colorectal cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, 
TGIF1 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and the homeodomain is indispensable 
for Wnt activation and β-catenin interaction. Taken together, our results 
suggest that TGIF1 is a novel colorectal tumor promoter and indicate that TGIF1 
enhances colorectal cancer tumorigenesis through activating Wnt signaling.

The introduction of BRAF and MEK inhibitors into clinical practice improved the 
prognosis of metastatic melanoma patients. The combination of BRAF inhibitor 
dabrafenib with MEK inhibitor trametinib has shown its superiority to single 
agent therapy and is characterized by a tolerable spectrum of adverse events 
which shows a decrease in incidence over time on treatment. Areas covered: The 
current scientific literature on safety and adverse events (AEs) related to BRAF 
and MEK-inhibition has been investigated with special focus on the large phase 3 
studies (COMBI-v, COMBI-d and CoBRIM) as well as recent updates presented at 
oncology and melanoma meetings. Additionally, published case series/case reports 
were screened for information on AEs. Expert opinion: Even though almost every 
patient (98%) under combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib 
experiences at least one adverse event, these are generally mild to moderate, 
reversible and can be managed with dose reductions or interruptions. However, 
due to an increased life expectancy, there is a substantial need to prevent and 
treat also mild adverse events, as they play a central role for the quality of 
life of patients. Ongoing clinical trials will have to demonstrate the efficacy 
as well as safety of triple combination with anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibodies.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Improved knowledge about factors that influence 
patient choices when considering dialysis modality could facilitate health care 
interventions to increase rates of home dialysis. We aimed to quantify the 
attributes of dialysis care and the tradeoffs that patients consider when making 
decisions about dialysis modalities.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We conducted a prospective, 
discrete choice experiment survey with random parameter logit analysis to 
quantify preferences and tradeoffs for attributes of dialysis treatment in 143 
adult patients with CKD expected to require RRT within 12 months (predialysis). 
The attributes included schedule flexibility, patient out of pocket costs, 
subsidized transport services, level of nursing support, life expectancy, 
dialysis training time, wellbeing on dialysis, and dialysis schedule (frequency 
and duration). We reported outcomes using β-coefficients with corresponding odds 
ratios and 95% confidence intervals for choosing home-based dialysis (peritoneal 
dialysis or hemodialysis) compared with facility hemodialysis.
RESULTS: Home-based therapies were significantly preferred with the following 
attributes: longer survival (odds ratio per year, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 
1.25 to 2.12), increased treatment flexibility (odds ratio, 9.22; 95% confidence 
interval, 2.71 to 31.3), improved wellbeing (odds ratio, 210; 95% confidence 
interval, 15 to 2489), and more nursing support (odds ratio, 87.3; 95% 
confidence interval, 3.8 to 2014). Respondents were willing to accept additional 
out of pocket costs of approximately New Zealand $400 (United States $271) per 
month (95% confidence interval, New Zealand $333 to $465) to receive increased 
nursing support. Patients were willing to accept out of pocket costs of New 
Zealand $223 (United States $151) per month (95% confidence interval, New 
Zealand $195 to $251) for more treatment flexibility.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients preferred home dialysis over facility-based care when 
increased nursing support was available and when longer survival, wellbeing, and 
flexibility were expected. Sociodemographics, such as age, ethnicity, and 
income, influenced patient choice.

Few studies have examined the association between ambient temperature and years 
of life lost (YLL). We aim to explore the burden of cardiovascular disease 
attributed to non-optimum temperature in China. YLL provides a complementary 
measure for examining the burden of disease due to ambient temperature. 
Non-optimal temperature leads to the increase of YLL. The mortality of fourteen 
cities in China during 2008-2013 was included in this study. We used the 
Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM) to estimate the association between 
daily mean temperature and YLL, controlling for long term trends, day of the 
week, seasonality and relative humidity. The daily YLL varied from 807 in 
Changchun to 2751 in Chengdu, with males higher than females. Extreme high and 
low temperatures were associated with higher YLL. The attributable fraction (AF) 
to cold effect is from 2.67 (95%CI: -1.63, 6.70) to 8.55 (95%CI: 5.05, 11.90), 
while the AF to heat effect is from 0.16 (95%CI: 0.06, 0.26) to 2.29 (95%CI: 
1.29, 3.19). Cold effect was significantly higher than heat effect on 
cardiovascular disease in both men and women and for different age groups.

Hemophilia A is a congenital X-linked bleeding disorder caused by coagulation 
factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency. Routine infusion of factor replacement products 
is the current standard of care; however, the development of alloantibodies 
against FVIII remains a challenge. The treatment of hemophilia has undergone 
major advances over the past century to improve safety, effectiveness, 
manufacturing, and convenience of factor products. Major recent advances in the 
treatment of hemophilia A include the emergence of extended half-life products, 
factor VIII orthologs, and gene therapy products. Extended half-life products 
were designed to decrease the frequency of infusions, but only modest half-life 
extension is achieved. Factor VIII orthologs featuring lower cross-reactivity 
with anti-FVIII antibodies may be less susceptible to inactivation by 
inhibitors. Meanwhile, gene therapy may potentially provide a cure for 
hemophilia A, thus abrogating the need for protein-based factor replacement. 
This review aims to discuss current and emerging FVIII replacement products for 
hemophilia A.

Palliative drainage is the primary treatment option for unresectable malignant 
hilar biliary obstruction (UMHBO) to improve the prognosis and quality of life. 
Currently, endoscopic biliary drainage is considered as a first-line treatment 
for UMHBO as well as for distal biliary obstruction. Self-expanding metal stents 
(SEMSs) are preferred over plastic stents (PSs) in patients with life expectancy 
of >3 months. However, endoscopic treatment of UMHBO is often more challenging 
and complex than that of distal biliary obstruction. Although no consensus 
exists on the optimal method for biliary drainage because of the lack of 
well-designed, large-scale randomized control trials, several essential aspects 
of various optimal methods have been studied. Presently, technological 
developments in this field are under way and newly designed or modified stenting 
devices for UMHBO are being developed. In this review, we assess the optimal 
stenting strategy for UMHBO based on the previous literature, focusing on the 
stent type (PS vs SEMS), the liver volume to be drained, unilateral (single) vs 
bilateral (multiple) stent deployment, and bilateral stenting method 
(stent-in-stent vs side-by-side).

Generic preference-based measures (GPBMs) of health are used to obtain the 
quality adjustment weight required to calculate the quality-adjusted life year 
in health economic models. GPBMs have been developed to use across different 
interventions and medical conditions and typically consist of a self-complete 
patient questionnaire, a health state classification system, and preference 
weights for all states defined by the classification system. Of the six main 
GPBMs, the three most frequently used are the Health Utilities Index version 3, 
the EuroQol 5 dimensions (3 and 5 levels), and the Short Form 6 dimensions. 
There are considerable differences in GPBMs in terms of the content and size of 
descriptive systems (i.e. the numbers of dimensions of health and levels of 
severity within these), the methods of valuation [e.g. time trade-off (TTO), 
standard gamble (SG)], and the populations (e.g. general population, patients) 
used to value the health states within the descriptive systems. Although GPBMs 
are anchored at 1 (full health) and 0 (dead), they produce different health 
state utility values when completed by the same patient. Considerations when 
selecting a measure for use in a clinical trial include practicality, 
reliability, validity and responsiveness. Requirements of reimbursement agencies 
may impose additional restrictions on suitable measures for use in economic 
evaluations, such as the valuation technique (TTO, SG) or the source of values 
(general public vs. patients).

A condition-specific preference-based measure (CSPBM) is a measure of 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) that is specific to a certain condition 
or disease and that can be used to obtain the quality adjustment weight of the 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for use in economic models. This article
