IMPORTANCE: Despite recommendations for universal screening, adherence to 
colorectal cancer screening in the US is approximately 60%. Liquid biopsy tests 
are in development for cancer early detection, but it is unclear whether they 
are cost-effective for colorectal cancer screening.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of liquid biopsy for colorectal 
cancer screening in the US.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this economic evaluation, a Markov model 
was developed to compare no screening and 5 colorectal cancer screening 
strategies: colonoscopy, liquid biopsy, liquid biopsy following nonadherence to 
colonoscopy, stool DNA, and fecal immunochemical test. Adherence to first-line 
screening with colonoscopy, stool DNA, or fecal immunochemical test was assumed 
to be 60.6%, and adherence for liquid biopsy was assumed to be 100%. For 
colonoscopy, stool DNA, and fecal immunochemical test, patients who did not 
adhere to testing were not offered other screening. In colonoscopy-liquid biopsy 
hybrid, liquid biopsy was second-line screening for those who deferred 
colonoscopy. Scenario analyses were performed to include the possibility of 
polyp detection for liquid biopsy.
EXPOSURES: No screening, colonoscopy, fecal immunochemical test, stool DNA, 
liquid biopsy, and colonoscopy-liquid biopsy hybrid screening.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Model outcomes included life expectancy, total cost, 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A strategy was considered 
cost-effective if it had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than the 
US willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per life-year gained.
RESULTS: This study used a simulated cohort of patients aged 45 years with 
average risk of colorectal cancer. In the base case, colonoscopy was the 
preferred, or cost-effective, strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $28 071 per life-year gained. Colonoscopy-liquid biopsy hybrid had the 
greatest gain in life-years gained but had an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of $377 538. Colonoscopy-liquid biopsy hybrid had a greater gain in 
life-years if liquid biopsy could detect polyps but remained too costly.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this economic evaluation of liquid biopsy for 
colorectal cancer screening, colonoscopy was a cost-effective strategy for 
colorectal cancer screening in the general population, and the inclusion of 
liquid biopsy as a first- or second-line screening strategy was not 
cost-effective at its current cost and screening performance. Liquid biopsy 
tests for colorectal cancer screening may become cost-effective if their cost is 
substantially lowered.

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of different diabetic retinopathy 
(DR) screening strategies in rural regions in China by using a Markov model to 
make health economic evaluations. In this study, we determined the structure of 
a Markov model according to the research objectives, which required parameters 
collected through field investigation and literature retrieval. After perfecting 
the model with parameters and assumptions, we developed a Markov decision 
analytic model according to the natural history of DR in TreeAge Pro 2011. For 
this model, we performed Markov cohort and cost-effectiveness analyses to 
simulate the probabilistic distributions of different developments in DR and the 
cumulative cost-effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening 
and ophthalmologist screening for DR in the rural population with diabetes 
mellitus (DM) in China. Additionally, a model-based health economic evaluation 
was performed by using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios. Last, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were performed to assess the stability of the results. From the perspective of 
the health system, compared with no screening, AI-based screening cost more (the 
incremental cost was 37,257.76 RMB (approximately 5,211.31 US dollars)), but the 
effect was better (the incremental utility was 0.33). Compared with AI-based 
screening, the cost of ophthalmologist screening was higher (the incremental 
cost was 14,886.76 RMB (approximately 2,070.19 US dollars)), and the effect was 
worse (the incremental utility was -0.31). Compared with no screening, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of AI-based DR screening was 
112,146.99 RMB (15,595.47 US dollars)/QALY, which was less than the threshold 
for the ICER (< 3 times the per capita gross domestic product (GDP), 217,341.00 
RMB (30,224.03 US dollars)). Therefore, AI-based screening was cost-effective, 
which meant that the increased cost for each additional quality-adjusted life 
year was merited. Compared with no screening and ophthalmologist screening for 
DR, AI-based screening was the most cost-effective, which not only saved costs 
but also improved the quality of life of diabetes patients. Popularizing 
AI-based DR screening strategies in rural areas would be economically effective 
and feasible and can provide a scientific basis for the further formulation of 
early screening programs for diabetic retinopathy.

AIM: To determine the association of hand grip strength and knee extensor 
strength with the nutritional status of community-dwelling older adults.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational cross-sectional study. Weight and height of 
847 older adults were analyzed according to body mass index and classified into 
four nutritional categories according to the Chilean Ministry of Health. Hand 
grip and knee extensors strength for both extremities were evaluated. Strength 
was normalized by body mass. Spearman's correlation between body mass index and 
muscle strength was used.
RESULTS: The sample was 582 women, 265 men and an average age of 71.72±7.09. The 
women had a BMI of 30.03±5.48 and the men of 27.64 ± 4.05, the most numerous 
category was normal weight (n = 288) and the lowest low weight (n = 74). Hand 
grip strength presented a higher correlation than knee extensors, specifically, 
right hand grip strength (r: -0.40). The highest correlation and significance 
were presented by the obese category for all strength measurements, with right 
hand grip strength being the highest (r: -0.29).
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the nutritional status of older adults has a 
negative influence on muscle strength. The best association between body mass 
index and muscle strength was the right hand grip. The finding of the increase 
in life expectancy as the nutritional status of the sample decreases stands out. 
Future studies are needed to generate percentiles and normalized values in the 
Chilean population.

BACKGROUND: Calcific aortic stenosis is commonly treated using surgical or 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement; however, many patients are not 
considered suitable candidates for these interventions due to severe 
comorbidities and limited life expectancy. As such, non-invasive therapies might 
offer alternative therapeutic possibilities in these patients. This study aimed 
to assess the safety of non-invasive ultrasound therapy and its ability to 
improve valvular function by softening calcified valve tissue.
METHODS: This prospective, multicentre, single-arm series enrolled 40 adult 
patients with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis at three hospitals in 
France, the Netherlands, and Serbia between March 13, 2019, and May 8, 2022. 
Patients were treated with transthoracically delivered non-invasive ultrasound 
therapy. Follow-ups were scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The primary 
endpoints were procedure-related deaths within 30 days and improved valve 
function. We report the 6-month data. This study is registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03779620 and NCT04665596.
FINDINGS: 40 high-risk patients with a mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 
of 5·6% (SD 4·4) and multiple severe comorbidities were included. The primary 
endpoint, procedure-related mortality, did not occur; furthermore, no 
life-threatening or cerebrovascular events were reported. Improved valve 
function was confirmed up to 6 months, reflected by a 10% increase in mean 
aortic valve area from 0·58 cm2 (SD 0·19) at baseline to 0·64 cm2 (0·21) at 
follow-up (p=0·0088), and a 7% decrease in mean pressure gradient from 41·9 mm 
Hg (20·1) to 38·8 mm Hg (17·8; p=0·024). At 6 months, the New York Heart 
Association score had improved or stabilised in 24 (96%) of 25 patients, and the 
mean Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score had improved by 33%, from 
48·5 (SD 22·6) to 64·5 (21·0). One serious procedure-related adverse event 
occurred in a patient who presented with a transient decrease in peripheral 
oxygen saturation. Non-serious adverse events included pain, discomfort during 
treatment, and transient arrhythmias.
INTERPRETATION: This novel, non-invasive ultrasound therapy for calcified aortic 
stenosis proved to be safe and feasible.

University, Lanzhou 730070, China.

Effects of continuous cropping on rhizosphere soil physical and chemical 
properties, soil microbial activity, and community characteristics of Codonopsis 
pilosula were investigated. The C. pilosula plot(CK) fallow for five years and 
C. pilosula fields with different years of continuous cropping were studied 
using Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology combined with soil physical 
and chemical properties analysis. The response of rhizosphere soil physical and 
chemical properties, microbial activities, and microbial community 
characteristics to continuous cropping years of C. pilosula were investigated. 
The results were as follows:the contents of organic carbon, total phosphorus, 
total nitrogen, and salt in rhizosphere soil of C. pilosula increased with the 
extension of continuous cropping years. However, soil pH value decreased with 
the extension of continuous cropping years. Compared with that in the CK 
treatment, rhizosphere soil organic carbon content of C. pilosula in continuous 
cropping for one, two, three, and four years increased by 11.1%, 80.5%, 74.9%, 
and 78.2%, respectively. Total phosphorus content increased by 11.8%, 52.9%, 
66.7%, and 78.4%, and total nitrogen content increased by 31.3%, 68.8%, 52.1%, 
and 56.3%, respectively. Soil salt content increased significantly under 
continuous cropping of three and four years, and soil conductivity increased by 
54.2% and 84.7% compared with that in the CK treatment, respectively. The C/N 
ratio of microbial biomass in rhizosphere soil exhibited an increasing trend 
with the extension of continuous cropping years. Soil respiration entropy and 
microbial entropy showed a decreasing trend. With the increase in continuous 
cropping years, the diversity and abundance of bacteria in soil decreased, 
whereas the diversity and abundance of fungi increased. In addition, with the 
increase in continuous cropping years, the antagonistic effect between bacterial 
communities was enhanced, whereas the synergistic effect between fungal 
communities was mainly observed. Correlation analysis showed that soil total 
phosphorus, available potassium, carbon to nitrogen ratio of microbial biomass, 
soil respiration entropy, microbial biomass carbon, and electrical conductivity 
were the main factors affecting the changes in soil bacterial community 
characteristics. Soil total nitrogen, available potassium, available phosphorus, 
and soil respiration entropy were the main factors affecting the changes in 
fungal community characteristics. In conclusion, continuous cropping 
significantly changed the physical and chemical properties of soil and microbial 
activity and affected the abundance and diversity of bacteria and fungi in soil. 
This changed the interaction between microorganisms, which disrupted the 
stability of microbial communities in the soil.

OBJECTIVES: The non-oncological population is relatively under-represented among 
end-of-life (EOL) patients managed by palliative care (PC) services, and the 
effects of different PC delivery models are understudied in this population.This 
retrospective observational study on routinely collected data aimed at 
evaluating the effects of the extension from workday-only to 24/7 mixed hands-on 
and advisory home PC service on emergency department (ED) access and emergency 
medical services (EMS) interventions needed by non-oncological patients during 
their last 90 days of life, and their probability to die in hospital.
METHODS: A before-and-after design was adopted comparing preimplementation and 
postimplementation periods (2018-2019 and 2021-22).We used a 
difference-in-differences approach to estimate changes in ED access and EMS 
intervention rates in the postintervention period through binomial negative 
regression. The oncological population, always exposed to 24/7 PC, was used as a 
control. A robust Poisson regression model was adopted to investigate the 
differences regarding hospital mortality. The analyses were adjusted for age, 
sex and disease grouping by the system involved. Results were reported as 
incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and ORs.
RESULTS: A total of 2831 patients were enrolled in the final analysis.After the 
implementation of 24/7 home PC, both ED admissions (IRR=0.390, p<0.001) and EMS 
interventions (IRR=0.413, p<0.001) dropped, as well as the probability to die in 
hospital (OR=0.321, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of a 24/7 mixed hands-on and advisory model of home PC 
could have relevant effects in terms of ED access and EMS use by non-oncological 
EOL patients under PC.

BACKGROUND: Bangladesh has made substantial progress in improving socioeconomic 
and health indicators over the past 50 years, but data on national disease 
burden are scarce. We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 to estimate the burden of diseases and risk 
factors in Bangladesh from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: For this systematic analysis, we analysed data from vital registration 
systems, surveys, and censuses using multistage modelling processes to estimate 
life expectancy at birth, mortality rate, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived 
with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). 
Additionally, we compared the health status of Bangladesh with that of the other 
countries in the GBD south Asia region-Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan.
FINDINGS: Life expectancy at birth in Bangladesh increased from 58·2 years (95% 
uncertainty interval 57·1-59·2) in 1990 to 74·6 years (72·4-76·7) in 2019. 
Between 1990 and 2019, the age-standardised mortality rate decreased from 1509·3 
(1428·6-1592·1) to 714·4 (604·9-838·2) deaths per 100 000 population. In 2019, 
non-communicable diseases represented 14 of the top 20 causes of death; the 
leading three causes were stroke, ischaemic heart disease, and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease. High blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, 
and smoking were the top three risk factors. From 1990 to 2019, the rate of 
all-cause DALYs decreased by 54·9% (48·8-60·4). In 2019, the leading causes of 
DALYs and YLLs were neonatal disorders, stroke, and ischaemic heart disease, 
whereas musculoskeletal disorders, depressive disorders, and low back pain were 
the leading causes of YLDs. Bangladesh has the lowest age-standardised rates of 
mortality, YLDs, and YLLs and the highest life expectancy at birth in south 
Asia.
INTERPRETATION: Over the past 30 years, mortality rates have reduced by more 
than half in Bangladesh. Bangladesh must now address the double burden of 
communicable and non-communicable diseases. Cost-effective, multisectoral 
efforts are needed to prevent and control non-communicable diseases, promote 
healthy lifestyles, and prevent premature mortality and disabilities.

Antibiotics are gradually becoming less effective against bacteria worldwide, 
and this issue is of particular concern in economically-developing nations like 
Pakistan. We undertook a scoping review in order to review the literature on 
antimicrobial use, prescribing, dispensing and the challenges associated with 
antimicrobial resistance in primary care (PC) settings in Pakistan. Furthermore, 
this review aims to identify potential solutions to promote appropriate use of 
antimicrobials in Pakistan. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) 
checklist, a comprehensive scoping review was conducted to review the literature 
of antimicrobials used, prescribed and dispensed in PC settings in Pakistan. 
Google Scholar and Pub-Med were searched for the period 2000-2023. Papers were 
analyzed on the basis of eligibility i.e., included antimicrobial use, 
prescribing and dispensing practices by general population at homes, by 
prescribers in outpatient departments of hospitals and by pharmacists/dispensers 
in community pharmacies, respectively. Two researchers analyzed the articles 
thoroughly and disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third 
reviewer. Both quantitative and qualitative research studies were eligible for 
inclusion. Additionally, the selected papers were grouped into different themes. 
We identified 4070 papers out of which 46 studies satisfied our eligibility 
criteria. The findings revealed limited understanding of antimicrobial 
resistance (AMR) by physicians and community pharmacists along with 
inappropriate practices in prescribing and dispensing antibiotics. Moreover, a 
notable prevalence of self-medication with antibiotics was observed among the 
general population, underscoring a lack of awareness and knowledge concerning 
proper antibiotic usage. Given the clinical and public health implications of 
AMR, Pakistan must prioritize its policies in PC settings. Healthcare 
professionals (HCPs) need to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and 
dispensing, improve their understanding of the AWaRe (access, watch and reserve 
antibiotics) classification and guidance, monitor current usage and resistance 
trends, as well as implement antimicrobial stewardship (ASP) activities starting 
in targeted locations.

In this work, we report on a clinically significant response of meningeal 
carcinomatosis to repotrectinib in a woman with a heavily pretreated 
ROS1-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that harbored the concomitant 
solvent front G2032R mutation. Meningeal carcinomatosis has a higher incidence 
in oncogene addicted NSCLC due to increased life expectancy, yet no report has 
ever documented the activity of repotrectinib in this context. In line with its 
activity, we documented the presence of the drug at potentially active 
concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid. Nevertheless, the short-lived 
response reported by our patient highlights the importance for novel 
ROS1-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to be specifically developed to be able 
to penetrate the blood-brain barrier.

The effects of road pricing on transportation and health equity: A scoping 
review.

Hosford K, Firth C, Brauer M, Winters M.

Road pricing is increasingly considered as an option to support transportation 
infrastructure costs, manage demand, and reduce emissions. However, the extent 
to which implementation of such approaches may impact transportation and health 
equity is unclear. In this scoping review, we examine the differential 
transportation and health effects of road pricing policies across population 
groups and geographic region. We conducted a systematic database search of 
Transport Research International Documentation, GEOBASE, Scopus, and Ovid 
Medline, supplemented by bibliographic review and internet searches. Fifteen 
studies were included in the review. The studies evaluated area and cordon road 
pricing systems in Singapore, London, Stockholm, Milan, and Gothenburg, and had 
a median follow-up period of 12 months. Outcomes evaluated include car 
commuting, mode shift to public transit, accessibility to destinations, 
affordability, welfare, social interactions, air pollution, traffic injuries and 
deaths, acute asthma attacks, and life expectancy. While more studies across 
diverse urban contexts and policy settings will be needed to strengthen the 
evidence base, the existing evidence suggests road pricing has mostly net 
positive effects related to a reduction in car trips, air pollution, asthma 
attacks, and road traffic collisions, and increases in life expectancy. 
Frequency and ease of social interactions were found to be negatively impacted, 
with fewer visits to family and friends. The population groups that generally 
fared better across transportation and health outcomes were those with higher 
incomes, men, and people between the ages of 35-55. Across space, there are 
benefits for both the areas inside and outside the cordon boundary, but to a 
greater degree for the area inside. Overall, the evidence base is limited by a 
narrow set of health-related outcomes and a lack of longer-term studies. We did 
not come across any studies assessing distributional effects of noise pollution, 
mode shifts to walking or cycling, or other morbidities in the general 
population that are not listed above. In addition, there are few evaluations 
that include non-work trips, therefore potentially missing effects for 
unemployed populations or women who are more likely to make non-work trips. We 
find that the limited body of evidence on area and cordon pricing policies 
suggests these policies are beneficial for a number of transportation and health 
outcomes, particularly for populations inside the cordon area, but that there 
may be some degree of inequities in the distribution of the benefits and 
burdens.

Hemangioma of the paranasal sinus is an infrequent condition. Two types of 
hemangioma are present at the nose; cavernous and capillary. Capillary 
hemangioma is rare in the sinonasal tract. Patients presented with massive 
epistaxis should think of nasal hemangioma. Resuscitation of patients is 
important and urgent Computerized Tomography scans should be performed which 
will help character and extension of any mass present at the nasal cavity. 
Initial nasal packing may help to prevent bleeding. We report a case of 
capillary hemangioma of a 30-year lady present with massive epistaxis initially 
controlled by Nasal packing. Her CT scan shows a homogenous mass at left 
maxillary sinuses and underwent left endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation 
and removal of the mass.

Oral and Oropharyngeal cancers are on rise year after year and Head and Neck 
Cancer rank sixth among all cancers worldwide. This study is an institutional 
based retrospective type of study conducted in a tertiary care hospital for a 
period of 6 months with an aim to identify the demographic profile of the 
patients and to correlate between the clinical and radiological findings of the 
disease using Cohen's Kappa value. Both oral and oropharyngeal cancer was 
predominant in male population with commonest age being the 5th decade of life. 
Tongue was the most common site for oral cancer, on the other hand, base of 
tongue was commonest among oropharyngeal cancer. The disease extension was 
thoroughly examined clinically by palpation and 70 degree Hopkins Endoscope and 
also radiologically using appropriate imaging tools. The clinical and 
radiological T showed moderate degree of agreement for both oral and 
oropharyngeal cancers whereas clinical and radiological N showed a almost 
perfect degree of agreement.

Multistate modeling is a commonly used method to compute healthy life 
expectancy. However, there is currently no analytical method to decompose the 
components of differentials in summary measures calculated from multistate 
models. In this research note, we propose a derivative-based method to decompose 
the differentials in population-based health expectancies estimated via a 
multistate model into two main components: the proportion resulting from 
differences in initial health structure and the proportion resulting from 
differences in health transitions. We illustrate the method using data on 
activities of daily living from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study to 
decompose the sex differential in disability-free life expectancy (HLE) among 
older Americans. Our results suggest that the sex gap in HLE results primarily 
from differences in transition rates between disability states rather than from 
the initial health distribution of female and male populations. The methods 
introduced here will enable researchers, including those working in fields other 
than health, to decompose the relative contribution of initial population 
structure and transition probabilities to differences in state-specific life 
expectancies from multistate models.

Bariatric dentistry: implications for coordinated dental education and public 
health policy.

Stefanova Stephens N, Lipschitz W, Psoter J, Psoter W.

Bariatric dentistry is the branch of dental medicine, focused on preventive and 
comprehensive oral health care of overweight or obese patients. Obesity is an 
increasing U.S. and international health problem and is a condition 
characterized by abnormal or excessive fat accumulation in the adipose tissue 
and is categorized by body mass index (BMI) according to the World Health 
Organization (WHO). With the increase of morbid obesity worldwide and the 
unfavorable effect on the overall health and life expectancy it is necessary 
proper accommodations to be made for accessible dental care of this vulnerable 
population of patients. The following case report details the emergency and the 
subsequent elective dental treatment of a patient with a morbid obesity and 
demonstrates the importance of necessary equipment, a multidisciplinary 
approach, and broad networking communication needed to treat bariatric patients. 
Our goal was through this case report to bring awareness and start professional 
discussions on the importance of all dentists in the community and dental 
academic programs working together to assure access for primary oral health for 
bariatric patients.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the 24-month durability 
of pain relief, function, quality of life, and safety outcomes for patients with 
nonsurgical refractory back pain (NSRBP) treated with high-frequency spinal cord 
stimulation (SCS) within a large, national, multicenter randomized controlled 
trial (RCT).
METHODS: Following the completion of an RCT comparing high-frequency SCS plus 
CMM with CMM alone for the treatment of NSRBP, patients gave additional consent 
for a follow-up extension to 24 months. Presented is the cohort analysis of all 
patients treated with high-frequency SCS following the optional crossover at 6 
months. The outcomes assessed to 24 months included responder rate of ≥ 50% pain 
relief measured according to the visual analog scale [VAS]), disability 
(Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]), quality of life (EQ-5D 5-level [EQ-5D-5L]), 
opioid reduction.
RESULTS: Of the 125 patients who received a permanent implant, 121 completed the 
12-month follow-up, 101 gave additional consent for extended follow-up, and 98 
completed the 24-month follow-up. At 24 months after implantation, the mean back 
pain VAS score was reduced by 73% and the responder rate was 82%. ODI and 
EQ-5D-5L both improved by at least double the minimal clinically important 
difference for each measure. No unexpected adverse events were observed, and the 
rates of serious adverse events (3.4%) and device explantations (4.8%) were low.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of high-frequency SCS to CMM in patients with NSRBP 
offers profound improvements at 24 months in pain, function, quality of life, 
and reduced opioid use. This study provides much-needed evidence to inform 
current clinical practice for managing patients with NSRBP.

OBJECTIVES: Equitable distribution of quality healthcare services among 
different subpopulations in China and Nigeria is inconsistent. This necessitates 
an examination of potential avenues for improving healthcare provision in both 
countries. A comparative analysis of both health systems was carried out to 
provide insights into the progress each nation has made, the obstacles they 
face, and areas both countries can learn from each other.
METHODS: We assessed 3 key dimensions of these systems using the Hsiao 
analytical framework. First, we scrutinized the policy levers of the health 
systems. Next, we evaluated intermediate outcomes, such as access to healthcare 
and the quality of care. Lastly, we assessed the extent to which the health 
systems achieve their ultimate goals, including improving citizen health status 
and enhancing overall patient satisfaction with the healthcare services.
RESULTS: China surpasses Nigeria in terms of better birth outcomes, life 
expectancy, and management of communicable diseases. Both countries offer 
minimal protection against out-of-pocket spending on medical bills, which 
consequently exacerbates the poverty rate.
CONCLUSIONS: China surpasses Nigeria in every health metrics. However, Nigeria's 
healthcare system offers services to a larger proportion of its populace because 
of the involvement of the private sector in healthcare delivery. Both countries 
continue to experience significant challenges, such as limited access to 
healthcare services in rural areas and overall patient dissatisfaction with the 
quality of care provided.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly invasive form of lung cancer 
that adversely affects the pleural and other linings of the lungs. MPM is a very 
aggressive tumor that often has an advanced stage at diagnosis and a bad 
prognosis (between 7 and 12 months). When people who have been exposed to 
asbestos experience pleural effusion and pain that is not explained, MPM should 
be suspected. After being diagnosed, most MPM patients have a one- to four-year 
life expectancy. The life expectancy is approximately six months without 
treatment. Despite the plethora of current molecular investigations, a 
definitive universal molecular signature has yet to be discovered as the 
causative factor for the pathogenesis of MPM. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to 
play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression at the 
posttranscriptional level. The association between the expression of these 
short, non-coding RNAs and several neoplasms, including MPM, has been observed. 
Although the incidence of MPM is very low, there has been a significant increase 
in research focused on miRNAs in the past few years. In addition, miRNAs have 
been found to have a role in various regulatory signaling pathways associated 
with MPM, such as the Notch signaling network, Wnt/β-catenin, mutation of KRAS, 
JAK/STAT signaling circuit, protein kinase B (AKT), and Hedgehog signaling 
pathway. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the existing 
understanding of the roles of miRNAs in the underlying mechanisms of pathogenic 
symptoms in MPM, highlighting their potential as viable targets for therapeutic 
interventions.
