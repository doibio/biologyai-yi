per-enrollee costs that are similar to the cost of the vaccine itself 
($11.78-$36.08/dose). Based on limited available evidence in general 
populations, quality improvement interventions may be cost saving to cost 
effective for the health system.

The radiation detriment in ICRP 103 is defined as the product of the 
organ-specific risk coefficient and the damage that may be associated with a 
cancer type or hereditary effect. This is used to indicate a weighted risk 
according to the radiation sensitivity of different organs and the severity of 
damage that may possibly arise. While the risk refers to radiation exposure 
parameters, the extent of damage is independent of radiation. The parameters 
that are not affected by radiation are lethality, impairment of quality of life, 
and reduced life expectancy, which are considered as quantities associated with 
the severity of disease or damage. The damage and thus the detriment appear to 
be mostly affected by lethality, which is the quotient of the age-standardized 
mortality rate to the incidence rate. The analysis of the detriment presented in 
this paper focuses on the influence of the lethality on the detriment from 1980 
to 2012 in the USA and Germany. While the lethality in this period covering more 
than three decades has decreased approximately linearly by 30% (both USA and 
Germany), within the same period the detriment declined only by 13% in the USA 
and by 15% in Germany. If only based on these two countries, an update on the 
detriment parameters with reference to 2007, when ICRP 103 was released, would 
result in a reduced weighted risk, i.e. the radiation detriment would be reduced 
by 10 to 15% from originally 5.7% per Sv for the whole population to roughly 5% 
per Sv.

OBJECTIVE: Total knee replacement (TKR) is an effective treatment for end-stage 
knee osteoarthritis (OA). American racial minorities undergo fewer TKRs than 
whites. We estimated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost for African 
American knee OA patients due to differences in TKR offer, acceptance, and 
complication rates.
METHODS: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy Model, a computer simulation of knee 
OA, to predict QALY outcomes for African American and white knee OA patients 
with and without TKR. We estimated per-person QALYs gained from TKR as the 
difference between QALYs with current TKR use and QALYs when no TKR was 
performed. We estimated average, per-person QALY losses in African Americans as 
the difference between QALYs gained with white rates of TKR and QALYs gained 
with African American rates of TKR. We calculated population-level QALY losses 
by multiplying per-person QALY losses by the number of persons with advanced 
knee OA. Finally, we estimated QALYs lost specifically due to lower TKR offer 
and acceptance rates and higher rates of complications among African American 
knee OA patients.
RESULTS: African American men and women gain 64,100 QALYs from current TKR use. 
With white offer and complications rates, they would gain an additional 72,000 
QALYs. Because these additional gains are unrealized, we call this a loss of 
72,000 QALYs. African Americans lose 67,500 QALYs because of lower offer rates, 
15,800 QALYs because of lower acceptance rates, and 2,600 QALYs because of 
higher complication rates.
CONCLUSION: African Americans lose 72,000 QALYs due to disparities in TKR offer 
and complication rates. Programs to decrease disparities in TKR use are urgently 
needed.

Exercise programmes to prevent falls among older adults: modelling health gain, 
cost-utility and equity impacts.

(BODE3), Department of Public Health, University of Otago, Wellington, New 
Zealand.

BACKGROUND: Some falls prevention interventions for the older population appear 
cost-effective, but there is uncertainty about others. Therefore, we aimed to 
model three types of exercise programme each running for 25 years among 65+ year 
olds: (i) a peer-led group-based one; (ii) a home-based one and (iii) a 
commercial one.
METHODS: An established Markov model for studying falls prevention in New 
Zealand (NZ) was adapted to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) in cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Detailed NZ 
experimental, epidemiological and cost data were used for the base year 2011. A 
health system perspective was taken and a discount rate of 3% applied. 
Intervention effectiveness estimates came from a Cochrane Review.
RESULTS: The intervention generating the greatest health gain and costing the 
least was the home-based exercise programme intervention. Lifetime health gains 
were estimated at 47 100 QALYs (95%uncertainty interval (UI) 22 300 to 74 400). 
Cost-effectiveness was high (ICER: US$4640 per QALY gained; (95% UI US$996 to 
10 500)), and probably more so than a home safety assessment and modification 
intervention using the same basic model (ICER: US$6060). The peer-led 
group-based exercise programme was estimated to generate 42 000 QALYs with an 
ICER of US$9490. The commercially provided group programme was more expensive 
and less cost-effective (ICER: US$34 500). Further analyses by sex, age group 
and ethnicity (Indigenous Māori and non-Māori) for the peer-led 
group-intervention showed similar health gains and cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementing any of these three types of exercise programme for 
falls prevention in older people could produce considerable health gain, but 
with the home-based version being likely to be the most cost-effective.

The investment case for folic acid fortification in developing countries.

Economics and Management, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.

There is compelling evidence that neural tube defects can be prevented through 
mandatory folic acid fortification. Why, then, is an investment case needed? At 
the core of the answer to this question is the notion that governments and 
individuals have limited resources for which there are many competing claims. An 
investment case compares the costs and benefits of folic acid fortification 
relative to alternative life-saving investments and informs estimates of the 
financing required for implementation. Our best estimate is that the cost per 
death averted through mandatory folic acid fortification is $957 and the cost 
per disability-adjusted life year is $14.90. Both compare favorably to 
recommended life-saving interventions, such as the rotavirus vaccine and 
insecticide-treated bed nets. Thus, there is a strong economic argument for 
mandatory folic acid fortification. Further improvements to these estimates will 
require better data on the costs of implementing fortification and on the costs 
of improving compliance where regulations are already in place.

The goal of the aging field is to develop novel therapeutic interventions that 
extend human health span and reduce the burden of age-related disease. While 
organismal aging is a complex, multifactorial process, a popular theory is that 
cellular aging is a significant contributor to the progressive decline inherent 
to all multicellular organisms. To explore the molecular determinants that drive 
cellular aging, as well as how to retard them, researchers have utilized the 
highly genetically tractable budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Indeed, 
every intervention known to extend both cellular and organismal health span was 
identified in yeast, underlining the power of this approach. Importantly, a 
growing body of work has implicated the process of autophagy as playing a 
critical role in the delay of aging. This review summarizes recent reports that 
have identified a role for autophagy, or autophagy factors in the extension of 
yeast life span. These studies demonstrate (1) that yeast remains an invaluable 
tool for the identification and characterization of conserved mechanisms that 
promote cellular longevity and are likely to be relevant to humans, and (2) that 
the process of autophagy has been implicated in nearly all known 
longevity-promoting manipulations and thus represents an ideal target for 
interventions aimed at improving human health span.

to a surgical assessment unit.

Background Increases in life expectancy has meant that a higher proportion of 
patients presenting to surgical assessment units are now elderly. Abdominal 
computed tomography (CT) can provide early and accurate diagnosis in the 
elderly, even in the presence of incomplete clinical and biological findings. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the use of early CT imaging in elderly 
patients presenting directly to the surgical assessment unit. Materials and 
methods All consecutive patients aged 65 years and over admitted directly to the 
surgical assessment unit between January 2017 and April 2017 were identified. 
Data were collected on demographics, laboratory investigations, radiological 
investigations and hospital admission. The primary outcome measure was overall 
length of stay. Results A total of 200 consecutive patients were identified and 
included over a six-month period. This comprised 110 women and 90 men with a 
median age of 78 years (range 64-98 years). A total of 83 patients underwent CT 
on admission to the surgical assessment unit. White cell count (WCC) and 
C-reactive protein (CRP) results were significantly higher in patients 
undergoing CT (P = 0.001). Median length of stay for patients undergoing CT was 
5 days (range 1-19 days). This was significantly lower than those patients not 
receiving CT imaging, at 6 days (range 1-105 days; P = 0.034). Discussion CT 
should be considered as a first-line investigation when elderly patients with an 
acute abdomen are admitted to surgical assessment units. Early CT can accelerate 
hospital discharge and decrease overall length of hospital stay.

SwarmSight: Real-time Tracking of Insect Antenna Movements and Proboscis 
Extension Reflex Using a Common Preparation and Conventional Hardware.

Many scientifically and agriculturally important insects use antennae to detect 
the presence of volatile chemical compounds and extend their proboscis during 
feeding. The ability to rapidly obtain high-resolution measurements of natural 
antenna and proboscis movements and assess how they change in response to 
chemical, developmental, and genetic manipulations can aid the understanding of 
insect behavior. By extending our previous work on assessing aggregate insect 
swarm or animal group movements from natural and laboratory videos using the 
video analysis software SwarmSight, we developed a novel, free, and open-source 
software module, SwarmSight Appendage Tracking (SwarmSight.org) for 
frame-by-frame tracking of insect antenna and proboscis positions from 
conventional web camera videos using conventional computers. The software 
processes frames about 120 times faster than humans, performs at better than 
human accuracy, and, using 30 frames per second (fps) videos, can capture 
antennal dynamics up to 15 Hz. The software was used to track the antennal 
response of honey bees to two odors and found significant mean antennal 
retractions away from the odor source about 1 s after odor presentation. We 
observed antenna position density heat map cluster formation and cluster and 
mean angle dependence on odor concentration.

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin may be used to augment 
therapy with oral glycemic medications or as insulin replacement therapy. The 
American Diabetes Association suggests the use of long-acting (basal) insulin to 
augment therapy with one or two oral agents or one oral agent plus a 
glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist when the A1C level is 9% or more, 
especially if the patient has symptoms of hyperglycemia or catabolism. Insulin 
regimens should be adjusted every three or four days until targets of 
self-monitored blood glucose levels are reached. A fasting and premeal blood 
glucose goal of 80 to 130 mg per dL and a two-hour postprandial goal of less 
than 180 mg per dL are recommended. Insulin use is associated with hypoglycemia 
and weight gain. Insulin analogues are as effective as human insulin at lowering 
A1C levels with lower risk of hypoglycemia, but they have significantly higher 
cost. Patients with one or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia (i.e., requiring 
assistance from others for treatment) may benefit from a short-term relaxation 
of glycemic targets. Several new insulin formulations have been approved 
recently that are associated with less risk of hypoglycemia compared with older 
formulations. The goals of therapy should be individualized based on many 
factors, including age, life expectancy, comorbid conditions, duration of 
diabetes, risk of hypoglycemia, cost, patient motivation, and quality of life.

OBJECTIVES: We previously found large variations in general practitioner (GP) 
hypertension treatment probability in oldest-old (>80 years) between countries. 
We wanted to explore whether differences in country-specific cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) burden and life expectancy could explain the differences.
DESIGN: This is a survey study using case-vignettes of oldest-old patients with 
different comorbidities and blood pressure levels. An ecological multilevel 
model analysis was performed.
SETTING: GP respondents from European General Practice Research Network (EGPRN) 
countries, Brazil and New Zeeland.
SUBJECTS: This study included 2543 GPs from 29 countries.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: GP treatment probability to start or not start 
antihypertensive treatment based on responses to case-vignettes; either low 
(<50% started treatment) or high (≥50% started treatment). CVD burden is defined 
as ratio of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to ischemic heart 
disease and/or stroke and total DALYs lost per country; life expectancy at age 
60 and prevalence of oldest-old per country.
RESULTS: Of 1947 GPs (76%) responding to all vignettes, 787 (40%) scored high 
treatment probability and 1160 (60%) scored low. GPs in high CVD burden 
countries had higher odds of treatment probability (OR 3.70; 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 3.00-4.57); in countries with low life expectancy at 60, CVD was 
associated with high treatment probability (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.12-4.25); but not 
in countries with high life expectancy (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.56-1.98).
CONCLUSIONS: GPs' choice to treat/not treat hypertension in oldest-old was 
explained by differences in country-specific health characteristics. GPs in 
countries with high CVD burden and low life expectancy at age 60 were most 
likely to treat hypertension in oldest-old. Key Points  • General practitioners 
(GPs) are in a clinical dilemma when deciding whether (or not) to treat 
hypertension in the oldest-old (>80 years of age).  • In this study including 
1947 GPs from 29 countries, we found that a high country-specific cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) burden (i.e. myocardial infarction and/or stroke) was associated 
with a higher GP treatment probability in patients aged >80 years.  • However, 
the association was modified by country-specific life expectancy at age 60. 
While there was a positive association for GPs in countries with a low life 
expectancy at age 60, there was no association in countries with a high life 
expectancy at age 60.  • These findings help explaining some of the large 
variation seen in the decision as to whether or not to treat hypertension in the 
oldest-old.

Zebrafish pou5f3 (previously named pou2), a close homologue of mouse Oct4, 
encodes a PouV-family transcription factor. pou5f3 has been implicated in 
diverse aspects of developmental regulation during embryogenesis. In the present 
study, we addressed the molecular function of Pou5f3 as a transcriptional 
regulator and the mechanism by which pou5f3 expression is transcriptionally 
regulated. We examined the influence of effector genes on the expression of the 
luciferase gene under the control of the upstream 2.1-kb regulatory DNA of 
pou5f3 (Luc-2.2) in HEK293T and P19 cells. We first confirmed that Pou5f3 
functions as a transcriptional activator both in cultured cells and embryos, 
which confirmed autoregulation of pou5f3 in embryos. It was further shown that 
Luc-2.2 was activated synergistically by pou5f3 and sox3, which is similar to 
the co-operative activity of Oct4 and Sox2 in mice, although synergy between 
pou5f3 and sox2 was less obvious in this zebrafish system. The effects of pou5f3 
deletion constructs on the regulation of Luc-2.2 expression revealed different 
roles for the three subregions of the N-terminal region in Pou5f3 in terms of 
its regulatory functions and co-operativity with Sox3. Electrophoretic mobility 
shift assays confirmed that Pou5f3 and Sox3 proteins specifically bind to 
adjacent sites in the 2.1-kb DNA and that there is an interaction between the 
two proteins. The synergy with sox3 was unique to pou5f3-the other POU factor 
genes examined did not show such synergy in Luc-2.2 regulation. Finally, 
functional interaction was observed between pou5f3 and sox3 in embryos in terms 
of the regulation of dorsoventral patterning and convergent extension movement. 
These findings together demonstrate co-operative functions of pou5f3 and sox3, 
which are frequently coexpressed in early embryos, in the regulation of early 
development.

BACKGROUND: The addition of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to statin therapy has 
been shown to reduce cardiovascular events. This study examined the 
cost-effectiveness of EPA plus statin (EPA+statin) combination therapy compared 
with statin monotherapy for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) in Japan.Methods and Results:A Markov model was applied to assess 
the costs and benefits associated with EPA+statin combination therapy over a 
projected 30-year period from the perspective of a public healthcare funder in 
Japan. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), was estimated for primary prevention and 
secondary prevention of CVD in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Impact on 
survival and number of events were based on the Japan EPA Lipid Intervention 
Study. Sensitivity analyses examined the influence of various input parameters 
on costs and outcomes of treatment. ICER was ¥29.6 million per QALY gained in 
primary prevention and ¥5.5 million per QALY gained in secondary prevention. The 
probabilities that EPA+statin combination therapy would be cost-effective 
compared with statin monotherapy were 39% in primary prevention and 49% in 
secondary prevention at a cost-effectiveness threshold of ¥5 million per QALY 
gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that EPA was cost-effective in secondary 
prevention.
CONCLUSIONS: EPA+statin combination therapy showed acceptable cost-effectiveness 
for secondary prevention, but not primary prevention, of CVD in patients with 
hypercholesterolemia in Japan.

Entry of enveloped viruses relies on insertion of hydrophobic residues of the 
viral fusion protein into the host cell membrane. However, the intermediate 
conformations during fusion remain unknown. Here, we address the fusion 
mechanism of Rift Valley fever virus. We determine the crystal structure of 
the Gn glycoprotein and fit it with the Gc fusion protein into cryo-electron 
microscopy reconstructions of the virion. Our analysis reveals how the Gn 
shields the hydrophobic fusion loops of the Gc, preventing premature fusion. 
Electron cryotomography of virions interacting with membranes under acidic 
conditions reveals how the fusogenic Gc is activated upon removal of the Gn 
shield. Repositioning of the Gn allows extension of Gc and insertion of fusion 
loops in the outer leaflet of the target membrane. These data show early 
structural transitions that enveloped viruses undergo during host cell entry and 
indicate that analogous shielding mechanisms are utilized across diverse virus 
families.

Social Determinants of Health in the United States: Addressing Major Health 
Inequality Trends for the Nation, 1935-2016.

USA.

OBJECTIVES: This study describes key population health concepts and examines 
major empirical trends in US health and healthcare inequalities from 1935 to 
2016 according to important social determinants such as race/ethnicity, 
education, income, poverty, area deprivation, unemployment, housing, rural-urban 
residence, and geographic location.
METHODS: Long-term trend data from the National Vital Statistics System, 
National Health Interview Survey, National Survey of Children's Health, American 
Community Survey, and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used to 
examine racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, rural-urban, and geographic inequalities 
in health and health care. Life tables, age-adjusted rates, prevalence, and risk 
ratios were used to examine health differentials, which were tested for 
statistical significance at the 0.05 level.
RESULTS: Life expectancy of Americans increased from 69.7 years in 1950 to 78.8 
years in 2015. However, despite the overall improvement, substantial gender and 
racial/ethnic disparities remained. In 2015, life expectancy was highest for 
Asian/Pacific Islanders (87.7 years) and lowest for African-Americans (75.7 
years). Life expectancy was lower in rural areas and varied from 74.5 years for 
men in rural areas to 82.4 years for women in large metro areas, with 
rural-urban disparities increasing during the 1990-2014 time period. Infant 
mortality rates declined dramatically during the past eight decades. However, 
racial disparities widened over time; in 2015, black infants had 2.3 times 
higher mortality than white infants (11.4 vs. 4.9 per 1,000 live births). Infant 
and child mortality was markedly higher in rural areas and poor communities. 
Black infants and children in poor, rural communities had nearly three times 
higher mortality rate compared to those in affluent, rural areas. Racial/ethnic, 
socioeconomic, and geographic disparities were particularly marked in mortality 
and/or morbidity from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, COPD, HIV/AIDS, 
homicide, psychological distress, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and access to 
quality health care.
CONCLUSIONS AND GLOBAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: Despite the overall health 
improvement, significant social disparities remain in a number of health 
indicators, most notably in life expectancy and infant mortality. Marked 
disparities in various health outcomes indicate the underlying significance of 
social determinants in disease prevention and health promotion and necessitate 
systematic and continued monitoring of health inequalities according to social 
factors. A multi-sectoral approach is needed to tackle persistent and widening 
health inequalities among Americans.

Research on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and 
other types of dementia describes a behaviour called 'wandering', a term that 
denotes movement through space lacking intention or exact destination, as when a 
person is disoriented or not self-aware. In the U.S., 'wandering' in both ASD 
and AD has been examined mostly from a management and prevention perspective. It 
prioritizes safety while primarily overlooking personal experiences of those who 
'wander' and their families, thus limiting the range of potentially effective 
strategies to address this issue. Communicative challenges faced by many people 
diagnosed with ASD and AD further obscure the experiential, existential aspects 
of 'wandering'. This article reflects an increasing concern of social science 
scholars interested in whether and how the conceptual and practical strategies 
to address 'wandering' are informed by the situated experiences of people with 
cognitive and developmental disabilities and their families. We examine 
'wandering' at the intersections of personal experience, family life, clinical 
practice, public health policy, and legislation, as a conceptually rich site 
where notions of personhood, subjectivity, intentionality, and quality of life 
powerfully and consequentially converge to impact the lives of many people with 
ASD and AD, and their families. We draw upon critical autism studies describing 
how attributions of personhood, subjectivity, intentionality, rational agency, 
and moral autonomy of people with ASD have been contingent upon the norms and 
conventions governing movement of the human body through space (Hilton, Afr Am 
Rev 50(2):221-235, 2017). When this movement is deemed aberrant, the person may 
be construed as irrational, a danger to self because of a lack of 
self-awareness, and a danger to others because of a lack of empathy. These 
attributions put the person at risk of being excluded from the considerations 
and, more importantly, the obligations of the 'moral community' to ensure that 
he or she has a 'good human life' (Barnbaum, The Ethics of Autism: Among Them 
but not of Them. Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 2008; Silvers and 
Francis, Metaphilosophy 40(3/4):475-498, 2009). Using ethnographic, narrative 
phenomenological (Mattingly, The Paradox of Hope: Journeys through a Clinical 
Borderland. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2010), and medical 
humanities (Charon, JAMA 286:1897-1902, 2001; Narrative Medicine: Honoring the 
Stories of Illness. New York: Oxford University Press, 2006) approaches, we 
examine multiple perspectives on 'wandering' in ASD and AD across narrative 
discourse genres, institutional contexts, and media of representation. We argue 
for an extension of the prevention and management view to focus not only on 
safety but also on what phenomenologist Merleau-Ponty (1962) called "having a 
world" (p. 146). The analysis is intended to inform clinical practice, policy 
and public health efforts to enhance understanding of first and second person 
perspectives on 'wandering' in order to improve the participation and quality of 
life of people with ASD and AD who 'wander', and their families.

OBJECTIVE: To report on medical schools in fragile states, countries with severe 
development challenges, and the impact on the workforce for health care 
delivery.
DATA SOURCES: 2007 and 2012 World Bank Harmonized List of Fragile Situations; 
1998-2012 WHO Global Health Observatory; 2014 World Directory of Medical 
Schools.
DATA EXTRACTION: Fragile classification established from 2007 and 2012 World 
Bank status. Population, gross national income, health expenditure, and life 
expectancy were 2007 figures. Physician density was most recently available from 
WHO Global Health Observatory (1998-2012), with number of medical schools from 
2014 World Directory of Medical Schools.
STUDY DESIGN: Regression analyses assessed impact of fragile state status in 
2012 on the number of medical schools in 2014.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Fragile states were 1.76 (95 percent CI 1.07-2.45) to 2.37 
(95 percent CI 1.44-3.30) times more likely to have fewer than two medical 
schools than nonfragile states.
CONCLUSIONS: Fragile states lack the infrastructure to train sufficient numbers 
of medical professionals to meet their population health needs.

BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a specific form of chronic, 
progressive, fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause. To date, there 
is no specific cure for IPF, and only two treatments (pirfenidone and 
nintedanib) have marketing authorizations and recommendations in international 
and French guidelines.
OBJECTIVES: A cost-utility analysis (CUA) has been conducted to evaluate the 
efficiency of nintedanib, in comparison to all available alternatives, in a 
French setting using the official methodological guidelines.
METHODS: A previously developed lifetime Markov model was adapted to the French 
setting by simulating the progression of IPF patients in terms of lung function 
decline, incidence of acute exacerbations, and death. Considering the effect of 
IPF on patients' quality-of-life, a CUA integrating quality adjusted life years 
(QALY) was chosen as the primary outcome measure in the main analysis. One-way, 
probabilistic, and scenario sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the 
robustness of the model.
RESULTS: Treatment with nintedanib resulted in an estimated total cost of 
€76,414 (vs €82,665 for pirfenidone). In comparison with all other available 
options, nintedanib was predicted to provide the most QALY gained (3.34 vs 
3.29). This analysis suggests that nintedanib has a 59.0% chance of being more 
effective than pirfenidone and s 77.3% chance of being cheaper than pirfenidone. 
Sensitivity analyses showed the results of the CUA to be robust.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this CUA has found that nintedanib appears to be a 
more cost-effective therapeutic option than pirfenidone in a French setting, due 
to fewer acute exacerbations and a better tolerability profile.

Tropical Medicine, London, UK.

OBJECTIVES: We aim to characterize the future noncommunicable disease (NCD) 
burden in Zimbabwe to identify future health system priorities.
METHODS: We developed an individual-based multidisease model for Zimbabwe, 
simulating births, deaths, infection with HIV and progression and key NCD 
[asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD), depression, diabetes, hypertension, 
stroke, breast, cervical, colorectal, liver, oesophageal, prostate and all other 
cancers]. The model was parameterized using national and regional surveillance 
and epidemiological data. Demographic and NCD burden projections were generated 
for 2015 to 2035.
RESULTS: The model predicts that mean age of PLHIV will increase from 31 to 45 
years between 2015 and 2035 (compared with 20-26 in uninfected individuals). 
Consequently, the proportion suffering from at least one key NCD in 2035 will 
increase by 26% in PLHIV and 6% in uninfected. Adult PLHIV will be twice as 
likely to suffer from at least one key NCD in 2035 compared with uninfected 
adults; with 15.2% of all key NCDs diagnosed in adult PLHIV, whereas 
contributing only 5% of the Zimbabwean population. The most prevalent NCDs will 
be hypertension, CKD, depression and cancers. This demographic and disease shift 
in PLHIV is mainly because of reductions in incidence and the success of ART 
scale-up leading to longer life expectancy, and to a lesser extent, the 
cumulative exposure to HIV and ART.
CONCLUSION: NCD services will need to be expanded in Zimbabwe. They will need to 
be integrated into HIV care programmes, although the growing NCD burden amongst 
uninfected individuals presenting opportunities for additional services 
developed within HIV care to benefit HIV-negative persons.

China.

RATIONALE: Intrathecal therapy, with a low complication rate, has become an 
alternative to standard pain management for treatment of neuropathic cancer 
pain.
PATIENT CONCERNS: Here, we reported a late-stage cancer patient with intractable 
neuropathic pain in his right neck, shoulder, and upper limb.
DIAGNOSES: The pain started 2 years ago when the patient was diagnosed as 
squamous cell carcinoma with metastasis to right supraclavicular lymph nodes.
INTERVENTIONS: Cervical intrathecal infusion of morphine and bupivacaine with 
patient control analgesia by external pump was performed. The intrathecal 
catheter was located at the level of C6 vertebra. The initial concentration of 
bupivacaine and morphine were both 1 mg/mL with infusion rate of 0.3 mL/h and 
bolus of 0.3 mL. Subsequently, the concentrations increased to 2 mg/mL 
(bupivacaine) and 1.33 mg/mL (morphine), with infusion rate to 0.6 mL/h and 
bolus to 0.5 ml.
OUTCOMES: The pain intensity decreased from numerical rating scale 6 to 7 to 2 
to 3 at rest, and from 10 to 5 to 6 of breakthrough pain.
LESSONS: In conclusion, cervical intrathecal infusion requires low concentration 
but high doses of bupivacaine and morphine, which is safe and effective in 
cancer patients with refractory pain and short life expectancy.

Compared with people in other developed countries, Americans live shorter lives, 
have more disease and disability, and lag on most population health measures. 
Recent research suggests that this poor comparative performance is primarily 
driven by profound local place-based disparities. Several initiatives 
successfully used sub-county life expectancy estimates to identify geographic 
disparities, generate widespread interest, and catalyze multisector actions. To 
explore the feasibility of scaling these efforts, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists 
initiated a multiphase project - the Sub-County Assessment of Life Expectancy. 
Phase I participants reviewed the literature, assessed and identified 
appropriate tools, calculated locally relevant estimates, and developed 
methodological guidance. Phase I results suggest that most state and local 
health departments will be able to calculate actionable sub-county life 
expectancy estimates despite varying resources, expertise, and population sizes, 
densities, and geographies. To accelerate widespread scaling, we describe 
several successful case examples, identify user-friendly validated tools, and 
provide practical tips that resulted from lessons learned.

Traditional Japanese dietary culture might be a factor contributing to the high 
life expectancy in Japan. As little is known about what constitutes traditional 
and modern eating in Japan, the aims of the current study were to (1) 
comprehensively compile and systematize the various facets of traditional and 
modern eating; and (2) investigate whether these facets also apply to 
traditional and modern eating in Japan. In Study 1, an extensive international 
literature review was performed. Forty-five facets of traditional and modern 
eating were compiled and systematized into the dimensions of what and how people 
eat, and into eleven separate subdimensions. In Study 2, 340 adults from Japan 
answered a questionnaire. Results showed that traditional and modern eating in 
Japan is reflected in both what and how people eat. Within these two dimensions, 
ten subdimensions were found: the ingredients, processing, temporal origin, 
spatial origin, and variety of consumed foods, as well as temporal, spatial, and 
social aspects, appreciation, and concerns when eating. This study provides a 
broad compilation of facets of traditional and modern eating in Japan. Future 
research should investigate how these facets are related to life expectancy and 
health.
