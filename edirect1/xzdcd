OBJECTIVE: How disability manifests itself in an individual is a highly complex 
process influenced by a wide range of individual and environmental factors. Its 
complexity makes the search for generalizable characteristics of the disablement 
process a challenging task. Consequentially, little is known about how the 
effect on other health outcomes such as life expectancy are modified after the 
onset of chronic ailments. In this paper we posit an alternative approach to 
generalize health trajectories of older people with disability and then analyze 
how socioeconomic conditions affect the longevity within these trajectory 
groups.
METHODS: Individual level information about the first three successive onsets of 
chronic disability after age 50 is transformed into state-sequences. We extract 
trajectory groups based on onset time and the time spent in a certain state. 
Mortality hazards are then estimated with a Gompertz proportional hazards model 
to compare effects of different socioeconomic measures within the trajectory 
groups.
RESULTS: Three distinct trajectory groups are identified, the mild (1), the 
early severe (2), and late severe (3) pathway. Estimates of the mortality 
analysis suggest that social inequalities in longevity are less pronounced after 
onset of old-age disability. We found a consistent survival prolonging effect 
for individuals who engage in daily activities (such as meeting with friends, 
walking) that ranged between 33.2% and 77.3%. The importance of other variables 
varies between trajectory groups.
DISCUSSION: This study shows how health trajectories of individuals with 
disability can be generalized when information on the onset and severity of 
single conditions is available. Such an approach may help us to better predict 
health and care expenditures and help families and individuals with their 
personal care planning. The findings from the subsequent survival analysis 
suggest a substantial reduction of socioeconomic mortality differences after 
onset of old-age disability, which appears to be independent of its nature.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are the fastest growing population requiring renal 
replacement therapy. As previous studies have shown a survival benefit of kidney 
transplantation compared to dialysis for end-stage renal disease, we sought to 
evaluate if this survival benefit extends to octogenarians.
METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of renal allograft 
recipients ≥80 years transplanted from 1999 to 2014 who were compared to 
patients listed during the same period that did not proceed to transplantation. 
A secondary matched group was selected from the UNOS transplant waitlist 
database. The primary outcome was patient survival. Secondary outcomes included 
graft survival and rejection incidence.
RESULTS: Thirty-three transplanted patients were compared to 71 patients 
waitlisted at our center and 66 patients from the UNOS database. Patients in the 
study group were transplanted 20.8 ± 16.1 months after listing. Patient survival 
was 87.8% at 6 months and 1 year and 71.4% at 3 years. Kidney transplantation 
was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of death after listing 
(HR: 0.22, CI: 0.11-0.45, P < .001).
CONCLUSION: With escalating life expectancy, kidney transplantation is a 
suitable treatment option in eligible octogenarians.

Policies to extend working lives often do not take into account potentially 
important health inequalities arising from differences in occupational 
exposures. Little is known about which occupational exposures are associated 
with these inequalities. This study aims to examine differences in life 
expectancy without and with disability by occupational exposures. Longitudinal 
data (1992-2016) on disability and physical and psychosocial work demands and 
resources of 2513 (former) workers aged ≥55 years participating in the 
Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam were used. Gender specific life expectancies 
without and with disability by occupational exposures were calculated using 
multistate survival models. Women aged 55 years with high physical work demands 
had a lower life expectancy without disability than those with low exposure 
(1.02-1.57 years), whereas there was no difference for men. Men and women with 
high psychosocial work demands and resources had a longer life expectancy 
without disability than those with low exposure (1.19-2.14 years). Life 
expectancy with disability did not significantly differ across occupational 
exposures. Workers with higher psychosocial demands and resources and lower 
physical demands can expect to live more disability-free years. Information on 
occupational exposure helps to identify workers at risk for lower life 
expectancy, especially without disability, who may need specific support 
regarding their work environment.

The NLRP3 inflammasome is a vital part of the innate immune response, whilst its 
aberrant activation drives the progression of a number of non-communicable 
diseases. Thus, NLRP3 inflammasome assembly must be tightly controlled at 
several checkpoints. The priming step of NLRP3 inflammasome activation is 
associated with increased NLRP3 gene expression, as well as post-translational 
modifications that control NLRP3 levels and licence the NLRP3 protein for 
inflammasome assembly. Increasing life expectancy in modern society is 
accompanied by a growing percentage of elderly individuals. The process of aging 
is associated with chronic inflammation that drives and/or worsens a range of 
age related non-communicable conditions. The NLRP3 inflammasome is known to 
contribute to pathological inflammation in many settings, but the mechanisms 
that prime NLRP3 for activation throughout aging and related co-morbidities have 
not been extensively reviewed. Here we dissect the biochemical changes that 
occur during aging and the pathogenesis of age related diseases and analyse the 
mechanisms by which they prime the NLRP3 inflammasome, thus exacerbating 
inflammation.

This study is aimed toward estimating the lifetime risks, life expectancy, 
expected years of life lost (EYLL), and lifetime costs related to different 
subtypes of stroke in South Korea. We included 13,994 patients diagnosed with 
stroke (ICD-10, I60-I63) in the National Health Insurance Service-National 
Sample Cohort of Korea between 2006 and 2015. Lifetime risks were calculated 
using the cumulative incidence rate for patients aged 18-84. Lifetime survival 
data were obtained through the Kaplan-Meier method and extrapolated with a 
rolling-over extrapolation algorithm. The lifetime costs were estimated by 
multiplying the average monthly expenditures with the survival probabilities and 
adding the values over lifetime. The lifetime risks of stroke in Korea have been 
decreasing consistently over the last decade with the exception of subarachnoid 
hemorrhage in females, which appears to have slightly increased. The EYLL is 
higher in hemorrhagic stroke than in ischemic stroke (6-9.7 vs. 4.7). Expected 
lifetime costs reimbursed by the NHIS would amount to about $71,406 accompanied 
with $14,921 copayment from the patients for hemorrhagic stroke, and $50,551 and 
$11,666, respectively, for ischemic stroke. Further studies are warranted to 
combine survival with quality of life and functional disability to obtain a more 
detailed outcome assessment of the potential impact of the prevention of stroke.

BACKGROUND: Anemia is an independent prognostic marker of HIV/AIDS disease 
progression. It causes impaired physical functioning, psychological distress, 
poor quality-of-life, and reduces life expectancy in HIV patients. However, 
there is limited information in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study was 
to assess the magnitude of anemia and associated factors among adult HIV 
patients on antiretroviral therapy in public health facilities of Kembata 
Tembaro Zone, southern Ethiopia.
METHODS: We conducted a facility-based cross-sectional study. A total of 401 HIV 
patients attending antiretroviral therapy nested in five health facilities were 
included in the analysis. Simple random sampling was employed using medical 
record number to select study units. Data were collected using pretested and 
structured questionnaire, anthropometric measurements were taken, and a drop of 
capillary blood was collected to determine hemoglobin level by HemoCue 301 
analyzer. Clinical related data were collected from patient medical records by 
using a structured checklist. The collected data were coded and entered into 
EpiData version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Logistic 
regression analysis was carried out to identify factors associated with anemia 
and statistical tests were declared significant at a P-value<0.05.
RESULTS: The magnitude of anemia among adults HIV patients attending ART was 
26.2%, 95% CI=21.7-30.4. Being female (AOR=2.06, 95% CI=1.02-4.16), body mass 
index <18.5 Kg/m2 (AOR=2.28, 95% CI=1.09-4.78), Zidovudine use (AOR=3.71, 95% 
CI=1.9-7.26), having had an opportunistic infection (AOR=5.46, 95% 
CI=1.67-17.7), and WHO stage III or IV (AOR=5.71, 95% C=2.68-12.14) were 
significantly associated with the occurrence of anemia.
CONCLUSION: Anemia was found to be a moderate public health problem among ART 
attendants in the current study area. Thus, early detection and intervention 
targeting Zidovudine users, females, patients having body mass index <18.5 
Kg/m2, patients having opportunistic infections, and patients having clinical 
WHO stage III or IV disease is vital to reduce the magnitude of anemia and its 
consequences.

Reliable age estimation is an essential tool to assess the status of wildlife 
populations and inform successful management. Aging methods, however, are often 
limited by too few data, skewed demographic representation, and by single or 
uncertain morphometric relationships. In this study, we synthesize age estimates 
in southern sea otters Enhydra lutris nereis from 761 individuals across 
34 years of study, using multiple noninvasive techniques and capturing all life 
stages from 0 to 17 years of age. From wild, stranded, and captive individuals, 
we describe tooth eruptions, tooth wear, body length, nose scarring, and pelage 
coloration across ontogeny and fit sex-based growth functions to the data. 
Dental eruption schedules provided reliable and identifiable metrics spanning 
0.3-9 months. Tooth wear was the most reliable predictor of age of individuals 
aged 1-15 years, which when combined with total length, explained >93% of 
observed age. Beyond age estimation, dental attrition also indicated the maximum 
lifespan of adult teeth is 13‒17 years, corresponding with previous estimates of 
life expectancy. Von Bertalanffy growth function model simulations of length at 
age gave consistent estimates of asymptotic lengths (male Loo  = 126.0‒126.8 cm, 
female Loo  = 115.3‒115.7 cm), biologically realistic gestation periods (t 
0 = 115 days, SD = 10.2), and somatic growth (male k = 1.8, SD = 0.1; female 
k = 2.1, SD = 0.1). Though exploratory, we describe how field radiographic 
imaging of epiphyseal plate development or fusions may improve aging of immature 
sea otters. Together, our results highlight the value of integrating information 
from multiple and diverse datasets to help resolve conservation problems.

Objective: To emphasize the importance of an early diagnosis and an adequate 
treatment in conjunctival tumors. Methods: We present two clinical cases and 
compare the course of each case: one of conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia 
(CIN) which took a positive course, and a fatal case of squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC) with intraocular and orbital extension. Results: Epithelial conjunctival 
malignancies are one of the most prevalent ocular surface tumors. Among these, 
CIN are the most common. CIN have an excellent prognosis, given adequate 
treatment. However, when the diagnosis of CIN is late, the epithelial basement 
membrane will be affected, resulting in SCC. SCC may have poorer results due to 
its capacity to infiltrate near tissues and create distant metastasis. 
Conclusion: It is not common today to treat patients with orbital extension of 
SCC; however, it is crucial to note the importance of an early diagnosis of 
conjunctival malignancies. An early diagnosis is essential to prevent the 
transformation to other life-threatening types.

Although the primary reason for recombinant factor VIII Fc fusion protein 
(rFVIIIFc) development was to reduce treatment burden associated with routine 
prophylaxis, new evidence suggests additional benefits of Fc fusion technology 
in the treatment of people with haemophilia A. Preclinical research has been 
utilized to characterize the potential immunomodulatory properties of rFVIIIFc, 
including an ability to reduce inflammation and induce tolerance to factor VIII. 
This has since been expanded into clinical research in immune tolerance 
induction (ITI) with rFVIIIFc, results of which suggest the potential for rapid 
tolerization in first-time ITI patients and therapeutic benefit in patients 
undergoing rescue ITI. The potential for improved joint health through the 
anti-inflammatory properties of rFVIIIFc has also been suggested. In addition, a 
new avenue of research into the role of rFVIIIFc in promoting bone health in 
patients with haemophilia A, potentially through reduced osteoclast formation, 
has yielded encouraging results that support further study. This review 
summarizes the existing preclinical and clinical studies of immunomodulation and 
tolerization with rFVIIIFc, as well as studies in joint and bone health, to 
elucidate the potential benefits of rFVIIIFc in haemophilia A beyond the 
extension of factor VIII half-life.

This study forecasts the life-cycle treatment effects on health of a 
high-quality early childhood program. Our predictions combine microsimulation 
using nonexperimental data with experimental data from a midlife long-term 
follow-up. The follow-up incorporated a full epidemiological exam. The program 
mainly benefits males and significantly reduces the prevalence of heart disease, 
stroke, cancer, and mortality across the life-cycle. For men, we estimate an 
average reduction of 3.8 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The reduction 
in DALYs is relatively small for women. The gain in quality-adjusted life years 
is almost enough to offset all of the costs associated with program 
implementation for males and half of program costs for women.

OBJECTIVE: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80-90% of all lung 
cancer cases and is usually associated with a poor prognosis. However, targeted 
therapy with first and second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has 
so far improved progression-free survival of epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) mutant NSCLC patients. Osimertinib, a third generation EGFR TKI has 
recently shown improved overall survival of 6.8 months in previously untreated 
EGFR mutant NSCLC patients. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib 
versus standard EGFR TKIs (gefitinib or erlotinib) as first-line treatment for 
advanced or metastatic EGFR mutant NSCLC patients in Singapore.
METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states 
(progression-free, progressive disease, and death) was developed from the 
Singapore healthcare payer perspective. Survival curves based on the overall 
trial population from the FLAURA trial were extrapolated beyond trial period 
over a 10-year time horizon to estimate the underlying progression-free survival 
and overall survival parametric distributions. Health state utilities were 
derived from the literature and direct costs were sourced from public healthcare 
institutions in Singapore. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties and assumptions on 
cost-effectiveness results.
RESULTS: Compared with first or second generation TKI, osimertinib had a 
base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SG$418,839 (US$304,277) 
per quality-adjusted life year gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the 
ICER was most sensitive to time horizon and variations in progression-free 
utility values. Scenario analyses showed that a 50% reduction in the cost of 
osimertinib was still associated with a high ICER that was unlikely to be deemed 
cost effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Osimertinib is not cost effective as a first-line treatment 
compared to standard EGFR TKIs in advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC patients in 
Singapore. The findings from our evaluation, alongside other considerations 
including the lack of survival benefit in the Asian subgroup of the FLAURA 
trial, will be useful to inform policy makers on funding decisions for NSCLC 
treatments in Singapore.

INTRODUCTION: The number of organ transplants is being on the rise. 
State-of-the-art immunosuppressive therapies and modern peri- and postoperative 
care have significantly increased life expectancy of transplanted patients, 
therefore, dentists and oral surgeons may encounter these patients more 
frequently. Although the number of successful transplants in Hungary has 
recently exceeded ten thousand; there is still no dental treatment protocol for 
these patients.
AIM: The authors aimed to review and analyse the international literature about 
the perioperative dental care of transplanted patients based on good practice 
and evidence-based care protocols.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A review and comparative analysis of the English and 
Hungarian literature between 2010 and 2019 was conducted in relation to the 
objective pursued.
RESULTS: The number of scientific papers in this topic is limited and their 
level of evidence is low. In our paper, the risk factors of transplantation and 
the cornerstones of perioperative, early and late postoperative dental 
management are described. Organ-specific considerations and possible oral 
manifestations of the applied medications are also presented.
CONCLUSION: Lifelong administered immunosuppressive medications and the 
resulting artificially weakened immune system require increased attention from 
dentists and other healthcare professionals during patient aftercare. Close 
cooperation between the treating physician/surgeon and the dentist is essential 
to maintain patient safety. Moreover, inflammatory disorders may put the 
patients at increased risk, so maintaining good oral hygiene is essential. 
Regular dental check-ups, early detection and adequate therapy can be the 
cornerstones of long-term uncomplicated survival. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(36):

BACKGROUND: Eculizumab has transformed management of paroxysmal nocturnal 
hemoglobinuria (PNH) since its approval. However, its biweekly dosing regimen 
remains a high treatment burden. Ravulizumab administered every 8 weeks 
demonstrated noninferiority to eculizumab in two phase 3 trials. In regions 
where two PNH treatment options are available, it is important to consider 
patient preference.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess patient preference for 
ravulizumab or eculizumab.
METHODS: Study 302s (ALXN1210-PNH-302s) enrolled PNH patients who participated 
in the extension period of phase 3 study ALXN1210-PNH-302. In the parent study, 
eculizumab-experienced adult PNH patients received ravulizumab or eculizumab 
during a 26-week primary evaluation period. All patients in the extension period 
received ravulizumab. In study 302s, patient treatment preference was evaluated 
using an 11-item PNH-specific Patient Preference Questionnaire (PNH-PPQ©). Of 98 
patients, 95 completed PNH-PPQ© per protocol for analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 93% of patients preferred ravulizumab whereas 7% of patients 
either had no preference (6%) or preferred eculizumab (1%) (P < 0.001). For 
specific aspects of treatment, ravulizumab was preferred (in comparison to no 
preference or eculizumab) on infusion frequency (98% vs. 0% vs. 2%), ability to 
plan activities (98% vs. 0% vs. 2%), and overall quality of life (88% vs. 11% 
vs. 1%), among other aspects. Most participants selected frequency of infusions 
as the most important factor determining preference (43%), followed by overall 
quality of life (23%).
CONCLUSION: This study shows that a substantial proportion of patients preferred 
ravulizumab over eculizumab and provides an important patient perspective on PNH 
treatment when there is more than one treatment option.

BACKGROUND: Whether increased life expectancy is accompanied by increased 
functional capacity in older people at specific ages is unclear. We compared 
similar validated measures of maximal physical performance in 2 population-based 
older cohorts born and assessed 28 years apart.
METHOD: Participants in the first cohort were born in 1910 and 1914 and were 
assessed at age 75 and 80 years, respectively (N = 500, participation rate 77%). 
Participants in the second cohort were born in 1938 or 1939 and 1942 or 1943 and 
were assessed at age 75 and 80 years, respectively (N = 726, participation rate 
40%). Participants were recruited using a population register and all 
community-dwelling persons in the target area were eligible. Both cohorts were 
interviewed at home and were examined at the research center with identical 
protocols. Maximal walking speed, maximal isometric grip and knee extension 
strength, forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV1) were assessed. Data on non-participation were systematically collected.
RESULTS: Walking speed was on average 0.2-0.4 m/s faster in the later than 
earlier cohort. In grip strength, the improvements were 5%-25%, and in knee 
extension strength 20%-47%. In FVC, the improvements were 14-21% and in FEV1, 
0-14%.
CONCLUSIONS: The later cohort showed markedly and meaningfully higher results in 
the maximal functional capacity tests, suggesting that currently 75- and 
80-year-old people in Finland are living to older ages nowadays with better 
physical functioning.

BACKGROUND: The Controlled Study of Lanreotide Antiproliferative Response in 
Neuroendocrine Tumors (CLARINET) trial showed prolonged progression-free 
survival in patients initially treated with lanreotide versus placebo. We 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of upfront lanreotide versus active 
surveillance with lanreotide administered after progression in patients with 
metastatic enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), both of which are 
treatment options recommended in NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology 
for Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model calibrated to the CLARINET trial and its 
extension. We based the active surveillance strategy on the CLARINET placebo 
arm. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in dollars per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). We modeled lanreotide's cost at $7,638 per 
120 mg (average sales price plus 6%), used published utilities (stable disease, 
0.77; progressed disease, 0.61), adopted a healthcare sector perspective and 
lifetime time horizon, and discounted costs and benefits at 3% annually. We 
examined sensitivity to survival extrapolation and modeled octreotide 
long-acting release (LAR) ($6,183 per 30 mg). We conducted one-way, multiway, 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Upfront lanreotide led to 5.21 QALYs and a cost of $804,600. Active 
surveillance followed by lanreotide after progression led to 4.84 QALYs and a 
cost of $590,200, giving an ICER of $578,500/QALY gained. Reducing lanreotide's 
price by 95% (to $370) or 85% (to $1,128) per 120 mg would allow upfront 
lanreotide to reach ICERs of $100,000/QALY or $150,000/QALY. Across a range of 
survival curve extrapolation scenarios, pricing lanreotide at $370 to $4,000 or 
$1,130 to $5,600 per 120 mg would reach ICERs of $100,000/QALY or $150,000/QALY, 
respectively. Our findings were robust to extensive sensitivity analyses. The 
ICER modeling octreotide LAR is $482,700/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: At its current price, lanreotide is not cost-effective as initial 
therapy for patients with metastatic enteropancreatic NETs and should be 
reserved for postprogression treatment. To be cost-effective as initial therapy, 
the price of lanreotide would need to be lowered by 48% to 95% or 27% to 86% to 
reach ICERs of $100,000/QALY or $150,00/QALY, respectively.

BACKGROUND: Old-age dementias are known to disproportionally affect women as 
well as individuals with low educational attainment. The higher lifetime risk of 
dementia among women is usually attributed to their longer life expectancy. 
However, the impact of sex, and subsequent gender inequity, is likely to be more 
multifaceted than this explanation implies. Not least because of historical 
inequities in access to education between the sexes and the gender and 
socio-economic gradients in risk factors such as stress, depression and social 
isolation. Consequently, the present study sought to test whether differences in 
educational attainment and experiences of general psychological distress mediate 
the association between female sex and dementia.
METHODS: The study utilizes data obtained through the Gothenburg H70 Birth 
Cohort Study and the Prospective Populations Study on Women (n = 892). Data were 
analysed using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation 
Modelling (SEM) with Weighted Least Squares Means and Variance adjusted (WLSMV) 
estimation. General psychological distress was indicated by a latent variable 
and constructed from five manifest items (previous depression, stress, 
self-esteem, chronic loneliness and satisfaction with social situation) that 
were all measured at baseline.
RESULTS: While the results could not corroborate that education directly 
mediates the effect of sex on dementia, level of distress was predicted by both 
female sex (0.607, p < .001) and education (- 0.166, p < .01) and, in turn, 
shown to be significantly associated with dementia (0.167, p < .05), also after 
controlling for confounders. When time from baseline to diagnosis was increased 
through sequential exclusion of dementia cases, the effect of distress on 
dementia was no longer significant.
CONCLUSION: The overall findings suggest that social (dis) advantage predicts 
general psychological distress, which thereby constitutes a potential, and 
rarely acknowledged, pathway between female sex, education, and dementia. They 
further underline the importance of attending to both education and distress as 
'gendered' phenomena when considering the nature of their associations with 
dementia. However, the possibility of reverse causality bias must be 
acknowledged and the need for longitudinal studies with longer follow-up 
stressed.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is a progressive disease that decreases quality of life of 
persons with dementia and is associated with high societal costs. The burden of 
caring for persons with dementia also decreases the quality of life of family 
caregivers. The objective of this study was to assess the societal 
cost-effectiveness of Namaste Care Family program in comparison with usual care 
in nursing home residents with advanced dementia.
METHODS: Nursing homes were randomized to either Namaste Care Family program or 
usual care. Outcome measures of the cluster-randomized trial in 231 residents 
included Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia (QUALID) and the Gain in 
Alzheimer Care Instrument (GAIN) for family caregivers over 12 months of 
follow-up. Health states were measured using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire which 
were translated into utilities. QALYs were calculated by multiplying the amount 
of time a participant spent in a specific health state with the utility score 
associated with that health state. Healthcare utilization costs were estimated 
using standard unit costs, while intervention costs were estimated using a 
bottom-up approach. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple 
imputation. Bootstrapped multilevel models were used after multiple imputation. 
Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated.
RESULTS: The Namaste Care Family program was more effective than usual care in 
terms of QUALID (- 0.062, 95%CI: - 0.40 to 0.28), QALY (0.0017, 95%CI: - 0.059 
to 0.063) and GAIN (0.075, 95%CI: - 0.20 to 0.35). Total societal costs were 
lower for the Namaste Care Family program as compared to usual care (- 552 €, 
95%CI: - 2920 to 1903). However, these differences were not statistically 
significant. The probability of cost-effectiveness at a ceiling ratio of 0 
€/unit of effect extra was 0.70 for the QUALID, QALY and GAIN.
CONCLUSIONS: The Namaste Care Family program is dominant over usual care and, 
thus, cost-effective, although statistical uncertainty was considerable.

BACKGROUND: In Brazil, both the Civil Registry (CR) and Ministry of Health (MoH) 
Mortality Information System (SIM) are sources of routine mortality data, but 
neither is 100% complete. Deaths from these two sources can be linked to 
facilitate estimation of completeness of mortality reporting and measurement of 
adjusted mortality indicators using generalized linear modeling (GLM).
METHODS: The 2015 and 2016 CR and SIM data were linked using deterministic 
methods. GLM with covariates of the deceased's sex, age, state of residence, 
cause of death and place of death, and municipality-level education decile and 
population density decile, was used to estimate total deaths and completeness 
nationally, subnationally and by population sub-group, and to identify the 
characteristics of unreported deaths. The empirical completeness method and 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 estimates were comparators at the national 
and state level.
RESULTS: Completeness was 98% for SIM and 95% for CR. The vast majority of 
deaths in Brazil were captured by either system and 94% were reported by both 
sources. For each source, completeness was lowest in the north. SIM completeness 
was consistently high across all sub-groups while CR completeness was lowest for 
deaths at younger ages, outside facilities, and in the lowest deciles of 
municipality education and population density. There was no clear 
municipality-level relationship in SIM and CR completeness, suggesting minimal 
dependence between sources. The empirical completeness method model 1 and GBD 
completeness estimates were each, on average, less than three percentage points 
different from GLM estimates at the state level. Life expectancy was lowest in 
the northeast and 7.5 years higher in females than males.
CONCLUSIONS: GLM using socio-economic and demographic covariates is a valuable 
tool to accurately estimate completeness from linked data sources. Close 
scrutiny of the quality of variables used to link deaths, targeted 
identification of unreported deaths in poorer, northern states, and closer 
coordination of the two systems will help Brazil achieve 100% death reporting 
completeness. The results also confirm the validity of the empirical 
completeness method.

BACKGROUND: The marketing authorisation for many injectable drugs used in 
palliative care does not cover the frequently preferred subcutaneous route. 
Consequently, subcutaneous off-label drug administration is often practised.
AIM: To assess the use, safety and tolerability of subcutaneous label and 
subcutaneous off-label drug administration in a Danish hospice.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective data from hospice inpatient records 
registered with subcutaneous drug administration. Prospective data of 
subcutaneous drug administration registered to hospice inpatients over a period 
of 2 months.
RESULTS: Drugs were administered subcutaneously to 90% of patients in both 
studied cohorts. Thirty different drugs were administered subcutaneously. Ten 
(33%) drugs were authorised for subcutaneous administration, 14 (47%) for 
intramuscular and 6 (20%) for intravenous administration only. A search in major 
palliative literature and scientific publications revealed that 11 of the 20 
subcutaneous off-labelled drugs were administered with little to no support from 
these sources. In seven patients, 11 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were 
registered. ADRs were all minor local reactions and led to drug discontinuation 
in two patients only.
CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous drug administration was frequently used in the hospice. 
Two-thirds of the drugs were administered subcutaneously off-label. The findings 
of only a few and minor ADRs indicate that the drugs identified in this study, 
although often subcutaneously off-label and with little support from palliative 
literature, were administered with acceptable safety and tolerability. Off-label 
treatment practised in the clinic should be identified, reported and serve as 
inspiration for future scientific research and incentives for extension of 
marketing authorisations.
