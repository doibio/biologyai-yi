demographic, economic and social changes observed in LA in recent years. 
Coronary heart disease and stroke causes 42.5% and 28.8%, respectively of the 
CVD mortality in the region. Chagas heart involvement and rheumatic heart 
disease, once a major health problem, are responsible of only 1% of the 
mortality each. Improving in socioeconomic status, increased life expectancy and 
high prevalence of risk factors for atherosclerosis have been the major 
determinants of this marked epidemiologic change.

Mast cell leukemia (MCL) is a rare form of systemic mastocytosis characterized 
by leukemic expansion of mostly immature mast cells, organ damage, 
drug-resistance, and a poor prognosis. Even when treated with chemotherapy, most 
patients have a life-expectancy of less than one year. However, there are rare 
patients with MCL in whom the condition is less aggressive and does not cause 
organ damage within a short time. In these patients, mast cells exhibit a more 
mature morphology when compared to acute MCL. A recently proposed classification 
suggests that these cases are referred to as chronic MCL. In the present 
article, we discuss clinical, histopathological and morphological aspects of 
acute and chronic MCL.

Health economic evaluations in reimbursement decision making in the Netherlands: 
time to take it seriously?

Health technology assessment already informed Dutch policymaking in the early 
1980s. Evidence of health economic evaluations is, however, only systematically 
used in drug reimbursement decision making. Outpatient drugs with an added 
therapeutic value and expensive specialist drugs require evidence from an 
economic evaluation. Due to many exemptions, however, the availability of 
evidence of health economic evaluations remains rather low. Although the Dutch 
reimbursement agency suggested a cost-effectiveness threshold range depending on 
the severity of the disease (i.e., €10,000 - 80,000 per Quality Adjusted Life 
Year), it was never confirmed nor endorsed by the Ministry of Health. It is 
highly questionable whether health economic evaluations currently play a role in 
actual Dutch reimbursement decision making. Although the requirements exist in 
policy procedures, recent cases show that Dutch policymakers experience great 
difficulties in putting restrictions on reimbursement based on evidence from 
health economic evaluations. The near future will show whether the need will 
increase to base decisions on societal value for money, and whether Dutch 
policymakers show the courage to take health economic evaluations seriously.

Multiple new treatment options for metastatic colorectal cancer have been 
developed over the past 2 decades, including conventional chemotherapy and 
agents directed against vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth 
factor receptor. Combination regimens, integrated with surgical approaches, have 
led to an increase in median survival, and a minority of patients with 
resectable disease can survive for years. Clinical decision-making therefore 
requires a strategic, biomarker-based multidisciplinary approach to maximize 
life expectancy and quality of life. This review describes systemic approaches 
to the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, including 
integration with liver resection, other liver-directed therapies, and primary 
resection.

Although PEGylation of biologics is currently the gold standard for half-life 
extension, the technology has a number of limitations, most importantly the 
non-biodegradability of PEG and the extremely high viscosity at high 
concentrations. HESylation is a promising alternative based on coupling to the 
biodegradable polymer hydroxyethyl starch (HES). In this study, we are comparing 
HESylation with PEGylation regarding the effect on the protein's physicochemical 
properties, as well as on formulation at high concentrations, where protein 
stability and viscosity can be compromised. For this purpose, the model protein 
anakinra is coupled to HES or PEG by reductive amination. Results show that 
coupling of HES or PEG had practically no effect on the protein's secondary 
structure, and that it reduced protein affinity by one order of magnitude, with 
HESylated anakinra more affine than the PEGylated protein. The viscosity of 
HESylated anakinra at protein concentrations up to 75 mg/mL was approximately 
40% lower than that of PEG-anakinra. Both conjugates increased the apparent 
melting temperature of anakinra in concentrated solutions. Finally, HESylated 
anakinra was superior to PEG-anakinra regarding monomer recovery after 8 weeks 
of storage at 40°C. These results show that HESylating anakinra offers 
formulation advantages compared with PEGylation, especially for concentrated 
protein solutions.

4.5SI and 4.5SH are two non-coding RNAs about 100nt long, synthesized by RNA 
polymerase III in cells of various rodents including mice, rats, and hamsters. 
The first RNA is long-lived whereas the half-life of the second is only 20min. 
We previously found that the 16bp double-stranded structure (stem), formed by 
4.5SI RNA termini, contributes essentially to the long lifetime of this RNA 
(Koval et al., 2012). The rapid decay of 4.5SH RNA seems to be related to the 
lack of a similar structure in this RNA. The aim of this work was to verify 
whether the lifetime of any other short-lived non-coding RNA can be prolonged 
following creation of the double-stranded structure with its terminal regions. 
Here RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III from short interspersed elements 
(SINEs) B2 and Rhin-1 from the genomes of mouse and horseshoe bat, respectively, 
were used. Replacement of 16nt at the 3'-terminal region by the sequence 
complementary to the 5' end region of B2 and Rhin-1 RNA increased their 
half-life more than 4 fold. In addition, we demonstrated that shortening of the 
terminal stem from 16 to 8bp decreased only slightly the 4.5SI RNA lifetime. 
Finally, we showed that the disruption of an internal (non-terminal) stem in 
4.5SI RNA did not accelerate its decay in cells. Possible mechanisms of the 
small non-coding RNA lifetime extension are discussed.

Biological control of pests in agroecosystems could be enhanced by combining 
multiple natural enemies. However, this approach might also compromise the 
control efficacy through intraguild predation (IGP) among the natural enemies. 
Parasitoids may be able to avoid the risk of unidirectional IGP posed by 
entomopathogenic fungi through selective oviposition behavior during host 
foraging. Trybliographa rapae is a larval parasitoid of the cabbage root fly, 
Delia radicum. Here we evaluated the susceptibility of D. radicum and T. rapae 
to two species of generalist entomopathogenic fungi, Metarhizium brunneum 
isolate KVL 04-57 and Beauveria bassiana isolate KVL 03-90. Furthermore, T. 
rapae oviposition behavior was assessed in the presence of these 
entomopathogenic fungi either as infected hosts or as infective propagules in 
the environment. Both fungi were pathogenic to D. radicum larvae and T. rapae 
adults, but with variable virulence. When host patches were inoculated with M. 
brunneum conidia in a no-choice situation, more eggs were laid by T. rapae in 
hosts of those patches compared to control and B. bassiana treated patches. 
Females that later succumbed to mycosis from either fungus laid significantly 
more eggs than non-mycosed females, indicating that resources were allocated to 
increased oviposition due to perceived decreased life expectancy. When presented 
with a choice between healthy and fungal infected hosts, T. rapae females laid 
more eggs in healthy larvae than in M. brunneum infected larvae. This was less 
pronounced for B. bassiana. Based on our results we propose that T. rapae can 
perceive and react towards IGP risk posed by M. brunneum but not B. bassiana to 
the foraging female herself and her offspring. Thus, M. brunneum has the 
potential to be used for biological control against D. radicum with a limited 
risk to T. rapae populations.

During the acute phase of SCI, the extension and residual neurological deficits 
that will persist after the waning of the spinal shock period are difficult to 
estimate on clinical grounds. Therefore, objective biomarkers able to estimate 
the extension of the lesion and the degree of neurological recovery are of great 
importance. Research has been focused on the detection of structural neuronal 
and glial proteins that leak from damaged cells, inflammatory proteins recruited 
to remove necrotic debris and more accurate neuroimaging methods that are able 
to discriminate the extension and functional consequences of the SCI. Urinary 
biomarkers are also being investigated to estimate functional changes that 
typically affect bladder function following SCI which can endanger patient's 
life in the long run. Future studies are needed to precisely characterize the 
composition and function of the glial scar that appears in the area of SCI and 
repeals axonal growth, therefore preventing axonal rewiring.

BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation is 
contraindicated in those with <1-year life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop a risk prediction score for 
1-year mortality in patients with primary prevention ICDs and to determine the 
incremental improvement in discrimination when serum-based biomarkers are added 
to traditional clinical variables.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Prospective Observational Study of 
Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators, a large prospective observational study 
of patients undergoing primary prevention ICD implantation who were extensively 
phenotyped for clinical and serum-based biomarkers. We identified variables 
predicting 1-year mortality and synthesized them into a comprehensive risk 
scoring construct using backward selection.
RESULTS: Of 1189 patients deemed by their treating physicians as having a 
reasonable 1-year life expectancy, 62 (5.2%) patients died within 1 year of ICD 
implantation. The risk score, composed of 6 clinical factors (age ≥75 years, New 
York Heart Association class III/IV, atrial fibrillation, estimated glomerular 
filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), diabetes, and use of diuretics), had good 
discrimination (area under the curve 0.77) for 1-year mortality. Addition of 3 
biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor α receptor II, pro-brain natriuretic peptide, 
and cardiac troponin T) further improved model discrimination to 0.82. Patients 
with 0-1, 2-3, 4-6, or 7-9 risk factors had 1-year mortality rates of 0.8%, 
2.7%, 16.1%, and 46.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Individuals with more comorbidities and elevation of specific serum 
biomarkers were at increased risk of all-cause mortality despite being deemed as 
having a reasonable 1-year life expectancy. A simple risk score composed of 
readily available clinical data and serum biomarkers may better identify 
patients at high risk of early mortality and improve patient selection and 
counseling for primary prevention ICD therapy.

Ergothioneine, a histidine derivative, is concentrated in conidia of 
ascomycetous fungi. To investigate the function of ergothioneine, we crossed the 
wild type Neurospora crassa (Egt(+)) and an ergothioneine non-producer (Egt(-), 
Δegt-1, a knockout in NCU04343.5) and used the Egt(+) and Egt(-) progeny strains 
for phenotypic analyses. Compared to the Egt(+) strains, Egt(-) strains had a 
59% reduction in the number of conidia produced on Vogel's agar. After storage 
of Egt(+) and Egt(-) conidia at 97% and 52% relative humidity (RH) for a time 
course to either 17 or 98 days, respectively, Egt(-) strains had a 23% and a 18% 
reduction in life expectancy at 97% and 52% RH, respectively, compared to the 
Egt(+) strains. Based on a Cu(II) reduction assay with the chelator 
bathocuproinedisulfonic acid disodium salt, ergothioneine accounts for 38% and 
33% of water-soluble antioxidant capacity in N. crassa conidia from seven and 20 
day-old cultures, respectively. In contrast, ergothioneine did not account for 
significant (α=0.05) anti-oxidant capacity in mycelia, which have lower 
concentrations of ergothioneine than conidia. The data are consistent with the 
hypothesis that ergothioneine has an antioxidant function in vivo. In contrast, 
experiments on the spontaneous mutation rate in Egt(+) and Egt(-) strains and on 
the effects of 254 nm UV light on mutation rate and conidial viability do not 
support the hypothesis that ergothioneine protects DNA in vivo.

Organs are often formed by the extension and branching of epithelial tubes. An 
appropriate termination of epithelial tube extension is important for generating 
organs of the proper size and morphology. However, the mechanism by which 
epithelial tubes terminate their extension is mostly unknown. Here we show that 
the BED-finger domain protein MIG-39 acts to stop epithelial tube extension in 
Caenorhabditis elegans. The gonadal leader cells, called distal tip cells 
(DTCs), migrate in a U-shaped pattern during larval development and stop 
migrating at the young adult stage, generating a gonad with anterior and 
posterior U-shaped arms. In mig-39 mutants, however, DTCs overshot their normal 
stopping position. MIG-39 promoted the deceleration of DTCs, leading to the 
proper timing and positioning of the cessation of DTC migration. Among three Rac 
GTPase genes, mutations in ced-10 and rac-2 enhanced the overshoot of anterior 
DTCs, while they suppressed that of posterior DTCs of mig-39 mutants. On the 
other hand, the mutation in mig-2 suppressed both the anterior and posterior DTC 
defects of mig-39. Genetic analyses suggested that MIG-39 acts in parallel with 
Rac GTPases in stopping DTC migration. We propose a model in which the anterior 
and posterior DTCs respond in an opposite manner to the levels of Rac activities 
in the cessation of DTC migration.

BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) initiates a chain of responses 
including emergency medical service mobilization and medical treatment, transfer 
and admission first to a hospital Emergency Department (ED) and then usually to 
an intensive care unit and ward. Costly pre- and in-hospital care may be 
followed by prolonged post discharge expenditure on treatment of patients with 
severe neurological sequelae. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of treatment of 
OHCA by calculating the cost per Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 3355 consecutive non-traumatic OHCAs (2005-2010) 
in Jerusalem, Israel, supplemented by hospital utilization data extracted from 
patient files (n = 570) and post-discharge follow-up (n = 196). Demographic, 
utilization and economic data were incorporated into a spreadsheet model to 
calculate the cost-utility ratio. Advanced life support was administered to 2264 
of the 3355 OHCAs (67.5%) and 1048 (45.6%) patients were transferred to the ED. 
Of 676 (20.1%) patients who survived the ED and were admitted, there were 206 
(6.1%) survivors to discharge, among them only 113 (3.4%) neurologically intact. 
Total cost ($39,100,000) per DALY averted (1353) was $28,864.
CONCLUSIONS: The current package of OHCA interventions in Jerusalem appears to 
be very cost-effective as the cost per averted DALY of $28,864 is less than the 
Gross Domestic Product per capita ($33,261). This paper provides a basis for 
studying the effects of potential interventions that can be evaluated in terms 
of their incremental costs per averted DALY for treatment of OHCA.

PURPOSE: To examine changes in patterns of health and disease in global context 
between rich countries (USA, Korea, South Africa) and poor countries (Cambodia, 
Malawi) by using the framework of epidemiology theory developed by Orman (1971, 
2005), and to raise awareness of global health disparities thereby prompting 
actions to reduce such disparities.
FINDINGS: 1) Life expectancy has increased across all selected countries except 
South Africa; 2) Korea and the USA have substantially lower mortality rates than 
other countries; 3) Infant and maternal mortality are still high in the poor 
countries; 4) The major cause of mortality in the poor countries is still 
communicable disease with evidence of the onset of non-communicable disease; and 
5) The health transition theory provides a description and explanation of the 
differences in progress in economic development between countries but fails to 
explain differences in health status within and between countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy and mortality are enormously different among the 
five selected countries. This excessive health disparity is primarily due to the 
higher risk of communicable diseases in low-income countries. Social 
determinants of health are mainly responsible for the health disparities 
observed within and between countries.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Future health care development and global research 
priorities will not be the same for all countries because the pattern of health 
transitions in the developing countries is not the same as the developed 
countries. Actions to reduce global health disparities need to recognize the 
conditions and social context in which persons live. An effective strategic 
approach to global health equality should develop a shared system of values, 
priorities, and delivery infrastructures with the populations who are targeted, 
aligning delivery within the local social contexts.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of adding segmental epidural steroid 
injections (SESIs) to usual care compared with usual care alone on quality of 
life and cost utility in lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LRS) in general 
practice.
DESIGN: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Results were analyzed using 
mixed models.
SETTING: Primary care.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=50) in the acute phase of LRS.
INTERVENTIONS: One epidural injection containing 80mg of triamcinolone in normal 
saline.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Back pain at 4 weeks after the start of the treatment.
RESULTS: Both groups experienced a significant increase in quality of life in 
(especially) the physical domains of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item 
Short-Form Health Survey. The intervention group scored significantly better 
than the control group at certain time points in the physical domain. The 
differences were small. The cost-utility analysis showed that with a negligible 
loss of utility (3d in perfect health), societal costs (193,354 euros per 
quality-adjusted life year lost) would be saved because of more productivity in 
the intervention group.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the beneficial effects of SESIs are small and the natural 
course of LRS is predominantly favorable, we think decision makers can consider 
implementing SESIs in daily practice with the purpose of saving resources. 
Caution must be taken, and further research should be directed at identifying 
patient subgroups who might benefit from SESIs, with additional focus on (costs 
of) complications and adverse effects.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common genetic disorder causing 
premature cardiovascular disease and death. Heterozygous FH conservatively 
affects approximately 1:500 Canadians, and the more serious homozygous form 
affects approximately 1:1,000,000 Canadians, although these numbers might be 
underestimated. Of approximately 83,500 Canadians estimated to have FH, most are 
undiagnosed, which represents a simultaneous public health deficit and 
opportunity, because early treatment of heterozygous FH can normalize life 
expectancy. Diagnostic algorithms for FH incorporate increased plasma 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, pathognomonic clinical features, and family 
history of early cardiovascular disease and hyperlipidemia. DNA-based detection 
of causative mutations in FH-related genes can help with diagnosis. Maximizing 
diagnosis and treatment of FH in Canada will involve a multipronged approach, 
including: (1) increasing awareness of FH among health care providers and 
patients; (2) creating a national registry for FH individuals; (3) setting 
standards for screening, including cascade screening in affected families; (4) 
ensuring availability of standard-of-care therapies, in particular optimization 
of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and timely access to future 
validated therapies; (5) promoting patient-based support and advocacy groups; 
and (6) forming alliances with international colleagues, resources, and 
initiatives that focus on FH. This document aims to raise awareness of FH 
nationally, and to mobilize knowledge translation, patient support, and 
availability of treatment and health care resources for this underrecognized, 
but important medical condition.

PURPOSE: To estimate smoking progression probabilities from adolescence to young 
adulthood and to estimate long-term health and medical cost impacts of 
preventing smoking in today's adolescents.
METHODS: Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health 
(Add Health), we first estimated smoking progression probabilities from 
adolescence to young adulthood. Then, using the predicted probabilities, we 
estimated the number of adolescents who were prevented from becoming adult daily 
smokers as a result of a hypothetical 1 percentage point reduction in the 
prevalence of ever smoking in today's adolescents. We further estimated lifetime 
medical costs saved and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained as a result 
of preventing adolescents from becoming adult daily smokers. All costs were in 
2010 dollars.
RESULTS: Compared with never smokers, those who had tried smoking at baseline 
had higher probabilities of becoming current or former daily smokers at 
follow-up regardless of baseline grade or sex. A hypothetical 1 percentage point 
reduction in the prevalence of ever smoking in 24.5 million students in 7th-12th 
grades today could prevent 35,962 individuals from becoming a former daily 
smoker and 44,318 individuals from becoming a current daily smoker at ages 24-32 
years. As a result, lifetime medical care costs are estimated to decrease by 
$1.2 billion and lifetime QALYs is estimated to increase by 98,590.
CONCLUSIONS: Effective smoking prevention programs for adolescents go beyond 
reducing smoking prevalence in adolescence; they also reduce daily smokers in 
young adulthood, increase QALYs, and reduce medical costs substantially in later 
life. This finding indicates the importance of continued investment in effective 
youth smoking prevention programs.

The incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures in Asian countries is steadily 
increasing. Optimizing osteoporosis treatment is especially important in Japan, 
where the rate of aging is increasing rapidlyelderly population is increasing 
rapidly and life expectancy is among the longest in the world. There are several 
therapies currently available in Japan for the treatment of postmenopausal 
osteoporosis, each with a unique risk/benefit profile. A novel selective 
estrogen receptor modulator, bazedoxifene (BZA), was recently approved for the 
treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in Japan. Results from a 2-year, phase 
2 trial in postmenopausal Japanese women showed that BZA significantly improved 
lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral density compared with placebo, while 
maintaining endometrial and breast safety, consistent with results from 2 
global, phase 3 trials including a 2-year osteoporosis prevention study and a 
3-year osteoporosis treatment study. In the pivotal 3-year treatment study, BZA 
significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures compared with 
placebo; in a post hoc analysis of a subgroup of women at higher risk of 
fractures, BZA significantly reduced the risk of nonvertebral fractures compared 
with placebo and raloxifene. A 2-year extension of the 3-year treatment study 
demonstrated the sustained efficacy of BZA over 5 years of treatment. BZA was 
generally safe and well tolerated in these studies. In a "super-aging" society 
such as Japan, long-term treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis is a 
considerable need. BZA may be considered as a first choice for younger women 
anticipating long-term treatment, and also an appropriate option for older women 
who are unable or unwilling to take bisphosphonates.

Autoimmune diseases decrease life expectancy and quality of life for millions of 
women and men. Although treatments can slow disease progression and improve 
quality of life, all currently available drugs have adverse effects and none of 
them are curative; therefore, requiring patients to take immunosuppressive drugs 
for the remainder of their lives. A curative therapy that is safe and effective 
is urgently needed. We believe that therapies promoting the in vivo expansion of 
regulatory T cells (Tregs) or injection of in vitro expanded 
autologous/heterologous Tregs (cellular therapy) can alter the natural history 
of autoimmune diseases. In this review, we present data from murine and human 
studies suggesting that 1) glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor 
receptor-related protein (GITR) plays a crucial role in thymic Treg (tTreg) 
differentiation and expansion; 2) GITR plays a crucial role in peripheral Treg 
(pTreg) expansion; 3) in patients with Sjögren syndrome and systemic lupus 
erythematosus, CD4(+)GITR(+) pTregs are expanded in patients with milder forms 
of the disease; and 4) GITR is superior to other cell surface markers to 
differentiate Tregs from other CD4(+) T cells. In this context, we consider two 
potential new approaches for treating autoimmune diseases consisting of the in 
vivo expansion of GITR(+) Tregs by GITR-triggering drugs and in vitro expansion 
of autologous or heterologous GITR(+) Tregs to be infused in patients. 
Advantages of such an approach, technical problems, and safety issues are 
discussed.

The medfly Ceratitis capitata is an agricultural pest distributed worldwide 
thanks, in part, to its phenotypic plasticity of thermal tolerance. Cold 
exposure has been shown to reduce C. capitata survival, which may affect its 
distribution in areas with subfreezing temperatures. When insects are 
increasingly cooled, they attain a critical thermal threshold and enter a 
chill-coma state characterized by cessation of movement. It is not clear how a 
rapid cold exposure affects the physiological state of medflies, and how this is 
influenced by age and population heterogeneity. In order to approach these 
questions, C. capitata single-sex laboratory populations of 15 and 30 days old 
were subjected to a chill-coma recovery assay, and separated according to their 
recovery time in three subgroups: Fast-Subgroups, Intermediate-Subgroups, and 
Slow-Subgroups. Thereafter, we analyzed their survival, behavioral, and gene 
expression outputs. In female and old male populations, we found that flies with 
the slowest recovery time had a reduced life expectancy, a higher initial 
mortality rate, and a worse climbing performance compared with flies that 
recovered faster. Therefore, we were able to separate subgroups that developed 
chilling-injury from subgroups that had a reversible full recovery after cold 
exposure. The gene expression analysis of the heat shock protein genes hsp70 and 
hsp83 showed no clear association with the parameters studied. Interestingly, 
thorax expression levels of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene were elevated 
during the recovery phase in the Fast-Subgroups, but remained constant in the 
Slow-Subgroups that developed chilling-injury. On the other hand, none of the 
young male subgroups seemed to have suffered irreversible damage. Thus, we 
concluded that depending on age and population heterogeneity, chill-coma 
recovery time points out significant differences on individual cold tolerance. 
Moreover, the inability to properly induce the antioxidant defense system to 
counteract the oxidative damage caused by cold seems to contribute to the 
development of chilling-injury.

BACKGROUND: Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) has been associated with 
a reduction in early morbidity and mortality compared with open surgery, 
creating an opportunity for aneurysm repair in those previously considered unfit 
for intervention. We determine the published incidence of complications and 
survival after elective EVAR in nonagenarians.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed, EMBASE, 
and Cochrane databases up to December 2012. Two observers independently screened 
search results and extracted data.
RESULTS: Six retrospective reports were identified including 361 patients (81% 
men) with a mean age of 91.6 years. The mean aneurysm size was 69 mm. 
Comorbidities include hypertension (81%), ischemic heart disease (50%), 
peripheral vascular disease (30%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(20%). There was no intraoperative mortality, 22% of patients had perioperative 
medical or surgical complications, and 24% had endoleaks. Mean duration of 
hospital stay was 4 days. Thirty-day mortality was 5%, and survival at 1, 3, and 
5 years was 82%, 56%, and 17%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the complication rates and longer term survival after 
elective EVAR in carefully selected nonagenarians appear acceptable, they are 
higher than those reported in younger patients. Given the typical life 
expectancy, careful consideration should be given to individual cases before 
undertaking EVAR in the nonagenarian.

We report the case of a 49-year-old woman who experienced an inferior myocardial 
infarction with right ventricular extension, poorly tolerated, partly due to a 
severe rheumatic mitral stenosis discovered during the hospitalization. 
Following an initial emergent mechanical circulatory support with femoro-femoral 
extracorporeal life support (ECLS), the patient had the mitral valve replaced, 
and the arterio-venous ECLS was removed for a right ventricular assistance 
device. After seven weeks, she was discharged and fully recovered.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes is one of the main contributors to ill health and premature 
mortality worldwide and its prevalence has been rising during the last decades.
AIM: The aim of the present study was to quantify the burden of disease in terms 
of deaths and loss of healthy life years (DALYs) attributed to diabetes by its
