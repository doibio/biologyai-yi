state calculation as well as for all three network centralities. It allows 
higher accuracy in determining network states and allows to dissect networks and 
identification of network control type and amount for each protein with high 
accuracy. Biological examples demonstrate this: (i) High plasticity of 
mesenchymal stromal cells for differentiation into chondrocytes, osteoblasts and 
adipocytes and differentiation-specific network control focusses on wnt-, 
TGF-beta and PPAR-gamma signaling. JimenaE allows to study individual proteins, 
removal or adding interactions (or autocrine loops) and accurately quantifies 
effects as well as number of system states. (ii) Dynamical modelling of 
cell-cell interactions of plant Arapidopsis thaliana against Pseudomonas 
syringae DC3000: We analyze for the first time the pathogen perspective and its 
interaction with the host. We next provide a detailed analysis on how plant 
hormonal regulation stimulates specific proteins and who and which protein has 
which type and amount of network control including a detailed heatmap of the 
A.thaliana response distinguishing between two states of the immune response. 
(iii) In an immune response network of dendritic cells confronted with 
Aspergillus fumigatus, JimenaE calculates now accurately the specific values for 
centralities and protein-specific network control including chemokine and 
pattern recognition receptors.

An estimated 25% of South African women live with human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV). Antiretroviral therapy roll-out has improved life expectancy, so many 
more women now reach menopause. We aimed to quantify changes in bone mineral 
density (BMD) during the menopausal transition in urban-dwelling South African 
women with and without HIV and determine whether HIV infection modified the 
effect of menopause on BMD changes. A 5-year population-based longitudinal study 
recruited women aged 40-60 years residing in Soweto and collected demographic 
and clinical data, including HIV status, anthropometry, and BMD, at baseline and 
at 5-year follow-up. All women were staged as pre-, peri-, or postmenopausal at 
both time points. Multivariable linear regression assessed relationships and 
interactions between HIV infection, menopause, and change in BMD. At baseline, 
450 women had mean age 49.5 (SD 5.7) years, 65 (14.4%) had HIV, and 140 (31.1%), 
119 (26.4%), and 191 (42.4%) were pre-, peri-, and postmenopausal, respectively; 
34/205 (13.6%) women ≥50 years had a total hip (TH) or lumbar spine (LS) 
T-score ≤ -2.5. At follow-up 38 (8.4%), 84 (18.7%), and 328 (72.9%) were pre-, 
peri-, and postmenopausal. Those with HIV at baseline lost more total body (TB) 
BMD (mean difference -0.013 [95% confidence interval -0.026, -0.001] g/cm2 , 
p = 0.040) and gained more weight 1.96 [0.32, 3.60] kg; p = 0.019 than 
HIV-uninfected women. After adjusting for age, baseline weight, weight change, 
and follow-up time, the transition from pre- to postmenopause was associated 
with greater TB BMD losses in women with HIV (-0.092 [-0.042, -0.142] g/cm2 ; 
p = 0.001) than without HIV (-0.038 [-0.016, -0.060] g/cm2 , p = 0.001; 
interaction p = 0.034). Similarly, in women who were postmenopausal at both time 
points, those with HIV lost more TB BMD (-0.070 [-0.031, -0.108], p = 0.001) 
than women without HIV (-0.036 [-0.015, -0.057], p = 0.001, interaction 
p = 0.049). Findings were consistent but weaker at the LS and TH. 
Menopause-related bone loss is greater in women with HIV, suggesting women with 
HIV may be at greater risk of osteoporotic fractures. HIV services should 
consider routine bone health assessment in midlife women as part of long-term 
HIV care delivery. © 2023 The Authors. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research

Since the breakthrough of kidney replacement therapy, increases in life 
expectancy for patients with end-stage kidney disease have been limited. 
However, patients have become increasingly vocal that, although mortality and 
life expectancy matter to them, the quality of their life, and particularly the 
relief of symptoms associated with their treatment, are in many cases more 
important. The majority of dialysis-associated symptoms and adverse effects do 
not currently have any approved treatments in this patient population, with the 
few treatments that are available used off-label, frequently without proven 
efficacy, yet still potentially adding further adverse effects to patients' 
current symptom burden. This article will illustrate how understanding the 
pathophysiology of a single, particularly burdensome symptom of dialysis 
(chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus) resulted in the design, development 
and regulatory approval of a treatment for that symptom. The pathway described 
here can be applied to other symptoms associated with dialysis, meaning that if 
we cannot add years to patients' lives, we can at least add life to their 
remaining years.

BACKGROUND: The significance of nucleotide metabolism and neuroendocrine in 
cellular immune response and cancer is becoming more well-established. However, 
the mechanisms underlying nucleotide metabolism and neuroendocrine involvement 
in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) remain unclear.
METHODS: First, a pan-cancer overview of nucleotide metabolism and 
neuroendocrine-related genes (NMNGs) was explored through the integration of 
expression profiles, prognostic values, mutation information, methylation 
levels, and pathway-regulation relationships. We next extensively assessed 
variations in prognosis and tumor microenvironment (TME) features across the 
various modification patterns, based on an extensive analysis of the NMNG 
modification patterns of 808 STAD samples based on 46 NMNGs. Utilizing principal 
component analysis methodologies, the NMNGscore was developed to measure NMNG 
alteration patterns of individual tumors.
RESULTS: Pan-cancer analysis shows that NMNGs mostly act as risk genes in 
multiple cancer types, especially in STAD. Based on the NMNGs we detected two 
different NMNG modification patterns in STAD. Both patterns showed distinct 
immune cell infiltration features and biological behavior, with NMNGcluster A 
exhibiting a worse prognosis and a larger amount of immune infiltration. 
Differentially expressed genes with prognostic relevance were used to classify 
the STAD samples into three genomic subgroups. Analysis of survival rates 
revealed that cluster B genes were associated with longer life expectancy than 
clusters A and C. Individual STAD patients' NMNG alteration patterns were 
analyzed by analyzing their NMNGscore signatures. NMNGscore and immune cells 
showed a statistically significant adverse correlation with each other. 
Increased longevity, a higher incidence of mutations, and a better response to 
immunotherapy were associated with patients' NMNG scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a personalized prediction tool for prognosis 
and immunotherapy sensitivity in patients, as well as a promising knowledge of 
nucleotide metabolism and neuroendocrine in STAD.

Interacting with chatbots later in life: A technology acceptance perspective in 
COVID-19 pandemic situation.

INTRODUCTION: Within the technological development path, chatbots are considered 
an important tool for economic and social entities to become more efficient and 
to develop customer-centric experiences that mimic human behavior. Although 
artificial intelligence is increasingly used, there is a lack of empirical 
studies that aim to understand consumers' experience with chatbots. Moreover, in 
a context characterized by constant population aging and an increased 
life-expectancy, the way aging adults perceive technology becomes of great 
interest. However, based on the digital divide (unequal access to technology, 
knowledge, and resources), and since young adults (aged between 18 and 34 years 
old) are considered to have greater affinity for technology, most of the 
research is dedicated to their perception. The present paper investigates the 
way chatbots are perceived by middle-aged and aging adults in Romania.
METHODS: An online opinion survey has been conducted. The age-range of the 
subjects is 40-78 years old, a convenience sampling technique being used (N = 
235). The timeframe of the study is May-June 2021. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic 
is the core context of the research. A covariance-based structural equation 
modelling (CB-SEM) has been used to test the theoretical assumptions as it is a 
procedure used for complex conceptual models and theory testing.
RESULTS: The results show that while perceived ease of use is explained by the 
effort, the competence, and the perceive external control in interacting with 
chatbots, perceived usefulness is supported by the perceived ease of use and 
subjective norms. Furthermore, individuals are likely to further use chatbots 
(behavioral intention) if they consider this interaction useful and if the 
others' opinion is in favor of using it. Gender and age seem to have no effect 
on behavioral intention. As studies on chatbots and aging adults are few and are 
mainly investigating reactions in the healthcare domain, this research is one of 
the first attempts to better understand the way chatbots in a not 
domain-specific context are perceived later in life. Likewise, judging from a 
business perspective, the results can help economic and social organizations to 
improve and adapt AI-based interaction for the aging customers.

Objectives: This study aimed to analyze spatio-temporal patterns of the global 
burden caused by main NCDs along the socio-economic development. Methods: We 
extracted relevant data from GBD 2019. The estimated annual percentage changes, 
quantile regression and limited cubic splines were adopted to estimate temporal 
trends and relationships with socio-demographic index. Results: NCDs accounted 
for 74.36% of global all-cause deaths in 2019. The main NCDs diseases were 
estimated for cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, and chronic respiratory 
diseases, with deaths of 18.56 (17.08-19.72) million, 10.08 (9.41-10.66) million 
and 3.97 (3.58-4.30) million, respectively. The death burden of three diseases 
gradually decreased globally over time. Regional and sex variations existed 
worldwide. Besides, the death burden of CVD showed the inverted U-shaped 
associations with SDI, while neoplasms were positively correlated with SDI, and 
CRD showed the negative association. Conclusion: NCDs remain a crucial public 
health issue worldwide, though several favorable trends of CVD, neoplasms and 
CRD were observed. Regional and sex disparities still existed. Public health 
managers should execute more targeted programs to lessen NCDs burden, 
predominantly among lower SDI countries.

Zooplankton provides bacteria with a complex microhabitat richen in organic and 
inorganic nutrients, and the bacteria community also changes the physiochemical 
conditions for zooplankton, where the symbiotic relationship between them plays 
an important role in the nutrient cycle. However, there are few studies on the 
effect of associated bacteria on the population dynamics of rotifers. In order 
to make clear their relationships, we reconstructed the associated bacterial 
community in Brachionus calyciflorus culture, and examined the life history and 
population growth parameters, and analyzed the diversity and community 
composition of the associated bacteria at different growth stages of B. 
calyciflorus. The results showed that the addition of bacteria from natural 
water can promote the population growth and asexual reproduction of B. 
calyciflorus, but has no significant effect on sexual reproduction, exhibited by 
the improvement of its life expectancy at hatching, net reproduction rates and 
intrinsic growth rate, no significant effects on the generation time and mixis 
ratio of offspring. It was found that the B. calyciflorus-associated bacterial 
community was mainly composed of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, Actinobacteriota, 
Cyanobacteria and Firmicutes. Through correlation network analysis, the members 
of Burkholderiales, Pseudomonadales, Micrococcales, Caulobacterales and 
Bifidobacteriales were the keystone taxa of B. calyciflorus-associated bacteria. 
In addition, the relative abundance of some specific bacteria strains increased 
as the population density of B. calyciflorus increased, such as Hydrogenophaga, 
Acidovorax, Flavobacterium, Rheinheimera, Novosphingobium and Limnobacter, and 
their relative abundance increased obviously during the slow and exponential 
phases of population growth. Meanwhile, the relative abundance of adverse taxa 
(such as Elizabethkingia and Rickettsiales) decreased significantly with the 
increase in rotifer population density. In conclusion, the closely associated 
bacteria are not sufficient for the best growth of B. calyciflorus, and external 
bacterioplankton is necessary. Furthermore, the function of keystone and rare 
taxa is necessary for further exploration. The investigation of the symbiotic 
relationship between zooplankton-associated bacterial and bacterioplankton 
communities will contribute to monitoring their roles in freshwater ecosystems, 
and regulate the population dynamics of the micro-food web.

countries and territories, from 1990 to 2019: Results from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2019.

BACKGROUND: The incidence, mortality, burden of disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs), and attributable risk factors of breast cancer vary significantly by 
country or region, particularly between developing and developed countries. This 
study aimed to analyze breast cancer development trends in developing countries 
based on the influence of the different sociodemographic indices (SDIs) and 
World Bank (WB) income-level disease data from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data on the annual incidence, mortality, DALY, years of life lost (YLL) 
prematurely, years lived with disability (YLD), and age-standardized rate (ASR) 
of breast cancer from 1990 to 2019 in different countries and territories were 
obtained from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study. A comparative risk 
assessment (CRA) framework was used to analyze the general risk factors.
RESULTS: The global age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) gradually increased 
from 21.44 per 100,000 population in 1990 to 24.17 per 100,000 population in 
2019. It rose precipitously to 2.91- and 2.49-fold, respectively, for countries 
with middle SDIs and low-middle SDIs. The ASIR of breast cancer was increasing 
in the lower-middle-income levels in WB, with an estimated annual percentage 
change (EAPC) of 0.29 [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 0.20-0.37] and reduced 
income (EAPC of 0.59 [95% UI: 0.53-0.65]). The Solomon Islands and the United 
Arab Emirates observed the most significant increase in the magnitude of deaths 
from breast cancer cases. Compared to the death cases of 1990, percentage 
changes increased separately by 1,169 and 851%. Compared to developed areas, 
breast cancer-related deaths increased rapidly in developing regions, especially 
among the middle-aged and elderly groups. Meanwhile, the long-term burden of 
breast cancer was ever expanding. Of all the GBD regions, Oceania had the 
youngest age distribution. The deaths in the young and middle-aged groups 
accounted for 69% in 1990 and 72% in 2019. Percentage changes in deaths from the 
seven risk factors in low- to middle-SDI regions increased significantly over 
time across all age groups. However, a diet with high red meat and high body 
mass index (BMI) accounted for the most considerable increase in the magnitude.
CONCLUSION: Public health policy regarding breast cancer is fundamental in low- 
and medium-income countries. The development and adoption of cost-effective 
screening and therapeutic solutions, the mitigation of risk factors, and the 
establishment of a cancer infrastructure are essential.

BACKGROUND: Digital health technologies (DHTs) have shown potential to improve 
health outcomes through improved medication adherence in different disease 
states. Cystic fibrosis (CF) requires care coordination across pharmacies, 
patients, and providers. DHTs can potentially support patients, providers, and 
pharmacists in diseases like CF, where high medication burden can negatively 
impact patient quality of life and outcomes.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, a CF-specific mobile application 
(Phlo) was distributed to adults with CF who received care at the University of 
Utah Cystic Fibrosis Center, used an iPhone, and filled prescriptions through 
the University of Utah Specialty Pharmacy services. Participants were asked to 
use Phlo for 90 days with an optional 90-day extension period. Participants 
completed four surveys at baseline and after 90 days. Changes in 
patient-reported outcomes, adherence, clinical outcomes, and healthcare resource 
utilization from baseline to 90 days were tracked.
RESULTS: Phlo allowed users to track daily regimen activities, contact their 
care team, receive medication delivery reminders, and share progress with their 
healthcare team. A web-based dashboard allowed the care team to review reported 
performance scores from the app. Most patients (67%) said the app improved 
confidence in and motivation for continuing their regimen. The most important 
reported benefit of Phlo was having a single location to manage their whole 
routine.
CONCLUSIONS: Phlo is a mobile health technology designed to help patients with 
CF manage their treatment regimen and improve patient-provider communication.

Postoperative femoral nerve palsy (FNP) is a rare complication associated with 
urologic surgery. Inappropriate use of retractors, use of lithotomy position, 
and prolonged surgery that lead to the femoral nerve compression have been 
reported as risk factors for FNP. Here, we report two cases of FNP after pelvic 
surgery. Case 1: A 47-year-old woman underwent ureterocystoneostomy for a giant 
ureterocele. On the first postoperative day, she developed muscle weakness and 
paresthesia in the left lower leg. An orthopedic surgeon diagnosed her with FNP 
associated with the surgery. Case 2: An 82-year-old woman underwent radical 
cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer. On the second postoperative day, she 
developed extension deficit in the left lower leg and was diagnosed with an 
iatrogenic FNP. Although this complication is infrequent, at onset, it leads to 
difficulty in walking and gait disturbance in the patient. As a result, it 
greatly reduces the patient's postoperative quality of life. Therefore, 
preventive measures should be taken to reduce the risk of this postsurgical 
nerve injury, such as appropriate placement of retractors and proper patient 
positioning during the operation.

patellar instability and can lead to significant functional loss. The underlying 
complex pathoanatomy of a laterally positioned and shortened extensor mechanism 
poses challenges in its management. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the 
anatomic risk factors and outcomes of a 4-in-1 quadricepsplasty (wide lateral 
releases, Insall proximal tube realignment, Roux-Goldthwait patellar tendon 
hemi-transfer, and step-wise quadriceps lengthening) for stabilization of 
habitual and fixed patellar dislocation.
METHODS: In a retrospective study, all patients with habitual and fixed patellar 
dislocation who underwent 4-in-1 quadricepsplasty and had a minimum 2-year 
follow-up were identified. Preoperative magnetic resonance imagings were 
evaluated for the presence of anatomic risk factors. As a prospective part of 
the study, patient-reported outcomes were collected using validated instruments 
including Pedi-IKDC, HSS-Pedi FABS activity score, BPII 2.0 score, Kujala score, 
and KOOS score.
RESULTS: Seventeen knees (12 patients) formed the study cohort. Twelve knees had 
habitual dislocation (9 in extension and 4 in flexion) and 5 had fixed 
dislocation. Mean age was 9 years. 6/17 (35.3%) knees were associated with 
syndromes. On magnetic resonance imaging, trochlear dysplasia was the most 
common anatomic risk factor present in 15/17 (88.2%) knees. 13/17 (76%) knees 
had presence of 2 or more risk factors. At the mean follow-up of 43.3 months, 
the mean Pedi-IKDC score was 88.1, the HSS-Pedi FABS activity score was 15.6, 
the BPII 2.0 score was 78.2, the Kujala score was 90, KOOS score was 93.9, and 
overall patient satisfaction score was 83.3. For complications, 3/17 knees 
(17.6%) had recurrent patellar instability, 1 knee had postoperative stiffness 
that required manipulation under anesthesia and 1 knee had a superficial wound 
infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with habitual and fixed patellar dislocation present 
during the first decade of life. There are several underlying anatomic risk 
factors, the most common being trochlear dysplasia and patellar tilt. The 4-in-1 
quadricepsplasty technique provides reliable patellar stabilization, 
satisfactory clinical results, and acceptable patient-reported outcomes at a 
minimum 2-year follow-up, with a 17.6% redislocation rate.

Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.

BACKGROUND: There is an unmet need for a clinical diagnostic technology to 
detect bacterial vaginosis (BV) rapidly and accurately. Novel point-of-care 
(POC) tests have the potential to fulfill this gap. Our objective was to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical clinician-administered POC 
test for diagnosing BV in the United States.
METHODS: We developed a state-transition microsimulation model to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of using the POC test versus usual care among women of 
reproductive age with vaginal symptoms. We adopted a healthcare sector 
perspective that included relevant healthcare costs and a societal perspective 
that further incorporated productivity costs. Model parameters were empirically 
estimated based on commercial insurance claims data or derived from published 
literature. The primary model outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. 
We started with analyzing a hypothetical POC test with a sensitivity and 
specificity of 0.9 and a cost of $40, followed by extensive sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Using the hypothetical POC test to diagnose BV increased costs by $16 
and quality-adjusted life-years by 0.0005 per person compared with the usual 
care, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $31,108 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained. When also capturing the productivity costs, 
the POC test resulted in an average cost savings of $57. The sensitivity 
analyses showed that the POC test's sensitivity was more influential on its 
cost-effectiveness than specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the POC test to diagnose BV is likely to be cost-effective 
relative to usual care, especially with a high sensitivity or a substantial 
positive effect on productivity.

The Neovasc Coronary Sinus Reducer Stent (CSRS) was developed for the treatment 
of patients who continue to suffer from disabling symptoms despite optimal 
medical therapy. This patient population with refractory angina symptoms is 
expected to grow, since life expectancy of individuals with atherosclerotic 
coronary artery disease is increasing. In this paper, we discussed the 
development of a novel device the CSRS and the upside-down strategy to rebuild a 
retrograde coronary pressure that was attenuated by the atherosclerotic disease.

Author information:
(1)School of Health and Life Sciences, Teesside University, Middlesbrough, UK.

OBJECTIVE: This review aims to identify and map the usage, application, and 
context of occupational justice concepts and related terms by occupational 
therapists and occupational scientists in relation to parents and children when 
children are born preterm or admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit.
INTRODUCTION: Occupational justice concepts and related terms can inform 
occupational therapy practice at the individual level or as a wider social 
approach. However, the extent to which these concepts have been applied to 
parents and children, when children are born preterm or admitted to neonatal 
intensive care, is unknown.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies must include 1 or more occupational justice concepts 
or associated terms in relation to the named population groups. Sources must be 
related to occupational therapy or occupational science.
METHODS: The review will follow the JBI methodology for scoping reviews and will 
be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) and the PRISMA-S 
extension for reporting literature searches in systematic reviews. Several 
electronic databases and sources of gray literature will be searched, limited by 
publication year (2000 till the present day). The review will only include human 
studies and studies with a title or abstract in English. Book chapters will be 
excluded. Reference lists of included studies will be searched against 
pre-determined criteria. Evidence sources will be independently screened by a 
minimum of 2 authors, and evidence will be mapped on a pre-determined template.

BACKGROUND: Osteoporotic fractures  are a leading cause of disability and 
premature death in the elderly. Patients with Alzheimer's and related dementia 
(ADRD) have high rates of osteoporosis (OP) and substantial risk of osteoporotic 
fractures. Yet research is sparse on trends and predictors of OP medication use 
in ADRD.
METHODS: Medicare beneficiaries with OP aged ≥ 67 years have Medicare parts 
A/B/D without HMO from 2016 to 2018. Our outcome was receipt of OP medications 
in 2018. A multivariable logistic regression assessed association between ADRD 
and OP drug prescribing, adjusted for age, sex, race, region, Medicare 
entitlement, dual Medicaid eligibility, chronic conditions, number of provider 
visits/hospitalizations, and nursing home (NH) resident status. Age/ADRD and NH 
residency/ADRD interactions were tested.
RESULTS: Our sample consisted of 47,871 people with OP and ADRD and 201,840 with 
OP without ADRD. OP drug use was 38.6% in ADRD patients vs. 52.7% in non-ADRD. 
After adjustment for demographics, chronic conditions, and previous 
hospitalizations/physician visits, the OR for OP drug in ADRD vs. non-ADRD was 
0.85 (95% CI: 0.83-0.87). NH residents had lower odds for OP medication (OR: 
0.61, 95% CI: 0.58-0.64). There were significant interactions between ADRD and 
age, and between ADRD and NH residency. The OR for OP drug use associated with 
ADRD was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86-0.90) among community-dwelling elders and 0.66 (95% 
CI: 0.64-0.69) among NH residents.
CONCLUSIONS: ADRD patients received OP drugs at a lower rate than their non-ADRD 
counterparts. More research is needed on when to prescribe or deprescribe OP 
drugs in the context of different ADRD severity, patient preferences, remaining 
life expectancy, and time-to-benefit from OP drugs.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate Chinese long-term economic impact of universal human 
leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B)*58:01 genotyping-guided urate-lowering therapy or 
febuxostat initiation therapy for gout patients with mild to moderate chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) from perspective of healthcare system.
METHODS: A Markov model embedded in a decision tree was structured including 
four mutually exclusive health states (uncontrolled-on-therapy, 
controlled-on-therapy, uncontrolled-off-therapy, and death). Mainly based on 
Chinese real-world data, the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) gained were evaluated from three groups (universal HLA-B*58:01 testing 
strategy, and no genotyping prior to allopurinol or febuxostat initiation 
therapy) at 25-year time horizon. All costs were adjusted to 2021 levels based 
on Chinese Consumer Price Index and were discounted by 5% annually. One-way and 
probability sensitivity analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Among these three groups, universal HLA-B*58:01 genotyping was the most 
cost-effective strategy in base-case analysis according to Chinese average 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $37 654.50 per QALY. The based incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $31784.55 per QALY, associated with 0.046 
additional QALYs and $1463.81 increment costs per patient at a 25-year time 
horizon compared with no genotyping prior to allopurinol initiation strategy. 
Sensitivity analysis showed 64.3% robustness of these results.
CONCLUSION: From Chinese perspective of healthcare system, HLA-B*58:01 
genotyping strategy was cost-effective for gout patients with mild to moderate 
CKD in mainland China, especially in the most developed area, such as Beijing 
and Shanghai. Therefore, we suggest China's health authorities choose the 
genotyping strategy and make different recommendations according to the 
differences of local conditions.

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is more 
favorable than best medical treatment (BMT) for advanced Parkinson disease (PD) 
in developed countries. However, it remains unclear in developing countries, 
where the cost of DBS may not be reimbursed by health care system.
OBJECTIVE: To model and evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of DBS for 
advanced PD in China from a patient payer perspective.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model representing the clinical progress of PD to 
predict the disease progression and related medical costs in a 15-year time 
horizon. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and net benefit were 
used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DBS vs BMT.
RESULTS: DBS treatment led to discounted total costs of ¥370 768 ($56 515.20) 
(95% CI, ¥369 621.53-371 914.88), compared with ¥48 808 ($7439.68) (95% CI, 
¥48 502.63-49 114.21) for BMT, with an additional 1.51 quality-adjusted life 
years gained, resulting in an ICER of ¥213 544 ($32 549.96)/quality-adjusted 
life years (95% CI, ¥208 177.35-218 910.10). Sensitivity analysis showed that 
DBS-related cost has the most substantial impact on ICER. Nation-wide net 
benefit of BMT and DBS were ¥33 819 ($5154.94) (95% CI, ¥30 211.24-37 426) and 
¥30 361 ($4627.85) (95% CI, ¥25 587.03-39 433.66), respectively. Patient 
demographic analysis showed that more favorable DBS cost-effectiveness was 
associated with younger age and less severe disease stage.
CONCLUSION: DBS is cost-effective for patients with advanced PD over a 15-year 
time horizon in China. However, compared with developed countries, DBS remains a 
substantial economic burden for patients when no reimbursement is provided. Our 
findings may help inform cost-effectiveness-based decision making for clinical 
care of PD in developing countries.

INTRODUCTION: Substantial increases in joint range of motion (ROM) have been 
reported after eccentric resistance training; however, between-study variability 
and sample size issues complicate the interpretation of the magnitude of effect.
METHODS: PubMed, Medline, and SPORTDiscus databases were searched for studies 
examining the effects of eccentric training on lower-limb passive joint ROM in 
healthy human participants. Meta-analysis used an inverse-variance 
random-effects model to calculate the pooled standardized difference (Hedge's g 
) with 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: Meta-analysis of 22 ROM outcomes (17 studies, 376 participants) 
revealed a large increase in lower-limb passive joint ROM ( g = 0.86 (95% 
confidence intervals, 0.65-1.08)). Subgroup analyses revealed a moderate 
increase after 4-5 wk ( g = 0.63 (0.27-0.98)), large increase after 6-8 wk ( g = 
0.98 (0.73-1.24)), and moderate increase after 9-14 wk ( g = 0.75 (0.03, 1.46)) 
of training. Large increases were found in dorsiflexion ( g = 1.12 (0.78-1.47)) 
and knee extension ( g = 0.82 (0.48-1.17)), but a small increase in knee flexion 
was observed ( g = 0.41 (0.05-0.77)). A large increase was found after 
isokinetic ( g = 1.07 (0.59-1.54)) and moderate increase after isotonic ( g = 
0.77 (0.56-0.99)) training.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the potential of eccentric training as 
an effective flexibility training intervention and provide evidence for "best 
practice" guidelines. The larger effect after isokinetic training despite <50% 
training sessions being performed is suggestive of a more effective exercise 
mode, although further research is needed to determine the influence of 
contraction intensity and to confirm the efficacy of eccentric training in 
clinical populations.

University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark (Drs Jepsen, Pedersen, and Budtz-Lilly); 
and Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Cardiovascular Department, 
Trieste University Hospital Asuigi, Trieste, Italy (Dr D'Oria).

OBJECTIVE: Although physical exercise has established benefits for long-term 
cardiovascular health, concern regarding further aortic events has limited the 
evidence for exercise among aortic dissection (AD) patients. The objective was 
to perform a scoping review of the current concepts and gaps in the literature 
regarding the benefit and safety of cardiovascular testing and rehabilitation 
among post-AD patients.
REVIEW METHODS: A scoping review of the literature search was conducted in 
accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Eligibility criteria 
included any studies with AD in relation to exercise rehabilitation or testing 
and physical or mental health. Electronic databases were queried for relevant 
studies (last queried, November 1, 2021).
RESULTS: Six observational studies were included with a total of 381 patients 
with AD, all of whom underwent surgical intervention. Study heterogeneity 
prevented data synthesis and a formal systematic review, although four dominant 
themes emerged: cardiovascular-related outcomes, aorta-related outcomes, quality 
of life (QoL), and serious adverse events. Patients with AD have reduced 
baseline physical capacity and QoL. Rehabilitation programs may increase both 
physical status and QoL. Rates of serious adverse rates are minimal yet poorly 
defined.
CONCLUSIONS: Within the context of apparent benefits from cardiovascular testing 
and rehabilitation for patients with AD who have undergone intervention, this 
scoping review highlights the need for increased comparative research specific 
to exercise among patients with AD and outcomes such as mortality and 
reinterventions.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol use, tobacco use, and other substance use often co-occur 
with depression, anxiety, and chronic pain, forming a constellation of alcohol, 
substance, and mood-related (CASM) conditions that disproportionately affects 
people with HIV in the USA. We used a microsimulation model to evaluate how 
alternative screening strategies accounting for CASM interdependence could 
affect life expectancy in people with HIV in the USA.
METHODS: We augmented a microsimulation model previously validated to predict US 
adult life expectancy, including in people with HIV. Using data from the 
Veterans Aging Cohort Study, we incorporated CASM co-occurrence, inferred causal 
relationships between CASM conditions, and assessed the effects of CASM on HIV 
treatment and preventive care. We simulated an in-care HIV cohort exposed to 
alternative CASM screening and diagnostic assessment strategies, ranging from 
currently recommended screenings (alcohol, tobacco, and depression, with 
diagnostic assessments for conditions screening positive) to a series of 
integrated strategies (screening for alcohol, tobacco, or depression with 
additional diagnostic assessments if any screened positive) to a maximal 
saturation strategy (diagnostic assessments for all CASM conditions).
FINDINGS: The saturation strategy increased life expectancy by 0·95 years (95% 
CI 0·93-0·98) compared with no screening. Recommended screenings provided much 
less benefit: 0·06 years (0·03-0·09) gained from alcohol screening, 0·08 years 
(0·06-0·11) from tobacco screening, 0·10 years (0·08-0·11) from depression
