BACKGROUND: In advanced disease, breathlessness becomes severe, increasing 
health services use. Breathlessness triggered services demonstrate effectiveness 
in trials and meta-analyses but lack health economic assessment.
METHODS: Our economic study included a discrete choice experiment (DCE), 
followed by a cost-effectiveness analysis modelling. The DCE comprised 
face-to-face interviews with older patients with chronic breathlessness and 
their carers across nine UK centres. Conditional logistic regression analysis of 
DCE data determined the preferences (or not, indicated by negative β 
coefficients) for service attributes. Economic modelling estimated the costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 5 years.
FINDINGS: The DCE recruited 190 patients and 68 carers. Offering breathlessness 
services in person from general practitioner (GP) surgeries was not preferred 
(β=-0.30, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.21); hospital outpatient clinics (0.16, 0.06 to 
0.25) or via home visits (0.15, 0.06 to 0.24) were preferred. Inperson services 
with comprehensive treatment review (0.15, 0.07 to 0.21) and holistic support 
(0.19, 0.07 to 0.31) were preferred to those without. Cost-effectiveness 
analysis found the most and the least preferred models of breathlessness 
services were cost-effective compared with usual care. The most preferred 
service had £5719 lower costs (95% CI -6043 to 5395), with 0.004 (95% CI -0.003 
to 0.011) QALY benefits per patient. Uptake was higher when attributes were 
tailored to individual preferences (86% vs 40%).
CONCLUSION: Breathlessness services are cost-effective compared with usual care 
for health and social care, giving cost savings and better quality of life. 
Uptake of breathlessness services is higher when service attributes are 
individually tailored.

Muscle weakness is detrimental not only to quality of life but also life 
expectancy. However, effective drugs have still not been developed to improve 
and prevent muscle weakness associated with aging or diseases. One reason for 
the delay in drug discovery is that no suitable in vitro screening system has 
been established to test whether drugs improve muscle strength. Here, we used a 
specific deformable silicone gel substrate to effectively and sensitively 
evaluate the contractile force generated by myotubes from wrinkles formed on the 
substrate. Using this system, it was found that the contractile force generated 
by an atrophic phenotype of myotubes induced by dexamethasone or cancer 
cell-conditioned medium treatment significantly decreased while that generated 
by hypertrophic myotubes induced by insulin-like growth factor-1 significantly 
increased. Notably, it was found that changes in the index related to 
contractile force can detect atrophic or hypertrophic phenotypes more 
sensitively than changes in myotube diameter or myosin heavy chain expression, 
both commonly used to evaluate myotube function. These results suggest that our 
proposed system will be an effective tool for assessing the contractile 
force-related state of myotubes, which are available for the development of 
drugs to prevent and/or treat muscle weakness.

PURPOSE: To present 3 cases of oncologic pain treated by DREZotomy in the 
pediatric population and to review the literature published about this 
procedure.
METHODS: The permanent literature about oncologic pain treatment in children and 
the applicability of DREZotomy was reviewed. Three cases treated at our 
institution were reviewed and presented.
RESULTS: In the pediatric population, the DREZotomy has been extensively applied 
for the treatment of spasticity and spasticity-related pain. Currently, there 
are no reports of oncologic pain treated by means of a DREZotomy in children. We 
presented 3 cases coursing the terminal stage of illness, presenting 
predominantly neuropathic, oncologic pain that were successfully managed after a 
DREZotomy was performed.
CONCLUSION: In well-selected patients, with a good general condition and life 
expectancy to withstand an open neurosurgical procedure, DREZotomy is an 
excellent tool to treat neuropathic oncologic pain.

BACKGROUND: Given that COVID-19 continues to spread worldwide, attempts to 
restrain the virus and to prevent the effects that critically ill patients with 
COVID-19 have on healthcare systems, has become a public health priority. This 
ecological study aimed to investigate the correlation between the Human 
Development Index (HDI) and the epidemiological indicators of COVID-19, 
including the cumulative incidence rate of cases, the cumulative incidence rate 
of death, performed COVID-19 tests per million, recovery rate, and case fatality 
rate.
METHODS: In this ecological study, a data set was provided, which included the 
epidemiologic indices of COVID-19, HDI, and its components for each country. 
Correlation coefficients were used to determine linear correlation. Also, the 
scatter plots of the HDI for the studied countries based on the epidemiologic 
indices of COVID-19 were drawn.
RESULTS: This study showed that HDI and its components had positive correlation 
with a cumulative incidence rate of cases, the cumulative incidence rate of 
death, and performed COVID-19 tests (p < 0.001). HDI and two of its components, 
including literacy and Gross National Income (GNI) components had negative 
correlation with case fatality rate (CFR). Also, HDI and two of its components, 
including literacy and life expectancy components had negative correlation with 
recovery rate.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the HDI and its components can affect the 
epidemiological status of COVID-19. As HDI increased, the cumulative incidence 
rate of cases, cumulative incidence rate of death, and COVID-19 tests increased 
as well. As HDI increased, CFR and recovery rate decreased as well. Although the 
HDI is higher in high-income countries, these countries may have also better 
reporting and surveillance systems.

BACKGROUND: The literature on dolutegravir (DTG)-based HIV treatment has focused 
on assessing therapeutic efficacy particularly with regard to viral load 
suppression. However, little empirical attention has been devoted to 
understanding the effects of DTG on quality of life, in particular sexual health 
and functioning in PLHIV. This study focused on understanding patient 
experiences of sexual dysfunction, after transition to DTG-based regimens in 
Rwenzori region in Mid-Western Uganda.
METHODS: We adopted a qualitative exploratory research design. Between August 
and September 2021, we conducted sixteen in-depth interviews and six focus group 
discussions (48 participants) with patients reporting 'new' sexual dysfunction 
after transition to DTG-based regimens at seven health facilities in mid-Western 
Uganda. Data were analyzed by thematic approach.
RESULTS: Decreased libido was reported in both sexes of patients within weeks of 
transition to DTG-based regimens. Diminished interest in sex was more frequently 
reported among women while men complained of a marked reduction in the frequency 
of sex. Women reported loss of psycho-social attraction to their long-term male 
partners. Erectile dysfunction was common among men in this sample of patients. 
Patients described their experiences of sexual dysfunction as an affront to 
their socially-constructed gender identities. Patients described tolerating 
sexual adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as a necessary tradeoff for the extension 
in life granted through antiretroviral therapy. A number of women reported that 
they had separated from their spouses as a result of perceived drug-induced 
sexual dysfunction. Marital strife and conflict arising from frustration with 
sexual-partner dysfunction was frequently reported by participants in both 
sexes. Several participants indicated experiencing insecurity in their 
heterosexual relationships due to difficulties in sexual functioning.
CONCLUSION: Sexual dysfunction following transition to DTG-based regimens is 
common in both sexes of PLHIV, who indicated that they had no prior experience 
of difficulties in sexual health. Our findings demonstrate that sexual ADRs 
negatively impact self-esteem, overall quality of life and impair gender 
relations. DTG-related sexual health problems merit increased attention from HIV 
clinicians. Further research is warranted to assess the prevalence of 
DTG-associated sexual dysfunction in patients in Uganda.

BACKGROUND: Newborn screening (NBS) can prevent inborn errors of metabolism 
(IEMs), which may cause long-term disability and even death in newborns. 
However, in China, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) screening has just started. 
This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of NBS using MS/MS in Shenzhen 
under the nationally recommended program, as well as evaluate the value and 
affordability of introducing this new screening technology.
METHODS: A Markov model was built to estimate the cost and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) of different screening programs. We compared PKU screening 
using traditional immunofluorescence (IF) with the other 11 IEMs not screened 
and all 12 IEMs screened using MS/MS, and the programs detecting different 
numbers of IEMs chosen from the national recommended program were also compared. 
A sensitivity analysis and budget impact analysis (BIA) were performed.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of detecting all 12 
IEMs in the national program is 277,823 RMB per QALY, below three times per 
capita GDP in Shenzhen. MS/MS screening in Shenzhen can be cost-effective only 
if at least three diseases (PKU, PCD and MMA) are covered and when the screening 
program covers five diseases (PKU, PCD, MMA, MSUD, IVA), the ICER closely 
approaches its critical threshold. The BIA indicated the implementation cost of 
the national program to be around 490 million RMB over 10 years and showed no 
difference in budget between programs detecting different numbers of IEMs.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the newborn screening using MS/MS in Shenzhen is 
cost-effective, and the budget affordable for the Shenzhen government. Two 
concepts for selecting the IEMs to be detected are also presented. One is to 
choose the most cost-effective screening programs detecting highest number of 
IEMs to achieve a minimal ICER. The other considers the curability and 
affordability of the disease as the basis of healthcare decisions to screen 
suitable IEMs, achieving an ICER under the threshold and close to the minimum 
value.

BACKGROUND: The monoclonal antibody durvalumab, an immune-checkpoint inhibitor 
(ICI) antiprogrammed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), is available for unresectable stage 
III NSCLC patients as consolidation therapy following induction 
chemoradiotherapy, with very promising overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survial (PFS) results in registration trials. The purpose of 
this study was to provide policymakers with an estimate of the 
cost-effectiveness of durvalumab in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC).
METHODS: The study developed a Markov model covering a 5-year period to compare 
costs and outcomes of treating PD-L1 positive patients with or without 
durvalumab. We conducted a series of sensitivity analyses (Tornado analysis and 
Monte Carlo simulation) by varying some parameters to assess the robustness of 
our model and identify the parameters with the greatest impact on 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Prior to the release of durvalumab, the management of NSCLC over a 
5-year period cost €33 317 per patient, with an average life expectancy of 
2.01 years. After the introduction of the drug, this increased to €37 317 per 
patient, with an average life expectancy of 2.13 years. Treatment with 
durvalumab led to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €35 526 per 
year. OS is the variable that contributes the most to the variability of the 
ICER.
CONCLUSIONS: The study observed that durvalumab is a cost-effective treatment 
option for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC.

AIMS: To analyze secondary objectives of the REGAIN study related to acute 
headache medication use and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) in patients 
with chronic migraine treated with galcanezumab, a monoclonal antibody to 
calcitonin gene-related peptide.
METHODS: Adults with chronic migraine (N = 1,113) were randomized (2:1:1) and 
treated with double-blind monthly injections of placebo, galcanezumab-120 mg, or 
galcanenzumab-240 mg for 3 months, followed by a 9-month open-label extension 
with 120 or 240 mg/month galcanezumab. Headache and medication information was 
collected by daily eDiary. HCRU was reported for the 6 months before 
randomization, monthly thereafter, and converted to rate per 100-patient-years.
RESULTS: At baseline, 63-64% of patients met criteria for acute headache 
medication overuse. At Month 3, incidence of headache medication overuse in the 
galcanezumab groups (33% and 33%) was significantly lower than in the placebo 
group (46%, both p < .001) and was 16% and 23% in the previous-galcanezumab 
groups at Month 12. From a baseline of 14.5 to 15.5, reduction in mean number of 
monthly migraine headache days with acute headache medication use was also 
significantly greater in the galcanezumab groups at Month 3 (-4.2 and -4.9) than 
in placebo (-2.6, both p < .001), with reductions of -6.8 and -7.6 in the 
previous-galcanezumab groups at Month 12. Migraine-specific HCRU rates decreased 
for all groups, with no significant between-group differences at Month 3. At 
Month 12, in the two previous-galcanezumab groups, emergency room visits 
decreased by 58% and 75%, hospital admissions by 100%, and healthcare 
professional visits by 54% and 67%.
LIMITATIONS: Only 3 months of double-blind, placebo-controlled data, a longer 
HCRU recall period for baseline than postbaseline, and patients receiving care 
in the clinical trial itself, may limit generalizability.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with galcanezumab resulted in significant reductions in 
headache medication overuse and migraine headache days requiring acute 
medication use, with notable reductions in migraine-specific HCRU.

Death in Advance? A critique of the "Zombification" of people with dementia.

This contribution sets out to criticize the prominent metaphor of "death while 
alive" in the context of dementia. We first explain the historical origin and 
development as well as the philosophical premises of the image. We then take a 
closer look at its implications for understanding dementia and societal 
attitudes and behaviours towards those affected. In doing so, we adopt a life 
course perspective that seeks to account for the ethical significance of the 
temporal extension and structure of human life. According to this perspective, 
individual existence in time is characterized by normative standards of 
age-appropriate behavior, evaluative standards of a good life, and teleological 
notions of successful development which require theoretical analysis and ethical 
discussion. Such a perspective can contribute significantly to spelling out the 
implications of the metaphor of death while alive and to criticizing their 
problematic aspects. Indeed, it makes clear that this metaphor aligns dementia 
with a different point in the human life course, thus ultimately framing it as a 
kind of deviation from the biographical norm, a disruption in an assumed 
temporal order of existence. At the same time, the life course perspective can 
help to understand why this conception involves ethically problematic 
distortions and blind spots. The resulting considerations allow conclusions with 
regard to medical and care ethical debates about self-determination, surrogate 
decision making, and advance directives in the context of dementia. Furthermore, 
on a theoretical-conceptual level, they also illustrate the importance of a 
biography- and culture-sensitive approach to philosophical and ethical reasoning 
in biomedicine and the life sciences.

BACKGROUND: The economic and social costs of autism are significant. This study 
evaluates the cost-effectiveness of early intensive Applied Behaviour Analysis 
(ABA)-based interventions for autistic pre-school children in the UK.
METHODS: A de novo economic analysis was developed in Microsoft Excel comparing 
early intensive ABA-based interventions compared with treatment as usual (TAU). 
The analysis used 15.5-year time horizon, with costs and benefits discounted a 
3.5%. The model structure was based on cohort structure to capture changes in 
adaptive behaviour and cognitive ability over time. The analysis was informed by 
an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of available evidence.
RESULTS: Adopting a public sector perspective, early intensive ABA-based 
therapies were associated with greater incremental costs and greater benefits. 
When pessimistic assumptions were made regarding the long-term effects of 
treatment incremental costs were £46,103 and incremental quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) were 0.24, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of £189,122 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). When optimistic 
assumptions were made about long-term effects, incremental costs were £39,233 
with incremental benefits of 0.84 QALYs. The resulting ICER was £46,768 per 
QALY. Scenario analyses emphasised the importance of assumptions made regarding 
adult outcomes and type of school attended, both of which significantly affect 
the results of the analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this economic analysis suggest that early intensive 
ABA-based interventions are unlikely to represent value for money, based on a 
£20,000 to £30,000 per QALY threshold typically adopted to inform UK healthcare 
funding decisions. However, important gaps in the available evidence, limit the 
strength of the conclusions that can be drawn from the presented analysis. 
Further research, focusing on the trajectory of autistic children following 
intervention is likely to be highly beneficial to resolving some of these 
uncertainties.

PEGylation is a well-established technology for half-life extension in drug 
delivery. In this study, we aimed to develop a site-specific N-terminal 
PEGylation for biotherapeutics to achieve controlled release, using GLP-1 as a 
model. An additional threonine was introduced at N-terminal GLP-1. Followed by 
periodate oxidation, hydrazide-based PEGylation was achieved in a site-selective 
manner under reductive condition. Two homogenous monovalent mPEG5k-GLP-1 
(peptide 4) and mPEG20k-GLP-1 (peptide 5) were successfully constructed. After 
PEGylation, the degradation by DPP-IV and rat plasma was obviously reduced. 
Their pharmacokinetic performances were enhanced at the expense of impaired 
GLP-1R stimulating potency, and their hypoglycemic effects were improved in 
different degrees. Compared with conventional strategies, this approach is 
devoid of the restriction and alteration of native peptide sequences, and can 
produce utterly homogenous conjugates with excellent selectivity and efficiency. 
It provides a practical controlled release approach for peptides by 
site-specific modification to achieve better pharmacological and therapeutic 
properties.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness, budget 
impact (BI), and impact of uncertainty of future developments concerning 
whole-genome sequencing (WGS) as a clinical diagnostic test compared with 
standard of care (SoC) in patients with locally advanced and metastatic 
non-small cell lung cancer.
METHODS: A total of 3 likely scenarios to take place within 5 years (according 
to experts) were simulated using a previously developed, peer reviewed, and 
published decision model. The scenarios concerned "WGS results used for 
treatment selection" (scenario 1), "WGS-based biomarker for immunotherapy" 
(scenario 2), and "off-label drug approval for WGS results" (scenario 3). Two 
diagnostic strategies of the original model, "SoC" and "WGS as a diagnostic 
test" (base model), were used to compare our scenarios with. Outcomes were 
reported for the base model, all scenarios separately, combined (combined 
unweighted), and weighted by likelihood (combined weighted). Cost-effectiveness, 
BI, and value of information analyses were performed for WGS compared with SoC.
RESULTS: Total costs and quality-adjusted life-years for SoC in metastatic 
non-small cell lung cancer were €149 698 and 1.235. Incremental outcomes of WGS 
were €1529/0.002(base model), -€222/0.020(scenario 1), -€2576/0.023(scenario 2), 
€388/0.024(scenario 3), -€5041/0.060(combined unweighted), 
and -€1715/0.029(combined weighted). The annual BI for adopting WGS for this 
population in The Netherlands ranged between €682 million (combined unweighted) 
and €714 million (base model). The consequences of uncertainty amounted to €3.4 
million for all scenarios (combined weighted) and to €699 000 for the diagnostic 
yield of WGS alone (combined weighted).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that it is likely for WGS to become 
cost-effective within the near future if it identifies more patients with 
actionable targets and show the impact of uncertainty regarding its diagnostic 
yield. Modeling future scenarios can be useful to consider early adoption of WGS 
while timely anticipating on unforeseen developments before final conclusions 
are reached.

INTRODUCTION: Glomus jugulare tumours (GJT) are benign tumours that arise 
locally and destructively in the base of the skull and can be successfully 
treated with radiotherapy. Patients have a long-life expectancy and the late 
effects of radiotherapy can be serious. Proton radiotherapy reduces doses to 
critical organs and can reduce late side effects of radiotherapy. The aim of 
this study was to report feasibility and early clinical results of 12 patients 
treated using proton therapy.
METHODS: Between December 2013 and June 2019, 12 patients (pts) with GJT (median 
volume 20.4 cm3 ; range 8.5-41 cm3 ) were treated with intensity modulated 
proton therapy (IMPT). Median dose was 54 GyE (Gray Equivalents) (50-60 GyE) 
with daily fractions of 2 GyE. Twelve patients were analysed with a median 
follow-up time of 42.2 months (11.3-86.7). Feasibility, dosimetric parameters, 
acute and late toxicity and local effect on tumour were evaluated in this 
retrospective study.
RESULTS: All patients finished treatment without interruption, with excellent 
dosimetric parameters and mild acute toxicity. Stabilisation of tumour size was 
detected on MRI in all patients. No changes in symptoms were observed in 
comparison with pre-treatment conditions. No late effects of radiotherapy were 
observed.
CONCLUSION: Pencil-beam scanning proton radiotherapy is highly feasible in the 
treatment of large GJT with mild acute toxicity and promising short-term 
results. Longer follow-up and larger patient cohorts are required to further 
identify the role of pencil-beam scanning (PBS) for this indication.

Canagliflozin (Cana), a clinically important anti-diabetes drug, leads to a 14% 
increase in median lifespan and a 9% increase in the 90th percentile age when 
given to genetically heterogeneous male mice from 7 months of age, but does not 
increase lifespan in female mice. A histopathological study was conducted on 
22-month-old mice to see if Cana retarded diverse forms of age-dependent 
pathology. This agent was found to diminish incidence or severity, in male mice 
only, of cardiomyopathy, glomerulonephropathy, arteriosclerosis, hepatic 
microvesicular cytoplasmic vacuolation (lipidosis), and adrenal cortical 
neoplasms. Protection against atrophy of the exocrine pancreas was seen in both 
males and females. Thus, the extension of lifespan in Cana-treated male mice, 
which is likely to reflect host- or tumor-mediated delay in lethal neoplasms, is 
accompanied by parallel retardation of lesions, in multiple tissues, that seldom 
if ever lead to death in these mice. Canagliflozin thus can be considered a drug 
that acts to slow the aging process and should be evaluated for potential 
protective effects against many other late-life conditions.

INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of death 
worldwide and the use of CRC screening tests can reduce the incidence and 
mortality of the disease by early detection. This study aims to review 
cost-effectiveness strategies in different ages and countries, systematically.
METHODS: We searched ProQuest, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, PubMed and 
Embase for related studies between 2010 and 2020. Articles that reported costs 
per Quality-Adjusted Life Year or Life Year Gain and Incremental 
Cost-Effectiveness Ratios to compare the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening 
strategies in the average-risk population were included in our study.
RESULTS: The search strategies identified 426 records and finally 48 articles 
were included in the systematic review based on included and excluded criteria. 
We identified seven strategies for CRC screening. Most of the strategies were 
performed in aged 50-75. These studies were reported by cost per 
Quality-Adjusted life year (QALY)/Life Year Gain (LYG) based on methods and 
perspectives and the ICER of comparison of two-by-two strategies.
CONCLUSION: Most of the CRC screening strategies were cost-effective, but there 
was big heterogeneity between the cost-effectiveness analysis of CRC screening 
strategies because of different screening methods, perspectives and screening 
populations. So, it is important to consider this heterogeneity to compare the 
economic evaluation studies in this field.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most serious health 
issues and the leading cause of death worldwide in both developed and developing 
countries. The risk factors for CVD include demographic, socioeconomic, 
behavioral, environmental, and physiological factors. However, the spatial 
distribution of these risk factors, as well as CVD mortality, are not uniformly 
distributed across countries. Therefore, the goal of this study is to compare 
and evaluate some models commonly used in mortality and health studies to 
investigate whether the CVD mortality rates in the adult population (over 
30 years of age) of a country are associated with the characteristics of 
surrounding countries from 2013 to 2017.
METHODS: We present the spatial distribution of the age-standardized crude 
mortality rate from cardiovascular disease, as well as conduct an exploratory 
data analysis (EDA) to obtain a basic understanding of the behavior of the 
variables of interest. Then, we apply the ordinary least squares (OLS) to the 
country level dataset. As OLS does not take into account the spatial dependence 
of the data, we apply two spatial modelling techniques, that is, spatial lag and 
spatial error models.
RESULTS: Our empirical findings show that the relationship between CVD and 
income, as well as other socioeconomic variables, are important. In addition, we 
highlight the importance of understanding how changes in individual behavior 
across different countries might affect future trends in CVD mortality, 
especially related to smoking and dietary behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS: We argue that this study provides useful clues for policymakers 
establishing effective public health planning and measures for the prevention of 
deaths from cardiovascular disease. The reduction of CVD mortality can 
positively impact GDP growth because increasing life expectancy enables people 
to contribute to the economy of the country and its regions for longer.

There is an increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide, associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality, which frequently reduces quality of life 
and life expectancy. Consequently, there is a substantial and growing personal 
and economic burden necessitating the development of more effective therapies 
for obesity. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor analogues (GLP-1RAs) are licensed 
for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and there is substantial evidence 
that these drugs not only improve cardiovascular outcomes but also promote 
weight loss. More recent evidence supports the use of the GLP-1RAs liraglutide 
and semaglutide in people with obesity without T2D. This article discusses the 
results of the major cardiovascular outcome trials for GLP-1RAs in people with 
T2D, the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes study (Effect of liraglutide on body 
weight in non-diabetic obese subjects or overweight subjects with 
co-morbidities: SCALE™ - Obesity and Pre-diabetes; ClinicalTrials.gov 
identifier: NCT01272219; investigating liraglutide) and the STEP studies 
(Semaglutide treatment effect in people with obesity; assorted studies; 
investigating subcutaneous semaglutide). We also highlight the importance of a 
cost-effective approach to obesity pharmacotherapy. Clinicians should consider 
the use of GLP-1RAs in people with obesity, especially those with T2D or other 
obesity-related diseases, such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Ongoing 
trials, as well as clinical and cost-effectiveness appraisals, are anticipated 
over the next 12 months, and their findings may change the current landscape of 
obesity pharmacotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral neuropathy is among the most common complications among 
people with HIV with prevalence rates varying widely among studies (10-58%).
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the prevalence of HIV-associated peripheral 
neuropathy among HIV-positive people in Northern Greece monitored during the 
last 5-year period and investigate possible correlations with antiretroviral 
therapy, disease staging, and potential risk factors, as there is no prior 
epidemiological record in Greek patients.
METHODS: Four hundred twenty patients were divided into a group with peripheral 
neuropathy (n = 269), and those without (n = 151). Peripheral neuropathy was 
assessed with a validated Peripheral Neuropathy Screening tool. Statistical 
analyses were performed with SPSS, were two-tailed, and p-value was set at 0.05.
RESULTS: The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was estimated at 35.9%. Age was 
found to correlate with higher odds of developing HIV-peripheral neuropathy, 
rising by 4%/year. Females encountered 77% higher probability to develop 
peripheral neuropathy. Stage 3 of the disease associated with higher occurrence 
of peripheral neuropathy (96% as compared to stage-1 patients). Among patients 
with peripheral neuropathy, the duration of antiretroviral therapy was found to 
be longer than in those without.
CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral neuropathy remains one of the most common complications 
regardless of the antiretroviral-therapy type, indicating the involvement of 
other risk factors in its occurrence, such as the stage of the disease, age and 
gender. Therefore, the treating physician should screen patients as early and 
frequently as possible upon HIV-diagnosis to prevent the progression of this 
debilitating condition so that prolonged life-expectancy is accompanied by a 
good quality of life.

In the surgery of gliomas, recent years have witnessed unprecedented theoretical 
and technical development, which extensively increased indication to surgery. On 
one hand, it has been solidly demonstrated the impact of gross total resection 
on life expectancy. On the other hand, the paradigm shift from classical 
cortical localization of brain function towards connectomics caused by the 
resurgence of awake surgery and the advent of tractography has permitted safer 
surgeries focused on subcortical white matter tracts preservation and allowed 
for surgical resections within regions, such as Broca's area or the primary 
motor cortex, which were previously deemed inoperable. Furthermore, new asleep 
electrophysiological techniques have been developed whenever awake surgery is 
not an option, such as operating in situations of poor compliance (including 
paediatric patients) or pre-existing neurological deficits. One such strategy is 
the use of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM), enabling the 
identification and preservation of functionally defined, but anatomically 
ambiguous, cortico-subcortical structures through mapping and monitoring 
techniques. These advances tie in with novel challenges, specifically risk 
prediction and the impact of neuroplasticity, the indication for tumour 
resection beyond visible borders, or supratotal resection, and most of all, a 
reappraisal of the importance of the right hemisphere from early psychosurgery 
to mapping and preservation of social behaviour, executive control, and decision
