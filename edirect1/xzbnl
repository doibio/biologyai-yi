OBJECTIVES: Current outcome measures in cardiac surgery are largely described in 
terms of mortality. Given the changing demographic profiles and increasingly 
aged populations referred for cardiac surgery this may not be the most 
appropriate measure. Postoperative quality of life is an outcome of importance 
to all ages, but perhaps particularly so for those whose absolute life 
expectancy is limited by virtue of age. We undertook a systematic review of the 
literature to clarify and summarise the existing evidence regarding 
postoperative quality of life of older people following cardiac surgery. For the 
purpose of this review we defined our population as people aged 80 years of age 
or over.
METHODS: A systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, trial 
registers and conference abstracts was undertaken to identify studies addressing 
quality of life following cardiac surgery in patients 80 or over.
RESULTS: Forty-four studies were identified that addressed this topic, of these 
nine were prospective therefore overall conclusions are drawn from largely 
retrospective observational studies. No randomised controlled data were 
identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall there appears to be an improvement in quality of life in 
the majority of elderly patients following cardiac surgery, however there was a 
minority in whom quality of life declined (8-19%). There is an urgent need to 
validate these data and if correct to develop a robust prediction tool to 
identify these patients before surgery. Such a tool could guide informed 
consent, policy development and resource allocation.

INTRODUCTION: Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial interventions are effective at 
improving functional disability in people with chronic low back pain. However, 
these interventions are often expensive and have long waiting times before 
treatment starts. Therefore, implementing biopsychosocial interventions in 
primary care settings may be of interest. Because people with chronic low back 
pain show different biopsychosocial profiles, they might respond differently to 
specific interventions.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS: This study will investigate the difference in (cost) 
effectiveness between a biopsychosocial primary care intervention, Back on 
Track, and primary care physiotherapy as usual in a subgroup of adults with 
chronic low back pain.
DESIGN: Double-blind, multicentre (n = 8), randomised, controlled trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-six adults with chronic low back pain, aged 18 to 65 years, 
experiencing low to moderate levels of disability and in whom the contributing 
role of psychosocial factors to this disability is restricted.
INTERVENTION: The Back on Track intervention: four individual and eight group 
sessions, based on biopsychosocial approaches from multidisciplinary pain 
rehabilitation programs and provided by trained physiotherapists.
CONTROL: Primary care physiotherapy as usual.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome is functional disability (Quebec Back Pain 
Disability Scale) at post treatment, and 3-month and 12-month follow-up. 
Secondary measures are: credibility and expectancy, anxiety and depression, 
catastrophising, pain intensity, kinesiophobia, self-efficacy, participant's 
global perceived effect, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility estimated with 
cost diaries and quality-adjusted life years.
ANALYSIS: Linear mixed models using an intention-to-treat principle. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios will be calculated and plotted on a 
cost-effectiveness plane.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide useful information on a biopsychosocial 
intervention for chronic low back pain in primary care settings.

BACKGROUND: Canada is among the world's leading nations with the longest life 
expectancy at birth (LE0), and British Columbia (BC) ranks top among Canadian 
provinces and territories for LE0 in both men and women. This paper examined 
recent data as well as projected trends in LE0 of Canadian men and women and 
explored the geographic and socioeconomic disparities in LE0 specific to BC.
METHODS: Using retrospective data on LE0 and age-standardized mortality rates, 
Canada was compared to 11 other Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) countries with the longest LE0. Projections were made using 
linear regression modelling to the year of 2023. The association between 
regional LE0 and regional socioeconomic status (SES) was examined for the 
province of BC using its Local Health Area (LHA) level data on SES and LE0.
RESULTS: In 2009, Canadian men (LE0: 78.7 years) and women (LE0: 83.3 years) 
ranked 7(th) and 8(th), respectively among the 12 OECD nations under comparison. 
Significantly smaller annual gains in LE0 contributed to the losing of their top 
ranks in LE0 for Canadian men and women in recent years, which was projected to 
sustain. Higher mortality risks, particularly for lung cancer and external 
causes of mortality among women was found for Canada compared to leading 
countries on these measures. Geographic variations were evident in LE0 in BC, 
and there was a significant gap of 3.6 years in the average LE0 for BC's LHAs in 
the lowest SES tertile (78.6 years, 95% CI: 78.0-79.3) compared to those in the 
highest SES tertile (82.2 years, 95% CI: 81.6-82.8).
CONCLUSIONS: Canada continues to remain one of the OECD countries with longest 
living population. With the highest LE0 in the country, British Columbia has an 
opportunity to address socio-economic disparities in LE0.

Adopted children often experience health and well-being disadvantages compared 
to biological children remaining in their natal households. The degree of 
genetic relatedness is thought to mediate the level of parental investment in 
children, leading to poorer outcomes of biologically unrelated children. We 
explore whether mortality is related to adoption in a historical Taiwanese 
population where adoption rarely occurred among kin. Using Cox proportional 
hazards models in which adoption is included as a time-dependent covariate, we 
show that adoption of girls does not increase the risk of mortality, as 
previously suggested; in fact, it is either protective or neutral with respect 
to mortality. These results suggest that socio-structural variables may produce 
positive outcomes for adopted children, even compared to biological children who 
remain in the care of their parents.

Scientists and politicians repeatedly call for more investment in prevention. 
Besides improving public health, this would reduce health care spending. This 
article discusses two mechanisms that are relevant to the debate regarding the 
efficiency of prevention. The first mechanism concerns the additional demand for 
health care as a result of increased life expectancy. The second mechanism 
concerns the impact that improvements in curative care have on the consequences 
of prevention. Both mechanisms show that prevention and curative care cannot be 
considered separately. Consequently, decisions on investments in preventive and 
curative care should ideally be based on the same decision-making framework. An 
effective deployment of prevention and care will benefit from economic 
evaluations that give as full a picture as possible of both the costs and 
benefits of new interventions.

The scope of this article is to measure the effect of avoidable mortality in 
changes in life expectancy in the states adjacent to both sides of the US-Mexico 
border between 1999-2001 and 2009-2011. The data used were the records of 
mortality and population censuses from official sources in each country. 
Standardized mortality rates were estimated and the expected years of life lost 
were calculated. Both in 1999-2001 and in 2009-2011 the states belonging to the 
southern border of the United States had lower rates of avoidable mortality 
rates than those observed in the northern states of Mexico. In the border region 
avoidable deaths have seen an averageincrease of 0.19 years of life for America 
and a loss of 0.47 years of life for Mexico. The states of the US-Mexico border 
have common features in their health profiles that make it necessary to address 
some problemson a global basis and consider the particularities of each, in 
order to reduce gaps and enhance social equity through strategies involving 
independent national actions and othersby cross-border coordination.

INTRODUCTION: Hopelessness, suicide ideation and depression symptoms affect life 
quality and expectancy of chronic kidney disease patients.
OBJECTIVE: To verify whether there are differences in hopelessness, suicide 
ideation and depression symptoms between chronic kidney disease patients on 
hemodialysis or transplant recipients. We also analyzed the influence of 
sociodemographic factors in these symptoms.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study in which 50 clinically stable chronic 
hemodialysis patients and 50 renal transplant patients matched by gender and 
age. Instruments-Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation 
(BSI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).
RESULTS: BHS: 2% of each group scoring > 8 (p = 1.00). BSI: 4% in hemodialysis 
and 6% of the transplant patients scoring > 1 (p = 1.000). BDI: 20% in 
hemodialysis and 12% of transplant patients scoring > 14 (p = 0.275). Patients 
who did not have a labor activity presented more depressive symptoms (average 
BDI score: 10.5 vs. 7.3, p = 0.027). Transplant patients from deceased donor 
presented more depressive symptoms compared with those with transplant from 
living donors (average BDI score: 11.0 vs. 6.7, p = 0.042).
CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the intensity of hopelessness, suicide 
ideation and depression symptoms between stable hemodialysis and transplant 
patients. Not performing a labor activity and receiving the transplant from 
deceased donor lead to more depressive symptoms. The high prevalence of 
depressive symptoms and the finding of suicide ideation in both modalities of 
renal replacement therapy point to the need to monitor and care for those 
patients.

Calculating when elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair improves survival for 
individual patients: development of the Aneurysm Repair Decision Aid and 
economic evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair aims to prevent premature 
death from AAA rupture. Elective repair is currently recommended when AAA 
diameter reaches 5.5 cm (men) and 5.0 cm (women). Applying population-based 
indications may not be appropriate for individual patient decisions, as the 
optimal indication is likely to differ between patients based on age and 
comorbidities.
OBJECTIVE: To develop an Aneurysm Repair Decision Aid (ARDA) to indicate when 
elective AAA repair optimises survival for individual patients and to assess the 
cost-effectiveness and associated uncertainty of elective repair at the aneurysm 
diameter recommended by the ARDA compared with current practice.
DATA SOURCES: The UK Vascular Governance North West and National Vascular 
Database provided individual patient data to develop predictive models for 
perioperative mortality and survival. Data from published literature were used 
to model AAA growth and risk of rupture. The cost-effectiveness analysis used 
data from published literature and from local and national databases.
METHODS: A combination of systematic review methods and clinical registries were 
used to provide data to populate models and inform the structure of the ARDA. 
Discrete event simulation (DES) was used to model the patient journey from 
diagnosis to death and synthesised data were used to estimate patient outcomes 
and costs for elective repair at alternative aneurysm diameters. Eight patient 
clinical scenarios (vignettes) were used as exemplars. The DES structure was 
validated by clinical and statistical experts. The economic evaluation estimated 
costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) from the NHS, social care provider and patient perspective over a 
lifetime horizon. Cost-effectiveness acceptability analyses and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty in the data and the value for money of 
ARDA-based decisions. The ARDA outcome measures include perioperative mortality 
risk, annual risk of rupture, 1-, 5- and 10-year survival, postoperative 
long-term survival, median life expectancy and predicted time to current 
threshold for aneurysm repair. The primary economic measure was the ICER using 
the QALY as the measure of health benefit.
RESULTS: The analysis demonstrated it is feasible to build and run a complex 
clinical decision aid using DES. The model results support current guidelines 
for most vignettes but suggest that earlier repair may be effective in younger, 
fitter patients and ongoing surveillance may be effective in elderly patients 
with comorbidities. The model adds information to support decisions for patients 
with aneurysms outside current indications. The economic evaluation suggests 
that using the ARDA compared with current guidelines could be cost-effective but 
there is a high level of uncertainty.
LIMITATIONS: Lack of high-quality long-term data to populate all sections of the 
model meant that there is high uncertainty about the long-term clinical and 
economic consequences of repair. Modelling assumptions were necessary and the 
developed survival models require external validation.
CONCLUSIONS: The ARDA provides detailed information on the potential 
consequences of AAA repair or a decision not to repair that may be helpful to 
vascular surgeons and their patients in reaching informed decisions. Further 
research is required to reduce uncertainty about key data, including 
reintervention following AAA repair, and assess the acceptability and 
feasibility of the ARDA for use in routine clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: The clinical course for hematologic malignancy varies widely and no 
prognostic tool is available for patients with a hematologic malignancy under 
palliative care. To assess the application of the Palliative Prognostic Index 
(PPI), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) as 
prognostic tools in patients with hematologic malignancies under palliative 
care.
METHODS: We included 217 patients with pathologically proven hematologic 
malignancies under palliative care consultation service (PCCS) between January 
2006 and December 2012 at a single medical center in Taiwan. Patients were 
categorized into subgroups by PPI, CCI, and GPS for survival analysis.
RESULTS: The median survival was 16 days (interquartile range, 4-47.5 days) for 
all patients and 204 patients (94%) died within 180 days after PCCS. There was a 
significant difference in survival among patients categorized using the PPI 
(median survival 49, 15, and 7 days in patients categorized into a good, 
intermittent, and poor prognostic group, respectively) and the GPS (median 
survival 66 and 13 days for GPS 0 and 1, respectively). There was no difference 
in survival between patients with a GPS score of 0 versus 2, or a CCI score of 0 
versus ≥1. The survival time was significantly discriminated after stratifying 
patients with a good PPI score based on the CCI (median survival 102 and 41 days 
in patients with a CCI score of 0 and ≥1, respectively) from those with a poor 
PPI score by using the GPS (median survival 47 and 7 days in patients with GPS 
scores of 0 and 1-2, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: PPI is a useful prognosticator of life expectancy in terminally ill 
patients under palliative care for a hematologic malignancy. Concurrent use of 
the GPS and CCI improved the accuracy of prognostication using the PPI.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nodal staging surgery before 
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced cervical cancer in the era of 
positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).
METHODS: A modified Markov model was constructed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of para-aortic staging surgery before definite CRT when no 
uptake is recorded in the para-aortic lymph nodes (PALN) on PET/CT. Survival and 
complication rates were estimated based on the published literature. Cost data 
were obtained from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. 
Strategies were compared using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). 
Sensitivity analyses were performed, including estimates for the performance of 
PET/CT, postoperative complication rate, and varying survival rates according to 
the radiation field.
RESULTS: We compared two strategies: strategy 1, pelvic CRT for all patients; 
and strategy 2, nodal staging surgery followed by extended-field CRT when PALN 
metastasis was found and pelvic CRT otherwise. The ICER for strategy 2 compared 
to strategy 1 was $19,505 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Under 
deterministic sensitivity analyses, the model was relatively sensitive to 
survival reduction in patients who undergo pelvic CRT alone despite having 
occult PALN metastasis. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated the 
robustness of the case results, with a 91% probability of cost-effectiveness at 
the willingness-to-pay thresholds of $60,000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: Nodal staging surgery before definite CRT may be cost-effective when 
PET/CT imaging shows no evidence of PALN metastasis. Prospective trials are 
warranted to transfer these results to guidelines.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel of 34 
cancer-associated genes would cost-effectively aid in the treatment selection 
for patients with metastatic melanoma, compared with a single-site BRAF V600 
mutation test.
METHODS: A decision model was developed to estimate the costs and health 
outcomes of the two test strategies. The cost effectiveness of these two 
strategies was analyzed from a payer perspective over a 2-year time horizon with 
model parameters taken from the literature.
RESULTS: In the base case, the gene sequencing panel strategy resulted in a cost 
of US$120,022 and 0.721 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient, whereas 
the single-site mutation test strategy resulted in a cost of US$128,965 and 
0.704 QALYs. Thus, the gene sequencing panel strategy cost US$8943 less per 
patient and increased QALYs by 0.0174 per patient. Sensitivity analyses showed 
that, compared with the single-site mutation test strategy, the gene sequencing 
panel strategy had a 90.9% chance of having reduced costs and increased QALYs, 
with the cost of the gene sequencing panel test having minimal effect on the 
incremental cost.
CONCLUSION: Compared with the single-site mutation test, the use of an NGS panel 
of 34 cancer-associated genes as an aid in selecting therapy for patients with 
metastatic melanoma reduced costs and increased QALYs. If the base-case results 
were applied to the 8900 patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in the USA 
each year, the gene sequencing panel strategy could result in an annual savings 
of US$79.6 million and a gain of 155 QALYs.

This paper analyses the secular changes in the body development patterns of 
Hungarian children between the 1910s and the beginning of the 2000s in relation 
to socioeconomic and demographic changes in the country. Individual growth data 
of children were available from two national growth studies (1983-86, 2003-06), 
while sample-size weighted means of children's body dimensions were collected 
through regional studies between the 1920s and 1970s. Gross domestic product, 
Gini index, life expectancy at birth and under-5 mortality rate were used to 
assess the changes in economic status, income inequalities of the society and 
the population's general health status, respectively. Secular changes in food 
consumption habits were also examined. The positive Hungarian secular changes in 
socioeconomic status were associated with a continuous increase in children's 
body dimensions. The negative socioeconomic changes reflected only in wartime 
and post-war periods of children's growth, and the considerable socioeconomic 
changes at the beginning of the 1990s did not appear to influence the positive 
trend in children's growth. The positive secular trend in stature and body mass 
did not level off at the beginning of the 2000s: the socioeconomic conditions 
that support optimal growth and maturation could improve in Hungary.

Many economic analyses fail to incorporate evidence on child health-related 
quality of life because of a paucity of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
estimates. This health valuation study is the first to summarize the EQ-5D-Y on 
a QALY scale. Drawn from a nationally representative panel, 5207 adult 
respondents were asked to choose between two losses in child health-related 
quality of life. Based on their choices, a 1-year increase in child 
pain/discomfort from 'some' to 'a lot' equals a loss of 4 QALYs (95% CI, 
3.8-4.4). Likewise, a 1-year increase in child anxiety/depression from 'a bit' 
to 'very worried, sad, or unhappy' equals a loss of 2 QALYs (95% CI, 1.9-2.2). 
These findings enable the integration of child-reported outcomes with adult 
preferences to inform economic analysis. Results inform both clinical practice 
and resource allocation decisions by enhancing understanding of difficult 
tradeoffs in child-reported outcomes. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for economic evaluations of health interventions 
define relevant outcomes as those accruing to individuals receiving 
interventions. Little consensus exists on counting health impacts on current and 
future fertility and childbearing. Our objective was to characterize current 
practices for counting such health outcomes.
METHODS: We developed a framework characterizing health interventions with 
direct and/or indirect effects on fertility and childbearing and how such 
outcomes are reported. We identified interventions spanning the framework and 
performed a targeted literature review for economic evaluations of these 
interventions. For each article, we characterized how the potential health 
outcomes from each intervention were considered, focusing on quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) associated with fertility and childbearing.
RESULTS: We reviewed 108 studies, identifying 7 themes: 1) Studies were 
heterogeneous in reporting outcomes. 2) Studies often selected outcomes for 
inclusion that tend to bias toward finding the intervention to be 
cost-effective. 3) Studies often avoided the challenges of assigning QALYs for 
pregnancy and fertility by instead considering cost per intermediate outcome. 4) 
Even for the same intervention, studies took heterogeneous approaches to outcome 
evaluation. 5) Studies used multiple, competing rationales for whether and how 
to include fertility-related QALYs and whose QALYs to include. 6) Studies 
examining interventions with indirect effects on fertility typically ignored 
such QALYs. 7) Even recent studies had these shortcomings. Limitations include 
that the review was targeted rather than systematic.
CONCLUSIONS: Economic evaluations inconsistently consider QALYs from current and 
future fertility and childbearing in ways that frequently appear biased toward 
the interventions considered. As the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and 
Medicine updates its guidelines, making the practice of cost-effectiveness 
analysis more consistent is a priority. Our study contributes to harmonizing 
methods in this respect.

Senescence has been the focus of research for many centuries. Despite 
significant progress in extending average human life expectancy, the process of 
aging remains largely elusive and, unfortunately, inevitable. In this review, we 
attempted to summarize the current theories of aging and the approaches to 
understanding it.

BACKGROUND: Our previous work showed that providing additional rehabilitation on 
a Saturday was cost effective in the short term from the perspective of the 
health service provider. This study aimed to evaluate if providing additional 
rehabilitation on a Saturday was cost effective at 12 months, from a health 
system perspective inclusive of private costs.
METHODS: Cost effectiveness analyses alongside a single-blinded randomized 
controlled trial with 12 months follow up inclusive of informal care. 
Participants were adults admitted to two publicly funded inpatient 
rehabilitation facilities. The control group received usual care rehabilitation 
services from Monday to Friday and the intervention group received usual care 
plus additional Saturday rehabilitation. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios 
were reported as cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained and for a 
minimal clinical important difference (MCID) in functional independence.
RESULTS: A total of 996 patients [mean age 74 years (SD 13)] were randomly 
assigned to the intervention (n = 496) or control group (n = 500). The 
intervention was associated with improvements in QALY and MCID in function, as 
well as a non-significant reduction in cost from admission to 12 months (mean 
difference (MD) AUD$6,325; 95% CI -4,081 to 16,730; t test p = 0.23 and MWU 
p = 0.06), and a significant reduction in cost from admission to 6 months (MD 
AUD$6,445; 95% CI 3,368 to 9,522; t test p = 0.04 and MWU p = 0.01). There is a 
high degree of certainty that providing additional rehabilitation services on 
Saturday is cost effective. Sensitivity analyses varying the cost of informal 
carers and self-reported health service utilization, favored the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: From a health system perspective inclusive of private costs the 
provision of additional Saturday rehabilitation for inpatients is likely to have 
sustained cost savings per QALY gained and for a MCID in functional 
independence, for the inpatient stay and 12 months following discharge, without 
a cost shift into the community.

Over the last decade, there has been a significant increase in average paternal 
age when the first child is conceived, either due to increased life expectancy, 
widespread use of contraception, late marriages and other factors. While the 
effect of maternal ageing on fertilization and reproduction is well known and 
several studies have shown that women over 35 years have a higher risk of 
infertility, pregnancy complications, spontaneous abortion, congenital 
anomalies, and perinatal complications. The effect of paternal age on semen 
quality and reproductive function is controversial for several reasons. First, 
there is no universal definition for advanced paternal ageing. Secondly, the 
literature is full of studies with conflicting results, especially for the most 
common parameters tested. Advancing paternal age also has been associated with 
increased risk of genetic disease. Our exhaustive literature review has 
demonstrated negative effects on sperm quality and testicular functions with 
increasing paternal age. Epigenetics changes, DNA mutations along with 
chromosomal aneuploidies have been associated with increasing paternal age. In 
addition to increased risk of male infertility, paternal age has also been 
demonstrated to impact reproductive and fertility outcomes including a decrease 
in IVF/ICSI success rate and increasing rate of preterm birth. Increasing 
paternal age has shown to increase the incidence of different types of disorders 
like autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and childhood leukemia in the 
progeny. It is thereby essential to educate the infertile couples on the 
disturbing links between increased paternal age and rising disorders in their 
offspring, to better counsel them during their reproductive years.

BACKGROUND: Psychosocial problems are common in patients with diabetes. However, 
data on psychosocial issues affecting patients with diabetes in Zambia are 
scarce. The present study explored sources of stress, stress coping strategies, 
stigma and perceived quality of life and care as experienced by adolescents 
living with Type 1 Diabetes in Zambia.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were carried out. Three groups of 
participants involving adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes (n = 10), caregivers (n 
= 8) and health practitioners (n = 4) were interviewed. Transcripts were 
analyzed using a thematic approach.
RESULTS: Stress was commonly reported by adolescents mainly stemming from 
social, psychological and physical sources. To deal with stress, adolescents 
often employed different coping strategies such as adapting, accepting and 
avoiding among others. Both internal factors (those relating to the patients 
themselves) and external factors (those related to the context of the patients') 
influenced the patients' quality of health care. In addition, low quality of 
life was an issue among adolescents and their families. Poor diet, low 
socioeconomic status and lack of medicine were factors affecting quality of 
health care.
CONCLUSION: Stress was an issue affecting adolescents; the coping strategies 
employed were sometimes maladaptive such as avoiding injecting themselves to 
escape stress. Several aspects of quality of life were suboptimal in both 
adolescents and their families, such as stigmatization, short life expectancy, 
low socioeconomic status and poor social participation. Findings show that there 
is an urgent need for a strong response from all stakeholders (governments, 
patients, organizations and companies) to improve diabetes care and living 
conditions for young people with type 1 diabetes living in Zambia.

OBJECTIVE: Dietary changes which improve health are also likely to be beneficial 
for the environment by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). However, 
previous analyses have not accounted for the potential acceptability of low GHG 
diets to the general public. This study attempted to quantify the health effects 
associated with adopting low GHG emission diets in the UK.
DESIGN: Epidemiological modelling study.
SETTING: UK.
PARTICIPANTS: UK population.
INTERVENTION: Adoption of diets optimised to achieve the WHO nutritional 
recommendations and reduce GHG emissions while remaining as close as possible to 
existing dietary patterns.
MAIN OUTCOME: Changes in years of life lost due to coronary heart disease, 
stroke, several cancers and type II diabetes, quantified using life tables.
RESULTS: If the average UK dietary intake were optimised to comply with the WHO 
recommendations, we estimate an incidental reduction of 17% in GHG emissions. 
Such a dietary pattern would be broadly similar to the current UK average. Our 
model suggests that it would save almost 7 million years of life lost 
prematurely in the UK over the next 30 years and increase average life 
expectancy by over 8 months. Diets that result in additional GHG emission 
reductions could achieve further net health benefits. For emission reductions 
greater than 40%, improvements in some health outcomes may decrease and 
acceptability will diminish.
CONCLUSIONS: There are large potential benefits to health from adopting diets 
with lower associated GHG emissions in the UK. Most of these benefits can be 
achieved without drastic changes to existing dietary patterns. However, to 
reduce emissions by more than 40%, major dietary changes that limit both 
acceptability and the benefits to health are required.

A Political and Social History of HIV in South Africa.

nonosimelela@gmail.com.

For the past 25 years, South Africa has had to deal with the inexorable and 
monumental rise of HIV. From one or two isolated cases, in the late 1980s, South 
Africa now has an estimated 6.4 million people infected with HIV, with high 
rates of concomitant tuberculosis, which will profoundly affect the country for 
decades to come. For nearly 10 years, the South African government's response to 
the HIV epidemic was described as denialist, which was estimated to have 
resulted in the deaths of 330,000 people because lifesaving antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) was not provided (Chigwedere et al. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 
49:410-15, 2008; Heywood 2004). However, the story of the HIV and AIDS response 
in South Africa over the past 5 years is one of great progress after almost a 
decade of complex and tragic denialism that united civil society in a way not 
seen since the opposition to apartheid. Today, South Africa can boast of close 
to 3 million people on ART, by far the largest number in the world. Prevention 
efforts appear to be yielding results but there continues to be large numbers of 
new infections, with a profound peak in incidence in young women aged 15 to 24 
years. In addition, infections occur across the gender spectrum in older age 
groups. As a result of the massive increase in access to ART after 2004 and 
particularly after 2008 as political will towards the HIV ART programme 
improved, there has been a marked increase in life expectancy, from 56 to 61 
years in the period 2009-2012 alone; the aggressive expansion of the prevention 
of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) to HIV-positive pregnant women has been 
accompanied by dramatic decrease in HIV transmission to infants; and a 25 % 
decrease in child and infant mortality rates in the period 2009-2012. This 
progress in access is significantly due to a civil society movement that was 
prepared to pose a rights-based challenge to a governing party in denial and to 
brave health officials, politicians and clinicians working in a hostile system 
to bring about change.

Francisco, San Francisco, California; ‡Department of Epidemiology & 
Biostatistics, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, 
California.

BACKGROUND: Low-grade glioma (LGG) patients have increased life expectancy, so 
interest is high in the treatments that maximize cognition and quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: To examine presurgical baseline cognitive deficits in a case series 
of LGG patients and determine cognitive effects of surgical resection with awake 
mapping.
METHODS: We retrospectively assessed neurological deficits, subjective concerns 
from patient or caregiver, and cognitive deficits at baseline and postsurgery 
for 22 patients with newly diagnosed LGG who underwent baseline 
neuropsychological evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging before awake 
surgical resection with mapping. Twelve of the 22 patients returned for 
postoperative evaluation approximately 7 months after surgery.
