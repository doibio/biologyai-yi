OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to examine the effectiveness of VR-based 
interventions on health-related outcomes in BCSs. A meta-analysis was conducted 
to evaluate the effectiveness of VR-based interventions in the rehabilitation 
management of BCSs.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, 
CINAHL with Full Text, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CNKI, 
WanFang, VIP, and CBM, from inception to May 25, 2021. The inclusion criteria of 
the selected studies were as follows: (1) adults diagnosed with breast cancer; 
(2) any type of VR-based interventions (immersive and nonimmersive virtual 
environment); (3) comparison of traditional rehabilitation methods; (4) outcomes 
including pain, depression, anxiety, fatigue, cognitive function, shoulder range 
of motion (ROM), hand grip strength, lymphedema, cybersickness symptoms, fear of 
movement, bleeding, effusion, and flap necrosis, both during and after 
treatment; and (5) randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case-controlled trials, 
and quasi-experimental studies. The Cochrane Collaboration Tool was used to 
evaluate the risk of bias. Review Manager version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration) 
was used to conduct the meta-analysis. The mean difference (MD) and SDs with 95% 
CIs were used to calculate continuous variables.
RESULTS: Twelve articles were included in this systematic review, of which 10 
contributed information to the meta-analysis. A total of 604 participants were 
analyzed. The statistical analysis showed significant results for flexion 
(standard mean difference [SMD] 1.79; 95% CI 0.55 to 3.03; P=.005), extension 
(SMD 1.54; 95% CI 0.83 to 2.25; P<.001), abduction (MD 17.53; 95% CI 14.33 to 
20.72; P<.001), adduction (MD 15.98; 95% CI 14.02 to 17.94; P<.001), internal 
rotation (MD 7.12; 95% CI 5.54 to 8.70; P<.001), external rotation (SMD 0.96; 
95% CI 0.62 to 1.29; P<.001), anxiety (MD -6.47; 95% CI -7.21 to -5.73; P<.001), 
depression (MD -4.27; 95% CI -4.64 to -3.91; P<.001), pain (MD -1.32; 95% CI 
-2.56 to -0.09; P=.04), and cognitive function (MD 8.80; 95% CI 8.24 to 9.36; 
P<.001). The meta-analysis indicated little to no difference in hand grip 
strength (MD 1.96; 95% CI -0.93 to 4.85; P=.18).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this review noted a weak but consistent positive 
association between VR-based interventions and outcomes. However, these results 
must be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of controlled trials 
analyzed, small sample sizes, and poor methodological quality. Well-designed, 
large, high-quality trials may have a significant impact on our confidence in 
the results. Future studies should identify specific aspects that improve the 
clinical impact of VR-based interventions on major outcomes in BCSs in the 
clinical setting.

IMPORTANCE: Emerging evidence supports the use of outpatient parenteral 
antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) and, in many cases, partial oral antibiotic therapy 
for the treatment of injection drug use-associated infective endocarditis 
(IDU-IE); however, long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness remain unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the added value of inpatient addiction care services and 
the cost-effectiveness and clinical outcomes of alternative antibiotic treatment 
strategies for patients with IDU-IE.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytical modeling study used 
a validated microsimulation model to compare antibiotic treatment strategies for 
patients with IDU-IE. Model inputs were derived from clinical trials and 
observational cohort studies. The model included all patients with injection 
opioid drug use (N = 5 million) in the US who were eligible to receive OPAT 
either in the home or at a postacute care facility. Costs were annually 
discounted at 3%. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated from a health care sector 
perspective over a lifetime starting in 2020. Probabilistic sensitivity, 
scenario, and threshold analyses were performed to address uncertainty.
INTERVENTIONS: The model simulated 4 treatment strategies: (1) 4 to 6 weeks of 
inpatient intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy along with opioid detoxification 
(usual care strategy), (2) 4 to 6 weeks of inpatient IV antibiotic therapy along 
with inpatient addiction care services that offered medication for opioid use 
disorder (usual care/addiction care strategy), (3) 3 weeks of inpatient IV 
antibiotic therapy along with addiction care services followed by OPAT (OPAT 
strategy), and (4) 3 weeks of inpatient IV antibiotic therapy along with 
addiction care services followed by partial oral antibiotic therapy (partial 
oral antibiotic strategy).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean percentage of patients completing treatment for 
IDU-IE, deaths associated with IDU-IE, life expectancy (measured in life-years 
[LYs]), mean cost per person, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: All modeled scenarios were initialized with 5 million individuals (mean 
age, 42 years; range, 18-64 years; 70% male) who had a history of injection 
opioid drug use. The usual care strategy resulted in 18.63 LYs at a cost of 
$416 570 per person, with 77.6% of hospitalized patients completing treatment. 
Life expectancy was extended by each alternative strategy. The partial oral 
antibiotic strategy yielded the highest treatment completion rate (80.3%) 
compared with the OPAT strategy (78.8%) and the usual care/addiction care 
strategy (77.6%). The OPAT strategy was the least expensive at $412 150 per 
person. Compared with the OPAT strategy, the partial oral antibiotic strategy 
had an ICER of $163 370 per LY. Increasing IDU-IE treatment uptake and 
decreasing treatment discontinuation made the partial oral antibiotic strategy 
more cost-effective compared with the OPAT strategy. When assuming that all 
patients with IDU-IE were eligible to receive partial oral antibiotic therapy, 
the strategy was cost-saving and resulted in 0.0247 additional discounted LYs. 
When treatment discontinuation was decreased from 3.30% to 2.65% per week, the 
partial oral antibiotic strategy was cost-effective compared with OPAT at the 
$100 000 per LY threshold.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this decision analytical modeling study, 
incorporation of OPAT or partial oral antibiotic approaches along with addiction 
care services for the treatment of patients with IDU-IE was associated with 
increases in the number of people completing treatment, decreases in mortality, 
and savings in cost compared with the usual care strategy of providing inpatient 
IV antibiotic therapy alone.

BACKGROUND: Nearly one-fifth of all deaths attributable to alcohol are due to 
liver diseases.
METHODS: The study employs a Markov Probabilistic Modeling approach considering 
various clinical spectrum of alcohol-associated liver diseases (ALD), to gauge 
the health and economic burden due to ALD for the national capital territory of 
Delhi, from March 2017 to February 2018. The health impact was estimated through 
Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLL), and total 
deaths due to ALD. The economic burden of ALD was assessed assuming the current 
health-seeking preferences and assuming that all the diseased individuals are 
cared for in the public health systems. Sensitivity analysis was done by Monte 
Carlo simulations.
RESULTS: Total number of estimated deaths due to ALD in the national capital 
territory of Delhi for one year period from March 2017 was 8367. The DALYs due 
to ALD were estimated to be 0.247 million life years; this includes 0.178 
million YLL and 0.069 million life years lost due to disability. The total cost 
of treating ALD was estimated to be 92.94 billion Indian rupees, if patients 
sought care based on current preferences and 55.52 billion Indian rupees if all 
diseased individuals were cared for in public health systems. The total excise 
revenue due to alcohol to the Government is being Indian rupees 43.1 billion in 
the said year.
CONCLUSION: The high burden of ALD in terms of lives lost, DALYs lost, and more 
than two times higher estimated expense for care than the revenue generation due 
to alcohol clearly indicates that it would be prudent to initiate social 
engineering and preventive strategies to lessen the growing burden of ALD in 
India. The Delhi model for health and economic burden of ALD could help the 
country develop policies for better health outcomes of these patients.

INTRODUCTION: Hybrid closed loop (HCL) insulin pump systems and intermittently 
scanned continuous glucose monitoring (IS-CGM) are increasingly used by 
individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The aim of the analysis was to compare 
the long-term cost-effectiveness of the MiniMed 670G HCL system versus IS-CGM 
plus multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous 
insulin infusion (CSII) in adults with T1D in the Netherlands.
METHODS: The analysis was performed using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model with 
clinical input data sourced from observational studies. Simulated patients were 
assumed to have a baseline HbA1c of 7.8%. Use of the MiniMed 670G system was 
assumed to reduce HbA1c by 0.4% and confer a quality-of-life (QoL) benefit 
through reduced fear of hypoglycemia (FoH). The analysis was performed from a 
societal perspective over a lifetime time horizon; future costs and clinical 
outcomes pertaining to the Netherlands were used and discounted at 4% and 1.5% 
per annum, respectively.
RESULTS: Use of the MiniMed 670G HCL system was projected to improve mean 
quality-adjusted life expectancy by 2.231 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
versus IS-CGM. Total mean lifetime costs were EUR 13,683 higher with the MiniMed 
670G system resulting in an ICER of EUR 6133 per QALY gained. Sensitivity 
analyses revealed findings to be sensitive to changes in assumptions around 
severe hypoglycemic event rates and the (QoL) benefit associated with reduced 
FoH.
CONCLUSIONS: Over patient lifetimes, for adults with long-standing T1D in the 
Netherlands, use of the MiniMed 670G system is projected to be cost-effective 
versus IS-CGM plus MDI or CSII.

With the advances in modern medicine and the adaptation towards healthier 
lifestyles, the average life expectancy has doubled since the 1930s, with 
individuals born in the millennium years now carrying an estimated life 
expectancy of around 100 years. And even though many individuals around the 
globe manage to age successfully, the prevalence of aging-associated 
neurodegenerative diseases such as sporadic Alzheimer's disease has never been 
as high as nowadays. The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease is anticipated to 
triple by 2050, increasing the societal and economic burden tremendously. 
Despite all efforts, there is still no available treatment defeating the 
accelerated aging process as seen in this disease. Yet, given the advances in 
neuroimaging techniques that are discussed in the current Review article, such 
as in positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
pivotal insights into the heterogenous effects of aging-associated processes and 
the contribution of distinct lifestyle and risk factors already have and are 
still being gathered. In particular, the concepts of resilience (i.e. coping 
with brain pathology) and resistance (i.e. avoiding brain pathology) have more 
recently been discussed as they relate to mechanisms that are associated with 
the prolongation and/or even stop of the progressive brain aging process. Better 
understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resilience and resistance may one 
day, hopefully, support the identification of defeating mechanism against 
accelerating aging.

BACKGROUND: Suboptimal maternal health already from preconception onwards is 
strongly linked to an increased risk of birth complications. To enable 
identification of women at risk of birth complications, we aimed to develop a 
prediction model for birth complications using maternal preconception 
socio-demographic, lifestyle, medical history and early-pregnancy clinical 
characteristics in a general population.
METHODS: In a population-based prospective cohort study among 8340 women, we 
obtained information on 33 maternal characteristics at study enrolment in 
early-pregnancy. These characteristics covered the preconception period and 
first half of pregnancy (< 21 weeks gestation). Preterm birth was < 37 weeks 
gestation. Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) 
at birth were gestational-age-adjusted birthweight in the lowest or highest 
decile, respectively. Because of their co-occurrence, preterm birth and SGA were 
combined into a composite outcome.
RESULTS: The basic preconception model included easy obtainable maternal 
characteristics in the preconception period including age, ethnicity, parity, 
body mass index and smoking. This basic preconception model had an area under 
the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.63 (95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.61 to 0.65) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.66) for preterm birth/SGA 
and LGA, respectively. Further extension to more complex models by adding 
maternal socio-demographic, lifestyle, medical history and early-pregnancy 
clinical characteristics led to small, statistically significant improved 
models. The full model for prediction of preterm birth/SGA had an AUC 0.66 (95% 
CI 0.64 to 0.67) with a sensitivity of 22% at a 90% specificity. The full model 
for prediction of LGA had an AUC of 0.67 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.69) with sensitivity 
of 28% at a 90% specificity. The developed models had a reasonable level of 
calibration within highly different socio-economic subsets of our population and 
predictive performance for various secondary maternal, delivery and neonatal 
complications was better than for primary outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Prediction of birth complications is limited when using maternal 
preconception and early-pregnancy characteristics, which can easily be obtained 
in clinical practice. Further improvement of the developed models and subsequent 
external validation is needed.

BACKGROUND: Denmark and Israel both have highly rated and well-performing 
healthcare systems with marked differences in funding and organization of 
primary healthcare. Although better population health outcomes are seen in 
Israel, Denmark has a substantially higher healthcare expenditure. This has 
caused Danish policy makers to take an interest in Israeli community care 
organization. Consequently, we aim to provide a more detailed insight into 
differences between the two countries' healthcare organization and cost, as well 
as health outcomes.
METHODS: A comparative analysis combining data from OECD, WHO, and official 
sources. World Health Organization (WHO) and the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) statistics were used, and national official 
sources were procured from the two healthcare systems. Literature searches were 
performed in areas relevant to expenditure and outcome. Data were compared on 
health care expenditure and selected outcome measures. Expenditure was presented 
as purchasing power parity and as percentage of gross domestic product, both 
with and without adjustment for population age, and both including and excluding 
long-term care expenditure.
RESULTS: Denmark's healthcare expenditure is higher than Israel's. However, 
corrected for age and long-term care the difference diminishes. Life expectancy 
is lower in Denmark than in Israel, and Israel has a significantly better 
outcome regarding cancer as well as a lower number of Years of Potential Life 
Lost. Israelis have a healthier lifestyle, in particular a much lower alcohol 
consumption.
CONCLUSION: Attempting to correct for what we deemed to be the most important 
influencing factors, age and different inclusions of long-term care costs, the 
Israeli healthcare system still seems to be 25% less expensive, compared to the 
Danish one, and with better health outcomes. This is not necessarily a function 
of the Israeli healthcare system but may to a great extent be explained by 
cultural factors, mainly a much lower Israeli alcohol consumption.

OBJECTIVES: The machine learning prediction model Pacmed Critical (PC), 
currently under development, may guide intensivists in their decision-making 
process on the most appropriate time to discharge a patient from the intensive 
care unit (ICU). Given the financial pressure on healthcare budgets, this study 
assessed whether PC has the potential to be cost-effective compared with 
standard care, without the use of PC, for Dutch patients in the ICU from a 
societal perspective.
METHODS: A 1-year, 7-state Markov model reflecting the ICU care pathway and 
incorporating the PC decision tool was developed. A hypothetical cohort of 1000 
adult Dutch patients admitted in the ICU was entered in the model. We used the 
literature, expert opinion, and data from Amsterdam University Medical Center 
for model parameters. The uncertainty surrounding the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses.
RESULTS: PC was a cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of €18 507 per quality-adjusted life-year. PC remained cost-effective over 
standard care in multiple scenarios and sensitivity analyses. The likelihood 
that PC will be cost-effective was 71% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
€30 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. The key driver of the results was the 
parameter "reduction in ICU length of stay."
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that PC has the potential to be cost-effective for Dutch 
ICUs in a time horizon of 1 year. This study is one of the first 
cost-effectiveness analyses of a machine learning device. Further research is 
needed to validate the effectiveness of PC, thereby focusing on the key 
parameter "reduction in ICU length of stay" and potential spill-over effects.

OBJECTIVES: Evidence-informed priority setting, in particular cost-effectiveness 
analysis (CEA), can help target resources better to achieve universal health 
coverage. Central to the application of CEA is the use of a cost-effectiveness 
threshold. We add to the literature by looking at what thresholds have been used 
in published CEA and the proportion of interventions found to be cost-effective, 
by type of threshold.
METHODS: We identified CEA studies in low- and middle-income countries from the 
Global Health Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry that were published between 
January 1, 2015, and January 6, 2020. We extracted data on the country of focus, 
type of interventions under consideration, funder, threshold used, and 
recommendations.
RESULTS: A total of 230 studies with a total 713 interventions were included in 
this review; 1 to 3× gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was the most common 
type of threshold used in judging cost-effectiveness (84.3%). Approximately a 
third of studies (34.2%) using 1 to 3× GDP per capita applied a threshold at 3× 
GDP per capita. We have found that no study used locally developed thresholds. 
We found that 79.3% of interventions received a recommendation as 
"cost-effective" and that 85.9% of studies had at least 1 intervention that was 
considered cost-effective. The use of 1 to 3× GDP per capita led to a higher 
proportion of study interventions being judged as cost-effective compared with 
other types of thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the wide concerns about the use of 1 to 3× GDP per capita, 
this threshold is still widely used in the literature. Using this threshold 
leads to more interventions being recommended as "cost-effective." This study 
further explore alternatives to the 1 to 3× GDP as a decision rule.

OBJECTIVES: Adjuvant chemotherapy is not recommended for patients with 
average-risk stage II (T3N0) colon cancer. Nevertheless, a subgroup of these 
patients who are CDX2-negative might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. We 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of testing for the absence of CDX2 expression 
followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (fluorouracil combined with oxaliplatin 
[FOLFOX]) for patients with stage II colon cancer.
METHODS: We developed a decision model to simulate a hypothetical cohort of 
65-year-old patients with average-risk stage II colon cancer with 7.2% of these 
patients being CDX2-negative under 2 different interventions: (1) test for the 
absence of CDX2 expression followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for CDX2-negative 
patients and (2) no CDX2 testing and no adjuvant chemotherapy for any patient. 
We derived disease progression parameters, adjuvant chemotherapy effectiveness 
and utilities from published analyses, and cancer care costs from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data. Sensitivity 
analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Testing for CDX2 followed by FOLFOX for CDX2-negative patients had an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $5500/quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) compared with no CDX2 testing and no FOLFOX (6.874 vs 6.838 discounted 
QALYs and $89 991 vs $89 797 discounted US dollar lifetime costs). In 
sensitivity analyses, considering a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
$100 000/QALY, testing for CDX2 followed by FOLFOX on CDX2-negative patients 
remains cost-effective for hazard ratios of <0.975 of the effectiveness of 
FOLFOX in CDX2-negative patients in reducing the rate of developing a metastatic 
recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Testing tumors of patients with stage II colon cancer for CDX2 and 
administration of adjuvant treatment to the subgroup found CDX2-negative is a 
cost-effective and high-value management strategy across a broad range of 
plausible assumptions.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the extent and quality of evidence from 
economic evaluations (EEs) of genetic-guided pharmacotherapy (PGx) for atrial 
fibrillation (AF) and to identify variables influential in changing base-case 
conclusions.
METHODS: From systematic searches, we included EEs of existing PGx testing to 
guide pharmacotherapy for AF, without restrictions on population characteristics 
or language. Articles excluded were genetic tests used to guide device-based 
therapy or focused on animals.
RESULTS: We found 18 EEs (46 comparisons), all model-based cost-utility analysis 
with or without cost-effectiveness analysis mostly from health system's 
perspectives, of PGx testing to determine coumadin/direct-acting anticoagulant 
(DOAC) dosing (14 of 18), to stratify patients into coumadin/DOACs (3 of 18), or 
to increase patients' adherence to coumadin (1 of 18) versus non-PGx. Most PGx 
to determine coumadin dosing found PGx more costly and more effective than 
standard or clinical coumadin dosing (19 of 24 comparisons) but less costly and 
less effective than standard DOAC dosing (14 of 14 comparisons). The remaining 
comparisons were too few to observe any trend. Of 61 variables influential in 
changing base-case conclusions, effectiveness of PGx testing was the most common 
(37%), accounted for in the models using time-based or medication-based 
approaches or relative risk. The cost of PGx testing has decreased and plateaued 
over time.
CONCLUSIONS: EEs to date only partially inform decisions on selecting optimal 
PGx testing for AF, because most evidence focuses on PGx testing to determine 
coumadin dosing, but less on other purposes. Future EE may refer to the list of 
influential variables and the approaches used to account for the effect of PGx 
testing to inform data collection and study design.

A wide variety of novel non-thermal processing technologies (NTPTs) are under 
development to meet the increasing consumer demand for high-quality fruit and 
vegetable (F&V) products. Understanding consumers' needs and possible barriers 
to acceptance of these technologies is however essential to assess the 
commercial feasibility of mildly processed F&Vs. Situated within this context, 
and extending previous work on the topic, in this paper we present results from 
a large-scale choice-based conjoint analysis consumer survey to investigate 
consumers' choice behavior towards NTPT-processed F&V products in four European 
countries - Denmark, Italy, Serbia, and Spain, using three model products - 
orange juice, iceberg salad, and cherry tomatoes respectively processed via 
three NTPT - mild processing, novel washing, and active packaging, compared to 
three conventional processing techniques - pasteurization, conventional washing, 
and conventional packaging, respectively. Images of the three product categories 
were developed to systematically vary in three key attributes: stated benefits 
(health and nutrition, natural taste, shelf-life), information on processing 
(conventional, NTPT), and price point (reference, premium price). The results 
showed that, out of the three attributes considered, "stated benefit" was the 
most important driver of consumer choice - in all countries and across product 
categories. Benefits relevant to health and nutrition, and to natural taste were 
more positively received, compared to extension of shelf-life. Information on 
processing and price levels had a similar influence on consumer choice of 
iceberg salad and cherry tomatoes, whilst for orange juice processing had a 
larger effect than price, suggesting that information on processing may be more 
impactful for F&V-derived products than for fresh produce. Individual 
differences among consumers according to country, age, gender, and dietary 
status, appeared small and transient. The most consequential individual 
characteristic was consumers' level of food technology neophobia (FTN), with 
results showing that high FTN consumers (17% of the sample) were less likely to 
choose F&V treated with NTPT, compared to consumers with medium or low FTN. 
Overall, this research suggests that products treated with NTPT may have a broad 
appeal across European consumers, and that targeted communication explicitly and 
efficiently focusing on health and taste benefits has the greatest chance to 
meet consumer preferences.

INTRODUCTION: The heightened risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality in prisons 
is well documented, but COVID-19's impact on all-cause mortality in incarcerated 
populations has not yet been studied. This study analyzed mortality records from 
the Florida State Department of Corrections prison system population to evaluate 
the impact COVID-19 had on all-cause mortality and compare mortality rates and 
life expectancy with that of the overall state of Florida population.
METHODS: Population age and sex data for Florida State Department of Corrections 
were ascertained from the Florida State Department of Corrections Offender Based 
Information System. Death data by age, sex, and cause of death were acquired 
from medical records and Florida State Department of Corrections offender 
reports. The state of Florida demographic and death data were collected from the 
Census Bureau, Florida Department of Health, and Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. Age- and sex-standardized life table measures were calculated, and 
COVID-19 contributions to changes in life expectancy were assessed using 
Arriaga's decomposition.
RESULTS: The standardized mortality rate in the Florida State Department of 
Corrections population increased by 45% between 2019 and 2020, causing an 
overall 4.0-year decline in life expectancy. Over the same period, the state of 
Florida population's standardized mortality increased by 19%, resulting in an 
overall 2.7-year decline. Within the Florida State Department of Corrections 
population, life expectancy decline could be attributed exclusively to COVID-19 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The state of Florida prison population saw a substantial increase 
in mortality driven solely by COVID-19 mortality, leading to an overall 4-year 
decline in life expectancy. Given the findings and continued threat of COVID-19 
outbreaks, Florida State Department of Corrections and other prison systems 
should strive to increase vaccination uptake, decrease prison populations, and 
commit to COVID-19 data transparency.

OBJECTIVES: This article aims to describe the generation and selection of items 
(stage 2) and face validation (stage 3) of a large international (multilingual) 
project to develop a new generic measure, the EQ-HWB (EQ Health and Wellbeing), 
for use in economic evaluation across health, social care, and public health to 
estimate quality-adjusted life-years.
METHODS: Items from commonly used generic, carer, social care, and mental health 
quality of life measures were mapped onto domains or subdomains identified from 
a literature review. Potential terms and items were reviewed and refined to 
ensure coverage of the construct of the domains/subdomain (stage 2). Input on 
the potential item pool, response options, and recall period was sought from 3 
key stakeholder groups. The pool of candidate items was tested in qualitative 
interviews with potential future users in an international face validation study 
(stage 3).
RESULTS: Stage 2 resulted in the generation of 687 items. Predetermined 
selection criteria were applied by the research team resulting in 598 items 
being dropped, leaving 89 items that were reviewed by key stakeholder groups. 
Face validation (stage 3) tested 97 draft items and 4 response scales. A total 
of 47 items were retained and 14 were modified, whereas 3 were added to the 
candidate pool of items. This resulted in a 64-item set.
CONCLUSIONS: This international multiculture, multilingual study with a common 
methodology identified many items that performed well across all countries. 
These were taken to the psychometric testing along with modified and new items 
for the EQ-HWB.

PURPOSE: Genomic screening for Lynch syndrome (LS) could prevent colorectal 
cancer (CRC) by identifying high-risk patients and instituting intensive CRC 
screening. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of a population-wide LS genomic 
screening vs family history-based screening alone in an unselected US 
population.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic Markov model including health states 
for precancer, stage-specific CRC, and death and assumed an inexpensive test 
cost of $200. We conducted sensitivity and threshold analyses to evaluate model 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: Screening unselected 30-year-olds for LS variants resulted in 48 (95% 
credible range [CR] = 35-63) fewer overall CRC cases per 100,000 screened 
individuals, leading to 187 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 95% CR = 
123-260) gained at an incremental cost of $24.6 million (95% CR = $20.3 
million-$29.1 million). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $132,200, 
with an 8% and 71% probability of being cost-effective at $100,000 and $150,000 
per QALY willingness-to-pay thresholds, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Population LS screening may be cost-effective in younger patient 
populations under a $150,000 willingness-to-pay per QALY threshold and with a 
relatively inexpensive test cost. Further reductions in testing costs and/or the 
inclusion of LS testing within a broader multiplex screening panel are needed 
for screening to become highly cost-effective.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Nonadherence to medical regimens increases the risk of 
graft loss among adolescent and young adult recipients of kidney transplants. 
Interventions that improve adherence may decrease rejection rates, but their 
perceived costs are a barrier to clinical implementation. We developed a model 
to assess the cost-effectiveness of an adherence promotion strategy, the 
Medication Adherence Promotion System (MAPS).
STUDY DESIGN: Simulation-based. Data sources included published articles indexed 
in Medline or referenced in bibliographies of relevant English-language 
articles. Data on costs and outcomes were taken from a single clinical center.
SETTING & POPULATION: US adolescent patients after their first kidney 
transplant.
INTERVENTION: Usual posttransplant care versus usual care plus MAPS.
OUTCOME: Effectiveness measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs 
measured in 2020 US dollars.
MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: Markov state transition decision model. We used 
a health care system perspective with a lifelong time horizon.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, MAPS was more effective and less costly than 
usual care. MAPS cost $9,106 per patient less than usual care and resulted in a 
gain of 0.32 QALYs. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, MAPS was cost saving 
100% of the time. Extending results to a program level with 100 patients, any 
adherence promotion intervention similar in effectiveness to MAPS would cost 
less than $50,000/QALY if the start-up costs were <$2.5 million and annual 
costs <$188,000. Strategies with costs similar to MAPS that reduce the risk of 
rejection by as little as 3% would also have similar cost-effectiveness.
LIMITATIONS: Estimates of components and costs for MAPS were based on a single 
center.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence promotion strategies with costs similar to MAPS can be 
cost-effective as long as they reduce rejection rates by at least 3%. This model 
can be applied to study the cost-effectiveness of adherence promotion strategies 
with varying costs and outcomes.
