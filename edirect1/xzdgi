RESULTS: The average resection length was 110 mm (80-154) and the average 
follow-up was 106.7 months (65-141). Bone union achieved in all patients with an 
average duration of 7.6 months (5-10). The average HHS, MSTS score and gluteus 
medius strength at one-year follow-up were 88.0 (80-94), 25.2 (22-28) and 4 
(3-5), respectively. While at the last follow-up, the HHS, MSTS score and 
gluteus medius strength were 83.0 (48-100), 24.0 (10-30) and 4 (2-5), 
respectively. Five intraoperative fractures were fixed with cerclage wires. Two 
postoperative periprosthetic and prosthetic fractures received a revision. Three 
local recurrent patients received a secondary surgery. One of these three lung 
metastatic patients underwent lung metastatic tumor resection. Another two 
patients were diagnosed with both bone and lung metastases, only one of them 
underwent amputation. Two greater trochanteric fractures received no treatment. 
There were10 severe, 3 moderate and 5 mild allograft resorptions without 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: Uncemented APC is a reliable reconstruction for neoplastic bone 
defect of the proximal femur, especially for the young patient who expected 
long-life expectancy and good function. Though allograft resorption and 
trochanteric fracture are the common complications, they seem no effect on the 
function.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether a single high dose of oral cholecalciferol 
improves the respiratory outcomes as compared with placebo among adults COVID-19 
patients at moderate risk of clinical complications.
TRIAL DESIGN: The CARED trial is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, 
randomized, parallel, two-arm, sequential, double-blind and placebo-controlled 
clinical trial. It was planned as a pragmatic trial since the inclusion criteria 
are broad and the study procedures are as simple as possible, in order to be 
implemented in the routine clinical practice in general wards in the pandemic 
setting and a middle-income country context. The sequential design involves two 
stages. The first stage will assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on 
blood oxygenation (physiological effects). The second stage will assess the 
effects on clinical outcomes.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants of either gender admitted to general adult wards in 
21 hospital sites located in four provinces of Argentina are invited to 
participate in the study if they meet the following inclusion criteria and none 
of the exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection by 
RT-PCR; Hospital admission at least 24 hours before; Expected hospitalization in 
the same site ≥24 hours; Oxygen saturation ≥90% (measured by pulse oximetry) 
breathing ambient air; Age ≥45 years or at least one of the following 
conditions: ○ Hypertension; ○ Diabetes; ○ At least moderate COPD or asthma; ○ 
Cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction, percutaneous 
transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting or valve 
replacement surgery); ○ Body mass index ≥30; Willingness to sign informed 
consent (online supplementary material 1 and 2).
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Age <18 years; Women in childbearing age; >= 72 hs since 
current admission; Requirement for a high dose of oxygen (>5 litres/minute) or 
mechanical ventilation (non-invasive or invasive); History of chronic kidney 
disease requiring haemodialysis or chronic liver failure; Inability for oral 
intake. Chronic supplementation with pharmacological vitamin D; Current 
treatment with anticonvulsants; History of: ○ Sarcoidosis; ○ Malabsorption 
syndrome; ○ Known hypercalcemia or serum calcium >10.5 mg/dL; Life expectancy <6 
months; Known allergy to study medication; Any condition at discretion of 
investigator impeding to understand the study and give informed consent.
INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The intervention consists in a single oral dose of 
500.000 IU of commercially available cholecalciferol soft gel capsules (5 
capsules of 100.000 IU) or matching placebo MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome 
for the first stage is the change in the respiratory Sepsis-related Organ 
Failure Assessment (SOFAr) score between pre-treatment value and the worst value 
recorded during the first 7 seven days of hospitalization, the death or 
discharge, whichever occurs first. The SOFAr score measured as the ratio between 
the pulse oximetry saturation (SpO2) and FiO2 (27, 28) is used instead of the 
arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). SOFAr score is a 4-points scale, 
with higher values indicating deeper respiratory derangement as follows: 1 PaO2 
<400; 2 PaO2 <300; 3 PaO2 <200; 4 PaO2 <100. The primary outcome for the second 
stage is the combined occurrence of requirement ≥40% of FiO2, invasive or 
non-invasive ventilation, up to 30 days or hospital discharge.
RANDOMISATION: A computer-generated random sequence and the treatment assignment 
is performed through the web-based randomization module available in the 
electronic data capture system (Castor®). A randomization ratio 1:1, stratified 
and with permuted blocks was used. Stratification variables were diabetes 
(yes/no), age (≤60/>60 years) and the site.
BLINDING (MASKING): Double-blind was achieved by using placebo soft gel capsules 
with the same organoleptic properties as the active medication. Central 
management of the medication is carried out by a pharmacist in charge of 
packaging the study drug in unblinded fashion, who have no contact with on-site 
investigators. Medication is packaged in opaque white bottles, each containing 
five soft gel capsules of the active drug or matching placebo, corresponding to 
complete individual treatment. Treatment codes are kept under the pharmacist 
responsibility, and all researchers are unaware of them.
NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The first stage is planned to include 
200 patients (100 per group), the second stage is planned to include 1064 
additional patients. The total sample size is 1264 patients.
TRIAL STATUS: Currently the protocol version is the number 1.4 (from October 
13th, 2020). The recruitment is ongoing since August 11th, 2020, and the first 
subject was enrolled on August 14th. Since then, 21 sites located in four 
provinces of Argentina were initiated, and 167 patients were recruited by 
January 11th, 2021. We anticipate to finish the recruitment for the first stage 
in mid-February, 2021, and in August, 2021 for the second stage.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov 
(identifier number NCT04411446 ) on June 2, 2020.
FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible 
from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest in expediting 
dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated; 
this Letter serves as a summary of the key elements of the full protocol. The

BACKGROUND: The clinical benefits of enhanced recovery programs (ERPs) have been 
extensively researched, but few studies have evaluated their cost-effectiveness. 
Our ERP for open liver resection is based closely on the guidelines produced by 
the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society (2016). This study follows on from a 
previous randomized controlled trial. We also undertook a long-term follow-up of 
the patients enrolled in the original trial alongside an analysis of the 
associated health economics.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to undertake a health economic and long-term survival 
analysis as part of a trial investigating the implementation of an ERP for open 
liver resection.
METHODS: The enhanced recovery elements utilized included extra preoperative 
education, carbohydrate loading, oral nutritional supplements, postresection 
goal-directed fluid therapy (LiDCOrapid), early mobilization, and physiotherapy 
(twice a day compared with once per day in the standard care group). A 
decision-analytic model was used to compare the study endpoints for ERP versus 
standard care provided to patients undergoing open liver resection. Outcomes 
obtained included costs per life-years gained. Resource use and costs were 
estimated from the perspective of the National Health Service of the United 
Kingdom. A decision tree and Markov model were constructed using results from 
our earlier trial and augmented by external data from other published clinical 
trials. Long-term follow-up was also undertaken for up to 5 years after the 
surgery, and data were analyzed to ascertain if the ERP conferred any benefit on 
long-term survival.
RESULTS: Patients receiving ERP had an average life expectancy of 6.9 years 
versus 6.1 years in the standard care group. The overall costs were £9538.279 
(£1=US $1.60) for ERP and £14,793.05 for standard treatment. This results in a 
cost-effectiveness ratio of -£6748.33/QALY. Patients receiving ERP required 
fewer visits to their general practitioner (P=.006) and required lesser help at 
home with day-to-day activities (P=.04) than patients in the standard care 
group. Survival was significantly improved at 2 years at 91% (42/46) for 
patients receiving ERP versus 73% (33/45) for the standard care group (P=.03). 
There was no statistically significant difference at 5 years after the surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: ERPs for patients undergoing open liver resection can improve their 
medium-term survival and are cost-effective for both hospital and community 
settings.

Effects of climate change on vector-borne diseases: an updated focus on West 
Nile virus in humans.

Paz S(1).

Haifa, Israel.

One of the main impacts of climate change on health is the influence on 
vector-borne diseases (VBDs). During the last few years, yearly outbreaks of the 
West Nile virus (WNV) have occurred in many locations, providing evidence of 
ongoing transmission. Currently, it is the most widely distributed arbovirus in 
the world. Increases in ambient temperature have impacts on WNV transmission. 
Indeed, clear associations were found between warm conditions and WNV outbreaks 
in various areas. The impact of changes in rainfall patterns on the incidence of 
the disease is influenced by the amount of precipitation (increased rainfall, 
floods or droughts), depending on the local conditions and the differences in 
the ecology and sensitivity of the species of mosquito. Predictions indicate 
that for WNV, increased warming will result in latitudinal and altitudinal 
expansions of regions climatically suitable for transmission, particularly along 
the current edges of its transmission areas. Extension of the transmission 
season is also predicted. As models show that the current climate change trends 
are expected to continue, it is important to reinforce WNV control efforts and 
increase the resilience of population health. For a better preparedness, any 
assessment of future transmission of WNV should consider the impacts of the 
changing climate.

AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of the hospital-family holistic care model 
based on the theory of 'Timing It Right' in caregivers of patients with 
permanent enterostomy.
DESIGN: A prospective randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five caregivers of patients with permanent 
enterostomy were recruited from 1 May 2017-31 August 2019. They were randomized 
into either intervention group (N = 62) or control group (N = 63). The control 
group received routine care and follow-up, while the intervention group received 
routine care, follow-up, and hospital-family holistic care intervention based on 
'Timing It Right'. The care ability, psychological distress, and life quality of 
the caregivers were evaluated between the groups before the intervention, at 
discharge, and 3 and 6 months after discharge.
RESULTS: One hundred and eleven caregivers completed the study (88.8%). At 3 and 
6 months after discharge, the care ability and life quality in the intervention 
group were significantly better than those in the control group 
(t = 8.506/9.783, t = 22.652/26.179, p < 0.05) based on the t tests, and the 
psychological distress was lower than that in the control group. The ostomy 
adaptability of the control group was significantly lower than that in the 
intervention group (p < 0.001) based on the t tests, and the χ2 test showed that 
ostomy complication was more than that in the intervention group (23.81% vs. 
12.90% and 34.92% vs. 19.35%; p < 0.05) at 3 and 6 months after discharge. The 
interaction between time and group showed that the effect of time factor varied 
with the group and the four evaluation indexes in the intervention group 
gradually improved with the extension of the observation time and were better 
than those in the control group based on generalized estimating equation model.
CONCLUSION: The hospital-family holistic care model based on 'Timing It Right' 
can effectively improve the care ability of caregivers of patients with 
permanent enterostomy, reduce psychological distress, and improve the quality of 
life.
IMPACT: The caregivers of patients with permanent enterostomy showed dynamic 
changes in their care experience and needs at different stages of the disease. 
The hospital-family holistic care intervention strategy based on 'Timing It 
Right' can effectively improve the caregiver's care ability, alleviate 
psychological distress, and improve the quality of life. Additionally, improving 
the patients' stoma adaptability and reducing the incidence of complications 
related to ostomy.

785. Patient Positioning During a Hypotensive Episode for Adults Undergoing 
Hemodialysis: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Guidelines [Internet].

Li Y, Wright MD.

Ottawa (ON): Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2020 Sep 28.
CADTH Rapid Response Reports.

Renal disease affects one in ten Canadians with approximately 50,000 Canadians 
who received treatment for renal failure in 2019. In 2014, 20,690 Canadians were 
on dialysis costing approximately $1.9 billion annually. Dialysis is typically 
indicated for patients with end stage renal failure who have about 15% of renal 
function remaining. On average, patients receiving dialysis have a life 
expectancy of five to ten years unless they undergo kidney transplantation. By 
filtering waste and removing excess fluid from a patient’s blood, hemodialysis 
helps to maintain electrolyte balance and blood pressure. Nonetheless, 
hemodialysis may be associated with intradialytic complications such as nausea, 
vomiting, cramps, headache, itching, and hypotension. Intradialytic hypotension 
(IDH) is defined as a decrease of ≥20 millimetres of mercury (mm Hg) in systolic 
blood pressure or a decrease of ≥10 mm Hg in mean arterial pressure accompanied 
by clinical manifestations requiring intervention. IDH may be caused by cardiac 
factors, a reduction in fluid volume, and inability to vasoconstrict. Risk 
factors for IDH may include high body mass index, female sex, pre-dialysis 
systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg, age > 65 years, and comorbidities such as 
diabetes and ischemic heart disease. Strategies to help prevent recurrent 
episodes of IDH may include target weight reassessment, food avoidance during 
dialysis sessions, limiting sodium intake to minimize interdialytic weight gain, 
and using cool dialysate., During an acute episode of IDH, interventions may 
include slowing or stopping ultrafiltration, administering intravenous fluids 
and oxygen, and placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position where their 
feet are raised higher than their head. By promoting blood flow from the legs to 
the heart through gravity and increasing venous return, this patient position 
may help increase cardiac output and blood pressure. The aim of this report is 
to summarize and critically appraise the relevant clinical evidence and 
evidence-based guidelines regarding the effectiveness and use of Trendelenburg 
patient positioning during a hypotensive episode for adults undergoing 
hemodialysis.

A Potential Role for Aminoacylation in Primordial RNA Copying Chemistry.

Aminoacylated tRNAs are the substrates for ribosomal protein synthesis in all 
branches of life, implying an ancient origin for aminoacylation chemistry. In 
the 1970s, Orgel and colleagues reported potentially prebiotic routes to 
aminoacylated nucleotides and their RNA-templated condensation to form amino 
acid-bridged dinucleotides. However, it is unclear whether such reactions would 
have aided or impeded non-enzymatic RNA replication. Determining whether 
aminoacylated RNAs could have been advantageous in evolution prior to the 
emergence of protein synthesis remains a key challenge. We therefore tested the 
ability of aminoacylated RNA to participate in both templated primer extension 
and ligation reactions. We find that at low magnesium concentrations that favor 
fatty acid-based protocells, these reactions proceed orders of magnitude more 
rapidly than when initiated from the cis-diol of unmodified RNA. We further 
demonstrate that amino acid-bridged RNAs can act as templates in a subsequent 
round of copying. Our results suggest that aminoacylation facilitated 
non-enzymatic RNA replication, thus outlining a potentially primordial 
functional link between aminoacylation chemistry and RNA replication.

Reducing the required frequence of drug dosing can improve the adherence of 
patients to chronic treatments. Hence, drugs with longer in vivo half-lives are 
highly desirable. One of the most promising approaches to extend the in vivo 
half-life of drugs is conjugation to human serum albumin (HSA). In this work, we 
describe the use of AlbuBinder 1, a small-molecule noncovalent HSA binder, to 
extend the in vivo half-life and pharmacology of small-molecule BMP1/TLL 
inhibitors in humanized mice (HSA KI/KI). A series of conjugates of AlbuBinder 1 
with BMP1/TLL inhibitors were prepared. In particular, conjugate c showed good 
solubility and a half-life extension of >20-fold versus the parent molecule in 
the HSA KI/KI mice, reaching half-lives of >48 h with maintained maximal 
inhibition of plasma BMP1/TLL. The same conjugate showed a half-life of only 3 h 
in the wild-type mice, suggesting that the half-life extension was principally 
due to specific interactions with HSA. It is envisioned that conjugation to 
AlbuBinder 1 should be applicable to a wide range of small molecule or peptide 
drugs with short half-lives. In this context, AlbuBinders represent a viable 
alternative to existing half-life extension technologies.

OBJECTIVE: This pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) aimed to compare the effectiveness, safety, and cost-utility of a 
custom-made knee brace versus usual care over 1 year in medial knee 
osteoarthritis (OA).
DESIGN: 120 patients with medial knee OA (VAS pain at rest >40/100), classified 
as Kellgren-Lawrence grade II-IV, were randomized into two groups: ODRA plus 
usual care (ODRA group) and usual care alone (UCA group). The primary 
effectiveness outcome was the change in VAS pain between M0 and M12. Secondary 
outcomes included changes over 1 year in KOOS (function) and OAKHQOL (quality of 
life) scores. Drug consumption, compliance, safety of the knee brace, and 
cost-utility over 1 year were also assessed.
RESULTS: The ODRA group was associated with a higher improvement in: VAS pain 
(adjusted mean difference of -11.8; 95% CI: -21.1 to -2.5); all KOOS subscales 
(pain: +8.8; 95% CI: 1.4-16.2); other symptoms (+10.4; 95% CI: 2.7-18); function 
in activities of daily living (+9.2; 95% CI: 1.1-17.2); function in sports and 
leisure (+12.3; 95% CI: 4.3-20.3); quality of life (+9.9; 95% CI: 0.9-15.9), 
OAKHQOL subscales (pain: +14.8; 95% CI: 5.0-24.6); and physical activities 
(+8.2; 95% CI: 0.6-15.8), and with a significant decrease in analgesics 
consumption at M12 compared with the UCA group. Despite localized side-effects, 
observance was good at M12 (median: 5.3 h/day). The ODRA group had a more than 
85% chance of being cost-effective for a willingness-to-pay threshold of €45 000 
per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The ERGONOMIE RCT demonstrated significant clinical benefits of an 
unloader custom-made knee brace in terms of improvements in pain, function, and 
some aspects of quality of life over 1 year in medial knee OA, as well as its 
potential cost-utility from a societal perspective.

BACKGROUND: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common chronic progressive 
disease resulting in urinary obstruction in aging men. It comes to more and more 
patients with massive BPH with the aging of society and extension of life 
expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the clinical efficacy, safety, 
and complications between transurethral bipolar plasmakinetic enucleation of the 
prostate (PKEP) and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in the 
treatment of massive BPH.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Patients with BPH were divided into the PKEP group and the 
TURP group randomly. Intraoperative blood loss (BL), operation time (OT), 
resected tissue weight (RTW), gland resection ratio (GRR), postoperative 
indwelling ureter time (IUT), bladder fistula time (BFT) and hospital stay time 
(HST), preoperative and postoperative serum sodium concentration (SSC), 
hemoglobin concentration (HGB), prostate weight (PW), postvoid residual (PVR), 
maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), international prostate symptom score (IPSS), 
quality of life (QOL), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and 
other complications were analyzed and compared respectively.
RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in preoperative IPSS, preoperative 
QOL score, preoperative PVR, preoperative Qmax, postoperative QOL score, 
postoperative PVR, postoperative Qmax, IPSS difference value (DV), Qmax DV, and 
PVR DV between the PKEP group and the TURP group (p > 0.05). OT, BL, IUT, BFT, 
HST, and postoperative IPSS in the PKEP group were significantly lower than that 
in the TURP group (p < 0.01). RTW and GRR in the PKEP group were significantly 
higher than that in the TURP group (p < 0.01). QOL DV in the PKEP group was 
higher than that in the TURP group (p < 0.05). There was statistical difference 
in SSC DV between the PKEP group and the TURP group (p < 0.05). There was 
significant statistical difference in postoperative PW, postoperative HGB, PW 
DV, and HGB DV between the PKEP group and the TURP group (p < 0.01). There was 
significant statistical difference in IPSS, QOL, PVR, and Qmax between 
postoperative value and preoperative value in both groups (p < 0.01). The 
incidence of transurethral resection syndrome, obturator nerve reflex, transient 
urinary incontinence, and retrograde ejaculation between the PKEP group and the 
TURP group has no statistical difference (p > 0.05). Capsule perforation, blood 
transfusion, secondary hemorrhage, bladder neck contracture, and urethral 
stricture in the PKEP group were lower than that in the TURP group (p < 0.05). 
Bladder spasm in the PKEP group was significantly lower than that in the TURP 
group (p < 0.01). There was no statistical difference in preoperative and 
postoperative IIEF-5, effective erectile frequency, telotism average tension, 
sustainable telotism average time, and sexual dissatisfaction between the PKEP 
group and the TURP group (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: PKEP and TURP have similar clinical efficacy in the treatment of 
massive BPH. PKEP has advantages in shorter OT, less BL, more GRR, and fewer 
complications, but the long-term therapeutic effect of PKEP needs further 
follow-up.

We analyzed whether male Spanish elite soccer players live longer than the 
general population. Secondly, we compared their mortality with a cohort of 
soccer players who continued working as soccer elite coaches after retirement. 
Using age and calendar-date adjusted life tables, we analyzed the mortality 
hazard ratio of 1333 Spanish male players born before 1950, and who played in 
elite leagues from 1939, compared with the Spanish population. Using Cox 
proportional hazards model we compared their mortality with a cohort of 413 
players who continued as coaches. Players showed significantly lower mortality 
than the general population, but this advantage decreased with advanced age, 
disappearing after 80 years. Coaches showed a similar pattern. Comparing players 
versus coaches, date of birth and years as professional were associated with 
survival, but debut age and player position were not. Unadjusted median survival 
time was 79.81 years (IQR 72.37-85.19) for players and 81.8 years (IQR 
74.55-86.73) for coaches. Kaplan-Meier estimator adjusted for covariables showed 
no difference between cohorts (p=0.254). In conclusion, former Spanish male 
players showed lower mortality than the general population, but this effect 
disappeared after 80 years of age. Continuing their career as coaches after 
retirement from playing did not confer major benefits.

Mediterranean-Type Dietary Pattern and Physical Activity: The Winning 
Combination to Counteract the Rising Burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs).

IRCCS, 20139 Milano, Italy.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (mainly cardiovascular diseases, cancers, 
chronic respiratory diseases and type 2 diabetes) are the main causes of death 
worldwide. Their burden is expected to rise in the future, especially in less 
developed economies and among the poor spread across middle- and high-income 
countries. Indeed, the treatment and prevention of these pathologies constitute 
a crucial challenge for public health. The major non-communicable diseases share 
four modifiable behavioral risk factors: unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, 
tobacco usage and excess of alcohol consumption. Therefore, the adoption of 
healthy lifestyles, which include not excessive alcohol intake, no smoking, a 
healthy diet and regular physical activity, represents a crucial and economical 
strategy to counteract the global NCDs burden. This review summarizes the latest 
evidence demonstrating that Mediterranean-type dietary pattern and physical 
activity are, alone and in combination, key interventions to both prevent and 
control the rise of NCDs.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
OBJECTIVES: Although the role of surgery in the management of metastatic spinal 
cord compression (MSCC) has been well established, elderly patients may still be 
denied surgery because of higher risk of complications and shorter life 
expectancy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether elderly patients 
with MSCC could benefit from surgery and discuss the criteria for surgical 
decision-making in such patients.
METHODS: Enrolled in this study were 55 consecutive patients aged 75 years or 
older who were surgically treated for MSCC in our center. Prognostic factors 
predicting overall survival (OS) were explored by the Kaplan-Meier method and 
Cox regression model. The quality of life (QoL) of the patients was evaluated by 
the SOSGOQ and compared using Student's t test. Risk factors for postoperative 
complications were identified by Chi-square test and multiple logistic 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: Surgical treatment for MSCC substantially improved the neurological 
function in 55.8% patients and QoL in 88.5% patients with acceptable rates of 
postoperative complications (16.4%), reoperation (9.1%), and 30-day mortality 
(1.8%). Postoperative ECOG-PS of 1-2, total en-bloc spondylectomy (TES), and 
postoperative chemotherapy were favorable prognostic factors for OS, while a 
high Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and a long operation time were risk 
factors for postoperative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery should be encouraged for elderly patients with MSCC 1) who 
are compromised by the current or potential neurological dysfunction; 2) with 
radioresistant tumors; 3) with spinal instability; and 4) with no comorbidity, 
ECOG-PS of 0-2, and systemic treatment adherence. In addition, surgery should be 
performed by a skilled and experienced surgical team.

BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes (T1D, named insulin-dependent diabetes) has a 
relatively rapid onset and significantly decreases life expectancy. This study 
is conducted to reveal the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA 
regulatory axises implicated in T1D.
METHODS: The gene expression profile under GSE55100 (GPL570 and GPL8786 
datasets; including 12 T1D samples and 10 normal samples for each dataset) was 
extracted from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Using limma package, the 
differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNAs), miRNAs (DE-miRNAs), and lncRNAs 
(DE-lncRNAs) between T1D and normal samples were analyzed. For the DE-mRNAs, the 
functional terms were enriched by DAVID tool, and the significant pathways were 
enriched using gene set enrichment analysis. The interactions among DE-lncRNAs, 
DE-miRNAs and DE-mRNAs were predicted using mirwalk and starbase. The 
lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network analysis was visualized by Cytoscape. The 
key genes in the interaction network were verified by quantitatively real-time 
PCR.
RESULTS: In comparison to normal samples, 236 DE-mRNAs, 184 DE-lncRNAs, and 45 
DE-miRNAs in T1D samples were identified. For the 236 DE-mRNAs, 16 Gene Ontology 
(GO)_biological process (BP) terms, four GO_cellular component (CC) terms, and 
57 significant pathways were enriched. A network involving 36 DE-mRNAs, 8 DE- 
lncRNAs, and 15 DE-miRNAs was built, such as TRG-AS1-miR-23b/miR-423-PPM1L and 
GAS5-miR-320a/miR-23b/miR-423-SERPINA1 regulatory axises. Quantitatively 
real-time PCR successfully validated the expression levels of TRG-AS1- miR-23b 
-PPM1L and GAS5-miR-320a- SERPINA1.
CONCLUSION: TRG-AS1-miR-23b-PPM1L and GAS5-miR-320a-SERPINA1 regulatory axises 
might impact the pathogenesis of T1D.

This article provides a brief background on critical care nursing in the 
Philippines, its trend on current practice, and its implication and future 
direction. An overview is given on the milieu and processes inherent in the 
critical care unit with the intensive care unit setup taken as its exemplar. The 
roles and responsibilities of critical care nurses within these units and nature 
of common issues within their practice is explored. The need for training in 
communication skills, conflict resolution, and palliative care is implied for 
these nurses to fully fulfill their roles as collaborative clinician and active 
patient advocate.

OBJECTIVES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are expected to be used for 
priority setting of hospital-dispensed medicines in Denmark from 2021. The aim 
of this study was to develop the first Danish value set for the EQ-5D-5L based 
on interviews with a representative sample of the Danish adult population.
METHODS: A nationally representative sample based on age (> 18 years), gender, 
education, and geographical region was recruited using data provided by 
Statistics Denmark. Computer-assisted personal interviews were carried out using 
the EQ-VT 2.1. Respondents each valued ten health states using composite time 
trade-off (cTTO) and seven health states using discrete-choice experiment (DCE). 
Different predictive models were explored using cTTO and DCE data alone or in 
combination as hybrid models. Model performance was assessed using logical 
consistency.
RESULTS: A total of 1014 interviews were included in the analyses. The sample 
was representative of the Danish adult population, though the sample contained 
slightly more respondents with higher education than in the general population. 
Only the heteroscedastic censored hybrid model combining cTTO and DCE data 
yielded consistent results, and hence was chosen for modelling the final Danish 
value set. The predicted values ranged from - 0.757 to 1, and anxiety/depression 
was the dimension assigned most value by respondents.
CONCLUSIONS: This study established the Danish EQ-5D-5L value set, which 
represents the preferences of the Danish general population, and is expected to 
provide key input for healthcare decision-making in a Danish context.

BACKGROUND: Hyperinflammation, hypercoagulation and multi-organ dysfunction are 
life-threatening complications needing immediate attention in moderate-tosevere 
COVID-19 patients. We present our real world experience with Itolizumab, a 
repurposed immunomodulatory monoclonal antibody, administered in COVID-19 
patients.
METHODOLOGY: Data from 25 confirmed moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients, with 
high levels of pro-inflammatory markers and pulmonary function worsening on best 
supportive care and Itolizumab were included in this analysis. Patients 
requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were excluded. Clinical parameters 
(oxygen requirement) and laboratory parameters (ferritin, interleukin [IL]-6, 
C-reactive protein [CRP] and absolute lymphocyte count [ALC]) were studied 
preand post-treatment. Average total length of stay in hospital and ICU, 
percentage of patients requiring ICU admission and average time taken for 
weaning off oxygen for all patients were also reported.
RESULTS: All Patients were in the range of 30-78 years of age, with majority 
being male (76%). Most prevalent comorbid conditions were diabetes (64%) and 
hypertension (28%). Median IL-6 value showed a decline by 85.4%. Significant 
reduction in median CRP (86.96%) and Ferritin (55.61%) was observed post- 
Itolizumab compared to pre-dose values. Median ALC improved from 1605 cells/ mm3 
(pre-dose) to 2462.5 cells/mm3 (post-dose). Average recovery time, defined as 
time from Itolizumab infusion to discharge was 9.28 ± 4.04 days. Average 
duration of hospitalization and ICU admission was 14.24 ± 4.15 and 8.27 ± 4.47 
days, respectively, with 76% patients recovered and discharged. Median oxygen 
saturation improved from 88 % (pre-dose) to 96 % (post-dose). All patients were 
weaned off oxygen within Avg + SD : 6.53 ± 2.09 days post-Itolizumab treatment. 
One and two point reduction in ordinal scale was observed in 88% and 76% 
patients, respectively. Three patients (12%) did not show improvement in ordinal 
sore of which two patients died because of complications due to pre-existing 
comorbidities. The all-cause mortality of 8%; was considered not related to 
Itolizumab. One infusion related event reported abated with infusion period 
extension.
INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: A single dose of Itolizumab accelerated recovery 
in adult patients with COVID-19 by controlling immune hyperactivation. The 
clinical improvement was demonstrated by reduction in inflammatory markers, 
weaning off oxygen, reduced length of hospital stay and improvement of ordinal 
score. Itolizumab was well tolerated and when administered in the early phase of 
the inflammatory cascade is an efficient therapeutic option for treatment of 
cytokine release syndrome in moderate to severe COVID-19 patients.

Using mortality registers and administrative data on income and population, we 
develop new evidence on the magnitude of life expectancy inequality in Hungary 
and the scope for health policy in mitigating this. We document considerable 
inequalities in life expectancy at age 45 across settlement-level income groups, 
and show that these inequalities have increased between 1991-96 and 2011-16 for 
both men and women. We show that avoidable deaths play a large role in life 
expectancy inequality. Income-related inequalities in health behaviours, access 
to care, and healthcare use are all closely linked to the inequality in life 
expectancy.Supplementary material for this article is available at:
