BACKGROUND: The Diabetes-Depression Care-Management Adoption Trial is a 
translational study of safety-net primary care predominantly Hispanic/Latino 
patients with type 2 diabetes in collaboration with the Los Angeles County 
Department of Health Services.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an information and 
communication technology (ICT)-facilitated depression care management program.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of the ICT-facilitated care (TC) delivery model was 
evaluated relative to a usual care (UC) and a supported care (SC) model. TC 
added automated low-intensity periodic depression assessment calls to patients. 
Patient-reported outcomes included the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey 
converted into quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the 9-Item Patient Health 
Questionnaire-calculated depression-free days (DFDs). Costs and outcomes data 
were collected over a 24-month period (-6 to 0 months baseline, 0 to 18 months 
study intervention).
RESULTS: A sample of 1406 patients (484 in UC, 480 in SC, and 442 in TC) was 
enrolled in the nonrandomized trial. TC had a significant improvement in DFDs 
(17.3; P = 0.011) and significantly greater 12-Item Short Form Health Survey 
utility improvement (2.1%; P = 0.031) compared with UC. Medical costs were 
statistically significantly lower for TC (-$2328; P = 0.001) relative to UC but 
not significantly lower than for SC. TC had more than a 50% probability of being 
cost-effective relative to SC at willingness-to-pay thresholds of more than 
$50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: An ICT-facilitated depression care (TC) delivery model improved 
QALYs, DFDs, and medical costs. It was cost-effective compared with SC and 
dominant compared with UC.

Setting the Boundaries for Economic Evaluation: Investigating Time Horizon and 
Family Effects in the Case of Postnatal Depression.

address: jemimah.ride@york.ac.uk.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the impact of varying the boundaries of 
economic evaluation: time horizon and inclusion of family effects. The context 
is postnatal mental health, where although advocates for investment often 
include longer-term and family problems in describing the burden of postnatal 
depression, economic evaluations are usually limited to mothers' effects with a 
relatively short time horizon. This discrepancy may lead to suboptimal 
allocation of healthcare resources.
METHODS: The question of whether such boundary extensions could make a 
difference to decision-making is explored using decision analytic models, 
populated with data from the literature, to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a 
hypothetical preventive intervention under alternate boundary-setting 
approaches.
RESULTS: The results suggest that broader boundaries, particularly extension of 
the time horizon, could make substantial differences to estimated 
cost-effectiveness. Inclusion of family effects without extension of the time 
horizon had little impact, but where a longer time horizon was used, family 
effects could make a significant difference to the conclusions drawn from 
cost-effectiveness analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Considerations in applying broader boundaries include the 
substantial resource requirements for evaluation, potential equity implications, 
relevance to decision-makers, methods for inclusion, and the interpretation and 
use of such results in decision-making. However, this context underscores the 
importance of considering not only caregiving but also family health effects, 
and illustrates the need for consistency between the arguments presented to 
decision-makers and the analytical approach taken in economic evaluation.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) combines real time 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin 
Infusion (CSII) and provides additional benefits beyond those provided by CSII 
alone. SAP with automated insulin suspension provides early warning of the onset 
of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia and has the functionality to suspend insulin 
delivery if sensor glucose levels are predicted to fall below a predefined 
threshold. Aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of SAP with 
automated insulin suspension versus CSII alone in type 1 diabetes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the CORE 
Diabetes Model. The analysis was performed in two different cohorts: one with 
high baseline HbA1c and one at elevated risk for hypoglycemic events. Clinical 
input data were sourced from published data. The analysis was conducted from a 
societal perspective over a lifetime time horizon; costs and clinical outcomes 
were discounted at 3% per year. In patients with poor glycemic control, SAP with 
automated insulin suspension resulted in improved discounted quality-adjusted 
life expectancy (QALY) versus CSII (12.44 QALYs vs. 10.99 QALYs) but higher mean 
total lifetime costs (€324,991 vs. €259,852), resulting in an incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €44,982 per QALY gained. In patients at elevated 
risk for hypoglycemia, the ICER was €33,692 per QALY gained for SAP versus CSII.
CONCLUSION: In Italy, the use of SAP with automated insulin suspension is 
associated with projected improvements in outcomes as compared to CSII. These 
benefits translate into an ICER usually considered as good value for money, 
particularly in patients at elevated risk of hypoglycemia.

BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) confers an increased risk of 
premature atherosclerotic disease. Coronary computed tomographic angiography 
(CTA) can assess preclinical coronary atherosclerosis.
OBJECTIVES: To describe coronary CTA findings in asymptomatic molecularly 
defined FH individuals, to identify those factors related to its presence and 
extension, and to assess the impact of these results in patients' care and 
estimated risk.
METHODS: Four hundred and forty individuals with FH, without clinical 
cardiovascular disease, were consecutively enrolled and underwent a coronary CTA 
that was used to analyze coronary atherosclerosis based on coronary calcium 
score (CCS), sum of stenosis severity, and plaque composition sum (PCS). For FH 
patients, cardiovascular risk was estimated using the specific SAFEHEART risk 
equation. Follow-up was performed using a standardized protocol.
RESULTS: Mean age was 46.4 years (231 women, 52%). Coronary calcium was present 
in 55%, mean CCS was 130.9, 46% had a plaque with lumen involvement, and mean 
PCS was 1.1. During follow-up, there were 17 (4%) nonfatal events and 2 (1%) 
fatal events. CCS was independently associated to the estimated risk and 
low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol life-years, sum of stenosis severity to the 
estimated risk, and PCS to the estimated risk and low-density 
lipoprotein-cholesterol life-years. CTA findings induced a positive change in 
patients' care and in their estimated risk.
CONCLUSION: Coronary artery atherosclerosis is highly prevalent in asymptomatic 
patients with FH and it is independently associated to cardiovascular risk. More 
advanced disease on CTA was associated with subsequent intensification of 
therapy and reduction of estimated risk. Further longitudinal studies are 
required to know if these findings might improve the risk stratification in 
patients with FH.

OBJECTIVES: To identify neuromuscular attributes associated with mobility and 
changes in mobility over 2 years of follow-up among patients with and without 
symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis (SLSS).
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a longitudinal cohort study.
SETTING: Outpatient rehabilitation center.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults ≥65 years with self-reported 
mobility limitations (N=430). SLSS was determined using self-reported symptoms 
of neurogenic claudication and imaging-detected lumbar spinal stenosis.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Basic and advanced mobility as measured by the Late-Life 
Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI).
RESULTS: Among 430 community-dwelling older adults, 54 (13%) patients met 
criteria for SLSS, while 246 (57%) did not. On average LLFDI basic and advanced 
mobility scores decreased significantly from baseline through year 2 for 
participants with SLSS (basic: P=.04, 95% CI 0.18, 5.21; advanced P=.03, 95% CI 
0.39, 7.84). Trunk extensor muscle endurance (trunk endurance) and leg strength 
were associated with baseline basic mobility (R2=0.27, P<.001) while leg 
strength and knee flexion range of motion (ROM) were associated with baseline 
advanced mobility among participants with SLSS (R2=0.47, P<.001). Among 
participants without SLSS trunk endurance, leg strength and ankle ROM were 
associated with baseline basic mobility (R2=0.38, P<.001), while trunk 
endurance, leg strength, leg strength asymmetry, and knee flexion ROM were 
associated with advanced mobility (R2=0.20, P<.001). Trunk endurance and leg 
strength were associated with change in basic mobility (R2=0.29, P<.001), while 
trunk endurance and knee flexion ROM were associated with change in advanced 
mobility (R2=0.42, P<.001) among participants with SLSS. Among participants 
without SLSS trunk endurance, leg strength, knee flexion ROM, and ankle ROM were 
associated with change in basic mobility (R2=0.22, P<.001), while trunk 
endurance, leg strength, and knee flexion ROM were associated with change in 
advanced mobility (R2=0.36, P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SLSS experience greater impairment in the 
neuromuscular attributes: trunk endurance, leg strength, leg strength asymmetry, 
knee flexion and extension ROM, and ankle ROM compared to patients without SLSS. 
Differences exist in the neuromuscular attributes associated with mobility at 
baseline and decline in mobility over 2 years of follow-up for patients with and 
without SLSS. These findings may help guide rehabilitative care approaches for 
patients with SLSS.

Rotaviruses (RV) are the leading cause of acute infantile gastroenteritis, 
associated with elevated mortality in low-income countries. Morbidity and 
mortality, length and rates of hospitalization due to RV gastroenteritis are 
dropping. Improving the quality of newborns life is an ongoing challenge for 
health-care providers. In this study, homemade reassortant human-bovine 
rotavirus was developed and biological activity and molecular characterization 
of candidate vaccine were evaluated for the vaccine stability. Virus titration 
and purification of reassortant rotavirus strains were evaluated by plaque 
assays, electropherotyping. The genetic stability after first, third and sixth 
passage was by sequencing. Due to WHO recommendation, developingment of national 
capacity for vaccine production in appropriate quantities and at affordable 
prices is the cornerstone of developing global vaccination policies. Such 
studies are critical to producing national vaccines and modeling herd 
protection.

BACKGROUND: The member states of the United Nations launched 17 sustainable 
development goals (SDGs) as part of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. SDG 
target 3.4 focused on reducing premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases 
by one-third by 2030 through prevention and treatment and promoting mental 
health and well-being. Diabetes is associated with significant clinical and 
economic burden in China.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of improving care for people with diabetes in 
China, and how this relates to achieving SDG target 3.4.
METHODS: Long-term outcomes were projected for people with type 2 diabetes 
meeting treatment targets recommended by the Chinese Diabetes Society versus 
remaining at current care. Baseline characteristics were taken from the China 
Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance Study. Costs of treating diabetes-related 
complications were accounted in 2015 Chinese yuan (CNY). Outcomes were 
discounted at 3% annually when appropriate.
RESULTS: Bringing people with diabetes to treatment targets was associated with 
improved mean undiscounted life expectancy compared with current care (by 0.42 
years). Nationally, discounted cost savings of up to CNY540 billion could be 
generated as a result of reduced onset of diabetes-related complications if all 
people with diabetes achieved treatment targets. Bringing people to treatment 
targets reduced premature mortality from diabetes by 6% compared with current 
care.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term projections suggested that bringing people with diabetes 
to treatment targets resulted in improved life expectancy and significant cost 
savings. However, this was not sufficient to meet SDG target 3.4, indicating 
that diabetes prevention should form a key objective in China.

Schizophrenia is associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
resulting in elevated cardiovascular risk and limited life expectancy, 
translated into a weighted average of 14.5 years of potential life lost and an 
overall weighted average life expectancy of 64.7 years. The exact prevalence of 
type 2 diabetes among people with schizophrenia varies across studies and ranges 
2-5fold higher than in the general population, whereas the aetiology is complex 
and multifactorial. Besides common diabetogenic factors, applied similarly in 
the general population, such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, smoking, hypertension, 
poor diet and limited physical activity, the co-occurrence of schizophrenia and 
diabetes is also attributed to unique conditions. Specifically, excessive 
sedentary lifestyle, social determinants, adverse effects of antipsychotic drugs 
and limited access to medical care are considered aggravating factors for 
diabetes onset and low quality of diabetes management. Schizophrenia itself is 
further proposed as causal factor for diabetes, given the observed higher 
prevalence of diabetes in young patients, newly diagnosed with schizophrenia and 
unexposed to antipsychotics. Furthermore, studies support genetic predisposition 
to diabetes among people with schizophrenia, suggesting shared genetic risk and 
disclosing a number of overlapped risk loci. Therefore, special attention should 
be paid in preventing diabetes in people with schizophrenia, through 
intervention in all possible modifiable risk factors. Implementation of careful 
antipsychotic prescription, provision of adequate motivation for balanced diet 
and physical activity and facilitating access to primary health care, could 
serve in reducing diabetes prevalence. On the other hand, increasing calls are 
made for early diagnosis of diabetes, application of the appropriate 
anti-diabetic therapy and strict inspection of therapy adherence, to limit the 
excess mortality due to cardiovascular events in people with schizophrenia. 
Moreover, population health programs could help counseling and preventing 
diabetes risk, additionally to early screening and diagnosis set, aiming to 
reduce disparities in populations. Finally, mental health-care providers might 
greatly promote offered health services to patients with schizophrenia, through 
a holistic individualized approach, considering additionally the physical health 
of the patients and working closely, preventively and therapeutically, in 
collaboration with the physicians and diabetologists.

Life expectancy in the developed world has advanced beyond the number of years 
in which healthy tissue homeostasis can be maintained, and as a result, the 
number of persons with severe and debilitating chronic illnesses, including 
cancer, diabetes, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, neurodegenerative and 
cardiovascular disease has continued to rise. One of the key underlying causes 
for the loss in the ability to replenish damaged tissues is the qualitative and 
quantitative decline in somatic stem cell populations. A concerted effort to 
understand why aging adult stem cells fail to maintain "stem" potential while 
simultaneously developing new strategies and therapeutic interventions to 
prevent or reverse age-dependent stem cell decline is required to improve the 
overall healthspan of our rapidly aging population. This review focuses on what 
drives stem cell dysfunction with age, the contribution of stem cell dysfunction 
in driving aging and therapeutic approaches using stem cells to treat aging.

OBJECTIVES: Up to 70-80% of patients use inhalers incorrectly. Dry-powder 
inhalers (DPIs) require forceful inhalation for optimal delivery, and 
approximately 40% of Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)-defined Step-3+ 
patients inhale corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist through DPIs. The 
CRITIKAL study (Price et al. in J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract 5:1071-e9-1081-e9, 
2017) found a statistically significant association between 'insufficient 
inspiratory effort' error and increased risk of uncontrolled asthma and 
hospitalisation-requiring exacerbations. This paper explores the 
cost-effectiveness of an error-targeted intervention.
METHODS: A probabilistic Markov cost-utility model simulated patients 
transitioning between controlled and uncontrolled health states over one year. 
Odds ratios (ORs, from the CRITIKAL study) of a patient having uncontrolled 
asthma conditional on making the error were applied to baseline transition 
probabilities sourced from the literature, both indirectly via an adjustment 
formula (Zhang et al. in JAMA 280:1690-1691, 1998) and directly by assuming OR 
approximates relative risk (RR). The analysis explored complete/partial 
eradication of the error when the intervention was priced to match comparators, 
as well as impact of indirect costs based on lost/reduced productivity.
RESULTS: The intervention dominated both DPI comparators over one year, with 
direct cost savings of £45/£86 with 0.0053/0.0102 additional quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs), and had the highest probability of being cost-effective at a 
£20,000/QALY threshold. Key factors driving variance were weekly utilities per 
state and RR of moving to an uncontrolled state.
CONCLUSION: The analysis demonstrated the economic and societal costs of 
'insufficient inspiratory effort' and potential economic benefits of introducing 
an effective intervention to reduce/eradicate this error. Further research 
should assess the economic impact of other handling errors.

A 44-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with pleural effusion and 
unknown fever. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not detected by culture of pleural 
effusion and sputum and gastric fluid. Pleural fluid was serous and exudative, 
and cytological examination showed no malignant cells. Computed tomography 
revealed a little pleural thickening of the right middle lobe and massive 
pleural effusion. As acute pleurisy was suspected based on the findings of 
imaging studies, thoracoscopy was performed under general anesthesia. Many 
yellowish-white, small nodules were seen on the parietal pleura, and white small 
nodule were seen on the visceral pleura of the right middle lobe. Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis was not detected by culture and polymerase chain reaction for 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis( TB-PCR) of parietal pleura and pleural effusion, but 
was detected by only culture and TB-PCR of visceral pleura, yielding a diagnosis 
of tuberculous pleurisy. Her symptoms improved and the right pleural effusion 
decreased with isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RFP), ethambutol (EB) and 
pyrazinamide(PZA) treatment.

Clinical narrative: autoimmune hepatitis.

Schmeltzer PA(1), Russo MW.

Author information:
(1)Division of Hepatology, Carolinas Healthcare, Charlotte, NC, USA.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an inflammatory liver disease that is 
characterized by circulating autoantibodies, hypergammaglobulinemia, and a 
lymphoplasmocytic infiltration with interface hepatitis on liver biopsy. 
Treatment with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents is effective 
and early diagnosis can result in near-normal life expectancy. Untreated 
patients, however, can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. The clinical 
presentation is heterogeneous and may pose diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas. 
This case-based review will address the diagnosis and management of this 
disease, in addition to difficult but commonly encountered clinical scenarios.

Purpose: We explored patients' perspectives on home exercise programmes (HEPs) 
and their experiences using a mobile application designed to facilitate home 
exercise. Method: Data were generated using qualitative, semi-structured, 
face-to-face interviews with 10 participants who were receiving outpatient 
physiotherapy. Results: Establishing a therapeutic partnership between 
physiotherapists and patients enabled therapists to customize the HEPs to the 
patients' lifestyles and preferences. Analysis suggests that using the mobile 
application improved participants' ability to integrate the HEP into their daily 
life and was overwhelmingly preferred to traditional paper handouts. 
Conclusions: The results suggest that efforts to engage patients in HEPs need to 
take their daily lives into account. To move in this direction, sample exercise 
prescription questions are offered. Mobile applications do not replace the 
clinical encounter, but they can be an effective tool and an extension of 
delivering personalized HEPs in an existing therapeutic partnership.

Publisher: Objectif : explorer les points de vue des patients sur les programmes 
d'exercices à la maison (PEM) et leurs expériences à l'égard d'une application 
mobile conçue pour faciliter ce type d'exercices. Méthodologie : les chercheurs 
ont obtenu des données qualitatives semi-structurées en interviewant dix 
participants qui recevaient des soins ambulatoires en physiothérapie. 
Résultats : en formant un partenariat thérapeutiques avec leurs patients, les 
physiothérapeutes pouvaient personnaliser les PEM en fonction du mode de vie et 
des préférences de leurs patients. Selon l'analyse, une application mobile 
aidait les participants à intégrer les PEM à leur quotidien. Ceux-ci la 
préféraient massivement aux feuilles de renseignements habituels. Conclusions : 
d'après les résultats, les mesures pour que les patients s'investissent dans 
leur PEM doivent tenir compte du quotidien. Pour aller en ce sens, des questions 
sur les modèles de prescription d'exercices sont proposées. Les applications 
mobiles ne remplacent pas la rencontre clinique, mais peuvent constituer un 
outil efficace et compléter le PEM personnalisé dans le cadre d'un partenariat 
thérapeutique établi.

Learning about olfactory stimuli is essential in bumblebees' life since it is 
involved in orientation, recognition of nest sites, foraging efficiency and food 
yield for the colony as a whole. To evaluate associative learning abilities in 
bees under controlled environmental conditions, the proboscis extension response 
(PER) assay is a well-established method used in honey bees, stingless bees and 
successfully adapted to bumblebees of the genus Bombus. However, studies on the 
learning capacity of Bombus atratus (Hymenoptera: Apidae), one of the most 
abundant native species in South America, are non-existent. In this study, we 
examined the cognitive abilities of worker bees of this species, carrying out an 
olfactory PER conditioning experiment. Bumblebees were able to learn a pure odor 
when it was presented in paired association with sugared reward, but not when 
odor and reward were presented in an unpaired manner. Furthermore, if the bees 
were preexposed to the conditioned odor, the results differed depending on the 
presence of the scent either as a volatile in the rearing environment or diluted 
in the food. A decrement in learning performance results from the non-reinforced 
pre-exposure to the to-be-conditioned odor, showing a latent inhibition 
phenomenon. However, if the conditioned odor has been previously offered diluted 
in sugared reward, the food odor acts as a stimulus that improves the learning 
performance during PER conditioning. The native bumblebee B. atratus is thus a 
new hymenopteran species capable of being trained under controlled experimental 
conditions. Since it is an insect increasingly reared for pollination service, 
this knowledge could be useful in its management in crops.

Implant therapy is gaining presence as a prosthodontic treatment option. 
However, the graying of the population has led to an increase in the number of 
older adults requiring special consideration in implant treatment because of 
their systemic health problems. Additionally, with the growth of the elderly 
population in need of long-term care, a greater number of older adults who have 
received implant treatment are receiving long-term care, raising various issues 
that need to be addressed. In the present review article, we describe the 
significance of implant treatment in older adults, issues when performing 
implant treatment in geriatric patients, and measures to be taken when implant 
patients have lapsed into a state of requiring long-term care. In addition, in 
view of population aging, we propose an approach for applying implant treatment 
to older adults. This approach includes using an appropriate type of implant 
system depending on the remaining life expectancy and the patient's general 
condition, performing less invasive surgery, providing treatment using 
prosthetic appliances that are easy to manage and can be modified, and ensuring 
oral health management by providing an Implant Card to patients when the 
treatment is completed.

Primary splenic angiosarcoma is a rare abnormality and has a bad prognosis. It 
has unknown pathogenesis. This abnormality is usually presented by splenic 
rupture. Surgery is the most promising treatm Surgery is the most accepted and 
accurate method for diagnosis and treatment. Surgery before rupture increases 
the life expectancy. A 65-year-old woman who presented to the emergency room 
with abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and anemia was found to have a 
splenic mass and massive ascites. After getting a hemorrhagic sample from the 
abdomen, the patient was operated with splenic rupture prediagnosis. The spleen 
material was reported as splenic angiosarcoma. The staging 18F-FDG-Positron 
Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography did not show any metastasis. Five months 
later, paclitaxel treatment was initiated upon liver and bone metastasis, and 
the treatment still continues. Splenic angiosarcoma has a place among splenic 
parenchymal lesions. The splenectomy material names the diagnosis. Pathologic 
examination of splenectomy material is revealed certain diagnosis.

Growth Hormone and Aging: Updated Review.

Bartke A(1).

Medicine, Springfield, IL, USA. abartke@siumed.edu.

Role of growth hormone (GH) in mammalian aging is actively explored in clinical, 
epidemiological, and experimental studies. The age-related decline in GH levels 
is variously interpreted as a symptom of neuroendocrine aging, as one of causes 
of altered body composition and other unwelcome symptoms of aging, or as a 
mechanism of natural protection from cancer and other chronic diseases. Absence 
of GH signals due to mutations affecting anterior pituitary development, GH 
secretion, or GH receptors produces an impressive extension of longevity in 
laboratory mice. Extension of healthspan in these animals and analysis of 
survival curves suggest that in the absence of GH, aging is slowed down or 
delayed. The corresponding endocrine syndromes in the human have no consistent 
impact on longevity, but are associated with remarkable protection from 
age-related disease. Moreover, survival to extremely old age has been associated 
with reduced somatotropic (GH and insulin-like growth factor-1) signaling in 
women and men. In both humans and mice, elevation of GH levels into the 
supranormal (pathological) range is associated with increased disease risks and 
reduced life expectancy likely representing acceleration of aging. The widely 
advertised potential of GH as an anti-aging agent attracted much interest. 
However, results obtained thus far have been disappointing with few documented 
benefits and many troublesome side effects. Possible utility of GH in the 
treatment of sarcopenia and frailty remains to be explored.

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) syndrome represents one of the leading causes of 
long-term disability worldwide. The prevalence of CLBP has been rising 
significantly in relation to increasing average life expectancy. CLBP results 
from chronification of acute low back pain. There are many factors contributing 
to the CLBP crisis; common etiopathogenetic factors include e.g., functional 
blockage of intervertebral joints. The treatment of CLBP is complex. An 
important part of treatment consists of pain pharmacotherapy, for which several 
groups of drugs are used. The problem lies in the side effects of many of these 
traditionally used medications. Therefore, new and safer treatment methods are 
being sought. Innovative options for CLBP pharmacology include injections 
containing collagen, which can be combined with other traditionally used drugs, 
which helps reduce dosages and increase the overall safety of CLBP therapy.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the patient-reported outcome (PRO) 
content of ovarian cancer randomised-controlled trial (RCT) publications, 
describe PRO compliance, and explore potential relationships among these and 
completeness of PRO protocol content.
METHODS: Publications of Phase III ovarian cancer RCTs with PRO endpoints were 
identified by Medline and Cochrane systematic search: January 2000 to February 
2016. Two reviewers determined the number of Consolidated Standards of Reporting 
Trials (CONSORT)-PRO Extension items addressed in publications. Compliance rates 
(defined as the proportion of participants included in the principal PRO 
analysis, of those from whom PRO assessments were expected) were extracted. The 
relationship between CONSORT-PRO score and compliance rates was explored using 
scatter plots. Additionally CONSORT-PRO score and PRO compliance rates 
respectively were compared with corresponding PRO protocol scores obtained from 
a previous study.
RESULTS: Thirty-six eligible RCTs (n = 33 with secondary PRO endpoint) were 
identified and analysed. The average number of CONSORT-PRO items addressed in 
publications was 6.7 (48%; Range 0-13.5/14). Three RCTs did not report PRO 
results; in 1 case due to poor compliance. Some compliance information was 
reported in 26 RCTs, but was considered complete for only 10 (28%) RCTs. 
Compliance rates were poor overall, ranging from 59 to 83%; therefore missing 
PRO data from 17 to 41% of participants in these trials could have been 
avoided.Of the 26 (73%) RCTs for which PRO protocol completeness scores were 
available, 6 RCTs reported complete compliance information and the 3 of these 
RCTs with highest PRO compliance had highest protocol checklist scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Few RCTs reported PRO compliance information in a manner enabling 
assessment of the generalisability of PRO results. This information is 
particularly important in RCTs of advanced ovarian cancer because it is 
important to be able to determine if missing data was due to worsening illness 
compared to methodological issues. Poor compliance appeared related to poor PRO 
protocol content, and in one case prevented PRO results from being reported, 
highlighting the need to address compliance strategies in the protocol. Adhering 
to protocol and CONSORT-PRO reporting guidance should improve PRO implementation 
and reporting respectively in ovarian cancer RCTs and allow results to 
meaningfully inform clinical practice.

Few studies have assessed the effects of food scarcity or excess on the life 
history traits of Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) independently from 
larval density. We assessed immature survival, development time, and adult size 
in relation to food availability. We reared cohorts of 30 Ae. aegypti larvae 
from newly hatched to adult emergence with different food availability. Food 
conditions were kept constant by transferring larvae each day to a new food 
solution. Immature development was completed by some individuals in all 
treatments. The shortest development time, the largest adults, and the highest 
survival were observed at intermediate food levels. The most important effects 
of food scarcity were an extension in development time, a decrease in the size 
of adults, and a slight decrease in survival, while the most important effects 
of food excess were an important decrease in survival and a slight decrease in 
the size of adults. The variability in development time and adult size within 
sex and treatment increased at decreasing food availability. The results suggest 
that although the studied population has adapted to a wide range of food 
availabilities, both scarcity and excess of food have important negative impacts 
on fitness.
