The aim of this study was to examine the complex interactions between political 
traditions, policies, and public health outcomes, and to find out whether 
different political traditions have been associated with systematic patterns in 
population health over time. We analysed a number of political, economic, 
social, and health variables over a 50-year period, in a set of wealthy 
countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD). Our findings support the hypothesis that the political 
ideologies of governing parties affect some indicators of population health. Our 
analysis makes an empirical link between politics and policy, by showing that 
political parties with egalitarian ideologies tend to implement redistributive 
policies. An important finding of our research is that policies aimed at 
reducing social inequalities, such as welfare state and labour market policies, 
do seem to have a salutary effect on the selected health indicators, infant 
mortality and life expectancy at birth.

There are three related criteria that a concept of fitness should be able to 
meet: it should render the principle of natural selection non-tautologous and it 
should be explanatory and predictive. I argue that for fitness to be able to 
fulfill these criteria, it cannot be a property that changes over the course of 
an individual's life. Rather, I introduce a fitness concept--Block Fitness--and 
argue that an individual's genes and environment fix its fitness in such a way 
that each individual's fitness has a fixed value over its lifetime.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of acupuncture in the management 
of persistent non-specific low back pain.
DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis of a randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Three private acupuncture clinics and 18 general practices in York, 
England.
PARTICIPANTS: 241 adults aged 18-65 with non-specific low back pain of 4-52 
weeks' duration.
INTERVENTIONS: Ten individualised acupuncture treatments over three months from 
acupuncturists trained in traditional Chinese medicine (n = 160) or usual care 
only (n = 81).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained over two years.
RESULTS: Total costs to the United Kingdom's health service during the two year 
study period were higher on average for the acupuncture group (460 pounds 
sterling; 673 euros; 859 dollars) than for the usual care group (345 pounds 
sterling) because of the costs associated with initial treatment. The mean 
incremental health gain from acupuncture at 12 months was 0.012 QALYs (95% 
confidence interval -0.033 to 0.058) and at 24 months was 0.027 QALYs (-0.056 to 
0.110), leading to a base case estimate of 4241 pounds sterling per QALY gained. 
This result was robust to sensitivity analysis. The probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis showed acupuncture to have a more than 90% chance of being cost 
effective at a pound20 000 cost per QALY threshold.
CONCLUSION: A short course of traditional acupuncture for persistent 
non-specific low back pain in primary care confers a modest health benefit for 
minor extra cost to the NHS compared with usual care. Acupuncture care for low 
back pain seems to be cost effective in the longer term.

Long-term oral bosentan treatment in patients with pulmonary arterial 
hypertension related to congenital heart disease: a 2-year study.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term clinical and exercise effect of chronic 
oral administration of the non-selective endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan 
in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) related to congenital 
heart disease (CHD).
DESIGN: Extension of a preceding prospective non-randomised open clinical study 
on bosentan treatment in PAH related to CHD.
SETTING: A tertiary referral centre for cardiology.
PATIENTS: 19 of the original 21 patients of mean (standard deviation (SD)) age 
22 (3) years (13 with Eisenmenger syndrome) in World Health Organization (WHO) 
class II-IV and having a mean (SD) oxygen saturation of 87 (2) %.
INTERVENTION: Patients received bosentan treatment for 2.4 (0.1) years and 
underwent clinical and exercise evaluation at baseline, 16 weeks and 2 years of 
treatment, with haemodynamic assessment at baseline and 16 weeks.
RESULTS: All patients remained stable with sustained subjective clinical and WHO 
class improvement (p<0.01) at 16 weeks and 2 years of treatment without 
significant side effects or changes in oxygen saturation. After the initial 
16-week improvement (p<0.05) in peak oxygen consumption and exercise duration at 
treadmill test, and walking distance and Borg dyspnoea index at 6-min walk test, 
all exercise parameters appeared to return to their baseline values at 2 years 
of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term bosentan treatment in patients with PAH related to CHD is 
safe and induces clinical stability and improvement, but the objective exercise 
values appear to slowly return to baseline. Larger studies on long-term 
endothelin receptor antagonism including quality of life assessment are needed 
to evaluate the therapeutic role of bosentan in this population.

BACKGROUND: Assessing the economic burden of HIV/AIDS can help to quantify the 
effect of the epidemic on a population and assist policy makers in allocating 
public health resources.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the economic burden of HIV/AIDS in the United States and 
provide race/ethnicity-specific estimates.
METHODS: We conducted an incidence-based cost-of-illness analysis to estimate 
the lifetime cost of HIV/AIDS resulting from new infections diagnosed in 2002. 
Data from the HIV/AIDS Reporting System of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention were used to determine stage of disease at diagnosis and proportion 
of cases by race/ethnicity. Lifetime direct medical costs and mortality-related 
productivity losses were estimated using data on cost, life expectancy, and 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) use from the literature.
RESULTS: The cost of new HIV infections in the United States in 2002 is 
estimated at $36.4 billion, including $6.7 billion in direct medical costs and 
$29.7 billion in productivity losses. Direct medical costs per case were highest 
for whites ($180,900) and lowest for blacks ($160,400). Productivity losses per 
case were lowest for whites ($661,100) and highest for Hispanics ($838,000). In 
a sensitivity analysis, universal use of ART and more effective ART regimens 
decreased the overall cost of illness.
CONCLUSION: Direct medical costs and productivity losses of HIV/AIDS resulting 
from infections diagnosed in 2002 are substantial. Productivity losses far 
surpass direct medical costs and are disproportionately borne by minority 
races/ethnicities. Our analysis underscores economic benefits of more effective 
ART regimens and universal access to ART.

INTRODUCTION: Plexiform neurofibroma in any location is one of the commonest 
complications associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Plexiform 
neurofibroma of the upper eyelid and orbit is usually associated with 
ipsilateral hemifacial hyperplasia. We present four patients with NF1 and 
plexiform neurofibroma of the eyelid and orbit associated with hemifacial 
hyperplasia, who also showed hyperplasia of the unilateral cerebral hemisphere.
CASE REPORTS: There are four patients, three females and one male, who consulted 
because of NF1 with plexiform neurofibroma of upper eyelid and hemifacial 
hyperplasia. Upper eyelid involvement was observed since birth and progressed 
during the first years of life. The patients showed normal neurological and 
mental development without motor or cerebellar disorders. Magnetic resonance 
studies demonstrated the asymmetric hyperplasia of the ipsilateral hemisphere in 
all four cases and of the cerebellar hemisphere in one case. The degree of 
hemispheric hyperplasia was related to the size and extension of the plexiform 
neurofibroma, as well as to the severity of the hemifacial hyperplasia. In our 
case which had the plexiform neurofibroma extended to the neck and the upper 
thorax, the hyperplasia not only affected the cerebral hemisphere but also the 
ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere. All parts of the hemisphere showed increased 
size. The cortex of the entire hemisphere showed normal differentiation of the 
subcortical white matter.
CONCLUSION: NF1 appears to be related with facial and cerebral ipsilateral 
hemihyperplasia. The relation between the size and extension of the orbital, 
eyelid and facial plexiform neurofibroma and the degree of asymmetry of the 
hemispheric hyperplasia suggest that different influences of a still unknown 
agent, possibly a gene, obviously related to NF1, causes both the intracranial 
and extracranial abnormalities.

About 17 million persons die in cardiovascular disease yearly in the world. Most 
part of this disease can be prevented by the elimination of primary risk 
factors, thus by the abolishment of unhealthy nutrition, physical inactivity and 
by the absence of smoking. The cost-effective national program, as well as the 
life style with decreasing individual risk factors can give a trend to decrease 
the cardiovascular mortality. Individually the usual blood pressure and 
cholesterol control, the inhibition of obesity and the life style without 
smoking are able to decrease the organic changes, which produce the lethal 
consequences of this disease. The different kinds of diets can significantly 
influence the development of human diseases. The Western diet has atherogenic 
effect, increases the risk of myocardial infarction. The Mediterranean diet 
beneficially influences the life expectancy at birth. The Far-East Japanese diet 
could specially be important from the viewpoint of nutrition, because the 
longest life expectancy at birth and the smallest cardiovascular mortality can 
be found there. The quality nutrition factors (vitamins, vitamin like materials, 
polyphenols in wine and fruit juices, trace elements, omega-3 fatty acids) play 
an important role in the decreasing of oxidative stress and cardiovascular 
mortality.

Review of eight pharmacoeconomic studies of the value of biologic DMARDs 
(adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab) in the management of rheumatoid 
arthritis.

BACKGROUND: Treatment options for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
have expanded from the traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs) to include the biologic DMARDs that inhibit tumor necrosis factoralpha 
(TNF-a).
OBJECTIVE: To assess the medical literature for studies of the economic value of 
biologic DMARDs, specifically the 3 TNF-a inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept, 
and infliximab) used for the management of RA, compared with the traditional 
DMARDs such as sulfasalazine, antimalarials, penicillamine, gold, methotrexate, 
azathioprine, leflunomide, and cyclophosphamide.
METHODS: A comprehensive search of the MEDLINE and HealthSTAR databases was 
conducted to identify cost-efficacy, cost-effectiveness, or cost-utility studies 
published in the English language (from 1966 through November 2004). The search 
terms and/or MeSH (medical subject headings) titles were cost-benefit analysis, 
rheumatoid arthritis, antirheumatic agents, antineoplastic and immunosuppressive 
agents. Studies were critically reviewed and quality was assessed using the 
Quality of Health Economic Studies instrument. Most studies evaluated the use of 
biologics among RA patients resistant to DMARDs. Studies were assessed with 
regard to comparators evaluated, measures of efficacy, perspectives, model 
duration, treatment duration, and discount rate.
RESULTS: From 180 titles identified, 155 were excluded for the following 
reasons: 89 because they did not consider the drugs of interest, 15 because the 
population was not RA, 19 because of having the wrong drugs and population, 22 
because they were review articles, and 10 because they were general articles. 
Twentyfive abstracts were accepted for further review. Of these, 13 abstracts 
were subsequently selected for full-text review. One of the authors identified a 
study not indexed in MEDLINE. Ultimately, 2 cost-effectiveness and 6 
cost-utility studies were selected for this critical review. One study over 6 
months reported that triple therapy with DMARDs 
(methotrexate-hydroxychloroquine-sulfasalazine) was cost effective for 
methotrexate-resistant patients, which is consistent with American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines that support the use of triple therapy prior to 
biologics. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $1,500 per 
patient to achieve an ACR20 response for this triple therapy compared with no 
second-line agent. Overall, biologic therapies cost considerably more than 
traditional DMARDs but produced more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). 
Despite differences in design and assumptions, published economic models 
consistently reported ICERs <50,000 dollars per QALY gained for biologics 
compared with traditional DMARDs, although ICERs of >100,000 dollars were 
reported from sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical guidelines currently recommend the use of biologics as 
step therapy after failure of traditional DMARDs. Reported ICERs comparing 
biologics with traditional DMARDs are within a range that is comparable with 
other accepted medical interventions. The worth of the additional expenditure 
will ultimately be judged by formulary and policy decision makers because no 
maximum cost has been defined. Models can be used to inform decision makers, but 
they must be interpreted and applied carefully. More research is also needed to 
differentiate the relative economic value of the various biologic agents by 
therapeutic indication.

Identification and expression analysis of twelve members of the 
nucleobase-ascorbate transporter (NAT) gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana.

D-50931 Cologne, Germany.

By screening genome databases, 12 genes encoding membrane proteins homologous to 
nucleobase-ascorbate transporters (NATs) were identified in Arabidopsis 
thaliana. A similar number of genes was found in the rice genome. The plant NAT 
proteins split into five clades (I-V) based on protein multisequence alignments. 
This classification nicely correlates with the patterns of organ- and 
tissue-specific expression during the whole life cycle of A. thaliana. 
Interestingly, expression of two members of clade III, AtNAT7 and AtNAT8, was 
found to be up-regulated in undifferentiated tissues such as callus or tumors 
produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Clade V comprises AtNAT12 possessing a 
hydrophilic N-terminal extension. Transient expression of green fluorescent 
protein (GFP) fusions in different systems showed that AtNAT12 along with AtNAT7 
and -8 are located in the plasma membrane. Mutations in any of the AtNAT genes 
do not induce phenotypic alterations. The absence of obvious mutant phenotypes 
in single but also in double and triple mutants suggests a high degree of 
functional redundancy between AtNAT genes, but might also point to redundant 
functions provided by genes or pathways unrelated to the AtNATs.

A wide range of biomarkers, reflecting activity in a number of biological 
systems (e.g., neuroendocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and metabolic), have been 
found to prospectively predict disability, morbidity, and mortality outcomes in 
older adult populations. Levels of these biomarkers, singly or in combination, 
may serve as an early warning system of risk for future adverse health outcomes. 
In the current investigation, 13 biomarkers were examined as predictors of 
mortality occurrence over a 12-year period in a sample of men and women (n = 
1,189) 70-79 years of age at enrollment into the study. Biomarkers examined in 
analyses included markers of neuroendocrine functioning (epinephrine, 
norepinephrine, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone), immune activity 
(C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, IL-6, and albumin), cardiovascular functioning 
(systolic and diastolic blood pressure), and metabolic activity [high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total to HDL cholesterol ratio, and glycosylated 
hemoglobin]. Recursive partitioning techniques were used to identify a set of 
pathways, composed of combinations of different biomarkers, that were associated 
with a high-risk of mortality over the 12-year period. Of the 13 biomarkers 
examined, almost all entered into one or more high-risk pathways although 
combinations of neuroendocrine and immune markers appeared frequently in 
high-risk male pathways, and systolic blood pressure was present in combination 
with other biomarkers in all high-risk female pathways. These findings 
illustrate the utility of recursive partitioning techniques in identifying 
biomarker combinations predictive of mortal outcomes in older adults, as well as 
the multiplicity of biological pathways to mortality in elderly populations.

Type I pleuropulmonary blastoma: a report from the International Pleuropulmonary 
Blastoma Registry.

Clinics of Minnesota, St Paul, Minnesota 55102, USA. jprst@prodigy.net

PURPOSE: Type I pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a rare, cystic lung neoplasm 
in infants characterized by subtle malignant changes and a good prognosis. 
Recurrences after type I PPB are usually advanced type II or type III neoplasms 
with a poor prognosis. This article describes the first collection of type I PPB 
cases, analyzes outcome based on treatments of surgery or surgery plus 
chemotherapy, and presents type I PPB management recommendations.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Type I PPB cases from the International PPB Registry and 
literature were evaluated using standard statistical methods for outcomes based 
on age at diagnosis, sex, thoracic side, surgical extent, length of follow-up, 
constitutional/familial disease, pre-existing lung cysts, intrathoracic 
findings, and treatments (surgery or surgery and chemotherapy).
RESULTS: Thirty-eight type I PPB cases were identified: Registry (n = 30) and 
literature (n = 8). Twenty children had surgery alone; eight (40%) experienced 
recurrence; and four died. Eighteen children had surgery and adjuvant 
chemotherapy; one experienced recurrence and died. All recurrences were type II 
or III PPB. Recurrence-free survival was higher in the surgery + chemotherapy 
group (P = .01); overall survival did not differ (P = .18). The improved 
recurrence-free survival was found only in males. Four of nine children with 
recurrence survived.
CONCLUSION: Adjuvant chemotherapy appears to benefit type I PPB patients. 
Benefit limited to males requires broader substantiation. Salvage after types II 
and III recurrence is poor (four of nine; 44%). A rigorous surveillance schedule 
after type I PPB diagnosis might detect early recurrence and be an acceptable 
alternative to adjuvant chemotherapy.

An estimate of the worldwide prevalence and disability associated with 
osteoporotic fractures.

Johnell O(1), Kanis JA.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopaedics, Malmö University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantify the global burden of 
osteoporotic fracture worldwide.
METHODS: The incidence of hip fractures was identified by systematic review and 
the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was imputed from the incidence of hip 
fractures in different regions of the world. Excess mortality and disability 
weights used age- and sex-specific data from Sweden to calculate the Disability 
Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost due to osteoporotic fracture.
RESULTS: In the year 2000 there were an estimated 9.0 million osteoporotic 
fractures of which 1.6 million were at the hip, 1.7 million at the forearm and 
1.4 million were clinical vertebral fractures. The greatest number of 
osteoporotic fractures occurred in Europe (34.8%). The total DALYs lost was 5.8 
million of which 51% were accounted for by fractures that occurred in Europe and 
the Americas. World-wide, osteoporotic fractures accounted for 0.83% of the 
global burden of non-communicable disease and was 1.75% of the global burden in 
Europe. In Europe, osteoporotic fractures accounted for more DALYs lost than 
common cancers with the exception of lung cancer. For chronic musculo-skeletal 
disorders the DALYs lost in Europe due to osteoporosis (2.0 million) were less 
than for osteoarthrosis (3.1 million) but greater than for rheumatoid arthritis 
(1.0 million).
CONCLUSION: We conclude that osteoporotic fractures are a significant cause of 
morbidity and mortality, particularly in the developed countries.

We carried out a cost-effectiveness evaluation of transdermal fentanyl compared 
to three other widely used opioids: transdermal buprenorphine, sustained-release 
morphine, and controlled-release oxycodone from a third-party-payers 
perspective. A decision analytic model with data from a structured database 
search and from panel data and assumptions was used to derive both cost and 
utility results. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to ensure the 
findings. Transdermal fentanyl patients gain more quality adjusted life-days or 
quality-adjusted life-years per euro. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year is 1,625.65 euro for transdermal fentanyl compared to 
sustained-release morphine and 1,003.03 euro compared to CO, and it is 
cost-saving compared to transdermal buprenorphine (-203.38 euro per patient). 
Transdermal fentanyl is thus cost-effective compared to both sustained-release 
morphine and CO and dominant compared to transdermal buprenorphine in the 
treatment of adults with nonmalignant moderate to severe chronic pain.

BACKGROUND: Following external beam radiation and interstitial radiation for 
prostate cancer, between 30% and 50% of the patients experience locoregional 
recurrence of their cancer. Although radical salvage prostatectomy is a 
secondary treatment option with curative intent, so far only a few hundred 
patients (<2%) worldwide have undergone this operation. The subject of this 
paper is a review of the world literature with reference to the frequency with 
this operation is performed and the technique, and also the prospects of success 
and possible complications.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: After radiotherapy, approximately 30% of biopsies are 
positive. Nonetheless, only 536 cases of salvage radical prostatectomy had been 
reported in the world literature up to 2005. The diagnosis of a local recurrence 
was always confirmed by rectal punch biopsy, pelvic CT and bone scintigraphy. 
Salvage radical prostatectomy with or without nerve sparing, with pelvic 
lymphadenectomy and, in some patients with cystectomy plus urinary diversion was 
the operative treatment applied.
RESULTS: Following secondary treatment after radiotherapy (RT), three parameters 
have been consistently identified as predictors of local failure: PSA nadir, 
time to nadir and PSA doubling time; clinical stage and type of first-line 
treatment are not helpful in predicting failure. The 5-year biochemical 
relapse-free survival rates are 77%, 71% and 28% for stages pT2, pT3a and 
pT3b/pN1, respectively. The success rate for salvage radical prostatectomy is 
thus similar to that for de novo radical prostatectomy for the same stages. In 
the past salvage radical prostatectomy following radiotherapy had a high 
complication rate.
CONCLUSIONS: A salvage radical prostatectomy with curative intent is a radical 
prostatectomy following radiotherapy also performed with curative intent. The 
reasons for the few literature reports of salvage RPX are: (1) oncological 
misgivings (too long a period of observation of PSA by the radiation 
oncologist/urologist; (2) misgivings to do with surgical technique, as the 
operation is technically challenging and involves a high risk of complications, 
especially incontinence. In recent times the comorbidity rate has become 
acceptable in cases in which the indications have been correctly observed. We 
believe that salvage prostatectomy should be considered only for patients in 
good general health whose life expectancy is over 10 years and who have 
recurrent cancer confirmed by punch biopsy 1 year or longer after the completion 
of radiotherapy and whose cancer was initially in an early (T1-2) clinical stage 
before their radiotherapy. Ideally, serum PSA should be less than 10 ng/ml both 
initially (before radiotherapy) and before salvage surgery. In addition, 
patients should be highly motivated and able to accept the surgical morbidity 
(50% incontinence rate).

The incidence and prevalence of diabetes have reached epidemic proportions 
worldwide. The reasons for the pandemic are the sharp rise in obesity, decline 
in physical activity and the increase in life expectancy. There are some 400,000 
people with diagnosed diabetes in Israel and they are at a markedly increased 
risk for cardiovascular disease, blindness, end-stage renal disease and lower 
limb amputation. To effectively lower this significantly increased burden of 
disease, a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach to chronic disease 
management is required. To facilitate such an approach, the Israel Diabetes 
Association published a guideline for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of 
diabetes. The guideline, based on the ADA (American Diabetes Association) and 
IDF (International Diabetes Federation) guidelines, was approved by other 
national professional societies including hypertension, family practice, 
obesity, nephrology, atherosclerosis and internal medicine. The guidelines 
highlight the metabolic syndrome and prediabetic states, interventions for the 
prevention of diabetes, the new definitions of diabetes and impaired glucose 
metabolism and the newly defined targets for glucose, lipid, cholesterol and 
blood pressure control. In addition, the recommendations for periodic review and 
screening for complications are summarized. The need for patient education and 
empowerment are emphasized as is the need for the development and implementation 
of unique tools including computerized treatment flow-charts, prompts and 
quality measures, for the long term management of a complex metabolic disease.

Toronto, Ontario, Canada. gillian.brunier@sunnybrook.ca

The number of patients initiating dialysis in most countries continues to 
increase, with the greatest increase being in the oldest age group. Clinical 
practice guidelines have been developed to help the nephrology team with 
end-of-life carefor patients on dialysis. The aim of the project reported here 
was to assess if we were meeting the guidelines. We conducted a retrospective 
cohort study of all patients 80 years of age and older who had started dialysis 
at our center Our cohort included 105 patients (50% men; median age: 84.5 years; 
age range: 80-95 years), of whom 55% were on hemodialysis and 45% were on 
peritoneal dialysis (PD). Overall life expectancy was 2.1 years. Among the 59 
patients who died while still part of our program, 92% had a do not resuscitate 
order in place, and 46% had withdrawn from dialysis. Palliative care was 
consulted in 46% of cases. Dyspnea and pain were the two most common symptoms in 
the last 24 hours of life. Of these 59 patients, 71% died in hospital. Only 6 
patients died at home, all of these being on home PD. End-of-life care for this 
elderly cohort of dialysis patients could be improved on several measures to 
meet clinical practice guidelines, especially with greater access to palliative 
care units and community palliative care programs.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to develop a method to allocate 
treatment effects when patients switch medication frequently in longitudinal 
observational studies and apply the approach to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
treatments in the Schizophrenia Outpatient Health Outcomes (SOHO) study.
METHODS: Data were collected on patients at entry to the SOHO study at 3, 6, and 
12 months. The 12-month follow-up period was considered as three epochs: 0-3 
months, 3-6 months, and 6-12 months. Patients who switched treatment at 3 months 
had their new treatment considered as a new baseline observation, as these two 
3-month observations provide two sets of information on the cost-effectiveness 
of a drug in the first 3 months after initiation. Multivariate regression 
analysis was used to adjust for baseline covariates. The model allowed for 
flexible functional forms, and the cost data were modeled using an exponential 
mean function. Bootstrapping assessed the uncertainty of the estimated 
parameters and incremental cost-effectiveness analysis decision rule.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We show the feasibility of the epoch analysis approach 
using data from the SOHO study comparing two antipsychotics. Estimates for the 
incremental cost and effectiveness per epoch over the full 12-month period are 
presented. Using the estimates of 200 bootstrap samples, we demonstrate how one 
drug is cost-effective compared with another.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to develop a model to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of a new treatment for patients with depression.
METHODS: A Markov simulation model was constructed to evaluate standard care for 
depression as performed in clinical practice compared with a new treatment for 
depression. Costs and effects were estimated for time horizons of 6 months to 5 
years. A naturalistic longitudinal observational study provided data on costs, 
quality of life, and transition probabilities. Data on long-term consequences of 
depression and mortality risks were collected from the literature. 
Cost-effectiveness was quantified as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained 
from the new treatment compared with standard care, and the societal perspective 
was taken. Probabilistic analyses were conducted to present the uncertainty in 
the results, and sensitivity analyses were conducted on key parameters used in 
the model.
RESULTS: Compared with standard care, the new hypothetical therapy was predicted 
to substantially decrease costs and was also associated with gains in QALYs. 
With an improved treatment effect of 50 percent on achieving full remission, the 
net cost savings were 20,000 Swedish kronor over a 5-year follow-up time, given 
equal costs of treatments. Patients gained .073 QALYs over 5 years. The results 
are sensitive to changes in assigned treatment effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides a new model for assessing the 
cost-effectiveness of treatments for depression by incorporating full remission 
as the treatment goal and QALYs as the primary outcome measure. Moreover, we 
show the usefulness of naturalistic real-life data on costs and quality of life 
and transition probabilities when modeling the disease over time.

Crystal structure and activities of EXPB1 (Zea m 1), a beta-expansin and group-1 
pollen allergen from maize.

Comment in
    Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 103:14661.

Expansins are small extracellular proteins that promote turgor-driven extension 
of plant cell walls. EXPB1 (also called Zea m 1) is a member of the 
beta-expansin subfamily known in the allergen literature as group-1 grass pollen 
allergens. EXPB1 induces extension and stress relaxation of grass cell walls. To 
help elucidate expansin's mechanism of wall loosening, we determined the 
structure of EXPB1 by x-ray crystallography to 2.75-A resolution. EXPB1 consists 
of two domains closely packed and aligned so as to form a long, shallow groove 
with potential to bind a glycan backbone of approximately 10 sugar residues. The 
structure of EXPB1 domain 1 resembles that of family-45 glycoside hydrolase 
(GH45), with conservation of most of the residues in the catalytic site. 
However, EXPB1 lacks a second aspartate that serves as the catalytic base 
required for hydrolytic activity in GH45 enzymes. Domain 2 of EXPB1 is an 
Ig-like beta-sandwich, with aromatic and polar residues that form a potential 
surface for polysaccharide binding in line with the glycan binding cleft of 
domain 1. EXPB1 binds to maize cell walls, most strongly to xylans, causing 
swelling of the cell wall. Tests for hydrolytic activity by EXPB1 with various 
wall polysaccharides proved negative. Moreover, GH45 enzymes and a GH45-related 
protein called "swollenin" lacked wall extension activity comparable to that of 
expansins. We propose a model of expansin action in which EXPB1 facilitates the 
local movement and stress relaxation of arabinoxylan-cellulose networks within 
the wall by noncovalent rearrangement of its target.

Selecting treatment for high-risk, localized prostate cancer: the case for 
radical prostatectomy.

Lepor H.

The most common treatment options for men with clinically localized prostate 
cancer include radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy. The choice between 
these options is often controversial, and selecting the optimal treatment poses 
a great challenge for patients and physicians. Factors important to the decision 
include age and life expectancy of the patient, the natural history of the 
prostate cancer, how curable the disease is, and the morbidity of treatment. Use 
of these criteria to select treatment for a healthy, 70-year-old man presenting 
with a nonpalpable tumor, stage T1c disease, serum prostate-specific antigen of 
12 ng/mL, and an adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 8 that is present in 2 
of 12 biopsy cores would lead to the choice of radical prostatectomy over 
radiation therapy. Data show that such a patient has a life expectancy of more 
than 12.3 years if the prostate cancer can be cured and a high probability of 
dying from the disease if it is not cured. Data further show that radical 
prostatectomy in such a patient would confer a survival advantage over radiation 
therapy without resulting in greater complications or reduction in quality of 
life.

The effect of erectile dysfunction on quality of life following treatment for 
localized prostate cancer.

Penson DF.

All forms of prostate cancer therapy carry significant risk of erectile 
dysfunction, but patients value sexual function so highly that they are often 
willing to choose a therapy that offers a shorter life expectancy but better 
potency following treatment. Advances in research methodology now allow reliable 
collection of meaningful data regarding patients' health-related quality of 
life, including both objective evaluation of patients' functional status and 
their perceptions of their own health and its impact on their existence. In the 
past decade, several validated and reliable questionnaires have been developed 
that are specifically designed to measure HRQOL in men with prostate cancer. 
Studies using these instruments have found that function and perceived bother 
may not be correlated; patients may express satisfaction with their therapy 
despite loss of sexual function. Erectile aids, including sildenafil, can be 
helpful for patients following treatment for localized prostate cancer.

Development of an index to evaluate symptoms in men with androgen deficiency.

O'leary MP.

Healthier lifestyles and better medical care are contributing to greater life 
expectancy in U.S. males. Couple this with the great emphasis our society places 
on youth, and it is not surprising that older men want to look, feel, and act 
younger. Androgen replacement may have a role in this setting, but it is not 
clear exactly what symptoms signal a problem or warrant therapy. A valid and 
reproducible index that sufficiently defines the problems experienced by 
androgen-deficient men will go a long way toward helping both researchers and 
clinicians better understand and manage these men.

[Bitemporal hemianopia in road traffic].

[Article in German]

Krzizok T(1), Schwerdtfeger G.

BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from pituitary adenomas and diseases of the 
chiasma typically show a bitemporal hemianopia. The residual undisturbed nasal 
visual fields of both eyes should have an extension of (at least) 120 degrees 
and are according to the actual German traffic rules (FeVAndV) for cars of the 
classes A, B, M, L and T. The intact half fields fit geometrically to one 
virtual normal field, that seems to correspond in the centre of a normal field. 
Reports on this problem often do not address correctly the questions of 
suitability for participation in road traffic.
PATIENTS: The case of a patient with typical bitemporal hemianopia illustrates 
the sensorial peculiarities: the functioning temporal retinal halves do not 
correspond. This patient suffered additionally from disturbing diplopia due to a 
small-angle exotropia. The extent of the performed eye muscle surgery was 
selected to induce a slight overcorrection, i. e., resulting in 3 to 5 degrees 
esotropia. This eliminated the diplopia, but resulted in a vertical scotoma of 
the extension of the esotropia.
CONCLUSIONS: In bitemporal hemianopia the undisturbed nasal visual half fields 
do not add up to a "nearly normal field of one eye". Moreover, either diplopia 
or--much more dangerous in traffic--a central vertical scotoma is the result. 
The explanation for this is a sliding of the hemifields of each eye without 
stabilisation by corresponding areas of the retinas of the right and left eyes. 
The peripheral extension of the visual field is not the key to the problem to 
imagine how a patient with typical bitemporal hemianopia will visualise daily 
life and traffic. In bitemporal hemianopia there is substantially no eligibility 
for driving a car or motor bicycle in road traffic.

Cancer Center Burlington, USA.

As the aging population in the United States continues to grow, the incidence of 
diseases of the elderly, such as breast cancer, are increasing. Many more 
elderly women are expected to be diagnosed with new breast cancers, most of them 
in an early stage. Appropriate treatment of these women is important, as they 
have poorer outcomes when undertreated. In this review, we will discuss the 
biology and treatment of early breast cancer in elderly women. We will focus on 
the role of comorbidity and its effect on life expectancy, treatment decisions, 
current recommendations for primary treatment with surgery, radiation and 
neoadjuvant strategies, and adjuvant treatment including local radiation therapy 
and systemic treatment with endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and newer agents. 
Finally we will discuss the importance of clinical trials in the elderly.

The F-box protein Grr1 regulates the stability of Ccn1, Cln3 and Hof1 and cell 
morphogenesis in Candida albicans.

Both G1 and mitotic cyclins have been implicated in regulating Candida albicans 
filamentous growth. We have investigated the functions of Grr1 whose orthologue 
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is known to mediate ubiquitin-dependent degradation 
of the G1 cyclins Cln1 and Cln2. Here, we report that deleting C. albicans GRR1 
causes significant stabilization of two G1 cyclins Ccn1 and Cln3 and 
pseudohyphal growth. grr1Delta cells are highly heterogeneous in length and many 
of them fail to separate after cytokinesis. Interestingly, some isolated 
rod-like G1 cells of similar sizes are present in the grr1Delta culture. 
Time-lapse microscopy revealed that the rod-shaped G1 cells first grew 
exclusively in width before budding and then the bud grew exclusively by apical 
extension until after cytokinesis, yielding rod-like daughter cells. 
Consistently, actin patches persistently localize to the bud tip until around 
the time of cytokinesis. Despite the pseudohyphal phenotype, grr1Delta cells 
respond normally to hyphal induction. Hyperphosphorylated Cln3 isoforms 
accumulate in grr1Delta cells, indicating that Grr1 selectively mediates their 
degradation in wild-type cells. grr1Delta pseudohyphal growth requires neither 
Hgc1 nor Swel, two important regulators of cell morphogenesis. Furthermore, the 
cellular level of Hof1, a protein having a role in cytokinesis, is also 
significantly increased in grr1Delta cells.

Safegarding health has been an objective of every learned civilization, ancient 
and modern. In modern times, at least in the western world, the increase in 
longevity associated with social isolation has created further vu1nerability for 
the older individua1. Today, healthcare is a social burden of extremely high 
cost. Among us this service is provided by the National Health Service in 
accordance to the Constituição da República Portuguesa (Constitution of the 
Portuguese Republic). Despite the constitutional guarantees of equa1ity in 
health there are obvious discrepancies in access to health care and the 
conditions that promote health such as education and wealth. In a poor country, 
even with limited resources, inequa1ity can be minimized via policies and 
practical measures founded in equa1ity and social responsibility, not only the 
principles of economic efficiency. Only in this way can we guarantee equa1 
access to health and the distribution of available resources in accordance to 
health care necessities. Yet, the investment in high technology among us seems 
out of fase with the investment in the area concerning functional recovery from 
high morta1ity illness, such as stroke. In Portugal the problem is extremely 
bad. Life expectancy has been extended but qua1ity of life is still very low. 
Victims of the social order, the elderly live alone without family who can care 
for them; on the other hand, the lack of investment in recovery and social 
integration of individua1s with disabling scars, Turns the ends of their life's 
into a nightmare for themselves and their kin. It follows stating the necessity 
to analyse and define the criteria to be used when allocating resources in order 
to guarantee equality in health and relief from suffering and also to stop 
discrimination of vu1nerable populations in access to healthcare. Whatever the 
criteria, it must be pre-defined and its principles widely discussed, 
reiterating, only that longevity cannot be an acceptable criteria to value life. 
The article concludes drawing attention to the need to invest in health 
education, which is just as important as the fair distribution of precious 
health care resources in reducing harmful risks to the most vulnerable patients.
