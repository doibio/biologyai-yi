BACKGROUND. The Swedish-speaking minority of Finland is unique, because it has a 
higher socioeconomic status (SES) and longer life expectancy than the 
Finnish-speaking majority. We hypothesized that this minority may have a lower 
attack rate of coronary events and analysed whether this could be explained by 
their higher SES. METHODS. The population-based myocardial infarction (MI) 
registers recorded 4,845 MI events in Turku during 1988-1998. Individual-level 
indicators of SES were obtained from Statistics Finland. The population-based 
FINRISK surveys recorded cardiovascular risk factors and native languages of 
10,432 people in 1987, 1997, and 2002. RESULTS. The age-standardized attack rate 
of MI was lower among the 35-64-year-old Swedish-speaking men than among 
Finnish-speaking men (rate ratio 0.66; 95% confidence interval 0.47-0.85) and 
the difference remained significant after adjustment for SES. The 
Swedish-speaking inhabitants had higher age-, sex-, and SES-adjusted 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lower triglycerides, body mass index, 
and diastolic blood pressure. Conclusion. The Swedish-speaking inhabitants of 
Turku had lower MI morbidity and coronary mortality than the Finnish-speaking 
inhabitants. After controlling for SES, these differences remained significant 
among men, suggesting that other factors, such as differences in the risk factor 
profiles may also play a role.

intensive care physicians.

BACKGROUND: Currently, intensive care medicine strives to define a generally 
accepted way of dealing with end-of-life decisions, therapy limitation and 
therapy discontinuation.In 2006 a new advance directive legislation was enacted 
in Austria. Patients may now document their personal views regarding extension 
of treatment. The aim of this survey was to explore Austrian intensive care 
physicians' experiences with and their acceptance of the new advance directive 
legislation two years after enactment (2008).
METHODS: Under the aegis of the OEGARI (Austrian Society of Anaesthesiology, 
Resuscitation and Intensive Care) an anonymised questionnaire was sent to the 
medical directors of all intensive care units in Austria. The questions focused 
on the physicians' experiences regarding advance directives and their level of 
knowledge about the underlying legislation.
RESULTS: There were 241 questionnaires sent and 139 were turned, which was a 
response rate of 58%. About one third of the responders reported having had no 
experience with advance directives and only 9 directors of intensive care units 
had dealt with more than 10 advance directives in the previous two years. 
Life-supporting measures, resuscitation, and mechanical ventilation were the 
predominantly refused therapies, wishes were mainly expressed concerning pain 
therapy.
CONCLUSION: A response rate of almost 60% proves the great interest of intensive 
care professionals in making patient-oriented end-of-life decisions. However, as 
long as patients do not make use of their right of co-determination, the 
enactment of the new law can be considered only a first important step forward.

BACKGROUND: Psychological well-being is associated with mortality/survival. 
Although cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is one of the strongest predictors of 
mortality, studies examining the relationship between well-being and survival 
seldom account for the possible effects of CRF.
PURPOSE: This study examined the independent associations of psychological 
well-being components (low level of negative emotion and high level of positive 
emotion) and CRF, as well as their combined effects, with survival.
METHODS: Participants (N=4888) were examined in 1988-1997 and followed up for a 
median period of ∼15 years (212 deaths, 4.3%). CRF was assessed by a maximal 
exercise test on a treadmill. Low-level negative emotion was defined as the 
minimum score of the negative emotion subscale of the CES-D scale and high-level 
positive emotion as the maximum score of the positive emotion subscale. Results 
are presented as hazard ratios (95% CIs). Data were analyzed in 2009.
RESULTS: After adjustment for a set of established risk factors, men and women 
with low levels of negative emotion had lower risk of death than those with 
higher levels of negative emotion, 0.66 (95% CI=0.50, 0.87). The association 
persisted after additional adjustment for CRF and positive emotion. High level 
of positive emotion was not associated with survival. A high level of CRF 
independently predicted lower risk of death, 0.54 (95% CI=0.37, 0.79), compared 
to a low level of CRF. The risk of death in participants with both a low level 
of negative emotion and a high level of CRF was 0.37 (95% CI=0.22, 0.63), 
compared to their peers with higher levels of negative emotion/low levels of 
CRF.
CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of negative emotion and high levels of CRF are 
independent predictors of long-term survival in men and women. A strong combined 
effect was observed, as individuals with both a low level of negative emotion 
and a high level of CRF had a 63% lower risk of premature death than those with 
higher levels of negative emotion and a low level of CRF.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of elective induction of labor 
at 41 weeks in nulliparous women.
STUDY DESIGN: A decision analytic model comparing induction of labor at 41 weeks 
vs expectant management with antenatal testing until 42 weeks in nulliparas was 
designed. Baseline assumptions were derived from the literature as well as from 
analysis of the National Birth Cohort dataset and included an intrauterine fetal 
demise rate of 0.12% in the 41st week and a cesarean rate of 27% in women 
induced at 41 weeks. One-way and multiway sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
examine the robustness of the findings.
RESULTS: Compared with expectant management, induction of labor is 
cost-effective with an incremental cost of $10,945 per quality-adjusted life 
year gained. Induction of labor at 41 weeks also resulted in a lower rate of 
adverse obstetric outcomes, including neonatal demise, shoulder dystocia, 
meconium aspiration syndrome, and severe perineal lacerations.
CONCLUSION: Elective induction of labor at 41 weeks is cost-effective and 
improves outcomes.

Tacheng Street, Taipei City 103, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Working in clinical practice involves exposure to many hazards, 
resulting in ongoing concerns regarding mortality in doctors when compared with 
the general public.
AIMS: To evaluate the survival data of all Taiwanese doctors and to ascertain 
whether doctors experience premature mortality.
METHODS: Death and census data from 1990 to 2006 were obtained for all 
practising doctors in Taiwan. Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios 
(SMRs) were calculated via the Life Table Analysis System using the general 
population of Taiwan as the reference.
RESULTS: All the SMRs of different medical specialties were below 0.34. Doctors 
in Taiwan were found to be less likely to die from all causes, including suicide 
and drug abuse. The SMRs for suicide and drug abuse were generally below 0.50 
[SMR = 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09-0.21 and SMR = 0.16, 95% CI 
0.07-0.32, respectively].
CONCLUSIONS: The risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality of doctors were 
found to be lower than those of the general population in Taiwan.

Increasing use of standard chemotherapy, especially anthracycline- and 
taxane-based therapies, in early-stage breast cancer has led to a corresponding 
increase in heavily pretreated and/or treatment-resistant cases of metastatic 
breast cancer (MBC). Thus, second and later lines of MBC therapy frequently 
involve the clinically challenging picture of progressive disease and limited 
treatment options. While several prognostic factors have been identified to aid 
treatment selection in MBC patients, treatment is palliative and aimed at 
prolonging survival, controlling symptoms, and maximizing patients' quality of 
life. No globally accepted standard exists for meeting these goals, and 
treatment patterns vary according to region. The list of available agents for 
the treatment of MBC is increasing with newer chemotherapeutic agents and 
molecular-targeted therapies. Within recent years, several single-agent and 
combination chemotherapy regimens have been shown to improve progression-free 
survival and reduce symptoms of disease in clinical studies in patients with 
resistant and/or heavily pretreated MBC. However, at present, the demonstrated 
benefits of these medical interventions have usually not included extension of 
overall survival times. It is hoped that in the near future, ongoing refinements 
to treatment approaches used in second-line settings and beyond will allow 
meaningful improvements in symptom control and survival in MBC.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate outcomes and costs of surveillance strategies after 
treatment for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).
METHODS: A hypothetical cohort of women was evaluated after treatment for CIN 2 
or 3 using a Markov model incorporating data from a large study of women treated 
for CIN, systematic reviews of test accuracy, and individual preferences. 
Surveillance strategies included initial conventional or liquid-based cytology, 
human papillomavirus testing, or colposcopy 6 months after treatment, followed 
by annual or triennial cytology. Estimated outcomes included CIN, cervical 
cancer, cervical cancer deaths, life expectancy, costs, cost per life-year, and 
cost per quality-adjusted life-year.
RESULTS: Conventional cytology at 6 and 12 months, followed by triennial 
cytology, was least costly. Compared with triennial cytology, annual cytology 
follow-up reduced expected cervical cancer deaths by 73% to 77% and had an 
average incremental cost per life-year gained of $69,000 to $81,000. For 
colposcopy followed by annual cytology, the incremental cost per life-year 
gained ranged from $70,000 to more than $1 million, depending on risk. 
Between-strategy differences in mean additional life expectancy per woman were 
less than 4 days; differences in mean incremental costs per woman were as high 
as $822. In the cost-utility analysis, colposcopy at 6 months followed by annual 
cytology had an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year of less than 
$5,500. Human papillomavirus testing or liquid-based cytology added little to no 
improvement to life-expectancy with higher costs.
CONCLUSION: Annual conventional cytology surveillance reduced cervical cancers 
and cancer deaths compared with triennial cytology. For high risk of recurrence, 
a strategy of colposcopy at 6 months increased life expectancy and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy. Human papillomavirus testing and liquid-based 
cytology increased costs, but not effectiveness, compared with traditional 
approaches.

GOALS OF WORK: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation with a reduced-intensity 
regimen (RIST) has been evaluated mostly in terms of its clinical benefit, and 
the pharmacoeconomic aspects of this procedure remain unclear. We compared the 
cost and effectiveness of RIST with those of stem cell transplantation using a 
conventional myeloablative regimen (CST).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients who underwent transplantation 
for myeloid malignancy were included. Life years and medical costs during the 
entire treatment course for up to 2 years after transplantation were evaluated, 
and cost-effectiveness was assessed from the payer's perspective.
MAIN RESULTS: Of these 50 cases, 35 were treated with CST and 15 were treated 
with RIST. The mean survival time was 1.5 years in CST and 1.2 years in RIST, 
while the mean total cost per patient within the first 2 years was $29,630 for 
CST and $29,466 for RIST, with no significant difference. The duration of total 
hospitalization was shorter in RIST than in CST; then, the cost for 
hospitalization represented a lower proportion of the total cost in RIST (49% of 
total cost) than in CST (63%). In contrast, the cost related to the conditioning 
regimen was significantly higher in RIST than in CST.
CONCLUSIONS: This result suggests that the increased cost of the conditioning 
regimen offsets the reduced cost of hospitalization in RIST. Although some 
differences were observed in the details of the cost, the total cost and mean 
survival were comparable between CST and RIST, and this result was confirmed by 
a probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

Asynchronous PCR.

Chen C(1), Ruff D, Halsey J.

Author information:

Foster City, CA, USA.

Asynchronous PCR (aPCR) is a new PCR method that directs an ordered and 
sequential amplification of the + and - strands of DNA amplicons. There are 
several unique characteristics of aPCR that generate new application 
opportunities. The melting temperature (Tm) of the forward and reverse aPCR 
primers differ by at least 15°C. The concentration of the lower Tm primer is 
reduced from 900 to 100 nM, thereby allowing for asynchronous or asymmetric 
strand-specific amplification. Furthermore, unique thermocycling parameter 
strategy dictates the + and - strand amplification cue. Each aPCR cycle includes 
two annealing and extension steps. Sequential annealing and extension of forward 
and reverse primers during each cycle produce transient single-stranded DNA 
(ssDNA) amplicons which help hybridization-based probes such as peptide nucleic 
acid (PNA) bind to the target sequences more effectively. This new method can be 
used in real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for gene expression analyses as well 
as production of robust ssDNA targets for microarray and other 
hybridization-based applications.

Thinking about it: thoughts about health and valuing QALYs.

Dolan P(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Social Policy, London School of Economics and Political 
Science, London, UK. p.h.dolan@lse.ac.uk

When valuing health states (e.g., for use in the assessment of health 
technologies), health economists often ask respondents how many years of life in 
poor health they would be willing to trade-off in order to live in full health. 
Problems with preferences of this kind have led to calls for the use of more 
direct measures of the utility associated with experiencing a health state. The 
fact remains, however, that individuals are often willing to make large 
sacrifices in life expectancy to alleviate conditions for which there appears to 
be a considerable degree of hedonic adaptation. The purpose of this study is to 
investigate this important discrepancy in more detail. Data from 1173 internet 
and telephone surveys in the United States suggest that time trade-off responses 
are related to the frequency and intensity of negative thoughts about health in 
ways that may not be very well captured by any of the proposed valuation 
methods.

Managing the aging man in Asia: a review.

Tong SF(1), Ho C, Tan HM.

Author information:
(1)Department of Family Medicine, National University of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia. sengfahtong@gmail.com

The aging man is becoming a major burden to Asian countries because of the 
current poor health status of Asian men and the aging Asian population. Life 
expectancy at birth for men is shorter than women by an average of 4 years in 
Asian countries and major causes of death are cardiovascular disease, cancers, 
injuries and infections. However, there are considerable variations between 
Asian countries because of great disparity in socioeconomic status. 
Male-specific disorders, such as male sexual health and urological conditions, 
are other major health burdens because they have a great impact on men's quality 
of life. More importantly, many risk factors to the causes of mortality and 
morbidities, such as high-risk behavior and smoking, can be improved with health 
promotion and early intervention. The current evidence suggests that the poor 
health status of men is the result of their poor health care utilization, 
negative health-seeking behavior, the adverse social environment for men and 
gender-insensitive health care delivery. However, much evidence is still needed 
as Asian countries have great diversity in culture, societal values and men's 
needs. Asian time-tested wisdom on a balanced healthy lifestyle to longevity 
should be explored as potential men's health promotional programs. Taking into 
account Asian men's health-care needs, a gender-streamlined approach and 
man-friendly health care delivery should be on the national agenda in managing 
the aging man.

BACKGROUND: Hypertension is common after renal transplantation, affecting as 
many as 80% of recipients. It is generally accepted that hypertension is 
associated with poor graft survival and reduced life expectancy because of 
increased cardiovascular risk factors. The prevalence of refractory hypertension 
in renal transplant recipients is unknown, and could be associated with a poor 
prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of refractory hypertension on 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) after renal transplantation in 486 patients with 
grafts functioning for longer than 1 year.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were classified into 2 groups: (1) 57 with 
refractory hypertension, that is, systolic blood pressure 130 mm Hg or greater 
or diastolic blood pressure 80 mm Hg or greater, and receiving treatment with at 
least 3 drugs, one of which was a diuretic; and (2) the remaining 429 patients. 
Patient and graft survival, and posttransplantation CVD were analyzed.
RESULTS: Refractory hypertension was associated with male sex (82.5% vs 66.5% 
[P<.01]), poor renal function (mean [SD] serum creatinine concentration 2.2 
[1.2] mg/dL vs 1.6 [0.6] mg/dL; Modification of Diet in Renal Disease score 39.2 
[20.0] mL/min/1.73 m2 vs 49.2 [18.0] mL/min/1.73 m2 [P=.000]; and steroid 
therapy (94.7% vs 79.0% [P=.001]). In the group with refractory hypertension, 
5-year patient and graft survival rates were lower, and the incidence of 
posttransplantation CVD was greater (relative risk, 1.7; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.05-2.18; P=.03).
CONCLUSION: Refractory hypertension is an independent risk factor for increased 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in renal transplant recipients.

Renal transplantation is the best therapeutic choice in patients with end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD), with donation from living donors the alternative that 
offers the best medium- and long-term results. Because of the limited number of 
cadaver donors and the progressive increase in donor age, transplantation from 
living donors has become the renal replacement treatment of choice. Several 
studies have demonstrated that donation does not increase the donor's risk of 
developing ESRD in the long term. Some studies have asserted that a donor's life 
expectancy increases as a result of the comprehensive study and screening 
process they must undergo. The objective of the present study was to evaluate 
the vital status and onset of chronic renal disease in 101 living kidney donors 
in Andalusia, Spain, during 2006-2009, based on data obtained from the Sistema 
de Información de la Coordinación Autonómica de Trasplantes de Andalucía 
(Regional Transplants Coordination of Andalusia). Donor survival was 99%, and 
the only death, from lung cancer, was not associated with the surgical 
procedure. Only 5 transplants failed during this period, and no donors developed 
ESRD. Neither the probability of survival nor the risk of developing ESRD in 
donors was influenced by kidney donation.

Medical University, Shanghai, China.

BACKGROUND: Antireflux stents that prevent duodenal biliary reflux may improve 
biliary drainage and prolong stent patency. However, the use of antireflux metal 
stents (ARMSs) in the human biliary system has not been reported.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ARMSs for the palliation of 
unresectable distal biliary malignancies.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective case series in a tertiary referral center.
PATIENTS: From August 2007 to April 2009, a total of 23 patients with 
unresectable nonhilar malignant biliary obstruction.
INTERVENTION: Endoscopic placement of an ARMS.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Technical success and early complications with 
follow-up of stent patency and patient survival.
RESULTS: Placement of an ARMS was successful on the first attempt in all 
patients. There were no procedure-related complications. Follow-up was obtained 
in 22 cases. Serum bilirubin level returned to normal within 1 month of stenting 
in 20 patients. Six stent malfunctions occurred as a result of tumor ingrowth (1 
patient), tumor overgrowth (2 patients), and stent migration (3 patients). The 
remaining patients were free of biliary symptoms until death or final follow-up. 
The median duration of stent patency of ARMSs was 14 months, with cumulative 
patency rates at 3, 6, and 12 months of 95%, 74%, and 56%, respectively. The 
median survival of the patients was 7.9 months (range, 1-14 months).
LIMITATIONS: Small number of patients in single endoscopy center.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic insertion of an ARMS is technically feasible, safe, and 
effective in patients with distal malignant biliary obstruction. The impact of 
ARMSs in prolonging stent patency and life expectancy deserves further 
randomized evaluation.

Would the effect of HPV vaccination on non-cervical HPV-positive cancers make 
the difference for its cost-effectiveness?

Besides cervical cancer, the human papillomavirus (HPV) is found in other 
cancers and may be preventable with HPV vaccination. However, these other 
cancers are often not accounted for in cost-effectiveness analyses of HPV 
vaccination. This study estimates the potential maximum effect on the 
cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) of HPV vaccination in preventing non-cervical 
HPV-positive cancers. For the Dutch situation, a mathematical equation was used 
to estimate the maximum impact if all cancer cases of the penis, vulva/vagina, 
anus, oral cavity and oro-pharynx with HPV16/18 are prevented, in terms of 
number of life years gained, savings and improvement in the CER of the 
vaccination. For other countries and for future developments, we show how the 
impact on the CER varies depending on the incidence of cervical/non-cervical HPV 
16/18-positive cancers, vaccine costs and clinical costs. If in the Netherlands 
all HPV 16/18-positive cancers are prevented by vaccination in women only, 
compared to if only HPV 16/18-positive cervical cancer is prevented, the life 
years gained increase with 14%, the savings increase with 18%, and the CER 
decreases with 13%. If vaccination prevents HPV-positive cancers in both men and 
women, these figures increase to 25%, 26% and 21%, respectively. In conclusion, 
if HPV vaccination fully prevents all non-cervical HPV-positive cancers, this 
would substantially increase its cost-effectiveness. The impact of the 
vaccination varies depending on the incidence of cervical/non-cervical 
HPV16/18-positive cancers, the vaccine costs and clinical costs. Observed 
combinations of these parameters in different countries show a decrease in the 
CER between 10% and 31%.

Cytotoxic effect of tobacco extracts on human oral squamous cell carcinoma 
cell-line.

Cancer is a public health problem worldwide. Incidences of oral carcinomas are 
increasing in the last decades, and the developed countries are the most 
affected. Current therapeutic options for this type of cancer are aggressive 
and/or invasive, including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In addition, 
they have not yet translated into an improvement of life quality or expectancy 
to patients. In this scenario, new therapeutics are urgently needed and actively 
sought after. The goal of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of 
tobacco crude extract (TCE) and two fractions thereof in the human lineage of 
oral squamous cell carcinoma, OSCC-3. Exposure of human oral cancer cells to 
TCE-induced cell death and decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. 
Of the fractions tested, one was able to induce significant cell death (over 
50%) after 48 h treatment. DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation indicated 
that the type of cell death induced by TCE and its fraction was apoptosis. Our 
results indicate that tobacco contains compounds that could be useful in 
inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. More specifically, because of the neutral 
chemical nature of the fraction capable of inducing apoptosis, we postulate that 
the putative compound responsible for the cell death is non-polar. Further 
investigation is needed to uncover its chemical nature and structure.

[Supra-aortic trunks occlusive disease: three different treatment approaches].

Unlike carotid bifurcation atherosclerotic stenosis, supra-aortic trunks (SAT) 
occlusive disease is rare and its revascularization uncommon, accouting for less 
than 10% of the operations performed on the extracranial brain-irrigating 
arteries. There are three different treatment approaches: transthoracic, 
extra-anatomic cervical and endovascular. Endovascular repair is gaining 
popularity as first-line therapy for proximal lesions with favorable anatomy 
because of its low morbidity and rare mortality. Extra-anatomic bypass is a safe 
and durable reconstruction and should be considered in patients with single 
vessel disease, with cardiopulmonary high-risk or with limited life expectancy. 
If cardiac surgery is needed, central transthoracic reconstruction is 
preferable, and the two procedures should be combined. The long-term patency of 
bypasses with aortic origin, specially when multiple vessels are involved, is 
superior to other repair techniques. We present three clinical cases that 
illustrate each of these therapeutic strategies: central brachiocephalic 
revascularization and synchronous cardiac surgery in a patient with complex SAT 
atherosclerosis disease; subclavian-carotid transposition for disabling upper 
limb claudication; and subclavian artery stenting for subclavian-steal syndrome. 
Surgical approach selection should be based on the individual patient's anatomy 
and operative risk.

Biogerontology in Ukraine: update.

Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine.

Recent biogerontological findings in Ukraine are critically reviewed. It is 
stressed that cooperation of efforts within and between departments, 
institutions and countries is an efficient mode of coping with the complex 
problems of aging. A wide spectrum of aging research was traditionally performed 
in state-funded institutions throughout the country, focusing primarily on the 
neuro-humoral regulation, immune system, adaptation, oxidative stress, 
comparative analysis and life span extension. Mitochondria and associated 
oxidative stress seem to be a crossroad of "wet" and in silico research traffics 
aimed underpinning mechanisms of aging and life span extension. For instance, 
the highest coefficients of determination of the mammalian maximum life span 
were associated with mitochondrial DNA base composition and insertions into the 
nuclear DNA (NUMTs). The main conclusions of the multidirectional investigative 
endeavors could concisely be described as: modifications of the mitochondrial 
membrane resulted in alterations in ROS generation, metabolism, and life span; 
coordinated action of the key antioxidant genes and enzymes is an important 
issue in successful aging; lateral hypothalamic area could be a 
morpho-functional center of anti-aging in CNS; lymphoid tissue microenvironment 
is crucial in determination of functionality of the transplanted cells; gene and 
polypeptide therapy proved to be a perspective approach in treatment of 
accelerated aging; artificial atmosphere with optimal gaseous composition could 
be an efficient mean for life span extension and viability enhancement.

After casting doubt on malaria as the cause of death for Tutankhamun, the author 
points out that the hypothesis of homozygotic sickle-cell anaemia, or a double 
HbS/β₀thal heterozygosis, is hardly more credible. To have any chance of being 
valid, any such hypothesis would have to involve a combination of at least three 
rare factors: survival until the age of 19 of a subject with homozygotic 
sickle-cell anaemia, with a probability at birth as to a life expectancy of more 
than five years probably standing at less than 5%, and with, for all bone 
sequelae and anomalies, osteonecrosis whose location is characteristic, not of 
sickle-cell anaemia, but rather of a case of Freiberg-Kohler syndrome, which is 
also rare, but which is on the other hand fully compatible with the condition of 
the mummy's skeleton.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the tolerability and 
effectiveness of the methylphenidate transdermal system (MTS) over 6 months in 
adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
METHODS: This was an industry-sponsored, 30-center, open-label study of subjects 
aged 13-17 years with ADHD. Subjects were dose-optimized with MTS (10-30 mg/9 
hours) over 5 weeks and then dose-maintained for up to 5 months. Tolerability 
evaluations included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and dermal 
responses. Effectiveness was assessed with the ADHD-Rating Scale-IV 
(ADHD-RS-IV).
RESULTS: A total of 162 subjects received MTS treatment. The majority of TEAEs 
(>99%) were mild or moderate in intensity, and the most frequently reported TEAE 
was decreased appetite (15.4%). Thirteen subjects discontinued the study due to 
TEAEs. The majority (93.6%) of dermatologic reactions indicated mild erythema. 
There was significant improvement in mean ADHD-RS-IV total scores from study 
entry to end point (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Slightly more than half (54.0%) of subjects completed this 6-month, 
open-label extension study of MTS; the primary reason for discontinuation was 
withdrawn consent (36.0%). Reported TEAEs and skin tolerability findings were 
similar to those observed with MTS use in children and adolescents. MTS 
treatment resulted in a decrease in ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians.

INTRODUCTION: To determine the significance of prostate weight (PW) on clinical 
and pathological outcomes in patients undergoing da Vinci robot assisted 
laparoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy (EP-RARP).
METHODS: From November 2008 to January 2010, 295 men underwent EP-RARP at our 
institution. We retrospectively reviewed our database and stratified patients 
into four groups based on pathologic PW: Group 1, less than 30 g; Group 2, 30 g 
to less than 50 g; Group 3, 50 g to less than 80 g; and Group 4, 80 g or larger. 
We prospectively compared these groups with respect to patient age, body mass 
index, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, pathological stage, margin 
status, operative time, blood loss, transfusion rate and length of stay. 
Statistical analysis was performed using SYSTAT 13 software. An analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) model was used to compare the continuous variables among the 
groups. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare categorical 
variables.
RESULTS: Of the 295 patients, 10, 182, 91, and 12 had a PW of less than 30 g; 30 
g to less than 50 g; 50 g to less than 80 g; and 80 g or larger, respectively. A 
significant difference was found in age, prostate weight and prostate-specific 
antigen values among the four groups (p < 0.05). Patients in Group 4 had larger 
prostates, were older (mean age 65 years), had higher pretreatment 
prostate-specific antigen (median 5.85 ng/mL) and lower Gleason score (mean 
6.2). Based on the D'Amico risk stratification, our study showed a trend toward 
higher risk disease, presence of extra capsular extension, seminal vesicle 
invasion and positive margin status in Groups 1, 2 and 3 rather than in Group 4. 
No significant differences in operative time, estimated blood loss, transfusion 
rate, hospital stay, and postoperative complication rate were observed among the 
four groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Da Vinci robot assisted laparoscopic extraperitoneal radical 
prostatectomy (EP-RARP) is feasible in patients with larger prostates, offering 
acceptable operative times, blood loss, hospital stay and complication rates. In 
our cohort of patients, we found pathologically smaller prostates are generally 
associated with higher Gleason score, higher risk group stratification and 
positive surgical margin status. Although technically challenging, increased 
prostate weight should not be considered a contraindication for EP-RARP if 
performed by experienced surgeons.

Review of regulatory recommendations for orphan drug submissions in the 
Netherlands and Scotland: focus on the underlying pharmacoeconomic evaluations.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacoeconomic evaluations of new drug therapies are often 
required for reimbursement or guidance decisions. However, for orphan drugs, 
country-specific requirements exist. In the Netherlands, orphan drug developers 
can be exempted from providing a full pharmacoeconomic evaluation, whereas in 
Scotland, no such exceptions can be made, although additional modifying factors 
specific to orphan products may be considered.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present work was to identify differences in the 
outcomes of the recommendations for orphan drugs for rare diseases between 2 
European countries: Scotland and the Netherlands.
METHODS: All orphan drug reports to the Dutch Committee for Pharmaceutical 
Assistance (Commissie Farma-ceutische Hulp [CFH]) and orphan drugs guidance 
issued by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) through May 2009 were reviewed 
from the respective organizations' Web sites. The following were gathered from 
the pharmacoeconomic analyses and recommendations for reimbursement in the 
Netherlands or guidance for drug use in Scotland: drug indication, outcome of 
pharmacoeconomic evaluation, recommendation, and exact date.
RESULTS: Dossiers for 38 orphan drugs were submitted to the CFH; 37 were 
submitted to the SMC. Only 1 submission to the CFH included a full 
pharmacoeconomic analysis; all other reports included only a cost analysis. 
Twenty-four submissions to the SMC were accompanied by a full pharmacoeconomic 
evaluation; no information could be obtained for 4 drugs. The remaining reports 
either did not include a cost-effectiveness analysis or were deemed insufficient 
by the SMC. Forty-three percent (10/23) of the cost-utility analyses submitted 
to the SMC reported an unfavorable outcome of more than £30,000/ 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained; of these, only 2 (20%) reporting 
incremental cost-utility ratios of £43.717 to £81.000 were granted a restricted 
positive recommendation. The CFH gave positive recommendations for reimbursement 
for 36 of 38 submissions (95%). Of the 37 orphan drugs submitted to the SMC, 19 
(51%) received a positive recommendation for use. Seventy-three percent (8/11) 
of submissions to the SMC with an unfavorable cost-effectiveness estimate (ie, 
more than £30,000 [€34,000 or US $48,000] per QALY gained) received a negative 
recommendation for reimbursement.
CONCLUSIONS: Ninety-five percent of orphan drug submissions were approved for 
reimbursement in the Netherlands, compared with 51% in Scotland, during the 
period of interest. Moreover, cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses were 
included in 24 of 37 submissions in Scotland, compared with only 1 of 38 in the 
Netherlands.

Insights into Cdc13 dependent telomere length regulation.

Mason M(1), Skordalakes E.

Author information:
(1)The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19103, USA.

Cdc13 is a single stranded telomere binding protein that specifically localizes 
to the telomere ends of budding yeasts and is essential for cell viability. It 
caps the ends of chromosomes thus preventing chromosome end-to-end fusions and 
exonucleolytic degradation, events that could lead to genomic instability and 
senescence, the hallmark of aging. Cdc13 is also involved in telomere length 
regulation by recruiting or preventing access of telomerase to the telomeric 
overhang. Recruitment of telomerase to the telomeres for G-strand extension is 
required for continuous cell division, while preventing its access to the 
telomeres through capping the chromosome ends prevents mitotic events that could 
lead to cell immortality, the hall mark of carcinogenesis. Cdc13 and its 
putative homologues human CTC1 and POT1 are therefore key to many biological 
processes directly associated with life extension and cancer prevention and can 
be viewed as an ideal target for cancer and age related therapies.
