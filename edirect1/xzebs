Extensive literature reports an increase in physical disorders (pain, 
pathologies, dysfunctions) and mental malaise/uneasiness (stress, burnout) 
affecting dental professionals in relation to fast and pressing rhythms of work, 
long working hours, increasingly demanding patients, ever-evolving technologies, 
etc. This project has been conceived to bring the science of yoga around the 
world to dental professionals as a preventive (occupational) medicine and to 
provide knowledge and means for self-care. Yoga is a concentrative 
self-discipline of the mind, senses, and physical body, that requires regular 
daily exercise (or meditation), attention, intention, and disciplined action. 
M&M: The study aimed to design a Yoga protocol specifically devised for dental 
professionals (dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants) including 
positions (āsana) to be practiced/used in the dental office. The protocol is 
targeted for the upper body, namely neck, upper back, chest, shoulder girdle, 
and wrists, being areas greatly affected by work-related musculoskeletal 
disorders. This paper represents a yoga-based guideline for the self-cure of 
musculoskeletal disorders among dental professionals. Results: The protocol 
includes both sitting (Upavistha position) and standing (Utthana or Sama 
position) āsana, with twisting (Parivrtta), side bending (Parsva), flexion and 
forward bending (Pashima), and extension and arching (Purva) āsana to mobilize 
and decompress, and to provide nourishment and oxygen to the musculo-articular 
system. The paper delivers different concepts and theories developed and 
deepened by the authors and introduces and spreads yoga as a medical science 
among dental professionals for the prevention and treatment of work-related 
musculoskeletal disorders. We articulate notions ranging from stretching out 
using the vinyāsa method (breath-driven movement) and inward-focused attention 
to contemplative/concentrative science, interoceptive attention, self-awareness, 
the mind-body connection, and receptive attitude. The theory of "muscles are 
bone ties" is coined and delivered with regard to tensegrity musculoskeletal 
fascial structures connecting, pulling together, and nearing the bone segments 
where they are anchored. The paper describes over 60 āsana envisaged to be 
performed on dental stools or using the walls of a dental office or a dental 
unit chair. A detailed guideline on the work-related disorders that can find 
relief with the protocol is provided, including the description of breath 
control for the practice of āsana in vinyāsa. The foundations of the technique 
reside in the IyengarYoga method and ParināmaYoga method. Conclusions: This 
paper represents a guideline for self-cure in the prevention or treatment of 
musculoskeletal disorders affecting dental professionals. Yoga is a powerful 
concentrative self-discipline able to provide physical and mental well-being, 
representing great help and support in daily life and business for dental 
professionals. Yógāsana restores retracted and stiff muscles, giving relief to 
the strained and tired limbs of dental professionals. Yoga is not intended for 
flexible or physically performing persons but for people who decide to take care 
of themselves. The practice of specific āsana represents a powerful tool for the 
prevention or treatment of MSDs related to poor posture, forward head, chronic 
neck tension (and related headache), depressed chest, compressive disorders on 
wrists and shoulders as carpal tunnel, impingement syndromes, outlet syndrome, 
subacromial pain syndrome and spinal disc pathologies. Yoga, as an integrative 
science in medicine and public health, represents a powerful tool for the 
prevention and treatment of occupational musculoskeletal disorders and an 
extraordinary path for the self-care of dental professionals, sitting job 
workers, and healthcare providers suffering from occupational biomechanical 
stresses and awkward postures.

BACKGROUND: Priapism is a very rare complication of malignancy and is usually 
accompanied by locally advanced or widely metastatic disease. We describe a case 
of priapism arising in a 46-year-old male with localised rectal cancer that was 
responding to therapy.
CASE PRESENTATION: This patient had just completed two weeks of neoadjuvant, 
long-course chemoradiation when he presented with persistent painful penile 
erection. Assessment and diagnosis were delayed for more than 60 h, and although 
a cause could not be determined from imaging, a near complete radiological 
response of the primary rectal cancer was seen. His symptoms were refractory to 
urologic intervention and were associated with extreme psychological distress. 
He re-presented shortly thereafter with extensively metastatic disease in the 
lungs, liver, pelvis, scrotum, and penis; additionally, multiple venous 
thromboses were identified, including in the dorsal penile veins. His priapism 
was not reversible and was associated with a considerable symptom burden for the 
remainder of his life. His malignancy did not respond to first-line palliative 
chemotherapy or radiation, and his clinical course was further complicated by 
obstructive nephropathy, ileus, and genital skin breakdown with a suspected 
infection. We initiated comfort measures, and he ultimately died in hospital 
less than five months after his initial presentation.
CONCLUSION: Priapism in cancer is usually related to tumour infiltration of the 
penis and corporal bodies resulting in poor venous and lymphatic drainage. The 
management is palliative and can include chemotherapy, radiation, surgical 
shunting, and potentially penectomy; however, conservative penis-sparing therapy 
may be reasonable in patients with limited life expectancy.

Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGR's) have revolutionized the treatment 
of early-onset scoliosis (EOS) because painless lengthenings can be done in the 
outpatient clinic without anesthesia. Untreated EOS leads to respiratory 
insufficiency and reduced life expectancy. However, MCGR's have inherent 
complications like non-functioning of the lengthening mechanism. We quantify an 
important failure mechanism and give advice on how to avoid this complication. 
The magnetic field strength was measured on new/explanted rods at different 
distances between the external remote controller and the MCGR and likewise in 
patients before/after distractions. The magnetic field strength of the internal 
actuator decayed fast with increasing distances and plateaued at 25-30 mm 
approximating zero. Two new and 12 explanted MCGRs was used for the lab 
measurements of the elicited force using a forcemeter. At a distance of 25 mm, 
the force was reduced to approximately 40% (ca. 100 N) compared to zero distance 
(ca. 250 N), most so for explanted rods. This is used to point out the 
importance of minimizing the implantation depth to ensure proper functionality 
of the rod lengthening in clinical use for EOS patients. A distance of 25 mm 
from skin to MCGR should be considered a relative contraindication to clinical 
use in EOS patients.

OBJECTIVE: This study prospectively observed the incidence of all malignancies 
and the prognosis of all patients in a population of patients who achieved 
Sustained Virological Response (SVR) with a 100% capture rate.
DESIGN: A prospective study of 651 SVR cases was conducted from July 2013 to 
December 2021. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of all malignancies, and 
the secondary endpoint was overall survival. The cancer incidence during the 
follow-up period was calculated using the man-year method, and risk factors were 
analyzed. In addition, sex- and age-matched standardized mortality ratio (SMR) 
was used to compare the general population with the study population.
RESULTS: The overall median follow-up was 5.44 years. 107 malignancies occurred 
in 99 patients during the follow-up. The incidence of all malignancies was 
3.94/100 person-years. The cumulative incidence was 3.6% at 1 year, 11.1% at 
3 years, and 17.9% at 5 years, and continued to increase almost linearly. The 
incidence of liver cancer and non-liver cancer was 1.94/100 patient-years vs. 
1.81%/100 patient-years. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 
99.3%, 96.5%, and 94.4%, respectively. This life expectancy was compared to the 
standardized mortality ratio of the Japanese population, which proved 
non-inferior.
CONCLUSION: It was found that malignancies of other organs occur as frequently 
as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, follow-up of patients who have 
achieved SVR should focus not only on HCC but also on malignant tumors of other 
organs, and lifelong follow could contribute prolonged life expectancy for the 
previously short-lived.

Significant coronary artery disease (CAD) is a frequent finding in patients with 
severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation 
(TAVI), and the management of these two conditions becomes of particular 
importance with the extension of the procedure to younger and lower-risk 
patients. Yet, the preprocedural diagnostic evaluation and the indications for 
treatment of significant CAD in TAVI candidates remain a matter of debate. In 
this clinical consensus statement, a group of experts from the European 
Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) in 
collaboration with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Working Group on 
Cardiovascular Surgery aims to review the available evidence on the topic and 
proposes a rationale for the diagnostic evaluation and indications for 
percutaneous revascularisation of CAD in patients with severe aortic stenosis 
undergoing transcatheter treatment. Moreover, it also focuses on commissural 
alignment of transcatheter heart valves and coronary re-access after TAVI and 
redo-TAVI.

BACKGROUND: Nurse-client interaction when providing nursing services is limited 
to optimizing treatment and self-care, with limited focus on the psychological 
problems of people living with HIV-AIDS. However, psychological problems 
manifest more often than the health risks of the disease itself. This study 
aimed to determine the emotional response of people living with HIV-AIDS who 
received limited attention from nurses from the perspective of nurse-client 
relationship.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phenomenological qualitative design was used through 
in-depth face-to-face interviews in a semi-structured manner, in an effort to 
obtain complete data. This research used purposive sampling with Participatory 
Interpretative Phenomenology analysis, involving 22 participants (14 males and 8 
females).
RESULTS: This research produces several themes, with six subcategories: 1) 
Difficulty of social access, 2) Forcing to accept their situation and 
suppressing their will, 3) Wanting to be recognized like other people in 
general, 4) Social stigma and self-stigmatization affecting surroundings, 5) 
Lacking enthusiasm for life expectancy, 6) Always lingering under the shadow 
"when death picks up."
CONCLUSION: The results showed that mental stress was experienced more than 
physical problems by people living with HIV-AIDS, thus prompting new changes to 
nursing services for HIV-AIDS patients that emphasize psychosocial aspects, in 
addition to clinical features, facilitated by satisfying relationships between 
nurses and clients to provide quality services.

The giant single-celled eukaryote, Spirostomum, exhibits one of the fastest 
movements in the biological world. This ultrafast contraction is dependent on 
Ca2+ rather than ATP and therefore differs to the actin-myosin system in muscle. 
We obtained the high-quality genome of Spirostomum minus from which we 
identified the key molecular components of its contractile apparatus, including 
two major Ca2+ binding proteins (Spasmin 1 and 2) and two giant proteins (GSBP1 
and GSBP2), which act as the backbone and allow for the binding of hundreds of 
spasmins. The evidence suggests that the GSBP-spasmin protein complex is the 
functional unit of the mesh-like contractile fibrillar system, which, coupled 
with various other subcellular structures, provides the mechanism for repetitive 
ultrafast cell contraction and extension. These findings improve our 
understanding of the Ca2+-dependent ultrafast movement and provide a blueprint 
for future biomimicry, design, and construction of this kind of micromachine.

Reduced activity of insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) extends 
health and life span in mammals. Loss of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (Irs1) 
gene increases survival in mice and causes tissue-specific changes in gene 
expression. However, the tissues underlying IIS-mediated longevity are currently 
unknown. Here, we measured survival and health span in mice lacking IRS1 
specifically in liver, muscle, fat, and brain. Tissue-specific loss of IRS1 did 
not increase survival, suggesting that lack of IRS1 in more than one tissue is 
required for life-span extension. Loss of IRS1 in liver, muscle, and fat did not 
improve health. In contrast, loss of neuronal IRS1 increased energy expenditure, 
locomotion, and insulin sensitivity, specifically in old males. Neuronal loss of 
IRS1 also caused male-specific mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of Atf4, 
and metabolic adaptations consistent with an activated integrated stress 
response at old age. Thus, we identified a male-specific brain signature of 
aging in response to reduced IIS associated with improved health at old age.

Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.

OBJECTIVES: Abdominal aortic aneurysmal (AAA) repair in patients with 
concomitant cancer is controversial due to increased comorbidity and reduced 
life expectancy in this specific patient group. This literature review aims to 
investigate the evidence supporting one treatment modality over another 
(endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) or open repair (OR)), as well as treatment 
strategy (staged AAA-, cancer first or simultaneous procedures) in patients with 
AAA and concomitant cancer.
METHODS: Literature review, including studies published from 2000 to 2021 on 
surgical treatment in patients with AAA and concomitant cancer and related 
outcomes (30-day morbidity/complications as well as 30-day and 3-year 
mortality).
RESULTS: 24 studies comprising 560 patients undergoing surgical treatment of AAA 
and concomitant cancer were included. Of these, 220 cases were treated with EVAR 
and 340 with OR. Simultaneous procedures were performed in 190 cases, 370 
received staged procedures. The 30-day mortality for EVAR versus OR was 1% and 
8%, corresponding to a relative risk (RR) of 0.11 (95% CI: 0.03-0.46, p = 
0.002). No difference in mortality was observed between staged versus 
simultaneous procedure nor between AAA-first versus cancer-first strategy, RR 
0.59 (95% CI: 0.29-1.1, p = 0.13) and 0.88 (95% CI 0.34-2.31, p = 0.80), 
respectively. Overall, 3-year mortality was 21% for EVAR and 39% for OR from 
2000-2021, while the mortality up to 3 years after EVAR within recent years 
(2015-2021) was 16%.
CONCLUSION: This review supports EVAR treatment as first choice if suitable. No 
consensus was established on treating either the aneurysm or the cancer first or 
simultaneously. Long-term mortality after EVAR was comparable to non-cancer 
patients within recent years.

BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal diseases have a clinical and economic impact on the 
population. Until this year, a 10-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV10) used to be 
applied in Colombia, which does not contain serotypes 19A, 3, and 6A, the most 
prevalent in the country. Therefore, we aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of the shift to the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A decision model was used for newborns in Colombia 
between 2022-2025 and adults over 65 years. The time horizon was life 
expectancy. Outcomes are Invasive Pneumococcal Diseases (IPD), 
Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), Acute Otitis Media (AOM), their sequelae, 
Life Gained Years (LYGs), and herd effect in older adults.
RESULTS: PCV10 covers 4.27% of serotypes in the country, while PCV13 covers 
64.4%. PCV13 would avoid in children 796 cases of IPD, 19,365 of CAP, 1,399 
deaths, and generate 44,204 additional LYGs, as well as 9,101 cases of AOM, 13 
cases of neuromotor disability and 428 cochlear implants versus PCV10. In older 
adults, PCV13 would avoid 993 cases of IPD and 17,245 of CAP, versus PCV10. 
PCV13 saves $51.4 million. The decision model shows robustness in the 
sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: PCV13 is a cost-saving strategy versus PCV10 to avoid pneumococcal 
diseases.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is no consensus concerning the appropriate use of 
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) during primary and postoperative 
external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in the management of prostate cancer (PCa). 
Thus, the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) Advisory 
Committee for Radiation Oncology Practice (ACROP) guidelines seeks to present 
current recommendations for the clinical use of ADT in the various indications 
of EBRT.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE PubMed that 
evaluated EBRT and ADT in prostate cancer. The search focused on randomized, 
Phase II and III trials published in English from January 2000 to May 2022. In 
case topics were addressed in the absence of Phase II or III trials, 
recommendations were labelled accordingly based on the limited body of evidence. 
Localized PCa was classified according to D'Amico et al. classification in low-, 
intermediate and high risk PCa. The ACROP clinical committee identified 13 
European experts who discussed and analyzed the body of evidence concerning the 
use of ADT with EBRT for prostate cancer.
RESULTS: Key issues were identified and are discussed: It was concluded that no 
additional ADT is recommended for low-risk prostate cancer patients, whereas for 
intermediate- and high-risk patients four to six months and two to three years 
of ADT are recommended. Likewise, patients with locally advanced prostate cancer 
are recommended to receive ADT for two to three years and when ≥ 2 high-risk 
factors (cT3-4, ISUP grade ≥ 4 or PSA ≥ 40 ng/ml) or cN1 is present ADT for 
three years plus additional Abiraterone for two years is recommended. For 
postoperative patients no ADT is recommended for adjuvant EBRT in pN0 patients 
whereas for pN1 patients adjuvant EBRT with long-term ADT is performed for at 
least 24 to 36 months. In the setting of salvage EBRT ADT is performed in 
biochemically persistent PCa patients with no evidence of metastatic disease. 
Long-term ADT (24 months) is recommended in pN0 patients with high risk of 
further progression (PSA ≥ 0.7 ng/ml and ISUP grade group ≥ 4) and a life 
expectancy of over ten years, whereas short-term ADT (6 months) is recommended 
in pN0 patients with lower risk profile (PSA < 0.7 ng/ml and ISUP grade group 
4). Patients considered for ultra-hypofractionated EBRT as well as patients with 
image based local recurrence within the prostatic fossa or lymph node recurrence 
should participate in appropriate clinical trials evaluating the role of 
additional ADT.
CONCLUSION: These ESTRO-ACROP recommendations are evidence-based and relevant to 
the use of ADT in combination with EBRT in PCa for the most common clinical 
settings.

Between February 2020 and May 2022, one million Americans have died of COVID-19. 
To determine the contribution of those deaths to all-cause mortality in terms of 
life expectancy reductions and the resulting economic welfare losses, we 
calculated their combined impact on national income growth and the added value 
of lives lost. We estimated that US life expectancy at birth dropped by 
3.08 years due to the million COVID-19 deaths. Economic welfare losses estimated 
in terms of national income growth supplemented by the value of lives lost, was 
in the order of US$3.57 trillion. US$2.20 trillion of these losses were in in 
the non-Hispanic White population (56.50%), US$698.24 billion (19.54%) in the 
Hispanic population, and US$579.93 billion (16.23%) in the non-Hispanic Black 
population. The scale of life expectancy and welfare losses underscores the 
pressing need to invest in health in the US to prevent further economic shocks 
from future pandemic threats.

PURPOSE: It is unknown to what extent overall survival (OS) of organ-confined 
(T2N0M0) urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder (UCUB) patients differs 
from age- and sex-matched population-based controls, especially when treatment 
modalities such as radical cystectomy (RC), trimodal therapy (TMT), or 
radiotherapy (RT) are considered.
METHODS: Relying on the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database 
(2004-2018), we identified newly diagnosed (2004-2013) T2N0M0 UCUB patients 
treated with either RC, TMT or RT. For each case, we simulated an age- and 
sex-matched control (Monte Carlo simulation), relying on Social Security 
Administration Life Tables with 5 years of follow-up, and compared OS with that 
of RC-, TMT-, and RT-treated cases. Additionally, we relied on smoothed 
cumulative incidence plots to display cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and 
other-cause mortality (OCM) rates for each treatment modality.
RESULTS: Of 7153 T2N0M0 UCUB patients, 4336 (61%) underwent RC, 1810 (25%) TMT, 
and 1007 (14%) RT. At 5 years, OS rate in RC cases was 65% vs. 86% in 
population-based controls (Δ = 21%); in TMT cases, 32% vs. 74% in 
population-based controls (Δ = 42%); and in RT, 13% vs. 60% in population-based 
control (Δ = 47%). Five-year CSM rates were highest in RT (57%), followed by TMT 
(46%) and RC (24%). Five-year OCM rates were the highest in RT (30%), followed 
by TMT (22%) and RC (12%).
CONCLUSION: OS of T2N0M0 UCUB patients is substantially less than that of age- 
and sex-matched population-based controls. The biggest difference affects RT, 
followed by TMT. A modest difference was recorded in RC and population-based 
controls.

BACKGROUND: Appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency 
worldwide, and its burden has been changing. We report the level and trends of 
appendicitis prevalence, and incidence; and years lived with disability (YLD) in 
204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019, based on data from the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019.
METHODS: The numbers and age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and YLD rates 
per 100,000 population of appendicitis were estimated across regions and 
countries by age, sex, and sociodemographic index (SDI). All the estimates were 
reported with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).
RESULTS: Globally, the age-standardized prevalence and incidence rates of 
appendicitis in 2019 were 8.7 (95% UI 6.9 to 11.0) and 229.9 (95% UI 180.9 to 
291.0) per 100,000 population, with increases of 20.8% (95% UI 18.9 to 23.0%) 
and 20.5% (95% UI 18.7 to 22.8%) from 1990 to 2019, respectively. Additionally, 
the age-standardized YLDs rate was 2.7 (95% UI 1.8 to 3.9) in 2019, with an 
increase of 20.4% (95% UI 16.2 to 25.1%) from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, the 
age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and YLD rates peaked in the 
15-to-19-year age groups in both male and female individuals. However, no 
statistically significant differences were observed between the male and female 
individuals in all groups. Ethiopia, India, and Nigeria showed the largest 
increases in the age-standardized prevalence rate between 1990 and 2019. 
Generally, positive associations were found between the age-standardized YLD 
rates and SDI at the regional and national levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Appendicitis remains a major public health challenge globally. 
Increasing awareness of appendicitis and its risk factors and the importance of 
early diagnosis and treatment is warranted to reduce its the burden.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA) with the aid of Navio Robot, comparing it with standard 
prosthetic surgery on the functional outcomes of patients after an intensive 
rehabilitation program.
METHOD: A case-control observational study was conducted on patients undergoing 
TKA for severe KOA. All patients underwent the same intensive hospital 
rehabilitation program of 14 daily sessions lasting 3 h. The following rating 
scales were administered: Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Knee Society Score (KSS) 
and 12-Item Short Form Survey scale. Patient assessments were performed 1 week 
post-surgery (T0), 1 month post-surgery (T2), and 3 months post-surgery (T3). 
The primary outcomes were active knee extension and flexion and pain severity. 
The secondary outcomes were functional capacity and quality of life.
RESULTS: Using repeated measures ANOVA, we observed at T1 a statistically 
different difference for the treatment group compared to the control group about 
KSS (p < 0.05), pain (p < 0.05), and knee flexion (p < 0.05). No statistically 
significant difference between the two groups was observed for knee extension 
(p = 0.09) and the SF-12 scale (p = 0.52). At T2 instead, we observed a 
statistically significant difference for the treatment group compared to the 
control group as regards KSS (p < 0.05) and knee flexion (p < 0.05), while no 
statistically significant difference was observed for pain (p = 0.83), knee 
extension (p = 0.60), and the SF-12 scale (0.44).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study has demonstrated that robot-NAVIO assisted knee 
prosthesis surgery, associated with a specific intensive rehabilitation 
treatment, in the short and medium term, determines good pain control, better 
flexion recovery and a improvement of functional capacity.

We conducted a critical review, using systematic methods, of the literature 
examining mental health consumer perspectives on their physical and mental 
health in academic research published between 2005 and 2021. This review 
examined the inclusion, extent, type and centrality of consumer perspectives 
regarding their mental and physical health. The search produced 1,865 papers 
from which 116 met the inclusion criteria. Studies predominantly focused on 
consumers' individual experiences of their physical and mental health, including 
but not limited to their understandings and experiences of medication and 
associated risk factors. They also captured some social aspects of mental health 
consumers' physical health, including factors that impacted individual agency, 
stigma, and social and interpersonal factors. Structural factors affecting 
physical and mental health, such as accessibility of services and financial 
constraints, were also identified. The review revealed that in comparison to 
clinician perspectives, the direct representation of consumer perspectives was 
lacking. Similarly, while clinician and carer perspectives on structural factors 
were investigated, the consumer perspective in this area was missing. The review 
also found few genuine codesigned or coproduced research studies. To better 
identify and respond to the health needs as prioritized by consumers, this paper 
argues it is imperative that future studies prioritize codesigned and coproduced 
research. It is argued that a focus on "services as provided" rather than 
"services as received" has contributed to a lack of progress in addressing the 
life expectancy gap for consumers. It is recommended that journals, ethics 
committees and research policy organizations develop guidelines and standards to 
inform best practice in research on consumer perspectives and experience and to 
support the implementation of codesigned and/or coproduced approaches in future 
research. Respecting and including consumers as equal partners in the research 
process will lead to more meaningful insights to inform policy and practice and 
reduce the life expectancy gap for people living with mental health concerns.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a multicomponent strategy versus 
usual care in people with type 2 diabetes in South Asia.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation from healthcare system and societal perspectives.
SETTING: Ten diverse urban clinics in India and Pakistan.
PARTICIPANTS: 1146 people with type 2 diabetes (575 in the intervention group 
and 571 in the usual care group) with mean age of 54.2 years, median diabetes 
duration: 7 years and mean HbA1c: 9.9% (85 mmol/mol) at baseline.
INTERVENTION: Multicomponent strategy comprising decision-supported electronic 
health records and non-physician care coordinator. Control group received usual 
care.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per unit 
achievement in multiple risk factor control (HbA1c <7% (53 mmol/mol) and SBP 
<130/80 mmHg or LDLc <2.58 mmol/L (100 mg/dL)), ICERs per unit reduction in 
HbA1c, 5-mmHg unit reductions in systolic BP, 10-unit reductions in LDLc (mg/dl) 
(considered as clinically relevant) and ICER per quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) gained. ICERs were reported in 2020 purchasing power parity-adjusted 
international dollars (INT$). The probability of ICERs being cost-effective was 
considered depending on the willingness to pay (WTP) values as a share of GDP 
per capita for India (Int$ 7041.4) and Pakistan (Int$ 4847.6).
RESULTS: Compared to usual care, the annual incremental costs per person for 
intervention group were Int$ 1061.9 from a health system perspective and Int$ 
1093.6 from a societal perspective. The ICER was Int$ 10,874.6 per increase in 
multiple risk factor control, $2588.1 per one percentage point reduction in the 
HbA1c, and $1744.6 per 5 unit reduction in SBP (mmHg), and $1271 per 10 unit 
reduction in LDLc (mg/dl). The ICER per QALY gained was $33,399.6 from a 
societal perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: In a trial setting in South Asia, a multicomponent strategy for 
diabetes care resulted in better multiple risk factor control at higher costs 
and may be cost-effective depending on the willingness to pay threshold with 
substantial uncertainty around cost-effectiveness for QALYs gained in the short 
term (2.5 years). Future research needs to confirm the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of intensive multifactorial intervention for diabetes care in 
diverse healthcare settings in LMICs.
