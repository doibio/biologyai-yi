life expectancy of less than 10 and less than 20 years, respectively.
RESULTS: Consultation with a medical oncologist was associated with increased 
rates of active surveillance (37% v 21%, P = .01), an association that remained 
significant on multivariable logistic regression (odds ratio [OR] = 2.70; 95% 
CI, 1.27 to 5.75; P = .01). When applied to patients with limited life 
expectancy, this finding remained significant (OR = 4.74; 95% CI, 1.17 to 19.25; 
P = .03).
CONCLUSION: Consultation with a medical oncologist is associated with increased 
rates of active surveillance, adherence to NCCN guidelines, and minimization of 
overtreatment in men with early prostate cancer and limited life expectancy.

Proximal spinal muscular atrophy: current orthopedic perspective.

Erlangen-Nürnberg, Erlangen, Germany.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a hereditary neuromuscular disease of lower 
motor neurons that is caused by a defective "survival motor neuron" (SMN) 
protein that is mainly associated with proximal progressive muscle weakness and 
atrophy. Although SMA involves a wide range of disease severity and a high 
mortality and morbidity rate, recent advances in multidisciplinary supportive 
care have enhanced quality of life and life expectancy. Active research for 
possible treatment options has become possible since the disease-causing gene 
defect was identified in 1995. Nevertheless, a causal therapy is not available 
at present, and therapeutic management of SMA remains challenging; the prolonged 
survival is increasing, especially orthopedic, respiratory and nutritive 
problems. This review focuses on orthopedic management of the disease, with 
discussion of key aspects that include scoliosis, muscular contractures, hip 
joint disorders, fractures, technical devices, and a comparative approach of 
conservative and surgical treatment. Also emphasized are associated 
complications including respiratory involvement, perioperative care and 
anesthesia, nutrition problems, and rehabilitation. The SMA disease course can 
be greatly improved with adequate therapy with established orthopedic procedures 
in a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach.

A number of theoretical perspectives suggest that expectancy violations (EVs) 
threaten a person's sense of meaning and prompt efforts to reinstate meaning. 
Yet, little to no research has explicitly examined whether EVs predict actual 
efforts to search for meaning. The current research redresses this gap in the 
literature among a sample of breast cancer survivors. The results revealed that 
EVs, but not life satisfaction, positively predicted the search for meaning. By 
comparison, the presence of meaning was predicted by both EVs and life 
satisfaction. Further, EVs predicted an increased search for meaning among 
participants who simultaneously believed that their life had high levels of 
meaning. Thus, personal EVs may offer a compelling framework for understanding 
what prompts searches for meaning.

Caloric restriction (CR) and chemical agents, such as resveratrol and rapamycin 
that partially mimic the CR effect, can delay morbidity and mortality across a 
broad range of species. In humans, however, the effects of CR or other 
life-extending agents have not yet been investigated systematically. Human 
maximal lifespan is already substantially greater compared to that of closely 
related primate species. It is therefore possible that humans have acquired 
genetic mutations that mimic the CR effect. Here, we tested this notion by 
comparing transcriptome differences between humans and other primates, with the 
transcriptome changes observed in mice subjected to CR. We show that the human 
transcriptome state, relative to other primate transcriptomes, does not match 
that of the CR mice or mice treated with resveratrol, but resembles the 
transcriptome state of ad libitum fed mice. At the same time, the transcriptome 
changes induced by CR in mice are enriched among genes showing age-related 
changes in primates, concentrated in specific expression patterns, and can be 
linked with specific functional pathways, including insulin signalling, cancer, 
and the immune response. These findings indicate that the evolution of human 
longevity was likely independent of CR-induced lifespan extension mechanisms. 
Consequently, application of CR or CR-mimicking agents may yet offer a promising 
direction for the extension of healthy human lifespan.

BACKGROUND: Patient understanding of advanced metastatic disease is central to 
decisions about care near death. Prior studies have focused on gender 
differences in communication style rather than on illness understanding.
OBJECTIVES: : To evaluate gender differences in terminal illness acknowledgement 
(TIA), understanding that the disease is incurable and the advanced stage of the 
disease. To evaluate gender differences in patients' reports of discussions of 
life expectancy with oncology providers and its effect on differences in illness 
understanding.
METHODS: Coping with Cancer 2 patients (N = 68) were interviewed before and 
after a visit with their oncology providers to discuss scan results.
RESULTS: At the prescan interview, there were no statistically significant 
gender differences in patient measures of illness understanding. At the postscan 
interview, women were more likely than men to recognize that their illness was 
incurable (Adjusted Odds Ratio, [AOR] = 5.29; P = .038), know that their cancer 
was at an advanced stage (AOR = 6.38; P = .013), and report having had 
discussions of life expectancy with their oncologist (AOR = 4.77; P = .021). 
Controlling discussions of life expectancy, women were more likely than men to 
report that their cancer was at an advanced stage (AOR = 9.53; P = .050). 
Controlling for gender, discussions of life expectancy were associated with 
higher rates of TIA (AOR = 4.65; P = .036) and higher rates of understanding 
that the cancer was incurable (AOR = 4.09; P = .085).
CONCLUSIONS: Due largely to gender differences in communication, women over time 
have a better understanding of their illness than men. More frequent discussions 
of life expectancy should enhance illness understanding and reduce gender 
differences.

Despite extensive research into the diagnosis and management of cystic fibrosis 
(CF) over the past decades, sufferers still have a median life expectancy of 
less than 37 years. Respiratory tract infections have a significant role in 
increasing the morbidity and mortality of patients with CF via a progressive 
decline in lung function. Rapid identification of organisms recovered from CF 
sputum is necessary for effective management of respiratory tract infections; 
however, standard techniques of identification are slow, technically demanding 
and expensive. The aim of this study is to asses the suitability of 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry 
(MALDI-TOF MS) in identifying bacteria isolated from the respiratory tract of 
patients with CF, and is assessed by testing the accuracy of MALDI-TOF MS in 
identifying samples from a reference collection of rare CF strains in 
conjunction with comparing MALDI-TOF MS and standard techniques in identifying 
clinical isolates from sputum samples of CF patients. MALDI-TOF MS accurately 
identified 100% of isolates from the reference collection of rare CF pathogens 
(EuroCare CF collection). The isolate identification given by MALDI-TOF MS 
agreed with that given by standard techniques for 479/481 (99.6%) clinical 
isolates obtained from respiratory samples provided by patients with CE In two 
(0.4%) of 481 samples there was a discrepancy in identification between 
MALDI-TOF MS and standard techniques. One organism was identified as Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa by MALDI-TOF but could only be identified by the laboratory's 
standard methods as of the Pseudomonas genus. The second organism was identified 
as P. beteli by MALDI-TOF MS and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia by standard 
methods. This study shows that MALDI-TOF MS is superior to standard techniques 
in providing cheap, rapid and accurate identification of CF sputum isolates.

Cost-effectiveness of rituximab as maintenance treatment for relapsed follicular 
lymphoma: results of a population-based study.

Assessment, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

OBJECTIVES: On the basis of two population-based registries, our study aims to 
calculate the real-world cost-effectiveness of rituximab maintenance compared 
with observation in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma patients who 
responded to second-line chemotherapy.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the EORTC20981 trial, the Netherlands Cancer 
Registry and two population-based registries. A Markov model was developed to 
calculate cost per life year gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) for three scenarios.
RESULTS: Our real-world patients were (62 years) 6 to 7 years older and had 
higher complete response rates to second-line chemotherapy than the trial 
population. Differences between the real-world rituximab and observation group 
were observed for second-line chemotherapy and disease progression. Groups were 
more balanced after using propensity matching. Relying entirely on updated trial 
results (scenario1) in combination with local cost data resulted in ratios of 
€11,259 per LYG and €12,655 per QALY. For scenario2, consisting of trial 
efficacy and matched real-world costs, ratios of €21,202 per LYG and €23,821 per 
QALY were calculated. Using real-world matched evidence (scenario3) for both 
effectiveness and costs showed ratios of €10,591 per LYG and €11,245 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: Although differences in real-world and trial population were found, 
using real-world data as well as results from long-term trial follow-up showed 
favourable ICERs for rituximab maintenance. Nevertheless, results showed that 
caution is required with data synthesis, interpretation and generalisability of 
results. As different scenarios provide answers to different questions, we 
recommend healthcare decision-makers to recognise the importance of calculating 
several cost-effectiveness scenarios.

Eligibility for the kidney transplant wait list: a model for conceptualizing 
patient risk.

5082 Dickson Building, Queen Elizabeth II HSC-VG site, 5280 University Avenue,

BACKGROUND: Determining eligibility for a kidney transplant is one of the most 
important decisions facing nephrologists. It is assumed that the harm of kidney 
transplantation is minimal and most will benefit. The purpose of this study was 
to quantify the probability of 'no benefit' as defined by death on the wait 
list; 'harm', defined by the probability that a transplanted patient would live 
less than the average wait listed patient; and 'benefit' for the probability a 
transplanted patient would outlive the average wait listed patient.
METHODS: A computerized model was developed to replicate observed patient 
survival outcomes in deceased donor kidney transplantation. Three sequential 
periods of risk for the transplanted recipient compared to the wait listed 
cohort (increased, equivalent and reduced risk) were modeled.
RESULTS: The model predicted that wait listed patients with a baseline mortality 
of 28 deaths per 100 patient years were equally likely to benefit or be harmed 
with a transplant. However if 20% of patients on the wait list were on hold 
(assuming a 2.2-fold higher mortality than those who were transplanted), then 
the baseline mortality rate for equal harm or benefit decreases to 22 deaths per 
100 patient years (equivalent life expectancy 4.5 years).
CONCLUSION: Patients with limited life expectancies are more likely to suffer 
some harm than derive benefit from kidney transplantation.

Uneven futures of human lifespans: reckonings from Gompertz mortality rates, 
climate change, and air pollution.

Finch CE(1), Beltrán-Sánchez H, Crimmins EM.

(1)Davis School of Gerontology and Dornsife College, University of Southern 
California, Los Angeles, Calif., USA.

The past 200 years have enabled remarkable increases in human lifespans through 
improvements in the living environment that have nearly eliminated infections as 
a cause of death through improved hygiene, public health, medicine, and 
nutrition. We argue that the limit to lifespan may be approaching. Since 1997, 
no one has exceeded Jeanne Calment's record of 122.5 years, despite an 
exponential increase of centenarians. Moreover, the background mortality may be 
approaching a lower limit. We calculate from Gompertz coefficients that further 
increases in longevity to approach a life expectancy of 100 years in 21st 
century cohorts would require 50% slower mortality rate accelerations, which 
would be a fundamental change in the rate of human aging. Looking into the 21st 
century, we see further challenges to health and longevity from the continued 
burning of fossil fuels that contribute to air pollution as well as global 
warming. Besides increased heat waves to which elderly are vulnerable, global 
warming is anticipated to increase ozone levels and facilitate the spread of 
pathogens. We anticipate continuing socioeconomic disparities in life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: In the Philippines, smoking is highly prevalent and tobacco control 
policies fail to fully implement the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 
provisions. To aid in policy change, intervention implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation, this study aimed to provide the first internally consistent and 
latest Philippine estimates of the following: disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) lost due to lung cancer; population-attributable fractions (PAFs) of 
smoking; and smoking-attributable lung cancer DALYs.
METHODS: This study applied the Global Burden of Disease and Comparative Risk 
Assessment frameworks to secondary data, supplemented by expert opinion. A 
comprehensive internally consistent assessment of disease epidemiology was 
conducted using DISMOD II and disease impact was quantified as DALYs. PAFs were 
calculated using the smoking impact ratio and Monte Carlo uncertainty analyses 
were conducted.
RESULTS: For 2008, lung cancer incidence and mortality estimates were 10 871 
cases and 9871 deaths respectively. Lung cancer accounted for an estimated 
267 787 DALYs lost, 99% of which were due to years of life lost. Overall, the 
PAF of smoking was 65% and a total of 173 103 DALYs were smoking-attributable. 
There were increasing trends in incidence, mortality and DALY rates with age. 
The majority of incidence (72%), mortality (71%) and disease burden (72%) 
occurred among men, who also had higher PAF estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: Considerable health gains could be achieved if smoking exposure 
were reduced in the Philippines. Strong enforcement of measures like increasing 
taxation to the WHO-endorsed rate, expanding smoke-free environments, and 
requiring large graphic warnings within a comprehensive tobacco control 
programme is recommended.

[Enzyme replacement therapy in patients with Fabry disease: state of the art and 
review of the literature].

[Article in Italian]

Riccio E, Capuano I, Visciano B, Marchetiello C, Petrillo F, Pisani A.

Anderson-Fabry disease is a hereditary X-linked lysosomal storage disorder 
caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha galactosidase A. It results 
in the accumulation of the glycosphingolypid globotrioasoyl ceramide (Gb3 in 
different cells and organs, resulting in a multi-system pathology including end 
organ failure. Patients with Fabry disease present clinically with cardiac, 
renal and neurological involvement; both life expectancy and quality of life are 
severely compromised. The current causal treatment for Fabry disease is enzyme 
replacement therapy (ERT), available since 2001. The two recombinant 
preparations available for ERT are agalsidase alfa (Replagal) and agalsidase 
beta (Fabrazyme). They have both been showed to have positive effect on kidney 
and heart, on the symptoms of pain and quality of life. Few data to date are 
available on comparison of the two preparations of ERT. This article reviews 
evidence of the literature and shows our personal experience about the safety 
and efficacy of ERT.

In plant genetic engineering, the identification of gene promoters leading to 
particular expression patterns is crucial for the development of new genetically 
modified plant generations. This research was conducted in order to isolate and 
characterize several new promoters from cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) 
elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1A) gene family.Three promoters MeEF1A3, MeEF1A5 
and MeEF1A6 were successfully isolated [corrected]. Sequence analyses showed 
that all of the promoters contain three conserved putative cis-acting elements 
which are located upstream of the transcription start site. These elements are 
included a TEF1, a TELO and TATA boxes. In addition, all of the promoters also 
have the 5'UTR intron but with a different lengths. These promoters were 
constructed translationally with gusA reporter gene (promoter::gusA fusion) in 
pBI-121 binary vector to build a new binary vector using Overlap Extension PCR 
Cloning (OEPC) technique. Transient expression assay that was done by using 
agroinfiltration method was used to show functionality of these promoters. 
Qualitative and quantitative analysis from GUS assay showed that these promoters 
were functional and conferred a specific activity in tobacco seedlings 
(Nicotiana tabacum), tomato fruits (Solanum lycopersicum) and banana fruits 
(Musa acuminata). We hypothesized that MeEF1A6 could be categorized as a 
constitutive promoter because it was able to drive the gene expression in all 
transformed tissue described in here and also comparable to CaMV35S. On the 
other hand, MeEF1A3 drove specific expression in the aerial parts of seedlings 
such as hypocotyl and cotyledon thus MeEF1A5 drove specific expression in fruit 
tissue. The results obtained from transient analysis showed that these promoters 
had a distinct activity although they came from same gene family. The DNA 
sequences identified here are new promoters potentially use for genetic 
engineering in cassava or other plants.

If the face is familiar, the patient may be overusing healthcare.

[No authors listed]

Patients who use the healthcare system excessively, and often for avoidable 
issues, create a burden for hospitals and consume a significant portion of 
healthcare expenditures. Many frequent users have complex medical and 
psychosocial needs, are uninsured, or have behavioral health issues. Case 
managers should identify patients who are potential frequent utilizers and make 
sure they are connected with a primary care provider. Take the time to find out 
barriers to care and call in a social worker to help line up community 
resources.

Income inequality and population health: an analysis of panel data for 21 
developed countries, 1975-2006.

Torre R(1), Myrskylä M.

Author information:
(1)a Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research.

The relative income-health hypothesis postulates that income distribution is an 
important determinant of population health, but the age and sex patterns of this 
association are not well known. We tested the relative income-health hypothesis 
using panel data collected for 21 developed countries over 30 years. Net of 
trends in gross domestic product per head and unobserved period and country 
factors, income inequality measured by the Gini index is positively associated 
with the mortality of males and females at ages 1-14 and 15-49, and with the 
mortality of females at ages 65-89 albeit less strongly than for the younger age 
groups. These findings suggest that policies to decrease income inequality may 
improve health, especially that of children and young-to-middle-aged men and 
women. The mechanisms behind the income inequality-mortality association remain 
unknown and should be the focus of future research.

PURPOSE: We sought to determine the most cost-effective treatment for patients 
with newly diagnosed neovascular macular degeneration: monthly or as-needed 
bevacizumab injections, or monthly or as-needed ranibizumab injections.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of 80-year-old patients with newly diagnosed 
neovascular macular degeneration.
METHODS: Using a mathematical model with a 20-year time horizon, we compared the 
incremental cost-effectiveness of treating a hypothetical cohort of 80-year-old 
patients with newly diagnosed neovascular macular degeneration using monthly 
bevacizumab, as-needed bevacizumab, monthly ranibizumab, or as-needed 
ranibizumab. Data came from the Comparison of Age-related macular degeneration 
Treatment Trial (CATT), the Medicare Fee Schedule, and the medical literature.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and 
incremental costs per QALY gained.
RESULTS: Compared with as-needed bevacizumab, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of monthly bevacizumab is $24,2 357/QALY. Monthly ranibizumab gains an 
additional 0.02 QALYs versus monthly bevacizumab at an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of >$10 million/QALY. As-needed ranibizumab was 
dominated by monthly bevacizumab, meaning it was more costly and less effective. 
In sensitivity analyses assuming a willingness to pay of $100,000/QALY, the 
annual risk of serious vascular events would have to be ≥2.5 times higher with 
bevacizumab than that observed in the CATT trial for as-needed ranibizumab to 
have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of <$100,000/QALY. In another 
sensitivity analysis, even if every patient receiving bevacizumab experienced 
declining vision by 1 category (e.g., from 20/25-20/40 to 20/50-20/80) after 2 
years but every patient receiving ranibizumab retained their vision level, 
as-needed ranibizumab would have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$97,340/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Even after considering the potential for differences in risks of 
serious adverse events and therapeutic effectiveness, bevacizumab confers 
considerably greater value than ranibizumab for the treatment of neovascular 
macular degeneration.

BACKGROUND: The role of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in incurable cachectic 
cancer patients unable to eat is extremely controversial. The aim of this study 
is to analyse which factors can influence the outcome.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied prospectively 414 incurable cachectic 
(sub)obstructed cancer patients receiving HPN and analysed the association 
between patient or clinical characteristics and surviving status.
RESULTS: Median weight loss, versus pre-disease and last 6-month period, was 24% 
and 16%, respectively. Median body mass index was 19.5, median KPS was 60, 
median life expectancy was 3 months. Mean/median survival was 4.7/3.0 months; 
50.0% and 22.9% of patients survived 3 and 6 months, respectively. At the 
multivariable analysis, the variables significantly associated with 3- and 
6-month survival were Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) and KPS, and GPS, KPS and 
tumour spread, respectively. By the aggregation of the significant variables, it 
was possible to dissect several classes of patients with different survival 
probabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of cachectic incurable cancer patients on HPN is not 
homogeneous. It is possible to identify groups of patients with a ≥6-month 
survival (possibly longer than that allowed in starvation). The indications for 
HPN can be modulated on these clinical/biochemical indices.

Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Due to 
advances in medicine in the past few decades, life expectancy has increased 
resulting in an aging population in developed and developing countries. Acute 
coronary syndrome causes greater morbidity and mortality in this group of older 
patients, which appears to be due to age-related comorbidities. This review 
examines the incidence and prevalence of acute coronary syndrome among older 
patients, examines current treatment strategies, and evaluates the predictors of 
adverse outcomes. In particular, the impact of frailty on outcomes and the need 
for frailty assessment in developing future research and management strategies 
among older patients are discussed.

Long life expectancy and wide development of therapies have increased the number 
of patients under artificial treatment for lost kidney function or dialysis. 
Different options for vascular access are suitable for receiving this therapy. 
The use of tunneled catheters has consequently increased complications related 
to its use. A difficult retrieval of catheters caused by a hard fibrin sheath 
along its trajectory is a common drawback. Herein, we report a woman with 
suspicion of hemodialysis catheter infection and an irretrievable Tesio 
catheter. A novel technique using a Fogarty arterial catheter allowed a 
successful retrieval and avoided an aggressive management.

PURPOSE: Bone stock reconstruction in TKR surgery is one of the biggest 
challenges for the surgeon. According to some, authors causes of bone stock 
loosening are multiple, including stress shielding, osteolysis from wear, septic 
or aseptic loosening, and bone loss caused by a poorly balanced implant. 
Moreover, bone loss may be iatrogenic at the time of implant removal, indicating 
that bone preservation during implant removal is critical.
METHODS: Defect localization and extension affect the surgeon's decisions about 
the choice of the surgical technique and the type of plant to be taken. Today 
there are several options available for bone deficiency treatment. The treatment 
choice is undoubtedly linked to the cause of revision, experience and personal 
philosophy, but it is necessary to consider also the patient's age, expectations 
of life, functional requirements and bone quality. Many authors prefer bone 
stock reconstruction techniques in patients with high bone quality and a better 
quality of life with more prospects. In patients with lower lease on life and 
lower bone quality the best bone replacement techniques are of modular systems, 
wedges, and augments. In cases with septic bone loss, more or less extended, 
different authors recommend reducing bone grafts in favor of modular prostheses 
to reduce the risk of graft contamination.
RESULTS: All of these techniques have been shown to be durable in midterm 
outcomes, but concerns exist for a number of reasons, including disease 
transmission, resorption, fracture, immune reaction to allograft, the cost of 
custom prostheses, the inability to modify the construct intraoperatively and 
the overall technical challenge of applying these techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: The choice between different surgical options depends on bone 
defect dimension and characteristics but are also patient-related. 
Reestablishment of well-aligned and stable implants is necessary for successful 
reconstruction, but this can't be accomplished without a sufficient restoration 
of an eventual bone loss.

BACKGROUND: Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is rising in middle income countries. 
Population based strategies to reduce specific CHD risk factors have an 
important role to play in reducing overall CHD mortality. Reducing dietary salt 
consumption is a potentially cost-effective way to reduce CHD events. This paper 
presents an economic evaluation of population based salt reduction policies in 
Tunisia, Syria, Palestine and Turkey.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Three policies to reduce dietary salt intake were 
evaluated: a health promotion campaign, labelling of food packaging and 
mandatory reformulation of salt content in processed food. These were evaluated 
separately and in combination. Estimates of the effectiveness of salt reduction 
on blood pressure were based on a literature review. The reduction in mortality 
was estimated using the IMPACT CHD model specific to that country. Cumulative 
population health effects were quantified as life years gained (LYG) over a 10 
year time frame. The costs of each policy were estimated using evidence from 
comparable policies and expert opinion including public sector costs and costs 
to the food industry. Health care costs associated with CHDs were estimated 
using standardized unit costs. The total cost of implementing each policy was 
compared against the current baseline (no policy). All costs were calculated 
using 2010 PPP exchange rates. In all four countries most policies were cost 
saving compared with the baseline. The combination of all three policies 
(reducing salt consumption by 30%) resulted in estimated cost savings of 
$235,000,000 and 6455 LYG in Tunisia; $39,000,000 and 31674 LYG in Syria; 
$6,000,000 and 2682 LYG in Palestine and $1,3000,000,000 and 378439 LYG in 
Turkey.
CONCLUSION: Decreasing dietary salt intake will reduce coronary heart disease 
deaths in the four countries. A comprehensive strategy of health education and 
food industry actions to label and reduce salt content would save both money and 
lives.

Threose nucleic acid (TNA) is a potential alternative genetic material that may 
have played a role in the early evolution of life. We have developed a novel 
synthesis of 2'-amino modified TNA nucleosides (2'-NH2-TNA) based on a 
cycloaddition reaction between a glycal and an azodicarboxylate, followed by 
direct nucleosidation of the cycloadduct. Using this route, we synthesized the 
thymine and guanine 2'-NH2-TNA nucleosides in seven steps with 24% and 12% 
overall yield, respectively. We then phosphorylated the guanine nucleoside on 
the 3'-hydroxyl, activated the phosphate as the 2-methylimidazolide, and tested 
the ability of the activated nucleotide to copy C4 RNA, DNA, and TNA templates 
by nonenzymatic primer extension. We measured pseudo-first-order rate constants 
for the first nucleotide addition step of 1.5, 0.97, and 0.57 h(-1) on RNA, DNA, 
and TNA templates, respectively, at pH 7.5 and 4 °C with 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM 
N-(hydroxylethyl)imidazole catalyst, and 5 mM activated nucleotide. The 
activated nucleotide hydrolyzed with a rate constant of 0.39 h(-1), causing the 
polymerization reaction to stall before complete template copying could be 
achieved. These extension rates are more than 1 order of magnitude slower than 
those for amino-sugar ribonucleotides under the same conditions, and copying of 
the TNA template, which best represented a true self-copying reaction, was the 
slowest of all. The poor kinetics of 2'-NH2-TNA template copying could give 
insight into why TNA was ultimately not used as a genetic material by biological 
systems.

BACKGROUND: Palliative sedation is a medical intervention aimed at relieving 
symptoms that can no longer be controlled by conventional treatment. Ample 
knowledge is available regarding the nature of such symptoms, but there is no 
in-depth information regarding how health care workers decide about palliative 
sedation.
OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to investigate considerations concerning the 
indications for continuous palliative sedation (CPS) and issues that influence 
these considerations.
DESIGN: The study consisted of qualitative interviews regarding patients who had 
recently received CPS.
SETTING/SUBJECTS: The study involved physicians and nurses working in general 
practice, nursing homes, and hospitals.
MEASUREMENT: Analyses by a multidisciplinary research team used the constant 
comparative method.
RESULTS: Together with physical symptoms, psychological and existential 
suffering may combine to produce a refractory state for which other treatment 
options than CPS were not available or considered inappropriate. A limited life 
expectancy was by many considered crucial (e.g., to avoid hastening death) and 
by some less important (e.g., because the patient's suffering was considered to 
be key). Issues influencing the decision to use CPS related to patient 
preferences (e.g., dignity, not wanting to experience further suffering) or 
family issues (impact of suffering on family, family requesting CPS).
CONCLUSIONS: The indication for CPS typically originates from physical symptoms 
and nonphysical problems producing a refractory state in which a patient suffers 
unbearably. In such states, preferences of patients and families and the life 
expectancy criterion are weighed against the severity of refractory symptoms. 
Therefore the use of CPS is not only a response to the physical suffering of 
patients in the dying phase.

BACKGROUND: Partner notification is essential to the comprehensive case 
management of sexually transmitted infections. Systematic reviews and 
mathematical modelling can be used to synthesise information about the effects 
of new interventions to enhance the outcomes of partner notification.
OBJECTIVE: To study the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of traditional and 
new partner notification technologies for curable sexually transmitted 
infections (STIs).
DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of clinical audit data; systematic reviews of 
randomised controlled trials (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials) published from 1 January 1966 to 31 August 2012 and of 
studies of health-related quality of life (HRQL) [MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of 
Knowledge, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Database of Abstracts of 
Reviews of Effects (DARE) and Health Technology Assessment (HTA)] published from 
1 January 1980 to 31 December 2011; static models of clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness; and dynamic modelling studies to improve parameter 
estimation and examine effectiveness.
SETTING: General population and genitourinary medicine clinic attenders.
PARTICIPANTS: Heterosexual women and men.
INTERVENTIONS: Traditional partner notification by patient or provider referral, 
and new partner notification by expedited partner therapy (EPT) or its UK 
equivalent, accelerated partner therapy (APT).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Population prevalence; index case reinfection; and 
partners treated per index case.
RESULTS: Enhanced partner therapy reduced reinfection in index cases with 
curable STIs more than simple patient referral [risk ratio (RR) 0.71; 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.89]. There are no randomised trials of APT. 
The median number of partners treated for chlamydia per index case in UK clinics 
was 0.60. The number of partners needed to treat to interrupt transmission of 
chlamydia was lower for casual than for regular partners. In dynamic model 
simulations, >10% of partners are chlamydia positive with look-back periods of 
up to 18 months. In the presence of a chlamydia screening programme that reduces 
population prevalence, treatment of current partners achieves most of the 
additional reduction in prevalence attributable to partner notification. Dynamic 
model simulations show that cotesting and treatment for chlamydia and gonorrhoea 
reduce the prevalence of both STIs. APT has a limited additional effect on 
prevalence but reduces the rate of index case reinfection. Published 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) weights were of insufficient quality to be 
used in a cost-effectiveness study of partner notification in this project. 
Using an intermediate outcome of cost per infection diagnosed, doubling the 
efficacy of partner notification from 0.4 to 0.8 partners treated per index case 
was more cost-effective than increasing chlamydia screening coverage.
CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to support the improved clinical effectiveness of 
EPT in reducing index case reinfection. In a general heterosexual population, 
partner notification identifies new infected cases but the impact on chlamydia 
prevalence is limited. Partner notification to notify casual partners might have 
a greater impact than for regular partners in genitourinary clinic populations. 
Recommendations for future research are (1) to conduct randomised controlled 
trials using biological outcomes of the effectiveness of APT and of methods to 
increase testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and STIs after APT; (2) 
collection of HRQL data should be a priority to determine QALYs associated with 
the sequelae of curable STIs; and (3) standardised parameter sets for curable 
STIs should be developed for mathematical models of STI transmission that are 
used for policy-making.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate costs and treatment benefits of rhegmatogenous retinal 
detachment (RD) repair.
DESIGN: A Markov model of cost-effectiveness and utility.
PARTICIPANTS: There were no participants.
METHODS: Published clinical trials (index studies) of pneumatic retinopexy (PR), 
scleral buckling (SB), pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), and laser prophylaxis were 
used to quantitate surgical management and visual benefits. Markov analysis, 
with data from the Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services, was used to 
calculate the adjusted costs of primary repair by each modality in a 
hospital-based and ambulatory surgery center (ASC) setting.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lines of visual acuity (VA) saved, cost of therapy, 
adjusted cost of therapy, cost per line saved, cost per line-year saved, and 
cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) saved.
RESULTS: In the facility, hospital surgery setting, weighted cost for PR ranged 
from $3726 to $5901 depending on estimated success rate of primary repair. 
Weighted cost was $6770 for SB, $7940 for PPV, and $1955 for laser prophylaxis. 
The dollars per line saved ranged from $217 to $1346 depending on the procedure. 
Dollars per line-year saved ranged from $11 to $67. Dollars per QALY saved 
ranged from $362 to $2243. In the nonfacility, ASC surgery setting, weighted 
cost for PR ranged from $1961 to $3565 depending on the success rate of primary 
repair. The weighted costs for SB, PPV, and laser prophylaxis were $4873, $5793, 
and $1255, respectively. Dollars per line saved ranged from $139 to $982. The 
dollars per line-year saved ranged from $7 to $49, and the dollars per QALY 
saved ranged from $232 to $1637.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment and prevention of RD are extremely cost-effective when 
compared with other treatment of other retinal diseases regardless of treatment 
modality. Retinal detachment treatment costs did not vary widely, suggesting 
that providers can tailor patient treatments solely on the basis of optimizing 
anticipated results because there were no overriding differences in financial 
impact.
