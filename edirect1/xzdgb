oncologists and requires a multidisciplinary approach to optimize survival and 
clinical results.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report the surgical principles of the treatment of 
posterior fossa medulloblastomas in children and how to avoid technical mistakes 
especially in very young patients. We also report our experience in a series of 
64 patients operated from a medulloblastoma between 2000 and 2018 in Lyon.
RESULTS: All patients had a craniospinal MRI. Eighty-one percent of the patients 
(n=50) had strictly midline tumor while 19% (n=14) had lateralized one. Eleven 
percent (n=7) had metastasis at diagnosis on the initial MRI. Forty-one percent 
(n=29) had an emergency ETV to treat hydrocephaly and the intracranial 
hypertension. All patient underwent a direct approach and a complete removal was 
achieved in 78% (n=58) of the cases on the postoperative MRI realized within 48h 
postsurgery. Histological findings revealed classical medulloblastoma in 73% 
(n=46), desmoplastic medulloblastoma in 17% (n=11) and anaplastic/large cell 
medulloblastoma in 10% (n=7). Patients were classified as low risk in 7 cases, 
standard risk in 30 cases and high risk in 27 cases. Ninety-six percent (n=61) 
of the patient received radiotherapy. Seventy-six percent (n=48) received 
pre-irradiation or adjuvant chemotherapy. At last follow-up in December 2018, 
65% (n=41) of the patient were in complete remission, 12% (n=8) were in relapse 
and 27% (n=15) had died from their disease. The overall survival at five , ten 
and fifteen years for all the series was of 76%, 73% and 65.7% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Medulloblastomas remain a chimiosensible and radiosensible disease 
and the complete surgical removal represents a favorable prognostic factor. The 
extension of surgery has also to be weighted in consideration of the new 
biomolecular and genetic knowledge that have to be integrated by surgeons to 
improve quality of life of patients.

Appetitive traits influence food intake and weight gain throughout the 
life-course. Here, we investigated whether maternal attitudes to following 
healthy infant feeding guidelines could modify this association. Baseline data 
from 544 mother-infant formula-feeding dyads recruited to the Baby Milk Trial 
were included in this observational, cross-sectional analysis. Infant appetitive 
traits (food responsiveness and satiety responsiveness), maternal attitudes to 
following healthy infant feeding guidelines (self-efficacy, outcome-expectancy, 
intentions) and infant milk intakes were reported by mothers through 
questionnaires. Infant weight was measured using standard procedures. 
Associations between the maternal attitudes score or infant appetitive traits 
with infant milk intake and infant weight were evaluated in linear regression 
models adjusted for infant sex and age. To identify effect modification, the 
interaction term between the maternal attitudes score and infant appetitive 
trait was added to the model. Infants' mean age and weight were 2.3 months 
(SD = 0.9) and 5.5 kg (SD = 0.9), respectively. The mean daily infant milk 
intake reported by mothers was 895 ml/day (SD = 215). Higher maternal attitudes 
score was associated with lower infant milk intake (Beta = -68.4 ml/day/unit 
(95% CI: 96.6, -40.2)) and infant weight (Beta = -0.13 SD/unit (-0.25, -0.02)). 
The maternal attitudes score showed interactions with infant food responsiveness 
on infant milk intake (p = 0.049), and with infant satiety responsiveness on 
infant weight (p = 0.01). In both cases, a higher maternal attitudes score 
attenuated the associations between infant appetitive traits and those outcomes. 
This analysis provides evidence that positive maternal attitudes to following 
healthy infant feeding guidelines attenuate the effects of infant appetitive 
traits on infant milk intake and body weight.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Many cases of unresectable cancer that cause 
obstructive jaundice require treatment. Depending on the patient's condition in 
these cases, surgery may be performed to treat jaundice. The main goal of 
palliative surgery is to improve the quality of life. Therefore, palliative 
surgery for obstructive jaundice must be performed safely and quickly.
CASE PRESENTATION: This case presents a 45-year-old man with fever and back pain 
who was diagnosed with pancreatic head cancer and multiple liver metastases. 
Chemotherapy was initiated; however, during the course of treatment, the patient 
developed hemorrhage from pancreatic cancer that had invaded the duodenum caused 
hematemesis and melena. Therefore, the chemotherapy could not be continued. 
Because the patient also developed obstructive jaundice and cholangitis, a 
gastrojejunostomy and cholecyst-jejunostomy was performed. The surgery was 
successful; however, the cancer continued to progress, and patient died 31 days 
after surgery.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Biliary reconstruction can be difficult to perform safely 
and quickly due to many factors. This study shows that cholecyst-jejunostomy is 
effective for patients with end-stage cancer. In the long term, 
cholecyst-jejunostomy is not suitable for biliary reconstruction due to the 
possibility of bile congestion and cholecystitis. However, this easy and quick 
procedure is well indicated for emergency patients with a short life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: As an easy and quick procedure for emergency patients with a short 
life expectancy, jejunal anastomosis of the gallbladder is an appropriate 
palliative surgery that is indicated for jaundice treatment.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the gout burden and risk factors 
in China from 1990 to 2017.
STUDY DESIGN: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study uses various analytical 
tools and a diverse set of data sources to generate comparable estimates of 
deaths and mortality rates broken down by age, sex, cause, year, and geography.
METHODS: We used the results from the GBD Study 2017 to compare 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), prevalence, incidence, and risk factors 
of gout in China. The median of the percentage change and 95% uncertainty 
intervals were determined for the period between 1990 and 2017.
RESULTS: The age-standardized DALY rate, prevalence, and incidence increased 
6.92%, 6.88%, and 6.16%, respectively, in China from 1990 to 2017. Although the 
rates of gout both globally and in China were increasing, the range of change 
for males in China was larger than that of the global level. All risk factors 
combined accounted for 30.04% of gout DALYs in 2017. The leading risk factors 
for gout DALYs were high body mass index and impaired kidney function, and the 
proportion of high body mass index increased significantly from 10.67% to 
24.31%, whereas the proportion of impaired kidney function remained basically 
unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS: The age-standardized DALY rate, prevalence, and incidence in China 
have increased progressively since 1990. Increasing attention on body weight 
management should be prioritized for controlling the rising prevalence of gout 
in the young and middle-aged population.

BACKGROUND: Given projected shortages of critical care capacity in public 
hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, the South African government embarked on 
an initiative to purchase this capacity from private hospitals. In order to 
inform purchasing decisions, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of intensive 
care management for admitted COVID-19 patients across the public and private 
health systems in South Africa.
METHODS: Using a modelling framework and health system perspective, costs and 
health outcomes of inpatient management of severe and critical COVID-19 patients 
in (1) general ward and intensive care (GW + ICU) versus (2) general ward only 
(GW) were assessed. Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were evaluated and 
the cost per admission in public and private sectors was determined. The model 
made use of four variables: mortality rates, utilisation of inpatient days for 
each management approach, disability weights associated with severity of 
disease, and the unit cost per general ward day and per ICU day in public and 
private hospitals. Unit costs were multiplied by utilisation estimates to 
determine the cost per admission. DALYs were calculated as the sum of years of 
life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD). An incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) - representing difference in costs and health 
outcomes of the two management strategies - was compared to a cost-effectiveness 
threshold to determine the value for money of expansion in ICU services during 
COVID-19 surges.
RESULTS: A cost per admission of ZAR 75,127 was estimated for inpatient 
management of severe and critical COVID-19 patients in GW as opposed to ZAR 
103,030 in GW + ICU. DALYs were 1.48 and 1.10 in GW versus GW + ICU, 
respectively. The ratio of difference in costs and health outcomes between the 
two management strategies produced an ICER of ZAR 73,091 per DALY averted, a 
value above the cost-effectiveness threshold of ZAR 38,465.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that purchasing ICU capacity from the private 
sector during COVID-19 surges may not be a cost-effective investment. The 'real 
time', rapid, pragmatic, and transparent nature of this analysis demonstrates an 
approach for evidence generation for decision making relating to the COVID-19 
pandemic response and South Africa's wider priority setting agenda.

BACKGROUND: The lack of approved treatments for the majority of rare diseases is 
reflective of the unique challenges of orphan drug development. Novel 
methodologies, including new functionally relevant endpoints, are needed to 
render the development process more feasible and appropriate for these rare 
populations and thereby expedite the approval of promising treatments to address 
patients' high unmet medical need. Here, we describe the development of an 
innovative master protocol and primary outcome assessment to investigate the 
modified amino acid N-acetyl-L-leucine (Sponsor Code: IB1001) in three separate, 
multinational, phase II trials for three ultra-rare, autosomal-recessive, 
neurodegenerative disorders: Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), GM2 
gangliosidoses (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease; "GM2"), and ataxia 
telangiectasia (A-T).
METHODS/DESIGN: The innovative IB1001 master protocol and novel CI-CS primary 
endpoints were developed through a close collaboration between the Industry 
Sponsor, Key Opinion Leaders, representatives of the Patient Communities, and 
National Regulatory Authorities. As a result, the open-label, rater-blinded 
study design is considerate of the practical limitations of recruitment and 
retention of subjects in these ultra-orphan populations. The novel primary 
endpoint, the Clinical Impression of Change in Severity© (CI-CS), accommodates 
the heterogenous clinical presentation of NPC, GM2, and A-T: at screening, the 
principal investigator appoints for each patient a primary anchor test (either 
the 8-m walk test (8MWT) or 9-hole peg test of the dominant hand (9HPT-D)) based 
on his/her unique clinical symptoms. The anchor tests are videoed in a 
standardized manner at each visit to capture all aspects related to the 
patient's functional performance. The CI-CS assessment is ultimately performed 
by independent, blinded raters who compare videos of the primary anchor test 
from three periods: baseline, the end of treatment, and the end of a 
post-treatment washout. Blinded to the time point of each video, the raters make 
an objective comparison scored on a 7-point Likert scale of the change in the 
severity of the patient's neurological signs and symptoms from video A to video 
B. To investigate both the symptomatic and disease-modifying effects of 
treatment, N-acetyl-L-leucine is assessed during two treatment sequences: a 
6-week parent study and 1-year extension phase.
DISCUSSION: The novel CI-CS assessment, developed through a collaboration of all 
stakeholders, is advantageous in that it better ensures the primary endpoint is 
functionally relevant for each patient, is able to capture small but meaningful 
clinical changes critical to the patients' quality of life (fine-motor skills; 
gait), and blinds the primary outcome assessment. The results of these three 
trials will inform whether N-acetyl-L-leucine is an effective treatment for NPC, 
GM2, and A-T and can also serve as a new therapeutic paradigm for the 
development of future treatments for other orphan diseases.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The three trials (IB1001-201 for Niemann-Pick disease type C 
(NPC), IB1001-202 for GM2 gangliosidoses (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff), IB1001-203 
for ataxia telangiectasia (A-T)) have been registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov

BACKGROUND: Researchers are working at unprecedented speed to develop a 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We aimed to assess the value of a hypothetical vaccine and 
its potential public health impact when prioritization is required due to supply 
constraints.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was used to estimate COVID-19 related direct 
medical costs and deaths in the United States (US), with and without 
implementation of a 60% efficacious vaccine. To prioritize the vaccine under 
constrained supply, the population was divided into tiers based on age; risk and 
age; and occupation and age; and outcomes were compared across one year under 
various supply assumptions. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained versus no vaccine was calculated for the entire adult population 
and for each tier in the three prioritization schemes.
RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained for the US adult population was 
$8,200 versus no vaccination. For the tiers at highest risk of complications 
from COVID-19, such as those ages 65 years and older, vaccination was 
cost-saving compared to no vaccination. The cost per QALY gained increased to 
over $94,000 for those with a low risk of hospitalization and death following 
infection. Results were most sensitive to infection incidence, vaccine price, 
the cost of treating COVID-19, and vaccine efficacy. Under the most optimistic 
supply scenario, the hypothetical vaccine may prevent 31% of expected deaths. As 
supply becomes more constrained, only 23% of deaths may be prevented. In lower 
supply scenarios, prioritization becomes more important to maximize the number 
of deaths prevented.
CONCLUSIONS: A COVID-19 vaccine is predicted to be good value for money (cost 
per QALY gained <$50,000). The speed at which an effective vaccine can be made 
available will determine how much morbidity and mortality may be prevented in 
the US.

BACKGROUND: The objectives of this research were to determine the savings of 
loss-of-life expectancy (LE) and lifetime medical costs (LMC) from prevention of 
spinal cord injuries (SCI) in Taiwan.
METHODS: From the claims database of Taiwan National Health Insurance, we 
identified 6164 adult patients with newly diagnosed SCI with permanent 
functional disability from 2000 to 2015 and followed them until the end of 2016. 
We estimated survival function through the Kaplan-Meier method and extrapolated 
it to lifetime.
RESULTS: For the SCI cohort, the LE and loss-of-LE were 17.6 and 13.3 years, 
respectively, while those for SCI with coding of external causes (E-code) were 
18.1 and 13.0 years, respectively. For the SCI cohort with E-code, the 
loss-of-LE of motor vehicle (MV)-related SCI was significantly higher than that 
of fall-related SCI. In young and middle-aged patients with SCI with E-code, the 
loss-of-LE of MV-related paraplegia was significantly higher than that of 
MV-related quadriplegia and fall-related SCI. With a 3% discount rate, the LMC 
for patients with SCI after diagnosis were US$82 772, while those for patients 
with SCI with E-code were US$81 473. The LMC and the cost per year for those 
living with quadriplegia were significantly higher than those for paraplegia in 
all age groups, possibly related to the higher frequencies of stroke, chronic 
lung disease and dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that quadriplegia has a higher impact on medical costs 
than paraplegia, and MV-related SCI has a higher impact on loss-of-LE than 
fall-related SCI. We recommend comprehensive SCI prevention be established, 
including infrastructures of construction and transportation.

Heart failure-either with reduced or preserved ejection fraction 
(HFrEF/HFpEF)-is a clinical syndrome of multifactorial and gender-dependent 
aetiology, indicating the insufficiency of the heart to pump blood adequately to 
maintain blood flow to meet the body's needs. Typical symptoms commonly include 
shortness of breath, excessive fatigue with impaired exercise capacity, and 
peripheral oedema, thereby alluding to the fact that heart failure is a syndrome 
that affects multiple organ systems. Patients suffering from progressed heart 
failure have a very limited life expectancy, lower than that of numerous cancer 
types. In this position paper, we provide an overview regarding interactions 
between the heart and other organ systems, the clinical evidence, underlying 
mechanisms, potential available or yet-to-establish animal models to study such 
interactions and finally discuss potential new drug interventions to be 
developed in the future. Our working group suggests that more experimental 
research is required to understand the individual molecular mechanisms 
underlying heart failure and reinforces the urgency for tailored therapeutic 
interventions that target not only the heart but also other related affected 
organ systems to effectively treat heart failure as a clinical syndrome that 
affects and involves multiple organs.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is among the leading causes of 
death in the US. Although research has shown that ASCVD has genetic elements, 
the understanding of how genetic testing influences its prevention and treatment 
has been limited. To this end, we model the health trajectory of patients 
stochastically and determine treatment and testing decisions simultaneously. 
Since the cholesterol level of patients is one controllable risk factor for 
ASCVD events, we model cholesterol treatment plans as Markov decision processes. 
We determine whether and when patients should receive a genetic test using value 
of information analysis. By simulating the health trajectory of over 64 million 
adult patients, we find that 6.73 million patients undergo genetic testing. The 
optimal treatment plans informed with clinical and genetic information save 
5,487 more quality-adjusted life-years while costing $1.18 billion less than the 
optimal treatment plans informed with clinical information only. As precision 
medicine becomes increasingly important, understanding the impact of genetic 
information becomes essential.

Consumption of nutrient-rich seaweeds and fermented nondairy foods represent 
fast growing trends among health-minded consumers. Assessment of lacto-fermented 
seaweed was performed to address these trends, and to offer shelf-life extension 
and product diversification for fresh kelps. The objectives were to evaluate the 
effects of kelp species and inclusion level on fermentation kinetics, 
physicochemical quality, safety, shelf-life, and consumer acceptability of a 
seaweed sauerkraut-style product. Six formulations with different inclusion 
levels (25, 50, and 75%) of shredded kelp (sugar kelp, SK or winged kelp, WK) 
were mixed with cabbage, 2% salt, and inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum 
(approximately 106 CFU/g) and Leuconostoc mesenteroides (approximately 101 
CFU/g). Products were processed in triplicate, fermented until a target pH of 
≤4.6 was achieved, and sampled periodically for 60 days. Kelp species and 
inclusion level significantly affected most variables tested. The most rapid 
fermentation (3 days), as evidenced by pH decrease, lactic acid bacteria counts, 
and lactic acid levels, was noted in WK formulations. Some SK formulations took 
up to 14 days to achieve the target pH, and coliforms persisted to a greater 
extent in the SK formulations. Higher levels of kelp decreased the fermentation 
rate and concentration of fermentable sugars in the brine, but increased the 
total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of the sauerkrauts. Despite 
differences in instrumental color (L* a* b* ) and texture (shear force) among 
formulations, overall liking as rated by a consumer panel was not significantly 
affected by species or inclusion level. Results support the use of 
lacto-fermentation in the production of refrigeration-stable seaweed 
sauerkraut-style product. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Health-conscious consumers are 
becoming increasingly interested in plant-based diets and fermented foods, and 
the development of novel seaweed sauerkraut-style products can help to meet 
these needs. This study demonstrated the successful production of a 
sauerkraut-style product formulated with up to 50% farm-raised kelp. Physical, 
chemical, microbiological, and consumer acceptability testing established lactic 
acid fermentation as a viable method for shelf life extension and value addition 
of fresh kelps. These results provide science-based information on an 
alternative processing method for cultivated seaweeds and can assist the 
industry in product diversification efforts.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to the progressive loss of memory and other 
cognitive functions. It is the most common form of dementia in the elderly and 
has become a major public health problem due to the increase in life expectancy. 
Although the detection of AD is based on several neuropsychological tests, 
imaging, and biological analyses, none of these biomarkers allows a clear 
understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the disease, and 
no efficient treatment is currently available. Metabolomics, which allows the 
study of biochemical alterations underlying pathological processes, could help 
to identify these mechanisms, to discover new therapeutic targets, and to 
monitor the therapeutic response and disease progression. In this review, we 
have summarized and analyzed the results from a number of studies on 
metabolomics analyses performed in biological samples originated from the 
central nervous system, in AD subjects, and in animal models of this disease. 
This synthesis revealed modified expression of specific metabolites in 
pathological conditions which allowed the identification of significantly 
impacted metabolic pathways both in animals and humans, such as the arginine 
biosynthesis and the alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. We discuss 
the potential biochemical mechanisms involved, the extent to which they could 
impact the specific hallmarks of AD, and the therapeutic approaches which could 
be proposed as a result.

Radiotherapy (RT) is rarely used in the palliative management of muscle-invasive 
bladder cancer (MIBC). This survey aims to explore current care patterns within 
the Italian Radiation Oncologist community on this topic. In 2020, the 
uro-oncological study group of the Italian Association of Radiotherapy and 
Clinical Oncology (AIRO) conducted a survey evaluating the RT role in advanced 
MIBC. An electronic questionnaire was administered online to the society members 
asking for: general considerations, patients' selection, and aim of the 
treatment, RT schedule and practical consideration, past and future perspective. 
Sixty-one questionnaires were returned (33% response rate). Most responders 
(62.30%) declared to work in a Center with a multidisciplinary uro-oncological 
team, and 8.20% to evaluate more than 20 patients with MIBC/year for palliative 
RT. Elderly patients were the most frequently evaluated (46.7%) and life 
expectancy was the most common selection criteria (44.60%). Thirty Gy in 10 
fractions (58.9%), whole bladder as GTV (62.5%), PTV isotropic margins of 
1.5-2 cm (44.6%) and IMRT/VMAT technique (58.14%) were the most common treatment 
choices. Patients amenable for bladder palliative RT were most commonly referred 
by the urologist (43.86%) or the multidisciplinary team (38%). The reported main 
reasons for the low involvement of radiation oncologist in the management of 
MIBC patients were low attention to the palliative setting in bladder cancer 
(37.5%); radiation oncologist not involved in the management of these patients 
(32.1%); cases not discussed in the multidisciplinary board (26.8%). This survey 
illustrated the current use of palliative RT for patients with advanced MIBC in 
Italy and suggested the need for a greater involvement of radiation oncologists 
in their management.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of core stability exercises on backache and 
quality of life of postmenopausal women.
METHODS: he comparative study was conducted at the Department of Physical 
Therapy, Margalla General Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from February to June 
2018, and comprised post-menopausal woman aged 40-60 years having backache who 
were randomly divided into experimental group A and control group B. Group A 
underwent core stability exercises along with traditional therapy, while group B 
had traditional low backache physical therapy. Each participant was treated 
three days a week for 12 weeks. The outcome was assessed using the manual muscle 
testing numerical pain rating scale, Oswestry disability index and Utian quality 
of life scale at baseline, week 6 and week 12. Data was analysed using SPSS 21.
RESULTS: Of the 35 subjects initially enrolled, 24(68.5%) completed the study. 
Of them, 14(58.3%) cases were in group A and 10(41.6%) controls in group B. The 
overall mean age was 54.54±5.13 years, mean menopause duration was 99.79±50.02 
months, and mean duration of backache complaint was 23.95±14.85 months. 
Differences in outcome were significant between the groups for flexion and 
extension manual muscle testing and Utian quality of life scale (p<0.05) and 
non-significant for numerical pain rating scaleand Oswestry disability index 
(p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Core stability exercises were found to have the ability to reduce 
pain, disability and to improve strength and quality of life.

    CA Cancer J Clin. 2021 Jul;71(4):283-284.

BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend offering cessation interventions to smokers 
eligible for lung cancer screening, but there is little data comparing specific 
cessation approaches in this setting. We compared the benefits and costs of 
different smoking cessation interventions to help screening programs select 
specific cessation approaches.
METHODS: We conducted a societal-perspective cost-effectiveness analysis using a 
Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network model simulating 
individuals born in 1960 over their lifetimes. Model inputs were derived from 
Medicare, national cancer registries, published studies, and micro-costing of 
cessation interventions. We modeled annual lung cancer screening following 2014 
US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines plus cessation interventions 
offered to current smokers at first screen, including pharmacotherapy only or 
pharmacotherapy with electronic and/or web-based, telephone, individual, or 
group counseling. Outcomes included lung cancer cases and deaths, life-years 
saved, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved, costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Compared with screening alone, all cessation interventions decreased 
cases of and deaths from lung cancer. Compared incrementally, efficient 
cessation strategies included pharmacotherapy with either web-based cessation 
($555 per QALY), telephone counseling ($7562 per QALY), or individual counseling 
($35 531 per QALY). Cessation interventions continued to have costs per QALY 
well below accepted willingness to pay thresholds even with the lowest 
intervention effects and was more cost-effective in cohorts with higher smoking 
prevalence.
CONCLUSION: All smoking cessation interventions delivered with lung cancer 
screening are likely to provide benefits at reasonable costs. Because the 
differences between approaches were small, the choice of intervention should be 
guided by practical concerns such as staff training and availability.

The majority of in vitro studies assessing cancer treatments are performed in 
two-dimensional (2D) monolayers and are subsequently validated in in vivo animal 
models. However, 2D models fail to accurately model the tumour microenvironment. 
Furthermore, animal models are not directly applicable to mimic the human 
scenario. Three-dimensional (3D) culture models may help to address the 
discrepancies of 2D and animal models. When cancer cells escape the primary 
tumour, they can invade at distant organs building secondary tumours, called 
metastasis. The development of metastasis leads to a dramatic decrease in the 
life expectancy of patients. Therefore, 3D systems to model the microenvironment 
of metastasis have also been developed. Several studies have demonstrated 
changes in cell behaviour and gene expression when cells are cultured in 3D 
compared to 2D and concluded a better comparability to cells in vivo. Of special 
importance is the effect seen in response to anti-cancer treatments as models 
are built primarily to serve as drug-testing platforms. This review highlights 
these changes between cancer cells grown in 2D and 3D models for some of the 
most common cancers including lung, breast and prostate tumours. In addition to 
models aiming to mimic the primary tumour site, the effects of 3D cell culturing 
in bone metastasis models are also described. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Most in 
vitro studies in cancer research are performed in 2D and are subsequently 
validated in in vivo animal models. However, both models possess numerous 
limitations: 2D models fail to accurately model the tumour microenvironment 
while animal models are expensive, time-consuming and can differ considerably 
from humans. It is accepted that the cancer microenvironment plays a critical 
role in the disease, thus, 3D models have been proposed as a potential solution 
to address the discrepancies of 2D and animal models. This review highlights 
changes in cell behaviour, including proliferation, gene expression and 
chemosensitivity, between cancer cells grown in 2D and 3D models for some of the 
most common cancers including lung, breast and prostate cancer as well as bone 
metastasis.

INTRODUCTION: Diaphragmatic complications following gastrostomies for gastric 
malignancies are extremely rare. The incidence of hiatal hernias after total 
gastrectomy for carcinoma is not well documented because of the poor prognosis 
associated with gastric cancer and the short life expectancy.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: This case report presents a 66-year-old male patient who 
developed an acute incarcerated hiatal hernia 8 month after total gastrectomy 
for gastric adenocarcinoma. The patient was found to have a herniated alimentary 
limb and dilated, incarcerated loops of the bowel through the 3.5-cm hiatal 
defect. The hernia was gently reduced. Posterior cruroplasty without mesh 
augmentation was performed with nonabsorbable sutures. The patient was 
discharged in good general condition. His history highlights an important and 
potentially morbid complication following gastrectomy.
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, only 5 cases have been reported in the literature. 
The incidence of symptomatic hiatal hernias following esophageal and gastric 
resection for carcinoma is 2.8%, and the median time between primary surgery and 
the diagnosis of hiatal hernias is 15 months.
CONCLUSION: During primary surgery, it is recommended, in the cases of 
pre-existing hiatal hernias or a crural dissection, to perform cruroplasty after 
adequate mobilization of the lower thoracic esophagus and a tension-free 
subdiaphragmatic anastomosis.
