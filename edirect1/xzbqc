neutral and acidic conditions.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated a 
Fab-selective mutant (SpGC3Fab) to avoid possible interference with the 
FcRn-mediated recycling process and improved its affinity for mouse and human 
IgG by site-directed mutagenesis and phage display selections. In mice, this 
affinity-improved mutant (SpGC3FabRR) conferred prolonged plasma half-lives 
compared with SpGC3Fab when fused to small recombinant antibody fragments, such 
as single-chain Fv (scFv) and bispecific single-chain diabody (scDb). Hence, the 
SpGC3FabRR domain seems to be a suitable fusion partner for the half-life 
extension of small recombinant therapeutics.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The half-life extension properties of SpGC3 can be 
retained by restricting binding to the Fab fragment of serum immunoglobulins and 
can be improved by increasing binding activity. The modified SpGC3 module should 
be suitable to extend the half-life of therapeutic proteins and, thus to improve 
therapeutic activity.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine the relationship between 
cervical spine sagittal alignment and clinical outcomes after cervical 
laminoplasty in patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal 
ligament (OPLL).
METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients who underwent a cervical laminoplasty for 
OPLL between January 2012 and January 2013 and who were followed up for at least 
1 year were analyzed in this study. Standing plain radiographs of the cervical 
spine, CT (midsagittal view), and MRI (T2-weighted sagittal view) were obtained 
(anteroposterior, lateral, flexion, and extension) pre- and postoperatively. 
Cervical spine alignment was assessed with the following 3 parameters: the C2-7 
Cobb angle, C2-7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA), and T-1 slope minus C2-7 Cobb 
angle. The change in cervical sagittal alignment was defined as the difference 
between the post- and preoperative C2-7 Cobb angles, C2-7 SVAs, and T-1 slope 
minus C2-7 Cobb angles. Outcome assessments (visual analog scale [VAS], Oswestry 
Neck Disability Index [NDI], 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36], and 
Japanese Orthopaedic Association [JOA] scores) were obtained in all patients 
pre- and postoperatively.
RESULTS: The average patient age was 56.3 years (range 38-72 years). There were 
34 male patients and 16 female patients. Cervical laminoplasty for OPLL helped 
alleviate radiculomyelopathy. Compared with the preoperative scores, improvement 
was seen in postoperative VAS and JOA scores. After laminoplasty, 35 patients 
had kyphotic changes, and 15 had lordotic changes. However, cervical sagittal 
alignment after laminoplasty was not significantly associated with clinical 
outcomes in terms of postoperative improvement of the JOA score (C2-7 Cobb 
angle: p = 0.633; C2-7 SVA: p = 0.817; T-1 slope minus C2-7 lordosis: p = 
0.554), the SF-36 score (C2-7 Cobb angle: p = 0.554; C2-7 SVA: p = 0.793; T-1 
slope minus C2-7 lordosis: p = 0.829), the VAS neck score (C2-7 Cobb angle: p = 
0.263; C2-7 SVA: p = 0.716; T-1 slope minus C2-7 lordosis: p = 0.497), or the 
NDI score (C2-7 Cobb angle: p = 0.568; C2-7 SVA: p = 0.279; T-1 slope minus C2-7 
lordosis: p = 0.966). Similarly, the change in cervical sagittal alignment was 
not related to the JOA (p = 0.604), SF-36 (p = 0.308), VAS neck (p = 0.832), or 
NDI (p = 0.608) scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Cervical laminoplasty for OPLL improved radiculomyelopathy. 
Cervical laminoplasty increased the probability of cervical kyphotic alignment. 
However, cervical sagittal alignment and clinical outcomes were not clearly 
related.

OBJECTIVE: The successful scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 
sub-Saharan Africa has led to increasing life expectancy, and thus increased 
risk of hypertension. We aimed to describe the incidence and predictors of 
hypertension in HIV patients receiving ART at a publicly funded clinic in rural 
Uganda.
METHODS: We abstracted data from medical records of adult patients who initiated 
ART at an HIV clinic in south-western Uganda during 2010-2012. We defined 
hypertension as at least two consecutive clinical visits, with a SBP at least 
140 mmHg and/or SBP of at least 90 mmHg, or prescription for an antihypertensive 
medication. We calculated the incidence of hypertension and fit multivariable 
Cox proportional-hazards models to identify predictors of hypertension.
RESULTS: A total of 3389 patients initiated ART without a prior diagnosis of 
hypertension during the observation period. Over 3990 person-years of follow-up, 
445 patients developed hypertension, for a crude incidence of 111.5/1000 (95% 
confidence interval 101.9-121.7) person-years. Rates were highest among men aged 
at least 40 years (158.8 per/1000 person-years) and lowest in women aged 30-39 
years (80/1000 person-years). Lower CD4 cell count at ART initiation, as well as 
traditional risk factors including male sex, increasing age, and obesity, were 
independently associated with hypertension.
CONCLUSION: We observed a high incidence of hypertension in HIV-infected persons 
on ART in rural Uganda, and increased risk with lower nadir CD4 cell counts. Our 
findings call for increased attention to screening of and treatment for 
hypertension, along with continued prioritization of early ART initiation.

Comment in
    Global Morbidity and Mortality of Leptospirosis: A Systematic Review.

BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis, a spirochaetal zoonosis, occurs in diverse 
epidemiological settings and affects vulnerable populations, such as rural 
subsistence farmers and urban slum dwellers. Although leptospirosis can cause 
life-threatening disease, there is no global burden of disease estimate in terms 
of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) available.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We utilised the results of a parallel 
publication that reported global estimates of morbidity and mortality due to 
leptospirosis. We estimated Years of Life Lost (YLLs) from age and gender 
stratified mortality rates. Years of Life with Disability (YLDs) were developed 
from a simple disease model indicating likely sequelae. DALYs were estimated 
from the sum of YLLs and YLDs. The study suggested that globally approximately 
2.90 million DALYs are lost per annum (UIs 1.25-4.54 million) from the 
approximately annual 1.03 million cases reported previously. Males are 
predominantly affected with an estimated 2.33 million DALYs (UIs 0.98-3.69) or 
approximately 80% of the total burden. For comparison, this is over 70% of the 
global burden of cholera estimated by GBD 2010. Tropical regions of South and 
South-east Asia, Western Pacific, Central and South America, and Africa had the 
highest estimated leptospirosis disease burden.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Leptospirosis imparts a significant health burden 
worldwide, which approach or exceed those encountered for a number of other 
zoonotic and neglected tropical diseases. The study findings indicate that 
highest burden estimates occur in resource-poor tropical countries, which 
include regions of Africa where the burden of leptospirosis has been 
under-appreciated and possibly misallocated to other febrile illnesses such as 
malaria.

The State of Health in Older Adults in Japan: Trends in Disability, Chronic 
Medical Conditions and Mortality.

of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

Both life expectancy and healthy life expectancy in Japan have been increasing 
and are among the highest in the world, but the gap between them has also been 
widening. To examine the recent trends in old age disability, chronic medical 
conditions and mortality in Japan, we retrospectively analyzed three nationally 
representative datasets: Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions (2001-2013), 
Patient Survey (1996-2011) and Vital Statistics (1995-2010). We obtained the 
sex- and age-stratified trends in disability rate, treatment rates of nine 
selected chronic medical conditions (cerebrovascular diseases, joint disorders, 
fractures, osteoporosis, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, pneumonia and malignant neoplasms), total mortality rate and 
mortality rates from specific causes (cerebrovascular diseases, heart diseases, 
pneumonia and malignant neoplasms) in both sexes in four age strata (65-69, 
70-74, 75-79, 80-84 years). Disability rates declined significantly in both 
sexes. Treatment rates of all selected medical conditions also decreased 
significantly, except for fractures in women and pneumonia. Both total mortality 
rate and cause-specific mortality rates decreased in both sexes. We concluded 
that the recent decline in disability rates, treatment rates of chronic medical 
conditions and mortality rates points toward overall improvement in health 
conditions in adults over the age of 65 years in Japan. Nonetheless, considering 
the increase in the number of older adults, the absolute number of older adults 
with disability or chronic medical conditions will continue to increase and 
challenge medical and long-term care systems.

OBJECTIVE: Life expectancy in Japan is high, suggesting that the Japanese diet, 
Nihon shoku (Japanese food), has significant health benefits. However, these 
benefits have been called into question over the past 50 y, during which time 
the Japanese diet has become increasingly Westernized. The aim of the present 
study was to focus on senescence delay and to examine the effects of Japanese 
diets from different years to identify which Japanese diet is most effective in 
enhancing life expectancy and delaying senescence.
METHODS: Weekly menus from the years 1960, 1975, 1990, and 2005 were reproduced 
based on the National Health and Nutrition Survey in Japan and prepared as 
powdered foods. The senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice were fed 
standard laboratory chow supplemented with a 30% mix of Japanese meals from 
various years ad libitum throughout their lifetime. Additionally, the control 
group was given standard laboratory chow only, to examine the development of 
mice reared under standard conditions.
RESULTS: In the group that ingested the traditional 1975 Japanese diet, life 
span was prolonged, senescence was delayed, and learning and memory capacities 
were maintained compared with the group fed the 2005 Japanese diet. The life 
span of the group that ingested the 1990 Japanese diet showed a tendency to be 
longer than SAMP8 mice fed the 2005 diet.
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggested that the traditional 
Japanese diet is more effective in enhancing life expectancy and delaying 
senescence than the current Japanese diet.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of prostate cancer 
that led urologists to perform prostate biopsies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight hundred and eight patients had prostate biopsies in 
5 tertiary centres in 2010. Following data were collected: age, PSA, DRE, 
prostate volume, negative prior prostate biopsy and estimated life expectancy (> 
or <10 years). The risk of prostate cancer was calculated by validated nomogram 
of PCPT-CRC and SWOP-PRI and correlated with pathological biopsy results.
RESULTS: In final analysis, 625 patients were included, 568 (90.9%) had a life 
expectancy greater than 10 years. Prostate cancer was found in 291 (46.6%) 
cases. These patients were older (66.7 ± 6.8 vs 64.3 ± 5.6 years, P < 0.001), 
had higher PSA values (10 ± 7.9 vs 7.7 ± 4.3 ng/mL, P < 0.0001) and the prostate 
volume decreased (43.8 ± 19.8 vs 51.3 ± 20.7 mL, P < 0.0001) compared with 
healthy subjects. Digital Rectal Examination was more frequently suspicious in 
the group of patients with prostate cancer (43.6% vs 18.9%, P < 0.0001). Risk of 
prostate cancer estimated was 50.6 ± 14% for PCPT-CRC without ATCD, 56.2 ± 12.8% 
with PCPT-CRC ATCD and 31.2 ± 17.3% for SWOP-PRI. The likelihood of high-risk 
prostate cancer was 22.4 ± 16.9% with the PCPT-CRC, and 14.8 ± 18.2% with 
SWOP-PRI.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that urologists performed prostate biopsies when 
the risk of cancer was high.

Association between sleep deficiency and cardiometabolic disease: implications 
for health disparities.

BACKGROUND: Cardiometabolic diseases, which include obesity, diabetes, 
hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, are associated with reduced quality of 
life and reduced life expectancy. Unfortunately, there are racial/ethnic and 
socioeconomic disparities associated with these diseases such that minority 
populations, such as African Americans and Hispanics, and those of lower 
socioeconomic status, experience a greater burden. Several reports have 
indicated that there are differences in sleep duration and quality that mirror 
the disparities in cardiometabolic disease. The goal of this paper is to review 
the association between sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk because of the 
possibility that suboptimal sleep may partially mediate the cardiometabolic 
disease disparities.
METHODS: We review both experimental studies that have restricted sleep duration 
or impaired sleep quality and examined biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease 
risk, including glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, appetite regulation 
and food intake, and immune function. We also review observational studies that 
have examined the association between habitual sleep duration and quality, and 
the prevalence or risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular 
disease.
CONCLUSION: Many experimental and observational studies do support an 
association between suboptimal sleep and increased cardiometabolic disease risk.

Mutations within the gene encoding for the chloride ion channel cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) results in cystic fibrosis (CF), the 
most common lethal autosomal recessive genetic disease that causes a number of 
long-term health problems, as the bone disease. Osteoporosis and increased 
vertebral fracture risk associated with CF disease are becoming more important 
as the life expectancy of patients continues to improve. The etiology of low 
bone density is multifactorial, most probably a combination of inadequate peak 
bone mass during puberty and increased bone losses in adults. Body mass index, 
male sex, advanced pulmonary disease, malnutrition and chronic therapies are 
established additional risk factors for CF-related bone disease (CFBD). 
Consistently, recent evidence has confirmed that CFTR plays a major role in the 
osteoprotegerin (OPG) and COX-2 metabolite prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, 
two key regulators in the bone formation and regeneration. Several others 
mechanisms were also recognized from animal and cell models contributing to 
malfunctions of osteoblast (cell that form bone) and indirectly of 
bone-resorpting osteoclasts. Understanding such mechanisms is crucial for the 
development of therapies in CFBD. Innovative therapeutic approaches using CFTR 
modulators such as C18 have recently shown in vitro capacity to enhance PGE2 
production and normalized the RANKL-to-OPG ratio in human osteoblasts bearing 
the mutation F508del-CFTR and therefore potential clinical utility in CFBD. This 
review focuses on the recently identified pathogenic mechanisms leading to CFBD 
and potential future therapies for treating CFBD.

NASA has derived new models for radiological risk assessment based on 
epidemiological data and radiation biology including differences in Relative 
Biological Effectiveness for leukemia and solid tumors. Comprehensive approaches 
were used to develop new risk cross sections and the extension of these into 
recommendations for risk assessment during space missions. The methodology 
relies on published data generated and the extensive research initiative managed 
by the NASA Human Research Program (HRP) and reviewed by the National Academy of 
Sciences. This resulted in recommendations for revised specifications of quality 
factors, QNASA(Z,β) in terms of track structure concepts that extend beyond LET 
alone. The new paradigm for quality factors placed demands on radiation 
monitoring procedures that are not satisfied by existing dosimetry systems or 
particle spectrometers that are practical for space exploration where mass, 
volume, band width and power consumption are highly constrained. We have 
proposed a new definition of quality factors that relaxes the requirements for 
identifying charge, Z, and velocity, β, of the incident radiation while still 
preserving the functional form of the inherent risk functions. The departure 
from the exact description of QNASA(Z,β) is that the revised values are new 
functions of LET for solid cancers and leukemia. We present the motivation and 
process for developing the revised quality factors. We describe results of 
extensive simulations using GCR distributions in free space as well as the 
resulting spectra of primary and secondary particles behind aluminum shields and 
penetration through water. In all cases the revised dose averaged quality 
factors agreed with those based on the values obtained using QNASA(Z,β). This 
provides confidence that emerging technologies for space radiation dosimetry can 
provide real time measurements of dose and dose equivalent while satisfying 
constraints on size, mass, power and bandwidth. The revised quality factors are 
sufficiently generalized to be applicable to radiation protection practices 
beyond space exploration.

Calcific aortic valve disease: is it another face of atherosclerosis?

Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common valvular heart disease 
in the elderly. As life expectancy increases, prevalence of CAVD is expected to 
rise. CAVD is characterized by progressive dystrophic calcification of aortic 
cusps. In the initial stages, the pathogenesis is similar to atherosclerosis, 
characterized by basement membrane disruption, inflammation, cell infiltration, 
lipid deposition, and calcification. Presence of osteopontin in calcified aortic 
valves suggests pathological calcification and bone formation in these calcified 
valves. Historical, experimental, genetic, and clinical evidences suggest that 
CAVD and atherosclerosis share the same pathological sequences with common risk 
factors. Understanding the two faces of atherosclerosis, the vascular and 
valvular, will help us to prevent progression of aortic sclerosis to aortic 
stenosis, by controlling modifiable risk factors and by initiating statin 
therapy in them. However, the knowledge about these preventive measures and 
drugs is scanty. In this review article, an attempt is made to unfurl the 
relation between atherosclerosis and CAVD.

Nodulation is an essential process for biological nitrogen (N2) fixation in 
legumes, but its regulation remains poorly understood. Here, a β-expansin gene, 
GmEXPB2, was found to be critical for soybean (Glycine max) nodulation. GmEXPB2 
was preferentially expressed at the early stage of nodule development. 
β-Glucuronidase staining further showed that GmEXPB2 was mainly localized to the 
nodule vascular trace and nodule vascular bundles, as well as nodule cortical 
and parenchyma cells, suggesting that GmEXPB2 might be involved in cell wall 
modification and extension during nodule formation and development. 
Overexpression of GmEXPB2 dramatically modified soybean root architecture, 
increasing the size and number of cortical cells in the root meristematic and 
elongation zones and expanding root hair density and size of the root hair zone. 
Confocal microscopy with green fluorescent protein-labeled rhizobium USDA110 
cells showed that the infection events were significantly enhanced in the 
GmEXPB2-overexpressing lines. Moreover, nodule primordium development was 
earlier in overexpressing lines compared with wild-type plants. Thereby, 
overexpression of GmEXPB2 in either transgenic soybean hairy roots or whole 
plants resulted in increased nodule number, nodule mass, and nitrogenase 
activity and thus elevated plant N and phosphorus content as well as biomass. In 
contrast, suppression of GmEXPB2 in soybean transgenic composite plants led to 
smaller infected cells and thus reduced number of big nodules, nodule mass, and 
nitrogenase activity, thereby inhibiting soybean growth. Taken together, we 
conclude that GmEXPB2 critically affects soybean nodulation through modifying 
root architecture and promoting nodule formation and development and 
subsequently impacts biological N2 fixation and growth of soybean.

AIM: To review and evaluate the most recent literature on the economic outcomes 
of pharmacist-managed services in people with diabetes.
BACKGROUND: The global prevalence of diabetes is increasing. Although 
pharmacist-managed services have been shown to improve people's health outcomes, 
the economic impact of these programmes remains unclear.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of six databases. Study inclusion 
criteria were: (1) original research; (2) evaluation of pharmacist-managed 
services in people with diabetes; (3) an economic evaluation; (4) 
English-language publication; and (5) full-text, published between January 2006 
and December 2014. The quality of the full economic evaluations reviewed was 
evaluated using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards 
checklist.
RESULTS: A total of 2204 articles were screened and 25 studies were selected. 
These studies were conducted in a community pharmacy (n = 10), a clinic- 
/hospital-based outpatient facility (n = 8), or others. Pharmacist-managed 
services included targeted education (n = 24), general pharmacotherapeutic 
monitoring (n = 21), health screening or laboratory testing services (n = 9), 
immunization services (n = 2) and pharmacokinetic monitoring (n = 1). Compared 
with usual care, pharmacist-managed services resulted in cost savings that 
varied from $7 to $65,000 ($8 to $85,000 in 2014 US dollars) per person per 
year, and generated higher quality-adjusted life years with lower costs. 
Benefit-to-cost ratios ranged from 1:1 to 8.5:1. Among the 25 studies reviewed, 
11 were full economic evaluations of moderate quality.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist-managed services had a positive return in terms of 
economic viability. With the expanding role of pharmacists in the healthcare 
sector, alongside increasing health expenditure, future economic studies of high 
quality are needed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of these services.

The advancements in the field of gerontology have unraveled the signaling 
pathways that regulate life span, suggesting that it might be feasible to 
modulate aging. To this end, we isolated a novel phytomolecule Acacetin 
7-O-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl (1-2) β-D-xylopyranoside (ARX) from Premna integrifolia 
and evaluated its antiaging effects in Caenorhabditis elegans The spectral data 
analysis revealed the occurrence of a new compound ARX. Out of the three tested 
pharmacological doses of ARX, viz. 5, 25, and 50 µM, the 25-µM dose was able to 
extend life span in C. elegans by more than 39%. The present study suggests that 
ARX affects bacterial metabolism, which in turn leads to dietary restriction 
(DR)-like effects in the worms. The effect of ARX on worms with mutations 
(mev-1, eat-2, sir-2.1, skn-1, daf-16, and hsf-1) indicates that ARX-mediated 
life-span extension involves mechanisms associated with DR and maintenance of 
cellular redox homeostasis. This study is the first time report on 
longevity-promoting activity of ARX in C. elegans mediated by stress and 
DR-regulating genes. This novel phytomolecule can contribute in designing 
therapeutics for managing aging and age-related diseases.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of interventional 
treatment for varicose veins (VV) in the UK NHS, and to inform the national 
clinical guideline on VV, published by the National Institute of Health and Care 
Excellence.
DESIGN: An economic analysis was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness 
of surgery, endothermal ablation (ETA), ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy 
(UGFS), and compression stockings (CS). The analysis was based on a Markov 
decision model, which was developed in consultation with members of the NICE 
guideline development group (GDG).
METHODS: The model had a 5-year time horizon, and took the perspective of the UK 
National Health Service. Clinical inputs were based on a network meta-analysis 
(NMA), informed by a systematic review of the clinical literature. Outcomes were 
expressed as costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: All interventional treatments were found to be cost-effective compared 
with CS at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained. ETA was 
found to be the most cost-effective strategy overall, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of £3,161 per QALY gained compared with UGFS. Surgery 
and CS were dominated by ETA.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventional treatment for VV is cost-effective in the UK NHS. 
Specifically, based on current data, ETA is the most cost-effective treatment in 
people for whom it is suitable. The results of this research were used to inform 
recommendations within the NICE guideline on VV.

Disability-Adjusted Life Years among Drug Users in Khon Kaen: An Evidence-Based 
Approach.

Loeiyood J, Luvira V, Kanato M.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) among drug 
users in Khon Kaen.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between 
January 2014 and February 2015. Patients' medical records, supported by the Khon 
Kaen Provincial Public Health Office, were used for data regarding the treatment 
ofthe drug users between October 2013 and September 2014. SPSS version 19.0 for 
windows was used to analyze descriptive statistics and Pearson's correlations.
RESULTS: A review of medical records revealed a total number of drug users were 
3,605 males (92.25%) and 303 females (7.75%). A total of 2,195 cases (56.17%) 
were drug dependence. 20 drug users died due to drug-related causes. A total 
DALYs were 6,772.26 and a prevalence rate of DALYs was 3.76/1,000 populations. 
The correlation analyses showed significantly factors related to the DALYs among 
drug users were age, occupation, pattern of drug use, levels of severity, 
drug-related death and treatment services.
CONCLUSION: The DALYs were apparently high among male drug users, who completed 
primay school education, were drug-dependent and being treated in group therapy. 
The health authorities may use these associated factors in order to develop or 
improve programs related to prevention, harm reduction and treatment services 
effectively.

AIM: Etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is unclear and results from 
a complex interplay of genetic, microbial, environmental and immune factors. 
Elucidating the mechanisms that drive IBD depends on the detailed 
characterization of human inflammatory mediators in animal models. Therefore, we 
studied how intestinal inflammation affects heparanase, NF-κB and Hsp70 gene 
expression in rats, and if current intestinal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(sulphasalazine, prednisolone and azathioprine) act on these expressions. 
Moreover, we investigated the relationships among these genes with colonic 
cytokines levels (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, INF-γ and IL-10) and oxidative stress that 
have fundamental role in IBD.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Macroscopic parameters (diarrhea, extension of lesion, 
colonic weight/length ratio and damage score), biochemical markers 
(myeloperoxidase and alkaline phosphatase activities, and glutathione, IL-1β, 
TNF-α, IL-6, INF-γ and IL-10 levels), gene expressions (heparanase, NF-κB and 
Hsp70), and microscopic evaluations (optic, electronic scanning and transmission 
microscopic) were performed in rats.
KEY FINDINGS: Expression of heparanase, Hsp70 and NF-κB and oxidative stress 
were increased by inflammatory process and differentially modulated by 
sulphasalazine, prednisolone and azathioprine treatments. Protective effects of 
drugs were also related to differential modulation of cytokine changes induced 
by inflammatory process, showing different mechanisms to control inflammation.
SIGNIFICANCE: Heparanase, NF-κB and Hsp70 gene expression participate in the 
inflammatory response induced by TNBS and represent pharmacological targets of 
the intestinal anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, current drugs used to treat 
IBD (sulphasalazine, prednisolone and azathioprine) differentially modulate 
heparanase, NF-κB and Hsp70 gene expression, cytokine production and oxidative 
stress.

Columbia, Canada.

BACKGROUND: The storage of platelets (PLTs) in additive solution (AS) may 
facilitate improved PLT quality and possibly extension of the PLT shelf life. A 
minimum amount of plasma is required when PLTs are stored in AS, as a source of 
glucose. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of reducing the plasma 
carryover to 20% on PLT quality when stored in SSP+ for an extended period.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a pool-and-split design, buffy coat-derived PLTs 
were stored in either 30% plasma/SSP+ or 20% plasma/SSP+. In vitro analyses were 
carried out to Day 10. Metabolites and markers of PLT activation and apoptosis 
were measured using a blood gas analyzer and flow cytometry. PLT apoptotic 
protein expression was investigated by Western blotting.
RESULTS: Glucose exhaustion occurred in the 20% plasma group between Day 7 and 
Day 10. The surface expression of P-selectin and PAC-1 was comparable on Day 10 
in both groups, suggesting that the PLTs were not activated. However, the 
exposure of phosphatidylserine and the number of phosphatidylserine-positive 
microparticles were significantly higher in the 20% group on Day 10. The 
expression of the proapoptotic proteins Bak, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 were 
higher in the 20% plasma group by Day 7 of storage, compared to the 30% plasma 
group.
CONCLUSION: Exhaustion of glucose was associated with a proapoptotic phenotype. 
Results such as these should be considered before extending the PLT shelf life 
beyond 7 days, particularly when stored in ASs lacking glucose with low plasma 
carryover.

INTRODUCTION: Recent WHO guidance advocates for early antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) initiation at higher CD4 counts to improve survival and reduce HIV 
transmission. We sought to quantify how the cost-effectiveness and 
epidemiological impact of early ART strategies in India are affected by 
attrition throughout the HIV care continuum.
METHODS: We constructed a dynamic compartmental model replicating HIV 
transmission, disease progression and health system engagement among Indian 
adults. Our model of the Indian HIV epidemic compared implementation of early 
ART initiation (i.e. initiation above CD4 ≥350 cells/mm(3)) with delayed 
initiation at CD4 ≤350 cells/mm(3); primary outcomes were incident cases, 
deaths, quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) and costs over 20 years. We assessed 
how costs and effects of early ART initiation were impacted by suboptimal 
engagement at each stage in the HIV care continuum.
RESULTS: Assuming "idealistic" engagement in HIV care, early ART initiation is 
highly cost-effective ($442/QALY-gained) compared to delayed initiation at CD4 
≤350 cells/mm(3) and could reduce new HIV infections to <15,000 per year within 
20 years. However, when accounting for realistic gaps in care, early ART 
initiation loses nearly half of potential epidemiological benefits and is less 
cost-effective ($530/QALY-gained). We project 1,285,000 new HIV infections and 
973,000 AIDS-related deaths with deferred ART initiation with current levels of 
care-engagement in India. Early ART initiation in this continuum resulted in 
1,050,000 new HIV infections and 883,000 AIDS-related deaths, or 18% and 9% 
reductions (respectively), compared to current guidelines. Strengthening HIV 
screening increases benefits of earlier treatment modestly (1,001,000 new 
infections; 22% reduction), while improving retention in care has a larger 
modulatory impact (676,000 new infections; 47% reduction).
CONCLUSIONS: Early ART initiation is highly cost-effective in India but only has 
modest epidemiological benefits at current levels of care-engagement. Improved 
retention in care is needed to realize the full potential of earlier treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to quantify the effect of different statistical 
techniques, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and missing data on the predicted 
median survival age.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Using the Canadian cystic fibrosis registry (CCFR), 
the median age of survival was calculated using both the Cox proportional 
hazards (PH) and the life-table methods. Through simulations, we examined how 
the median age of survival would change when: (1) patients were excluded, (2) 
death dates were inaccurate, (3) patients were lost to follow-up, (4) entire 
years with no clinic visits were excluded even if the​ patient had a visit in 
subsequent years, and (5) censoring patients at their date of transplant. 
Simulations were run assuming 5-35% of data were affected by each scenario.
RESULTS: Over the period 2009-2013, there were 4,666 individuals in the CCFR 
with 240 deaths. The observed median age of survival calculated by the Cox PH 
method was 50.9 [95% confidence interval (CI): 47.4, 54.3] and 50.5 from the 
life-table method (95% CI: 47.5, 53.5). Censoring patients at their transplant 
date overestimated the median age of survival by 7.2 years (58.1; 95% CI: 53.3, 
64.7). Simulations determined that by missing just 15% of deaths, the median age 
of survival can be overestimated by 3.5 years (54.4; 95% CI: 54.2, 56.1), and 
having 25% of patients lost to follow-up can underestimate the median age of 
survival by 3.3 years (47.6; 95% CI: 46.8, 47.7).
CONCLUSION: We present several recommendations to assist national cystic 
fibrosis registries in calculating and reporting the median age of survival in a 
standardized fashion. It is imperative to state the statistical method used as 
well as the proportion lost to follow-up and the treatment of missing data and 
transplanted patients. Registries must be diligent in their data collection as 
incomplete data can lead to overestimation and underestimation of survival.

BACKGROUND: To explore the safety, efficacy, and oncological outcome of 3-port 
laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) compared to open radical cystectomy (ORC) 
in patients older than 75 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From June 2010 to July 2014, we analyzed 16 radical 
cystectomies in patients older than 75 years (LRC group=8; ORC group=8). 
Demographic parameters, operative variables, and perioperative outcome in the 2 
groups were retrospectively collected, analyzed, and compared.
RESULTS: Patients in both groups had comparable preoperative characteristics. A 
significantly longer operating time (476 vs. 303 min, P=0.0002) and less 
estimated blood loss (627 vs. 2,106 mL, P=0.021) were observed in the LRC group 
compared to the ORC group. Infection and ileus were the most common early 
complications after surgery. Patients who underwent ORC suffered from more 
postoperative infection (22.2% vs. 0.0%, P=0.054) and ileus (25.0% vs. 12.5%, 
P=0.521) than the LRC group, but the difference was not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Judging from this initial trial, 3-port LRC can be safely carried 
out in elderly patients. We suggest 3-port LRC as the primary intervention to 
treat muscle-invasive or high-risk nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer in elderly 
patients with an otherwise relatively long life expectancy.

Few neoplastic diseases have undergone a transformation in a relatively short 
period like chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has in the last few years. In 1960, 
CML was the first cancer in which a unique chromosomal abnormality was 
identified and a pathophysiologic correlation suggested. Landmark work followed, 
recognizing the underlying translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that gave 
rise to this abnormality and, shortly afterward, the specific genes involved and 
the pathophysiologic implications of this novel rearrangement. Fast forward a 
few years and this knowledge has given us the most remarkable example of a 
specific therapy that targets the dysregulated kinase activity represented by 
this molecular change. The broad use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has resulted 
in an improvement in the overall survival to the point where the life expectancy 
of patients today is nearly equal to that of the general population. Still, 
there are challenges and unanswered questions that define the reasons why the
