Background The objective of the study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
cilostazol (a selective phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor) added to aspirin or 
clopidogrel for secondary stroke prevention in patients with noncardioembolic 
stroke. Methods and Results A Markov model decision tree was used to examine 
lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of patients with 
noncardioembolic stroke treated with either aspirin or clopidogrel or with 
additional cilostazol 100 mg twice daily. Cohorts were followed until all 
patients died from competing risks or ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation was used to 
model 10 000 cohorts of 10 000 patients. The addition of cilostazol to aspirin 
or clopidogrel is strongly cost saving. In all 10 000 simulations, the 
cilostazol strategy resulted in lower health care costs compared with aspirin or 
clopidogrel alone (mean $13 488 cost savings per patient; SD, $8087) and 
resulted in higher QALYs (mean, 0.585 more QALYs per patient lifetime; SD, 
0.290). This result remained robust across a variety of sensitivity analyses, 
varying cost inputs, and treatment effects. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$50 000/QALY, average net monetary benefit from the addition of cilostazol was 
$42 743 per patient over their lifetime. Conclusions Based on the best available 
data, the addition of cilostazol to aspirin or clopidogrel for secondary 
prevention following noncardioembolic stroke results in significantly reduced 
health care costs and a gain in lifetime QALYs.

Cancer is the leading cause of death and the most significant determinant of 
life expectancy in almost every country in this twenty-first century. According 
to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is responsible for the leading 
cause of death globally. Benzophenone derivatives are found in a variety of 
naturally occurring compounds which are known to be pharmacologically 
efficacious against a variety of diseases, including cancer. Microtubules are 
thought to be a good target for cancer chemotherapies. Microtubule 
polymerization and depolymerization are induced by a variety of natural, 
synthetic, and semisynthetic chemicals having a benzophenone nucleus, affecting 
tubulin dynamics. Several medications that affect microtubule dynamics are in 
various stages of clinical trials, including Combretastatins (phase II), 
Vincristine (clinically approved), Paclitaxel (in clinical usage), and 
epothilone (phase III), and only a few have been patented. Benzophenone 
derivatives target the colchicine binding site of microtubules, damage them and 
cause cell cycle arrest in the G2-M phase. Belonging to this class of molecules, 
phenstatin, a potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization, has shown strongly 
inhibit cancer cell growth and arrest the G2/M phase of the cell cycle by 
targeting the colchicine binding site of microtubules. In the present 
manuscript, we described the benzophenone as tubulin polymerization inhibitors, 
their Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs) and molecular docking studies that 
reveal its binding affinity with the colchicine binding site.

INTRODUCTION: This study on pyogenic spinal infections with intraspinal epidural 
involvement (PSI +) compared the outcome of patients with spinal cord injury 
(SCI) to those without (noSCI) taking diagnostic algorithm, therapy, and 
complications into account.
METHODS: Patients were enrolled in an ambispective study (2012-2017). Diagnostic 
and therapeutic algorithms, complications, and neurological outcome were 
analyzed descriptively. Survival was analyzed applying Kaplan-Meier method and 
Cox regression.
RESULTS: In total, 134 patients with a median (IQR) age of 72 (61-79) years were 
analyzed. Baseline characteristics were similar between the SCI (n = 55) and 
noSCI (n = 79). A higher percentage of endocarditis (9% vs. 0%; p = 0.03) was 
detected in the noSCI group. The majority (81%) received combinatorial therapy 
including spinal surgery and antibiotic treatment. The surgery complication rate 
was 16%. At discharge, improvement in neurologic function was present in 27% of 
the SCI patients. Length of stay, duration of ventilation and the burden of 
disease-associated complications were significantly higher in the SCI group 
(e.g., urinary tract infection, pressure ulcers). Lethality risk factors were 
age (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.16, p = 0.014), and empyema/abscess extension (≥ 3 
infected spinal segments, HR 4.72, 95% CI 1.57-14.20, p = 0.006), dominating 
over additional effects of Charlson comorbidity index, SCI, and type of 
treatment. The overall lethality rate was 11%.
CONCLUSION: PSI + are associated with higher in-hospital mortality, particularly 
when multiple spinal segments are involved. However, survival is similar with 
(SCI) or without myelopathy (noSCI). If SCI develops, the rate of disease 
complications is higher and early specialized SCI care might be substantial to 
reduce complication rates.

OBJECTIVE: Class III obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥40 kg/m2 ) is associated 
with worse knee pain and total knee replacement (TKR) outcomes. Because 
bariatric surgery yields sustainable weight loss for individuals with BMI ≥40 
kg/m2 , our objective was to establish the value of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
(RYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in conjunction with usual care 
for knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients with BMI ≥40 kg/m2 .
METHODS: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy model to assess long-term clinical 
benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of RYGB and LSG. We derived model inputs 
for efficacy, costs, and complications associated with these treatments from 
published data. Primary outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), all 
discounted at 3%/year. This analysis was conducted from a health care sector 
perspective. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate uncertainty in input 
parameters.
RESULTS: The usual care + RYGB strategy increased the quality-adjusted life 
expectancy by 1.35 years and lifetime costs by $7,209, compared to usual care 
alone (ICER = $5,300/QALY). The usual care + LSG strategy yielded less benefit 
than usual care + RYGB and was dominated. Relative to usual care alone, both 
usual care + RYGB and usual care + LSG reduced opioid use from 13% to 4%, and 
increased TKR usage from 30% to 50% and 41%, respectively. For cohorts with BMI 
between 38 and 41 kg/m2 , usual care + LSG dominated usual care + RYGB. In the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$50,000/QALY, usual care + RYGB and usual care + LSG were cost-effective in 70% 
and 30% of iterations, respectively.
CONCLUSION: RYGB offers good value among knee OA patients with BMI ≥40 kg/m2 , 
while LSG may provide good value among those with BMI between 35 and 41 kg/m2 .

    Sci Immunol. 2022 Jun 3;7(72):eabq2791.

Interleukin-25 (IL-25) and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) defend the host 
against intestinal helminth infection and are associated with inappropriate 
allergic reactions. IL-33-activated ILC2s were previously found to augment 
protective tissue-specific pancreatic cancer immunity. Here, we showed that 
intestinal IL-25-activated ILC2s created an innate cancer-permissive 
microenvironment. Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with higher tumor IL25 
expression had reduced survival and increased IL-25R-expressing tumor-resident 
ILC2s and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) associated with impaired 
antitumor responses. Ablation of IL-25 signaling reduced tumors, virtually 
doubling life expectancy in an Apc mutation-driven model of spontaneous 
intestinal tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, IL-25 promoted intratumoral ILC2s, 
which sustained tumor-infiltrating MDSCs to suppress antitumor immunity. 
Therapeutic antibody-mediated blockade of IL-25 signaling decreased intratumoral 
ILC2s, MDSCs, and adenoma/adenocarcinoma while increasing antitumor adaptive T 
cell and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-mediated immunity. Thus, the roles of innate 
epithelium-derived cytokines IL-25 and IL-33 as well as ILC2s in cancer cannot 
be generalized. The protumoral nature of the IL-25-ILC2 axis in CRC highlights 
this pathway as a potential therapeutic target against CRC.

BACKGROUND: Drug resistance is common in focal epilepsy. In this update, we 
summarised the current evidence regarding add-on levetiracetam in treating 
drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The original review was published in 2001 and 
last updated in 2012.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of levetiracetam when used as an 
add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web, which 
includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register and CENTRAL), MEDLINE 
Ovid, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry 
Platform (ICTRP) to November 2018. We contacted the manufacturers of 
levetiracetam and researchers in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished 
trials.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, placebo-controlled trials of add-on 
levetiracetam treatment in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials 
for inclusion, assessed trials for bias, extracted data, and evaluated the 
overall certainty of the evidence. Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater 
reduction in focal seizure frequency (response), treatment withdrawal, adverse 
effects (including a specific analysis of changes in behaviour), cognitive 
effects, and quality of life (QoL). Primary analysis was intention-to-treat. We 
performed meta-analysis for all outcomes using a Mantel-Haenszel approach and 
calculated risk ratios (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all 
estimates apart from adverse effects (99% CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using 
a Chi² test and the I² statistic.
MAIN RESULTS: This update included 14 trials (2455 participants), predominantly 
possessing low risks of bias. Participants were adults in 12 trials (2159 
participants) and children in the remaining two (296 participants). The doses of 
levetiracetam tested were 500 mg/day to 4000 mg/day in adults, and 60 mg/kg/day 
in children. Treatment ranged from 12 to 24 weeks. When individual doses were 
examined, levetiracetam at either 500 mg/day or 4000 mg/day did not perform 
better than placebo for the 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency 
outcome (500 mg: RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.62; P = 0.26; 4000 mg: RR 1.64, 95% 
CI 0.59 to 4.57; P = 0.34). Levetiracetam was significantly better than placebo 
at all other individual doses (1000 mg to 3000 mg). RR was significantly in 
favour of levetiracetam compared to placebo when results were pooled across all 
doses (RR 2.37, 95% CI 2.02 to 2.78; 14 studies, 2455 participants; 
moderate-certainty evidence). Dose-response analysis demonstrated that the odds 
of achieving response (50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency) were 
increased by nearly 40% (odds ratio (OR) 1.39, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.58) for each 
1000 mg increase in dose of levetiracetam. There were important levels of 
heterogeneity across multiple comparisons. Participants were not significantly 
more likely to experience treatment withdrawal with levetiracetam than with 
placebo (pooled RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 13 studies, 2428 participants; 
high-certainty evidence). Somnolence was the most common adverse effect, 
affecting 13% of participants, and it was significantly associated with 
levetiracetam compared to placebo (pooled RR 1.62, 99% CI 1.19 to 2.20; 13 
studies, 2423 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Changes in behaviour 
were negligible in adults (1% affected; RR 1.79, 99% CI 0.59 to 5.41), but 
significant in children (23% affected; RR 1.90, 99% CI 1.16 to 3.11). 
Levetiracetam had a positive effect on some aspects of cognition and QoL in 
adults and worsened certain aspects of child behaviour.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this review update finds that in both adults and 
children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, levetiracetam added on to usual 
care is more effective than placebo at reducing seizure frequency, it is 
unlikely to be stopped by patients, and it has minimal adverse effects outside 
of potential worsening behaviour in children. These findings are unchanged from 
the previous review update in 2012. This review update contributes two key 
additional findings: 1. a 500 mg daily dose of levetiracetam is no more 
effective than placebo at reducing seizures; and 2. the odds of response (50% 
reduction in seizure frequency) are increased by nearly 40% for each 1000 mg 
increase in dose of levetiracetam. It seems reasonable to continue the use of 
levetiracetam in both adults and children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

AIM: This economic analysis evaluated the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab (NIVO) 
plus ipilimumab (IPI) plus two cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy (PDC) 
compared with four cycles of PDC as first-line treatment for patients with 
advanced NSCLC in the United States (US).
METHODS: A partitioned survival model was constructed with three mutually 
exclusive health states: progression free, progressed disease, and death. The 
analysis was conducted from a US healthcare payer perspective, using a time 
horizon of 25 years. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. Survival 
outcomes from CheckMate 9LA were extrapolated with longer follow-up data from 
CheckMate 227 Part 1 (NIVO + IPI) and validated against data from other relevant 
clinical trials and real-world registries. Health-related quality of life 
utility values were derived from EQ-5D-3L data collected in CheckMate 9LA. 
US-specific costs (2020 dollars) were used for disease management; drug 
acquisition, administration, and monitoring; end-of-life care; adverse events; 
and subsequent treatments. Model outcomes included life years (LYs) gained, 
quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) for NIVO + IPI + PDC versus PDC. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were 
conducted.
RESULTS: NIVO + IPI + PDC was associated with higher projected health benefits 
than PDC, including gains in LYs (3.71 vs 1.89) and QALYs (2.86 vs 1.37), and 
higher costs ($317,581 vs $119,909). The ICER was $132,960/QALY gained. 
NIVO + IPI + PDC had a 78-100% probability of being cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000-$250,000/QALY. Sensitivity and scenario 
analyses indicated that the results were robust to changes in key parameters.
LIMITATIONS: The inherent limitation in extrapolating clinical trial data was 
mitigated using data from the more mature CheckMate 227 Part 1 trial and 
validating the outcomes against data from other relevant trials and real-world 
registries.
CONCLUSION: NIVO + IPI + PDC (two cycles) provides a new first-line treatment 
option for patients with advanced NSCLC that is cost-effective within a range 
considered acceptable in the US.

AIM: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab (NIVO + IPI) versus platinum-doublet chemotherapy (PDC) for the 
first-line treatment of stage IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
from a third-party payer perspective in the United States (US).
METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed using efficacy, safety, and 
utility inputs derived from Part 1 of the phase 3 CheckMate 227 trial 
(NCT02477826) with 37.7-month minimum follow-up for overall survival (OS). OS 
and progression-free (PF) survival were extrapolated over a 20-year time-horizon 
using parametric spline-based models selected based on goodness of fit and 
validated with data from external sources. Duration of treatment Kaplan-Meier 
curves were used for treatment cost calculations. US-specific costs (2021 
dollars) for drug acquisition, administration, and monitoring; disease 
management (PF and progressed disease health states); end-of-life care; adverse 
events; and subsequent treatments were derived from publicly available sources. 
Time-to-death utilities were applied in the base case, whereas 
treatment-specific progression-based utilities were tested in a scenario 
analysis. Main outcomes included incremental cost per life-year gained (LYG) and 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Model uncertainty was assessed through 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: NIVO + IPI resulted in 1.53 additional life-years, 1.33 additional 
QALYs, and $142 088 in additional costs compared with PDC. The incremental cost 
per LYG was $92 651, whereas incremental cost per QALY gained was $106 553. The 
application of treatment-specific progression-based utilities yielded an 
incremental cost per QALY gained of $117 076. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
revealed a 98% probability that NIVO + IPI was cost-effective versus PDC at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: NIVO + IPI was estimated to be cost-effective as a first-line 
treatment for stage IV or recurrent NSCLC in the US, with increased survival and 
higher cost compared with PDC.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between burden of disease and research funding has 
been examined cross-sectionally, but temporal patterns have not been 
investigated. It is logical to assume that temporal improvements in 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) reflect benefits from research funding; 
such assumptions are tempered by an unknown lag time for emergence of benefits 
from research.
METHODS: We studied National Institutes of Health (NIH) research fund 
allocations and United States DALY estimates for overlapping disease categories 
(matched disease categories, MDC, N = 38). Using a general linear model, we 
separately analysed DALYs for MDCs in 2017 in relation to NIH research 
allocations in 2017 and 2007. We also examined how changes in DALYs were related 
to cumulative NIH research funding (2006-2017). After regressing DALY change on 
summed funding, we obtained model residuals as estimates of the discrepancy for 
each MDC between observed and expected change in burden, given funding.
RESULTS: In 2017, there was a positive association between NIH research fund 
allocations and DALYs for the same year (F1,36 = 16.087, p = 0.0002921; 
slope = 0.35020; model R2 = 0.3088), suggesting proportionate allocation. There 
was a positive association between 2017 DALYs and 2007 NIH research allocation, 
implying a beneficial impact of research (F1,36 = 15.754, p = 0.0003; 
slope = 0.8845; model R2 = 0.3044). In contrast, there was a nonsignificant 
association between summed NIH funding and percent change in DALYs over 
2006-2017 (F1,36 = 0.199; p = 0.65; beta coefficient = -1.144). When MDCs were 
ordered based on residuals, HIV/AIDS ranked first. Mental, neurologic or 
substance abuse (MNS) disorders comprised most residuals in the lower half.
CONCLUSIONS: NIH fund allocation is proportional to DALYs for MDCs. Temporal 
changes in DALYs vary by MDCs, but they are not significantly related to 
cumulative research outlays. Further analysis of temporal changes in DALYs could 
help to inform research outlays for MDCs and to study the impact of research.

BACKGROUND: Pneumoconiosis refers to a class of serious diseases threatening the 
health of workers exposed to coal or silicosis dust. However, the burden of 
pneumoconiosis is unavailable in China.
METHODS: Incident cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from 
pneumoconiosis and its subtypes in China were estimated from the Global Burden 
of Disease Study 2019 using a Bayesian meta-regression method. The trend of the 
burden from pneumoconiosis was analyzed using percentage change and annualized 
rate of change (ARC) during the period 1990-2019. The relationship between 
subnational socio-demographic index (SDI) and the ARC of age-standardised death 
rate was measured using Spearman's Rank-Order Correlation.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 136.8 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 113.7-162.5) 
thousand new cases, 10.2 (8.1-13.6) thousand deaths, and 608.7 (473.6-779.4) 
thousand DALYs from pneumoconiosis in China. Of the global burdens from 
pneumoconiosis, more than 60% were in China. Both the total number of new cases 
and DALYs from pneumoconiosis was keeping increasing from 1990 to 2019. In 
contrast, the age-standardised incidence, death, and DALY rates from 
pneumoconiosis and its subtypes, except for the age-standardised incidence rate 
of silicosis, and age-standardised death rate of asbestosis, experienced a 
significant decline during the same period. The subnational age-standardised 
death rates were higher in western China than in eastern China. Meanwhile, the 
subnational ARC of age-standardised death rates due to pneumoconiosis and its 
subtypes were significantly negatively correlated with SDI in 2019.
CONCLUSION: China suffers the largest health loss from pneumoconiosis in the 
world. Reducing the burden of pneumoconiosis is still an urgent task in China.

Patterns of integration and modularity among organismal traits are prevalent 
across the tree of life, and at multiple scales of biological organization. Over 
the past several decades, researchers have studied these patterns at the 
developmental, and evolutionary levels. While their work has identified the 
potential drivers of these patterns at different scales, there appears to be a 
lack of consensus on the relationship between developmental and evolutionary 
integration. Here, we review and summarize key studies and build a framework to 
describe the conceptual relationship between these patterns across organismal 
scales and illustrate how, and why some of these studies may have yielded 
seemingly conflicting outcomes. We find that among studies that analyze patterns 
of integration and modularity using morphological data, the lack of consensus 
may stem in part from the difficulty of fully disentangling the developmental 
and functional causes of integration. Nonetheless, in some empirical systems, 
patterns of evolutionary modularity have been found to coincide with 
expectations based on developmental processes, suggesting that in some 
circumstances, developmental modularity may translate to evolutionary 
modularity. We also advance an extension to Hallgrímsson et al.'s palimpsest 
model to describe how patterns of trait modularity may shift across different 
evolutionary scales. Finally, we also propose some directions for future 
research which will hopefully be useful for investigators interested in these 
issues.

Dendritic spines are small protrusions arising from dendrites and constitute the 
major compartment of excitatory post-synapses. They change in number, shape, and 
size throughout life; these changes are thought to be associated with formation 
and reorganization of neuronal networks underlying learning and memory. As 
spines in the brain are surrounded by the microenvironment including neighboring 
cells and the extracellular matrix, their protrusion requires generation of 
force to push against these structures. In turn, neighboring cells receive force 
from protruding spines. Recent studies have identified BAR-domain proteins as 
being involved in membrane deformation to initiate spine formation. In addition, 
forces for dendritic filopodium extension and activity-induced spine expansion 
are generated through cooperation between actin polymerization and clutch 
coupling. On the other hand, force from expanding spines affects 
neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals. Here, we review recent 
advances in our understanding of the physical aspects of synapse formation and 
plasticity, mainly focusing on spine dynamics.

BACKGROUND: Predicting older patients' life expectancy is an important yet 
challenging task. Hospital aged care assessment teams advise treating teams on 
older patients' type and place of care, directly affecting quality of care. Yet, 
little is known about their experiences with prognostication.
METHODS: Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven 
geriatricians/ registrars, ten nurses and three allied health staff from aged 
care assessment teams across two hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. Data were 
analysed thematically.
RESULTS: To generate prognoses, clinicians used analytical thinking, intuition, 
assessments from others, and pattern matching. Prognostic tools were an 
underutilised resource. Barriers to recognition of dying included: diffusion of 
responsibility regarding whose role it is to identify patients at end-of-life; 
lack of feedback about whether a prognosis was correct; system pressures to 
pursue active treatment and vacate beds; avoidance of end-of-life discussions; 
lack of confidence, knowledge and training in prognostication and 
pandemic-related challenges.

Caesarean section (CS) is one of the most performed operations worldwide. In 
many parts of the world, there has been a reduction in anaesthetic associated 
obstetric mortality, and this has been attributed to the increased use of 
neuraxial anaesthesia and improved safety of general anaesthesia, alongside 
improved training and organisational changes. In resource-limited countries, 
anaesthesia contributes disproportionately to maternal mortality, with one in 
seven deaths being due to anaesthesia. A major contributory factor to this is 
the severe shortage of trained anaesthetic providers. Goals for anaesthesia for 
CS include the woman's comfort and foetal well-being, focusing on strategies to 
minimise morbidity and mortality for both. Anaesthetic options for CS include 
neuraxial techniques (spinal or combined-spinal epidural or epidural extension 
of labour analgesia) and general anaesthesia. There is increasing evidence of 
the benefit of neuraxial techniques over general anaesthesia in terms of 
maternal and foetal outcomes. For elective CS, spinal and combined-spinal 
anaesthesia predominate. General anaesthesia is mainly reserved for Category 1 
CS where there is an immediate threat to the life of the mother or the baby. 
This review discusses the practical aspects of neuraxial and general anaesthesia 
for CS.

Neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab induces high pathologic response rates 
(pRRs) in clinical stage III nodal melanoma, and pathologic response is strongly 
associated with prolonged relapse-free survival (RFS). The PRADO extension 
cohort of the OpACIN-neo trial ( NCT02977052 ) addressed the feasibility and 
effect on clinical outcome of using pathologic response after neoadjuvant 
ipilimumab and nivolumab as a criterion for further treatment personalization. 
In total, 99 patients with clinical stage IIIb-d nodal melanoma were included 
and treated with 6 weeks of neoadjuvant ipilimumab 1 mg kg-1 and nivolumab 
3 mg kg-1. In patients achieving major pathologic response (MPR, ≤10% viable 
tumor) in their index lymph node (ILN, the largest lymph node metastasis at 
baseline), therapeutic lymph node dissection (TLND) and adjuvant therapy were 
omitted. Patients with pathologic partial response (pPR; >10 to ≤50% viable 
tumor) underwent TLND only, whereas patients with pathologic non-response (pNR; 
>50% viable tumor) underwent TLND and adjuvant systemic therapy ± synchronous 
radiotherapy. Primary objectives were confirmation of pRR (ILN, at week 6) of 
the winner neoadjuvant combination scheme identified in OpACIN-neo; to 
investigate whether TLND can be safely omitted in patients achieving MPR; and to 
investigate whether RFS at 24 months can be improved for patients achieving pNR. 
ILN resection and ILN-response-tailored treatment were feasible. The pRR was 
72%, including 61% MPR. Grade 3-4 toxicity within the first 12 weeks was 
observed in 22 (22%) patients. TLND was omitted in 59 of 60 patients with MPR, 
resulting in significantly lower surgical morbidity and better quality of life. 
The 24-month relapse-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival rates 
were 93% and 98% in patients with MPR, 64% and 64% in patients with pPR, and 71% 
and 76% in patients with pNR, respectively. These findings provide a strong 
rationale for randomized clinical trials testing response-directed treatment 
personalization after neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Whether non-selective β-blockers can prevent decompensation 
of cirrhosis warrants clarification. Carvedilol might be particularly effective 
since its intrinsic vasodilatory activity may ameliorate hepatic vascular 
resistance, a major mechanism of portal hypertension in early cirrhosis. We 
assessed whether carvedilol may prevent decompensation and improve survival in 
patients with compensated cirrhosis and clinically significant portal 
hypertension (CSPH).
METHODS: By systematic review we identified randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) 
comparing carvedilol vs. control therapy (no-active treatment or endoscopic 
variceal ligation [EVL]) in patients with cirrhosis and CSPH without previous 
bleeding. We performed a competing-risk time-to-event meta-analysis using 
individual patient data (IPD) obtained from principal investigators of RCTs. 
Only compensated patients were included. Primary outcomes were prevention of 
decompensation (liver transplantation and death were competing events) and death 
(liver transplantation was a competing event). Models were adjusted using 
propensity scores for baseline covariates with the inverse probability of 
treatment weighting (IPTW) approach.
RESULTS: Among 125 full-text studies evaluated, 4 RCTs were eligible. The 4 
provided IPD and were included, comprising 352 patients with compensated 
cirrhosis, 181 treated with carvedilol and 171 controls (79 received EVL and 92 
placebo). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Standardized 
differences were <10% by IPTW. The risk of developing decompensation of 
cirrhosis was lower with carvedilol than in controls (subdistribution hazard 
ratio [SHR] 0.506; 95% CI 0.289-0.887; p = 0.017; I2 = 0.0%, Q-statistic-p = 
0.880), mainly due to a reduced risk of ascites (SHR 0.491; 95% CI 0.247-0.974; 
p = 0.042; I2 = 0.0%, Q-statistic-p = 0.384). The risk of death was also lower 
with carvedilol (SHR 0.417; 95% CI 0.194-0.896; p = 0.025; I2 = 0.0%, 
Q-statistic-p = 0.989).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term carvedilol therapy reduced decompensation of cirrhosis 
and significantly improved survival in compensated patients with CSPH. This 
suggests that screening patients with compensated cirrhosis for CSPH to enable 
the prompt initiation of carvedilol could improve outcomes.

LAY SUMMARY: The transition from compensated cirrhosis to decompensated 
cirrhosis is associated with markedly reduced life expectancy. Therefore, 
preventing decompensation in patients with compensated cirrhosis would be 
associated with greatly improved patient outcomes. There has been controversy 
regarding the use of non-selective β-blockers (portal pressure-lowering 
medications) in patients with cirrhosis and elevated portal blood pressure 
(portal hypertension). Herein, using a competing-risk meta-analysis to optimize 
sample size and properly investigate cirrhosis as a multistate disease and 
outcomes as time-dependent events, we show that carvedilol (a non-selective 
β-blocker) is associated with a reduced risk of decompensating events and 
improved survival in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
