OBJECTIVES: Patient navigation (PN) services have been shown to improve cancer 
screening in disparate populations. This study estimates the cost-effectiveness 
of implementing PN services within the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early 
Detection Program (NBCCEDP).
METHODS: We adapted a breast cancer simulation model to estimate a population 
cohort of women aged 40-64 years from the NBCCEDP through their lifetime. We 
incorporated their screening frequency and screening and diagnostic costs.
RESULTS: Within the NBCCEDP, Program with PN (vs. No PN) resulted in a greater 
number of mammograms per woman (4.23 vs. 4.14), lower lifetime mortality from 
breast cancer (3.53% vs. 3.61%), and fewer missed diagnostic resolution per 
woman (0.017 vs. 0.025). The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for 
a Program with PN was $32,531 per quality-adjusted life-years relative to 
Program with No PN.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating PN services within the NBCCEDP may be a 
cost-effective way of improving adherence to screening and diagnostic resolution 
for women who have abnormal results from screening mammography. Our study 
highlights the value of supportive services such as PN in improving the quality 
of care offered within the NBCCEDP.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Kidney transplantation offers greater life expectancy, 
quality of life and participation compared with dialysis, in children with end 
stage kidney disease. This study explores the perspectives and experiences of 
parents of children undergoing kidney transplantation, as the experiences of 
parents in the process of transplantation is not completely understood.
METHODS: Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents of 
transplanted children across New Zealand. Data were analysed using thematic 
analysis to identify themes of participant experiences and perspectives.
RESULTS: We interviewed 13 mothers and four fathers of the transplanted 
children. Four themes were identified: actively pursuing transplant (the urgency 
of transplant; needing to drive the transplantation process); lack of on-going 
support (needing access to specialists; feeling unprepared for demands of 
transplantation, and vulnerability of unmet emotional concerns), pressure on the 
family unit (strain of distance; disrupting parent team; added burden of parent 
as donor; financial stress) and constant concern for the future (living with 
enduring uncertainty; pressure of responsibility; apprehension of teenage 
years).
CONCLUSIONS: Parents of children need to play an active role in advocating and 
driving the transplantation process. Transplantation leads to parental role 
disruption, emotional and financial stress, and insecurity about the future for 
their child. These findings suggest the need for greater communication and 
transparency in the transplantation process with parents, improved emotional and 
financial support for families during and after transplantation, and explicit 
assistance for parental roles in families when a caregiver is the donor.

Precision QALYs, Precisely Unjust.

Fleck LM.

Warwick Heale has recently defended the notion of individualized and 
personalized Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) in connection with health care 
resource allocation decisions. Ordinarily, QALYs are used to make allocation 
decisions at the population level. If a health care intervention costs £100,000 
and generally yields only two years of survival, the cost per QALY gained will 
be £50,000, far in excess of the £30,000 limit per QALY judged an acceptable use 
of resources within the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. However, 
if we know with medical certainty that a patient will gain four extra years of 
life from that intervention, the cost per QALY will be £25,000. Heale argues 
fairness and social utility require such a patient to receive that treatment, 
even though all others in the cohort of that patient might be denied that 
treatment (and lose two years of potential life). Likewise, Heale argues that 
personal commitments of an individual (religious or otherwise), that determine 
how they value a life-year with some medical intervention, ought to be used to 
determine the value of a QALY for them. I argue that if Heale's proposals were 
put into practice, the result would often be greater injustice. In brief, 
requirements for the just allocation of health care resources are more complex 
than pure cost-effectiveness analysis would allow.

mobile-based interventions for substance use disorders.

BACKGROUND: Substance use disorders (SUDs) contribute significantly to global 
rates of morbidity and mortality. Internet- and mobile-based interventions 
(IMIs) have been suggested as an adjunct to face-to-face health services. 
However, the evidence for the cost-effectiveness of IMIs for SUDs is scant.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials, NHS Economic Evaluations Database, NHS 
Health Technology Assessment Database, Office of Health Economics Evaluations 
Database and EconLit was conducted. We included economic evaluations alongside 
randomized controlled trials of IMIs for SUDs compared with a control group.
RESULTS: Of 1687 abstracts identified, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. 
Targeted conditions were alcohol use disorder (four studies) and tobacco smoking 
(five studies) whereas two studies included any SUD. Cost-effectiveness results 
demonstrated that IMIs had a firm probability of being more cost-effective than 
TAU (e.g. less costs per additional abstinent person). Compared with (online) 
psycho-education, evidence towards an additional benefit of IMIs was less clear. 
Regarding cost-utility (e.g. costs per quality-adjusted life year gained), 
except for one study, results suggested that TAU and online psycho-education 
would probably be more preferable than IMIs. Quality of study reporting was at 
least adequate.
CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of IMIs being more cost-effective than TAU looks 
promising but more economic evaluations are needed in order to determine the 
economic merit of IMIs. With an increasing pressure on health care budgets, 
strategies to disseminate effective interventions at affordable costs are 
required. This review suggests that IMIs might carry that promise and have 
potential as a cost-effective strategy to scale-up existing evidence-based 
treatments for SUDs.
SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: The systematic review has been registered in the 
PROSPERO database (no. CRD42018099486).

BACKGROUND: Drug overdoses and suicides have been rising since 2000 and are 
major contributors to a 3-year decline in US life expectancy. Studies suggest 
that injured workers have elevated rates of depression and opioid use, but no 
studies have measured excess mortality related to these risks.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We linked New Mexico workers' compensation data for 
100 806 workers injured in 1994 through 2000 with Social Security Administration 
earnings and mortality data through 2013 and National Death Index cause of death 
data. We then estimated the association between receiving lost-time workers' 
compensation benefits and mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) based on Fine and Gray cause-specific subdistribution hazards 
for common causes of death and for drug-related, suicide, and alcohol-related 
mortality.
RESULTS: There was almost a 3-fold increase in combined drug-related and suicide 
mortality hazard among women (HR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.91-3.64) and a substantial 
increase among men (HR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.13-1.79). Circulatory disease 
mortality hazard was elevated for men (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.05-1.50).
CONCLUSION: Workplace injuries severe enough to require more than a week off 
work may impair workers' long-term health and well-being. Drug-related deaths 
and suicides may be important contributors to the long-term excess mortality of 
injured workers. Improved workplace conditions, improved pain treatment, better 
treatment of substance use disorders, and treatment of postinjury depression may 
substantially reduce mortality consequent to workplace injuries.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of focal high-intensity 
focussed ultrasound (F-HIFU) compared to active surveillance (AS) in patients 
with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer, in France.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov multi-state model was elaborated for this 
purpose. Our analyses were conducted from the French National Health Insurance 
perspective, with a time horizon of 10 years and a 4% discount rate for cost and 
effectiveness. A secondary analysis used a 30-year time horizon. Costs are 
presented in 2016 Euros (€), and effectiveness is expressed as quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs). Model parameters' value (probabilities for transitions 
between health states, and cost and utility of health states) is supported by 
systematic literature reviews (PubMed) and random effect meta-analyses. The cost 
of F-HIFU in our model was the temporary tariff attributed by the French 
Ministry of Health to the overall treatment of prostate cancer by HIFU (€6047). 
Our model was analysed using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, 
USA). Uncertainty about the value of the model parameters was handled through 
probabilistic analyses.
RESULTS: The five health states of our model were as follows: initial state (AS 
or F-HIFU), radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, metastasis, and death. 
Transition probabilities from the initial F-HIFU state relied on four articles 
eligible for our meta-analyses. All were non-comparative studies. Utilities 
relied on a single cohort in San Diego, CA, USA. For a fictive cohort of 1000 
individuals followed for 10 years, F-HIFU would be €207 520 more costly and 
would yield 382 less QALYs than AS, which means that AS is cost-effective when 
compared to F-HIFU. For a threshold value varying from €0 to 100 000/QALY, the 
probability of AS being cost-effective compared to F-HIFU varied from 56.5% to 
60%. This level of uncertainty was in the same range with a 30-year time 
horizon.
CONCLUSION: Given existing published data, our results suggest that AS is 
cost-effective compared to F-HIFU in patients with low- and intermediate-risk 
prostate cancer, but with high uncertainty. This uncertainty must be scaled down 
by continuing to supply the model with new published data and ideally through a 
randomised clinical trial that includes cost-effectiveness analyses.

2-Methylimidazole-Activated Morpholino Derivatives of Guanosine and Cytidine.

Efforts to develop self-replicating nucleic acids have led to insights into the 
origin of life and have also suggested potential pathways to the design of 
artificial life forms based on non-natural nucleic acids. The template-directed 
nonenzymatic polymerization of activated ribonucleotide monomers is generally 
slow because of the relatively weak nucleophilicity of the primer 3'-hydroxyl. 
To circumvent this problem, several nucleic acids based on amino-sugar 
nucleotides have been studied, and as expected, the more-nucleophilic amine 
generally results in faster primer extension. Extending this logic, we have 
chosen to study morpholino nucleic acid (MoNA), because the secondary amine of 
the morpholino-nucleotides is expected to be highly nucleophilic. We describe 
the synthesis of 2-methylimidazole-activated MoNA monomers from their 
corresponding ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates and the synthesis of an RNA 
primer with a terminal MoNA nucleotide. We show that the activated G and C MoNA 
monomers enable rapid and efficient extension of the morpholino-terminated 
primer on homopolymeric and mixed-sequenced RNA templates. Our results show that 
MoNA is a non-natural informational polymer that is worthy of further study as a 
candidate self-replicating material.

Commensal microbes have mutualistic relationships with their host and mainly 
live in the host intestine. There are many studies on the relationships between 
commensal microbes and host physiology. However, there are inconsistent results 
on the effects of commensal microbes on host lifespan. To clarify this 
controversy, we generated axenic flies by using two controlled methods - 
bleaching and antibiotic treatment - and investigated the relationship between 
the commensal microbes and host lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster. The removal 
of microbes by using bleaching and antibiotic treatments without detrimental 
effects increased fly lifespan. Furthermore, a strain of flies colonized with a 
high load of microbiota showed a greater effect on lifespan extension when the 
microbes were eliminated, suggesting that commensal bacteria abundance may be a 
critical determinant of host lifespan. Consistent with those observations, 
microbial flora of aged fly gut significantly decreased axenic fly lifespan via 
an increase in bacterial load rather than through a change of bacterial 
composition. Our elaborately controlled experiments showed that the elimination 
of commensal microbes without detrimental side effects increased fly lifespan, 
and that bacterial load was a significant determinant of lifespan. Furthermore, 
our results indicate the presence of a deterministic connection between 
commensal microbes and host lifespan.

Cilia are remarkable cellular devices that power cell motility and transduce 
extracellular signals. To assemble a cilium, a cylindrical array of 9 doublet 
microtubules push out an extension of the plasma membrane. Membrane tension 
regulates cilium formation; however, molecular pathways that link mechanical 
stimuli to ciliogenesis are unclear. Using genome editing, we introduced 
hereditary elliptocytosis (HE)- and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-associated 
mutations into the Caenorhabditis elegans membrane skeletal protein spectrin. We 
show that these mutations impair mechanical support for the plasma membrane and 
change cell shape. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses of spectrin-mutant animals 
uncovered a global down-regulation of ciliary gene expression, prompting us to 
investigate whether spectrin participates in ciliogenesis. Spectrin mutations 
affect intraflagellar transport (IFT), disrupt axonemal microtubules, and 
inhibit cilium formation, and the endogenous spectrin periodically distributes 
along cilia. Mammalian spectrin also localizes in cilia and regulates 
ciliogenesis. These results define a previously unrecognized yet conserved role 
of spectrin-based mechanical support for cilium biogenesis.

critical areas through spatial analysis.

BACKGROUND: Hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions have been 
used to assess the performance of primary health care. Few studies have compared 
geographic variation in rates of avoidable hospitalizations and characteristics 
of high-risk areas within and between countries. The aim of this study was to 
identify and compare critical areas of avoidable hospitalizations in Brazil and 
Portugal, because these countries have reformed their primary health care 
systems in recent years and have similar organizational characteristics.
METHODS: An ecological study on hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive 
conditions produced in Brazil and Portugal in 2015 was used. Geographic 
variation of rates were analyzed and compared at the municipal level. A spatial 
scan statistic was employed to identify clusters with higher risk of 
hospitalizations for acute and chronic conditions in each country separately. 
Socioeconomic and primary health care characteristics of critical areas were 
compared to non-critical areas.
RESULTS: There were high variations in rates of avoidable hospitalizations 
within and between Brazil and Portugal, with higher variations found in Brazil. 
A more evident pattern of rates was found in Portugal. Rates and cluster 
distribution of acute and chronic conditions had significant agreement for both 
countries. The differences in primary health care and socioeconomic 
characteristics between areas identified as high risk clusters and non-clusters 
varied between category of conditions and between countries.
CONCLUSION: Brazil and Portugal presented expressive regional differences with 
respect to rates of avoidable hospitalizations, indicating that there is room to 
improve by reducing such events in both countries. Different areas presented 
distinct interactions between primary health care, socioeconomic 
characteristics, and avoidable hospitalizations. Results indicate that the 
primary health care reforms, with similar organizational characteristics in 
different contexts, did not produce similar results either between or within 
countries. Possible actions to reduce these events should be defined at a local 
level.

INTRODUCTION: The association between severe psychiatric disorders and metabolic 
syndrome is well documented and goes along with a reduced life expectancy. The 
prevalence of medical comorbidities in individuals suffering from psychiatric 
disorders in Austria has not yet been examined; aim of this study was to analyze 
the prevalence of comorbid somatic disorder in individuals diagnosed with 
psychiatric disorders in Austria.
METHODS: Patients (n = 600) with a life-time diagnosis of mood and anxiety 
disorders undergoing a six-week course of intensive treatment in a psychiatric 
rehabilitation center were recruited. Prevalent somatic and psychological 
conditions, anamnestic data, medical history, blood samples, clinical and 
psychological tests as well as medication were examined to determine somatic and 
psychiatric diagnoses.
RESULTS: Metabolic disorders were highly prevalent especially in individuals 
diagnosed with affective disorders, respectively in bipolar disorder. 
Furthermore, obesity and thyroid dysfunction were found in about 40% of 
individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the present study. Significant 
gender differences were found in CVD and hypertension with higher prevalence in 
men, while thyroid dysfunction occurred more often in women also compared to the 
general female population.
CONCLUSIONS: Characterizing somatic comorbidity in individuals with psychiatric 
disorders can stimulate research to better understand possible shared etiologic 
factors and has public health implications for improving models of care. This 
could have a positive effect on the course of mental disorders, and additionally 
improve social integration and life expectancy. Knowledge about sex differences 
should be used to further improve individualized treatment of individuals with 
psychiatric disorders.

BACKGROUND: The population of Latin America is aging. Research from high-income 
countries demonstrates geriatric trauma is associated with higher morbidity and 
mortality. Very little research exists on geriatric patient (GP) injury 
prevalence in low-resource settings, like Bolivia.
METHODS: Data were collected prospectively for 34 mo in the emergency 
departments of six trauma registry hospitals in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Data were 
analyzed with Stata v14. Comparisons were made between GPs, defined as age 
greater than 65 y, and younger patients (YPs), with ages 18-64 y.
RESULTS: Of n = 8796 trauma registry patients, 10.1% (n = 797) were aged 65 y or 
above, and n = 4989 (63.1%) were aged 18-64 y. The majority of GPs suffered 
falls (n = 543, 69.6%) versus 30.9% (n = 1541) of YPs (P < 0.001). Frequently, 
GPs had isolated injuries of the pelvis/hip (15.9% versus 1.4% YP, P < 0.0001) 
or upper extremity (15.8% versus 18.5% YP, P = 0.07), while YPs had a higher 
incidence of multiple injuries (YP 14.8% versus GP 8.4%, P < 0.001). While the 
majority of patients were discharged home (GP 43.0% versus YP 48.1%, P = 0.008), 
GPs were more likely to be admitted to the hospital (32.3% versus 22.3%, 
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: As life expectancy improves, the incidence of geriatric trauma will 
continue to increase. Understanding the characteristics associated with trauma 
in GP can allow for effective prevention methods, resource distribution, and 
discharge planning.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI)/tetraplegia 
consistently rank restoring arm and hand function as their top functional 
priority to improve quality of life. Motor nerve transfers traditionally used to 
treat peripheral nerve injuries are increasingly being used to treat patients 
with cervical SCIs. In this study, the authors performed a systematic review 
summarizing the published literature on nerve transfers to restore 
upper-extremity function in tetraplegia.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE 1946-, 
Embase 1947-, Scopus 1960-, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and clinicaltrials.gov to identify 
relevant literature published through January 2019. The authors included studies 
that provided original patient-level data and extracted information on clinical 
characteristics, operative details, and strength outcomes after nerve transfer 
procedures. Critical review and synthesis of the articles were performed.
RESULTS: Twenty-two unique studies, reporting on 158 nerve transfers in 118 
upper limbs of 92 patients (87 males, 94.6%) were included in the systematic 
review. The mean duration from SCI to nerve transfer surgery was 18.7 months 
(range 4 months-13 years) and mean postoperative follow-up duration was 19.5 
months (range 1 month-4 years). The main goals of reinnervation were the 
restoration of thumb and finger flexion, elbow extension, and wrist and finger 
extension. Significant heterogeneity in transfer strategy and postoperative 
outcomes were noted among the reports. All but one case report demonstrated 
recovery of at least Medical Research Council grade 3/5 strength in recipient 
muscle groups; however, there was greater variation in the results of larger 
case series. The best, most consistent outcomes were demonstrated for 
restoration of wrist/finger extension and elbow extension.
CONCLUSIONS: Motor nerve transfers are a promising treatment option to restore 
upper-extremity function after SCI. Flexor reinnervation strategies show 
variable treatment effect sizes; however, extensor reinnervation may provide 
more consistent, meaningful recovery. Despite numerous published case reports 
describing good patient outcomes with nerve transfers, there remains a paucity 
in the literature regarding optimal timing and long-term clinical outcomes with 
these procedures.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI)/tetraplegia 
consistently rank restoring arm and hand function as their top functional 
priority to improve quality of life. Motor nerve transfers traditionally used to 
treat peripheral nerve injuries are increasingly used to treat patients with 
cervical SCIs. In this article, the authors present early results of a 
prospective clinical trial using nerve transfers to restore upper-extremity 
function in tetraplegia.
METHODS: Participants with American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grade A-C 
cervical SCI/tetraplegia were prospectively enrolled at a single institution, 
and nerve transfer(s) was performed to improve upper-extremity function. 
Functional recovery and strength outcomes were independently assessed and 
prospectively tracked.
RESULTS: Seventeen participants (94.1% males) with a median age of 28.4 years 
(range 18.2-76.3 years) who underwent nerve transfers at a median of 18.2 months 
(range 5.2-130.8 months) after injury were included in the analysis. 
Preoperative SCI levels ranged from C2 to C7, most commonly at C4 (35.3%). The 
median postoperative follow-up duration was 24.9 months (range 12.0-29.1 
months). Patients who underwent transfers to median nerve motor branches and 
completed 18- and 24-month follow-ups achieved finger flexion strength Medical 
Research Council (MRC) grade ≥ 3/5 in 4 of 15 (26.7%) and 3 of 12 (25.0%) 
treated upper limbs, respectively. Similarly, patients achieved MRC grade ≥ 3/5 
wrist flexion strength in 5 of 15 (33.3%) and 3 of 12 (25.0%) upper limbs. Among 
patients who underwent transfers to the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) for 
wrist/finger extension, MRC grade ≥ 3/5 strength was demonstrated in 5 of 9 
(55.6%) and 4 of 7 (57.1%) upper limbs 18 and 24 months postoperatively, 
respectively. Similarly, grade ≥ 3/5 strength was demonstrated in 5 of 9 (55.6%) 
and 4 of 7 (57.1%) cases for thumb extension. No meaningful donor site deficits 
were observed. Patients reported significant postoperative improvements from 
baseline on upper-extremity-specific self-reported outcome measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Motor nerve transfers are a promising treatment option to restore 
upper-extremity function after SCI. In the authors' experience, nerve transfers 
for the reinnervation of hand and finger flexors showed variable functional 
recovery; however, transfers for the reinnervation of arm, hand, and finger 
extensors showed a more consistent and meaningful return of strength and 
function.

Objective: Schizophrenia is associated with high mortality, somatic comorbidity 
and reduced life expectancy. The general practitioner (GP) plays a key role in 
the treatment of mental and physical multimorbidity. Nevertheless, it is unclear 
how much individuals with schizophrenia use primary healthcare. This study aims 
to investigate the yearly numbers of consultations in general practice for 
individuals with schizophrenia. Design and Setting: We performed a 
population-based matched cohort study of 21,757 individuals with schizophrenia 
and 435,140 age- and gender-matched references from Danish National Registers. 
Monthly general practice consultations were analysed using a generalized linear 
model with log link and assuming negative binomial distribution. Main outcome 
measures: Consultation rates in general practice up to17 years after index 
diagnosis. Results: Individuals with schizophrenia attended their GP more than 
references throughout the study period. The cases had 82% (95% CI: 78-87) and 
76% (95% CI: 71-80) more consultations in primary care after 1 year and 5 years, 
respectively. Individuals with both schizophrenia and comorbid somatic illness 
attended even more. Conclusion: Individuals with schizophrenia are in regular 
contact with their GP, especially if they have comorbid illnesses. Whether an 
average of six consultations per year for individuals with schizophrenia is 
sufficient is up for debate. The study demonstrates a potential for an increased 
prevention and treatment of individuals with schizophrenia in general practice. 
KEY POINTS Schizophrenia is associated with high mortality, somatic comorbidity 
and reduced life expectancy. Little is known about the attendance pattern in 
primary care for individuals with schizophrenia. •We found high attendance rates 
in primary care for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia from index 
diagnosis and at least 17 years after diagnosis, which suggests opportunities 
for earlier intervention to improve their somatic health. •We found an 
association between high illness comorbidity and increased risk of not attending 
the general practitioner. The most severely somatically and mentally ill 
individuals may thus be difficult to reach and support in the current healthcare 
system.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the key drivers of cost-effectiveness for cardiovascular 
magnetic resonance (CMR) when patients activate the primary percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PPCI) pathway.
DESIGN: Economic decision models for two patient subgroups populated from 
secondary sources, each with a 1 year time horizon from the perspective of the 
National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services in the UK.
SETTING: Usual care (with or without CMR) in the NHS.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients who activated the PPCI pathway, and for Model 1: 
underwent an emergency coronary angiogram and PPCI, and were found to have 
multivessel coronary artery disease. For Model 2: underwent an emergency 
coronary angiogram and were found to have unobstructed coronary arteries.
INTERVENTIONS: Model 1 (multivessel disease) compared two different ischaemia 
testing methods, CMR or fractional flow reserve (FFR), versus stress 
echocardiography. Model 2 (unobstructed arteries) compared CMR with standard 
echocardiography versus standard echocardiography alone.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Key drivers of cost-effectiveness for CMR, incremental 
costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios.
RESULTS: In both models, the incremental costs and QALYs between CMR (or FFR, 
Model 1) versus no CMR (stress echocardiography, Model 1 and standard 
echocardiography, Model 2) were small (CMR: -£64 (95% CI -£232 to £187)/FFR: 
£360 (95% CI -£116 to £844) and CMR/FFR: 0.0012 QALYs (95% CI -0.0076 to 
0.0093)) and (£98 (95% CI -£199 to £488) and 0.0005 QALYs (95% CI -0.0050 to 
0.0077)), respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of the tests was the key driver 
of cost-effectiveness for both patient groups.
CONCLUSIONS: If CMR were introduced for all subgroups of patients who activate 
the PPCI pathway, it is likely that diagnostic accuracy would be a key 
determinant of its cost-effectiveness. Further research is needed to 
definitively answer whether revascularisation guided by CMR or FFR leads to 
different clinical outcomes in acute coronary syndrome patients with multivessel 
disease.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic, systemic disease characterized by 
fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, vasculopathy, and auto-immune 
activation. On the top of severe organ involvement such as interstitial lung and 
myocardial fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and renal crisis, individuals 
diagnosed with SSc may suffer from a number of comorbidities. This is a 
narrative review according to published recommendations and we searched the 
online databases MEDLINE and EMBASE using as key words the following terms: 
systemic sclerosis, scleroderma, myocardial fibrosis in combination with micro- 
and macro-vascular disease, cardiac involvement, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular 
disease and coronary arteries, infections, cancer, depression, osteoporosis, and 
dyslipidemia. Although data are usually inconclusive it appears that 
comorbidities with significant impact on life expectancy, namely cardiovascular 
disease, infections, and cancer as well as phycological disorders affecting 
emotional and mental health are highly prevalent in SSc population. Thereafter, 
the aim of this review is to summarize the occurrence and the clinical 
significance of such comorbidities in SSc population and to discuss how 
rheumatologists can incorporate the management of these conditions in daily 
clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and 
impact of gene-expression assays (GEAs) on treatment decisions in a real-world 
setting of early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) patients.
METHODS: This is a regional, prospective study promoted by the Council Health 
Authorities in Madrid. Enrolment was offered to women with estrogen 
receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, 
node-negative or micrometastatic, stage I or II breast cancer from 21 hospitals 
in Madrid. Treatment recommendations were recorded before and after knowledge of 
tests results. An economic model compared the cost-effectiveness of treatment, 
guided by GEAs or by common prognostic factors.
RESULTS: 907 tests (440 Oncotype DX® and 467 MammaPrint®) were performed between 
February 2012 and November 2014. Treatment recommendation changed in 42.6% of 
patients. The shift was predominantly from chemohormonal (CHT) to hormonal 
therapy (HT) alone, in 30.5% of patients. GEAs increased patients' confidence in 
treatment decision making. Tumor grade, progesterone receptor positivity and 
Ki67 expression were associated with the likelihood of change from CHT to HT 
(P < 0.001) and from HT to CHT (P < 0.001). Compared with current clinical 
practice genomic testing increased quality-adjusted life years by 0.00787 per 
patient and was cost-saving from a national health care system (by 13.867€ per 
patient) and from a societal perspective (by 32.678€ per patient).
CONCLUSION: Using GEAs to guide adjuvant therapy in ESBC is cost-effective in 
Spain and has a significant impact on treatment decisions.

BACKGROUND: Patients with a renal transplant are an ever-increasing demographic. 
Their life expectancy is also on the rise and thus malignancies or tumors in 
these cases are more frequent. These patients are often on immunosuppressive 
drugs that are known to cause changes in the microvasculature, especially of the 
deep white matter. However, benign dural-based lesions are a rarity in these 
cases with very few (<5) ever being reported. Imaging findings in such cases are 
altered, which leads to an altered set of differential diagnosis.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a right parasagittal lesion in case of 
postrenal transplant with imaging findings suggestive of an inflammatory lesion. 
The lesion was excised and histopathology was that of a fibrous meningioma. 
Pathological basis of altered imaging is discussed and potential causes 
elaborated along with a thorough review of similar cases and their findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Renal transplants and long-term survival are now a reality; 
calcineurin inhibitors are a staple for these cases. The drugs alter imaging 
findings and hence cases need to be carefully evaluated with a host of 
differential diagnosis. Knowledge of these changes is now necessary for these 
new spectra of cases.
