Cushing's disease is a rare condition of chronic hypercortisolism caused by an 
adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma and associated with 
debilitating complications and excess mortality. Transsphenoidal adenomectomy is 
generally first-line treatment but is contraindicated in some patients and 
associated with significant post-surgical recurrence. While there are few data 
to support long-term use of most pharmacologic treatments, pasireotide (a 
multireceptor-targeted somatostatin analog) recently demonstrated sustained 
benefit in a 12-month, multicenter, Phase III trial and in 2 long-term extension 
studies. The Phase III trial (N=162) demonstrated reductions in urinary free 
cortisol in most patients, with durable treatment effect over 12 months. 
Biochemical improvement was generally paralleled by reductions in 
Cushing's-related signs and symptoms and enhanced health-related quality of 
life. Long-term treatment was evaluated in 58 patients who entered a planned 
12-month extension phase. Reductions in urinary free cortisol remained stable 
throughout the extension, with further improvements noted in clinical signs and 
symptoms. Similar results were reported in the smaller Phase II extension (N=18; 
median treatment duration, 9.7 months; range, 2 months-4.8 years). Case reports 
have recently emerged demonstrating sustained disease control for upto 7 years 
in some patients. Safety considerations for long-term medical treatment with 
pasireotide are generally similar to those for other somatostatin analogs, 
except for the incidence and severity of hyperglycemia. Most patients experience 
new or worsening hyperglycemia with pasireotide treatment. Expert 
recommendations for treatment of pasireotide-associated hyperglycemia have 
recently been published and new studies are planned to elucidate the optimal 
treatment approach for pasireotide-associated hyperglycemia.

Long-Term Outcomes of Simultaneous Skin and Bowel Flaps for Esophageal 
Reconstruction.

of China.

Esophageal reconstruction can be performed with skin or bowel flaps. The choice 
of flap remains controversial, as the long-term outcomes of skin flaps cannot 
always be assessed in patients with limited life expectancies due to advanced 
malignancy, unlike the pediatric and benign cases which have had esophageal 
reconstruction using bowel flaps. We report the long-term clinical and 
histopathological outcomes in a series of 45 cases repaired with combined skin 
and bowel flaps.Four patients developed symptomatic strictures after corrosive 
esophageal injuries were repaired with a combination of a tubed free radial 
forearm fasciocutaneous flap and a pedicled bowel flap. On average, 24 years had 
passed since uneventful initial esophageal reconstructions. Barium esophagograms 
were obtained in all cases and pathological examination was performed upon all 
surgical specimens.The cutaneous portions of the reconstructed esophagus 
exhibited a variety of findings on barium examination. Each of the 4 cases 
developed an esophagocutaneous fistula after revision; an average of 4 surgeries 
was required to close these fistulae. The inner surfaces of the portion of 
esophagus repaired with skin flaps showed extensive ulceration, polypoid 
lesions, and fibrosis. Pathology specimens from skin flaps showed extensive 
acute and chronic inflammation, microabscesses, fibrosis, and acanthosis, with 
depletion and degeneration of the pilosebaceous units. By contrast, adjacent 
parts of the esophagus repaired with bowel were widely patent with normal 
appearing mucosa.Our findings indicate that a bowel flap is durable with good 
tolerance to gastrointestinal content over long periods, whereas skin flaps 
often developed morphological changes and could not maintain long-term 
esophageal function without eventual stricture and dysphagia. We therefore 
recommend use of bowel flaps for esophageal reconstruction in patients with long 
life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of class III obesity (body mass index [BMI]≥40 kg/m2) 
has increased dramatically in several countries and currently affects 6% of 
adults in the US, with uncertain impact on the risks of illness and death. Using 
data from a large pooled study, we evaluated the risk of death, overall and due 
to a wide range of causes, and years of life expectancy lost associated with 
class III obesity.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a pooled analysis of 20 prospective studies from the 
United States, Sweden, and Australia, we estimated sex- and age-adjusted total 
and cause-specific mortality rates (deaths per 100,000 persons per year) and 
multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for adults, aged 19-83 y at baseline, 
classified as obese class III (BMI 40.0-59.9 kg/m2) compared with those 
classified as normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2). Participants reporting ever 
smoking cigarettes or a history of chronic disease (heart disease, cancer, 
stroke, or emphysema) on baseline questionnaires were excluded. Among 9,564 
class III obesity participants, mortality rates were 856.0 in men and 663.0 in 
women during the study period (1976-2009). Among 304,011 normal-weight 
participants, rates were 346.7 and 280.5 in men and women, respectively. Deaths 
from heart disease contributed largely to the excess rates in the class III 
obesity group (rate differences = 238.9 and 132.8 in men and women, 
respectively), followed by deaths from cancer (rate differences = 36.7 and 62.3 
in men and women, respectively) and diabetes (rate differences = 51.2 and 29.2 
in men and women, respectively). Within the class III obesity range, 
multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for total deaths and deaths due to heart 
disease, cancer, diabetes, nephritis/nephrotic syndrome/nephrosis, chronic lower 
respiratory disease, and influenza/pneumonia increased with increasing BMI. 
Compared with normal-weight BMI, a BMI of 40-44.9, 45-49.9, 50-54.9, and 55-59.9 
kg/m2 was associated with an estimated 6.5 (95% CI: 5.7-7.3), 8.9 (95% CI: 
7.4-10.4), 9.8 (95% CI: 7.4-12.2), and 13.7 (95% CI: 10.5-16.9) y of life lost. 
A limitation was that BMI was mainly ascertained by self-report.
CONCLUSIONS: Class III obesity is associated with substantially elevated rates 
of total mortality, with most of the excess deaths due to heart disease, cancer, 
and diabetes, and major reductions in life expectancy compared with normal 
weight. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.

BACKGROUND: Despite therapeutic hypothermia 30-70% of newborns with moderate or 
severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy will die or survive with significant 
long-term impairments. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the first days of 
life is being used for early identification of these infants and end of life 
decisions are relying more and more on it. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate how MRI performed around day 4 of life correlates with the ones 
obtained in the second week of life in infants with hypoxic-ischemic 
encephalopathy (HIE) treated with hypothermia.
METHODS: Prospective observational cohort study between April 2009 and July 
2011. Consecutive newborns with HIE evaluated for therapeutic hypothermia were 
included. Two sequential MR studies were performed: an 'early' study around the 
4th day of life and a 'late' study during the second week of life. MRI were 
assessed and scored by two neuroradiologists who were blinded to the clinical 
condition of the infants.
RESULTS: Forty-eight MRI scans were obtained in the 40 newborns. Fifteen infants 
underwent two sequential MR scans. The localization, extension and severity of 
hypoxic-ischemic injury in early and late scans were highly correlated. 
Hypoxic-ischemic injury scores from conventional sequences (T1/T2) in the early 
MRI correlated with the scores of the late MRI (Spearman ρ = 0.940; p < .001) as 
did the scores between diffusion-weighted images in early scans and conventional 
images in late MR studies (Spearman ρ = 0.866; p < .001). There were no 
significant differences in MR images between the two sequential scans.
CONCLUSIONS: MRI in the first days of life may be a useful prognostic tool for 
clinicians and can help parents and neonatologist in medical decisions, as it 
highly depicts hypoxic-ischemic brain injury seen in scans performed around the 
second week of life.

Unit, KU Leuven, Belgium. rene.westhovens@uz.kuleuven.ac.be.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) abatacept plus 
methotrexate (MTX) over 7 years, the longest observational period to date, in 
patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and an inadequate response 
to MTX.
METHODS: Patients randomised to IV abatacept (10 or 2 mg/kg) or placebo, plus 
MTX, during the 1-year double-blind (DB) period of a Phase 2b study could enter 
the long-term extension (LTE) and receive IV abatacept 10 mg/kg monthly. Safety 
was assessed in patients who received ≥1 dose of abatacept; efficacy was 
assessed in patients originally randomised to 10 mg/kg abatacept (as-observed 
data).
RESULTS: A total of 219 patients entered the LTE; 114 (52.1%) completed 7 years 
of treatment with abatacept plus MTX. Cumulative (DB + LTE) incidence rates of 
serious adverse events, serious infections, malignancies, and autoimmune events 
were 17.6, 3.2, 1.8, and 1.2/100 patient-years, respectively. Safety was 
consistent between the DB (n=220) and cumulative (n=287) periods. Improvements 
in American College of Rheumatology responses, disease activity, and 
normalisation of physical function and health-related quality of life were 
maintained over time. Approximately 80% of patients who achieved low disease 
activity or normalised modified Health Assessment Questionnaire scores at Year 
1, and who remained in the study, sustained these responses in each subsequent 
year.
CONCLUSIONS: IV abatacept in combination with MTX demonstrated consistent safety 
and sustained efficacy over 7 years in MTX inadequate responders with 
established RA. Furthermore, some patients demonstrated a normalisation of 
physical function and health-related quality of life that was sustained over 
time.

We studied the gender gap in life expectancy (GGLE), which currently favours 
women on average by 5 years. Individual data from 54 societies were extracted 
from the 1999-2004 wave of the World Values Survey. The GGLE was not predicted 
by the socio-economic factors of gross domestic product (GDP) or Gini 
coefficient, but was increased by national level of alcohol consumption, and 
decreased by gender differences in national levels of life satisfaction. 
Different national-level phenomena appear to be responsible for male and female 
contributions to the GGLE. National levels of male longevity were responsive to 
GDP, Gini coefficient, social engagement, tobacco use and life satisfaction, 
whereas female longevity rates were responsive only to GDP and alcohol 
consumption, underscoring the greater sensitivity of male longevity to 
contextual features of the nations where they live.

Protein kinases are regulated by a large number of mechanisms that vary from one 
kinase to another. However, a fundamental activation mechanism shared by all 
protein kinases is phosphorylation of a conserved activation loop threonine 
residue. This is achieved in many cases via autophosphorylation. The mechanism 
and structural basis for autophosphorylation are not clear and are in fact 
enigmatic because this phosphorylation occurs when the kinase is in its inactive 
conformation. Unlike most protein kinases, MAP kinases are not commonly 
activated by autophosphorylation but rather by MEK-dependent phosphorylation. 
Here we show that p38β, a p38 isoform that is almost identical to p38α, is 
exceptional and spontaneously autoactivates by autophosphorylation. We 
identified a 13-residue-long region composed of part of the αG-helix and the 
MAPK insert that triggers the intrinsic autophosphorylation activity of p38β. 
When inserted into p38α, this fragment renders it spontaneously active in vitro 
and in mammalian cells. We further found that an interaction between the N 
terminus and a particular region of the C-terminal extension suppresses the 
intrinsic autophosphorylation of p38β in mammalian cells. Thus, this study 
identified the structural motif responsible for the unique autophosphorylation 
capability of p38β and the motif inhibiting this activity in living cells. It 
shows that the MAPK insert and C-terminal extension, structural motifs that are 
unique to MAPKs, play a critical role in controlling autophosphorylation.

Hemophilias are the most known inherited bleeding disorders. The challenges in 
the management of hemophilic children are different from those in adults: 
prophylaxis regimen removed the hallmark of crippling disease with lifelong 
disabilities; individualized regimens are being implemented in order to overcome 
venous access problems. Presently, at least in high-income countries, advances 
in treatment of hemophilia resulted in continuous improvement of the patients' 
quality of life and life expectancy. Inhibitors remain the most severe 
complication of hemophilia therapy. The treatment' compliance is the key to 
achieve a successful management. The patient, his family, the medical and 
psychological team are the players of a comprehensive care system. The current 
management of hemophilic children is the example of huge resource investments 
enabling long-term benefits in particular quality of life as a primary objective 
of the healthcare process.

OBJECTIVE: The Helping Babies Breathe" (HBB) program is an evidence-based 
curriculum in basic neonatal care and resuscitation, utilizing simulation-based 
training to educate large numbers of birth attendants in low-resource countries. 
We analyzed its cost-effectiveness at a faith-based Haydom Lutheran Hospital 
(HLH) in rural Tanzania.
METHODS: Data about early neonatal mortality and fresh stillbirth rates were 
drawn from a linked observational study during one year before and one year 
after full implementation of the HBB program. Cost data were provided by the 
Tanzanian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW), the research department 
at HLH, and the manufacturer of the training material Lærdal Global Health.
FINDINGS: Costs per life saved were USD 233, while they were USD 4.21 per life 
year gained. Costs for maintaining the program were USD 80 per life saved and 
USD 1.44 per life year gained. Costs per disease adjusted life year (DALY) 
averted ranged from International Dollars (ID; a virtual valuta corrected for 
purchasing power world-wide) 12 to 23, according to how DALYs were calculated.
CONCLUSION: The HBB program is a low-cost intervention. Implementation in a very 
rural faith-based hospital like HLH has been highly cost-effective. To 
facilitate further global implementation of HBB a cost-effectiveness analysis 
including government owned institutions, urban hospitals and district facilities 
is desirable for a more diverse analysis to explore cost-driving factors and 
predictors of enhanced cost-effectiveness.

This study aimed to develop and validate a de novo food frequency questionnaire 
for self-defined vegans in the United States. Diet histories from pilot samples 
of vegans and a modified 'Block Method' using seven selected nutrients of 
concern in vegan diet patterns, were employed to generate the questionnaire food 
list. Food frequency responses of 100 vegans from 19 different U.S. states were 
obtained via completed mailed questionnaires and compared to multiple 
telephone-conducted diet recall interviews. Computerized diet analyses were 
performed. Correlation coefficients, t-tests, rank, cross-tabulations, and 
probability tests were used to validate and compare intake estimates and dietary 
reference intake (DRI) assessment trends between the two methods. A 369-item 
vegan-specific questionnaire was developed with 252 listed food frequency items. 
Calorie-adjusted correlation coefficients ranged from r = 0.374 to 0.600 (p < 
0.001) for all analyzed nutrients except calcium. Estimates, ranks, trends and 
higher-level participant percentile placements for Vitamin B12 were similar with 
both methods. Questionnaire intakes were higher than recalls for most other 
nutrients. Both methods demonstrated similar trends in DRI adequacy assessment 
(e.g., significantly inadequate vitamin D intake among vegans). This 
vegan-specific questionnaire can be a useful assessment tool for health 
screening initiatives in U.S. vegan communities.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Some, smaller studies have investigated the effect of 
preoperative depression on postoperative improvement in quality of life (QOL). 
However, they have not used the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) in 
self-reported depression.
PURPOSE: To assess the effect of preoperative depression as measured by the 
PHQ-9 on postoperative improvement in QOL.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review at a single tertiary-care referral center.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients who underwent lumbar decompression or fusion between 
2008 and 2012.
OUTCOMES MEASURES: A self-reported EuroQol five-dimensions (EQ-5D) 
quality-adjusted life-years Index.
METHODS: Quality of life data were collected using the institutional 
prospectively collected database of patient-reported health status measures. The 
EQ-5D questionnare, PDQ, and PHQ-9 were used. Linear and logistic regression 
analyses were performed to assess the impact of preoperative depression on QOL 
improvement.
RESULTS: Elevated preoperative pain (PDQ, β=-0.0017, p=.0009) and worsened 
depression (PHQ-9, β=-0.0044, p=.0359) were significantly associated with 
diminished postoperative improvement in QOL, as measured by the EQ-5D. 
Furthermore, greater depression (PHQ-9, odds ratio [OR] 0.93, p<.0001) and pain 
(PDQ, OR 0.99, p=.02) were associated with significantly diminished 
postoperative improvement exceeding the minimum clinically important difference.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased preoperative pain and depression were shown to be 
associated with significantly reduced improvement in postoperative QOL, as 
measured by the EQ-5D.

BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) is an autoimmune disease with chronic 
complications that is becoming more frequent as life expectancy of diabetics has 
increased owing to improved methods of detection and better management. In this 
study, we investigated whether the presence of autoimmunity can be used in 
predicting the development time of microvascular complications.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study included 52 patients with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus (DM). The subjects had developed microvascular complications and they 
had been tested for anti-GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) antibodies and/or 
islet-cell antibodies (ICA). In the assessment of microvascular complications, 
we used ocular fundus examination, electromyography (EMG), and 24-h urine 
microalbuminuria tests.
RESULTS: Of the patients included in the study, 30 were female and 22 were male. 
Of all patients characterized for the existence of diabetic complications, 36 of 
52 had both diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy, 5 patients had 
diabetic neuropathy, and 11 patients had diabetic retinopathy only. At the 
diagnosis of diabetes, 20 in 52 patients tested negative for autoantibodies 
(anti-GAD and anti-ICA), while 32 of 52 tested positive for anti-GAD and/or 
anti-ICA. The mean HbA1C level of autoantibody-negative patients was 7.7%, while 
antibody-positive patients had slightly higher HbA1c levels (7.9%). However, 
this difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05). The mean development 
time of microvascular complications in autoantibody-positive patients was 
calculated as 11: 40±6.46 years, and in patients with negative autoimmunity 
results it was 10.91±6.70 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of diabetes-related autoantibodies (DRAs) in patients 
with type 1 diabetes mellitus does not have a significant effect on the 
development time of diabetic microvascular complications.

middle-income regions: a systematic analysis from the Global Burden of Disease 
2010 Study.

BACKGROUND: Injuries accounted for 11 % of the global burden of disease in 2010. 
This study aimed to quantify the burden of injury in low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs) that could be averted if basic surgical services were made 
available and accessible to the entire population.
METHODS: We examined all causes of injury from the Global Burden of Disease 2010 
Study. We split the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for these conditions 
between surgically "avertable" and "nonavertable" burdens. For estimating the 
avertable fatal burden, we applied the lowest fatality rates among the 21 
epidemiologic regions to each LMIC region, assuming that the differences in 
death rates between each region and the lowest rates reflect the gap in surgical 
care. We adjusted for fatal cases that occur prior to reaching hospitals as they 
are not surgically avertable. Similarly, we applied the lowest nonfatal burden 
per case to each LMIC region.
RESULTS: Overall, 21 % of the injury burden in LMICs was potentially avertable 
by basic surgical care (52.3 million DALYs). The avertable proportion was 
greater for deaths than for nonfatal burden (23 vs. 20 %), suggesting that 
surgical services for injuries more effectively save lives than ameliorate 
disability. Sub-Saharan Africa had the largest proportion of potentially 
avertable burden (25 %). South Asia had the highest total avertable DALYs (17.4 
million). Road injury comprised the largest total avertable burden in LMICs 
(16.1 million DALYs).
CONCLUSIONS: Basic surgical care has the potential to play a major role in 
reducing the injury-related burden in LMICs.

BACKGROUND: Recalled St. Jude Medical Riata defibrillator leads are prone to 
insulation failures with externalized conductors (ECs). Longitudinal studies are 
needed to guide lead management.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the dynamic nature of EC 
and the association with electrical abnormalities and lead extraction outcomes.
METHODS: A nationwide cohort established in 2012 of 295 patients with recalled 
Riata leads with dwell time 5.1 ± 1.1 years, 34 ECs, and 19 electrical 
abnormalities were followed until death, lead discontinuation with fluoroscopy, 
or a new 2013 screening with fluoroscopy and device interrogation.
RESULTS: Fluoroscopic follow-up of 239 patients with normal baseline fluoroscopy 
revealed incident overt EC in 8 leads and borderline EC in 2 leads after 1.1 ± 
0.2 years, with an incidence rate of 3.7 per 100 person-years (95% confidence 
interval 2.0-6.9). Fluoroscopic follow-up in 27 patients with baseline EC showed 
an increase in EC length of 4 ± 1 mm (P <.001) after 1.1 ± 0.3 years. Electrical 
follow-up in 276 patients with normal baseline electrical function demonstrated 
20 incident electrical abnormalities after 1.0 ± 0.3 years, with an incidence 
rate of 7.1 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval 4.6-11.0). This rate 
was significantly higher in leads with baseline EC, with an adjusted incidence 
rate ratio of 4.4 (95% confidence interval 1.7-11.5, P = .002). In 15 
extractions, all leads were removed, with 2 major complications.
CONCLUSION: The development of EC is a dynamic process despite long lead dwell 
time. ECs are associated with a higher risk of electrical abnormalities. 
Therefore, lead replacement should be considered, especially in patients with a 
long life expectancy.

Wingless-related proteins (WNTs) regulate extension of the central axis of the 
vertebrate embryo (convergent extension) as well as morphogenesis of organs such 
as limbs and kidneys. Here, we asked whether WNT signaling directs facial 
morphogenesis using a targeted approach in chicken embryos. WNT11 is thought to 
mainly act via β-catenin-independent pathways, and little is known about its 
role in craniofacial development. RCAS::WNT11 retrovirus was injected into the 
maxillary prominence, and the majority of embryos developed notches in the upper 
beak or the equivalent of cleft lip. Three-dimensional morphometric analysis 
revealed that WNT11 prevented lengthening of the maxillary prominence, which was 
due in part to decreased proliferation. We next determined, using a series of 
luciferase reporters, that WNT11 strongly induced JNK/planar cell polarity 
signaling while repressing the β-catenin-mediated pathway. The activation of the 
JNK-ATF2 reporter was mediated by the DEP domain of Dishevelled. The impacts of 
altered signaling on the mesenchyme were assessed by implanted Wnt11- or 
Wnt3a-expressing cells (activates β-catenin pathway) into the maxillary 
prominence or by knocking down endogenous WNT11 with RNAi. Host cells were 
attracted to Wnt11 donor cells. In contrast, cells exposed to Wnt3a or the 
control cells did not migrate. Cells in which endogenous WNT11 was knocked down 
were more oriented and shorter than those exposed to exogenous WNT11. The data 
suggest that JNK/planar cell polarity WNT signaling operates in the face to 
regulate several morphogenetic events leading to lip fusion.

Progressive advancements in the fields of medicine, oncology and palliative care 
have seen significant gains in the life expectancy but have also resulted in 
patients living longer with the burdens of cancer. It is within the sphere of 
end-of-life care that the role of palliative rehabilitation comes into its own 
in addressing the effects of increased physical and psychological morbidity that 
accompany many of these prognostic gains. Focusing on the cancer journey, we 
highlight the impact of rehabilitative measures on efforts to preserve the 
personhood of a patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and thus maintain 
her dignity and quality of life and provide her with appropriate and effective 
holistic care at the end of life. Through employing the Ring Theory of 
Personhood, the critical role of the complementary aspects of palliative 
rehabilitation in end-of-life care is brought to the fore.

There has been evidence that subjective quality of life in patients with 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is comparatively good, unrelated to the 
state of physical functioning, so called 'disability paradox'. Other studies 
show weak to moderate correlations between disease severity and emotional 
well-being. Our aim was to analyse the impact of physical impairment on 
emotional well-being when assessed disease-specifically and seen through the 
patient's eyes with additional clinical evaluation. In 121 patients emotional 
functioning was evaluated by the ALS Assessment Questionnaire (ALSAQ-40). 
Physical status was assessed by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Extension 
(ALSFRS-EX) and Borg dyspnoea scales and by clinical examination (muscle 
strength and pulmonary function). Multiple regression and correlation analyses 
were performed. Results showed that physical impairment and progression rate of 
physical deterioration had a significant impact and explained some variance in 
emotional well-being (adjusted R(2) = 0.22). Pulmonary function and the sense of 
dyspnoea correlated significantly on a weak to moderate level with emotional 
well-being. In conclusion, disease-specific patient- reported outcome 
measurement instruments revealed a moderate but distinct impact of physical 
impairment on emotional well-being. This study challenges the 'disability 
paradox' and has relevant findings that can support the timely delivery of care 
for ALS patients.

The lead time tradeoff: the case of health states better than dead.

Pinto-Prades JL(1), Rodríguez-Míguez E(2).

Author information:
(1)Glasgow Caledonian University, Newton Mearns, UK (JLPP)
(2)University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain (EMRM).

BACKGROUND: Lead time tradeoff (L-TTO) is a variant of the time tradeoff (TTO). 
L-TTO introduces a lead period in full health before illness onset, avoiding the 
need to use 2 different procedures for states better and worse than dead. To 
estimate utilities, additive separability is assumed. We tested to what extent 
violations of this assumption can bias utilities estimated with L-TTO.
METHODS: A sample of 500 members of the Spanish general population evaluated 24 
health states, using face-to-face interviews. A total of 188 subjects were 
interviewed with L-TTO and the rest with TTO. Both samples evaluated the same 
set of 24 health states, divided into 4 groups with 6 health states per set. 
Each subject evaluated 1 of the sets. A random effects regression model was 
fitted to our data. Only health states better than dead were included in the 
regression since it is in this subset where additive separability can be tested 
clearly.
RESULTS: Utilities were higher in L-TTO in relation to TTO (on average L-TTO 
adds about 0.2 points to the utility of health states), suggesting that additive 
separability is violated. The difference between methods increased with the 
severity of the health state. Thus, L-TTO adds about 0.14 points to the average 
utility of the less severe states, 0.23 to the intermediate states, and 0.28 
points to the more severe estates.
CONCLUSIONS: L-TTO produced higher utilities than TTO. Health problems are 
perceived as less severe if a lead period in full health is added upfront, 
implying that there are interactions between disjointed time periods. The 
advantages of this method have to be compared with the cost of modeling the 
interaction between periods.

739. Challenges and Successes in Reducing Health Disparities: Workshop Summary.

Institute of Medicine (US) Roundtable on Health Disparities.

Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2008.

In early 2007, the Institute of Medicine convened the Roundtable on Health 
Disparities to increase the visibility of racial and ethnic health disparities 
as a national problem, to further the development of programs and strategies to 
reduce disparities, to foster the emergence of leadership on this issue, and to 
track promising activities and developments in health care that could lead to 
dramatically reducing or eliminating disparities. The Roundtable’s first 
workshop, Challenges and Successes in Reducing Health Disparities, was held in 
St. Louis, Missouri, on July 31, 2007, and examined (1) the importance of 
differences in life expectancy within the United States, (2) the reasons for 
those differences, and (3) the implications of this information for programs and 
policy makers.

740. Estimating Mortality Risk Reduction and Economic Benefits from Controlling
Ozone  Air Pollution.

National Research Council (US) Committee on Estimating Mortality Risk Reduction 
Benefits from Decreasing Tropospheric Ozone Exposure.

Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2008.

In light of recent evidence on the relationship of ozone to mortality and 
questions about its implications for benefit analysis, the Environmental 
Protection Agency asked the National Research Council to establish a committee 
of experts to evaluate independently the contributions of recent epidemiologic 
studies to understanding the size of the ozone-mortality effect in the context 
of benefit analysis. The committee was also asked to assess methods for 
estimating how much a reduction in short-term exposure to ozone would reduce 
premature deaths, to assess methods for estimating associated increases in life 
expectancy, and to assess methods for estimating the monetary value of the 
reduced risk of premature death and increased life expectancy in the context of 
health-benefits analysis. Estimating Mortality Risk Reduction and Economic 
Benefits from Controlling Ozone Air Pollution details the committee’s findings 
and posits several recommendations to address these issues.

FOXFIRE protocol: an open-label, randomised, phase III trial of 5-fluorouracil, 
oxaliplatin and folinic acid (OxMdG) with or without interventional Selective 
Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) as first-line treatment for patients with 
unresectable liver-only or liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common malignancy in 
Europe and a leading cause of cancer-related death. Almost 50% of patients with 
CRC develop liver metastases, which heralds a poor prognosis unless metastases 
can be downsized to surgical resection or ablation. The FOXFIRE trial examines 
the hypothesis that combining radiosensitising chemotherapy (OxMdG: oxaliplatin, 
5-fluorouracil and folic acid) with Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT 
or radioembolisation) using yttrium-90 resin microspheres (SIR-Spheres®; Sirtex 
Medical Limited, North Sydney, Australia) as a first-line treatment for 
liver-dominant metastatic CRC will improve clinical outcomes when compared to 
OxMdG chemotherapy alone.
METHODS/DESIGN: FOXFIRE is an open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled 
trial of OxMdG with or without the addition of SIRT (1:1 randomisation). 
Eligible adult patients have histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma, 
liver metastases measurable on computed tomography scan and untreatable by 
either surgical resection or local ablation, and they may have limited 
extra-hepatic disease, defined as ≤5 nodules in the lung and/or one other 
metastatic site which is amenable to future definitive treatment. Eligible 
patients may have received adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of the 
primary tumour, but are not permitted to have previously received chemotherapy 
for metastatic disease, and must have a life expectancy of ≥3 months and a WHO 
performance status of 0-1. The primary outcome is overall survival. Secondary 
outcomes include progression free survival (PFS), liver-specific PFS, 
patient-reported outcomes, safety, response rate, resection rate and 
cost-effectiveness. FOXFIRE shares a combined statistical analysis plan with an 
international sister trial called SIRFLOX.
DISCUSSION: This trial is establishing a network of SIRT centres and 'feeder' 
chemotherapy-only centres to standardise the delivery of SIRT across the whole 
of the UK and to provide greater equity of access to this highly specialised 
liver-directed therapy. The FOXFIRE trial will establish the potential role of 
adding SIRT to first-line chemotherapy for unresectable liver metastatic 
colorectal cancer, and the impact on current treatment paradigms for metastatic 
CRC.

Indigenous Australians experience profound levels of disadvantage in health, 
living standards, life expectancy, education and employment, particularly in 
comparison with non-Indigenous Australians. Very little information is available 
about the healthy development of Australian Indigenous children; the 
Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children (LSIC) is designed to fill this 
knowledge gap.This dataset provides an opportunity to follow the development of 
up to 1759 Indigenous children. LSIC conducts annual face-to-face interviews 
with children (aged 0.5-2 and 3.5-5 years at baseline in 2008) and their 
caregivers. This represents between 5% and 10% of the total population of 
Indigenous children in these age groups, including families of varied
