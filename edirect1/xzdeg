Solar radiation (SR) is essential for yield improvement in lentil, which is a 
crop of marginal environments. Herein, experiments were conducted over 2 years 
under a semi-arid environment to study the radiation interception (RI), 
efficiency, growth, and development of three lentil genotypes (Punjab 
Masoor-2009 (PM-2009), NIAB Masoor-2006 (NM-2006), and NIAB Masoor-2002 
(NM-2002)) in relation to three nitrogen rates (13, 19, and 25 kg ha-1). 
Seasonal dynamics of intercepted photoactive radiation (IPAR) and cumulated 
photosynthetic photon flux density were highly associated with seasonal dynamics 
of leaf area index (LAI), with a high value of R2 (0.93 and 0.89) across all 
nitrogen rates and genotypes in both years. Nitrogen application promoted 
growth, and maximum LAI (3.97 and 3.57) and RI (324 and 301 MJ m-2) were 
attained for the first and second years of study, respectively. Biomass and 
yield were positively associated with IPAR. Variation in radiation absorption 
(RA) among genotypes was due to different patterns of LAI development. In both 
years, yield (23% and 25%) and radiation use efficiency (RUE) for grain yield 
(0.44 and 0.37 g MJ-1) were respectively higher for PM-2009 than for the other 
genotypes. Genotype PM-2009 had 15 days shorter crop cycle than others while 14% 
higher GDDs accumulated in the first year compared with the second due to the 
higher temperature. High nitrogen (25 kg ha-1) application resulted in higher 
dry matter (DM), and grain yield (GY), while RUE and PAR were not statistically 
different under 19 kg N ha-1 application across years. Genotypes PM-2009 and 
NM-2006 may perform reasonably well under arid to semi-arid regions at farmer 
field. These findings may assist researchers and crop modelers to optimize the 
lentil ideotype for efficient light utilization.

Research Center, Seoul, Korea. yhkhang@snu.ac.kr.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to calculate life expectancy in the areas around 
614 subway stations on 23 subway lines in the Seoul metropolitan area of Korea 
from 2008 to 2017.
METHODS: We used the National Health Information Database provided by the 
National Health Insurance Service, which covers the whole population of Korea. 
The analysis was conducted on the level of the smallest administrative units 
within a 200-m radius of each subway station. Life expectancy was calculated by 
constructing an abridged life table using the number of population and deaths in 
each area and 5-year age groups (0, 1-4, …, 85+) during the whole study period.
RESULTS: The median life expectancy in the areas around 614 subway stations was 
82.9 years (interquartile range, 2.2 years; minimum, 77.6 years; maximum, 87.4 
years). The life expectancy of areas around subway stations located in Seoul was 
higher than those in Incheon and Gyeonggi-do, but variation within the region 
was observed. Significant differences were observed between some adjacent subway 
stations. In Incheon and Gyeonggi-do, substantially higher life expectancy was 
found around subway stations in newly developed urban areas, and lower life 
expectancy was found in central Incheon and suburbs in Gyeonggi-do.
CONCLUSION: When using areas around subway stations as the unit of analysis, 
variation in life expectancy in the Seoul metropolitan area was observed. This 
approach may reduce the stigma associated with presenting health inequalities at 
the level of the smallest administrative units and foster public awareness of 
health inequalities.

PURPOSE: To assess the impact of EQ-5D country-specific value sets on 
cost-utility outcomes.
METHODS: Data from 2 randomized controlled trials on low back pain (LBP) and 
depression were used. 3L value sets were identified from the EuroQol Web site. A 
nonparametric crosswalk was employed for each tariff to obtain the likely 5L 
values. Differences in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between countries 
were tested using paired t tests, with United Kingdom as reference. Cost-utility 
outcomes were estimated for both studies and both EQ-5D versions, including 
differences in QALYs and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: For the 3L, QALYs ranged between 0.650 (Taiwan) and 0.892 (United 
States) in the LBP study and between 0.619 (Taiwan) and 0.879 (United States) in 
the depression study. In both studies, most country-specific QALY estimates 
differed statistically significantly from that of the United Kingdom. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged between &OV0556;2044/QALY (Taiwan) 
and &OV0556;5897/QALY (Zimbabwe) in the LBP study and between 
&OV0556;38,287/QALY (Singapore) and &OV0556;96,550/QALY (Japan) in the 
depression study. At the NICE threshold of &OV0556;23,300/QALY (≈£20,000/QALY), 
the intervention's probability of being cost-effective versus control ranged 
between 0.751 (Zimbabwe) and 0.952 (Taiwan) and between 0.230 (Canada) and 0.396 
(Singapore) in the LBP study and depression study, respectively. Similar results 
were found for the 5L, with extensive differences in ICERs and moderate 
differences in the probability of cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the use of different EQ-5D 
country-specific value sets impacts on cost-utility outcomes. Therefore, to 
account for the fact that health state preferences are affected by sociocultural 
differences, relevant country-specific value sets should be used.

Associative learning enables animals to predict rewards or punishments by their 
associations with predictive stimuli, while non-associative learning occurs 
without reinforcement. The latter includes latent inhibition (LI), whereby 
animals learn to ignore an inconsequential 'familiar' stimulus. Individual honey 
bees display heritable differences in expression of LI. We examined the 
behavioral and neuronal responses between honey bee genetic lines exhibiting 
high and low LI. We observed, as in previous studies, that high LI lines learned 
a familiar odor more slowly than low LI bees. By measuring gustatory responses 
to sucrose, we determined that perception of sucrose reward was similar between 
both lines, thereby not contributing to the LI phenotype. We then used 
extracellular electrophysiology to determine differences in neural responses of 
the antennal lobe (AL) to familiar and novel odors between the lines. Low LI 
bees responded significantly more strongly to both familiar and novel odors than 
the high LI bees, but the lines showed equivalent differences in response to the 
novel and familiar odors. This work suggests that some effects of genotype are 
present in early olfactory processing, and those effects could complement how LI 
is manifested at later stages of processing in brains of bees in the different 
lines.

Cost-Effectiveness of Interventions for Musculoskeletal Foot and Ankle 
Conditions: A Systematic Review.

OBJECTIVE: Musculoskeletal conditions of the foot and ankle are common, yet the 
cost-effectiveness of the variety of treatments available is not well defined. 
The aim of this systematic review was therefore to identify, appraise, and 
synthesize the literature pertaining to the cost-effectiveness of interventions 
for musculoskeletal foot and ankle conditions.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for studies presenting economic 
evaluations of nonsurgical and surgical treatments for acute or chronic 
musculoskeletal conditions of the foot and ankle. Data on cost, incremental 
cost-effectiveness, and quality-adjusted life years for each intervention and 
comparison were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed using the Drummond 
checklist for economic studies (range 0-35).
RESULTS: Thirty-six studies were identified reporting nonsurgical interventions 
(n = 10), nonsurgical versus surgical interventions (n = 14), and surgical 
interventions (n = 12). The most common conditions were osteoarthritis, ankle 
fracture, and Achilles tendon rupture. The strongest economic evaluations were 
for interventions managing end-stage ankle osteoarthritis, ankle sprain, ankle 
fracture, calcaneal fracture, and Achilles tendon rupture. Total ankle 
replacement and ankle arthrodesis for end-stage ankle osteoarthritis, in 
particular, have been demonstrated through high-quality studies to be 
cost-effective compared to the nonsurgical alternative.
CONCLUSION: Selected interventions for musculoskeletal foot and ankle conditions 
dominate comparators, whereas others require thoughtful consideration as they 
provide better clinical improvements, but at an increased cost. Researchers 
should consider measuring and reporting costs alongside clinical outcome to 
provide context when determining the appropriateness of interventions for other 
foot and ankle symptoms to best inform future clinical practice guidelines.

BACKGROUND:  Patients who undergo total esophagectomy and gastrectomy present a 
challenging scenario for reconstructive surgeons. Several techniques have been 
described. However, the best choice is still a matter of debate. We aim to 
report our experience with the supercharged ileocolic flap, then to compare the 
long-term functional outcomes in cancer and caustic injury patients. We 
investigate the safest route of transposition and demonstrate the importance of 
supercharging the flap. Last, we perform a literature review to compare our 
results with the ones reported in the literature.
METHODS:  A total of 36 patients underwent the supercharged ileocolic flap 
procedure. The details reviewed included the type of defect, flap 
characteristic, route of transposition, complications, patient survival, and 
swallowing evaluation. Survival and long-term function preservation were 
considered as the main outcomes. A secondary end-point was the identification of 
the safest route of transposition. We extracted the pertinent literature on 
supercharged bowel flaps from 1995 to July 2020 RESULTS:  All flaps survived; 
only two flaps were partially lost. Thirty-three percent of the cohort 
experienced postoperative complications; the most common was leakage of the 
cervical anastomosis (17%), followed by neck wound infection (8%). The 5-year 
dysphagia-free survival rate was 87% in corrosive injury patients and 78% in 
cancer patients. The mean time to be free from dysphagia after surgery was 
25.12 ± 4.55 months for corrosive patients and 39.56 ± 9.45 months for cancer 
patients (p = 0.118). The safest route of transposition was retrosternal 
extra-mediastinal. From the literature review, the data from 11 studies were 
extracted.
CONCLUSION:  The supercharged ileocolic flap is a robust option for total 
esophageal replacement when the stomach is not available and the retrosternal 
route is the safest for transposition. The functional outcomes are excellent, 
with acceptable morbidity and a good life expectancy, either in cancer and 
noncancer patients. Supercharging the flap is recommended.

Introduction: The available literature lacks data regarding the levels of 
resistin, lysozyme, lactoferrin, α-amylase activity, pH, and saliva buffer 
capacity, as well as oral health and hygiene in the group of adult patients with 
cystic fibrosis (CF). The aim of the research was to assess the selected saliva 
parameters in patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. Materials and methods: 
Examined group was composed of 40 patients diagnosed with CF, while the control 
group of 40 healthy individuals. Both groups underwent the same scheme of the 
assessment (DMT index, salivary pH, buffer capacity, analysis of total sialic 
acid, total protein estimation, lysozyme levels estimation, lactofferin levels 
measurement, α-amylase activity, estimation of the levels of resistin and 
TNF-α). Results: In the examined group, there were higher values of decayed 
teeth as well as values of sialic acid, total protein, lactoferrin, α-amylase, 
and TNF-α. However, mean lysozyme, and resistin levels, as well as pH and buffer 
capacity of the saliva, were lower. Conclusions: New diagnostic methods, 
including the evaluation of selected salivary biochemical parameters, may 
indicate the existence of factors predisposing to severe tooth decay in the 
study group. Appropriate preventive treatment to combat dental caries in adult 
patients with CF will significantly improve their comfort and life expectancy.

Cutaneous basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of human tumor, and 
its incidence rate is increasing worldwide. Up until a few years ago, 
therapeutic options have been limited for patients with advanced BCC (including 
metastatic and locally-advanced BCC). Over the last few years, promising 
systemic therapies have been investigated for the treatment of advanced BCC. In 
particular, the Hedgehog signaling inhibition has shown remarkable results for 
this population. Hedgehog inhibitors, represented by vismodegib and sonidegib, 
have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the European 
Medicines Agency for the treatment of both locally advanced and metastatic BCC, 
with, generally, a good safety profile. Notwithstanding the late onset of BCC in 
the global population, associated with life expectancy increase, only a few 
clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety profile of Hedgehog 
inhibitors in this complex and neglected population. Herein, we review the major 
mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of BCC focusing on the Hedgehog 
signaling pathway and its therapeutic role in the elderly population. Finally, 
we report two case reports of BCC elderly patients in order to demonstrate both 
efficacy and safety of the Hedgehog inhibitors.

Aging is a complicated biological process in which functional and structural 
alterations in a living organism take place over time. Reactive oxygen species 
is one of the main factors responsible for aging and is associated with several 
chronic pathologies. The relationship between aging and diet is quite 
interesting and has attained worldwide attention. Healthy food, in addition to 
dietary antioxidants, are required to delay the process of aging and improve the 
quality of life. Many healthy foods such as fruits are a good source of dietary 
nutrients and natural bioactive compounds which have antioxidant properties and 
are involved in preventing aging and other age-related disorders. Health 
benefits linked with healthy consumption of fruit have drawn increased interest. 
A significant number of studies have documented the advantages of fruit intake, 
as it suppresses free-radical development that further reduces the oxidative 
stress created in the body and protects against several types of diseases such 
as cancer, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory disorders, and other cardiovascular 
diseases that ultimately prevent aging. In addition, fruits have numerous other 
properties like anti-inflammatory, anti-cancerous, anti-diabetic, 
neuroprotective, and have health-promoting effects. Mechanisms of various 
bioactive compounds that aids in preventing various diseases and increases 
longevity are also described. This manuscript provides a summary of various 
bioactive components present in fruits along with their health-promoting and 
antiaging properties.

PURPOSE: The shorter life expectancy and increased risk of suicide in patients 
with schizophrenia have been well documented. However, study outcomes on 
suicidality in this special population have been few to date. This study 
investigated the prevalence and factors associated with suicidal ideation in a 
population of institutionalized patients with schizophrenia.
METHODS: Two hundred fifty-six patients with schizophrenia between the age of 18 
and 65 years were randomly recruited. This cross-sectional study utilised the 
Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), the Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS-AH). 
Univariate analysis was performed using an independent t-test or chi-square 
test, followed by binary logistic regression to determine the factors associated 
with increased suicidal risks.
RESULTS: The socio-demographic factors associated with suicidal ideation 
included level of education (p=0.039); secondary-level education (OR=5.76, 95% 
CI:1.49, 22.34, p=0.011) and tertiary-level education (OR=9.30, 95% CI: 1.80, 
48.12, p=0.008) posed a greater risk. A history of attempted suicide (OR=2.09, 
95% CI: 1.01, 4.36, p=0.049) and the presence of co-morbid physical illnesses 
(OR=2.07, 95% CI: 1.02, 4.21, p=0.044) were also found to be associated with a 
suicidal ideation. Other significant factors associated with suicidal thoughts 
were concurrent depression (OR=9.68, 95% CI: 3.74, 25.05, p<0.001) and a higher 
PSYRATS score in emotional characteristics of auditory hallucinations (OR=1.13, 
95% CI: 1.06, 1.21, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Suicide in schizophrenia appears to be more closely associated with 
certain socio-demographic factors and affective symptoms. Appropriate screening 
and treatment addressing these challenges must be emphasized if suicidal 
thoughts and actions are to be reduced.

The "Trojan Horse" scandal laid bare an anxiety at the heart of the British 
security establishment; an anxiety that brings together questions of identity, 
values, and security within the demand to manage radicalization. It is an 
anxiety that, I will argue, reveals a novel conceptualization of threat that has 
driven the UK's security and communities policies within the "war on terror." 
This conceptualization emerges within Prevent, the UK's counter-radicalization 
strategy. Yet, I argue, the extensive literature on Prevent has failed to 
adequately articulate this underlying, core logic. To date, the Prevent 
literature has effectively demonstrated the ways in which Muslim communities in 
the United Kingdom have been policed through British counter-radicalization 
policy. Yet, this analysis struggles to explain the expansion of Prevent into a 
wider range of "extremist" spaces. In this article, I contend that it is more 
useful to situate Prevent as a particular conception of power; a logic and an 
analysis of threat that demands new forms of government intervention. To do so, 
this article provides a genealogical reading of Prevent, locating it as a 
radical extension of state security ambitions to intervene early, making 
explicit a vision of security in which life as a process of becoming is produced 
as an object of management. The paper draws out the ramifications of this 
analysis to think through fundamental shifts in the principles and practices of 
contemporary security aspirations.

Insect growth and development are precisely controlled by hormone homeostasis. 
The prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) receptor, Torso, is a member of the 
receptor tyrosine kinase family in insects. Activation of Torso by PTTH triggers 
biosynthesis and release of the steroid hormone in the prothoracic gland (PG). 
Although numbers of genes functioning in steroid hormone synthesis and 
metabolism have been identified in insects, the PTTH transduction pathway via 
its receptor Torso is poorly understood. In the current study, we describe a 
loss-of-function analysis of Torso in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, by targeted 
gene disruption using the transgenic CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeats/RNA-guided Cas9 nucleases) system. 
Depletion of B. mori Torso (BmTorso) did not eventually affect larval ecdysis 
and metamorphosis processes. Instead, BmTorso deficiency resulted in significant 
extension of developing time during larval and pupal stages with increased pupa 
and cocoon sizes. The ecdysteriod titers in the hemolymph of BmTorso mutants 
sharpy declined. Transcriptional levels of genes involved in ecdysone 
biosynthesis and ecdysteroid signaling pathways were significantly reduced in 
BmTorso-deficient animals. Additionally, RNA-Seq analysis revealed that genes 
involved in the longevity pathway and protein processing in the endoplasmic 
reticulum pathway were affected after BmTorso deletion. These results indicate 
that Torso is critical for maintaining steroid hormone homeostasis in insects.

What is the status of metabolic theory one century after Pütter invented the von 
Bertalanffy growth curve?

VIC, 3010, Australia.

Metabolic theory aims to tackle ecological and evolutionary problems by 
explicitly including physical principles of energy and mass exchange, thereby 
increasing generality and deductive power. Individual growth models (IGMs) are 
the fundamental basis of metabolic theory because they represent the 
organisational level at which energy and mass exchange processes are most 
tightly integrated and from which scaling patterns emerge. Unfortunately, IGMs 
remain a topic of great confusion and controversy about the origins of the 
ideas, their domain and breadth of application, their logical consistency and 
whether they can sufficiently capture reality. It is now 100 years since the 
first theoretical model of individual growth was put forward by Pütter. His 
insights were deep, but his model ended up being attributed to von Bertalanffy 
and his ideas largely forgotten. Here I review Pütter's ideas and trace their 
influence on existing theoretical models for growth and other aspects of 
metabolism, including those of von Bertalanffy, the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) 
theory, the Gill-Oxygen Limitation Theory (GOLT) and the Ontogenetic Growth 
Model (OGM). I show that the von Bertalanffy and GOLT models are minor 
modifications of Pütter's original model. I then synthesise, compare and 
critique the ideas of the two most-developed theories, DEB theory and the OGM, 
in relation to Pütter's original ideas. I formulate the Pütter, DEB and OGM 
models in the same structure and with the same notation to illustrate the major 
similarities and differences among them. I trace the confusion and controversy 
regarding these theories to the notions of anabolism, catabolism, assimilation 
and maintenance, the connections to respiration rate, and the number of 
parameters and state variables their models require. The OGM model has 
significant inconsistencies that stem from the interpretation of growth as the 
difference between anabolism and maintenance, and these issues seriously 
challenge its ability to incorporate development, reproduction and assimilation. 
The DEB theory is a direct extension of Pütter's ideas but with growth being the 
difference between assimilation and maintenance rather than anabolism and 
catabolism. The DEB theory makes the dynamics of Pütter's 'nutritive material' 
explicit as well as extending the scheme to include reproduction and 
development. I discuss how these three major theories for individual growth have 
been used to explain 'macrometabolic' patterns including the scaling of 
respiration, the temperature-size rule (first modelled by Pütter), and the 
connection to life history. Future research on the connections between theory 
and data in these macrometabolic topics have the greatest potential to advance 
the status of metabolic theory and its value for pure and applied problems in 
ecology and evolution.

Palliative care and end-of-life (EOL) care are highly requested in hospital, 
especially in the Internal Medicine wards, exposed, as they are, to receive 
elderly, frail patients affected by multiple chronic diseases and limited life 
expectancy. Within the medical staff, the nurses are specifically responsible to 
guarantee an appropriate and non-futile standard of care for this kind of 
patients, oriented to their real requirements and primarily to the relief their 
symptoms, without disregarding their spiritual needs. The competence in EOL-care 
should be equally distributed and shared among physicians and nurses in all 
clinical settings, because every single component should be able to plan its own 
intervention according to the comfort care concept, and, in the meanwhile, 
should be able to share decisions in an interdisciplinary manner. This is the 
only way for clinical pathways to result efficacious as they should 
be.«Astieniti nelle ultime fasi di vita della persona assistita da procedure 
invasive, seleziona gli interventi da attuare a garanzia della sua dignità, 
della sua qualità di vita e della gestione di sintomi, in modo particolare del 
controllo del dolore».

OBJECTIVE: To estimate and analyze the regional patterns of life expectancy at 
birth in Mexico for the period 1990-2010 using multiple regression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple regression analysis is used to obtain life 
expectancy rates at state level. This method considers variables such as crude 
death rate and population over 65 years of age to know the level of convergence 
between states.
RESULTS: There is a pattern of convergence that suggests that the differences in 
the life expectancy levels decreased among states during the analyzed period. 
This trend is also observed at the regional level.
DISCUSSION: It could be said that this analysis is useful to evaluate the public 
health policies in Mexico that focus on the reduction of health inequalities 
among the poorest and most vulnerable populations. Likewise, this type of method 
allows having an alternative method to know the conditions of access to health 
services and the life expectancy of the population.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Estimar y analizar para el período 1990 al 2010 los 
patrones regionales de la esperanza de vida al nacer en México por medio del 
método de regresión lineal.
MATERIALES Y MÉTODOS: Se utiliza la regresión lineal para obtener la esperanza 
de vida a nivel estatal y éste considera variables como la tasa bruta o cruda de 
mortalidad y la población mayor a 65 años. Esto permite conocer el nivel de 
convergencia entre los estados.
RESULTADOS: Existe un patrón de convergencia que sugiere que las diferencias de 
los niveles de esperanza de vida se han reducido entre los estados durante el 
período de estudio, esta tendencia se presenta también a nivel regional.
DISCUSIÓN: Se puede mencionar que este análisis puede ser útil en la evaluación 
de las políticas de salud pública de México que se han centrado en la 
disminución de las desigualdades en salud entre las poblaciones más pobres y 
vulnerables. Asimismo, este tipo de método permite tener un método alternativo 
para conocer las condiciones de acceso a los servicios de salud y conocer las 
expectativas de vida de la población.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify the inequalities observed in the 
autonomous city of Buenos Aires in three dimensions related to the health status 
of the population: mortality, fertility, and demographic structure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, quantitative, cross-sectional study was 
carried out using data from the Vital Statistics and the 2010 National Census of 
Population and Housing. Indicators were calculated to measure three areas of the 
dimensions mentioned above in the autonomous city of Buenos Aires (north, 
center, and south areas).
RESULTS: A high level of inequality was observed in the dimensions studied. 
Compared to the best performing area, the southern zone had a 20% higher 
mortality rate, a four-year lower life expectancy, and a 50% higher fertility 
rate. Moreover, the study found that the level of aging in the southern zone was 
roughly two thirds of the most aged area.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence reinforce the previous characterization of the 
southern area of Buenos Aires as socioeconomically segregated, with values 
similar to those of populations with inadequate living conditions. On the other 
hand, no significant differences were found between the northern and central 
areas.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Este estudio se propuso cuantificar las desigualdades 
observadas en la Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires en tres dimensiones 
relacionadas con el estado de salud de la población: mortalidad, fecundidad y 
estructura demográfica.
MÉTODO: Se realizó un estudio observacional, cuantitativo, de corte transversal 
a través de información proveniente de las Estadísticas vitales y el Censo 
Nacional de Población Hogares y Viviendas de 2010. Se calcularon indicadores 
para la medición de las dimensiones mencionadas anteriormente en tres áreas de 
la Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires.
RESULTADOS: Se observó un alto nivel de desigualdad en las dimensiones 
estudiadas. En relación a la zona más favorecida, la zona sur presentó una tasa 
de mortalidad ajustada superior en un 20%, una esperanza de vida de cuatro años 
menos, una tasa de fecundidad 50% más elevada y un nivel de envejecimiento 
cercano a los dos tercios del encontrado en el área más envejecida.
CONCLUSIÓN: Los hallazgos empíricos reafirman la caracterización previa de la 
zona sur como área socio-económicamente segregada, con valores asociados a 
poblaciones con condiciones de vida deficientes. Por otra parte, se destaca que 
no se observaron desigualdades significativas entre las zonas norte y centro.

BACKGROUND: Prolongation of life expectancy in cystic fibrosis (CF) to the 
fourth decade makes health-related quality of life (HRQOL) an important issue in 
this population. This study aims to evaluate the effects of clinical and 
socio-demographic characteristics of patients on different aspects of HRQOL in a 
pediatric CF population. We also intend to assess some measures of reliability 
and validity of the Turkish CF Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) forms.
METHODS: Fifty-four CF patients and 46 parents / caregivers filled the 
appropriate CFQ-R forms. Disease severity was evaluated via modified 
Shwachman-Kulczycki (SK) scores, and additional clinical information was 
obtained from patient records.
RESULTS: Forty-three percent (n = 23) of patients were female, the mean age of 
patients being 13.3 ± 3.96 years. Self- and proxy-reported points showed a 
strong correlation (Spearman's rho > 0.6) on more observable domains of HRQOL 
(e.g. physical functioning). No significant difference was found between sexes 
on any HRQOL domain. When compared between age groups, treatment burden appeared 
to worsen with age, while social functioning improved. All three forms of the 
CFQ-R Turkish version showed acceptable internal consistency reliability and 
convergence with disease severity measures.
CONCLUSIONS: The CFQ-R showed a fair correlation with the Shwachman-Kulczycki 
score and the FEV1% value, which makes its longitudinal use possible in clinical 
practice. It is important to use self-reported evaluations as well as parent / 
caregiver-reported HRQOL evaluations, especially in young children. More studies 
are needed to assess the psychometric properties of Turkish CFQ-R forms.

BACKGROUND: colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent types of 
malignancies worldwide. The incidence of CRC is steadily increasing due to 
extended life expectancy and aging-related genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. 
Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been implicated in CRC development.
METHODS: the current study is a basic research study aimed at understanding the 
molecular mechanism of miR-101 in the pathogenesis of CRC using human samples in 
vivo and CRC cell lines in vitro. The miRNAs profile from human samples was 
analyzed by miRNA microarrays and the expression level of single miRNAs were 
confirmed by qRT-PCR. The validation of the direct target of miR-101 was 
performed by western blot assay. The cell mobility of CRC was assessed using the 
Transwell migration assay.
RESULTS: downregulation of miR-101 was identified in 39 human CRC tissues and 
CRC cell lines (HT29 and SW620) when compared to their counterpart control. We 
further confirmed that the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone 
methyltransferase, is a direct target of miR-101. Overexpression of EZH2 
promoted CRC cell line migration and this effect was inhibited by forcing the 
expression of miR-101. Thus, we conclude that miR-101 regulated colon cancer 
cell migration occurs at least partially, though targeting EZH2.
CONCLUSION: our study suggests that miR-101 functions as a tumor suppressor in 
CRC, and miR-101 may be a potential therapeutic target for CRC treatment.

BACKGROUND: Social engagement (SE) has been consistently shown to improve 
survival among community-dwelling older people, but the evidence in nursing home 
residents is inconclusive and prone to short-term reverse causation and 
confounding by major health determinants. Our main objective was to study the 
potential causal effect of within-the-facility social engagement (SE) on 
long-term all-cause mortality in care home residents.
METHODS: A representative cohort of 382 nursing home residents in Madrid without 
severe physical and cognitive impairments at baseline was followed up for 
10-year all-cause mortality. Standardized mortality curves for residents with 
low/null, moderate, and high levels of SE at baseline were estimated using 
Kaplan-Meier methods and spline-based survival models with inverse probability 
of exposure weights conditional on baseline sociodemographic characteristics, 
facility features, comorbidity, and disability. Standardized 5-year mortality 
risks and median survival times were compared across levels of SE.
RESULTS: The baseline prevalences of low/null, moderate, and high SE were 36, 
44, and 20%, respectively. Compared with residents with low/null SE at baseline, 
the standardized differences (95% confidence intervals) in 5-year mortality risk 
were - 2.3% (- 14.6 to 10.0%) for moderately engaged residents and - 18.4% 
(- 33.8 to - 2.9%) for highly engaged residents. The median survival time 
increased by 0.4 (- 1.4 to 2.2) and 3.0 (0.8 to 5.2) years, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Residents with high SE within the nursing home had an 18% lower 
5-year mortality risk and a 3-year increase in their median survival, as 
compared with residents with similar health determinants but low/null SE. The 
development of adequate tailored intervention programs, addressed to increase SE 
in nursing home residents, could improve their long-term survival, in addition 
to expected gains in quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Metastatic breast cancer is a major cause of cancer-related deaths 
in woman. Brain metastasis is a common and devastating site of relapse for 
several breast cancer molecular subtypes, including oestrogen receptor-positive 
disease, with life expectancy of less than a year. While efforts have been 
devoted to developing therapeutics for extra-cranial metastasis, drug 
penetration of blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a major clinical challenge. 
Defining molecular alterations in breast cancer brain metastasis enables the 
identification of novel actionable targets.
METHODS: Global transcriptomic analysis of matched primary and metastatic 
patient tumours (n = 35 patients, 70 tumour samples) identified a putative new 
actionable target for advanced breast cancer which was further validated in vivo 
and in breast cancer patient tumour tissue (n = 843 patients). A peptide mimetic 
of the target's natural ligand was designed in silico and its efficacy assessed 
in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models of breast cancer metastasis.
RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis of over-represented pathways in metastatic 
breast cancer identified ADAM22 as a top ranked member of the ECM-related 
druggable genome specific to brain metastases. ADAM22 was validated as an 
actionable target in in vitro, ex vivo and in patient tumour tissue (n = 843 
patients). A peptide mimetic of the ADAM22 ligand LGI1, LGI1MIM, was designed in 
silico. The efficacy of LGI1MIM and its ability to penetrate the BBB were 
assessed in vitro, ex vivo and in brain metastasis BBB 3D biometric biohybrid 
models, respectively. Treatment with LGI1MIM in vivo inhibited disease 
progression, in particular the development of brain metastasis.
CONCLUSION: ADAM22 expression in advanced breast cancer supports development of 
breast cancer brain metastasis. Targeting ADAM22 with a peptide mimetic LGI1MIM 
represents a new therapeutic option to treat metastatic brain disease.
