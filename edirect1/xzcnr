significant negative correlation between septal aperture and triceps muscles was 
noted in right bones in females (τ = -0.331) and in both sexes combined 
(τ = -0.322). The relationship between septal aperture and the brachialis muscle 
was positive but non-significant. This means that looser triceps lead to greater 
looseness of the elbow, greater protrusion of the olecranon process, and 
consequent septal aperture formation. Different results were obtained for the 
brachialis, which may suggest that forearm flexion does not significantly affect 
septal lamina perforation.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that imposes a substantial economic 
burden. We conducted a cost-utility analysis from a Swedish healthcare payers 
perspective using a decision-tree model with a 12-week time horizon. Patients 
with psoriasis vulgaris could have two 4-week cycles of topical treatment with 
calcipotriol 50 µg/g and betamethasone 0.5 mg/g as dipropionate (Cal/BD) foam or 
Cal/BD ointment before progressing to phototherapy/methotrexate. In the 
base-case analysis, Cal/BD foam dominated over Cal/BD ointment. The increased 
efficacy of Cal/BD foam resulted in fewer consultations and a decreased risk of 
progressing to phototherapy/methotrexate. Although Cal/BD foam costs more than 
Cal/BD ointment, this was offset by lower costs for phototherapy/methotrexate or 
consultation visits. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the base-case net 
monetary benefit was robust to plausible variations in key parameters. In 
conclusion, Cal/BD foam was predicted to be more cost-effective than Cal/BD 
ointment in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris.

OBJECTIVE: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has become more frequent in the elderly 
population due to increased life expectancy. The aim of this trial was to 
determine clinical and laboratory factors related to in-hospital mortality in 
patients over 80 years of age who presented with ACS.
METHODS: A total 171 patients (86 men, median age 83 years) who were over 80 
years of age and were hospitalized due to a diagnosis of ACS were enrolled in 
this study. The patients' demographic data, clinical features, and laboratory 
values were screened retrospectively from hospital records.
RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 19 of 171 patients (11.1%) died. The 
causes of death were cardiogenic shock (n=6, 31.5%), acute renal failure (n=6, 
31.5%), arrhythmia (n=4, 21%), and septic shock (n=3, 15.7%). ST-segment 
elevation myocardial infarction presentation was more common among those who 
died [14 (73.7%) vs. 31 (20.5%); p<0.001]. Patients who died during in-hospital 
follow-up also had higher peak troponin [3.1 ng/mL (7.2) vs. 0.3 ng/mL (1.6); 
p<0.001] and creatine kinase-MB levels [96.7 ng/mL (194) vs. 10.9 ng/mL (36.2); 
p<0.001]. The results indicated that a high Global Registry of Acute Coronary 
Events (GRACE) risk score [odds risk (OR): 1.074, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.039-1.110; p<0.001], ejection fraction (EF) ≤40% (OR: 8.113, 95% CI: 
1.101-59.773; p=0.040), or no use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor 
(ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (OR: 0.075, 95% CI: 0.006-0.995; 
p=0.049) was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality.
CONCLUSION: Presentation with a high GRACE risk score, no use of an ACEI/ARB, 
and a low EF at admission were associated with in-hospital mortality in ACS 
patients more than 80 years old.

AIMS: Although group-level effectiveness of lipid, blood pressure, glucose, and 
aspirin treatment for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been proven 
by trials, important differences in absolute effectiveness exist between 
individuals. We aim to develop and validate a prediction tool for 
individualizing lifelong CVD prevention in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) predicting life-years gained without myocardial infarction or stroke.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed and validated the Diabetes 
Lifetime-perspective prediction (DIAL) model, consisting of two complementary 
competing risk adjusted Cox proportional hazards functions using data from 
people with T2DM registered in the Swedish National Diabetes Registry 
(n = 389 366). Competing outcomes were (i) CVD events (vascular mortality, 
myocardial infarction, or stroke) and (ii) non-vascular mortality. Predictors 
were age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, haemoglobin 
A1c, estimated glomerular filtration rate, non- high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, albuminuria, T2DM duration, insulin treatment, and history of CVD. 
External validation was performed using data from the ADVANCE, ACCORD, ASCOT and 
ALLHAT-LLT-trials, the SMART and EPIC-NL cohorts, and the Scottish diabetes 
register (total n = 197 785). Predicted and observed CVD-free survival showed 
good agreement in all validation sets. C-statistics for prediction of CVD were 
0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.83-0.84) and 0.64-0.65 for internal and 
external validation, respectively. We provide an interactive calculator at 
www.U-Prevent.com that combines model predictions with relative treatment 
effects from trials to predict individual benefit from preventive treatment.
CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular disease-free life expectancy and effects of lifelong 
prevention in terms of CVD-free life-years gained can be estimated for people 
with T2DM using readily available clinical characteristics. Predictions of 
individual-level treatment effects facilitate translation of trial results to 
individual patients.

Reflection on modern methods: years of life lost due to premature mortality-a 
versatile and comprehensive measure for monitoring non-communicable disease 
mortality.

The analysis of causes impacting on premature mortality is an essential function 
of public health surveillance. Diverse methods have been used for accurately 
assessing and reporting the level and trends of premature mortality; however, 
many have important limitations, particularly in capturing actual early deaths. 
We argue that the framework of years of life lost (YLL), as conceptualized in 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), is a robust and comprehensive measure of 
premature mortality. Global Burden of Disease study is systematically providing 
estimates of YLL; however, it is not widely adopted at country level, among 
other reasons because its conceptual and methodological bases seem to be not 
sufficiently known and understood. In this paper, we provide the concepts and 
the methodology of the YLL framework, including the selection of the loss of 
function that defines the time lost due to premature deaths, and detailed 
methods for calculating YLL metrics. We also illustrate how to use YLL to 
quantify the level and trends of premature non-communicable disease (NCD) 
mortality in the Americas. The tutorial style of the illustrative example is 
intended to educate the public health community and stimulate the use of YLL in 
disease prevention and control programmes at different levels.

BACKGROUND: Significant gains in life expectancy have been achieved, but living 
longer does not necessarily mean the years gained are productive and healthy. 
Different theories predict different patterns of time trends in old-age 
disability prevalence.
METHODS: Using the Gateway to Global Aging Data, which provides internationally 
harmonized longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study and its sister 
surveys, we compare time trends (from 2004 to 2014) in disability prevalence 
across countries.
RESULTS: Disability prevalence varies greatly across countries, and divergent 
time trends are observed across countries. For countries such as Belgium, 
Czechia, and Mexico, we observe an increase of disability prevalence, whereas in 
countries such as Denmark, England, Greece, Korea, Poland, and Sweden, we 
observe a substantial decrease in disability prevalence. Looking further into 
the severity of disability, we often observe differential trends in prevalence, 
but there is no evidence supporting the dynamic equilibrium hypothesis that 
predicts increased prevalence of modest disability but a decrease in severe 
disability prevalence.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant gains in life expectancy have translated into different 
gains in healthy years of life across different countries. Diverse time trends 
in disability prevalence across countries reaffirm that the expansion of 
late-life disability is not inevitable.

Key Nodes Selection in Controlling Complex Networks via Convex Optimization.

Ding J, Wen C, Li G, Chen Z.

Key nodes are the nodes connected with a given number of external source 
controllers that result in minimal control cost. Finding such a subset of nodes 
is a challenging task since it impossible to list and evaluate all possible 
solutions unless the network is small. In this paper, we approximately solve 
this problem by proposing three algorithms step by step. By relaxing the Boolean 
constraints in the original optimization model, a convex problem is obtained. 
Then inexact alternating direction method of multipliers (IADMMs) is proposed 
and convergence property is theoretically established. Based on the degree 
distribution, an extension method named degree-based IADMM (D-IADMM) is proposed 
such that key nodes are pinpointed. In addition, with the technique of local 
optimization employed on the results of D-IADMM, we also develop LD-IADMM and 
the performance is greatly improved. The effectiveness of the proposed 
algorithms is validated on different networks ranging from Erdős-Rényi networks 
and scale-free networks to some real-life networks.

BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal meningitis accounts for 15% of AIDS-related mortality. 
Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) is detected in blood weeks before onset of 
meningitis, and CrAg positivity is an independent predictor of meningitis and 
death. CrAg screening for patients with advanced HIV and preemptive treatment is 
recommended by the World Health Organization, though implementation remains 
limited. Our objective was to evaluate costs and mortality reduction (lives 
saved) from a national CrAg screening program across Uganda.
METHODS: We created a decision analytic model to evaluate CrAg screening. CrAg 
screening was considered for those with a CD4<100 cells/μL per national and 
international guidelines, and in the context of a national HIV test-and-treat 
program where CD4 testing was not available. Costs (2016 USD) were estimated for 
screening, preemptive therapy, hospitalization, and maintenance therapy. 
Parameter assumptions were based on large prospective CrAg screening studies in 
Uganda, and clinical trials from sub Saharan Africa. CrAg positive (CrAg+) 
persons could be: (a) asymptomatic and thus eligible for preemptive treatment 
with fluconazole; or (b) symptomatic with meningitis with hospitalization.
RESULTS: In the base case model for 1 million persons with a CD4 test annually, 
128,000 with a CD4<100 cells/μL were screened, and 8,233 were asymptomatic CrAg+ 
and received preemptive therapy. Compared to no screening and treatment, CrAg 
screening and treatment in the base case cost $3,356,724 compared to doing 
nothing, and saved 7,320 lives, for a cost of $459 per life saved, with the $3.3 
million in cost savings derived from fewer patients developing fulminant 
meningitis. In the scenario of a national HIV test-and-treat program, of 1 
million HIV-infected persons, 800,000 persons were screened, of whom 640,000 
returned to clinic, and 8,233 were incident CrAg positive (CrAg prevalence 
1.4%). The total cost of a CrAg screening and treatment program was $4.16 
million dollars, with 2,180 known deaths. Conversely, without CrAg screening, 
the cost of treating meningitis was $3.09 million dollars with 3,806 deaths. 
Thus, despite the very low CrAg prevalence of 1.4% in the general HIV-infected 
population, and inadequate retention-in-care, CrAg screening averted 43% of 
deaths from cryptococcal meningitis at a cost of $662 per death averted.
CONCLUSION: CrAg screening and treatment programs are cost-saving and 
lifesaving, assuming preemptive treatment is 77% effective in preventing death, 
and could be adopted and implemented by ministries of health to reduce mortality 
in those with advanced HIV disease. Even within HIV test-and-treat programs 
where CD4 testing is not performed, and CrAg prevalence is only 1.4%, CrAg 
screening is cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of hepatitis C virus infections (HCV) with direct acting 
antivirals (DAA) can prevent new infections since cured individuals cannot 
transmit HCV. However, as DAAs are expensive, many countries defer treatment to 
advances stages of fibrosis, which results in ongoing transmission. We assessed 
the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of treatment initiation in 
different stages of infection in the Netherlands where the epidemic is mainly 
concentrated among HIV-infected MSMs.
METHODS: We calibrated a deterministic mathematical model to the Dutch HCV 
epidemic among HIV-infected MSM to compare three different DAA treatment 
scenarios: 1) immediate treatment, 2) treatment delayed to chronic infection 
allowing spontaneous clearance to occur, 3) treatment delayed until F2 fibrosis 
stage. All scenarios are simulated from 2015 onwards. Total costs, quality 
adjusted life years (QALY), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and 
epidemiological impact were calculated from a providers perspective over a 
lifetime horizon. We used a DAA price of €35,000 and 3% discounting rates for 
cost and QALYs.
RESULTS: Immediate DAA treatment lowers the incidence from 1.2/100 person-years 
to 0.2/100 person-years (interquartile range 0.1-0.2) and the prevalence from 
5.0/100 person-years to 0.5/100 person-years (0.4-0.6) after 20 years. Delayed 
treatment awaiting spontaneous clearance will result in a similar reduction. 
However, further delayed treatment to F2 will increases the incidence and 
prevalence. Earlier treatment will cost society €68.3 and €75.1 million over a 
lifetime for immediate and awaiting until the chronic stage, respectively. The 
cost will increase if treatment is further delayed until F2 to €98.4 million. 
Immediate treatment will prevent 7070 new infections and gains 3419 (3019-3854) 
QALYs compared to F2 treatment resulting in a cost saving ICER. Treatment in the 
chronic stage is however dominated.
CONCLUSIONS: Early DAA treatment for HIV-infected MSM is an excellent and 
sustainable tool to meet the WHO goal of eliminating HCV in 2030.

AIMS: The aim of this systematic review was to explore health care 
professionals' attitudes towards deprescribing in older people with limited life 
expectancy.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted from inception to December 
2017 using MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL. Studies were included if they 
specifically concerned older people (≥65 years) with limited life expectancy, 
including those residing in any type of aged care facility, or were based on 
representative patient profiles. Results were analyzed inspired by the Joanna 
Briggs Institute's method for synthesis of qualitative data. Studies were 
characterized using a checklist for reporting of qualitative research.
RESULTS: Eight studies were included. Six studies explored health care 
professionals' views on deprescribing in general, and two studies focused 
specifically on psychotropic agents. All eight studies explored the views of 
physicians, mostly general practitioners, while three studies also considered 
other health care professionals. Four themes related to health care 
professionals' attitudes towards deprescribing were identified: (i) patient and 
relative involvement; (ii) the importance of teamwork; (iii) health care 
professionals' self-assurance and skills; and (iv) the impact of organizational 
factors. Within each of these themes, 3-4 subthemes were identified and 
analysed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that health care professionals' decisions to 
engage in deprescribing activities with older people with limited life 
expectancy depend on multiple factors which are highly interdependent. 
Consequently, there is an urgent need for more research on how to approach 
deprescribing in clinical practice within this population.

Background: People diagnosed with schizophrenia have a much reduced life 
expectancy compared to the general population, and a more than doubled risk of 
dying from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Existing CVD risk calculators can be 
used to detect people with an elevated predicted risk of CVD to inform 
interventions to reduce risk. Aims: This study aimed to compare four different 
risk calculators for 10-year predicted CVD risk in a sample of people with 
schizophrenia. Methods: Thirty participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia 
spectrum disorders living within Greater Manchester, United Kingdom took part. 
Ten-year predicted cardiovascular risk scores were calculated using four 
different models: QRISK3, Framingham, PRIMROSE BMI, and PRIMROSE lipid. Risk 
estimates and classified risk categories were compared. Results: QRISK3 
identified 11 (39%) as having >10% risk of a CV event within 10 years, 4 (14%) 
of whom exceeded 20%. The Framingham model identified 4 (14%) as exceeding 10%, 
none of whom exceeded 20%. PRIMROSE risk calculators identified no participants 
as having >10% risk of a CV event within 10 years. Pairwise concordance 
correlation coefficients between types of model ranged 0.22-0.77. Mean (± SD) 
age was 40 (± 10) years but QRISK3's mean "Heart age" was 58 (± 14) years. 
Conclusion: Risk calculators generate differing predicted CVD risk scores for 
patients with schizophrenia. Using one risk calculator might yield different 
recommended monitoring and treatment plans compared to another. Clinicians 
should therefore take into account other patient-related factors, such as 
patients' preferences and other underlying physical conditions when making 
treatment decisions.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) now provides diagnostic assessment for numerous 
clinical indications, including lesion detection, characterization, functional 
assessment, and response to treatment. To maximize the potential to improve 
health through the use of MRI, it is critical to investigate the impact of MRI 
on outcomes, and to compare the effectiveness of MRI with existing standard 
diagnostic approaches. Outcomes of MRI can include survival but also 
intermediate steps such as potential reduction in unnecessary therapy, shorter 
time to the appropriate therapy, or shorter periods of hospital admission. To 
understand the effectiveness of an imaging test's sensitivity and specificity, 
the results' consequences are weighed, reflecting the disease type, severity, 
and treatment effects. In some instances, other modalities may be faster, more 
readily available, or less costly than MRI but additional disease-related 
information or better accuracy may translate to greater population level 
benefit. For health policy decisions and clinical guidelines, studies of 
comparative outcomes can lend depth to the strength of the evidence, the 
specific benefits vs. harms of using one test over another, and the most 
effective use of the test in terms of target population. Cost effectiveness then 
allows for a direct comparison of approaches in terms of the cost for the 
projected gain in life expectancy and/or quality adjusted life expectancy. 
Expanding the literature on improved efficiency, accessibility, clinical 
effectiveness, and cost effectiveness will support the directive for better 
quality and value in healthcare. Level of Evidence 5 Technical Efficacy Stage 5

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and invariable fatal 
interstitial lung disease. Current antifibrotic treatment halts disease 
progression but does not cure the disease itself. In the last decade, a 
substantial understanding of disease pathobiological mechanisms led to the 
development of numerous clinical trials testing promising pharmacologic agents. 
Areas covered: In this review, we summarize and discuss current and emerging 
pharmacological therapies for IPF and highlight the potential of different 
promising investigational compounds in phase II-IV trials with positive or 
pending results. Expert commentary: Existing therapies for IPF slow disease 
progression and recent advances in understanding IPF complex pathogenesis 
unfolded multiple new possible therapeutic targets. A relevant number of 
promising clinical trials targeted specific biologic pathways, are ongoing or 
upcoming, but we are far away from a definitive cure of IPF soon. An 'oncologic 
approach' via tailoring medicine could be a realistic therapeutic intervention 
that may improve expectancy and quality of life in IPF.

Increasing healthcare expenditure in West African countries cannot be 
over-emphasized. There is need for urgent improvement of healthcare, healthcare 
equipment and facilities, and human resources with qualified healthcare givers. 
It is important to have clarity on which healthcare sector to invest in, to 
maximize impact, effectiveness and efficiency. This study investigated the 
private, public, and public-private healthcare sectors of West Africa. Data was 
obtained from World Bank Indicators within the period of 16 years (from 1999 - 
2014). Using pooled regression and pairwise correlation, empirical results were 
obtained. Female population lived longer than the male population and a positive 
relationship was obtained between the variables of healthcare spending and life 
expectancy for the public healthcare sector. The results showed a negative 
relationship between these variables for the private healthcare sector. The 
government, policy and decision-makers are recommended to focus on increasing 
the expenditure on the public healthcare system to achieve positive outcomes for 
increased life expectancy against other healthcare sectors that remain expensive 
and inaccessible to the population.

The GALLIUM trial compared obinutuzumab (GA101, G)-based chemotherapy followed 
by G monotherapy (G + chemo) for up to two years to rituximab (R)-based 
chemotherapy followed by R monotherapy (R + chemo) for up to two years in 
previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) patients. We estimated the 
cost-effectiveness of G + chemo versus R + chemo utilizing GALLIUM trial data 
and published literature. G + chemo had increased drug costs (undiscounted: 
$135,200 versus $127,700 for R + chemo), representing a relative increase of 
5.9%. However, this was offset by a $6,400 lower cost for disease progression. 
G + chemo led to increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) relative to 
R + chemo of 0.81 (95% credible range, [CR]: 0.22-1.37), and the overall 
discounted incremental cost was $1,900 (95% CR: -$7,400 to $8,900). The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was ∼$2,300 per QALY gained, and the 
results were highly robust to sensitivity analyses. Treatment with G + chemo 
compared to R + chemo is cost-effective in previously untreated FL patients in 
the US.

PURPOSE: We sought to identify facility level variation in the use of definitive 
therapy among men diagnosed with clinically localized, low risk prostate cancer 
who were more than 65 years old and had a limited life expectancy of less than 
10 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the National Cancer Database we 
identified 18,178 men older than 65 years with less than a 10-year life 
expectancy receiving definitive therapy at a total of 1,172 facilities for 
biopsy confirmed localized, low risk prostate cancer diagnosed between January 
2004 and December 2013. A multilevel, hierarchical, mixed effects logistic 
regression model was fitted to predict the odds of receiving definitive therapy.
RESULTS: Overall 18,178 men (76%) older than 65 years with limited life 
expectancy and a diagnosis of low risk prostate cancer received definitive 
therapy, although the rate of therapy decreased significantly with time (p 
<0.001). Patients receiving definitive therapy were more often younger (80 years 
or older vs 66 to 69 years OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.09-0.15, p <0.001) and white rather 
than black (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.98, p = 0.03). Conversely, being uninsured 
(OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.63, p <0.001) and receiving care at an academic medical 
center (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.28-0.46, p <0.001) conferred decreased odds of 
undergoing definitive therapy. The proportion of men undergoing definitive 
therapy ranged from 0.12% to 100% across facilities.
CONCLUSIONS: We found significant facility level variation in rates of 
definitive therapy in men with localized prostate cancer and limited life 
expectancy. Health care providers and policy makers alike should be aware of the 
varying frequency with which this potentially low value service is performed.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the clinical effects and cost-effectiveness of universal 
prenatal hepatitis C screening, and to calculate potential life expectancy, 
quality of life, and health care costs associated with universal prenatal 
hepatitis C screening and linkage to treatment.
METHODS: Using a stochastic individual-level microsimulation model, we simulated 
the lifetimes of 250 million pregnant women matched at baseline with the U.S. 
childbearing population on age, injection drug use behaviors, and hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) infection status. Modeled outcomes included hepatitis C diagnosis, 
treatment and cure, lifetime health care costs, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios comparing universal prenatal 
hepatitis C screening to current practice. We modeled whether neonates exposed 
to maternal HCV at birth were identified as such.
RESULTS: Pregnant women with hepatitis C infection lived 1.21 years longer and 
had 16% lower HCV-attributable mortality with universal prenatal hepatitis C 
screening, which had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $41,000 per QALY 
gained compared with current practice. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
remained below $100,000 per QALY gained in most sensitivity analyses; notable 
exceptions included incremental cost-effectiveness ratios above $100,000 when 
assuming mean time to cirrhosis of 70 years, a cost greater than $500,000 per 
false positive diagnosis, or population HCV infection prevalence below 0.16%. 
Universal prenatal hepatitis C screening increased identification of neonates 
exposed to HCV at birth from 44% to 92%.
CONCLUSIONS: In our model, universal prenatal hepatitis C screening improves 
health outcomes in women with HCV infection, improves identification of HCV 
exposure in neonates born at risk, and is cost-effective.

OBJECTIVES: Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) imposes high disease burden in South 
Korea. Although various effective interventions are available to manage the 
progression of OAG, there is limited data on the cost-effectiveness of these 
treatment strategies in South Korea.
METHODS: Using a Markov cohort model, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 3 
major treatment strategies (medication, laser trabeculoplasty, and 
trabeculectomy) for South Korean patients with OAG. We projected a 25-year time 
horizon to study a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients of age 40 with mild 
OAG. The outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, cost 
from the societal perspective, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of medication, laser trabeculoplasty, and trabeculectomy. Interventions 
were evaluated at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 30,000,000 KRW 
($29,152) per QALY gained. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were conducted to address the model uncertainty.
RESULTS: The mean costs for medication, laser trabeculoplasty, and 
trabeculectomy were 29,661,740 KRW, 17,34,1342 KRW, and 22,275,438 KRW, 
respectively. The mean QALYs gained were 15.7, 15.3, and 14.8 for medication, 
laser trabeculoplasty, and trabeculectomy, respectively. Surgery was strongly 
dominated because it generated fewer expected QALYs but incurred greater 
expected cost than laser. The ICER was 30,885,179 KRW per QALY for medication 
versus laser trabeculoplasty. Laser was cost-effective, however, at a lower WTP 
threshold of 21,000,000 KRW per QALY gained or below. The results were most 
sensitive to the progression rates from mild to moderate glaucoma under laser 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: Under the WTP threshold of 30,000,000 KRW per QALY, medication was 
cost-effective compared with laser trabeculoplasty and trabeculectomy for 
treating mild OAG in South Korean population. Laser, however, can be a 
cost-effective alternative in more resource-limited settings.

The burden of pneumococcal disease in adults is substantial from a social and 
economic point of view. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of the 
13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) for the prevention of invasive 
pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults versus "no 
vaccination" and versus vaccination with the 23-valent pneumococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). A Markov model was used to simulate three 
strategies: no vaccination, complete vaccination with PPSV23 and complete 
vaccination with PCV13. The comparison between strategies allowed the estimation 
of clinical and economic outcomes including incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICER) and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR). The model took into 
account the distributions of age, risk profile, vaccination status, type of 
immunization and time since vaccination in the population. A societal 
perspective was adopted and a lifetime horizon was considered. Different sources 
of data and assumptions were used to calibrate PPSV23 and PCV13 effectiveness. 
Inpatient costs were based on the 2013 diagnosis-related group (DRG) database 
for National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and expert opinion; NHS official 
tariffs were the main source for unitary costs. PCV13 shows ICURs of 
€17,746/QALY and €13,146/QALY versus "no vaccination" and vaccination with 
PPSV23, respectively. Results proved to be robust in univariate sensitivity 
analyses, where all ratios were below a €20,000 threshold, with the exception of 
the scenario with PCV13 effectiveness halved. In a probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, 94% of simulations showed cost-effectiveness ratios lower than 
€20,000/QALY, in both strategies. It was found that PCV13 is a cost-effective 
strategy to prevent pneumococcal disease in adults in Portugal.

In the U.S., pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) uptake among high-risk 
adults aged <65 years is consistently low and improvement is needed. One barrier 
to improved vaccine coverage is the complexity of the adult vaccination 
schedule. This exploratory analysis compared the cost-effectiveness of 
strategies to increase pneumococcal vaccine uptake in high-risk adults aged 
50-64 years. We used a Markov model to compare strategies for 
non-immunocompromised 50-64 year olds: 1) current pneumococcal polysaccharide 
vaccine (PPSV23) recommendations; 2) current recommendations enhanced by an 
intervention; 3) PPSV23 plus pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) for 
high-risk patients with no intervention; or 4) both vaccines for all 
50-year-olds with no intervention. Parameters included CDC data and other US 
data, varied extensively in sensitivity analyses. In the analysis, vaccinating 
high-risk individuals with PPSV23/PCV13 was the least costly strategy, with 
total costs of $424/person. Vaccinating all 50 year olds with PPSV23/PCV13 cost 
$40 more and gained 0.00068 quality-adjusted life years (QALY), or $57,786/QALY 
gained. Current recommendations with or without an intervention program were 
more expensive and less effective than other strategies. In multi-way 
sensitivity analyses, the current recommendations/intervention program strategy 
was favored at a $100,000/QALY threshold only if non-bacteremic pneumococcal 
pneumonia rate or PCV13 serotype coverage were substantially lower than base 
case values. Thus, an intervention program to improve pneumococcal vaccine 
uptake among high-risk 50-64 year-olds was not cost-effective in most scenarios. 
High-risk individuals receiving both PCV13 and PPSV23 could be economically 
favorable, and vaccinating all 50-year-olds with both vaccines could be 
considered.

BACKGROUND: The 6-dimensional health state short form (SF-6D) is a health 
preference measure used in economic evaluations of many treatments.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the results provided by the SF-6D index, when applied to 
a representative sample of the Brazilian population, using Brazilian and UK 
preference weights.
METHODS: Five thousand individuals were assessed in the 5 regions of Brazil. 
Preference measures in healthcare were assessed using the SF-6D Brazil, version 
2002. To calculate the single utility score, 2 preference weights were used: one 
established for the Brazilian population (SF-6D Brazil) and the other for the UK 
population (SF-6D UK). Agreement between the SF-6D Brazil and the SF-6D UK was 
assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient, the Wilcoxon signed rank 
test, confidence intervals (CIs), and the Bland-Altman method.
RESULTS: The mean values of the SF-6D Brazil and the SF-6D UK were 0.83 ± 0.15 
and 0.84 ± 0.15, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.952 
(CI 0.942-0.960; P<.010). The Wilcoxon signed rank test and CI showed a 
statistically significant difference between the 2 measures; this difference 
was, however, very small and considered clinically irrelevant (CI 0.011-0.013; 
P<.010). Using the Bland-Altman method resulted in a mean difference of 0.012 
and the limits of agreement were between -0.077 and 0.101.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study identified very small quantitative differences 
between UK- and Brazilian-derived SF-6D scores. Tests of agreement, however, 
showed that the impact of using different sets of preference weights in the 
construction of quality-adjusted life-year might be considered irrelevant.
