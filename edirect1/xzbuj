YtvA is a blue light sensor protein composed of an N-terminal LOV 
(light-oxygen-voltage) domain, a linker helix, and the C-terminal sulfate 
transporter and anti-σ factor antagonist domain. YtvA is believed to act as a 
positive regulator for light and salt stress responses by regulating the σB 
transcription factor. Although its biological function has been studied, the 
reaction dynamics and molecular mechanism underlying the function are not well 
understood. To improve our understanding of the signaling mechanism, we studied 
the reaction of the LOV domain (YLOV, amino acids 26-127), the LOV domain with 
its N-terminal extension (N-YLOV, amino acids 1-127), the LOV domain with its 
C-terminal linker helix (YLOV-linker, amino acids 26-147), and the YLOV domain 
with the N-terminal extension and the C-terminal linker helix (N-YLOV-linker, 
amino acids 1-147) using the transient grating method. The signals of all 
constructs showed adduct formation, thermal diffusion, and molecular diffusion. 
YLOV showed no change in the diffusion coefficient (D), while the other three 
constructs showed a significant decrease in D within ∼70 μs of photoexcitation. 
This indicates that conformational changes in both the N- and C-terminal helices 
of the YLOV domain indeed do occur. The time constant in the YtvA derivatives 
was much faster than the corresponding dynamics of phototropins. Interestingly, 
an additional reaction was observed as a volume expansion as well as a slight 
increase in D only when both helices were included. These findings suggest that 
although the rearrangement of the N- and C-terminal helices occurs independently 
on the fast time scale, this change induces an additional conformational change 
only when both helices are present.

INTRODUCTION: Elderly onset (>60 yrs at diagnosis) Crohn's disease (CD) seems to 
be associated with a better outcome than when diagnosed earlier in life. The aim 
of this study was to compare the natural history of patients with CD older than 
70 years at diagnosis with that of elderly patients diagnosed between 60 and 70 
years in the EPIMAD population-based registry.
METHODS: Three hundred seventy patients with elderly onset CD diagnosed between 
January 1988 and December 2006 were identified. Among them, 188 (63%) were older 
than 70 years at diagnosis (≥70 yrs). Clinical presentation, disease location, 
and behavior at diagnosis and also natural history, surgery needs, and drug 
exposure were recorded, with a median follow-up of 4.5 years (1.1; 8.3) in CD 
diagnosed after 70 years and of 7.8 years (3.3; 12.1) in CD diagnosed between 60 
and 70 years, respectively.
RESULTS: CD incidence in elderly patients diagnosed ≥70 years was 2.3/100,000 
inhabitants, compared with 2.6/100,000 in elderly patients diagnosed below the 
age of 70 (60-69 yrs). The proportion of males was lower in patients ≥70 years 
than in patients aged 60 to 69 (31% versus 45%, P = 0.006). Clinical 
presentation at diagnosis was similar in both groups. Pure colonic location (L2) 
was more frequent among patients >70 years both at diagnosis (73% versus 57%, P 
= 0.004) and maximal follow-up (70% versus 47%, P < 0.0001). Disease extension 
(from L1 or L2 to L3) was not significantly different among patients >70 years 
and patients aged 60 to 69 years (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.0 [0.9; 4.5] for 60 to 
69 yrs, P = 0.09). The most frequent behavior in the 2 groups was inflammatory, 
both at diagnosis (75% versus 80%, P = 0.43) and at maximal follow-up (69% 
versus 70%, P = 0.55). There was no significant difference in patients >70 years 
compared with patients aged 60 to 69 years regarding treatment with 
5-aminosalicylic acid (P = 0.72), oral corticosteroids (P = 0.83), and 
anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies (P = 0.37). However, the use of 
immunosuppressants was significantly less frequent in patients >70 years (HR = 
2.1 [1.3; 3.5] for 60 to 69 yrs, P = 0.003). Risk of surgery was similar in both 
groups (P = 0.72). Extraintestinal manifestations at diagnosis were 
significantly associated with an evolution to complicated behavior (HR = 2.7 
[1.0; 7.0], P = 0.045), immunosuppressant treatment (HR = 2.9 [1.4; 6.0], P = 
0.006), and corticosteroid use (HR = 3.3 [1.8; 6.1], P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of CD in elderly patients diagnosed over the 
age of 70 is mild with low disease extension and complicated behavior. This 
needs to be taken into account when establishing therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: The selection of patients for oligometastasis-directed ablative 
therapy remains a challenge. The authors report on clinical and molecular 
predictors of survival from a stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) 
dose-escalation trial for oligometastases.
METHODS: Patients who had from 1 to 5 metastases, a life expectancy of >3 
months, and a Karnofsky performance status of >60 received escalating SBRT doses 
to all known cancer sites. Time to progression, progression-free survival, and 
overall survival (OS) were calculated at the completion of SBRT, and clinical 
predictors of OS were modeled. Primary tumor microRNA expression was analyzed to 
identify molecular predictors of OS.
RESULTS: Sixty-one evaluable patients were enrolled from 2004 to 2009. The 
median follow-up was 2.3 years for all patients (range, 0.2-9.3 years) and 6.8 
years for survivors (range, 2.0-9.3 years). The median, 2-year, and 5-year 
estimated OS were 2.4 years, 57%, and 32%, respectively. The rate of progression 
after SBRT was associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 
1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-1.82). The time from initial cancer 
diagnosis to metastasis (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.98-0.99), the time from metastasis 
to SBRT (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.98-0.99), and breast cancer histology (HR, 0.12; 
95% CI, 0.07-0.37) were significant predictors of OS. In an exploratory 
analysis, a candidate classifier using expression levels of 3 microRNAs 
(miR-23b, miR-449a, and miR-449b) predicted survival among 17 patients who had 
primary tumor microRNA expression data available.
CONCLUSIONS: A subset of oligometastatic patients achieves long-term survival 
after metastasis-directed SBRT. Clinical features and primary tumor microRNA 
expression profiling, if validated in an independent dataset, may help select 
oligometastatic patients most likely to benefit from metastasis-directed 
therapy. Cancer 2016;122:2242-50. © 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Despite the emergence of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) antiviral 
medications, many people with chronic HCV know little about their disease, are 
at risk for transmitting HCV to others, and/or are not considered good treatment 
candidates. Self-management interventions can educate HCV-infected persons, 
improve their quality of life, and prepare them for treatment.
PURPOSE: A cost-effectiveness analysis of the HCV Self-Management Program is 
presented.
METHOD: Effectiveness data in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were derived 
from the previously published prospective, randomized controlled trial ( n = 
134). Health care utilization was abstracted from medical records in 2011 for 
the 12 months before and after study enrollment. Intervention costs were tracked 
from the payer's perspective and combined with health care costs. Sensitivity 
analyses were used to examine assumptions. Data were analyzed in 2014.
RESULTS: Estimated intervention costs including organizational overhead were 
$1,760 per 6-week workshop, or $229/person. Health care costs were $815 
lower/person for self-management participants, resulting in a cost savings of 
$586/person. Self-management participants had an average net gain of 0.02975 
QALYs after 1 year. When removing inpatient substance use treatment days from 
analyses, costs were similar between groups, producing an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $6,218/QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed that the 
results and conclusions change little when assumptions were varied.
CONCLUSIONS: When compared to information-only, the HCV Self-Management Program 
led to more QALYs and cost savings in the randomized controlled trial. 
Independent of health care costs, the intervention is low-cost and educates 
HCV-infected individuals about antiviral treatment and avoiding viral 
transmission. Low-cost interventions that can enhance the outcomes derived from 
expensive antiviral treatments should be studied further.

Microprolactinomas are the most common pituitary adenomas. In symptomatic 
patients, dopamine agonists are the first-line treatment of choice; when 
cabergoline is used, biochemical control rates between 85 and 93% have been 
reported. Long-term treatment is needed in most of the cases with compliance, 
patient convenience, and potential adverse effects representing areas requiring 
attention. Based on the literature published in the past 15 years, 
transsphenoidal surgery can lead to normal prolactin in the postoperative period 
in usually 71-100% of the cases with very low postoperative complication rates. 
Surgical expertise is the major determinant of the outcomes, and it may be a 
cost-effective option in young patients with life expectancy greater than 10 
years (provided it is performed by experienced surgeons at high volume centers 
with confirmed optimal outcomes). Larger series of patients with adequate 
follow-up could further validate the place of transsphenoidal surgery 
(particularly through the endoscopic approach for which long-term results are 
currently limited) in the management algorithm of patients with 
microprolactinoma.

INTRODUCTION: Hyperfractionated (HFRT) or accelerated hyperfractionated 
radiotherapy (AHFRT) have been discussed as a potential treatment for 
glioblastoma based on a hypothesized reduction of late radiation injury and 
prevention of repopulation. HFRT and AHFRT have been examined extensively in the 
pre-Temozolomide era with inconclusive results. In this study we examined the 
role of accelerated hyperfractionation in the Temozolomide era.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients who underwent AHFRT (62 of which 
received Temozolomide) were compared to 67 patients who underwent 
normofractionated radiotherapy (NFRT) (64 of which received TMZ) between 02/2009 
and 10/2014. Follow-up data were analyzed until 01/2015.
RESULTS: Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6 months for the entire 
cohort. For patients treated with NFRT median PFS was 7 months, for patients 
treated with AHFRT median PFS was 6 months. Median overall survival (OS) was 13 
months for all patients. For patients treated with NFRT median OS was 15 months, 
for patients treated with AHFRT median OS was 10 months. The fractionation 
regimen was not a predictor of PFS or OS in univariable- or multivariable 
analysis. There was no difference in acute toxicity profiles between the two 
treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Univariable and multivariable analysis did not show significant 
differences between NFRT and AHFRT fractionation regimens in terms of PFS or OS. 
The benefits are immanent: the regimen does significantly shorten 
hospitalization time in a patient collective with highly impaired life 
expectancy. We propose that the role of AHFRT + TMZ should be further examined 
in future prospective trials.

During early vertebrate embryogenesis, cell fate specification is often coupled 
with cell acquisition of specific adhesive, polar and/or motile behaviors. In 
Xenopus gastrulae, tissues fated to form different axial structures display 
distinct motility. The cells in the early organizer move collectively and 
directionally toward the animal pole and contribute to anterior mesendoderm, 
whereas the dorsal and the ventral-posterior trunk tissues surrounding the 
blastopore of mid-gastrula embryos undergo convergent extension and convergent 
thickening movements, respectively. While factors regulating cell lineage 
specification have been described in some detail, the molecular machinery that 
controls cell motility is not understood in depth. To gain insight into the gene 
battery that regulates both cell fates and motility in particular embryonic 
tissues, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate differentially 
expressed genes in the early organizer, the dorsal and the ventral marginal zone 
of Xenopus gastrulae. We uncovered many known signaling and transcription 
factors that have been reported to play roles in embryonic patterning during 
gastrulation. We also identified many uncharacterized genes as well as genes 
that encoded extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or potential regulators of 
actin cytoskeleton. Co-expression of a selected subset of the differentially 
expressed genes with activin in animal caps revealed that they had distinct 
ability to block activin-induced animal cap elongation. Most of these factors 
did not interfere with mesodermal induction by activin, but an ECM protein, 
EFEMP2, inhibited activin signaling and acted downstream of the activated type I 
receptor. By focusing on a secreted protein kinase PKDCC1, we showed with 
overexpression and knockdown experiments that PKDCC1 regulated gastrulation 
movements as well as anterior neural patterning during early Xenopus 
development. Overall, our studies identify many differentially expressed 
signaling and cytoskeleton regulators in different embryonic regions of Xenopus 
gastrulae and imply their functions in regulating cell fates and/or behaviors 
during gastrulation.

Cardiovascular research has made a major contribution to an unprecedented 10 
year increase in life expectancy during the last 50 years: most of this increase 
due to a decline in mortality from heart disease and stroke. The majority of the 
basic cardiovascular science discoveries, which have led to this impressive 
extension of human life, came from investigations conducted in various small and 
large animal models, ranging from mouse to pig. The small animal models are 
currently popular because they are amenable to genetic engineering and are 
relatively inexpensive. The large animal models are favored at the translational 
stage of the investigation, as they are anatomically and physiologically more 
proximal to humans, and can be implanted with various devices; however, they are 
expensive and less amenable to genetic manipulations. With the advent of CRISPR 
genetic engineering technology and the advances in implantable bioelectronics, 
the large animal models will continue to advance. The rabbit model is 
particularly poised to become one of the most popular among the animal models 
that recapitulate human heart diseases. Here we review an array of the rabbit 
models of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as a range of the imaging 
and device technologies enabling these investigations.

Quality of Life and Life Expectancy in Patients with Adrenal Insufficiency: What 
Is True and What Is Urban Myth?

Burger-Stritt S, Pulzer A, Hahner S.

For a long time it has been assumed that patients with chronic adrenal 
insufficiency under established replacement therapy have a normal life 
expectancy and a normal everyday life. Recent studies now indicate both an 
impairment of quality of life (QoL) with a negative impact on daily life and 
increased mortality in a significant number of patients. The clinical 
presentation of patients varies considerably. While some neither suffer from 
reduced QoL nor from adrenal crisis, others are significantly more affected by 
the disease. Long-term management of patients is thus more challenging and goes 
far beyond identification of the correct maintenance dose of corticosteroids. 
The mortality from adrenal crisis is still high and prevention should be a top 
priority for endocrinologists. Concepts of replacement therapy as well as 
patient education and emergency equipment are currently being reassessed. 
Developments to improve patient care and treatment comprise novel glucocorticoid 
preparations that are closer to the physiological circadian cortisol profile, a 
uniform European emergency card and more standardized crisis prevention 
measures.

Fibrosis represents a common pathway to end-stage renal disease. Transforming 
growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a critical role in the progression of kidney 
fibrosis. In the present study, we explored the effect of carnosic acid (CA) 
against TGF-β-induced fibroblast activation in vitro and unilateral ureteral 
obstruction (UUO)-induced kidney fibrosis in vivo. CA attenuated TGF-β-induced 
up-regulation of profibrogenic proteins, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen 
I (COLI), fibronectin (FN), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in 
kidney fibroblast cells (NRK-49F). CA inhibited TGF-β-induced hydrogen peroxide 
generation via inhibition of NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expressions. In mice, 
CA-administration markedly mitigated the UUO-induced interstitial extension, 
collagen deposition, superoxide anion formation, hydrogen peroxide production, 
and lipid peroxidation. In addition, CA significantly attenuated the expression 
of α-SMA, COLI, FN, PAI-1, and Nox4 in UUO-induced kidneys. These results 
indicated that CA attenuated oxidative stress via inhibition of Nox4 expression 
in TGF-β-stimulated fibroblasts and UUO operated-kidneys, suggesting that CA may 
be useful for the treatment of fibrosis-related diseases.

During the last two centuries the average lifespan has increased at a rate of 
approximately 3 months/year in both sexes, hence oldest old people are becoming 
the population with the fastest growth in Western World. Although the average 
life expectancy is increasing dramatically, the healthy lifespan is not going at 
the same pace. This underscores the importance of studies on the prevention of 
age-related diseases, in order to satisfactorily decrease the medical, economic 
and social problems associated to advancing age, related to an increased number 
of individuals not autonomous and affected by invalidating pathologies. In 
particular, data from experimental studies in model organisms have consistently 
shown that nutrient signalling pathways are involved in longevity, affecting the 
prevalence of age-related loss of function, including age-related diseases. 
Accordingly, nutrigerontology is defined as the scientific discipline that 
studies the impact of nutrients, foods, macronutrient ratios, and diets on 
lifespan, ageing process, and age-related diseases. To discuss the potential 
relevance of this new science in the attainment of successful ageing and 
longevity, three original studies performed in Sicily with local foods and two 
reviews have been assembled in this series. Data clearly demonstrate the 
positive effects of nutraceuticals, functional foods and Mediterranean Diet on 
several biological parameters. In fact, they could represent a prevention for 
many age-related diseases, and, although not a solution for this social plague, 
at least a remedy to alleviate it. Thus, the possibility to create a dietary 
pattern, based on the combined strategy of the use of both nutraceuticals and 
functional foods should permit to create a new therapeutic strategy, based not 
only on a specific bioactive molecule or on a specific food but on a integrated 
approach that, starting from the local dietary habits, can be led to a 
"nutrafunctional diet" applicable worldwide.

STUDY DESIGN: Survey.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to objectify the burden of adolescent 
idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) to better advocate for scoliosis care in the future.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: AIS is a common spinal deformity that can affect 
individuals on many levels. Patients with big curves usually seek medical advice 
for surgical correction of their deformity.
METHODS: Participants completed an online questionnaire to help measure the 
health burden of AIS. Three utility outcome measures were then calculated. These 
included the visual analog scale, time trade off, and standard gamble. Student t 
test and linear regression were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: One hundred and ten participants were included in the analysis. The 
mean visual analog scale, time trade off, and standard gamble scores for AIS 
were 0.77 ± 0.16, 0.90 ± 0.11, and 0.91 ± 0.13, respectively. Factors such as 
age, sex, income, and level of education were dependent predictors of utility 
scores for AIS.
CONCLUSION: Our participants demonstrated a significant perceived burden of AIS. 
If faced with AIS, participants were willing to sacrifice 3.6 years of their 
lives and undergo a procedure with 9% mortality rate to gain perfect health. 
Such findings can guide future allocation of resources for better scoliosis care 
and management.

EVALUATION OF LANREOTIDE DEPOT/AUTOGEL EFFICACY AND SAFETY AS A CARCINOID 
SYNDROME TREATMENT (ELECT): A RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED 
TRIAL.

Vinik AI, Wolin EM, Liyanage N, Gomez-Panzani E, Fisher GA; ELECT Study Group *.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lanreotide depot/autogel 120 
mg for the control of carcinoid syndrome (CS) symptoms in patients with 
neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).
METHODS: This was a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial 
(Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00774930). Patients with/without prior somatostatin 
analog (SSA) use were randomized to lanreotide depot/autogel 120 mg or placebo 
every 4 weeks, with access to short-acting octreotide as rescue medication. The 
primary endpoint was the percentage of days in which short-acting octreotide was 
used, which was assessed from daily diaries using an analysis of covariance 
including the stratification variables baseline short-acting octreotide use and 
frequency of diarrhea/flushing. The proportions of patients experiencing 
treatment success was a supportive analysis. Adverse events were recorded at all 
visits.
RESULTS: A total of 115 patients were enrolled (lanreotide, n = 59; placebo, n = 
56). The adjusted mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) percentage of days with 
rescue octreotide use (primary endpoint) was significantly lower in the 
lanreotide (33.7%; 95% CI, 25.0%-42.4%) versus the placebo group (48.5%; 95% CI, 
39.6%-57.4%), representing an absolute difference of -14.8% (95% CI, -26.8% to 
-2.8%; P = .017). The odds ratio of full/partial treatment success (≤3 days 
short-acting octreotide use weeks 12 to 15) was significantly greater with 
lanreotide than placebo (2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.3; P = .036). No new safety concerns 
were identified, and lanreotide was well tolerated.
CONCLUSION: Lanreotide depot/autogel is effective for the control of CS symptoms 
in patients (SSA-naïve or experienced) with NETs.

Better parameters of ventilation-CO₂output relationship predict death in CHF 
patients.

Yao YX, Sun XG, Zheng Z, Wang GZ, Hansen JE, Stringer WW, Wasserman K, Hu SS.

OBJECTIVE: Measures of ventilation-CO₂output relationship have been shown to be 
more prognostic than peak O₂uptake in assessing life expectancy in patients with 
chronic heart failure (CHF). Because both the ratios (VE/Vco₂) and slopes 
(VE-vs-Vco₂) of ventilation-co₂ output of differing durations can be used, we 
aim to ascertain which measurements best predicted CHF life expectancy.
METHODS: Two hundred and seventy-one CHF patients with NYHA class II-IV 
underwent incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and were 
followed-up for a median duration of 479 days. Four different linear regression 
VE-vs- Vco₂ slopes were calculated from warm-up exercise onset to: 180 s, 
anaerobic threshold (AT), ventilatory compensation point (VCP); and peak 
exercise. Five VE/Vco₂ ratios were calculated for the following durations: rest 
(120 s), warm-up (30 s), AT (60 s), lowest value (90 s), and peak exercise (30 
s). Death or heart transplant were considered end-points. Multiple statistical 
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: CHF patients had high lowest VE/Vco₂ (41.0 ± 9.2, 141 ± 30%pred), high 
VE/Vco₂ at AT (42.5 ± 10.4, 145 ± 35%pred), and high VE-vs-Vco₂ slope to VCP 
(37.6 ± 12.1, 126 ± 41%pred). The best predictor of death was a higher lowest 
VE/Vco₂ (≥ 42, ≥ 141%pred), whereas the VE-vs-Vco₂slope to VCP was less variable 
than other slopes. For death prognosis in 6 months, %pred values were superior: 
for longer times, absolute values were superior.
CONCLUSION: The increased lowest VE/Vco₂ ratio easily identifiable and simply 
measured during exercise, is the best measurement to assess the 
ventilation-co₂output relationship in prognosticating death in CHF patients.

['TESTED, BUT NOT TRIED' - WHY IS BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE RARELY IMPLEMENTED IN 
CLINICAL PRACTICE?].

[Article in Hebrew]

Hammerman O, Mostofsky D, Louria Y, Ifergane G, Ezra Y.

BACKGROUND: Behavioral Medicine is an inter-disciplinary field concerned with 
the integration of behavioral and biomedical knowledge for the purposes of 
diagnosis, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of conditions pertaining to 
health and illness. Behavioral treatments (such as: hypnosis, relaxation 
training, meditation, biofeedback and cognitive-behavioral therapy) have been 
shown to be effective in reducing physical symptoms as well as improving 
health-related behaviors and quality of life across a wide variety of illnesses, 
such as: chronic pain, somatic symptoms, diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, 
coronary heart disease and more. The usefulness of behavioral techniques in 
modern medicine has been sufficiently proven so as to have been referred to as 
the "third therapeutic revolution" in treating human illness, after 
pharmacological and surgical treatments.
THE PROBLEM: Despite the fact that the bio-psycho-social model is the dominant 
model in 21st century medicine and despite the plethora of studies demonstrating 
the efficacy of behavioral interventions, these tools are underused in today's 
medical system. The reasons for this have to do with a dichotomous view of mind 
and body rooted in the biomedical approach, which was the dominant paradigm in 
the medical world up until the latter half of the previous century. In 
accordance with this paradigm, diseases were "assigned" either to medicine (i.e. 
they are physiological) or to the mental health professions (i.e. they are 
psychological), but never to both fields simultaneously. As an extension of this 
position, behavioral medicine was not included in Israel's socialized health 
care plan, making the use of behavioral techniques largely impractical, so that 
even physicians who agree with and believe in the importance of the 
bio-psycho-social model are often untrained or unable to provide effective 
behavioral treatments which would address the psycho-social aspects of their 
patients' illness.
DISCUSSION: In Israel today there exist a number of facilities which provide 
behavioral treatments, however, there is, as yet, no public body in charge of 
organizing and promoting the knowledge and use of behavioral medicine in Israel. 
For the sake of patients, physicians and the medical system itself, it is 
imperative that, in the future, medical and paramedical professionals, including 
students and interns, are exposed to and trained in the use of behavioral 
techniques. In addition, thought must be given as to the integration of such 
techniques in routine medical care. For that purpose, we propose a number of 
guiding principles for effectively implementing' behavioral techniques in the 
day-to-day practice of modern; medicine.

The incidence of gastric cancer in the elderly is increasing because of 
increased life expectancy and improved medical care. Gastric cancer in the 
elderly is characterized by specific clinicopathological features, including a 
male-predominance gender tendency, more comorbid diseases, more advanced 
clinical stage, distinct histopathological findings, absence of family history, 
etc. The incidence of surgery-related post-operative complication shows no 
significant difference between elderly and non-elderly patients. However, the 
incidence of non-surgery-related complications is relatively higher in elderly 
patients. Although the overall survival rate of elderly patients is lower, the 
disease-specific survival rate of elderly patients is comparable with 
non-elderly patients. Therefore, surgery is still an effective way to improve 
the prognosis of elderly gastric cancer patients, and care should be taken while 
dealing with the comorbid diseases in elderly gastric cancer patients to improve 
the survival.

Influence of exposure time on toxicity-An overview.

Data on toxicity of chemicals is usually reported as the LD50, or LC50, with the 
exposure time from experimental testing in the laboratory reported. But the 
exposure time is not considered to be a quantifiable variable which can be used 
to evaluate its importance in expressed toxicity, often described in general 
terms such as acute, chronic and so on. For the last hundred years Habers Rule 
has been successfully used to extrapolate from reported exposure times to other 
exposure times which may be needed for setting standards, health risk 
assessments and other applications. But it has limitations particularly in 
environmental applications where exposure levels are low and exposure times are 
relatively long. The Reduced Life Expectancy (RLE) model overcomes these 
problems and can be utilised under all exposure conditions. It can be expressed 
as ln(LT50)=-a (LC50)(ν)+b where the constants ν, a and b can be evaluated by 
fitting the model to experimental data on the LC50, and corresponding LT50, 
together with the Normal Life Expectancy (NLE) of the organism being considered 
as a data point when the LC50 is zero. The constant, ν, at a value of unity 
gives a linear relationship and where ν<1 the relationship has a concave shape. 
In our extensive evaluations of the RLE model for fish, invertebrates and 
mammals involving 115 data sets and with a wide range of organic and inorganic 
toxicants the RLE model gave correlation coefficients of >0.8 with 107 sets of 
data. The RLE model can be used to extrapolate from a limited data set on 
exposure times and corresponding LT50 values to any exposure time and 
corresponding LT50 value. The discrepancy between Haber's Rule and RLE model 
increases as the exposure time increases.

BACKGROUND: A "diet high in sodium" is the second most important dietary risk 
factor for health loss identified in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. We 
therefore aimed to model health gains and costs (savings) of salt reduction 
interventions related to salt substitution and maximum levels in bread, 
including by ethnicity and age. We also ranked these four interventions compared 
to eight other modelled interventions.
METHODS: A Markov macro-simulation model was used to estimate QALYs gained and 
net health system costs for four dietary sodium reduction interventions, 
discounted at 3 % per annum. The setting was New Zealand (NZ) (2.3 million 
adults, aged 35+ years) which has detailed individual-level administrative cost 
data.
RESULTS: The health gain was greatest for an intervention where most (59 %) of 
the sodium in processed foods was replaced by potassium and magnesium salts. 
This intervention gained 294,000 QALYs over the remaining lifetime of the cohort 
(95 % UI: 238,000 to 359,000; 0.13 QALY per 35+ year old). Such salt 
substitution also produced the highest net cost-savings of NZ$ 1.5 billion (US$ 
1.0 billion) (95 % UI: NZ$ 1.1 to 2.0 billion). All interventions generated 
relatively larger per capita QALYs for men vs women and for the indigenous Māori 
population vs non-Māori (e.g., 0.16 vs 0.12 QALYs per adult for the 59 % salt 
substitution intervention). Of relevance to workforce productivity, in the first 
10 years post-intervention, 22 % of the QALY gain was among those aged <65 years 
(and 37 % for those aged <70).
CONCLUSIONS: The benefits are consistent with the international literature, with 
large health gains and cost savings possible from some, but not all, sodium 
reduction interventions. Health gain appears likely to occur among working-age 
adults and all interventions contributed to reducing health inequalities.

BACKGROUND: Parameter uncertainty in value sets of multiattribute utility-based 
instruments (MAUIs) has received little attention previously. This false 
precision leads to underestimation of the uncertainty of the results of 
cost-effectiveness analyses. The aim of this study is to examine the use of 
multiple imputation as a method to account for this uncertainty of MAUI scoring 
algorithms.
METHOD: We fitted a Bayesian model with random effects for respondents and 
health states to the data from the original US EQ-5D-3L valuation study, thereby 
estimating the uncertainty in the EQ-5D-3L scoring algorithm. We applied these 
results to EQ-5D-3L data from the Commonwealth Fund (CWF) Survey for Sick Adults 
( n = 3958), comparing the standard error of the estimated mean utility in the 
CWF population using the predictive distribution from the Bayesian mixed-effect 
model (i.e., incorporating parameter uncertainty in the value set) with the 
standard error of the estimated mean utilities based on multiple imputation and 
the standard error using the conventional approach of using MAUI (i.e., ignoring 
uncertainty in the value set).
RESULT: The mean utility in the CWF population based on the predictive 
distribution of the Bayesian model was 0.827 with a standard error (SE) of 
0.011. When utilities were derived using the conventional approach, the 
estimated mean utility was 0.827 with an SE of 0.003, which is only 25% of the 
SE based on the full predictive distribution of the mixed-effect model. Using 
multiple imputation with 20 imputed sets, the mean utility was 0.828 with an SE 
of 0.011, which is similar to the SE based on the full predictive distribution.
CONCLUSION: Ignoring uncertainty of the predicted health utilities derived from 
MAUIs could lead to substantial underestimation of the variance of mean 
utilities. Multiple imputation corrects for this underestimation so that the 
results of cost-effectiveness analyses using MAUIs can report the correct degree 
of uncertainty.

PURPOSE: Accurate illness understanding enables patients to make informed 
decisions. Evidence of the influence of prognostic discussions on the accuracy 
of illness understanding by patients would demonstrate the value of discussions.
METHODS: Recent and past oncology provider-patient discussions about 
prognosis/life expectancy were examined for their association with changes in 
illness understanding by patients. Patients (N = 178) with advanced cancers 
refractory to prior chemotherapy whom oncologists expected to die within 6 
months were interviewed before and after a visit in which cancer restaging scan 
results were discussed. Illness understanding scores were the sum of four 
indicator variables: patient terminal illness acknowledgment, recognition of 
incurable disease status, knowledge of the advanced stage of the disease, and 
expectation to live months as opposed to years.
RESULTS: Before the restaging scan visit, nine (5%) of 178 patients had 
completely accurate illness understanding (ie, correctly answered each of the 
four illness understanding questions). Eighteen patients (10%) reported only 
recent discussions of prognosis/life expectancy with their oncologists; 68 (38%) 
reported only past discussions; 24 (13%) reported both recent and past 
discussions; and 68 (38%) reported that they never had discussions of 
prognosis/life expectancy with their oncologists. After adjustment for potential 
confounders (ie, education and race/ethnicity), analysis identified significant, 
positive changes in illness understanding scores for patients in groups that 
reported recent only (least-squares mean change score, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.23 to 
1.01; P = .002) and both recent and past (least-squares mean change score, 0.37; 
95% CI, 0.04 to 0.70; P = 0.028) discussions of prognosis/life expectancy with 
their oncologists.
CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced cancer who report recent discussions of 
prognosis/life expectancy with their oncologists come to have a better 
understanding of the terminal nature of their illnesses.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common and aggressive primary 
brain tumors, composing 12-20% of all the intracranial tumors in adults with a 
highly malignant course and average life expectancy of approximately 12-14 
months following initial diagnosis. Leptomeningeal or intramedullary metastasis 
from primary GBM is a rare phenomenon with a poor prognosis. We present a rare 
case of GBM with late onset intramedullary, extramedullary, as well as 
leptomeningeal spinal metastasis.

To provide an update of the latest trends in epidemiology, clinical course, 
diagnostics, complications and treatment of auto immune hepatitis (AIH). A 
search of the MEDLINE database was performed using the search terms: "auto 
immune hepatitis", "clinical presentation", "symptoms", "signs", "diagnosis", 
"auto antibodies", "laboratory values", "serology", "histopathology", 
"histology", "genetics", "HLA genes", "non-HLA genes", "environment", 
"epidemiology", "prevalence", "incidence", "demographics", "complications", 
"HCC", "PBC", "PSC", "corticosteroid", "therapy", "treatment", "alternative 
treatment". English-language full-text articles and abstracts were considered. 
Articles included reviews, meta-analysis, prospective retrospective studies. No 
publication date restrictions were applied. AIH is an immune meditated 
progressive inflammatory liver disease that predominantly affects middle-aged 
females but may affect people of all ages. The clinical spectrum of AIH is wide, 
ranging from absent or mild symptoms to fulminant hepatic failure. The aetiology 
of AIH is still unknown, but is believed to occur as the consequence of an 
aberrant immune response towards an un-known trigger in a genetically 
susceptible host. In the absence of a gold standard, diagnosis is based on the 
combination of clinical, biochemical and histopathological criteria. 
Immunosuppressive treatment has been the cornerstone of treatment since the 
earliest description of the disease in 1950 by Waldenström. Such treatment is 
often successful at inducing remission and generally leads to normal life 
expectancy. Nevertheless, there remain significant areas of unmet aetiological a 
clinical needs including fundamental insight in disease pathogenesis, optimal 
therapy, duration of treatment and treatment alternatives in those patients 
unresponsive to standard treatment regimens.
