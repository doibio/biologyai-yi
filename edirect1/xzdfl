FINDINGS: Between June 15, 2015, and Jan 30, 2019, 1422 patients were recruited 
from 17 hospitals in England. The median age of the patients was 69 years (IQR 
62-76), and the most common primary tumour was prostate cancer (406 [28·6%] 
patients). Median follow-up was 13 months (IQR 6-23). Overall survival was 92·3% 
(95% CI 90·5-93·9) at 1 year and 79·2% (76·0-82·1) at 2 years. The most common 
grade 3 adverse event was fatigue (28 [2·0%] of 1422 patients) and the most 
common serious (grade 4) event was increased liver enzymes (nine [0·6%]). 
Notreatment-related deaths were reported.
INTERPRETATION: In patients with extracranial oligometastatic cancer, use of 
SABR was associated with high overall survival and low toxicity. 'The study 
findings complement existing evidence from a randomised, phase 2 trial, and 
represent high-level, real-world evidence supporting the use of SABR in this 
patient cohort, with a phase 3 randomised, controlled trial to confirm these 
findings underway. Based on the selection criteria in this study, SABR was 
commissioned by NHS England in March, 2020, as a treatment option for patients 
with oligometastatic disease.
FUNDING: NHS England Commissioning through Evaluation scheme.

BACKGROUND: Based on current evidence, one-time screening for abdominal aortic 
aneurysm (AAA) in men using ultrasound evaluation reduces mortality related to 
AAA rupture and is considered cost-effective, although all-cause mortality 
reduction still remains in question. In Spain, there is no population screening 
program for AAA, so the aim of our study was to perform a pilot population 
screening program in our area to assess feasibility and efficiency of an AAA 
screening program for men and women.
METHODS: A population AAA screening pilot program was performed in a Barcelona 
area, including 400,000 inhabitants. According to inclusion criteria, 4,730 
individuals aged 65 years at the moment of the trial were invited for screening 
(2,089 men and 2,641 women). Primary care doctors, trained in duplex ultrasound 
abdominal evaluations, performed an abdominal aortic measurement. Individuals 
with a previous diagnosis of AAA, limited life expectancy, or wrong contact data 
were excluded. Participation data, aortic diameters, AAA prevalence, and related 
cardiovascular risk factors were analyzed. The results were used in a 
cost-utility model to assess the efficiency of the screening program.
RESULTS: Participation was 50.3% in men and 44% in women. Eleven patients were 
excluded because of previously diagnosed AAA. Five new asymptomatic AAA were 
detected in 65-year-old men (0.5% prevalence), all being active smokers. When 
considering patients excluded for previous AAA diagnosis, the prevalence in 
65-year-old men reached 1.4%. Global AAA prevalence in smoking men reached 
2.67%. No AAA was detected in women. Subaneurysmal aorta prevalence in men was 
2.9% (n = 29), and in women, it was 0.08% (n = 2). A cost-utility analysis model 
on screening versus no screening retrieved 13,664€ per quality-adjusted life 
years at a 10-year horizon and 39,455€ per quality-adjusted life years at a 
30-year horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: AAA population-based screening by ultrasound evaluation in primary 
care is logistically feasible in our area. Despite that, AAA prevalence is lower 
than expected in men, and null in women. Cost-utility model results indicate 
that a local AAA screening program is only efficient in a 30 years' time 
horizon. Such inefficient results for a population screening make it necessary 
to consider other strategies such as opportunistic or subgroup screening in our 
area.

This case highlights the unusual life-threatening findings found in a patient 
with Marfan syndrome (MFS) in the emergency department setting. MFS is a rare 
autosomal dominant disease that affects 1 in 3000-5000 individuals and has a 
highly variable range of clinical severity. This case is a 63-year-old male with 
COPD, scoliosis, aortic and mitral valve replacements on warfarin, and MFS who 
presented with acute onset hemoptysis, tachypnea, and oxygen saturation of 77% 
on 4 l nasal cannula. Emergent chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) 
revealed both a contained rupture of a left subclavian artery aneurysm and 
active extravasation from his left internal mammary artery (LIMA) into his left 
chest. The patient was on warfarin and reversed with IV vitamin K and 
prothrombin complex concentrate. Vascular surgery emergently took the patient to 
the operating room for embolization of his LIMA and stenting of the contained 
ruptured left subclavian artery aneurysm. The patient was discharged home one 
month after admission. This case report illustrates the potential severe 
sequelae of MFS and the importance of rapid recognition by emergency physicians. 
An expanded understanding of the pathophysiology of MFS has resulted in great 
advancement in medical therapies and lifestyle modification and thus has 
significantly prolonged life expectancy in these patients. Increased awareness 
and familiarity will facilitate continued high-quality management and treatment 
by emergency physicians.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Neonatal onset Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) can be life 
threatening with severe hyperammonemia and poor neurological outcomes. Glycerol 
phenylbutyrate (GPB) is safe and effective in reducing ammonia levels in 
patients with UCD above 2 months of age. This study assesses safety, ammonia 
control and pharmacokinetics (PK) of GPB in UCD patients below 2 months of age.
METHODS: This was an open-label study in UCD patients aged 0 - 2 months, 
consisting of an initiation/transition period (1 - 4 days) to GPB, followed by a 
safety extension period (6 months to 2 years). Patients presenting with a 
hyperammonemic crisis (HAC) did not initiate GPB until blood ammonia levels 
decreased to below 100 µmol/L while receiving sodium phenylacetate/sodium 
benzoate and/or hemodialysis. Ammonia levels, PK analytes and safety were 
evaluated during transition and monthly during the safety extension for 6 months 
and every 3 months thereafter.
RESULTS: All 16 patients with UCD (median age 0.48 months, range 0.1 to 2.0 
months) successfully transitioned to GPB within 3 days. Average plasma ammonia 
level excluding HAC was 94.3 µmol/L at baseline and 50.4 µmol/L at the end of 
the transition period (p = 0.21). No patient had a HAC during the transition 
period. During the safety extension, the majority of patients had controlled 
ammonia levels, with mean plasma ammonia levels lower during GPB treatment than 
baseline. Mean glutamine levels remained within normal limits throughout the 
study. PK analyses indicate that UCD patients <2 months are able to hydrolyze 
GPB with subsequent absorption of phenylbutyric acid (PBA), metabolism to 
phenylacetic acid (PAA) and conjugation with glutamine. Plasma concentrations of 
PBA, PAA, and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN) were stable during the safety 
extension phase and mean plasma phenylacetic acid: phenylacetylglutamine ratio 
remained below 2.5 suggesting no accumulation of GPB. All patients reported at 
least 1 treatment emergent adverse event with gastroesophageal reflux disease, 
vomiting, hyperammonemia, diaper dermatitis (37.5% each), diarrhea, upper 
respiratory tract infection and rash (31.3% each) being the most frequently 
reported.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports safety and efficacy of GPB in UCD patients aged 
0 -2 months who cannot be managed by dietary protein restriction and/or amino 
acid supplementation alone. GPB undergoes intestinal hydrolysis with no 
accumulation in this population.

BACKGROUND: Self-regulation is an important process to explain sexual, 
emotional, and pain-related responses in the context of genital pain. Although 
highly relevant, self-regulatory focus theory is not well integrated into the 
literature on genital pain.
AIM: This study explored the impact of a promotion and prevention regulatory 
focus on genital pain responding. Sex would typically endorse a promotion focus, 
whereas pain during sex is likely to provoke a prevention focus oriented toward 
harm avoidance and safety.
METHOD: We induced gradually increasing vaginal pressure in a sample of 56 women 
using an intra-vaginal balloon that simulated potentially painful vaginal 
sensations. Women were first primed with a promotion vs prevention focus by 
making them list their ideals vs responsibilities as a sexual partner. We 
measured trait regulatory focus, pleasant and painful vaginal pressure 
sensations, sexual arousal, expectations, and approach-avoidance motivational 
tendencies.
MAIN OUTCOME: The effect of trait and state promotion and prevention regulatory 
focuses on the appraisal of vaginal pressure and sexual arousal.
RESULTS: When primed with a prevention compared with a promotion focus, women 
with a predominant prevention orientation reported less sexual arousal, less 
pleasant vaginal pressure appraisals, and lower approach tendencies regarding 
sexual stimuli. Women who experienced a match between their state and trait 
promotion focus appraised the vaginal pressure as less painful. No significant 
effects of regulatory focus were found on the expectancy measures.
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: We provided first evidence on self-regulatory 
motivation in the context of genital pain responses using an experimentally 
controlled laboratory design. Our sample was small and consisted of young 
students without (a clinical diagnosis of) genital pain, which limits our 
conclusions on the effect of promotion vs prevention regulation on genital pain 
responses.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Future research is needed to examine the clinical value 
of self-regulation and regulatory fit and to identify possible ways to target 
self-regulatory motivation in clinical interventions of genital pain.
CONCLUSION: Self-regulatory focus theory has clear potential to explain the 
sexual and motivational correlates of genital pain. Dewitte M and Kindermans H.

Smoke-free legislation reduced second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure in public 
places, and indirectly promoted private smoke-free settings. Nevertheless, a 
large proportion of adults is still exposed to SHS at home. The aim of this 
paper is to quantify the burden of disease due to home SHS exposure among adults 
in the 28-European Union (EU) countries for year 2017. The burdens by gender 
from lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), breast cancer, 
ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, asthma, and diabetes were estimated in an 
original research analysis using the comparative risk assessment method. 
Relative risks of death/diseases by gender for adults exposed to SHS at home 
compared to not exposed ones were estimated updating existing meta-analyses. 
Prevalence of home SHS exposure by gender was estimated using a multiple 
imputation procedure based on Eurobarometer surveys. Data on mortality and 
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were obtained from the Global Burden of 
Disease, Injuries and Risk Factors Study. In 2017, 526,000 DALYs (0.36% of total 
DALYs) and 24,000 deaths (0.46% of total deaths) were attributable to home SHS 
exposure in the 28-EU countries, mainly from COPD and IHD. South-Eastern EU 
countries showed the highest burden, with proportion of DALYs/deaths 
attributable to SHS exposure on total higher than 0.50%/0.70%, whereas northern 
EU-countries showed the lowest burden, with proportions of DALYs/deaths lower 
than 0.25%/0.34%. The burden from SHS exposure is still significant in EU 
countries. More could be done to raise awareness of the health risks associated 
with SHS exposure at home.

Pyriproxyfen is a biorational insecticide from IGR family, used worldwide 
against several economic pests. To evaluate the risk of pyriproxyfen resistance 
in dusky cotton bug, Oxycarenus hyalinipennis Costa (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae), a 
major concern for cotton producers, and to formulate strategies effective to 
tackle resistance, a field collected population was selected with pyriproxyfen 
under laboratory conditions using seed-dip method. A resistant strain designated 
as Pyr-SEL (G18) was developed after repeatedly selecting O. hyalinipennis with 
pyriproxyfen over eighteen generations. Thereafter, fitness costs, realized 
heritability (h2) and cross-resistance were investigated. As a result of 
selection, Pyr-SEL (G18) developed a very high level of resistance (resistance 
ratio = 464.23-fold) compared with the susceptible strain unselected over twenty 
generations Un-SEL (G20). The Pyr-SEL (G18) conferred strong cross-resistance to 
bifenthrin (146.59-fold), lambda-cyhalothrin (132.96-fold) and fenoxycarb 
(91.06-fold), whereas showed moderate cross-resistance to diafenthiuron 
(28.86-fold) and fipronil (22.73-fold). The h2 estimate was 0.16 in Pyr-SEL 
(G18). The developmental duration of O. hyalinipennis pre-adult prolonged, but 
traits of λ, r and R0 reduced in Pyr-SEL (G18) compared with the Un-SEL (G20). 
Also, the population projection obtained lower population size for Pyr-SEL (G18) 
than Un-SEL (G20). Fitness studies revealed that high resistance development to 
pyriproxyfen lowered the relative fitness of Pyr-SEL (G18) (Rf = 0.38) compared 
with the Un-SEL (G20). These findings may be practically valuable in tackling 
O. hyalinipennis resistance for better pest management.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older adults suffering from multimorbidity represent 
a priority target group for patient-centeredness (PC). We aimed to investigate 
the transferability of an existing integrated model of PC comprising 15 
dimensions on the care of older adults with multimorbidity from an expert 
perspective.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 242 experts were invited to participate 
in a 2-round online Delphi study. In round 1, they were asked to (a) 
individually rate relevance and clarity of the dimensions, (b) add missing 
dimensions, and (c) prioritize the dimensions. In round 2, experts received 
results of round 1 and were asked to rerate their ratings.
RESULTS: Forty-eight experts participated in round 1 and 39 in round 2. Ten 
dimensions were rated as sufficiently relevant and clear, including one new 
dimension ("prognosis and life expectancy, burden of treatment"). Four 
dimensions were rated as relevant but insufficiently clear. One dimension failed 
to reach our validation threshold on both criteria. The 5 dimensions rated as 
most important were: "patient as a unique person," "clinician-patient 
communication," "patient involvement in care," "physical, cognitive, and 
emotional support," and "involvement of family and friends."
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The experts' ratings were higher regarding 
relevance than regarding clarity, which emphasizes the still existing conceptual 
uncertainty of PC. Our results give further directions regarding the 
operationalization of PC in older adults with multimorbidity, which is essential 
for its implementation in routine care. Further refined using focus groups with 
geriatric patients, our adapted model serves as a basis for a systematic review 
of assessment instruments.

BACKGROUND: Primary malignant brain tumor is a severe disease with a poor 
prognosis causing reduced life expectancy and possible alteration in the 
perception of time. The aim of this study was to gain deeper insight into the 
perception of time from the perspective of patients with brain cancer as they 
pass through the Danish Integrated Brain Cancer Pathway at a university hospital 
in Denmark.
METHODS: Data were generated by shadowing six patients and relatives during 
their visit to and hospitalisation in a neurosurgical department.
RESULTS: Through one constructed case, three perspectives of time were 
identified. The patient's perception of time during his illness, the healthcare 
system's perception of time and, finally, an ethical time perspective. The 
analysis showed a discrepancy between patients' and healthcare professionals' 
perception of time. Furthermore, the results revealed an ethical time dimension.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings contribute to a better understanding of the perception 
of time among seriously ill patients and may further healthcare professionals' 
awareness of how to support patients in achieving a more meaningful use of their 
remaining lifetime.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer survivors may experience multiple comorbidities related to 
the disease itself and adverse effects from treatment. Rehabilitation 
specialists could provide treatment options; however, oncologic rehabilitation 
services are underutilized.
OBJECTIVE: To assess oncologists' awareness of the benefits of rehabilitation 
for cancer care patients and to identify barriers to rehabilitation referrals in 
adult cancer patients in Puerto Rico.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Regional Annual Meeting of the Association of Medical Hematology and 
Oncology of Puerto Rico, 4-7 September 2015.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two oncologists.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants completed a 10-item questionnaire focused on 
demographics, knowledge, and clinical practices over the previous 12 months 
related to rehabilitation in cancer patients.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency, reasons, and timing for oncologist referral of 
cancer patients to rehabilitation. Perceived risks and benefits of 
rehabilitation in cancer patients and their correlation to patient referrals, 
prognosis, type of cancer, and type of symptoms.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven oncologists (88.1%) received minimal or no education about 
cancer rehabilitation, its benefits, and indications. This resulted in 31 
oncologists (73.8%) referring less than 15% of their patients for 
rehabilitation, with almost a third of participants referring less than 5%. 
However, 39 (92.9%) agreed that rehabilitation is always or frequently 
beneficial for their patients. Fifteen (35.7%) said they did not refer patients 
if prognosis was less than 6 months, and 16 (38.0%) avoided referring patients 
with life expectancy of less than 3 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Although medical oncologists have some knowledge that 
rehabilitation is beneficial for their patients, there is a low referral rate. 
This could be due to lack of information about cancer rehabilitation and limited 
access to cancer rehabilitation specialists. Further efforts should be made to 
improve access to rehabilitation care for cancer patients and survivors.

Caloric restriction (CR) has been shown to extend the lifespan of many species. 
Research to identify compounds that imitate the results of CR has shown 
extensions of both lifespan and healthspan via different mechanisms. For 
example, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors such as rapamycin, 
phenols, and flavonoids show antioxidant characteristics, while spermidine 
induces autophagy. Herein, we summarize research progress and proposed 
mechanisms for the most well-known compounds showing lifespan-extending 
potential for anti-aging characteristics.

PURPOSE: To examine the psychometric properties of a parent-report measure of 
engagement in pediatric rehabilitation.
METHOD: 113 parents (of children 4 months to 18 years, varying in diagnoses) 
were recruited from standard outpatient/inpatient, early intervention, and life 
skills programs, sampled from different sites in Canada, the US, and Australia. 
Parents completed the Pediatric Rehabilitation Intervention Measure of 
Engagement-Parent version (PRIME-P) twice, after two therapy sessions 
approximately two weeks apart. Analyses examined factor structure, internal 
consistency, and test-retest reliability, and assessed construct validity 
hypotheses concerning participant characteristics and contextual factors.
RESULTS: The resulting 11-item PRIME-P has three factors capturing engagement in 
terms of Plan Appropriateness, Partnering, and Positive Outcome Expectancy. The 
factors displayed strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability 
(Partnering demonstrated slightly weaker test-retest reliability). Construct 
validity was shown by significant associations between the PRIME-P scales and 
parents' presence versus absence during the sessions, as well as service 
providers' years of experience.
CONCLUSIONS: The PRIME-P captures parent engagement as a multifaceted construct 
involving appropriateness of the therapy plan, a sense of active partnership in 
the intervention process, and an expectation for a positive outcome. The PRIME-P 
has promise for research, clinical practice, and educational 
purposes.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThe PRIME-P is a psychometrically sound 
tool that fills a gap in how researchers and practitioners can measure the 
engagement of parents in the therapy process.To enhance parent engagement, 
service providers can encourage collaboration in planning, foster a sense of 
working in partnership, and convey a sense of hope.The findings point to the 
need to pay attention to parents' beliefs about the therapy plan and outcomes, 
in addition to their behavioral involvement.The PRIME-P is a promising tool for 
pediatric rehabilitation that can be used to investigate the role of a crucial, 
yet poorly understood variable in the therapy process.

Gliomas are primary brain tumors originating from glial cells, representing 30% 
of all Central Nervous System (CNS) neoplasia. Among them, the astrocytoma grade 
IV (glioblastoma multiforme) is the most common, presenting an invasive and 
aggressive profile, with an estimated life expectancy of about 15 months after 
diagnosis even after treatment with radiation, surgical resection, and 
chemotherapy. This poor prognosis is related to the presence of the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) and multidrug resistance mechanisms that prevent the uptake and 
retention of chemotherapeutics inside the brain. Gene therapy has been a 
promising strategy to overcome these treatment limitations since it has the 
ability to modify the defective genetic information in tumor cells, being able 
to induce cellular apoptosis and silence the genes responsible for multidrug 
resistance. Lipidbased nanoparticles, non-viral vectors, have been investigated 
to deliver genes across the BBB to reach the glioma cell target. Besides, their 
low immunogenicity, easy production, ability to incorporate ligands to specific 
target cells, and capacity to carry higher size genes have made the gene therapy 
based on non-viral vectors a promising glioma treatment. In this context, this 
review addresses the most common non-viral vectors based on lipid-based 
nanoparticles used for glioma gene therapy, such as liposomes, solid lipid 
nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and nanoemulsions.

COVID-19 pandemic is causing an unprecedented burden on healthcare resources and 
this includes treatment of heart failure and valvular heart diseases (VHD). 
Percutaneous procedures have broadened the number of patients with VHD who could 
be treated. However, COVID-19 pandemic has challenged their implementation. The 
risk of in-hospital infection, resources reallocation, reduced access to 
hospital caused a substantial delay of VHD treatment with an increased risk of 
clinical worsening and mortality. Now, the pandemic is not ended and subsequent 
waves are likely. Reorganization of our healthcare resources is needed, 
including a proper algorithm for patients' prioritization, based on the severity 
of their valve disease, their life expectancy, complexity of the intervention, 
and the resources available. A wider use of telemedicine for patients' selection 
and follow-up and any measurement that can shorten the duration of the hospital 
stay must be adopted. Patients' and healthcare staff screening for COVID-19 and 
all needed procedures to prevent infection will continue to be mandatory. 
Percutaneous procedures, compared to surgery, are associated with a lower risk 
of infection and a lower need for in-hospital resources, including a shorter 
duration of hospital stay. This may favour their adoption when the risk of viral 
infection is high.

Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have a shorter life expectancy 
than the general population primarily due to cardiovascular comorbidities. 
Objectives: To characterize arterial aging in RA. Patients and Methods: Coronary 
calcium score (CCS) were available from 112 RA patients; out of these patients, 
follow-up CCS were measured for 54 randomly selected individuals. Control CCS 
were obtained from the MESA database (includes 6,000 < participants); arterial 
age was calculated from CCS. Results: RA patients were significantly older 
(10.45 ± 18.45 years, p < 0.001) in terms of the arterial age than the age-, 
gender-, and race-matched controls. The proportion of RA patients who had zero 
CCS was significantly less (p < 0.01) than that of those in the MESA reference 
group. Each disease year contributed an extra 0.395 years (p < 0.01) on the top 
of the normal aging process. However, the rate of the accelerated aging is not 
uniform, in the first years of the disease it is apparently faster. Smoking (p < 
0.05), previous cardiovascular events (p < 0.05), and high blood pressure (p < 
0.05) had additional significant effect on the aging process. In the follow-up 
study, inflammatory disease activity (CRP > 5 mg/L, p < 0.05) especially in 
smokers and shorter than 10 years of disease duration (p = 0.05) had the largest 
impact. Conclusion: Arterial aging is faster in RA patients than in control 
subjects, particularly in the first 10 years of the disease. Inflammation, 
previous cardiovascular events, and smoking are additional contributing factors 
to the intensified coronary atherosclerosis progression. These data support that 
optimal control of inflammation is essential to attenuate the cardiovascular 
risk in RA.

CX3CL1 is a transmembrane protein from which a soluble form can be generated by 
proteolytic shedding. Membranal and soluble forms of CX3CL1 exhibit different 
functions, although both bind to the CX3CR1 chemokine receptor. The 
CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis mediates the adhesion of leukocytes and is also involved in 
cell survival and recruitment of immune cell subpopulations. The function of 
CX3CL1 is finely tuned by cytokines and transcription factors regulating its 
expression and post-translational modifications. On homeostasis, the 
CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis participates in the removal of damaged neurons and 
neurogenesis, and it is also involved on several pathological contexts. The 
CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis induces several cellular responses relevant to cancer such as 
proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis resistance. In this review, we 
address biological aspects of this molecular axis with important therapeutic 
potential, emphasizing its role in cancer, one of the most prevalent chronic 
diseases which significantly affect the quality of life and life expectancy of 
patients.

Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) account for 3%-5% of all intracranial 
tumors. They commonly manifest during first two decades of life. We are 
reporting a case of a young female, who presented with progressive visual loss, 
polyuria and polydipsia, harboring an intracranial GCT. She presented initially 
to a neurosurgery clinic and then to an endocrine clinic, with a history 
of chronic worsening headache and recent onset visual blurring along with 
polyuria with polydipsia. On further inquiry, she was found to have primary 
amenorrhea, easy fatigability, and failure of development of secondary sexual 
characteristics. On examination the patient had bitemporal hemianopia with 
breast development at tanner stage II and pubic and axillary hair at tanner 
stage I. Her initial hormonal workup was suggestive of panhypopituitarism with 
diabetes insipidus. MRI pituitary showed a sellar mass with suprasellar 
extension, so an initial impression of a pituitary macroadenoma was made and the 
patient underwent trans-sphenoidal surgery. The histopathology was suggestive of 
lymphoid hyperplasia. Follow up MRI showed significant residual tumor and her 
vision and pituitary function did not recover. Neurosurgery was planned as 
second surgery, but we requested a second opinion of histopathology report and 
it was suggestive of a germinoma. She was then started on chemotherapy followed 
by radiotherapy, after which her tumor size reduced significantly, though she 
still required pituitary hormone replacement therapy.  Pituitary stalk lesions 
are rare and their diagnosis is challenging as different etiologies 
present clinically and radiologically in a similar manner with tissue diagnosis 
being the gold standard. Germinoma is a radiosensitive tumor. In our patient it 
took a long time to reach the correct diagnosis and late diagnosis resulted in 
permanent visual field defect and panhypopituitarism. This case report 
emphasizes that we should guide and educate our patients to seek medical advice 
early in the course of disease. We should also keep differential diagnosis in 
mind before referring the patient for surgery.

CHARGE syndrome with chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 7 (CDH7) gene 
mutation is a genetic disease with an autosomal dominant gene. This syndrome 
involves a combination of six congenital anomalies (heart anomalies, coloboma of 
the eye, retardation of the growth or development, atresia of the choana, ear 
anomalies, and genital anomalies). Here, we present a case of a 15-month-old 
male child who was born to a 23-year-old healthy mother with no history of any 
exposure to teratogenic materials or drugs. The patient was delivered by 
cesarean section because of the failure of progression at 39 weeks of pregnancy 
with several health problems that started with the respiratory system right 
after birth. On examination, he was found to be suffering from several 
congenital anomalies, including heart, face, eyes, ears, and genitalia. A 
genetic analysis was performed for the patient, and a mutation in the CDH7 gene 
was found. The patient was diagnosed as a sporadic case of CHARGE syndrome. The 
patient's treatment plan is a multidisciplinary team effort to alleviate his 
quality of life and further increase life expectancy.

Intervertebral discs (IVDs) are often referred to as the largest avascular 
structures of the human body, yet a collective resource characterizing the 
vascularization of the IVD does not exist. To address this gap, the objective of 
this study was to conduct a comprehensive search of the literature to review and 
summarize current knowledge of the prevalence and localization of blood supply 
in human IVDs, with a scoping review. A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed 
publications on the topic of IVD vascularization in humans was conducted across 
six electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and 
BIOSIS Previews. Studies of humans were included regardless of age, sex, 
ethnicity, and health status, with the exception of IVD herniation. Two 
independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts and full-texts according to 
eligibility criteria. The review was conducted and reported according to 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews Extension for Scoping Reviews 
guidelines. Our search yielded 3122 articles, with 22 articles meeting the 
inclusion criteria. The study samples ranged in age from fetal to >90 years and 
included both sexes, various health statuses, and used different methodologies 
(eg, histology, medical imaging, and gross dissection) to assess vasculature. 
Overall, consistent observations were that (a) the nucleus pulposus of the IVD 
is avascular throughout life, (b) both the cartilage endplates and annulus 
fibrosus receive considerable blood supply early in life that diminishes over 
the lifespan, and (c) vascular ingrowth into the cartilage endplates and inner 
layers of the annulus fibrosus is commonly associated with damaged or disrupted 
tissue, irrespective of age. Histology and immunohistochemistry are often used 
to report vascularization of the IVD. The body of the current literature 
suggests that the IVD should not be generalized as an avascular tissue. Instead, 
vascularization of the IVD differs based on the constituent tissues, their age, 
and state of degeneration or damage.
