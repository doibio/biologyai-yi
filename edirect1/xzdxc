BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is a major cause of frailty, which relates to 
nutrition-related, physical, and social factors. In this study, we aimed to 
discuss the cross-sectional association of sarcopenia with the above three 
factors both individually and comprehensively.
METHODS: Overall, 1257 older adults (≥65 years old) participated in this study. 
Sarcopenia was determined via the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 
criteria. The independent variables for nutrition-related, physical, and social 
factors and especially their criteria for health condition were defined 
separately. Binomial logistic regression analysis was carried out to testify the 
associations of sarcopenia with three factors individually and in combination.
RESULTS: The mean age was 74.6 (±5.5), and women were 47.7%. Sarcopenia 
prevalence was 7.5%. Participants who did not meet the criteria of nutritional 
health, physical fitness, or social robustness independently had significant 
associations with a higher adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of sarcopenia or its 
indices of lower grip strength, muscle mass, or gait speed. In comparison to 
participants meeting three criteria, those who met two, one, or none showed 
(marginally) significant association with increased aOR for sarcopenia (aOR (95% 
confidence interval)): two: 1.97 (0.84-4.64); one: 2.35 (1.00-5.23); none: 5.52 
(2.30-13.23).
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive countermeasures with the above three factors are 
indispensable for sarcopenia prevention.

Cancer is still one of the most widespread diseases globally, it is considered a 
vital health challenge worldwide and one of the main barriers to long life 
expectancy. Due to the potential toxicity and lack of selectivity of 
conventional chemotherapeutic agents, discovering alternative treatments is a 
top priority. Plant-derived natural products have high potential in cancer 
treatment due to their multiple mechanisms of action, diversity in structure, 
availability in nature, and relatively low toxicity. In this review, the 
anticancer mechanisms of the most common phytochemicals were analyzed. 
Furthermore, a detailed discussion of the anticancer effect of combinations 
consisting of natural product or natural products with chemotherapeutic drugs 
was provided. This review should provide a strong platform for researchers and 
clinicians to improve basic and clinical research in the development of 
alternative anticancer medicines.

Dextran, a renewable hydrophilic polysaccharide, is nontoxic, highly stable but 
intrinsically biodegradable. The α-1, 6 glycosidic bonds in dextran are attacked 
by dextranase (E.C. 3.2.1.11) which is an inducible enzyme. Dextranase finds 
many applications such as, in sugar industry, in the production of human plasma 
substitutes, and for the treatment and prevention of dental plaque. Currently, 
dextranases are obtained from terrestrial fungi which have longer duration for 
production but not very tolerant to environmental conditions and have safety 
concerns. Marine bacteria have been proposed as an alternative source of these 
enzymes and can provide prospects to overcome these issues. Indeed, marine 
bacterial dextranases are reportedly more effective and suitable for dental 
caries prevention and treatment. Here, we focused on properties of dextran, 
properties of dextran-hydrolyzing enzymes, particularly from marine sources and 
the biochemical features of these enzymes. Lastly the potential use of these 
marine bacterial dextranase to remove dental plaque has been discussed. The 
review covers dextranase-producing bacteria isolated from shrimp, fish, algae, 
sea slit, and sea water, as well as from macro- and micro fungi and other 
microorganisms. It is common knowledge that dextranase is used in the sugar 
industry; produced as a result of hydrolysis by dextranase and have prebiotic 
properties which influence the consistency and texture of food products. In 
medicine, dextranases are used to make blood substitutes. In addition, 
dextranase is used to produce low molecular weight dextran and cytotoxic 
dextran. Furthermore, dextranase is used to enhance antibiotic activity in 
endocarditis. It has been established that dextranase from marine bacteria is 
the most preferable for removing plaque, as it has a high enzymatic activity. 
This study lays the groundwork for the future design and development of 
different oral care products, based on enzymes derived from marine bacteria.

Heavy metals and metalloids like cadmium, arsenic, mercury, and lead are 
frequently found in the soil, water, food, and atmosphere; trace amounts can 
cause serious health issues to the human organism. These toxic trace elements 
(TTE) affect almost all the organs, mainly the heart, kidney, liver, lungs, and 
the nervous system, through increased free radical formation, DNA damage, lipid 
peroxidation, and protein sulfhydryl depletion. This work aims to advance our 
understanding of the mechanisms behind lipid accumulation via increased free 
fatty acid levels in circulation due to TTEs. The increased lipid level in the 
myocardium worsens the heart function. This dysregulation of the lipid 
metabolism leads to damage in the structure of the myocardium, inclusive 
fibrosis in cardiac tissue, myocyte apoptosis, and decreased contractility due 
to mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, it is discussed herein how exposure 
to cadmium decreases the heart rate, contractile tension, the conductivity of 
the atrioventricular node, and coronary flow rate. Arsenic may induce 
atherosclerosis by increasing platelet aggregation and reducing fibrinolysis, as 
exposure interferes with apolipoprotein (Apo) levels, resulting in the rise of 
the Apo-B/Apo-A1 ratio and an elevated risk of acute cardiovascular events. 
Concerning mercury and lead, these toxicants can cause hypertension, myocardial 
infarction, and carotid atherosclerosis, in association with the generation of 
free radicals and oxidative stress. This review offers a complete overview of 
the critical factors and biomarkers of lipid and TTE-induced cardiotoxicity 
useful for developing future protective interventions.

We aim to predict the natural aging life of 8016 ethylene propylene rubber 
accurately and quickly. Based on the time-temperature equivalent superposition 
principle, the artificial bee colony algorithm was introduced to calculate the 
acceleration factor of the accelerated aging test, and the calculation of the 
acceleration factor was considered an optimization problem, which avoided the 
error superposition problem caused by data fitting at each temperature. Based on 
the traditional Arrhenius equation, a power exponential factor was introduced to 
consider the non-Arrhenius phenomenon during the rubber aging process. Finally, 
the aging prediction curve of 8106 ethylene propylene rubber at 25 °C was 
obtained. The prediction results show that the artificial bee colony algorithm 
can quickly and accurately identify the acceleration factor of the accelerated 
aging test. The dispersion coefficients between the predicted and measured 
results of the improved and traditional Arrhenius equations are 1.0351 and 
1.6653, respectively, which indicates that the improved Arrhenius equation is 
more advantageous in predicting the long-term aging process of rubber products.

Typhoons in summer and cold snaps during winter in Taiwan often cause huge 
aquaculture losses. Simultaneously, the lack of human resources is a problem. 
Therefore, we used wireless transmission technology with various sensors to 
transmit the temperature, pH value, dissolved oxygen, water level, and life 
expectancy of the sensor in the fish farm to the server. The integrated data are 
transmitted to mobile devices through the Internet of Things, enabling 
administrators to monitor the water quality in a fish farm through mobile 
devices. Because the current pH sensors cannot be submerged in the liquid for a 
long time for measurements, human resources and time are required to take the 
instrument to each fish farm for testing at a fixed time. Therefore, a robotic 
arm was developed to complete automatic measurement and maintenance actions. We 
designed this arm with a programmable logic controller, a single chip combined 
with a wireless transmission module, and an embedded system. This system is 
divided into control, measurement, server, and mobility. The intelligent 
measurement equipment designed in this study can work 24 h per day, which 
effectively reduces the losses caused by personnel, material resources, and data 
errors.

VALIDATION OF THE FEAR OF INTRODUCTION: High levels of fear of COVID-19 may be 
associated with increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as 
decreased resilience and life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to translate and confirm the Serbian version of the 
Fear of COVID-19 scale as well as to investigate its psychometric properties.
METHODS: The translation and intercultural adaptation of the Fear of COVID-19 
scale was performed by the leading standard of the International Society for 
Pharmacoeconomics and Outcome Research. When the distribution was normal, the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. The reliability of the Serbian version of 
FCV-19S was tested by measuring the internal consistency through the value of 
Cronbach's alpha.
RESULTS: The original version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale was tested on a 
sample of 256 subjects with a mean age of 25.38 ± 12.47. The Cronbach's alpha 
value was 0.864. We divided the scale by the split-half method (Spearman-Brown), 
and the value of the coefficient for the questionnaire as a whole was 0.882. 
Divergent criterion validity was tested through the non-parametric correlation 
between the scores of the Fear of COVID-19 scale and the Fear of Hospitalization 
scale. A score of the Fear of COVID-19 scale was calculated as the sum of each 
question for each of the respondents. Convergent criterion validity was tested 
through the non-parametric correlation between the scores of the Fear of 
COVID-19 scale and the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire.
CONCLUSION: The validated version of the scale in Serbia complements versions 
available in other cultures and other languages and facilitates global studies 
related to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in India as well as 
the world. In India, 48% of patients with breast cancer are below 50 years of 
age, indicating a huge age shift in the last 25 years. Breast cancer in an early 
age group increased the five-year survival rate and increased life expectancy 
has created a large group of breast cancer survivors who battle scars of disease 
as well as treatment. Standardized multimodal treatment is either not affordable 
or not available, so the breast conservation surgery rate is very low. 
Mastectomy is still the most common modality of treatment, particularly in rural 
areas. In addition to psychological, social, economic, and family barriers to 
obtaining the diagnosis and treatment needed, economic barriers like the cost of 
travel and lost wages are important factors influencing the choice of treatment. 
Mastectomy represents a deep burden for women with breast cancer. Very little is 
known about the psychological consequences over time and the quality of life 
(QOL) of women so treated, with or without breast reconstruction. Conflicting 
literature is available regarding QOL after mastectomy. The survival rates of 
breast cancer are increasing. They are reported in the range of 80-90% in 
western countries while in the range of 60% in the Indian scenario. With high 
survival rates in cancer, the focus needs to shift from mortality indicators to 
QOL indicators. The QOL that these survivors experience is a comparatively newer 
domain of study. Though there are many instruments for assessment of breast QOL 
of breast cancer patients with numerous studies in western literature, QOL 
studies in Indian rural population are far less, and urban studies cannot be 
extrapolated because the method of treatment differs, with breast conservation 
being more common in urban population. Hence, the present study is undertaken to 
assess the QOL in patients who have undergone mastectomy and ongoing 
chemotherapy or completed chemotherapy recently using a relatively newer 
instrument, i.e., the Quality of Life Instrument - Breast Cancer Patient 
version.
METHODOLOGY: The present study was a cross-sectional study conducted at a rural 
tertiary healthcare center on mastectomy patients attending the outpatient 
department and admitted to the hospital. All the female patients of carcinoma 
breast treated with a mastectomy who were receiving the adjuvant or neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy or were within one year of completion of chemotherapy irrespective 
of age at diagnosis were included in this study. The assessment was performed by 
interview method using a questionnaire.
RESULTS: In this study, 44.90% of the patients were <50 years old and 55.10% 
were more than 50 years old. Among them, 28.57% were illiterate while only 
20.41% had graduate education. The majority (61.22%) were from the low 
socioeconomic class. Majority of women presented in the late stages of the 
disease, with 61.22% presenting in the third stage and only three (6.12%) 
presenting in the first stage of the disease. The overall global QOL score was 
49 ± 2.6 and fear was assessed. Patients scored better in the physical, 
psychological, social, and spiritual domains, with an average score of more than 
50. The worst scores were observed among distress of illness or treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that the average QOL scores in rural Indian 
women after mastectomy are moderate. Global scores and other indicators show 
moderate QOL.

The purpose of this study was to provide an evidence base for colorectal cancer 
research activity that might influence policy, mainly at the national level. 
Improvements in healthcare delivery have lengthened life expectancy, but within 
a situation of increased cancer incidence. The disease burden of CRC has risen 
significantly, particularly in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Research is key 
to its control and reduction, but few studies have delineated the volume and 
funding of global research on CRC. We identified research papers in the Web of 
Science (WoS) from 2007 to 2021, and determined the contributions of the leading 
countries, the research domains studied, and their sources of funding. We 
identified 62 716 papers, representing 5.7% of all cancer papers. This 
percentage was somewhat disproportionate to the disease burden (7.7% in 2015), 
especially in Eastern Europe. International collaboration increased over the 
time period in almost all countries except in China. Genetics, surgery and 
prognosis were the leading research domains. However, research on palliative 
care and quality-of-life in CRC was lacking. In Western Europe, the main funding 
source was the charity sector, particularly in the UK, but in most other 
countries government played the leading role, especially in China and the USA. 
There was little support from industry. Several Asian countries provided minimal 
contestable funding, which may have reduced the impact of their CRC research. 
Certain countries must perform more CRC research overall, especially in domains 
such as screening, palliative care and quality-of-life. The private-non-profit 
sector should be an alternative source of support.

BACKGROUND: Anal squamous cell carcinoma patients often present with significant 
symptoms, including pain, bleeding, and obstructive symptoms. This requires 
palliation-directed therapy as a first-line treatment to alleviate symptoms. The 
proportion of patients receiving first-line palliative treatments is unknown. We 
aimed to study the factors associated with the use of first-line palliative 
treatments in stage II-IV anal squamous cell carcinoma patients.
METHODS: We used the National Cancer Database to identify adult patients 
diagnosed with stage II-IV anal squamous cell carcinoma between 2004 and 2016. 
We performed univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis to 
determine the clinical and sociodemographic variables associated with the 
utilization of palliative treatment in the first-line setting, including 
palliative radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, and pain management.
RESULTS: Among 16,944 patients diagnosed with stage II-IV anal squamous cell 
carcinoma, only a small proportion of 492 (2.9%) required first-line palliative 
treatments to control symptoms. The majority of these patients received 
palliative radiotherapy (32%), followed by palliative surgery (25%), palliative 
chemotherapy (19%), combination therapies (14%), and pain management (10%). On 
multivariable analysis, higher stage disease, lower income, Medicare and 
Medicaid insurance, and life expectancy <6 months were associated with higher 
odds of use of first-line palliative therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: First-line use of palliative treatments to control symptoms is 
needed in a small proportion of anal squamous cell cancer patients. It was 
utilized in all stages, but it was most frequently observed in patients with 
stage IV disease and patients with <6 months life expectancy. First-line 
palliative therapy was also more frequent in lower-income patients and patients 
with Medicare and Medicaid insurance which highlights the disparities in anal 
cancer management.

Among the many ambitious decarbonization goals globally, the US intends grid 
decarbonization by 2035, requiring 1 TW of installed photovoltaics (PV), up from 
~110 GW in 2021. This unprecedented global scale-up will stress existing PV 
supply chains with increased material and energy demands. By 2050, 1.75 TW of PV 
in the US cumulatively demands 97 million metric tonnes of virgin material and 
creates 8 million metric tonnes of life cycle waste. This analysis leverages the 
PV in Circular Economy tool (PV ICE) to evaluate two circular economy 
approaches, lifetime extension and closed-loop recycling, on their ability to 
reduce virgin material demands and life cycle wastes while meeting capacity 
goals. Modules with 50-year lifetimes can reduce virgin material demand by 3% 
through reduced deployment. Modules with 15-year lifetimes require an additional 
1.2 TW of replacement modules to maintain capacity, increasing virgin material 
demand and waste unless >90% of module mass is closed-loop recycled. Currently, 
no PV technology is more than 90% closed-loop recycled. Glass, the majority of 
mass in all PV technologies and an energy intensive component with a problematic 
supply chain, should be targeted for a circular redesign. Our work contributes 
data-backed insights prioritizing circular PV strategies for a sustainable 
energy transition.

Dairy milk is a ubiquitous nutrient-dense beverage and ingredient, especially in 
Western diets. However, consumers are increasingly seeking alternatives to 
dairy, called plant-based milks (PBMs), to avoid allergens, pursue a plant-based 
diet, or reduce their environmental impacts. The base ingredients used in PBMs 
have a wide range of environmental impacts, which may translate to substantial 
variation across the impacts associated with PBMs themselves. To assess the 
state of the literature on this topic, we performed a scoping review of the 
environmental impacts of PBMs, following the guidelines of the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping 
reviews. Recent growth in the variety of PBMs available means that there is 
unlikely yet enough data for conclusive statements regarding environmental 
impacts of all PBM types, which makes this topic appropriate for a scoping 
review. We included all relevant documents found through searching scholarly 
databases. We found 20 studies covering 6 types of PBMs, but the literature does 
not examine many other types of PBMs. All studies examined use the life cycle 
assessment methodology. The most data regarding environmental impacts were 
available for soy- and almond-based milks, and the most common impact quantified 
was greenhouse gas emissions. We also examined the nutrient composition of PBMs 
compared with dairy using data from the USDA. PBMs attempt to replicate the 
organoleptic properties of dairy but often do not exactly match the nutrient 
profile of dairy. We identified a need for the application of a standardized 
methodology to facilitate more comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts 
of the wide variety of PBMs available, which are presented as environmentally 
preferable to dairy.

Lausanne, Switzerland.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze mortality trends in Switzerland in 2021, the second year 
of the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: Using data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, we compared 
mortality in Switzerland in 2021 with that of previous years in terms of 
standardized weekly deaths, standardized (annual) mortality rates (overall and 
stratified by age and sex) and life expectancy. The latter is a well-known 
demographic concept defining the average lifespan of a hypothetical cohort 
living and dying according to the mortality rates of a given year.
RESULTS: After a favorable first half of the year and a fairly standard second 
half in terms of mortality in Switzerland, the year 2021 ended with a wave of 
deaths of moderate intensity related to the 5th wave of COVID-19. Overall, and 
after a notable increase in mortality in 2020 (+9.2%, 95%CI: +8.0%; +10.3%, 
compared to 2019, and +5.1%, 95%CI: +4.3%; +6.0%, compared to 2015-19), the 
pre-pandemic mortality level was approximately recovered in 2021 (+0.8%, 95%CI: 
-0.3%; +0.8%, compared to 2019, and -2.9%, 95%CI: -3.7%; -2.2%, compared to 
2015-19). Life expectancy, after declining by 10 months for men and 6 months for 
women in 2020 (i.e. men would have lost 10 months and women 6 months had they 
lived their entire lives with COVID-19 as it was in 2020), returned in 2021 to 
2019 levels for women (85.6 years) and regained 2018 levels for men (81.6 years, 
still -0.3 years from 2019). The age group responsible for the small remaining 
loss for men was the 50-70 age group, which had similar mortality in 2020 and 
2021.
CONCLUSIONS: The second year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland was 
characterized by an approximate return to pre-pandemic mortality levels, with a 
faster recovery for women than for men with respect to 2020.

Prevalence and consequences of non-adherence to an evidence-based approach for 
incidental pulmonary nodules.

Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America.

America.

IMPORTANCE: Distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules is 
challenging. Evidence-based guidelines exist, but their impact on 
patient-centered outcomes is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To understand if the evaluation of incidental pulmonary nodules that 
follows an evidence-based management strategy is associated with fewer invasive 
procedures for benign lesions and/or fewer delays in cancer diagnosis.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Large academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults (≥18 years age) with an incidental pulmonary nodule 
discovered between January 2012 and December 2014. Patients with calcified 
nodules, prior nodules, prior diagnosis of cancer, high suspicion for pulmonary 
metastasis, or limited life expectancy were excluded.
EXPOSURE: Nodule management strategy (pre-specified based on evidence-based 
practices).
OUTCOME: Composite of any invasive procedure for a benign nodule or delay in 
diagnosis in patients with cancer (>3 month delay once probability of cancer was 
>15%).
RESULTS: Of 314 patients that met inclusion criteria, median age was 61, 46.5% 
were men, and 66.5% had current or former tobacco use. The mean nodule size was 
10.3 mm, mean probability of cancer was 11.8%, and 14.3% of nodules were 
malignant. Evaluation followed an evidence-based strategy in 245 patients 
(78.0%), and deviated in 69 patients (22%). The composite outcome occurred in 26 
(8.3%) patients. Among patients whose nodule evaluation was concordant with an 
evidence-based evaluation, 6.1% (15/245) experienced the composite outcome 
versus 15.9% (11/69) of patients with an evaluation that deviated from 
evidence-based recommendations (P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: At a large academic medical center, more than 1 in 5 
patients with an incidental pulmonary nodule underwent evaluation that deviated 
from evidence-based practice recommendations. Nodule evaluation that deviated 
from an evidence-based strategy was associated with biopsy of benign lesions and 
delays in cancer diagnosis, suggesting a need to improve guideline uptake.

Hygiene, New York, NY.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a population-based analysis and compare life expectancy 
between people with HIV and the general population in New York City (NYC).
METHODS: We obtained the annual total number and age, sex, and race/ethnicity 
distributions of people with HIV from the NYC HIV registry and generated 
comparable numbers for the NYC general population from the Census 2000 and 2010 
data using linear interpolation.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at age 20 among people with HIV increased from 38.5 
years [95% confidence interval (CI): 37.4 to 39.5] in 2009 to 50.6 (95% CI: 48.5 
to 52.7) in 2018, whereas it increased from 62.0 years (95% CI: 61.8 to 62.1) to 
63.6 (95% CI: 63.5 to 63.7) among the NYC general population. The gap between 
the 2 populations narrowed from 23.5 years (95% CI: 22.4 to 24.6) in 2009 to 
13.0 (95% CI: 10.9 to 15.1) in 2018. By sex and race/ethnicity, life expectancy 
at age 20 among people with HIV increased from 36.7 years in 2009 to 47.9 in 
2018 among Black men; 37.5 to 50.5 years among Black women; 38.6 to 48.9 years 
among Hispanic men; 46.0 to 51.0 years among Hispanic women; 44.7 to 59.7 years 
among White men; and 38.0 years in 2009-2013 to 50.4 years in 2014-2018 among 
White women.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy among people with HIV improved greatly in NYC in 
2009-2018, but the improvement was not equal across sex and racial/ethnic 
groups. The gap in life expectancy between people with HIV and the general 
population narrowed but remained.

Bacteriophages (phages) represent powerful potential treatments against 
antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria 
represent a significant threat to global health, with an estimated 70% of 
infection-causing bacteria being resistant to one or more antibiotics. 
Developing novel antibiotics against the limited number of cellular targets is 
expensive and time-consuming, and bacteria can rapidly develop resistance. While 
bacterial resistance to phage can evolve, bacterial resistance to phage does not 
appear to spread through lateral gene transfer, and phage may similarly adapt 
through mutation to recover infectivity. Phages have been identified for all 
known bacteria, allowing the strain-selective killing of pathogenic bacteria. 
Here, we re-engineered the Escherichia coli phage P2 to alter its tropism toward 
pathogenic bacteria. Chimeric tail fibers formed between P2 and S16 genes were 
designed and generated through two approaches: homology- and literature-based. 
By presenting chimeric P2:S16 fibers on the P2 particle, our data suggests that 
the resultant phages were effectively detargeted from the native P2 cellular 
target, lipopolysaccharide, and were instead able to infect via the 
proteinaceous receptor, OmpC, the natural S16 receptor. Our work provides 
evidence that pseudotyping P2 is feasible and can be used to extend the host 
range of P2 to alternative receptors. Extension of this work could produce 
alternative chimeric tail fibers to target pathogenic bacterial threats. Our 
engineering of P2 allows adsorption through a heterologous outer-membrane 
protein without culturing in its native host, thus providing a potential means 
of engineering designer phages against pathogenic bacteria from knowledge of 
their surface proteome.

OBJECTIVES: This analysis characterized changes in weight in participants with 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or narcolepsy treated with solriamfetol (Sunosi™) 
37.5 (OSA only), 75, 150, or 300 mg/d.
METHODS: In two 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials and one 1-year 
open-label extension study, changes in weight were evaluated from baseline to 
end of study (week 12 or week 40 of the open-label extension [after up to 52 
weeks of solriamfetol treatment]) in participants with OSA or narcolepsy.
RESULTS: After 12 weeks of solriamfetol treatment, median percent change in 
weight from baseline across all solriamfetol doses was -0.84%, compared with 
0.54% for placebo, in participants with OSA; and -0.07%, compared with 3.08% for 
placebo, in participants with narcolepsy. After up to 52 weeks of solriamfetol 
treatment, overall median percent change in weight from baseline was -1.76%, 
which showed a dose-dependent pattern (75 mg, 0.57%; 150 mg, -1.2%; 
300 mg, -2.5%). Results were similar in subgroups of participants with OSA or 
narcolepsy, with overall median percent changes in weight of -2.2% and -1.1%, 
respectively. After up to 52 weeks of solriamfetol treatment, the percentage of 
participants with weight loss ≥5% relative to baseline was 25.7% overall and 
increased in a dose-dependent manner (75 mg, 4.5%; 150 mg, 17.3%; 300 mg, 
32.4%). Results were similar among subgroups of participants with OSA or 
narcolepsy, with 26.4% and 24.2% of participants experiencing weight loss ≥5%, 
respectively. No weight-related treatment-emergent adverse events were serious.
CONCLUSIONS: Solriamfetol treatment was associated with decreases in body weight 
in a dose-related manner.

The Gini coefficient of the life table is a concentration index that provides 
information on lifespan variation. Originally proposed by economists to measure 
income and wealth inequalities, it has been widely used in population studies to 
investigate variation in ages at death. We focus on the complement of the Gini 
coefficient, Drewnowski's index, which is a measure of equality. We study its 
mathematical properties and analyze how changes over time relate to changes in 
life expectancy. Further, we identify the threshold age below which mortality 
improvements are translated into decreasing lifespan variation and above which 
these improvements translate into increasing lifespan inequality. We illustrate 
our theoretical findings simulating scenarios of mortality improvement in the 
Gompertz model, and showing an example of application to Swedish life table 
data. Our experiments demonstrate how Drewnowski's index can serve as an 
indicator of the shape of mortality patterns. These properties, along with our 
analytical findings, support studying lifespan variation alongside life 
expectancy trends in multiple species.

The early-life experience is important in modulating the late-life performance 
of individuals. It has been predicted that there were trade-offs between 
early-life fitness and late-life success. Most of the studies on senescence have 
focused on the trade-offs between the reproduction and lifespan, and the 
influences of diet, mating, and other factors. Because the negative, 
non-consumptive effects of predators could also modulate the behaviour and 
underlying mechanisms of the prey, this study aimed to examine the different 
effects of predator-induced stress experienced in the early life compared with 
later life of the prey. The prey (Tyrophagus putrescentiae) was exposed to 
predation stress from the predator (Neoseiulus cucumeris) during different 
periods of its life (immature, oviposition period, and post-oviposition period). 
The results showed that the predation stress experienced during immature stages 
delayed development by 7.3% and prolonged lifespan by 9.7%, while predation 
stress experienced in the adult stage (both oviposition and post-oviposition 
periods) decreased lifespans of T. putrescentiae (by 24.8% and 28.7%, 
respectively). Predation stress experienced during immature stages also reduced 
female fecundity by 7.3%, whereas that experienced during the oviposition period 
reduced fecundity of the prey by 50.7%. This study demonstrated for the first 
time lifespan extension by exposure to predation stress when young and 
highlighted the importance of early-life experience to aging and lifespan.

INTRODUCTION: In hip osteoarthritis, hip flexion contracture can severely alter 
the patient's alignment, and, therefore, affect the patient's quality of life 
(QOL). Hip contracture is not well-studied, partly because of the difficulties 
of its diagnosis. The aim of this study was to propose a quantitative definition 
of hip flexion contracture, and to analyse sagittal alignment in these patients 
compared to non-contracture ones, before and 12 months after total hip
