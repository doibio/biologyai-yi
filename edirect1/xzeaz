Atypical parkinsonian syndromes are neurodegenerative conditions, characterised 
by rapid disease progression and shorter life expectancy compared to idiopathic 
Parkinson's disease. These conditions inflict substantial physical and 
psychosocial burden on patients and their families; hence, there is a clear 
rationale for a palliative care approach from diagnosis. An interdisciplinary 
care model has been shown to improve symptom burden, quality of life and 
engagement with advance care planning, in a heterogeneous group of 
neurodegenerative conditions. In this update, we summarise how the landscape for 
treating these patients has changed and the questions that still need to be 
resolved.

PURPOSE: Obesity has become a global health concern, associated with decreased 
quality of life and life expectancy. Although bariatric surgery has many 
benefits (e.g., substantial and durable weight loss, amelioration of 
comorbidities, and improvement in functionality), its patient attrition rate is 
relatively high. Therefore, we aim to assess the causes of withdrawal from our 
program.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We interviewed patients who dropped out of our bariatric 
surgery program between January 2016 and December 2021. A total of 1999 patients 
were eligible for bariatric surgery during this period, and 255 patients 
withdrew from the program. We interviewed patients over the phone to find out 
the reason for withdrawal. We divided participants into two groups: dropouts 
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several options explaining the reason 
for leaving the program were presented to the patients to choose from.
RESULTS: The number of patients who withdrew from the program before and during 
the COVID-19 pandemic was 135 (8.9%) and 120 (25.2%), respectively. Before the 
COVID-19 pandemic, most patients (49.1%) stated that the long waiting time was 
the cause of withdrawal. Even though during the COVID-19 pandemic, the main 
causes of attrition were the fear of contracting the disease and COVID-19 
infection; the most common reason unrelated to COVID-19 was still the long 
preoperative preparation.
CONCLUSION: Long waiting time was the most common cause of patient attrition 
before bariatric surgery. To reduce the attrition rate, more studies should be 
conducted to find an optimized waiting time before bariatric surgery.

PURPOSE: The implications of high prices for cancer drugs on health care costs 
and patients' financial burdens are a growing concern. Patients with metastatic 
castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are often candidates for multiple 
first-line systemic therapies with similar impacts on life expectancy. However, 
little is known about the gross and out-of-pocket (OOP) payments associated with 
each of these drugs for patients with employer-sponsored health insurance. We 
therefore aimed to determine the gross and OOP payments of first-line drugs for 
mCRPC and how the payments vary across drugs.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 4,298 patients with prostate 
cancer who initiated therapy with one of six drugs approved for first-line 
treatment of mCRPC between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2019. We compared gross 
and OOP payments during the 6 months after initiation of treatment for mCRPC 
using private payer claims data across patients using different first-line 
drugs.
RESULTS: Gross payments varied across drugs. Over the 6 months after the index 
prescription, mean unadjusted gross drug payments were highest for patients 
receiving sipuleucel-T ($115,525 USD) and lowest for patients using docetaxel 
($12,804 USD). OOP payments were lower than gross drug payments; mean 6-month 
OOP payments were highest for cabazitaxel ($1,044 USD) and lowest for docetaxel 
($296 USD). There was a wide distribution of OOP payments within drug types.
CONCLUSION: Drugs for mCRPC are expensive with large differences in payments by 
drug type. OOP payments among patients with employer-sponsored health insurance 
are much lower than gross drug payments, and they vary both across and within 
first-line drug types, with some patients making very high OOP payments. 
Although lowering drug prices would reduce pharmaceutical spending for patients 
with mCRPC, decreasing patient financial burden requires understanding an 
individual patient's benefit design.

[The role of estriol in the treatment of atrophy of the mucous membrane of the 
lower genitourinary tract in postmenopausal women].

Studies of recent decades show a steady increase in the average life expectancy 
of a person, and women in particular. The World Health Organization predicts a 
four-fold increase in the number of women over 70 by 2030, and many of them over 
the age of 45 may face menopausal problems. Menopause is a physiological state 
in a woman's life, during which, against the background of age-related changes, 
there is a gradual decrease and shutdown of ovarian function and the cessation 
of estrogen production. Genitourinary syndrome occurs in every third woman in 
this period. Estriol is the main estrogen that specifically addresses problems 
associated with estrogen deficiency: dyspareunia, dryness and itching in the 
vagina and lower genitourinary tract, urinary incontinence, moderate urinary 
incontinence, and recurrent vulvovaginitis and cystitis. Vulvovaginal dystrophy 
in women of the older age group is a multidisciplinary problem at the 
intersection of gynecology, urology and dermatology, which can and should be 
solved to prevent more severe gynecological and urological pathologies.

Исследования последних десятилетий показывают неуклонный рост средней 
продолжительности жизни человека, и женщины в частности. Всемирная организация 
здравоохранения прогнозирует к 2030 г. четырехкратное увеличение численности 
женщин старше 70 лет, при этом многие из них в возрасте после 45 лет могут 
столкнуться с проблемами климактерического периода. Климактерий является 
физиологическим состоянием в жизни женщины, в течение которого на фоне 
возрастных изменений происходят постепенное снижение и выключение функции 
яичников и прекращение выработки эстрогенов. Генитоуринарный синдром встречается 
у каждой третьей женщины в этом периоде. Эстриол — основной эстроген, который 
таргетно решает проблемы, обусловленные эстрогенной недостаточностью: 
диспареунии, сухости и зуда во влагалище и нижних отделах мочеполового тракта, 
нарушения мочевыведения, умеренного недержания мочи, а также рецидивирующего 
вульвовагинита и цистита. Вульвовагинальная дистрофия у женщин старшей 
возрастной группы — это мультидисциплинарная проблема на стыке гинекологии, 
урологии и дерматологии, которая может и должна быть решена для предотвращения 
более тяжелой гинекологической и урологической патологий.

INTRODUCTION: Stroke is the fourth single leading cause of death in the UK with 
more than 100,000 people diagnosed with stroke annually. Timely access to urgent 
care and treatments, such as thrombolysis, is crucial for survival and recovery 
but there are national variations in care access.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explore the cost-effectiveness of an integrated 
telemedicine service for rapid access to stroke Consultant support in the East 
of England acute stroke care pathway compared to usual care during out-of-hour 
periods. The Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) health economics 
thrombolysis tool enabled us to compare the service with usual acute stroke care 
pathway. The tool was used to estimate costs and cost per quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) gain associated with improved thrombolysis rates from a health and 
social care perspective.
RESULTS: Based on SSNAP data, an average of 1,861 stroke patients were admitted 
out-of-hours in the participating centres annually between 2014 and 2019. 
Average thrombolysis rate was 9.7% when using a telemedicine service across the 
centres relative to the total stroke patients that presented out-of-hours. The 
total NHS cost savings compared to usual care were estimated at £482k and £471k 
while social care cost savings were £1.7m and £536k at the end of 1-year and 
5-years respectively.
CONCLUSION: Integrating a telemedicine service improves thrombolysis rates in 
out-of-hours acute stroke care and is associated with NHS and social care 
savings and QALY gains. Telemedicine is a cost-effective approach to delivering 
stroke care to remote communities with limited access to stroke specialists.

Microbiological food safety considerations in shelf-life extension of fresh 
fruits and vegetables.

There are a number of opportunities for reducing loss and waste, and extending 
shelf life of fresh produce that go beyond cold chain optimization. For example, 
plant genotype (including ripening-related genes), presence of phytopathogens, 
maturity at harvest, and environmental conditions close to the harvest time, 
storage conditions, and postharvest treatments (washing, cutting, and waxing) 
all impact both shelf life of produce and food safety outcomes. Therefore, loss 
can be reduced and shelf life of fresh produce can be extended with plant 
breeding to manipulate ripening-related traits, or with pre- and postharvest 
treatments delaying senescence and decay. Food safety considerations of these 
applications are discussed.

BACKGROUND: With the increase in drug resistance rates of pathogens isolated 
from complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), ceftazidime/avibactam 
(CAZ-AVI) is increasingly used clinically. However, given the high drug cost and 
the fact that not yet covered by the health insurance payment, this study 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole versus meropenem 
as a first-line empiric treatment for cIAIs from the perspective of the Chinese 
healthcare system.
METHODS: A decision analytic model with a one-year time horizon was constructed 
to assess the cost-effectiveness based on the entire disease course. Model 
inputs were mainly obtained from clinical studies, published literature, and 
publicly available databases. Primary outcomes were cost, quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), life years (Lys), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER). One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were 
also performed.
RESULTS: In the base cases, compared to meropenem, CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole 
had a shorter mean hospital length of stay (-0.77 days per patient) and longer 
life expectancy (+0.05 LYs and +0.06 QALYs). CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole had an 
ICER of $25517/QALY, which is well below the threshold of $31509 per QALY in 
China. The one-way sensitivity analysis showed that the change of the treatment 
duration of CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole was the parameter that most influenced 
the results of the ICER. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, CAZ-AVI plus 
metronidazole was the optimal strategy in 75% of simulations at $31510/QALY 
threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: CAZ-AVI plus metronidazole could be considered as a cost-effective 
option for the empiric treatment of patients with cIAIs in China, and this 
benefit will be more evident when the price of CAZ-AVI decreases by 23.8%.

BACKGROUND: To determine the effect of resistance training volume on physical 
and perceptual outcomes of breast cancer survivors submitted to a combined 
training program.
DESIGN: Randomized single-blinded study.
METHODS: Nineteen breast cancer survivor women were randomized to a single-set 
(SS) or a multiple-set (MS) group. Both groups completed an 8-week combined 
training intervention in which the SS and MS groups performed 1 and 3 sets per 
resistance exercise, respectively. The following outcomes were assessed 
preintervention and postintervention: maximal knee extension dynamic strength 
(1-repetition maximum), quadriceps muscle thickness, peak oxygen uptake, time to 
exhaustion, cancer-related fatigue, and quality of life.
RESULTS: Both interventions increased knee extension 1-repetition maximum (SS: 
29.8% [37.5%]; MS: 19.3% [11.8%]), quadriceps muscle thickness (9.4% [4.1%]; 
8.9% [5.9%]), and quality of life (4.3% [6.3%]; 7.9% [9.0%]), with no difference 
between the groups. However, only MS improved cancer-related fatigue (-2.1% 
[1.7%]) and time to exhaustion (21.3% [14.9%]), whereas peak oxygen uptake 
remained unchanged in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer-related fatigue and time to exhaustion, improved only in the 
MS group after the intervention. On the other hand, similar knee extension 
1-repetition maximum, quadriceps muscle thickness, and quality of life 
improvements were observed in breast cancer survivors irrespective of the 
resistance training volume performed.

of recommendationsCorticosteroids should be administered to women at a 
gestational age between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks, when preterm birth is anticipated 
in the next seven days, as these have been consistently shown to reduce neonatal 
mortality and morbidity. (Strong-quality evidence; strong recommendation). In 
selected cases, extension of this period up to 34+6 weeks may be considered 
(Expert opinion). Optimal benefits are found in infants delivered within 7 days 
of corticosteroid administration. Even a single-dose administration should be 
given to women with imminent preterm birth, as this is likely to improve 
neurodevelopmental outcome (Moderate-quality evidence; conditional 
recommendation).Either betamethasone (12 mg administered intramuscularly twice, 
24-hours apart) or dexamethasone (6 mg administered intramuscularly in four 
doses, 12-hours apart, or 12 mg administered intramuscularly twice, 24-hours 
apart), may be used (Moderate-quality evidence; Strong recommendation). 
Administration of two "all" doses is named a "course of 
corticosteroids".Administration between 22+0 and 23+6 weeks should be considered 
when preterm birth is anticipated in the next seven days and active newborn 
life-support is indicated, taking into account parental wishes. Clear survival 
benefit has been observed in these cases, but the impact on short-term 
neurological and respiratory function, as well as long-term neurodevelopmental 
outcome is still unclear (Low/moderate-quality evidence; Weak 
recommendation).Administration between 34 + 0 and 34 + 6 weeks should only be 
offered to a few selected cases (Expert opinion). Administration between 35+0 
and 36+6 weeks should be restricted to prospective randomized trials. Current 
evidence suggests that although corticosteroids reduce the incidence of 
transient tachypnea of the newborn, they do not affect the incidence of 
respiratory distress syndrome, and they increase neonatal hypoglycemia. 
Long-term safety data are lacking (Moderate quality evidence; Conditional 
recommendation).Administration in pregnancies beyond 37+0 weeks is not 
indicated, even for scheduled cesarean delivery, as current evidence does not 
suggest benefit and the long-term effects remain unknown (Low-quality evidence; 
Conditional recommendation).Administration should be given in twin pregnancies, 
with the same indication and doses as for singletons. However, existing evidence 
suggests that it should be reserved for pregnancies at high-risk of delivering 
within a 7-day interval (Low-quality evidence; Conditional recommendation). 
Maternal diabetes mellitus is not a contraindication to the use of antenatal 
corticosteroids (Moderate quality evidence; Strong recommendation).A single 
repeat course of corticosteroids can be considered in pregnancies at less than 
34+0 weeks gestation, if the previous course was completed more than seven days 
earlier, and there is a renewed risk of imminent delivery (Low-quality evidence; 
Conditional recommendation).

BACKGROUND: Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has conferred an early survival 
advantage compared to an open surgical repair (OSR) in patients with ruptured 
abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA). However, the long-term survival benefit after 
EVAR was not displayed among randomized controlled trials (RCTs), whereas many 
non-RCTs have provided conflicting results. We conducted a time-to-event 
individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis on long-term rAAA data.
METHODS: All studies comparing mortality after EVAR versus OSR for rAAA were 
included. We used restricted mean survival times (RMSTs) as a measure of life 
expectancy for EVAR and OSR.
RESULTS: A total of 21 studies, including 12,187 patients (4952 EVAR and 7235 
OSR) were finally deemed eligible. A secondary IPD analysis included 725 (372 
EVAR and 353 OSR) patients only from the 3 RCTs (Immediate Management of the 
Patient With Rupture : Open Versus Endovascular Repair, Endovasculaire ou 
Chirurgie dans les Anévrysmes aorto-iliaques Rompus and Amsterdam Acute Aneurysm 
Trial trials). Among all studies, the median survival was 4.20 (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 3.70-4.58) years for EVAR and 1.91 (95% CI: 1.57-2.39) years for 
OSR. Although EVAR presented with increased hazard risk from 4 to 7 years, which 
peaked at 6 years after the operation, the RMST difference was 0.54 (95% CI: 
0.35-0.73; P < 0.001) years gained with EVAR at the end of the 10-year 
follow-up. IPD meta-analysis of RCTs did not demonstrate significant 
differences.
CONCLUSIONS: At 10-years follow-up, EVAR was associated with a 6.5 month 
increase in life expectancy when compared to OSR after analyzing all eligible 
studies. Evidence from our study suggests that a strict follow-up program would 
be desirable, especially for patients with long-life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to health 
systems and populations, particularly in India. Comprehensive, population-level 
studies of the burden of disease could inform planning, preparedness and policy, 
but are lacking in India. In West Bengal, India, we conducted a detailed 
analysis of the burden caused by COVID-19 from its onset to 7 January 2022.
SETTING: Open-access, population-level and administrative data sets for West 
Bengal were used.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 
years of potential productive life lost (YPPLL), cost of productivity lost (CPL: 
premature mortality and absenteeism), years of potential life lost (YPLL), 
premature years of potential life lost, working years of potential life lost 
(WYPLL) and value of statistical life (VSL) were estimated across scenarios (21 
for DALY and 3 each for YPLL and VSL) to evaluate the effects of different 
factors.
RESULTS: COVID-19 had a higher impact on the elderly population with 90.2% of 
deaths arising from people aged above 45. In males and females, respectively, 
DALYs were 190 568.1 and 117 310.0 years, YPPLL of the productive population was 
28 714.7 and 16 355.4 years, CPL due to premature mortality was INR3 198 259 
615.6 and INR583 397 335.1 and CPL due to morbidity was INR2 505 568 048.4 and 
INR763 720 886.1. For males and females, YPLL ranged from 189 103.2 to 272 787.5 
years and 117 925.5 to 169 712.0 years for lower to higher age limits, and WYPLL 
was 54 333.9 and 30 942.2 years. VSL (INR million) for the lower, midpoint and 
upper life expectancies was 883 330.8; 882 936.4; and 880 631.3, respectively. 
Vaccination was associated with reduced mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The losses incurred due to COVID-19 in terms of the computed 
estimates in West Bengal revealed a disproportionately higher impact on the 
elderly and males. Analysis of various age-gender subgroups enhances localised 
and targeted policymaking to minimise the losses for future pandemics.

Survival of patients after repair of coarctation of Aorta (CoA) has improved 
significantly over the decades, but patients have decreased life expectancy as 
compared to the general population. This has been attributed to increased 
hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and coronary artery disease. There has 
also been an increasing concern of overweight and obesity in patients with adult 
congenital heart disease. While there have been studies looking at the impact of 
long-term hypertension on myocardial performance and outcomes in this 
population, this study aims to assess the impact of obesity in these patients on 
their myocardial performance. Ventriculo-arterial coupling is used as a measure 
of myocardial performance which reflects the interaction between cardiac 
contractility and arterial elastance. Patients after CoA repair are known to 
have hypertension affecting the arterial elastance. Obesity affects cardiac 
contractility as well. This study demonstrated that in a group of young patients 
after CoA repair, body mass index (BMI) has a relationship with left ventricular 
(LV) contractility and myocardial performance. This relationship was independent 
of blood pressure. BMI itself was not seen to affect the determinants of 
diastolic function in this study, suggesting that LV contractility may be 
affected before one can notice a change in the diastolic function secondary to 
BMI.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate variability in life expectancy at birth in small areas, 
describe the spatial pattern of life expectancy, and examine associations 
between small-area socioeconomic characteristics and life expectancy in a 
mid-sized city of a middle-income country.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional, using data from death registries (2015-2018) and 
socioeconomic characteristics data from the 2010 national population census.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: 40 898 death records in 99 small areas of the city of 
Córdoba, Argentina. We summarised variability in life expectancy at birth by 
using the difference between the 90th and 10th percentile of the distribution of 
life expectancy across small areas (P90-P10 gap) and evaluated associations with 
small-area socioeconomic characteristics by calculating a Slope Index of 
Inequality in linear regression.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: Life expectancy at birth.
RESULTS: The median life expectancy at birth was 80.3 years in women (P90-P10 
gap=3.2 years) and 75.1 years in men (P90-P10 gap=4.6 years). We found higher 
life expectancies in the core and northwest parts of the city, especially among 
women. We found positive associations between life expectancy and better 
small-area socioeconomic characteristics, especially among men. Mean differences 
in life expectancy between the highest versus the lowest decile of area 
characteristics in men (women) were 3.03 (2.58), 3.52 (2.56) and 2.97 (2.31) 
years for % adults with high school education or above, % persons aged 15-17 
attending school, and % households with water inside the dwelling, respectively. 
Lower values of % overcrowded households and unemployment rate were associated 
with longer life expectancy: mean differences comparing the lowest versus the 
highest decile were 3.03 and 2.73 in men and 2.57 and 2.34 years in women, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy is substantially heterogeneous and patterned by 
socioeconomic characteristics in a mid-sized city of a middle-income country, 
suggesting that small-area inequities in life expectancy are not limited to 
large cities or high-income countries.

BACKGROUND Many hospitalized aged patients in Japan, the most super-aged 
society, are unable to be discharged home. This study was performed to clarify 
the factors associated with home discharge, not to a long-term care (LTC) 
facility or another hospital, among inpatients aged ≥75 years. MATERIAL AND 
METHODS A single-center prospective cohort study was performed for inpatients 
aged ≥75 years in a rural acute-care hospital in Japan, from November 2017 to 
October 2019. We divided the patients into 2 groups: those who resided at home 
or had died at home by 30 days after discharge, and others. We obtained data 
from medical charts and questionnaires given to patients and their caregivers. 
For each factor shown to be statistically significant by the univariable 
analysis, a multivariable analysis with adjustment was conducted. RESULTS In 
all, 285 patients agreed to participate. With adjustment by where the patient 
was admitted from, residing with other family members, cognitive function 
scores, and Barthel index, multivariable analysis using each factor identified 
as relevant by univariable analysis identified the following as associated with 
home discharge: being less informed about LTC insurance; cost of home-visit 
medical, nursing, or LTC services; shorter hospital stays; close proximity 
between patient and caregiver; main caregiver being female; and life expectancy 
of over 6 months (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Male gender and a long distance between 
the caregiver and patient's home significantly hindered home discharge in 
patients aged ≥75 years, suggesting the need to provide information regarding 
home-visit services under Japan's LTC insurance system for such caregivers.

AIMS: Reactive atrial-based anti-tachycardia pacing (rATP) in pacemakers (PMs) 
and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (CRT-Ds) has been reported 
to prevent progression of atrial fibrillation, and this reduced progression is 
expected to decrease the risk of complications such as stroke and heart failure 
(HF). This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of rATP in PMs and 
CRT-Ds in the Japanese public health insurance system.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a Markov model comprising five states: 
bradycardia, post-stroke, mild HF, severe HF, and death. For devices with rATP 
and control devices without rATP, we compared the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) from the payer's perspective. Costs were estimated from healthcare 
resource utilisation data in a Japanese claims database. We evaluated model 
uncertainty by analysing two scenarios for each device. The ICER was 763 729 
JPY/QALY (5616 EUR/QALY) for PMs and 1,393 280 JPY/QALY (10 245 EUR/QALY) for 
CRT-Ds. In all scenarios, ICERs were below 5 million JPY/QALY (36 765 EUR/QALY), 
supporting robustness of the results.
CONCLUSION: According to a willingness to pay threshold of 5 million JPY/QALY, 
the devices with rATP were cost-effective compared with control devices without 
rATP, showing that the higher reimbursement price of the functional categories 
with rATP is justified from a healthcare economic perspective.

care workloads.

Extending screening intervals in ongoing cancer screening programmes can lead to 
challenging year-on-year variations in the number of screening tests. We 
explored how such variation could be diminished with a managed transition to the 
extended interval. We defined three extension scenarios: immediate extension for 
the entire target population; stepped transition by birth cohort; and gradual 
transition by reducing the number of available screening appointments. These 
were compared to a situation in which the interval remains unchanged in a 
demographic model covering a 15-year period. The model was populated with 
observed parameters from England, a real-world setting recommending cervical 
screening with 3-year intervals at age 25-49 and 5-year intervals at age 50-64. 
Informed by typical changes currently considered by several European programmes 
including the programme in England, we explored the effect on screening test 
numbers of an extension of the 3-year interval to 5 years for women younger than 
50. All three extension scenarios resulted in similar cumulative numbers of 
screening tests, which were about 30% lower compared to a situation in which the 
interval would remain unchanged. However, the year-on-year variation in the 
number of screening tests varied between the scenarios. This variation was 
around 4-fold for the immediate scenario. In the stepped scenario, the yearly 
numbers could differ by around 20%, whereas in the gradual scenario they were 
virtually constant. A managed interval extension, transitioning different groups 
of the target population at different times, can substantially reduce the yearly 
variation in screening workload without increasing the total number of screening 
tests in the long term.

BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) pain significantly 
worsens cancer survivors' quality of life. Expectancy may play an important role 
in acupuncture response. We sought to explore whether expectancy predicts pain 
outcome in real acupuncture (RA) and sham acupuncture (SA) in cancer survivors.
METHODS: We analyzed data from a randomized clinical trial that evaluated the 
effect of RA on CIPN symptoms compared to SA and wait list control (WLC) in 75 
cancer survivors. This secondary analysis was limited to CIPN pain measured by 
the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), graded from 0 to 10. Interventions were 
delivered over 8 weeks. SA was implemented using a combination of 
non-acupuncture points and a non-insertion procedure. Patient expectancy was 
measured by the Acupuncture Expectancy Scale (AES) 3 times during the study. We 
used a linear regression model to evaluate if the NRS score was associated with 
the baseline AES score at the end of treatment (week 8), adjusting for baseline 
NRS score.
RESULTS: AES was similar among 3 groups at baseline (RA: 11.8 ± 2.7; SA: 
12.1 ± 3.8.; WLC: 14.6 ± 4.2; P = .062). Baseline AES was not found to be 
significantly associated with the week 8 NRS score among patients in all RA, SA, 
and WLC groups (all P > .05). However, we found a trend that higher baseline AES 
predicted lower NRS score at week 8 in the SA group: a one-point higher score on 
baseline expectancy was associated with a 0.3-point reduction in NRS pain score 
(P = .059) at week 8.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of baseline expectancy and acupuncture response was 
similar between RA and SA. However, SA seemed to rely more on expectancy than 
RA. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm this finding.

Global burden of disease morbidity and mortality has shifted dramatically in the 
last 30 years from infectious to non-communicable diseases, leading to major 
improvements in global child survival and enhanced life expectancy for all age 
groups. Vaccination efforts worldwide have been key to this achievement, but 
with a reduction in vaccine preventable diseases, anti-vaccine sentiments have 
concurrently increased. Eradication of smallpox in 1977 is a testament to 
vaccination impacts on human health. Despite this historic success, recent 
increases in infectious disease outbreaks, such as polio and measles, especially 
among poorly vaccinated populations, have underscored the risks of resurgence of 
diseases once thought eliminated in the United States and elsewhere. Engaging 
governments, community leaders, and the public will be critical to continuing 
the advancement of global health through elimination of vaccine preventable 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: No study to date has concomitantly reported the global burden of 
alopecia areata (AA) and its associated diseases.
METHODS: The crude and age-standardized rates of prevalence (ASPR), incidence 
(ASIR) and years lived with disability (YLDs) of AA were extracted from the 
global burden of disease, injuries and risk factors study (GBD) database between 
1990 and 2019 for 204 countries and territories. We stratified the analysis by 
global region, nation, sex, age and sociodemographic index (SDI) to dissect the
