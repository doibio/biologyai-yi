The malign contribution of northern industrial cities to the stagnation of 
national life expectancy over the period 1820-1870 forms part of one of the most 
long-running debates in English economic history, regarding the impact of early 
industrialisation on living standards. The deteriorating quality of urban water 
supplies often features in these arguments as the key driver of worsening 
mortality in this period. Here we use mortality reported from cholera in the 
epidemic years 1831-1832 and 1848-1849 as an indicator of the extent of sewage 
contamination of water in English and Welsh towns in this period. Surprisingly, 
the geography of reported mortality did not indicate that northern manufacturing 
and industrial towns were especially deficient in this respect. However, 
logistic regression analyses identified a number of risk factors for high 
cholera mortality, including location on coal-bearing strata, which was a 
feature of many industrial towns. Notably, however, textile-manufacturing towns, 
although often located in coal-rich districts, were associated with low levels 
of cholera mortality, and high population growth rates did not influence the 
risk of cholera. Reductions in cholera mortality after 1849 raise the 
possibility of widespread improvements in water quality after mid-century, 
rather earlier than is often assumed. However, in contrast to cholera, infant 
and diarrhoeal mortality remained high especially in northern towns until at 
least 1900. Several lines of evidence suggest that infants were relatively 
protected from waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid, and therefore 
did not benefit greatly from improvements in water quality. We conclude (1) that 
any worsening of water quality in urban areas c.1800-1850 was not confined to 
new͛ or rapidly growing industrial or manufacturing towns; and (2) infants 
probably rarely drank untreated water, so high infant or diarrhoeal mortality 
rates should not be read as indicators of poor water quality, in the English 
context.

Attainment of Quiet Standing in Humans: Are the Lower Limb Joints Controlled 
Relative to a Misaligned Postural Reference?

University, Liverpool, United Kingdom.

In human quiet standing, the relative position between ankle joint centre and 
line of gravity is neurally regulated within tight limits. The regulation of the 
knee and hip configuration is unclear and thought to be controlled passively. 
However, perturbed standing experiments have shown a lower limb multi-joint 
coordination. Here, measuring the relative alignment between lower limb joints 
and the line of gravity in quiet standing after walking, we investigated whether 
the configuration is maintained over time through passive mechanisms or active 
control. Thirteen healthy adults walked without following a path and then stood 
quietly for 7.6 s on a force platform (up to four trials). The transition 
between initiation and steady-state standing (7.6 s) was measured using motion 
capture. Sagittal lower limb joint centres' position relative to line of gravity 
(CoGAP) and their time constants were calculated in each trial. Ankle, knee, and 
hip joint moments were also calculated through inverse dynamics. After walking, 
the body decelerated (τ = 0.16 s). The ankle and hip joints' position relative 
to CoGAP measured at two time intervals of quiet standing (Mid = 0.5-0.55 s; End 
= 7.55-7.6 s) were different (mean ± SEM, CoGAP-Ankle_Mid = 47 ± 4 mm, 
CoGAP-Ankle_End = 58 ± 5 mm; CoGAP-Hip_Mid = 2 ± 5 mm, CoGAP-Hip_End = -5 ± 5 
mm). The ankle, knee, and hip flexion-extension moments significantly changed. 
Changes in joints position relative to CoGAP and misalignment suggest that joint 
position is not maintained over 7.6 s, but regulated relative to a standing 
reference. Higher joint moments at steady-state standing suggest mechanisms 
other than passive knee and hip regulation are involved in standing.

Fresh and dried Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim volatiles of two main cultivars 
including Dahongpao and Meihuajiao, were determined through GC-MS and compared. 
In all the tested samples, linalool, d-limonene, eucalyptol, 3-nonanone, and 
β-myrcene were identified as the five predominant components. The percentages of 
these components in fresh Dahongpao were 23.89%, 21.04%, 7.46%, 5.63% and 5.87%, 
respectively. Similar percentages, 27.28%, 17.62%, 6.39%, 1.66% and 7.8%, were 
found in dried Dahongpao. In general, the contents of linalool and β-myrcene in 
dried Dahongpao and Meihuajiao were slightly higher than those in fresh samples, 
whereas the contents of d-limonene, eucalyptol, and 3-nonanone were lower. 
Partial least squares discriminant analysis results showed that the two 
cultivars could be clearly differentiated based on volatiles, whereas, the fresh 
and dried Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim samples could not. This demonstrated that 
the drying process had no significant effect on the volatiles.

To establish the prevalence of etiological factors for dysphonia in elderly 
individuals in rural India. Hundred adults aged ≥ 65 years, who presented with 
dysphonia for ≥ 4 weeks and underwent detailed clinical evaluation including 
videolaryngoscopic assessment and other appropriate investigations/evaluation, 
were included in a retrospective cohort clinical study. Patients were classified 
into eight groups for further descriptive statistical analysis based on standard 
diagnostic criteria/guidelines i.e. benign vocal cord lesions, inflammatory 
disorders of the larynx, laryngeal and hypopharyngeal neoplasms, isolated vocal 
cord palsy/paresis, presbylaryngis, central neurological disorders affecting 
laryngeal function, impaired pulmonary function and non specific dysphonia. Mean 
age was 70.73 ± 4.29 years. 58% were aged between 65 and 69 years. Overall, the 
common causes for dysphonia were laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (23%), 
carcinoma larynx (12%) and presbylaryngis (8%). Inflammatory disorders of the 
larynx, benign vocal cord lesions and laryngeal/hypopharyngeal malignancies were 
the commonest causes for dysphonia in individuals aged between 65 and 74 years. 
Presbylaryngis and systemic causes were the commonest among individuals aged 
75-89 years. 63 males and 37 females met the inclusion criteria. The most common 
cause for dysphonia among females was laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (17%), 
followed by vocal palsy (5%) and spasmodic dysphonia (4%). Carcinoma larynx 
(12%) was the most common cause for dysphonia among males, followed by 
laryngopharyngeal reflux (6%) and presbylaryngis (6%). Geriatric dysphonia is an 
often overlooked symptom of greater underlying disease as evidenced in this 
study. With its impact on the quality of life in this age group and life 
expectancy in the rural population, dysphonia requires early detection, prompt 
evaluation and appropriate management.

OBJECTIVE: To show lung cancer (LC) mortality and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) in Mexico.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: With the visualization tools at the Global Burden of 
Disease Study website, we analyzed LC mortality and disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) by state, sex, socio- demographic index (SDI), age, and risk 
factors between 1990 and 2016.
RESULTS: Mortality rate decreased from 13.9 to 9.1 per 100 000 between 1990 and 
2016. This reduction is greater among men. However, deaths by LC rose from 5 478 
to 8 470. DALYs rate also decreased. Northern states with higher SDI face a 
larger burden from LC but exhibited greater reductions compared with southern, 
less developed states. The burden of LC is concentrated among older population. 
Smoking is the main risk factor for LC.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden by LC has decreased but is differential between states. 
LC threatens financially both the health system and individuals, since an 
important fraction of the population is not protected.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Mostrar la mortalidad y los años de vida saluda- bles 
(Avisas) perdidos por cáncer de pulmón (CP) en México.
MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: Con la herramienta de visualización del estudio de la Carga 
Global de la Enfermedad, se analizó mortalidad y Avisas por CP según diferentes 
criterios entre 1990 y 2016.
RESULTADOS: La tasa de mortalidad disminuyó de 13.9 a 9.1 por 100 000. Dicha 
reducción fue mayor entre hombres. Las muertes por CP crecieron de 5 478 a 8 
470. La tasa de Avisas se redujo. La carga del CP se concentra en grupos de edad 
avanzada. Los estados del norte, con mayor nivel sociodemográfico, enfrentan 
mayor carga, pero presen- taron mayores reducciones comparados con estados menos 
desarrollados. Fumar es el principal factor de riesgo para CP.
CONCLUSIONES: La carga por CP ha disminuido pero es diferencial entre estados. 
El CP amenaza financieramente el sistema de salud y la población, pues una 
fracción importante no está protegida.

Our understanding of spider reproductive biology is hampered by the vast 
anatomical diversity and difficulties associated with its study. Although 
authors agree on the two general types of female spider genitalia, haplogyne 
(plesiomorphic) and entelegyne (apomorphic), our understanding of variation 
within each group mostly concerns the external genital part, while the internal 
connections with the reproductive duct are largely unknown. Conventionally and 
simplistically, the spermathecae of haplogynes have simple two-way ducts, and 
those of entelegynes have separate copulatory and fertilization ducts for sperm 
to be transferred in and out of spermathecae, respectively. Sperm is discharged 
from the spermathecae directly into the uterus externus (a distal extension of 
the oviduct), which, commonly thought as homologous in both groups, is the 
purported location of internal fertilization in spiders. However, the structural 
evolution from haplo- to entelegyny remains unresolved, and thus the precise 
fertilization site in entelegynes is ambiguous. We aim to clarify this 
anatomical problem through a widely comparative morphological study of internal 
female genital system in entelegynes. Our survey of 147 epigyna (121 examined 
species in 97 genera, 34 families) surprisingly finds no direct connection 
between the fertilization ducts and the uterus externus, which, based on the 
homology with basal-most spider lineages, is a dead-end caecum in entelegynes. 
Instead, fertilization ducts usually connect with a secondary uterus externus, a 
novel feature taking over the functional role of the plesiomorphic uterus 
externus. We hypothesize that the transition from haplo- to entelegyny entailed 
not only the emergence of the two separate duct systems (copulatory, 
fertilization), but also involved substantial morphological changes in the 
distal part of the oviduct. Thus, the common oviduct may have shifted its distal 
connection from the uterus externus to the secondary uterus externus, perhaps 
facilitating discharge of larger eggs. Our findings suggest that the 
conventional model of entelegyne reproduction needs redefinition.

Are We Approaching a Biological Limit to Human Longevity?

Gavrilova NS(1), Gavrilov LA(1).

Illinois.

Until recently human longevity records continued to grow in history, with no 
indication of approaching a hypothetical longevity limit. Also, earlier studies 
found that age-specific death rates cease to increase at advanced ages 
(mortality plateau) suggesting the absence of fixed limit to longevity too. In 
this study, we reexamine both claims with more recent and reliable data on 
supercentenarians (persons aged 110 years and older). We found that despite a 
dramatic historical increase in the number of supercentenarians, further growth 
of human longevity records in subsequent birth cohorts slowed down significantly 
and almost stopped for those born after 1879. We also found an exponential 
acceleration of age-specific death rates for persons older than 113 years in 
more recent data. Slowing down the historical progress in maximum reported age 
at death and accelerated growth of age-specific death rates after age 113 years 
in recent birth cohorts may indicate the need for more conservative estimates 
for future longevity records unless a scientific breakthrough in delaying aging 
would happen. The hypothesis of approaching a biological limit to human 
longevity has received some empirical support and it deserves further study and 
testing.

Comprehensive reports of the caseload of donkeys and mules in veterinary 
hospitals in the United States are lacking. We compiled the information of the 
caseload of donkeys and mules at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the 
University of California, Davis for a ten-year period, from 2008 to 2017. The 
overall equid caseload was 94,147, of which 996 (1.06%) were donkeys and mules. 
Most of the neonates seen were mules. Most miniature donkeys were between 2 and 
10 years of age, and standard donkeys and mules were 10 to 20 years old. The 
body condition scores were predominantly high, especially in donkeys. Most 
miniature and standard donkeys resided in sanctuary and rescue farms and their 
use was not stated. Most mules were used for riding, packing or driving. Medical 
complaints represented 62% of the total visits and wellness visits represented 
38% of total visits. The donkeys and mules in the case population described here 
received a good standard of veterinary care with regular vaccinations, 
deworming, routine dental care, and treatment of ailments. Our study is the 
first report of the life expectancy, use, body condition, preventative health 
and veterinary medical care of a population of donkeys and mules in the western 
United States.

BACKGROUND: From a causal point of view, there exists a set of socioeconomic 
indicators concerning life expectancy. The objective of this paper is to 
determine the indicators which exhibit a relation of causality with life 
expectancy at birth.
METHODS: Our analysis applies the Granger causality test, more specifically its 
version by Dumitrescu-Hurlin, starting from the information concerning life 
expectancy at birth and a set of socioeconomic variables corresponding to 17 
Spanish regions, throughout the period 2006-2016. To do this, we used the panel 
data involving the information provided by the Spanish Ministry of Health, 
Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare (MHCSW) and the National Institute of 
Statistics (NIS).
RESULTS: Per capita income, and the rate of hospital beds, medical staff and 
nurses Granger-cause the variable "life expectancy at birth", according to the 
Granger causality test applied to panel data (Dumitrescu-Hurlin's version).
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy at birth has become one of the main indicators able 
to measure the performance of a country's health system. This analysis 
facilitates the identification of those factors which exhibit a unidirectional 
Granger-causality relationship with life expectancy at birth. Therefore, this 
paper provides useful information for the management of public health resources 
from the point of view of the maximization of social benefits.

BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) alone has nine out of every 10 children 
living with HIV globally and monitoring in this setting remains suboptimal, even 
as these children grow older. With scalability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), 
several HIV-infected children are growing towards adolescence (over 2.1 
million), with the potentials to reach adulthood. However, despite an overall 
reduction in HIV-related mortality, there are increasing deaths among 
adolescents living with HIV (ADLHIV), with limited evidence for improved 
policy-making. Of note, strategies for adolescent transition from pediatrics to 
adult-healthcare are critical to ensure successful treatment response and longer 
life expectancy. Interestingly, with uptakes in prevention of mother-to-child 
transmission, challenges in ART programs, and high viremia among children in 
SSA, the success rate of paediatric ART might be quickly jeopardised, with 
possible HIV-1 drug-resistance (HIVDR) emergence, especially after years of 
paediatric ART exposure. Therefore, monitoring ART response in adolescents and 
evaluating HIVDR patterns might limit disease progression and guide on 
subsequent ART options for SSA ADLHIV.
OBJECTIVES: Among Cameroonian ADLHIV receiving ART, we shall evaluate the rate 
of immunovirologic failure, acquired HIVDR-associated mutations, HIV-1 subtype 
distribution, genetic variability in circulating (plasma) versus archived 
(cellular) viral strains, and HIVDR early warning indicators (EWIs) at different 
time-points.
METHODS: A prospective and observational study will be conducted among 250 
ADLHIV (10-19 years old) receiving ART in the centre region of Cameroon, and 
followed-up at 6 and 12 months after enrollment. Following consecutive sampling 
at enrolment, plasma viral load and CD4/CD8 count will be measured, and 
genotypic resistance testing (GRT) will be performed both in plasma and in buffy 
coat for participants experiencing virological failure (two consecutive viremia 
> = 1000 copies/ml). Plasma viral load and CD4/CD8 will be monitored for all 
participants at 6 and 12 months after enrolment. HIVDR-EWIs will be monitored 
and survival analysis performed during the 12 months follow-up. Primary outcomes 
are rates of virological failure, acquired-HIVDR, and mortality.
DISCUSSION: Our findings will provide evidence-based recommendations to ensure 
successful transition from paediatrics to adult ART regimens and highlight 
further needs of active ART combinations, for reduced morbidity and mortality in 
populations of ADLHIV within SSA.

BACKGROUND: This study, undertaken in Bangkok, Thailand, explored the extent to 
which paediatric residents in a non-Western setting experienced burnout and the 
potential association with factors in the medical educational climate and 
work-related quality of life.
METHODS: An exploratory sequential mixed methods design was employed in a 
cross-sectional study. The initial, quantitative phase used the validated 
Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environmental 
Measure (PHEEM) and Work-Related Quality of Life scale (WRQoL). Regression 
analysis was used to identify the correlation between burnout and educational 
climate. Thereafter, residents in all years with high levels of burnout on 
subscales were interviewed individually.
RESULTS: Forty-one paediatric residents completed the three questionnaires. None 
had high levels related to burnout in all three domains (emotional exhaustion, 
high level of depersonalization and perceived low personal accomplishment), 
seven (17%) showed high levels in two out of three domains. Emotional exhaustion 
and educational climate (perceptions of role autonomy, perceptions of teaching, 
perceptions of social support) were correlated with work-related quality of 
life. In the interviews, the main themes related to burnout were inappropriate 
tasks, teachers and teaching styles, the perception of knowledge insecurity 
relating to task performance, time dimensions, life crisis during training, role 
expectations and work allocation clarity, and facilities such as accommodation.
CONCLUSIONS: The study, in a non-Western setting, demonstrated a positive 
relation between educational climate and work-related quality of life. To help 
reduce the risk of burnout, the following factors were identified: minimize 
unnecessary or duplicated workload, schedule time arrangements to avoid 
extension of regular duty hours, and clearly define role expectations. The 
impact of inappropriate tasks, teachers and teaching styles (including unsafe 
environment) on the incidence of burnout was also highlighted. Additional 
studies focusing on teaching styles, safe learning climate and mistreatment in a 
non-Western context are needed.

BACKGROUND: Although the black-white gap in life expectancy has narrowed in the 
U.S., there is considerable variability across states. In Wisconsin, the 
black-white gap exceeds 6 years, well above the national average. Reducing this 
disparity is an urgent public health priority, but there is limited 
understanding of what contributes to Wisconsin's racial gap in longevity. Our 
investigation identifies causes of death that contribute most to Wisconsin's 
black-white gap in life expectancy among males and females, and highlights 
specific ages where each cause of death contributes most to the gap.
METHODS: Our study employs 1999-2016 restricted-use mortality data provided by 
the National Center for Health Statistics. After generating race- and 
sex-specific life tables for each 3-year period of observation (e.g., 
1999-2001), we trace recent trends in the black-white life expectancy gap in 
Wisconsin. We subsequently conduct a series of analyses to decompose the 
black-white gap in three time periods into 13 separate causes and 19 different 
age groups.
RESULTS: In 2014-16, Wisconsin's black-white gap in life expectancy was 
7.34 years for males (67% larger than the national gap), and 5.61 years for 
females (115% larger than the national gap). Among males, homicide was the 
single largest contributor, accounting for 1.56 years of the total gap. Heart 
disease and cancer followed, contributing 1.43 and 1.42 years, respectively. 
Among females, heart disease and cancer were the two leading contributors to the 
gap, accounting for 1.12 and 1.00 years, respectively. Whereas homicide 
contributed most to the racial gap in male longevity during late adolescence and 
early adulthood, heart disease and cancer exerted most of their influence 
between ages 50-70 for both males and females. Other notable contributors were 
unintentional injuries (males), diabetes and cerebrovascular disease (females), 
and perinatal conditions (males and females).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies targets for future policy interventions that 
could substantially reduce Wisconsin's racial gap in life expectancy. Concerted 
efforts to eliminate racial disparities in perinatal mortality and homicide 
early in the life course, and chronic conditions such as cancer and heart 
disease in later life, promise to help Wisconsin achieve the public health 
objective of racial parity in longevity.

BACKGROUND: Innovations that extend life can generate option value and cost of 
experiencing future technologies.
OBJECTIVES: To understand how consideration of option value may affect the 
potential cost-effectiveness of a treatment through a case study of ipilimumab 
for previously untreated metastatic melanoma.
METHODS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of ipilimumab in 2 scenarios: a 
conventional scenario, for which we constructed the model using the standard 
methods that rely on efficacy data directly from the phase III trial of 
ipilimumab, and an option value scenario, where we incorporated future 
hypothetical improvements in mortality for metastatic melanoma owing to 
innovations. We developed 2 approaches to incorporate option value. In the first 
approach, we forecasted mortality trends based on historical trends from the 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program registry. 
Alternatively, we identified drugs being studied in clinical trials at the time 
of ipilimumab's approval on clinicaltrials.gov and estimated their likelihood 
and timing of approval, potential efficacy, and cost. We accounted for increases 
in overall cancer treatment cost and unrelated medical cost in the option value 
scenario.
RESULTS: In the option value scenario, using the SEER approach, the incremental 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and the incremental cost increased by 
6.2% and 3.8%, respectively, whereas the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) decreased by 2.3% compared with the conventional scenario. Using the 
clinicaltrials.gov approach, the incremental QALY gained and the incremental 
cost increased by 7.5% and 7.1%, respectively, whereas the ICER decreased by 
0.40%.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed generalizable approaches to estimating option value in 
cost-effectiveness analysis.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Common health state valuation methodology, such as 
time tradeoff (TTO) and standard gamble (SG), is typically applied under several 
descriptively invalid assumptions, for example, related to linear 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or expected utility (EU) theory. Hence, the 
current use of results from health state valuation exercises may lead to biased 
QALY weights, which may in turn affect decisions based on economic evaluations 
using such weights. Methods have been proposed to correct responses for the 
biases associated with different health state valuation techniques. In this 
article we outline the relevance of prospect theory (PT), which has become the 
dominant descriptive alternative to EU, for health state valuations and economic 
evaluations.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We provide an overview of work in this field, which aims to 
remove biases from QALY weights. We label this "the corrective approach." By 
quantifying PT parameters, such as loss aversion, probability weighting, and 
nonlinear utility, it may be possible to correct TTO and SG responses for biases 
in an attempt to produce more valid estimates of preferences for health states. 
Through straightforward examples, this article illustrates the effects of this 
corrective approach and discusses several unresolved issues that currently limit 
the relevance of corrected weights for policy.
CONCLUSIONS: Suggestions for research addressing these issues are provided. 
Nonetheless, if validly corrected health state valuations become available, we 
argue in favor of using these in economic evaluations.

BACKGROUND: The Short Form 6 Dimension (SF-6D) is a multi-attribute utility 
instrument derived from the Short-Form 36 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) 
quality of life questionnaire and is used to calculate quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) on a scale 0 to 1. The SF-6Dv2 is a new version of the SF-6D.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the consistency of respondents' 
answers to 3 different methods to administer this new version.
METHODS: SF-6Dv2 utility values were generated from the SF-36v2 using the 
following: (1) full questionnaire with 36 items (SF-6Dv2SF-36); (2) subset 
questionnaire with 10 items (SF-6Dv2ind-10); (3) SF-6Dv2 administered as an 
independent instrument (rephrased questionnaire with only 6 items 
[SF-6Dv2ind-6]). The order of the 3 instruments was randomly allocated between 
respondents.
RESULTS: A total of 782 respondents from Quebec, Canada, were interviewed, out 
of whom 697 fully completed the survey. Very few deviations in respondents' 
answers were observed between the 3 instruments, with mean weighted kappa of 
0.79 (range 0.61-0.91) and mean global consistency index of 70% (range 54-83). 
Maximal difference in utility values generated was found between SF-6Dv2ind-10 
and SF-6Dv2ind-6 (mean difference 0.016, P < .01), whereas minimal difference 
was found between SF-6Dv2SF-36 and SF-6Dv2ind-10 (0.002, P = .38). No ceiling 
effect was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The SF-6Dv2 was designed to derive utilities from the SF-36v2, and 
our results indicate that it is still preferable to use the full questionnaire, 
although the difference with other variants of the questionnaire is very small. 
To use the SF-6Dv2 as an independent instrument will thus introduce minimal bias 
in utility values generated.

BACKGROUND: Occupational injury is a cause of premature mortality, mainly in 
low- and middle-income countries. Occupational injuries estimated to kill more 
than 300,000 workers worldwide every year. We estimated the years of life lost 
(YLL) of fatal unintentional occupational injuries in Iran for the five years of 
2012-2016.
STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.
METHODS: To estimate the YLL, registered deaths due to occupational 
unintentional injury were identified from the Iranian Legal Medicine 
Organization. Estimated YLL was calculated according to Global Burden of Disease 
2010 guideline. Population life expectancy in each corresponding years was 
retrieved from the national health database. All data collected entered into 
Excel software for calculations.
RESULTS: In 2012-2016, fatal unintentional occupational injuries were the cause 
of 8,606 deaths in Iran, resulting in 4.6 prematurely lost life yr per 1000 
males and 0.3 yr per 1000 females among workers, every year. 98.7% of the deaths 
occurred in males. Males from 15 to 19 yr of age and females from 10 to 14 yr of 
age showed the highest YLL rates. The rate of YLLs per 1,000 workers per year 
was 3.99 overall, 4.6 in males, and 0.4 in females.
CONCLUSION: Premature mortality due to occupational injury is still a serious 
problem in the Iranian population. Our findings may be useful from a health 
policy perspective for designing and prioritizing interventions focused on the 
prevention of premature loss of life. Known prevention strategies need to be 
implemented widely to diminish avoidable injuries in the workplace.

Genome-wide comparison of phylogenetic trees is becoming an increasingly common 
approach in evolutionary genomics, and a variety of approaches for such 
comparison have been developed. In this article we present several methods for 
comparative analysis of large numbers of phylogenetic trees. To compare 
phylogenetic trees taking into account the bootstrap support for each internal 
branch, the boot-split distance (BSD) method is introduced as an extension of 
the previously developed split distance (SD) method for tree comparison. The BSD 
method implements the straightforward idea that comparison of phylogenetic trees 
can be made more robust by treating tree splits differentially depending on the 
bootstrap support. Approaches are also introduced for detecting treelike and 
netlike evolutionary trends in the phylogenetic Forest of Life (FOL), i.e., the 
entirety of the phylogenetic trees for conserved genes of prokaryotes. The 
principal method employed for this purpose includes mapping quartets of species 
onto trees to calculate the support of each quartet topology and so to quantify 
the tree and net contributions to the distances between species. We describe the 
applications methods used to analyze the FOL and the results obtained with these 
methods. These results support the concept of the Tree of Life (TOL) as a 
central evolutionary trend in the FOL as opposed to the traditional view of the 
TOL as a "species tree."

The plasma proteome offers a clinically useful window into human health. Recent 
advances from highly multiplexed assays now call for appropriate pipelines to 
validate individual candidates. Here, a workflow is developed to build dual 
binder sandwich immunoassays (SIA) and for proteins predicted to be secreted 
into plasma. Utilizing suspension bead arrays, ≈1800 unique antibody pairs are 
first screened against 209 proteins with recombinant proteins as well as EDTA 
plasma. Employing 624 unique antibodies, dilution-dependent curves in plasma and 
concentration-dependent curves of full-length proteins for 102 (49%) of the 
targets are obtained. For 22 protein assays, the longitudinal, interindividual, 
and technical performance is determined in a set of plasma samples collected 
from 18 healthy subjects every third month over 1 year. Finally, 14 of these 
assays are compared with with SIAs composed of other binders, proximity 
extension assays, and affinity-free targeted mass spectrometry. The workflow 
provides a multiplexed approach to screen for SIA pairs that suggests using at 
least three antibodies per target. This design is applicable for a wider range 
of targets of the plasma proteome, and the assays can be applied for discovery 
but also to validate emerging candidates derived from other platforms.

Exenatide (Ex) is a 39-amino acid peptide of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
receptor agonist that was approved by the FDA in 2005 as a Type II diabetes 
treatment. It shows a 53% homology with GLP-1 but has an extended half-life (ca. 
2.4 h) relative to GLP-1 (ca. 2-3 min). In this study, to further extend its in 
vivo half-life, we constructed a fusion protein (Ex-(EBP)10-6xHis) using a 
biocompatible and inert elastin-based polypeptide (EBP) as a fusion partner. 
Valine was inserted into the guest position of the pentapeptide (VPGXG), no 
linker sequence was inserted in between the EBPs, and (EBP)10-6xHis tag was 
attached to the C-terminus of exenatide. By using a recombinant Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae expression system, the fusion protein was expressed and secreted to 
the broth and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Compared with the 
native exenatide, the physical half-life of the fusion protein was ca. 3.7-fold 
extended while approximately 72% of the in-vitro insulin secreting activity was 
maintained. However, the biological half-life measured by a glucose tolerance 
test (GTT) and the hypoglycemic test in mice was not significantly different 
from that of the native form. The effects of EBPylation on bioactivity and 
half-life of the fusion protein are similar to those of PEGylation. The result 
suggests that the bioactivity and half-life should be carefully balanced to 
obtain optimal fusion proteins. We expect that EBPylation using an optimal 
repeat number of EBP can be an alternative to chemical modification for 
therapeutic biobetters with extended half-life.

BACKGROUND: The quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-CRM has 
been shown to be immunogenic and well-tolerated in infants and toddlers. We 
evaluated antibody persistence for up to 4 years after vaccination with 
MenACWY-CRM in the first years of life and response to a booster dose 
administered at 60 months of age.
METHODS: This was phase 3b, open-label, multicenter extension trial
