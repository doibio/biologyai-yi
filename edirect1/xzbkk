head other than superficial injuries to the face. Head injury is the commonest 
cause of death and disability in people aged 1–40 years in the UK. Data for head 
injury are recorded in the Hospital Episode Statistics 
(http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hes). Each year, 1.4 million people attend emergency 
departments in England and Wales with a recent head injury. Between 33% and 50% 
of these are children aged under 15 years. Annually, about 200,000 people are 
admitted to hospital with head injury. Of these, one-fifth have features 
suggesting skull fracture or have evidence of brain damage. Most patients 
recover without specific or specialist intervention, but others experience 
long-term disability or even die from the effects of complications that could 
potentially be minimised or avoided with early detection and appropriate 
treatment. The incidence of death from head injury is low, with as few as 0.2% 
of all patients attending emergency departments with a head injury dying as a 
result of this injury. Ninety five per cent of people who have sustained a head 
injury present with a normal or minimally impaired conscious level (Glasgow Coma 
Scale [GCS] greater than 12) but the majority of fatal outcomes are in the 
moderate (GCS 9–12) or severe (GCS 8 or less) head injury groups, which account 
for only 5% of attenders. Therefore, emergency departments see a large number of 
patients with minor or mild head injuries and need to identify the very small 
number who will go on to have serious acute intracranial complications. It is 
estimated that 25–30% of children aged under 2 years who are hospitalised with 
head injury have an abusive head injury. This guideline has updated some of the 
terminology used in relation to safeguarding children and vulnerable adults. The 
previous head injury guideline produced by NICE in 2003 (NICE clinical guideline 
4) and updated in 2007 (NICE clinical guideline 56) resulted in CT scanning 
replacing skull radiography as the primary imaging modality for assessing head 
injury. It also led to an increase in the proportion of people with severe head 
injury having their care managed in specialist centres. This has been associated 
with a decline in fatality among patients with severe head injury. This update 
is needed because of the continuing importance of up-to-date evidence-based 
guidance on the initial assessment and early management of head injury. 
Appropriate guidance can enable early detection and treatment of 
life-threatening brain injury, where present, but also early discharge of 
patients with negligible risk of brain injury. It can therefore save lives while 
at the same time preventing needless crowding in emergency departments and 
observation wards. Further key NHS changes have driven the scope of this update. 
These include the introduction in 2012 of regional trauma networks with major 
trauma triage tools within NHS England; the extension of indications for 
anticoagulation therapy; the expanding use of biomarkers to guide emergent 
clinical management in other conditions, such as chest pain; and the 
establishment of local safeguarding boards. The last of these addresses the 
requirement for front-line clinical staff to assess not only the severity of the 
head injury but also why it occurred.

MR Imaging in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: From Magnet to Bedside.

Bogaert J(1), Olivotto I.

Author information:

Herestraat 49, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium (J.B.); and Referral Center for Myocardial 
Diseases, Azienda Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy (I.O.).

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ), the most common 
genetically transmitted cardiac disorder, has been the focus of extensive 
research over the past 50 years. HCM hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a 
multifaceted disease with highly heterogeneous genetic background, phenotypic 
expression, clinical presentation, and long-term outcome. Though most patients 
have an indolent course with a life expectancy comparable to that of the general 
population, early diagnosis and accurate risk profiling are essential to 
identify the sizeable subset at increased risk of sudden cardiac death or 
disease progression and heart failure-related complications, requiring 
aggressive management options. Imaging has a central role in the diagnosis and 
prognostic assessment of HCM hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients, as well as 
screening of potentially affected family members. In this context, magnetic 
resonance (MR) imaging has recently emerged as an ideal complement to 
transthoracic echocardiography. Its multiparametric approach, fusing spatial, 
contrast, and temporal resolution, provides the clinician with detailed 
characterization of the HCM hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype and assessment 
of its functional consequences including causes and site of dynamic obstruction, 
presence and extent of myocardial perfusion abnormalities, and fibrosis. 
Moreover, MR is key in differentiating HCM hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from 
"phenocopies"-that is, hearts with similar morphology but profoundly different 
etiology, such as amyloid or Anderson-Fabry disease. Long term, the incremental 
information provided by MR is relevant to planning of septal reduction 
therapies, identification of the early stages of end-stage progression, and 
stratification of arrhythmic risk. The aim of this review is to depict the 
increasingly important role of MR imaging in relation to the complexity of HCM 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , highlighting its role in clinical decision making.

BACKGROUND: Healthy Outlook is a service delivered by the UK Met Office directly 
to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that has been in 
place since 2006. Its objective is to reduce the severity and length of COPD 
exacerbations, hence improving the quality of life and life expectancy.
AIMS: To assess the effect of the Healthy Outlook service on hospital admission 
rates of all general practitioners that have used the service.
METHODS: Control practices were selected for each of the 661 participating 
practices. The number of hospital admissions for each practice was extracted 
from the Hospital Episode Statistics database. The differences in admission 
rates per practice between the first year of use of the Healthy Outlook service 
and the previous year were compared by paired t-test analyses.
RESULTS: For admissions with a primary diagnosis of COPD, the difference between 
participating and control practices was -0.8% (95% confidence interval (CI)=-1.8 
to 0.2%; P=0.13). For admissions with a primary or co-morbid diagnosis of COPD, 
the difference was -2.3% (95% CI=-4.2 to -0.4%; P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Participation in the Healthy Outlook service reduces hospital 
admission rates for patients coded on discharge with COPD (including co-morbid).

Multiple CT scans are often done on the same patient resulting in an increased 
risk of cancer. Prior publications have estimated risks on a population basis 
and often using an effective dose. Simply adding up the risks from single scans 
does not correctly account for the survival function. A methodology for 
estimating personal radiation risks attributed to multiple CT imaging using 
organ doses is presented in this article. The estimated magnitude of the 
attributable risk fraction for the possible development of radiation-induced 
cancer indicates the necessity for strong clinical justification when ordering 
multiple CT scans.

BACKGROUND: Surgical and medical treatments for emphysema may affect both 
quality and quantity of life. The purpose of this article is to report outcomes 
from the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) using an index that combines 
quality and quantity of life.
METHODS: This was a prospective randomized clinical trial. Following pulmonary 
rehabilitation, 1,218 patients with severe emphysema were randomly assigned to 
maximal medical therapy or to lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). A generic 
quality-of-life measure, known as the Quality of Well-being Scale (QWB), was 
administered at baseline and again at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months 
following treatment assignment.
RESULTS: At baseline, QWB scores were comparable for the Medical and LVRS 
groups. For both groups, scores significantly improved following the 
rehabilitation program. The QWB scores before death for patients in the LVRS 
group improved up to the year 2 visit, whereas scores for the Medical group 
dropped significantly following the baseline visit. Imputing zeros (0) for 
death, QWB scores decreased significantly for both groups. With or without 
scoring death as 0, the LVRS group achieved better outcomes, and the significant 
differences were maintained until the sixth year. Over 6 years of follow-up, 
LVRS produced an average of 0.30 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), or the 
equivalent of about 3.6 months of well life.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with maximal medical therapy alone, patients undergoing 
maximal medical therapy plus LVRS experienced improved health-related quality of 
life and gained more QALYs.

BACKGROUND: One Health addresses complex challenges to promote the health of all 
species and the environment by integrating relevant sciences at systems level. 
Its application to zoonotic diseases is recommended, but few coherent frameworks 
exist that combine approaches from multiple disciplines. Rabies requires an 
interdisciplinary approach for effective and efficient management.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A framework is proposed to assess the value of 
rabies interventions holistically. The economic assessment compares additional 
monetary and non-monetary costs and benefits of an intervention taking into 
account epidemiological, animal welfare, societal impact and cost data. It is 
complemented by an ethical assessment. The framework is applied to Colombo City, 
Sri Lanka, where modified dog rabies intervention measures were implemented in 
2007. The two options included for analysis were the control measures in place 
until 2006 ("baseline scenario") and the new comprehensive intervention measures 
("intervention") for a four-year duration. Differences in control cost; monetary 
human health costs after exposure; Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost 
due to human rabies deaths and the psychological burden following a bite; 
negative impact on animal welfare; epidemiological indicators; social acceptance 
of dogs; and ethical considerations were estimated using a mixed method approach 
including primary and secondary data. Over the four years analysed, the 
intervention cost US $1.03 million more than the baseline scenario in 2011 
prices (adjusted for inflation) and caused a reduction in dog rabies cases; 738 
DALYs averted; an increase in acceptability among non-dog owners; a perception 
of positive changes in society including a decrease in the number of roaming 
dogs; and a net reduction in the impact on animal welfare from intermediate-high 
to low-intermediate.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings illustrate the multiple outcomes relevant to 
stakeholders and allow greater understanding of the value of the implemented 
rabies control measures, thereby providing a solid foundation for informed 
decision-making and sustainable control.

Adipose tissue-derived microvascular fragments from aged donors exhibit an 
impaired vascularisation capacity.

Adipose tissue-derived microvascular fragments are promising vascularisation 
units for applications in the field of tissue engineering. Elderly patients are 
the major future target population of such applications due to an increasing 
human life expectancy. Therefore, we herein investigated the effect of aging on 
the fragments' vascularisation capacity. Microvascular fragments were isolated 
from epididymal fat pads of adult (8 months) and aged (16 months) C57BL/6 donor 
mice. These fragments were seeded onto porous polyurethane scaffolds, which were 
implanted into dorsal skinfold chambers to study their vascularisation using 
intravital fluorescence microscopy, histology and immunohistochemistry. 
Scaffolds seeded with fragments from aged donors exhibited a significantly lower 
functional microvessel density and intravascular blood flow velocity. This was 
associated with an impaired vessel maturation, as indicated by vessel wall 
irregularities, constantly elevated diameters and a lower fraction of 
CD31/α-smooth muscle actin double positive microvessels in the implants' border 
and centre zones. Additional in vitro analyses revealed that microvascular 
fragments from adult and aged donors do not differ in their stem cell content as 
well as in their release of angiogenic growth factors, survival and 
proliferative activity under hypoxic conditions. However, fragments from aged 
donors exhibit a significantly lower number of matrix metalloproteinase 
-9-positive perivascular cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that 
aging is a crucial determinant for the vascularisation capacity of isolated 
microvascular fragments.

Conservative growth hormone/IGF-1 and mTOR signaling pathways as a target for 
aging and cancer prevention: do we really have an antiaging drug?

Institute of Oncology, St. Petersburg, Russia.

Inactivation of the GH/insulin/IGF-1 signaling molecules corresponding genes as 
well as the inactivation of serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR increases life 
span in nematodes, fruit flies and mice. Evidence has emerged that antidiabetic 
biguanides and rapamycin are promising candidates for pharmacological 
interventions leading to both life span extension and prevention of cancer. The 
available data on the relationship of two fundamental processes--aging and 
carcinogenesis--have been suggested to be a basis for understanding these 
two-side effects of biguanides and rapamycin.

Limiting the use of primary endocrine therapy in elderly women with breast 
cancer.

(1)Department of General Surgery, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore.

Primary endocrine therapy (PET) is often included as a treatment option in 
elderly women with operable breast cancer. Elderly women tend to have 
pre-existing comorbidities and are often reluctant to undergo surgery. The 
benefit of surgery needs to be weighed against a relatively higher potential for 
operative morbidity and mortality, and a limited life expectancy. But while PET 
can provide relatively good locoregional control, it is not curative in nature 
and the possibility of local complications and metastasis remains. We 
retrospectively reviewed the outcome of PET in a series of 19 elderly women, 
older than 70 years of age, who had presented with operable non-metastatic 
breast cancer. Only about a third of these women were deemed medically unfit for 
surgery; the rest had declined surgery. Compliance was an issue, with almost 
half of these patients defaulting treatment and follow-up. Local control was 
achieved in most patients, but disease progression did occur in 5 patients. 
Three of these patients received additional treatment; which included surgery in 
1 patient. PET should therefore not be considered an equivalent alternative to 
surgery in elderly women who were fi t to undergo surgery. However, having 
observed that only 1 of the 6 deaths in our study was related to breast cancer, 
PET does have a role in women whose life expectancy is more likely to be limited 
by coexisting morbidities than the breast cancer itself.

Quality of life and time to death: have the health gains of preventive 
interventions been underestimated?

Gheorghe M(1), Brouwer WB(1), van Baal PH(1).

Author information:

Assessment Erasmus University Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

This article explores the implications of the relation between quality of life 
(QoL) and time to death (TTD) for economic evaluations of preventive 
interventions. By using health survey data on QoL for the general Dutch 
population linked to the mortality registry, we quantify the magnitude of this 
relationship. For addressing specific features of the nonstandard QoL 
distribution such as boundness, skewness, and heteroscedasticity, we modeled QoL 
using a generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) with 
a β inflated outcome distribution. Our empirical results indicate that QoL 
decreases when approaching death, suggesting that there is a strong relationship 
between TTD and QoL. Predictions of different regression models revealed that 
ignoring this relationship results in an underestimation of the quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gains for preventive interventions. The underestimation ranged 
between 3% and 7% and depended on age, the number of years gained from the 
intervention, and the discount rate used.

AIM: The aim of this prospective substudy was to estimate the cost-effectiveness 
of treating paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) with radiofrequency catheter 
ablation (RFA) compared with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) as first-line 
treatment.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A decision-analytic Markov model, based on MANTRA-PAF 
(Medical Antiarrhythmic Treatment or Radiofrequency Ablation in Paroxysmal 
Atrial Fibrillation) study data, was developed to study long-term effects and 
costs of RFA compared with AADs as first-line treatment. Positive clinical 
effects were found in the overall population, a gain of an average 0.06 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to an incremental cost of €3033, resulting 
in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €50 570/QALY. However, the result 
of the subgroup analyses showed that RFA was less costly and more effective in 
younger patients. This implied an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
€3434/QALY in ≤50-year-old patients respectively €108 937/QALY in >50-year-old 
patients.
CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency catheter ablation as first-line treatment is a 
cost-effective strategy for younger patients with paroxysmal AF. However, the 
cost-effectiveness of using RFA as first-line therapy in older patients is 
uncertain, and in most of these AADs should be attempted before RFA (MANTRA-PAF 
ClinicalTrials.gov number; NCT00133211).

AIMS: Increase in life expectancy has led to increased rate of implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation in patients in their 80s, but 
there are no current formal recommendations to guide physicians when elderly 
patients with ICDs require elective unit replacement (EUR). This study aims at 
assessing survival and rates of ICD therapies in patients who have had ICD 
implantation or EUR above the age of 80, focusing on the latter.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively kept database of 
all ICD-related procedures carried out in a single tertiary centre. Patients 80 
years of age or older submitted to ICD implantation (n = 42) or EUR (n = 34) 
between November 1991 and May 2012 were included. Using collected baseline and 
outcome data from this cohort, we assessed survival of these patients and the 
rates of ICD therapies. Median additional years of life after ICD implantation 
and ICD EUR in patients who died before data retrieval was 2.5 and 1.2, 
respectively, and while 65% of deceased patients after ICD implantation died in 
the first 3 years after the procedure, 50% of deceased post-ICD EUR patients 
died within the first year. Mortality rates at 1 and 2 years post-EUR were 23.1 
and 38.1%, respectively. Furthermore, ventricular tachycardia occurred in a 
small minority of patients after EUR (16.7%) and no ventricular 
fibrillation-triggered ICD therapies were reported in both groups.
CONCLUSION: In octogenarians who are due for an ICD EUR, careful thought should 
be given to the current clinical status, comorbidities, and general frailty 
prior to considering them for the procedure. A survival benefit from ICD EUR in 
this age stratum is not likely.

Cost-utility analyses in spine care: a qualitative and systematic review.

Author information:
(1)*Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY; and †Weill Medical College of 
Cornell University, New York, NY.

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was performed to identify US-based cost-utility 
analyses (CUA) studies in spine care and to critically evaluate the quality of 
the available literature.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There has been a recent trend in the United States 
toward increased publication of economic analyses in spine care. The 
cost-effectiveness of spine interventions and the quality of published 
literature is not well understood.
METHODS: A MEDLINE search was conducted to identify cost analyses in spine care. 
Articles were excluded on the basis of the following criteria: nonspine care, 
nonoperative, non-US based, nonclinical, and not CUA. Of the 424 screened 
articles, 20 met inclusion criteria. Quality of studies was assessed using the 
Quality of Health Economic Studies instrument.
RESULTS: Evidence for the cost-effectiveness of operative spinal intervention is 
varied. The majority of available studies report favorable cost-effectiveness 
ratios, however, a few studies suggest that certain operative interventions are 
not cost-effective. Average Quality of Health Economic Studies score of all 
included studies was 75.1 (60-93). The quality of evidence is variable and there 
are a number of weaknesses in the available literature, most significant of 
which is that few studies adopt a long-term time horizon or have sufficient 
follow-up (N = 3/20). High Quality of Health Economic Studies scoring studies 
were more likely to have sensitivity analysis (P = 0.016), societal cost 
perspective (P = 0.014), and a funding disclosure (P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: There is a small but rapidly growing body of US-based CUA in spine 
care. The quality of CUA evidence is variable but there are significant 
opportunities to strengthen future CUA studies in spine. This study highlights 
the need for more attention to CUA research and the quality of these studies in 
spine care.

BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic 
diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population 
increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical 
activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study 
provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a 
tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty.
METHODS: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three 
times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The 
intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus 
Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA 
opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention 
conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly 
Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention 
started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime 
horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the 
model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight 
into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated.
RESULTS: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based 
intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, 
breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a 
result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of 
€20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as 
the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 
5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed 
intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was 
the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the 
Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding 
environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without 
environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in 
adults aged over 50.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The current study was registered at the Dutch Trial Register 
(NTR2297; April 26th 2010).

End-of-life matters in chronic renal failure.

Berman N(1).

Author information:
(1)aWeill Cornell Medical College bRogosin Institute, New York, New York, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The population considered eligible for dialysis has expanded 
dramatically over the past 4 decades, so that a significant proportion of 
patients receiving renal replacement therapy are elderly, frail and infirm. 
These patients have an extremely limited life expectancy and suffer from 
significant symptom burden, similar to patients with other end-stage organ 
failure or cancer. As dialysis has been offered more broadly, it is now 
initiated earlier than in decades past, further adding to cost and patient 
burden.
RECENT FINDINGS: The trend toward more expansive and intensive care has not been 
corroborated by robust data. In response, an increasing number of studies has 
focused on establishing reasonable limits to renal replacement therapy. Multiple 
authors have explored the role of conservative kidney management for high-risk 
dialysis patients as an alternative to dialysis, which may offer similar 
survival and improved quality of life in certain populations. For those who 
chose dialysis, deferring initiation until the patient becomes symptomatic may 
be a reasonable. Evidence-based symptom management guidelines for dialysis 
patients remain largely absent, with few proven approaches. Hospice and 
palliative care resources remain underutilized.
SUMMARY: For a subset of dialysis patients, palliative care and conservative 
kidney management are appropriate and underutilized.

DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase and LILACS. Chief Dental Officers worldwide were 
contacted to request conference reports, theses, government reports and 
unpublished survey data.
STUDY SELECTION: Selection was carried out independently by two reviewers. 
Longitudinal or crossover studies based on random samples representing national, 
subnational or community populations with SP defined as; a community periodontal 
index of treatment needs (CPITN) score of four, a clinical attachment loss (AL) 
more than 6 mm, or a gingival PD more than 5 mm.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction and synthesis followed Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 standards and modeled using a Bayesian 
meta-regression tool developed for the GBD 2010. Countries were grouped in 21 
regions and seven super-regions by geographical proximity and mean age of death.
RESULTS: Seventy two studies involving 291,170 patients were included. The 
majority of these (65) were prevalence studies. In 2010, SP was the sixth-most 
prevalent condition, affecting 10.8% (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 
10.1%-11.6%) or 743 million people worldwide. Between 1990 and 2010 the global 
age-standardised prevalence of SP in the entire population was static at 11.2% 
(95% UI: 10.4%-11.9% in 1990 and 10.5%-12.0% in 2010) a non-significant increase 
from the 1990 incidence of SP. The age-standardised incidence of SP in 2010 was 
701 cases per 100,000 person-years (95% uncertainty interval: 599-823), a 
non-significant increase from the 1990 incidence of SP. Prevalence increased 
gradually with age, showing a steep increase between the third and fourth 
decades of life that was driven by a peak in incidence at around 38 years of 
age.
CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers need to be aware of a predictable increasing burden 
of SP due to the growing world population associated with an increasing life 
expectancy and a massive decrease in the prevalence of tooth loss throughout the 
world from 1990 to 2010. These changes underscore the enormous public health 
challenge posed by SP and are a microcosm of the epidemiologic transition to 
non-communicable diseases occurring in many countries.

OBJECTIVE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and 
disability, leading to great personal suffering and huge costs to society. 
Integrated knowledge on epidemiology, economic consequences and disease burden 
of TBI is scarce but essential for optimizing healthcare policy and preventing 
TBI. This study aimed to estimate incidence, cost-of-illness and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of TBI in the Netherlands.
METHODS: This study included data on all TBI patients who were treated at an 
Emergency Department (ED - National Injury Surveillance System), hospitalized 
(National Medical Registration), or died due to their injuries in the 
Netherlands between 2010-2012. Direct healthcare costs and indirect costs were 
determined using the incidence-based Dutch Burden of Injury Model. Disease 
burden was assessed by calculating years of life lost (YLL) owing to premature 
death, years lived with disability (YLD) and DALYs. Incidence, costs and disease 
burden were stratified by age and gender.
RESULTS: TBI incidence was 213.6 per 100,000 person years. Total costs were 
€314.6 (USD $433.8) million per year and disease burden resulted in 171,200 
DALYs (on average 7.1 DALYs per case). Men had highest mean costs per case 
(€19,540 versus €14,940), driven by indirect costs. 0-24-year-olds had high 
incidence and disease burden but low economic costs, whereas 25-64-year-olds had 
relatively low incidence but high economic costs. Patients aged 65+ had highest 
incidence, leading to considerable direct healthcare costs. 0-24-year-olds, men 
aged 25-64 years, traffic injury victims (especially bicyclists) and home and 
leisure injury victims (especially 0-5-year-old and elderly fallers) are 
identified as risk groups in TBI.
CONCLUSIONS: The economic and health consequences of TBI are substantial. The 
integrated approach of assessing incidence, costs and disease burden enables 
detection of important risk groups in TBI, development of prevention programs 
that target these risk groups and assessment of the benefits of these programs.

Netherlands.

AIM: The objective of this study was to explore the cost-effectiveness of 
D-dimer biomarker and the societal value (headroom) of a hypothetical perfect 
biomarker for risk assessment and subsequent treatment stratification of 
prophylactic treatment for peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
PATIENTS & METHODS: Decision analytic modeling.
RESULTS: Use of the D-dimer biomarker to prescribe oral anticoagulants in the 
high-risk subset of patients is a cost-effective healthcare intervention. The 
headroom (societal willingness to pay multiplied by incremental quality-adjusted 
life years) available for the hypothetical perfect biomarker amounted to 
€83,877.
CONCLUSION: D-dimer-based PAD risk assessment and treatment tailoring is cost 
effective. Identification of high-risk PAD patients and prescription of oral 
anticoagulants could potentially save substantial costs and improve chances of 
survival for high-risk PAD patients. However, further research of risk 
stratifying biomarkers test accuracy is needed to support and strengthen the 
results of this modeling study.

BACKGROUND: For decades Indigenous peoples have argued for health research 
reform claiming methods used and results obtained often reflect the exploitative 
history of colonisation. In 2006 the Kimberley Aboriginal Health Planning Forum 
(KAHPF) Research Subcommittee (hereafter, the Subcommittee) was formed to 
improve research processes in the remote Kimberley region of north Western 
Australia. This paper explores the major perceptions, attitudes and concerns of 
stakeholders in the Subcommittee.
METHODS: Qualitative analysis was carried out on data retrospectively collected 
from multiple evidentiary sources linked to the Subcommittee i.e. database, 
documents, interviews, review forms and emails from 1 January 2007 to 31 October 
2013.
RESULTS: From 1 January 2007 to 30 June 2013 the Subcommittee received 95 
proposals, 57 (60%) driven by researchers based outside the region. Local 
stakeholders (22 from 12 different Kimberley organisations) raised concerns 
about 36 (38%) projects, 30 (83%) of which were driven by external researchers. 
Major concerns of local stakeholders were inadequate community consultation and 
engagement; burden of research on the region; negative impact of research 
practices; lack of demonstrable community benefit; and power and control of 
research. Major themes identified by external stakeholders (25 external 
researchers who completed the review form) were unanticipated difficulties with 
consultation processes; barriers to travel; perceiving research as a competing 
priority for health services and time-consuming ethics processes. External 
stakeholders also identified strategies for improving research practices in the 
Kimberley: importance of community support in building good relationships; 
employing local people; flexibility in research approaches; and importance of 
allocating sufficient time for consultation and data collection.
CONCLUSIONS: Health research in the Kimberley has improved in recent years, 
however significant problems remain. Prioritising research addressing genuine 
local needs is essential in closing the gap in Indigenous life expectancy. The 
long-term aim is for local health service connected researchers to identify 
priorities, lead, conduct and participate in the majority of local health 
research. For this to occur, a more radical move involving reconceptualising the 
research process is needed. Changes to institutional timeframes and funding 
processes could improve Indigenous and community-based research.

Changing the choice architecture of ageing: live different and 'catch old'.

Gale D(1).

Author information:
(1)Independent Researcher, UK.

Physical ageing and being old are broadly feared or denied, particularly by the 
young (Chittister 2008: 53). The future is viewed in terms of vague, looming, 
disabilities, despite the fact that no one can know their personal, ageing fate. 
As physical and functional limitations become more apparent over time, expected 
validation occurs in support of the conventional narrative of decline. It is 
necessary to understand the traditional negative perceptions about ageing if we 
are to alter them. At present, they do not match the unfolding realities of what 
it means to grow old, in the early twenty-first century.The challenge of the new 
longevity is learning to navigate the unexplored life terrain between middle and 
extreme age. How, then, can we redefine this life stage, navigate new pathways 
for growing old in order to maximize the untapped contributions of the largest 
and longest ever living cohort? The baby boomers (born 1946-1964) are not 
homogenous but they are in position to become the standard bearers for a new 
narrative and an alternative way to live differently, while ageing.This will 
require changes to choice architecture and decision making about personal ageing 
that will challenge long held attitudes, perceptions and mindsets. Hence, 
changing the narrative about living long and well is the void addressed 
here.Life is ultimately terminal. In the interim, the process of catching old by 
living different is the ultimate, life enhancing skill. It is all in the 
choosing.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence highlighting the effectiveness of 
patient decision aids (PtDAs), but evidence supporting their cost-effectiveness 
is lacking. We consider patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), in whom a 
PtDA may decrease nonadherence to treatment by empowering patients to receive 
the option that is most congruent with their own values.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential costs and benefits of delivering a PtDA to 
patients with moderate OSA.
METHODS: A Markov cohort decision-analytic model was developed for patients with 
moderate OSA, comparing a PtDA to usual care over 5 years from a societal 
perspective. Data for patient preference for treatment options was taken from a 
recent randomized crossover trial, event data (cardiovascular, motor vehicle 
accidents) came from national databases and published literature. Potential 
improvements in adherence are unknown, so we considered a realistic range of 
values. Outcome measures were 5-year costs (in 2010 Canadian dollars), 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: When adherence to treatment was unchanged, the PtDA strategy was 
dominated by incurring lower QALYs and higher costs. When nonadherence was 
decreased by 20% in the PtDA arm (corresponding to an increase in adherence from 
63% to 70% for continuous positive airway pressure and from 77% to 82% for 
mandibular advancement splints in year 1), the ICER fell to $62,414/QALY. Costs 
associated with the treatment devices and delivering the PtDA had the greatest 
effect on cost-effectiveness.
LIMITATIONS: The model relies on surrogate measures and opinions for key 
parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of PtDAs will depend on contextual factors, 
but a framework is described for properly considering their long-term 
cost-effectiveness. A number of important questions around the appropriateness 
of benefit measurement for PtDA trials are highlighted.

INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of Hepatitis C (HCV) in Spain is 2,5%, with a high 
morbimortality rate. Triple therapy based on telaprevir plus 
peginterferon/ribavirin ([T/PR]) has demonstrated to be an effective approach in 
treatment-naïve G1-HCV patients. This analysis evaluated, through a Markov 
model, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of triple therapy compared to 
peginterferon/ ribavirin ([PR]) alone in naïve patients depending on fibrosis 
stage, from the Spanish Healthcare Authorities perspective.
METHODS: Efficacy results and adverse events incidence were based on the 
combined results of ADVANCE and OPTIMIZE studies. Adverse events and 
disease-related costs (€, 2014) were built up from panel expert opinion except 
from transplant and post-transplant costs, taken from published data. Drug costs 
were obtained from national databases and adjusted for the mandatory deduction. 
Outcomes and costs were both discounted at 3%/year.
RESULTS: The analysis shows higher costs and improved outcomes associated with 
[TR/PR] relative to [PR] alone, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of €18,288/ QALY for all the cohort, €14,152QALY for moderate 
fibrosis, €11,364QALY for bridging fibrosis, €15,929/QALY for cirrhosis. Over a 
lifetime period, the use of [T/PR] could avoid 12 cirrhosis and 4 liver 
transplants per 1,000 patients compared to [PR] alone. The probabilistic 
analysis, following 10,000 Montecarlo simulations, demonstrated the probability 
of an ICER below a €30,000/QALY gained threshold of 69%. At a willingness- 
to-pay of €30,000/QALY, [T/PR] could be considered as an efficient option 
compared with [PR] alone for treatment-naïve genotype 1 HCV patients, over a 
lifetime horizon.

(VHC) se asocia a una elevada morbi-mortalidad. El tratamiento combinado de 
telaprevir y peginterferon/ribavirina ([T/PR]) es eficaz en pacientes con 
VHC-G1. El objetivo primario de este estudio fue evaluar la relación 
coste-utilidad (RCUI) de [T/PR] versus peginterferon alfa 2a/ribavirina ([PR]) 
en pacientes naïve VHC-G1, según el grado de fibrosis y bajo la perspectiva del 
sistema sanitario español.
METODOLOGÍA: La eficacia y la incidencia de efectos adversos (EAs) se obtuvieron 
de los estudios ADVANCE y OPTIMIZE. La estimación de los costes de 
monitorización, de manejo de EAs y de la enfermedad por estados de salud (€,
