participants; very low-certainty evidence). Recurrent platinum-resistant EOC PLD 
alone compared to another conventional chemotherapy likely results in little to 
no difference in OS (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.19; 6 studies, 1995 participants; 
moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of 
PLD on PFS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04; 4 studies, 1803 participants; very 
low-certainty evidence), overall severe adverse events (grade ≥ 3) (RR ranged 
from 0.61 to 0.97; 2 studies, 964 participants; very low-certainty evidence), 
anaemia (grade ≥ 3) (RR ranged from 0.19 to 0.82; 5 studies, 1968 participants; 
very low-certainty evidence), HFS (grade ≥ 3) (RR ranged from 15.19 to 109.15; 6 
studies, 2184 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and the rate of 
neurological events (grade ≥ 3)(RR ranged from 0.08 to 3.09; 3 studies, 1222 
participants; very low-certainty evidence). PLD with conventional chemotherapy 
compared to PLD alone likely results in little to no difference in OS (HR 0.92, 
95% CI 0.70 to 1.21; 1 study, 242 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and 
it may result in little to no difference in PFS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.22; 2 
studies, 353 participants; low-certainty evidence). The combination likely 
increases overall severe adverse events (grade ≥ 3) (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.98 to 
3.09; 1 study, 663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and anaemia (grade 
≥ 3) (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.87; 2 studies, 785 participants; 
moderate-certainty evidence), but likely results in a large reduction in HFS 
(grade ≥ 3) (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.40; 2 studies, 785 participants; 
moderate-certainty evidence). It may result in little to no difference in 
neurological events (grade ≥ 3) (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.31; 1 study, 663 
participants; low-certainty evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In platinum-sensitive relapsed EOC, including PLD in a 
combination chemotherapy regimen probably makes little to no difference in OS 
compared to other combinations, but likely improves PFS. Choice of chemotherapy 
will therefore be guided by symptoms from previous chemotherapy and other 
patient considerations. Single-agent PLD remains a useful agent for 
platinum-resistant relapsed EOC and choice of agent at relapse will depend on 
patient factors, e.g. degree of bone marrow suppression or neurotoxicity from 
previous treatments. Adding another agent to PLD likely increases overall grade 
≥ 3 adverse events with little to no improvement in survival outcomes. The 
limited evidence relating to PLD in combination with other agents in 
platinum-resistant relapsed EOC does not indicate a benefit, but there is some 
evidence of increased side effects.

Publisher: 배경: 난소암, 나팔관암, 복막암으로 통칭되는 난소암은 여성에서 8번째로 흔한 암이며 종종 진행된 단계에서 진단된다. 재발된 
상피성 난소암(EOC) 여성은 건강 상태가 좋지 않고 기대 수명이 제한되어 있으므로 효과적인 증상 조절로 삶의 질을 유지하는 것이 치료의 중요한 
목표이다. 그러나 화학요법제의 원치 않는 효과는 심각할 수 있으며 최적의 치료 요법은 불분명하다. doxorubicin 
hydrochloride라고 불리는 세포 독성 약물을 포함하는 Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin(PLD)은 재발된 
EOC의 치료를 위해 고려할 수 있는 여러 치료 양식 중 하나이다. 이것은 2013년 7호에 게시된 원래 Cochrane Review의 
업데이트이다. 목적: 재발한 고도 상피성 난소암(EOC)이 있는 여성에서 다른 항암제와 병용하거나 병용하지 않는 PLD의 효능과 안전성을 
평가한다. 검색 전략: 1990년부터 2022년 1월까지 CENTRAL, MEDLINE(Ovid를 통해) 및 Embase(Ovid를 통해)를 
검색했다. 또한 온라인 임상 시험 등록부, 과학 회의 초록 및 포함된 연구의 참조 목록을 검색했다. 선정 기준: 재발성 상피성 난소암으로 
진단받은 여성에서 PLD를 평가한 무작위 대조 시험(RCT)을 포함했다. 자료 수집 및 분석: 2명의 검토 저자가 사전 설계된 데이터 수집 
형식으로 독립적으로 데이터를 추출하고 Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 
가이드라인에 따라 비뚤림 위험을 평가했다. 가능한 경우 수집된 데이터를 메타 분석에 통합했다. 주요 결과: 이것은 12개의 추가 연구가 포함된 
이전 검토의 업데이트이므로 이 업데이트된 검토에는 재발성 EOC에서 PLD 단독 또는 다른 약물과의 조합의 효과를 평가한 8277명의 참가자가 
포함된 총 26개의 RCT가 포함된다: platinum에 민감한 질병에서 7개( 참가자 2872명); platinum 내성 질환 11위(참가자 
3,246명); platinum 민감도 상태에 관계없이 개인을 모집한 8명(참가자 2079명). 포함된 RCT에서 확인된 8개의 비교 중 
임상적으로 가장 관련성이 높은 3개의 비교에 대해 근거의 확실성을 평가했다. platinum에 민감한 EOC 재발 기존 화학요법제를 사용한 
PLD는 대체 병용 화학요법과 비교하여 전체 생존(OS)에 거의 또는 전혀 차이가 없을 가능성이 높다(위험비(HR) 0.93, 95% 신뢰 
구간(CI) 0.83~1.04, 5개 연구, 2006년 참가자, 중간‐ 근거 확실성) 그러나 무진행 생존(PFS)을 증가시킬 가능성이 있다(HR 
0.81, 95% CI 0.74~0.89; 5개 연구, 2006년 참가자; 근거 확실성 중간). 조합은 무작위 배정 후 3개월에 삶의 질을 약간 
향상시킬 수 있다. 유럽 암 연구 및 치료 기관 삶의 질 설문지 C30(평균 차이 4.80, 95% CI 0.92 ~ 8.68; 1건의 연구, 
608명의 참가자; 낮은 확실성 근거), 그러나 이것은 임상적으로 의미 있는 차이를 나타내지 않을 수 있다. 대체 화학요법과 비교하여 다른 
화학요법제와 PLD를 병용하면 전체 중증 이상반응(등급 ≥ 3)(위험비(RR) 1.11, 95% CI 0.95~1.30, 2건의 연구, 
834명의 참가자, 중간 정도의 근거 확실성). 화학 요법을 사용한 PLD는 빈혈을 증가시킬 가능성이 높다(등급 ≥ 3)(RR 1.37, 95% 
CI 1.02 ~ 1.85, 5개 연구, 1961명의 참가자, 근거 확실성 중간). 기존 화학요법을 사용한 PLD가 수족증후군(HFS)(등급 ≥ 
3)(RR 4.01, 95% CI 1.00~16.01; 2개 연구, 1028명 참가; 매우 낮은 불확실성 근거)과 신경학적 사건(등급 ≥ 
3)(RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20~0.74; 4, 1900명 참가; 매우 낮은 불확실성 근거)에 대한 영향에 대한 근거는 매우 
불확실하다. platinum 내성 EOC 재발 다른 기존 화학 요법과 비교하여 PLD 단독은 OS의 차이가 거의 또는 전혀 없을 가능성이 
높다(HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 ~ 1.19; 6건의 연구, 1995명의 참가자; 근거 확실성 중간). PFS에 대한 PLD의 
효과(HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 ~ 1.04; 4건의 연구, 1803명의 참가자; 매우 낮은 근거 확실성), 전반적인 심각한 
부작용(등급 ≥ 3)(RR 범위는 0.61 ~ 0.97; 2개의 연구, 964명의 참가자; 매우 낮은 근거 확실성), 빈혈(등급 ≥ 3)(RR 
범위는 0.19에서 0.82까지; 5개의 연구, 1968명의 참가자; 매우 낮은 근거 확실성), HFS(등급 ≥ 3) ( RR 범위는 
15.19~109.15, 6건의 연구, 2184명의 참여자, 매우 낮은 근거 확실성) 및 신경학적 사건의 비율(등급 ≥ 3)(RR의 범위는 
0.08~3.09, 3건의 연구, 1222명의 참여자, 매우 낮은 근거 확실성)에 대한 근거는 매우 불확실하다. PLD 단독과 비교하여 기존 
화학 요법을 사용한 PLD는 OS의 차이가 거의 또는 전혀 없을 가능성이 높으며(HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70 ~ 1.21; 1건의 
연구, 242명의 참가자, 근거 확실성 중간) PFS의 차이가 거의 또는 전혀 없을 수 있다. (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73 ~ 
1.22, 2건의 연구, 353명의 참가자, 근거 확실성 낮음). 이 조합은 전반적인 심각한 부작용(등급 ≥ 3)(RR 2.48, 95% CI 
1.98~3.09; 1건의 연구, 663명의 참가자, 근거 확실성 중간) 및 빈혈(등급 ≥ 3)(RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.46~3.87, 
2개 연구, 785명 참가자, 근거 확실성 중간)을 증가시킬 가능성이 있지만, HFS(등급 ≥ 3)(RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.14 ~ 
0.40, 2개 연구, 785명 참가자, 중간 확실성 근거)가 크게 감소할 가능성이 있다. 신경학적 사건(등급 ≥ 3)(RR 1.40, 95% 
CI 0.85~2.31; 1건의 연구, 663명의 참가자; 낮은 확실성 근거)의 결과 차이가 거의 또는 전혀 없을 수 있다. 연구진 결론: 
platinum 민감성 재발 EOC에서 병용 화학요법 요법에 PLD를 포함하는 것은 아마도 다른 병용과 비교하여 OS의 차이가 거의 또는 전혀 
없지만 PFS를 개선할 가능성이 있다. 따라서 화학 요법의 선택은 이전 화학 요법의 증상 및 기타 환자 고려 사항에 따라 결정된다. 단일 제제 
PLD는 platinum 내성 재발 EOC에 유용한 제제로 남아 있으며 재발 시 제제 선택은 이전 치료의 골수 억제 또는 신경 독성 정도와 같은 
환자 요인에 따라 달라진다. PLD에 다른 제제를 추가하면 생존 결과가 거의 또는 전혀 개선되지 않고 전체 등급 ≥ 3 이상 반응이 증가할 
가능성이 높다. platinum 내성 재발 EOC에서 다른 약제와 함께 PLD와 관련된 제한된 근거는 이점을 나타내지 않지만 증가된 부작용에 
대한 일부 근거가 있다.

Palliative care involves an approach aimed at improving the quality of life of 
patients and their families, who are forced to cope with the problems associated 
with life-threatening diseases. This definition includes a growing group of 
patients around the world. It requires an extension of the definition of 
patients in need of palliative care in countries such as Russia and a 
significant improvement in the work of nursing personnel with these patients. 
This study aims to determine the level of preparedness of nursing personnel for 
specialized care (transcultural care) and the quality of care provided to 
palliative patients. The presented findings of the study demonstrate the 
relevance of developing transcultural competence, which enables significant 
improvement in the quality of life of palliative patients. The analysis of 
medical workers' assessment of the level of specific training and their 
intercultural preparedness was conducted based on hospices (Moscow). A survey 
was conducted among 113 medical workers of the middle level of education aged 
between 28 and 56 (average of 44.2 years) and experience in palliative care 
ranged from 3 to 18 years (average of 9.5 years). The Intercultural Readiness 
Check (IRC) test, widely used to assess nursing staff worldwide, was used for 
the survey to determine the level of readiness for transcultural care. A strong 
correlation was found between a number of the test scales and measures of 
participants' age and experience. The presented material demonstrates the 
realization of an interdisciplinary approach to the issues of specific training 
of nursing personnel in the field of "transcultural care" in providing 
palliative care to incurable patients.

Cancer represents one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Conventional 
clinical treatments include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and 
targeted therapy. However, these treatments have inherent limitations, such as 
multidrug resistance and the induction of short- and long-term multiple organ 
damage, ultimately leading to a significant decrease in cancer survivors' 
quality of life and life expectancy. Paeonol, a nature active compound derived 
from the root bark of the medicinal plant Paeonia suffruticosa, exhibits various 
pharmacological activities. Extensive research has demonstrated that paeonol 
exhibits substantial anticancer effects in various cancer, both in vitro and in 
vivo. Its underlying mechanisms involve the induction of apoptosis, the 
inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion and migration, angiogenesis, cell 
cycle arrest, autophagy, regulating tumor immunity and enhanced 
radiosensitivity, as well as the modulation of multiple signaling pathways, such 
as the PI3K/AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways. Additionally, paeonol can prevent 
adverse effects on the heart, liver, and kidneys induced by anticancer therapy. 
Despite numerous studies exploring paeonol's therapeutic potential in cancer, no 
specific reviews have been conducted. Therefore, this review provides a 
systematic summary and analysis of paeonol's anticancer effects, prevention of 
side effects, and the underlying mechanisms involved. This review aims to 
establish a theoretical basis for the adjunctive strategy of paeonol in cancer 
treatment, ultimately improving the survival rate and enhancing the quality of 
life for cancer patients.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate 6-month efficacy and safety of low-sodium oxybate 
in people with idiopathic hypersomnia during an open-label extension period 
(OLE) of a phase 3 clinical trial.
METHODS: Efficacy measures included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), 
Idiopathic Hypersomnia Severity Scale (IHSS), Patient Global Impression of 
Change (PGIc), Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, short version 
(FOSQ-10), and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific 
Health Problem (WPAI:SHP). Treatment-emergent adverse events were collected 
throughout the OLE.
RESULTS: The OLE population included 106 participants. Most were female (71%) 
and White (83%), and the mean (SD) age was 41.0 (13.8) years. ESS scores 
decreased (improved) during the OLE (mean [SD], study baseline: 16.3 [2.8]; OLE 
week 2: 6.7 [4.7]; OLE end: 5.3 [3.7]), and IHSS total scores trended toward a 
decrease (study baseline: 32.6 [7.3]; OLE week 2: 16.2 [8.9]; OLE end: 14.8 
[8.6]. Median (minimum, maximum) paired differences from OLE week 2 to OLE end 
were ESS, -1.0 (-20, 7; nominal P = .012); IHSS, -1.0 (-31, 19; nominal P = 
.086). The proportion of participants reporting PGIc ratings of "very much 
improved" increased from 36.7% at OLE week 2 to 53.8% at the OLE end. The 
FOSQ-10 and WPAI:SHP scores remained stable during OLE. The incidence of newly 
reported treatment-emergent adverse events decreased over the duration of the 
OLE.
CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy and safety of low-sodium oxybate were maintained or 
improved during the 6-month OLE, supporting long-term treatment with low-sodium 
oxybate in adults with idiopathic hypersomnia.

AIM: To examine the cost-effectiveness of adding canagliflozin or dapagliflozin 
to standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone in patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a Markov microsimulation model to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of canagliflozin plus SoC (canagliflozin + SoC), 
dapagliflozin plus SoC (dapagliflozin + SoC) and SoC alone. Analyses were 
conducted from a healthcare system perspective. Costs were measured in 2021 
Canadian dollars (C$), and effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime, canagliflozin + SoC and dapagliflozin + SoC 
yielded cost savings of C$33 460 and C$26 764 and generated 1.38 and 1.44 
additional QALYs compared with SoC alone, respectively. While QALY gains with 
dapagliflozin + SoC were higher than those with canagliflozin + SoC, this 
strategy was also more costly with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
exceeding the willingness to pay threshold of C$50 000 per QALY. 
Dapagliflozin + SoC, however, generated cost savings and QALY gains compared 
with canagliflozin + SoC over shorter time horizons of 5 or 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin + SoC was not cost-effective versus 
canagliflozin + SoC in patients with CKD and T2D over the lifetime horizon. 
However, adding canagliflozin or dapagliflozin to SoC was less costly and more 
effective relative to SoC alone for treatment of CKD and T2D.

Contributions of declining mortality, overall and from HIV, TB and malaria, to 
reduced health inequality and inequity across countries.

The objective to reduce global health inequalities and inequities is integral to 
the global development agenda, from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to 
the sustainable development goals and the ongoing response to coronavirus 
disease. Yet, summary measures of global health gains or of the 
cost-effectiveness of global health programmes barely capture how well they 
improve the lives of the most disadvantaged populations. This paper instead 
explores the distribution of global health gains across countries and the 
implications for health inequality and inequity (here referring to health 
disadvantages that reinforce economic disadvantage, and vice versa) across 
countries. Specifically, it studies the distribution of gains in life expectancy 
across countries (overall and owing to reduced mortality from HIV, TB and 
malaria), using the Gini index and a concentration index ranking countries by 
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita as indicators of health inequality and 
inequity. By these counts, global inequality in life expectancy across countries 
declined by one-third between 2002 and 2019. Reduced mortality from HIV, TB and 
malaria accounted for one-half of this decline. Fifteen countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa, containing 5% of the global population, accounted for 40% of the global 
decline in inequality, with nearly six-tenth of this contribution coming from 
HIV, TB and malaria. Inequity in life expectancy across countries declined by 
nearly 37%, with a contribution from HIV, TB and malaria of 39% of this gain. 
Our findings show how simple indicators on the distribution of health gains 
across countries usefully complement aggregate measures of global health gains 
and underscore their positive contribution to the global development agenda.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It has been hypothesized that a discrepancy between 
pretreatment expectations and perceived outcomes is a significant source of 
patient dissatisfaction. Currently, there is lack in understanding and tools to 
assess patient expectations regarding the outcomes of treatment for spinal 
metastases. The objective of this study was therefore to develop a patient 
expectations questionnaire regarding the outcomes after surgery and/or 
radiotherapy for spinal metastases.
METHODS: A multiphase international qualitative study was conducted. Phase 1 of 
the study included semistructured interviews with patients and relatives to 
understand their expectations of the outcomes of treatment. In addition, 
physicians were interviewed about their communication practices with patients 
regarding treatment and expected outcomes. In phase 2, items were developed 
based on the results of the interviews in phase 1. In phase 3, patients were 
interviewed to validate the content and language of the questionnaire. Selection 
of the final items was based on feedback from patients regarding content, 
language, and relevance.
RESULTS: In phase 1, 24 patients and 22 physicians were included. A total of 34 
items were developed for the preliminary questionnaire. After phase 3, a total 
of 22 items were retained for the final version of the questionnaire. The 
questionnaire is divided into 3 sections: (1) patient expectations regarding 
treatment outcomes, (2) prognosis, and (3) consultation with the physician. The 
items cover expectations related to pain, analgesia requirements, daily and 
physical function, overall quality of life, life expectancy, and information 
provided by the physician.
CONCLUSION: The new Patient Expectations in Spine Oncology questionnaire was 
developed to evaluate patient expectations regarding the outcomes after 
treatment for spinal metastases. The Patient Expectations in Spine Oncology 
questionnaire will allow physicians to systematically assess patient 
expectations of planned treatment and thus help guide patients toward realistic 
expectations of treatment outcome.

Drawing on the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) theory, this study examines the 
relationship between workplace incivility and workers' psychological well-being. 
A related aim is to examine the link between workers' religiosity and their 
well-being, with workplace incivility moderating this nexus. Data were collected 
from 247 employees identified from private sectors (in Jordan and the UAE) via 
online-survey questionnaire. Factor analysis and hierarchical moderated multiple 
regression models were used to test the hypotheses. Study results show that 
workers' religiosity is positively and significantly associated with their 
psychological well-being, while workplace incivility is negatively (but 
insignificantly) associated with workers' psychological well-being. In addition, 
and contrary to our expectations and prior studies, our results suggest that 
workplace incivility strengthens the direct relationship between religiosity and 
well-being. The mechanism of this intersection may propose that rude and uncivil 
treatments positively predict self-blame, something that may lead the targets to 
become more religious to get recovery from different types of incivility and 
stressful life events. This study highlights the contextual applicability and 
possible extension of the JD-R theory through extending its model to religiosity 
and well-being of employees in a diverse cultural context in the Middle East.

PURPOSE: End-stage renal disease patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD) have a 
shortened life expectancy compared to the general population. The aim of this 
study was to evaluate a possible link between three new and emerging factors in 
renal pathophysiology: Klotho protein, telomere length in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (TL) and redox status parameters before HD (bHD) and after HD 
(aHD), and to test mortality prediction capability of these emerging parameters 
in a population of HD patients.
METHODS: The study included 130 adult patients with average age 66 (54-72), on 
HD (3 times per week; 4-5 h per session). Klotho level, TL, routine laboratory 
parameters, dialysis adequacy and redox status parameters: advanced oxidation 
protein products (AOPP), prooxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB), superoxide anion 
(O2.-), malondialdehyde (MDA), ischemia-modified albumin (IMA), total sulfhydryl 
group content (SHG), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined.
RESULTS: Klotho concentration was significantly higher aHD; 68.2 (22.6-152.9) 
vs. bHD 64.2 (25.5-119.8) (p = 0.027). The observed increase in TL was not 
statistically significant. AOPP, PAB, SHG, and SOD activity were significantly 
increased aHD (p > 0.001). The patients with the highest mortality risk score 
(MRS) had significantly higher PAB bHD (p = 0.002). Significantly lower O2.- 
(p < 0.001), SHG content (p = 0.072), and IMA (p = 0.002) aHD were found in 
patients with the lowest MRS values. Principal component analysis revealed redox 
balance-Klotho factor as a significant predictor of high mortality risk 
(p = 0.014).
CONCLUSION: Decreased Klotho and TL attrition as well as redox status 
disturbance could be connected with higher mortality rate in HD patients.

Breakthroughs in medical research in the last century have led to a significant 
extension of the human lifespan, resulting in a shift towards an elderly 
population worldwide. Due to the ongoing progress of global development towards 
elevated standards of living, this study specifically examines Switzerland as a 
representative nation to explore the socioeconomic and healthcare ramifications 
associated with an ageing population, thereby highlighting the tangible impact 
experienced in this context. Beyond the exhaustion of pension funds and medical 
budgets, by reviewing the literature and analysing publicly available data, we 
observe a "Swiss Japanification". Old age is associated with late-life 
comorbidities and an increasing proportion of time spent in poor health. To 
address these problems, a paradigm shift in medical practice is needed to 
improve health rather than respond to existing diseases. Basic ageing research 
is gaining momentum to be translated into therapeutic interventions and provides 
machine learning tools driving longevity medicine. We propose that research 
focus on closing the translational gap between the molecular mechanisms of 
ageing and a more prevention-based medicine, which would help people age better 
and prevent late-life chronic diseases.

This systematic review explored the outcomes of current interventions to 
increase sleep duration in healthy young people (14-25 years). Nine databases 
were systematically searched, and 26 studies were included in this review. 
Quality assessment of the included studies was evaluated using two tools: the 
Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and Cochrane Risk of Bias. The interventions 
incorporated a range of strategies including behavioral (46.2%), educational 
(26.9%), a combination of behavioral and educational (15.4%), and other 
strategies such as physical therapy (11.5%). The findings indicate that 
behavioral and combination interventions were consistently effective in 
increasing sleep duration in healthy young people. Educational interventions 
alone were less effective at increasing young people's sleep duration. Of all 
the included studies, only one randomized control trial but none of the 
non-randomized trials were rated as good quality. Our findings suggest a 
combination of strategies with an emphasis on personalization of intervention 
could possibly maximize the chances of success at improving sleep duration in 
healthy young people. More high-quality studies with long-term assessments (≥ 6 
months) should be conducted to test the efficacy and durability of interventions 
to increase sleep duration in young people, as well as the clinical implications 
to mental and physical health.

OBJECTIVES: Information on how life expectancy, disability-free life expectancy, 
and quality-adjusted life expectancy varies across equity-relevant subgroups is 
required to conduct distributional cost-effectiveness analysis. These summary 
measures are not comprehensively available in the United States, given 
limitations in nationally representative data across racial and ethnic groups.
METHODS: Through linkage of US national survey data sets and use of Bayesian 
models to address missing and suppressed mortality data, we estimate health 
outcomes across 5 racial and ethnic subgroups (non-Hispanic American Indian or 
Alaska Native, non-Hispanic Asian and Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic black, 
non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic). Mortality, disability, and social determinant 
of health data were combined to estimate sex- and age-based outcomes for 
equity-relevant subgroups based on race and ethnicity, as well as county-level 
social vulnerability.
RESULTS: Life expectancy, disability-free life expectancy, and quality-adjusted 
life expectancy at birth declined from 79.5, 69.4, and 64.3 years, respectively, 
among the 20% least socially vulnerable (best-off) counties to 76.8, 63.6, and 
61.1 years, respectively, among the 20% most socially vulnerable (worst-off) 
counties. Considering differences across racial and ethnic subgroups, as well as 
geography, gaps between the best-off (Asian and Pacific Islander; 20% least 
socially vulnerable counties) and worst-off (American Indian/Alaska Native; 20% 
most socially vulnerable counties) subgroups were large (17.6 life-years, 20.9 
disability-free life-years, and 18.0 quality-adjusted life-years) and increased 
with age.
CONCLUSIONS: Existing disparities in health across geographies and racial and 
ethnic subgroups may lead to distributional differences in the impact of health 
interventions. Data from this study support routine estimation of equity effects 
in healthcare decision making, including distributional cost-effectiveness 
analysis.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard technique to 
assess biventricular volumes and function, and is increasingly being considered 
as an end-point in clinical studies. Currently, with the exception of right 
ventricular (RV) stroke volume and RV end-diastolic volume, there is only 
limited data on minimally important differences (MIDs) reported for CMR metrics. 
Our study aimed to identify MIDs for CMR metrics based on US Food and Drug 
Administration recommendations for a clinical outcome measure that should 
reflect how a patient "feels, functions or survives".
METHODS: Consecutive treatment-naïve patients with pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH) between 2010 and 2022 who had two CMR scans (at baseline 
prior to treatment and 12 months following treatment) were identified from the 
ASPIRE registry. All patients were followed up for 1 additional year after the 
second scan. For both scans, cardiac measurements were obtained from a validated 
fully automated segmentation tool. The MID in CMR metrics was determined using 
two distribution-based (0.5sd and minimal detectable change) and two 
anchor-based (change difference and generalised linear model regression) methods 
benchmarked to how a patient "feels" (emPHasis-10 quality of life 
questionnaire), "functions" (incremental shuttle walk test) or "survives" for 
1-year mortality to changes in CMR measurements.
RESULTS: 254 patients with PAH were included (mean±sd age 53±16 years, 79% 
female and 66% categorised as intermediate risk based on the 2022 European 
Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society risk score). We identified a 
5% absolute increase in RV ejection fraction and a 17 mL decrease in RV 
end-diastolic or end-systolic volumes as the MIDs for improvement. Conversely, a 
5% decrease in RV ejection fraction and a 10 mL increase in RV volumes were 
associated with worsening.
CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes clinically relevant CMR MIDs for how a 
patient "feels, functions or survives" in response to PAH treatment. These 
findings provide further support for the use of CMR as a clinically relevant 
clinical outcome measure and will aid trial size calculations for studies using 
CMR.

Plain Language Summary: Plain language summaryPulmonary arterial hypertension 
(PAH) is a disease of the vessels of the lung that causes their narrowing and 
stiffening. As a result, the heart pumping blood into these diseased lung 
vessels has to work harder and eventually gets worn out. PAH can affect 
patients' ability to function in daily activities and impact their quality of 
life. It also reduces their life expectancy dramatically. Patients are, 
therefore, often monitored and undergo several investigations to adapt treatment 
according to their situation. These investigations include a survey of how a 
patient feels (the emPHasis-10 questionnaire), functions (walking test) and how 
well the heart is coping with the disease (MRI of the heart). Until now, it is 
unclear how changes on MRI of the heart reflect changes in how a patient feels 
and functions. Our study identified patients that had the emPHasis-10 
questionnaire, walking test and MRI of the heart at both the time of PAH 
diagnosis and one year later. This allowed us to compare how the changes in the 
different tests relate to each other. And because previous research identified 
thresholds for important changes in the emPHasis-10 questionnaire and the 
walking tests, we were able to use these tests as a benchmark for changes in the 
MRI of the heart. Our study identified thresholds for change on heart MRI that 
might indicate whether a patient has improved or worsened. This finding might 
have implications for how patients are monitored in clinical practice and future 
research on PAH treatments.

Parkinson's is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, with the number 
of individuals susceptible due to increase as a result of increasing life 
expectancy and a growing worldwide population. However, despite the number of 
individuals affected, all current treatments for PD are symptomatic-they 
alleviate symptoms, but do not slow disease progression. A major reason for the 
lack of disease-modifying treatments is that there are currently no methods to 
diagnose individuals during the earliest stages of the disease, nor are there 
any methods to monitor disease progression at a biochemical level. Herein, we 
have designed and evaluated a peptide-based probe to monitor αS aggregation, 
with a particular focus on the earliest stages of the aggregation process and 
the formation of oligomers. We have identified the peptide-probe K1 as being 
suitable for further development to be applied to number of applications 
including: inhibition of αS aggregation; as a probe to monitor αS aggregation, 
particularly at the earliest stages before Thioflavin-T is active; and a method 
to detect early-oligomers. With further development and in vivo validation, we 
anticipate this probe could be used for the early diagnosis of PD, a method to 
evaluate the effectiveness of potential therapeutics, and as a tool to help in 
the understanding of the onset and development of PD.

BACKGROUND: The ideal conduit for mitral valve replacement (MVR) remains 
elusive, particularly among younger patients due to increased life expectancy. 
We perform a pairwise meta-analysis comparing the use of bioprosthetic valves 
(BPV) and mechanical mitral valves (MMV) in patients < 70 years old undergoing 
MVR.
METHODS: We comprehensively searched medical databases to identify studies 
comparing the use of BPV and MMV in patients < 70 years old undergoing MVR. 
Pairwise meta-analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel method in R 
version 4.0.2. Outcomes were pooled using the random effect model as risk ratios 
(RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
RESULTS: 16,879 patients from 15 studies were pooled. Compared to MMV, BPV was 
associated with significantly higher rates of 30-day mortality (RR 1.53, 
p = 0.0006) but no difference in 30-day stroke (RR 0.70, p = 0.43). At a 
weighted mean follow-up duration of 14.1 years, BPV was associated with higher 
rates of long-term mortality (RR 1.28, p = 0.0054). No difference was seen 
between the two groups for risk of long-term stroke (RR 0.92, p = 0.67), 
reoperation(RR 1.72, p = 0.12), or major-bleeding (RR 0.57, p = 0.10) at a 
weighted mean follow-up duration of 11.7, 11.3, and 11.9 years, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The use of MMV in patients < 70 undergoing MVR is associated with 
lower rates of 30-day/long-term mortality compared to BPV. No significant 
differences were observed for risk of 30-day/long-term stroke, long-term 
reoperation, and long-term major bleeding. These findings support the use of MMV 
in younger patients, although prospective, randomized trials are still needed.

using CRISPR RNA (crRNA) complementarity. Recognition of double-stranded DNA 
targets proceeds via DNA unwinding and base pairing between crRNA and the DNA 
target strand, forming an R-loop structure. Full R-loop extension is a 
prerequisite for subsequent DNA cleavage. However, the recognition of unintended 
sequences with multiple mismatches has limited therapeutic applications and is 
still poorly understood on a mechanistic level. Here we set up ultrafast DNA 
unwinding experiments on the basis of plasmonic DNA origami nanorotors to study 
R-loop formation by the Cascade effector complex in real time, close to 
base-pair resolution. We resolve a weak global downhill bias of the forming 
R-loop, followed by a steep uphill bias for the final base pairs. We also show 
that the energy landscape is modulated by base flips and mismatches. These 
findings suggest that Cascade-mediated R-loop formation occurs on short 
timescales in submillisecond single base-pair steps, but on longer timescales in 
six base-pair intermediate steps, in agreement with the structural periodicity 
of the crRNA-DNA hybrid.

Sitotroga cerealella is one of the major pests of cereals in the field and 
storage conditions throughout the world. The main objective was to study the 
life tables of S. cerealella on wheat, maize and barley and its implications on 
percent parasitism of Trichogramma chilonis. S. cerealella is reared under lab 
conditions as its eggs are utilized for rearing T. chilonis. Fresh eggs of S. 
cerealella were collected and after hatching the neonate larvae of S. cerealella 
were transferred onto each host plant species for obtaining first (F1) 
generation (G). Seventy eggs were used for each host and each egg was used as a 
replicate. Daily observations were made for recording the life-table parameters 
of the S. cerealella. The data showed that the developmental time of S. 
cerealella eggs and pupae was maximum (5.68 and 7.75 days) when reared on wheat, 
while the maximum larval duration (19.77 days) of S. cerealella was recorded on 
barley. The maximum fecundity (290.30 ± 22.47 eggs/female) was recorded on 
maize, while minimum fecundity per female was recorded on barley (159.30 eggs/ 
female). The S. cerealella reared on maize had significantly higher values of 
finite rate of increase (λ), intrinsic rate of increase (r), and net 
reproductive rate (Ro) (0.14 ± 0.04 day- 1, 1.16 ± 0.05 day- 1, and 
136.85 ± 20.25 eggs/ female) respectively. The mean generation time (T) 
(35.18 ± 0.61 days) was higher on wheat. Likewise, the gross reproductive rate 
(GRR) and the age-stage specific reproductive values (vxj) of newly oviposited 
eggs of S. cerealella were recorded higher (136.85 ± 20.25; 1.160 offspring) on 
maize. The data regarding the efficacy of T. chilonis for different parameters 
were recorded higher on maize i.e., percent parasitism (89.00 ± 2.30%), percent 
adult emergence (81.60 ± 1.20%), adult longevity (3.80 ± 0.10 days) and total 
adult longevity (9.90 ± 0.20 days) as compared to wheat and barley. Our findings 
revealed that S. cerealella can be best reared on maize under laboratory 
conditions as it prefers this host as compared to wheat and barley. Therefore, 
assigning the most susceptible and favorite host (maize) would help us to 
improve T. chilonis mass production under laboratory conditions.
