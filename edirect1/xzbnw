focuses strongly on targets for good metabolic control to reduce the risk of 
long-term complications. A parallel goal is to minimise short-term complications 
of hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Technology offers opportunity for 
improvement in care, but has not yet fully lived up to its potential. New 
insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes and the development of new therapies 
have led to clinical trials aimed at the prevention of diabetes.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common genetic cause of premature 
coronary heart disease (CHD). Globally, one baby is born with FH every minute. 
If diagnosed and treated early in childhood, individuals with FH can have normal 
life expectancy. This consensus paper aims to improve awareness of the need for 
early detection and management of FH children. Familial hypercholesterolaemia is 
diagnosed either on phenotypic criteria, i.e. an elevated low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level plus a family history of elevated LDL-C, 
premature coronary artery disease and/or genetic diagnosis, or positive genetic 
testing. Childhood is the optimal period for discrimination between FH and 
non-FH using LDL-C screening. An LDL-C ≥5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), or an LDL-C ≥4 
mmol/L (160 mg/dL) with family history of premature CHD and/or high baseline 
cholesterol in one parent, make the phenotypic diagnosis. If a parent has a 
genetic defect, the LDL-C cut-off for the child is ≥3.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). We 
recommend cascade screening of families using a combined phenotypic and 
genotypic strategy. In children, testing is recommended from age 5 years, or 
earlier if homozygous FH is suspected. A healthy lifestyle and statin treatment 
(from age 8 to 10 years) are the cornerstones of management of heterozygous FH. 
Target LDL-C is <3.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) if >10 years, or ideally 50% reduction 
from baseline if 8-10 years, especially with very high LDL-C, elevated 
lipoprotein(a), a family history of premature CHD or other cardiovascular risk 
factors, balanced against the long-term risk of treatment side effects. 
Identifying FH early and optimally lowering LDL-C over the lifespan reduces 
cumulative LDL-C burden and offers health and socioeconomic benefits. To drive 
policy change for timely detection and management, we call for further studies 
in the young. Increased awareness, early identification, and optimal treatment 
from childhood are critical to adding decades of healthy life for children and 
adolescents with FH.

Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines for Interventional Pain Management 
in Cancer Pain.

Intractable cancer pain not amenable to standard oral or parenteral analgesics 
is a horrifying truth in 10-15% of patients. Interventional pain management 
techniques are an indispensable arsenal in pain physician's armamentarium for 
severe, intractable pain and can be broadly classified into neuroablative and 
neuromodulation techniques. An array of neurolytic techniques (chemical, 
thermal, or surgical) can be employed for ablation of individual nerve fibers, 
plexuses, or intrathecalneurolysis in patients with resistant pain and short 
life-expectancy. Neuraxial administration of drugs and spinal cord stimulation 
to modulate or alter the pain perception constitutes the most frequently 
employed neuromodulation techniques. Lately, there is a rising call for early 
introduction of interventional techniques in carefully selected patients 
simultaneously or even before starting strong opioids. After decades of 
empirical use, it is the need of the hour to head towards professionalism and 
standardization in order to secure credibility of specialization and those 
practicing it. Even though the interventional management has found a definite 
place in cancer pain, there is a dearth of evidence-based practice guidelines 
for interventional therapies in cancer pain. This may be because of paucity of 
good quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating their safety and 
efficacy in cancer pain. Laying standardized guidelines based on existing and 
emerging evidence will act as a foundation step towards strengthening, 
credentialing, and dissemination of the specialty of interventional cancer pain 
management. This will also ensure an improved decision-making and quality of 
life (QoL) of the suffering patients.

What are the Costs and Benefits of Providing Comprehensive Seven-day Services 
for Emergency Hospital Admissions?

The English National Health Service is moving towards providing comprehensive 
7-day hospital services in response to higher death rates for emergency weekend 
admissions. Using Hospital Episode Statistics between 1st April 2010 and 31st 
March 2011 linked to all-cause mortality within 30 days of admission, we 
estimate the number of excess deaths and the loss in quality-adjusted life years 
associated with emergency weekend admissions. The crude 30-day mortality rate 
was 3.70% for weekday admissions and 4.05% for weekend admissions. The excess 
weekend death rate equates to 4355 (risk adjusted 5353) additional deaths each 
year. The health gain of avoiding these deaths would be 29 727-36 539 
quality-adjusted life years per year. The estimated cost of implementing 7-day 
services is £1.07-£1.43 bn, which exceeds by £339-£831 m the maximum spend based 
on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold of £595 
m-£731 m. There is as yet no clear evidence that 7-day services will reduce 
weekend deaths or can be achieved without increasing weekday deaths. The planned 
cost of implementing 7-day services greatly exceeds the maximum amount that the 
National Health Service should spend on eradicating the weekend effect based on 
current evidence. Policy makers and service providers should focus on 
identifying specific service extensions for which cost-effectiveness can be 
demonstrated.

Poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) brushes with different grafting density and 
chain length were grown from an ester group-containing initiator using 
surface-initiated polymerization. Hydrolysis of the PDMA chains from the surface 
was monitored by measuring thickness of the polymer layer by ellipsometry and 
extension length by atomic force microscopy. It was found that the initial rate 
of cleavage of one end-tethered PDMA chains was dependent on the grafting 
density and chain length; the hydrolysis rate was faster for high grafting 
density brushes and brushes with higher molecular weights. Additionally, the 
rate of cleavage of polymer chains during a given experiment changed by up to 1 
order of magnitude as the reaction progressed, with a distinct transition to a 
lower rate as the grafting density decreased. Also, polymer chains undergo 
selective cleavage, with longer chains in a polydisperse brush being 
preferentially cleaved at one stage of the hydrolysis reaction. We suggest that 
the enhanced initial hydrolysis rates seen at high grafting densities and high 
chain lengths are due to mechanical activation of the ester bond connecting the 
polymer chains to the surface in association with high lateral pressure within 
the brush. These results have implications for the preparation of polymers 
brushes, their stability under harsh conditions, and the analysis of polymer 
brushes from partial hydrolysates.

Cost-effectiveness is an essential part of treatment evaluation, in addition to 
effectiveness. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, a measure called the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is widely utilized, and the mean 
cost and the mean (quality-adjusted) life years have served as norms to 
summarize cost and effectiveness for a study population. Recently, the 
median-based ICER was proposed for complementary or sensitivity analysis 
purposes. In this article, we extend this method when some data are censored.

Illness Perceptions of Cystic Fibrosis: A Comparison of Young Adults with CF and 
Same-Aged Peers.

In the last two decades, the life expectancy for individuals with Cystic 
Fibrosis (CF) has increased significantly. The limited research examining the 
psychosocial experiences of young adults with CF indicates that other young 
adults lack awareness and understanding of CF. Using the Illness Perception 
Questionnaire, perceptions of CF were examined in individuals with CF aged 16 to 
25 and two groups of same-aged peers: those who did, or did not, know someone 
with CF. ANOVA with pairwise comparisons revealed that individuals with CF 
perceived significantly fewer physical symptoms of illness and fewer emotional 
and practical consequences of CF than both groups of peers. Individuals with CF 
also perceived significantly more personal control and greater understanding of 
CF than peers without experience of CF. Implications for enhancing opportunities 
for social engagement and for the provision of social support for young people 
with CF are identified.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: To examine the causes of officially reported deaths from 
several categories among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in a statistical 
division of north-west Australia from 2002 to 2011.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of official Death Registration data to 
calculate mortality rate ratios (Aboriginal against non-Aboriginal) for that 
decade in six major International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 categories. 
The study setting was the West Kimberley Health District in the far north of 
Western Australia.
RESULTS: Death rates of Aborigines relative to non-Aborigines were much higher, 
by more than 10 times in some categories. Most of the excess deaths in these 
categories were due to circulatory diseases, injury and poisonings, neoplasms, 
diabetes, respiratory, and genitourinary conditions.
CONCLUSION: This study has documented the heavy burden of mortality in West 
Kimberley Aborigines compared with the pattern found in non-Aboriginal people 
living in the same region.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the expected life years gained from intensive care 
unit (ICU) admission could inform priority-setting decisions across groups of 
ICU patients and across medical specialties. The aim of this study was to 
estimate expected remaining lifetime for patients admitted to ICUs during 
2008-2010 and to estimate the gain in life years from ICU admission.
METHODS: This is a descriptive, population modelling study of 30,712 adult mixed 
ICU admissions from the Norwegian Intensive Care Registry. The expected 
remaining lifetime for each patient was estimated using a decision-analytical 
model. Transition probabilities were based on registered Simplified Acute 
Physiology Score (SAPS) II, and standard and adjusted Norwegian life-tables.
RESULTS: The hospital mortality was 19.4% (n = 5,958 deaths). 24% of the 
patients were estimated to die within the first year after ICU admission in our 
model. Under an intermediate (base case), optimistic (O), and pessimistic (P) 
scenario with respect to long-term mortality, the average expected remaining 
lifetime was 19.4, 19.9, and 12.7 years. The majority of patients had a life 
expectancy of more than five years (84.8% in the base case, 89.4% in scenario O, 
and 55.6% in scenario P), and few had a life expectancy of less than one year 
(0.7%, 0.1%, and 12.7%). The incremental gain from ICU admission compared to 
counterfactual general ward care was estimated to be 0.04 (scenario P, age 85+) 
to 1.14 (scenario O, age < 45) extra life years per patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research demonstrated a novel way of using routinely collected 
registry data to estimate and evaluate the expected lifetime outcomes for ICU 
patients upon admission. The majority had high life expectancies. The youngest 
age groups seemed to benefit the most from ICU admission. The study raises the 
question whether availability and rationing of ICU services are too strict in 
Norway.

Massive intraoperative bleeding after laparoscopic assisted abdominoperineal 
resection: a case report and systematic review of the literature.

Beuran M, Stoica B, Tănase I, Negoi I, Păun S; -.

INTRODUCTION: The laparoscopic-assisted abdominoperineal resection (LAPR) has 
been proved to be associated with a shorter postoperative recovery, with 
equivalent oncological results and similar survival when compared with 
conventional open surgery, for patients with low rectal cancer.
METHOD: Case report of a massive intraoperative bleeding during LAPR and 
systematic review of the English language literature, using PubMed Medline, ISI 
Thopmson, OVID and EMBASE databases.
RESULTS: 58 years old patient admitted in emergency setting or rectal bleeding. 
Rectal examination revealed a protruding,frail tumor, located 2 cm from the anal 
verge. Total colono scopy revealed an infiltrative, protruding tumor, situated 
at 2 cm from the anal verge, with a 5 cm cranial extension,without any 
additional colonic lesions. Computed Tomography showed a 4,5 cm circumferential 
rectal wall thickening, without any enlarged mesorectal or abdominal lymph 
nodes. The patient was transported to operating room for a LAPR. During final 
hemostasis, at the level of perineal surgical wound, an acute massive bleeding 
occurred from the presacral vessels with severe blood loss. This bleeding 
couldnot be managed laparo scopicaly and conversion to laparotomywas decided, 
with pelvic packing. At 48 hours after the initial surgical approach, the 
tamponing packs were removed, without signs of active bleeding. There were 
applied haemostatic agents and the perineal wound was sutured, without further 
rbleeding during in-hospital stay.
CONCLUSIONS: A rapid and effective control of the presacral bleeding is 
mandatory to prevent a fatal outcome. Pelvic packing remains a life-saving 
procedure and the treatment of choice in severe cases.

Fabry disease (Anderson-Fabry disease) is one of the most common lysosomal 
storage diseases (after Gaucher disease) caused by deficient activity of the 
α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) enzyme, which leads to progressive accumulation of 
globotriaosylceramide in various cells, predominantly in endothelium and 
vascular smooth muscles, with multisystem clinical manifestations. Estimates of 
the incidence range from one per 40,000 to 60,000 in males, and 1:117,000 in the 
general population. Pain is usually the first symptom and is present in 60%-80% 
of affected children, as well as gastrointestinal disturbances, ophthalmologic 
abnormalities and hearing loss. Renal failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or 
stroke as the presenting symptom may also be found even as isolated symptoms of 
the disease. Life expectancy is reduced by approximately 20 years in males and 
10-15 years in females, therefore enzyme replacement therapy should be 
introduced in patients of any age and either sex, who meet treatment criteria 
for Anderson-Fabry disease.

BACKGROUND: Because nonagenarians with aortic stenosis (AS) often present as 
frail with more comorbid conditions, long-term outcomes and quality of life are 
important treatment considerations. The aim of this report is to describe 
survival and functional outcomes of nonagenarians undergoing treatment for AS by 
surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of all patients aged 90 years or more 
undergoing treatment for AS between 2007 and 2013 at two centers. Outcomes were 
compared between SAVR and TAVR. Long-term survival was compared with an age- and 
sex-matched population from the Social Security Actuarial Life Table.
RESULTS: In all, 110 patients underwent treatment for isolated AS (20 SAVR and 
90 TAVR). Mean age was 91.85 ± 1.80 years, and 50.9% were female. The Society of 
Thoracic Surgeons mean predicted risk of mortality was 11.11% ± 5.74%. Operative 
mortality was 10.9% (10.0% SAVR; 11.1% TAVR); 2.7% of patients had a stroke. The 
TAVR patients were more likely to be discharged home (75.9% versus 55.6% for 
SAVR, p = 0.032). Mean follow-up was 1.8 ± 1.5 years, with a 1-year and 5-year 
survival of 78.7% and 45.3%, respectively, which approximated the US actuarial 
survival. There was a significant improvement in quality of life as measured by 
the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire at 1 year compared with baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of AS approximates natural life expectancy in select 
nonagenarians, with no significant difference in long-term survival between SAVR 
and TAVR. Importantly, patient quality of life improved at 1 year. With 
appropriate selection, nonagenarians with severe AS can benefit from treatment.

PURPOSE: The Avastin in Glioblastoma trial has shown that patients newly 
diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treated with bevacizumab plus 
radiotherapy and temozolomide versus radiotherapy and temozolomide alone showed 
improvement in progression-free survival, possibly leading to a new indication 
for first-line use of bevacizumab in GBM. The cost-utility of this new 
intervention remains unknown; therefore, we developed a Markov model estimating 
the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) from a Canadian public payer 
perspective.
METHODS: We incorporated trial data for state transitions and treatment effects 
from the Avastin in Glioblastoma trial, costs and resource use data from 
Canadian published studies and databases, and utility parameters from published 
literature. We addressed uncertainty through one-way deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses, extended the model to lifetime horizon and 
by another arm to compare first-line versus second-line use of bevacizumab on 
progression, performed value of information analysis, and performed US costing 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Adding bevacizumab to radiotherapy and temozolomide resulted in 
increases of 0.13 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and $80,000 per patient 
over 2-year time horizon at the base case analysis. The ICUR was $607,966/QALY 
(95% CI, $305,000/QALY to $2,550,000/QALY), with 0% chance of being cost 
effective at the $100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold and never going 
below $450,000/QALY in the one-way sensitivity analysis. The ICUR using the US 
costing data was $787,519/QALY. The lifetime ICUR was $439,764/QALY (95% CI, 
$235,000/QALY to $1,520,000/QALY), never going below $350,000/QALY in the 
sensitivity analysis. Second-line use of bevacizumab on progression is more 
effective and less expensive than its first-line use. Value of information 
analysis revealed that future research is unwarranted.
CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab has only limited effectiveness and is therefore not 
likely to be cost effective in treating adult patients with newly diagnosed GBM.

THE IMPACT OF LATE-LIFE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION ON COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY AND 
COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURING SKILL ACQUISITION.

BACKGROUND: Studies examining treatment moderators and mediators in late-life 
anxiety and depression are sparse. Executive functioning skills decrease with 
age, and are poorer in the context of anxiety and depression. One of the key 
cognitive behavioral therapy techniques for anxiety and depression is cognitive 
restructuring (CR), which teaches people to identify and dispute maladaptive 
thoughts. There is evidence that cognitive flexibility (CF), one aspect of 
executive functioning, has a negative impact on CR skill acquisition in 
nonclinical older adults, and this warrants extension in a clinical sample.
METHOD: This study assessed CR skill acquisition in a clinical sample of 47 
older adults with anxiety and depression and 53 nonclinical controls during an 
experimental paradigm, and investigated the influence of CF on this 
relationship. A battery of neuropsychological tests assessing CF were 
administered and CR was learned during a brief intervention.
RESULTS: The clinical sample showed poorer CF on some measures, as well as 
poorer CR quality and efficacy (reduction in subjective distress). CF partially 
mediated the relationship between clinical status and CR quality, and between 
clinical status and CR efficacy.
CONCLUSION: These results provide preliminary evidence that older adults with 
anxiety and depression are worse at learning and benefiting from CR with a brief 
intervention and this is partially due to having poorer CF skills. These 
findings warrant further examination in a treatment context to assess whether CR 
skill acquisition improves over treatment.

The epidemiological transition in Latin America toward older urban dwelling 
adults has led to the rise in cardiovascular risk factors and an increase in 
morbidity and mortality rates related to both stroke and myocardial infarction. 
As a result, there is an immediate need for effective actions resulting in 
better detection and control of cardiovascular risk factors that will ultimately 
reduce cardiovascular disease burden. Data from case-control studies have 
identified the following risk factors associated with stroke: hypertension; 
smoking; abdominal obesity; diet; physical activity; diabetes; alcohol intake; 
psychosocial factors; cardiac causes; and dyslipidemia. In addition to its high 
mortality, patients who survive after a stroke present quite frequently with 
marked physical and functional disability. Because stroke is the leading cause 
of death in most Latin American countries and also because it is a clearly 
preventable cause of death and disability, simple, affordable, and efficient 
strategies must be urgently implemented in Latin America.

OBJECTIVE: Aging is associated with a progressive decline in muscle strength, 
muscle mass and impaired physical function, which reduces mobility and impairs 
quality of life in the elderly population. The 6-12 months of exercise can 
enhance the muscle strength, but these improvements can only be maintained for a 
short period. In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term Tai Chi 
(TC) exercise on muscle strength of lower extremities.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 205 long-term TC practitioners 
(age: 60-89 years) and 205 age and gentle matched controls who did not practice 
TC. Each of the activity group was further divided into three distinct age 
groups: G1, 60-69 years; G2, 70-79 years; and G3, 80-89 years. Hand-held 
dynamometery was used to measure the maximum isometric strength of iliopsoas, 
quadriceps femoris, tibialis anterior and hamstrings in both sides of the 
participants. Unpaired t tests were performed to compare the difference of 
strength between the TC and non-Tai Chi (NTC) groups. Multivariate analysis of 
variance (MANOVA) was used to compare the lower muscle strengths among the 
different age groups in the TC and NTC groups. Pearson's correlations were used 
to quantify the linear relationship between the months of TC practice and lower 
limbs muscle strength.
RESULTS: The inter-rater reliabilities of iliopsoas, quadriceps femoris, 
tibialis anterior and hamstrings were intraclass correlation coeffificient (ICC) 
(1,1) = 0.895 (0.862-0.920), ICC (2,2) = 0.905 (0.874-0.928), ICC (3,3) = 0.922 
(0.898-0.941) and ICC (4,4) = 0.930 (0.908-0.947). The strength of the muscles 
in the TC group did not differ among different age groups (P>0.05). The strength 
of iliopsoas, quadriceps femoris, tibialis anterior and hamstrings in TC group 
was higher than that in the NTC group (P<0.05). A correlation between muscle 
strength and extension of the exercise period was positive (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Results shed light on the orientation and magnitude of long-term TC 
in preventing muscle strength loss with aging. TC might be a good form to slow 
down the trend of age-related decline in muscle strength in community-dwelling 
population.

[Hip fracture as risk factor for mortality in patients over 65 years of age. 
Case-control study].

[Article in Spanish]

Negrete-Corona J, Alvarado-Soriano JC, Reyes-Santiago LA.

INTRODUCTION: Hip fracture among older patients is a devastating injury in most 
cases. It profoundly affects the physical, mental, functional and social balance 
that patients used to have and, beyond the orthopedic injury, it reflects the 
aging process and its dire consequences. Some reports show that up to 50% of 
patients with hip fracture die within six months and many of those who survive 
do not recover their baseline independence and function. In recent decades the 
increase in life expectancy after 60 years of age has led to an exponential 
growth in hip fractures. This is why it is essential to determine the 
patient-related and environmental factors leading to the increased mortality 
rates seen in patients with hip fracture, to improve the survival and quality of 
life of older adults. The objective was to determine the association between hip 
fracture and mortality in patients over 65 years of age.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational, longitudinal, retrospective, 
descriptive, comparative case-control study was conducted. The clinical records 
of all patients over 65 years of age admitted to the Orthopedics Service, 
Hospital Regional <<Lic. Adolfo López Mateos>>, ISSSTE, with a diagnosis of hip 
fracture during the previous 12 months were analyzed, regardless of the type of 
fracture and treatment they received. A group of patients without hip fracture 
was used as control group. Total sample size was 50 patients with hip fracture 
and 50 patients without hip fracture. The following data were collected in data 
collection forms: age, sex, time elapsed since the fracture, survival at one 
year and, in the case of deceased patients, the cause of death (pneumonia, 
sepsis, arrhythmia, hydroelectrolytic imbalance, heart failure and others). The 
results obtained are shown as tables and charts to facilitate their visual 
understanding.
RESULTS: Patient demographics show that there were 40 (80%) female patients and 
10 (20%) male patients with a diagnosis of hip fracture. The control group 
included 35 (70%) females and 15 (30) males. An association between hip fracture 
and increased mortality was found, with a significant p value of 0.001. The main 
cause of death among hip fracture patients in our study was sepsis in 7 (35%), 
while among the control group it was myocardial infarction in 3 (15%). Time 
wise, mortality was found to be higher within the first six months, with 10 
deaths (50%), and within the first year, with six deaths (30%).
DISCUSSION: Hip fracture is in fact a risk factor associated with mortality 
among patients over 65 years of age. Females are the group most prone to 
sustaining a hip fracture and, therefore, to increased mortality rates. The 
major cause of death among our patient population was sepsis, apparently caused 
by mismanagement of soft tissues, a poor aseptic technique during the surgical 
procedure, a long hospital stay or a poor family support network, and dementia, 
which is related to poor surgical wound care. The highest mortality rates were 
found in ages over 90 years, and they were associated with preexisting 
chronic-degenerative conditions. The age group at highest risk of hip fracture 
was 80-89 years. Patients with hip fracture should always be managed together 
with the internist and the geriatrician and they should be considered as 
orthopedic emergencies, as a long hospital stay and delayed surgical treatment 
are associated with major complications and increased mortality rates.

Manganese and the Evolution of Photosynthesis.

Technology, Pasadena, CA, 91125, USA, wfischer@caltech.edu.

Oxygenic photosynthesis is the most important bioenergetic event in the history 
of our planet-it evolved once within the Cyanobacteria, and remained largely 
unchanged as it was transferred to algae and plants via endosymbiosis. Manganese 
plays a fundamental role in this history because it lends the critical redox 
behavior of the water-oxidizing complex of photosystem II. Constraints from the 
photoassembly of the Mn-bearing water-oxidizing complex fuel the hypothesis that 
Mn(II) once played a key role as an electron donor for anoxygenic photosynthesis 
prior to the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. Here we review the growing 
body of geological and geochemical evidence from the Archean and 
Paleoproterozoic sedimentary records that supports this idea and demonstrates 
that the oxidative branch of the Mn cycle switched on prior to the rise of 
oxygen. This Mn-oxidizing phototrophy hypothesis also receives support from the 
biological record of extant phototrophs, and can be made more explicit by 
leveraging constraints from structural biology and biochemistry of photosystem 
II in Cyanobacteria. These observations highlight that water-splitting in 
photosystem II evolved independently from a homodimeric ancestral type II 
reaction center capable of high potential photosynthesis and Mn(II) oxidation, 
which is required by the presence of homologous redox-active tyrosines in the 
modern heterodimer. The ancestral homodimer reaction center also evolved a 
C-terminal extension that sterically precluded standard phototrophic electron 
donors like cytochrome c, cupredoxins, or high-potential iron-sulfur proteins, 
and could only complete direct oxidation of small molecules like Mn(2+), and 
ultimately water.

OBJECTIVES: There is a paucity of long-term follow-up data for children with 
intracranial ependymoma (IE) and medulloblastoma (MB). What happens to these 
children 20, 30, or 40 years after diagnosis? Do they have potential for a 
normal lifespan? The purpose of this study was to ascertain the long-term 
survival potential in children with MB or IE who have survived 5 years from 
diagnosis.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using the SEER Program. Children 
(ages 0-19 years) from 1973 to 2011 with a diagnosis of MB or IE were 
identified. A cohort was created of potentially cured patients who survived 5 
years from diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier estimates 
were utilized to analyze long-term survival.
RESULTS: We identified 876 patients with MB and 474 patients with IE who were 
alive 5 years from diagnosis. Patients with MB had a 30-year overall survival 
(OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of 70.2% and 80.1%, respectively. 
Patients with IE had a 30-year OS and CSS of 57.3% and 68.8%, respectively. When 
comparing MB with IE, MB had improved CSS (P = 0.04) and trended toward 
increased OS (P = 0.10).
CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of deaths due to disease occur for several 
decades after treatment for both IE and MB. Despite this, the potential for 
long-term survival exists in 5-year survivors of both histologies. If alive at 5 
years from diagnosis, patients with MB tend to have a lower risk of death from 
disease compared to those with IE.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited Dendreon, 
the company manufacturing sipuleucel-T, to submit evidence for the clinical and 
cost effectiveness of sipuleucel-T for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, 
metastatic, non-visceral hormone-relapsed prostate cancer patients in whom 
chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated, as part of NICE's single 
technology appraisal process. The comparator was abiraterone acetate (AA) or 
best supportive care (BSC). The School of Health and Related Research at the 
University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group 
(ERG). This paper describes the company submission (CS), ERG review, and 
subsequent decision of the NICE Appraisal Committee (AC). The ERG produced a 
critical review of the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence of sipuleucel-T 
based upon the CS. Clinical-effectiveness data relevant to the decision problem 
were taken from three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of sipuleucel-T and a 
placebo (PBO) comparator of antigen-presenting cells (APC) being re-infused 
(APC-PBO) (D9901, D9902A and D9902B), and one RCT (COU-AA-302) of AA plus 
prednisone vs. PBO plus prednisone. Two trials reported a significant advantage 
for sipuleucel-T in median overall survival compared with APC-PBO: for trial 
D9901, an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.47; (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.29, 
0.76) p < 0.002; for D9902B, adjusted HR 0.78 (95 % CI 0.61, 0.98) p = 0.03. 
There was no significant difference between groups in D9902A, unadjusted HR 0.79 
(95 % CI 0.48, 1.28) p = 0.331. Sipuleucel-T and APC-PBO groups did not differ 
significantly in time to disease progression, in any of the three RCTs. Most 
adverse events developed within 1 day of the infusion, and resolved within 2 
days. The CS included an indirect comparison of sipuleucel-T (D9902B) and AA 
plus prednisone (COU-AA-302). As trials differed in prior use of chemotherapy, 
an analysis of only chemotherapy-naïve patients was included, in which the 
overall survival for sipuleucel-T and AA was not significantly different, HR 
0.94 (95 % CI 0.69, 1.28) p = 0.699. The ERG had several concerns regarding the 
data and assumptions incorporated within the company's cost-effectiveness 
analyses and conducted exploratory analyses to quantify the impact of making 
alternative assumptions or using alternative data inputs. The deterministic 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for sipuleucel-T vs. BSC when using 
the ERG's preferred data and assumptions was £ 108,585 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) in the whole licensed population and £ 61,204/QALY in the 
subgroup with low prostate-specific antigen at baseline. The ERG also conducted 
an incremental analysis comparing sipuleucel-T with both AA and BSC in the 
chemotherapy-naïve subgroup. Sipuleucel-T had a deterministic ICER of £ 
111,682/QALY in this subgroup, when using the ERG's preferred assumptions, and 
AA was extendedly dominated. The ERG also concluded that estimates of costs and 
benefits for AA should be interpreted with caution given the limitations of the 
indirect comparison. The AC noted that the ICER for sipuleucel-T was well above 
the range usually considered cost effective, and did not recommend sipuleucel-T 
for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, metastatic, 
non-visceral hormone-relapsed prostate cancer.

Research-based evidence and practice-based experience are core requirements for 
the effective implementation of preventive interventions. The knowledge gained 
in the Prevention Research Funding Initiative of the German Federal Ministry of 
Education and Research (2004-2013) was therefore amalgamated, reflected and
