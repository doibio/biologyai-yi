presbystasis, focusing on the role of the vestibular system in the pathogenesis 
and on the possibilities offered by vestibular rehabilitation in the management 
of these subjects. Other clinical conditions related to the disorder are also 
discussed.

Publisher: Il problema sociale della presbistasia e il ruolo della 
riabilitazione vestibolare nell’anziano: una revisione della letteratura.
RIASSUNTO: Il termine presbistasia si riferisce a una condizione di comune 
riscontro negli anziani, caratterizzata da un progressivo e multifattoriale 
disordine dell’equilibrio; la fisiopatogenesi può originare dalla concomitanza 
di diversi fattori, tra i quali patologie del sistema nervoso centrale, da una 
neuropatia periferica, disordini osteoarticolari (che provocano una riduzione 
della velocità di marcia), patologie del sistema cardiovascolare e visivo, ma 
può anche avere come concausa deficit del sistema vestibolare periferico e 
centrale; soprattutto la Vertigine Parossistica Posizionale Benigna (VPPB) è 
comune nei soggetti di età superiore a 70 anni. La presbistasia rappresenta oggi 
una delle principali cause di cadute negli anziani e ha come conseguenza una 
riduzione dell’aspettativa e qualità di vita. Scopo del nostro lavoro è stato 
quello di rivedere la recente letteratura focalizzandoci sul ruolo del sistema 
vestibolare nella patogenesi e sulle possibilità terapeutiche offerte dalla 
riabilitazione vestibolare. Sono state inoltre riassunte nella review le altre 
concause del disturbo.

Plain Language Summary: At present an exclusive endoscopic endonasal approach is 
sufficient in the majority of cases to treat pathologies involving the sinonasal 
compartment and the surrounding anatomical subsites (e.g. orbit, ventral skull 
base, upper parapharyngeal space, etc.) with the advantage of minimising 
surgical invasiveness. In this context, nasal vascularised local flaps are 
widely employed because they represent a more effective option for 
reconstruction or preservation of noble/vital structures compared to grafts. On 
the other hand, the surgical extension and morbidity are minimised compared to 
regional or free flaps. Several nasal local flaps have been described in the 
literature: the aim of this review is to examine their applications, 
characteristics, indications, success rates and morbidities. Different nasal 
flaps based on single or multiple pedicles have been described; the choice 
between them is based on different factors such as the flap’s shape and 
dimension, localisation of the pedicle’s origin, width of rotation angle, 
previous surgeries which could compromise vascularisation, and surgical 
experience, in addition to the position and dimension of the area which must be 
resurfaced.

Publisher: Impiego dei lembi nasali peduncolati nella chirurgia endoscopica 
transnasale: revisione della letteratura su indicazioni e tecniche chirurgiche.
RIASSUNTO: Ad oggi la maggior parte delle patologie che coinvolgano il 
compartimento nasosinusale e i distretti anatomici circostanti (es. orbita, 
basicranio, spazio parafaringeo superiore, ecc.) possono essere trattate 
efficacemente mediante un approccio endoscopico endonasale esclusivo nella 
maggior parte dei casi, minimizzando l’invasività della procedura chirurgica. In 
questo contesto i lembi nasali vascolarizzati sono ampiamente utilizzati, poiché 
costituiscono una metodica di ricostruzione o di protezione delle strutture 
nobili/vitali più efficace rispetto all’utilizzo degli innesti, pur essendo 
associati a una riduzione dell’estensione e della morbidità chirurgica rispetto 
all’uso di lembi regionali o liberi. Differenti tipologie di lembi locali nasali 
sono state descritte in letteratura: scopo della presente review è quello di 
esaminare le applicazioni, caratteristiche, indicazioni, tassi di successo e 
complicanze di ciascuno di essi. Differenti lembi nasali basati su peduncoli 
singoli o multipli sono stati descritti; la scelta tra di essi è basata su 
differenti fattori: forma e dimensione del lembo, sede d’origine del peduncolo, 
ampiezza e angolo di rotazione, eventuali chirurgie precedenti, esperienza 
chirurgica oltre alla posizione e dimensione dell’area da rivestire.

Background: Actions focused on age-friendly environments contribute to promote 
and maintain older people's functional ability and may enable them to contribute 
to their communities and enjoy life. As such, age-friendly practices require 
collaboration between diverse stakeholders across multiple sectors responsible 
for natural, built, and social environments, which can be particularly relevant 
during public health emergencies when socio-ecological vulnerabilities become 
more salient and may disproportionally affect older people. This paper presents 
a protocol for a scoping review aiming to investigate the breadth of evidence 
concerning the development, implementation, and evaluation of age-friendly 
practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. The protocol sets out the objectives, 
methods, and dissemination plans for the review. Methods: The scoping review 
will be conducted in line with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review 
methodology. We will search databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, 
Scopus, PsychNet) and grey literature sources. Publications relating to 
practices across the 8 domains of the World Health Organization's age-friendly 
cities and communities' framework will be included. A tabular data extraction 
tool will be used to facilitate a narrative synthesis of results. Ethics and 
dissemination: Ethical approval is not required as the methods proposed for this 
scoping review consist of collecting publicly available data. Findings will be 
reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) and submitted to a 
journal for academic dissemination. Lay dissemination plans include an 
infographic and a blog-style article presenting our core results. Conclusion: 
The publication of this protocol allows for transparency in the systematic 
process of a scoping review focused on age-friendly practices during COVID-19. 
Findings emerging from the scoping review will provide insights into the 
evidence available regarding age-friendly activities during COVID-19 and may 
inform future age-friendly practices during public health emergencies and 
beyond.

When should electronic medical records reminders for cancer screening 
stop?-Results from a national physician survey.

BACKGROUND: Many older adults are screened for breast and colorectal cancers 
beyond guideline recommended thresholds. Electronic medical record (EMR) 
reminders are commonly used to prompt cancer screening. Behavioral economics 
theory suggests that changing the default settings for these reminders can be 
effective to reduce over-screening. We examined physician perspectives about 
acceptable thresholds for stopping EMR cancer screening reminders.
METHODS: In a national survey of 1200 primary care physicians (PCP) and 600 
gynecologists randomly selected from the AMA Masterfile, we asked physicians to 
choose whether EMR reminders for cancer screening should stop based on a list of 
criteria that included age, life expectancy, specific serious illnesses, and 
functional limitations. Physicians could choose multiple responses. PCPs were 
randomized to questions about breast or colorectal cancer screening.
RESULTS: A total of 592 physicians participated (adjusted response rate 54.1%). 
54.6% chose age and 71.8% chose life expectancy as criteria for stopping EMR 
reminders; only 30.6% chose functional limitations. Regarding age thresholds, 
52.4% chose ages ≤75, 42.0% chose a threshold between 75 and 85, 5.6% would not 
stop reminders even at age 85. Regarding life expectancy thresholds, 32.0% chose 
≥10 years, 53.1% chose a threshold between 5 and 9 years, 14.9% would not stop 
reminders even when life expectancy is <5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that many physicians would continue EMR reminders for 
cancer screening even in light of older age, limited life expectancy, and 
functional limitations. This may reflect reluctance to stop cancer screening 
and/or reluctance to stop EMR reminders so that physicians can retain control to 
decide for individual patients, for example, to assess patient preference and 
ability to tolerate treatment. There was consensus for stopping EMR reminders at 
ages 85+ and <5-year life expectancy. Interventions that seek to reduce 
over-screening by suppressing EMR reminders may be important for these groups 
but may have limited physician buy-in outside these thresholds.

BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella and herpes zoster 
(VHZ), which is endemic worldwide. Although infection with VZV represents a 
considerable health threat, the global, regional and national burden of VZV 
infection, especially the probable relationship between VZV vaccines and the 
epidemiology of VZV infection, is poorly known. We sought to estimate the global 
spatial patterns and temporal trends of VHZ burden in 204 countries and 
territories from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Numbers and age-standardized rates (ASR) of VHZ incidence, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were estimated using data from the Global 
Burden of Diseases Study (GBD) 2019. Spatiotemporal trends in ASR were evaluated 
by estimated annual percentage change (EAPC).
RESULTS: Worldwide, in 2019, there were approximately 84.0 million incidence and 
0.9 million DALYs due to VHZ. The corresponding ASIR (age-standardized incidence 
rate) and ASDR (age-standardized DALY rate) drastically decreased in children 
(aged <20 years old), while the ASIR and ASDR of VHZ significantly increased in 
middle- and old-aged adults (aged >50 years old), with highest ASIR and ASDR in 
the High-income Asia Pacific and Western Sub-Saharan Africa, respectively. From 
1990-2019, the corresponding EAPC in ASIR were 0.03 (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI]: 0.02-0.04). Whereas the global EAPC in ASDR decreased in all regions 
(-1.59, 95% UI: -1.64 to -1.55), expect for Australasia (0.46, [0.05, 0.88]). 
Notably, in 2019, age-specific rates of VHZ DALYs presented a rapid growth trend 
after 70 years old.
CONCLUSION: The spatiotemporal trends of VHZ were heterogeneous across countries 
from 1990 to 2019. The spatiotemporal trend in ASIR is highest in the High 
sociodemographic index (SDI) region, however the EAPC in ASDR is lowest, in part 
probably due to VHZ vaccination. Therefore, reducing morbidity and burden 
strategies such as vaccines programs for the prevention of VHZ should be 
promoted in those regions with high growth incidence and/or burden, especially 
for the population after 70 years old.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered one of the eco-related key factors that 
negatively affect global climatic change. Also, CO2 can play an important role 
in the postharvest quality of the agri-products. In this study, the impact of 
CO2 on the quality of postharvest onions that were stored at 23 °C for 8 weeks 
was investigated. The weight loss, phenolic, flavonoid, flavanol, anthocyanin, 
antioxidant activity, and soluble sugar were analyzed during the study period. 
The results showed that 20% CO2 treatment was significantly (P > 0.05) more 
effective than 15% CO2 and control in inhibiting weight loss. Additionally, 20% 
CO2 treatment significantly retained higher antioxidant enzyme activities such 
as CAT, APX, and SOD than 15% CO2 and control. During storage, 20% CO2 treatment 
significantly (P < 0.05) improved glucose, fructose, and sucrose levels by more 
than 15% CO2 exposure and control groups. Besides the chlorogenic acid, 
kaempferol and quercetin were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the 20% CO2 
than in the 15% CO2 after 2 weeks of storage. In conclusion, this study's 
novelty comes from the broad prospects of using CO2 for maximizing the stored 
onion phytochemical functionality that is usually affected by the room 
temperature long storage. This will help in the onion shelf-life extension by 
considering the quality-related attributes.

In this study, pectin (PC)/chitosan nanofiber (ChNF) films containing a novel 
anthocyanin from sumac extract were successfully developed for freshness 
monitoring and shelf-life extension of shrimp. The physical, barrier, 
morphological, color, and antibacterial properties of biodegradable films were 
evaluated. The addition of sumac anthocyanins to the films caused intramolecular 
interactions (such as hydrogen bonds) in the film structure, as confirmed by 
using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) 
analysis, suggesting good compatibility of film ingredients. Also, intelligent 
films showed significant sensitivity to ammonia vapors and changed color from 
reddish to olive color at the first 5 min. Moreover, the results showed that 
PC/ChNF and PC/ChNF/sumac films have significant antibacterial activity against 
Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. In addition to the good 
functional characteristics of the smart film, the resulting films showed 
acceptable physicomechanical properties. So, PC/ChNF/sumac smart film exhibited 
the strength = 60 MPa with the flexibility = 23.3 %. Likewise, water vapor 
barrier reduced from 2.5 (×10-11 g. m/m2. s. Pa) to 2.3 (×10-11 g. m/m2. s. Pa) 
after adding anthocyanin. The results of the application of intelligent film 
containing anthocyanins of sumac extract for shrimp freshness monitoring showed 
that the color of the intelligent film changed from reddish to greenish color 
after 48 h of storage, which shows the high potential of the produced film for 
monitoring the spoilage of seafood products.

Maintaining mitochondrial function is critical to an improved healthspan and 
lifespan. Introducing mild stress by inhibiting mitochondrial translation 
invokes the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and increases 
lifespan in several animal models. Notably, lower mitochondrial ribosomal 
protein (MRP) expression also correlates with increased lifespan in a reference 
population of mice. In this study, we tested whether partially reducing the 
gene expression of a critical MRP, Mrpl54, reduced mitochondrial DNA-encoded 
protein content, induced the UPRmt, and affected lifespan or metabolic health 
using germline heterozygous Mrpl54 mice. Despite reduced Mrpl54 expression in 
multiple organs and a reduction in mitochondrial-encoded protein expression in 
myoblasts, we identified few significant differences between male or female 
Mrpl54+/- and wild type mice in initial body composition, respiratory 
parameters, energy intake and expenditure, or ambulatory motion. We also 
observed no differences in glucose or insulin tolerance, treadmill endurance, 
cold tolerance, heart rate, or blood pressure. There were no differences in 
median life expectancy or maximum lifespan. Overall, we demonstrate that genetic 
manipulation of Mrpl54 expression reduces mitochondrial-encoded protein content 
but is not sufficient to improve healthspan in otherwise healthy and unstressed 
mice.

Studies of life expectancy (LE) in small areas of cities are relatively common 
in high-income countries but rare in Latin American countries. Small-area 
estimation methods can help to describe and quantify inequities in LE between 
neighborhoods and their predictors. Our objective was to analyze the 
distribution and spatial patterning of LE across small areas of Ciudad Autónoma 
de Buenos Aires (CABA), Argentina, and its association with socioeconomic 
characteristics. As part of the SALURBAL project, we used georeferenced death 
certificates in 2015-2017 for CABA, Argentina. We used a spatial Bayesian 
Poisson model using the TOPALS method to estimate age- and sex-specific 
mortality rates. We used life tables to estimate LE at birth. We obtained data 
on neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics from the 2010 census and analyzed 
their associations. LE at birth was higher for women (median of across 
neighborhoods = 81.1 years) compared to men (76.7 years). We found a gap in LE 
of 9.3 (women) and 14.9 years (men) between areas with the highest and the 
lowest LE. Better socioeconomic characteristics were associated with higher LE. 
For example, mean differences in LE at birth in areas with highest versus lowest 
values of composite SES index were 2.79 years (95% CI: 2.30 to 3.28) in women 
and 5.61 years (95% CI: 4.98 to 6.24) in men. We found large spatial inequities 
in LE across neighborhoods of a large city in Latin America, highlighting the 
importance of place-based policies to address this gap.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about patient or provider experience and perceptions 
of stopping surveillance among older adults with a history of colon polyps. 
While guidelines recommend ceasing routine colorectal cancer screening in adults 
 > 75 years and those with limited life expectancy, guidance for ceasing 
surveillance colonoscopy in those with prior colon polyps suggests 
individualizing recommendations.
OBJECTIVE: Identify processes, experiences, and gaps around individualizing 
decisions to stop or continue surveillance colonoscopy for older adults and 
areas for improvement.
DESIGN: Phenomenological qualitative study design using recorded semi-structured 
interviews from May 2020 through March 2021.
PARTICIPANTS: 15 patients aged  ≥ 65 in polyp surveillance, 12 primary care 
providers (PCPs), and 13 gastroenterologists (GIs).
APPROACH: Data were analyzed using a mixed deductive (directed content analysis) 
and inductive (grounded theory) approach to identify themes related to stopping 
or continuing surveillance colonoscopies.
KEY RESULTS: Analysis resulted in 24 themes and were clustered into three main 
categories: health and clinical considerations; communication and roles; and 
system-level processes or structures. Overall, the study found support for 
discussions around age 75-80 on stopping surveillance colonoscopy with 
considerations for health and life expectancy and that PCPs should take a 
primary role. However, systems and processes for scheduling surveillance 
colonoscopies largely bypass PCPs which reduces opportunities to both 
individualize recommendations and facilitate patients' decision-making.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified gaps in processes to implement current 
guidelines for individualizing surveillance colonoscopy as adults grow older, 
including opportunities to discuss stopping. Increasing the role of PCPs in 
polyp surveillance as patients grow older provides more opportunities for 
individualized recommendations, so patients can consider their own preferences, 
ask questions, and make a more informed choice for themselves. Changing existing 
systems and processes and creating supportive tools for shared decision-making 
specific to older adults with polyps would improve how surveillance colonoscopy 
is individualized in this population.

BACKGROUND: Persons with HIV (PWH) can now achieve a near-normal life expectancy 
due to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Despite widespread availability of ART in 
the United States (US), many of the country's approximate 1.1 million PWH are 
not achieving viral suppression due to poor ART adherence. Viral suppression 
rates are particularly low in Alabama (AL, 62%) and New York City (NYC, 67%). 
There is mixed evidence on the efficacy of community health workers (CHW) and 
mHealth interventions for improving ART adherence and viral suppression in PWH 
thus, we sought to combine these interventions and test the efficacy for 
improving health outcomes in PWH.
METHODS: The CHAMPS study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial among 300 PWH 
with suboptimal primary care appointment adherence (n = 150 in AL and 150 in 
NYC) over the course of 12 months. Participants are randomly assigned to CHAMPS 
(intervention) or a standard-of-care (control) arm. Participants in the 
intervention arm are given a CleverCap pill bottle that syncs to the WiseApp to 
track medication adherence, reminds users to take their medication at a set 
time, and enables communication with CHW. All participants complete baseline, 
6-month, and 12-month follow-up visits where surveys are administered and, CD4 
and HIV-1 viral load are obtained through blood draw.
DISCUSSION: Maintaining ART adherence has significant implications in HIV 
management and transmission. mHealth technologies have been shown to optimize 
the provision of health services, produce positive changes in health behavior, 
and significantly improve health outcomes. CHW interventions also provide 
personal support to PWH. The combination of these strategies may provide the 
necessary intensity to increase ART adherence and clinic attendance among PWH at 
highest risk for low engagement. Delivering care remotely enables CHW to 
contact, assess, and support numerous participants throughout the day, reducing 
burden on CHW and potentially improving intervention durability for PWH. The 
adoption of the WiseApp coupled with community health worker sessions in the 
CHAMPS study has the potential to improve HIV health outcomes, and will add to 
the growing knowledge of mHealth and CHW efforts to improve PWH medication 
adherence and viral suppression.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with Clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT04562649) on 9/24/20.

BACKGROUND: Blood transfusions represent common medical procedures, which 
provide essential supportive therapy. However, these procedures are notoriously 
expensive for healthcare services and not without risk. The potential threat of 
transfusion-related complications, such as the development of pathogenic 
infections and the occurring of alloimmunization events, alongside the donor's 
dependence, strongly limits the availability of transfusion units and represents 
significant concerns in transfusion medicine. Moreover, a further increase in 
the demand for donated blood and blood transfusion, combined with a reduction in 
blood donors, is expected as a consequence of the decrease in birth rates and 
increase in life expectancy in industrialized countries.
MAIN BODY: An emerging and alternative strategy preferred over blood transfusion 
is the in vitro production of blood cells from immortalized erythroid cells. The 
high survival capacity alongside the stable and longest proliferation time of 
immortalized erythroid cells could allow the generation of a large number of 
cells over time, which are able to differentiate into blood cells. However, a 
large-scale, cost-effective production of blood cells is not yet a routine 
clinical procedure, as being dependent on the optimization of culture conditions 
of immortalized erythroid cells.
CONCLUSION: In our review, we provide an overview of the most recent erythroid 
cell immortalization approaches, while also describing and discussing related 
advancements of establishing immortalized erythroid cell lines.

OBJECTIVE: The aim: Comparative analysis of average life expectancy, mortality 
from diseases of the circulatory system, gross regional product, and density of 
general practitioners in regions with different levels of urbanization.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: We compared the following 
characteristics of groups classified by level of urbanization: average density 
of general practitioners per 10,000, average life expectancy and mortality from 
diseases of the circulatory system per 1,000, average gross regional product per 
1 person.
RESULTS: Results: The groups did not differ in average life expectancy. The 
highest rate of mortality from diseases of the circulatory system- in the group 
with average level of urbanization, the lowest- in the group with low level of 
urbanization (p<0.05). The highest value of gross regional product per person is 
in the group with high level of urbanization, and the lowest is in the group 
with low level (p<0.05). The lowest density of primary care doctors per 10,000 
is in the group with high level of urbanization, and the highest is in the group 
with low level of urbanization (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: When planning staffing of health care institutions, it 
is necessary to take into account the level of urbanization of the region and 
ensure status of the general practitioner as a leading medical specialist 
responsible for medical care during the first meeting with the patient and his 
subsequent follow-up.

Indoor air quality (IAQ) has attracted a lot of attention due to its complexity 
and direct effect on human health. Indoor settings in libraries entail various 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) linked to the aging and degradation of print 
material. The effect of the storage environment on paper life expectancy was 
investigated by targeting the VOC emissions of old and new books using headspace 
solid phase micro extraction-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry 
(HS-SPME-GC/MS) analysis. "Sniffing" of book degradation markers showed both 
ubiquitously and infrequently occurring VOCs. Old book "degradomics" revealed 
mostly alcohols (57%) and ethers (12%), whereas new books resulted mainly to 
ketones (40%) and aldehydes (21%). Chemometric processing of the results with 
principal component analysis (PCA) corroborated our initial observations and was 
able to discriminate the books by age into three groups: very old books (from 
the 1600 s to mid-1700), old books (from the 1800s to the early 1900s), and 
modern books (from the mid-twentieth century onwards) based on their gaseous 
markers. The measured mean concentrations of selected VOCs (acetic acid, 
furfural, benzene, and toluene) were below the respective guidelines set for 
similar places (i.e. museums). The applied non-invasive, green analytical 
methodology (HS-SPME-GC/MS) can assist librarians, stakeholders, and researchers 
to evaluate the IAQ, as well as the degree of degradation, and take the 
appropriate measures for book restoration and monitoring protocols.

BACKGROUND: The number of people with dementia increases in an aging society; 
therefore, promoting policies for dementia throughout the community is crucial 
to creating a dementia-friendly society. Understanding the status of older 
adults with dementia in each region of Japan will be a helpful indicator. We 
calculated Dementia-free Life Expectancy and aimed to examine regional 
disparities and their associated factors.
METHODS: We calculated Dementia-free Life Expectancy and Life Expectancy with 
Dementia for each secondary medical area in Japan based on the Degree of 
Independence in Daily Living for the Demented Elderly, using data extracted from 
the Japanese long-term care insurance claims database. We then conducted a 
partial least squares regression analysis, the objective variables being 
Dementia-free Life Expectancy and Life Expectancy with Dementia for both sexes 
at age 65, and explanatory regional-level variables included demographic, 
socioeconomic, and healthcare resources variables.
RESULTS: The mean estimated regional-level Dementia-free Life Expectancy at age 
65 was 17.33 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.27-17.38) for males and 
20.05 years (95% CI 19.99-20.11) for females. Three latent components identified 
by partial least squares regression analysis represented urbanicity, 
socioeconomic conditions, and health services-related factors of the secondary 
medical areas. The second component explained the most variation in 
Dementia-free Life Expectancy of the three, indicating that higher socioeconomic 
status was associated with longer Dementia-free Life Expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: There were regional disparities in secondary medical area level 
Dementia-free Life Expectancy. Our results suggest that socioeconomic conditions 
are more related to Dementia-free Life Expectancy than urbanicity and health 
services-related factors.

INTRODUCTION: Diet-related inflammation is associated with adiposity. Obesity 
and inflammation in early life may have adverse health outcomes in later life; 
however, the socio-ecological predictors of a pro-inflammatory diet in childhood 
and adolescence are not well understood. This rapid scoping review aims to 
summarise the current state of research from observational studies investigating 
socio-ecological predictors (childhood, parental, familial, demographic and 
chronobiological risk factors) and their association with diet-associated 
inflammation and adiposity in children and adolescents.
METHODS: This scoping review will be conducted using the frameworks based on the 
Joanna Briggs Institute and Arksey and O'Malley and the Population, Concept and 
Context (PCC) mnemonic. Searches were conducted in OVID Medline, Cinahl and 
Embase, with adaptations as required. The piloted study selection process will 
utilise two reviewers for study selection, with reference lists checked for 
included studies. A third reviewer will moderate disagreements. Data will be 
extracted by one reviewer and calibrated by a second reviewer.
RESULTS: The results will be reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) 
checklist and PRISMA-ScR flow diagram. The main findings will be synthesised 
into themes and concepts narratively. Tables and graphs will present 
frequencies, study details and categorical descriptions.
DISCUSSION: This scoping review will provide an overview of the research 
conducted to date regarding predictors of diet-related inflammation in childhood 
and their associations with adiposity. Better understanding of the factors 
associated with a more inflammatory diet in childhood may be useful for 
clinicians and policy makers when designing and implementing health 
interventions.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with cancer are being given increasing responsibility 
for the self-management of their health and illness. In other chronic diseases, 
individuals who experience treatment burden are at risk of poorer health 
outcomes. Less is known about treatment burden and its impact on individuals 
with cancer. This systematic review investigated perceptions of treatment burden 
in individuals living with and beyond cancer.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Medline, CINAHL and EMBASE databases were searched for 
qualitative studies that explored treatment burden in individuals with a 
diagnosis of breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer at any stage of their 
diagnostic/treatment trajectory. Descriptive and thematic analyses were 
conducted. Study quality was assessed using a modified CASP checklist. The 
review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021145601). Forty-eight studies 
were included. Health management after cancer involved cognitive, practical, and 
relational work for patients. Individuals were motivated to perform health 
management work to improve life-expectancy, manage symptoms, and regain a sense 
of normality. Performing health care work could be empowering and gave 
individuals a sense of control. Treatment burden occurred when there was a 
mismatch between the resources needed for health management and their 
availability. Individuals with chronic and severe symptoms, financial 
challenges, language barriers, and limited social support are particularly at 
risk of treatment burden. For those with advanced cancer, consumption of time 
and energy by health care work is a significant burden.
CONCLUSION: Treatment burden could be an important mediator of inequities in 
cancer outcomes. Many of the factors leading to treatment burden in individuals 
with cancer are potentially modifiable. Clinicians should consider carefully 
what they are asking or expecting patients to do, and the resources required, 
including how much patient time will be consumed.

A Narrative Review of Patellar Resurfacing Versus Non-resurfacing in Total Knee 
Arthroplasty.

The number of individuals who experience the symptoms of gonarthrosis rises 
proportionally as life expectancy rises and the population becomes more active. 
The purpose of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is to lessen pain and restore knee 
function, and it has a high success rate. The restoration of patellar tracking 
in addition to the proper alignment of the femoral and tibial components 
contributes to the success of the arthroplasty and the patient's happiness. 
Replacement of the knee is not an easy process. One of the major objectives of 
total knee replacement is to achieve the proper rotation of the femoral 
components. A critical step that affects postoperative outcomes in total knee 
arthroplasty is the correct alignment of the femoral component. The axial plane 
of the femoral component is to blame for flexion stability, knee joint 
kinematics, flexion alignment, and patellar tracking. The patella is the largest 
sesamoid bone in the human body, and its major role is to enhance the 
quadriceps' moment arm, which allows the knee to expand. The distribution of 
patellofemoral compressive pressures during knee flexion and the centralization 
of the quadriceps muscles' multidirectional pull during extension are both 
critical functions of the patella. After primary knee arthroplasty, there are 8% 
more cases of anterior knee discomfort than there were before. Whether or not 
the patella was resurfaced, patients with primary TKA experience anterior knee 
discomfort. Patella baja is caused by excessive joint line elevation, which 
causes persistent overload and discomfort. The design of the TKR might have an 
impact on postoperative patellofemoral problems. After TKR, patellofemoral 
maltracking and patellar dislocation are often caused by surgical mistakes.
