BACKGROUND: An estimated 20-30% of end-stage lung disease patients awaiting lung 
transplant die whilst on the waiting list due to a shortage of suitable donor 
lungs. Ex-Vivo Lung Perfusion is a technique that reconditions donor lungs 
initially not deemed usable in order to make them suitable for transplantation, 
thereby increasing the donor pool. In this study, an economic evaluation was 
conducted as part of DEVELOP-UK, a multi-centre study assessing the clinical and 
cost-effectiveness of the Ex-Vivo Lung Perfusion technique in the United 
Kingdom.
METHODS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of a UK adult lung transplant 
service combining both standard and Ex-Vivo Lung Perfusion transplants compared 
to a service including only standard lung transplants. A Markov model was 
developed and populated with a combination of DEVELOP-UK, published and clinical 
routine data, and extrapolated to a lifetime horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity 
and scenario analyses were used to explore uncertainty in the final outcomes.
RESULTS: Base-case model results estimated life years gained of 0.040, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained of 0.045 and an incremental cost per 
QALY of £90,000 for Ex-Vivo Lung Perfusion. Scenario analyses carried out 
suggest that an improved rate of converting unusable donor lungs using Ex-Vivo 
Lung Perfusion, similar resource use post-transplant for both standard and EVLP 
lung transplant and applying increased waiting list costs would reduce ICERs to 
approximately £30,000 or below.
CONCLUSION: DEVELOP-UK base-case results suggest that incorporating Ex-Vivo Lung 
Perfusion into the UK adult lung transplant service is more effective, 
increasing the number of donor lungs available for transplant, but would not 
currently be considered cost-effective in the UK using the present NICE 
threshold. However, results were sensitive to change in some model parameters 
and in several plausible scenario analyses results indicate that a service 
incorporating Ex-vivo lung perfusion would be considered cost-effective .

BACKGROUND: Technological advances in health care currently provide better care 
conditions and have increased survival rates of premature infants, along with 
increasing the life expectancy of chronically ill children. In this context, the 
home care service has emerged as an effective tool for the treatment of this 
group of children. Thus, this preliminary study aimed at evaluating the 
effectiveness of the Home Care Service (HCS) with regard to pediatric care.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed through a medical record analysis 
of a tertiary hospital in Minas Gerais/Brazil. Two groups were compared: 36 
patients from the HCS (home group) and 13 patients hospitalized with an 
indication for home care (hospital group). To analyze the effectiveness of HCS, 
we evaluated the number of readmissions, infection rate, number of procedures, 
and optimization of beds.
RESULTS: The hospital group presented 6.04 times more infections and was 
submitted to 6.43 times more procedures. The home group presented lower 
readmission rates; with 41.66% of children studied not being readmitted and 
76.19% of those who needed readmissions did so after more than 30 days from 
hospital discharge. HCS optimized hospital beds and allowed, over five (5) 
years, the hospitalization of around 102 patients in the hospital studied.
CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, HCS reduced the number of procedures and 
infections compared to hospitalized patients. Moreover, HCS presented lower 
readmission rates and optimized hospital beds, which could be considered an 
indication of effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Septic shock is a major public health problem that is associated 
with up to 50% mortality. Unfavorable outcomes are mainly attributed to multiple 
organ failure (MOF) resulting from an uncontrolled inflammatory response and 
ischemia-reperfusion processes. REmote ischemic COnditioning (RECO) is a 
promising intervention to prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury. We hypothesize 
that RECO would reduce the severity of septic shock-induced MOF.
METHODS/DESIGN: RECO in septic shock patients (RECO-Sepsis study) is an ongoing, 
prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, testing whether RECO, as 
an adjuvant therapy to conventional treatment in septic shock, decreases the 
severity of MOF as assessed by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
score. Adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit with documented or 
suspected infection, lactatemia > 2 mmol/l, and treated with norepinephrine for 
less than 12 h are potentially eligible for the study. Non-inclusion criteria 
are: having expressed the wish not to be resuscitated, contraindication for the 
use of a brachial cuff on both arms, intercurrent disease with an expected life 
expectancy of less than 24 h, cardiac arrest, and pregnant or breastfeeding 
women. After enrollment, patients are randomized (n = 180) 1:1 to receive RECO 
or no adjunctive intervention. RECO consists of four cycles of cuff inflation to 
200 mmHg for 5 min and then deflation to 0 mmHg for another 5 min. RECO is 
performed at inclusion and repeated 12 and 24 h later. The primary endpoint is 
the mean daily SOFA score up to day 4 after inclusion. Secondary outcomes 
include the need for organ support, hospital length of stay, and 90-day 
mortality.
DISCUSSION: Results of this proof-of-concept trial should provide information on 
the efficacy of RECO in patients with septic shock.

Deprescribing, an integral component of a continuum of good prescribing 
practices, is the process of medication withdrawal or dose reduction to correct 
or prevent medication-related complications, improve outcomes, and reduce costs. 
Deprescribing is particularly applicable to the commonly encountered multimorbid 
older adult with cardiovascular disease and concomitant geriatric conditions 
such as polypharmacy, frailty, and cognitive dysfunction-a combination rarely 
addressed in current clinical practice guidelines. Triggers to deprescribe 
include present or expected adverse drug reactions, unnecessary polypharmacy, 
and the need to align medications with goals of care when life expectancy is 
reduced. Using a framework to deprescribe, this review addresses the rationale, 
evidence, and strategies for deprescribing cardiovascular and some 
noncardiovascular medications.

OBJECTIVES: While very early mobilisation (VEM) intervention for stroke patients 
was shown not to be effective at 3 months, 12 month clinical and economical 
outcomes remain unknown. The aim was to assess cost-effectiveness of a VEM 
intervention within a phase III randomised controlled trial (RCT).
DESIGN: An economic evaluation alongside a RCT, and detailed resource use and 
cost analysis over 12 months post-acute stroke.
SETTING: Multi-country RCT involved 58 stroke centres.
PARTICIPANTS: 2104 patients with acute stroke who were admitted to a stroke 
unit.
INTERVENTION: A very early rehabilitation intervention within 24 hours of stroke 
onset METHODS: Cost-utility analyses were undertaken according to pre-specified 
protocol measuring VEM against usual care (UC) based on 12 month outcomes. The 
analysis was conducted using both health sector and societal perspectives. Unit 
costs were sourced from participating countries. Details on resource use (both 
health and non-health) were sourced from cost case report form. Dichotomised 
modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores (0 to 2 vs 3 to 6) and quality adjusted-life 
years (QALYs) were used to compare the treatment effect of VEM and UC. The base 
case analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis and 95% CI for cost 
and QALYs were estimated by bootstrapping. Sensitivity analysis were conducted 
to examine the robustness of base case results.
RESULTS: VEM and UC groups were comparable in the quantity of resource use and 
cost of each component. There were no differences in the probability of 
achieving a favourable mRS outcome (0.030, 95% CI -0.022 to 0.082), QALYs 
(0.013, 95% CI -0.041 to 0.016) and cost (AUD1082, 95% CI -$2520 to $4685 from a 
health sector perspective or AUD102, 95% CI -$6907 to $7111, from a societal 
perspective including productivity cost). Sensitivity analysis achieved results 
with mostly overlapped CIs.
CONCLUSIONS: VEM and UC were associated with comparable costs, mRS outcome and 
QALY gains at 12 months. Compared with to UC, VEM is unlikely to be 
cost-effective. The long-term data collection during the trial also informed 
resource use and cost of care post-acute stroke across five participating 
countries.

Today, HIV-infected (HIV+) patients can be treated efficiently with combined 
antiretroviral therapy (cART), leading to long-term suppression of viral load, 
in turn increasing life expectancy. While cART reduced the occurrence of 
HIV-associated dementia, the prevalence of subtle forms of HIV-associated 
neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is unchanged. This is related to persistent 
immune activation within the CNS, which is not addressed by cART. Pathologic 
processes leading to HAND consist of the release of proinflammatory cytokines, 
chemokines, reactive oxygen metabolites and glutamate, and the release of HIV 
proteins. Some of those processes can be targeted using medications with 
immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties such as dimethyl fumarate, 
teriflunomide, or minocycline. In this review, we will summarize the knowledge 
about key pathogenic processes involved in HAND and potential therapeutic 
avenues to target HAND.

STUDY QUESTION: Which clinical and ethical aspects of preimplantation genetic 
testing for monogenic disorders or structural rearrangements (PGT-M, PGT-SR) 
should be considered when accepting requests and counselling couples for PGT 
when applied for more than one condition (combination-PGT; cPGT-M/SR)?
SUMMARY ANSWER: cPGT is a feasible extension of the practice of PGT-M/SR that 
may require adapting the criteria many countries have in place with regard to 
indications-setting for PGT-M/SR, while leading to complex choices that require 
timely counselling and information.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Although PGT-M/SR is usually performed to prevent 
transmission of one disorder, requests for PGT-M/SR for more than one condition 
(cPGT-M/SR) are becoming less exceptional. However, knowledge about implications 
for a responsible application of such treatments is lacking.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Retrospective review of all (40) PGT-M/SR 
applications concerning more than one genetic condition over the period 
1995-2018 in the files of the Dutch national PGT centre. This comprises all 
relevant national data since the start of PGT in the Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING AND METHODS: Data regarding cPGT-M/SR cases were 
collected by means of reviewing medical files of couples applying for cPGT-M/SR. 
Ethical challenges arising with cPGT-M/SR were explored against the background 
of PGT-M/SR regulations in several European countries, as well as of relevant 
ESHRE-guidance regarding both indications-setting and transfer-decisions.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We report 40 couples applying for cPGT-M/SR 
of which 16 couples started their IVF treatment. Together they underwent 39 IVF 
cycles leading to the birth of five healthy children. Of the couples applying 
for cPGT, 45% differentiated between a primary and secondary condition in terms 
of perceived severity. In the light of an altered balance of benefits and 
drawbacks, we argue the 'high risk of a serious condition' standard that many 
countries uphold as governing indications-setting, should be lowered for 
secondary conditions in couples who already have an indication for PGT-M/SR. As 
a consequence of cPGT, professionals will more often be confronted with requests 
for transferring embryos known to be affected with a condition that they were 
tested for. In line with ESHRE guidance, such transfers may well be acceptable, 
on the condition of avoiding a high risk of a child with a seriously diminished 
quality of life.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We are the first to give an overview of 
cPGT-M/SR treatments. Retrospective analysis was performed using national data, 
possibly not reflecting current trends worldwide.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our observations have led to recommendations 
for cPGT-M/SR that may add to centre policy making and to the formulation of 
professional guidelines. Given that the introduction of generic methods for 
genomic analysis in PGT will regularly yield incidental findings leading to 
transfer requests with these same challenges, the importance of our discussion 
exceeds the present discussion of cPGT.

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has significantly reduced the 
mortality rate and morbidity, and has increased the life expectancy of the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients. However, the current cART is 
incapable of eradicating viruses from the human body, and HIV remains one of the 
most notorious viruses mankind has ever faced. HIV-1 enters target cells through 
the binding of gp120 viral protein to a CD4 receptor and then to a coreceptor, 
C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) or C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). 
Individuals homozygous for a 32-bp deletion in the CCR5 allele, CCR5Δ32, are 
almost completely resistant to HIV-1 acquisition. Moreover, several of natural 
CXCR4 mutants which have been identified can reduce HIV-1 entry without 
impairing either ligand binding or signaling. In order to get rid of indefinite 
treatment for HIV patients, there is a growing interest in creating an 
HIV-resistant immune system through the use of CCR5 and CXCR4-modified 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Proof of concept for this approach has been 
provided in the instance of "Berlin patient" transplanted with allogeneic stem 
cells from a donor with homozygosity for the CCR5Δ32 deletion. Here, we review 
the progress of coreceptor-based HSC gene therapy for HIV disease and present 
new strategies.

BACKGROUND: The rise in the number and earlier age of onset of obese persons has 
raised critical concerns about consequences of obesity; however, recent evidence 
suggests that the impact of obesity on health outcomes may have changed. This 
study aims to assess the change of the impact of obesity on active life 
expectancy among Americans aged 70 years and older over almost two decades, 
1993-1998 to 2010-2014.
METHODS: For each period, we use three waves of data from the Health and 
Retirement Study to estimate age-specific transition probabilities between 
health states. The average number of years active and disabled is calculated 
with Interpolated Markov Chain software based on estimated transition 
probabilities.
RESULTS: Overall obesity and severe obesity increased markedly over time yet 
active life expectancy expanded for all individuals and the increases are 
greater among the obese and women. Increases in total and active life expectancy 
occurred because of the changing association of obesity with disability and 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals at age 70 years in the later period in each weight 
group could expect to live a smaller proportion of remaining life with 
activities of daily living disability than those in the earlier period. High 
levels of obesity continue to have significant adverse effects on the quality of 
life. The increasing prevalence of severe obesity and the growing number of 
older persons may result in substantial additional health care needs and costs. 
Continued effort to improve cardiovascular health is required to control the 
burden of obesity in later life in an era of rising obesity.

OBJECTIVES: Risk stratification has so far been evaluated under the assumption 
that women fully adhere to screening recommendations. However, the participation 
in German cancer screening programs remains low at 54%. The question arises 
whether risk-stratified screening is economically efficient under the assumption 
that adherence is not perfect.
METHOD: We have adapted a micro-simulation Markov model to the German context. 
Annual, biennial, and triennial routine screening are compared with five 
risk-adapted strategies using thresholds of relative risk to stratify screening 
frequencies. We used three outcome variables (mortality reduction, 
quality-adjusted life years, and false-positive results) under the assumption of 
full adherence vs. an adherence rate of 54%. Strategies are evaluated using 
efficiency frontiers and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA).
RESULTS: The reduced adherence rate affects both performance and cost; 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios remain constant. The results of PSA show 
that risk-stratified screening strategies are more efficient than biennial 
routine screening under certain conditions. At any willingness-to-pay (WTP), 
there is a risk-stratified alternative with a higher likelihood of being the 
best choice. However, without explicit decision criteria and WTP, 
risk-stratified screening is not more efficient than biennial routine screening. 
Potential improvements in the adherence rates have significant health gains and 
budgetary implications.
CONCLUSION: If the participation rate for mammographic screening is as low as in 
Germany, stratified screening is not clearly more efficient than routine 
screening but dependent on the WTP. A more promising design for future 
stratified strategies is the combination of risk stratification mechanisms with 
interventions to improve the low adherence in selected high-risk groups.

According to the World Health Organization, global average life expectancy 
increased by 5.5 years between 2000 and 2016. This is the greatest increase in 
life expectancy since the 1960s. Identifying lifestyle choices which can be 
implemented in later life to support brain health are imperative given the 
increasing prevalence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as 
dementia. Music-making, specifically instrumental music-making, has been 
suggested to support cognition function and emotional wellbeing in later life. 
This review will distinguish instrumental music-making from other musical 
activities (i.e. singing or listening to music), specifically focusing on its 
influence on cognitive function in later life and its contribution to the 
emotional wellbeing and quality of life. This review will also explore the 
viability of instrumental music-making as an intervention to support brain 
health in later life.

The biocidal activity of Salmide®, a sodium chlorite-based oxyhalogen 
disinfectant, was tested alone and in combination with either 1.34 mM disodium 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.347 mM sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) or 
210 mM trisodium phosphate (Na3PO4) against a nalidixic acid-resistant strain of 
Salmonella typhimurium NAr inoculated onto fresh broiler drumstick skin. 
Following a 10-min exposure to increasing Salmide® concentrations (ranging from 
27 to 81 mM) at 37°C, the S. typhimurium NAr population on the broiler skin was 
reduced by 57.3 to 85.2%. Each Salmide® test concentration applied in 
combination with 1.34 mM EDTA produced S. typhimurium NAr population reductions 
in excess of 97%. A similar trend (93.1 to 98.2% reductions) was observed for 
treatments containing 27, 54 or 81 mM Salmide® and 0.347 mM SLS. However, when 
S. typhimurium NAr was exposed to 210 mM Na3PO4 alone, a 99.5% population 
reduction was observed. This value was not significantly different from those 
obtained for treatments containing 210 mM Na3PO4 and 27, 54 or 81 mM Salmide®. 
In addition, 27 mM Salmide® was evaluated alone or in combination with 1.34 mM 
EDTA for the extension of broiler drumstick shelf-life. Based on the enumeration 
of mesophilic and psychrotrophic populations, the combined Salmide® and EDTA 
treatment was shown to produce a slight extension in broiler drumstick 
shelf-life compared to an untreated control. Treatment effects detected by 
drumstick skin Hunter color reflectance measurements during refrigerated storage 
were inconsistent.

IgA antibodies have broad potential as a novel therapeutic platform based on 
their superior receptor-mediated cytotoxic activity, potent neutralization of 
pathogens, and ability to transcytose across mucosal barriers via polymeric 
immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR)-mediated transport, compared to traditional 
IgG-based drugs. However, the transition of IgA into clinical development has 
been challenged by complex expression and characterization, as well as rapid 
serum clearance that is thought to be mediated by glycan receptor scavenging of 
recombinantly produced IgA monomer bearing incompletely sialylated N-linked 
glycans. Here, we present a comprehensive biochemical, biophysical, and 
structural characterization of recombinantly produced monomeric, dimeric and 
polymeric human IgA. We further explore two strategies to overcome the rapid 
serum clearance of polymeric IgA: removal of all N-linked glycosylation sites 
creating an aglycosylated polymeric IgA and engineering in FcRn binding with the 
generation of a polymeric IgG-IgA Fc fusion. While previous reports and the 
results presented in this study indicate that glycan-mediated clearance plays a 
major role for monomeric IgA, systemic clearance of polymeric IgA in mice is 
predominantly controlled by mechanisms other than glycan receptor clearance, 
such as pIgR-mediated transcytosis. The developed IgA platform now provides the 
potential to specifically target pIgR expressing tissues, while maintaining low 
systemic exposure.

INTRODUCTION: We aimed to evaluate the preferred treatment strategy for patients 
with symptomatic cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM).
METHODS: In a decision model, we compared neurosurgical, radiosurgical, and 
conservative management. A literature review yielded the risks and outcomes of 
interventions, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and seizures. Patients with CCM 
rated their quality of life to determine utilities. We estimated the expected 
number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the ICH recurrence risk over 
five years, according to mode of presentation and CCM location (brainstem vs. 
other). We performed analyses with a time horizon of five years.
RESULTS: Using the best available data, the expected number of QALYs for 
brainstem CCM presenting with ICH or focal neurological deficit was 2.84 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 2.54-3.08) for conservative, 3.01 (95% CI: 2.86-3.16) 
for neurosurgical, and 3.03 (95% CI: 2.88-3.18) for radiosurgical intervention; 
those for non-brainstem CCM presenting with ICH or focal neurological deficit 
were 3.08 (95% CI: 2.85-3.31) for conservative, 3.21 (95% CI: 3.01-3.36) for 
neurosurgical, and 3.19 (95% CI: 2.98-3.37) for radiosurgical intervention. For 
CCM presenting with epilepsy, QALYs were 3.09 (95% CI: 3.03-3.16) for 
conservative, 3.33 (95% CI: 3.31-3.34) for neurosurgical, and 3.27 (95% CI: 
3.24-3.30) for radiosurgical intervention.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: For the initial five years after presentation, our 
study provides Class III evidence that for CCM presenting with ICH or focal 
neurological deficit conservative management is the first option, and for CCM 
presenting with epilepsy CCM intervention should be considered. More comparative 
studies with long-term follow-up are needed.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare differences in patient characteristics 
and clinical outcomes of nonagenarians undergoing transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement (TAVR) versus patients younger than 90 years of age and to test the 
predictive accuracy of the logistic EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac 
Operative Risk Evaluation), the EuroSCORE II, and the STS-PROM (Society of 
Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality) for mortality after TAVR in 
nonagenarians.
BACKGROUND: The prevalence of severe aortic valve stenosis is increasing due to 
the rising life expectancy. However, there are limited data evaluating outcomes 
in patients older than 90 years of age. Moreover, the predictive accuracy 
of risk scores for mortality has not been evaluated in nonagenarian patients 
undergoing transfemoral TAVR.
METHODS: The CENTER (Cerebrovascular EveNts in Patients Undergoing TranscathetER 
Aortic Valve Implantation) collaboration (N = 12,381) is an international 
collaboration consisting of 3 national registries, 6 local or multicenter 
registries, and 1 prospective clinical study, selected through a systematic 
online search. The primary endpoint of this study was the difference in 30-day 
all-cause mortality and stroke after TAVR in nonagenarians versus patients 
younger than 90 years of age. Secondary endpoints included differences in 
baseline characteristics, in-hospital outcomes, and the differences in 
predictive accuracy of the logistic EuroSCORE, the EuroSCORE II, and STS-PROM.
RESULTS: A total of 882 nonagenarians and 11,499 patients younger than 90 years 
of age undergoing transfemoral TAVR between 2007 and 2018 were included. 
Nonagenarians had considerably fewer comorbidities than their counterparts. 
Nevertheless, rates of 30-day mortality (9.9% vs. 5.4%; relative risk [RR]: 1.8; 
95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4 to 2.3; p = 0.001), in-hospital stroke (3.0% 
vs. 1.9%; RR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.3; p = 0.04), major or life-threatening 
bleeding (8.1% vs. 5.5%; RR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.2; p = 0.004), and new-onset 
atrial fibrillation (7.9% vs. 5.2%; RR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.2; p = 0.01) were 
higher in nonagenarians. The STS-PROM adequately estimated mortality in 
nonagenarians, with an observed-expected mortality ratio of 1.0.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large, global, patient-level analysis, mortality after 
transfemoral TAVR was 2-fold higher in nonagenarians compared with patients 
younger than 90 years of age, despite the lower prevalence of baseline 
comorbidities. Moreover, nonagenarians had a higher risk of in-hospital stroke, 
major or life-threatening bleeding, and new-onset atrial fibrillation. The 
STS-PROM was the only surgical risk score that accurately predicted the risk of 
mortality in nonagenarians.

AIMS: Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended as a treatment for women with high 
recurrence risk early breast cancer. Older women are less likely to receive 
chemotherapy than younger women. This study investigated the impact of 
chemotherapy on breast cancer-specific survival in women aged 70 + years using 
English registry data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cancer registration data were obtained from two English 
regions from 2002 to 2012 (n = 29 728). The impact of patient-level 
characteristics on the probability of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy was 
explored using logistic regression. Survival modelling was undertaken to show 
the effect of chemotherapy and age/health status on breast cancer-specific 
survival. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation.
RESULTS: In total, 11 735 surgically treated early breast cancer patients were 
identified. Use of adjuvant chemotherapy has increased over time. Younger age at 
diagnosis, increased nodal involvement, tumour size and grade, oestrogen 
receptor-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive disease 
were all associated with increased probability of receiving chemotherapy. 
Chemotherapy was associated with a significant reduction in the hazard of breast 
cancer-specific mortality in women with high risk cancer, after adjusting for 
patient-level characteristics (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 
0.67-0.81).
DISCUSSION: Chemotherapy is associated with an improved breast cancer-specific 
survival in older women with early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence . 
Lower rates of chemotherapy use in older women may, therefore, contribute to 
inferior cancer outcomes. Decisions on potential benefits for individual 
patients should be made on the basis of life expectancy, treatment tolerance and 
patient preference.

    Lancet Respir Med. 2019 Aug;7(8):640-641.

BACKGROUND: Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) treated with 
PRM-151, a recombinant human pentraxin 2 protein, in a phase 2 double-blind, 
randomised controlled trial had significantly reduced decline in percentage of 
predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) and stabilised 6-min walking distance 
compared with placebo over a 28-week period. Here we report the 76-week results 
of an open-label extension study.
METHODS: Patients who completed the 28-week double-blind period of the 
PRM-151-202 trial were eligible to participate in the open-label extension 
study. Patients previously enrolled in the PRM-151 group continued this 
treatment and those previously in the placebo group crossed over to PRM-151. All 
patients received PRM-151 in 28-week cycles with loading doses of 10 mg/kg by 60 
min intravenous infusions on days 1, 3, and 5 in the first week of each cycle 
followed by one infusion of 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks. The primary objective of the 
open-label extension study was to assess the long-term safety and tolerability 
of PRM-151, which were assessed by analysing adverse events (AEs) up to week 76 
in all patients who received at least one dose of PRM-151 during the open-label 
extension study. Exploratory efficacy analyses were done by assessing changes 
from baseline in percentage of predicted FVC and 6-min walking distance, with 
descriptive statistics to week 76 and with random-intercept mixed models to week 
52. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02550873, and 
with EudraCT, number 2014-004782-24.
FINDINGS: Of 116 patients who completed the double-blind treatment period, 111 
entered the open-label extension study (74 from the PRM-151 group and 37 from 
the placebo group). 84 (76%) of 111 patients received concomitant IPF therapy 
(pirfenidone n=55 or nintedanib n=29). AEs were consistent with long-term IPF 
sequelae. 31 (28%) patients had serious AEs. Those occurring in two or more 
patients were pneumonia (six [5%] of 111), IPF exacerbation (four [4%]), IPF 
progression (four [4%]), and chest pain (two [2%]). 21 (19%) patients had severe 
AEs, of which IPF exacerbation and IPF progression each occurred in two (2%) 
patients. Two (2%) patients experienced life-threatening AEs (one had pneumonia 
and one had small-cell lung cancer extensive stage). A persistent treatment 
effect was observed for PRM-151 in patients who continued treatment, with a 
decline in percentage of predicted FVC of -3·6% per year and in 6-min walking 
distance of -10·5 m per year at week 52. In patients who started PRM-151 during 
the open-label extension study, compared with the slopes for placebo, decline 
reduced for percentage of predicted FVC (from -8·7% per year in weeks 0-28 to 
-0·9% per year in weeks 28-52, p<0·0001) and 6-min walking distance (from -54·9 
m per year to -3·5 m per year, p=0·0224).
INTERPRETATION: Long-term treatment with PRM-151 was well tolerated and the 
effects on percentage of predicted FVC and 6-min walking distance were 
persistent on continuation and positive in patients who crossed over from 
placebo. These findings support further study of PRM-151 in larger populations 
of patients with IPF.

BACKGROUND: Glaucoma, particularly primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), is a 
leading cause of global blindness. Nearly half of all people with PACG are of 
Chinese descent. Population-level glaucoma screening has generally not been 
found to be cost-effective in high-income countries; however, this assessment 
has rarely been done in low-income or middle-income countries. We aimed to 
assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of population-level glaucoma 
screening in China.
METHODS: We developed decision-analytic Markov models for separate and combined 
screening for PACG and primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) to evaluate costs and 
benefits of community-level screening versus opportunistic case finding from a 
societal perspective. A cohort of individuals was followed in the model from age
