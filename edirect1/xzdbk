Systemic autoimmune inflammatory disorders confer a higher risk of 
cardiovascular (CV) disease leading to increased morbidity and mortality and 
reduced life expectancy compared to the general population. CV risk in systemic 
sclerosis (SSc) has not been studied extensively but surrogate markers of 
atherosclerosis namely carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and pulse wave 
velocity (PWV) are impaired in some but not all studies in SSc patients. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis 
assessed by cIMT and PWV between two well-characterized SSc and Rheumatoid 
Arthritis (RA) cohorts. Consecutive SSc patients attending the Scleroderma 
Clinic were compared with RA patients recruited in the Dudley Rheumatoid 
Arthritis Co-morbidity Cohort (DRACCO), a prospective study examining CV burden 
in RA. Augmentation Index (Aix75) and cIMT were measured in all participants. 
Propensity score matching was utilised to select patients from the two cohorts 
with similar demographic characteristics, CV risk factors and inflammatory load. 
Unpaired analysis was performed using unpaired t test for continuous variables 
and χ2 test for dichotomous variables. Statistical analysis was repeated using 
paired t test for continuous normal variables and McNemar's test for dichotomous 
variables. Fifty five age- and sex-matched SSc and RA patients were included in 
the analysis. No difference was demonstrated between SSc and RA subjects 
regarding cIMT (0.66 mm vs 0.63 mm, respectively) and Aix75% measurements (33.4 
vs 31.7, respectively) neither in paired (p = 0.623 for cIMT and p = 0.204 for 
Aix%) nor in unpaired t test analysis (p = 0.137 for cIMT and p = 0.397 for 
AIx%). The results of this comparative study show that subclinical 
atherosclerosis is comparable between SSc and RA, a systemic disease with 
well-defined high atherosclerotic burden. Such findings underscore the 
importance of CV risk management in SSc in parallel with other disease-related 
manifestations.

Psychiatric disorders such as Schizophrenia (SCZ) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) 
represent an evolutionary paradox, as they exhibit strong negative effects on 
fitness, such as decreased fecundity and early mortality, yet they persist at a 
worldwide prevalence of approximately 1%. Molecular mechanisms affecting 
lifespan, which may be widely common among complex diseases with fitness 
effects, can be studied by the integrated analysis of data from genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) of human longevity together with any disease of 
interest. Here, we report the first of such studies, focusing on the genetic 
overlap-pleiotropy-between two psychiatric disorders with shortened lifespan, 
SCZ and BD, and human parental lifespan (PLS) as a surrogate of life expectancy. 
Our results are twofold: first, we demonstrate extensive polygenic overlap 
between SCZ and PLS and to a lesser extent between BD and PLS. Second, we 
identified novel loci shared between PLS and SCZ (n = 39), and BD (n = 8). 
Whereas most of the identified SCZ (66%) and BD (62%) pleiotropic risk alleles 
were associated with reduced lifespan, we also detected some antagonistic 
protective alleles associated to shorter lifespans. In fact, top-associated SNPs 
with SCZ seems to explain longevity variance explained (LVE) better than many 
other life-threatening diseases, including Type 2 diabetes and most cancers, 
probably due to a high overlap with smoking-related pathways. Overall, our study 
provides evidence of a genetic burden driven through premature mortality among 
people with SCZ, which can have profound implications for understanding, and 
potentially treating, the mortality gap associated with this psychiatric 
disorder.

AIM: Since cervical joint position error (JPE) and visual dependency (VD) may 
reflect altered ascending inputs from the neck receptors, the aim of the present 
study was to test how these parameters may be impacted by those clinical 
parameters in cervicogenic dizziness (CGD) patients when compared with healthy 
subjects participants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 93 subjects participants fulfilling inclusion criteria 
for CGD and 98 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects volunteers - undergoing 
cervical relocation and rod and disc test to evaluate JPE and VD, respectively - 
were compared to each other. Cervical range of motion (CROM), Dizziness Handicap 
Inventory (DHI), Neck Disability Index (NDI), Neck pain intensity (NPI), Tampa 
Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-17) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS) were also collected in both groups.
RESULTS: When compared to healthy participants, CGD patients were found to have 
a higher degree of JPE in right (p = 0.008, mean difference, MD: 2.88) and left 
(p = 0.006, MD: 2.55) rotation as well as in extension (p = 0.011, MD: 2.31), 
flexion (p = 0.009, MD: 2.35) and mean value (p = 0.001, MD: 2.53) and higher 
degrees of error in CCW at +40° and -40° (p = 0.012, MD: 0.85 and p = 0.016, MD: 
0.82, respectively) and CW at +40° and -40° (p = 0.018, MD: 0.83 and p = 0.015 
MD: 0.81, respectively). CGD patients also demonstrated a significant reduction 
in degrees of CROM in active flexion (p = 0.011, MD: -34.63), extension 
(p = 0.018, MD: -21.67), left (p = 0.012, MD: -28.29) and right (p = 0.009, MD: 
-28.52) rotation, and left (p = 0.02, MD: -7.29) and right (p = 0.021, MD: 
-5.05) lateral flexion. Furthermore, these patients demonstrated higher scores 
in total DHI (p = 0.007, MD: 25.17) (and relative DHI-P, DHI-F, DHI-E; 
p = 0.009, MD: 11.4; p = 0.014, MD: 8.73 and p = 0.018, MD: 5.03, respectively), 
in TSK-17 (p = 0.017, MD: 17.56), and HADS, both in anxiety (p = 0.022, MD: 
4.62) and depression (p = 0.02, MD: 7.31) subscale.
CONCLUSIONS: A possible common physiopathological background may impact on 
processes involved in both the JPE and VD behaviour, entangled in a vicious 
circle with the impaired subjective clinical and quality of life perception.

BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced disease often overestimate their life 
expectancy, which potentially impacts decision making.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the nature and source of hospice patients' life expectancy 
estimates, about which little is known.
DESIGN: Using semi-structured interviews, patients were asked to estimate their 
life expectancy and elaborate on their response.
SETTING/SUBJECTS: Participants were hospice patients (n = 20, 55% male; 60% 
cancer).
MEASUREMENT: We conducted thematic analysis using open and focused coding.
RESULTS: Many participants had difficulty answering the life expectancy question 
and expressed uncertainty about when they would die. One-third overestimated 
their length of life relative to actual survival. The most common source of 
patients' prognostic beliefs was knowledge about their body, including physical 
symptoms and change over time. Half of patients reported that a provider had 
given them a prognostic estimate, and one-third agreed with, or gave estimates 
consistent with, the provider's estimate. Some patients said providers do not 
know prognosis or that time of death was unknowable.
CONCLUSIONS: Key findings were that 1) many hospice patients had difficulty 
estimating life expectancy, and 2) hospice patients' life expectancy estimates 
were frequently based on their body and not on information from medical 
providers. These findings have implications for measuring prognostic awareness, 
as valid assessment is a necessary component of determining whether prognostic 
awareness is beneficial for patients. Future research should examine how life 
expectancy estimates are associated with well-being and whether results extend 
to larger samples of patients with advanced disease not in hospice.

Unwarranted assumptions: Claude Bernard and the growth of the vera causa 
standard.

Scholl R(1).

Author information:

United Kingdom. Electronic address: ras223@cam.ac.uk.

The physiologist Claude Bernard was an important nineteenth-century 
methodologist of the life sciences. Here I place his thought in the context of 
the history of the vera causa standard, arguably the dominant epistemology of 
science in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Its proponents held 
that in order for a cause to be legitimately invoked in a scientific 
explanation, the cause must be shown by direct evidence to exist and to be 
competent to produce the effects ascribed to it. Historians of scientific method 
have argued that in the course of the nineteenth century the vera causa standard 
was superseded by a more powerful consequentialist epistemology, which also 
admitted indirect evidence for the existence and competence of causes. The prime 
example of this is the luminiferous ether, which was widely accepted, in the 
absence of direct evidence, because it entailed verified observational 
consequences and, in particular, successful novel predictions. According to the 
received view, the vera causa standard's demand for direct evidence of existence 
and competence came to be seen as an impracticable and needless restriction on 
the scope of legitimate inquiry into the fine structure of nature. The 
Mill-Whewell debate has been taken to exemplify this shift in scientific 
epistemology, with Whewell's consequentialism prevailing over Mill's defense of 
the older standard. However, Bernard's reflections on biological practice 
challenge the received view. His methodology marked a significant extension of 
the vera causa standard that made it both powerful and practicable. In 
particular, Bernard emphasized the importance of detection procedures in 
establishing the existence of unobservable entities. Moreover, his sophisticated 
notion of controlled experimentation permitted inferences about competence even 
in complex biological systems. In the life sciences, the vera causa standard 
began to flourish precisely around the time of its alleged abandonment.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most aggressive and frequently 
diagnosed malignancy of the liver. Despite aggressive therapy, life expectancy 
of many patients in these cases is extended by only a few months. Hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) has a particularly poor prognosis and would greatly benefit from 
more effective therapies.
METHODS: The CCK-8 assay and colony formation assays were used to test the cell 
proliferation and viability. The effects of combination Biochanin A and SB590885 
on apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of HCC cells were analysed by flow cytometry. 
The expression of ERK MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling as well as apoptosis and 
cell cycle-related proteins in HCC cells were tested by western blotting. The 
HCC cell xenograft model was established to test the tumor proliferation. Serum 
and plasma were tested for liver and kidney safety markers (ALP, ALT, AST, total 
bilirubin, creatinine, urea nitrogen) by using SpectraMax i3X.
RESULTS: The combination of natural product Biochanin A with the BRAF inhibitor 
SB590885 synergistically suppressed proliferation, and promoted cell cycle 
arrest and apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the combination 
of Biochanin A and SB590885 led to increased impairment of proliferation and HCC 
tumour inhibition through disrupting of the ERK MAPK and the PI3K/AKT pathways 
in vitro. The volumes tumors and the weights of tumours were significantly 
reduced by the combination treatment compared to the control or single 
treatments in vivo. In addition, we found that there was no significant 
hepatorenal toxicity with the drug combination, as indicated by the hepatorenal 
toxicity test.
CONCLUSION: The results identify an effective combination therapy for the most 
aggressive form of HCC and provide the possibility of therapeutic improvement 
for patients with advanced HCC.

progenitor cells.

Psoriasis is an autoimmune, chronic disease determined by environmental and 
genetic factors. The occurrence of psoriasis is accompanied by metabolic 
diseases, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and depression, disturbances on 
interpersonal interactions and a tendency towards social isolation. Regardless 
of the form of psoriasis and the severity of the disease, early arterial lesions 
are recorded in arterial vessels of patients. Nevertheless, the chance of CVD is 
higher in the population of patients with severe psoriasis than in patients with 
mild to moderate psoriasis. The correlation between the presence of 
atherosclerotic plaque and psoriatic plaque is partially explained by: (1) a 
similar inflammatory pathway - via the T helper cells, (2) impaired 
angiogenesis, and (3) endothelial dysfunction. In the considered tests, the 
diagnostic tools used showed a reduced level of endothelial progenitor cells in 
the circulation of patients with psoriasis. Endogenous angiopoietin stimulation 
in patients with psoriasis leads to deterioration of endothelial regeneration, 
atherosclerosis which secondarily contributes to the progression of heart 
failure. Clinical and experimental data confirm the potential of 
immunomodulatory methods to combat both autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases 
through the use of immunosuppressive drugs. Full understanding of the way in 
which CVD develops in patients with autoimmune diseases would enable the 
implementation of targeted cell therapy allowing the quality and life expectancy 
of patients to be improved. Modern cellular diagnostic tools allow the use of 
highly specific biomarkers, which in the near future will enable a reduction in 
morbidity and mortality due to CVD.

Due to antiretroviral therapy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients and 
non-HIV patients have a similar life expectancy. The leading cause of death 
among HIV patients is lung cancer. However, clinical toxicities with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors, including durvalumab, in HIV-positive patients with 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unknown. We report a 45-year-old 
Japanese HIV patient, who was safely treated with durvalumab consolidation 
therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for locally advanced NSCLC 
without significant toxicities until his disease progressed. This case 
demonstrates the safety of durvalu-mab consolidation therapy for HIV-positive 
patients after CCRT for locally advanced NSCLC.

OBJECTIVES: To review our two institutional experiences regarding the historical 
referral patterns of bladder cancer patients to receive radiation therapy, 
characteristics of these referred patients, and their treatment outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed analyzing patients who underwent 
radiation therapy for bladder cancer from 2005 to 2015 (n = 69) at two regional 
referral institutions. The age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (AACCI) was 
calculated for each patient. Patients were divided into three groups: definitive 
concurrent chemoradiation (CCR), aggressive radiation (AR) alone ≥ 50 Gy, or 
palliative radiation alone (PR) < 50 Gy. Gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary 
(GU) acute toxicities were recorded.
RESULTS: The median overall AACCI score was 7, which correlates to a two-year 
expected survival of 55% ± 11%. Thirty-five (50.7%) patients received CCR, 19 
(27.5%) received AR, and 15 (21.7%) received PR. Patients presented with 
hematuria (n = 43, 62%), pain (n = 18, 26%), or obstruction (n = 12, 17%). Of 
symptomatic patients, treatment improved hematuria in 86%, pain in 75%, and 
obstruction in 42%. Twenty-two recurrences (32%) were identified at follow-up. 
Local, regional, and distant recurrences developed in 20%, 14%, and 17% of 
patients who received CCR. There were two grade 3 GU toxicities and one grade 3 
GI toxicity; all grade 3 toxicities were in patients receiving CCR.
CONCLUSIONS: Bladder preservation is possible with chemoradiation therapy; 
however, urologists rarely refer patients for consideration of chemoradiation. 
The limited patients who are referred for radiation generally have limited life 
expectancy, significant comorbidities, or have advanced disease amenable only to 
palliation. Palliative radiation improves symptoms with minimal toxicity.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to provide evidence to policy makers on 
cost effectiveness and budget impact for the introduction of the etonorgestrel 
implant into the Indian public health system.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted to ascertain the potential costs 
and outcomes of adding the etonorgestrel implant to the public health system of 
India as compared to the current scenario. A decision analytical model (Markov 
cohort) was conceptualized from a societal perspective, where a hypothetical 
population of 15-year-old females was followed until menopause. The primary 
outcome was incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR). Sources for model inputs 
included country-level secondary data analysis, government reports, an 
observational primary costing study, a systematic review of etonorgestrel 
implant and targeted literature reviews. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses (OWSA and PSA) were performed to account for uncertainty. The impact of 
etonorgestrel implant introduction on the annual Indian health budget was also 
analysed.
RESULTS: The base-case ICUR was 16,475 Indian rupees (INR) (USD 232) per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained, which showed the etonorgestrel implant to be 
very cost effective (ICUR below willingness-to-pay threshold of INR 137,945 [USD 
1943]). OWSA showed that discount rate, percentage of people who do not use 
contraceptives and costs of managing side effects were the important parameters 
that affected ICUR. PSA showed that ICUR values of all 1000 Monte Carlo 
simulations were cost effective. Budget impact analysis showed that introduction 
of the implant would account for < 1% of the total annual health budget of 
India, even if acceptance of the implant varied between 0.2 and 4%.
CONCLUSION: Adding the etonorgestrel implant to the public health system would 
be cost effective for India, with a feasible budgetary allocation.

Plain Language Summary: Many women in India do not use methods to prevent 
pregnancy (contraception) despite not wanting to get pregnant, due to a number 
of reasons. As a result, a high number of pregnancies that are either unplanned 
or unwanted affect the health of these women and their families and in turn the 
economy of the country. The government of India wishes to increase the number of 
contraceptive choices so that more women could prevent unwanted pregnancies. One 
such method under consideration is ‘Implant’. It is a match-stick sized plastic 
rod that contains a medicine called Etonorgestrel that acts like a female 
hormone. This stick is placed under the skin of the arm of the woman and can be 
left there for three years to prevent pregnancy.Our study answers an important 
question as to whether introducing Etonorgestrel containing implant in the 
government’s family planning program would be good value for money and what 
would its impact be on the national annual health budget. To answer this 
question, we compiled evidence and simulated how introducing implant would 
affect health and costs.Our study showed that the introduction of Etonorgestrel 
containing implant into the Indian public health system would be good value for 
money. The cost to the government would be relatively low considering the extent 
of improvement in health. The expenditure to roll-out this contraceptive would 
amount to less than 1% of the annual health budget of India even if the use of 
the new method would vary between 0.2 to 4%.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Approximately 10% of total healthcare budgets worldwide are 
spent on treating diabetes and its complications, and budgets are increasing 
globally because of ageing populations and more expensive second-line 
medications. The aims of the study were to estimate the within-trial and 
lifetime cost-effectiveness of the weight management programme, which achieved 
46% remissions of type 2 diabetes at year 1 and 36% at year 2 in the Diabetes 
Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT).
METHODS: Within-trial analysis assessed costs of the Counterweight-Plus 
intervention in DiRECT (including training, programme materials, practitioner 
appointments and low-energy diet), along with glucose-lowering and 
antihypertensive medications, and all routine healthcare contacts. Lifetime cost 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was estimated according to projected 
durations of remissions, assuming continued relapse rates as seen in year 2 of 
DiRECT and consequent life expectancy, quality of life and healthcare costs.
RESULTS: Mean total 2 year healthcare costs for the intervention and control 
groups were £3036 and £2420, respectively: an incremental cost of £616 (95% CI 
-£45, £1269). Intervention costs (£1411; 95% CI £1308, £1511) were partially 
offset by lower other healthcare costs (£796; 95% CI £150, £1465), including 
reduced oral glucose-lowering medications by £231 (95% CI £148, £314). Net 
remission at 2 years was 32.3% (95% CI 23.5%, 40.3%), and cost per remission 
achieved was £1907 (lower 95% CI: intervention dominates; upper 95% CI: £4212). 
Over a lifetime horizon, the intervention was modelled to achieve a mean 0.06 
(95% CI 0.04, 0.09) QALY gain for the DiRECT population and mean total lifetime 
cost savings per participant of £1337 (95% CI £674, £2081), with the 
intervention becoming cost-saving within 6 years.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Incorporating the lifetime healthcare cost savings 
due to periods of remission from diabetes and its complications, the DiRECT 
intervention is predicted to be both more effective (QALY gain) and cost-saving 
in adults with type 2 diabetes compared with standard care. This conclusion 
appears robust to various less favourable model scenarios, providing strong 
evidence that resources could be shifted cost-effectively to support achieving 
remissions with the DiRECT intervention.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal autosomal recessive disease in the 
Caucasian population. A mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator 
protein (CFTR) gene leads to the production of abnormally viscous mucus and 
secretions in the lungs of these patients. A similar pathology also occurs in 
other organs. In the abdomen, among others the gastrointestinal tract, the 
pancreas, and the hepatobiliary system are affected. The involvement of the 
pancreas leads to its exocrine and endocrine insufficiency. Hepatic 
manifestations include hepatic steatosis, focal biliary and multilobular 
cirrhosis, and portal hypertension. Biliary complications include 
cholelithiasis, microgallbladder, and sclerosing cholangitis. In the 
gastrointestinal tract, complications such as the distal intestinal obstruction 
syndrome, invaginations, chronic constipation, wall thickening, and fibrosis in 
the colon may occur. An important renal manifestation is nephrolithiasis. With 
currently rapidly increasing life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis, 
complications of extrapulmonary cystic fibrosis manifestations including hepatic 
and gastrointestinal malignancy could be an increasing cause of morbidity and 
mortality of these patients. It is therefore important for radiologists to know 
and recognize these clinical patterns and to monitor these manifestations in 
follow-up exams. Previous therapy of extrapulmonary manifestations has been 
largely symptomatic. Fortunately, the new CFTR modulators seem to represent an 
effective causal therapeutic approach here.

AIM: Although it is known that geriatric syndrome is associated with the 
development of frailty, it is not known whether an amelioration of geriatric 
syndrome also improves shared risk factors and frailty.
METHODS: In total, 67 community-dwelling older people (79.6 ± 6.5 years, 49 
women) participated in this study (41 were classified as pre-frail and 26 as 
frail). We analyzed indices of physical frailty and cognitive depression, 
exercise tolerance and health-related quality of life as frailty related 
indices, and the participants completed a questionnaire regarding common 
geriatric symptoms (cold extremities, leg edema, breathlessness, urinary 
incontinence, chronic headache, chronic pain, a sense of numbness, anorexia, 
constipation, insomnia and skin trouble) using numeric ratings. Frailty was 
evaluated using the Japanese version of the Cardiovascular Health Study (J-CHS) 
criteria. The participants then underwent a far-infrared low-temperature sauna 
(FILTS) program twice a week for 3 months and the above parameters were 
reassessed.
RESULTS: After the FILTS program, there were significant differences in usual 
walking speed, peak oxygen uptake, Geriatric Depression Scale-15, health-related 
quality of life and the severity of several geriatric symptoms. Of the 67 
participants, 18 showed improvements in their J-CHS frailty score, 47 showed no 
change and two showed reductions. Linear regression analysis showed that the 
change in the numeric rating of the coldness of extremities (B = -0.105, P = 
0.013) and the cumulative numeric rating for geriatric syndromes (B = 0.044, 
P < 0.001) were independent determinants of the change in the J-CHS score.
CONCLUSIONS: A 3-month FILTS program ameliorates geriatric syndrome, the 
severity of frailty and frailty related indices in older Japanese people.

OBJECTIVE: Treatment decision-making for patients with laryngeal cancer consists 
of a complex trade-off between survival and quality of life. For decision makers 
on coverage and guidelines, costs come in addition to this equation. Our aim was 
to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of surgery (laryngectomy with or 
without radiotherapy) versus organ preservation (OP: radiotherapy, chemo- and/or 
bioradiation) in advanced laryngeal cancer patients from a healthcare 
perspective.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a Markov model. For 
each modality, data on survival and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 
sourced from relevant articles in agreement with experts, and national benchmark 
cost prices were included regarding treatment, follow-up, adverse events, and 
rehabilitation.
RESULTS: Total QALYs of the surgical approach (6.59) were substantially higher 
compared to the OP approach (5.44). Total lifetime costs were higher for the 
surgical approach compared to the OP approach, namely €95,881 versus €47,233. 
The surgical approach was therefore more effective and more costly compared to 
OP, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €42,383/QALY.
CONCLUSION: Based on current literature, surgical treatment was cost-effective 
compared to OP in advanced laryngeal cancer within most willingness-to-pay 
thresholds. The study provides information on the survival adjusted for quality 
of life in combination with costs of two different approaches for advanced 
laryngeal cancer, relevant for patients, physicians, and policy makers. As 
financial toxicity is a relevant aspect in this population, collection of 
real-world data on country-specific costs and utilities is strongly recommended 
to enable further generalization.

OBJECTIVE: To determine rates of watchful waiting (WW) vs treatment in prostate 
cancer (PCa) and limited life expectancy (LE) and assess determinants of 
management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with PCa between 2012 and 2018 with 
<10 years LE were identified from the Michigan Urologic Surgery Improvement 
Collaborative registry. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to 
identify factors associated with management choice among NCCN low-risk PCa 
patients. Data from high-volume practices were analyzed to understand practice 
variation.
RESULTS: Total 2393 patients were included. Overall, WW was performed in 8.1% 
compared to 23.3%, 25%, 11.2%, and 3.6% who underwent AS, radiation (XRT), 
prostatectomy (RP), and brachytherapy (BT), respectively. In men with NCCN 
low-risk disease (n = 358), WW was performed in 15.1%, compared to AS (69.3%), 
XRT (4.2%), RP (6.7%), and BT (2.5%). There was wide variation in management 
among practices in low-risk men; WW (6%-35%), AS (44%-81%), and definitive 
treatment (0%-30%). Older age was associated with less likelihood of undergoing 
AS vs WW (odds ratio [OR] 0.88, P < .001) or treatment vs WW (OR 0.83, P < 
.0001). Presence of ≥cT2 disease (OR 8.55, P = .014) and greater number of 
positive biopsy cores (OR 1.41, P = .014) was associated with greater likelihood 
of treatment vs WW and Charlson comorbidity score of 1 vs 0 (OR 0.23, P = .043) 
was associated with less likelihood of treatment vs WW.
CONCLUSION: Wide practice level variation exists in management for patients with 
low- and favorable-risk PCa and <10-year LE. Utilization of WW is poor, 
suggesting overtreatment in men who will experience little benefit.

CONTEXT: Many advanced patients with cancer have unrealistic prognostic 
expectations.
OBJECTIVES: We tested whether offering life expectancy (LE) statistics within 
palliative chemotherapy (PC) education promotes realistic expectations.
METHODS: In this multicenter trial, patients with advanced colorectal and 
pancreatic cancers initiating first or second line PC were randomized to usual 
care versus a PC educational tool with optional LE information. Surveys at 
two weeks and three months assessed patients' review of the LE module and their 
reactions; at three months, patients estimated their LE and reported occurrence 
of prognosis and end-of-life (EOL) discussions. Wilcoxon tests and proportional 
odds models evaluated between-arm differences in LE self-estimates, and how 
realistic those estimates were (based on cancer type and line of treatment).
RESULTS: From 2015 to 2017, 92 patients were randomized to the intervention and 
94 to usual care. At baseline most patients (80.9%) wanted "a lot" or "as much 
information as possible" about the impact of chemotherapy on LE. Among patients 
randomized to the intervention, 52.0% reviewed the LE module by two weeks and 
66.7% by three months-of whom 88.2% reported the information was important, 
31.4% reported it was upsetting, and 3.9% regretted reviewing it. Overall, 
patients' LE self-estimates were very optimistic; 71.4% of patients with 
colorectal cancer estimated greater than five years; 50% pancreatic patients 
estimated greater than two years. The intervention had no effect on the length 
or realism of patients' LE self-estimates, or on the occurrence of prognostic or 
EOL discussions.
CONCLUSIONS: Offering LE information within a PC educational intervention had no 
effect on patients' prognostic expectations.

CONTEXT: In palliative care, caregivers often lack words and competences to 
discuss patients' needs in social and spiritual dimensions. The Utrecht Symptom 
Diary-4 Dimensional (USD-4D) is an instrument that can be used to monitor 
symptoms and needs in the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual 
dimensions and to optimize communication between patients and caregivers.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the content validity of the USD-4D items related to the 
social and spiritual dimensions from a patient's perspective, measured in terms 
of comprehensibility, relevance, and comprehensiveness.
METHODS: An explorative qualitative study was conducted using in-depth 
semistructured interviews and thematic analysis. Twelve participants (male 
N = 7, 53-87 years old) with an estimated life expectancy of less than one year 
were recruited in two home care services: a general hospital and a hospice.
RESULTS: The instructions, items, and response options were comprehensible for 
almost all participants. The meaning that was provided to the items was 
expressed in themes: maintaining personal identity and autonomy, resilience, 
letting go, perceived balance in one's life, and death and afterlife. This 
corresponds with the intended meaning. The items were relevant at some points in 
time. Not all participants had needs for personal care during the interviews. 
Participants found the USD-4D comprehensive, no key concepts related to the 
social or spiritual dimensions appeared to be missing.
CONCLUSIONS: The USD-4D constitutes a content valid PROM from the patient's 
perspective. The items support patients in identifying needs in the social and 
spiritual dimensions and in the conversation to further explore these needs.

BACKGROUND: Scientific publications are meant to exchange knowledge among 
researchers but the inability to properly reproduce computational experiments 
limits the quality of scientific research. Furthermore, bibliography shows that 
irreproducible preclinical research exceeds 50%, which produces a huge waste of 
resources on nonprofitable research at Life Sciences field. As a consequence, 
scientific reproducibility is being fostered to promote Open Science through 
open databases and software tools that are typically deployed on existing 
computational resources. However, some computational experiments require complex 
virtual infrastructures, such as elastic clusters of PCs, that can be 
dynamically provided from multiple clouds. Obtaining these infrastructures 
requires not only an infrastructure provider, but also advanced knowledge in the 
cloud computing field.
OBJECTIVES: The main aim of this paper is to improve reproducibility in life 
sciences to produce better and more cost-effective research. For that purpose, 
our intention is to simplify the infrastructure usage and deployment for 
researchers.
METHODS: This paper introduces Advanced Platform for Reproducible 
Infrastructures in the Cloud via Open Tools (APRICOT), an open source extension 
for Jupyter to deploy deterministic virtual infrastructures across multiclouds 
for reproducible scientific computational experiments. To exemplify its 
utilization and how APRICOT can improve the reproduction of experiments with 
complex computation requirements, two examples in the field of life sciences are 
provided. All requirements to reproduce both experiments are disclosed within 
APRICOT and, therefore, can be reproduced by the users.
