PURPOSE: Tumor molecular analyses in endometrial cancer (EC) includes 4 distinct 
subtypes: (1) POLE-mutated, (2) mismatch repair protein (MMR) deficient, (3) p53 
mutant, and (4) no specific molecular profile. Recently, a sub-analysis of 
PORTEC-3 demonstrated notable differences in treatment response between 
molecular classification (MC) groups. Cost of testing is one barrier to 
widespread adoption of MC. Therefore, we sought to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of MC in patients with stage I and II high-risk EC.
METHODS: A Markov decision model was developed to compare tumor molecular 
classification (TMC) vs. no testing (NT). A healthcare payor's perspective and 
5-year time horizon were used. Base case data were abstracted from PORTEC-3 and 
the molecular sub-analysis. Cost and utility data were derived from public 
databases, peer-reviewed literature, and expert input. Strategies were compared 
using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with effectiveness in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and evaluated with a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed to 
test model robustness.
RESULTS: When compared to NT, TMC was cost effective with an ICER of $25,578 per 
QALY gained; incremental cost was $1780 and incremental effectiveness was 0.070 
QALYs. In one-way sensitivity analyses, results were most sensitive to the cost 
of POLE testing, but TMC remained cost-effective over all parameter ranges.
CONCLUSIONS: TMC in early-stage high-risk EC is cost-effective, and the model 
results were robust over a range of parameters. Given that MC can be used to 
guide adjuvant treatment decisions, these findings support adoption of TMC into 
routine practice.

There are no studies assessing the epidemiology and burden of decubitus ulcers 
at global, regional, and national levels. We aim to report this issue from 1990 
to 2019 by extracting data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019 
and stratifying it by age, gender, and socio-demographic index (SDI). Globally, 
the number of prevalent cases of decubitus ulcers in 2019 is 0.85 (95% UI 0.78 
to 0.94) million. The age-standardized rates of prevalence, incidence, and years 
lived with disability (YLDs) in 2019 are 11.3 (95% UI 10.2 to 12.5), 41.8 (37.8 
to 46.2), and 1.7 (1.2 to 2.2) per 100,000 population, and compared with 1990, 
it has decreased by 10.6% (95% UI 8.7% to 12.3%), 10.2% (8.2 to 11.9%), and 
10.4% (8.1 to 12.5%), respectively. In addition, the global prevalence rate of 
decubitus ulcers increases with age, peaking at the > 95 age group among men and 
women. At the regional and national levels, we observe a positive correlation 
between age-standardized YLDs and SDI. Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand 
experienced the most significant increases in age-standardized prevalence rates 
at the national level. Finally, we concluded that the age-standardized 
prevalence, incidence, and YLDs rates of decubitus ulcer declined from 1990 to 
2019, with significant regional differences. In order to monitor the dynamic 
changes of decubitus ulcers burden, it is recommended to improve the quality of 
decubitus ulcer health data in all regions and countries.

The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can utilize polyamines 
(including putrescine, cadaverine, 4-aminobutyrate, spermidine, and spermine) as 
its sole source of carbon and nitrogen. Spermidine dehydrogenase (SpdH) is a 
component of one of the two polyamine utilization pathways identified in 
P. aeruginosa, but little is known about its structure and function. Here, we 
report the first crystal structure of SpdH from P. aeruginosa to 1.85 Å 
resolution. The resulting core structure confirms that SpdH belongs to the 
polyamine oxidase (PAO) family with flavin-binding and substrate-binding 
domains. A unique N-terminal extension wraps around the flavin-binding domain of 
SpdH and is required for heme binding, placing a heme cofactor in close 
proximity to the FAD cofactor. Structural and mutational analysis reveals that 
residues in the putative active site at the re side of the FAD isoalloxazine 
ring form part of the catalytic machinery. PaSpdH features an unusual active 
site and lacks the conserved lysine that forms part of a lysine-water-flavin N5 
atom interaction in other PAO enzymes characterized to date. Mutational analysis 
further confirms that heme is required for catalytic activity. This work 
provides an important starting point for understanding the role of SpdH, which 
occurs universally in P. aeruginosa strains, in polyamine metabolism.

PURPOSE: Spinal sagittal balance is associated with back pain and quality of 
life. Enhancing understanding of the clinical factors associated with sagittal 
balance is essential for guiding the development of effective non-operative 
treatment. We aimed to evaluate the associations between spinal sagittal balance 
and potentially modifiable clinical factors and interactions between current 
back pain and the evaluated clinical factors.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study where sagittal alignment, measured 
radiographically by EOS, was defined by sagittal vertical axis (SVA). The 
clinical factors included non-radiographic (NR) lumbar lordosis angle, balance 
(Berg balance scale), hip and back extension range of motion (ROM) and extensor 
strength, and back pain. Pearson's correlation coefficients and multivariable 
regression analyses were conducted in 63 adult participants (70% female, mean 
age 73 (SD 8.6) years) from the general population.
RESULTS: We identified correlations between SVA and age (r = 0.4, p < 0.001), 
body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.3, p = 0.008), balance (r = - 0.5, p < 0.001) and 
NR lumbar lordosis angle (r = - 0.5, p < 0.001). The final model (R2 = 58%) 
identified that, after controlling for age and BMI, larger SVA was associated 
with lower NR lumbar lordosis (R2 = 15%, p < 0.001), poorer balance (R2 = 7%, 
p = 0.02), greater hip extensor strength (R2 = 4%, p = 0.053), and among people 
with back pain, NR lumbar extension ROM (R2 = 3%, p = 0.034). Hip ROM and lumbar 
strength were not significant.
CONCLUSION: Reduced NR lumbar lordosis magnitude and ROM, balance and hip 
strength are associated with SVA; however, it is unclear if these factors are 
compensatory, contributing, or modifiable. Hence, future longitudinal studies 
are needed.

Background Prior studies showed that life expectancy in patients who underwent 
surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) was lower than in the general 
population. Explanations for this shorter life expectancy are unknown. The aim 
of this nationwide, observational cohort study was to investigate the 
cause-specific death following surgical AVR. Methods and Results We included 
33 018 patients who underwent primary surgical AVR in Sweden between 1997 and 
2018, with or without coronary artery bypass grafting. The SWEDEHEART (Swedish 
Web-System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart 
Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) register and other 
national health-data registers were used to obtain and characterize the study 
cohort and to identify causes of death, categorized as cardiovascular mortality, 
cancer mortality, or other causes of death. The relative risks for 
cause-specific mortality in patients who underwent AVR compared with the general 
population are presented as standardized mortality ratios. During a mean 
follow-up period of 7.3 years (maximum 22.0 years), 14 237 (43%) patients died. 
The cumulative incidence of death from cardiovascular, cancer-related, or other 
causes was 23.5%, 8.3%, and 11.6%, respectively, at 10 years, and 42.8%, 12.8%, 
and 23.8%, respectively, at 20 years. Standardized mortality ratios for 
cardiovascular, cancer-related, and other causes of death were 1.79 (95% CI, 
1.75-1.83), 1.00 (95% CI, 0.97-1.04), and 1.08 (95% CI, 1.05-1.12), 
respectively. Conclusions We found that life expectancy following AVR was lower 
than in the general population. Lower survival after AVR was explained by an 
increased relative risk of cardiovascular death. Future studies should focus on 
the role of earlier surgery in patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis and on 
optimizing treatment and follow-up after AVR. Registration URL:

PURPOSE: To explore the physical activity level of community environmental 
volunteering (CEV) participants and the differences in physical functions and 
daily activity patterns between the older adults who engaged in intensive CEV 
(≥15 hours/week) and non-intensive CEV (<15 hours/week) groups.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Three recycling stations in Taiwan.
SAMPLE: In total, 113 community-dwelling older adults who regularly participated 
in CEV. The response rate was 53%.
MEASURES: The ActiGraph wGT3x-BT accelerometer for the percentage of sedentary, 
light, and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) of CEV time and awaken 
time; the Jamar hand dynamometer for grip strength; and the MicroFET3 muscle 
testing dynamometer for knee extension strength.
ANALYSIS: Analysis of covariance with the baseline characteristics as 
covariates.
RESULTS: Overall, MVPA, light, and sedentary activities accounted for 53.73%, 
41.10%, and 5.23% of CEV time, respectively. The intensive group (n = 61) 
displayed greater dominant handgrip strength (P = .004) and higher MVPA 
percentage in daily life (P = .044) than the non-intensive group (n = 52).
CONCLUSION: CEV provides sufficient opportunities for older adults to perform 
physical activity. Intensive CEV is related to greater handgrip strength but not 
lower limb strength. Further study is needed to establish the causal 
relationship between CEV and health variates.

Identifying ways to deal with the challenges presented by aging is an urgent 
task, as we are facing an aging society. External factors such as diet, exercise 
and drug therapy have proven to be major elements in controlling healthy aging 
and prolonging life expectancy. More recently, the intestinal microbiota has 
also become a key factor in the anti-aging process. As the intestinal microbiota 
changes with aging, an imbalance in intestinal microorganisms can lead to many 
age-related degenerative diseases and unhealthy aging. This paper reviews recent 
research progress on the relationship between intestinal microorganisms and 
anti-aging effects, focusing on the changes and beneficial effects of intestinal 
microorganisms under dietary intervention, exercise and drug intervention. In 
addition, bacteriotherapy has been used to prevent frailty and unhealthy aging. 
Most of these anti-aging approaches improve the aging process and age-related 
diseases by regulating the homeostasis of intestinal flora and promoting a 
healthy intestinal environment. Intervention practices based on intestinal 
microorganisms show great potential in the field of anti-aging medicine.

Vermicomposting eco-friendly converts lignocellulosic wastes into bio-organic 
fertilizer. Cellulose is the most abundant carbohydrate in lignocellulose. 
Glycoside hydrolase family 6 (GH6) plays a key role in the early step of 
cellulose degradation, which is essential for stabilizing lignocellulose. This 
study intends to quantify the abundance of GH6 gene and to clarify the 
succession of GH6 cellulase-producing microbial communities during 
vermicomposting. 100% of maize stover (A) and maize stover and cow dung at 60:40 
ratio (B) were used. The results showed that different native genera were 
observed in the starting materials. Cellulomonas and Cellulosimicrobium were 
dominant genera harboring GH6 gene. The peak relative abundance of Cellulomonas 
was 76% and 30% in B and A during vermicomposting phase, and the corresponding 
values of Cellulosimicrobium was 36% and 37%. Earthworms increased the abundance 
of GH6 gene, which reached 1.51E + 09 from 3.46E + 08 copies/g in B. The results 
partially interpreted promoting effect of earthworms.

In this paper, we measure the effect of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic wave at the 
national and subnational levels in selected Latin American countries that were 
most affected: Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru. We used 
publicly available monthly mortality data to measure the impacts of the pandemic 
using excess mortality for each country and its regions. We compare the 
mortality, at national and regional levels, in 2020 to the mortality levels of 
recent trends and provide estimates of the impact of mortality on life 
expectancy at birth. Our findings indicate that from April 2020 on, mortality 
exceeded its usual monthly levels in multiple areas of each country. In Mexico 
and Peru, excess mortality was spreading through many areas by the end of the 
second half of 2020. To a lesser extent, we observed a similar pattern in 
Brazil, Chile, and Ecuador. We also found that as the pandemic progressed, 
excess mortality became more visible in areas with poorer socioeconomic and 
sanitary conditions. This excess mortality has reduced life expectancy across 
these countries by 2-10 years. Despite the lack of reliable information on 
COVID-19 mortality, excess mortality is a useful indicator for measuring the 
effects of the coronavirus pandemic, especially in the context of Latin American 
countries, where there is still a lack of good information on causes of death in 
their vital registration systems.

While Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) has numerous potential benefits to smallholder 
farmers in the Eastern Gangetic Plains of South Asia, it's out-scaling has been 
limited by both a lack of demand by farmers and limited supply of DSR services 
by machinery owners. This contrasts with the comparatively more rapid scaling of 
zero tillage wheat in the region. This trend is yet to be fully explored, 
particularly when focus has been placed almost exclusively on understanding DSR 
adoption though the lens of farm-level agronomic, economic and environmental 
performance. Given that limited DSR service provision is likely to be governed 
outside of these considerations, this study explores with zero tillage drill 
owners the decision processes they apply in deciding how to use their zero 
tillage drills. Respondents highlight a complex web of interrelated 
considerations that highlight the additional complexities of DSR as compared to 
existing practices. Using a novel 'Decision-making Dartboard' qualitative 
framework, these complexities are unpacked and a set of potential changes to the 
assumed theory of change for DSR scaling are identified, including 
considerations for selection of potential DSR service providers and 
responsibilities for promotion and extension of DSR to overcome the prevalent 
negative perceptions of DSR held broadly across the communities explored. The 
proposed framework and analysis process are also potentially useful for 
exploration of other farmer decision making processes more broadly.

Demographic Development of Russia in the 20th‒21st Centuries: Historical and 
Geopolitical Dimensions.

Features of demographic development in Russia from the 1940s to 2020 are 
retrospectively considered. The stages of the country's demographic development 
are analyzed, including the contribution of various components to the 
demographic dynamics in certain historical periods. The idea of distinguishing 
two waves of depopulation is proposed, and it is argued that the second wave of 
depopulation in Russia is provoked not only by negative modern trends, but is 
also associated with the historical features of the demographic development of 
the country, namely, with the age structure of the population, deformed under 
the influence of various historical events, or with "demographic pitfalls," 
often referred to in the literature. The contribution of supermortality to 
depopulation in the 1990s, called the shock stage of Russia's demographic 
development, is highlighted. The features of the second wave of depopulation are 
noted, which are associated with a decrease in the number of women of 
reproductive age and a new round of increase in mortality due to COVID-19. A 
systematic approach to neutralizing the second wave of depopulation is 
substantiated on the basis of a comprehensive national demographic program, 
including a system of measures to create conditions for the birth and upbringing 
of children, support families with children, develop self-preserving behavior, 
reduce mortality, increase life expectancy, reduce emigration, and attract 
migrants of the necessary categories to Russia.

Approaches to assessing the role of health care in reducing mortality in Russia 
from the standpoint of controlling manageable causes are discussed. Based on the 
concept of avoidable mortality, trends in regional variability of mortality, the 
nosological and gender characteristics for the years 2000-2019 have been 
analyzed. The patterns revealed indicate the following: a significant 
contribution of medicine and health care to the decrease in the premature 
reduction in the life expectancy of the population, the expediency of developing 
a regional classification of the list of avoidable causes of mortality, and the 
decisive role of prevention and the improvement of the lifestyle of the 
population of young and middle ages in the past two decades against the 
background of a slow increase in the capacity of clinical medicine in the 
diagnostics and treatment of diseases.

Russia is one of the demographically old countries of the world. The process of 
demographic aging in our country has a number of specific features associated 
with a change in the age structure of the population, which are determined by 
the second stage of depopulation; a significant lag in life expectancy 
indicators not only from economically developed but also from some developing 
countries; demographic asymmetry by gender; and rather low indicators of healthy 
life expectancy, which are calculated without accounting for the gender 
component, and with the burden of diseases dictated by age and accumulated 
before the age of 65. The current situation increases the relevance of the 
search for an effective way out of the process of demographic aging, based on 
strategic approaches to the formation of public health throughout the entire 
life cycle of a person, including representatives of older age groups.

Neuromodulation is present throughout the nervous system and serves a critical 
role for circuit function and dynamics. The computational investigations of 
neuromodulation in large scale networks require supportive software platforms. 
Snudda is a software for the creation and simulation of large scale networks of 
detailed microcircuits consisting of multicompartmental neuron models. We have 
developed an extension to Snudda to incorporate neuromodulation in large scale 
simulations. The extended Snudda framework implements neuromodulation at the 
level of single cells incorporated into large-scale microcircuits. We also 
developed Neuromodcell, a software for optimizing neuromodulation in detailed 
multicompartmental neuron models. The software adds parameters within the models 
modulating the conductances of ion channels and ionotropic receptors. Bath 
application of neuromodulators is simulated and models which reproduce the 
experimentally measured effects are selected. In Snudda, we developed an 
extension to accommodate large scale simulations of neuromodulation. The 
simulator has two modes of simulation - denoted replay and adaptive. In the 
replay mode, transient levels of neuromodulators can be defined as a 
time-varying function which modulates the receptors and ion channels within the 
network in a cell-type specific manner. In the adaptive mode, spiking 
neuromodulatory neurons are connected via integrative modulating mechanisms to 
ion channels and receptors. Both modes of simulating neuromodulation allow for 
simultaneous modulation by several neuromodulators that can interact dynamically 
with each other. Here, we used the Neuromodcell software to simulate 
dopaminergic and muscarinic modulation of neurons from the striatum. We also 
demonstrate how to simulate different neuromodulatory states with dopamine and 
acetylcholine using Snudda. All software is freely available on Github, 
including tutorials on Neuromodcell and Snudda-neuromodulation.

Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Peking University Cancer 
Hospital and Institute, Beijing, China.

Purpose: Death anxiety is commonly experienced by individuals with advanced 
cancer who have a limited life expectancy. The Death and Dying Distress Scale 
(DADDS) is a validated measure that was created to capture this experience; but 
no Chinese version is available to date. We conducted a cross-sectional study to 
explore the psychometric properties of a Chinese version DADDS (DADDS-C) and 
address prevalence of death anxiety among patients with advanced cancer. 
Methods: Patients with advanced cancer were recruited from Peking University 
Cancer Hospital. Measures administered included: DADDS-C, Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder-7(GAD-7), Quality of Life at End 
of Life in Cancer (QUAL-EC), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness 
Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being Scale (FACIT-sp). McDonald's Omega, Cronbach's 
alpha, Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis were used to 
test DADDS-C's reliability and validity. Logistic regression analysis was used 
to identify risk factors for death anxiety. Results: Of 300 patients approached, 
256 (85%) provided informed consent and completed the questionnaires. Of these 
participants, 43 (16.8%) had moderate death anxiety based on scores of ≥45 on 
the DADDS-C. Three factors (feeling shortness of time, dying and death distress, 
being a burden to others) explained 71.643% of shared variation with factor 
loadings ranging from 0.629 to 0.822. Cronbach's alpha was 0.939; Omega total 
was 0.959. DADDS-C had acceptable convergent and discriminant validity. Logistic 
regression analysis indicated that two factors (better relationship with 
healthcare providers and preparation for end of life) protected patients from 
death anxiety. Conclusion: DADDS-C is a valid tool for measuring death anxiety 
in Chinese patients with advanced cancer. The presence of at least moderate 
death anxiety in a substantial minority of these patients calls for screening 
for this symptom and for more routine psychological interventions to alleviate 
and prevent such distress in this population.

Background: Exposure to 2.5-micron diameter air pollutants (PM 2.5) has been 
associated with an increased risk of illness and death worldwide; however, in 
Latin American health impacts assessment of this risk factor is scarce. Medellín 
is one of the most polluted cities in the region, with a population growth rate 
that is twice as high as that of other Colombian cities, which implies a growing 
population at risk. Methods: A descriptive study of the disease burden was 
carried out using the city as the unit of observation. Health events were 
selected based on epidemiologic evidence and the availability of the population 
attributable fraction associated with PM 2.5. The mortality records were taken 
from the module of deceased of the Single Registry of Affiliates of the Health 
System; the morbidity records were taken from the Individual Health Services 
Registries. For the estimation of the burden of disease, the current Global 
Burden of Disease guidelines were followed. Results: Attributable 
disability-adjusted life years to exposure to ambient PM 2.5 pollution (DALYs 
PM2.5) constituted 13.8% of total burden of the city. Males showed the greatest 
loss of DALYs PM2.5 due to acute events, while in women the greatest loss was 
due to chronic events. Ischemic heart disease, chronic diseases of the lower 
respiratory tract, and influenza and pneumonia were the events that contributed 
the most to DALYs PM2.5. 71.4% of the DALYs PM2.5 corresponded to mortality, 
mainly in the population over 65 years of age. Regarding attributable morbidity, 
acute events were more prevalent in both sexes, especially due to respiratory 
diseases Conclusion: Premature death among the elderly population has the 
greatest weight on burden of disease attributable to ambient PM 2.5 pollution, 
mainly due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, without significant 
differences according to gender.

The increased life expectancy for patients with Down Syndrome (DS) has elicited 
the need to improve their quality of life by enhancing functional outcomes and 
identifying the factors that contribute to their long-term cognitive decline. 
Although the majority of individuals with DS have issues with hearing impairment 
(HI) since early childhood, to our knowledge no study has investigated whether 
HI represents a potential modulator of cognitive decline over time. The present 
explorative cohort study, albeit very preliminary due to the limited cohort (17 
children), highlights the significant relation of a significant HI not only with 
receptive language abilities, but also with mental age in young patients with 
DS. Additional studies are required to confirm the link between HI and mental 
age and to assess the impact of audiological treatment on the enhancement of 
functional outcomes and of cognitive decline in individuals with DS.

Background: Schizophrenia is a severe and complex disease with substantial 
economic and social burdens. Despite multiple treatment choices, adverse events, 
and impaired social functions are still challenges in clinical therapy. 
Pharmacoeconomic evaluations could provide evidence to help decision makers 
improve the utilization of scarce resources. However, there remains some 
challenges especially in modeling due to uncertainties in progression of 
schizophrenia. There are limited summaries about the overall methodologies of 
schizophrenia economic evaluations. Objective: The aim of this study is to 
review the existing economic evaluations of antipsychotics for the treatment of 
schizophrenia and summarize the evidence and methods applied. Methods: An 
electronic literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO 
host, The Cochrane Library and ScienceDirect from January 2014 to December 2020. 
Search terms included "schizophrenia," "schizophrenic," "pharmacoeconomic," 
"economic evaluation," "cost-effectiveness," and "cost-utility." The Literature 
was screened and extracted by two researchers independently and assessed with 
the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) List and Consolidated Health 
Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) Statement. Results: A total of 
25 studies were included in the review. The regions included Europe, North 
America, Asia and Africa. Most of the studies chose second-generation 
antipsychotics as comparators and integrated treatment sequences. Time horizons 
varied from 1 year to lifetime. The healthcare sector was the most common 
perspective, accordingly, most of the evaluations considered only direct medical 
costs. The Markov model and decision tree model were the most common choices. 
Adverse events, compliance and persistence were considered important parameters. 
Quality-adjusted life-years were the major outcomes applied to the economic 
evaluations. All utilities for health states and adverse events were collected 
from published literature. All of the studies applied uncertainty analysis to 
explore the robustness of the results. The quality of the studies was generally 
satisfactory. However, improvements were needed in the choice of time horizons, 
the measurements of outcomes and the descriptions of assumptions. Conclusions: 
This study highlights the methodology of economic evaluation of schizophrenia. 
Recommendations for modeling method and future study are provided.

Background: More than 1 year after the beginning of the international spread of 
coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), the reasons explaining its apparently lower 
reported burden in Africa are still to be fully elucidated. Few studies 
previously investigated the potential reasons explaining this epidemiological 
observation using data at the level of a few African countries. However, an 
updated analysis considering the various epidemiological waves and variables 
across an array of categories, with a focus on African countries might help to 
better understand the COVID-19 pandemic on the continent. Thus, we investigated 
the potential reasons for the persistently lower transmission and mortality 
rates of COVID-19 in Africa. Methods: Data were collected from publicly 
available and well-known online sources. The cumulative numbers of COVID-19 
cases and deaths per 1 million population reported by the African countries up 
to February 2021 were used to estimate the transmission and mortality rates of 
COVID-19, respectively. The covariates were collected across several data 
sources: clinical/diseases data, health system performance, demographic 
parameters, economic indicators, climatic, pollution, and radiation variables, 
and use of social media. The collinearities were corrected using variance 
inflation factor (VIF) and selected variables were fitted to a multiple 
regression model using the R statistical package. Results: Our model (adjusted 
R-squared: 0.7) found that the number of COVID-19 tests per 1 million 
population, GINI index, global health security (GHS) index, and mean body mass 
index (BMI) were significantly associated (P < 0.05) with COVID-19 cases per 1 
million population. No association was found between the median life expectancy, 
the proportion of the rural population, and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) 
coverage rate. On the other hand, diabetes prevalence, number of nurses, and GHS 
index were found to be significantly associated with COVID-19 deaths per 1 
million population (adjusted R-squared of 0.5). Moreover, the median life 
expectancy and lower respiratory infections rate showed a trend towards 
significance. No association was found with the BCG coverage or communicable 
disease burden. Conclusions: Low health system capacity, together with some 
clinical and socio-economic factors were the predictors of the reported burden 
of COVID-19 in Africa. Our results emphasize the need for Africa to strengthen 
its overall health system capacity to efficiently detect and respond to public 
health crises.

Introduction: Due to the enhanced awareness of consumers concerning healthy 
foods, homemade expeller-pressed oils have become popular worldwide. However, an 
extended storage period may lead to oxidization of the oil and exposure to 
hazardous byproducts by consumers. Methods: In this study, 10 pressed oil 
samples prepared from common oilseeds using a small-scale expeller oil press 
were analyzed by OXITEST with a sample amount of 5 g of oil and an oxygen 
pressure of 800 kPa under accelerated conditions for shelf-life projections. The 
oil properties were investigated, including the recovery, smoke point, acid 
value, iodine value, "fatty acid composition, and contents of pigments and 
tocopherols". Results: The autoxidation reaction of various expeller-pressed 
oils under an accelerated testing system followed zero-order Arrhenius kinetics 
(R 2 > 0.99). Shelf-lives of the pressed oils at 25°C were estimated by 
extrapolation to range 105~1,089 days. The obtained shelf-lives were 
significantly correlated with log induction period (IP) values (r > 0.81, p < 
0.05) and unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) (r < -0.69, p < 0.05), but not with the 
iodine value, acid value, or smoke point. Scatter diagrams between shelf-lives 
and UFAs suggested that these pressed oils could be grouped by two linear 
regression curves (r > 0.98, p < 0.05). The predictive equations using multiple 
linear regression are presented herein, with predictor variables of UFAs and an 
unspecified item involving potential influencing factors such as tocopherol 
contents (r > 0.88, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings first revealed that the 
UFA portion was partially correlated with the shelf-lives of selected 
expeller-pressed seed oils as estimated by the OXITEST. The derived equations 
can be applied for shelf-life predictions of expeller-pressed oils stored under 
dark ambient conditions based on the fatty acid profile.
