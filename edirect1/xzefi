BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia (SCZ) has a global prevalence of 1% and increases the 
risk of mortality, reducing life expectancy. There is growing evidence that the 
risk of this disorder is higher in males than in females and it tends to develop 
in early adulthood. The Y chromosome is thought to be involved in biological 
processes other than sex determination and spermatogenesis. Studies have shown 
that loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in peripheral blood cells is associated with a 
variety of diseases (including cancer) and increased all-cause mortality. An 
analysis of the relationship between LOY and schizophrenia is warranted.
METHODS: A total of 442 Chinese males (271 patients with schizophrenia vs. 171 
controls) were included in this study. The copy numbers of the Y and X 
chromosomes were detected by positive droplets targeting the amelogenin gene 
(AMEL) on the Y chromosome and X chromosome (AMELY and AMELX, respectively), 
using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The LOY percentage was defined as the 
difference between the concentration of AMELX and the concentration of AMELY 
divided by the concentration of AMELX, denoted as (X - Y)/X.
RESULTS: In the Han Chinese population, the LOY percentage was higher in the 
schizophrenia group than in the control group (p < 0.05), although there was no 
significant difference in the presence of LOY between the two groups. A strong 
correlation was found between the average of the disease duration and the 
average of the LOY percentage (R2 = 0.506, p = 0.032). The logistic regression 
analysis implied that the risk of LOY increases by 0.058 and 0.057 per year 
according to age at onset and duration of disease, respectively (ponset = 0.013, 
pduration = 0.017).
CONCLUSIONS: In the Han Chinese population, the LOY percentage of the disease 
group was significantly different from that of the control group. The age of 
onset and duration of schizophrenia might be risk factors for LOY in peripheral 
blood cells. A larger sample size and expanded clinical information are needed 
for more in-depth and specific analyses.

Lung cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in the world, and 
surgery is an integral part of the treatment for spinal metastases. The aims of 
this retrospective study were to assess the overall survival of surgically 
treated patients affected by lung cancer spinal metastases and identify any 
factors related to a better survival rate. We recruited 56 consecutive patients 
(34 male and 22 female) surgically treated for metastatic lung cancer in the 
spine from 2009 to 2019. Surgical indications were based on a previously 
published and validated flow chart following a multidisciplinary evaluation. We 
assessed the localization of vertebral metastases, the presence of other bone or 
visceral metastases, neurological status according to the Frankel score, 
ambulatory autonomy, and general status, measured with the Karnofsky performance 
scale. The expected prognosis was retrospectively assessed according to the 
revised Tokuhashi score. The median survival was 8.1 months, with over a third 
of patients surviving more than 1 year. We observed a global improvement in all 
clinical parameters after surgical treatment. The Tokuhashi predictive score did 
not correlate with survival after surgery. The results of this study suggest 
that the surgical treatment of symptomatic spinal metastases from lung cancer 
can improve quality of life, even in patients with a shorter life expectancy, by 
controlling pain and improving autonomy.

Glioblastoma is the most aggressive form of brain tumor originating from glial 
cells with a maximum life expectancy of 14.6 months. Despite the establishment 
of multiple promising therapies, the clinical outcome of glioblastoma patients 
is abysmal. Drug resistance has been identified as a major factor contributing 
to the failure of current multimodal therapy. Epigenetic modification, 
especially DNA methylation has been identified as a major regulatory mechanism 
behind glioblastoma progression. In addition, miRNAs, a class of non-coding RNA, 
have been found to play a role in the regulation as well as in the diagnosis of 
glioblastoma. The relationship between epigenetics, drug resistance, and 
glioblastoma progression has been clearly demonstrated. MGMT hypermethylation, 
leading to a lack of MGMT expression, is associated with a cytotoxic effect of 
TMZ in GBM, while resistance to TMZ frequently appears in MGMT non-methylated 
GBM. In this review, we will elaborate on known miRNAs linked to glioblastoma; 
their distinctive oncogenic or tumor suppressor roles; and how epigenetic 
modification of miRNAs, particularly via methylation, leads to their 
upregulation or downregulation in glioblastoma. Moreover, we will try to 
identify those miRNAs that might be potential regulators of MGMT expression and 
their role as predictors of tumor response to temozolomide treatment. Although 
we do not impact clinical data and survival, we open possible experimental 
approaches to treat GBM, although they should be further validated with 
clinically oriented studies.

Progress in the field of muscular dystrophy (MD) using a multidisciplinary 
approach based on international standards of care has led to a significant 
increase in the life expectancy of patients. The challenge of transitioning from 
pediatric to adult healthcare has been acknowledged for over a decade, yet it 
continues to be a last-minute concern. Currently, there is no established 
consensus on how to evaluate the effectiveness of the transition process. Our 
study aimed to identify how well patients are prepared for the transition and to 
determine their needs. We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study on 15 
patients aged 14 to 21 years. The patients completed a sociodemographic and a 
Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ). We also analyzed the 
comorbidities of these patients. Our study revealed that only 46.7% of the 
patients had engaged in a conversation with a medical professional, namely, a 
child neurologist, about transitioning. A total of 60% of the participants 
expressed having confidence in their self-care ability. However, the median TRAQ 
score of 3.6 shows that these patients overestimate themselves. We emphasize the 
necessity for a slow, personalized transition led by a multidisciplinary team to 
ensure the continuity of state-of-the-art care from pediatric to adult 
healthcare services and the achievement of the highest possible quality of life 
for these patients.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most common 
neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly. The key histopathological features of 
these diseases are the presence of abnormal protein aggregates and the 
progressive and irreversible loss of neurons in specific brain regions. The 
exact mechanisms underlying the etiopathogenesis of AD or PD remain unknown, but 
there is extensive evidence indicating that excessive generation of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), along with a depleted 
antioxidant system, mitochondrial dysfunction, and intracellular Ca2+ 
dyshomeostasis, plays a vital role in the pathophysiology of these neurological 
disorders. Due to an improvement in life expectancy, the incidence of 
age-related neurodegenerative diseases has significantly increased. However, 
there is no effective protective treatment or therapy available but rather only 
very limited palliative treatment. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the 
development of preventive strategies and disease-modifying therapies to treat 
AD/PD. Because dysregulated Ca2+ metabolism drives oxidative damage and 
neuropathology in these diseases, the identification or development of compounds 
capable of restoring Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling may provide a 
neuroprotective avenue for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In 
addition, a set of strategies to control mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and 
signaling has been reported, including decreased Ca2+ uptake through 
voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCCs). In this article, we review the 
modulatory effects of several heterocyclic compounds on Ca2+ homeostasis and 
trafficking, as well as their ability to regulate compromised mitochondrial 
function and associated free-radical production during the onset and progression 
of AD or PD. This comprehensive review also describes the chemical synthesis of 
the heterocycles and summarizes the clinical trial outcomes.

Wheat genotypes should be improved through available germplasm genetic diversity 
to ensure food security. This study investigated the molecular diversity and 
population structure of a set of Türkiye bread wheat genotypes using 120 
microsatellite markers. Based on the results, 651 polymorphic alleles were 
evaluated to determine genetic diversity and population structure. The number of 
alleles ranged from 2 to 19, with an average of 5.44 alleles per locus. 
Polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.031 to 0.915 with a mean of 
0.43. In addition, the gene diversity index ranged from 0.03 to 0.92 with an 
average of 0.46. The expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.00 to 0.359 with a 
mean of 0.124. The unbiased expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.00 to 0.319 
with an average of 0.112. The mean values of the number of effective alleles 
(Ne), genetic diversity of Nei (H) and Shannon's information index (I) were 
estimated at 1.190, 1.049 and 0.168, respectively. The highest genetic diversity 
(GD) was estimated between genotypes G1 and G27. In the UPGMA dendrogram, the 63 
genotypes were grouped into three clusters. The three main coordinates were able 
to explain 12.64, 6.38 and 4.90% of genetic diversity, respectively. AMOVA 
revealed diversity within populations at 78% and between populations at 22%. The 
current populations were found to be highly structured. Model-based cluster 
analyses classified the 63 genotypes studied into three subpopulations. The 
values of F-statistic (Fst) for the identified subpopulations were 0.253, 0.330 
and 0.244, respectively. In addition, the expected values of heterozygosity (He) 
for these sub-populations were recorded as 0.45, 0.46 and 0.44, respectively. 
Therefore, SSR markers can be useful not only in genetic diversity and 
association analysis of wheat but also in its germplasm for various agronomic 
traits or mechanisms of tolerance to environmental stresses.

People with schizophrenia have shortened life expectancy partly due to physical 
ill health. Management of coexisting mental and physical health issues is 
complex, and knowledge in the field is lacking. This study investigated how 
physical health was managed among people with schizophrenia, by integrating 
findings from three separate analyses conducted in an ethnographic study. 
Qualitative data generation methods were used; 505 h of field work were 
undertaken among nine participants with schizophrenia and 27 mental healthcare 
professionals were interviewed using a semi-structured interview approach. Three 
separate analyses were conducted using thematic and discourse analysis. 
Progressive focusing was used to integrate findings. Across the mental health 
care contexts that were part of this research, managing physical health was 
characterised by a lack of recognition of the seriousness of physical health 
issues as part of everyday life among people with schizophrenia. Poor physical 
health was accounted for as being "not of importance" by both mental health care 
professionals and the participants experiencing physical health issues. The 
integrated findings offer new insights about the social co-construction of poor 
physical health as something normal. At the individual level, this shared 
understanding by people with schizophrenia and healthcare professionals 
contributed to sustaining inexpedient management strategies of "modifying" 
behaviour or "retreating" from everyday life when physical health issues were 
experienced.

Applying Machine Learning to Healthcare Operations Management: CNN-Based Model 
for Malaria Diagnosis.

The purpose of this study is to explore how machine learning technologies can 
improve healthcare operations management. A machine learning-based model to 
solve a specific medical problem is developed to achieve this research purpose. 
Specifically, this study presents an AI solution for malaria infection diagnosis 
by applying the CNN (convolutional neural network) algorithm. Based on malaria 
microscopy image data from the NIH National Library of Medicine, a total of 
24,958 images were used for deep learning training, and 2600 images were 
selected for final testing of the proposed diagnostic architecture. The 
empirical results indicate that the CNN diagnostic model correctly classified 
most malaria-infected and non-infected cases with minimal misclassification, 
with performance metrics of precision (0.97), recall (0.99), and f1-score (0.98) 
for uninfected cells, and precision (0.99), recall (0.97), and f1-score (0.98) 
for parasite cells. The CNN diagnostic solution rapidly processed a large number 
of cases with a high reliable accuracy of 97.81%. The performance of this CNN 
model was further validated through the k-fold cross-validation test. These 
results suggest the advantage of machine learning-based diagnostic methods over 
conventional manual diagnostic methods in improving healthcare operational 
capabilities in terms of diagnostic quality, processing costs, lead time, and 
productivity. In addition, a machine learning diagnosis system is more likely to 
enhance the financial profitability of healthcare operations by reducing the 
risk of unnecessary medical disputes related to diagnostic errors. As an 
extension for future research, propositions with a research framework are 
presented to examine the impacts of machine learning on healthcare operations 
management for safety and quality of life in global communities.

Although transcatheter valve therapy is rapidly evolving, surgical valve 
replacement is still required in many patients with severe left-side valve 
stenosis or regurgitation, the mechanical bi-leaflet heart valve being the 
standard prosthesis type in younger patients. Moreover, the prevalence of 
valvular heart disease is steadily increasing, especially in industrialized 
countries, and the problem of lifelong efficient anticoagulation of these 
patients remains fundamental, especially in the context where vitamin K 
antagonists continue to be the current standard of anticoagulation despite a 
level of oscillating anticoagulation. In this setting, avoiding prosthetic valve 
thrombosis after surgery is the number one objective for both the patient and 
the responsible physicians. Although rare, this complication is life 
threatening, with the sudden onset of acute cardiac failure such as acute 
pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, or sudden cardiac death and inadequate 
anticoagulation remaining the leading cause of prosthesis thrombosis, along with 
other risk factors. The availability of multimodal imaging techniques enables 
and encompasses to a full extent the diagnosis of mechanical valve thrombosis. 
The gold-standard diagnostic methods are transthoracic and transesophageal 
echocardiography. Moreover, 3D ultrasound has undoubted value in giving a more 
accurate description of the thrombus's extension. When transthoracic and 
transesophageal echocardiography are uncertain, the multidetector computer 
tomography examination is an important complementary imaging method. Fluoroscopy 
is also an excellent tool for evaluating the mobility of prosthetic discs. Each 
method complements the other to differentiate an acute mechanical valve 
thrombosis from other prosthetic valve pathologies such as pannus formation or 
infective endocarditis and aids the physician in accurately establishing the 
treatment method (surgical or pharmaceutical) and its optimal timing. The aim of 
this pictorial review was to discuss from an imagistic perspective the 
mechanical prosthetic aortic and mitral valve thrombosis and to provide an 
overview of the essential role of non-invasive exploration in the treatment of 
this severe complication.

Despite being one of the most debilitating conditions encountered in the field 
of toxicology, there is a lack of neutralization measures for the toxins 
involved in acute corrosive poisoning, and this promotes progressive contact 
injury of deep tissues after poisoning has occurred. Multiple controversies 
still surround management strategies during the acute phase of poisoning and the 
long-term follow-up of the patient. Here, we report a severe case of intentional 
poisoning with nitric acid complicated by extensive injury of the upper 
digestive tract, multiple stricture formation, and complete dysphagia. Serial 
endoscopic dilation and insertion of a jejunostomy feeding tube were necessary, 
and underlying psychiatric illness negatively affected the outcome of the 
patient. We conclude that an interdisciplinary approach is necessary to properly 
reduce the extent of lesions and sequelae induced by corrosion. Early endoscopic 
mapping of injuries is of major importance to better predict the evolution and 
possible complications of poisoning. Interventional and reconstructive surgical 
procedures may significantly improve the life expectancy and quality of life of 
patients following intoxication with corrosive substances.

Aging is a physical procedure for people and nature. Our aging world is 
expanding because of the life span extension. Aging has a crucial relationship 
with our body composition (muscles, bones, and adipose tissue), which is 
characterized by an increase in fat mass and a gradual decrease in muscle mass 
and strength and bone density. These alterations affect physical performance and 
impact quality of life enhancing the risk for non-communicable diseases, 
immobilization, and disability. As far we know, osteoarthritis of lower limbs, 
sarcopenic obesity, and muscle mass and/or strength loss are treated separately. 
However, bones, muscles, adipose tissue, and aging appear to have an 
interconnection through a dialogue as they talk to each other. Health disorders 
are coming into the surface when this relationship is disrupted. The aim of our 
study is to search deeper into this interconnection, so that when adipose tissue 
increases, we have to take a look into the condition of muscle mass, bone, and 
connective tissue and vice versa, through the assessment of physical 
performance. Consequently, the triad muscle-bone-adipose tissue disorders by 
aging should be treated as a single entity.

WRKY gene family is one of the largest transcription factor families involved in 
various physiological processes of plants. Flax (Linum usitatissimum) is an 
important stem fiber crop, and it is also an economically important crop in 
natural fiber and textile industries around the world. In this study, 105 WRKY 
genes were obtained by screening the whole genome of flax. There were 26 in 
group I, 68 in group II, 8 in group III and 3 in group UN. The characteristics 
of the WRKY motif and gene structure in each group are similar. The promoter 
sequence of WRKY genes includes photoresponsive elements, core regulatory 
elements and 12 cis-acting elements under abiotic stress. Similar to A. thaliana 
and Compositae plants, WRKY genes are evenly distributed on each chromosome, 
with segmental and tandem repeated events, which play a major role in the 
evolution of WRKY genes. The flax WRKY gene family is mainly concentrated in 
group I and group II. This study is mainly based on genome-wide information to 
classify and analyze the flax WRKY gene family, laying a foundation for further 
understanding the role of WRKY transcription factors in species evolution and 
functional analysis.

Risk of Infections Secondary to the Use of Targeted Therapies in Hematological 
Malignancies.

Concurrent infections in hematological malignancies (HM) are major contributors 
to adverse clinical outcomes, including prolonged hospitalization and reduced 
life expectancy. Individuals diagnosed with HM are particularly susceptible to 
infectious pathogens due to immunosuppression, which can either be inherent to 
the hematological disorder or induced by specific therapeutic strategies. Over 
the years, the treatment paradigm for HM has witnessed a tremendous shift, from 
broad-spectrum treatment approaches to more specific targeted therapies. At 
present, the therapeutic landscape of HM is constantly evolving due to the 
advent of novel targeted therapies and the enhanced utilization of these agents 
for treatment purposes. By initiating unique molecular pathways, these agents 
hinder the proliferation of malignant cells, consequently affecting innate and 
adaptive immunity, which increases the risk of infectious complications. Due to 
the complexity of novel targeted therapies and their associated risks of 
infection, it often becomes a daunting task for physicians to maintain updated 
knowledge in their clinical practice. The situation is further aggravated by the 
fact that most of the initial clinical trials on targeted therapies provide 
inadequate information to determine the associated risk of infection. In such a 
scenario, a cumulative body of evidence is paramount in guiding clinicians 
regarding the infectious complications that can arise following targeted 
therapies. In this review, I summarize the recent knowledge on infectious 
complications arising in the context of targeted therapies for HM.

As life expectancy rises, more elderly people undergo spinal fusion surgery to 
treat lumbar degenerative diseases. The MIS-TLIF technique, which minimizes soft 
tissue manipulation, is a promising fusion technique for frailer patients. The 
aim of this study was to investigate if older age is a significant factor in the 
clinical outcome of single- or double-level MIS-TLIF. A cross-sectional study 
was conducted on 103 consecutive patients. Data were compared between younger 
(<65 y.o.) and older (≥65 y.o.) patients. We observed no significant differences 
between baseline characteristics of the two groups apart from the frequency of 
disk space treated, with a relative predominance of L3-L4 space treated in the 
elderly (10% vs. 28%, p = 0.01) and L5-S1 space in younger patients (36% vs. 5%, 
p = 0.006). There was no significant difference in complication rate, surgical 
satisfaction, EQ 5D-5L, or Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) global or specific 
scores, with the exception of the EQ 5D-5L "mobility" score, where older 
patients fared worse (1.8 ± 1.1 vs. 2.3 ± 1.4; p = 0.05). The minimal 
invasiveness of the surgical technique, age-related specific outcome 
expectations, and biomechanical issues are all potential factors influencing the 
lack of age group differences in outcome scores.

The aim of our study was to investigate the clinical features of central serous 
chorioretinopathy (CSC) with autofluorescence (AF), retromode (RM), and enface 
imaging. This retrospective study was conducted at Fondazione Policlinico 
Universitario A. Gemelli, IRCCS, Rome (Italy), between September and December 
2022. Each patient underwent a complete ophthalmological examination, which 
included optical coherence tomography (OCT), enface image analysis, AF, and RM 
imaging. We further evaluated the presence and area of extension of serous 
retinal detachment and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy through AF, RM, 
and enface imaging. We included 32 eyes from 27 patients (mean age: 52.7 ± 13.3 
years). The median AF area was 19.5 mm2 (IQR 6.1-29.3), while the median RM area 
was 12.3 mm2 (IQR 8.1-30.8), and the median enface area was 9.3 mm2 (IQR 
4.8-18.6). RPE atrophy was diagnosed in 26 cases (81.3%) with RM imaging and in 
75% of cases with AF. No difference emerged between AF and RM analysis in the 
detection of central serous detachment in CSC. However, RM imaging showed a high 
specificity (91.7%) and negative predictive value (84.6%) to detect RPE changes 
when compared to the AF standard-of-care technique. Thus, RM imaging could be 
considered an adjunctive imaging method in CSC.

Ecuador.

Background and Objectives: Urinary incontinence (UI) is a condition that is more 
common in women than men and has an increasing prevalence with age. It provides 
a range of psychological and physical burdens that negatively affect the 
patient's quality of life (QoL). However, the economic burden for the healthcare 
system is being augmented due to the increasing life expectancy of the 
population. This article aims to identify the effectiveness of pelvic floor 
muscle training (PFMT) on the QoL in women with UI. Materials and Methods: A 
systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, 
ProQuest medicine, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases. The terms 
selected according to components of PICOS were women with urinary incontinence, 
pelvic floor muscle training, watchful or other types of therapies, quality of 
life, randomized controlled trials, and interventional or observational studies. 
The articles included were those published between November 2018 and November 
2022. Ten articles were found for the systematic review and eight for the 
meta-analysis. Results: The QoL moderately increased when PFMT was used on women 
with UI, the results indicating an overall small effect on the QoL across the 
controlled studies and a moderate effect on the QoL across the one-group 
pre-post-studies. Conclusions: Specific QoL domains, such as social activities 
and general health, also demonstrated benefits from PFMT interventions. This 
study confirmed the effectiveness of PFMT on the QoL in women with UI, mainly 
for patients with stress urinary incontinence.

Nanocelluloses (NCs) are appealing nanomaterials that have experienced rapid 
development in recent years, with great potential in the biomedical field. This 
trend aligns with the increasing demand for sustainable materials, which will 
contribute both to an improvement in wellbeing and an extension of human life, 
and with the demand to keep up with advances in medical technology. In recent 
years, due to the diversity of their physical and biological properties and the 
possibility of tuning them according to the desired goal, these nanomaterials 
represent a point of maximum interest in the medical field. Applications such as 
tissue engineering, drug delivery, wound dressing, medical implants or those in 
cardiovascular health are some of the applications in which NCs have been 
successfully used. This review presents insight into the latest medical 
applications of NCs, in the forms of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), cellulose 
nanofibers (CNFs) and bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), with an emphasis on the 
domains that have recently experienced remarkable growth, namely wound dressing, 
tissue engineering and drug delivery. In order to highlight only the most recent 
achievements, the presented information is focused on studies from the last 3 
years. Approaches to the preparation of NCs are discussed either by top-down 
(chemical or mechanical degradation) or by bottom-up (biosynthesis) techniques, 
along with their morphological characterization and unique properties, such as 
mechanical and biological properties. Finally, the main challenges, limitations 
and future research directions of NCs are identified in a sustained effort to 
identify their effective use in biomedical fields.

Ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBDs) are responsible for significant losses in 
terms of treatment costs, decreased productivity (such as milk and meat), 
reduced reproductive ability, and financial crisis to livestock owners. In 
Pakistan, it is crucial to periodically assess the risk of TTBDs and ecological 
factors, potential causes of acaricidal resistance in tick fauna, and the 
intensive increase in the spread of TTBDs. Participatory epidemiological 
approaches are key to assessing the livestock owners' and stakeholders' 
knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) about TTBDs. The current study 
determined the KAP about ticks and tick-borne diseases of respondents from 
Sindh, Pakistan. A total of 240 respondents were interviewed from different 
ecological zones: among them, 42.5% (n = 102) of the respondents practiced the 
manual removal of ticks from animals, while acaricide usage was indicated by 137 
respondents (57.0%) as occurring sometimes, 50 (20.8%) monthly, 41 (17.0%) 
fortnightly, and 12 (5%) weekly, during the peak infestation season. Ticks were 
2.6 times [OR = 2.5 (95% Cl = 1.47-4.06)] and viruses were 1.89 times [OR = 188 
(95% Cl = 1.09-2.9)] more likely to cause the development of disease in animals 
than any other pathogen. Despite the appropriate usage of acaricides, the 
knowledge of participants was inadequate. The findings of this study emphasize 
the need to take into account identified knowledge gaps and to take the 
initiative in carrying out appropriate education activities and extension 
programs to enhance the adoption of effective tick prevention and control 
strategies.

BACKGROUND: The impact that dietary carbohydrates have on children developing 
type 2 diabetes remains controversial. Furthermore, there are limited pediatric 
longitudinal studies on changes in body mass index (BMI) and diet related to the 
development of acanthosis nigricans (AN), a risk factor associated with type 2 
diabetes.
METHODS: Two 24 h dietary records were collected for 558 children, 2-8 years of 
age, at baseline and at a 2-year follow-up. Data on age, sex, BMI, and the 
presence of AN were also collected at each time point from the Children's 
Healthy Living Program. Logistic regression was used to determine factors 
associated with the presence of AN at follow-up. Multinominal regression was 
used to determine factors associated with changes in AN status. Linear 
regression was used to measure the associations between changes in dietary 
intake and in the Burke Score for AN.
RESULTS: AN was present in 28 children at baseline and 34 children at follow-up. 
Adjusting for the presence of AN at baseline, age, sex, study group, baseline 
BMI, change in BMI z-score, time between assessments, and baseline intake, an 
increase from baseline for each teaspoon of sugar and serving of 
carbohydrate-rich food increased the risk for having AN at follow-up by 9% and 
8%, respectively (p ≤ 0.05). An increased intake of added sugar (teaspoons) 
increased the risk of developing AN by 13% (p ≤ 0.01) and an increase in 
servings of foods rich in starch increased the risk of developing AN by 12% (p ≤ 
0.01) compared to children who never had AN. Increasing the intake of fruit was 
also associated with decreased Burke Scores using multiple regression. However, 
the intake of energy and macronutrients were not associated with AN.
CONCLUSIONS: Added sugar and foods rich in starch were independently associated 
with the occurrence of AN, suggesting the type of carbohydrates consumed is a 
factor in AN occurrence.

In the United States (US), Latino individuals older than 50 years face health 
disparities compared to their White counterparts. Considering the rising life 
expectancy and the projected increase of older Latino adults in the US, this 
scoping review aimed to determine the effectiveness of theory-based and 
culturally relevant strategies that promote healthy aging in Latinos. Web of 
Science and PubMed databases were searched between December 2022 and February 
2023 for peer-reviewed articles assessing healthy aging interventions tailored 
to community-dwelling aging Latino adults. We included nine studies describing 
the effects of seven interventions on physical activity- or nutrition-related 
outcomes. Although not always statistically significant, interventions had a 
beneficial impact on well-being indicators. The most commonly used behavioral 
theories were Social Cognitive Theory and Attribution Theory. Latino cultural 
elements in these studies included partnering with community organizations that 
serve Latinos (such as Catholic churches), delivery of in-person bilingual group 
sessions by trusted community members (such as promotoras or Latino dance 
instructors), and incorporating values such as family and religion into the 
health curriculum, among others. Future strategies that promote healthy aging in 
Latino adults should proactively culturally adapt the theoretical foundations 
and the design, recruitment, and implementation processes to ensure their 
relevance and effectiveness.
