We're all living longer, and for that we have galloping advances in medicine and 
biology to thank. One hundred years ago anyone who made it to 60 would be near 
death's door, writes Jha, but now 60 'is barely old enough for retirement'.

BACKGROUND: This paper addresses the levels of psychological distress 
experienced at age 42 years by men and women born in 1958 and 1970. Comparing 
these cohorts born 12 years apart, we ask whether psychological distress has 
increased, and, if so, whether this increase can be explained by differences in 
their childhood conditions.
METHOD: Data were utilized from two well-known population-based birth cohorts, 
the National Child Development Study and the 1970 British Cohort Study. Latent 
variable models and causal mediation methods were employed.
RESULTS: After establishing the measurement equivalence of psychological 
distress in the two cohorts we found that men and women born in 1970 reported 
higher levels of psychological distress compared with those born in 1958. These 
differences were more pronounced in men (b = 0.314, 95% confidence interval 
0.252-0.375), with the magnitude of the effect being twice as strong compared 
with women (b = 0.147, 95% confidence interval 0.076-0.218). The effect of all 
hypothesized early-life mediators in explaining these differences was modest.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have implications for public health policy, indicating 
a higher average level of psychological distress among a cohort born in 1970 
compared with a generation born 12 years earlier. Due to increases in life 
expectancy, more recently born cohorts are expected to live longer, which 
implies - if such differences persist - that they are likely to spend more years 
with mental health-related morbidity compared with earlier-born cohorts.

BACKGROUND: Improving survival and extending the longevity of life for all 
populations requires timely, robust evidence on local mortality levels and 
trends. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides a 
comprehensive assessment of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 249 
causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. These results 
informed an in-depth investigation of observed and expected mortality patterns 
based on sociodemographic measures.
METHODS: We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using 
an improved analytical approach originally developed for GBD 2013 and GBD 2010. 
Improvements included refinements to the estimation of child and adult mortality 
and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality 
synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, and sibling history 
data processing. We also expanded the database of vital registration, survey, 
and census data to 14 294 geography-year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, 
including Ebola virus disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for 
mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-specific mortality, 
with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating estimates for most 
causes. We used a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the 
drivers of trends in mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed 
and expected levels and trends of cause-specific mortality as they relate to the 
Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of 
income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Second, we examined 
factors affecting total mortality patterns through a series of counterfactual 
scenarios, testing the magnitude by which population growth, population age 
structures, and epidemiological changes contributed to shifts in mortality. 
Finally, we attributed changes in life expectancy to changes in cause of death. 
We documented each step of the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data 
sources, in accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health 
Estimates Reporting (GATHER).
FINDINGS: Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61·7 years (95% 
uncertainty interval 61·4-61·9) in 1980 to 71·8 years (71·5-72·2) in 2015. 
Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in life expectancy 
from 2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly high loss of life due 
to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, many geographies saw life expectancy stagnate or 
decline, particularly for men and in countries with rising mortality from war or 
interpersonal violence. From 2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped 
by 11·3 years (3·7-17·4), to 62·6 years (56·5-70·2). Total deaths increased by 
4·1% (2·6-5·6) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55·8 million (54·9 million to 56·6 
million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17·0% (15·8-18·1) 
during this time, underscoring changes in population growth and shifts in global 
age structures. The result was similar for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), 
with total deaths from these causes increasing by 14·1% (12·6-16·0) to 39·8 
million (39·2 million to 40·5 million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates 
decreased by 13·1% (11·9-14·3). Globally, this mortality pattern emerged for 
several NCDs, including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, 
cirrhosis, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total 
deaths and age-standardised death rates due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, 
and nutritional conditions significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, gains 
largely attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS (42·1%, 
39·1-44·6), malaria (43·1%, 34·7-51·8), neonatal preterm birth complications 
(29·8%, 24·8-34·9), and maternal disorders (29·1%, 19·3-37·1). Progress was 
slower for several causes, such as lower respiratory infections and nutritional 
deficiencies, whereas deaths increased for others, including dengue and drug use 
disorders. Age-standardised death rates due to injuries significantly declined 
from 2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly more 
lives in some regions, particularly in the Middle East. In 2015, rotaviral 
enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea 
(146 000 deaths, 118 000-183 000) and pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading 
cause of under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infections (393 000 deaths, 
228 000-532 000), although pathogen-specific mortality varied by region. 
Globally, the effects of population growth, ageing, and changes in 
age-standardised death rates substantially differed by cause. Our analyses on 
the expected associations between cause-specific mortality and SDI show the 
regular shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with 
rising SDI. Country patterns of premature mortality (measured as years of life 
lost [YLLs]) and how they differ from the level expected on the basis of SDI 
alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous patterns by region and country 
or territory. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes were among the 
leading causes of YLLs in most regions, but in many cases, intraregional results 
sharply diverged for ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. 
Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs 
throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding expected YLLs 
for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading causes of early 
death.
INTERPRETATION: At the global scale, age-specific mortality has steadily 
improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of general progress continued in 
the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries than expected on the 
basis of development measured by the SDI. Against this background of progress, 
some countries have seen falls in life expectancy, and age-standardised death 
rates for some causes are increasing. Despite progress in reducing 
age-standardised death rates, population growth and ageing mean that the number 
of deaths from most non-communicable causes are increasing in most countries, 
putting increased demands on health systems.

BACKGROUND: Non-fatal outcomes of disease and injury increasingly detract from 
the ability of the world's population to live in full health, a trend largely 
attributable to an epidemiological transition in many countries from causes 
affecting children, to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) more common in adults. 
For the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 
2015), we estimated the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability 
for diseases and injuries at the global, regional, and national scale over the 
period of 1990 to 2015.
METHODS: We estimated incidence and prevalence by age, sex, cause, year, and 
geography with a wide range of updated and standardised analytical procedures. 
Improvements from GBD 2013 included the addition of new data sources, updates to 
literature reviews for 85 causes, and the identification and inclusion of 
additional studies published up to November, 2015, to expand the database used 
for estimation of non-fatal outcomes to 60 900 unique data sources. Prevalence 
and incidence by cause and sequelae were determined with DisMod-MR 2.1, an 
improved version of the DisMod-MR Bayesian meta-regression tool first developed 
for GBD 2010 and GBD 2013. For some causes, we used alternative modelling 
strategies where the complexity of the disease was not suited to DisMod-MR 2.1 
or where incidence and prevalence needed to be determined from other data. For 
GBD 2015 we created a summary indicator that combines measures of income per 
capita, educational attainment, and fertility (the Socio-demographic Index 
[SDI]) and used it to compare observed patterns of health loss to the expected 
pattern for countries or locations with similar SDI scores.
FINDINGS: We generated 9·3 billion estimates from the various combinations of 
prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for causes, sequelae, and impairments by age, 
sex, geography, and year. In 2015, two causes had acute incidences in excess of 
1 billion: upper respiratory infections (17·2 billion, 95% uncertainty interval 
[UI] 15·4-19·2 billion) and diarrhoeal diseases (2·39 billion, 2·30-2·50 
billion). Eight causes of chronic disease and injury each affected more than 10% 
of the world's population in 2015: permanent caries, tension-type headache, 
iron-deficiency anaemia, age-related and other hearing loss, migraine, genital 
herpes, refraction and accommodation disorders, and ascariasis. The impairment 
that affected the greatest number of people in 2015 was anaemia, with 2·36 
billion (2·35-2·37 billion) individuals affected. The second and third leading 
impairments by number of individuals affected were hearing loss and vision loss, 
respectively. Between 2005 and 2015, there was little change in the leading 
causes of years lived with disability (YLDs) on a global basis. NCDs accounted 
for 18 of the leading 20 causes of age-standardised YLDs on a global scale. 
Where rates were decreasing, the rate of decrease for YLDs was slower than that 
of years of life lost (YLLs) for nearly every cause included in our analysis. 
For low SDI geographies, Group 1 causes typically accounted for 20-30% of total 
disability, largely attributable to nutritional deficiencies, malaria, neglected 
tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. Lower back and neck pain was the 
leading global cause of disability in 2015 in most countries. The leading cause 
was sense organ disorders in 22 countries in Asia and Africa and one in central 
Latin America; diabetes in four countries in Oceania; HIV/AIDS in three southern 
sub-Saharan African countries; collective violence and legal intervention in two 
north African and Middle Eastern countries; iron-deficiency anaemia in Somalia 
and Venezuela; depression in Uganda; onchoceriasis in Liberia; and other 
neglected tropical diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
INTERPRETATION: Ageing of the world's population is increasing the number of 
people living with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Shifts in the 
epidemiological profile driven by socioeconomic change also contribute to the 
continued increase in years lived with disability (YLDs) as well as the rate of 
increase in YLDs. Despite limitations imposed by gaps in data availability and 
the variable quality of the data available, the standardised and comprehensive 
approach of the GBD study provides opportunities to examine broad trends, 
compare those trends between countries or subnational geographies, benchmark 
against locations at similar stages of development, and gauge the strength or 
weakness of the estimates available.

BACKGROUND: Healthy life expectancy (HALE) and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) provide summary measures of health across geographies and time that can 
inform assessments of epidemiological patterns and health system performance, 
help to prioritise investments in research and development, and monitor progress 
toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We aimed to provide updated 
HALE and DALYs for geographies worldwide and evaluate how disease burden changes 
with development.
METHODS: We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, 
and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries 
and territories from 1990 to 2015. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life 
lost (YLLs) and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) for each geography, 
age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using the Sullivan method, which 
draws from age-specific death rates and YLDs per capita. We then assessed how 
observed levels of DALYs and HALE differed from expected trends calculated with 
the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator constructed from 
measures of income per capita, average years of schooling, and total fertility 
rate.
FINDINGS: Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2015, with 
decreases in communicable, neonatal, maternal, and nutritional (Group 1) disease 
DALYs offset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Much of 
this epidemiological transition was caused by changes in population growth and 
ageing, but it was accelerated by widespread improvements in SDI that also 
correlated strongly with the increasing importance of NCDs. Both total DALYs and 
age-standardised DALY rates due to most Group 1 causes significantly decreased 
by 2015, and although total burden climbed for the majority of NCDs, 
age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined. Nonetheless, age-standardised 
DALY rates due to several high-burden NCDs (including osteoarthritis, drug use 
disorders, depression, diabetes, congenital birth defects, and skin, oral, and 
sense organ diseases) either increased or remained unchanged, leading to 
increases in their relative ranking in many geographies. From 2005 to 2015, HALE 
at birth increased by an average of 2·9 years (95% uncertainty interval 2·9-3·0) 
for men and 3·5 years (3·4-3·7) for women, while HALE at age 65 years improved 
by 0·85 years (0·78-0·92) and 1·2 years (1·1-1·3), respectively. Rising SDI was 
associated with consistently higher HALE and a somewhat smaller proportion of 
life spent with functional health loss; however, rising SDI was related to 
increases in total disability. Many countries and territories in central America 
and eastern sub-Saharan Africa had increasingly lower rates of disease burden 
than expected given their SDI. At the same time, a subset of geographies 
recorded a growing gap between observed and expected levels of DALYs, a trend 
driven mainly by rising burden due to war, interpersonal violence, and various 
NCDs.
INTERPRETATION: Health is improving globally, but this means more populations 
are spending more time with functional health loss, an absolute expansion of 
morbidity. The proportion of life spent in ill health decreases somewhat with 
increasing SDI, a relative compression of morbidity, which supports continued 
efforts to elevate personal income, improve education, and limit fertility. Our 
analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust 
framework on which to benchmark geography-specific health performance and SDG 
progress. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes 
with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform financial and research 
investments, prevention efforts, health policies, and health system improvement 
initiatives for all countries along the development continuum.

BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 
provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk factor exposure and 
the attributable burden of disease. By providing national and subnational 
assessments spanning the past 25 years, this study can inform debates on the 
importance of addressing risks in context.
METHODS: We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for 
previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate 
attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and trends in 
exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural, 
environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 
1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met World Cancer 
Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence. We extracted 
relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials, cohorts, 
pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other 
sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and 
incorporate covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of 
exposure across risk factors-the summary exposure value. Using the 
counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the 
portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We 
decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population 
growth, population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific 
DALY rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a Socio-demographic 
Index (SDI).
FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation, household 
air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and smoking each 
decreased by more than 25%. Global exposure for several occupational risks, high 
body-mass index (BMI), and drug use increased by more than 25% over the same 
period. All risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57·8% (95% CI 
56·6-58·8) of global deaths and 41·2% (39·8-42·8) of DALYs. In 2015, the ten 
largest contributors to global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic 
blood pressure (211·8 million [192·7 million to 231·1 million] global DALYs), 
smoking (148·6 million [134·2 million to 163·1 million]), high fasting plasma 
glucose (143·1 million [125·1 million to 163·5 million]), high BMI (120·1 
million [83·8 million to 158·4 million]), childhood undernutrition (113·3 
million [103·9 million to 123·4 million]), ambient particulate matter (103·1 
million [90·8 million to 115·1 million]), high total cholesterol (88·7 million 
[74·6 million to 105·7 million]), household air pollution (85·6 million [66·7 
million to 106·1 million]), alcohol use (85·0 million [77·2 million to 93·0 
million]), and diets high in sodium (83·0 million [49·3 million to 127·5 
million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable DALYs declined for micronutrient 
deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation and water, and 
household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted DALY rates rather than 
reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising exposure contributed to 
notable increases in attributable DALYs from high BMI, high fasting plasma 
glucose, occupational carcinogens, and drug use. Environmental risks and 
childhood undernutrition declined steadily with SDI; low physical activity, high 
BMI, and high fasting plasma glucose increased with SDI. In 119 countries, 
metabolic risks, such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the 
most attributable DALYs in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the 
leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries; childhood 
underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and 
disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa.
INTERPRETATION: Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to 
declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be invariant to 
SDI. Increasing risks, including high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, drug 
use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to rising burden from some 
conditions, but also provide opportunities for intervention. Some highly 
preventable risks, such as smoking, remain major causes of attributable DALYs, 
even as exposure is declining. Public policy makers need to pay attention to the 
risks that are increasingly major contributors to global burden.

AIMS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and prevalence 
increases with age. Patients with AF have a high risk of stroke, and screening 
for AF is recommended in all people aged 65 years or older to identify patients 
eligible for stroke prevention. A handheld, single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) 
device can be used for systematic screening in the population at risk. The 
objective of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening for 
AF in primary care with the MyDiagnostick® during seasonal influenza vaccination 
in the Netherlands.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Lifetime costs and effects of a single screening session 
for AF detection were assessed from a societal perspective with a decision 
analytic model consisting of a straightforward decision tree and a joining 
Markov model. The decision model simulated all patients aged 65 years and over 
attending the seasonal influenza vaccination in the Netherlands. Event 
probabilities were derived from clinical trials. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed to assess the impact of important model assumptions as well as 
determining the relative effect of individual parameters. Screening for AF with 
the MyDiagnostick® in all patients older than 65 years that attend seasonal 
influenza vaccination in the Netherlands would decrease the overall costs by 
€764 and increase the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 0.27 years per 
patient. Early detection of AF would prevent strokes and leads to beneficial 
health effects with subsequent cost savings. This screening method would have an 
estimated probability of 99.8% for being cost-effective at a conservative 
willingness-to-pay of €20 000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: Screening for AF in primary care with a handheld, single-lead ECG 
during seasonal influenza vaccination is very likely to be cost saving for 
identifying new cases of AF in the Dutch population aged 65 years and over. 
Active screening for AF with a single-lead, handheld ECG device during seasonal 
influenza vaccination could be implemented in primary care.

The use of information from the hippocampal memory system in motivated behavior 
depends on its communication with the ventral striatum. When an animal 
encounters cues that signal subsequent reward, its reward expectancy is raised. 
It is unknown, however, how this process affects hippocampal dynamics and their 
influence on target structures, such as ventral striatum. We show that, in rats, 
reward-predictive cues result in enhanced hippocampal theta and beta band 
rhythmic activity during subsequent action, compared with uncued goal-directed 
navigation. The beta band component, also labeled theta's harmonic, involves 
selective hippocampal CA1 cell groups showing frequency doubling of firing 
periodicity relative to theta rhythmicity and it partitions the theta cycle into 
segments showing clear versus poor spike timing organization. We found that 
theta phase precession occurred over a wider range than previously reported. 
This was apparent from spikes emitted near the peak of the theta cycle 
exhibiting large "phase precessing jumps" relative to spikes in foregoing 
cycles. Neither this phenomenon nor the regular manifestation of theta phase 
precession was affected by reward expectancy. Ventral striatal neuronal firing 
phase-locked not only to hippocampal theta, but also to beta band activity. Both 
hippocampus and ventral striatum showed increased synchronization between 
neuronal firing and local field potential activity during cued compared with 
uncued goal approaches. These results suggest that cue-triggered reward 
expectancy intensifies hippocampal output to target structures, such as the 
ventral striatum, by which the hippocampus may gain prioritized access to 
systems modulating motivated behaviors.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Here we show that temporally discrete cues raising 
reward expectancy enhance both theta and beta band activity in the hippocampus 
once goal-directed navigation has been initiated. These rhythmic activities are 
associated with increased synchronization of neuronal firing patterns in the 
hippocampus and the connected ventral striatum. When transmitted to downstream 
target structures, this expectancy-related state of intensified processing in 
the hippocampus may modulate goal-directed action.

[Testosterone and mortality].

[Article in Czech]

Stárka L.

Subnormal levels of testosterone are frequently found in men of higher age 
category. Hypogonadal men have lower life expectancy than men with full 
androgenization and cardiovascular disease, obesity or diabetes is often 
associated with hypotestosteronemia. Low testosterone level is risk factor for 
these diseases. However, until now it is not clear whether testosterone 
deficiency is a cause or consequence of atherosclerosis or metabolic syndrome. A 
handful of symptoms and metabolic risk markers in hypogonadal men can be 
ameliorated by testosterone supplementation. Testosterone treatment increased 
sexual activity and well-being and had a moderate benefit with respect to 
depressive symptoms but no significant benefit to vitality. Testosterone has a 
beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk factors, but there is not clear whether 
it reduces mortality.Key words: civilization diseases - late onset hypogonadism 
- morbidity - mortality - testosterone - testosterone supplementation.
