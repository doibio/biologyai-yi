Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is an acute, rapidly fatal, fungal infection, 
classically involving the nasal mucosa and paranasal sinuses. It is an 
aggressive, opportunistic infection that frequently progresses to involve the 
orbit and cerebrum. Cerebral extension in immunocompromised patients is almost 
universally fatal. There are limited data on mucormycosis in pediatric 
immunocompromised patients in the literature, with only few reports on 
rhinocerebral involvement. The immunocompromised patients described in this 
report presented with suspected periorbital and nasal cellulitis, progressing 
rapidly to necrotic changes in nasal tissue and oral palatal mucosa. In these 
patients, the surgical resection of mucormycosis-infected tissue followed by 
flap reconstruction combined with medical treatment effectively treated the 
infection, allowed for the rapid resumption of chemotherapy and dramatically 
improved the quality of life for both the patient and their family.

Publisher: La mucormycose rhinocérébrale est une infection fongique aiguë qui 
devient vite fatale et qui touche généralement les muqueuses nasales et les 
sinus paranasaux. C’est une infection agressive et opportuniste qui évolue 
souvent pour toucher l’orbite et le cerveau. Chez les patients immunodéprimés, 
l’atteinte cérébrale est presque toujours fatale. Les données sur la mucormycose 
chez les patients immunodéprimés d’âge pédiatrique sont limitées dans les 
publications, et seulement quelques articles traitent de l’atteinte 
rhinocérébrale. Les patients immunodéprimés décrits dans le présent rapport ont 
consulté à cause d’une présomption de cellulite périorbitale et nasale qui a 
évolué rapidement vers une nécrose des tissus nasaux et de la muqueuse 
oropalatine. Chez ces patients, la résection chirurgicale des tissus infectés 
par la mucormycose suivie d’une reconstruction par lambeau combinée à un 
traitement médical, a favorisé la résolution de l’infection, ce qui a permis une 
reprise rapide de la chimiothérapie et a considérablement amélioré la qualité de 
vie du patient et de sa famille.

Thermal performance curves (TPCs) represent an increasingly popular tool in 
ecology for anticipating species responses to climate change. TPC theory has 
been developed using species that experience similar temperatures during 
activity and at rest and consequently exhibit thermal ranges for activity that 
closely coincide with their physiological thermal tolerances. Many species, 
however, experience other stressors, such as desiccation, that limit active 
behaviour at temperatures below the maximum values experienced. As a result, 
activity is constrained to a narrow thermal window that is a subset of the range 
of temperatures that can be tolerated physiologically. This results in a 
decoupling of behavioural and physiological TPCs that does not conform to the 
present paradigm. To test the generality of TPC theory, we measured thermal 
responses for behaviour (crawling speed) and physiological tolerance (heart 
rate) for six rocky shore gastropods spanning a thermal/desiccation stress 
gradient. We hypothesized a positive relationship between shore level and the 
degree of decoupling of behavioural and physiological TPCs. This prediction was 
confirmed, and was explained by the extension of the physiological TPC beyond 
the range of the behavioural TPC. Decoupling of behavioural and physiological 
TPCs is central to predicting accurately the fitness dynamics of ectothermic 
species subject to multiple stressors. We believe that this decoupling should be 
explicitly considered as an adaptive trait defining an organism's thermal niche.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have obvious effects 
on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but they are expensive in China. Moreover, 
the overall cost of treatment of CML is high and the medical economic burden of 
patients with CML on the government is heavy. This study tested the cost 
effectiveness of imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib as first-line treatment in 
Chinese patients who were first diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in the 
chronic phase (CML-CP).
METHODS: A state-transition Markov model combining clinical effectiveness, 
utility, and cost data was used. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to 
determine the robustness of the model outcomes.
RESULTS: The imatinib-first, dasatinib-first, and nilotinib-first strategy 
offered patients 9.76, 9.87, and 9.72 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a 
cost of US$303,502.42, US$381,681.03, and US$305,509.92 over 20 years, 
respectively. The nilotinib-first strategy exhibited the lowest utility and 
highest price and was thus eliminated. An incremental cost-effectiveness 
analysis of the imatinib-first strategy and the dasatinib-first strategy showed 
that the dasatinib-first strategy yielded an incremental cost-utility ratio 
(ICER) of 710,714.64 $/QALY compared with the imatinib-first strategy, which 
exceeded the threshold; hence, the dasatinib-first strategy was not cost 
effective and was eliminated. The results were robust for multiple sensitivity 
analyses.
CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the Chinese medical system, imatinib is 
likely to be more cost effective than dasatinib and nilotinib for patients who 
were first diagnosed with CML-CP.

BACKGROUND: We assessed the economic value of carfilzomib 56 mg/m2 and 
dexamethasone (Kd56) vs. bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) for 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (R/RMM) using ENDEAVOR trial results.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of Kd56 vs. Vd was assessed using a partitioned 
survival model by estimating progression-free survival, overall survival, and 
direct costs over a lifetime horizon. Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results 
(SEER) survival data were extrapolated after matching registry and ENDEAVOR 
patients. Utilities were sourced from the literature and mapped from 
patient-reported quality of life in ENDEAVOR to estimate quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) from life-years (LYs).
RESULTS: The model predicted an average gain of 1.66 LYs and 1.50 QALYs with 
Kd56 vs. Vd, and lifetime additional costs of $182,699, resulting in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $121,828/QALY gained. The ICER 
was $114,793/QALY in patients with 1 prior treatment; $99,263/QALY in those not 
transplanted, and <$150,000/QALY up to an 85% discount in bortezomib price.
CONCLUSIONS: Kd56 is cost-effective for patients with R/RMM at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY. Trial data in the model may limit 
generalizability; however, SEER registry data mitigates this challenge. Kd56 
provides additional value in key subgroups, and remains cost-effective after 
steep comparator discounts.

Metformin, a widely used first-line drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), 
has been shown to extend lifespan and delay the onset of age-related diseases. 
However, its primary locus of action remains unclear. Using a pure in vitro 
reconstitution system, we demonstrate that metformin acts through the 
v-ATPase-Ragulator lysosomal pathway to coordinate mTORC1 and AMPK, two hubs 
governing metabolic programs. We further show in Caenorhabditis elegans that 
both v-ATPase-mediated TORC1 inhibition and v-ATPase-AXIN/LKB1-mediated AMPK 
activation contribute to the lifespan extension effect of metformin. Elucidating 
the molecular mechanism of metformin regulated healthspan extension will boost 
its therapeutic application in the treatment of human aging and age-related 
diseases.

experiment.

BACKGROUND: The continent of Europe has experienced remarkable changes in the 
past 25 years, providing scope for natural experiments that offer insight into 
the complex determinants of health.
METHODS: We analysed trends in life expectancy at birth in three parts of 
Europe, those countries that were members of the European Union (EU) prior to 
2004, countries that joined the European Union since then, and the twelve 
countries that emerged from the Soviet Union to form the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS). The contribution of deaths at different ages to these 
changes was assessed using Arriaga's method of decomposing changes in life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: Europe remains divided geographically, with an East-West gradient. The 
former Soviet countries experienced a marked initial decline in life expectancy 
and have only recovered after 2005. However, the situation for those of working 
ages is little better than in 1990. The pre-2004 EU has seen substantial gains 
throughout the past 25 years, although there is some evidence that this may be 
slowing, or even reversing, at older ages. The countries joining the EU in 2004 
subsequently began to see some improvements in the early 1990s, but have 
experienced larger gains since 2000.
CONCLUSIONS: Europe offers a valuable natural laboratory for understanding the 
impact of political, economic, and social changes on health. While the historic 
divisions of Europe are still visible, there is also evidence that individual 
countries are doing better or worse than their neighbours, providing many 
lessons that can be learned from.

Korea.

BACKGROUND: The objective of the present study was to estimate the current and 
projected burden of disease from high ambient temperature using population-based 
data sources of nationwide mortality and morbidity in Korea.
METHODS: Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were estimated using 
noninjury-related deaths, and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases from 
recently released nationwide health and mortality databases. Years of life lost 
and years lost due to disability were measured based on the point prevalence and 
number of deaths during the study period. Future DALY attributable to heat waves 
were estimated from projected populations, and temperature predictions for the 
years 2030 and 2050 were under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 
and 8.5 with summertime temperatures above threshold.
RESULTS: Relative risks (RR) of total mortality and of cardiovascular disease 
were 1.02 (95% CI, 1.01, 1.02) and 1.08 (95% CI, 1.06, 1.09) for each 1°C 
increase in temperature above threshold, respectively. The morbidity of 
heat-related disease was RR 1.67 (95% CI, 1.64, 1.68) for each 1°C increase in 
temperature above threshold. DALY for all-cause death were 0.49 DALY/1000 in 
2011, 0.71 (0.71) DALY/1000 in 2030 and 0.77 (1.72) DALY/1000 in 2050 based on 
RCP 4.5 (RCP 8.5). DALY for cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases were 1.24 
DALY/1000 in 2011, 1.63 (1.82) DALY/1000 in 2030, and 1.76 (3.66) DALY/1000 in 
2050 based on RCP 4.5 (RCP 8.5).
CONCLUSIONS: Future excess mortality due to high ambient temperature is expected 
to be profound in Korea. Efforts to mitigate climate change can provide 
substantial health benefits via reducing heat-related mortality.

The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella Walsh (Diptera: Tephritidae), is a 
serious quarantine pest in the apple-growing regions of central Washington and 
Oregon. The fly is believed to have been introduced into the Pacific Northwest 
via the transport of larval-infested apples near Portland, Oregon, within the 
last 40 yr. However, R. pomonella also attacks native black hawthorn, Crataegus 
douglasii Lindley (Rosales: Rosaceae), and introduced ornamental hawthorn, 
Crataegus monogyna Jacquin, in the region. It is, therefore, possible that R. 
pomonella was not introduced but has always been present on black hawthorn. If 
true, then the fly may have independently shifted from hawthorn onto apple in 
the Pacific Northwest within the last 40 yr after apples were introduced. Here, 
we test the introduction hypothesis through a microsatellite genetic survey of 
10 R. pomonella sites in Washington and 5 in the eastern United States, as well 
as a comparison to patterns of genetic variation between populations of 
Rhagoletis cingulata Loew and Rhagoletis indifferens Curran, two sister species 
of cherry-infesting flies known to be native to the eastern and western United 
States, respectively. We report results based on genetic distance networks, 
patterns of allelic variation, and estimated times of population divergence that 
are consistent with the introduction hypothesis for R. pomonella. The results 
have important implications for R. pomonella management, suggesting that black 
hawthorn-infesting flies near commercial apple-growing regions of central 
Washington may harbor sufficient variation to utilize apple as an alternate 
host, urging careful monitoring, and possible removal of hawthorn trees near 
orchards.

BACKGROUND: The US National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) aims for 72% (90% diagnosed 
times 80% of those virally suppressed) viral suppression among persons with 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by 2020. We examined the clinical and 
economic impact of reaching this target, in the general US population and among 
black men who have sex with men (MSM), the group with the highest HIV 
prevalence.
METHODS: Using a mathematical simulation, we project the 5- and 20-year clinical 
outcomes, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for (1) Current Pace 
of detection, linkage, retention, and virologic suppression and (2) NHAS 
investments in expanded testing ($24-$74 per test) and adherence ($400 per 
person-year), calibrated to achieve 72% suppression by 2020. We examined 
alternative rates of testing, retention, and suppression and the efficacy and 
cost of adherence interventions.
RESULTS: Compared with Current Pace over 20 years, NHAS averted 280000 HIV 
transmissions (80000 in black MSM) and 199000 (45000) deaths and saved 2138000 
(453000) years of life, while increasing costs by 23%. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for NHAS compared with Current Pace was $68900 per 
quality-adjusted life-year ($38300 for black MSM) and was most sensitive to 
antiretroviral therapy costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Reaching NHAS targets would yield substantial clinical benefits and 
be cost-effective in both the general US and black MSM populations.

BACKGROUND: People diagnosed with mental illness (hereinafter "consumers") have 
higher rates of chronic disease and significantly shorter lives than the wider 
population. Peer workers have become increasingly involved in facilitating 
access to physical health care, yet the consumer perspective regarding peer 
involvement is unknown. This absent voice is needed to inform strategic planning 
and generate solutions to address the current inequity in health status.
AIM: To articulate the views of consumers in regards to the potential use of 
peer workers to further the physical health of people with mental illness.
METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted involving four focus 
groups with 31 consumer participants. Focus group responses were analysed 
thematically.
RESULTS: Three themes pertaining to enhancing physical health care emerged: (1) 
the potential of peer workers in mitigating existing barriers, (2) consumer 
advocacy organisations expanding their agenda and (3) benefits of segregated 
activities as a segue to mainstream options.
CONCLUSIONS: The envisaged forms of peer contribution have far greater scope and 
depth than is currently considered in policy, the research literature and health 
practice. Innovative solutions are required for this neglected population. 
Individual and systemic advocacy led by peer workers can enhance access to 
physical health care and have the potential to reduce physical health 
inequalities.

BACKGROUND: While the mortality rate is declining in the United States, the life 
expectancy gap among different population groups suggests a need to identify 
biomarkers to improve early identification of individuals at risk. Red cell 
distribution width (RDW), a measure of anisocytosis, is an emerging biomarker of 
chronic disease morbidity and mortality, particularly in the elderly. However, 
little is known about its association with mortality risk in younger adults. The 
objectives of this study were to investigate the association between RDW and 
overall and cause-specific mortality risk, and to identify novel determinants of 
RDW level.
METHODS: We used prospectively collected data from the Healthy Aging in 
Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study conducted in Baltimore, 
Maryland. At baseline (2004-2009), the study recruited 3720 African American and 
white men and women aged 30-64 years. Participants provided peripheral venous 
blood for RDW measurement as part of complete blood count, and genotyping. 
Mortality status was ascertained using the National Death Index database through 
December 31, 2013. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression 
models were fitted to assess mortality risk, and multiple linear regression 
models to identify determinants of RDW level.
RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 48.1 (9.2) years. Of 2726 participants 
included in the present analyses, 57% were African Americans, and 56% were 
women. After 18,424 person-years of follow-up time, there were 226 deaths, and 
the leading cause of death were cardiovascular diseases (31.9%). Participants in 
the highest quartile of RDW had a 1.73-fold increased all-cause mortality risk 
(highest quartile vs. lowest quartile, multivariable adjusted hazard 
ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval: 1.10-2.74, p-trend = 0.006). This effect 
was significantly modified by body mass index (p-interaction = 0.004). Similar 
risk was observed for cardiovascular disease-specific mortality. Independent of 
body mass index, waist-hip ratio and illicit drug use were significantly 
associated with RDW.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated RDW was associated with a substantial risk of all-cause 
and cardiovascular disease-specific mortalities that was modified by body mass 
index. Central obesity and illicit drug use influence RDW level. In vulnerable 
populations at-risk for health disparities, RDW could provide a useful and 
inexpensive biomarker of mortality.

PURPOSE: The Chest Radiotherapy Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Trial 
(CREST) showed that adding thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) to the standard 
treatment (ST) paradigm of chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation 
improves overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with 
extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of adding TRT to ST in ES-SCLC patients.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cost-utility analysis was performed comparing TRT plus 
ST versus ST alone. The base-case time horizon was 24 months, consistent with 
the maximum PFS reported in the CREST. Overall survival was partitioned into 2 
health states: PFS and postprogression survival. The proportion of patients in 
each health state over time was estimated by fitting parametric probability 
distributions to the CREST survival data. Costs were from a US health care payer 
perspective, and utilities were derived from the literature. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) using a 3% discount rate. Sensitivity analyses addressed uncertainty in 
key variables.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, adding TRT to ST was both cost saving and 
more effective, thereby strongly dominating ST alone. At willingness-to-pay 
thresholds of $50,000/QALY, $100,000/QALY, and $200,000/QALY, TRT was preferred 
68%, 81%, and 96% of the time, respectively. In the lifetime scenario analysis, 
the TRT ICER increased to $194,726/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: By use of the actual follow-up interval reported in the CREST, 
adding TRT to ST strongly dominates a strategy of ST alone in ES-SCLC patients. 
Since the long-term survival benefit of TRT is small relative to ongoing costs 
of progressive metastatic disease, we estimate less favorable ICERs for TRT over 
a lifetime horizon.

Physical inactivity leads to a deconditioning of the skeletal, neuromuscular and 
cardiovascular system. It can lead to impaired quality of life, loss of 
autonomy, falls and fractures. Regular exercise would be a logical remedy, but 
the generally recommended high-volume endurance and strength training programs 
require a lot of time and equipment. In this randomized controlled study with 23 
healthy participants, we established that a short, intensive jump training 
program can prevent the large musculoskeletal and cardiovascular deconditioning 
effects caused by two months of physical inactivity during bed rest, 
particularly the loss of bone mineral mass and density, lean muscle mass, 
maximal leg strength and peak oxygen uptake. The jump training group showed no 
significant changes with respect to these indicators of musculoskeletal and 
cardiovascular health after 60 days of bed rest, whereas the control group 
exhibited substantial losses: up to -2.6% in tibial bone mineral content and 
density, -5% in leg lean mass, -40% in maximal knee extension torque and -29% in 
peak oxygen uptake. Consequently, we recommend jump training as a very 
time-efficient and effective type of exercise for astronauts on long-term space 
missions, the elderly and sedentary populations in general.

The 2016 National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center's Spinal Cord Injury 
(SCI) Facts and Figures reports approximately 17,000 new cases yearly, 
approximately 54 cases per million. The past 40 years has brought a significant 
change in patterns of injury. The average age has increased from 29 years in the 
1970s to approximately 42 years currently; it is believed it has plateaued. 
Aging persons with SCI may have a higher risk of developing other medical 
complications. Studies report a perceived improvement in quality of life among 
persons with SCI with age, influenced by psychological, medical, and 
environmental factors.

The incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in older adults is increasing. As 
the expected life expectancy increases, there is a heightened need for 
comprehensive rehabilitation for this population. Elderly patients with TBI 
benefit from rehabilitation interventions at all stages of injury and can 
achieve functional gains during acute inpatient rehabilitation. Clinicians 
should be vigilant of unique characteristics of this population during inpatient 
rehabilitation, including vulnerability to polypharmacy, posttraumatic 
hydrocephalus, neuropsychiatric sequelae, sleep disturbances, and sensory 
deficits. Long-term care should include fall prevention, assessment of cognitive 
deficits, aerobic activity, community reintegration, and caretaker support. Life 
expectancy is reduced after TBI.

The dimorphic fungal pathogen, Zymoseptoria tritici undergoes discrete 
developmental changes to complete its life cycle on wheat. Molecular mechanisms 
underlying morphogenesis during infection process of Z. tritici are poorly 
understood. In this study, we have investigated the role of ZtVf1 gene encoding 
a transcription factor belonging to C2-H2 subfamily. In planta assays revealed 
that ZtVf1 is required for virulence. Reduced necrotic lesions and low pycnidia 
density within the lesions resulted in significantly reduced virulence of ZtVf1 
mutants. Cytological analysis showed that the impaired virulence of ZtVf1 
mutants attributed to reduced penetration and colonization along with hampered 
pycnidia differentiation. In vitro phenotyping showed that ZtVf1 deletion 
affects hyphal branching and biomass production suggesting that the reduced 
tissue colonization by the ZtVf1 mutant might be due to lower hyphal branching 
and less fungal biomass production. In addition, the majority of infected 
substomatal cavities by the ZtVf1 mutant filled with compacted mycelia mat that 
did not differentiate to mature pycnidia indicating that the impaired 
melanization negatively affected pycnidia formation and maturation. The ZtVf1 
might target multiple genes belonging to different cellular processes whose 
identification is of eminent interest to increase our understanding of this 
pathosystem. Overall, the data provided in this study indicates that attenuated 
pathogenicity of ZtVf1 mutant is due to involvement of this gene in the 
regulation of both early and late stages of infection.

OBJECTIVES: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder that is 
frequently misdiagnosed, resulting in delays in proper treatment. The objective 
of this study was to analyze the cost-utility of training primary care providers 
(PCP) in early and accurate diagnosis of RLS.
METHODS: We used a Markov model to compare two strategies: one where PCPs 
received training to diagnose RLS (informed care) and one where PCPs did not 
receive training (standard care). This analysis was conducted from the US 
societal and health sector perspectives over one-year, five-year, and lifetime 
(50-year) horizons. Costs were adjusted to 2016 USD, utilities measured as 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and both measures were discounted annually 
at 3%. Cost, utilities, and probabilities for the model were obtained through a 
comprehensive review of literature. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) was calculated to interpret our findings at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $100,000/QALY. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted 
to test model uncertainty, in addition to calculating the expected value of 
perfect information.
RESULTS: Providing training to PCPs to correctly diagnose RLS was cost-effective 
since it cost $2021 more and gained 0.44 QALYs per patient over the course of a 
lifetime, resulting in an ICER of $4593/QALY. The model was sensitive to the 
utility for treated and untreated RLS. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
revealed that at $100,000/QALY, informed care had a 65.5% probability of being 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: A program to train PCPs to better diagnose RLS appears to be a 
cost-effective strategy for improving outcomes for RLS patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of 
pharmacotherapy for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a relatively new 
classification of depressive disorder that is characterized by recurrent 
depression during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 49 previously 
untreated PMDD patients who visited our psychiatric department between October 
2013 and February 2016 and received pharmacotherapy for 3 or 6 subsequent 
menstrual cycles. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated across 
individual menstrual cycles using mean EuroQoL-5D values. Direct costs per 
patient were estimated in order to conduct a preliminary cost-effectiveness 
analysis.
RESULTS: Pharmacotherapy produced a 0.190-point increase in mean EuroQoL-5D 
score per menstrual cycle after 6 menstrual cycles and an improvement of 
approximately 0.2 QALYs. Based on direct costs of 156,000 yen per patient, the 
cost-effectiveness of pharmacotherapy was calculated to be 823,000 yen per QALY. 
A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve analysis indicated that escitalopram 
tended to be superior to sertraline when willingness to pay per QALY was over 
4,000,000 yen, whereas sertraline was superior when willingness to pay was below 
2,000,000 yen.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacotherapy is cost effective for the treatment of PMDD. 
Moreover, escitalopram is a more cost-effective option than sertraline when 
willingness to pay is sufficiently high.

BACKGROUND: Traditional end points, such as amputation-free survival, used to 
assess the clinical effectiveness of lower limb revascularization have 
shortcomings because they do not account independently for wound nonhealing and 
recurrence or patient survival. Wound healing process and maintenance of a 
wound-free state after revascularization were not well-studied. The aim of this 
study was to elucidate the long-term clinical course of ischemic wounds after 
revascularization. We focused on initial wound healing process as well as the 
maintenance of a wound-free state after achievement of wound healing. We 
introduced a wound-free period (WFP; the period during which limbs maintained an 
ulcer-free state) and Wound Recurrence and Amputation-free Survival (WRAFS) as 
parameters and tested their effectiveness in evaluating clinical outcomes of 
limbs treated using endovascular therapy (EVT) and surgical revascularization.
METHODS: The medical records of patients developing lower critical limb ischemia 
with tissue loss who underwent surgical or endovascular revascularization of the 
infrainguinal vessels between 2009 and 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. The 
risk factors for achieving wound healing and WRAFS were analyzed using 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression model. Risk factors to prolong 
wound healing time (WHT) and reduce WFP were determined by the least squares 
method.
RESULTS: In total, 233 patients underwent 278 limb revascularizations; 138 
endovascular and 140 surgical procedures were performed as first treatments. The 
proportion of healed wounds 1, 2, and 3 years after primary revascularization 
was 64.0%, 69.7%, and 70.5%, respectively. Significant risk factors for wound 
healing were an EVT-first strategy (risk ratio [RR], 2.47), congestive heart 
failure (RR, 2.05), and wound, ischemia, and foot infection wound grade (RR, 
1.59). The mean WHT was 143.7 days. An EVT-first strategy and wound infection 
contributed to significantly longer WHT. The mean WFP was 711.0 days. An 
EVT-first strategy, history of coronary artery disease, and dialysis dependence 
were associated with significantly shorter WFPs. WRAFS at 1 and 2 years after 
achievement of wound healing were 76.9% and 64.2%, respectively. Significant 
risk factors against WRAFS were a history of coronary artery disease (RR, 1.68), 
dialysis dependence (RR, 2.03), and being wheel chair bound (RR, 1.64).
CONCLUSIONS: EVT revascularization was associated with longer WHT, reduced wound 
healing rate, and a shorter WFP compared with surgical revascularization. wound, 
ischemia, and foot infection grade was associated with longer WHT and reduced 
wound healing rate, but not associated with a shorter WFP. Systemic conditions 
such as dialysis dependence, congestive heart failure, and being wheel chair 
bound were associated with reduced wound healing rate and shorter WFP, 
presumably because they limited life expectancy. WHT and WFP are useful criteria 
for evaluating limb outcomes in patients with critical limb ischemia.

The need to reduce the time it takes to establish a microbiological diagnosis 
and the emergence of new molecular microbiology and proteomic technologies has 
fuelled the development of rapid and point-of-care techniques, as well as the 
so-called point-of-care laboratories. These laboratories are responsible for 
conducting both techniques partially to response to the outsourcing of the 
conventional hospital laboratories. Their introduction has not always been 
accompanied with economic studies that address their cost-effectiveness, 
cost-benefit and cost-utility, but rather tend to be limited to the unit price 
of the test. The latter, influenced by the purchase procedure, does not usually 
have a regulated reference value in the same way that medicines do. The 
cost-effectiveness studies that have recently been conducted on mass 
spectrometry in the diagnosis of bacteraemia and the use of antimicrobials have 
had the greatest clinical impact and may act as a model for future economic 
studies on rapid and point-of-care tests.

Temperature has been associated with population health, but few studies have 
projected the future temperature-related years of life lost attributable to 
climate change. To project future temperature-related disease burden in Tianjin, 
we selected years of life lost (YLL) as the dependent variable to explore YLL 
attributable to climate change. A generalized linear model (GLM) and distributed 
lag non-linear model were combined to assess the non-linear and delayed effects 
of temperature on the YLL of non-accidental mortality. Then, we calculated the 
YLL changes attributable to future climate scenarios in 2055 and 2090. The 
relationships of daily mean temperature with the YLL of non-accident mortality 
were basically U-shaped. Both the daily mean temperature increase on 
high-temperature days and its drop on low-temperature days caused an increase of 
YLL and non-accidental deaths. The temperature-related YLL will worsen if future 
climate change exceeds 2 °C. In addition, the adverse effects of extreme 
temperature on YLL occurred more quickly than that of the overall temperature. 
The impact of low temperature was greater than that of high temperature. Men 
were vulnerable to high temperature compared with women. This analysis 
highlights that the government should formulate environmental policies to reach 
the Paris Agreement goal.
