INTRODUCTION: Because of the application of ionising radiation in surgical 
procedures, it is necessary to perform an evaluation of the radiological risks. 
Potential hazards are of greater influence in paediatric patients, due to their 
longer life expectancy and greater radiosensibility. The aim of this paper was, 
with the exception of deterministic injuries, trying to evaluate patient doses 
and stochastic risks induced by ionising radiations in paediatric pieloureteral 
surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty paediatric patients of both sexes, from 2 months to 
9 years, were included in the study. All the procedures were performed in 2006 
and 2007. The X-Ray equipment shows fluoroscopy time and dose area product in 
each procedure, thermoluminiscent dosimeters (TLD's) measure patient's skin dose 
and non screen films verify the radiated field and dose.
RESULTS: The average effective dose per minute was 0.36 mSv for patients under 
5-year-old and 0.43 mSv for over 5. These figures were lower than previously 
published results for this kind of surgery. The average total risk of fatal 
cancer induction in any location, for each study group, was 0.012%. Maximum skin 
dose was 19.81 mGy, which is well bellow the threshold for deterministic 
injuries (2 Gy).
CONCLUSIONS: Although stochastic risks were small, it's highly recommended to 
employ all the available methods and techniques developed for patient 
radiological protection. A strong coordination between team members is advisable 
for improving the dose optimization.

women with optimally resected stage III ovarian cancer: a Gynecologic Oncology 
Group study.

PURPOSE: To determine the cost effectiveness of intraperitoneal versus 
intravenous regimens for adjuvant treatment of optimally resected stage III 
ovarian cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A decision model was developed to compare the cost 
effectiveness at 7-, 11.5-, and 35-year horizons of intravenous carboplatin and 
paclitaxel (IV-CARBO/PAC), intravenous cisplatin and paclitaxel (IV-CIS/PAC), or 
intravenous paclitaxel followed by intraperitoneal cisplatin and paclitaxel 
(IP-CIS/PAC). Survival data were from women participating in representative 
Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocols. Medicare reimbursement rates and the 
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Database were used to estimate costs 
for treatment regimens and grade 3 to 4 adverse effects, respectively.
RESULTS: Median predicted survival was 66, 57, 51, and 48 months for IP-CIS/PAC, 
IV-CARBO/PAC, IV-CIS/PAC (GOG 172), or IV-CIS/PAC (GOG 158), respectively. 
Across a range of analyses, IV-CIS/PAC was more costly and had lower life 
expectancy than IV-CARBO/PAC. Compared with IV-CARBO/PAC, IP-CIS/PAC had an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $180,022 per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) saved at a 7-year time horizon, $71,835/QALY at 11.5 years, and 
$32,053/QALY over a lifetime. Extending the survival advantage of IP-CIS/PAC 
over 11.5 years and a lifetime results in ICERs of $26,249 and $23,973, 
respectively. Assuming IP-CIS/PAC and IV-CIS/PAC were equally effective when 
administered on an outpatient basis, the ICER of IP-CIS/PAC compared with 
IV-CARBO/PAC was $26,311.
CONCLUSION: Inpatient IP-CIS/PAC, while not cost effective compared with 
IV-CARBO/PAC at 7 years, becomes cost effective if a longer time horizon is 
modeled and/or a survival benefit can be assumed to persist longer than 
currently available data. Outpatient IP-CIS/PAC may also be cost effective 
compared with IV-CARBO/PAC if proven as effective as inpatient IP-CIS/PAC.

Life extension, overpopulation and the right to life: against lethal ethics.

Cutas DE(1).

Some of the objections to life-extension stem from a concern with 
overpopulation. I will show that whether or not the overpopulation threat is 
realistic, arguments from overpopulation cannot ethically demand halting the 
quest for, nor access to, life-extension. The reason for this is that we have a 
right to life, which entitles us not to have meaningful life denied to us 
against our will and which does not allow discrimination solely on the grounds 
of age. If the threat of overpopulation creates a rights conflict between the 
right to come into existence, the right to reproduce, the right to more 
opportunities and space (if, indeed, these rights can be successfully defended), 
and the right to life, the latter ought to be given precedence.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the 10-year survival of a large number of elderly 
patients who underwent spine surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis, and to identify 
significant risk factors and compare them with age- and gender-matched controls 
from the general population.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There have been many studies on treatment options 
and surgical outcomes for lumbar spinal stenosis. However, survival outcomes 
after lumbar spinal stenosis surgery have not previously been studied. Because 
these operations are usually performed for elderly patients, we consider patient 
survival or life expectancy to be a significant outcome measure.
METHODS: Between January 1997 and June 2006, patients underwent spine surgery 
for lumbar spinal stenosis. The date of death was verified using records from 
the National Health Insurance Corporation. Cumulative 10-year survival was 
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the survival of patients who had 
undergone spine surgery was compared to that of age- and sex-matched members of 
the general population. A Cox multivariate regression analysis was used in order 
to compare the survival rates for different covariates.
RESULTS: Using Kaplan-Meier curves, the overall 10-year survival was 87.8% in 
patients 60 to 70 years old at surgery, and 83.8% in patients 70 to 85 years old 
at surgery. The 10-year survival rate of female patients and patients who 
underwent fusion surgery were higher than those of male patients and patients 
with nonfusion surgery. Compared to the adjusted corresponding portion in 
general population, the standardized mortality ratios were 0.21, 0.53, and 0.45 
in patients aged 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 to 85, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Elderly patients who underwent spine surgery for spinal stenosis had 
reduced mortality compared to the corresponding portion of the general 
population. Therefore, surgery for spinal stenosis is a justifiable procedure 
even in elderly patients.

PNZIP gene promoter has been cloned from Pharbitis nil by adaptor PCR, which 
conforms to eukaryotic promoter characteristic. Primer extension analysis showed 
that the transcription start site was located 122 nucleotides upstream of the 
translation start site of PNZIP gene. According to the characteristic of PNZIP 
promoter, a series of deletions were purposely made by PCR. Five deletion 
fragments were fused to upstream of GUS gene and transferred into tobacco. 
Fluorometric GUS assay showed that five different length promoters all could 
specifically drive GUS gene expression in photosynthetic tissues and their 
activities decreased along with the gradual deletion of PNZIP promoter. In 
addition, the activity of full-length promoter was 9 times higher than that of 
CaMV 35S in leaf. PNZIP promoter may have two putative cis-elements, GAAATA and 
GATACT, which relate to gene expression in photosynthetic tissues. GATACT may 
determine the gene specific expression in photosynthetic tissues, while GAAATA, 
perhaps, as an enhancer, increases the intensity of gene expression.

[Obesity - principles of surgical therapy].

[Article in German]

The prevalence of obesity and the number of surgeries for morbid obesity are 
increasing worldwide. Conservative therapy is largely ineffective in producing 
maintenance of weight loss in morbidly obese patients, and surgery is therefore 
increasingly considered as the only available option for these patients. Until 
approximately 15 years ago, many patients and physicians regarded bariatric 
surgery as dangerous because it required a large laparotomy and was associated 
with a relatively high risk of complications. Since laparoscopic techniques have 
become available, however, the number of patients referred for surgery has been 
increasing steadily. The principles of standard procedures are independent of 
access, whether open or laparoscopic. The pathophysiologic mechanisms are 
restriction, malabsorption, or a combination of both. New findings in the field 
of endocrine and humoral regulations have shown that surgical procedures can 
induce complex changes in the regulation of enterohormones. These mechanisms are 
the basis for metabolic effects, especially in cases of diabetes mellitus type 
2. Obesity surgery is known to be the most effective and longest-lasting 
treatment for morbid obesity and many related conditions, but mounting evidence 
now suggests that it may also be among the most effective treatments for 
metabolic diseases and conditions such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, high 
cholesterol, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. 
Surgery for severe obesity goes far beyond weight loss; benefits include 
improved quality of life and extended life expectancy.

It is often claimed that from the moment of conception embryos have the same 
moral status as adult humans. This claim plays a central role in many arguments 
against abortion, in vitro fertilization, and stem cell research. In what 
follows, I show that this claim leads directly to an unexpected and unwelcome 
conclusion: that natural embryo loss is one of the greatest problems of our time 
and that we must do almost everything in our power to prevent it. I examine the 
responses available to those who hold that embryos have full moral status and 
conclude that they cannot avoid the force of this argument without giving up 
this key claim.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that smoking cessation after a cardiac 
event reduces the risk of subsequent mortality in patients, but the effect of 
smoking cessation in terms of prolonged life-years is not yet known.
METHODS: We analyzed the 30-year clinical outcome of the first 1,041 consecutive 
patients (age at operation 51 years, 92% male) who successfully underwent 
isolated venous coronary artery bypass surgery between 1971 and 1980. All 551 
smokers (53%) were included in this study. Of these, 43% stopped smoking 
throughout the first year whereas 57% persisted smoking.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 29 years (range 26-36 years). The cumulative 
10-, 20-, and 30-year survival rates were 88%, 49%, and 19%, respectively, in 
the group of patients who quit smoking, and only 77%, 36%, and 11%, 
respectively, in the persistent smokers (P < .0001). After adjusting for all 
baseline characteristics, smoking cessation remained an independent predictor of 
lower mortality (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.48-0.72). We were able to assess 
the exact life expectancy by calculating the area under the Kaplan-Meier curves. 
Life expectancy in the quitters was 20.0 years and 17.0 years in the persistent 
smokers (P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Using 30-year follow-up data, we estimated that self-reported 
smoking cessation after coronary artery bypass surgery was associated with a 
life expectancy gain of 3 years. Smoking cessation turned out to have a greater 
effect on reducing the risk of mortality than the effect of any other 
intervention or treatment.

Inuit people inhabit the circumpolar region, with most living in Alaska, 
northwest Canada, and Greenland. Although malignant diseases were believed to be 
almost non-existent in Inuit populations during the beginning of the 20th 
century, the increasing life expectancy within these populations showed a 
distinct pattern, characterised by a high risk of Epstein-Barr virus-associated 
carcinomas of the nasopharynx and salivary glands, and a low risk of tumours 
common in white populations, including cancer of the prostate, testis, and 
haemopoietic system. Both genetic and environmental factors seem to be 
responsible for this pattern. During the second half of the 20th century, Inuit 
societies underwent major changes in lifestyle and living conditions, and the 
risk of lifestyle-associated tumours, especially cancers of the lung, colon, and 
breast, increased considerably after changes in smoking, diet, and reproductive 
factors. This Review will briefly summarise the current knowledge on cancer 
epidemiology in Inuit populations, with emphasis on the characteristic Inuit 
types of cancer.

USA.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: While management programmes (MPs) for chronic heart failure 
(CHF) are clinically effective, their cost-effectiveness remains uncertain. 
Thus, this study sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of MPs.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a Markov model to estimate life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime costs, and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness of MPs as compared to standard care. Standard care was 
defined by the EuroHeart Failure Survey for Germany, MP efficacy was derived 
from our recent meta-analysis and cost estimates were based on the German 
healthcare system. For a population with a mean age 67 years (35% female) at 
onset of CHF, our model predicted an average quality-adjusted life expectancy of 
2.64 years for standard care and 2.83 years for MP. MP yielded additional 
lifetime costs of euro1700 resulting in an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) 
of euro8900 (95% CI: dominant to 177,100) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the ICUR was sensitive to age and 
sex.
CONCLUSION: MPs increase life expectancy in patients with CHF by an average of 
84 days and increase lifetime cost of care by approximately euro1700. MPs 
improve outcomes in a cost-effective manner, although they are not cost-saving 
on a lifetime horizon.

Linköping, Sweden. Urban.Alehagen@IHS.liu.se

BACKGROUND: When assessing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in elderly 
patients with heart failure (HF), the process of obtaining quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) weights is generally complicated and time-consuming.
AIM: To evaluate whether information regarding HRQoL and QALY weights can be 
derived directly from the established and widely used New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) functional classification system.
METHODS: NYHA functional status was assessed independently both by the 
individual patients and by the examining cardiologist in 323 elderly patients 
with symptoms of HF recruited from primary care. HRQoL was evaluated using the 
SF-36 questionnaire and a time trade-off (TTO) scenario. The TTO technique 
generates direct QALY weights.
RESULTS: Both the TTO technique and SF-36 values demonstrated a statistically 
significant correlation with NYHA functional status. The TTO values also 
correlated with all SF-36 dimensions. Increasing impairment was associated with 
statistically significant drops in both SF-36 values and TTO-based QALY weights. 
For patients in NYHA classes I-IV the QALY weights were 0.77, 0.68, 0.61, and 
0.50, respectively. Thus in elderly patients, symptoms of HF have a major impact 
on perceived quality of life.
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that QALY weights, an 
important instrument in the health economic evaluation of treatment strategies, 
can be derived directly from NYHA classification in elderly HF patients.

Abnormal joint torque patterns exhibited by chronic stroke subjects while 
walking with a prescribed physiological gait pattern.

Rehabilitation Hospital, Washington, DC 20010, USA. ndn3@georgetown.edu

BACKGROUND: It is well documented that individuals with chronic stroke often 
exhibit considerable gait impairments that significantly impact their quality of 
life. While stroke subjects often walk asymmetrically, we sought to investigate 
whether prescribing near normal physiological gait patterns with the use of the 
Lokomat robotic gait-orthosis could help ameliorate asymmetries in gait, 
specifically, promote similar ankle, knee, and hip joint torques in both lower 
extremities. We hypothesized that hemiparetic stroke subjects would demonstrate 
significant differences in total joint torques in both the frontal and sagittal 
planes compared to non-disabled subjects despite walking under normal gait 
kinematic trajectories.
METHODS: A motion analysis system was used to track the kinematic patterns of 
the pelvis and legs of 10 chronic hemiparetic stroke subjects and 5 age matched 
controls as they walked in the Lokomat. The subject's legs were attached to the 
Lokomat using instrumented shank and thigh cuffs while instrumented footlifters 
were applied to the impaired foot of stroke subjects to aid with foot clearance 
during swing. With minimal body-weight support, subjects walked at 2.5 km/hr on 
an instrumented treadmill capable of measuring ground reaction forces. Through a 
custom inverse dynamics model, the ankle, knee, and hip joint torques were 
calculated in both the frontal and sagittal planes. A single factor ANOVA was 
used to investigate differences in joint torques between control, unimpaired, 
and impaired legs at various points in the gait cycle.
RESULTS: While the kinematic patterns of the stroke subjects were quite similar 
to those of the control subjects, the kinetic patterns were very different. 
During stance phase, the unimpaired limb of stroke subjects produced greater hip 
extension and knee flexion torques than the control group. At pre-swing, stroke 
subjects inappropriately extended their impaired knee, while during swing they 
tended to abduct their impaired leg, both being typical abnormal torque synergy 
patterns common to stroke gait.
CONCLUSION: Despite the Lokomat guiding stroke subjects through physiologically 
symmetric kinematic gait patterns, abnormal asymmetric joint torque patterns are 
still generated. These differences from the control group are characteristic of 
the hip hike and circumduction strategy employed by stroke subjects.

Marienhof, Koblenz, Germany. e.savvas@kk-koblenz.de

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the economic viability of 
stapes surgery in Germany. We compared the cost of the operation to the retail 
value and average cost of a lifelong supply of hearing aids.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTING: Tertiary referral centre.
PATIENTS: One hundred and sixty-four consecutive cases of primary stapedotomy 
performed on patients with otosclerosis at our institution served as the 
representative group for the calculation. The post-operative air-bone gap 
average at the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz was less than 10 dB for 
62 per cent of the patients, and less than 20 dB for 92 per cent of the 
patients. There was a post-operative sensorineural hearing loss in 1.2 per cent 
of the patients.
RESULTS: Analysis showed that, even for an elderly patient aged 65 years with a 
life expectancy of 15 years, the cost of a lifelong supply of hearing aids was 
greater than that of a stapedotomy procedure. Based on our group of patients, 
the stapedotomy procedure proved to be euro 800,000 K cheaper than treatment 
with an averagely priced hearing aid. The economic benefit was still present 
when taking into account possible revision surgery in 5-10 per cent of cases, 
and also when, in addition to the surgery, a post-operative hearing aid was 
required, in for example 20 per cent of cases.
CONCLUSION: Stapes surgery is economically beneficial for the individual patient 
as well as for the general patient cohort, irrespective of age. The stapedotomy 
procedure also prevents the known disadvantages of conventional hearing aids, 
thus improving the patient's quality of life.

INTRODUCTION: For many years life expectancy in Denmark has improved less than 
in other comparable western countries, e.g. Sweden. An unhealthy life style, in 
particular the consumption of alcohol and tobacco, has often been mentioned as a 
possible explanation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Life expectancy and mortality in Denmark and Sweden has 
been compared by means of nationwide cause of death registries. Alcohol- and 
tobacco-related deaths are defined from death certificate diagnoses. The 
comparisons between the two countries are made by age standardised mortality 
rates and life expectancies for the period 1997-2001.
RESULTS: 50 years ago Denmark had one of the highest life expectancies in the 
world, but is now at the bottom of the list when compared to similar countries. 
Life expectancy in Sweden is now almost three years longer than in Denmark. 
Before the age of 75 there were a total of 3700 premature deaths among Danish 
men and 3400 among Danish women. Relative excess mortality was highest among 
Danish men aged 35-64 with a relative excess mortality at 40-50%. Among women 
excess mortality was 50-60% in the age group 35-74 years. Overall, alcohol and 
smoking account for almost the entire difference between Danish and Swedish men 
and for 75% of the difference between Danish and Swedish women.
CONCLUSION: A very substantial part of the Danish excess mortality and low life 
expectancy compared to Sweden can be attributed to high mortality related to 
alcohol and tobacco consumption. A reduction of this difference in life 
expectancy does not seem realistic without a reduction in the consumption of 
tobacco and alcohol.

BACKGROUND: At 30 days, it is recognized that 12-hour periprocedural abciximab 
infusion protects against reinfarction and the need for revascularization in 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in acute myocardial infarction (MI). 
However, it is controversial whether the benefit to patients continues or fades 
away subsequently. We investigate whether abciximab provides a persistent 
advantage in terms of life-years gained in large trials of abciximab in PCI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified four eligible randomized, controlled studies 
of PCI and adjunctive abciximab therapy in acute MI enrolling a total of 3,183 
patients. Using the published time course of survival, we calculated the 
life-years gained at a series of time points over the following year. The 
weighted mean value and standard error for life-years gained at 1 year was 
0.0034 +/- 0.0005. For abciximab-treated patients, life-years gained increases 
non-linearly for the first 90 days (gain = y = 0.003t(2) + 0.0016t - 3E-05; R(2) 
= 0.998; p < 0.05 for non-linear term) then linearly thereafter (gain = y = 
0.004t - 0.0005; R(2) = 0.9998). The "number needed to treat" to gain 1 
life-year is twenty-fold lower at the 1-year time point than at the 60-day time 
point.
CONCLUSION: When viewed across trials, benefit to the patient in terms of gain 
in life-years grows, rather than shrinks, with the passage of months. Initially, 
growth is significantly greater than linear, suggesting that a single 
periprocedural infusion continues to help prevent events from occurring up to 3 
months post procedure. Evaluation of benefit at early time points may therefore 
underestimate the benefit of abciximab.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: As the mean life expectancy rises, the incidence of 
patients 75 years of age and older who present with colorectal liver metastases 
continues to increase. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the outcome of 
major hepatic resections in the elderly population.
PATIENT AND METHODS: From April 1998 to December 2006, 572 consecutive patients 
with colorectal liver metastases were treated at our Institution. Of these, 59 
were 75 years or older. There was an intent to proceed with major liver 
resections in all cases. Data were analyzed according to diagnosis, 
comorbidities, extent of liver resection, postoperative complications, overall 
survival, and disease-free survival.
RESULTS: Surgical treatment included right hepatectomies (n = 8), left 
hepatectomies (n = 4), and sectionectomies (more than three segments; n = 33). 
Fourteen (n = 14) patients received an explorative laparotomy alone. Morbidity 
and hospital mortality were 10% and 3%, respectively. Overall survival of 1, 3, 
and 5 years was 90%, 64%, and 33%, respectively. The corresponding disease-free 
survival was 74%, 42%, and 32%. Resection margin (R class) was the only 
predictor of survival by both uni- and multivariate analyses.
CONCLUSION: Hepatic resections can be performed safely in selected patients 75 
years of age or older.

H-transfers in Photosystem II: what can we learn from recent lessons in the 
enzyme community?

University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. Sam.Hay@manchester.ac.uk

Over the last 10 years, studies of enzyme systems have demonstrated that, in 
many cases, H-transfers occur by a quantum mechanical tunneling mechanism 
analogous to long-range electron transfer. H-transfer reactions can be described 
by an extension of Marcus theory and, by substituting hydrogen with deuterium 
(or even tritium), it is possible to explore this theory in new ways by 
employing kinetic isotope effects. Because hydrogen has a relatively short 
deBroglie wavelength, H-transfers are controlled by the width of the reaction 
barrier. By coupling protein dynamics to the reaction coordinate, enzymes have 
the potential ability to facilitate more efficient H-tunneling by modulating 
barrier properties. In this review, we describe recent advances in both 
experimental and theoretical studies of enzymatic H-transfer, in particular the 
role of protein dynamics or promoting motions. We then discuss possible 
consequences with regard to tyrosine oxidation/reduction kinetics in Photosystem 
II.

The purpose of this research was to investigate phosphorus (P) retention 
capacity and rejuvenation potential of electric arc furnace (EAF) steel slag 
from Quebec and New Zealand (NZ) iron melter slag (IMS). Columns filled with 
slag materials were fed with dairy effluent and subjected to two feeding and one 
resting cycle(s). P retention capacities and rejuvenation potentials were 
determined after each feeding cycle. Elemental composition and mineralogical 
analysis were performed on IMS samples. Finally, chemical fractionation analysis 
was conducted on both NZ IMS and Quebec EAF steel slags. The results revealed 
that initiating a resting period in EAF steel slag filters prior to reaching 
their P saturation point increased the overall filter P retention capacity by 
49.5 and 42.4% compared to 28% in a filter which had its resting period 
initiated after reaching P saturation. The rejuvenation property could play a 
significant role in full-scale applications by prolonging life expectancy and 
increasing cost efficiency. P retention and rejuvenation by NZ slag materials 
was negligible relative to EAF steel slag material from Quebec. Chemical 
fractionation analysis revealed differences between materials, indicating that 
the highest quantities of P were bound to Ca and Fe in EAF steel slag and to Ca 
and Al fractions in iron melter slag. This study also demonstrates that slag's 
performance is dependent on the source of the material and the steel making 
practices. Therefore, testing of the P adsorptive capability and, if relevant, 
the rejuvenation potential of individual steel mill slags, should be a 
prerequisite prior to their use in field applications.

The NICE cost-effectiveness threshold: what it is and what that means.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has been using 
a cost-effectiveness threshold range between 20,000 pound sterling and 30,000 
pound sterling for over 7 years. What the cost-effectiveness threshold 
represents, what the appropriate level is for NICE to use, and what the other 
factors are that NICE should consider have all been the subject of much 
discussion. In this article, we briefly review these questions, provide a 
critical assessment of NICE's utilization of the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) threshold to inform its guidance, and suggest ways in which NICE's 
utilization of the ICER threshold could be developed to promote the efficient 
use of health service resources. We conclude that it is feasible and probably 
desirable to operate an explicit single threshold rather than the current range; 
the threshold should be seen as a threshold at which 'other' criteria beyond the 
ICER itself are taken into account; interventions with a large budgetary impact 
may need to be subject to a lower threshold as they are likely to displace more 
than the marginal activities; reimbursement at the threshold transfers the full 
value of an innovation to the manufacturer. Positive decisions above the 
threshold on the grounds of innovation reduce population health; the value of 
the threshold should be reconsidered regularly to ensure that it captures the 
impact of changes in efficiency and budget over time; the use of equity weights 
to sustain a positive recommendation when the ICER is above the threshold 
requires knowledge of the equity characteristics of those patients who bear the 
opportunity cost. Given the barriers to obtaining this knowledge and knowledge 
about the characteristics of typical beneficiaries of UK NHS care, caution is 
warranted before accepting claims from special pleaders; uncertainty in the 
evidence base should not be used to justify a positive recommendation when the 
ICER is above the threshold. The development of a programme of disinvestment 
guidance would enable NICE and the NHS to be more confident that the net health 
benefit of the Technology Appraisal Programme is positive.

Estimating 'costs' for cost-effectiveness analysis.

of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK. alec.miners@lshtm.ac.uk

Since 1999, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 
Technology Appraisal Programme has been charged with producing guidance for the 
NHS in England and Wales on the appropriate use of new and existing healthcare 
programmes. Guidance is based on an assessment of a number of factors, including 
cost effectiveness. The identification, measurement and valuation of costs are 
important components of any cost-effectiveness analysis. However, working 
through these steps raises a number of important methodological questions. For 
example, how should 'future' resource use be estimated, and is there a need to 
consider all 'future' costs? Given that NICE produces national guidance, should 
national unit cost data be used to value resources or should local variations in 
negotiated prices be taken into account? This paper was initially prepared as a 
briefing paper as part of the process of updating NICE's 2004 Guide to the 
Methods of Technology Appraisal for a workshop on 'costs'. It outlines the 
issues that were raised in the original briefing paper and the subsequent 
questions that were discussed at the workshop.

During the past century, humans have gained more years of average life 
expectancy than in the last 10,000 years; we are now living in a rapidly ageing 
world. The sharp rise in life expectancy, coupled to a steady decline in birth 
rates in all developed countries, has led to an unprecedented demographic 
revolution characterized by an explosive growth in the number and proportion of 
older people. Ageing is a complex process that negatively impacts the 
development of the immune system and its ability to function. Progressive 
changes in the T and B cell systems over the life span have a major impact on 
the capacity to respond to immune challenge. These cumulative age-associated 
changes in immune competence are termed Immunosenescence: some immunological 
parameters are commonly notably reduced in the elderly and, reciprocally good 
function is tightly correlated to health status. Hence, a better understanding 
of Immunosenescence and the development of new strategies to counteract it are 
essential for improving the quality of life of the elderly population.

Microanatomical evidences for potential of mesenchymal stem cells in 
amelioration of striatal degeneration.

Huntington's disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder, characterized 
by loss of spiny neurons in the striatum and cortex, which usually happens in 
the third or fourth decades of life. In advanced form of the disease, 
progressive striatum atrophy happens and medium spiny neurons, which occupy more 
than 80% of the striatum, become atrophic. Gradually, the atrophy expands to the 
neocortex and other regions of the brain. To our knowledge, there is no 
effective therapeutic strategy for diminishing the motor disorders of 
Huntington's disease. In recent years, cellular transplantation has been an 
effective therapeutic method for neurodegenerative diseases. In the present 
study, the potential of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells in 
amelioration of striatal degeneration was assessed in animal model of 
Huntington's disease. After unilateral lesion in striatum was caused by 
quinolinic acid (QA), bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, which were 
isolated and purified from 4-6 weeks old rats, were transplanted into the 
damaged striatum. After 9 weeks of transplantation, the volume of striatum, 
lateral ventricles and hemispheres were measured in control (normal) and test 
(QA injected + cell transplanted) groups. After volume determination, the 
atrophy percentage of both striatum and damaged hemisphere and volume extension 
of lateral ventricles were calculated. Histologic results showed significant 
difference in amount of striatum atrophy between sham (only QA injected) and 
test groups. These results confirm the potential of bone marrow derived 
mesenchymal stem cells in treatment of microanatomical defects in motor 
disorders of Huntington's disease. According to our results, cell therapy by 
means of bone marrow derived adult stem cells could be considered as a good 
candidate for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Huntington's 
disease.

Dentistry in Japan should become a specialty of medicine with dentists educated 
as oral physicians.

In Japan, the population of elderly individuals (those sixty-five years of age 
and older) will increase to over 30 percent of the total population by 2030. The 
elderly commonly have chronic diseases that result in individuals being 
biologically and pharmacologically compromised. Dentists must have a reliable 
knowledge of basic clinical medicine for these individuals to be safely and 
effectively treated. The isolation of dental education from medical education 
may have been advantageous in the past for the development of dentistry as a 
profession; however, changes in people's life expectancy and lifestyles, as well 
as rapid advances in the biomedical sciences, require dentists to have a 
thorough foundation in biomedical science and clinical medicine not dissimilar 
from a physician in any other field of medicine. A reformation of dental 
education is necessary if optimum oral health care is to be provided for 
patients in the future. It is thus advocated that dentistry should become one 
specialty of medicine known as oral medicine, and we propose that the education 
of dentists should be modified to produce oral physicians.

Belgium. sjoerd.klaver@uzleuven.be

OBJECTIVES. To review the natural history and biological potential of small 
renal masses in order to evaluate surveillance as a treatment option. METHODS. 
Literature search of Medline and additional references from non-Medline-indexed 
publications concerning surveillance of small renal masses. RESULTS. The natural 
history and biological potential of small renal masses can still not be 
unambiguously predicted at present. There seems to be no clear correlation 
between tumour size and presence of benign histology. The majority of small 
renal masses grow and the majority are cancer, but one cannot safely assume that 
a lack of growth on serial CT scans is the confirmation of absence of 
malignancy. Needle core biopsies could be used to help in decision making. They 
show a high accuracy for histopathological tumour type but are less accurate in 
evaluating Fuhrman grade. CONCLUSIONS. At present, surveillance of small renal 
masses should only be considered in elderly and/or infirm patients with 
competing health risks, in those with a limited life expectancy, and in those 
for whom minimal invasive treatment or surgery is not an option. In all other 
patients, active surveillance should only be considered in the context of a 
study protocol. Long-term, prospective studies are needed to provide a more 
accurate assessment of the natural history and metastastic potential of small 
renal masses.

graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic versus autologous bone marrow 
transplantation in children.

BACKGROUND: Late-onset noninfectious pulmonary complications (LONIPCs) are 
life-threatening complications of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Several 
pathological patterns are described in the literature with different prognoses, 
and with different relationships to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The role 
of high-resolution CT (HRCT) is not yet well established.
OBJECTIVE: To illustrate different patterns of LONIPCs on HRCT in allogeneic 
versus autologous BMT in order to investigate the correlation with chronic GVHD 
(cGVHD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 67 HRCT scans were performed in 24 patients 
with noninfectious pulmonary disease at least 3 months after BMT (16 allogeneic, 
8 autologous). Abnormality patterns and extension on HRCT images were correlated 
with the clinical outcome and with the severity of cGVHD.
RESULTS: Of 24 patients, 9 showed LONIPCs (1 autologous, 8 allogeneic). There 
was a significant association between abnormalities on HRCT and severe cGVHD (P 
= 0.038), with no specific pattern. Prognosis seemed to be related to the 
severity of cGVHD and not to the extent of abnormalities on HRCT.
CONCLUSION: The significant association between abnormalities on HRCT and severe 
GVHD suggests that LONIPCs can be a pulmonary manifestation of the disease. HRCT 
is a useful tool when combined with clinical data.

The cost-effectiveness of treatment with erythropoietin compared to red blood 
cell transfusions for patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia: a Markov 
model.

Author information:
(1)The Swedish Institute for Health Economics (IHE), Lund, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Anaemia is a common complication of chemotherapy. As anaemia can 
lead to e.g. fatigue, depression, social isolation and chest pain it diminishes 
physical capacity and quality of life. It is generally accepted that symptomatic 
anaemia should be corrected. Treatment options include red blood cell 
transfusion (RBCT), erythropoietin (EPO) administration or a combination of 
both.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to carry out a cost-effectiveness 
analysis of treatment with EPO (epoetin alfa), compared to treatment with RBCT 
for patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia in Sweden from a health care 
perspective.
METHOD: A model was developed for estimating incremental costs and QALY gains 
associated with EPO treatment compared to treatment with RBCTs, based on a model 
commissioned by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and 
adjusted to reflect Swedish treatment practice. Data regarding patient 
characteristics, response rates, and RBCT was derived from a Swedish 
observational study of EPO treatment in cancer patients with chemotherapy 
related anaemia. Swedish guidelines and unit costs were used throughout the 
study. A systematic review of EPO for treatment of anaemia associated with 
cancer was used to estimate QALY gains associated with changes in 
Hb-concentrations in our model.
RESULTS: The model's results validate well to real world data from three major
