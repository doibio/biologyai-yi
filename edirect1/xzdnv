OBJECTIVES: The claim of a right to pain relief was made in recent decades by 
pain professionals, courts, and patient advocacy groups and likely contributed 
to increased opioid prescribing, overdose deaths, and addictions, but the 
origins and nature of this right have not been investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant clinical, ethical, and legal literature 
concerning patient rights to pain care was reviewed.
RESULTS: The record describes the effort to improve end-of-life and cancer pain 
care in the 1980s and 1990s, which simultaneously legitimated pain relief as an 
independent goal of medical care and opioids as a safe and effective means to 
achieve this relief. In 1997, the US Supreme Court denied the right to assisted 
suicide but affirmed a right to palliative care to prevent dying in overwhelming 
pain. Other guidelines and regulations extended this right to pain relief from 
end-of-life care to chronic pain care, along with the titrate-to-effect 
principle, which specified that the correct opioid dose was the dose that 
relieved pain.
DISCUSSION: The most important consequence of combining the right to pain relief 
with the titrate-to-effect principle was the idea that a high pain score must 
not be ignored. This extension of the right to pain relief neglected important 
differences between end-of-life care and chronic pain care including: time 
frame, clinical setting and context, target of titration, and nature of 
iatrogenic harms. To help end our current opioid epidemic and prevent a future 
epidemic, we need to demedicalize pain and reintegrate it with the rest of human 
suffering as an experience connected to other personal behaviors and meanings.

program at Seton Hall University in Nutley, N.J. Roderick S. Hooker is a health 
policy analyst. Jennifer M. Coombs is an associate professor in the PA program 
at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The authors have disclosed no 
potential conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise.

This economic analysis of physician assistant/associate (PA) career earnings 
sought to assess the increasing effect of student debt, its potential effect on 
job selection, and whether such financial obligations may influence graduates to 
select higher-paying specialties. The model was a 30-year-old newly graduated PA 
who begins working in family medicine. A simulation included wages, student 
debt, national household expenditures, and real estate statistics. The scenario 
consisted of a high and middle cost of living in two geographic areas, a family 
of four, and an average life expectancy. Using a validated economic program, a 
series of calculations produced the financial effect on moderate-income levels 
and expenditures based on median PA earnings. On the deficit side is education 
debt, loan repayment, financing a house, college for children, retirement, and 
discretionary spending. Weighted variables were used to maximize the sensitivity 
effect of the simulation. A Monte Carlo probabilistic program predicted the 
likely outcome of income, expenses, inflation, and investments. Furthermore, the 
lifetime earnings of a PA who retires at age 67 years and lives to age 85 years 
falls in the 75th percentile of income of all Americans. The conclusion is that 
a full-time PA career in any clinical role is as economically rewarding as it is 
satisfying.

BACKGROUND: The Australian Government recently established sodium targets for 
packaged foods to encourage voluntary reformulation to reduce population sodium 
consumption and related diseases. We modeled the health impact of Australia's 
sodium reformulation targets and additional likely health gains if more 
ambitious, yet feasible sodium targets had been adopted instead.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using comparative risk assessment models, we estimated the 
averted deaths, incidence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and stomach cancer 
after implementation of (a) Australia's sodium targets (overall and by 
individual companies); (b) United Kingdom's targets (that covers more product 
categories); and (c) an optimistic scenario (sales-weighted 25th percentile 
sodium content for each food category included in the UK program). We used 
nationally representative data to estimate pre- and post-intervention sodium 
intake, and other key data sources from the Global Burden of Disease study. Full 
compliance with the Australian government's sodium targets could prevent 
approximately 510 deaths/year (95% UI, 335 to 757), corresponding to about 1% of 
CVD, CKD, and stomach cancer deaths, and prevent some 1,920 (1,274 to 2,600) new 
cases and 7,240 (5,138 to 10,008) DALYs/year attributable to these diseases. 
Over half (59%) of deaths prevented is attributed to reformulation by 5 
market-dominant companies. Compliance with the UK and optimistic scenario could 
avert approximately an additional 660 (207 to 1,227) and 1,070 (511 to 1,856) 
deaths/year, respectively, compared to Australia's targets. The main limitation 
of this study (like other modeling studies) is that it does not prove that 
sodium reformulation programs will prevent deaths and disease events; rather, it 
provides the best quantitative estimates and the corresponding uncertainty of 
the potential effect of the different programs to guide the design of policies.
CONCLUSIONS: There is significant potential to strengthen Australia's sodium 
reformulation targets to improve its health impact. Promoting compliance by 
market-dominant food companies will be critical to achieving the potential 
health gains.

BACKGROUND: People living with severe mental illness (SMI) have a reduced life 
expectancy by around 15-20 years, in part due to higher rates of long-term 
conditions (LTCs) such as diabetes and heart disease. Evidence suggests that 
people with SMI experience difficulties managing their physical health. Little 
is known, however, about the barriers, facilitators and strategies for 
self-management of LTCs for people with SMI.
AIM: To systematically review and synthesise the qualitative evidence exploring 
facilitators, barriers and strategies for self-management of physical health in 
adults with SMI, both with and without long-term conditions.
METHODS: CINAHL, Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science, HMIC, Medline, 
NICE Evidence and PsycInfo were searched to identify qualitative studies that 
explored barriers, facilitators and strategies for self-management in adults 
with SMI (with or without co-morbid LTCs). Articles were screened independently 
by two independent reviewers. Eligible studies were purposively sampled for 
synthesis according to the richness and relevance of data, and thematically 
synthesised.
RESULTS: Seventy-four articles met the inclusion criteria for the review; 25 
articles, reporting findings from 21 studies, were included in the synthesis. 
Seven studies focused on co-morbid LTC self-management for people with SMI, with 
the remaining articles exploring self-management in general. Six analytic themes 
and 28 sub-themes were identified from the synthesis. The themes included: the 
burden of SMI; living with co-morbidities; beliefs and attitudes about 
self-management; support from others for self-management; social and 
environmental factors; and routine, structure and planning.
CONCLUSIONS: The synthesis identified a range of barriers and facilitators to 
self-management, including the burden of living with SMI, social support, 
attitudes towards self-management and access to resources. To adequately support 
people with SMI with co-morbid LTCs, healthcare professionals need to account 
for how barriers and facilitators to self-management are influenced by SMI, and 
meet the unique needs of this population.

BACKGROUND: Understanding global trends in the point prevalence, deaths, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for asthma will facilitate evidence-based 
decision-making.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the global, regional, and national burdens of asthma 
in 204 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019 by age, sex, and 
sociodemographic index (SDI)?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Publicly available data from the Global Burden of 
Disease study from 1990 through 2019 were used. All estimates were presented as 
counts and age-standardized rates per 100,000, along with their associated 
uncertainty intervals.
RESULTS: In 2019, the global age-standardized point prevalence and death rates 
for asthma were 3,415.5 and 5.8 per 100,000, which represent a 24% and 
51.3% decrease since 1990, respectively. Moreover, in 2019, the global 
age-standardized DALY rate was 273.6 and the global point prevalence of asthma 
was highest in the group 5 to 9 years of age. Also in 2019, the United States 
(10,399.3) showed the highest age-standardized point prevalence rate of asthma. 
Generally, the burden of asthma decreased with increasing SDI. Globally, high 
BMI (16.9%), smoking (9.9%), and occupational asthmagens (8.8%) contributed to 
the 2019 asthma DALYs.
INTERPRETATION: Asthma remains an important public health issue, particularly in 
regions with low socioeconomic development. Future research is needed to examine 
thoroughly the associations asthma has with its risk factors and the factors 
impeding optimal self-management. Further research also is needed to understand 
and implement better the interventions that have reduced the burden of asthma.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to design, develop, and test geographic 
information systems (GIS) analytic methods for quantifying and characterizing 
catchment populations across all sites served by a radiology global health 
organization.
METHODS: The analysis included populations served by 78 low-resource medical 
facilities in 32 countries partnered with radiology nonprofit organization, 
RAD-AID International. Three constraints were used to approximate patient 
catchment areas: (1) 1-hour driving time, (2) 1-hour walking time, and (3) 
10-mile circular radius. GIS calculated populations within each constraint using 
publicly available geospatial input databases, including a global digital 
elevation model, population and land cover data, and road locations from 
OpenStreetMap. Demographic and health data from the World Health Organization 
were incorporated to provide further characteristics of covered populations.
RESULTS: The total populations served by all RAD-AID sites as measured by 
driving time, walking time, and 10-mile radius were 189,241,193 (47.8% female), 
26,190,117 (48.7% female), and 110,884,095 (48.1% female), respectively. For 
individual locations, median population within 1-hour driving time was 1,795,977 
(range: 8,742-30,630,800), with an average life expectancy of 68.4 ± 5.8 years. 
Median child mortality before age 5 was 3.8% (range: 0.9%-8.3%), and median 
prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection was 3.1% (range: 
0.7%-10.9%).
CONCLUSION: In this study, GIS provided a robust multisite analysis for 
estimating the potential global population reached by an international radiology 
outreach organization with targeted individual site measurements. Given 
heightened needs to accurately characterize global outreach populations, this 
GIS-based approach may be useful for analysis, outreach planning, and resource 
allocation among global health organizations.

While a substantial literature has examined the effects of individual and 
family-level factors on outcomes following traumatic brain injury (TBI), minimal 
attention has been directed to the potential influence of the larger 
environmental context on outcomes. The purpose of the current study was to 
investigate the effects of state-level resources and supports as an 
environmental factor influencing long-term outcomes from TBI using data from the 
TBI Model Systems. We examined the effects of U.S. state supports that 
specifically target people with TBI (federal funding for state brain injury 
programs, per capita revenue generated by brain injury trust funds, and 
expenditures for brain injury specific Medicaid waivers) and one measure of the 
relative quality of a state's Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS) for all 
people with disabilities. The primary hypothesis was that community 
participation, global functioning, and life satisfaction will be higher on 
average among people with TBI living in states with more brain injury specific 
programs and resources and better LTSS. The results of multilevel and 
fixed-effects modeling indicated that state supports have a small but 
significant impact on participation and life satisfaction. The most consistent 
finding indicated that states with better LTSS had higher levels of community 
participation and life satisfaction on average for people with TBI over and 
above individual-level differences and fluctuations in these outcomes over time. 
There was some indication that more brain injury specific supports also result 
in better participation in the community. These findings deserve replication and 
extension to include other environmental factors, particularly community level 
characteristics, that might affect outcomes from TBI.

Pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease. It 
is a growing clinical problem which can result in breathlessness or respiratory 
failure and has an average life expectancy of 3 years from diagnosis. 
Predominantly accumulation of M2 macrophages accelerates fibrosis progression by 
secreting multiple cytokines that promote fibroblast to myofibroblast transition 
and aberrant wound healing of epithelial cells. Targeting activated macrophages 
to inhibit the pro-fibrotic phenotype is considered as an approach for the 
potential treatment of PF. Clevudine is s a purine nucleoside analogue which in 
an oral formulation is approved for treatment of patients with hepatitis B virus 
(HBV). Here, we found that clevudine is capable of suppressing pro-fibrotic 
phenotype (i.e., CD206, Arg1 and YM1) of M2 macrophages while enhancing 
anti-fibrotic phenotype (i.e., CD86, IL-6 and IL-10) by inhibiting PI3K/Akt 
signaling pathway. This effect further alleviates M2-induced myofibroblast 
activation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thus resulting in a 
decline of collagen deposition, pro-fibrotic cytokines secretion, with a 
concomitant recover ofpulmonary functions in vivo. Less infiltration of M2 
macrophages between α-SMA + cells was also found in clevudine treated mice. Our 
findings indicate a potential anti-fibrotic effect of clevudine by regulating 
macrophage polarization and might be meaningful in clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: Bouldering-Psychotherapy (BPT) has proven to effectively reduce 
depressive symptoms, but evidence on its cost-effectiveness is lacking. 
Corresponding information is paramount to support health policy decision making 
on a potential implementation of BPT in routine care.
METHODS: Using data from the German KuS trial BPT was compared with group 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Severity of depression symptoms at end of 
the intervention was operationalized via Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating 
Scale (MADRS) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Adopting a societal 
perspective, direct medical costs and productivity loss were calculated based on 
standardized unit costs. To determine incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICER) and cost-effectiveness-acceptance curves (CEAC), adjusted mean 
differences (AMD) in costs (gamma-distributed model) and both effect parameters 
(Gaussian-distributed model) were obtained from 1000 simultaneous bootstrap 
replications.
RESULTS: BPT was related to improved effects (AMDs: MADRS -2.58; PHQ-9: - 1.35) 
at higher costs (AMD: +€ 754). No AMD was significant. ICERs amounted to €288 
per MADRS-point and €550 per PHQ-9-point. For both effect parameters about 20% 
of bootstrap replications indicated dominance of BPT, and about 75% larger 
effects at higher costs. At hypothetical willingness to pay (WTP) thresholds of 
€241 (MADRS) and €615 (PHQ-9) per unit of change BPT had a 50% probability of 
being cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: BPT is a promising alternate treatment strategy which - in absence 
of established WTP thresholds for improving symptoms of depression - cannot 
unambiguously be claimed cost-effective. Further studies defining subgroups that 
particularly benefit from BPT appear paramount to delineate recommendations for 
an efficient prospective roll-out to routine care.

INTRODUCTION: Unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are the major 
problems in street women because of the non-utilization of modern 
contraceptives. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have assessed the 
utilization of modern contraceptives and associated factors among street women 
in the study area. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the utilization of 
modern contraceptives and its associated factors among street women.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study using mixed methods was 
conducted from February 16th to April 10, 2021, among all censuses and 615 
reproductive-aged street women. Face-to-face and in-depth interviews were 
employed to generate quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. Binary 
logistic regression was used to analyze the association between modern 
contraceptive utilization and independent variables with statistical 
significance set at p < 0.05. Qualitative data were analyzed using a thematic 
approach.
RESULTS: Approximately half 279 (50.3%) (95% CI: 46.3%, 54.4%) street women 
currently used modern contraceptives. Factors significantly associated were 
women aged 25-34 years [AOR = 5.5, 95% CI: 1.2-24], distance from a nearby 
health facility within 30 min [AOR = 9.2, 95% CI: 1.6-51], getting advice from 
health professionals [AOR = 14.3; 95% CI = 5.3-38.4], discussed with their 
sexual partners about the utilization of modern contraceptives [AOR = 6.2, 95% 
CI: 2.4-16.5], a history of pregnancy [AOR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2-6], the desire to 
have a child after two years [AOR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1-4.7], and women who faced 
rape in street life [AOR = 5.4; 95% CI = 1.9-15.3]. Fear of side effects, 
misperceptions, and the desire to have a child are the main identified themes 
for the key barriers to using modern contraceptives.
CONCLUSION: The proportion of street women currently using modern contraceptives 
was low. Age, distance from the health facility, discussion with health 
professionals, discussion with sexual partners, history of pregnancy, desire 
time to have a child in the future, and history of rape were factors 
significantly associated with the use of modern contraceptives. Most of the 
participants' reasons for the lack of use of modern contraceptives were fear of 
its side effects.

Plain Language Summary: Street women are a segment of the population in absolute 
poverty, which they suffer from the major problems of unwanted pregnancy and 
sexually transmitted diseases. Besides this issue, its consequences necessitate 
the use of modern contraceptives. This study aimed to determine the utilization 
and associated factors, and explore the key barriers to modern contraceptive 
utilization among street women in Dire Dawa.In this study, a community-based 
cross-sectional study design was conducted among all censuses and 615 
reproductive-aged street women from February 16th to April 10, 2021. 
Face-to-face and in-depth interviews were employed to generate data for both 
methods. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 25 and a thematic 
approach for quantitative and qualitative, respectively.The findings of this 
study showed that the proportion of street women who currently used modern 
contraceptives was 279 (50.3%). Factors significantly associated were age, 
distance from the health facility, discussion with health professionals, 
discussion with sexual partners, history of pregnancy, desire time to have a 
child, and history of rape. The key barriers to using modern contraceptives are 
fear of side effects, misperceptions, and the desire to have a child.In 
conclusion: this study demonstrated that the proportion of street women 
currently using modern contraceptives was low. Health professionals and health 
extension workers should give health education that integrates well-organized 
street women’s groups and community health extension workers that may help 
reduce women's fear of potential side effects. To correct the misperceptions and 
myths about modern contraceptives too.

INTRODUCTION: Neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) are disturbances highly related to 
age. This means that, with the increasing trend in life expectancy, there is 
also an increase in this diagnosis, although NCDs are not exclusively found in 
the population over 65 years old. Likely, they will increase in the coming years 
together with improvements in diagnosis. In addition to the use of medicines and 
rehabilitative techniques, pet therapy is also used. Pet therapy makes use of 
animals with therapeutic, rehabilitative, educational, and recreational purposes 
for people affected by physical, neuromotor, and psychiatric disorders. Pet 
therapy seems to be functional for increasing social and communication 
competencies, facilitating verbal and body language, increasing self-esteem, 
improving quality of life, and reducing anxiety/stress.
METHODS: This study was based on scientific papers and publications obtained 
from the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Moreover, other articles from 
further cross-references were included. Specific database research criteria were 
(a) articles published in 2018 or later, (b) samples containing only adults over 
65 years old, (c) written in English or Italian, and (d) on the topic of 
animal-assisted intervention.
RESULTS: Uncertain results were obtained. Although a positive effect was found, 
the included articles were of insufficient methodological rigor.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Although many studies reported positive results, these 
could not be generalized because of the numerous biases present (e.g., small 
sample size, lack of methodological rigor, lack of protocol, etc.). Future 
studies, therefore, should seek to address the limitations found in the analyzed 
studies.

Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center 
for Cancer, Tianjin 300060, China.

OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study investigated prognostic factors in advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with bone-only metastasis, and developed a 
graded prognostic assessment (GPA) model to estimate patient survival.
METHODS: The primary endpoint was overall survival. We investigated the patients 
with advanced NSCLC with bone-only metastasis at the initial diagnosis and 
diagnosed between 2013 and 2019 in our hospital. A log-rank test and Cox 
proportional hazards model were used to examine factors. A GPA model was 
developed in the training set based on the factors that were determined 
significant according to their hazard ratios and verified by the validation set.
RESULTS: We finally included 220 patients for analysis. These patients were 
divided into two groups, 147 cases for the training cohort and 73 for the 
validation cohort. The following were significant independent prognostic 
factors, and were included in the GPA model: smoking; EGFR (epidermal growth 
factor receptor) sensitive/ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) mutations; loss of 
weight; hypoalbuminemia; and primary site treated by surgery or radiotherapy. 
GPA score of nil was assigned to smoking, without sensitive mutations, loss of 
weight, hypoalbuminemia, and without local treatment of primary site; the 
corresponding superior alternatives were scored 1.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.5, and 1.5, 
respectively. The median survival times of patients with GPA scores of nil to 
3.0, 3.5 to 6.0, and 6.5 to 8.0 were 14.2, 29.5, and 56.6 months in the training 
set (P < 0.001) and 15.2, 31.2, and 54.0 months in the validation set 
(P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The survival time of patients with NSCLC with bone-only metastasis 
was dramatically influenced by the presence of the determined prognostic 
factors. The GPA model developed in this study may be a useful clinical tool to 
estimate the life expectancy of these patients, and guide treatment.

BACKGROUND: Palliative research studies seem to be limited and disperse in Iran. 
The present study was therefore conducted to review and categorize the 
Palliative Care (PC) studies performed in Iran in terms of the research type, 
the type/focus of PC, the measured outcomes in interventional palliative studies 
and their related results, the disease type, and their geographical 
distribution.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This narrative review was conducted in 2021 in which both 
Iranian and international databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, 
CINAHL, ProQuest, Magiran, SID, Noormags, ISC were searched. The inclusion 
criteria were original articles conducted in Iran and results published in 
Persian or English journals ab initio in which PC was assessed as a variable 
(dependent or independent) or the main concept.
RESULTS: A total of 1096 articles were identified from which only 44 articles 
were reviewed. The research studies were mainly focused on cancer and majority 
conducted in Tehran. Majority of studies were quantitative-interventional 
leading to a variety of positive changes in dependent variables, including 
reduce in pain severity, change in life pattern, a good response to therapy, 
increase life expectancy, improve in dysphagia, improve quality of life, reduce 
patients' metastasis, and increase in nurses' self-efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS: The PC studies distributed across different fields and cities in 
Iran resulted to a number of positive outcomes for patients. More focused and 
robust research studies with different patients need to be conducted in this 
emerging field in Iran.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to be a pandemic 
worldwide. Lung transplantation is the last option to increase life expectancy 
of end-stage COVID-19 patients. Branch pulmonary artery stenosis (PAS) is a rare 
complication after lung transplantation with an extremely poor prognosis. The 
current trend in the management of branch PAS is percutaneous balloon 
angioplasty and/or stent implantation, rather than high-risk reoperation with a 
lower success rate.
CASE SUMMARY: The subject was a 54-year-old male with severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who underwent a double-lung transplantation. He 
suffered hypoxaemia and right heart dysfunction following the operation. Right 
cardiac catheterization and pulmonary angiography examination revealed severe 
stenosis of the right branch pulmonary artery. Due to immunosuppression and 
reduced coagulation function, the patient underwent pulmonary artery balloon 
dilatation and stent implantation, and ultimately recovered well.
DISCUSSION: The combination of balloon dilatation and stent implantation is a 
good alternative to reoperation for patients with COVID-19.

Reductions in US life expectancy during the COVID-19 pandemic by race and 
ethnicity: Is 2021 a repetition of 2020?

Andrasfay T, Goldman N.

Update in
    PLoS One. 2022 Aug 31;17(8):e0272973.

COVID-19 had a huge mortality impact in the US in 2020 and accounted for most of 
the overall reduction in 2020 life expectancy at birth. There were also 
extensive racial/ethnic disparities in the mortality impact of COVID-19 in 2020, 
with the Black and Latino populations experiencing reductions in life expectancy 
at birth over twice as large as that of the White population. Despite continued 
vulnerability of these populations, the hope was that widespread distribution of 
effective vaccines would mitigate the overall impact and reduce racial/ethnic 
disparities in 2021. In this study, we quantify the mortality impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on 2021 US period life expectancy by race and ethnicity and 
compare these impacts to those estimated for 2020. Our estimates indicate that 
racial/ethnic disparities have persisted, and that the US population experienced 
a decline in life expectancy at birth in 2021 of 2.2 years from 2019, 0.6 years 
more than estimated for 2020. The corresponding reductions estimated for the 
Black and Latino populations are slightly below twice that for Whites, 
suggesting smaller disparities than those in 2020. However, all groups 
experienced additional reductions in life expectancy relative to 2020, and this 
apparent narrowing of disparities is primarily the result of Whites experiencing 
proportionately greater increases in mortality in 2021 compared with the 
corresponding increases in mortality for the Black and Latino populations in 
2021. Estimated declines in life expectancy at age 65 increased slightly for 
Whites between 2020 and 2021 but decreased for both the Black and Latino 
populations, resulting in the same overall reduction (0.8 years) estimated for 
2020 and 2021.

To investigate the national burden of eye diseases in China from 1990 to 2019. 
The national burden of eye diseases in China, including case numbers, prevalence 
rate, age-standardized prevalence rate (ASR), disability-adjusted life year 
(DALY), DALY rate and age-standardized DALY rate (ASD) were calculated and 
stratified by sex and age. The trends of eye diseases burden from 1990 to 2019 
and the correlation between eye diseases burden and human development index 
(HDI) were analyzed. In 2019, the total case number of eye diseases in China was 
0.21 billion, the ASR was 9511/10, the total number of DALY was 4.72 million, 
and the ASD was 247.4/10. Near vision loss caused the greatest burden, followed 
by refraction disorders and cataract, with ASD being 73.8/10, 70.3/10 and 
59.2/10, respectively. Men had lower risks of eye diseases than women. People 
aged old and old had the greatest burden of eye diseases. Compared with the year 
1990, the total case number increased by 134.6% and DALY by 113.0% in 2019. The 
ASD of all decreased by 7.5%, and was negatively correlated with national HDI. 
Near vision loss, refraction disorders and cataract are of heavy disease burden 
in China. Although the ASD of eye diseases is decreased with the development of 
the national socioeconomic status, the eye diseases burden in China still 
increased with population growth and aging.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the national burden of eye diseases in China from 1990 
to 2019.
METHODS: The national burden of eye diseases in China, including case numbers, 
prevalence rate, age-standardized prevalence rate (ASR), disability-adjusted 
life year (DALY), DALY rate and age-standardized DALY rate (ASD) were calculated 
and stratified by sex and age. The trends of eye diseases burden from 1990 to 
2019 and the correlation between eye diseases burden and human development index 
(HDI) were analyzed.
RESULTS: In 2019, the total case number of eye diseases in China was 0.21 
billion, the ASR was 9511/10 5, the total number of DALY was 4.72 million, and 
the ASD was 247.4/10 5. Near vision loss caused the greatest burden, followed by 
refraction disorders and cataract, with ASD being 73.8/10 5, 70.3/10 5 and 
59.2/10 5, respectively. Men had lower risks of eye diseases than women. People 
aged 50– <70 years old and ≥70 years old had the greatest burden of eye 
diseases. Compared with the year 1990, the total case number increased by 134.6% 
and DALY by 113.0% in 2019. The ASD of all decreased by 7.5%, and was negatively 
correlated with national HDI.
CONCLUSIONS: Near vision loss, refraction disorders and cataract are of heavy 
disease burden in China. Although the ASD of eye diseases is decreased with the 
development of the national socioeconomic status, the eye diseases burden in 
China still increased with population growth and aging.

Inhibition of TGFβ signaling in concert with a checkpoint blockade has been 
shown to provide improved and durable antitumor immune response in mouse models. 
However, on-target adverse cardiovascular effects have limited the clinical use 
of TGFβ receptor (TGFβR) inhibitors in cancer therapy. To restrict the activity 
of TGFβR inhibitors to tumor tissues and thereby widen the therapeutic index, a 
series of tumor-activated prodrugs of a selective small molecule TGFβR1 
inhibitor 1 were prepared by appending 1 to a serine protease substrate and a 
half-life extension fatty acid carbon chain. The prodrugs were shown to be 
selectively metabolized in tumor tissues relative to the heart and blood and 
demonstrated a prolonged favorable increase in the tumor-to-heart ratio of the 
active drug in tissue distribution studies. Once-weekly administration of the 
most tissue-selective compound 10 provided anti-tumor efficacy comparable to the 
parent compound and reduced systemic exposure of the active drug.

Objective: Several immunotherapies have shown efficacy in slowing C-peptide 
decline in new-onset type 1 diabetes. Although most of these biologic drugs are 
expensive, they offer the opportunity to reduce downstream disease management 
costs and risk of complications. The objective of this study is to examine the 
cost-effectiveness of immunotherapies versus no treatment for patients with 
new-onset type 1 diabetes. Methods: Using Markov microsimulation modeling and 
efficacy data from immunotherapy trials, we examined the cost-effectiveness of 
six immunotherapies for new-onset type 1 diabetes, namely, low-dose (2.5 mg/kg) 
antithymocyte globulin (ATG), high-dose (6.5 mg/kg) ATG, abatacept, alefacept, 
rituximab, and teplizumab, versus no treatment. Effectiveness was measured by 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were estimated from a health system 
perspective. Results: Low-dose ATG treatment saves US$10,270, on average, over a 
patient's lifetime and generates 0.09 additional QALYs compared with no 
treatment. These cost savings arise as low-dose ATG generates downstream savings 
in disease management costs that more than offset its cost. In contrast, 
treatment with other immunotherapies yields smaller QALY gains (0.02-0.05 
additional QALYs) and increases lifetime costs by US$9500-US$168,380 relative to 
no treatment, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios that exceed the 
willingness-to-pay threshold of US$100,000 per QALY. Conclusions: Low-dose ATG 
treatment is both less costly and more effective relative to other 
immunotherapies and no treatment for new-onset type 1 diabetes.

BACKGROUND: The frequency of heart failure (HF) in Tunisia is on the rise and 
has now become a public health concern. This is mainly due to an aging Tunisian 
population (Tunisia has one of the oldest populations in Africa as well as the 
highest life expectancy in the continent) and an increase in coronary artery 
disease and hypertension. However, no extensive data are available on 
demographic characteristics, prognosis, and quality of care of patients with HF 
in Tunisia (nor in North Africa).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze, follow, and evaluate patients 
with HF in a large nation-wide multicenter trial.
METHODS: A total of 1700 patients with HF diagnosed by the investigator will be
