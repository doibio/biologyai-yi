cost-utility models can provide a useful perspective for both individual 
practice and public health.

BACKGROUND: Dengue has become a major public health problem in Sri Lanka with a 
considerable economic burden. As a response, in June, 2014, the Ministry of 
Health initiated a proactive vector control programme in partnership with 
military and police forces, known as the Civil-Military Cooperation (CIMIC) 
programme, that was targeted at high-risk Medical Officer of Health (MOH) 
divisions in the country. Evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
population-level interventions is essential to guide public health planning and 
resource allocation decisions, particularly in resource-limited health-care 
settings.
METHODS: Using an interrupted time series design with a non-linear extension, we 
evaluated the impact of vector control interventions from June 22, 2014, to Dec 
29, 2016, in Panadura, a high-risk MOH division in Western Province, Sri Lanka. 
We used dengue notification and larval survey data to estimate the reduction in 
Breteau index and dengue incidence before and after the intervention using two 
separate models, adjusting for time-varying confounding variables (ie, rainfall, 
temperature, and the Oceanic Niño Index). We also assessed the cost and 
cost-effectiveness of the CIMIC programme from the perspective of the National 
Dengue Control Unit under the scenarios of different levels of hospitalisation 
of dengue cases (low [25%], medium [50%], and high [75%]) in terms of cost per 
disability-adjusted life-year averted (DALY).
FINDINGS: Vector control interventions had a significant impact on combined 
Breteau index (relative risk reduction 0·43, 95% CI 0·26 to 0·70) and on dengue 
incidence (0·43, 0·28 to 0·67), the latter becoming prominent 2 months after the 
intervention onset. The mean number of averted dengue cases was estimated at 
2192 (95% CI 1741 to 2643), and the total cost of the CIMIC programme at 2016 
US$271 615. Personnel costs accounted for about 89% of the total cost. In the 
base-case scenario of moderate level of hospitalisation, the CIMIC programme was 
cost-saving with a probability of 70% under both the lowest ($453) and highest 
($1686) cost-effectiveness thresholds, resulting in a net saving of $20 247 (95% 
CI -57 266 to 97 790) and averting 176 DALYs (133 to 226), leading to a cost of 
-$98 (-497 to 395) per DALY averted. This was also the case for the scenario 
with high hospitalisation levels (cost per DALY averted -$512, 95% CI -872 to 
-115) but with a higher probability of 99%. In the scenario with low 
hospitalisation levels (cost per DALY averted $690, 143 to 1379), although the 
CIMIC programme was cost-ineffective at the lowest threshold with a probability 
of 77%, it was cost-effective at the highest threshold with a probability of 
99%.
INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that communities affected by dengue can 
benefit from investments in vector control if interventions are implemented 
rigorously and coordinated well across sectors. By doing so, it is possible to 
reduce the disease and economic burden of dengue in endemic settings.

Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive, multisystem disorder, 
characterised by chronic haemolytic anaemia, painful episodes of vaso-occlusion, 
progressive organ failure and a reduced life expectancy. Sickle cell disease is 
the most common monogenetic disease, with millions affected worldwide. In 
well-resourced countries, comprehensive care programs have increased life 
expectancy of sickle cell disease patients, with almost all infants surviving 
into adulthood. Therapeutic options for sickle cell disease patients are 
however, still scarce. Predictors of sickle cell disease severity and a better 
understanding of pathophysiology and (epi)genetic modifiers are warranted and 
could lead to more precise management and treatment. This review provides an 
extensive summary of the pathophysiology and management of sickle cell disease 
and encompasses the characteristics, complications and current and future 
treatment options of the disease.

Introduction: Hemophilia A (HA) is an inherited bleeding disorder that, if not 
properly treated, is associated with debilitating joint damage due to recurrent 
hemarthroses as well as life-threatening bleeds including intracranial 
hemorrhage. For decades, the only method to prevent bleeding events was to 
infuse factor (F) VIII concentrates intravenously two to three times weekly. 
Although successful in reducing bleeding frequency, preventing a high proportion 
of joint disease, and extending life expectancy, standard continuous prophylaxis 
with FVIII is burdensome and insufficiently effective at preventing long-term 
joint dysfunction in some patients. In October 2018, the Federal Drug 
Administration approved a novel agent, emicizumab-kxwh, for the treatment of 
patients with HA without inhibitors. Areas covered: In this article, the 
preclinical and clinical development of emicizumab-kxwh will be reviewed. Data 
from licensure phase 3 clinical trials will be reviewed in detail discussing 
issues of both safety and efficacy. Expert opinion: As emicizumab-kxwh leads the 
way of a shift in treatment paradigm for patients with HA without inhibitors, a 
number of questions remain, including the impact of emicizumab-kxwh on joint and 
bone health, inhibitor development, and thrombotic risk. Ultimately, time and 
clinical investigation will be able to elucidate the influence of 
emicizumab-kxwh in these areas.

BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in 
low-income and middle-income countries. In 2017, WHO recommended the 
programmatic use of typhoid Vi-conjugate vaccine (TCV) in endemic settings, and 
Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, has pledged support for vaccine introduction in 
these countries. Country-level health economic evaluations are now needed to 
inform decision-making.
METHODS: In this modelling study, we compared four strategies: no vaccination, 
routine immunisation at 9 months, and routine immunisation at 9 months with 
catch-up campaigns to either age 5 years or 15 years. For each of the 54 
countries eligible for Gavi support, output from an age-structured 
transmission-dynamic model was combined with country-specific treatment and 
vaccine-related costs, treatment outcomes, and disability weights to estimate 
the reduction in typhoid burden, identify the strategy that maximised average 
net benefit (ie, the optimal strategy) across a range of country-specific 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) values, estimate and investigate the uncertainties 
surrounding our findings, and identify the epidemiological conditions under 
which vaccination is optimal.
FINDINGS: The optimal strategy was either no vaccination or TCV immunisation 
including a catch-up campaign. Routine vaccination with a catch-up campaign to 
15 years of age was optimal in 38 countries, assuming a WTP value of at least 
US$200 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, or assuming a WTP value 
of at least 25% of each country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita per 
DALY averted, at a vaccine price of $1·50 per dose (but excluding Gavi's 
contribution according to each country's transition phase). This vaccination 
strategy was also optimal in 48 countries assuming a WTP of at least $500 per 
DALY averted, in 51 with assumed WTP values of at least $1000, in 47 countries 
assuming a WTP value of at least 50% of GDP per capita per DALY averted, and in 
49 assuming a minimum of 100%. Vaccination was likely to be cost-effective in 
countries with 300 or more typhoid cases per 100 000 person-years. Uncertainty 
about the probability of hospital admission (and typhoid incidence and 
mortality) had the greatest influence on the optimal strategy.
INTERPRETATION: Countries should establish their own WTP threshold and consider 
routine TCV introduction, including a catch-up campaign when vaccination is 
optimal on the basis of this threshold. Obtaining improved estimates of the 
probability of hospital admission would be valuable whenever the optimal 
strategy is uncertain.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by snoring, recurrent obstruction 
(apneas) of the upper airway which disrupts normal ventilation during sleep. In 
the last decade, there has been a increase in children diagnosed with 
persistent, severe OSA attributed to (1) the obesity epidemic as 25-60% of obese 
children will have obesity related OSA (2) advances in medical technology that 
have increased life expectancy of medically complex children (3) improved 
diagnostics and (4) increased awareness. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is 
commonly used to treat persistent, severe OSA. PAP devices deliver pressurized 
air via nasal or oronasal interfaces to distend the upper airway and ameliorate 
OSA. Although effective in treating OSA, PAP adherence is suboptimal. This 
review article provides an overview of (1) PAP use in pediatric OSA (2) PAP 
devices (3) PAP adherence, (4) strategies and interventions to improve adherence 
and (5) Optimizing PAP delivery during pediatric to adult transition.

Four Years of CHEER: Cost and QALY Savings of a Free Nurse-run Walk-in Clinic 
Serving an Uninsured, Predominantly Spanish-speaking Immigrant Population in 
Providence.

Barry K, McCarthy M, Buckley J, Jacques S, Johnson H, Almeida-Monroe V, De Groot 
AS.

Non-emergent visits to emergency departments by uninsured patients impose 
unnecessary costs on both patients and safety-net institutions. We evaluated the 
health and economic impacts of providing free, walk-in care to low-income, 
uninsured adults-most of them Hispanic-at a free clinic between January 2013 and 
December 2016. Providing access to health care services for uninsured patients 
at Clínica Esperanza/Hope Clinic reduced emergency department expenditures in 
Rhode Island by approximately $448,876 (range: $410,377-$487,375) annually and 
may have also reduced future healthcare costs for this population by more than 
$48 million ($12,034,469 annually) over the four-year evaluation period. For 
every $1 in funding for walk-in clinic operation, delivering free care provided 
a return on investment of $71.18 (range: $70.95-71.40) in healthcare value. 
Providing access to non-emergent walk-in care at the more than 12,000 free 
healthcare clinics nationwide may save billions in ED costs while improving the 
health of uninsured individuals.

Lines of evidence from several studies have shown that increases in life 
expectancy are now accompanied by increased disability rate. The expanded 
lifespan of the aging population imposes a challenge on the continuous increase 
of chronic disease. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing at an 
alarming rate in many parts of the world. Further to increasing the onset of 
metabolic imbalances, obesity leads to reduced life span and affects cellular 
and molecular processes in a fashion resembling aging. Nine key hallmarks of the 
aging process have been proposed. In this review, we will review these hallmarks 
and discuss pathophysiological changes that occur with obesity, that are similar 
to or contribute to those that occur during aging. We present and discuss the 
idea that obesity, in addition to having disease-specific effects, may 
accelerate the rate of aging affecting all aspects of physiology and thus 
shortening life span and health span.

Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic, progressive metabolic illness 
which is commonly complicated by coexistence of depression and anxiety. This 
study aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression among diabetic 
patients and the factors predicting this coexistence. Methods It was a 
cross-sectional, observational study which included patients of type 2 DM 
admitted in the hospital due to diabetes-related condition - diabetic foot 
infections/ulcers, hyperosmotic hyperglycaemic state (HHS), and hypoglycaemic 
coma/seizure. Anxiety and depression were measured by using the Hospital Anxiety 
and Depression Scale (HADS). Data was entered and analysed using SPSS version 
22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results Mean anxiety score of the 
participants was 10.88 ± 4.075 and mean depression score was 11.82 ± 4.049. 
There were 72 (50.7%) patients who had anxiety and 70 (49.2%) patients who had 
depression. Higher scores of anxiety and depression were statistically 
significant in female gender, older participants, individuals with longer 
duration of diabetes, those taking non-insulin treatment, and individuals with 
painful neuropathy, nephropathy, and foot ulcers. Conclusion The incidence of 
depression and anxiety among hospitalized patients of diabetes mellitus is high. 
The coexistence of these two chronic debilitating illnesses is worsening the 
overall quality of life. It is very important to diagnose and manage anxiety and 
depression in patients with type 2 DM to ensure higher quality of life and life 
expectancy.

PURPOSE: People living with psychotic illness disproportionately experience more 
comorbidities and have a markedly shorter life expectancy compared to the 
general population. This review evaluates the effectiveness of health behavior 
change interventions in improving health outcomes in this group.
DESIGN AND METHODS: All studies included objective physical health measures or 
health behaviors as the main outcome measures and experimental design with 
baseline and follow-up quantitative data. Only studies of moderate and strong 
quality were included. Narrative synthesis was undertaken.
FINDINGS: Included studies utilized a range of methodological designs and 
outcome measures. The majority reported significant intervention effect on most 
outcome measures.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health behavior change interventions can be effective in 
improving health outcomes in people with psychotic illness, with the potential 
benefit of improved psychiatric outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer, one of the most common endocrine malignancies in 
developed areas and China, is associated with favorable prognosis. However, the 
presence of spinal metastases will remarkably reduce the life expectancy for 
patients with thyroid cancer. In addition, limited information is available 
about such disease.
METHODS: Various potential clinical factors were submitted to univariate and 
multivariate analyses to identify the independent variables that predicted the 
prognosis for patients. In addition, the survival rate was estimated according 
to the Kaplan-Meier method, and statistic differences were calculated by the 
log-rank test. Moreover, factors with a P value of ≤0.1 were performed 
multivariate analysis using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, and 
factors with a P value of <0.05 were considered as statistically significant.
RESULTS: Seven potential independent prognostic factors had been identified 
through univariate analysis, which were then subjected to multivariate analysis. 
Our results suggested that age of ≤50 years, single segment involved, and 
follicular thyroid cancer were the independent favorable prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings in this study indicate that age of ≤50 years, single 
segment involved, and follicular thyroid cancer are favorable prognostic factors 
for patients with thyroid cancer spinal metastases.

Life expectancy and parental education.

Electronic address: mhuebener@diw.de.

This study analyses the relationship between life expectancy and parental 
education. Based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study and survival 
analysis models, we show that maternal education is related to children's life 
expectancy - even after controlling for children's own level of education. This 
applies equally to daughters and sons as well as to children's further life 
expectancies examined at age 35 to age 65. This pattern is more pronounced for 
younger cohorts. In most cases, the education of the father is not significantly 
related to children's life expectancy. Neither the vocational training nor the 
occupational position of the parents in childhood, which both correlate with 
household income, can explain the connection. The health behaviour of the 
children and the health accumulated over the life course appear as important 
channels. This study extends the previous literature that focused mostly on the 
relationship between individuals' own education and their life expectancy. It 
implies that the link between education and life expectancy is substantially 
stronger and that returns to education are higher if the intergenerational 
component is considered.

AIMS: To quantify the relation between smoking cessation after a first 
cardiovascular (CV) event and risk of recurrent CV events and mortality.
METHODS: Data were available from 4,673 patients aged 61 ± 8.7 years, with a 
recent (≤1 year) first manifestation of arterial disease participating in the 
SMART-cohort. Cox models were used to quantify the relation between smoking 
status and risk of recurrent major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events (MACE 
including stroke, MI and vascular mortality) and mortality. In addition, 
survival according to smoking status was plotted, taking competing risk of 
non-vascular mortality into account.
RESULTS: A third of the smokers stopped after their first CV event. During a 
median of 7.4 (3.7-10.8) years of follow-up, 794 patients died and 692 MACE 
occurred. Compared to patients who continued to smoke, patients who quit had a 
lower risk of recurrent MACE (adjusted HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49-0.88) and all-cause 
mortality (adjusted HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48-0.82). Patients who reported smoking 
cessation on average lived 5 life years longer and recurrent MACE occurred 10 
years later. In patients with a first CV event >70 years, cessation of smoking 
had improved survival which on average was comparable to former or never 
smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of age at first CV event, cessation of smoking after a 
first CV event is related to a substantial lower risk of recurrent vascular 
events and all-cause mortality. Since smoking cessation is more effective in 
reducing CV risk than any pharmaceutical treatment of major risk factors, it 
should be a key objective for patients with vascular disease.

Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, which significantly reduces 
the life expectancy. Early detection of melanoma can reduce the morbidity and 
mortality associated with skin cancer. Dermoscopic images acquired by 
dermoscopic instruments are used in computational analysis for skin cancer 
detection. However, some image quality limitations such as noises, shadows, 
artefacts exist that could compromise the robustness of the skin image analysis. 
Hence, developing an automatic intelligent system for skin cancer diagnosis with 
accurate detection rate is crucial. In this paper, we evaluate the performance 
of several state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks in dermoscopic images 
of skin lesions. Our experiment is conducted on a graphics processing unit (GPU) 
to speed up the training and deployment process. To enhance the quality of 
images, we employ different pre-processing steps. We also apply data 
augmentation methodology such as horizontal and vertical flipping techniques to 
address the class skewness problem. Both pre-processing and data augmentation 
could help to improve the final accuracy.

Recurrence of prostate cancer after initial treatment with radiation therapy 
(RT) is highly dependent on pretreatment risk group and unfortunately, a 
proportion of patients fail primary treatment. The treatment of recurrence after 
primary radiation is rapidly changing with advances in imaging and it is 
important to distinguish those with a local failure from those with distant 
failure. If disease remains locally confined, salvage treatment with a variety 
of techniques can still provide a potential cure. Patients with distant failure 
are often treated with androgen deprivation, or in those with a shorter life 
expectancy, conservative management. In patients with a higher burden of 
metastatic disease, there is emerging evidence that chemotherapy and advanced 
androgen therapy can improve survival. We review the relevant literature on 
available salvage treatment options and appropriate patient selection for 
patients with recurrent prostate cancer after RT. We report on the efficacy and 
adverse effects of the currently available local salvage modalities including 
salvage radical prostatectomy, high dose rate and low dose rate brachytherapy, 
cryotherapy, high intensity focused ultrasound, and stereotactic body RT. We 
additionally discuss diagnosis of oligometastatic disease on imaging and current 
approaches to treatment with either radiation or surgery. While a full review of 
chemotherapy and advanced androgen therapies is beyond the scope of this article 
we briefly discuss their use in the treatment of newly diagnosed recurrence 
after radiation.

care patients.

Prolonged seizures and status epilepticus (SE) are relevant problems in 
palliative care. Timely recognition and effective early treatment with first- 
and second-line antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may prevent unnecessary 
hospitalizations. Seizures should be recognized and addressed like any other 
symptom that causes discomfort or reduces quality of life. Use of alternative 
AED administration routes (buccal, intranasal, or subcutaneous) may offer 
possibilities for effective and individualized AED therapy, even during the last 
days of life. In hospice or home care, however, also intravenous treatment is 
possible via vascular access devices for long-term use. Aggressive unlimited 
intensive care unit (ICU) treatment of refractory SE in palliative patients is 
mostly not indicated. At worst, intensive care can be futile and possibly 
harmful: death in the ICU is often preceded by long and aggressive treatments. 
Metastatic cancer, old age, high severity of acute illness, overall frailty, 
poor functional status before hospital admission, and the presence of severe 
comorbidities all increase the probability of poor outcome of intensive care. 
When several of these factors are present, consideration of withholding 
intensive care may be in the patient's best interests. Anticipated outcomes 
influence patients' preferences. A majority of patients with a limited life 
expectancy because of an incurable disease would not want aggressive treatment, 
if the anticipated outcome was survival but with severe functional impairment. 
Doctors' perceptions about their patients' wishes are often incorrect, and 
therefore, advance care planning including seizure management should be done 
early in the course of the disease. This article is part of the Special Issue 
"Proceedings of the 7th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus and 
Acute Seizures".

Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide, yet there are 
currently no effective treatments. Because risk of neurodegenerative disease 
substantially increases with age, greater life expectancy with a concomitant 
aging population means more individuals will be affected in the coming decades. 
Thus, there is an urgent need for understanding the mechanisms driving 
neurodegenerative diseases in order to develop improved treatment strategies. 
Inflammation in the nervous system, termed "neuroinflammation," has become 
increasingly recognized as being associated with neurodegenerative diseases. 
Early attention focused primarily on morphological changes in astrocytes and 
microglia; however, brain and CNS resident mast cells are now receiving 
attention as a result of being "first responders" to injury. Mast cells also 
exert profound effects on their microenvironment and neighboring cells including 
behavior and/or activation of astrocytes, microglia, and neurons, which, in 
turn, are implicated in neuroinflammation, neurogenesis and neurodegeneration. 
Mast cells also affect disruption/permeability of the blood brain barrier 
enabling toxin and immune cell entry exacerbating an inflammatory 
microenvironment. Here, we discuss the roles of mast cells in neuroinflammation 
and neurodegeneration with a focus on development and progression of four 
prominent neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington's Disease.

OBJECTIVE: The expectation of developing side effects can enhance the likelihood 
to develop them - a phenomenon referred to as nocebo effect. Whether nocebo 
effects can be reduced by lowering negative expectancies, is not clear. The aim 
of this prospective study was to learn more about the factors contributing to 
nausea expectancy and their potential role in actual occurrence of nausea in 
patients undergoing chemotherapy for the first time in their life.
METHODS: Patients scheduled for moderately emetogenic chemotherapeutic regimens 
filled in questionnaires to assess state anxiety and quality of life and to rate 
the expectancy of nausea as a side effect of chemotherapy. Patient diaries were 
used to monitor the severity of post-chemotherapy nausea in the 4 days following 
chemotherapy administration. Bivariate analyses complemented by multiple 
regression analyses were performed to identify the relationship between nausea 
expectation and nausea occurrence.
RESULTS: 121 female patients (mean age 53 years) with completed questionnaires 
were included in the analyses. The majority of the patients had a diagnosis of 
breast cancer (86%). The two main sources for nausea expectancy were positive 
history of nausea in other situations and state anxiety. Patients with high 
expectancy levels (first quartile) experienced greater nausea than those with 
lower expectancy levels. Bivariate analyses revealed a weak but non-significant 
association between nausea expectation and post-chemotherapy nausea. When 
controlling for age, type of cancer, history of nausea, state and trait anxiety, 
and global quality of life, positive history of nausea (OR = 2.592; 95% CI, 1.0 
to 6.67; p < 0.05), younger age (OR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.99; p < 0.05), and 
a lower quality of life (OR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.0; p < 0.05), but not 
nausea expectancy (OR = 1.014; 95% CI, 0.51 to 2.02; p = 0.969), predicted the 
occurrence of post-chemotherapy nausea.
CONCLUSION: In this female cohort, younger patients with lower initial quality 
of life and a positive history of nausea were at higher risk to develop nausea 
after first time chemotherapy. These patients may benefit from psychological 
co-interventions that aim to enhance quality of life.

BACKGROUND: In the context of priority setting, a differential 
cost-effectiveness threshold can be used to reflect a higher societal 
willingness to pay for quality-adjusted life-year gains in the worse off. 
However, uncertainty in the estimate of severity can lead to problems when 
evaluating the outcomes of cost-effectiveness analyses.
OBJECTIVES: This study standardizes the assessment of severity, integrates its 
uncertainty with the uncertainty in cost-effectiveness results and provides 
decision makers with a new estimate: the severity-adjusted probability of being 
cost effective.
METHODS: Severity is expressed in proportional and absolute shortfall and 
estimated using life tables and country-specific EQ-5D values. We use the three 
severity-based cost-effectiveness thresholds (€20.000, €50.000 and €80.000, per 
QALY) adopted in The Netherlands. We exemplify procedures of integrating 
uncertainty with a stylized example of a hypothetical oncology treatment.
RESULTS: Applying our methods, taking into account the uncertainty in the 
cost-effectiveness results and in the estimation of severity identifies the 
likelihood of an intervention being cost effective when there is uncertainty 
about the appropriate severity-based cost-effectiveness threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher willingness-to-pay thresholds for severe diseases are 
implemented in countries to reflect societal concerns for an equitable 
distribution of resources. However, the estimates of severity are uncertain, 
patient populations are heterogeneous, and this can be accounted for with the 
severity-adjusted probability of being cost effective proposed in this study. 
The application to the Netherlands suggests that not adopting the new method 
could result in incorrect decisions in the reimbursement of new health 
technologies.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to identify the problems and resources of women 
with urinary or fecal incontinence based on the International Classification of 
Function and Health (ICF) framework and detecting the impact on the personal 
environment and quality of life. This study forms part of a project with an 
overall goal to enable standardized planning and evaluation of interventions in 
multi-professional settings.
METHODS: To answer the study question a mixed-method sequential design with a 
priority to the quantitative approach was considered appropriate. Regarding 
methods, focus groups were chosen to collect data. Transcripts were analyzed 
with content analysis and identified concepts linked to the corresponding ICF 
categories by two different raters. Cohen's kappa was calculated for interrater 
reliability.
RESULTS: Thirteen women with a mean age of 69.9 years were recruited. Four focus 
groups were conducted, whereas saturation was reached after two focus groups. 
Overall transcripts 99 defined ICF categories at second level could be linked 
(body functions = 31, body structures = 5, activities and participation = 33, 
and environmental factors = 30) whereas 4 categories were not sufficiently 
covered by the ICF (3 = personal factors, 1 = not covered).
CONCLUSIONS: This study has determined 103 resources and problems based on the 
ICF model of women with urinary and/or fecal incontinence. In spite of these 
results, it was shown that four concepts are not fully covered by the ICF 
framework. The current data highlight the importance of an extension of the ICF 
model, especially towards the personal factors of patients.

The academic outcomes of working memory and metacognitive strategy training in 
children: A double-blind randomized controlled trial.

Working memory training has been shown to improve performance on untrained 
working memory tasks in typically developing children, at least when compared to 
non-adaptive training; however, there is little evidence that it improves 
academic outcomes. The lack of transfer to academic outcomes may be because 
children are only learning skills and strategies in a very narrow context, which 
they are unable to apply to other tasks. Metacognitive strategy interventions, 
which promote metacognitive awareness and teach children general strategies that 
can be used on a variety of tasks, may be a crucial missing link in this regard. 
In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, 95 typically developing 
children aged 9-14 years were allocated to three cognitive training programmes 
that were conducted daily after-school. One group received Cogmed working memory 
training, another group received concurrent Cogmed and metacognitive strategy 
training, and the control group received adaptive visual search training, which 
better controls for expectancy and motivation than non-adaptive training. 
Children were assessed on four working memory tasks, reading comprehension, and 
mathematical reasoning before, immediately after, and 3 months after training. 
Working memory training improved working memory and mathematical reasoning 
relative to the control group. The improvements in working memory were 
maintained 3 months later, and these were significantly greater for the group 
that received metacognitive strategy training, compared to working memory 
training alone. Working memory training is a potentially effective educational 
intervention when provided in addition to school; however, future research will 
need to investigate ways to maintain academic improvements long term and to 
optimize metacognitive strategy training to promote far-transfer. A video

2PN cell donation in Germany. Or: How the German Embryo Protection (Act) 
undermines itself.

In contrast to embryo donation, the permissibility of 2PN cell donation is 
highly controversial in Germany. This article is based on there being a legal 
loophole with respect to 2PN cell donation, which results from an inconsistency 
within the Embryo Protection Act on the normative status of 2PN cells. Following 
that thesis, the article argues that, on the basis of the normative criterion 
totipotency (i.e. the capacity to develop into a born human being), 2PN cells 
should also be considered human embryos within the meaning of the Act and 
thereby be protected by that Act in the same way as embryos. However, the 
normative assumption that 2PN cells should already be endowed with human dignity 
and the right to life has absurd consequences. Moreover, the consistent 
continuation of the Embryo Protection Act, as well as of the underlying ethical 
position or argumentation (i.e. the potentiality argument), leads to the even
