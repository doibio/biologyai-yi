Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a world-wide disease prevalently in Western 
nations. It influences about 15% of the western populace, with a negative effect 
on the quality of life and furthermore on medical services costs. 
Anticholinergic antispasmodics are first line of treatment for discomfort or 
abdominal pain, particularly if unrelieved after alleviation of stoppage or 
antidiarrheal treatment. Otilonium bromide (OTB) is quaternary ammonium compound 
with action on distal GI tract as antispasmodic. It is utilized in the treatment 
of patients influenced by Irritable inside disorder (IBS) because of its 
particular pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. OTB is poorly 
absorbed systematically was viable in contrast with different medications used 
for same purpose, for example, pinaverium bromide and mebeverine, with a good 
tolerability profile. The effects are long lasting, even after stopping the 
dosage regime for reduction of abdominal pain. In this review, an overview of 
mechanism of action, pharmacologic action, synthesis and particularly various 
analytical and bioanalytical methods are discussed. The analytical methods 
discussed are spectrophotometry including Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), 
chromatography and capillary electrophoresis methods are described with the 
range, limit of detection and quantification. The paper also provides details of 
scope of further extension of analytical methods. It was found that most of the 
analytical methods involves usage of toxic solvents e.g., methanol, 
acetonitrile, chloroform etc. posing risk to the analyst as well as environment.

Cirrhosis is a burden on the individual and on public health. The World Health 
Organization's metric of public health burden is the disability-adjusted 
life-year (DALY), the sum of years of life lost due to premature death and years 
of life lived with disability. The more DALYs attributable to a disease, the 
greater its burden on public health. Cirrhosis was responsible for 26.8% fewer 
DALYs in 2019 than in 1990, which is positive, but the reduction in DALYs across 
the spectrum of diseases in and outside the liver was 34.4%. Hepatitis C (26% of 
DALYs), alcohol (24%), and hepatitis B (23%) contribute almost equally to the 
global burden of cirrhosis. The contribution from non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease (8%) is small but increasing. There is substantial global variation in 
the burden and causes of cirrhosis. We find that the poorest countries carry the 
greatest burden of cirrhosis, and that this burden is primarily caused by 
cirrhosis from hepatitis B infection. Interventions targeting hepatitis B 
infection are known, but not fully implemented. In more affluent countries, 
alcohol and hepatitis C are the dominant causes of cirrhosis, but non-alcoholic 
fatty liver will likely become a dominant cause of cirrhosis in parallel with 
the increasing prevalence of obesity. We also argue that the World Health 
Organization underestimates the public health burden associated with cirrhosis 
because it assigns zero disability to compensated cirrhosis and considers 
decompensated cirrhosis as only mildly disabling.

BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that produces a virtual 
manifestation of the real world. In recent years, VR has been increasingly used 
as a tool in medical education. The use of VR in medical education has large 
potential, as it allows for distance learning and training which may be 
challenging to deliver in real life. VR encompasses different tools and 
applications. There is a need to explore how VR has been employed in medical 
education to date.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review is to conceptualise the VR tools 
available and the applications of VR in undergraduate medical education as 
reported in the literature. This scoping review will identify any gaps in this 
field and provide suggestions for future research.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The relevant studies will be examined using the Joanna 
Briggs Institute methodological framework for scoping studies. A comprehensive 
search from a total of six electronic databases and grey literature sources will 
be performed. The reference list of included studies will be screened for 
additional studies. The screening and data extraction will be done in parallel 
and independently by two review authors. Any discrepancies will be resolved 
through consensus or discussion with a third review author. A data extraction 
form has been developed using key themes from the research questions. The 
extracted data will be qualitatively analysed and presented in a diagrammatic or 
tabular form, alongside a narrative summary, in line with Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis: extension for Scoping Reviews 
reporting guidelines.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All data will be collected from published and grey 
literature. Ethics approval is therefore not a requirement. We will present our 
findings at relevant conferences and submit them for publications in 
peer-reviewed journals.

PURPOSE: To determine the value of early exome sequencing (eES) relative to the 
current typical care (TC) in the diagnosis of newborns with suspected severe 
mitochondrial disorders (MitD).
METHODS: We used a decision tree-Markov hybrid to model neonatal intensive care 
unit (NICU)-related outcomes and costs, lifetime costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years among patients with MitD. Probabilities, costs, and utilities were 
populated using published literature, expert opinion, and the Pediatric Health 
Information System database. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) and 
net monetary benefits (NMB) were calculated from lifetime costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years for singleton and trio eES, and TC. Robustness was 
assessed using univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). Scenario 
analyses were also conducted.
RESULTS: Findings indicate trio eES is a cost-minimizing and cost-effective 
alternative to current TC. Diagnostic probabilities and NICU length-of-stay were 
the most sensitive model parameters. Base case analysis demonstrates trio eES 
has the highest incremental NMB, and PSA demonstrates trio eES had the highest 
likelihood of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $200,000 
relative to TC, singleton eES, and no ES.
CONCLUSION: Trio and singleton eES are cost-effective and cost-minimizing 
alternatives to current TC in diagnosing newborns suspected of having a severe 
MitD.

Context: As a result of increases in life expectancy and decreases in fertility, 
the proportion of the population entering later life has increased dramatically 
in recent decades. When faced with age-related challenges, some older adults 
respond more positively to adversity than would be expected given the level of 
adversity that they have experienced, demonstrating 'resilience'. Objectives: 
Having a clear conceptual framework for resilience is a prerequisite to 
operationalising resilience in a research context. Methods: Here we compare and 
contrast several approaches to the operationalisation of resilience: 
psychometric-driven and data-driven (variable-centred and individual-centred) 
methods. Results: Psychometric-driven methods involve the administration of 
established questionnaires aimed at quantifying resilience. Data-driven 
techniques use statistical procedures to examine and/or operationalise 
resilience and can be broadly categorised into variable-centred methods, i.e. 
interaction and residuals, and individual-centred methods, i.e. categorical and 
latent class. Conclusions: The specific question(s) driving the research and the 
nature of the variables a researcher intends to use in their adversity-outcome 
dyad will largely dictate which methods are more (or less) appropriate in that 
circumstance. A measured approach to the ways in which resilience is 
investigated is warranted in order to facilitate the most useful application of 
this burgeoning field of research.

BACKGROUND: Individualised behaviour change interventions can result in greater 
effects than one-size-fits-all approaches. Factors linked to success include 
dynamic (vs. static) tailoring, and tailoring on behaviour, multiple theoretical 
variables, and participant characteristics. XP is a very rare (∼100 UK patients) 
genetic disease, involving an inability to repair ultraviolet radiation 
(UVR)-induced damage, resulting in skin cancers and eye damage from an early 
age, and mean life expectancy of 32-years. Management involves rigorous UVR 
photoprotection, which is often inadequate, and no interventions have been 
published. UK-based care is personalised and delivered by a multidisciplinary 
team at the National XP Service in London. Following an intensive, mixed-methods 
formative phase with patients diagnosed with XP (n-of-1, qualitative interviews, 
objective UVR measurement, cross-sectional survey) and relevant stakeholder 
consultation (clinical and patient/public teams), the 'XPAND' intervention was 
developed. This paper describes the comprehensive and novel tailoring and 
personalisation processes used to deliver the intervention.
METHODS: XPAND consists of core and personalised modules targeting cue-based 
(time of day, weather, symptoms), belief-based (motivation, priority), 
self-regulatory (effort, barriers, planning), and emotional (stress, 
self-consciousness, mental exhaustion) factors, social support, disclosure, 
habit, and willingness, using appropriately-matched BCTs. A-priori, phase I data 
and a baseline profiling questionnaire (data sources) were used to allocate 
modules to participants ('personalisation') and to adapt module content 
('tailoring'). Iterative decisions about delivery were based on patient response 
to feedback, identification of additional barriers (e.g. reasons for varying 
protection across contexts), and emergence of new barriers as improvements in 
protection were attempted or achieved (e.g. appearance concerns).
CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic multi-level personalisation and tailoring based on 
mixed-methods in XPAND allowed for insights and decision-making not possible 
with cross-sectional quantitative or qualitative methods alone. Data collection 
and allocation/adaptation methods may be of use in other rare conditions where 
small patient numbers mean that within-participant, individual-level delivery is 
well-suited and feasible.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported an association between natural 
disasters of various kinds and ischemic heart disease (IHD). We investigated the 
association between Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to IHD and 
natural disasters and aimed to assess DALYs as a quantification of the burden of 
IHD related to natural disasters at the global level.
METHODS: Country-specific data of natural disaster impacts DALYs due to IHD and 
socioeconomic variables were obtained from open sources over the period of 
1990-2013 and 2014-2017. A population-based trend ecological design was 
conducted to estimate the association between trends in DALYs and natural 
disasters (occurrence, casualties and total damage), adjusting for socioeconomic 
variables.
RESULTS: Most countries have experienced increases in natural disaster 
occurrences and decreases in DALYs during this study period. The unadjusted 
correlation analysis demonstrated a positive and significant correlation between 
DALYs and natural disasters for females and for both sexes (R = 0.163 and 0.146, 
p = 0.024 and 0.043), and a marginally significant correlation for males (R = 
0.128, p = 0.076). After adjusting for socioeconomic variables, multiple linear 
regression demonstrated independent associations between the occurrence and 
DALYs due to IHD for males, females and both sexes (standardized coefficients = 
0.192, 0.23 and 0.187, p = 0.016, 0.004 and 0.022).
CONCLUSIONS: A weak but significantly positive association between natural 
disaster and IHD was confirmed and quantified at the global level by this DALY 
metric analysis. Adaptation strategies for natural disaster responses and IHD 
disease burden reduction need to be developed.

BACKGROUND: To date, our understanding of the global aortic aneurysm (AA) burden 
distribution is very limited.
OBJECTIVE: To assess a full view of global AA burden distribution and 
attributable risk factors from 1990 to 2017.
METHODS: We extracted data of AA deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 
and their corresponding age-standardized rates (ASRs), in general and by age/sex 
from the 2017 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. The current AA burden 
distribution in 2017 and its changing trend from 1990 to 2017 were separately 
showed. The spatial divergence was discussed from four levels: global, five 
social-demographic index regions, 21 GBD regions, and 195 countries and 
territories. We also estimated the risk factors attributable to AA related 
deaths.
RESULTS: Globally, the AA deaths were 167,249 with an age-standardized death 
rate (ASDR) of 2.19/100,000 persons in 2017, among which the elderly and the 
males accounted for the majority. Although reductions in ASRs were observed in 
developed areas, AA remained an important health issue in those relatively 
underdeveloped areas and might be much more important in the near future. AA may 
increasingly affect the elderly and the female population. Similar patterns of 
AA DALYs burden were noted during the study period. AA burden attributable to 
high blood pressure and smoking decreased globally and there were many 
heterogeneities in their distribution.
DISCUSSION: AA maintained an incremental public health issue worldwide. The 
change pattern of AA burden was heterogeneous across locations, ages, and sexes 
and it is paramount to improve resource allocation for more effective and 
targeted prevention strategies. Also, prevention of tobacco consumption and 
blood pressure control should be emphasized.

BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of effective and affordable treatments, 
only 14% of hypertensive Indians have controlled blood pressure. Increased 
hypertension treatment coverage (the proportion of individuals initiated on 
treatment) and adherence (proportion of patients taking medicines as 
recommended) promise population health gains. However, governments and other 
payers will not invest in a large-scale hypertension control program unless it 
is both affordable and effective.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate if a national hypertension control intervention 
implemented across the private and public sector facilities in India could save 
overall costs of CVD prevention and treatment.
METHODS: We developed a discrete-time microsimulation model to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of population-level hypertension control intervention in 
India for combinations of treatment coverage and adherence targets. Input 
clinical parameters specific to India were obtained from large-scale surveys 
such as the Global Burden of Disease as well as local clinical trials. Input 
hypertensive medication cost parameters were based on government contracts. The 
model projected antihypertensive treatment costs, avoided CVD care costs, 
changes in disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) and incremental cost per DALY 
averted (represented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio or ICER) over 20 
years.
RESULTS: Over 20 years, at 70% coverage and adherence, the hypertension control 
intervention would avert 1.68% DALYs and be cost-saving overall. Increasing 
adherence (while keeping coverage constant) resulted in greater improvement in 
cost savings compared to increasing coverage (while keeping adherence constant). 
Results were most sensitive to the cost of antihypertensive medication, but the 
intervention remained highly cost-effective under all one-way sensitivity 
analyses.
CONCLUSION: A national hypertension control intervention in India would most 
likely be budget neutral or cost-saving if the intervention can achieve and 
maintain high levels of both treatment coverage and adherence.

AIMS: By 2030, we seek to reduce premature deaths from non-communicable 
diseases, including ischaemic heart disease (IHD), by one-third to reach the 
sustainable development goal (SDG) target 3.4. We aimed to investigate the 
quality of care of IHD across countries, genders, age groups, and time using the 
Global Burden of Diseases Study (GBD) 2017 estimates.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We did a principal component analysis on IHD mortality to 
incidence ratio, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) to prevalence ratio, and 
years of life lost to years lived with disability ratio using the results of the 
GBD 2017. The first principal component was scaled from 0 to 100 and designated 
as the quality of care index (QCI). We evaluated gender inequity by the gender 
disparity ratio (GDR), defined as female to male QCI. From 1990 to 2017, the QCI 
and GDR increased from 71.2 to 76.4 and from 1.04 to 1.08, respectively, 
worldwide. In the study period, countries of Western Europe, Scandinavia, and 
Australasia had the highest QCIs and a GDR of 1 to 1.2; however, African and 
South Asian countries had the lowest QCIs and a GDR of 0.8 to 1. Moreover, the 
young population experienced more significant improvements in the QCI compared 
to the elderly in 2017.
CONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2017, the QCI of IHD has improved; nonetheless, there 
are remarkable disparities between countries, genders, and age groups that 
should be addressed. These findings may guide policymakers in monitoring and 
modifying our path to achieve SDGs.

PURPOSE: Volar rim fractures of the distal radius are a spectrum of pathology 
that must be well identified and treated to achieve good outcomes and avoid 
surgical failures. New devices of fragment specific fixation have been developed 
during the last decades to fix this fragment. The purpose of this retrospective 
study was to evaluate the ability of APTUS® wrist distal radius system to 
securely fix different types of volar rim fractures.
METHODS: Patients with at least 1 year of follow-up and a preoperative CT-scan 
evaluation of the fracture pattern were included in the study. Clinical, 
radiological and functional outcomes were assessed.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients with an average follow-up of 34, 1 months (12-61) 
were included in the study. There were no clinical and radiological 
complications, including loss of reduction, device failure and tendon ruptures. 
No patients required hardware removal. Wrist range of motion in 
flexion-extension averaged 96°, while in pronation-supination 144°. At final 
follow-up mean visual analogue scale pain was 1,8. Questionnaires, as 
dissabilities of the arm, shouldder and hand (DASH) score and patient-related 
wrist evolution (PRWE) score were 6,6 and 3 respectively. Grip strenght measured 
86% compared to the normal side.
CONCLUSION: APTUS® wrist presents a versatile set of fragment specific fixation 
plates able to easily and securely fix all types of volar rim fracture. The 
system can be used with other devices without any kind of interference between 
them. When correctly placed and used with the right indications, no late 
complications can be recorded.

OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for the development of postoperative 
diabetes insipidus (DI) in a modern cohort of endoscopic endonasal 
transsphenoidal surgery.
METHODS: Analysis of prospectively collected data of 449 consecutive patients 
operated on for anterior skull base pathology. DI was defined as a polyuria 
(> 250 ml/h for ≥ 2 consecutive hours) polydipsia syndrome associated with 
hypotonic urine with or without hypernatraemia. Multivariate logistic regression 
was used to identify predictors of postoperative DI. A simple scoring system was 
then created.
RESULTS: Postoperative DI occurred in 46 (10.2%) patients. The development of DI 
did not affect quality of life. Predictors of DI on multivariate analysis 
included suprasellar extension (OR 2.2; p = 0.04), age < 50 years (OR 2.8; 
p = 0.003), craniopharyngioma histology (OR 6.7; p = 0.002), and Kelly grade 3 
intraoperative CSF leak (OR 2.1; p = 0.04). The SALT score was created based on 
these characteristics, with one point awarded for each feature present, and 
predicted DI with fair to good predictive value in our cohort (AUROC 0.735 
(95%CI 0.65-0.82)). The rates of postoperative DI were 4.0%, 6.5%, 15.0%. 36.8% 
and 85.7% for SALT scores of zero, one, two, three, and four, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The SALT score predicts postoperative DI with fair to good 
accuracy, and now requires prospective external validation. Improved prediction 
of DI could optimize resource allocation and facilitate individualised 
preoperative patient counselling. We also provide our algorithm for diagnosis 
and treatment of DI.

Medicare's Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program (HVBP) is the first national 
pay-for-performance program to combine measures of quality of care with a 
measure of episode spending. We estimated the implicit tradeoffs between 
mortality reduction and spending reduction. To earn points in HVBP, a hospital 
can either lower mortality or reduce spending, creating a tradeoff between the 2 
measures. We analyzed the quality performance and earned points of 2814 
hospitals using publicly available data. We then quantified the tradeoffs 
between spending and mortality in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). 
If incentives in the program were balanced, then the tradeoff between spending 
and QALYs should be comparable with those of high-value health interventions, 
roughly $50,000 to $200,000 per QALY. Instead, the tradeoff in HVBP was about 
$1.2 million per QALY. HVBP overvalues improvements in quality of care relative 
to spending reductions. We propose 2 possible policy adjustments that could 
improve incentives for hospitals to deliver high-value care.

BACKGROUND: Many studies have reported associations of air pollutants and death, 
but fewer examined multiple pollutants, or used causal methods. We present a 
method for directly estimating changes in the distribution of age at death using 
propensity scores.
METHODS: We included all participants in Medicare from 2000 to 2016 (637,207,589 
person-years of follow-up). We fit separate logistic regressions modeling the 
probability of death at each year of age from 65 to 98 or older as a function of 
exposure to particulate matter less tha 2.5 µM in diameter (PM2.5), NO2, and O3, 
using separate propensity scores for each age. We estimated the propensity score 
using gradient boosting. We estimated the distribution of life expectancy at 
three counterfactual exposures for each pollutant.
RESULTS: The estimated increase in mean life expectancy had the population been 
exposed to 7 versus 12 µg/m3 PM2.5 was 0.29 years (95% CI = 0.28, 0.30). The 
change in life expectancy had the population been exposed to 10 versus 20 ppb of 
NO2 was -0.01 years (95% CI = -0.015, -0.006). The increase in mean life 
expectancy had the population been exposed to 35 versus 45 ppb of O3 was 0.15 
years (95% CI = 0.14, 0.16). Each of these effects was independent and additive.
CONCLUSIONS: We estimated that reducing PM2.5 and O3 concentrations to levels 
below current standards would increase life expectancy by substantial amounts 
compared with the recent increase of life expectancy at age 65 of 0.7 years in a 
decade. Our results are not consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to NO2 
decreases life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: Health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) as a parameter for patient 
well-being is becoming increasingly important.[1] Nevertheless, it is mainly 
used as an endpoint in studies rather than as an indicator for adjustments in 
therapy. In this paper we will present an approach to gradually integrate 
quality of life (QoL) as a control element into the care delivery of oncology.
CONCEPT: Acceptance, usability, interoperability and data protection were 
identified and integrated as key indicators for the development. As an initial 
approach, a questionnaire tool was developed to provide patients a simplified 
answering of questionnaires and physicians a clearer presentation of the 
results.
IMPLEMENTATION: As communication standard HL7 FHIR was used and known security 
concepts like OpenID Concept were integrated. In a usability study, first 
results were achieved by asking patients in the waiting room to answer a 
questionnaire, which will be discussed with the physician in the appointment. 
This study was conducted in 2019 at theSLK Clinics Heilbronn and achieved 86% 
participation of all respondents with an average age of 67 years.
DISCUSSION: Although the evaluation study could prove positive results in 
usability and acceptance, it is necessary to aim for longitudinal surveys in 
order to include QoL as a control element in the therapy. However, a 
longitudinal survey through questionnaires leads to decreasing compliance and 
increasing response bias. [2] For this reason, the concept needs to be expanded. 
With sensors a continuous monitoring can be carried out and the data can be 
mapped to the individual, interpreted by machine learning.
CONCLUSION: Questionnaires are a concept that has been successfully applied in 
studies for years. However, since care delivery poses different challenges, the 
integration of new concepts is inevitable. The authors are currently working on 
an extension of the use of questionnaires with patient generated data through 
sensors.

The question of whether and how changes to population health impact on economic 
growth has been actively studied in the literature, albeit with mixed results. 
We contribute to this debate by reassessing-and extending-[1], one of the most 
influential studies. We include a larger set of countries (135) and cover a more 
recent period (1990-2014). We also account for morbidity in addition to 
mortality and adopt the strategy of providing bounding sets for the effects of 
interest rather than point estimates. We find that reducing mortality and 
disability adjusted life years (DALYs), a measure which combines morbidity and 
mortality, promotes per capita GDP growth. The magnitude of the effect is 
moderate, but non negligible, and it is similar for mortality and DALYs.

Very few studies have analyzed the influence of the environment, rural or urban, 
on the notion of good life and subjective well-being in sub-Saharan Africa and 
none, to our knowledge, has combined qualitative and quantitative methodologies 
for this purpose. The objectives of this interdisciplinary study were: a) to 
understand the emic representations of the good life in rural and urban Senegal 
and; b) to compare the levels and determinants of satisfaction with life between 
these two populations. This study was carried out in Dakar and in a very 
isolated rural area in the North East of Senegal: the sylvo-pastoral zone of 
Ferlo. A total of six focus groups were conducted for the qualitative phase, 
while the quantitative phase was conducted on representative samples of the 
populations living in Dakar (N = 1000) and Téssékéré (N = 500). Our results 
indicate that, against all expectations, life satisfaction is better in the 
Senegalese Ferlo than in the capital, Dakar. This difference may be the joint 
result of less meaningful social comparisons and a relationship with nature as a 
source of stress restoration in rural areas. However, the lifeworld of the rural 
Fulani of the Ferlo is being undermined by global climatic disturbances, which 
imposes rapid adaptations of pastoralism; otherwise this activity, that is not 
only subsistence but also identity-based, may disappear.

Canine chronic enteropathy (CE) is a group of immunogenetic disorders of unclear 
etiology characterized by chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal signs and 
inflammation. Diagnosis of CE subtypes by treatment response is a lengthy and 
challenging process, particularly in refractory cases of the disease. Given 
known association of dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) class II genotype and various 
immunogenetic disorders between and across breeds, this study was designed to 
examine the potential of determining susceptibility to refractory CE through 
identification of risk and protective genotypes in French bulldogs and miniature 
dachshunds-two popular dog breeds in Japan. Sequence-based genotyping of three 
DLA class II genes in 29 French bulldogs and 30 miniature dachshunds with 
refractory CE revealed a protective haplotype 
DLA-DRB1*002:01-DQA1*009:01-DQB1*001:01 against CE in French bulldogs (OR 0.09, 
95 % CI 0.01-0.71, p = 0.0084). No statistical difference was noted between 
miniature dachshund cases and controls. These findings, largely disparate from a 
previous study on German shepherd dogs in the UK, were taken as possible 
indication of etiological differences in the refractory CE noted between and 
within breeds, and by extension, the potential of identifying such disease 
heterogeneity by DLA typing. The DLA-DQA1/DQB1 haplotype, protective against CE 
in our French bulldogs, has been reported as protective in various 
immune-mediated disorders such as Doberman hepatitis (Dyggve et al., 2011). 
Likewise, the DLA-DRB1*006:01 risk allele for Doberman hepatitis was noted in 
more French bulldogs with CE compared to controls, in line with reports on 
genotypes associated with both risk and protection being shared across various 
autoimmune diseases and breeds. These findings support an immunogenetic basis to 
the French bulldog-CE in our analysis, calling for further DLA studies working 
with larger samples and different breeds towards phenotypic clarification that 
may aid in early diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis through epigenetic 
approaches and breeding.

BACKGROUND: Well-timed initiation of HIV therapy enhances life expectancy, 
decreases mortality and morbidity, and inhibits the transmission of HIV and 
complications related to it. The purpose of the present survey is to investigate 
the frequency and reasons for delayed initiation of anti-retroviral therapy 
(ART) and to determine its relationship with various socio-demographic variables 
and HIV-related characteristics.
METHODS: The analysis is based on a cross-sectional study involving 355 people 
living with HIV (diagnosed by PCR) who were more than 18 years of age and not 
receiving HIV therapy before enrolment at the HIV clinics of two selected 
tertiary-care teaching hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan. In this study, delayed 
initiation of ART was defined as not attending the HIV management centre or a 
clinic for ART within 3 months of a confirmed diagnosis. The participants were 
selected using a systematic probability sampling technique. Bivariate logistic 
regression was performed using a backward stepwise technique to establish the 
variables related to delayed onset of HIV therapy. Factors significant at 
p ≤ 0.20 were considered for multivariate analysis, which was used to describe 
the association between independent factors and delayed initiation of treatment.
RESULTS: Delayed onset of ART was observed in 28.5% of individuals. Factors such 
as no schooling (AOR = 5.92; 95% CI: 1.38-25.41; p = 0.017) and occasional 
household income (AOR = 3.88; 95% CI: 1.01-14.89; p = 0.048) were significantly 
associated with late onset of ART. Our research findings also indicated that the 
main reasons for late beginning of HIV therapy were: feeling healthy (45.5%), 
did not have time to go to the HIV treatment centre (42.6%), did not want to 
discuss HIV test result (37.6%), and fear of stigma and discrimination within 
their community (35.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: Late commencement of HIV therapy in Pakistan is common, and an 
improved connection is needed between identification of HIV and beginning of 
therapy. HIV management centres should counsel and monitor patients from the 
time of a positive HIV test result until they initiate therapy.

Excess mortality and life-years lost in people with bipolar disorder: an 11-year 
population-based cohort study.

AIMS: Bipolar disorder is associated with premature mortality, but evidence is 
mostly derived from Western countries. There has been no research evaluating 
shortened lifespan in bipolar disorder using life-years lost (LYLs), which is a 
recently developed mortality metric taking into account illness onset for life 
expectancy estimation. The current study aimed to examine the extent of 
premature mortality in bipolar disorder patients relative to the general 
population in Hong Kong (HK) in terms of standardised mortality ratio (SMR) and 
excess LYLs, and changes of mortality rate over time.
METHODS: This population-based cohort study investigated excess mortality in 12 
556 bipolar disorder patients between 2008 and 2018, by estimating all-cause and 
cause-specific SMRs, and LYLs. Trends in annual SMRs over the 11-year study 
period were assessed. Study data were retrieved from a territory-wide 
medical-record database of HK public healthcare services.
RESULTS: Patients had higher all-cause [SMR: 2.60 (95% CI: 2.45-2.76)], 
natural-cause [SMR: 1.90 (95% CI: 1.76-2.05)] and unnatural-cause [SMR: 8.63 
(95% CI: 7.34-10.03)] mortality rates than the general population. Respiratory 
diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancers accounted for the majority of 
deaths. Men and women with bipolar disorder had 6.78 (95% CI: 6.00-7.84) years 
and 7.35 (95% CI: 6.75-8.06) years of excess LYLs, respectively. The overall 
mortality gap remained similar over time, albeit slightly improved in men with 
bipolar disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: Bipolar disorder is associated with increased premature mortality 
and substantially reduced lifespan in a predominantly Chinese population, with 
excess deaths mainly attributed to natural causes. Persistent mortality gap 
underscores an urgent need for targeted interventions to improve physical health 
of patients with bipolar disorder.
