an important tool for establishing animal models to investigate the pathogenesis 
of disease and identify effective treatments. Here we focus on the tools for 
gene editing, especially CRISPR/Cas9, and discuss their application for 
generating animal models that can recapitulate the brain pathology seen in human 
diseases. We also highlight the advantages and disadvantages of establishing 
genetically modified animal models. Finally, we discuss recent findings to 
resolve technical issues related to the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for generating animal 
models of brain diseases.

The importance of childhood circumstances, broadly defined, for shaping adult 
health and longevity is well-established. But the significance of one of the 
most prevalent childhood adversities-exposure to problem drinkers-has been 
understudied from a sociological perspective and remains poorly understood. We 
address this gap by drawing on cumulative inequality theory, using data from the 
1988-2011 National Health Interview Survey-Linked Mortality Files, and 
estimating Cox proportional hazards models to examine the relationship between 
exposure to problem drinkers in childhood and adult mortality risk. Childhood 
exposure to problem drinkers is common (nearly 1 in 5 individuals were exposed) 
and elevates adult overall and cause-specific mortality risk. Compared to 
individuals who had not lived with a problem drinker during childhood, those who 
had done so suffered 17 percent higher risk of death (p<.001) over the follow-up 
period, net of age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We find compelling evidence that 
the duration, source, and intensity of exposure to problem drinkers in childhood 
contributes to inequality in adult mortality risk. Favorable socioeconomic 
status in adulthood does not ameliorate the consequences of childhood exposure 
to problem drinkers. The primary intervening mechanisms are risky behaviors, 
including adult drinking and smoking. The findings-which reveal that the 
influence of problem drinking is far-reaching and long-term-should inform 
policies to improve childhood circumstances, reduce detrimental effects of 
problem drinking, and increase life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Bronchodilators such as long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) 
and long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) are central to the pharmacological 
management of COPD. Dual bronchodilation with umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI; 
62.5/25 μg) is a novel LAMA/LABA combination approved for maintenance treatment 
for patients with COPD.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
maintenance treatment with UMEC/VI compared with tiotropium (TIO) 18 μg, open 
dual LAMA + LABA treatment, or no long-acting bronchodilator treatment in 
patients with moderate to very severe COPD.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the costs and outcomes 
associated with UMEC/VI treatment in patients with moderate to very severe COPD 
(GSK study number: HO-13-13411). Clinical efficacy, costs, utilities, and 
mortality obtained from the published literature were used as the model inputs. 
Costs are presented in US dollars based on 2015 prices. The model outputs are 
total costs, drug costs, other medical costs, number of COPD exacerbations, and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs and outcomes were discounted at a 3% 
annual rate. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effects of 
changing parameters on the uncertainty of the results.
RESULTS: UMEC/VI treatment for moderate to very severe COPD was associated with 
lower lifetime medical costs ($82,344) compared with TIO ($88,822), open dual 
LAMA + LABA treatment ($114,442), and no long-acting bronchodilator ($86,751). 
Fewer exacerbations were predicted to occur with UMEC/VI treatment compared with 
no long-acting bronchodilator treatment. UMEC/VI provided an 0.11 and 0.25 
increase in QALYs compared with TIO and no long-acting bronchodilator treatment, 
and as such, dominated these cost-effectiveness analyses. Sensitivity analyses 
confirmed that the results were robust.
CONCLUSION: The results from this model suggest that UMEC/VI treatment would be 
dominant compared with TIO and no long-acting bronchodilator treatment, and less 
costly than open dual LAMA + LABA treatment in patients with moderate to very 
severe COPD.

Sex differences in mortality are pervasive in vertebrates, and usually result in 
shorter life spans in the larger sex, although the underlying mechanisms are 
still unclear. On the other hand, differences in frailty among individuals (i.e. 
individual heterogeneity), can play a major role in shaping demographic 
trajectories in wild populations. The link between these two processes has 
seldom been explored. We used Bayesian survival trajectory analysis to study 
age-specific mortality trajectories in the Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter 
nisus), a monogamous raptor with reversed sexual size dimorphism. We tested the 
effect of individual heterogeneity on age-specific mortality, and the extent by 
which this heterogeneity was determined by average reproductive output and wing 
length as measures of an individual's frailty. We found that sex differences in 
age-specific mortality were primarily driven by the differences in individual 
heterogeneity between the two sexes. Females were more heterogeneous than males 
in their level of frailty. Thus, a larger number of females with low frailty are 
able to survive to older ages than males, with life expectancy for the least 
frail adult females reaching up to 4·23 years, while for the least frail adult 
males it was of 2·68 years. We found that 50% of this heterogeneity was 
determined by average reproductive output and wing length in both sexes. For 
both, individuals with high average reproductive output had also higher chances 
to survive. However, the effect of wing length was different between the two 
sexes. While larger females had higher survival, larger males had lower chances 
to survive. Our results contribute a novel perspective to the ongoing debate 
about the mechanisms that drive sex differences in vital rates in vertebrates. 
Although we found that variables that relate to the cost of reproduction and 
sexual dimorphism are at least partially involved in determining these sex 
differences, it is through their effect on the level of frailty that they affect 
age patterns of mortality. Therefore, our results raise the possibility that 
observed differences in age-specific demographic rates may in fact be driven by 
differences in individual heterogeneity.

Sonography of Arteriovenous Fistulas and Grafts.

Alabama.

Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) are the vascular 
accesses of choice for long-term hemodialysis. Strategies to establish and 
maintain functioning AVFs and AVGs are essential. In addition to clinical 
evaluation, ultrasound plays a critical role in the evaluation and maintenance 
of AVFs and AVGs. AVFs have a high rate of failure to mature which can be 
reliably diagnosed with ultrasound. Treatable etiologies of the failure to 
mature can often be diagnosed with ultrasound. Causes of secondary AVG failure 
can also be diagnosed with ultrasound and treated. AVGs have a relatively short 
functional life expectancy due to a high rate of AVG thrombosis. Ultrasound is a 
safe, noninvasive way to diagnose vascular stenosis in both AVFs and AVGs prior 
to thrombosis, potentially saving the access. Routine surveillance ultrasound of 
asymptomatic AVFs and AVGs is controversial with conflicting studies on its 
benefit. Routine surveillance ultrasound of AVFs and AVGs is not common 
practice.

Mammalian shelterin proteins POT1 and TPP1 form a stable heterodimer that 
protects chromosome ends and regulates telomerase-mediated telomere extension. 
However, how POT1 interacts with TPP1 remains unknown. Here we present the 
crystal structure of the C-terminal portion of human POT1 (POT1C) complexed with 
the POT1-binding motif of TPP1. The structure shows that POT1C contains two 
domains, a third OB fold and a Holliday junction resolvase-like domain. Both 
domains are essential for binding to TPP1. Notably, unlike the heart-shaped 
structure of ciliated protozoan Oxytricha nova TEBPα-β complex, POT1-TPP1 adopts 
an elongated V-shaped conformation. In addition, we identify several missense 
mutations in human cancers that disrupt the POT1C-TPP1 interaction, resulting in 
POT1 instability. POT1C mutants that bind TPP1 localize to telomeres but fail to 
repress a DNA damage response and inappropriate repair by A-NHEJ. Our results 
reveal that POT1 C terminus is essential to prevent initiation of genome 
instability permissive for tumorigenesis.

An ongoing debate in demography has focused on whether the human lifespan has a 
maximal natural limit. Taking a mechanistic perspective, and knowing that short 
telomeres are associated with diminished longevity, we examined whether telomere 
length dynamics during adult life could set a maximal natural lifespan limit. We 
define leukocyte telomere length of 5 kb as the 'telomeric brink', which denotes 
a high risk of imminent death. We show that a subset of adults may reach the 
telomeric brink within the current life expectancy and more so for a 100-year 
life expectancy. Thus, secular trends in life expectancy should confront a 
biological limit due to crossing the telomeric brink.

Objective: To investigate the clinical implications of p16 gene deletion in 
adult Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL) 
. Methods: Retrospective analysis of clinical, immunophenotypic, cytogenetics, 
molecular characteristics and prognosis of 80 newly diagnosed Ph(+) ALL patients 
with p16 deletion. Results: Of 80 adult Ph(+) ALL, the prevalence of p16 gene 
deletion was 31.3%. p16 gene deletion carriers frequently accompanied with high 
WBC counts (WBC≥30×10(9)/L) and CD20 expression. The incidence of complex 
chromosome abnormality in p16 gene deletion group was higher than that in 
non-deletion group, with alternations in chromosome 7, 8, 19 and der (22) more 
frequently observed. There was no difference occurred between patients with or 
without p16 gene deletion in complete remission (CR) rate following induction 
chemotherapy combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) . However, after 
three cycles of chemotherapy, the MMR and CMR rate in the p16 gene deletion 
group was lower than patients with wild-type p16 gene (P=0.034, P=0.036) . The 
p16 gene deletion patients showed no significant differences in MMR, CMR and 
relapse rate between Imatinib or Dasatinib plus chemotherapy (P>0.05) . Deletion 
of p16 gene was significantly associated with poor outcomes including worse 
overall survival (OS) (37.1% vs 54.1%, P=0.037) , lower disease free-survival 
(DFS) (12.4% vs 45.9%, P=0.026) , and increased cumulative incidence of relapse 
(P=0.033) . Among the 25 patients with p16 deletion, 14 underwent allo-HSCT and 
the median survival was 21 months, better than that of patients received 
chemotherapy alone (12 months) (P=0.030) . Conclusion: This study indicated that 
deletion of p16 was associated with poor prognosis in adult Ph(+) ALL, and the 
utility of second-generation TKI (Dasatinib) does not necessarily have an edge 
on efficacy over Imatinib, but allo-HSCT has the potential of elongating life 
expectancy. It is an important significance to define the status of p16 in Ph(+) 
ALL for predicting prognosis and guiding therapy decision-making.

ALL）中的临床意义。方法：回顾性分析80例Ph(+)ALL伴p16基因缺失患者的临床特征、免疫表型、细胞遗传学、分子生物学改变及其预后。结果： 31.3% 
Ph(+)ALL患者合并p16基因缺失；p16基因缺失组与非缺失组相比，初诊时高白细胞计数（WBC≥30×10(9)/L）更常见，高表达CD20，更易出现附加染色体异常，其中以累及7、8、19号染色体以及der（22）较为常见；两组诱导缓解率比较差异无统计学意义（P=0.033），p16基因缺失组患者治疗3个疗程后获BCR-ABL融合基因主要分子学反应（MMR）率和完全分子学反应（CMR）率均明显低于非缺失组（P值分别为0.034和0.036），且复发率明显高于非缺失组（P=0.033）；p16基因缺失组使用伊马替尼联合化疗者和使用达沙替尼联合化疗者的MMR、CMR率及复发率差异均无统计学意义（P值均>0.05）；p16基因缺失组患者3年总体生存（OS）率及无病生存（DFS）率分别为37.1%和12.4%，显著低于非缺失组的54.1%和45.9%（P值分别为0.037和0.026）；25例p16基因缺失患者中14例行异基因造血干细胞移植（allo-HSCT），其中位OS时间为21个月，明显长于非移植组患者的12个月（P=0.030）。结论：成人Ph(+)ALL伴p16基因缺失患者预后相对较差，二代酪氨酸激酶抑制剂不能明显改善其疗效，但allo-HSCT能够改善部分患者的生存，明确p16基因缺失状态对于评估预后和指导临床治疗有重要意义。.

PURPOSE: Palliative surgery for patients with spinal metastasis provides good 
clinical outcomes. However, there have been few studies on quality of life (QOL) 
and cost-utility of this surgery. We aimed to elucidate QOL and cost-utility of 
surgical treatment for spinal metastasis.
METHODS: We prospectively analyzed 47 patients with spinal metastasis from 2010 
to 2014 who had a surgical indication. Thirty-one patients who desired surgery 
underwent spinal surgery (surgery group). Sixteen patients who did not want to 
undergo spinal surgery (non-surgery group). The EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) and relevant 
costs were measured at one, three, six, and 12 months after study enrollment. 
Health state values were obtained by Japanese EQ-5D scoring and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY) gained were calculated for each group. Cost-utility was 
expressed as the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR).
RESULTS: Health state values improved from 0.036 at study enrollment to 0.448 at 
12 months in the surgery group, but deteriorated from 0.056 to 0.019 in the 
non-surgery group, with a significant difference between groups (P < 0.05). The 
mean QALY gained at 12 months were 0.433 in the surgery group and 0.024 in the 
non-surgery group. The mean total cost per patient in the surgery group was 
$25,770 compared with $8615 in the non-surgery group. The ICUR using oneyear 
follow-up data was $42,003/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment for spinal metastases is associated with 
significant improvement in health state value. In orthopaedic surgery, an ICUR 
less than $50,000/QALY gained is considered acceptable cost-effectiveness. Our 
results indicate that surgical treatment could be cost-effective.

Trends in Education-Specific Life Expectancy, Data Quality, and Shifting 
Education Distributions: A Note on Recent Research.

Several recent articles have reported conflicting conclusions about educational 
differences in life expectancy, and this is partly due to the use of unreliable 
data subject to a numerator-denominator bias previously reported as ranging from 
20 % to 40 %. This article presents estimates of life expectancy and lifespan 
variation by education in the United States using more reliable data from the 
National Health Interview Survey. Contrary to prior conclusions in the 
literature, I find that life expectancy increased or stagnated since 1990 among 
all education-race-sex groups except for non-Hispanic white women with less than 
a high school education; there has been a robust increase in life expectancy 
among white high school graduates and a smaller increase among black female high 
school graduates; lifespan variation did not increase appreciably among high 
school graduates; and lifespan variation plays a very limited role in explaining 
educational gradients in mortality. I also discuss the key role that educational 
expansion may play in driving future changes in mortality gradients. Because of 
shifting education distributions, within an education-specific synthetic cohort, 
older age groups are less negatively selected than younger age groups. We could 
thus expect a greater concentration of mortality at younger ages among people 
with a high school education or less, which would be reflected in increasing 
lifespan variability for this group. Future studies of educational gradients in 
mortality should use more reliable data and should be mindful of the effects of 
shifting education distributions.

Demographic studies of mortality often emphasize the two ends of the lifespan, 
focusing on the declining hazard after birth or the increasing risk of death at 
older ages. We call attention to the intervening phase, when humans are least 
vulnerable to the force of mortality, and consider its features in both 
evolutionary and historical perspectives. We define this quiescent phase 
(Q-phase) formally, estimate its bounds using life tables for Swedish cohorts 
born between 1800 and 1920, and describe changes in the morphology of the 
Q-phase. We show that for cohorts aging during Sweden's demographic and 
epidemiological transitions, the Q-phase became longer and more pronounced, 
reflecting the retreat of infections and maternal mortality as key causes of 
death. These changes revealed an underlying hazard trajectory that remains 
relatively low and constant during the prime ages for reproduction and 
investment in both personal capital and relationships with others. Our 
characterization of the Q-phase highlights it as a unique, dynamic, and 
historically contingent cohort feature, whose increased visibility was made 
possible by the rapid pace of survival improvements in the nineteenth and 
twentieth centuries. This visibility may be reduced or sustained under 
subsequent demographic regimes.

Intraocular metastases almost invariably arise in the uveal tract, mostly in the 
posterior choroid. They are the most common type of intraocular malignancy and 
often the first sign of tumor dissemination. Choroidal metastases generally 
appear as a creamy white or pale yellow mass associated with subretinal fluid 
and may be multifocal and bilateral. The most common primary sites are breast 
and lung. Diagnosis is aided by a variety of tests, particularly ultrasonography 
and optical coherence tomography. Intraocular biopsy is useful in patients with 
clinical suspicion of uveal metastasis but no evidence of primary malignancy 
despite systemic evaluation. If systemic treatment fails to control the ocular 
tumor, a good response is usually achieved with local therapies such as external 
beam radiation therapy, photodynamic therapy, and transpupillary thermotherapy. 
The life expectancy of patients with choroidal metastases is generally poor but 
has been improving thanks to the therapeutic advances taking place.

Understanding the Value of Individualized Information: The Impact of Poor 
Calibration or Discrimination in Outcome Prediction Models.

BACKGROUND: Risk prediction models allow for the incorporation of individualized 
risk and clinical effectiveness information to identify patients for whom 
therapy is most appropriate and cost-effective. This approach has the potential 
to identify inefficient (or harmful) care in subgroups at different risks, even 
when the overall results appear favorable. Here, we explore the value of 
personalized risk information and the factors that influence it.
METHODS: Using an expected value of individualized care (EVIC) framework, which 
monetizes the value of customizing care, we developed a general approach to 
calculate individualized incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) as a 
function of individual outcome risk. For a case study (tPA v. streptokinase to 
treat possible myocardial infarction), we used a simulation to explore how an 
EVIC is influenced by population outcome prevalence, model discrimination 
(c-statistic) and calibration, and willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds.
RESULTS: In our simulations, for well-calibrated models, which do not over- or 
underestimate predicted v. observed event risk, the EVIC ranged from $0 to $700 
per person, with better discrimination (higher c-statistic values) yielding 
progressively higher EVIC values. For miscalibrated models, the EVIC ranged from 
-$600 to $600 in different simulated scenarios. The EVIC values decreased as 
discrimination improved from a c-statistic of 0.5 to 0.6, before becoming 
positive as the c-statistic reached values of ~0.8.
CONCLUSIONS: Individualizing treatment decisions using risk may produce 
substantial value but also has the potential for net harm. Good model 
calibration ensures a non-negative EVIC. Improvements in discrimination 
generally increase the EVIC; however, when models are miscalibrated, greater 
discriminating power can paradoxically reduce the EVIC under some circumstances.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy for patients living with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has resulted in health complications 
related to a chronic disease.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of bone mineral density (BMD) alterations 
and vitamin D concentrations in HIV-infected children and adolescents and to 
verify the variations in those parameters during a 12-month interval.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study with a dual period of evaluation was 
conducted in 57 patients perinatally HIV-infected and one patient with sexual 
abuse in early infancy. Demographic, anthropometric, pubertal stage, viral load, 
T CD4+ cell count and antiretroviral therapy were evaluated. Biochemical tests 
and total body (TB) and lumbar spine (L1-L4) bone density evaluations by dual 
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were performed. Calcium or vitamin D supplements were 
prescribed if reduction in BMD or deficiency for vitamin D was detected.
RESULTS: 58 patients (ages 5.4-18.3 years; 60.3% girls) were included (T0); 55 
patients were reevaluated after 12 (±3) months (T1). Low bone mass for 
chronological age was found in 6/58 (10.4%) and 6/55(10.9%) patients at T0 and 
at T1, respectively. There was no statistical relationship between z-scores for 
BMD (BMD z-score) and the variables sex, fracture history, family history of 
osteoporosis, physical activity and pubertal stage. There was a relation between 
BMD z-score alterations for TB and HIV viral load at T1 (p=0.016). There was no 
association between duration or classes of antiretroviral therapy and bone 
density. The mean value of vitamin D in T0 was 23.43ng/mL±2.015 and in T1 
22.1ng/mL±0.707 and considered insufficient levels for this population.
CONCLUSION: Patients infected with HIV are at risk for BMD alterations and lower 
vitamin D serum concentrations; both of these variables should be evaluated at 
routine examinations in order to improve both prevention and therapeutic 
planning.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analyses of prospectively collected data regarding 
180 patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).
OBJECTIVE: To detect the characteristics of C3-4 level CSM in elderly patients 
(C3-4CSM) (main analysis) and to validate the postoperative outcomes of anterior 
cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and of laminoplasty (LAMP) (subgroup 
analysis).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: It remains unclear which surgical technique offers 
the best outcomes for CSM.
METHODS: The main analysis included 180 patients with CSM, divided into two 
groups (C3-4CSM group, n = 46; conventional CSM group, n = 134) according to the 
findings of the preoperative physical examination and magnetic resonance 
imaging. The subgroup analysis included 46 patients with C3-4CSM, divided into 
two groups (ACDF group, n = 21; LAMP group, n = 25) according to surgical 
technique. Preoperative demographics and postoperative outcomes were compared.
RESULTS: The age at surgery was higher, disease duration was shorter, and 
preoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score was lower in the 
C3-4CSM group than in the conventional CSM group. Although the C3-4 range of 
motion was significantly higher, that of other levels was significantly lower in 
the C3-4CSM group. The anteroposterior diameter for levels C3-C7 was 
significantly larger in the C3-4CSM group. In the subgroup analysis using the 
repeated-measures analysis of variance, the postoperative JOA scores, and visual 
analog scale of neck pain were significantly better in the ACDF group.
CONCLUSION: Higher age, shorter disease duration, and worse JOA scores appear to 
be characteristic of C3-4CSM. In the management of C3-4CSM, ACDF provided better 
surgical outcomes than did LAMP; hypermobility at the C3-4 level, a radiological 
characteristic of C3-4CSM, may be one of key factors affecting surgical outcome. 
The chance to diagnose C3-4CSM is increasing with the increasing healthy life 
expectancy. To enable effective resolution of symptoms, C3-4CSM must be 
distinguished from conventional CSM.

PURPOSE: Aim of this pilot study was to assess safety and functioning of a 
microprocessor-controlled knee prosthesis (MPK) after a short familiarization 
time and no structured physical therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five elderly, low-active transfemoral amputees who were 
fitted with a standard non-microprocessor controlled knee prosthesis (NMPK) 
performed a baseline measurement consisting of a 3 D gait analysis, functional 
tests and questionnaires. The first follow-up consisted of the same test 
procedure and was performed with the MPK after 4 to 6 weeks of familiarization. 
After being refitted to their standard NMPK again, the subjects undertook the 
second follow-up which consisted of solely questionnaires 4 weeks later.
RESULTS: Questionnaires and functional tests showed an increase in the 
perception of safety. Moreover, gait analysis revealed more physiologic knee and 
hip extension/flexion patterns when using the MPK.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that although the Genium with Cenior-Leg 
ruleset-MPK (GCL-MPK) might help to improve several safety-related outcomes as 
well as gait biomechanics the functional potential of the GCL-MPK may have been 
limited without specific training and a sufficient acclimation period. 
Implications for Rehabilitation Elderly transfemoral amputees are often limited 
in their activity by safety issues as well as insufficient functioning regarding 
the non microprocessor-controlled knee prostheses (NMPK), thing that could be 
eliminated with the use of suitable microprocessor-controlled prostheses (MPK). 
The safety and functioning of a prototype MPK (GCL-MPK) specifically designed 
for the needs of older and low-active transfemoral amputees was assessed in this 
pilot study. The GCL-MPK showed indicators of increased safety and more natural 
walking patterns in older and low-active transfemoral amputees in comparison to 
the standard NMPK already after a short acclimatisation time and no structured 
physical therapy. Regarding functional performance it seems as if providing 
older and low-active transfemoral amputees with the GCL-MPK alone without 
prescribing structured prosthesis training might be insufficient to achieve 
improvements over the standard NMPKs.

BACKGROUND: China has undergone a rapid demographic and epidemiological 
transition with fast ecomonic development since the 1980s. Oral health is 
becoming a major public health problem as the prevalence of non-communicable 
diseases has greatly increased. Periodontal disease (PD) and caries are among 
the most prevalent oral diseases. PD accounts for the majority of tooth loss and 
increases with age. China's third national epidemiological investigation on oral 
diseases (2005) revealed that periodontitis affected >50% of the adult 
population. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD2013) have been used to 
estimate DALYs for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries 
for 1990-2013. The estimation of burden of PD between 1990 and 2013 will provide 
a unique perspective for planning interventions and developing public health 
policies for PD even chronic diseases in China.
METHODS: We used the GBD 2013 results for Years of Life Lost (YLLs) and Years 
Lived with Disability (YLDs) to calculate Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) 
for PD in China. PD standardized DALYs rate (SDR) per 100,000 persons, the 
percentage of PD standardized DALYs rate (% PD SDR) in all diseases DALYs, and 
variance ratio of these two indexes between the years of 1990 and 2013 were 
compared by province, gender and age groups.
RESULTS: Nationwide, compared to 1990, the SDR in 2013 increased slightly from 
24.7 to 25.7, while the variance ratio of SDR for provinces in the middle, west 
and south of China showed a greater variation(4.8-6.2%). The % PD SDR in all 
disease DALYs increased from 0.06 to 0.11% for all groups. The four highest 
variance ratios % PD SDR in all diseases DALYs between 1990 and 2013 occurred in 
the west of China (97, 98.6, 108.4 and 112.8%). The PD SDR changed slightly in 
the women (20.3 to 21.7), meanwhile the variance ratio of PD SDR and % PD SDR in 
all diseases DALYs for the women (6.7 and 94.5%) was also higher than for men 
(2.1 and 60.6%). The highest variance ratio % PD SDR in all oral diseases DALYs 
occurred between 1990 and 2013 in ages 20 to 24 (50.7%) and 25 to 29 years 
(50.5%).
CONCLUSION: The PD standardized DALYs rate and % PD SDR in all diseases DALYs in 
China in 2013 has increased from 1990. Especially, the variance ratio of % PD 
SDR in all disease DALYs among Young population and women, in the west provinces 
of China have been becoming the highest in all age groups and national wide. 
Future intervention measurements should include young women of child-bearing age 
because women's health impacts infant health. Periodontal disease has risk 
factors in common with a number of other non-communicable diseases (NCD) and 
conditions, and focusing on the common behavioral and environmental risk factors 
would be instrumental in the effective prevention of periodontal disease.

BACKGROUND: Experts recommend that clinicians assess motivational factors before 
initiating care for pediatric obesity. Currently, there are no well-established 
clinical tools available for assessing motivation in youth with obesity or their 
families. This represents an important gap in knowledge since motivation-related 
information may shed light on which patients might fail to complete treatment 
programs. Our study was designed to evaluate the measurement properties and 
utility of the Readiness and Motivational Interview for Families (RMI-Family), a 
structured interview that utilizes a motivational interviewing approach to (i) 
assess motivational factors in youth and their parents, and (ii) examine the 
degree to which motivation and motivation-related concordance between youth and 
parents are related to making changes to lifestyle habits for managing obesity 
in youth.
METHODS: From 2016 to 2020, this prospective study will include youth with 
obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥97th percentile; 13-17 years old; n = 250) and 
their parents (n = 250). The study will be conducted at two primary-level, 
multidisciplinary obesity management clinics based at children's hospitals in 
Alberta, Canada. Participants will be recruited and enrolled after referral to 
these clinics, but prior to initiating clinical care. Each youth and their 
parent will complete the RMI-Family (~1.5 h) at baseline, and 6- and 12-months 
post-baseline. Individual (i.e., youth or parent) and family-level (i.e., across 
youth and parent) responses to interview questions will be scored, as will 
aspects of interview administration (e.g., fidelity to motivational interviewing 
tenets). The RMI-Family will also be examined for test-retest reliability. Youth 
data collected at each time point will include demography, anthropometry, 
lifestyle habits, psychosocial functioning, and health services utilization. 
Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between individual and 
family-level interview scores on the RMI-Family and these clinical measures will 
be examined.
DISCUSSION: As a measurement tool drawing on family-centered care and 
motivational interviewing, the RMI-Family was designed to increase understanding 
of the role of motivational factors in pediatric obesity management, allowing 
healthcare providers and policymakers to manage pediatric obesity more 
effectively and efficiently. Findings will help to create an innovative, 
tailored model of health care delivery that uses resources judiciously and is 
designed to best meet families' needs.

BACKGROUND: Challenges commonly encountered in HTA of orphan medicinal products 
(OMPs) were identified in Advance-HTA. Since then, new initiatives have been 
developed to specifically address issues related to HTA of OMPs.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This study aimed to understand why these new HTA 
initiatives in England, Scotland and at European-level were established and 
whether they resolve the challenges of OMPs. The work of Advance-HTA was updated 
with a literature review and a conceptual framework of clinical, regulatory and 
economic challenges for OMPs was developed. The new HTA programmes were 
critiqued against the conceptual framework and outstanding challenges 
identified.
RESULTS: The new programmes in England and Scotland recognise the challenges 
identified in demonstrating the value of ultra-OMPs (and OMPs) and that they 
require a different process to standard HTA approaches. Wider considerations of 
disease and treatment experiences from a multi-stakeholder standpoint are 
needed, combined with other measures to deal with uncertainty (e.g. managed 
entry agreements). While approaches to assessing this new view of value of OMPs, 
extending beyond cost/QALY frameworks, differ, their criteria are similar. These 
are complemented by a European initiative that fosters multi-stakeholder 
dialogue and consensus about value determinants throughout the life-cycle of an 
OMP.
CONCLUSION: New HTA programmes specific to OMPs have been developed but 
questions remain about whether they sufficiently capture value and manage 
uncertainty in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: In "Global health 2035: a world converging within a generation," The 
Lancet Commission on Investing in Health (CIH) adds the value of increased life 
expectancy to the value of growth in gross domestic product (GDP) when assessing 
national well-being. To value changes in life expectancy, the CIH relies on 
several strong assumptions to bridge gaps in the empirical research. It finds 
that the value of a life year (VLY) averages 2.3 times GDP per capita for low- 
and middle-income countries (LMICs) assuming the changes in life expectancy they 
experienced from 2000 to 2011 are permanent.
METHODS: The CIH VLY estimate is based on a specific shift in population life 
expectancy and includes a 50 percent reduction for children ages 0 through 4. We 
investigate the sensitivity of this estimate to the underlying assumptions, 
including the effects of income, age, and life expectancy, and the sequencing of 
the calculations.
FINDINGS: We find that reasonable alternative assumptions regarding the effects 
of income, age, and life expectancy may reduce the VLY estimates to 0.2 to 2.1 
times GDP per capita for LMICs. Removing the reduction for young children 
increases the VLY, while reversing the sequencing of the calculations reduces 
the VLY.
CONCLUSION: Because the VLY is sensitive to the underlying assumptions, analysts 
interested in applying this approach elsewhere must tailor the estimates to the 
impacts of the intervention and the characteristics of the affected population. 
Analysts should test the sensitivity of their conclusions to reasonable 
alternative assumptions. More work is needed to investigate options for 
improving the approach.
