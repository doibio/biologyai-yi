BACKGROUND: Gambling addiction was the first addictive behavior not related to 
substance use that was recognized by the DSM-5. It shares diagnostics and 
comorbidity with other addictions. Extensive studies have investigated the 
clinical variables involved, but there have been fewer studies of related 
cognitive and social variables. In this research, an integrative model was 
developed to advance the understanding of gambling addiction, and an explanatory 
model was created based on the concept of cognitive distortions.
METHODS: The sample comprised 258 university students (59.5% women) with a mean 
age of 20.95 years (SD = 2.19). A series of questionnaires were administered to 
measure gambling addiction, depression, coping with stress, prosocial behavior, 
susceptibility to priming and cognitive distortions about gambling. In addition, 
correlations, multiple linear regressions and a simple mediation model of these 
variables were analyzed.
RESULTS: The results indicated that gambling addiction was correlated with a 
variety of clinical, social and cognitive factors. These factors contributed to 
a model that predicted 16.8% of the variance in gambling addiction and another 
model using cognitive distortions as a predictor and the maximum bet as a 
mediator that predicted 34.5% of the variance.
CONCLUSIONS: The study represents an advance by developing a theoretical model 
from an integrative perspective and providing a new explanatory model. The 
findings of this research are of great importance in the development of 
prevention and intervention programs for gambling addiction.

BACKGROUND: With life expectancy increasing, there is a growing need to train 
healthcare support workers who provide care for dependent people in healthcare 
centres and at home. This qualitative study, based on Gadamer's hermeneutic 
philosophy, aimed to understand the learning experiences of future healthcare 
support workers currently enrolled in an intermediate, dual modality vocational 
training programme with regard to caring for dependent people.
METHODS: Convenience sampling was used to recruit the participants, who were all 
students enrolled in an intermediate level vocational training programme in care 
for dependent people. Fourteen in-depth interviews and one focus group session 
were conducted with the students. Atlas.ti 8.0 software was used to analyse the 
participants' accounts.
RESULTS: The students highlighted the vocational nature of their studies and the 
need to feel competent and useful as a healthcare support worker for dependent 
people. Practice-based learning and the need for training in core competences 
are complementary and essential elements of the training process.
CONCLUSIONS: The participants' previous experiences were key in determining 
their academic trajectory and reflect their motivation and interest to learn. 
However, they feel vulnerable, unprotected, and lack training in psychosocial 
skills. Educational institutions should focus training programmes on the 
practice and development of psychosocial skills that motivate students to 
acquire transversal competences.

The average life expectancy of individuals with intellectual and developmental 
disabilities (IDDs) is increasing. However, living more years does not mean 
living better, leading to the need for research on comorbidities associated with 
the aging process. Associated with this process are the physical characteristics 
most prevalent in an individual with IDD: low levels of all physical capacities, 
the accumulation of central fat, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, 
variables considered to be some of the main risk factors of the onset of 
metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, and variables that can negatively impact 
quality of life (QoL). Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate a sample 
of 21 institutionalized adults with IDD (42.81 ± 10.99 years old) in terms of 
their anthropometric characteristics, body composition, general health status, 
functional capacity, neuromuscular capacity, and dementia/cognitive function, 
and the possible associations with QoL. All assessments were performed in the 
laboratory of the Faculty of Sport Sciences and Physical Education-University of 
Coimbra. Participants, in the present study, have low levels of physical fitness 
and high metabolic and cardiovascular markets, which need to be improved. On the 
other hand, functional and neuromuscular ability seems to be associated with QoL 
(p ≤ 0.05). This study highlights the role of primary and secondary care 
providers in diagnosis, prevention, and supporting individuals with IDDs to 
promote QoL.

BACKGROUND: Extremely low birth weight (< 1000 g) still influences postsurgical 
prognosis in the neonatal and infantile periods. Additionally, the life 
expectancy of neonates with trisomy 18 is extremely poor owing to various 
comorbidities. Therefore, it takes courage to perform laparotomy for the purpose 
of treatment of congenital multiple intestinal atresia in a baby with an 
unpredictable life prognosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: Fetal ultrasonography revealed cardiac malformation, 
intestinal dilation, and physical characteristics suggestive of a chromosomal 
abnormality in this case. The patient was diagnosed with trisomy 18 after birth, 
with an extremely low birth weight. An atrial septal defect, ventricular septal 
defect, dilated jejunum, and a very thin collapsed small intestine were found on 
ultrasonography. With a diagnosis of congenital small intestinal atresia, a 
challenging laparotomy was done at 3 days of age, with jejunal atresia and 
multiple distal small intestinal atresia were observed. The jejunal end and 
distal small intestinal stump were separated into stomas at the wound edge. 
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis developed at the age of 3 months and resolved with 
medication. The patient gained weight (2 kg) by daily stool injection into anal 
side of the intestine and decompression against poor peritonitis of dilated 
jejunum using enteral feeding tube for the long period. Finally, we could 
perform intestinal reconstruction safely and successfully at the age of 
9 months. Tracheotomy was performed due to difficulty in extubation associated 
with chronic lung disease. The patient was discharged at the age of 1 year and 
3 months, and no major problems were noted at the age of 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS: We treat congenital intestinal atresia in extremely low birth 
weight infants with severe chromosomal abnormalities and severe cardiac 
malformations as follows: Stoma creation is performed quickly to avoid 
deterioration of the patient's hemodynamics. After that, while continuing 
enteric management, palliative cardiovascular surgery is performed as necessary, 
and the patient's body weight and intestinal tract status are determined to 
allow safe intestinal reconstruction.

BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 aggravated already 
existing difficulties and added new challenges for students. Owing to the gap 
between needed and available psychological services, group interventions may 
offer a helpful strategy for student mental health promotion.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the acceptability and feasibility of 
a 4-week online support group program designed for mental health promotion 
tailored to graduate students at a Brazilian public university in the context of 
the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2022 to June 2022).
METHODS: Participants in the program took part in online support groups based on 
a pilot group facilitated by a trained clinical psychologist. Self-administered, 
standardized web-based questionnaires were assessed at the baseline (T0; before 
the intervention), postintervention (T2), and follow-up (T3; after 4-6 weeks) 
time points. We measured sociodemographic variables, treatment credibility and 
expectancy (Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire), satisfaction (Client 
Satisfaction Questionnaire), negative effects of the intervention (Negative 
Effects Questionnaire), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
[PHQ-9]), and participants' quality of life (abbreviated World Health 
Organization Quality of Life assessment). A 9-answer option questionnaire and 
open-ended questions also assessed the group's perceived positive and negative 
outcomes.
RESULTS: The total sample comprised 32 participants. Most (23/32, 72%) were 
doctoral students. Credibility and expectancy scores were high. Participants' 
satisfaction (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire) with the program was high at 
the postintervention (T2) and follow-up (T3) evaluations (T2: mean 28.66, SD 
3.02; T3: mean 27.91, SD 3.02). Most participants reported that they could learn 
from other participants' experiences (T2: 29/32, 91%; T3: 27/32, 84%) and felt 
encouraged to take better care of themselves (T2: 22/32, 69%; T3: 24/32, 75%). 
None of the participants reported that they had no benefits from the program. 
The PHQ-9 scores showed mild to moderate depressive symptoms (mean 9.59, SD 
6.34), whereas the answers of 9% (3/32) of the participants to the PHQ-9 item 9 
indicated suicidality at baseline (T0). Finally, the 4 domains of quality of 
life (physical: P=.01; psychological: P=.004; social: P=.02; and environmental: 
P<.001) showed a slight and statistically significant improvement at the 
postintervention evaluation (T0: mean 57.03, SD 15.39 to 59.64, SD 17.21; T2: 
mean 64.32, SD 11.97 to 68.75, SD 8.87).
CONCLUSIONS: Online support groups for the mental health promotion of graduate 
students are feasible and can be especially useful for universities with 
students allocated to different cities. They are also satisfactory and may 
positively influence participants' quality of life. Therefore, they can be 
considered a helpful mental health promotion strategy in the educational 
context. Further studies could evaluate these (or similar) programs under 
nonpandemic circumstances.

INTRODUCTION: Due to improved life expectancy in people living with HIV (PLWH), 
liver disease is increasingly being recognised. We assessed non-viral chronic 
liver disease (CLD) burden in PLWH.
METHODS: The HeAL (HIV non-virAL liver disease) study (2014-2021) prospectively 
recruited PLWH with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and 
negative hepatitis serology. Clinically significant hepatic fibrosis (CSHF) was 
defined as liver stiffness measurement (LSM) of >7.1 kPa and hazardous alcohol 
use as AUDIT score > 8. Primary outcome was prevalence/predictors of CSHF.
RESULTS: Total recruited were n=274, 92% male, median age 52 (45-59) years, 96% 
having undetectable HIV viral load. Overall, n=97 (35%) had hazardous alcohol 
use, n=72 (26%) had metabolic syndrome (MS) and 17%-27% had exposure to 
hepatotoxic antiretrovirals (ARV). Prevalence of CSHF was 20% (n=54), prevalence 
of cirrhosis (LSM >12.5 kPa) being 7% (19/274). Risk factors for CSHF were 
hazardous alcohol use in 44% (n=24), MS in 46% (n=25) and hepatotoxic ARV in 56% 
(n=30), majority having more than one risk factor. Independent predictors of 
CSHF were serum HDL (OR 0.220; 95% CI 0.061-0.790, p=0.020) (inverse 
relationship); serum AST (OR 1.033, 95% CI 1.001-1.067, p=0.045) and didanosine 
use (OR 2.878, 95% CI 1.228-6.774, p=0.015). Moderate-severe hepatic steatosis 
was identified in 52%(n=142). Both FIB-4 and APRI performed poorly in predicting 
CSHF (PPV 27.3% and 30.6% respectively) and advanced fibrosis(>F3) (PPV 17.6% 
and 5.9% respectively).
CONCLUSION: In this study, 20% of PLWH had CSHF associated with high prevalence 
of hazardous alcohol use/MS/potentially hepatotoxic ARV. These potentially 
modifiable risk factors need addressing.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy among people with HIV (PWH) is increasing, making 
chronic conditions-including cancer-increasingly relevant. Among PWH, cancer 
burden has shifted from AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) toward non-AIDS-defining 
cancers (NADCs).
SETTING: We described incidence of cancer in a claims-based cohort of Medicaid 
beneficiaries. We included 43,426,043 Medicaid beneficiaries (180,058 with HIV) 
from 14 US states, aged 18-64, with >6 months of enrollment (with no dual 
enrollment in another insurance) and no evidence of a prior cancer.
METHODS: We estimated cumulative incidence of site-specific cancers, NADCs, and 
ADCs by baseline HIV status, using age as the time scale and accounting for 
death as a competing risk. We compared cumulative incidence across HIV status to 
estimate risk differences. We examined cancer incidence overall and by sex, 
race/ethnicity, and calendar period.
RESULTS: PWH had a higher incidence of ADCs, infection-related NADCs, and death. 
For NADCs like breast, prostate, and colon cancer, incidence was similar or 
higher among PWH below age 50 but higher among those without HIV by age 65. 
Incidence of lung and head and neck cancer was always higher for female 
beneficiaries with HIV, while the curves crossed for male beneficiaries. We saw 
only small differences in incidence trends by race/ethnicity.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest an increased risk of certain NADCs at younger 
ages among PWH, even when compared against other Medicaid beneficiaries, and 
highlight the importance of monitoring PWH for ADCs and NADCs. Future work 
should explore possible mechanisms explaining the differences in incidence for 
specific cancer types.

INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an extensive impact on public health 
worldwide. However, in many countries burden of disease indicators for COVID-19 
have not yet been calculated or used for monitoring. The present study protocol 
describes an approach developed in the project "The Burden of Disease due to 
COVID-19. Towards a harmonization of population health metrics for the 
surveillance of dynamic outbreaks" (BoCO-19). The process of data collection and 
aggregation across 14 different countries and sub-national regions in Southern 
and Eastern Europe and Central Asia is described, as well as the methodological 
approaches used.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study implemented in BoCO-19 is a secondary data 
analysis, using information from national surveillance systems as part of 
mandatory reporting on notifiable diseases. A customized data collection 
template is used to gather aggregated data on population size as well as 
COVID-19 cases and deaths. Years of life lost (YLL), as one component of the 
number of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY), are calculated as described in 
a recently proposed COVID-19 disease model (the 'Burden-EU' model) for the 
calculation of DALY. All-cause mortality data are collected for excess mortality 
sensitivity analyses. For the calculation of Years lived with disability (YLD), 
the Burden-EU model is adapted based on recent evidence. Because Covid-19 cases 
vary in terms of disease severity, the possibility and suitability of applying a 
uniform severity distribution of cases across all countries and sub-national 
regions will be explored. An approach recently developed for the Global Burden 
of Disease Study, that considers post-acute consequences of COVID-19, is likely 
to be adopted. Findings will be compared to explore the quality and usability of 
the existing data, to identify trends across age-groups and sexes and to 
formulate recommendations concerning potential improvements in data availability 
and quality.
DISCUSSION: BoCO-19 serves as a collaborative platform in order to build 
international capacity for the calculation of burden of disease indicators, and 
to support national experts in the analysis and interpretation of 
country-specific data, including their strengths and weaknesses. Challenges 
include inherent differences in data collection and reporting systems between 
countries, as well as assumptions that have to be made during the calculation 
process.

BACKGROUND: The importance of sleep on cardiovascular health has been 
increasingly acknowledged. However, the effect of combined sleep behaviors on 
life expectancy remains understudied.
AIM: To investigate the association between sleep patterns with total and 
cause-specific mortality and life expectancy, using a nationally representative 
sample of US adults.
DESIGN: Population based cohort study.
METHODS: This cohort study included 172,321 adults aged 18 years or older in the 
National Health Interview Survey (2013-2018) with linkage to the National Death 
Index records up to December 31st, 2019. The life expectancy at age 30 years by 
the number of low-risk sleep score was estimated using a flexible parametric 
survival model.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 4.3 years, of the 172,321 adults (50.9% 
women; mean [SE] age, 46.98 [0.10] years), 8,681 individuals died. The adjusted 
hazard ratios (95% CI) of participants with five versus 0-1 low-risk sleep 
factors for all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality were 0.70 
(0.63-0.77), 0.79 (0.67-0.93) and 0.81 (0.66-0.98), respectively. Nearly 8% 
(population attributable fraction 7.9%, 95% CI: 5.5-10.4) of mortality in this 
cohort could be attributed to suboptimal sleep patterns. When compared to those 
with 0-1 low-risk sleep factors, life expectancy at age 30 years for individuals 
with all five low-risk sleep factors was 4.7 (95% CI: 2.7-6.7) years greater for 
men and 2.4 (95% CI: 0.4-4.4) years greater for women.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that greater adherence to a low-risk sleep 
pattern may lead to significant gains in life expectancy among US adults.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a public health challenge that 
can degenerate into acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) if not properly 
managed. HIV infection shortens life expectancy to about 5 to 10 years compared 
to noninfected individuals. People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are prone to 
several health challenges as a result of a deranged immune system culminating in 
high morbidity and mortality. Depression is a common feature of PLWHA. 
Depression heightens the emergence of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected 
individuals, accelerates the progression to AIDS, and increased suicidal 
tendencies, morbidity, and mortality. Food insecurity with its resultant 
undernutrition contributes to HIV/AIDS-related deaths. Undernourished PLWHA are 
more prone to opportunistic infections due to poor immunity. Interestingly, 
proper diet intake can boost immunity, slow the progression of AIDS and 
opportunistic infections, enhance body weight, and retard depression tendencies. 
Undernutrition can also be ameliorated by incorporating nutritional counseling 
and oral nutrient supplementation in routine HIV/AIDS checkups. Therefore, to 
increase HIV/AIDS management outcomes, the integration of nutrition counseling, 
dietary supplements, and mental health services should be embraced. Thus, 
HIV/AIDS care centers should amplify these services. In this article, we 
isolated relevant studies from various databases, illuminated the interwoven 
relationship between HIV/AIDS, depression, and undernutrition, and also 
reemphasized the need for adequate nutritional intervention in the battle 
against HIV/AIDS. Thus, this study provides a reawakening call to focus on 
incorporating nutritional guides and mental health care in HIV/AIDS management 
protocols.

Pain-related avoidance is adaptive when there is a bodily threat, but when it 
generalizes to safe movements/situations, it may become disabling. Both 
subclinical anxiety-a vulnerability marker for chronic pain-and chronic pain are 
associated with excessive fear generalization to safe stimuli/situations. 
Previous research focused mainly on passive fear correlates (psychophysiological 
arousal and self-reports) leaving avoidance behavior poorly understood. 
Therefore, we tested whether high-anxious individuals generalize their 
pain-related avoidance behavior more to novel, safe contexts than low-anxious 
people. In a robotic-arm-reaching task, both groups (low vs high trait anxiety) 
performed 1 of 3 movements to reach a target. In the threat context (black 
background), a painful stimulus could be partly/completely prevented by 
performing more effortful trajectories (longer and more force needed); in the 
safe context (white background), no pain occurred. Generalization of avoidance 
was tested in 2 novel contexts (light/dark gray backgrounds). We assessed pain 
expectancy, pain-related fear, startle eyeblink responses for all trajectories, 
and avoidance behavior (ie, maximal deviation from shortest trajectory). Results 
indicated that differential fear and expectancy selectively generalized to the 
novel context resembling the original threat context in both groups. 
Interestingly and in contrast with the verbal reports, high-anxious participants 
avoided more in the novel context resembling the original safe context, but not 
in the 1 resembling the threat context. No generalization emerged in the startle 
data. Because excessive pain-related avoidance specifically may cause withdrawal 
from daily life activities, these findings suggest that high-anxious individuals 
may be vulnerable to developing chronic pain disability. PERSPECTIVE: This paper 
shows that high-anxious people do not overgeneralize pain-related fear and pain 
expectancy learned in a threat context more to novel, safe contexts than 
low-anxious individuals, but that they do avoid more in those contexts. These 
findings suggest that high-anxious individuals may be vulnerable to developing 
chronic pain disability.

Unmet holistic needs of various cancer populations, with examples including 
prostate, bladder, gynecologic, kidney, penile, breast, and colorectal, along 
with holistic impacts of cancer on older adults, have been defined by a growing 
number of systematic reviews. Unfortunately, there continues to be a lack of 
clinical insight into the unique needs of younger men with testicular cancer. 
Survival rate based on low mortality rates and good prognosis if early detection 
and treatment implementation grows the number of men who need support as 
long-term survivors with an average life expectancy of approximately 30 to 
50 years after treatment. Providers and clinicians need to approach testicular 
cancer survivors with the tools and strategies that meet these unmet needs for 
navigation from diagnosis through survivorship. When strategies of specific 
resources and education are implemented based on the unique needs of these 
individuals, positive outcomes and increased health care-related quality of life 
will be prevalent.

A biotechnology for personalized ex vivo gene therapy based on molecular genomic 
balancing of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) chromatin with nucleosome monomers of 
human genomic DNA (hDNAnmr) has been developed and implemented in the clinic to 
change (to "correct") mutant chromosome loci genomes of dominant HSC clones that 
form mono- and oligoclonal hematopoiesis during aging and major (oncological, 
cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and autoimmune) fatal immune-mediated diseases 
of civilization. A fundamentally new biotechnological approach has been applied 
to the delivery of genetic material into eukaryotic stem and progenitor cells by 
establishing an artificial "recombinogenic situation" in them to induce 
homologous recombination (equivalent replacement) of mutant DNA regions with 
healthy hDNAnmr. In experimental preclinical trials, the effectiveness of 
genomic balancing technology has been proven to reduce the risk of sudden death 
in old animals and to increase the lifespan of outbred mice by 30% and Wistar 
rats by 57%. The improvement in their quality of life, compared with the 
control, is explained by an increase in the telomeric regions of the HSCs and 
HPCs chromosomes by 1.5-2 times. The potential of the technology to slow down 
the hereditary neurodegenerative diseases on the model of amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis is shown. The effectiveness of this technology in clinical practice is 
presented on the example of a terminal patient with stage 4 neuroendocrine 
cancer. This technology used in the treatment of a number of oncological, 
neurodegenerative, autoimmune and hereditary diseases with clonal hematopoiesis 
is able to arrest the progression of the disease, prevent its recurrence, 
prolong the active life of a person, increase the average life expectancy and 
prevent sudden death.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelination process in the 
central nervous system (CNS) causing neurological disability and poor quality of 
life. Currently, Thai Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved 
disease-modifying therapy is costly, and most patients with multiple sclerosis 
are ineligible for treatment in Thailand as previous studies have challenged its 
cost-effectiveness. Off-label use of rituximab is inexpensive and highly 
effective in treating multiple sclerosis, but evidence of its cost-effectiveness 
in Thailand is yet to be collected.
METHODS: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility and budget impact of 
rituximab for multiple sclerosis treatment compared with best supportive care, 
the standard practice in Thailand to treat the disease. A Markov model with a 
one-month cycle length and lifetime horizon was applied to compare the costs and 
outcomes of rituximab and best supportive care based on a societal perspective. 
Accordingly, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated. Probabilistic 
and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate parameter 
uncertainty. In addition, the Markov model was used to assess the 5-year budget 
impact from the government perspective.
RESULTS: A rituximab biosimilar demonstrated higher effectiveness and lower 
associated costs, compared to best supportive care, with the highest probability 
of being cost-effective (96%). The probability of relapse was the most sensitive 
parameter according to the one-way sensitivity analysis. The calculated budget 
impact of treating patients with multiple sclerosis in Thailand was 26,360,000 
Thai baht (THB) or 844,255 United States dollars (USD) in the first fiscal year, 
and approximately 20,810,000-23,080,000 THB (666,608-739,388 USD) in the next 
four fiscal years.
CONCLUSION: In Thailand, a rituximab biosimilar would reduce the overall costs 
of multiple sclerosis treatment and should, therefore, be included in the 
National List of Essential Medicines.

Shrimp has been known for its delicacy, but it undergoes rapid deterioration 
induced by biochemical and microbiological reactions. Melanosis is a major cause 
of discoloration associated with consumer rejection. All ethanolic extracts from 
different leaves including soursop, noni, and Jik leaves were dechlorophyllized 
via the "Green" sedimentation method before being used. The inhibitory activity 
against polyphenoloxidase (PPO) from Pacific white shrimp (Litopeneous vannamei) 
and the copper-chelating properties of varying extracts were compared. Soursop 
leaf extract (SLE) showed higher PPO inhibitory activity and copper-chelating 
ability than others (p < 0.05). Based on LC-MS, aempferol-3-O-rutinoside was 
identified as the most abundant compound, followed by catechin and 
neocholorigenic acid. The efficacy of SLE at different levels (0.25-1%) for 
inhibiting melanosis and preserving the quality of Pacific white shrimp was 
evaluated during refrigerated storage at 4 °C for 12 days in comparison with 
that of a 1.25% sodium metabisulfite (SMS)-treated sample. SLE at a level of 1% 
effectively retarded melanosis and bacterial growth, in which the total viable 
count did not exceed the microbial limit within 12 days. In addition, 1% SLE 
treatment impeded autolysis, reduced protein degradation and decomposition, and 
minimized lipid oxidation, as witnessed by the lower increases in pH, TVB-N, and 
TBARS values. Sensory evaluation indicated higher likeness scores and overall 
acceptability for SLE-1% and SMS-1.25% shrimps than those of the control and 
other samples. Therefore, SLE could be used as a natural alternative that 
effectively lowered the melanosis and quality loss of shrimp during refrigerated 
storage.

Muscle foods are highly perishable products that require the use of additives to 
inhibit lipid and protein oxidation and/or the growth of spoilage and pathogenic 
microorganisms. The reduction or replacement of additives used in the food 
industry is a current trend that requires the support of active-packaging 
technology to overcome novel challenges in muscle-food preservation. Several 
nano-sized active substances incorporated in the polymeric matrix of muscle-food 
packaging were discussed (nanocarriers and nanoparticles of essential oils, 
metal oxide, extracts, enzymes, bioactive peptides, surfactants, and 
bacteriophages). In addition, the extension of the shelf life and the inhibitory 
effects of oxidation and microbial growth obtained during storage were also 
extensively revised. The use of active packaging in muscle foods to inhibit 
oxidation and microbial growth is an alternative in the development of 
clean-label meat and meat products. Although the studies presented serve as a 
basis for future research, it is important to emphasize the importance of 
carrying out detailed studies of the possible migration of potentially toxic 
additives, incorporated in active packaging developed for muscle foods under 
different storage conditions.

Pancreatic cancer (PaC) is one of the most lethal tumors worldwide, difficult to 
diagnose, and with inadequate therapeutical chances. The most used therapy is 
gemcitabine, alone or in combination with nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel 
(nab-paclitaxel), and the multidrug FOLFIRINOX. Unfortunately, PaC develops 
resistance early, thus reducing the already poor life expectancy of patients. 
The mechanisms responsible for drug resistance are not fully elucidated, and 
exosomes seem to be actively involved in this phenomenon, thanks to their 
ability to transfer molecules regulating this process from drug-resistant to 
drug-sensitive PaC cells. These extracellular vesicles are released by both 
normal and cancer cells and seem to be essential mediators of intercellular 
communications, especially in cancer, where they are secreted at very high 
numbers. This review illustrates the role of exosomes in PaC drug resistance. 
This manuscript first provides an overview of the pharmacological approaches 
used in PaC and, in the last part, focuses on the mechanisms exploited by the 
exosomes released by cancer cells to induce drug resistance.

Increased life expectancy and cancer prevalence rates expose patients to a 
higher risk of developing other comorbidities such as stroke. This study aimed 
to evaluate the risk factors for and prognosis of stroke in patients with 
gynecological cancers. A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted 
on patients with cervical, endometrial, and epithelial ovarian cancers. Patients 
were classified into three groups based on the period of stroke onset: at least 
one year before cancer diagnosis, within one year before cancer diagnosis to six 
months after the last treatment date, and six months after the last treatment 
date. Among the 644 patients, stroke occurred in 54 (8.4%). In univariate 
analysis, stroke was significantly associated with overall survival. In 
contrast, in multivariate analysis, stroke was significantly associated with age 
and hypertension, but not with overall survival. Age, pulmonary 
thromboembolism/deep vein thrombosis, histological grade, and tumor stage were 
significantly associated with overall survival. Therefore, it is important to 
establish an appropriate examination and treatment plan for patients with 
gynecologic cancers using a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates the 
patient's age, medical condition, and tumor characteristics rather than 
excessively considering the adverse effects of stroke on cancer prognosis.

Chondrosarcoma represents approximately 0.1% of all neoplasms of the head and 
neck and is considered a rare disease with a relatively good prognosis. The 
5-year overall survival (OS) rate is estimated at 70-80%, being considered a 
disease with a low growth rate. Approximately 13% of all cases of chondrosarcoma 
are located in the region of the head and neck. We present the case of a 
30-year-old patient without a medical history who reported dysphagia, swallowing 
difficulty, neck mass sensation and dysphonia that started insidiously after an 
upper respiratory tract infection. Subsequently, the patient was diagnosed with 
a low-grade glosso-epiglottic region chondrosarcoma and was multimodally treated 
with surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The radiation treatment 
was delivered with a Rokus M40 former Soviet Union cobalt machine without any
