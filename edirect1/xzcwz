OBJECTIVES: This paper presents detailed analysis of the global and regional 
burden of chronic respiratory disease arising from occupational airborne 
exposures, as estimated in the Global Burden of Disease 2016 study.
METHODS: The burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to 
occupational exposure to particulate matter, gases and fumes, and secondhand 
smoke, and the burden of asthma resulting from occupational exposure to 
asthmagens, was estimated using the population attributable fraction (PAF), 
calculated using exposure prevalence and relative risks from the literature. 
PAFs were applied to the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) for COPD and asthma. Pneumoconioses were estimated directly from cause 
of death data. Age-standardised rates were based only on persons aged 15 years 
and above.
RESULTS: The estimated PAFs (based on DALYs) were 17% (95% uncertainty interval 
(UI) 14%-20%) for COPD and 10% (95% UI 9%-11%) for asthma. There were estimated 
to be 519 000 (95% UI 441,000-609,000) deaths from chronic respiratory disease 
in 2016 due to occupational airborne risk factors (COPD: 460,100 [95% UI 
382,000-551,000]; asthma: 37,600 [95% UI 28,400-47,900]; pneumoconioses: 21,500 
[95% UI 17,900-25,400]. The equivalent overall burden estimate was 13.6 million 
(95% UI 11.9-15.5 million); DALYs (COPD: 10.7 [95% UI 9.0-12.5] million; asthma: 
2.3 [95% UI 1.9-2.9] million; pneumoconioses: 0.58 [95% UI 0.46-0.67] million). 
Rates were highest in males; older persons and mainly in Oceania, Asia and 
sub-Saharan Africa; and decreased from 1990 to 2016.
CONCLUSIONS: Workplace exposures resulting in COPD, asthma and pneumoconiosis 
continue to be important contributors to the burden of disease in all regions of 
the world. This should be reducible through improved prevention and control of 
relevant exposures.

OBJECTIVES: This study provides a detailed analysis of the global and regional 
burden of cancer due to occupational carcinogens from the Global Burden of 
Disease 2016 study.
METHODS: The burden of cancer due to 14 International Agency for Research on 
Cancer Group 1 occupational carcinogens was estimated using the population 
attributable fraction, based on past population exposure prevalence and relative 
risks from the literature. The results were used to calculate attributable 
deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
RESULTS: There were an estimated 349 000 (95% Uncertainty Interval 269 000 to 
427 000) deaths and 7.2 (5.8 to 8.6) million DALYs in 2016 due to exposure to 
the included occupational carcinogens-3.9% (3.2% to 4.6%) of all cancer deaths 
and 3.4% (2.7% to 4.0%) of all cancer DALYs; 79% of deaths were of males and 88% 
were of people aged 55 -79 years. Lung cancer accounted for 86% of the deaths, 
mesothelioma for 7.9% and laryngeal cancer for 2.1%. Asbestos was responsible 
for the largest number of deaths due to occupational carcinogens (63%); other 
important risk factors were secondhand smoke (14%), silica (14%) and diesel 
engine exhaust (5%). The highest mortality rates were in high-income regions, 
largely due to asbestos-related cancers, whereas in other regions cancer deaths 
from secondhand smoke, silica and diesel engine exhaust were more prominent. 
From 1990 to 2016, there was a decrease in the rate for deaths (-10%) and DALYs 
(-15%) due to exposure to occupational carcinogens.
CONCLUSIONS: Work-related carcinogens are responsible for considerable disease 
burden worldwide. The results provide guidance for prevention and control 
initiatives.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Endoscopic stone removal has some complications. Although 
the life expectancy of elderly patients has increased dramatically worldwide, 
little information is available on the necessity of complete endoscopic stone 
removal in extremely elderly patients. This study aimed to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of complete endoscopic stone removal in extremely elderly patients.
METHODS: All extremely elderly patients (>90 years) who underwent endoscopic 
stone removal for choledocholithiasis at our hospital between January 2012 and 
January 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. The included patients were divided 
into complete stone removal and incomplete stone removal groups. Complication 
rate, overall survival (OS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were 
compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Overall, 73 patients were included in this study. The median number of 
stones was one (range, 0-10) and two (range, 1-12) (P = 0.043), while the median 
diameter of the largest stones was 9 (range, 0-27) and 14 (range, 5-46) mm 
(P = 0.001) in the complete and incomplete stone removal groups, respectively. 
During the follow-up period, OS was 60% and 39% and DSS was 95% and 97% in the 
complete and incomplete stone removal groups, respectively. Kaplan-Meier 
analysis found no significant difference in OS and DSS between the two groups 
(P = 0.052 and P = 0.646, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Complete stone removal might not always be necessary in extremely 
elderly patients aged ≥90 years.

BACKGROUND: Podoconiosis is one of the leading causes of lymphoedema-related 
morbidity in low-income settings, but little is known about the scale of its 
health and economic impact. This information is required to inform control 
programme planning and policy. In this study, we estimated the health and 
economic burden of podoconiosis in Ethiopia.
METHODS: We developed a model to estimate the health burden attributed to 
podoconiosis in terms of the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
and the economic burden. We estimated the economic burden by quantifying the 
treatment and morbidity-management costs incurred by the healthcare system in 
managing clinical cases, patients' out-of-pocket costs and their productivity 
costs.
RESULTS: In 2017, there were 1.5 million cases of podoconiosis in Ethiopia, 
which corresponds to 172 073 DALYs or 182 per 100 000 people. The total economic 
burden of podoconiosis in Ethiopia is estimated to be US$213.2 million annually 
and 91.1% of this resulted from productivity costs. The average economic burden 
per podoconiosis case was US$136.9.
CONCLUSIONS: The national cost of podoconiosis is formidable. If control 
measures are scaled up and the morbidity burden reduced, this will lead to 
Ethiopia saving millions of dollars. Our estimates provide important benchmark 
economic costs to programme planners, policymakers and donors for resource 
allocation and priority setting.

OBJECTIVE: Observational study to evaluate the long-term motor and non-motor 
effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) on 
medically refractory dystonia.
BACKGROUND: Dystonia is a chronic disease affecting mainly young patients with a 
regular life expectancy and lifelong need for therapy. Pallidal DBS is an 
established treatment for severe isolated dystonia but long-term data are 
sparse.
METHODS: We considered 36 consecutive patients with isolated generalized 
(n = 14) and cervical/segmental (n = 22) dystonia operated at Charité-University 
Hospital between 2000 and 2007 in a retrospective analysis for long-term outcome 
of pallidal DBS. In 19 of these patients, we could analyze dystonic symptoms and 
disability rated by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating scale (BFMDRS) at 
baseline, short-term (ST-FU, range 3-36 months) and long-term follow-up (LT-FU, 
range 93-197 months). Quality of life and mood were evaluated using the SF36 and 
Beck Depression Index (BDI) questionnaires.
RESULTS: Patients reached an improvement in motor symptoms of 63.8 ± 5.7% 
(mean ± SE) at ST-FU and 67.9 ± 6.1% at LT-FU. Moreover, a significant and 
stable reduction in disability was shown following DBS (54.2 ± 9.4% at ST-FU and 
53.8 ± 9.2% at LT-FU). BDI and SF36 had improved by 40% and 23%, respectively, 
at LT-FU (n = 14). Stimulation-induced adverse events included swallowing 
difficulties, dysarthria, and bradykinesia. Pulse generator (n = 3) and 
electrodes (n = 5) were revised in seven patients due to infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Pallidal DBS is a safe and efficacious long-term treatment for 
dystonia with sustained effects on motor impairment and disability, accompanied 
by a robust improvement in mood and quality of life.

Economic Evaluations of Anticancer Drugs Based on Medico-Administrative 
Databases: A Systematic Literature Review.

BACKGROUND: Oncology is among the most active therapeutic fields in terms of new 
drug development projects, with increasingly expensive drugs. The expected 
clinical benefit and cost effectiveness of these treatments in clinical practice 
have yet to be fully confirmed. Health medico-administrative databases may be 
useful for assessing the value of anticancer drugs with real-world data.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of our systematic literature review (SLR) were to 
analyse economic evaluations of anticancer drugs based on health 
medico-administrative databases, to assess the quality of these evaluations, and 
to identify the inputs from such databases that can be used in economic 
evaluations of anticancer drugs.
METHODS: We performed an SLR by using PubMed and Web of Science articles 
published from January 2008 to January 2019. The search strategy focused on 
anticancer drug cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs)/cost-utility analyses (CUAs) 
that were entirely based on medico-administrative databases. The review reported 
the main choices of economic evaluation methods in the analyses. The quality of 
the articles was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation 
Reporting Standards (CHEERS) and risk of bias assessment checklists.
RESULTS: Of the 306 records identified in PubMed, 12 articles were selected, and 
one additional article was identified through Web of Science. Ten of the 13 
articles were CEAs and three were CUAs. Most of the analyses were carried out in 
North America (n = 11). The economic metric used was the cost per life-year 
gained (n = 10) or cost per quality-adjusted life-year (n = 3). Reporting of the 
target analysis population and strategies in the articles was in agreement with 
the CHEERS guidelines. The structural assumptions underpinning the economic 
models displayed the poorest reporting quality among the items analysed. 
Representativeness bias (n = 11) and the issue of censored medical costs (n = 8) 
were the most frequently analysed risks.
CONCLUSION: A comparison of the economic results was not relevant due to the 
high heterogeneity of the selected studies. Our SLR highlighted the benefits and 
pitfalls related to the use of medico-administrative databases in the economic 
evaluations of anticancer drugs.

Aim: This study examines how chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy's 
incremental effectiveness and cost-effectiveness profile fits into the recent 
history of anticancer treatments. Materials & methods: We conducted graphical 
and multivariable analyses using data from the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 
Registry of the Tufts Medical Center and the Institute for Clinical and Economic 
Review's analysis of CAR-T therapies. We collected additional information 
including the US FDA approval years for pharmacologic innovations. Results: 
CAR-T provided 5.03 (95% CI: 3.88-6.18) more incremental quality-adjusted 
life-years than the average pharmaceutical intervention and 4.61 (95% CI: 
1.67-7.56) more than the average nonpharmaceutical intervention, while retaining 
similar cost-effectiveness. There was evidence of worsening cost-effectiveness 
by approval year for pharmaceutical interventions. Limitations: Analysis is 
limited to anticancer treatments studied in cost-utility analyses, estimated to 
cover approximately 60% of FDA-approved antineoplastic agents. Conclusion: CAR-T 
therapy breaks a pattern of stagnant efficacy growth in pharmaceutical 
innovation and demonstrates significantly greater incremental effectiveness and 
similar cost-effectiveness to prior innovations.

With the increase in life expectancy, cardiovascular complications of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) have come to the forefront. Increased arterial stiffness is a 
marker of increased cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to compare 
both pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (Aix) measurements in 
children with CF and to compare them with healthy controls. We hypothesized that 
children with CF had increased arterial stiffness, although traditional risk 
factors for CVD were not observed. Forty-four patients and age and sex-matched 
30 healthy controls were included in the study. Hemodynamic measurements were 
compared in both groups, together with traditional risk factors. Peripheral 
blood pressure parameters of CF and control groups were similar (P > .05). 
Bodyweight and BMI were significantly lower in the CF group (P < .001). Serum 
cholesterol, HDL, and LDL levels were significantly lower in the CF group, 
whereas fasting blood glucose and triglyceride levels were significantly higher 
than the control group (P < .05). Mean ± SD Aix was significantly higher in the 
CF group (33.22 ± 13.87%) compared with the control group (24.93 ± 10.58%), 
respectively (P < .05), while PWV was similar. No significant correlation 
between PWV and Aix and fasting blood glucose and lipid profile in both groups 
(P > .05). Children with CF have been shown to have increased arterial stiffness 
compared to healthy children. Although there are not many traditional risk 
factors, increased arterial stiffness have been demonstrated in children with 
CF. The effects of this process starting from childhood on the development of 
CVD in adulthood are not known. Therefore, further studies are needed.

BACKGROUND: While there are many possible complications associated with total 
joint arthroplasty (TJA), venous thromboembolism (VTE) is both frequent and 
potentially severe. Despite this importance, there are inconsistent 
recommendations for prophylaxis based on patient risk factors.
METHODS: A predictive model was constructed to compare low-molecular-weight 
heparin(LMWH) and aspirin (ASA) for prevention of VTE-associated complications 
following TJA.The model used risks from prior prophylaxis studies to estimate 
the risk of developing a symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, 
thrombocytopenia, and operative or nonoperative site bleeding. We also evaluated 
the progression to 4 possible final health states: postphlebitis syndrome, 
intracranial hemorrhage, death, or baseline health. Within published ranges, we 
selected assumptions that were favorable to LMWH such that these analyses 
represent a best case scenario for LMWH or an alternative more aggressive 
low-molecular-weight heparin alternative (LMWHA). Events and outcomes were 
assigned quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses according to prior studies to 
determine the effect on patients' outcomes for ASA and LMWHA prophylaxis.
RESULTS: Assessing VTE risk populations from 0.2% to 2% with life expectancies 
ranging from 5 to 40 years postoperatively, patients with a risk ratio less than 
3.7 showed increased expected QALY with ASA compared to LMWHA. For patients with 
a baseline VTE risk of 1% and a 15 year life expectancy, a risk ratio of 13.4 
was needed to identify patients that would benefit from LMWHA. With life 
expectancy increased to 30 years, the risk ratio needed to idetify these 
patients was 7.4.
CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing TJA should receive ASA chemoprophylaxis in 
nearly all situations, unless the patient has a significantly increased VTE risk 
compared to the baseline population and a long life expectancy.

The study reports shelf-life enhancement of candied mango by infusion of 
gingerols. Gingerols infused product (GIP), with 3.67 mg gingerols/100 g and 
non-infused products (control) were packed in multilayer metalized (MET), and 
ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) based pouches and stored at 25, 35 and 45 °C for 
120 days. Degradation kinetics of browning and related parameters showed 
following order: kβ-carotene > ksensory (color) > knon-enzymatic 
browning > kvitamin C > kantioxidant capacity > k sensory (overall) > ktotal 
phenolics > kgingerols, resulting in multiple cutoff criteria and predicted 
shelf-lives (SLpredicted). The application of chemometrics simplified the 
kinetic interpretations and hence the predictions. Gingerols infusion retarded 
the deterioration of all quality parameters and substantially enhanced 
SLpredicted of GIP over control, irrespective of storage conditions. Finally, 
chemometric based SLpredicted of 144 days closely predicted the actual 
shelf-life of 142 days for control samples stored in EVOH pouches at 25 °C, in 
contrast to kinetics based SLpredicted of 185 days.

BACKGROUND: Smoking is widely recognized as one of the most prevalent and 
preventable causes of many cancer types. This study aimed to quantify the 
population attributable fraction (PAF) of the lung cancer burden for smoking in 
Mongolia.
METHODS: Lung cancer incidence and lung cancer-related death data came from the 
population-based national registry covering the period 2007-2016. Smoking 
prevalence data came from the STEPwise approach (STEP) national survey. The lung 
cancer-related disease burden was calculated and expressed in Disability 
Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost by gender and by year. This was combined with 
current smoking and former smoking prevalence data, and relative risks (RR) of 
lung cancer-related deaths for current smokers and former smokers versus never 
smokers from region-specific cohort studies to estimate the PAF of lung cancer 
attributable to "ever-smoking" in Mongolia.
RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2016, lung cancer accounted for the loss of over 
63,000 DALYs in Mongolia. The PAF of lung cancer-related deaths attributable to 
current and former smoking combined was 58.1% (95% IR = 43.1%-72.2%) for men and 
8.9% (95% IR = 4.1% -13.5%) for women. Smoking-attributable DALYs loss amounted 
to 2589 years (95% IR = 1907-3226) in 2016.
CONCLUSIONS: A considerable health loss may be prevented with an effective 
anti-smoking policy. In Mongolia, more than one third of lung cancer-related 
DALY loss is attributable to active smoking, and thus is potentially 
preventable. Furthermore, a gender-specific tobacco control policy may be 
worthwhile because of the large gender difference in smoking exposure in 
Mongolia. Next to this, age specific policy, including a smoke-free generation 
policy for adolescents, with targeted education, and mass media campaigns is 
needed.

This study compares the five-level EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire 
(EQ-5D-5L) crosswalks and the 5L value sets for England, the Netherlands, and 
Spain and explores the implication of using one or the other for the results of 
cost-utility analyses. Data from two randomized controlled trials in depression 
and diabetes were used. Utility value distributions were compared, and mean 
differences in utility values between the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk and the 5L value 
set were described by country. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 
calculated using the area-under-the-curve method. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) were calculated, and uncertainty around ICERs was estimated using 
bootstrapping and graphically shown in cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. 
For all countries investigated, utility value distributions differed between the 
EQ-5D-5L crosswalk and 5L value set. In both case studies, mean utility values 
were lower for the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk compared with the 5L value set in England 
and Spain, but higher in the Netherlands. However, these differences in utility 
values did not translate into relevant differences across utility estimation 
methods in incremental QALYs and the interventions' probability of 
cost-effectiveness. Thus, our results suggest that EQ-5D-5L crosswalks and 5L 
value sets can be used interchangeably in patients affected by mild or moderate 
conditions. Further research is needed to establish whether these findings are 
generalizable to economic evaluations among severely ill patients.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris) 
in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (A+CHP) in the 
first-line setting for CD30-expressing peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).
STUDY DESIGN: An economic model was developed using clinical and quality-of-life 
(QOL) data from the ECHELON-2 trial, in which A+CHP demonstrated significant 
improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) versus 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP).
METHODS: A partitioned survival model, consisting of 3 health states (PFS, 
postprogression survival, and death), was constructed from a US payer 
perspective over a lifetime time horizon. PFS and OS observed from ECHELON-2 
were extrapolated using standard parametric distributions. The best-fitting 
distributions (log-normal for both arms) were selected based on statistical 
goodness of fit and clinical plausibility of the long-term projections. 
Utilities were based on the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensional data 
collected in ECHELON-2. Medical resource use and costs were from literature and 
standard sources.
RESULTS: The model predicted that A+CHP extended PFS and OS by 2.92 and 3.38 
years, respectively, over CHOP. After incorporating QOL and discounting, A+CHP 
was associated with 1.79 quality-adjusted life-years gained at a total 
incremental cost of $159,388, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of $89,217. Sensitivity analyses provided ICERs ranging 
approximately from $57,000 to $138,000. The estimated probability that A+CHP is 
cost-effective compared with CHOP was 82% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$150,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the ECHELON-2 trial data, this analysis found A+CHP to be 
cost-effective for patients with previously untreated CD30-expressing PTCL.

OBJECTIVES: To project the social value of transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement (TAVR) for inoperable patients with severe, symptomatic aortic 
stenosis (SSAS).
STUDY DESIGN: This study used an economic model with parameters obtained from 
the literature and from US Census Bureau population projections.
METHODS: Our model estimated the economic value that will accrue to inoperable 
patients with SSAS and to device manufacturers as a result of TAVR utilization. 
We estimated individual patient value as the monetized gain in quality-adjusted 
life-years as estimated in the cost-effectiveness literature, net of device 
costs and cost offsets. We estimated manufacturer value by applying an assumed 
profit margin to revenue from device sales. We created population-level 
estimates by combining these individual-level estimates with age-stratified 
Census Bureau population projections and estimates of the incidence of AS. We 
assessed model uncertainty through the use of probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Between 2018 and 2028, approximately 465,000 inoperable Americans with 
SSAS will be treated with TAVR. These procedures will yield a cumulative social 
benefit of up to $48 billion, with roughly 80% of that benefit accruing to 
patients and 20% accruing to device manufacturers.
CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and payers should take this social value into account 
when considering decisions related to the care of inoperable patients with SSAS.

BACKGROUND: High consumption of red meat, which is carcinogenic to humans, and 
misuse or abuse of alcohol drinking increase premature death and shortened life 
expectancy. The aim of this study was to examine the association of alcohol and 
red meat consumption with life expectancy (LE) by analyzing data from 164 
countries using an ecological approach.
DESIGN: This was a longitudinal ecological study using data from the United 
Nation's (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for 164 countries over the 
period 1992-2013. In regression analysis, the relationship of alcohol and red 
meat consumption with LE was estimated using a pooled ordinary least squares 
regression model. Alcohol and red meat consumption were measured every 5 years.
RESULTS: The consumption of alcohol and red meat in high-income countries (HIC) 
was about 4 times (36.8-143.0 kcal/capita/day) and 5 times (11.2-51.9 
kcal/capita/day) higher than that in low-income countries (LIC). Red meat and 
alcohol consumption had a negative estimated effect on LE in HIC (b = -1.616 p = 
<0.001 and b = -0.615, p = 0.003). Alcohol consumption was negatively associated 
with LE for all income groups, while positive relationships were found for all 
estimates associated with gross national income (GNI).
CONCLUSIONS: Red meat and alcohol consumption appeared to have a negative impact 
on LE in high-income countries (HIC) and upper-middle-income countries (UMIC), 
although it had no significant association with LE in low-income countries (LIC) 
or lower-middle-income countries (LMIC). This study suggests reviewing the 
policies on the gradual reduction of alcohol abuse and the high consumption of 
red meat, particularly HIC and UMIC.

Impact of isolation precautions on psychological wellbeing of patients has yet 
to be fully quantified. To assess the impact of isolation precautions on 
patients' health-related quality of life and depression or anxiety scales and 
estimate per day cost of anxiety and depression. Literature pertaining to impact 
of isolation precautions was searched on EMBASE and PubMed databases and Google 
Scholar. A two-step independent screening of the articles was performed. 
Articles that compared isolated and non-isolated patients using different 
quality of life and psychological burden scales were included. A meta-analysis 
was conducted using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS-A and 
HADS-D). Psychological burden measures from selected literature were presented 
in a graph as effect sizes. Per day cost of anxiety and depression was estimated 
using pooled mean difference from meta-analysis. Out of 106 articles, 94 were 
excluded due to inclusion criteria, leaving 12 for full text review. After 
review of full text of the articles, seven articles were shortlisted for 
empirical analysis and four out of these seven for meta-analysis. The pooled 
mean difference estimates for HADS-A was -1.4 (P=0.15) and that for HADS-D was 
-1.85 (P=0.09). In the empirical analysis of psychological burden scales, the 
effect in all studies except one was negative. Results from meta-analysis and 
empirical analysis of psychological burden implied that isolated patients are 
worse off in general. The implied estimated per day cost of anxiety and 
depression in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) is approximately 
US$10.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of psychological, social and contextual factors 
across the recovery stages (ie, acute, rehabilitation or return to sport (RTS)) 
following a traumatic time-loss sport-related knee injury.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews and Arksey 
and O'Malley framework. Six databases were searched using predetermined search 
terms. Included studies consisted of original data written in English that 
identified or described a psychological, social or contextual factor related to 
recovery after a traumatic time-loss sport-related knee injury. Two authors 
independently conducted title-abstract and full-text reviews. Study quality was 
assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Thematic analysis was 
undertaken.
RESULTS: Of 7289 records, 77 studies representing 5540 participants (37% women, 
84% anterior cruciate ligament tears, aged 14-60 years) were included. 
Psychological factors were investigated across all studies, while social and 
contextual factors were assessed in 39% and 21% of included studies, 
respectively. A cross-cutting concept of individualisation was present across 
four psychological (barriers to progress, active coping, independence and 
recovery expectations), two social (social support and engagement in care) and 
two contextual (environmental influences and sport culture) themes. Athletes 
report multiple barriers to recovery and valued their autonomy, having an active 
role in their recovery and diverse social support.
CONCLUSION: Diverse psychological, social and contextual factors are present and 
influence all stages of recovery following a traumatic sport-related knee 
injury. A better understanding of these factors at the time of injury and 
throughout rehabilitation could assist with optimising injury management, 
promoting RTS, and long-term health-related quality-of-life.

Hemophilia therapy: the future has begun.

The success story of hemophilia care first began in the 1970s, when the 
availability of plasma-derived concentrates of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) 
and factor IX (FIX) provided efficacious treatment of bleeding in patients with 
hemophilia A and B. This positive scenario was consolidated in terms of greater 
safety and availability in the 1990s, when the first recombinant coagulation 
factors were produced. This meant that, instead of only treating episodic 
bleeding events, prophylaxis regimens could be implemented as a preventive 
measure. Following the demonstration of its superiority in the frame of two 
randomized clinical trials, prophylaxis became evidence-based standard of care. 
In high-income countries, these achievements have led to a patients' life 
expectancy being extended to close to that of the general male population. 
Alongside this, the last decade has witnessed further spectacular therapeutic 
progress, such as the availability of coagulation factors with a longer plasma 
half-life that allow for wider intervals between treatment. Moreover, new 
therapeutic products based on new mechanisms other than the replacement of the 
deficient factor, have become available (emicizumab) or are at an advanced stage 
of development. This review celebrates the success story of hemophilia care, 
while also discussing current limitations, issues and as yet unmet needs. The 
prospects of cure by means of gene therapy are also outlined.

INTRODUCTION: There has been a growing awareness of the need for rigorously and 
transparent reported health research, to ensure the reproducibility of studies 
by future researchers. Health economic evaluations, the comparative analysis of 
alternative interventions in terms of their costs and consequences, have been 
promoted as an important tool to inform decision-making. The objective of this 
study will be to investigate the extent to which articles of economic 
evaluations of healthcare interventions indexed in MEDLINE incorporate research 
practices that promote transparency, openness and reproducibility.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is the study protocol for a cross-sectional 
comparative analysis. We registered the study protocol within the Open Science 
Framework (osf.io/gzaxr). We will evaluate a random sample of 600 
cost-effectiveness analysis publications, a specific form of health economic 
evaluations, indexed in MEDLINE during 2012 (n=200), 2019 (n=200) and 2022 
(n=200). We will include published papers written in English reporting an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of costs per life years gained, 
quality-adjusted life years and/or disability-adjusted life years. Screening and 
selection of articles will be conducted by at least two researchers. 
Reproducible research practices, openness and transparency in each article will 
be extracted using a standardised data extraction form by multiple researchers, 
with a 33% random sample (n=200) extracted in duplicate. Information on general, 
methodological and reproducibility items will be reported, stratified by year, 
citation of the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards 
(CHEERS) statement and journal. Risk ratios with 95% CIs will be calculated to 
represent changes in reporting between 2012-2019 and 2019-2022.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Due to the nature of the proposed study, no ethical 
approval will be required. All data will be deposited in a cross-disciplinary 
public repository. It is anticipated the study findings could be relevant to a 
variety of audiences. Study findings will be disseminated at scientific 
conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.
