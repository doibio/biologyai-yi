Developments in the last century have led to an unprecedented increase in life 
expectancy. These changes open opportunities for humans to grow and develop in 
healthy and adaptive ways, adding life to years as well as years to life. There 
are also challenges, however - as we live longer, a greater number of people 
will experience chronic illness and disability, often linked to lifestyle 
factors. The current paper advances an argument that there are fundamental 
biological sex differences which, sometimes directly and sometime mediated by 
lifestyle factors, underpin the marked differences in morbidity and mortality 
that we find between the sexes. Furthermore, we argue that it is necessary to 
consider sex as a key factor in research on healthy ageing, allowing for the 
possibility that different patterns exist between males and females, and that 
therefore different approaches and interventions are required to optimise 
healthy ageing in both sexes.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with unilateral transtibial amputations (ITTAs) are 
asymmetrical in quadriceps strength. It is unknown if this is associated with 
gait performance characteristics such as walking speed and limb symmetry.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Are quadriceps strength asymmetries related to walking speed 
and/ or gait asymmetries in ITTAs?
METHODS: Knee-extensor isometric maximum voluntary torque (MVT) and rate of 
torque development (RTD) were measured in eight ITTAs. Gait data were captured 
as the ITTAs walked at self-selected habitual and fast speeds. Step length and 
single support time, peak knee extension moments and their impulse and peak 
vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) in the braking and propulsive phases of 
stance were extracted. Bilateral Asymmetry Index (BAI) and, for gait variables 
only, difference in BAI between walking speeds (ΔBAI) were calculated. 
Correlation analyses assessed the relationships between MVT and RTD asymmetry 
and (1) walking speed; (2) gait asymmetries.
RESULTS: Associations between strength and gait BAIs generally became more 
apparent at faster walking speeds, and when the difference in BAI between fast 
and habitual walking speed was considered. BAI RTD was strongly negatively 
correlated with habitual and fast walking speeds (r=∼0.83). Larger BAI RTD was 
strongly correlated with propulsive vGRF BAI in fast walking, and larger ΔBAIs 
in vGRF during both the braking and propulsion phases of gait (r = 0.74-0.92). 
ITTAs who exhibited greater BAI MVT showed greater ΔBAI in single support time 
(r = 0.83).
SIGNIFICANCE: While MVT and RTD BAI appear to be associated with gait 
asymmetries in ITTAs, the magnitude of the asymmetry in RTD appears to be a more 
sensitive marker of walking speed. Based on these results, it's possible that 
strengthening the knee-extensors of the amputated limb to improve both MVT and 
RTD symmetry may benefit walking speed, and reduce asymmetrical loading in gait.

BACKGROUND: A pediatric field triage strategy that meets the national policy 
benchmark of ≥95% sensitivity would likely improve health outcomes but increase 
heath care costs. Our objective was to compare the cost-effectiveness of current 
pediatric field triage practices to an alternative field triage strategy that 
meets the national policy benchmark of ≥95% sensitivity.
STUDY DESIGN: We developed a decision-analysis Markov model to compare the 
outcomes and costs of the two strategies. We used a prospectively collected 
cohort of 3507 (probability weighted, unweighted n = 2832) injured children 
transported by 44 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies to 28 trauma and 
non-trauma centers in the Northwestern United States from 1/1/2011 to 12/31/2011 
to derive the alternative field triage strategy and to populate model 
probability and cost inputs for both strategies. We compared the two strategies 
by calculating quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and health care costs over a 
time horizon from the time of injury until death. We set an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio threshold of less than $100,000 per QALY for the 
alternative field triage to be a cost-effective strategy.
RESULTS: Current pediatric field triage practices had a sensitivity of 87.4% 
(95% confidence interval [CI] 71.9 to 95.0%) and a specificity of 82.3% (95% CI 
81.0 to 83.5%) and the alternative field triage strategy had a sensitivity of 
97.3% (95% CI 82.6 to 99.6%) and a specificity of 46.1% (95% CI 43.8 to 48.4%). 
The alternative field triage strategy would cost $476,396 per QALY gained 
compared to current pediatric field triage practices and thus would not be a 
cost-effective strategy. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated similar findings.
CONCLUSION: Current field triage practices do not meet national policy 
benchmarks for sensitivity. However, an alternative field triage strategy that 
meets the national policy benchmark of ≥95% sensitivity is not a cost-effective 
strategy.

Over a third of breast cancers are diagnosed in patients ≥70 years. With the 
ageing of the population, the number of older breast cancer patients will 
continue to rise. Older patients are under-represented in clinical studies 
underpinning breast cancer therapy, and frequently do not receive 
guideline-concordant care. This review outlines the evidence on the efficacy and 
the safety of systemic treatment options for the management of early-stage 
breast cancer (EBC) in older adults and identifies where critical data gaps 
exist. Chemotherapy is beneficial for older patients with oestrogen receptor 
(ER)-negative EBC, whilst the benefit for those with ER-positive disease is less 
certain. Careful consideration should be given to the side-effect profile of the 
treatment regimen chosen, owing to the risks of myelosuppression and cardiac 
damage, as well as toxicities, such as neuropathy, that may impact independence. 
The impact of chemotherapy on quality of life (QOL) outcomes appears significant 
but reversible in this population. Gene expression profiling, benefit and 
chemotherapy toxicity prediction tools integrating global health considerations 
hold promise to better inform chemotherapy decisions in this population. 
Benefits on targeted anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) agents 
is maintained in older EBC patients with a favourable safety profile. Endocrine 
therapy including aromatase inhibitors is the standard of care in this 
population, and extended treatment decisions should consider effects on bone 
health and life expectancy. More trials recruiting older adults with pragmatic 
designs and meaningful endpoints for this population are warranted to better 
inform systemic treatment decisions and discussion with patients.

AIMS: The primary aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of primary total 
ankle replacements (PTAR) in the UK. Secondary aim was to identify predictors 
associated with increased cost-effectiveness of PTAR.
METHODS: Pre-operative and six-month post-operative data was obtained over a 
90-month period across the two centres receiving adult referrals in the UK. The 
EuroQol general health questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) measured health-related Quality 
of Life (HRQoL) and the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ) measured 
joint function. Predictors, tested for significance with QALYs gained, were 
pre-operative scores and demographic data including age, gender, BMI and 
socioeconomic status. A cost per QALY of less than £20,000 was defined as cost 
effective.
RESULTS: The 51-patient cohort [mean age 67.70 (SD 8.91), 58.8% male] had 47.7% 
classed as obese or higher. Cost per QALY gained was £1669, rising to £4466 when 
annual (3.5%) reduction in health gains and revision rates and discounting were 
included. Lower pre-operative EQ-5D-3L index correlated significantly with 
increased QALYs gained (p < 0.01), all other predictors were not significantly 
(p > 0.05) associated with QALYs gained.
CONCLUSIONS: PTAR is a cost-effective intervention for treating end-stage ankle 
arthritis. Pre-operative EQ-5D-3L was associated with QALYs gained. A 
pre-operative EQ-5D-3L score of 0.57 or more was not cost effective to operate 
on.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasing globally, 
which is a major clinical and public health concern due to the 5-fold increased 
risk of stroke. Oral anticoagulation with novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is 
the current primary option for stroke prevention in patients with AF, although 
it increases the risk of major bleeding. Patients with prior ischemic 
cerebrovascular events are at particularly high risk of both recurrent ischemic 
events and major bleeding. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) provides an 
alternative option for stroke prevention in high-risk patients, however, with 
currently limited evidence. Thus, randomized trials comparing LAAO to NOACs are 
needed.
OBJECTIVE: The Occlusion-AF trial is designed to assess whether LAAO is 
non-inferior to NOAC therapy for reduction of the combined endpoint of stroke, 
systemic embolism, major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium ≥ 3) 
and all-cause mortality in patients with AF and a recent ischemic stroke or 
transient ischemic attack (TIA).
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Investigator-initiated multicenter, multinational, 
randomized open-label non-inferiority trial with blinded outcome evaluation 
(PROBE design). Patients with documented AF, and an ischemic stroke or TIA 
within 6 months will be eligible for enrollment. Major exclusion criteria are 
modified Rankin Scale > 3 at enrollment, glomerular filtration rate < 15 ml/min, 
and life-expectancy less than 2 years. A total of 750 patients will be 
randomized 1:1 to receive either a NOAC or LAAO using the Amplatzer Amulet 
(Abbott, MN, USA) or Watchman FLX (Boston Scientific, MN, USA) with subsequent 
life-long aspirin 75 mg daily. Follow-up will be based on in-office and 
telephone follow-up in combination with long-term follow-up (10 years) through 
national hospital discharge registries in the individual Nordic countries. The 
primary outcome will be a composite endpoint of stroke, systemic embolism, major 
bleeding (BARC ≥ 3) and all-cause mortality at 2-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The Occlusion-AF trial is designed to compare LAAO to NOAC therapy 
for secondary stroke prevention in AF patients with a high risk of recurrent 
thromboembolic events, i.e. with previous ischemic stroke or TIA, and otherwise 
eligible for anticoagulation. The results are expected to contribute 
significantly to the understanding of the effects of LAAO compared to the 
standard contemporary pharmacological treatment in these patients.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Metabolic syndrome is currently recognized as 
the major cause of morbidity, with dramatic complications on life expectancy and 
health status. Myrianthus arboreus is a medicinal plant traditionally used in 
local communities as a safe remedy in treating diabetes and other metabolic 
diseases.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the impact of a methanol 
extract of Myrianthus arboreus leaf (MAL) in a mice model of metabolic syndrome 
induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) intake.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were assigned to the following groups: 
control, obese control, and obese treated with MAL extract (10, 25, and 
50 mg/kg) for 6 weeks. Control mice received a standard chow diet, while all 
obese mice were fed with HFD. Animal weight and food consumption were 
periodically measured. At the end of the treatment, fasting blood glucose and 
metabolic plasma analysis (insulin level, triglycerides, and total cholesterol 
(TC)) were performed. The HFD-induced inflammatory status and the expression of 
several obesity-related markers were evaluated in liver and fat using qPCR and 
Western blot analysis. In addition, the phytochemical composition of MAL was 
identified by GC-MS and HPLC-MS.
RESULTS: MAL administration significantly reduced body weight gain, basal 
glycemia, and insulin resistance, and improved plasma lipid profile compared 
with HFD-fed mice. Similarly, this extract improved the HFD-associated 
inflammatory status in mice by gene expression modulation of different 
inflammatory markers involved in this experimentally induced metabolic 
condition.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the novel applicability of MAL, thus 
suggesting it as a promising therapeutic approach for the management of 
metabolic disorders.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study 19-year body mass index (BMI) patterns and their 
(1) bidirectional relationship with musculoskeletal pain and (2) mortality risk.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We used data from the Chingford study and group-based 
trajectory modelling to define 19-year BMI patterns. We investigated whether 
baseline back, hand, hip, and knee pain (as single- and multi-site) predicted 
19-year BMI trajectory, and whether 19-year BMI patterns predicted pain in year 
20. We explored BMI trajectories and mortality risk over 25 years (life 
expectancy).
RESULTS: We included 938 women (mean age: year-1=54, year-20=72) and found seven 
distinct 19-year BMI trajectories: two normal-weighted (reference), slightly 
overweight, lower and upper overweight-to-obese, lower and upper obese. BMI 
patterns capturing the increase overweight-to-obese (BMI 27-34 overtime) were 
bidirectionally related to knee and multi-site pain. The lower obese pattern 
(BMI 33-38) was unidirectionally associated with lower limb pain. Women with BMI 
above 40 had an increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk.
CONCLUSION: For most postmenopausal women, the overweight WHO category was a 
transition. Two patterns capturing increase overweight-to-obese were mutually 
related to musculoskeletal pain, i.e., knee and multi-site pain contributed to 
becoming obese, and trajectories of becoming obese increased the odds of 
experiencing pain later.

BACKGROUND: The number of persons infected with COVID-19 continues to increase 
with deaths reported daily across the globe. High income countries such as the 
US, the UK, Italy and Belgium have reported high COVID-19 related deaths but 
low-and-middle-income countries have recorded fewer deaths despite having poor 
healthcare system. This study aimed to investigate the association between 
malaria prevalence and COVID-19 mortality.
METHODS: An ecological study was conducted with data from 195 countries. 
Spearman's correlation was used to test the association between the population 
variables and COVID-19 mortality. Generalized linear model with Poisson 
distribution was used to determine the significant predictors of COVID-19 
mortality.
RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between median age, life 
expectancy, 65+ mortality and COVID-19 mortality while malaria prevalence, sex 
ratio and cardiovascular mortality were negatively correlated with COVID-19 
mortality. Malaria prevalence, life expectancy and mortality rate were 
significant on multivariate regression analysis.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the hypotheses that there are 
reduced COVID-19 deaths in malaria endemic countries, although the results need 
to be proved further by clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Time management skills are essential for living in modern society. 
People with mental or neurodevelopmental disorders typically have cognitive 
limitations, including affected time management, which might lead to poor 
occupational balance, low self-efficacy, and poor parental sense of competence. 
"Let's Get Organized" (LGO) is a recently developed manual-based group 
intervention to train time management skills. The aim of this trial is to 
evaluate the efficiency of the Swedish version of LGO (LGO-S) compared to 
treatment as usual (individual occupational therapy) to improve time management 
for adults with impaired time management skills due to mental or 
neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, to evaluate if the intervention is a 
cost-effective way to improve the quality of life and time management skills of 
these individuals, we will conduct a health economic evaluation.
METHODS: The trial will have a multi-centre, open, parallel randomised 
controlled design. A total of 104 adults with cognitive limitations due to 
mental or neurodevelopmental disorders will be recruited from open psychiatric 
or habilitation care units. Outcomes will be measured before and after a 10-week 
intervention, with a follow-up 3 months after completing the intervention. The 
primary outcome will be self-assessed time management skills. Secondary outcomes 
will be e.g. self-assessed skills in organisation and planning, regulation of 
emotions, satisfaction with daily occupations, occupational balance, 
self-efficacy, and quality-adjusted life years.
DISCUSSION: A recent feasibility study has shown promising results for LGO-S, 
and a randomised trial will provide robust evidence for the possible efficacy of 
LGO-S in comparison to treatment as usual.

BACKGROUND: Despite routine vaccination of children against hepatitis A (HepA), 
a large segment of the United States population remains unvaccinated, imposing a 
risk of hepatitis A virus (HAV) to adolescents and adults. In July of 2020, the 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that all children and 
adolescents aged 2-18 years who have not previously received a HepA vaccine be 
vaccinated. We evaluated the public health impact and cost-effectiveness of this 
HepA catch-up vaccination strategy.
METHODS: We used a dynamic transmission model to compare adding a HepA catch-up 
vaccination of persons age 2-18 years to a routine vaccination of children 
12-23 months of age with routine vaccination only in the United States. The 
model included various health compartments: maternal antibodies, susceptible, 
exposed, asymptomatic infectious, symptomatic infectious (outpatient, 
hospitalized, liver transplant, post- liver transplant, death), recovered, and 
vaccinated with and without immunity. Using a 3% annual discount rate, we 
estimated the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from 
a societal perspective over a 100-year time horizon. All costs were converted 
into 2020 US dollars.
FINDINGS: Compared with the routine vaccination policy at 12-23 months of age 
over 100 years, the catch-up program for unvaccinated children and adolescents 
aged 2-18 years, prevented 70,072 additional symptomatic infections, 51,391 
outpatient visits, 16,575 hospitalizations, and 413 deaths. The catch-up 
vaccination strategy was cost-saving when compared with the routine vaccination 
strategy. In scenario analysis allowing administering a second dose to partially 
vaccinated children, the cost-effectiveness of was not favorable at a higher 
vaccination coverage ($196,701/QALY at 5% and $476,241/QALY at 50%).
INTERPRETATION: HepA catch-up vaccination in the United States is expected to 
reduce HepA morbidity and mortality and save cost. The catch-up program would be 
optimized when focusing on unvaccinated children and adolescents and maximizing 
their first dose coverage.

The prevalence of metabolic syndrome among individuals with severe mental 
illness is considerably higher than in the general population, contributing to 
the 15-20-year shorter life expectancy of this client population. The aim of 
this pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, complex 
psychosocial program to reduce metabolic syndrome. Members of both the 
intervention (n = 78) and control (n = 31) group were psychiatric outpatients 
with severe/persistent mental illness struggling with one or more symptoms of 
metabolic syndrome. Beyond the default elements of similar programs such as diet 
and exercise, the intervention covered medication use, sleep hygiene, stress 
management, as well as addressing spiritual needs, mindfulness, addictions, and 
self-care. Assessment of metabolic indicators were completed at baseline, at the 
end of the 11-week intervention, and 6 months post-intervention. The trajectory 
of change over time was significantly more favorable in the treatment than in 
the control group in terms of waist circumference (p = 0.013, η2 = 0.093) and a 
positive trend emerged in relation to blood glucose level (p = 0.082, 
η2 = 0.057). However, no statistically reliable difference was observed between 
the intervention and the control group regarding the other outcome variables 
(body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum triglyceride 
level, serum HDL cholesterol level, overall metabolic syndrome severity). These 
findings suggest that to produce more robust benefits, psychosocial 
interventions targeting the metabolic health of individuals with complex mental 
health needs should be either longer in duration if resources permit or narrower 
in focus (diet and exercise mainly) if resources are scarce.

Insects, similarly to other small terrestrial invertebrates, are particularly 
susceptible to climatic stress. Physiological adjustments to cope with the 
environment (i.e., acclimation) together with genetic makeup eventually 
determine the tolerance of a species to climatic extremes, and constrain its 
distribution. Temperature and desiccation resistance in insects are both 
conditioned by acclimation and may be interconnected, particularly for species 
inhabiting xeric environments. We determined the effect of temperature 
acclimation on desiccation resistance of the peach fruit fly (Bactrocera zonata, 
Tephritidae) - an invasive, polyphagous pest, currently spreading through both 
xeric and mesic environments in Africa and the Eurasian continent. Following 
acclimation at three constant temperatures (20, 25, and 30°C), the survival of 
adult flies deprived of food and water was monitored in extreme dry and humid 
conditions (<10 and >90% relative humidity, respectively). We found that flies 
acclimated at higher temperatures were significantly heavier, and contained more 
lipids and protein. Acclimation temperature significantly and similarly affected 
the survival of males and females at both high and low humidity conditions. In 
both cases, flies maintained at 30°C survived longer compared to 20 and 25°C - 
habituated counterparts. Regardless of the effect of acclimation temperature on 
survival, overall life expectancy was significantly shortened when flies were 
assayed under desiccating conditions. Additionally, our experiments indicate no 
significant difference in survival patterns between males and females, and that 
acclimation temperature had similar effects after both short (5-10 days) and 
long (11-20 days) acclimation periods. We conclude that acclimation at 30°C 
prolongs the survival of B. zonata, regardless of ambient humidity levels. 
Temperature probably affected survival through modulating feeding and 
metabolism, allowing for accumulation of larger energetic reserves, which in 
turn, promoted a greater ability to resist starvation, and possibly desiccation 
as well. Our study set the grounds for understanding the phenotypic plasticity 
of B. zonata from the hydric perspective, and for further evaluating the 
invasion potential of this pest.

Monocarboxylate Transporter 8 Deficiency: From Pathophysiological Understanding 
to Therapy Development.

Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.

Genetic defects in the thyroid hormone transporter monocarboxylate transporter 8 
(MCT8) result in MCT8 deficiency. This disorder is characterized by a 
combination of severe intellectual and motor disability, caused by decreased 
cerebral thyroid hormone signalling, and a chronic thyrotoxic state in 
peripheral tissues, caused by exposure to elevated serum T3 concentrations. In 
particular, MCT8 plays a crucial role in the transport of thyroid hormone across 
the blood-brain-barrier. The life expectancy of patients with MCT8 deficiency is 
strongly impaired. Absence of head control and being underweight at a young age, 
which are considered proxies of the severity of the neurocognitive and 
peripheral phenotype, respectively, are associated with higher mortality rate. 
The thyroid hormone analogue triiodothyroacetic acid is able to effectively and 
safely ameliorate the peripheral thyrotoxicosis; its effect on the 
neurocognitive phenotype is currently under investigation. Other possible 
therapies are at a pre-clinical stage. This review provides an overview of the 
current understanding of the physiological role of MCT8 and the pathophysiology, 
key clinical characteristics and developing treatment options for MCT8 
deficiency.

Background: Trp53-/- mice are prone to develop lymphomas at old ages. Factors 
promoting this tumorigenesis are unknown. Here, we showed human ovulatory 
follicular fluid (FF) largely promotes lymphomagenesis in Trp53-/- mice at 
earlier ages. Meanwhile, we clarified that IGF2 and HGF are important cell 
transforming factors within FF. Methods: To induce tumor formation, 5% FFs, 100 
ng/ml IGF2, 20 ng/ml HGF, or both IGF2 and HGF in a volume of 200 µl PBS, was 
injected into 8-wk-old female Trp53 -/- mice at the mammary fat pad. The 
injection was repeated weekly for up to 7 weeks or extending to 13 weeks to 
observe the accumulative incidence of lymphomagenesis. Immunohistochemistry 
staining and gene rearrangement analysis were used to identify the tumor type. 
Results: By injecting FF into the mammary fat pad weekly, lymphomas developed in 
8/16 (50%) of mice by seven weeks. We identified IGF2 and HGF in FF is largely 
responsible for this activity. The same weekly injection of IGF2, HGF, and their 
combination induced lymphomas in 4/11 (36%), 3/8 (38%), and 6/9 (67%) mice, 
respectively. Interestingly, tumorigenesis was induced only when those were 
injected into the adipose tissues in the mammary gland, but not when injected 
into non-adipose sites. We also found this tumor-promoting activity is estradiol 
(E2)-dependent and relies on estrogen receptor (ER) α expression in the adipose 
stroma. No tumor or only tiny tumor was yielded when the ovaries were resected 
or when ER is antagonized. Finally, an extension of the weekly FF-injection to 
13 weeks did not further increase the lymphomagenesis rate, suggesting an effect 
on pre-initiated cancer cells. Conclusions: Taken together, the study disclosed 
a robust tumor-promoting effect of IGF2 and HGF in the p53 loss-initiated 
lymphomagenesis depending on an adipose microenvironment in the presence of E2. 
In light of the clarity of this spontaneous tumor promotion model, we provide a 
new tool for studying p53-mediated lymphomagenesis and suggest that, as a 
chemoprevention test, this is a practical model to perform.

Introduction COVID-19 has confronted clinicians with a potential need to ration 
ventilators. There is little guidance for training medical students to make such 
decisions in future practice. How students would make ventilator triage 
decisions remains unknown. Methods One hundred fifty-three medical students in 
18 problem-based learning groups participated in a ventilator-rationing exercise 
in April 2020 as part of an ethics curriculum adapted in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Students were provided with a prompt requiring fictional 
patients to be prioritized for ventilators in the face of scarce resources. The 
authors reviewed group responses, tallied triage criteria, and identified 
approaches to triage decisions. Results The most common triage criteria were 
patient comorbidities, clinical status, age/life stage, prognosis, life 
expectancy, and an individual's role in pandemic response. Additional criteria 
included quality of life, ventilator availability, public perception, and 
patient need. Students approached triage decisions by developing systems for 
triage, appealing to empirical evidence and academic literature, making value 
judgments, and identifying adjuncts and alternatives to triage. Discussion With 
minimal input from educators, students learned key ethical principles in triage 
medicine, recapitulated approaches to triage described in the clinical and 
bioethics literature, and suggested methods for tolerating distress of complex 
ethical decisions. Medical education should equip students to critically 
consider bioethical concerns in triage and prepare for possible moral distress 
during public health crises.

There is evidence that Nigeria is already experiencing environmental challenges 
attributed to climate change (CC) and its impacts. This has clearly highlighted 
the need for knowledge-based strategies to help plan adequate mitigation and 
adaptation measures for the country. One of the basic requirements to ensure 
such strategies is the development of a database of national CC research. This 
will aid in the assessment of past and present scientific publications from 
which directions for future study can be mapped. The present study used 
standard, systematic, and bibliographic literature reviews to analyse the trend, 
focus, spatial variability, and effectiveness of published research on CC 
impacts in Nigeria. Four thematic areas of CC impact research were defined: 
Agriculture, Environment, Human and Multi-disciplinary study. A total of 701 
articles were found to be relevant and the review shows that CC impacts and 
adaptations in the literature vary across research categories and locations. The 
period between 2011 (68 studies) and 2015 (80 studies) showed a tremendous rise 
in CC impact research with a peak in 2014 (84 studies). Studies in the 
agriculture category had the highest publications in 23 States of Nigeria. The 
review revealed three research gaps: (1) lack of research that investigated the 
magnitude of present and potential future impacts in the aquatic environment (2) 
little attention on CC impacts and adaptation in the Northern regions of Nigeria 
(3) absence of study investigating the effects of multiple variables of CC at 
the same time. The findings suggest that it would be useful to advance CC 
research in Nigeria beyond perceptive approaches to more quantitative ones. This 
is particularly important for highly vulnerable animals, crops, locations, and 
for better planning of adaptation strategies.

Ageing-related changes in nap neuroscillatory activity are mediated and 
moderated by grey matter volume.

Ageing-related changes in grey matter result in changes in the intensity and 
topography of sleep neural activity. However, it is unclear whether these 
findings can be explained by ageing-related differences in sleep pressure or 
circadian influence. The current study used high-density electroencephalography 
to assess how grey matter volume differences between young and older adults 
mediate and moderate neuroscillatory activity differences during a midday nap 
following a motor sequencing task. Delta, theta, and sigma amplitude were 
reduced in older relative to young adults, especially over frontocentral scalp, 
leading to increases in relative delta frontality and relative sigma lateral 
centroposteriority. Delta reductions in older adults were mediated by grey 
matter loss in frontal medial cortex, primary motor cortex, thalamus, caudate, 
putamen, and pallidum, and were moderated by putamen grey matter volume. Theta 
reductions were mediated by grey matter loss in primary motor cortex, thalamus, 
and caudate, and were moderated by putamen and pallidum grey matter volume. 
Sigma changes were moderated by putamen and pallidum grey matter volume. 
Moderation results suggested that across frequencies, young adults with more 
grey matter had increased activity, whereas older adults with more grey matter 
had unchanged or decreased activity. These results provide a critical extension 
of previous findings from overnight sleep in a midday nap, indicating that they 
are not driven by sleep pressure or circadian confounds. Moreover, these results 
suggest brain regions associated with motor sequence learning contribute to 
sleep neural activity following a motor sequencing task.

Expected years lived with intimate partner violence: a new approach for public 
health.

BACKGROUND: Intimate Partner Violence against women (IPV) is a major public 
health problem. However, mainstream indicators used in public health are not 
designed to fully capture the pervasive and enduring impact of IPV.
OBJECTIVE: We propose a new indicator that considers the burden of IPV in women 
during their middle life years, estimating the number of years that women are 
expected to live under IPV, and provide estimates for 151 countries.
METHODS: Prevalence rates of physical and sexual IPV for a given year are taken 
from the Global Database on the Prevalence of Violence Against Women. Annual 
period life tables are constructed using data from the World Population 
Prospects. We use Sullivan's method to estimate partial life expectancy between 
the ages of 15 and 49 lived suffering from physical and sexual IPV in each 
country. The final indicator measures the number of years 15 to 49-year-old 
women are expected to live with IPV (YLIPV) in a given year.
RESULTS: Based on data from surveys representative of 92.0% of the global female 
population aged between 15 to 49, we find that ever-partnered women aged between 
15 to 49 are expected to live 4.1 years (Low Bound: 2.3; Upper Bound: 7.1) 
suffering from violence during this age range. By regions, women are expected to 
suffer from IPV during 6.0 years (3.7-9.2) in Africa; 4.3 years (2.4-7.8) in 
Asia; 3.4 years (2.1-5.6) in Oceania; 2.6 years (1.5-4.2) in the Americas; and 
1.7 years (0.9-3.1) in Europe.
CONCLUSIONS: YLIPV is a useful indicator to display the burden of IPV. Similarly 
to the mainstream public health indicators rationale, YLIPV accounts for the 
time women are exposed to IPV during their lifespan and it is standardized by 
age exposure.
