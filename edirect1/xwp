group).
DISCUSSION: Orthognathic treatment seems to provide good outcomes at relatively 
low cost. Even allowing for the uncertainty in mean costs and QALYs, there is a 
high probability of treatment being cost-effective. Cost-utility analysis is 
still a relatively new technique in dentistry and further studies should be 
encouraged.

Longevity was significantly associated with season of birth in 101,634 
individuals who died in Kiev during the period 1990-2000. Longevity values were 
lowest for subjects born in April-July, and highest for individuals born at the 
end of the year. Minimum and maximum longevity by month of birth differed by 2.6 
years in men and 2.3 years in women. It is shown that the persons born in the 
fourth quarter, died from accidents or suicide less often, than those born in 
the second quarter. That can testify their better social adaptability. Age of 
death of the persons who have died from age-related diseases (neoplastic and 
circulatory) depend on a season (month) of birth to the greatest degree. The 
obtained results testify that the early (pre- and/or postnatal) seasonal factors 
influence on age-related mortality and longevity of the people.

New challenges and old problems: end of life care and the dilemma of prognostic 
accuracy.

Dignity of the natural end of life for everybody is one of the new great 
challenges of medicine and social care for the beginning 21st century. However, 
many end of life care providing doctors are confused about how to categorize the 
help they give. One of the central problems is predicting the life expectancy of 
an individual patient. Difficulties in this field can become ethical dilemmas 
when physicians are obliged to predict accurately a patient's prognosis as the 
basis for a certain care strategy. Clinical estimation of the duration of life 
for patients with end of life cancer needs experience and training. Education 
programmes in the field should include this topic much more until now. Prognosis 
should be based more on proven indices and less on intuition. However, there is 
no doubt that daily clinical practice limits the use of highly sophisticated 
computer-based score models. Even maximal accuracy of prognosis will not exclude 
the risk of errors in a great part of patients. This limits their classification 
in care categories too strictly defined. Health care systems should avoid models 
for care with standards and budgets based on prognostic estimates and the 
medical community should avoid claim by disciplines of certain categories of 
patients defined by their prognoses. What we need is a network of assistance for 
incurable patients with single parts defined by patients needs and not by 
predicted life expectancy. Separating palliative and terminal care is artificial 
and often in contrast to the needs of the patients.

HYPOTHESIS: The operation for isolated, stenotic, and symptomatic kinking of the 
internal carotid artery is safe and effective in preventing stroke and relieving 
the symptoms of cerebral ischemia.
DESIGN: A consecutive sample clinical study with a mean follow-up of 44 months.
SETTING: The surgical department of an academic tertiary care center and an 
affiliated secondary care center.
PATIENTS: Fifty-four patients with a mean age of 67 years underwent 55 
revascularizations of the internal carotid artery. The surgical procedures 
consisted of the following: shortening and reimplantation in the common carotid 
artery in 36 cases, bypass grafting in 15 cases, and transposition into the 
external carotid artery in 4 cases.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative survival, primary patency, and stroke-free and 
neurologic symptom-free rates expressed by standard life-table analysis.
RESULTS: No patients died in the postoperative period. The postoperative stroke 
rate was 1.8%. The cumulative rates (SEs) at 5 years were as follows: survival, 
70% (10.2%); primary patency, 89% (7.8%); overall stroke free, 92% (6.8%); 
ipsilateral stroke free, 96% (5.3%); neurologic symptom free, 90% (7.5%); and 
ipsilateral symptom free, 93% (6.5%).
CONCLUSION: Revascularization of the internal carotid artery for the treatment 
of isolated, stenotic, and symptomatic kinking is safe and effective in 
preventing stroke and relieving symptoms of cerebrovascular insufficiency.

BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa, but not bulimia nervosa, has one of the highest 
mortality rates among psychiatric disorders. However, potential predictors of 
mortality, such as comorbid psychiatric illnesses, remain unclear. We sought to 
determine mortality ratios and predictors of fatal outcome in women diagnosed as 
having anorexia or bulimia nervosa.
METHODS: Women (N = 246) diagnosed as having either DSM-IV anorexia nervosa (n = 
136) or bulimia nervosa (n = 110) between January 1, 1987, and December 31, 
1991, participated in a prospective longitudinal study. Vital status was 
determined by ongoing contact and a National Death Index search as of December 
1998 (overall ascertainment, 99.8%) and telephone contact as of October 2000 
(ascertainment, 95.0%).
RESULTS: Eleven women died. Standardized mortality ratios were elevated for all 
causes of mortality (11.6; 95% confidence interval, 5.5-21.3) and suicide (56.9; 
95% confidence interval, 15.3-145.7) in anorexia nervosa but not for death (1.3; 
95% confidence interval, 0.0-7.2) in bulimia nervosa. Predictors of mortality in 
anorexia nervosa included severity of alcohol use disorder during follow-up 
(P<.001). Hospitalization for an affective disorder before baseline assessment 
seemed to protect women from a fatal outcome (P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians treating patients with anorexia nervosa should carefully 
assess patterns of alcohol use during the course of care because one third of 
women who had alcoholism and died had no history of alcohol use disorder at 
intake.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of Alzheimer disease (AD) peaks after 85 years of age. 
Although genetic factors are implicated in AD with substantially earlier onset, 
the familial characteristics of high-incidence very late-onset AD (VLOAD, 
defined here as AD with onset age >/=85 years) remain unknown.
METHODS: We collected information pertaining to the cognitive status and 
demographics of 809 parents and siblings of 144 VLOAD probands, 4235 parents and 
siblings of 793 earlier-onset AD probands, and 7646 parents and siblings of 1493 
nondemented elderly probands. Cumulative risks and 5-year interval-specific 
hazard rate ratios were calculated for AD in relatives of the 2 AD proband 
groups and relatives of the nondemented elderly group.
RESULTS: The cumulative risk for AD in the relatives of VLOAD probands was 
significantly different than that in the relatives of earlier-onset AD probands 
(P<.001), but not in the relatives of nondemented elderly probands. Also, the 
relatives of earlier-onset AD probands had hazard rate ratios ranging from 19.7 
in those aged 50 to 54 years to 1.2 in those aged 90 to 94 years. Rates 
successively dropped as age intervals increased.
CONCLUSIONS: At least through the middle of the ninth decade of life, relatives 
of VLOAD probands have a lower risk for AD than those of earlier-onset AD 
probands. In addition, the relatively increased risk of relatives of 
earlier-onset AD probands is highest at younger ages and diminishes with 
increasing age. In counseling family members of patients with AD concerned about 
their own risk, the onset age of the patient and the age of the concerned 
relative should be considered. Very late-onset AD may be a good target for 
investigating environmental factors associated with AD.

The importance of indirect costs in primary cardiovascular disease prevention: 
can we save lives and money with statins?

Ave, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3G 1A4. steven.grover@mcgill.ca

BACKGROUND: The losses in productivity due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) are 
substantial but rarely considered in health economic analyses. We compared the 
cost-effectiveness of lipid level modification in the primary prevention of CVD 
with and without these indirect costs.
METHODS: We used the Cardiovascular Life Expectancy Model to estimate the 
long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness of lipid level modification with 
atorvastatin calcium, including 28% and 38% reductions in total cholesterol and 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, respectively, and a 5.5% increase in 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. The direct costs included all 
medical care costs associated with CVD. The indirect costs represented the loss 
of employment income and the decreased value of housekeeping services after 
different manifestations of CVD. All costs were expressed in 2000 Canadian 
dollars.
RESULTS: When only direct medical care costs were considered, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios for lifelong therapy with atorvastatin calcium, 10 
mg/d, were generally positive, ranging from a few thousand to nearly $20 000 per 
year of life saved. When the societal point of view was adopted and indirect 
costs were included, the total costs were generally negative, representing 
substantial cost savings (up to $50 000) and increased life expectancy for most 
groups of individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Lipid therapy with statins can reduce CVD morbidity and mortality 
as demonstrated in a number of clinical trials. Adding the indirect CVD costs 
associated with productivity losses at work and home can result in forecasted 
cost savings to society as a whole such that lipid therapy could potentially 
save lives and money.

An independent, inverse association between cognitive function and all-cause 
mortality has been reported in elderly cohorts. The purpose of this study was to 
determine whether the same association exists in middle-aged persons. The 
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study is a cohort study initiated in 1987 to 
investigate the development of atherosclerosis in middle-aged persons. Three 
cognitive function measures were included in the second cohort examination 
conducted from 1990 to 1992 when the participants were aged 48-67 years: the 
Delayed Word Recall Test (DWRT), the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) (a 
subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised), and the Word 
Fluency Test from the Multilingual Aphasia Examination. Cox proportional hazards 
modeling was used to determine whether all-cause mortality ascertained through 
1997 was associated with each measure after adjustment for sociodemographic, 
biologic, psychologic, and behavioral risk factors. Without adjustment, there 
was a significantly lower mortality hazard associated with higher scores on all 
three measures. After covariate adjustment, the hazard ratios for the DWRT and 
the DSST remained significant (hazard ratio1-point DWRT score increment = 0.90, 
95% confidence interval: 0.84, 0.97; hazard ratio 7-point DSST score increment = 
0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.80, 0.93). Cognitive function measured in 
middle age appears to have prognostic importance for life expectancy similar to 
that reported in elderly adults.

Comment in
    Neurology. 2003 Feb 11;60(3):363-4.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the excess mortality due to remote symptomatic 
epilepsy, taking account of frequency and type of seizures.
METHODS: The authors compared mortality in persons with (n = 8,156) and without 
(n = 72,526) history of epilepsy in a 1988 to 1999 California population of 
persons with mild developmental disabilities. Subjects had traumatic brain 
injury, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, autism, or no identifiable condition. 
There were 506,204 person-years of data, with 1,523 deaths. Excess death rates 
and standardized mortality ratios were computed for the persons in the study 
with epilepsy, relative to those in the study without epilepsy. Controlled 
comparisons were made using logistic regression on person-years.
RESULTS: Compared to subjects with no epilepsy, the excess mortality was six 
(deaths per 1,000 persons per year) for persons with a recent (<12 months) 
history of status epilepticus, five for a recent history of generalized 
tonic-clonic seizure, three for a recent history of nonconvulsive seizures, and 
less than one for a history of epilepsy but no recent events. Proportion in 
remission and excess mortality showed no change over the 12-year study period.
CONCLUSIONS: Persistent seizures are associated with increased mortality in 
remote symptomatic epilepsy. Mortality is highest among individuals with status 
epilepticus or generalized convulsions.

Endoscopically placed expandable metal tracheal stents for the management of 
complicated tracheal stenosis.

Author information:

Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.

BACKGROUND: Metal stents have been advocated to manage complicated tracheal 
stenosis.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation is to review the effectiveness of 
endoscopic placement of tracheal expandable metal stents for complicated 
tracheal stenosis.
METHODS: The charts of 6 patients who have undergone placement of metal 
expandable stents between 1998 and 2000 were reviewed.
RESULTS: Initially, all patients enjoyed immediate palliation of symptomatic 
tracheal stenosis. Eventually, 4 patients developed significant granulation 
tissue and/or recurrent stenosis, requiring intervention within 6 months after 
placement of the stent. One patient required the removal of the stent and 
placement of a T-tube silicone stent.
CONCLUSIONS: Metal stents provide temporary palliation for tracheal stenosis. 
Metal stents, however, are associated with a high incidence of obstruction with 
granulation tissue. Their use should be limited to a select group of patients 
with a short life expectancy (because of other comorbidities) or patients who 
are not good candidates for reconstructive surgery and/or who refuse or cannot 
tolerate a tracheotomy.

Functional transitions and active life expectancy associated with Alzheimer 
disease.

Public Health, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA. dodge@edc.pitt.edu

CONTEXT: The concept of active life expectancy, the number of years a person can 
expect to live without disability, is used for the first time, to our knowledge, 
to examine the effect of Alzheimer disease (AD) on total life expectancy with 
different degrees of disability.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate and compare total life expectancy and average duration 
lived with different degrees of disability, between persons with and without AD.
DESIGN: Ten-year prospective epidemiologic study.
SETTING: A largely blue-collar rural community in Southwestern Pennsylvania.
PARTICIPANTS: A population-based cohort of 1201 subjects (at the beginning of 
follow-up) with a mean age of 75 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At age 70 and every 2 years thereafter, among persons 
with AD and nondemented persons, (1) the total expectancy of remaining life and 
(2) the duration lived with different numbers of impaired instrumental 
activities of daily living (IADLs), grouped as 0 to 1, 2 to 5, and 6 to 7 
impairments.
RESULTS: Alzheimer disease greatly shortened the total life expectancy to a 
similar extent in men and women, with the most pronounced reduction among those 
who were younger. Besides their shorter survival, men and women with AD spent 
more absolute years, and also a greater proportion of their remaining lives, 
with 6 to 7 IADL impairments than did their nondemented age peers. Nondemented 
women spent more years with 2 to 5 IADL impairments than nondemented men, while 
women with AD spent more years with 6 to 7 IADL impairments than men with AD.
CONCLUSION: The concept of active life expectancy adds a useful new dimension to 
the study of outcomes in AD.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of nocturia on productivity, vitality and 
utility in a selected group of professionally active individuals with nocturia, 
compared with matched controls, and investigate the effect of symptom severity, 
to test the hypothesis that lack of sleep caused by frequent sleep interruptions 
could reduce an individuals' daytime energy and activity levels.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects (203) were recruited in Sweden through 
advertisements, and their suitability for the study assessed in a structured 
interview. Controls (80) matched for age and gender were randomly selected from 
a market research panel and given the same interview. Both groups completed a 
productivity questionnaire, a generic quality-of-life questionnaire with a 
specific domain for vitality and a utility instrument.
RESULTS: The study group with nocturia had a significantly lower level of 
vitality and utility, and greater impairment of work and activity, than the 
control group. Women were more affected than men. Symptom severity correlated 
with all three measures.
CONCLUSIONS: In an otherwise healthy and professionally active group of 
individuals, waking at night to void significantly diminishes their overall 
well-being, vitality and productivity, leading to a significant level of 
indirect and intangible costs.

Increased intake of fruit and vegetables: estimation of impact in terms of life 
expectancy and healthcare costs.

University of Southern Denmark, Winsløwparken 19,3, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark.

OBJECTIVES: There is strong evidence that a high consumption of fruit and 
vegetables reduces the risk of developing many cancers. This study examined the 
economic consequences for the healthcare sector if people followed the 
recommendations and increased their intake of fruit and vegetables.
DESIGN: A life table was used to describe a base case population with respect to 
life expectancy, cancer incidence and healthcare costs. Relative risks of cancer 
for a high versus a low intake of fruit and vegetables were obtained from the 
literature and were used to simulate populations with a higher intake of fruit 
and vegetables. The empirical data consist of a 20% sample of the Danish 
population that was followed from 1993 to 1997. Civil registration numbers were 
used to link various computerised registers, in order to describe each 
individual in the sample in terms of morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.
RESULTS: The average daily intake of fruit and vegetables was assumed to be 
approximately 250 g for the general Danish population. Simulated intakes of 400 
g and 500 g increased the life expectancy by 0.8 and 1.3 years, respectively. In 
addition, it was estimated that 19% and 32% of the cancer incidence could be 
prevented. The aggregate healthcare costs remained stable, as the resources 
saved due to a lower cancer incidence were offset by healthcare costs imposed by 
the fact that healthy people live longer and require more healthcare. However, 
the variations across age groups and health sectors were substantial.
DISCUSSION: The study adopted a healthcare sector perspective. Only costs from 
hospitalisation and primary care were included in the calculations. The costs of 
changing people's dietary habits, i.e. education, information and promotion as 
well as other costs that would be relevant from a societal perspective, have not 
been taken into account. Furthermore, the transition from one level of intake to 
another is not the focus of the analysis, although it might take decades to 
observe the full effect of the dietary changes.
CONCLUSION: Empirical evidence suggests that a considerable fraction of all 
cancer incidences can be prevented by a higher intake of fruit and vegetables. 
That may result in improved public health (gain in life years) at no additional 
cost to the healthcare sector.

Does overexpression of Cu,Zn-SOD extend life span in Drosophila melanogaster?

Orr WC(1), Sohal RS.

Author information:

75275, USA. borr@mail.smu.edu

The argument is presented here that, while there exists considerable correlative 
evidence supporting the oxidative stress hypothesis of aging, key experiments to 
test this hypothesis using Drosophila transgenics overexpressing Cu,Zn-SOD fall 
short in providing validation. In particular, significant life span extensions 
tend to be observed when the backgrounds of the control flies are relatively 
short-lived, suggesting that bolstering antioxidative defenses is only effective 
in compromised genetic backgrounds. Other shortcomings of the transgenic 
approaches adopted to date will be summarized.

High-throughput immunoblotting. Ubiquitiin-like protein ISG15 modifies key 
regulators of signal transduction.

Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.

ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein that conjugates to numerous proteins in cells 
treated with interferon or lipopolysaccharide. Dysregulation of protein ISG15 
modification (ISGylation) in mice leads to decreased life expectancy, brain cell 
injury, and hypersensitivity to interferon. Although ISG15 was identified more 
than two decades ago, the exact biochemical and physiological functions of 
ISG15-modification remain unknown, and the proteins targeted by ISG15 have not 
been identified. The major purpose of this work was to identify ISG15 targets 
among well characterized proteins that could be used as models for biological 
studies. We purified ISGylated proteins from human thymus by immunoaffinity 
chromatography and analyzed ISG15 conjugates by a high-throughput Western blot 
screen (PowerBlot). We found that three key regulators of signal transduction, 
phospholipase Cgamma1, Jak1, and ERK1 are modified by ISG15. In addition to 
that, we demonstrate that transcription factor Stat1, an immediate substrate of 
Jak1 kinase, is also ISGylated. Using whole cell protein extracts and 
phospholipase Cgamma1 as an example we demonstrate that ISG15 conjugates are not 
accumulated in cells treated with specific inhibitors of proteasomes. Our work 
suggests a role for ISG15 in the regulation of multiple signal transduction 
pathways and offers attractive models to further elucidate the biochemical 
function of ISGylation.

[Comparison of three genotyping methods for the detection of HIV-1 resistance to 
antiretroviral drugs].

Highly active antiretroviral therapy has dramatically improved the life 
expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, but 
mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (P) genes confer 
drug failure. Evaluation of drug resistance genotyping in HIV-1 has proven to be 
useful for the selection of drug combinations with maximum antiretroviral 
activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the optimal procedure to 
determine the resistance profile in the laboratory. Plasma from 90 
antiretroviral-treated patients was analyzed by reverse hybridization, which 
identifies the presence of wild-types or mutations at the 19 key codons for 
protease and RT regions, and was compared with two other methods of direct cDNA 
sequencing. A total of 408 mutations were detected by InnoLiPA HIV-1, (Line 
Probe Assay, Innogenetics, Belgium), 572 by TrueGene HIV-1 Genotyping System 
(Visible Genetics, Canada), and 721 by ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System (Perkin 
Elmer/Applied Biosystems, California). Hybridization detected a significantly 
higher number of primary mutations which are associated with a high level of 
drug resistance (p <0.001). Hybridization also detected a higher number of 
mixtures of wild-type and mutant viruses. There was a good concordance among the 
three methods, although it was higher between the two sequencing methods. 
Sequencing determines a higher number of mutations, but hybridization better 
identifies primary mutations correlated with a high level of drug resistance. 
Hybridization is more suitable for detecting mixed populations and is easier to 
implement in clinical laboratories but does not eliminate the need for sequence 
analysis for detection of drug-resistant HIV.

BACKGROUND: The standard Q-TWiST approach defines a series of health states and 
weights each state's duration according to its quality of life (QOL) to 
calculate quality-adjusted lifetimes. However, a fixed weight may not adequately 
reflect time variations in QOL.
METHODS: To account for measurements derived from irregular visits and 
informative missing data, the authors estimated the mean QOL profile using a 
mixed-effect growth curve model for the response, combined with a logistic 
regression model for the drop-out process.
RESULTS: Using data from a clinical study of lymphoma patients, the authors 
demonstrated better readaptation to normal life for patients younger than 30. 
Sensitivity analyses and computer simulations demonstrated that modeling the 
drop-out probability as a function of the QOL measurements is necessary if 
conditioning by health state is not possible.
CONCLUSION: Our model-based approach is useful to analyze studies with 
incomplete QOL data, especially when approximate QOL assessment by health state 
is not possible.

This report presents period life tables for the United States based on 
age-specific death rates in 2000. Data used to prepare these life tables are 
2000 final mortality statistics; July 1, 2000, population estimates based on the 
1990 decennial census; and data from the Medicare program. Presented are 
complete life tables by age, race, and sex. In 2000 the overall expectation of 
life at birth was 76.9 years, representing an increase of 0.2 years from life 
expectancy in 1999. Between 1999 and 2000, life expectancy increased for both 
males and females and for both the white and black populations. Life expectancy 
increased by 0.4 years for black males (from 67.8 to 68.2) and by 0.2 years for 
white males (from 74.6 to 74.8). It increased by 0.2 years for black females 
(from 74.7 to 74.9) and by 0.1 year for white females (from 79.9 to 80.0).

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The majority of patients with inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD) have a normal life expectancy and therefore should not be weighted when 
applying for life assurance. There is scant literature on this topic. In this 
study our aim was to document and compare the incidence of difficulties in 
application for life and medical insurance in a population based cohort of IBD 
patients and matched population controls.
METHODS: A population based case control study of 1126 IBD patients and 1723 
controls. Based on a detailed questionnaire, the frequency and type of 
difficulties encountered when applying for life and medical insurance in matched 
IBD and control populations were appraised.
RESULTS: In comparison with controls, IBD patients had an 87-fold increased risk 
of encountering difficulties when applying for life assurance (odds ratio (OR) 
87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 31-246)), with a heavily weighted premium being 
the most common problem. Patients of high educational status, with continuous 
disease activity, and who smoked had the highest odds of encountering such 
problems. Medical insurance difficulties were fivefold more common in IBD 
patients compared with controls (OR 5.4 (95% CI 2.3-13)) although no specific 
disease or patient characteristics were identified as associated with such 
difficulties.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first detailed case control study that has investigated 
insurance difficulties among IBD patients. Acquiring life and medical insurance 
constituted a major problem for IBD patients in this study. These results are 
likely to be more widely representative given that most insurance companies use 
international guidelines for risk assessment. In view of the recent advances in 
therapy and promising survival data on IBD patients, evidence based guidelines 
for risk assessment of IBD patients by insurance companies should be drawn up to 
prevent possible discriminatory practices.

BACKGROUND: Peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin therapy in previously 
untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C yields the highest sustained 
virological response rates of any treatment strategy but is expensive.
AIMS: To estimate the cost effectiveness of treatment with peginterferon 
alpha-2b plus ribavirin compared with interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin for 
initial treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C.
METHODS: Individual patient level data from a randomised clinical trial with 
peginterferon plus ribavirin were applied to a previously published and 
validated Markov model to project lifelong clinical outcomes. Quality of life 
and economic estimates were based on German patient data. We used a societal 
perspective and applied a 3% annual discount rate.
RESULTS: Compared with no antiviral therapy, peginterferon plus fixed or weight 
based dosing of ribavirin increased life expectancy by 4.2 and 4.7 years, 
respectively. Compared with standard interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin, 
peginterferon plus fixed or weight based dosing of ribavirin increased life 
expectancy by 0.5 and by 1.0 years with incremental cost effectiveness ratios of 
11,800 euros and 6600 euros per quality adjusted life year (QALY), respectively. 
Subgroup analyses by genotype, viral load, sex, and histology showed that 
peginterferon plus weight based ribavirin remained cost effective compared with 
other well accepted medical treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin should reduce the incidence 
of liver complications, prolong life, improve quality of life, and be cost 
effective for the initial treatment of chronic hepatitis C.

OBJECTIVES: To assess health values (utilities) in adolescents with cystic 
fibrosis (CF) and to evaluate how health status and clinical factors affect 
their health values.
METHODS: Adolescents 12 to 18 years of age completed the Child Health 
Questionnaire (CHQ), Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2), and 3 health value 
measures: the visual analog scale (VAS), time tradeoff (TTO), and standard 
gamble (SG). Severity of illness was measured by percent of predicted forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) and frequency of pulmonary exacerbations.
RESULTS: The mean age (+/- SD) of the 65 adolescents was 15.1 (+/- 2.1) years; 
53.8% were male; their mean FEV(1) was 72.8% (+/- 27.0%) predicted. The mean TTO 
utility was 0.96 (+/- 0.07) and the mean SG utility was 0.92 (+/- 0.15). In 
multivariable analysis, the General Health Perceptions domain from the CHQ was 
the only health status scale significantly associated with the VAS, TTO, and SG. 
No clinical or demographic measures were significantly related to both TTO and 
SG scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Direct utility assessment in adolescents with CF is feasible. Their 
TTO and SG utilities are generally high, indicating that they are willing to 
trade very little of their life expectancy or take more than a small risk of 
death to obtain perfect health. Their self-rated health perceptions are related 
to their health values, but, as in adult populations, only moderately so, 
indicating that health values are highly individualistic. Therefore, health 
values should be ascertained directly from adolescents.

Comment in
    Endoscopy. 2005 Apr;37(4):400; author reply 401.

BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Self-expandable metallic covered stents (SEMS) are 
widely used for the palliation of esophageal cancer. In the long term, a 
drawback of these stents is the occurrence of nontumoral occlusion at their 
proximal or distal parts. New self-expanding plastic stents (SEPS) may combine 
the advantages of SEMS with those of previously used plastic stents. Our aim was 
to study prospectively the implantation of such stents in a series of patients 
with fairly long life expectancy, focusing on safety, feasibility and long-term 
effectiveness.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1999 and December 2000, in a prospective 
cohort study, 33 patients were treated with Polyflex stents for palliation of 
esophageal stenoses, and were followed up until death. The inclusion criteria 
demanded the presence of a nonresectable or nonoperable, histologically proven, 
malignant stricture of the esophagus causing significant dysphagia.
RESULTS: Stent insertion was successful in all cases. The mean duration of 
follow-up of the patients was 149.7 days (range 25 - 469). A complete follow-up 
until death was documented for all patients (n = 33). During the entire 
follow-up, no stent occlusion was observed which was caused by either nontumoral 
or tumoral ingrowth, or by nontumoral overgrowth. Stent occlusions were caused 
only by tumoral overgrowth, and occurred at a rate of 12.1 % (n = 4). The stent 
migration rate was 6.0 % (n = 2), and the re-intervention rate overall was 21.1 
% (n = 7).
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that SEPS are effective for the palliation of 
dysphagia in patients with esophageal malignancies. The immediate results are 
similar to those observed with SEMS, and the observed low rate of late 
obstruction suggests that their long-term efficacy might be superior to that of 
SEMS. This device warrants evaluation in a controlled prospective trial.

INTRODUCTION: High-energy traumas are open or closed injuries caused by force 
(missile, traffic injuries, crush or blust injuries, falling from heights), 
affecting the body surface and transferring high amount of kinetic energy 
inducing great damage to the tissue. Management of such lower extremity injuries 
has evolved over past several decades, but still remains a difficult task for 
every surgical team. Specific anatomic and functional characteristics combined 
with extensive injuries demands specific treatment protocols.
MULTIPLE INJURIES: In a multiple injured patient the first priority is 
management of life-threatening trauma. Despite other injuries, surgical 
treatment of limb-threatening injuries must start as soon as life-threatening 
condition has been managed.
TREATMENT ALGORITHMS: Algorithms are especially beneficial in management of 
severely injured, but salvageable extremities and in making decision on 
amputation. Insight into mechanisms of injury, as well as systematic examination 
of the affected limb, should help us understand the extensiveness of trauma and 
make an adequate management plan.
PREVENTION OF INFECTION AND SURGICAL APPROACH: Prevention of wound infection and 
surgical approach to high-energy limb trauma, which includes wound extension, 
wound excision, skeletal stabilization and if necessary muscle compartment 
release, should be done in the first 6 hours after injury.
METHODS OF SOFT TISSUE RECONSTRUCTION: Commonly used methods for soft tissue 
defects must provide wound coverage in less than five days following injury.
REHABILITATION: Early passive and active mobilization and verticalization of 
patients is very important for successful treatment.
CONCLUSION: Good and timely evaluation of the injured and collaboration between 
plastic and orthopaedic surgeons from the beginning of treatment, are crucial 
for final outcome.

Medical counselling in the clinical management of BRCA mutation.

Eisinger F(1).

Marseilles, France. eisinger@marseille.inserm.fr

Among medical activities, the choice of an intervention is less and less the 
primacy of experts over persons, whom under the current dominant model of 
autonomy are the ones in charge of the decision. However, counselling is 
ethically relevant and acceptable provided that three conditions are fulfilled: 
1. Besides information, patient asks for advice; 2. Advice is not given in an 
authoritative way, with strong incitement or directiveness; 3. It should be 
explicitly expressed that, if the patient doesn't follow the physician's advice, 
this will by no means prevent treatment nor the continuation of their 
relationship. Within an utilitarian perspective, a decision is something like a 
balance of facts and values. Therefore, the main (insurmountable?) difficulty 
lays in the assessment of patient's values. Counselling is all the more 
difficult and should be cautiously delivered as the situation at stake is 
assumed to exhibit a huge range of inter-individual values. Physicians should 
have deep respect for genuine individual values and/or cultural factors. The aim 
of clinical management is to increase life expectancy, taking into account 
quality of life and dignity of the person. Deliberative, iterative process seems 
to be a good way to reach a fair decision. While counselling the patient, the 
physician has to know for whom (or what) (s)he is acting. Indeed it is not 
always easy to distinguish among the interest of the patient, of its relatives, 
of the community of patients or even the interest of science or... 
self-interest.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the results of radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer 
and identify the clinical and therapeutic variables that might influence 
prognosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a population base of 109 patients, 87 met the 
enrollment criteria. The patients received thoracic radiotherapy over the 
macroscopic tumor volume and lymph drainage areas, using conventional fractions. 
Systemic cytostatic therapy was also given to 61% of the patients.
RESULTS: Staging was as follows: 33% (28/87) I and II, 20% (18/87) IIIA and 47% 
(41/87) IIIB. The mean radiotherapy dose was 66.7 Gy (95% CI, 65-67). Full 
clinical remission was achieved by 22% (18/87), half of whom later suffered 
recurrences. Partial remission was achieved by 26% (21/87). No response was 
observed in 52% (42/87). Statistically significant differences in actuarial 
survival rates were found for staging and tumor response. Mean survival for 
stages I and II was 29 months (95% CI, 19-39), for IIIA it was 22 (95% CI, 
16-28) months, and for IIIB 16 months (95% CI, 12-20). The most common 
complications were cutaneous, esophageal and pulmonary, with a low incidence of 
grade 3 toxicity (less than 3%) and absence of grade 4.
CONCLUSIONS: No differences in survival were observed for age, tumor location or 
histological type. Local control of the disease decisively influenced patient 
survival.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a technique for video-assisted lobectomy through the 
auscultatory triangle (VALAT) and to assess early and medium-term outcome of the 
procedure in patients with non-small cell bronchopulmonary carcinoma in stage I.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between April 1999 and May 2002 we performed 25 VALAT 
procedures (24 lobectomies and 1 bilobectomy) in 25 patients with a mean age of 
63.6 years (range 39-80).
RESULTS: No deaths occurred during or after surgery. Conversion to conventional 
thoracotomy was necessary in two cases. One patient was re-operated to resolve 
hemothorax and one developed a bronchopleural fistula that was treated by 
pleural drainage. The mean hospital stay was 6.3 days. Twenty-three patients 
have been disease-free throughout a mean follow-up period of 11.5 months (range 
1-36). The two-year actuarial survival rate (Kaplan-Meier) was 93% 7%.
CONCLUSIONS: VALAT is a safe procedure that nevertheless requires specific 
training. The rate of complications was low in our patient series and mortality 
was nil. The outcome for patients with stage I bronchogenic carcinoma over a 
two-year follow-up period has been comparable to results obtained with 
conventional thoracotomy.

Is height related to longevity?

Over the last 100 years, studies have provided mixed results on the mortality 
and health of tall and short people. However, during the last 30 years, several 
researchers have found a negative correlation between greater height and 
longevity based on relatively homogeneous deceased population samples. Findings 
based on millions of deaths suggest that shorter, smaller bodies have lower 
death rates and fewer diet-related chronic diseases, especially past middle age. 
Shorter people also appear to have longer average lifespans. The authors suggest 
that the differences in longevity between the sexes is due to their height
