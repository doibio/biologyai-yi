BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has gradually been 
recognized as favorable curative treatment for localized prostate cancer (PC). 
However, the high rate of erectile dysfunction (ED) after traditional 
photon-based SBRT remains an ongoing challenge that greatly impacts the quality 
of life of PC survivors. Modern proton therapy allows higher conformal SBRT 
delivery and has the potential to reduce ED occurrence but its 
cost-effectiveness remains uninvestigated.
METHODS: A Markov decision model was designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of proton SBRT versus photon SBRT in reducing irradiation-related ED. Base-case 
evaluation was performed on a 66-year-old (median age of PC) localized PC 
patient with normal pretreatment erectile function. Further, stratified analyses 
were performed for different age groups (50, 55, 60, 65, 70, and 75 years) and 
threshold analyses were conducted to estimate cost-effective scenarios. A 
Chinese societal willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold (37,653 US dollars 
[$])/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) was adopted.
RESULTS: For the base case, protons provided an additional 0.152 QALY at an 
additional cost of $7233.4, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
$47,456.5/QALY. Protons was cost-effective for patients ≤62-year-old at the WTP 
of China (≤66-year-old at a WTP of $50,000/QALY; ≤73-year-old at a WTP of 
$100,000/QALY). For patients at median age, once the current proton cost 
($18,000) was reduced to ≤$16,505.7 or the patient had a life expectancy ≥88 
years, protons were cost-effective at the WTP of China.
CONCLUSIONS: Upon assumption-based modeling, the results of current study 
support the use of proton SBRT in younger localized PC patients who are 
previously potent, for better preservation of erectile function. The findings 
await further validation using data from future comparative clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: To generate a scoping review that summarizes thematically on all 
reported patient perceptions on readiness and experiences during transitional 
urologic care for patients with neurogenic bladder and or congenital 
genitourinary conditions that require continuity of care into adulthood.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in October 2021. Records 
were screened and identified for studies relevant to reported readiness and 
experience in urologic transitional care among patients needing life-long 
urologic care. The methodological quality of the cross-sectional studies was 
assessed using AXIS. The included studies were clustered according to patient 
readiness in transition and patient experience-satisfaction in the urologic 
transition process. This scoping review was part of a systematic review 
registered on PROSPERO CRD42022306229 and was conducted in compliance with the 
PRISMA extension for scoping reviews.
RESULTS: A total of 12 articles were included that assessed patients with 
neurogenic bladder that reported either readiness or patient experience 
following the transitional care process. The patient readiness was assessed in 
six studies, determined using the TRAQ score with a range of 3-4/5. Older age, 
high health literacy, and parental or families' transition process awareness 
were associated with readiness. Generally, patients experience better 
satisfaction with pediatric care than with adult care facilities. Most patients 
felt that sexuality and fertility were not adequately tackled during the 
transition. The reported barriers to successful transition were patient, 
provider, and system factors, including lack of insurance coverage/financial 
management, patient preference, long-term bond with the pediatric providers, and 
communication by the adult provider. Based on AXIS, all of the studies 
identified for this scoping review did not determine the sample size, and most 
of the studies did not categorize the responders, which could introduce bias to 
the interpretation of their results.
CONCLUSION: This scoping review summarizes the readiness and experience of 
neurogenic bladder patients who underwent the urologic transitional process. 
Overall, understanding the patient, provider, and system factors associated with 
better readiness and enhancing the patient experience will ensure a better 
transition process.

BACKGROUND: Due to an increase in life expectancy, the prevalence of chronic 
diseases is also on the rise. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide 
recommendations for suitable interventions regarding different chronic diseases, 
but a deficiency in the implementation of these CPGs has been identified. The 
PITeS-TiiSS (Telemedicine and eHealth Innovation Platform: Information 
Communications Technology for Research and Information Challenges in Health 
Services) tool, a personalized ontology-based clinical decision support system 
(CDSS), aims to reduce variability, prevent errors, and consider interactions 
between different CPG recommendations, among other benefits.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to design, develop, and validate an 
ontology-based CDSS that provides personalized recommendations related to drug 
prescription. The target population is older adult patients with chronic 
diseases and polypharmacy, and the goal is to reduce complications related to 
these types of conditions while offering integrated care.
METHODS: A study scenario about atrial fibrillation and treatment with 
anticoagulants was selected to validate the tool. After this, a series of 
knowledge sources were identified, including CPGs, PROFUND index, LESS/CHRON 
criteria, and STOPP/START criteria, to extract the information. Modeling was 
carried out using an ontology, and mapping was done with Health Level 7 Fast 
Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) and Systematized Nomenclature 
of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT; International Health Terminology 
Standards Development Organisation). Once the CDSS was developed, validation was 
carried out by using a retrospective case study.
RESULTS: This project was funded in January 2015 and approved by the Virgen del 
Rocio University Hospital ethics committee on November 24, 2015. Two different 
tasks were carried out to test the functioning of the tool. First, retrospective 
data from a real patient who met the inclusion criteria were used. Second, the 
analysis of an adoption model was performed through the study of the 
requirements and characteristics that a CDSS must meet in order to be well 
accepted and used by health professionals. The results are favorable and allow 
the proposed research to continue to the next phase.
CONCLUSIONS: An ontology-based CDSS was successfully designed, developed, and 
validated. However, in future work, validation in a real environment should be 
performed to ensure the tool is usable and reliable.

Reducing the basic reproduction number of COVID-19: a model simulation focused 
on QALYs, hospitalisation, productivity costs and optimal (soft) lockdown.

Even if public health interventions are successful at reducing the spread of 
COVID-19, there is no guarantee that they will bring net benefits to the society 
because of the dynamic nature of the pandemic, e.g., the risk of a second 
outbreak if those interventions are stopped too early, and the costs of a 
continued lockdown. In this analysis, a discrete-time dynamic model is used to 
simulate the effect of reducing the effective reproduction number, driven by 
lockdowns ordered in March 2020 in four European countries (UK, France, Italy 
and Spain), on QALYs and hospitalisation costs. These benefits are valued in 
monetary terms (€30,000 per QALY assumed) and compared to productivity costs due 
to reduced economic activity during the lockdown. An analysis of the optimal 
duration of lockdown is performed where a net benefit is maximised. The switch 
to a soft lockdown is analysed and compared to a continued lockdown or no 
intervention. Results vary for two assumptions about hospital capacity of the 
health system: (a) under unlimited capacity, average benefit ranges from 8.21 to 
14.21% of annual GDP, for UK and Spain, respectively; (b) under limited 
capacity, average benefits are higher than 30.32% of annual GDP in all 
countries. The simulation results imply that the benefits of lockdown are not 
substantial unless continued until vaccination of high-risk groups is complete. 
It is illustrated that lockdown may not bring net benefits under some scenarios 
and a soft lockdown will be a more efficient alternative from mid-June 2020 only 
if the basic reproduction number is maintained low (not necessarily below 1) and 
productivity costs are sufficiently reduced.

INTRODUCTION: Risankizumab has demonstrated efficacy and safety in phase 3 
studies in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This randomized 
clinical trial assessed the efficacy and safety of risankizumab in patients with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in the Russian Federation.
METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were randomized 4:1 
to 16 weeks of double-blind treatment with risankizumab 150 mg or placebo 
(period A; dosing at baseline and week 4) followed by an open-label extension 
(period B) during which all patients received risankizumab 150 mg at weeks 16, 
28, and 40 and were followed up to week 52. The primary study endpoint was the 
proportion of patients achieving ≥ 90% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and 
Severity Index (PASI 90) at week 16, and secondary endpoints included Static 
Physician's Global Assessment scores and the Dermatology Life Quality Index. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events were monitored throughout the two study 
periods.
RESULTS: Of the 50 patients who entered period A, 41 were randomized to receive 
risankizumab and 9 to receive placebo. Forty-eight patients entered period B, 
and 47 completed the study. A significantly larger proportion of 
risankizumab-treated patients achieved PASI 90 at week 16 compared with 
placebo-treated patients [response rate difference: 38.8% (95% CI 7.8-69.7%; 
P = 0.035)]. Consistently higher proportions of risankizumab-treated patients 
achieved secondary endpoints compared with the placebo-treated patients. Safety 
profiles were similar between the treatment groups, and no patients discontinued 
the study drug owing to adverse events.
CONCLUSION: Risankizumab was efficacious and well tolerated in patients with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in the Russian Federation.

BACKGROUND: Identifying late-life men who might benefit from treatment to 
prevent fracture is challenging given high mortality. Our objective was to 
evaluate risks of clinical fracture, hip fracture, and mortality prior to 
fracture among men aged at least 80 years.
METHODS: Study participants included 3 145 community-dwelling men (mean 
[standard deviation] age 83 [2.8] years) from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men 
(MrOS) Study. We used separate multivariable Fine-Gray competing risk models 
with prespecified risk factors (age, hip bone mineral density [BMD], recent 
fracture [<5 years], fall history [previous year], and multimorbidity [# 
conditions]) to estimate subdistribution hazard ratios and absolute 5-year risks 
of any clinical fracture and mortality prior to clinical fracture. Secondary 
analysis considered a hip fracture.
RESULTS: There were 414 incident clinical fractures and 595 deaths without prior 
fracture within 5 years. BMD, fall history, and recent fracture were strong 
predictors of clinical fracture. Age and multimorbidity were strong predictors 
of mortality before fracture. After accounting for competing risks, age, BMD, 
and fall history were each associated with both risks of hip fracture and 
mortality before hip fracture. Model discrimination varied from 0.65 (mortality 
before fracture) to 0.79 (hip fracture). Estimated mortality differed 
substantially among men with similar clinical fracture risk due to a modest 
correlation between fracture risk and competing mortality risk = 0.37.
CONCLUSION: In late-life men, strong risk factors for clinical fracture and hip 
fracture include fall history, BMD, and recent fracture. Osteoporosis drug 
treatment decisions may be further enhanced by consideration of fracture risk 
versus overall life expectancy.

The aim of this study was to establish whether the universal pneumococcal 
vaccination for older adults in Norway is likely to be cost-effective from the 
perspective of the health care provider. A decision tree model developed by the 
Public Health Agency of Sweden was adapted to the Norwegian setting. Two 
cohorts, consisting of 65-year-olds and 75-year-olds grouped into vaccinated and 
unvaccinated, were followed over a 5-year time horizon. In the base case, the 
23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) was used while the 13-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was included in scenario analyses only. 
The costs and health benefits (measured in quality adjusted life years (QALY) 
gained) were compared in the two cohorts between the vaccinated and unvaccinated 
groups. The impact of indirect effects of the vaccine, such as herd immunity and 
serotype replacement, were not investigated. The relative importance of change 
in price was assessed by performing one-way sensitivity analyses. Under 
base-case assumptions, the programme for the 75-year-old cohort is expected to 
be dominant (cost-effective) from the health care perspective at the current 
maximal pharmacy retail price and at 75% vaccination coverage. In comparison, 
for the 65-year-old cohort the cost per QALY gained is approximately NOK 601,784 
(EUR 61,281) under the base-case assumptions. A reduction in the cost of the 
vaccine to one quarter of its current level also brings the cost per QALY gained 
within the acceptable ranges in a Norwegian context for both the 65- and 
75-year-old cohorts. There is no exact cost-effectiveness threshold in Norway. 
However, introducing a vaccination programme against pneumococcal disease for 
65-year-olds in Norway is likely to fall within the acceptable range while for 
the 75-year-old cohort the universal programme appears to be dominant 
(cost-effective).

OBJECTIVE: To measure sex differences in lifespan based on the probability of 
males to outlive females.
DESIGN: International comparison of national and regional sex-specific life 
tables from the Human Mortality Database and the World Population Prospects.
SETTING: 199 populations spanning all continents, between 1751 and 2020.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: We used the outsurvival statistic ( φ ) to measure 
inequality in lifespan between sexes, which is interpreted here as the 
probability of males to outlive females.
RESULTS: In random pairs of one male and one female at age 0, the probability of 
the male outliving the female varies between 25% and 50% for life tables in 
almost all years since 1751 and across almost all populations. We show that φ is 
negatively correlated with sex differences in life expectancy and positively 
correlated with the level of lifespan variation. The important reduction of 
lifespan inequality observed in recent years has made it less likely for a male 
to outlive a female.
CONCLUSIONS: Although male life expectancy is generally lower than female life 
expectancy, and male death rates are usually higher at all ages, males have a 
substantial chance of outliving females. These findings challenge the general 
impression that 'men do not live as long as women' and reveal a more nuanced 
inequality in lifespans between females and males.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the 
progressive deterioration of cognitive functions. Due to the extended global 
life expectancy, the prevalence of AD is increasing among aging populations 
worldwide. While AD is a multifactorial disease, synaptic dysfunction is one of 
the major neuropathological changes that occur early in AD, before clinical 
symptoms appear, and is associated with the progression of cognitive 
deterioration. However, the underlying pathological mechanisms leading to this 
synaptic dysfunction remains unclear. Recent large-scale genomic analyses have 
identified more than 40 genetic risk factors that are associated with AD. In 
this review, we discuss the functional roles of these genes in synaptogenesis 
and synaptic functions under physiological conditions, and how their functions 
are dysregulated in AD. This will provide insights into the contributions of 
these encoded proteins to synaptic dysfunction during AD pathogenesis.

An updated exploration of the burden of thyroid cancer across a country is 
always required for making correct decisions. The objective of this study is to 
present the thyroid cancer burden and attributed burden to the high Body Mass 
Index (BMI) in Iran at national and sub-national levels from 1990 to 2019. The 
data was obtained from the GBD 2019 study estimates. To explain the pattern of 
changes in incidence from 1990 to 2019, decomposition analysis was conducted. 
Besides, the attribution of high BMI in the thyroid cancer DALYs and deaths were 
obtained. The age-standardized incidence rate of thyroid cancer was 1.57 (95% 
UI: 1.33-1.86) in 1990 and increased 131% (53-191) until 2019. The 
age-standardized prevalence rate of thyroid cancer was 30.19 (18.75-34.55) in 
2019 which increased 164% (77-246) from 11.44 (9.38-13.85) in 1990. In 2019, the 
death rate, and Disability-adjusted life years of thyroid cancer was 0.49 
(0.36-0.53), and 13.16 (8.93-14.62), respectively. These numbers also increased 
since 1990. The DALYs and deaths attributable to high BMI was 1.91 (0.95-3.11) 
and 0.07 (0.04-0.11), respectively. The thyroid cancer burden and high BMI 
attributed burden has increased from 1990 to 2019 in Iran. This study and 
similar studies' results can be used for accurate resource allocation for 
efficient management and all potential risks' modification for thyroid cancer 
with a cost-conscious view.

The Impact of the Highly Virulent SARS-CoV-2 Gamma Variant on Young Adults in 
the State of São Paulo: Was It Inevitable?

Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had and is still 
having a tremendous impact on people all over the world, but it has been 
particularly harsh in South America. Nine out of 13 South American countries are 
among the 50 countries with the highest COVID-19 death rates. The gamma severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant that emerged by 
the end of 2020 in the Brazilian Amazon quickly spread throughout the country 
causing the harsh COVID-19 second wave. This variant displayed high viral loads, 
high transmissibility, and increased virulence as compared to previous variants. 
Aims The aim of this retrospective study is to revisit and analyse the 
epidemiology of the COVID-19 second wave in the state of São 
Paulo, the most populous Brazilian state. In addition to examining the possible 
factors that led to the emergence and propagation of the gamma variant, measures 
that could have prevented its spread and that of other highly virulent variants 
were also investigated. Materials and methods Data from São Paulo's official 
sources on morbidity, mortality, age distribution, and testing prior to and 
during the COVID-19 second wave (February - June 2021) and data regarding the 
distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the country were parsed, analyzed, and 
compared to the period that anteceded the eruption of the second COVID-19 wave. 
Results In the state of São Paulo, the toll of the COVID-19 second wave 
surpassed that of the first 11 months of the pandemic (from March 2020 to 
January 2021), as 56% of the deaths occurred in the five months of the second 
wave between February and June 2021. The mean age of COVID-19 victims, which was 
already below life expectancy in the state dropped even further in the 
pandemic's second wave, reaching an average of 60 years of age. The years of 
life lost per death per month doubled and the case-fatality rate (CFR) of 
young adults (20-39 years old) more than trebled during this period. A number of 
hypotheses have been raised that might explain the emergence and spread of the 
gamma variant and the measures that could have been taken to prevent it and 
minimise its impact on the population. Conclusions Over 142,000 people died as a 
result of the SARS-CoV-2 gamma variant sweep in São Paulo in the first semester 
of 2021. Due to its high viral load, the gamma variant displayed high 
transmissibility and a high degree of virulence resulting in increased case 
fatality rates across most age tiers. Notably, this second wave was marked by a 
very significant increase in deaths among young adults. This increase was at 
least partially due to a deterioration in general health provoked 
by non-pharmaceutical interventions. In hindsight, a safer and more effective 
measure might have been to allow the free spread of the virus among the young 
and healthy in the first wave, thus conferring immunity against more 
virulent variants that emerged later on.

BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, older 
adults experienced high mortality rates, and their deaths were often preceded by 
sudden health deterioration and acute respiratory failure. This prompted older 
adults and their families to make rapid goals-of-care decisions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at determining the prevalence of and factors 
associated with COVID-19-related do-not-attempt resuscitation (DNR) decisions 
among older adults.
DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional population-based survey.
SETTING: Well-looking active (mobile) community-dwelling adults aged ≥60 years 
and residing in the Bangkok district, Thailand, between April and May 2020, were 
included in this study. We excluded older adults who (1) were unable to speak 
Thai, (2) had severe cognitive impairment, or (3) were blind or deaf. We 
interviewed participants about their perceptions regarding end-of-life decisions 
in case they got infected with COVID-19 and experienced respiratory arrest.
RESULTS: We recruited 848 participants with a mean age of 70.5 (±6.74) years. 
When asked about their choice, 49.8% chose a DNR status, 44.5% chose full life 
support, and 5.8% were undecided. The three most common reasons provided by the 
DNR group for their choice were old age (54.9%), acceptance of death (15.6%), 
and fear of pain (8.5%).
CONCLUSION: Almost half of the older Thai adults chose a DNR status for 
scenarios in which they were infected with COVID-19 and suffered from cardiac 
arrest during the pandemic period. Future studies should include an in-depth 
examination of participants' lifestyles, family life expectancy, and religious 
faith to understand their end-of-life decisions.

BACKGROUND: Platelets for transfusion have a storage time of 5-7 days at 
22°C-24°C, which results in a strain on the supply chain and supply shortages. 
We describe a novel method to extend platelet storage using xenon (Xe) gas under 
high pressure and refrigeration.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Apheresis platelets (APU) prepared in 65% platelet 
additive solution (PAS) were stored under standard conditions (SC) at 20°C-24°C 
to Day 5. Paired APUs were prepared with Xe and stored to Day 14 at 2°C-6°C 
under hyperbaric conditions (XHC). A standard panel of in vitro assays was 
conducted.
RESULTS: XHC platelets were viable out to Day 14. The average pH of Day 14 
platelets was 6.58, and 86% maintained some degree of swirl compared with 7.02 
and 100% swirl for Day 5 SC platelets. The rate of glycolysis was reduced under 
XHC storage with less glucose consumption and lactate generation. Activation 
levels for Day 14 platelets, while increased, did not prevent response to 
agonists in vitro, including epinephrine + Adenosine 5-Diphosphate (EPI/ADP) and 
thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) aggregation. Thromboelastogram (TEG) 
assessment showed 80% or greater conservation of platelet function for Day 14 
xenon stored platelets compared with Day 5 SC platelets.
DISCUSSION: Platelet storage with the Xe/hyperbaric/cold method is a feasible 
candidate for extension of storage to 14 days based on in vitro characteristics. 
In vivo recovery and survival studies are indicated. The capability to extend 
platelet storage to 14 days would make large strides toward resolving issues of 
platelet outdating for prophylactic use.

Brain tumours are the biggest cancer killer in those under 40 and reduce life 
expectancy more than any other cancer. Blood-based liquid biopsies may aid early 
diagnosis, prediction and prognosis for brain tumours. It remains unclear 
whether known blood-based biomarkers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP), have the required sensitivity and selectivity. We have developed a novel 
in silico model which can be used to assess and compare blood-based liquid 
biopsies. We focused on GFAP, a putative biomarker for astrocytic tumours and 
glioblastoma multi-formes (GBMs). In silico modelling was paired with 
experimental measurement of cell GFAP concentrations and used to predict the 
tumour volumes and identify key parameters which limit detection. The average 
GBM volumes of 449 patients at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust were also 
measured and used as a benchmark. Our model predicts that the currently proposed 
GFAP threshold of 0.12 ng ml-1 may not be suitable for early detection of GBMs, 
but that lower thresholds may be used. We found that the levels of GFAP in the 
blood are related to tumour characteristics, such as vasculature damage and rate 
of necrosis, which are biological markers of tumour aggressiveness. We also 
demonstrate how these models could be used to provide clinical insight.

Apurinic/apyrimidic (AP) sites are severe DNA damages and strongly block DNA 
extension by major DNA polymerases. Y-family DNA polymerases possess a strong 
ability to bypass AP sites and continue the DNA synthesis reaction, which is 
called translesion synthesis (TLS) activity. To investigate the effect of the 
molecular structure of the AP site on the TLS efficiency of Dbh, a Y-family DNA 
polymerase from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, a series of different AP site 
analogues (various spacers) are used to characterize the bypass efficiency. We 
find that not only the molecular structure and atomic composition but also the 
number and position of AP site analogues determine the TLS efficiency of Dbh. 
Increasing the spacer length decreases TLS activity. The TLS efficiency also 
decreases when more than one spacer exists on the DNA template. The position of 
the AP site analogues is also an important factor for TLS. When the spacer is 
opposite to the first incorporated dNTPs, the TLS efficiency is the lowest, 
suggesting that AP sites are largely harmful for the formation of hydrogen 
bonds. These results deepen our understanding of the TLS activity of Y-family 
DNA polymerases and provide a biochemical basis for elucidating the TLS 
mechanism in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius cells.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate postoperative outcomes in patients with chest wall 
metastases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed 40 patients who underwent surgery for chest 
wall metastatic lesions. Fourteen (35%) patients had sternal lesion, 26 (65%) 
ones - rib metastases. We used implants for chest wall defect closure in 15 
(37.5%) patients. Chest wall repair with autologous tissues was performed in 19 
(47.5%) patients.
RESULTS: Median survival was 17 months. Most patients (n=30, 75%) showed 
improvement in the quality of life according to Karnofsky and EGOG scale after 
surgery. Continued tumor growth occurred in 4 (10%) patients within 8-16 months 
after surgery. There were 2 patients who suffered from tumor recurrence 
accompanied by other metastatic foci (progression). Complications were diagnosed 
in 5 (12.5%) patients. Tactical errors were identified in 4 (10%) patients and 
they were associated with progression of cancer in the form of new metastatic 
foci within 6 months after surgery.
CONCLUSION: Active surgical approach for bone metastases in patients with 
favorable cancer-related prognosis can improve quality of life and survival at 
least in case of solitary lesions. New program for treatment strategy selection 
based on prognosis of life expectancy and algorithms of surgical treatment will 
reduce the risk of erroneous management and increase its effectiveness.

Publisher: Метастатическое поражение костей — одна из важных проблем современной 
онкологии. У большинства пациентов с метастатическим поражением скелета 
хирургические вмешательства направлены на паллиативное лечение, однако в 
отдельных случаях, при солитарном метастатическом поражении, могут быть 
рассмотрены радикальные резекции с реконструктивно-пластическим компонентом, а 
прогноз предполагаемой продолжительности жизни, связанный с гистологической 
структурой злокачественной опухоли, является основным и решающим фактором при 
определении подходящего типа хирургического лечения.
ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Оценка результатов хирургического лечения пациентов с 
метастазами злокачественных опухолей в грудную стенку.
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: Представлен анализ лечения 40 пациентов, которым выполнено 
хирургическое лечение по поводу метастатического поражения грудной стенки. У 14 
(35%) имелось опухолевое поражение элементов грудины, а у 26 (65%) больных — 
различных отделов ребер. Импланты для замещения дефектов грудной стенки 
использовали у 15 (37,5%) больных, пластика перемещенными лоскутами — у 19 
(47,5%) пациентов.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Медиана выживаемости составила 17 мес. Улучшение качества жизни по 
шкале Karnofsky и EGOG после операции было отмечено у большинства — 30 (75%) 
больных. Продолженный рост опухоли выявлен у 4 (10%) больных в сроки от 8 до 16 
месяцев после операции. У 2 рецидив опухоли сопровождался появлением других 
метастатических очагов (прогрессированием). Осложнения диагностированы у 5 
(12,5%) больных. Тактические ошибки были выявлены у 4 (10%) пациентов и связаны 
они с прогрессированием онкологического заболевания в виде появления новых 
метастатических очагов в течение 6 мес. после операции.
ВЫВОДЫ: Активная хирургическая тактика при метастатическом поражении различных 
отделов скелета и благоприятном онкологическом прогнозе позволяет улучшить 
качество жизни больного и при солитарном поражении продлить его жизнь. 
Разработка новой программы выработки тактики лечения основанной на прогнозе 
продолжительности жизни пациента и алгоритмах хирургического лечения позволит 
сократить вероятность ошибки в выборе метода онкоортопедического пособия и 
увеличить эффективность лечения.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of patients with a continuous flow left 
ventricular assist device (cf-LVAD) is increasing. Adequate determination and 
regulation of mean arterial pressure (MAP) is important to prevent adverse 
events. Given the low pulsatility characteristics in these patients, standard 
blood pressure equipment is inadequate to monitor MAP and not recommended. We 
provide an overview of currently available noninvasive techniques, using an 
extensive search strategy in three online databases (Pubmed, Scopus and Google 
Scholar) to find validation studies using invasive intra-arterial blood pressure 
measurement as a reference. Mean differences with the reference values smaller 
than 5 ± 8 mm Hg were considered acceptable.
OBSERVATIONS: After deduplication, screening, and exclusion of incorrect 
sources, eleven studies remained with 3139 successful MAP measurements in 386 
patients. Four noninvasive techniques, using Doppler, pulse oximetry, finger 
cuff volume clamp, or slow upper arm cuff deflation, were identified and 
evaluated for validity and success rate in cf-LVAD patients. Here, a 
comprehensive technical background of the blood pressure measurement methods is 
provided in combination with a clinical use comparison. Of the reported 
noninvasive techniques, slow cuff devices performed most optimally (mean 
difference 1.3 ± 5.2 mm Hg).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results are encouraging and indicate that noninvasive blood 
pressure monitoring options with acceptable validity and success rate are 
available. Further technical development and validation is warranted for the 
growing population of patients on long-term cf-LVAD support.

OBJECTIVE: Uncontrolled asthma significantly impairs health-related quality of 
life and work productivity. Some add-on therapies, such as vitamin D 
supplements, safely reduce the rate of asthma exacerbation. The purpose of this 
study was to assess the cost-utility of vitamin D supplementation in adults with 
mild to moderate persistent asthma in Colombia.
METHODS: A Markov model was created to estimate the cost and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) of patients with severe asthma in Colombia. Total costs and 
QALYs of two therapy strategies, vitamin D supplementation plus ICS versus ICS 
alone, were calculated over a one-year time horizon. Deterministic and 
probability sensitivity analyses were conducted, and cost-effectiveness was 
evaluated at a willingness-to-pay value of $5,180 per QALY gained.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that compared with no supplementation, 
vitamin D supplementation was associated with higher costs and higher QALYs. The 
expected annual cost per patient with vitamin D supplementation was US$1338 and 
without this supplementation it was US$1095. The QALYs per person estimated with 
vitamin D supplementation was 0.80, and without this supplementation it was 
0.63. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was US$1583 per 
QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Add-on vitamin D supplement was cost-effective when added to the 
usual care in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma. Our study 
provides evidence that should be used by decision-makers to improve clinical 
practice guidelines.

CONTEXT: Familial partial lipodystrophy type 2 (FPLD2) results from autosomal 
dominant mutations in the LMNA gene, causing lack of subcutaneous fat deposition 
and excess ectopic fat accumulation, leading to metabolic complications and 
reduced life expectancy. The rarity of the condition means that the natural 
history of FPLD2 throughout childhood is not well understood. We report outcomes 
in a cohort of 12 (5M) children with a genetic diagnosis of FPLD2, under the 
care of the UK National Severe Insulin Resistance Service (NSIRS) which offers 
multidisciplinary input including dietetic, in addition to screening for 
comorbidities.
