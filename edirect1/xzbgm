Meanings of religious and nonreligious spirituality are explored, with 
implications for death acceptance, death rejection, and life extension. In the 
first of two exploratory studies, 16 elders low on intrinsic religiosity were 
compared with 116 elders high in religiosity; they differed both in qualitative 
responses and on death attitudes. In the second, 48 elders were assessed on 
religious and nonreligious spirituality and compared on attitudes toward death 
rejection, life extension, and death acceptance. Conclusions were that a sizable 
minority of elders hold nonreligious spirituality beliefs, and these beliefs are 
related to greater acceptance of life extension and death rejection.

    Death Stud. 2005 Dec;29(10):959-63.

E. Abel andM. Kruger (2005) reported that the median life expectancy of Major 
League Baseball players after election to the Baseball Hall of Fame is 5 years 
shorter than that of players of the same age who are not elected to the Hall of 
Fame. This conclusion is surprising because there is no compelling explanation 
for such a dramatic reduction in life expectancy. However, the data used in that 
study are incorrect. A robust test applied to correct data shows that there is 
no statistically persuasive difference in the life expectancy of players elected 
to the Hall of Fame and their peers.

Romanian Government Decision (GD) No. 8/2012 amending and supplementing GD No. 
144/2010 regarding the function and organization structures of the Ministry of 
Health defines health technology assessment (HTA) as "a systematic and 
multidisciplinary analysis of the existing and new medical technologies, through 
which medical, economic, social, ethical and organizational information are 
synthesized so that medical technologies to be used in a transparent and 
unbiased manner". We propose an ethical assessment model of technologies used in 
the care of diabetic patients. The nature of this research was exploratory, 
giving the novelty of this approach to the clinical and social context of 
Romania.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The assessment of health technologies used in the care of 
diabetic patients was based on the following research question: What is the role 
of health technology in developing autonomy and responsibility in patients 
suffering from chronic diseases? Individual interviews and focus groups were 
held from June, 2011 to November, 2012 in Iasi. The criterion for selecting the 
participants was belonging to the target groups: family doctors or diabetes 
specialist, patients with type 1 (TID) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), caregivers and 
other professionals involved in diabetes patient care.
KEYWORDS: The diabetic patient benefits from a specific treatment and has the 
privilege of self-administering it, his life expectancy and quality of life 
depending upon the compliance and responsibility he demonstrates.

Health in College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University , Tainan, Taiwan .

OBJECTIVE: This research uses the quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) method 
to assess the QALE changes of rural residents before and after introducing 
telemedicine health services.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on Taiwan's experiences of telemedicine provision 
over the period 1995-2004, this representative of a national sample is composed 
of 85 cases for people living in Penghu County, a remote area in Taiwan. Cases 
were evaluated using persons with life expectancy at birth from 85 to 0 years.
RESULTS: The provision of telemedicine health services increased rural 
population QALE by 2.91 quality-adjusted life years. Telemedicine provision does 
improve rural residents' health status. Relative to the index population living 
in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, the survival ratios of the population of 
concern >65 years decreased faster and were less than those of the index 
population >65 years by at least 7% and 3%, respectively, before and after 
introducing telemedicine health services.
CONCLUSIONS: It appears that the needs for telemedicine health services 
increased along with the aging of our society in rural and underserved regions.

Healthy longevity is a tangible possibility for many individuals and 
populations, with nutritional and other lifestyle factors playing a key role in 
modulating the likelihood of healthy ageing. Nevertheless, studies of effects of 
nutrients or single foods on ageing often show inconsistent results and ignore 
the overall framework of dietary habits. Therefore, the use of dietary patterns 
(e.g. a Mediterranean dietary pattern) and the specific dietary recommendations 
(e.g. dietary approaches to stop hypertension, Polymeal and the American Healthy 
Eating Index) are becoming more widespread in promoting lifelong health. A 
posteriori defined dietary patterns are described frequently in relation to 
age-related diseases but their generalisability is often a challenge since these 
are developed specifically for the population under study. Conversely, the 
dietary guidelines are often developed based on prevention of disease or 
nutrient deficiency, but often less attention is paid to how well these dietary 
guidelines promote health outcomes. In the present paper, we provide an overview 
of the state of the art of dietary patterns and dietary recommendations in 
relation to life expectancy and the risk of age-related disorders (with emphasis 
on cardiometabolic diseases and cognitive outcomes). According to both a 
posteriori and a priori dietary patterns, some key 'ingredients' can be 
identified that are associated consistently with longevity and better 
cardiometabolic and cognitive health. These include high intake of fruit, 
vegetables, fish, (whole) grains and legumes/pulses and potatoes, whereas 
dietary patterns rich in red meat and sugar-rich foods have been associated with 
an increased risk of mortality and cardiometabolic outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Registries are considered key instruments for developing rare 
disease (RD) clinical research, enhancing patient care and health planning, and 
improving social, economic and quality-of-life outcomes. Indeed, it is usually 
the case that no single institution, and in many cases no single country, has 
sufficient data to provide results that can be applied broadly to clinical and 
translational research. However, the fragmentation and heterogeneity of the 
registries, which are often the result of spontaneous initiatives, limit the 
general applicability of their observations.
METHODS: An inquiry has been carried out by the EPIRARE, a European Union 
(EU)-funded project ('Building Consensus and Synergies for the EU Registration 
of Rare Disease Patients') aiming at paving the way to the creation of a 
European Platform for RD Registries, by means of an on-line questionnaire among 
European RD registries on their main activities and needs, the way they deal 
with methodological, technical and regulatory issues and the way they find 
resources to carry on their activities.
RESULTS: In spite of the heterogeneity of the European registries, some elements 
of relevance for an action to improve the situation of patient registries in the 
EU are apparent. The needs more frequently indicated by registry holders were 
financial support, motivation of data providers, data quality assessment, 
improvement of communication and visibility, and extension of collaborations. 
Moreover, the registry holders were in favor of a common EU platform providing 
services for RD registries.
CONCLUSION: It appears that the current situation of the European registries 
provides the transition towards a more uniform, higher quality and better 
coordinated approach.

Fibromyalgia: disease synopsis, medication cost effectiveness and economic 
burden.

University, Riverpoint Campus, PO Box 1495, Spokane, WA, 99210-1495, USA,

Fibromyalgia (FM) primarily affects women, and it is increasingly recognized by 
health care providers as more patients seek assistance for their chronic pain 
conditions. FM patients suffer from reduced quality of life, daily functioning 
and productivity. A single FM patient can cost society tens of thousands of 
dollars each year, with the overall expense increasing alongside disease 
severity. Indirect costs account for the majority of total expenditures and 
involve losses in productivity, reduced work hours, absenteeism, disability, 
unemployment, early retirement, informal care and other out-of-pocket costs. 
Health care utilization increases in concert with the severity of illness. 
Moreover, FM patients often have several comorbid illnesses (e.g. depression, 
anxiety and sleep disturbances), resulting in extreme escalation of overall 
health care expenditures. Medications with the best efficacy in the treatment of 
FM include the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline and nortriptyline, 
cyclobenzaprine (a skeletal muscle relaxant), tramadol, duloxetine, milnacipran, 
pregabalin and gabapentin. Corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics, with the exception of tramadol, 
are not considered efficacious. Medication selection should be individualized 
and influenced by the severity of illness and the presence of comorbidities and 
functional disabilities.

INTRODUCTION: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor in children and 
young adults and appropriate chemotherapy can increase limb sparing and overall 
survival. Yet, the toxicity of chemotherapy regimens including MTX can be life 
threatening. Therefore; we tried another chemotherapy regimen for these 
patients.
METHOD AND MATERIALS: We investigated 15 patients aged 15 to 40 years old and 
used continuous infusion of cisplatin, doxorubicin intermittently with 
ifosfamide, doxorubicin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Percent of necrosis and 
toxicities was recorded for each patient.
RESULTS: Out of 15 patients investigated, 13 were males and 2 females. Tumor 
necrosis≥ 90% (defined as good necrosis) was observed in 60% of patients. 26.7% 
of the patients showed leucopenia grade three or four, 26.7% had anemia grade 
three or four, and 20% showed thrombocytopenia grade three or four.
CONCLUSION: The above chemotherapy regimen can cause as good necrosis as the 
chemotherapy regimens including high dose of MTX with reduced toxicity and less 
nursing cares and laboratory tests. Of course small sample size limits extension 
of our result to all patients but trying this regimen is recommended in more 
patients to see more reliable results.

As providers of health care, we face increasing demand on our limited, indeed 
diminishing, resources. Economic appraisal of our interventions means assessing 
the trade-off between effectiveness, efficiency and equity. When rationing 
becomes inevitable, calculation of utility values is a valuable decision-making 
tool. This paper reviews objective measures of patient benefit, such as quality 
of life, and focuses on their application within otolaryngology.

OBJECTIVE: To discuss the cost, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility of the 
extension methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) clinics and provide the 
evidences of the strategy of scaling up the extension MMT clinics.
METHODS: A study was conducted in Dehong prefecture, Yunnan province, including 
Mang, Ruili city, Longchuan, Yingjiang, Lianghe county. 117 newly enrolling 
heroin addict patients in 17 extension MMT clinics were recruited as subjects 
from December 2010 to February 2011. An interview was conducted by the trained 
interviewers for the quality of life score of patients, and the cost of drug use 
was calculated. Table of outpatient costs of methadone maintenance treatment 
clinic of Dehong prefecture in Yunnan was used for collecting and calculating 
the fixed cost, operating cost of the clinics, and the unit cost and incremental 
cost of the patients from 2008 to 2010. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of 
the extension clinics were analyzed by using the Markov model.
RESULTS: The total spending of extension clinics for 2008, 2009, and 2010 on 
average was ¥57 294, ¥80 752 and ¥74 739 respectively, or about ¥4379 annually 
per patient. The cost of averting one HIV infection was ¥316 509; the cost of 
averting one acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients was ¥508 676; 
and the cost of averting one death was ¥152 330. The cost of obtaining one life 
year (LY) was ¥3696 and the cost of obtaining one quality adjusted life year 
(QALY) was ¥9014. Comparing with drug users, the incremental cost utility ratio 
(ICUR) of the patients of the extension MMT clinics were -7074 yuan/QALY and 
-7162 yuan/LY.
CONCLUSION: The extension MMT clinic service is lower in cost, and better in 
cost-effectiveness and cost-utility.

Modeling the impact of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Chinese 
infants: an economic analysis of a compulsory vaccination.

China. wbwithtg@hotmail.com.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare, from a Chinese societal 
perspective, the projected health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of 
adding pneumococcal conjugate heptavalent vaccine (PCV-7) to the routine 
compulsory child immunization schedule.
METHODS: A decision-tree model, with data and assumptions adapted for relevance 
to China, was developed to project the health outcomes of PCV-7 vaccination 
(compared with no vaccination) over a 5-year period as well as a lifetime. The 
vaccinated birth cohort included 16,000,000 children in China. A 2 + 1 dose 
schedule at US$136.51 per vaccine dose was used in the base-case analysis. 
One-way sensitivity analysis was used to test the robustness of the model. The 
impact of a net indirect effect (herd immunity) was evaluated. Outcomes are 
presented in terms of the saved disease burden, costs, quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: In a Chinese birth cohort, a PCV-7 vaccination program would reduce the 
number of pneumococcus-related infections by at least 32% and would prevent 
2,682 deaths in the first 5 years of life, saving $1,190 million in total costs 
and gaining an additional 9,895 QALYs (discounted by 3%). The incremental cost 
per QALY was estimated to be $530,354. When herd immunity was taken into 
account, the cost per QALY was estimated to be $95,319. The robustness of the 
model was influenced mainly by the PCV-7 cost per dose, effectiveness herd 
immunity and incidence of pneumococcal diseases. With and without herd immunity, 
the break-even costs in China were $29.05 and $25.87, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Compulsory routine infant vaccination with PCV-7 is projected to 
substantially reduce pneumococcal disease morbidity, mortality, and related 
costs in China. However, a universal vaccination program with PCV-7 is not 
cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay threshold that is currently recommended 
for China by the World Health Organization.

A qualitative, exploratory study of predominantly female parental perceptions of 
consumer health technology use by their overweight and/or obese female 
adolescent participating in a fee-based 4-week weight-management intervention.

Knoblock-Hahn AL, LeRouge CM.

Consumer health technologies (CHTs) are a growing part of the continuum of care 
for self-management of overweight and obesity. Parents positively or negatively 
influence adolescent weight-management efforts and are especially important 
throughout continuum of care settings. User-centered design (UCD) applications 
have been developed to assist primary users, such as adolescents, with their 
weight management, but less is known about the influence of parents as secondary 
users across many socio-ecological environments. The purpose of this study was 
to use the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to inform 
the design of a UCD application in a qualitative study that sought to determine 
parental views on how technology can support previously learned behaviors that 
require ongoing management and support beyond formal lifestyle interventions. 
Parents of overweight and obese adolescents (n=14) were interviewed about 
perceived usefulness and planned user-intent of CHT that was designed for 
adolescents. UTAUT provided theoretical parental constructs (intention, 
performance and effort expectancy, and social influence) interactions within 
several socio-ecological contexts, including the home food environment and 
restaurant dining experiences. Although generalizations of this qualitative 
study are limited by a small sample size with predominantly mothers (n=13) of 
overweight and obese daughters (n=12), the exploratory inquiry using a parent as 
a secondary consumer user can complement the adoption of applications designed 
by adolescents.

BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common neuropathy of the 
upper limb and a significant contributor to hand functional impairment and 
disability. Effective treatment options include conservative and surgical 
interventions, however it is not possible at present to predict the outcome of 
treatment. The primary aim of this study is to identify which baseline clinical 
factors predict a good outcome from conservative treatment (by injection) or 
surgery in patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. Secondary aims are to 
describe the clinical course and progression of CTS, and to describe and predict 
the UK cost of CTS to the individual, National Health Service (NHS) and society 
over a two year period.
METHODS/DESIGN: In this prospective observational cohort study patients 
presenting with clinical signs and symptoms typical of CTS and in whom the 
diagnosis is confirmed by nerve conduction studies are invited to participate. 
Data on putative predictive factors are collected at baseline and follow-up 
through patient questionnaires and include standardised measures of symptom 
severity, hand function, psychological and physical health, comorbidity and 
quality of life. Resource use and cost over the 2 year period such as prescribed 
medications, NHS and private healthcare contacts are also collected through 
patient self-report at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The primary outcome used to 
classify treatment success or failures will be a 5-point global assessment of 
change. Secondary outcomes include changes in clinical symptoms, functioning, 
psychological health, quality of life and resource use. A multivariable model of 
factors which predict outcome and cost will be developed.
DISCUSSION: This prospective cohort study will provide important data on the 
clinical course and UK costs of CTS over a two-year period and begin to identify 
predictive factors for treatment success from conservative and surgical 
interventions.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is a prevalent health problem in older people 
and its global prevalence tends to increase parallel to the extended life 
expectancy in world. The beneficial effect of ω-3 PUFAs on cognitive impairment 
has been demonstrated in some experimental and cohort studies. In this study we 
aimed to assess the effect of low dose docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) supplementation on cognitive status in the elderly.
METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study, 199 individuals 
aged ≥65 years with normal or mild to moderate cognition impairment were 
assigned to receive either 180 mg of DHA plus 120 mg of EPA or placebo for 
180 days. Cognitive status was assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) and Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) score.
RESULTS: MMSE and AMT scores were not different at the time of allocation [18.84 
(5.37), 18.55 (5.12), (P = 0.70) and 4.81 (2.79) and 4.64 (2.77), (P = 0.67) 
respectively] and over 6 months between the ω-3 PUFA- and placebo- treated 
groups [18.57 (5.21), 18.39 (5.10), (P = 0.80) and 4.64 (2.77) and 4.48 (2.69) 
and (P = 0.67)]. The participants were categorized based on MMSE score into 
normal cognition, mild and moderate cognitive impairment. After multivariate 
adjustment, there was no significant difference among categorized groups 
regarding the ω-3 PUFA effect except in normal cognition group, that amount of 
decline in AMT in ω-3 poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was less than placebo 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: It seems that prescription of low dose ω-3 PUFAs for 6 months had 
no significant beneficial effects on improvement of cognition or prevention of 
cognitive decline in older people.

BACKGROUND: In the BRIM-3 trial, vemurafenib was associated with risk reduction 
versus dacarbazine of both death and progression in patients with advanced 
BRAF(V600) mutation-positive melanoma. We present an extended follow-up analysis 
of the total population and in the BRAF(V600E) and BRAF(V600K) mutation 
subgroups.
METHODS: Patients older than 18 years, with treatment-naive metastatic melanoma 
and whose tumour tissue was positive for BRAF(V600) mutations were eligible. 
Patients also had to have a life expectancy of at least 3 months, an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate 
haematological, hepatic, and renal function. Patients were randomly assigned by 
interactive voice recognition system to receive either vemurafenib (960 mg 
orally twice daily) or dacarbazine (1000 mg/m(2) of body surface area 
intravenously every 3 weeks). Coprimary endpoints were overall survival and 
progression-free survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat population 
(n=675), with data censored at crossover. A sensitivity analysis was done. This 
trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01006980.
FINDINGS: 675 eligible patients were enrolled from 104 centres in 12 countries 
between Jan 4, 2010, and Dec 16, 2010. 337 patients were randomly assigned to 
receive vemurafenib and 338 to receive dacarbazine. Median follow-up was 12·5 
months (IQR 7·7-16·0) on vemurafenib and 9·5 months (3·1-14·7) on dacarbazine. 
83 (25%) of the 338 patients initially randomly assigned to dacarbazine crossed 
over from dacarbazine to vemurafenib. Median overall survival was significantly 
longer in the vemurafenib group than in the dacarbazine group (13·6 months [95% 
CI 12·0-15·2] vs 9·7 months [7·9-12·8]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·70 [95% CI 
0·57-0·87]; p=0·0008), as was median progression-free survival (6·9 months [95% 
CI 6·1-7·0] vs 1·6 months [1·6-2·1]; HR 0·38 [95% CI 0·32-0·46]; p<0·0001). For 
the 598 (91%) patients with BRAF(V600E) disease, median overall survival in the 
vemurafenib group was 13·3 months (95% CI 11·9-14·9) compared with 10·0 months 
(8·0-14·0) in the dacarbazine group (HR 0·75 [95% CI 0·60-0·93]; p=0·0085); 
median progression-free survival was 6·9 months (95% CI 6·2-7·0) and 1·6 months 
(1·6-2·1), respectively (HR 0·39 [95% CI 0·33-0·47]; p<0·0001). For the 57 (9%) 
patients with BRAF(V600K) disease, median overall survival in the vemurafenib 
group was 14·5 months (95% CI 11·2-not estimable) compared with 7·6 months 
(6·1-16·6) in the dacarbazine group (HR 0·43 [95% CI 0·21-0·90]; p=0·024); 
median progression-free survival was 5·9 months (95% CI 4·4-9·0) and 1·7 months 
(1·4-2·9), respectively (HR 0·30 [95% CI 0·16-0·56]; p<0·0001). The most 
frequent grade 3-4 events were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (65 [19%] of 
337 patients) and keratoacanthomas (34 [10%]), rash (30 [9%]), and abnormal 
liver function tests (38 [11%]) in the vemurafenib group and neutropenia (26 
[9%] of 287 patients) in the dacarbazine group. Eight (2%) patients in the 
vemurafenib group and seven (2%) in the dacarbazine group had grade 5 events.
INTERPRETATION: Inhibition of BRAF with vemurafenib improves survival in 
patients with the most common BRAF(V600E) mutation and in patients with the less 
common BRAF(V600K) mutation.

BACKGROUND: Apixaban (5 mg BID), dabigatran (available as 150 mg and 110 mg BID 
in Europe), and rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) are 3 novel oral anticoagulants 
(NOACs) currently approved for stroke prevention in patients with atrial 
fibrillation (AF).
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
apixaban against other NOACs from the perspective of the United Kingdom National 
Health Services.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the pharmacoeconomic impact of 
apixaban versus other NOACs over a lifetime. Pair-wise indirect treatment 
comparisons were conducted against other NOACs by using ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for 
Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation), 
RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy), and 
ROCKET-AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With 
Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial 
Fibrillation) trial results for the following end points: ischemic stroke, 
hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, other major bleeds, clinically 
relevant nonmajor bleeds, myocardial infarction, and treatment discontinuations. 
Outcomes were life-years, quality-adjusted life years gained, direct health care 
costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Apixaban was projected to increase life expectancy versus other NOACs, 
including dabigatran (both doses) and rivaroxaban. A small increase in 
therapeutic management costs was observed with apixaban due to projected gains 
in life expectancy and lower discontinuation rates anticipated on apixaban 
versus other NOACs through lifetime. The estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was £9611, £4497, and £5305 per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained with apixaban compared with dabigatran 150 mg BID, dabigatran 
110 mg BID, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily, respectively. Sensitivity analyses 
indicated that results were robust over a wide range of inputs.
CONCLUSIONS: Although our analysis was limited by the absence of head-to-head 
trials, based on the indirect comparison data available, our model projects that 
apixaban may be a cost-effective alternative to dabigatran 150 mg BID, 
dabigatran 110 mg BID, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily for stroke prevention in 
AF patients from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Services.

Mammalian embryos develop in coordination with extraembryonic tissues, which 
support embryonic development by implanting embryos into the uterus, supplying 
nutrition, providing a confined niche, and also providing patterning signals to 
embryos. Here, we show that in mouse embryos, the expansion of the amniotic 
cavity (AC), which is formed between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, 
provides the mechanical forces required for a type of morphogenetic movement of 
the notochord known as convergent extension (CE) in which the cells converge to 
the midline and the tissue elongates along the antero-posterior (AP) axis. The 
notochord is stretched along the AP axis, and the expansion of the AC is 
required for CE. Both mathematical modeling and physical simulation showed that 
a rectangular morphology of the early notochord caused the application of 
anisotropic force along the AP axis to the notochord through the isotropic 
expansion of the AC. AC expansion acts upstream of planar cell polarity (PCP) 
signaling, which regulates CE movement. Our results highlight the importance of 
extraembryonic tissues as a source of the forces that control the morphogenesis 
of embryos.

Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of immediate versus delayed treatment of 
hepatitis C virus-infected patients in a country with limited resources: the 
case of Egypt.

Sorbonne Paris Cité, F-75018 Paris, France.

BACKGROUND: Because of logistical and economic issues, in Egypt, as in other 
resource-limited settings, decision makers should determine for which patients 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment should be prioritized. We assessed the 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different treatment initiation 
strategies.
METHODS: Using a Markov model, we simulated HCV disease in chronically infected 
patients in Egypt, to compare lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy 
(QALE), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of different 
treatment initiation strategies.
RESULTS: Immediate treatment of patients at stages F1/F2/F3 was less expensive 
and more effective than delaying treatment until more severe stages or not 
providing treatment (in patients diagnosed at F1: QALE = 18.32 years if 
treatment at F1 vs 18.22 if treatment at F2). Treatment of F4 patients was more 
effective than no treatment at all (QALE = 10.33 years vs 8.77 years) and was 
cost-effective (ICER = $1915/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). When 
considering that affordable triple therapies, including new direct-acting 
antivirals, will be available starting in 2016, delaying treatment until stage 
F2, then treating all patients regardless of their disease stage after 2016, was 
found to be cost-effective (ICER = $33/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: In Egypt, immediate treatment of patients with fibrosis stage F1-F3 
who present to care is less expensive and more effective than delaying 
treatment. However, immediate treatment at stage F1 is only slightly more 
effective than waiting for disease to progress to stage F2 before starting 
treatment and is sensitive to the forthcoming availability of new treatments. 
Treating patients at stage F4 is highly effective and cost-effective. In Egypt, 
decision makers should prioritize treatment for F4 patients and delay treatment 
for F1 patients who present to care.

Diagnosis, treatment and survival of 65 patients with malignant peripheral nerve 
sheath tumors.

BACKGROUND: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) account for up to 
10% of all malignant soft tissue tumors in adults. Insufficient data are 
available on diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment modalities as well 
as prognosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Examining our sarcoma database from 1991 to 2004, we 
evaluated 65 patients with histologically-proven MPNST in terms of clinical, 
histopathological as well as prognostic factors.
RESULTS: The median age was 54 years, the gender ratio was equal, the follow-up 
36 months. Extremities were involved in 75% of cases, the trunk in 15% and the 
head in 9% respectively. A total of 9% of our patients presented with 
disease-positive lymph nodes, in 28%, distant metastases (primarily lung) 
occurred. A primary closure was performed in 60%; in 22%, a tendon transfer and 
flap coverage was necessary. In 11% of cases, the final treatment was 
amputation. The initial diagnoses which had to be revised during re-evaluation 
was 32.3%. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 49%. Overall, 27% of 
patients first operated on at our Institution experienced local recurrence. The 
only significant negative prognostic factor for survival was occurrence of 
metastases.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate, that MPNST are tumor entities with a high rate of 
initial diagnoses that subsequently need to be adjusted (32%). Therefore, 
reference pathology should be requested. Tumor localization close to major 
nerves often results in functional restrictions after tumor resection. Because 
of the low mean life expectancy, early functional reconstructions by tendon 
transfer should be performed instead of nerve repair. Despite less radical tumor 
excision with often marginal resections, the survival rate is comparable to that 
of the literature where patients were treated with more radical procedures.

BACKGROUND: The combination of hydroxycitrate and lipoic acid has been 
demonstrated by several laboratories to be effective in reducing murine cancer 
growth.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients had failed standard chemotherapy and were 
offered only palliative care by their referring oncologist. Karnofsky status was 
between 50 and 80. Life expectancy was estimated to be between 2 and 6 months. 
Ten consecutive patients with chemoresistant advanced metastatic cancer were 
offered compassionate metabolic treatment. They were treated with a combination 
of lipoic acid at 600 mg i.v. (Thioctacid), hydroxycitrate at 500 mg t.i.d. 
(Solgar) and low-dose naltrexone at 5 mg (Revia) at bedtime. Primary sites were 
lung carcinoma (n=2), colonic carcinoma (n=2), ovarian carcinoma (n=1), 
esophageal carcinoma (n=1), uterine sarcoma (n=1), cholangiocarcinoma (n=1), 
parotid carcinoma (n=1) and unknown primary (n=1). The patients had been heavily 
pre-treated. One patient had received four lines of chemotherapy, four patients 
three lines, four patients two lines and one patient had received radiation 
therapy and chemotherapy. An eleventh patient with advanced prostate cancer 
resistant to hormonotherapy treated with hydroxycitrate, lipoic acid and 
anti-androgen is also reported.
RESULTS: One patient was unable to receive i.v. lipoic acid and was switched to 
oral lipoic acid (Tiobec). Toxicity was limited to transient nausea and 
vomiting. Two patients died of progressive disease within two months. Two other 
patients had to be switched to conventional chemotherapy combined with metabolic 
treatment, one of when had a subsequent dramatic tumor response. Disease in the 
other patients was either stable or very slowly progressive. The patient with 
hormone-resistant prostate cancer had a dramatic fall in Prostate-Specific 
Antigen (90%), which is still decreasing.
CONCLUSION: These very primary results suggest the lack of toxicity and the 
probable efficacy of metabolic treatment in chemoresistant advanced carcinoma. 
It is also probable that metabolic treatment enhances the efficacy of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. These results are in line with published animal data. A randomized 
clinical trial is warranted.

Could a revision of the current guidelines for cancer drug use improve the 
quality of cancer treatment?

Clinical practice guidelines are indispensable for such a variable disease as 
malignant solid tumors, with the complex possibilities of drug treatment. The 
current guidelines may be criticized on several points, however. First, there is 
a lack of information on the outcome of treatment, such as the expected success 
and failure rates. Treating not only drug responders but also nonresponders, 
that is, patients with drug resistance, must result in failures. There is no 
mention of the possibility of excluding the drug nonresponders, identifiable by 
special laboratory tests and no consideration is given to the different side 
effects of the recommended drug regimens. Nor are there any instructions 
concerning tumor cases for which anticancer drug treatment is futile. In such 
cases, early palliative care may lead to significant improvements in both life 
quality and life expectancy. Not least, there is no transparency concerning the 
preparation of the guidelines: persons cannot be identified who could give a 
statement of conflicts of interest, and responsibility is assumed only by 
anonymous medical associations. A revision of the current guidelines could 
considerably improve cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION: The U.S. pharmaceutical industry is defined by the U.S. Census 
Bureau as "companies engaged in researching, developing, manufacturing and 
marketing of medicines and biological for human or veterinary use". Besides its 
main role in improving human health, the US pharmaceutical industry represents 
one of the most critical, key decision makers' lobbying prone and competitive 
sectors in the economy. The cost in the environment of very limited government 
price regulation remains one of the major problems fuelling aggregate health 
care cost inflation. Pharmaceuticals have created huge benefits for public 
health and economic productivity by the means of saving lives, increasing life 
expectancy, reducing illness related suffering, preventing surgeries and 
decreasing hospital stays.
PURPOSE: The goal of this review paper is to show the present conditions and 
future trends of the pharmaceutical industry in the U.S.
METHODOLOGY: THIS PAPER REPRESENTS A THOROUGH LITERATURE REVIEW OF THE 
MULTIFACETED SOURCES INCLUDING: studies, books, peer reviewed journals, U.S. 
government sources (i.e. U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, 
etc.).
DISCUSSION: In the thirty years pharmaceutical companies have consistently 
developed and launched new medicines, bringing hope to sick or - at risk 
patients. They also usually provide above the average financial returns for its 
shareholders. U.S. pharmaceutical companies had as their goal to discover 
blockbuster drugs. Blockbuster drugs are generally defined as drugs that solve 
medical problems common to hundreds of millions of people and, at the same time 
generate large sales increases and profits for the pharmaceutical companies. The 
main approach of these companies includes huge investments in research and 
development (R&D), innovation, marketing and sales. The trend analysis shows 
that for the most part the era of blockbuster drugs is nearing an end.
CONCLUSION: Numerous blockbuster drugs will be coming off patent in the next few 
years, opening the way to generics and eliminating a major source of the 
industry's profits. Still, there is plenty of room for improvement in the
