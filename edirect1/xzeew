pathogenesis and multidisciplinary management of fractures in PWH. The PubMed, 
Scopus and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify original 
research articles, meta-analyses, and scientific reviews on fragility fractures 
in PWH. The mechanism underlying bone loss in PWH is multifactorial and includes 
recurrent joint bleeding, reduced physical activity with consequent reduction in 
mechanical load, nutritional deficiencies (particularly vitamin D), and FVIII 
and FIX deficiency. Pharmacological treatment of fractures in PWH includes 
antiresorptive, anabolic and dual action drugs. When conservative management is 
not possible, surgery is the preferred option, particularly in severe 
arthropathy, and rehabilitation is a key component in restoring function and 
maintaining mobility. Appropriate multidisciplinary fracture management and an 
adapted and tailored rehabilitation pathway are essential to improve the quality 
of life of PWH and prevent long-term complications. Further clinical trials are 
needed to improve the management of fractures in PWH.

Dystrophies.

Muscular dystrophies are inherited neuromuscular diseases, resulting in 
progressive disability and often affecting life expectancy. The most severe, 
common types are Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Limb-girdle 
sarcoglycanopathy, which cause advancing muscle weakness and wasting. These 
diseases share a common pathomechanism where, due to the loss of the anchoring 
dystrophin (DMD, dystrophinopathy) or due to mutations in sarcoglycan-encoding 
genes (LGMDR3 to LGMDR6), the α-sarcoglycan ecto-ATPase activity is lost. This 
disturbs important purinergic signaling: An acute muscle injury causes the 
release of large quantities of ATP, which acts as a damage-associated molecular 
pattern (DAMP). DAMPs trigger inflammation that clears dead tissues and 
initiates regeneration that eventually restores normal muscle function. However, 
in DMD and LGMD, the loss of ecto-ATPase activity, that normally curtails this 
extracellular ATP (eATP)-evoked stimulation, causes exceedingly high eATP 
levels. Thus, in dystrophic muscles, the acute inflammation becomes chronic and 
damaging. The very high eATP over-activates P2X7 purinoceptors, not only 
maintaining the inflammation but also tuning the potentially compensatory P2X7 
up-regulation in dystrophic muscle cells into a cell-damaging mechanism 
exacerbating the pathology. Thus, the P2X7 receptor in dystrophic muscles is a 
specific therapeutic target. Accordingly, the P2X7 blockade alleviated 
dystrophic damage in mouse models of dystrophinopathy and sarcoglycanopathy. 
Therefore, the existing P2X7 blockers should be considered for the treatment of 
these highly debilitating diseases. This review aims to present the current 
understanding of the eATP-P2X7 purinoceptor axis in the pathogenesis and 
treatment of muscular dystrophies.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by a progressive increase in 
pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. In a short time, 
it leads to right ventricular failure and, consequently, to death. The most 
common causes of PH include left heart disease and lung disease. Despite the 
significant development of medicine and related sciences observed in recent 
years, we still suffer from a lack of effective treatment that would 
significantly influence the prognosis and prolong life expectancy of patients 
with PH. One type of PH is pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The 
pathophysiology of PAH is based on increased cell proliferation and resistance 
to apoptosis in the small pulmonary arteries, leading to pulmonary vascular 
remodeling. However, studies conducted in recent years have shown that 
epigenetic changes may also lie behind the pathogenesis of PAH. Epigenetics is 
the study of changes in gene expression that are not related to changes in the 
sequence of nucleotides in DNA. In addition to DNA methylation or histone 
modification, epigenetic research focuses on non-coding RNAs, which include 
microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Preliminary research 
results give hope that targeting epigenetic regulators may lead to new, 
potential therapeutic possibilities in the treatment of PAH.

The increase in life expectancy without a decrease in the years lived without 
disability leads to the rise of the population aged over 65 years prone to 
polypharmacy. The novel antidiabetic drugs can improve this global therapeutic 
and health problem in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). We aimed to 
establish the efficacy (A1c hemoglobin reduction) and safety of the newest 
antidiabetic drugs (considered so due to their novelty in medical practice use), 
specifically DPP-4i, SGLT-2i, GLP-1 Ra, and tirzepatide. The present 
meta-analysis followed the protocol registered at Prospero with the 
CRD42022330442 registration number. The reduction in HbA1c in the DPP4-i class 
for tenegliptin was 95% CI -0.54 [-1.1, 0.01], p = 0.06; in the SGLT2-iclass for 
ipragliflozin 95% CI -0.2 [-0.87, 0.47], p = 0.55; and for tofogliflozin 95% CI 
3.13 [-12.02, 18.28], p = 0.69, while for tirzepatide it was 0.15, 95% CI 
[-0.50, 0.80] (p = 0.65). The guidelines for treatment in type 2 DM are provided 
from cardiovascular outcome trials that report mainly major adverse 
cardiovascular events and data about efficacy. The newest antidiabetic 
non-insulinic drugs are reported to be efficient in lowering HbA1c, but this 
effect depends between classes, molecules, or patients' age. The newest 
antidiabetic drugs are proven to be efficient molecules in terms of HbA1c 
decrease, weight reduction, and safety, but more studies are needed in order to 
characterize exactly their efficacy and safety profiles.

Despite the increasing availability of modern treatments, including personalized 
therapies, there is a strong need to search for new drugs that will be effective 
in the fight against cancer. The chemotherapeutics currently available to 
oncologists do not always yield satisfactory outcomes when used in systemic 
treatments, and patients experience burdensome side effects during their 
application. In the era of personalized therapies, doctors caring for non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients have been given a powerful weapon, namely 
molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapies. They can be used when 
genetic variants of the disease qualifying for therapy are diagnosed. These 
therapies have contributed to the extension of the overall survival time in 
patients. Nevertheless, effective treatment may be hindered in the case of 
clonal selection of tumor cells with acquired resistance mutations. The 
state-of-the-art therapy currently used in NSCLC patients is immunotherapy 
targeting the immune checkpoints. Although it is effective, some patients have 
been observed to develop resistance to immunotherapy, but its cause is still 
unknown. Personalized therapies extend the lifespan and time to cancer 
progression in patients, but only those with a confirmed marker qualifying for 
the treatment (gene mutations/rearrangements or PD-L1 expression on tumor cells) 
can benefit from these therapies. They also cause less burdensome side effects 
than chemotherapy. The article is focused on compounds that can be used in 
oncology and produce as few side effects as possible. The search for compounds 
of natural origin, e.g., plants, bacteria, or fungi, exhibiting anticancer 
properties seems to be a good solution. This article is a literature review of 
research on compounds of natural origin that can potentially be used as part of 
NSCLC therapies.

Padres Preparados, Jóvenes Saludables was a Latino family-based obesity 
prevention intervention implemented from 2017 to 2020 across eight programs 
in-person only, in a blended format (online/in-person), and online only. The 
intervention aimed to enhance father parenting skills to improve adolescent diet 
and activity behaviors. Mothers were encouraged to attend. Factors associated 
with participation were explored using a mixed-methods, qualitative (focus 
group/individual interviews by Zoom) and quantitative (process evaluation) 
design. Eleven focus group and 24 individual interviews were completed after 
participation with 24 fathers, 27 mothers, and 40 adolescents with responses not 
sorted by delivery method before analysis. Binomial logistic regression models 
examined associations between fathers' program completion and predictor 
variables of delivery characteristics, father demographic characteristics, and 
family attendance patterns. Parents were married (96% fathers, 76% mothers), had 
low income, a high school education or less (68% fathers, 81% mothers), and had 
lived in the United States a mean of 19 years. Parents were motivated to 
participate to improve health, and to be involved with and improve communication 
with their child. Common barriers to participation were work and life priorities 
and programmatic factors including scheduling conflicts and technological 
issues. Participation was greater for fathers attending sessions in-person 
compared with online only (OR = 11.6). Fathers were more likely to participate 
if they attended sessions with family members vs. not attending with family 
members (OR = 7.2). To maximize participation, findings suggest involving 
multiple parents/caregivers and adolescents, addressing contextual and 
programmatic barriers, and promoting benefits of better health and relations 
with family members.

AIMS: To determine the global and regional burden of stroke due to high 
temperature and the spatiotemporal trends in 204 countries and territories from 
1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Based on Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, deaths, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and age-standardized mortality rate 
(ASMR) and age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) for stroke attributable to high 
temperature (i.e. a daily mean temperature warmer than the theoretical 
minimum-risk exposure level (TMREL)) were calculated in global, geographical 
location, and country and analyzed by age, sex, subtypes, and socio-demographic 
index (SDI) from 1990 to 2019. The trends in ASMR and ASDR from 1990 to 2019 
were estimated by linear regression model. The regression coefficients (β) 
referred to a mean change of per year for ASMR or ASDR attributable to high 
temperature.
RESULTS: The global burden of stroke attributable to high temperature had an 
increase trend from 1990 to 2019 (β = 0.005, 95% uncertainty interval 
(UI) = 0.003-0.007 for ASMR and β = 0.104, 95% UI = 0.066-0.142 for ASDR, 
respectively). Globally, in 2019, an estimated 0.048 million deaths and 
1.01 million DALYs of stroke were attributable to high temperature, and the 
global ASMR and ASDR of stroke attributable to high temperature were 0.60 (95% 
UI = 0.07-1.30) and 13.31 (1.40-28.97) per 100,000 population, respectively. The 
largest burden occurred in Western Sub-Saharan Africa, followed by South Asia, 
Southeast Asia, and North Africa and the Middle East. ASMR and ASDR increased 
with age and were higher in males and for intracerebral hemorrhage, and were the 
highest in the low SDI regions. In 2019, the region with the largest percentage 
increase in ASMR and ASDR attributable to high temperature was Eastern 
Sub-Saharan Africa from 1990 to 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: Stroke burden due to high temperature has been increasing, and a 
higher burden was observed in people aged 65-75 years, males, and countries with 
a low SDI. Stroke burden attributable to high temperature constitutes a major 
global public health concern in the context of global warming.

Extension of life span by down-regulation of enzymes catalyzing tryptophan 
conversion into kynurenine: Possible implications for mechanisms of aging.

The end products of catabolism of tryptophan (Trp), an essential amino acid, are 
known to affect mechanism(s) of aging, a neurodegenerative condition. This 
review focuses on the possible role of the initial step of Trp catabolism, 
kynurenine (Kyn) formation from Trp, in aging mechanism(s). Rate-limiting 
enzymes of Trp conversion into Kyn are tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (TDO) or 
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Aging is associated with up-regulated 
production of cortisol, an activator of TDO, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
inducers of IDO. The other rate-limiting enzyme of Kyn formation from Trp is 
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that regulates Trp availability as a 
substrate for TDO. Inhibitors of TDO (alpha-methyl tryptophan) and ABC 
transporter (5-methyltryptophan) extended life span of wild-type Drosophila. 
Life span prolongation was observed in TDO knockdown of Caenorhabditis elegans 
and in TDO or ABC transporter-deficient Drosophila mutants. Down-regulation of 
enzymes catalyzing Kyn conversion into kynurenic acid (KYNA) and 
3-hydroxykynurenine decreases life span. Considering that down-regulation of 
Methuselah (MTH) gene prolonged life span, aging-accelerating effect of KYNA, a 
GPR35/MTH agonist, might depend on MTH gene activation. Mice treated with TDO 
inhibitor, benserazide, an ingredient of anti-Parkinson medication carbidopa, 
and TDO-deficient Drosophila mutants were resistant to inducement of 
aging-associated Metabolic Syndrome by high-sugar or high-fat diets. 
Up-regulation of Kyn formation was associated with accelerated aging and 
increased mortality in human subjects. Trp-Kyn pathway is evolutionary conserved 
(from yeasts, through insects, worms, vertebrates to humans). Further studies 
might explore possible antiaging effect of down-regulation of Kyn formation from 
Trp by dietary, pharmacological, and genetic interventions.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficiency of Dyevert™ Power XT compared to the 
standard clinical practice when used for percutaneous coronary interventions 
(PCI).
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate, over 3-month cycles and a 
lifetime time horizon, the cumulative costs and health outcomes (life years 
gained [LYG] and quality-adjusted life years [QALY]) in a hypothetical cohort of 
1,000 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 3b-4 and an average age of 72 
years. The incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury for these patients 
is 18.89% in routine practice and 7.78% with Dyevert. QALYs were estimated by 
applying utilities by health state. Transitions between states and utilities 
were obtained from the literature. Overall all-cause and state-specific 
mortality were considered. The total cost (€2,022) estimated with the National 
Health System perspective included cost of the procedure and of CKD management. 
The parameters were validated by a panel of experts. A discount rate (3% per 
year) was applied to costs and outcomes.
RESULTS: The use of Dyevert yielded more health benefits (34.60 LYG and 5.69 
QALYs) compared to the current standard practice (33.11 LYG and 5.38 QALYs). 
Lifetime cost accumulated at the end of the simulation resulted €30,211/patient 
with Dyevert and €33,895/patient with current standard clinical practice.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of Dyevert™ Power XT resulted dominant option, due to its 
higher effectiveness and lower cost as compared to standard clinical practice 
and, therefore, a preferred option in patients with CKD stages 3b-4 undergoing 
PCI in Spain.

BACKGROUND: Manual dexterity is a fundamental motor skill that allows us to 
perform complex daily tasks. Neuromuscular injuries, however, can lead to the 
loss of hand dexterity. Although numerous advanced assistive robotic hands have 
been developed, we still lack dexterous and continuous control of multiple 
degrees of freedom in real-time. In this study, we developed an efficient and 
robust neural decoding approach that can continuously decode intended finger 
dynamic movements for real-time control of a prosthetic hand.
METHODS: High-density electromyogram (HD-EMG) signals were obtained from the 
extrinsic finger flexor and extensor muscles, while participants performed 
either single-finger or multi-finger flexion-extension movements. We implemented 
a deep learning-based neural network approach to learn the mapping from HD-EMG 
features to finger-specific population motoneuron firing frequency (i.e., 
neural-drive signals). The neural-drive signals reflected motor commands 
specific to individual fingers. The predicted neural-drive signals were then 
used to continuously control the fingers (index, middle, and ring) of a 
prosthetic hand in real-time.
RESULTS: Our developed neural-drive decoder could consistently and accurately 
predict joint angles with significantly lower prediction errors across 
single-finger and multi-finger tasks, compared with a deep learning model 
directly trained on finger force signals and the conventional EMG-amplitude 
estimate. The decoder performance was stable over time and was robust to 
variations of the EMG signals. The decoder also demonstrated a substantially 
better finger separation with minimal predicted error of joint angle in the 
unintended fingers.
CONCLUSIONS: This neural decoding technique offers a novel and efficient 
neural-machine interface that can consistently predict robotic finger kinematics 
with high accuracy, which can enable dexterous control of assistive robotic 
hands.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about the use of long-term non-invasive ventilation 
(NIV) in the elderly. We aimed to assess if the effectiveness of long-term NIV 
of patients ≥ 80 years (older) was not greatly inferior to that of patients < 75 
years (younger).
METHODS: This retrospective exposed/unexposed cohort study included all patients 
established on long-term NIV treated at Rouen University Hospital between 2017 
and 2019. Follow-up data were collected at the first visit following NIV 
initiation. The primary outcome was daytime PaCO2 with a non-inferiority margin 
of 50% of the improvement of PaCO2 for older patients compared to younger 
patients.
RESULTS: We included 55 older patients and 88 younger patients. After adjustment 
on the baseline PaCO2, the mean daytime PaCO2 was reduced by 0.95 (95% CI: 0.67; 
1.23) kPa in older patients compared to1.03 (95% CI: 0.81; 1.24) kPa in younger 
patients for a ratio of improvements estimated at 0.95/1.03 = 0.93 (95% CI: 
0.59; 1.27, one-sided p = 0.007 for non-inferiority to 0.50). Median 
(interquartile range) daily use was 6 (4; 8.1) hours in older versus 7.3 (5; 
8.4) hours in younger patients. No significant differences were seen in the 
quality of sleep and NIV safety. The 24-months survival was 63.6% in older and 
87.2% in younger patients.
CONCLUSIONS: effectiveness and safety seemed acceptable in older patients, with 
a life expectancy long enough to expect a mid-term benefit, suggesting that 
initiation of long-term NIV should not be refused only based on age. Prospective 
studies are needed.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is associated with a 
higher risk of noncardia intestinal gastric adenocarcinoma (GA). The aim of this 
study was to estimate lifetime benefits, complications, and cost-effectiveness 
of GIM surveillance using esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).
METHODS: We developed a semi-Markov microsimulation model of patients with 
incidentally detected GIM, to compare the effectiveness of EGD surveillance with 
no surveillance at 10-year, 5-year, 3-year, 2-year, and 1-year intervals. We 
modeled a simulated cohort of 1,000,000 US individuals aged 50 with incidental 
GIM. Outcome measures were lifetime GA incidence, mortality, number of EGDs, 
complications, undiscounted life-years gained, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio with a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: In the absence of surveillance, the model simulated 32.0 lifetime GA 
cases and 23.0 lifetime GA deaths per 1000 individuals with GIM, respectively. 
Among surveilled individuals, simulated lifetime GA incidence (per 1000) 
decreased with shorter surveillance intervals (10-year to 1-year, 11.2-6.1) as 
did GA mortality (7.4-3.6). Compared with no surveillance, all modeled 
surveillance intervals yielded greater life expectancy (87-190 undiscounted 
life-years gained per 1000); 5-year surveillance provided the greatest number of 
life-years gained per EGD performed and was the cost-effective strategy 
($40,706/QALY). In individuals with risk factors of family history of GA or 
anatomically extensive, incomplete-type GIM intensified 3-year surveillance was 
cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $28,156/QALY and 
$87,020/QALY, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Using microsimulation modeling, surveillance of incidentally 
detected GIM every 5 years is associated with reduced GA incidence/mortality and 
is cost-effective from a health care sector perspective. Real-world studies 
evaluating the impact of GIM surveillance on GA incidence and mortality in the 
United States are needed.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: This study assessed the worldwide burden of digestive 
diseases between 1990 and 2019.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Global Burden of Diseases study, covering 18 
digestive diseases across 204 countries and territories. Key disease burden 
indicators, including incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs), were studied. Linear regression analysis was applied to the 
natural logarithm of age-standardized outcomes to determine the annual percent 
change.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 7.32 billion incidents and 2.86 billion prevalent 
cases of digestive diseases, resulting in 8 million deaths and 277 million DALYs 
lost. Little to no decrease in global age-standardized incidence and prevalence 
of digestive diseases was observed between 1990 and 2019, with 95,582 and 35,106 
cases per 100,000 individuals in 2019, respectively. The age-standardized death 
rate was 102 per 100,000 individuals. Digestive diseases accounted for a 
significant portion of the overall disease burden, with more than one-third of 
prevalent cases having a digestive etiology. Enteric infections were the primary 
contributor to incidence, death, and DALYs lost, whereas cirrhosis and other 
chronic liver diseases had the highest prevalence rate. The burden of digestive 
diseases was inversely related to the sociodemographic index, with enteric 
infections being the predominant cause of death in low and low-middle quintiles 
and colorectal cancer in the high quintile.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant reductions in deaths and DALYs due to digestive 
diseases from 1990 to 2019, they remain prevalent. A significant disparity in 
the burden of digestive diseases exists among countries with different 
development levels.

Exposure to chemical contaminants found in foods has been associated with 
various adverse health effects. Burden of disease studies are increasingly used 
to estimate the public health impact of such exposures. The aims of this study 
were to estimate the burden of disease due to dietary exposure to four chemicals 
in France in 2019 (lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), methylmercury (MeHg), and inorganic 
arsenic (i-As)), and to develop harmonized methods that can be applied for other 
chemicals and countries. We used national food consumption data from the third 
French national food consumption survey, chemical food monitoring data from the 
Second French Total Diet Study (TDS), dose-response data and disability weights 
from scientific literature, and disease incidence and demographics from national 
statistics. We adopted a risk assessment approach to estimate disease burden, 
incidence, mortality, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) attributable to 
dietary exposure to the chemicals. In all models, we harmonized food 
classification and exposure assessment. We propagated uncertainty through the 
calculations using Monte Carlo simulation. We estimated that, among these 
chemicals, i-As and Pb were responsible for the highest disease burden. i-As was 
estimated to cause 820 DALYs, or approximately 1.25 DALYs per 100,000 
inhabitants. The estimated burden of Pb was 1834 to 5936 DALYs, or 2.7 (lower 
bound) to 8.96 (upper bound) DALYs/100,000. The burden of MeHg (192 DALYs), and 
Cd (0 DALY) was substantially lower. The foods contributing most to disease 
burden was drinks (30 %), "other foods" (mostly composite dishes) (19 %), and 
fish and seafood (7 %). Interpretation of estimates needs to consider all 
underlying uncertainties, linked with data and knowledge gaps. The harmonized 
models are the first to make use of data from TDS, which are available in 
several other countries. Thus, they can be applied to estimate the burden and to 
rank food-associated chemicals at national level.

OBJECTIVE: Analyze scientific literature on qualitative research that studies 
the medication experience -MedExp- and related pharmaceutical interventions that 
bring changes in patients' health. Through the content analysis of this scoping 
review, we intend to: 1) understand how pharmacists analyze the MedExp of their 
patients who receive Comprehensive Medication Management and 2) explain which 
categories they establish and how they explain the individual, psychological and 
cultural dimensions of MedExp.
METHODS: The scoping review followed recommendations from PRISMA Extension for 
Scoping Reviews. Medline (Pubmed), SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Psycinfo were 
used to identify research on MedExp from patients attended by pharmacists; and 
that they comply with quality standards, Standards for Reporting Qualitative 
Research. Articles published in English and Spanish were included.
RESULTS: 395 qualitative investigations were identified, 344 were excluded. In 
total, 19 investigations met the inclusion criteria. Agreement between 
reviewers, kappa index 0.923 95% CI (0.836-1.010). The units of analysis of the 
patients' speeches were related to how they were progressing in their 
medications and how it was built through MedExp, the influence it has on the 
experience of becoming ill, the connection with socioeconomic aspects, and 
beliefs. Based on MedExp, the pharmacists raised cultural proposals, support 
networks, health policies, and provide education and information about 
medication and disease. Additionally, characteristics of the interventions were 
identified, such as a dialogic model, therapeutic relationship, shared 
decision-making, comprehensive approach, and referrals to other professionals.
CONCLUSIONS: The MedExp is an extensive concept, which encompasses people's life 
experience who use medications based on their individual, psychological and 
social qualities. This MedExp is corporal, intentional, intersubjective and 
relational, expanding to the collective because it implies beliefs, culture, 
ethics and the socioeconomic and political reality of each person located in 
their context.

AIMS: England's Diabetic Eye Disease Screening Programme offers screening to 
every resident over age 12 with diabetes, starting as soon as possible after 
diagnosis and repeated annually. People first diagnosed with diabetes at older 
ages have shorter life expectancy and therefore may be less likely to benefit 
from screening and treatment. To inform decisions about whether diabetic eye 
screening policy should be stratified by age, we investigated the probability of 
receiving treatment according to age at first screening episode.
METHODS: This was a cohort study of participants in the Norfolk Diabetic 
Retinopathy Screening Programme from 2006 to 2017, with individuals' programme 
data linked to hospital treatment and death data recorded up to 2021. We 
estimated and compared the probability, annual incidence and screening costs of 
receiving retinal laser photocoagulation or intravitreal injection and of death, 
in age groups defined by age at first screening episode.
RESULTS: The probability of death increased with increasing age at diagnosis, 
while the probability of receiving either treatment decreased with increasing 
age. The estimated cost of screening per person who received either or both 
treatments was £18,608 among all participants, increasing with age up to £21,721 
in those aged 70-79 and £26,214 in those aged 80-89.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic retinopathy screening is less effective and less 
cost-effective with increasing age at diagnosis of diabetes, because of the 
increasing probability of death before participants develop sight-threatening 
diabetic retinopathy and can benefit from treatment. Upper age limits on entry 
into screening programmes or risk stratification in older age groups may, 
therefore, be justifiable.

The burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) differs between socioeconomic groups. The 
present study combines ongoing and plausible trends in T2D incidence and 
survival by income to forecast future trends in cases of T2D and life expectancy 
with and without T2D up to year 2040. Using Finnish total population data for 
those aged 30 years on T2D medication and mortality in 1995-2018, we developed 
and validated a multi-state life table model using age-, gender-, income- and 
calendar year-specific transition probabilities. We present scenarios based on 
constant and declining T2D incidence and on the effect of increasing and 
decreasing obesity on T2D incidence and mortality states up to 2040. With 
constant T2D incidence at 2019-level, the number of people living with T2D would 
increase by about 26% between 2020 and 2040. The lowest income group could 
expect more rapid increases in the number with T2D compared to the highest 
income group (30% vs. 23% respectively). If the incidence of T2D continues the 
recent declining trend, we predict about 14% fewer cases. However, if obesity 
increases two-fold, we predict 15% additional T2D cases. Unless, we reduce the 
obesity-related excess risk, the number of years lived without T2D could 
decrease up to 6 years for men in the lowest income group. Under all plausible 
scenarios, the burden of T2D is set to increase and it will be unequally 
distributed among socioeconomic groups. An increasing proportion of life 
expectancy will be spent with T2D.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend valve-sparing aortic root replacement 
(VSRR) procedures over valve replacement for the treatment of root aneurysm. The 
reimplantation technique seems to be the most widely used valve-sparing 
technique, with excellent outcomes in mostly single-center studies. The aim of 
this systematic review and meta-analysis is to present a comprehensive overview 
of clinical outcomes after VSRR with the reimplantation technique, and potential 
differences for bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) phenotype.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search of papers reporting 
outcomes after VSRR that were published since 2010. Studies solely reporting on 
acute aortic syndromes or congenital patients were excluded. Baseline 
characteristics were summarized using sample size weighting. Late outcomes were 
pooled using inverse variance weighting. Pooled Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves for 
time-to-event outcomes were generated. Further, a microsimulation model was 
developed to estimate life expectancy and risks of valve-related morbidity after 
surgery.
RESULTS: Forty-four studies, with 7,878 patients, matched the inclusion criteria 
and were included for analysis. Mean age at operation was 50 years and almost 
80% of patients were male. Pooled early mortality was 1.6% and the most common 
perioperative complication was chest re-exploration for bleeding (5.4%). Mean 
follow-up was 4.8±2.8 years. Linearized occurrence rates for aortic valve (AV) 
related complications such as endocarditis and stroke were below 0.3% 
patient-year. Overall survival was 99% and 89% at 1- and 10-year respectively. 
Freedom from reoperation was 99% and 91% after 1 and 10 years, respectively, 
with no difference between tricuspid and BAVs.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis shows excellent short- and 
long-term results of valve-sparing root replacement with the reimplantation 
technique in terms of survival, freedom from reoperation, and valve related 
complications with no difference between tricuspid and BAVs.
