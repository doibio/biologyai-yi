case of pomegranate peel extract which was negligible in AgNPs synthesized from 
kinnow peel extract. Particle sizes of AgNPs showed no statistically significant 
variance with p > 0.10 and thus, 2 mM was chosen for further experimentation and 
modification of cellulose based packaging material as it showed smallest average 
particle size. Zeta potential was observed to be nearly neutral with a partial 
negative strength due to presence of various phenolic compounds such as presence 
of gallic acid which was confirmed by ultrahigh performance liquid 
chromatography-photodiode array(UHPLC-PDA) detector. Thermal stability analysis 
of green synthesised AgNPs qualified the sterilisation conditions up to 100 °C. 
AgNPs green synthesized from both the peel extracts had higher polyphenolic 
content, antioxidant and radical scavenging activity as compared to peel 
extracts without treatment (p < 0.05). The cellulose based food grade packaging 
material was enrobed by green synthesised AgNPs. The characterisation of 
modified cellulose wrappers showed no significant difference in thickness of 
modified cellulose wrappers as compared with untreated cellulose wrapper 
(p > 0.42) while weight and grammage increased significantly in modified 
cellulose wrapper (p < 0.05). The colour values on CIE scale (L*, a* and b*) 
showed statistically significant increase in yellow and green colour (p < 0.05) 
for modified cellulose wrappers as compared to control wrapper. The oxygen 
permeability coefficient, water vapour permeability coefficient, water 
absorption capacity and water behaviour characteristics (water content, swelling 
degree and solubility) showed significant decrease (p < 0.05) for modified 
cellulose wrapper as compared to control wrapper. A uniform distribution and 
density of green synthesised AgNPs across cellulose wrapper matrix was observed 
through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images with no significant 
aggregation, confirming successful enrobing and stable immobilisation of 
nanoparticles from cellulose matrix. A seven-day storage study of bread wrapped 
in modified and control cellulose wrappers showed delayed occurrence of 
microbial, yeast and mould count in bread packaged in modified cellulose 
wrappers and thus, resulting in shelf life extension of bread. The results are 
encouraging for the potential applications of modified cellulose wrappers to 
replace polyethene based food packaging.

Microbial colonisations of gypsum from Eastern Poland (Badenian, Middle Miocene 
age) were investigated by Raman microspectrometry with a rarely used excitation 
445 nm excitation. Zones of microbial colonisation in selenitic gypsum 
endolithic outcrops comprise algae and cyanobacteria, which commonly contain the 
photosynthetic and protective pigments carotenoids, scytonemin and gloeocapsin. 
Diagnostic bands differing from those of scytonemin have been identified in 
black colonies in gypsum outcrops at Chotel Czierwony (Poland). Raman spectral 
signatures of scytonin are reported here for the first time in two endolithic 
specimens identified by the band wavenumbers predicted from DFT calculations. 
The strong or medium strong intensity Raman bands observed at 1603, 1585, 1559, 
1435, and 1424 cm-1. Other weaker bands were located at 1676 (sh), 1660 (sh), 
1649, 1399, 1362, 1342, 1320, 1294, 1272, 1259, and 1052 cm-1. The first 
observation of the Raman spectrum of scytonin in the cyanobacterial colonisation 
of gypsum facilitates the inclusion of this new biomolecular signature in the 
library of unique Raman spectra of biological pigments invaluable for detection 
of traces of life in frame of the planetary missions.

BACKGROUND: Centenarians and supercentenarians with exceptional longevity are 
excellent models for research towards improvements of healthy life expectancy. 
Extensive research regarding the maintenance and reduction of epigenetic age has 
provided insights into increasing healthy longevity. To this end, we explored 
the epigenetic signatures reflecting hallmarks of exceptional healthy longevity, 
including avoidance of age-related diseases and cognitive functional decline.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled Japanese non-centenarians 
(eligible participants aged 20-80 years) from the Tohoku Medical Megabank 
Community-Based Cohort Study and centenarians and supercentenarians (aged 
101-115 years) from the Tokyo Centenarian Study and the Japanese 
Semi-supercentenarian Study. We assessed participants' whole-blood DNA 
methylation profiles and then developed sex-specific and non-specific 
first-generation epigenetic clocks by elastic net regression, calculated 
individuals' epigenetic ages, and assessed their age acceleration. We also 
screened for age-related CpG sites in non-centenarians by epigenome-wide linear 
regression analyses and ANOVA. We subsequently investigated which CpG sites in 
centenarians and supercentenarians had DNA methylation patterns following the 
age-related findings obtained from non-centenarians and which did not. We 
further characterised CpG sites with hypermethylation or hypomethylation in the 
centenarians and supercentenarians using enrichment and protein-protein 
interaction network analyses.
FINDINGS: We enrolled 421 non-centenarians (231 [55%] women and 190 [45%] men; 
age range 20-78 years), recruited between May 20, 2013, and March 31, 2016, and 
94 centenarians and supercentenarians (66 women [70%] and 28 [30%] men; age 
range 101-115 years), recruited between Jan 20, 2001, and April 17, 2018. 
Non-sex-specific epigenetic clock showed the highest accuracy (r=0·96) based on 
which centenarians and supercentenarians had negative epigenetic age 
acceleration. Epigenome-wide association analyses further showed that 
centenarians and supercentenarians had younger-than-expected epigenetic states 
(DNA methylation profiles similar to those of non-centenarians) for 557 CpG 
sites enriched in cancer-related and neuropsychiatric-related genes, whereas 
these individuals had advanced (or older) epigenetic states for 163 CpG sites 
represented by genes related to TGF-β signalling, which is involved in 
anti-inflammatory responses and known to contribute to healthy ageing.
INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that exceptionally healthy longevity 
depends not only on maintaining young epigenetic states but also on advanced 
states of specific epigenetic regions.

OBJECTIVES: To examine how disease status and current health state influence 
treatment preferences of patients with multiple myeloma (MM).
METHODS: Participants with MM from France, Germany, and the United Kingdom 
completed a web-based survey that included a discrete choice experiment (DCE) 
and EQ-5D assessment. The DCE elicited preferences for 8 attributes: increased 
life expectancy, increased time to relapse, pain, fatigue, risk of infection, 
administration (route and duration), frequency of administration, and 
monitoring. Multinomial logit models were used to analyze DCE preference data 
and to calculate life expectancy trade-offs.
RESULTS: Three hundred participants with MM (newly diagnosed, transplant 
eligible, n = 108; newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible, n = 105; 
relapsed-refractory, n = 87) completed the survey. The most valued attributes 
were pain, fatigue, and increased life expectancy. Participants would want an 
additional 2.7 years of life expectancy (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4-3.1 
years) to tolerate extreme pain and an additional 2.0 years of life expectancy 
(95% CI 1.6-2.3 years) to tolerate constant fatigue. Participants in a better 
health state (third EQ-5D score quartile [0.897]) required less additional life 
expectancy than participants with a worse health state (first EQ-5D score 
quartile [0.662]) to tolerate extreme pain (2.3 years [95% CI 1.9-2.6 years] vs 
3.0 years [95% CI 2.6-3.4 years]; P = .007). There was little difference in 
treatment preferences between newly diagnosed and relapsed-refractory patients 
for pain, fatigue, and increased life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Current health state influenced treatment preferences of patients 
with MM more than disease status and should be considered when making treatment 
decisions.

BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data regarding shorter life expectancy after 
aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS).
METHODS: Among 3815 patients with severe AS enrolled in the CURRENT AS 
(Contemporary outcomes after sURgery and medical tREatmeNT in patients with 
severe Aortic Stenosis) registry, there were 1469 patients (initial AVR: n = 
647; conservative strategy: n = 822) with low surgical risk, 1642 patients 
(initial AVR: n = 433; conservative strategy: n = 1209) with intermediate 
surgical risk, and 704 patients (initial AVR: n = 117; conservative strategy: 
n = 587) with high surgical risk. Among 1163 patients who actually underwent 
surgical AVR as the initial strategy, patients were divided into 4 groups 
according to age <65 years (n = 185), 65 to 74 (n = 394), 75 to 80 (n = 345), 
and >80 (n = 239). The expected survival of the general Japanese population was 
obtained from the Statistics Bureau of Japan. The surgical risk was estimated 
using The Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) score.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 3.7 years. The cumulative incidences of 
all-cause death were significantly lower in the initial AVR strategy than in the 
initial conservative strategy across the 3 STS groups. Shorter life expectancy 
after surgical AVR was seen especially in younger patients. The observed 
mortality in low-risk patients was comparable to the expected mortality across 
all the age-groups, while intermediate-risk patients aged <75 years, and 
high-risk patients across all age-groups had higher mortality compared with the 
expected mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk stratification according to age and STS score might be 
useful to estimate shorter life expectancy after AVR, and these findings have 
implications for decision making in the choice of surgical or transcatheter AVR.

Cystic-fibrosis-related liver disease (CFLD) is a variable phenotype of CF. The 
severe CFLD variant with cirrhosis or portal hypertension has a poor prognosis 
and life expectancy. CFTR modulator therapies are now available for people with 
CF and eligibility for such treatment is based on their CFTR genotype. We 
evaluated the genetic eligibility for elexacaftor, tezacaftor, ivacaftor (ETI), 
and ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy in a previously reported CF cohort of 1591 
people with CF of whom 171 with severe CFLD. Based on their CFTR mutations, 13% 
(N=184/1420) of subjects without CFLD and 11% (N=19/171) of those with severe 
CFLD are not eligible for either ETI or IVA therapy. The non-eligible patients 
without CFLD or with severe CFLD can currently not take advantage of the 
potential benefits of these new treatments. Although this study cannot provide 
any data regarding the effect of ETI or IVA on the progression of severe CFLD, 
the consequences for ineligibility of patients with extreme liver phenotype may 
be even more significant because of their poorer disease risk profile.

BACKGROUND: Maternal exposure to fine particular matter (PM2.5) during 
pregnancy, including ambient and household PM2.5, has been linked with increased 
risk of preterm birth (PTB). However, the global spatio-temporal distribution of 
PTB-related deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to 
PM2.5 is not well documented. We estimated the global, regional, and national 
patterns and trends of PTB burden attributable to both ambient and household 
PM2.5 from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Based on the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019 database, we 
obtained the numbers of deaths and DALYs as well as age-standardized mortality 
rate (ASMR) and age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) of PTB attributable to total, 
ambient, and household PM2.5 by socio-demographic index (SDI) and sex during 
1990-2019. The average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) were calculated to 
assess the temporal trends of attributable burdens.
RESULTS: In 2019, 126,752 deaths and 11.3 million DALYs related to PTB worldwide 
(two-thirds in Western Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia) could be caused by 
excess PM2.5 above the theoretical minimum-risk exposure level (TMREL), of which 
39 % and 61 % were attributable to ambient PM2.5 and household PM2.5, 
respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the global ASMR due to ambient PM2.5 increased 
slightly by 7.08 % whereas that due to household PM2.5 decreased substantially 
by 58.81 %, although the latter still dominated the attributable PTB burden, 
especially in low and low-middle SDI regions. Similar results were also observed 
for ASDRs. In addition, PTB burden due to PM2.5 was higher in male infants and 
in lower SDI regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally in 2019, PM2.5 remains a great concern on the PTB burden, 
especially in Western Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Between 1990 and 2019, 
age-standardized burden of PTB due to ambient PM2.5 increased globally, while 
that due to household PM2.5 decreased markedly but still dominated in low and 
low-middle SDI regions.

Positively charged amino acids in the DNA polymerase domain are important for 
interaction with DNA. Two potential residues in the palm domain of Pca-Pol, a 
DNA polymerase from Pyrobaculum calidifontis, were identified and mutated to 
arginine in order to improve the properties of this enzyme. The mutant proteins 
were heterologously produced in Escherichia coli. Biochemical characterization 
revealed that there was no significant difference in pH, metal ion, buffer 
preferences, 3' - 5' exonuclease activity and error rate of the wild-type and 
the mutant enzymes. However, the specific activity, processivity and extension 
rate of the mutant enzymes increased significantly. Specific activity of one of 
the mutants (G522R-E555R) was nearly 9-fold higher than that of the wild-type 
enzyme. These properties make G522R-E555R mutant enzyme a potential candidate 
for commercial applications.

In this study, a novel chitosan nanoemulsion coating embedded with Valeriana 
officinalis essential oil (Ne-VOEO) was synthesized in order to improve the 
postharvest quality of Citrus sinensis fruits against infesting fungi, and 
aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) mediated nutritional deterioration. The developed 
nanoemulsion was characterized through SEM, FTIR, XRD, and DLS analyses. The 
nanoemulsion showed controlled delivery of VOEO responsible for effective 
inhibition of Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, A. versicolor, Penicillium italicum, 
and Fusarium oxysporum growth at 6.5, 5.0, 4.0, 5.5, and 3.5 μL/mL, respectively 
and AFB1 production at 5.0 μL/mL. The biochemical and molecular mechanism of 
aflatoxigenic A. flavus inhibition, and AFB1 diminution was associated with 
impairment in ergosterol biosynthesis, methylglyoxal production, and 
stereo-spatial binding of valerianol in the cavity of Ver-1 protein. During in 
vivo investigation, Ne-VOEO coating potentially restrained the weight loss, and 
respiratory rate of C. sinensis fruits with delayed degradation of soluble 
solids, titrable acidity, pH, and phenolic contents along with maintenance of 
SOD, CAT, APX activities (p < 0.05) and sensory attributes under specific 
storage conditions. Based on overall findings, Ne-VOEO nanoemulsion could be 
recommended as green, and smart antifungal coating agent in prolonging the 
shelf-life of stored fruits with enhanced AFB1 mitigation.

BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is still a major public health problem in India. This 
study aims to assess trends in the burden of tuberculosis from 1990 to 2019 for 
tracking success of tuberculosis control programme in India.
METHODS: In this study, the 2019 global burden of disease study data were used 
to measure the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life 
years lost (DALY)rates of Tuberculosis during 1990-2019 for India and its 
states. Age and gender-specific rates were also analyzed for India. All rates 
were age-standardized and 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were computed.
RESULT: Overall incidence, prevalence, death and DALY of TB decreased in India 
from 1990 to 2019. Tuberculosis morbidity and mortality was higher in males as 
compared to females. Incidence of TB was low in children up to 14 years of age. 
Prevalence of TB was higher in females as compared to males till 29 years of 
age, whereas higher prevalence was reported in males as compared to females in 
adults aged 30 years and more. Death rate of TB was low in children and young 
adults up to 29 years of age.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that overall incidence, prevalence, death and DALY 
of tuberculosis decreased from 1990 to 2019 in India. The burden of TB was 
higher among males as compared to females during study period. TB affects all 
the age groups but deaths were higher in older age groups.

BACKGROUND: During the last century, life expectancy has doubled. As a result, 
senior patients with cancer are more frequently referred for possible surgery. 
Pancreatic surgery is a complex surgery associated with significant 
postoperative morbidity. Surgical decision-making in the elderly population can 
be difficult because outcomes in the elderly are poorly defined. Our objective 
is to characterize differences in mortality and morbidity for pancreatic surgery 
in the elderly population.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing pancreatic head 
surgery in our tertiary referral center from 2015 to 2021 was conducted. 
Analysis was performed for the entire cohort, classifying patients into three 
age groups: <70 years, 70-79 years, and ≥80 years. Data from these three groups 
were compared, including comorbidity, oncologic outcomes and postoperative 
complications.
RESULTS: A total of 326 patients underwent pancreatic head resection. The 90-day 
mortality increased from 2.9% to 5.3% to 15.4% with increasing age (p = 0,015). 
There were no differences among the three groups in terms of postoperative 
morbidity. There was no difference in disease-free survival (DFS), but overall 
survival was better in patients under 70 years (p = 0,046).
CONCLUSION: Compared to younger patients, patients over 80 years old have a 
higher risk of mortality despite similar postoperative morbidity.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the global burden of type 2 diabetes in adolescents and 
young adults (aged 15-39 years) from 1990 to 2019.
DESIGN: Systematic analysis.
DATA SOURCE: Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. Participants aged 15-39 years 
from 204 countries and territories, 1990-2019.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Age standardised incidence rate, age standardised 
disability adjusted life years (DALY) rate, and age standardised mortality rate 
for type 2 diabetes in people aged 15-39 years from 1990 to 2019, and 
proportional DALY attributable to different risk factors.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, significant increases in age standardised incidence 
rate and age standardised DALY rate were found for type 2 diabetes in 
adolescents and young adults globally (P<0.001). Age standardised incidence rate 
(per 100 000 population) increased from 117.22 (95% confidence interval 117.07 
to 117.36) in 1990 to 183.36 (183.21 to 183.51) in 2019, and age standardised 
DALY rate (per 100 000 population) increased from 106.34 (106.20 to 106.48) in 
1990 to 149.61 (149.47 to 149.75) in 2019. The age standardised mortality rate 
(per 100 000 population) was modestly increased from 0.74 (0.72 to 0.75) in 1990 
to 0.77 (0.76 to 0.78) in 2019. When grouped by countries with different 
sociodemographic indexes, countries with a low-middle and middle 
sociodemographic index had the highest age standardised incidence rate and age 
standardised DALY rate in 2019, whereas countries with a low sociodemographic 
index had the lowest age standardised incidence rate but the highest age 
standardised mortality rate. Women generally had higher mortality and DALY rates 
than men at ages <30 years, but differences between the sexes were reversed in 
those aged >30 years except in countries with a low sociodemographic index. The 
main attributable risk factor for DALY for early onset type 2 diabetes was high 
body mass index in all regions by sociodemographic index. The proportional 
contribution of other risk factors varied across regions, however, with higher 
proportions of ambient particulate air pollution and smoking in countries with a 
high sociodemographic index and higher proportions of household air pollution 
from solid fuels and diet low in fruit in countries with a low sociodemographic 
index.
CONCLUSIONS: Early onset type 2 diabetes is a growing global health problem in 
adolescents and young adults, especially in countries with a low-middle and 
middle sociodemographic index. A greater disease burden in women aged <30 years 
was found. Specific measures are needed in countries with different levels of 
socioeconomic development because of the variable attributable risk factors for 
type 2 diabetes in adolescents and young adults.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major cause of 
malignancy-related deaths worldwide, and its incidence is likely to increase in 
the future as life expectancy increases. Therefore, the management of elderly 
patients with HCC has become a global issue. Aim of this study was to assess 
whether elderly patients with small HCC could obtain survival benefit from 
cryoablation (CRYO) in a real-world.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July 2007 to June 2013, 185 patients with small HCC 
who underwent curative-intent percutaneous CRYO. All patients were divided into 
three groups according to age distribution. Overall survival (OS) and tumor-free 
survival (TFS) were compared between among of groups before and after the 1:1 
propensity score matching, respectively. Univariate and multivariate Cox 
analyses were performed to determine the potential relationships between 
variables and prognostic outcomes.
RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-five patients (144 men, 41 women) received CRYO 
for small HCC, including 59 patients with age <50 years, 105 patients with age 
between 50 and 65 years, and 21 patients with age >65 years. The three age 
groups showed significant differences in the terms of underlying chronic liver 
disease and the number of patients with minor postoperative complications. After 
propensity score matching, the younger and elderly groups showed significant 
differences in mean OS (P=0.008) and tumor progression (P=0.050). However, no 
significant differences were shown in mean progression-free survival (PFS) 
(P=0.303). The Cox multivariate analysis showed that the Child-Pugh grade 
(HR=3.1, P<0.001), albumin (HR=0.85, P=0.004) and total of bilirubin (HR=1, 
P=0.024) were the independent prognostic factor for mean OS.
CONCLUSION: Our propensity-score-matched study suggested that elderly patients 
with small HCC can achieve acceptable prognostic outcomes with PFS similar to 
those of younger patients with small HCC after treatment with CRYO, while 
Child-Pugh grade, bilirubin and serum albumin levels were associated with the 
prognosis of small HCCs.

The 2008 economic crisis, also called the Great Recession, produced only a 
moderate rise in unemployment in Italy, but the consequences for public debt 
management were far more serious. Italy makes for a good case study for 
evaluating the effect on life expectancy at birth of the cost containment 
program in the health care system, implemented after the crisis began. To this 
end we employed the Artificial Control method using the data from the Human 
Mortality Database to assess the causal effect of the 2008 economic crisis on 
the subsequent evolution of life expectancy at birth (until 2019, before the 
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic). Our analysis identifies a significant 
deceleration in the progression of Italian life expectancy. Ten years after the 
onset of the crisis, Italy appears to have lost almost 1 year of life expectancy 
with respect to what would have been expected had the crisis never happened.

Background: The US population includes 24 million to 29 million people with 
diagnosed and undiagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Studies 
have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of single-inhaler triple therapy 
(SITT) in reducing COPD exacerbations. Long-term population implications of SITT 
use have not been quantified. Objectives: This simulation-based projection aimed 
to estimate the potential impact of widespread SITT use on the US COPD 
population. Methods: Exacerbation and all-cause mortality reductions reported in 
the Efficacy and Safety of Triple Therapy in Obstructive Lung Disease trial 
(ETHOS; NCT02465567) were used to project clinical outcomes in US patients 
meeting ETHOS trial eligibility criteria (ETHOS-Eligible) and patients meeting a 
practical definition of SITT eligibility (Expanded ETHOS-Eligible). The US COPD 
population was modeled with 1000 simulations of patient progression over 10 
years. Agent characteristics were based on literature and claims analysis of the 
2016-2018 Medicare 100% fee-for-service and IBM MarketScan® databases. Agent 
annual characteristics reflected incident cases, changes in COPD severity, 
treatment, mortality, and exacerbations under status quo treatment patterns and 
scenarios for the adoption of SITT. The scenarios assumed the reduced 
exacerbation and mortality rates associated with SITT according to ETHOS trial 
outcomes mean values. Results: Higher than current SITT adoption over 10 years 
would be expected to substantially reduce COPD exacerbation-associated 
hospitalizations by 2 million. Applying mean improvements reported in ETHOS for 
SITT would extend average patient life expectancy 2.2 years for ETHOS-Eligible 
patients and 1.7 years for Expanded ETHOS-Eligible patients. The number needed 
to treat to extend the average patient life by 1 year was 8 for the 
ETHOS-Eligible population and 10 for the Expanded ETHOS-Eligible population. 
Discussion: Widespread SITT adoption may be impeded by competitive pressures 
from generic treatments and nonadherence, and efficacy observed in clinical 
trials may not occur in real-world populations. Conclusions: Assuming ETHOS 
treatment effects and adherence translate to clinical practice, higher than 
current use of SITT can substantially reduce COPD exacerbations and 
hospitalizations and extend survival. These results should be viewed cautiously, 
because the improved outcomes for SITT in the ETHOS final retrieved vital 
statistics data were not statistically significant for all comparator therapy 
groups.

Medicinal plants are natural sources to unravel novel bioactive compounds to 
satisfy human pharmacological potentials. The world's demand for herbal 
medicines is increasing year by year; however, large-scale production of 
medicinal plants and their derivatives is still limited. The rapid development 
of modern technology has stimulated multi-omics research in medicinal plants, 
leading to a series of breakthroughs on key genes, metabolites, enzymes involved 
in biosynthesis and regulation of active compounds. Here, we summarize the 
latest research progress on the molecular intricacy of medicinal plants, 
including the comparison of genomics to demonstrate variation and evolution 
among species, the application of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics 
to explore dynamic changes of molecular compounds, and the utilization of 
potential resources for natural drug discovery. These multi-omics research 
provide the theoretical basis for environmental adaptation of medicinal plants 
and allow us to understand the chemical diversity and composition of bioactive 
compounds. Many medicinal herbs' phytochemical constituents and their potential 
health benefits are not fully explored. Given their large diversity and global 
distribution as well as the impacts of growth duration and environmental factors 
on bioactive phytochemicals in medicinal plants, it is crucial to emphasize the 
research needs of using multi-omics technologies to address basic and applied 
problems in medicinal plants to aid in developing new and improved medicinal 
plant resources and discovering novel medicinal ingredients.

OBJECTIVE: The requirement of a chronic treatment and the increase in life 
expectancy in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) leads to the possibility of 
caregiver burden. The aim of our study was to evaluate the burden in primary 
informal caregivers (PIC) of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and 
its association with depression, family dysfunction, and glycemic control.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in PIC of children 
and adolescents with T1D. Zarit Burden Interview Scale (ZBIS) was used to 
evaluate caregiver burden. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) was used to 
evaluate depression in PIC, and the Family APGAR questionnaire was used to 
evaluate the family functionality.
RESULTS: A total of 100 PIC of children and adolescents with T1D were included. 
Caregiver burden was found in 33% of caregivers. The total score of the Zarit 
scale was 41 (34-49); 19% had mild caregiver burden, and 14% had severe 
caregiver burden. According to the BDI-II, 82% had minimal depression, 11% mild 
depression, 5% moderate depression, and 2% severe depression. Family function 
was good in 69%; 13% had moderate dysfunction, and 18% had severe dysfunction. A 
positive correlation between caregiver burden and BDI-II score (r = 0.84; p = 
0.001) and the grade of depression (r = 0.87; p = 0.001) was found. A logistic 
regression model showed that BDI-II score was associated with caregiver burden 
(OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.061-1.23; p = 0.001). A BDI-II cut off of 9 or more had a 
sensibility and specificity of 58% and 28%, respectively, for caregiver burden 
[AUC 0.751 (0.64-0.85); p = 0.001]. A BDI-II score ≥9 was a predictor of 
caregiver burden (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.4-8.1; p = 0.008).
CONCLUSION: Caregiver burden is present in more than one third of the PIC of 
patients with T1D and is associated with depression. A BDI-II score ≥9 is a 
predictor of caregiver burden which may be a point to take into account in the 
integral approach to the patient with T1D and his or her family nucleus.
