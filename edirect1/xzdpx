IMPORTANCE: In the US, live donor (LD) kidney transplant rates have decreased in 
pediatric recipients. Pediatric patients with kidney failure will likely need 
more than 1 kidney transplant during their lifetime, but the optimal sequence of 
transplant (ie, deceased donor [DD] followed by LD or vice versa) is not known.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pediatric recipients should first receive a DD 
allograft followed by an LD allograft (DD-LD sequence) or an LD allograft 
followed by a DD allograft (LD-DD sequence).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytical model examined US 
pediatric patients with kidney failure included in the US Renal Data System 2019 
Report who were waiting for a kidney transplant, received a transplant, or 
experienced graft failure.
INTERVENTIONS: Kidney transplant sequences of LD-DD vs DD-LD.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Difference in projected life-years between the 2 
sequence options.
RESULTS: Among patients included in the analysis, the LD-DD sequence provided 
more net life-years in those 5 years of age (1.82 [95% CI, 0.87-2.77]) and 20 
years of age (2.23 [95% CI, 1.31-3.15]) compared with the DD-LD sequence. The 
net outcomes in patients 10 years of age (0.36 [95% CI, -0.51 to 1.23] 
additional life-years) and 15 years of age (0.64 [95% CI, -0.15 to 1.39] 
additional life-years) were not significantly different. However, for those aged 
10 years, an LD-DD sequence was favored if eligibility for a second transplant 
was low (2.09 [95% CI, 1.20-2.98] additional life-years) or if the LD was no 
longer available (2.32 [95% CI, 1.52-3.12] additional life-years). For those 
aged 15 years, the LD-DD sequence was favored if the eligibility for a second 
transplant was low (1.84 [95% CI, 0.96-2.72] additional life-years) or if the LD 
was no longer available (2.49 [95% CI, 1.77-3.27] additional life-years). Access 
to multiple DD transplants did not compensate for missing the LD opportunity.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that the decreased use of LD 
kidney transplants in pediatric recipients during the past 2 decades should be 
scrutinized. Given the uncertainty of future recipient eligibility for 
retransplant and future availability of an LD transplant, the LD-DD sequence is 
likely the better option. This strategy of an LD transplant first would not only 
benefit pediatric recipients but allow DD kidneys to be used by others who do 
not have an LD option.

389. End-stage Renal Disease in the Medicare Population: Frequency and Duration
of  Hemodialysis and Quality of Life Assessment [Internet].

AHRQ Technology Assessments.

OBJECTIVE: To study effects of more frequent or longer hemodialysis on clinical 
outcomes, quality of life (QOL), and symptoms in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
patients.
DATA SOURCES: We searched through October 21, 2019 for studies in PubMed, 
Embase®, and other sources.
METHODS: We focused on studies assessing the frequency or duration of 
hemodialysis using a comparison group and at least 6 months of followup. We 
defined usual care as hemodialysis three times per week with less than 4 hours 
per treatment, more frequent hemodialysis as four or more treatments per week, 
and longer hemodialysis as 4 or more hours per treatment. We considered study 
limitations, directness, consistency, and precision to grade strength of 
evidence (SOE). We included studies assessing QOL in ESRD patients receiving 
dialysis and evaluated QOL tools using the COnsensus-based Standards for 
selection of health status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN).
RESULTS: We found 17 studies (3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one 
non-randomized trial, and 13 observational studies) reported in 39 articles that 
addressed the impacts of increased frequency or duration of hemodialysis. 
Compared to the U.S. hemodialysis population, study populations were younger, 
healthier, and had a longer life expectancy. The SOE was low that more frequent 
hemodialysis compared to usual care: lowered mortality, the composite outcome of 
risk of death or increase in left ventricular (LV) mass, and risk of death or 
decrease in physical health; lowered LV mass and heart rate variability; and 
improved quality of life and patient reported symptom measures, blood pressure, 
and metabolic measures. The SOE was low that more frequent and longer 
hemodialysis compared to usual hemodialysis: improved blood pressure; and 
shortened time to recovery after hemodialysis; The SOE was low that vascular 
access complications were more frequent with either more frequent or more 
frequent and longer hemodialysis, compared to usual care. We identified 125 QOL 
or symptom measure tools used in 165 studies. Ten tools were designed for use 
in, and validated in dialysis populations. Six tools were not designed for 
dialysis populations but were validated in that population. COSMIN assessments 
were good in four or more domains for the Kidney Disease Quality of Life 
instrument, and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory.
CONCLUSIONS: More frequent in-center hemodialysis may improve clinical outcomes, 
mortality, and quality of life or patient-reported symptom measures. The trial 
populations were younger, healthier, and had a longer life-expectancy than the 
broader U.S. dialysis population, limiting applicability to patients with 
similar characteristics. Further research may increase our confidence in the 
findings.

The development of synthetic nonequilibrium systems has gathered increasing 
attention due to their potential to illustrate the dynamic, complex, and 
emergent traits of biological systems. Simple building blocks capable of 
interacting via dynamic covalent chemistry and physical assembly in a reaction 
network under nonequilibrium conditions can contribute to our understanding of 
complex systems of life and its origin. Herein, we have demonstrated the 
nonequilibrium generation of catalytic supramolecular assemblies from simple 
heterocycle melamine driven by a thermodynamically activated ester. Utilizing a 
reversible covalent linkage, an imidazole moiety was recruited by the assemblies 
to access a catalytic transient state that dissipated energy via accelerated 
hydrolysis of the activated ester. The nonequilibrium assemblies were further 
capable of temporally binding to a hydrophobic guest to modulate its 
photophysical properties. Notably, the presence of an exogenous aromatic base 
augmented the lifetime of the catalytic microphases, reflecting their higher 
kinetic stability.

BACKGROUND: Women with breast pain constitute >20% of breast clinic attendees.
AIM: To investigate breast cancer incidence in women presenting with breast pain 
and establish the health economics of referring women with breast pain to 
secondary care.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective cohort study of all consecutive women referred 
to a breast diagnostic clinic over 12 months.
METHOD: Women were categorised by presentation into four distinct clinical 
groups and cancer incidence investigated.
RESULTS: Of 10 830 women, 1972 (18%) were referred with breast pain, 6708 (62%) 
with lumps, 480 (4%) with nipple symptoms, 1670 (15%) with 'other' symptoms. 
Mammography, performed in 1112 women with breast pain, identified cancer in 
eight (0.7%). Of the 1972 women with breast pain, breast cancer incidence was 
0.4% compared with ∼5% in each of the three other clinical groups. Using 'breast 
lump' as reference, the odds ratio (OR) of women referred with breast pain 
having breast cancer was 0.05 (95% confidence interval = 0.02 to 0.09, P<0.001). 
Compared with reassurance in primary care, referral was more costly (net cost 
£262) without additional health benefits (net quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] 
loss -0.012). The greatest impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) was when QALY loss because of referral-associated anxiety was excluded. 
Primary care reassurance no longer dominated, but the ICER remained greater (£45 
528/QALY) than typical UK National Health Service cost-effectiveness thresholds.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that referring women with breast pain to a breast 
diagnostic clinic is an inefficient use of limited resources. Alternative 
management pathways could improve capacity and reduce financial burden.

OBJECTIVES: In an era when the average life expectancy and overall mortality 
rate have improved, Korea remains at risk for infectious disease outbreaks that 
place substantial burdens on the healthcare system. This study investigated 
trends in mortality and the economic burden of infectious diseases.
METHODS: Healthcare data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service 
(2009-2019) and the Korean Statistics Information Service (1997-2019) were used. 
We selected 10 infectious disease groups (intestinal infections, tuberculosis, 
vaccine- preventable diseases, sepsis, viral hepatitis, HIV-related diseases, 
central nervous system infections, rheumatic heart diseases, respiratory tract 
infections, and arthropod-borne viral diseases).
RESULTS: The age-standardized mortality rate for infectious diseases increased 
from 27.2 per 100,000 population in 1997 to 37.1 per 100,000 population in 2019 
and has had an upward trend since 2004. During this same period, significant 
increases were seen in respiratory tract infections and among elderly persons, 
especially those aged ≥85 years. The costs for infectious diseases increased 
from 4.126 billion US dollar (USD) in 2009 to 6.612 billion USD in 2019, with 
respiratory tract infections accounting for 3.699 billion USD (69%). The annual 
cost per patient for visits for medical care due to infectious diseases 
increased from 131 USD in 2009 to 204 USD in 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality among elderly persons and those with respiratory tract 
infections increased during the study period. The economic burden of infectious 
diseases has consistently increased, especially for respiratory tract 
infections. It is therefore essential to establish effective management policies 
that considers specific infectious diseases and patient groups.

Cervical dystonia (CD) is the most common adult-onset focal dystonia. Non-motor 
symptoms, such as insomnia, can greatly impact the quality of life in CD 
patients. CD can be treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus 
pallidus pars interna (GPi) although its effect on sleep is not yet fully 
understood. Here, we report a case of a 66-year-old female patient with cervical 
dystonia, who developed an unusual form of insomnia following her DBS surgery. 
Our patient reported recurrent episodes of visual symptoms (flashing lights), 
which would often wake her up at night. Following surgical revision of the 
extension wire, these visual symptoms completely resolved. This case provides an 
example of impedance oscillations caused by pressure on the pillow, which 
resulted in irregular delivery of current (according to Ohm's law) and 
recruitment of optic tract fibers secondary to excessive current.

OBJECTIVES: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
nivolumab-ipilimumab and pembrolizumab-axitinib as first-line treatments for 
metastatic, clear-cell, renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) based on results from 
CheckMate 214 and KEYNOTE-426. Our objective was to compare the adjusted, 
lifetime cost-effectiveness between nivolumab-ipilimumab, 
pembrolizumab-axitinib, and sunitinib for patients with mRCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3-state Markov model was developed comparing 
nivolumab-ipilimumab and pembrolizumab-axitinib to each other and sunitinib, 
over a 20-year lifetime horizon from a US medical center perspective. The 
clinical outcomes of nivolumab-ipilimumab and pembrolizumab-axitinib were 
compared using matching-adjusted indirect comparison. Costs of drug treatment, 
adverse events, and utilities associated with different health states and 
adverse events were determined using national sources and published literature. 
Our outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) using 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Nivolumab-ipilimumab was the most cost-effective option in the base 
case analysis with an ICER of $34,190/QALY compared with sunitinib, while the 
pembrolizumab-axitinib ICER was dominated by nivolumab-ipilimumab and was not 
cost-effective (ICER=$12,630,828/QALY) compared with sunitinib. The mean total 
costs per patient for the nivolumab-ipilimumab and pembrolizumab-axitinib arms 
were $284,683 and $457,769, respectively, compared with sunitinib at $241,656. 
QALY was longer for nivolumab-ipilimumab (3.23 QALY) than for adjusted 
pembrolizumab-axitinib (1.99 QALY), which was longer than sunitinib's (1.98 
QALY). These results were most sensitive to treatment cost in both groups, but 
plausible changes did not alter the conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: The base case scenario indicated that nivolumab-ipilimumab was the 
most cost-effective treatment option for mRCC compared with 
pembrolizumab-axitinib and sunitinib.

BACKGROUND: As antibiotic resistance creates a significant global health threat, 
we need not only to accelerate the development of novel antibiotics but also to 
develop better treatment strategies using existing drugs to improve their 
efficacy and prevent the selection of further resistance. We require new tools 
to rationally design dosing regimens from data collected in early phases of 
antibiotic and dosing development. Mathematical models such as mechanistic 
pharmacodynamic drug-target binding explain mechanistic details of how the given 
drug concentration affects its targeted bacteria. However, there are no 
available tools in the literature that allow non-quantitative scientists to 
develop computational models to simulate antibiotic-target binding and its 
effects on bacteria.
RESULTS: In this work, we have devised an extension of a mechanistic 
binding-kinetic model to incorporate clinical drug concentration data. Based on 
the extended model, we develop a novel and interactive web-based tool that 
allows non-quantitative scientists to create and visualize their own 
computational models of bacterial antibiotic target-binding based on their 
considered drugs and bacteria. We also demonstrate how Rifampicin affects 
bacterial populations of Tuberculosis bacteria using our vCOMBAT tool.
CONCLUSIONS: The vCOMBAT online tool is publicly available at 
https://combat-bacteria.org/ .

    Nutr J. 2022 Sep 29;21(1):61.

BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is one of the most common causes of 
mortality in industrialized countries despite regular therapeutic advances. 
Numerous factors influence mortality in CHF patients, including nutritional 
status. It is known that malnutrition is a risk factor for mortality, whereas 
obesity may play a protective role, a phenomenon dubbed the "obesity paradox". 
However, the effect of the obesity-malnutrition association on mortality has not 
been previously studied for CHF. Our aim was to study the effect of nutritional 
status on overall mortality in CHF patients.
METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter study was based on a French nationwide 
database (PMSI). We included all CHF patients aged ≥18 years admitted to all 
public and private hospitals between 2012 and 2016 and performed a survival 
analysis over 1 to 4 years of follow-up.
RESULTS: Malnutrition led to a significant decrease in life expectancy in CHF 
patients when compared with normal nutritional status (aHR=1.16 [1.14-1.18] at 
one year and aHR=1.04 [1.004-1.08] at four years), obese, and obese-malnutrition 
groups. In contrast, obesity led to a significant increase in life expectancy 
compared with normal nutritional status (aHR=0.75 [0.73-0.78] at one year and 
aHR=0.85 [0.81-0.90] at four years), malnutrition, and obese-malnutrition 
groups. The mortality rate was similar in patients presenting both malnutrition 
and obesity and patients with normal nutritional status.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the protective effect on mortality 
observed in obese CHF patients seems to be linked to fat massincrease. 
Furthermore, malnourished obese and normal nutritional status patients had 
similar mortality rates. Further studies should be conducted to confirm our 
results and to explore the physiopathological mechanisms behind these effects.

BACKGROUND: Patients with stage IV cancer often experience diminished quality of 
life and pain. Although palliative amputation (PA) can reduce pain, it is 
infrequently performed because of the morbidity associated with amputation and 
the limited life expectancy in this population. Here, we describe the 
indications for PA in patients with stage IV carcinoma or sarcoma and discuss 
their clinical courses and outcomes. We hypothesized that PA would be associated 
with reduced pain and improved quality of life in these patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of all patients who 
underwent major amputation (proximal to the ankle or wrist) for metastatic 
sarcoma or carcinoma from January 1995 to April 2021. We excluded patients who 
underwent amputation for indications other than palliation. Cox proportional 
hazards regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with 
survival after PA.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients underwent PA (11 for carcinoma, 15 for sarcoma). 
The most common indications for PA were pain (all patients) and fungating tumor 
(16 patients). PA was the initial surgery in 7 patients. Forequarter amputations 
were the most common procedure (6 patients). All patients reported reduced pain 
after PA, with the mean (±standard deviation) visual analog pain score (on a 
10-point scale) decreasing from 5.7 ± 2.9 preoperatively to 0.43 ± 1.3 
postoperatively (p < 0.001). The mean preoperative ECOG score was 1.9 ± 0.2 
compared with 1.3 ± 0.1 postoperatively (p < 0.001). Fourteen patients were 
fitted for prostheses (6 upper extremity, 8 lower extremity). Two patients had 
local recurrence, both within 6 months after PA. The mean survival time after PA 
was 13 ± 12 months, and mean follow-up was 28 ± 29 months. Mean survival time 
after PA was not significantly different between patients with sarcoma (11 ± 11 
months) versus carcinoma (15 ± 14 months) (p = 0.51). Adjuvant chemotherapy was 
positively associated with survival; no other factors were associated with 
survival.
CONCLUSIONS: PA was associated with significantly reduced pain in all patients 
with stage IV cancer. PA should be considered for those with intractable pain, 
fungating tumors, or symptoms that diminish quality of life.

Pharmaceuticals play a central role in medical care. Working for a 
pharmaceutical company that develops and provides pharmaceuticals is an 
extension of our responsibilities as medical doctors. For physicians with a 
desire to contribute to a wide range of medical care, public health, and 
society, working for a pharmaceutical company is one of the options to realize 
self-fulfillment and achieve their life goals.

The presence of hallucinations and delusions in patients with neurodegenerative 
disease correlates negatively with function, cognition, quality of life, and 
survival. When these patients still have insight, the treatment of mild 
hallucinations may reduce the risk of progression to more severe symptoms, 
specifically hallucinations without insight or delusions. On October 22, 2020, a 
multidisciplinary consensus panel comprising United States-based experts in 
geriatric psychiatry, geriatric medicine, family medicine, movement disorders, 
and neuropsychology was convened remotely to discuss best practices for using 
telemedicine to evaluate, diagnose, and treat psychosis in patients with 
neurodegenerative diseases. This review reflects the opinions and 
recommendations discussed at this meeting. Despite drawbacks, telemedicine can 
offer several advantages over in-person care, particularly for older adults, and 
may be a unique opportunity for care of patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms. 
While telemedicine may not be suitable for all patients, it allows the 
involvement of specialists from multiple geographic locations and the extension 
of care to homebound individuals. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases who 
are likely to become homebound as the disease advances may benefit greatly from 
telemedicine as a standard of care. Healthcare provided via telemedicine should 
be nothing less than what would be offered to the patient in person. 
Telemedicine may present some difficulties, including technological issues and 
inherent constraints of remote care, but with proper planning many problems 
could be diminished. Technical issues associated with telemedicine are 
inevitable but may be partially offset by providing clear directions ahead of 
any tele-visit to ensure connectivity and access to the videoconferencing 
platform. Alternative procedures to communicate should be established in the 
eventuality of technological issues. Using these strategies, telemedicine can 
serve as a valuable complement to traditional in-person practices for the 
diagnosis and management of hallucinations and delusions associated with 
Parkinson's disease psychosis or dementia-related psychosis.

Background: The efficacy of upper-limb Robot-assisted Therapy (ulRT) in stroke 
subjects is well-established. The robot-measured kinematic data can assess the 
biomechanical changes induced by ulRT and the progress of patient over time. 
However, literature on the analysis of pre-treatment kinematic parameters as 
predictive biomarkers of upper limb recovery is limited. Objective: The aim of 
this study was to calculate pre-treatment kinematic parameters from 
point-to-point reaching movements in different directions and to identify 
biomarkers of upper-limb motor recovery in subacute stroke subjects after ulRT. 
Methods: An observational retrospective study was conducted on 66 subacute 
stroke subjects who underwent ulRT with an end-effector robot. Kinematic 
parameters were calculated from the robot-measured trajectories during movements 
in different directions. A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was applied 
considering the post-treatment Upper Limb Motricity Index and the kinematic 
parameters (from demanding directions of movement) as dependent variables, and 
the pre-treatment kinematic parameters as independent variables. Results: A 
subset of kinematic parameters significantly predicted the motor impairment 
after ulRT: the accuracy in adduction and internal rotation movements of the 
shoulder was the major predictor of post-treatment Upper Limb Motricity Index. 
The post-treatment kinematic parameters of the most demanding directions of 
movement significantly depended on the ability to execute elbow 
flexion-extension and abduction and external rotation movements of the shoulder 
at baseline. Conclusions: The multidirectional analysis of robot-measured 
kinematic data predicts motor recovery in subacute stroke survivors and paves 
the way in identifying subjects who may benefit more from ulRT.

OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a threatening disease for African 
populations in the upcoming years because of the increase in their expectancy of 
life. Here, we investigated whether natural products from Chrysophyllum 
perpulchrum as catechin and two dimeric procyanidins (catechin + hexose) could 
prevent progression of oxidative stress and cognitive changes using an AD-like 
rat model induced by Aβ1-40 injection into the hippocampal CA1 subfield.
METHODOLOGY: Adult male Wistar rats were either microinjected with 1% ammonia as 
a vehicle (10 µL) or aggregated Aβ1-40 at 10 µg bilateral hippocampus. On the 
14th day of post-surgery, some Aβ rats were treated with melatonin (10 mg/kg 
i.p.) or with the Chrysophyllum perpulchrum extract (300 mg/kg p.o.), and some 
sham-operated rats received the extract alone. Cognitive abilities were tested 
with Y-maze, object recognition test and Morris Water Maze. Oxidative stress 
markers as well as the level of activated microglial cells were assayed in the 
brain.
RESULTS: Aβ rats exhibited significant deficits of recognition memory and 
spatial learning. This was associated with an increase of microglia Iba 1 
immunoreactivity as well as nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde and superoxide 
dismutase levels but not to the thiol content in the hippocampus, prefrontal 
cortex and septum of AD-like rats. The Chrysophyllum perpulchrum extract 
treatment mitigated Aβ-induced cognitive impairments and reversed microglia 
overactivation and subsequent generation of oxidative stress markers. 
Interestingly, the neuroprotective actions of the Chrysophyllum perpulchrum 
extract seem to be comparable to the control drug melatonin used albeit with 
some more beneficial effects.
CONCLUSION: These findings are preliminary and should be strengthened by more 
pharmacological studies of bioactive compounds of Chrysophyllum perpulchrum 
before being proposed as a promising drug against AD.

Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular autoimmune disease that results in skeletal 
muscle weakness that worsens after periods of activity and improves after rest. 
Myasthenia gravis means "grave (serious), muscle weakness." Although not 
completely curable, it can be managed well with a relatively high quality of 
life and expectancy. In myasthenia gravis, antibodies against the acetylcholine 
receptors at the neuromuscular junction interfere with regular muscular 
contraction. Although most commonly caused by antibodies to the acetylcholine 
receptor, antibodies against MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) protein can also 
weaken transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Muscle-specific tyrosine 
kinase myasthenia gravis (MuSK-Ab MG) is a rare subtype of myasthenia gravis 
with distinct pathogenesis and unique clinical features. Diagnosis can be 
challenging due to its atypical presentation as compared to seropositive 
myasthenia gravis. It responds inconsistently to steroids, but plasma exchange 
and immunosuppressive therapies have shown promising results. We report a case 
of a 49-year-old female who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. 
Our patient experienced progressive, undiagnosed MuSK-Ab MG for years without a 
diagnosis.

The Fontan operation was introduced in 1968. For congenital malformations, where 
biventricular repair is unsuitable, the Fontan procedure has provided a 
long-term palliation strategy with improved outcomes compared to the initially 
developed procedures. Despite these improvements, several complications merely 
due to a failing Fontan circulation, including myocardial dysfunction, 
arrhythmias, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, protein-losing 
enteropathy, hepatic dysfunction, plastic bronchitis, and thrombo-embolism, may 
occur, thereby limiting the life-expectancy in this patient cohort. This review 
provides an overview of the most common complications of Fontan circulation and 
the currently available treatment options.

Slovenia: Health System Review.

This analysis of the Slovene health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. Slovenia has a statutory health insurance 
system with a single public insurer, providing almost universal coverage for a 
broad benefits package, though some services require relatively high levels of 
co-insurance (called co-payments in Slovenia). To cover these costs, about 95% 
of the population liable for cost-sharing purchases complementary, voluntary 
health insurance. Health expenditure per capita and as a share of GDP has 
increased slightly, but still trails behind the EU average. Among statutory 
health insurance countries, Slovenia is rather unique in that it relies almost 
exclusively on payroll contributions to fund its system, making health sector 
revenues vulnerable to economic and labour market fluctuations, and population 
ageing. Important organizational changes are underway or have been implemented, 
especially in prevention, primary, emergency and long-term care. Access to 
services is generally good, given wide coverage of statutory health insurance. 
Further, Slovenia has some of the lowest rates of out-of-pocket and catastrophic 
spending in the EU, due to extensive uptake of complementary voluntary health 
insurance. Yet long waiting times for some services are a persistent issue. 
Though population health has improved in the last decades, health inequalities 
due to gender, social and economic determinants and geography remain an 
important challenge. There is variation in health care performance indicators, 
but Slovenia performs comparatively well for its level of health spending 
overall. As such, there is clear scope to improve health and efficiency, 
including balancing population needs when planning health service volumes. 
Recently, the Slovene health care system was overwhelmed by the demand for 
COVID-19-related care. The pandemicâs longer-term effects are still unknown, but 
it has significantly impacted on life expectancy in the short-term and resulted 
in delayed or forgone consultations and treatments for other health issues, and 
longer waiting times. Additional challenges, which are necessary to address to 
ensure long-term sustainability, strengthen resiliency and improve the capacity 
for service delivery and quality of care of the health system include: 1) health 
workforce planning; 2) outdated facilities; 3) health system performance 
assessment; and 4) implementation of current LTC reform.

BACKGROUND: Unraveling how new coronary arteries develop may provide critical 
information for establishing novel therapeutic approaches to treating ischemic 
cardiac diseases. There are 2 distinct coronary vascular populations derived 
from different origins in the developing heart. Understanding the formation of 
coronary arteries may provide insights into new ways of promoting coronary 
artery formation after myocardial infarction.
METHODS: To understand how intramyocardial coronary arteries are generated to 
connect these 2 coronary vascular populations, we combined genetic lineage 
tracing, light sheet microscopy, fluorescence micro-optical sectioning 
tomography, and tissue-specific gene knockout approaches to understand their 
cellular and molecular mechanisms.
RESULTS: We show that a subset of intramyocardial coronary arteries form by 
angiogenic extension of endocardium-derived vascular tunnels in the neonatal 
heart. Three-dimensional whole-mount fluorescence imaging showed that these 
endocardium-derived vascular tunnels or tubes adopt an arterial fate in 
neonates. Mechanistically, we implicate Mettl3 (methyltransferase-like protein 
3) and Notch signaling in regulating endocardium-derived intramyocardial 
coronary artery formation. Functionally, these intramyocardial arteries persist 
into adulthood and play a protective role after myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSIONS: A subset of intramyocardial coronary arteries form by extension of 
endocardium-derived vascular tunnels in the neonatal heart.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a leading cause of mortality globally and 
accounts for significant health resource expenditure. Increased physical 
activity can reduce the risk of diabetes. However, the longer-term clinical 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions in those 
at high risk of type 2 diabetes is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether or not Walking Away from Diabetes (Walking 
Away) - a low-resource, 3-hour group-based behavioural intervention designed to 
promote physical activity through pedometer use in those with prediabetes - 
leads to sustained increases in physical activity when delivered with and 
without an integrated mobile health intervention compared with control.
DESIGN: Three-arm, parallel-group, pragmatic, superiority randomised controlled 
trial with follow-up conducted at 12 and 48 months.
SETTING: Primary care and the community.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults whose primary care record included a prediabetic blood 
glucose measurement recorded within the past 5 years [HbA1c ≥ 42 mmol/mol 
(6.0%), < 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) mmol/mol; fasting glucose ≥ 5.5 mmol/l, 
< 7.0 mmol/l; or 2-hour post-challenge glucose ≥ 7.8 mmol/l, < 11.1 mmol/l] were 
recruited between December 2013 and February 2015. Data collection was completed 
in July 2019.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised (1 : 1 : 1) using a web-based tool 
to (1) control (information leaflet), (2) Walking Away with annual group-based 
support or (3) Walking Away Plus (comprising Walking Away, annual group-based 
support and a mobile health intervention that provided automated, individually 
tailored text messages to prompt pedometer use and goal-setting and provide 
feedback, in addition to biannual telephone calls). Participants and data
