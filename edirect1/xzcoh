BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are leading causes of premature 
disability and death worldwide. However, the lifetime risk of developing any NCD 
is unknown, as are the effects of shared common risk factors on this risk.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between July 6, 1989, and January 1, 2012, we followed 
participants from the prospective Rotterdam Study aged 45 years and older who 
were free from NCDs at baseline for incident stroke, heart disease, diabetes, 
chronic respiratory disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. We 
quantified occurrence/co-occurrence and remaining lifetime risk of any NCD in a 
competing risk framework. We additionally studied the lifetime risk of any NCD, 
age at onset, and overall life expectancy for strata of 3 shared risk factors at 
baseline: smoking, hypertension, and overweight. During 75,354 person-years of 
follow-up from a total of 9,061 participants (mean age 63.9 years, 60.1% women), 
814 participants were diagnosed with stroke, 1,571 with heart disease, 625 with 
diabetes, 1,004 with chronic respiratory disease, 1,538 with cancer, and 1,065 
with neurodegenerative disease. NCDs tended to co-occur substantially, with 
1,563 participants (33.7% of those who developed any NCD) diagnosed with 
multiple diseases during follow-up. The lifetime risk of any NCD from the age of 
45 years onwards was 94.0% (95% CI 92.9%-95.1%) for men and 92.8% (95% CI 
91.8%-93.8%) for women. These risks remained high (>90.0%) even for those 
without the 3 risk factors of smoking, hypertension, and overweight. Absence of 
smoking, hypertension, and overweight was associated with a 9.0-year delay (95% 
CI 6.3-11.6) in the age at onset of any NCD. Furthermore, the overall life 
expectancy for participants without these risk factors was 6.0 years (95% CI 
5.2-6.8) longer than for those with all 3 risk factors. Participants aged 45 
years and older without the 3 risk factors of smoking, hypertension, and 
overweight at baseline spent 21.6% of their remaining lifetime with 1 or more 
NCDs, compared to 31.8% of their remaining life for participants with all of 
these risk factors at baseline. This difference corresponds to a 2-year 
compression of morbidity of NCDs. Limitations of this study include potential 
residual confounding, unmeasured changes in risk factor profiles during 
follow-up, and potentially limited generalisability to different healthcare 
settings and populations not of European descent.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that in this western European community, 9 out 
of 10 individuals aged 45 years and older develop an NCD during their remaining 
lifetime. Among those individuals who develop an NCD, at least a third are 
subsequently diagnosed with multiple NCDs. Absence of 3 common shared risk 
factors is associated with compression of morbidity of NCDs. These findings 
underscore the importance of avoidance of these common shared risk factors to 
reduce the premature morbidity and mortality attributable to NCDs.

OBJECTIVE: Physical quality of life is reduced in ANCA-associated vasculitis 
(AAV). This study aims to investigate whether this may be explained by reduced 
muscle strength and physical activity resulting from disease damage and steroid 
myopathy.
METHODS: Forty-eight AAV patients were sequentially included from the outpatient 
clinic. Patients in different stages of disease and treatment underwent 
measurements of muscle strength and anthropometric parameters. Patients filled 
in physical activity (Baecke) and quality of life questionnaires (RAND-36) and 
carried an accelerometer for a week. Muscle strength and physical activity were 
compared to quality of life, prednisolone use and disease duration.
RESULTS: Most AAV patients had lower knee extension (76%) and elbow flexion 
(67%) forces than expected based on healthy norms. Also, physical (P<0.001) and 
mental (P = 0.01) quality of life were significantly reduced compared to healthy 
norm values. Lower knee extension force (P = 0.009), younger age <70 (P<0.001) 
and relapse of vasculitis (P = 0.003) were associated with lower age-adjusted 
physical quality of life. Lower Baecke index (P = 0.006), higher prednisolone 
dose (P = 0.005) and ENT involvement (P = 0.006) were associated with lower 
age-adjusted mental quality of life. Leg muscle strength showed no association 
with current or cumulative prednisolone use. Disease duration was longer in 
patients with knee extension force below healthy norms (P = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: Knee extension force and physical activity are positively associated 
with quality of life in AAV. Knee extension force decreases with longer disease 
duration, suggesting that disease- and treatment-related damage have a 
cumulative negative effect on muscle strength.

INTRODUCTION: This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the safety and 
feasibility of the new Senhance Robotic System (TransEnterix Inc., Morrisville, 
North Carolina) for inguinal hernia repairs using the transabdominal 
preperitoneal approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March to September 2017, 76 inguinal hernia repairs 
in 64 patients were performed using the Senhance Robotic System. Patients were 
between 18 and 90 years of age, eligible for a laparoscopic procedure with 
general anesthesia, had no life-threatening disease with a life expectancy of 
less than 12 months, and a body mass index (BMI) < 35. A retrospective chart 
review was performed for a variety of pre-, peri-, and postoperative data 
including, but not limited to, patient demographics, hernia characteristics, and 
intraoperative and postoperative complications.
RESULTS: Fifty-four male and 10 female patients were included in the study. 
Median age was 56.5 years (range 22-86 years), and median BMI was 25.9 kg/m2 
(range 19.5-31.8 kg/m2). Median docking time was seven minutes (range 2-21 
minutes), and median operative time was 48 minutes (range 18-142 minutes). Two 
cases were converted to standard laparoscopic surgery due to robot malfunction 
and abdominal wall bleeding, respectively. Median length of stay was one day.
CONCLUSION: We report the first series of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs 
using the new Senhance Robotic System. Compared to conventional laparoscopic 
transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) hernia repairs, there was no significant 
difference in operative time or perioperative complications. Additionally, there 
was no significant learning curve detected due to its intuitive applicability. 
Therefore, the Senhance Robotic System promises broad applicability across a 
range of laparoscopic general surgical operations.

BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a 
resource-intensive tool that provides haemodynamic and respiratory support in 
patients who have suffered cardiac arrest. In this study, we investigated the 
cost-utility of ECPR (cost/QALY) in cardiac arrest patients treated at our 
institution.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients who received ECPR 
following cardiac arrest between 2012 and 2018. All medical care-associated 
charges with ECPR and subsequent hospital admission were recorded. The 
quality-of-life of survivors was assessed with the Health Utilities Index Mark 
II. The cost-utility of ECPR was calculated with cost and quality-of-life data.
RESULTS: ECPR was used in 32 patients (15/32 in-hospital, 47%) with a median age 
of 55.0 years (IQR 46.3-63.3 years), 59% male and 66% African American. The 
median duration of ECPR support was 2.1 days (IQR 0.9-3.8 days). Survival to 
hospital discharge was 16%. The median score of the Health Utilities Index Mark 
II at discharge for the survivors was 0.44 (IQR 0.32-0.52). The median operating 
cost for patients undergoing ECMO was $125,683 per patient (IQR $49,751-$206,341 
per patient). The calculated cost-utility for ECPR was $56,156/QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The calculated cost-utility is within the threshold considered 
cost-effective in the United States (<$150,000/QALY gained). These results are 
comparable to the cost-effectiveness of heart transplantation for end-stage 
heart failure. Larger studies are needed to assess the cost-utility of ECPR and 
to identify whether other factors, such as patient characteristics, affect the 
cost-utility benefit.

OBJECTIVE: Spinal metastases represent the most common site of bony metastases 
and frequently reduce quality of life. A beneficial effect of surgery and 
radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone has been demonstrated in symptomatic 
patients. The goal of our study was to perform a cost-utility analysis of 
surgery for spinal metastases based on patient-level costs and health status 
data in a specialist spine center in Belgium.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed in a prospective cohort of 
patients undergoing surgery for symptomatic spinal metastases in 2011-2015. 
EQ-5D-3L measure of health-related quality of life data were collected 
preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Hospital costs relating to 
surgical management including postoperative radiotherapy were analyzed. A 
retrospective cohort of patients treated with radiotherapy alone between 2011 
and 2015, which matched the surgical patients for disease load and presentation, 
also was assessed. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for nonsurgical patients 
were modelled against the surgical group.
RESULTS: In total, 38 consecutive surgical patients had information for 
cost-utility analysis and 8 nonsurgical patients were matched. Mean total cost 
in the surgical group was €16,989 (SD €8148), largely comprising nonmedical 
staffing cost (mean €7721, 45.9%), followed by daily operational costs (€2963, 
17.6%) and medical staffing costs (€2621, 15.6%). Median initial health status 
was 0.33 (interquartile range 0.15-0.55), and median postoperative QALYs were 
0.70 (interquartile range 0.18-1.70). Mean total cost in the nonsurgical cohort 
was €9354. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for surgical management was 
€13,635 (range €12,726-€14,407) per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery for symptomatic spinal metastases in a specialist hospital 
in Belgium is cost-effective.

The study estimates the annual costs of nontyphoidal Salmonellosis (referred to 
as Salmonellosis from hereon) from fresh produce, poultry and eggs in Canada. It 
also estimates the economic benefits from introduction of Whole Genome 
Sequencing (WGS) in detection of Salmonellosis clusters and outbreaks. Monetary 
and non-monetary costs from Salmonellosis are estimated. Monetary costs are 
divided into direct healthcare, indirect, federal and producer costs. 
Probability models are used to account for uncertainty in the cost-of-illness 
estimates. Two types of non-monetary costs have been estimated: 
Disability-adjusted Live Years and Quality-adjusted Life Years. These estimates 
are then used to calculate the economic impact of WGS on detection of 
Salmonellosis. The estimated incidence of illnesses is 47,082 annually, which 
represents a cost of $287.78 million (total cases) and $166.28 million (reported 
cases) from the traditional technology. The total net benefit from introduction 
of WGS is estimated to range from $5.21 million-$90.25 million. All monetary 
values are in CAD unless stated otherwise. WGS will help in reducing the 
economic burden from Salmonellosis. These estimates help will aid policy related 
decision making.

OBJECTIVEMany options exist for the surgical management of adult spinal 
deformity. Radiculopathy and lumbosacral pain from the fractional curve (FC), 
typically from L4 to S1, is frequently a reason for scoliosis patients to pursue 
surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of 
limited fusion of the FC only versus treatment of the entire deformity with long 
fusions.METHODSAll adult scoliosis patients treated at the authors' institution 
in the period from 2006 to 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with FCs 
from L4 to S1 > 10° and radiculopathy ipsilateral to the concavity of the FC 
were eligible for study inclusion and had undergone three categories of surgery: 
1) FC only (FC group), 2) lower thoracic to sacrum (LT group), or 3) upper 
thoracic to sacrum (UT group). Primary outcomes were the rates of revision 
surgery and complications. Secondary outcomes were estimated blood loss, length 
of hospital stay, and discharge destination. Spinopelvic parameters were 
measured, and patients were stratified accordingly.RESULTSOf the 99 patients 
eligible for inclusion in the study, 27 were in the FC group, 46 in the LT 
group, and 26 in the UT group. There were no significant preoperative 
differences in age, sex, smoking status, prior operation, FC magnitude, pelvic 
tilt (PT), sagittal vertical axis (SVA), coronal balance, pelvic 
incidence-lumbar lordosis (PI-LL) mismatch, or proportion of well-aligned spines 
(SVA < 5 cm, PI-LL mismatch < 10°, and PT < 20°) among the three treatment 
groups. Mean follow-up was 30 (range 12-112) months, with a minimum 1-year 
follow-up. The FC group had a lower medical complication rate (22% [FC] vs 57% 
[LT] vs 58% [UT], p = 0.009) but a higher rate of extension surgery (26% [FC] vs 
13% [LT] vs 4% [UT], p = 0.068). The respective average estimated blood loss 
(592 vs 1950 vs 2634 ml, p < 0.001), length of hospital stay (5.5 vs 8.3 vs 8.3 
days, p < 0.001), and rate of discharge to acute rehabilitation (30% vs 46% vs 
85%, p < 0.001) were all lower for FC and highest for UT.CONCLUSIONSTreatment of 
the FC only is associated with a lower complication rate, shorter hospital stay, 
and less blood loss than complete scoliosis treatment. However, there is a 
higher associated rate of extension of the construct to the lower or upper 
thoracic levels, and patients should be counseled when considering their 
options.

Currently, surface electromyography (sEMG) features of the forearm multi-tendon 
muscles are widely used in gesture recognition, however, there are few 
investigations on the inherent physiological mechanism of muscle synergies. We 
aimed to study whether the muscle synergies could be used for gesture 
recognition. Five healthy participants executed five gestures of daily life 
(pinch, fist, open hand, grip, and extension) and the sEMG activity was acquired 
from six forearm muscles. A non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm 
was employed to decompose the pre-treated six-channel sEMG data to obtain the 
muscle synergy matrixes, in which the weights of each muscle channel determined 
the feature set for hand gesture classification. The results showed that the 
synergistic features of forearm muscles could be successfully clustered in the 
feature space, which enabled hand gestures to be recognized with high 
efficiency. By augmenting the number of participants, the mean recognition rate 
remained at more than 96% and reflected high robustness. We showed that muscle 
synergies can be well applied to gesture recognition.

A better understanding of what drives behaviour change in obese pregnant 
overweight women is needed to improve the effectiveness of lifestyle 
interventions in this group at risk for gestational diabetes (GDM). Therefore, 
we assessed which factors mediated behaviour change in the Vitamin D and 
Lifestyle Intervention for GDM Prevention (DALI) Lifestyle Study. A total of 436 
women, with pre-pregnancy body mass index ≥29 kg/m², ≤19 + 6 weeks of gestation 
and without GDM, were randomised for counselling based on motivational 
interviewing (MI) on healthy eating and physical activity, healthy eating alone, 
physical activity alone, or to a usual care group. Lifestyle was measured at 
baseline, and at 24⁻28 and 35⁻37 weeks of gestation. Outcome expectancy, risk 
perception, task self-efficacy and social support were measured at those same 
time points and considered as possible mediators of intervention effects on 
lifestyle. All three interventions resulted in increased positive outcome 
expectancy for GDM reduction, perceived risk to the baby and increased task 
self-efficacy. The latter mediated intervention effects on physical activity and 
reduced sugared drink consumption. In conclusion, our MI intervention was 
successful in increasing task self-efficacy, which was related to improved 
health behaviours.

Currently, we are facing increasing demand to develop efficient systems for the 
detection and treatment of diseases that can realistically improve distinct 
aspects of healthcare in our society. Sensitive nanomaterials that respond to 
environmental stimuli can play an important role in this task. In this 
manuscript, we review the clinical trials carried out to date on thermosensitive 
nanomaterials, including all those clinical trials in hybrid nanomaterials that 
respond to other stimuli (e.g., magnetic, infrared radiation, and ultrasound). 
Specifically, we discuss their use in diagnosis and treatment of different 
diseases. At present, none of the existing trials focused on diagnosis take 
advantage of the thermosensitive characteristics of these nanoparticles. Indeed, 
almost all clinical trials consulted explore the use of Ferumoxytol as a current 
imaging test enhancer. However, the thermal property is being further exploited 
in the field of disease treatment, especially for the delivery of antitumor 
drugs. In this regard, ThermoDox®, based on lysolipid thermally sensitive 
liposome technology to encapsulate doxorubicin (DOX), is the flagship drug. In 
this review, we have evidenced the discrepancy existing between the number of 
published papers in thermosensitive nanomaterials and their clinical use, which 
could be due to the relative novelty of this area of research; more time is 
needed to validate it through clinical trials. We have no doubt that in the 
coming years there will be an explosion of clinical trials related to 
thermosensitive nanomaterials that will surely help to improve current 
treatments and, above all, will impact on patients' quality of life and life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Strong evidence shows that physical inactivity increases the risk of 
many adverse health conditions, including major non-communicable diseases, such 
as cardiovascular disease (CVD), metabolic syndrome, and breast and colon 
cancers, and shortens life expectancy. We aimed to determine the effects of 
moderate (MCT)- versus high-intensity interval training (HIT) on vascular 
function parameters in physically inactive adults. We hypothesized that 
individualized HIT prescription would improve the vascular function parameters 
more than the MCT in a greater proportion of individuals.
METHODS: Twenty-one inactive adults were randomly allocated to receive either 
MCT group (60-75% of their heart rate reserve, [HRR] or HIT group (4 min at 
85-95% of peak HRR), 3 days a week for 12 weeks. Vascular function (brachial 
artery flow-mediated dilation, FMD [%], normalized brachial artery flow-mediated 
dilation, FMDn [%], aortic pulse wave velocity, PWV [m·s- 1], AIx, augmentation 
index: aortic and brachial [%]), were measured at baseline and over 12 weeks of 
training. In order for a participant to be considered a responder to 
improvements in vascular function parameters (FMDn and PWV), the typical error 
was calculated in a favorable direction.
RESULTS: FMD changed by - 1.0% (SE 2.1, d = 0.388) in the MCT group, and + 1.8% 
(SE 1.8, d = 0.699) in the HIT group (no significant difference between groups: 
2.9% [95% CI, - 3.0 to 8.8]. PWV changed by + 0.1 m·s- 1 (SE 0.2, d = 0.087) in 
the MCT group but decreased by - 0.4 m·s- 1 in the HIT group (SE 0.2, 
d = 0.497), with significant difference between groups: - 0.4 [95% CI, - 0.2 to 
- 0.7]. There was not a significant difference in the prevalence of no-responder 
for FMD (%) between the MCT and HIT groups (66% versus 36%, P = 0.157). 
Regarding PWV (m·s- 1), an analysis showed that the prevalence of no-responder 
was 77% (7 cases) in the MCT group and 45% (5 cases) in the HIT group 
(P = 0.114).
CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of the present study, both groups experienced 
changed in vascular function parameters. Compared to MCT group, HIT is more 
efficacious for improving FMD and decreasing PWV, in physically inactive adults.

"Heart failure is a global pandemic that is becoming an increasingly common 
diagnosis due to aging of the population and increased longevity. Understanding 
the scope and costs of current heart failure management will lead to improved 
health economic decision making. Interventions to reduce spending in heart 
failure care have been centered on reduction of readmissions, improvement in 
transitions of care, and innovations in technology that have further improved 
quality of life. Technological advancements in outpatient monitoring offers the 
hope of further reducing morbidity, mortality, and cost in heart failure."

Primary Care, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.

PURPOSE: In 2017 almost 25,000 Belgians between 40 and 60 years (38% of new 
diagnoses) were diagnosed with cancer. With increasing life expectancy the 
chance augments that these patients still have older parents alive. This implies 
that oncology care should also take into account the impact cancer may have on 
(the relationship with) older parents. The purpose of this study was to explore 
how cancer patients communicate and deal with their older parents during the 
illness trajectory.
METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 cancer patients. 
Interview transcripts were analysed using the principles of the constructivist 
Grounded Theory Approach.
RESULTS: Depending on the situation, the time frame and the person the patients 
are talking about, cancer patients oscillate between perspectives (I, They and 
We). A common denominator in all three perspectives is silence fuelled by 
different forms of solicitude (self-protection and other-protection). This 
solicitude underpins the cancer patients' communicative behaviours and ways of 
relating towards their parents.
CONCLUSIONS: Present findings underline the importance of health care providers 
considering the often hidden complexity of giving information and talking about 
feelings. Nurses' strategies must be designed not to harm the existing mechanism 
of solicitude and the diligent management of the patients' relationship with 
their parents. Conversations about functionality of avoiding certain topics and 
the impetus behind certain communicative patterns should be put forward instead 
of consensually advising open communication.

OBJECTIVE: Advances in transcatheter aortic valve replacement have led to the 
consideration of tissue aortic valve replacement in younger patients. Part of 
this enthusiasm is the presumption that younger patients would have more 
flexibility in future treatment options, such as a primary surgical aortic valve 
replacement followed later by transcatheter aortic valve replacement(s) 
(valve-in-valve), vice versa, or other permutations. We created a 
microsimulation model using published longevity of tissue valves to predict the 
outcomes of patients after primary tissue surgical aortic valve replacement.
METHODS: The model calculated survival by incorporating annual mortality (Social 
Security Administration) and mortality from re-replacements (Society of Thoracic 
Surgeons) in patients with surgical aortic valve replacement. Freedom from 
reoperation for structural valve degeneration incorporated best published data 
to determine the annual risk of re-replacement for structural valve degeneration 
based on implant duration and stratified by patient age. A constant rate of 
re-replacement for nonstructural valve degeneration indications was also 
incorporated. Each simulation was performed for 50,000 individuals. Kaplan-Meier 
curves were generated to represent survival. All simulations were run within the 
MATLAB environment (The MathWorks, Inc, Natick, Mass).
RESULTS: Earlier decades of life at primary surgical aortic valve replacement 
were associated with higher incidences of re-replacements and especially 
multiple re-replacements. For those patients receiving a primary tissue surgical 
aortic valve replacement at age 50 years, 57.2% will require a second valve, 
18.0% will require a third valve, and 1.6% will require a fourth valve with 
average operative mortalities of 2.9%, 4.8%, and 7.3%, respectively. A 
50-year-old patient at primary surgical aortic valve replacement has a 13.1% 
chance of re-replacement before turning 60 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Microsimulation incorporates changing hazards to estimate the risk 
of aortic valve re-replacement in patients undergoing tissue surgical aortic 
valve replacement and may be a starting point for patient education and health 
care economic planning.

The triple wave epidemic: Supply and demand drivers of the US opioid overdose 
crisis.

Francisco, United States.

The US mortality rate has gone up three years in a row from 2014 to 2017 
(Murphy, Xu, Kochanek, & Arias, 2016, 2018; National Center for Health 
Statistics, 2017). Correspondingly, life expectancy at birth has declined; the 
first triple year decline since World War One and the devastating influenza 
pandemic one hundred years ago (Tejada Vera B, 2017). Most of the top ten causes 
of death are declining year over year; however, the third leading cause of 
death, unintentional injuries, has climbed in rate and rank since 2014 (Murphy 
et al., 2016). Driving this are deaths due to drug poisoning which exceeded 
70,000 in 2017 (Hedegaard H, 2018). Annual deaths due to drug overdoses now 
exceed those from motor vehicle deaths, gun violence and even HIV at the height 
of the 1990s HIV epidemic (J Katz, 2017).

[Para-sports for Muscular Dystrophy Patients].

[Article in Japanese]

Matsumura T(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Neurology, National Hospital Organization Toneyama National 
Hospital.

Patients with muscular dystrophy repeatedly experience loss of motor function 
and the ability to perform activities of daily living throughout the progression 
of their disease. These experiences can seriously decrease their self-esteem. 
Although multidisciplinary care has improved the life expectancy of these 
patients greatly, it can be hard for them to engage in social activities. 
Para-sports can bring about a sense of independence in such patients. They can 
join para-sports as players, because para-sports are modified or originally 
designed to adapt to their functional abilities. Such experiences can produce 
revolutionary and amazing effects for them. The benefits of para-sports include 
not only recreational pleasure but also a sense of accomplishment and 
opportunities for socialization. Participating in rulemaking to enable them to 
play games is an ideal chance for individuals to confront their own handicap and 
consider how to overcome it. Practicing and gaming with teammates produce 
opportunities for social interaction. Thus, para-sports has numerous merits for 
patients with muscular dystrophy. On the other hand, risk management is a 
mandatory requirement for para-sports, especially in patients with heart and 
respiratory failure. Unfortunately, most medical staff have paid little 
attention to para-sports and find it difficult to provide suitable advice. To 
encourage the continuous development of para-sports, communication between 
medical staff and para-sports associations is important.

Three theoretical models have been proposed to explain lifespan extension 
resulting from exposure to extreme conditions in microscopic animals: 
individuals become completely dormant and stop aging, continue to age or age but 
at a diminished rate. Here we show that the earliest life history stages, 
embryonic cell divisions, in the tardigrade species Hypsibius dujardini are 
retarded when eggs are reared at 0 °C. Compared to control specimens reared at 
22 °C, juveniles that hatched from eggs exposed to 0 °C for 4 days and returned 
to 22 °C experienced a three-day lag, indicating that their biological age was 
less than their chronological age. As cold exposure duration increased 
(days = 10, 20, 40), incubation period at 22 °C decreased incrementally 
(days = 3, 2, 1), suggesting that tardigrades involve a threshold-determined, 
quantum-like, energetic-based system for controlling embryogenesis.

To escape from hosts after completing their life cycle, bacteriophages often use 
endolysins, which degrade bacterial peptidoglycan. While mesophilic phages have 
been extensively studied, their thermophilic counterparts are not well 
characterized. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the structure and 
function of Ts2631 endolysin from thermophilic phage vB_Tsc2631, which is a 
zinc-dependent amidase. The active site of Ts2631 consists of His30, Tyr58, 
His131 and Cys139, which are involved in Zn2+ coordination and catalysis. We 
found that the active site residues are necessary for lysis yet not crucial for 
peptidoglycan binding. To elucidate residues involved in the enzyme interaction 
with peptidoglycan, we tested single-residue substitution variants and 
identified Tyr60 and Lys70 as essential residues. Moreover, substitution of 
Cys80, abrogating disulfide bridge formation, inactivates Ts2631, as do 
substitutions of His31, Thr32 and Asn85 residues. The endolysin contains a 
positively charged N-terminal extension of 20 residues that can protrude from 
the remainder of the enzyme and is crucial for peptidoglycan binding. We show 
that the deletion of 20 residues from the N-terminus abolished the bacteriolytic 
activity of the enzyme. Because Ts2631 exhibits intrinsic antibacterial activity 
and unusual thermal stability, it is perfectly suited as a scaffold for the 
development of antimicrobial agents.
