The increase in the population's life expectancy leads to an increase in the 
incidence of dementia and, therefore, in diseases such as Alzheimer's. Towards 
this direction, the HELIAD1 study is the first large-scale epidemiological study 
aimed at assessing epidemiological data on dementia, mild mental decline, and 
other neuropsychiatric disorders associated with old age. This is a huge study 
with several computational challenges, most of which can be addressed by machine 
learning processes. The objectives of this study were to detect patterns in the 
HELIAD clinical data that classify with high accuracy various levels of 
cognitive impairment by training ML algorithms and hence apply derived model on 
future clinical data to predict with the same accuracy the class variable. We 
propose a machine learning method based on RUSBoost classifier to identify a 
critical subset of biomarkers that classify accurately between neurological 
patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia of the Alzheimer's 
type (DAT) and the cognitively healthy control (CHC) group. In this study we 
used a highly skewed (imbalanced) dataset with most observations (majority 
class) belonging to the CHC group. The method proposed predicts accurately the 
clinical diagnosis label and effectively classifies the neurological patients 
from the CHC class. In particular, the classification accuracy (actual vs 
predicted) for the three classes of the clinical diagnosis was 97%, 78%, and 91% 
for control, MCI, and dementia class, respectively.

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease with a huge impact on 
people's quality of life, life expectancy, and morbidity. The ongoing prevalence 
of the disease, in conjunction with an increased financial burden to healthcare 
services, necessitates the development of new technologies to be employed in 
this field. Hence, advanced computational methods have been developed to 
facilitate early and accurate diagnosis of the disease and improve all health 
outcomes. Artificial intelligence is now deeply involved in the fight against 
this disease, with many clinical applications in the field of medical imaging. 
Deep learning approaches have been tested for use in this domain, while 
radiomics, an emerging quantitative method, are already being evaluated to be 
used in various medical imaging modalities. This chapter aims to provide an 
insight into the fundamental principles behind radiomics, discuss the most 
common techniques alongside their strengths and weaknesses, and suggest ways 
forward for future research standardization and reproducibility.

Fujian Province, China.

This study aimed to report trends in the global burden of osteoarthritis (OA) 
from 1990 to 2019 and predict the trends in the following years based on Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019. The study 
included reporting on the prevalence and incidence rates, as well as 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Additionally, the age-standardized 
incidence rate (ASR) and Estimated Annual Percent Change (EAPC) were analyzed 
along with related factors, finally, Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) analysis 
were utilized to predict the trends in the upcoming years. In 2019, globally, 
there were about 414.7 million (95%UI: 368.8 to 464.4 million) OA incident 
cases, with an age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) about 492.21 (95% UI:438.66 
to 551.5) per 100000. And there were about 527.8 million (95% UI: 478.7 to 584.8 
million) OA prevalent cases in 2019. The DALYs for OA increased to about 189.49 
million (95%UI: 95.71 to 376.60 million) from 1990 to 2019 (EAPC:0.14%; 95%CI: 
0.12% to 0.16%). There was a positive association between ASR and 
Socio-demographic index (SDI) both at the regional and national level. BAPC 
results showed that ASR in females would decrease but increase in males in the 
following years. In conclusion, the global burden of OA has risen steadily 
between 1990 and 2019, placing a significant strain on society. This trend is 
expected to continue in the coming years. To alleviate this burden, it is 
necessary to implement measures that target risk factors such as high body mass 
index.

This study aimed to investigate the growth and development parameters of 
Phthorimaea absoluta (Meyrick) population at each stage when feeding on 4 host 
plants: Lycopersicon esculentum, Solanum tuberosum, Solanum melongena, and 
Nicotiana tabacum. The objective was to predict population dynamics and develop 
appropriate control strategies. The age-stage sex-life table was used to 
evaluate survival rate, fecundity, life expectancy, reproductive value, 
population parameters, and population growth prediction of P. absoluta after 
feeding on the 4 Solanaceae plants. The results showed significant variations in 
the fecundity parameters of P. absoluta among the different host plants. The L. 
esculentum population exhibited the highest average egg-laying period 
(13.17 ± 0.61 days) and average egg production (219.31 ± 21.02 eggs), while N. 
tabacum had the lowest values (4.56 ± 0.26 days and 26.08 ± 2.53 eggs, 
respectively). The gross reproduction rate of P. absoluta feeding on L. 
esculentum was 146.43 ± 21.00, which was 1.80, 3.77, and 6.39 times higher 
compared to S. tuberosum, S. melongena, and N. tabacum, respectively. The 
average age period and population doubling time of P. absoluta feeding on L. 
esculentum were lower than those of the other 3 host plants. These results 
indicated that while P. absoluta can complete a generation on L. esculentum, S. 
tuberosum, S. melongena, and N. tabacum, L. esculentum is the most suitable host 
for its growth and development. Therefore, in the occurrence and adjacent areas 
of P. absoluta, relevant authorities should promptly monitor and control its 
population in the planting areas of Solanaceae plants to prevent further spread.

Given the increase in life expectancy, aging with a pre-existing spinal cord 
injury (SCI) is becoming more common. This condition is challenging as 
compromised health status and functional independence can worsen. We aimed to 
provide an updated overview of the consequences of aging with SCI, highlighting 
the main challenges facing this population in a narrative review of the current 
literature we retrieved from the PubMed database from 2000 to 2022 on any aspect 
related to aging in persons with SCI. Here we address adverse circumstances that 
increase disability and hinder an active lifestyle, such as progressive physical 
deterioration, secondary health conditions, limitations in personal activity, 
changes in family and social support structures, aging of caregivers, and 
depletion of economic resources. Favorable changes are also observed, including 
psychosocial adjustments that improve quality of life. Additionally, various 
interventions are discussed to promote well-being, health, and social 
participation. Due to the relevance of this issue, people with SCI and all those 
who take care of them must have up-to-date information to carry out the 
necessary measures to promote healthy aging in a more inclusive social 
environment.

This study investigates the fabrication of edible coating based on Plantago 
ovata seed mucilage (POSM). The films were prepared from POSM (1 %, w/v), 
glycerol (75 %, based on POSM mass), and xanthan gum (XG: 20, 30 and 40 %, based 
on POSM mass) by a casting method, and their physicochemical, mechanical, 
thermal, morphological, and barrier properties were determined. Results 
indicated the development of highly transparent (transparency values: 
1.36 ± 0.05 to 2.42 ± 0.09) and hydrophobic films (contact angle: 101.57 ± 0.34 
to107.08 ± 0.55o) with very low water vapor permeability (WVP: 
2.77 ± 0.02 × 10-12 to 1.98 ± 0.04 × 10-12 g s-1m-1Pa-1), slight water 
solubility (31.14 ± 0.46 to 23.08 ± 0.82 %), and good mechanical properties 
(tensile strength: 30.87 ± 0.96 to 61.80 ± 0.71 MPa). Morphological studies also 
indicated smooth and uniform surfaces without pores and cracks. In addition, the 
films showed good antioxidant activity (61.46 to 68.71 %), and their 
antibacterial activity against E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa was also 
demonstrated. The applicability of the developed films to extend the shelf life 
of strawberries was shown by comparing the appearance of dip-coated strawberries 
and the control sample within 8 days at room temperature. Based on the results, 
the developed biofilms have great potential for edible coating and packaging 
applications.

The current study regarding the effects of larval diets on the life table 
parameters of dengue mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti was conducted under laboratory 
conditions at 27 ± 2 °C and 60 ± 5% relative humidity at NIFA (Nuclear Institute 
for Food and Agriculture) Peshawar, Pakistan. The data on life table parameters 
of Ae. aegypti reared on Diet 1 (replacement diet), Diet 2 (Khan's diet for 
Anopheles), Diet 3 (Khan's modified diet) and Diet 4 (IAEA diet) were analyzed 
using the age-stage, two-sex life table software. Diet 4 (IAEA) was used as a 
control for comparison. The results indicated that significantly maximum 
percentage of egg hatching of Ae. aegypti was observed when reared on Diet 4 
(73.86%) and Diet 3 (72.90%), while less % of egg hatching was recorded in Diet 
1 (40.67%) and Diet 2 (55.53%). The data further showed that the Diet 3 had a 
highest intrinsic rate of increase (r) (0.097 ± 5.68 day-1), finite rate of 
increase (λ) (1.10 ± 6.26 day-1) and net reproductive rate (R0) (11.99 ± 1.52 
eggs/female) followed by Diet 2 and Diet 4. The mean generation time (T) of Ae. 
aegypti reared on Diet 3 (23.67 ± 0.86 days) and Diet 1 (24.05 ± 0.61 days) was 
significantly shorter than Diet 2 (26.15 ± 0.71 days) and Diet 4 
(26.41 ± 0.38 days). The overall results revealed that Diet 3 showed good 
results at different life table parameters of Ae. aegypti and can be used as the 
preferred diet in the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) where the mass culture of 
mosquitoes is required.

Microtubules play a central role in cytoskeletal changes during neuronal 
development and maintenance. Microtubule dynamics is essential to polarity and 
shape transitions underlying neural cell division, differentiation, motility, 
and maturation. Kinesin superfamily protein 2A is a member of human kinesin 13 
gene family of proteins that depolymerize and destabilize microtubules. In 
dividing cells, kinesin superfamily protein 2A is involved in mitotic 
progression, spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation. In postmitotic 
neurons, it is required for axon/dendrite specification and extension, neuronal 
migration, connectivity, and survival. Humans with kinesin superfamily protein 
2A mutations suffer from a variety of malformations of cortical development, 
epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and neurodegeneration. In this review, we 
discuss how kinesin superfamily protein 2A regulates neuronal development and 
function, and how its deregulation causes neurodevelopmental and neurological 
disorders.

Differential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on excess mortality and life 
expectancy loss within the Hispanic population.

BACKGROUND: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Hispanic population 
resulted in the almost complete elimination of the long-standing Hispanic 
mortality advantage relative to the non-Hispanic White population. However, it 
is unknown how COVID-19 mortality affected the diverse Hispanic subpopulations.
OBJECTIVE: We estimate life expectancy at birth in 2019 and 2020 by select 
Hispanic country/region of origin and explore how changes in age-specific 
all-cause and COVID-19 mortality affected changes in life expectancy between 
2019 and 2020 for each group.
METHODS: We use final 2019 and 2020 mortality data from the National Center for 
Health Statistics and population estimates based on the 2019 and 2020 American 
Community Survey. We calculate life tables and apply decomposition techniques to 
explore the effects of changes in age- and cause-specific mortality on life 
expectancy.
RESULTS: Patterns of age- and cause-specific excess deaths and their impact on 
declines in life expectancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic differed substantially 
by Hispanic subgroup. Life expectancy losses ranged from 0.6 to 6.7 years among 
males and from 0.6 to 3.6 years among females.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the heterogeneous impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic within the Hispanic population.
CONTRIBUTIONS: Our findings contribute new information that will help future 
researchers identify the causes of the disproportionately severe impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on the Hispanic population. Our study underscores the 
importance of population disaggregation in endeavors to identify the multiple 
pathways by which the pandemic affected the Hispanic population.

PURPOSE: To assess the relative cost-effectiveness of genomic testing compared 
with standard non-genomic diagnostic investigations in patients with suspected 
monogenic kidney disease from an Australian health care system perspective.
METHODS: Diagnostic and clinical information was used from a national cohort of 
349 participants. Simulation modelling captured diagnostic, health, and economic 
outcomes during a time horizon from clinical presentation until 3 months 
post-test results based on the outcome of cost per additional diagnosis and 
lifetime horizon based on cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Genomic testing was Australian dollars (AU$) 1600 more costly per 
patient and led to an additional 27 diagnoses out of a 100 individuals tested, 
resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AU$5991 per additional 
diagnosis. Using a lifetime horizon, genomic testing resulted in an additional 
cost of AU$438 and 0.04 QALYs gained per individual compared with standard 
diagnostic investigations, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of AU$10,823 per QALY gained. Sub-group analyses identified that the 
results were largely driven by the cost-effectiveness in glomerular diseases.
CONCLUSION: Based on established or expected thresholds of cost-effectiveness, 
our evidence suggests that genomic testing is very likely to be cost saving for 
individuals with suspected glomerular diseases, whereas no evidence of 
cost-effectiveness was found for non-glomerular diseases.

Dietary patterns, nutrition, physical activity, air pollution, tobacco smoke, 
ethnicity and genetics affect heart disease. Vegetarian food diets are one of 
the important factors in its prevention and control. People living in the five 
blue zones, mostly consuming the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), have the highest 
longevity in the world and the least incidence of heart disease. There are 
several forms of heart pathology, e.g., the most common coronary heart disease, 
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, heart valve disease and 
abnormal heart rhythms. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world 
and varies by race, where indigenous and people of color have a higher risk for 
its complications than the white population. The morbidity of cardiovascular 
pathology in the Afro-American community persists high and is a primary source 
of disparities in life expectancy between Afro-Americans and whites in the 
United States. Adherence to healthy diets higher in vegetable foods and lower in 
animal foods is correlated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, 
morbidity and mortality in the general population. A detailed literature review 
was performed of the Medline, EMBASE, and Ebsco databases to synthesize and 
compare evidence on this topic to produce a review of the importance of a 
Mediterranean diet in the prevention of heart disease. Consumption of a MedDiet 
consisting of fruits and vegetables (including berries due to their high fibre 
and antioxidant content), nuts, whole grains, leafy greens, beans like 
chickpeas, eggplants, Greek yogurt and extra virgin olive oil are associated 
with longer life and lower incidence of heart disease. The latter diet is 
superior to consuming large quantities of meat and refined carbohydrates, such 
as sucrose, high fructose corn syrup and grains that have had the fibrous and 
nutritious parts removed.

This review of the French health system analyses recent developments in health 
organisation and governance, financing, healthcare provision, recent reforms and 
health system performance. Overall health status continues to improve in France, 
although geographic and socioeconomic inequalities in life expectancy persist. 
The health system combines a social health insurance (SHI) model with an 
important role for tax-based revenues to finance healthcare. The health system 
provides universal coverage, with a broad benefits basket, but cost-sharing is 
required for all essential services. Private complementary insurance to cover 
these costs results in very low average out-of-pocket (OOP) payments, although 
there are concerns regarding solidarity, financial redistribution and efficiency 
in the health system. The macroeconomic context in the last couple of years in 
the country has been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, which resulted in 
subsequent increases of total health expenditure in France in 2020 (3.7%) and 
2021 (9.8%). Healthcare provision continues to be highly fragmented in France, 
with a segmented approach to care organization and funding across primary, 
secondary and long-term care. Recent reforms aim to strengthen primary care by 
encouraging multidisciplinary group practices, while public health efforts over 
the last decade have focused on boosting prevention strategies and tackling 
lifestyle risk factors, such as smoking and obesity with limited success. 
Continued challenges include ensuring the sustainability of the health 
workforce, particularly to secure adequate numbers of health professionals in 
medically underserved areas, such as rural and less affluent communities, and 
improving working conditions, remuneration and career prospects, especially for 
nurses, to support retention. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought to light some 
structural weaknesses within the French health system, but it has also provided 
opportunities for improving its sustainability. There has been a notable shift 
in the will to give more room to decision-making at the local level, involving 
healthcare professionals, and to find new ways of funding healthcare providers 
to encourage care coordination and integration.

It has been widely recognized that nanostructures in natural biological 
materials play important roles in regulating life machinery. Even though 
nanofabrication techniques such as two-photon polymerization (TPP) provide 
sub-100 nm fabrication resolution, it remains technologically challenging to 
produce 3D nanoscale features modeling the complexity in vivo. We herein 
demonstrate that a nanochannel array carrying different sizes and nanostructures 
with gradually transitioning dimensions can be easily produced on a slightly 
tilted nano-stage. Using the gradient nanochannel array, we systematically 
investigate the factors affecting the dynamics of DNA translocation through 
nanoconfinement, including the size of biomolecules and geometrical features of 
the physical environment, which resembles the selectivity of nanopores in the 
cell membrane. It is observed that T4-phage DNA shows distinctive conformational 
transition dynamics during translocation through nanochannels driven by electric 
field or flow, and the deformation energy required for DNA to enter the 
nanochannels depends on both chemical environmental conditions, i.e., the ionic 
strength regulating DNA persistence length and nanochannel dimension. In the 
electric field, DNA repeatedly gets stretched and compressed during its 
migration through the nanochannel, reflected by elevated fluctuation in 
extension, which is substantially greater than the thermal fluctuation. However, 
driven by flow, DNA remains stretched during translocation through nanochannels, 
and shows variances in extension of merely a few hundred nanometers. These 
results indicate that the optically fabricated gradient nanochannel array is a 
suitable platform for optimizing the experimental conditions for biomedical 
applications such as gene mapping, and verify that production of complex three 
dimensional (3D) nanostructures can be greatly simplified by including slight 
inclination during TPP fabrication.

OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this review is to summarize the evidence on 
the core modelling specifications and methodology on the cost-effectiveness of 
TKR compared to non-surgical management. Another objective of this study is to 
synthesize evidence of TKR cost and compare it across countries using purchasing 
power parity (PPP).
METHODOLOGY: The electronic databases used for this review were MEDLINE 
(PubMed), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), HTAIn 
repository, Cost effectiveness Analysis (CEA) registry, and Google Scholar. 
Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) was used to 
assess the validity of the methods and transparency in reporting the results. 
The Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) was used to check the quality of 
economic evaluation models of the studies included. The cost of TKR surgery from 
high income and low- or middle-income countries were extracted and converted to 
single USD ($) using purchasing power parities (PPP) method.
RESULT: Thirty-two studies were included in this review, out of which eight 
studies used Markov model, five used regression model, one each reported 
Marginal structure model, discrete simulation model, decision tree and 
Osteoarthritis Policy Model (OAPol) respectively to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of TKR. For PPP, twenty-six studies were included in the 
analysis of TKR cost. The average cost of TKR surgery was the lowest in 
developing country-India ($3457) and highest in USA ($19568).
CONCLUSION: The findings of this review showed that the Markov model was most 
widely used in the analysis of the cost effectiveness of TKR. Our review also 
concluded that the cost of TKR was higher in the developed countries as compared 
to the developing countries.

BACKGROUND: As retinoblastoma (RB) is the most frequent primary intraocular 
malignant tumor in childhood, it should be the main pathology to rule out in 
pediatric patients with leukocoria. Persistence of fetal vasculature (PFV) is 
within the differential diagnosis of leukocoria, a vitreous disorder arising 
from a defect in the involution of the hyaloid vasculature in the embryonic 
stage, which affects normal ocular development and commonly produces associated 
microophthalmia. An early diagnosis and timely treatment are crucial for a 
better prognosis and life expectancy of the child.
CASE REPORT: We present a case of retinoblastoma and coexisting with PFV: a 
2-years-and 11-months-old male with no red reflex, and vasculature and 
yellowish-white membrane behind the lens of the right eye. B-mode ultrasound 
with disorganization of the vitreous cavity with high reflectivity echoes 
suggestive of calcification. On examination we found an enlarged eyeball, 
rubeosis iridis, posterior vasculature, intraocular pressure 28 mmHg. Computed 
tomography with heterogeneous intraocular mass with hyperdense regions. With a 
diagnosis of probable retinoblastoma, enucleation was performed. Histopathology 
reported moderately differentiated retinoblastoma coexisting with PFV.
CONCLUSIONS: The finding of these two diagnoses in the same eye is very rare due 
to the different pathophysiology.

Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: El retinoblastoma (RB) es el tumor maligno primario 
intraocular más frecuente en la infancia y debe ser la principal patología a 
descartar en los pacientes pediátricos con leucocoria. La persistencia de la 
vasculatura fetal (PVF) está dentro del diagnóstico diferencial de la 
leucocoria, un trastorno del vítreo que surge de un defecto en la involución de 
la vasculatura hialoidea en la etapa embrionaria que afecta al desarrollo ocular 
normal y comúnmente produce microoftalmia asociada. El diagnóstico temprano y 
tratamiento oportuno son cruciales para un buen pronóstico y mejor esperanza de 
vida del infante.
CASO CLÍNICO: Presentamos un caso de coexistencia de retinoblastoma y PVF: 
paciente de sexo masculino de 2 años y 11 meses sin reflejo rojo y vasculatura y 
membrana blanco-amarillenta detrás del cristalino en el ojo derecho. La 
ecografía en modo B con desorganización de la cavidad vítrea con ecos de alta 
reflectividad sugestivos de calcificación. A la exploración se observó globo 
ocular agrandado, rubeosis iridis, vasculatura posterior, presión intraocular 28 
mmHg. Tomografía computarizada con masa intraocular heterogénea con regiones 
hiperdensas. Con diagnóstico de probable retinoblastoma, se realizó la 
enucleación. La histopatología informó el hallazgo de retinoblastoma 
moderadamente diferenciado coexistente con PVF.
CONCLUSIONES: El hallazgo de estos dos diagnósticos en un mismo ojo es muy poco 
frecuente debido a la diferente fisiopatología.

This study highlights that the contribution of nursing is secondary to 
physicians in overall population health (indexed with life expectancy at birth, 
e(0)). Scatter plots, bivariate correlation and partial correlation models were 
performed to analyse the correlations between e(0) and physician healthcare and 
nursing healthcare respectively. Affluence, urbanization and obesity were 
incorporated as the potential confounders. The Fisher's r-to-z transformation 
was conducted for comparing the correlations. Multiple linear regression 
analyses were implemented for modelling that physicians' contributions to e(0) 
explain nurses'. Nursing healthcare correlated to e(0) significantly less 
strongly than physician healthcare in simple regressions. Nursing healthcare was 
in weak or negligible correlation to e(0) when physician healthcare was 
controlled individually or together with the three confounders. Physician 
healthcare remains significantly correlational to e(0) when nursing healthcare 
alone was controlled or when the three confounders were controlled. Linear 
regression revealed that nursing healthcare was a significant predictor for e(0) 
when physician healthcare was "not added" for modelling, but this predicting 
role became negligible when physician healthcare was "added". Our study findings 
suggested that nurses still work under the direction of physicians due to lack 
of autonomy. Without correction, health services will continue to transmit the 
invisibility of nursing healthcare from one generation of nurses to another.

Nuclear Ca2+ waves elicited by NMDAR and L-type voltage-gated Ca2+-channels as 
well as protein transport from synapse-to-nucleus are both instrumental in 
control of plasticity-related gene expression. At present it is not known 
whether fast [Ca2+]n transients converge in the nucleus with signaling of 
synapto-nuclear protein messenger. Jacob is a protein that translocate a 
signalosome from N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) to the nucleus and that 
docks this signalosome to the transcription factor CREB. Here we show that the 
residing time of Jacob in the nucleoplasm strictly correlates with nuclear 
[Ca2+]n transients elicited by neuronal activity. A steep increase in [Ca2+]n 
induces instantaneous uncoupling of Jacob from LaminB1 at the nuclear lamina and 
promotes the association with the transcription factor cAMP-responsive 
element-binding protein (CREB) in hippocampal neurons. The size of the Jacob 
pool at the nuclear lamina is controlled by previous activity-dependent nuclear 
import, and thereby captures the previous history of NMDAR-induced 
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Moreover, the localization of Jacob at the nuclear 
lamina strongly correlates with synaptic activity and [Ca2+]n waves reflecting 
ongoing neuronal activity. In consequence, the resulting extension of the 
nuclear residing time of Jacob amplifies the capacity of the Jacob signalosome 
to regulate CREB-dependent gene expression and will, thereby, compensate for the 
relatively small number of molecules reaching the nucleus from individual 
synapses.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are 
frequently used to prevent sudden cardiac death in patients with high-risk 
arrhythmias. However, the use of ICD therapy in elderly patients beyond the 
predicted age of life expectancy is still controversial. We aimed to evaluate 
the predictors of mortality and clinical outcomes following ICD implantation in 
elderly patients.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 145 elderly patients aged 72 
years and older who received ICD implantation between January 2010 and August 
2015. We collected and analyzed baseline data, including clinical, demographic, 
and medical history, the reason for ICD therapy, procedural data, and 
echocardiography results. Follow-up data included the development of 
complications and mortality. The predictors of mortality were identified using 
the univariate and multivariable Cox regression models.
RESULTS: During the median follow-up duration of 30.5 [18.0-48.0] months, 141 
cases completed follow-up (mean age = 76.0 ± 3.7 years). Forty-four patients 
experienced at least one episode of ICD therapy. Inappropriate shock, recurrent 
shock, and device-related infection were the most frequent complications 
observed in our study. Of the 145 patients, 42 died during the follow-up period, 
with an average survival time of 22.4 months after ICD implantation. Among these 
patients, 11 received ICD for primary prevention, and 31 received it for 
secondary prevention. Cardiovascular problems were the leading cause of death. 
We found that a low baseline ejection fraction (EF) was an independent predictor 
of mortality (hazard ratio = 0.93, 95% confidence interval: 0.90-0.98; 
p = 0.008).
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that ICD therapy is a valuable treatment option 
for elderly patients beyond their predicted age of life expectancy. The study 
highlights the importance of baseline EF as a significant predictor of mortality 
in these patients.

Background. Older and sicker adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) were 
underrepresented in randomized trials of glucagon-like peptide 1 
receptor-agonist (GLP1RA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors 
(SGLT2I), and thus, health benefits are uncertain in this population. Objective. 
To assess the impact of age, health status, and life expectancy in older adults 
with T2D on health benefits of GLP1RA and SGLT2I. Design. We used the United 
Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) model to simulate lifetime health 
outcomes. We calibrated the UKPDS model to improve mortality prediction in older 
adults using a common geriatric prognostic index. Participants. National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013-2018 participants 65 y and older with T2D, 
eligible for GLP1RA or SGLT2I according to American Diabetes Association 
guidelines. Interventions. GLP1RA or SGLT2I use versus no additional medication. 
Main Measures. Lifetime complications and weighted life-years (LYs) and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) across overall treatment arms and life 
expectancies. Key Results. The overall older adult population was predicted to 
experience significant health benefits from GLP1RA (+0.29 LY [95% confidence 
interval: 0.27, 0.31], +0.15 QALYs [0.14, 0.16]) and SGLT2I (+0.26 LY [0.24, 
0.28], +0.13 QALYs [0.12, 0.14]) as compared with no added medication. However,
