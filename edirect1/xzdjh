OBJECTIVES: To quantify the magnitude of differences between observed overall 
survival and respective, age-adjusted Social Security Administration life 
tables-derived life expectancy in Caucasian, African American, Hispanic/Latino 
and Asian metastatic prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, to test for 
differences in cancer-specific mortality and other-cause mortality according to 
race/ethnicity.
METHODS: We relied on the 2004-2006 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results 
database to identify Caucasian, African American, Hispanic/Latino and Asian 
metastatic prostate cancer patients. Social Security Administration life tables 
were used to compute 10-year life expectancy for comparisons with observed 
overall survival. Poisson regression plots showed cancer-specific mortality 
relative to other-cause mortality for each race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: A total of 2574 (64.2%) patients were Caucasian, 753 (18.8%) were 
African American, 453 (11.3%) were Hispanic/Latino and 227 (5.7%) were Asian, 
respectively. The median age at diagnosis was 72 years in Caucasian patients, 
68 years in African American patients, 70 years in Hispanic/Latino patients and 
72 years in Asian patients. Observed overall survival rates were always lower 
compared with respective predicted life expectancy. The magnitude of the 
difference between observed overall survival and predicted life expectancy at 
10 years was highest in African American patients (-52.2%), followed by 
Caucasian patients (-48.3%), Hispanic/Latino patients (-46.1%) and Asian 
patients (-37.4%). African American patients showed the highest cancer-specific 
mortality rates (71.1%) and second-highest other-cause mortality rates (17.4% vs 
highest 18.4% in Caucasian patients), despite having the youngest age at 
diagnosis. Asian patients showed the lowest cancer-specific mortality rates 
(65.5%, P < 0.0001) and lowest other-cause mortality rates (13.3%, P = 0.04), 
despite having the oldest age at diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite having the youngest age at diagnosis, African American 
patients show the least favorable survival profile in metastatic prostate 
cancer. Conversely, Asian patients show the most favorable survival profile in 
metastatic prostate cancer, despite having the oldest age at diagnosis.

The increase in life expectancy of the population is reflected both in 
statistics on chronic sensorineural hearing loss and on issues related to 
hearing rehabilitation methods. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the use of 
auditory training using the virtual reality program developed by us in patients 
of older age groups as an additional method of rehabilitation was carried out. 
68 patients took part in the study (average age was 81,3±2,1 years), according 
to the results of the training, the parameters of speech and spatial hearing 
were evaluated.

Prostate cancer and metabolic syndrome are common among men in the Western 
world. As the population grows older and life expectancy increases, the rates of 
both diseases are expected to increase. We now recognize that metabolic syndrome 
and prostate cancer interact. Metabolic syndrome may be a risk factor for 
prostate cancer and may also worsen outcomes. At the same time, treatment for 
prostate cancer may exacerbate metabolic syndrome and cardiac disease. This 
mini-review summarizes current evidence and puts it into clinical prospective. 
PATIENT SUMMARY: Metabolic syndrome is now a global epidemic. It is 
characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, high blood pressure, and high 
blood lipids. There is a complex interaction between metabolic syndrome and the 
risk of prostate cancer, as treatment of one disease may affect the other.

This study aimed to identify the causes of death in dogs that were buried at pet 
cemeteries. Using data obtained from a questionnaire completed by 5,118 dog 
owners from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017, we estimated the life expectancy and 
the odds ratio for principal causes of death using multiple logistic regression 
analysis with potential risk factors as independent variables. The life 
expectancy determined at birth was 13.98 years. The commonest cause of death was 
senility. The odds ratios of dying of senility being significantly higher in 
Labrador Retrievers and Shiba breeds and aged dogs, and significantly lower in 
Chihuahuas, dogs living indoors and neutered dogs.

Since venous microthrombotic and thromboembolic events in end organs have been 
pathophysiologically confirmed as a component of thrombo-inflammatory cascade in 
COVID-19 syndrome, anticoagulant prescription with prophylactic or therapeutic 
goal is recommended. Different guidelines for the above are introduced; however, 
there is no general consensus on any neither the type of anticoagulant nor for 
the dosage and duration of prescription. In our medical center, adopted internal 
guideline was considered for patients COVID-19. We consulted patients with 
COVID-19 who suffered from concurrent hematoma. Appropriate surgical approach 
was considered. Finally autopsy study was performed for patients. In this 
article, we presented a series of seven SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases faced with 
bleeding complication following initiation of anticoagulation protocol. The 
rectus sheath hematoma with extension to pelvic and/or retroperitoneal space, 
even involving bowel mesentery was seen most commonly. Despite receiving 
appropriate surgical care, all seven cases died. Finally, in all cases, autopsy 
studies revealed no evidence for confirmation of DIC/SIC or organ failure as the 
reason of death although pulmonary involvement with SARS-CoV-2 and bleeding 
phenomena were approved. The nature of the COVID-19 syndrome makes patients 
vulnerable to hemorrhagic events following anticoagulant administration which 
relatively causes or accelerates patient's expiration.

In the last 150 years, we have seen a significant increase in average life 
expectancy, associated with a shift from infectious to non-communicable 
diseases. The rising incidence of these diseases, for which age is often the 
largest risk factor, highlights the need for contemporary societies to improve 
healthy ageing for their growing silver generations. As ageing is an inevitable, 
non-reversing and highly individualised process, we need to better understand 
how non-genetic factors like diet choices and commensal gut microbes can 
modulate the biology of ageing. In this review, we discuss how geographical and 
ethnic variations influence habitual dietary patterns, nutrient structure, and 
gut microbial profiles with potential impact on the human healthspan. Several 
gut microbial genera have been associated with healthy elderly populations but 
are highly variable across populations. It seems unlikely that a universal 
pro-longevity gut microbiome exists. Rather, the optimal microbiome appears to 
be conditional on the microbial functionality acting on regional- and 
ethnicity-specific trends driven by cultural food context. We also highlight 
dietary and microbial factors that have been observed to elicit individual and 
clustered biological responses. Finally, we identify next generation avenues to 
modify otherwise fixed host functions and the individual ageing trajectory by 
manipulating the malleable gut microbiome with regionally adapted, personalised 
food intervention regimens targeted at prolonging human healthspan.

INTRODUCTION: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) significantly increases the life 
expectancy of HIV positive people by improving quality of life as well as 
enabling them to resume sexual activity. A growing number of people living with 
HIV became a source of exposure to sexually transmitted infections, including 
other strains of HIV that place others at risk unless they consistently use 
condoms. This study assessed the magnitude of unprotected sexual practices and 
associated factors among adult people living with HIV on ART in public hospitals 
of the Kembata Tembaro Zone, Southern Ethiopia.
METHODS: a facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among adult people 
living with HIV on ART in public hospitals of the zone from March 1-30, 2016. 
Data were collected by a pretested and structured questionnaire. Binary logistic 
regression was used to investigate variables, independently associated with the 
outcome variable. The adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI used to show the strength 
of the association and a P-value < 0.05 was used to declare the cut-off point in 
determining the level of significance.
RESULTS: the study revealed that 40.9% of respondents practiced unprotected 
sexual intercourse. On multivariate logistic regression analyses, being females, 
having more than one sexual partner, mean monthly income of <530 Ethiopian 
birrs/ month, those who had a seropositive partner, a partner of unknown 
serostatus, and respondents who had insufficient knowledge of HIV transmission 
and prevention were statically significant with the outcome variable.
CONCLUSION: the scarcity of knowledge on HIV transmission, negative attitude 
towards condom use, non-disclosure status and having more than one sexual 
partnership increased likelihood of have unprotected sex among the respondents.

associated diseases.

Diversity-disease relationship (DDR) is a de facto standard analysis in the 
studies of human microbiome associated diseases (MADs). For example, the species 
richness or Shannon entropy are routinely compared between the healthy and 
diseased groups. Nevertheless, the basic scale of the standard diversity 
analysis is individual subject rather than a cohort or population because the 
diversity is computed for individual samples, not for the group. Here we aim to 
expand the current DDR study from individual focus to population level, which 
can offer important insights for understanding the epidemiology of MADs. We 
analyzed the diversity-disease relationship at cohort scale based on a 
collection of 23 datasets covering the major human MADs. Methodologically, we 
harness the power of a recent extension to the classic species-area relationship 
(SAR), i.e., the diversity-area relationship (DAR), to achieve the expansion 
from individual DDR to inter-subject diversity scaling analysis. Specifically, 
we apply the DAR analysis to estimate and compare the potentially maximal 
accrual diversities of the healthy and diseases groups, as well as the 
inter-subject diversity scaling parameters and the individual-to-population 
diversity ratios. It was shown that, except for the potential diversity (D max) 
at the cohort level in approximately 5.4% cases of MADs, DAR parameters 
displayed no significant differences between healthy and diseased treatments. 
That is, the DAR parameters are rather resilient against MADs, except for the 
potential diversity in some diseases. We compared our population-level DDR with 
the existing individual-level DDR patterns and proposed a hypothesis to 
interpret their differences.

A recent phenomenal study discovered that the extension domain of secreted 
amyloid-β precursor protein (sAPP) can bind to the intrinsically disordered 
sushi 1 domain of the γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1a (GABABR1a) 
and modulate its synaptic transmission. The work provided an important 
structural foundation for the modulation of GABABR1a; however, the detailed 
molecular interaction mechanism, crucial for future drug design, remains 
elusive. Here, we further investigated the dynamical interactions between sAPP 
peptides and the natively unstructured sushi 1 domain using all-atom molecular 
dynamics simulations, for both the 17-residue sAPP peptide (APP 17-mer) and its 
minimally active 9 residue segment (APP 9-mer). We then explored mutations of 
the APP 9-mer with rigorous free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. Our in 
silico mutagenesis studies revealed key residues (D4, W6, and W7) responsible 
for the binding with the sushi 1 domain. More importantly, one double mutation 
based on different vertebrate APP sequences from evolution exhibited a stronger 
binding (ΔΔG = -1.91 ± 0.66 kcal mol-1), indicating a potentially enhanced 
GABABR1a modulator. These large-scale simulations may provide new insights into 
the binding mechanism between sAPP and the sushi 1 domain, which could open new 
avenues in the development of future GABABR1a-specific therapeutics.

In older patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) and limited life 
expectancy due to age and or comorbidities, it is particularly important to 
consider the risk of transformation for individualised treatment decisions. 
There is limited information on potential differences between younger and older 
CMML patients regarding the cumulative risk of transformation as well as 
haematological, molecular and biologic characteristics. We analysed data from 
the Austrian Biodatabase for CMML (ABCMML) to compare these parameters in 518 
CMML patients. Categorisation of patients into 3 age-related groups: <60 years, 
60-79 years and ≥80 years, showed a significantly lower risk of transformation 
at higher age by competing risk analysis, with a 4-year risk of 39%, 23% and 
13%, respectively (P < .0001). The lower probability of transformation was 
associated with a lower percentage of blast cells in the peripheral blood (PB) 
of older patients. Furthermore, we provide a simple score based on age, PB 
blasts and platelet counts that allowed us to define subgroups of CMML patients 
with a different cumulative transformation risk, including a low-risk group with 
a transformation risk of only 5%. Our findings may facilitate reasonable 
treatment decisions in elderly patients with CMML.

Disability in Childhood, Special Education Histories, and Lifetime Health 
Outcomes in the United States.

Laditka SB(1), Laditka JN(1), Hoyle JN(1).

Author information:

Objectives: We evaluated special education as an indicator of childhood 
disability and used that indicator to estimate lifetime dependency and life 
expectancy. Methods: Data: Panel Study of Income Dynamics and Health and 
Retirement Study (n = 20,563). Dependency: Nursing home care or equivalent. 
Analysis: We first analyzed special education as an indicator of childhood 
disability; multinomial logistic Markov models and microsimulation then compared 
populations with and without childhood disability. Results: Special education 
history was a valid indicator of childhood disability. For example, with parents 
who did not complete high school, 3.8% with no special education history were 
dependent at least 5 years of adult life; that result with special education was 
15.2%. Life expectancy from age 20 was 58.3 years without special education, 
46.0 years with special education (both p < .05). Discussion: Special education 
history can indicate childhood disability. People with that history had 
significantly a more dependency than others and significantly shorter lives.

Introduction: Despite widespread use of cannabidiol (CBD), no lifelong toxicity 
study has been published to date. Caenorhabditis elegans is often used in 
preclinical lifelong toxicity studies, due to an estimated 60-80% of their genes 
having a human ortholog, and their short lifespan of ∼2-3 weeks. In this study, 
we examined both acute and long-term exposure studies of CBD at physiologically 
relevant concentrations. Materials and Methods: Acute toxicity was determined by 
treating day 1 adults with a wide range of CBD concentrations (0.4 μM to 4 mM) 
and assessing mortality and motility compared to control animals. 
Thermotolerance was examined by treating adult animals with CBD (0.4 μM to 4 mM) 
and exposing them to 37°C for 4 h, and then scoring for the number of alive 
animals treated with CBD compared to controls. Long-term toxicity was assessed 
by exposing day 1 adults to 10, 40, and 100 μM CBD until all animals perished. 
Control animals had no active drug exposure. Results: We report both acute and 
long-term exposure studies of CBD to adult C. elegans at physiologically 
relevant concentrations. Acute toxicity results showed that no animal died when 
exposed to 0.4-4000 μM CBD. The thermotolerance study showed that 40 μM CBD, but 
not other treatment levels, significantly increased resistance to heat stress by 
141% compared to the untreated controls. Notably, whole-life exposure of C. 
elegans to 10-100 μM CBD revealed a maximum life extension of 18% observed at 
40 μM CBD. In addition, motility analysis of the same groups revealed an 
increase in late-stage life activity by up to 206% compared to controls. 
Conclusion: These results serve as the only CBD lifelong exposure data in an in 
vivo model to date. While further research into the lifelong use of CBD should 
be carried out in mammalian models, the C. elegans model indicates a lack of 
long-term toxicity at physiologically relevant concentrations.

To manage the increasing burden of dental diseases, a robust health system is 
essential. In order to ensure the oral health system operates at an optimal 
level going into the future, a forecast of the national shortfall of dentists 
and dental specialists in South Africa (SA) was undertaken. There is currently a 
shortage of dentists and specialists in SA and given the huge burden of dental 
diseases, there is a dire need to increase the number of these health care 
workers. The aim was to determine the projected shortfall of dentists and 
specialists in each of the nine provinces in SA. The projected shortfall was 
calculated based on the SA Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for each 
province. The estimate for the evaluation of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
for SA was obtained from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) 
Global Burden of Disease website. For each province, age standardized DALYs were 
calculated with mid-year population estimates obtained from Statistics SA 2018. 
In order to reduce the existing human resources for health (HRH) inequity among 
the provinces of SA, three scenarios were created focussing on attaining 
horizontal equity. The best-case scenario estimates a shortfall of 430, 1252 and 
1885 dentists and specialists in 2018, 2024 and 2030 respectively. In an 
optimistic scenario, the national shortfall was calculated at 733, 1540 and 2158 
dentists and specialists for the years 2018, 2024 and 2030 respectively. In an 
aspirational scenario, shortfalls of 853 (2018), 1655 (2024) and 2267 (2030) 
dentists and specialists were forecasted. Access to oral health services should 
be ensured through the optimum supply of trained dentists and specialists and 
the delivery of appropriate oral health services. Thus, the roadmap provided for 
upscaling the oral health services recognizes the influence of both demand and 
supply factors on the pursuit of equity.

Breast cancer is increasingly prevalent in older adults and is a substantial 
part of routine oncology practice. However, management of breast cancer in this 
population is challenging because the disease is highly heterogeneous and there 
is insufficient evidence specific to older adults. Decision making should not be 
driven by age alone but should involve geriatric assessments plus careful 
consideration of life expectancy, competing risks of mortality, and patient 
preferences. A multidisciplinary taskforce, including members of the European 
Society of Breast Cancer Specialists and International Society of Geriatric 
Oncology, gathered to expand and update the previous 2012 evidence-based 
recommendations for the management of breast cancer in older individuals with 
the endorsement of the European Cancer Organisation. These guidelines were 
expanded to include chemotherapy toxicity prediction calculators, cultural and 
social considerations, surveillance imaging, genetic screening, gene expression 
profiles, neoadjuvant systemic treatment options, bone-modifying drugs, targeted 
therapies, and supportive care. Recommendations on geriatric assessment, ductal 
carcinoma in situ, screening, primary endocrine therapy, surgery, radiotherapy, 
adjuvant systemic therapy, and secondary breast cancer were updated.

The widespread use of Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in everyday life, its 
long half-life, and the lipophilicity that makes it easily accumulate in the 
body, raises the question of its safe exposure among different population 
groups. There are currently enough epidemiological studies showing evidence of 
PFOS exposure and its associated adverse effects on humans. Moreover, it is 
already known that physiological changes along with age e.g. organ volume, renal 
blood flow, cardiac output and albumin concentrations affect chemicals body 
burden. Human biomonitoring cohort studies have reported PFOS concentrations in 
blood and autopsy tissue data with PFOS present in sensitive organs across all 
human lifespan. However, to interpret such biomonitoring data in the context of 
chemical risk assessment, it is necessary to have a mechanistic framework that 
explains show the physiological changes across age affects the concentration of 
chemical inside different tissues of the human body. PBPK model is widely and 
successfully used in the field of risk assessment. The objective of this 
manuscript is to develop a dynamic age-dependent PBPK model as an extension of 
the previously published adult PFOS model and utilize this model to predict and 
compare the PFOS tissue distribution and plasma concentration across different 
age groups. Different cohort study data were used for exposure dose 
reconstruction and evaluation of time-dependent concentration in sensitive 
organs. Predicted plasma concentration followed trends observed in biomonitoring 
data and model predictions showed the increased disposition of PFOS in the 
geriatric population. PFOS model is sensitive to parameters governing renal 
resorption and elimination across all ages, which is related to PFOS half-life 
in humans. This model provides an effective framework for improving the 
quantitative risk assessment of PFOS throughout the human lifetime, particularly 
in susceptible age groups. The dynamic age-dependent PBPK model provides a step 
forward for developing such kind of dynamic model for other perfluoroalkyl 
substances.

OBJECTIVES: There are regional disparities in implementation rates of 
endovascular thrombectomy due to time and resource constraints such as 
endovascular thrombectomy specialists. In Hokkaido, Japan, Drive and Retrieve 
System (DRS), where endovascular thrombectomy specialists perform early 
endovascular thrombectomies by traveling from the facilities where they normally 
work to facilities closer to the patient. This study analyzed the 
cost-effectiveness of allocating a endovascular thrombectomy specialist for DRS 
to treat stroke patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: he number of ischemic stroke patients expected to receive 
endovascular thrombectomy in Hokkaido in 2015 was estimated. It was assumed that 
an additional neutointerventionist was allocated for DRS. The analysis was 
performed from the government's perspective, which includes medical and 
nursing-care costs, and the personnel cost for endovascular thrombectomy 
specialist. The analysis was conducted comparing the current scenario, where 
patients received endovascular thrombectomy in facilities where endovascular 
thrombectomy specialists normally work, with the scenario with DRS within 60 min 
drive distance. Patient transport time was analyzed using geographic information 
system, and patient severity was estimated from the transport time. The primary 
outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in each medical area 
which was calculated from the incremental costs and the incremental 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), estimated from patient severity using 
published literature. The entire process was repeated 100 times.
RESULTS: DRS was most cost-effective in Kamikawachubu area, where the ICER was 
$14,173±16,802/QALY, significantly lower than the threshold that the Japanese 
guideline suggested.
CONCLUSIONS: Since DRS was cost-effective in Kamikawachubu area, the area should 
be prioritized when a endovascular thrombectomy specialist for DRS is allocated 
as a policy.

BACKGROUND: The management of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity malignancies has 
evolved significantly with the development of advanced endoscopic techniques and 
improvements in adjuvant therapy. We sought to characterize both 
disease-specific survival (DSS) and 5-year conditional disease-specific survival 
(CDSS, the change in life expectancy with increasing survivorship) for sinus 
malignancies diagnosed before and after the year 2000.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with sinus and nasal cavity cancer between 1973-2015 
were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, End Results (SEER) registry. 
Kaplan-Meier analysis for DSS was stratified by year of diagnosis before and 
after 2000. Cox-proportional hazards models of DSS controlling for stage, age, 
and year of diagnosis were generated. CDSS was calculated using Cox-regression 
models stratified by stage.
RESULTS: We analyzed 10,535 patients. Diagnosis after the year 2000 was 
independently associated with improved DSS (HR:0.81, 95% CI: 0.75-0.87, 
P < .001) after controlling for age and stage. After stratifying by stage, 
diagnosis after year 2000 was associated with improved DSS for localized 
(HR:0.71, 0.59-0.86, P < .001) malignancies, regional (HR: 0.86, 0.78-0.94, 
P = .001) and distant malignancies (HR 0.74, 0.63-0.87, P < .001). CDSS improved 
with increasing survivorship for all stages of sinus and nasal cavity cancer, 
and those diagnosed after 2000 had improved CDSS compared to those diagnosed 
before 2000. Descriptively, the association of year of diagnosis with CDSS 
diminished with increasing survivorship for localized cancers, but was 
consistent for other stages.
CONCLUSION: For paranasal sinus and nasal cavity malignancies, year of diagnosis 
independently influences both DSS and CDSS. Improved survival is likely due to 
advances in both surgical and adjuvant treatments. To our knowledge, this study 
is the first to examine CDSS for these malignancies.

BACKGROUND: With the improvement of life expectancy, the world faces increasing 
demands for care of older persons. In this manuscript, we define the 
characteristics of primary informal caregivers (PIC) of patients aged 75 years 
and older admitted to geriatric day hospitals (GDH) in Belgium. A PIC is defined 
as the person who most often provides care and assistance to persons who need to 
be cared for. We describe PIC socio-demographic characteristics, satisfaction, 
burden and wishes about caring; the type of assistance provided and received, 
their self-rated health, socio-demographic and medical characteristics of 
proxies, in particular the presence of behavioural disorders.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 25 GDH.
PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred seventy-five PIC of patients ≥75 years and their 
proxies. PIC completed a questionnaire at the GDH assessing burden by Zarit 
Burden Index-12 (ZBI-12), self-rated health, social restriction due to 
caregiving and financial participation. We compared the characteristics of PIC 
with high and low burden, and the characteristics of spouses and adult children 
PIC. We also analyzed factors associated with a high burden in a multivariable 
logistic regression model.
RESULTS: PIC were mainly women (72%), adult children (53.8%) and spouses 
(30.6%). The mean age was 64 ± 14 years for PIC and 84 ± 5 years for care 
recipients. PIC helped for most of Activities in Daily Living (ADL) and 
Instrumental ADL (iADL). The median ZBI-12 score was 10 [IQR 5-18]. In 
multivariable regression analysis, a high burden was positively associated in 
the total group with living with the relative (p = 0.045), the difficulty to 
take leisure time or vacation (p <  0.001), behavioral and mood disorders 
(p <  0.001;p = 0.005), and was negatively associated with bathing the relative 
(p = 0.017) and a better subjective health status estimation (p <  0.001).
CONCLUSION: Primary informal caregivers, who were predominantly women, were 
involved in care for ADL and iADL. A high burden was associated with living with 
the relative, the difficulty to take leisure time or vacation and the relative's 
behavioral and mood disorders. Bathing the relative and a subjective health 
status estimated as good as or better than people the same age, were protective 
factors against a high burden.

BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal disorders are a leading cause of disability adjusted 
life years (DALY) in the world. We aim to describe the prevalence and to compare 
the DALYs and loss of health state utilities (LHSU) attributable to common 
musculoskeletal disorders in Chile.
METHODS: We used data from the Chilean National Health Survey carried out in 
2016-2017. Six musculoskeletal disorders were detected through the COPCOPRD 
questionnaire: chronic musculoskeletal pain, chronic low back pain, chronic 
shoulder pain, osteoarthritis of hip and knee, and fibromyalgia. We calculated 
the DALY for each disorder for 18 sex and age strata, and LHSU following an 
individual and population level approaches. We also calculated the fraction of 
LHSU attributable to pain.
RESULTS: Chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder affects a fifth of the adult 
population, with a significant difference between sexes. Among specific 
musculoskeletal disorders highlights chronic low back pain with the highest 
prevalence. Musculoskeletal disorders are a significant cause of LHSU at the 
individual level, especially in the case of fibromyalgia. Chronic 
musculoskeletal pain caused 503,919 [283,940 - 815,132] DALYs in 2017, and 
roughly two hundred thousand LSHU at population level, which represents 9.7% 
[8.8-10.6] of the total LSHU occurred in that year. Discrepancy in the burden of 
musculoskeletal disorders was observed according to DALY or LSHU estimation. The 
pain and discomfort domain of LHSU accounted for around half of total LHSU in 
people with musculoskeletal disorders.
CONCLUSION: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a major source of burden and LHSU. 
Fibromyalgia should deserve more attention in future studies. Using the 
attributable fraction offers a straightforward and flexible way to explore the 
burden of musculoskeletal disorders.
