As social media becomes an ever-increasing staple of everyday life and a growing 
percentage of people turn to community driven platforms as a primary source of 
information, the data created from these posts can provide a new source of 
information from which to better understand an event in near real time. The 
2018-2020 outbreak of Newcastle Disease (ND) in Southern California is the third 
outbreak of ND in Southern California within a 50-year time span. These 
outbreaks are thought to be primarily driven by non-commercial poultry (i.e. 
backyard and game fowl) in the region. Here we employed a commercial 'web 
crawling' tool between June of 2018 and July of 2020 which encompassed the 
majority of the outbreak in order to collect all available online mentions of 
'virulent Newcastle Disease' (vND), the terminology commonly used by the 
California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), United States Department 
of Agriculture (USDA), and the general public, in relation to the outbreak. A 
total of 2498 posts in English and Spanish were returned using a Boolean 
logic-based string search. While the number of posts was relatively small, their 
impact as measured by the number of visitors to the website and the number of 
people viewing the post (where provided) was much larger. Posts with negative 
sentiment were found to have a larger audience relative to posts with a positive 
sentiment. In addition, posts with negative sentiment peaked in May of 2019 
which preceded the formation of the anti-depopulation group Save Our Birds 
(SOB). As the usage and impact of social media grows, the ability to utilize 
tools to analyze social media may improve both response and outreach-based 
strategies for various disease outbreaks including vND in Southern California 
which has a large non-commercial poultry population.

RATIONALE: Pyomyositis is characterized by an insidious and multifactorial 
inflammatory process, which is often caused by hematogenous pathogen. 
Predisposing risk factors include immunodeficiency, diabetes, malignancy, or 
trauma. The spectrum of clinical presentation depends on disease severity, 
typically presented by fever and hip pain. We hereby present a case with 
extensive pyomyositis secondary to chronic paronychia infection.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 14-year-old immunocompetent male presented with fever and 
hip pain. The patient was initially surveyed for common infectious etiologies 
prior to the presentation of acute limping, which led to image confirmation of 
extensive pyomyositis.
DIAGNOSIS: The patient presented with acute pain in the right hip accompanied by 
headache, myalgia of the right leg, and intermittent fever for a week. Physical 
examination disclosed limping gait, limited range of motion marked by restricted 
right hip flexion and right knee extension, and chronic paronychia with a nail 
correction brace of the left hallux. Diagnosis of pyomyositis was confirmed by 
magnetic resonance image. Methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus 
was isolated from the patient's blood and urine cultures within 2 days of 
collection. The same strain was also isolated from the pus culture collected via 
sonography-guided aspiration.
INTERVENTIONS: Antibiotics treatment with oxacillin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, 
and fosfomycin were administered. Sonography-guided aspiration and computed 
tomography-guided pigtail drainage were arranged, along with nail extraction of 
his left hallux paronychia prior to discharge. Oral antibiotics fusidic acid was 
prescribed. Total antibiotics course of treatment was 4 weeks.
OUTCOMES: The patient gradually defervesced and was afebrile after drainage. 
Followed limb doppler sonography showed regression of the abscess at his right 
lower limb. Gait and range of motion gradually recovered without sequelae.
LESSONS: Ambulation and quality of life are greatly affected by the inflammatory 
process of pyomyositis. Detailed evaluation of predisposing factors should be 
done, even in immunocompetent individuals. Timely diagnosis is vital to 
successful treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial tumour in children, 
and prognosis for refractory and relapsed disease is still poor. Early-phase 
clinical trials play a pivotal role in the development of novel drugs. Ensuring 
adequate recruitment is crucial. The primary aim was to determine the rate of 
participation trials for children with refractory/relapsed neuroblastoma in two 
of the largest drug development European institutions.
METHODS: Data from patients diagnosed with refractory/relapsed neuroblastoma 
between January 2012 and December 2018 at the two institutions were collected 
and analysed.
RESULTS: Overall, 48 patients were included. A total of 31 (65%) 
refractory/relapsed cases were enrolled in early-phase trials. The main reasons 
for not participating in clinical trials included not fulfilling eligibility 
criteria prior to consent (12/17, 70%) and screening failure (2/17, 12%). Median 
time on trial was 4.3 months (range 0.6-13.4). Most common cause for trial 
discontinuation was disease progression (67.7%). Median overall survival was 
longer in refractory (28 months, 95% CI: 20.9-40.2) than in relapsed patients 
(14 months, 95% CI: 8.1-20.1) (p = .034).
CONCLUSIONS: Although two thirds of children with refractory/relapsed 
neuroblastoma were enrolled in early-phase trials, recruitment rates can still 
be improved. The main cause for not participating on trials was not fulfilling 
eligibility criteria prior to consent, mainly due to performance status and 
short life expectancy. This study highlights the hurdles to access to innovative 
therapies for children with relapsed/refractory neuroblastomas, and identifies 
key areas of development to improve recruitment to early-phase trials.

We discuss recent evidence supporting the hypothesis that sarcopenia is an 
emerging health concern among people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
because of increasing life expectancy and HIV- and treatment-related 
comorbidities. We also hypothesize that combined exercise at higher intensity 
has a key role in managing sarcopenia in this population because it directly 
(increases muscle strength and stimulates hypertrophy) and indirectly (prevents 
mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and persistent inflammation) 
counteracts sarcopenia hallmarks.

(1)Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, Brazil.

Studies have shown that a new demographic and epidemiological profile has been 
emerging in women of childbearing age, mainly due to the increase in life 
expectancy, reduction in infant mortality, higher survival in old age, and the 
drop in fertility rate.To evaluate the external (violence) causes of mortality 
among women in Brazil from 2007 to 2016.This is a quantitative, ecological study 
of temporal trends and correlations of the main causes of mortality of women of 
childbearing age and their association with age, from 2007 to 2016 in Brazil. 
The collected data were extracted from the Departamento de Informática do 
Sistema Único de Saúde database called the Mortality Information System.It was 
possible to identify a considerable increase among the Brazilian states, with 
the highest coefficient of mortality from external causes, especially the 
northern regions. The highest coefficient identified among the evaluated states 
was 3.57 per 10,000, and in the northeast and southeast, external causes mainly 
affected young women aged 10 to 29 years.It is necessary for managers and health 
professionals to be more aware of the diseases that affect this population.

OBJECTIVES: Recent innovations in prostate cancer diagnosis include new 
biomarkers and more accurate biopsy methods. This study assesses the evidence 
base on cost-effectiveness of these developments (eg, Prostate Health Index and 
magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]-guided biopsy) and identifies areas of 
improvement for future cost-effectiveness models.
METHODS: A systematic review using the National Health Service Economic 
Evaluation Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Health Technology Assessment databases, 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, and United Kingdom 
National Screening Committee guidance was performed, between 2009 and 2021. 
Relevant data were extracted on study type, model inputs, modeling methods and 
cost-effectiveness conclusions, and results narratively synthesized.
RESULTS: A total of 22 model-based economic evaluations were included. A total 
of 11 compared the cost-effectiveness of new biomarkers to prostate-specific 
antigen testing alone and all found biomarkers to be cost saving. A total of 8 
compared MRI-guided biopsy methods to transrectal ultrasound-guided methods and 
found MRI-guided methods to be most cost-effective. Newer detection methods 
showed a reduction in unnecessary biopsies and overtreatment. The most 
cost-effective follow-up strategy in men with a negative initial biopsy was 
uncertain. Many studies did not model for stage or grade of cancer, cancer 
progression, or the entire testing and treatment pathway. Few fully accounted 
for uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS: This review brings together the cost-effectiveness literature for 
novel diagnostic methods in prostate cancer, showing that most studies have 
found new methods to be more cost-effective than standard of care. Several 
limitations of the models were identified, however, limiting the reliability of 
the results. Areas for further development include accurately modeling the 
impact of early diagnostic tests on long-term outcomes of prostate cancer and 
fully accounting for uncertainty.

Pregnancy presents a unique challenge to economic evaluation, requiring methods 
that can account for both maternal and fetal outcomes. The ethical challenges to 
healthcare presented by pregnancy are well understood, but these have not yet 
been incorporated into cost-effectiveness approaches. Economic evaluations of 
pregnancy currently take an ad hoc approach to outcome valuation, opening the 
door to biased estimates and inconsistent resource allocation. We summarize the 
limitations of current economic evaluation methods and outline key areas for 
future work.

Reevaluating the Evidence for Intensive Postoperative Extracolonic Surveillance 
for Nonmetastatic Colorectal Cancer.

OBJECTIVES: The FACS, GILDA, and COLOFOL trials have cast doubt on the value of 
intensive extracolonic surveillance for resected nonmetastatic colorectal cancer 
and by extension metastasectomy. We reexamined this pessimistic interpretation. 
We evaluate an alternative explanation: insufficient power to detect a 
realistically sized survival benefit that may be clinically meaningful.
METHODS: A microsimulation model of postdiagnosis colorectal cancer was 
constructed assuming an empirically plausible efficacy for metastasectomy and 
thus surveillance. The model was used to predict the large-sample mortality 
reduction expected for each trial and the implied statistical power. A potential 
recurrence imbalance in the FACS trial was investigated. Goodness of fit between 
model predictions and trial results were evaluated. Downstream life expectancy 
was estimated and power calculations performed for future trials evaluating 
surveillance and metastasectomy.
RESULTS: For all 3 trials, the model predicted a mortality reduction of ≤5% and 
power of <10%. The FACS recurrence imbalance likely led to a large relative bias 
(>2.5) in the hazard ratio for overall survival favoring control. After 
adjustment, both COLOFOL and FACS results were consistent with model predictions 
(P>.5). A 2.6 (95% credible interval 0.5-5.1) and 3.6 (95% credible interval 
0.8-7.0) month increase in life expectancy is predicted comparing intensive 
extracolonic surveillance-routine computed tomography scans and carcinoembryonic 
antigen assays-with 1 computed tomography scan at 12 months or no surveillance, 
respectively. An adequately sized surveillance trial is not feasible. A 
metastasectomy trial should randomize at least 200 to 300 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Recent trial results do not warrant de novo skepticism of 
metastasectomy nor targeted extracolonic surveillance. Given the potential for 
clinically meaningful life-expectancy gain and significant uncertainty, a trial 
of metastasectomy is needed.

A Systematic Review of Health Technology Assessments of Chimeric Antigen 
Receptor T-Cell Therapies in Young Compared With Older Patients.

(2)Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation, University of Technology 
Sydney, Sydney, Australia.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to identify sources of variability 
in cost-effectiveness analyses of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) 
therapies, tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel, evaluated by health 
technology assessment (HTA) agencies, focusing on young compared with older 
patients.
METHODS: HTA evaluations in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 
adult diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) were included from Australia, 
Canada, England, Norway, and the United States. Key clinical evidence, economic 
approach, and outcomes (costs, quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios) were summarized.
RESULTS: Fourteen HTA evaluations were identified (5 ALL, 9 DLBCL [4 
tisagenlecleucel, 5 axicabtagene]). Analyses were naive comparisons of 
prospective single-arm studies for the CAR-Ts with retrospective cohort studies 
for the comparators. Key clinical evidence and economic model approaches were 
generally consistent by CAR-T and indication, although outcomes varied. Notably, 
incremental QALYs varied substantially in ALL (3.67-10.6 QALYs gained), whereas 
variation in DLBCL was less (1.21-1.97 [tisagenlecleucel], 1.97-3.40 
[axicabtagene]). Discounting of costs and outcomes varied, with the highest 
QALYs generated for tisagenlecleucel in ALL (10.95) associated with the lowest 
discount rate (1.5%) and vice versa (4.97 QALYs; 5% discount rate). The approach 
to extrapolation of overall survival data varied, even where the same empirical 
data were used.
CONCLUSION: Modeled, long-term treatment benefit in young patients may be 
associated with greater uncertainty compared with adults because of potential 
life-long benefits with cell and gene therapies. This reflects the 
methodological challenges identified by HTA agencies associated with single-arm, 
short-term studies.

Do Cost-Effectiveness Analyses Account for Drug Genericization? A Literature 
Review and Assessment of Implications.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated how health technology assessment (HTA) organizations 
around the world have handled drug genericization (an allowance for future 
generic drug entry and subsequent drug price declines) in their guidelines for 
cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). We also analyzed a large sample of published 
CEAs to examine prevailing practices in the field.
METHODS: We reviewed 43 HTA guidelines to determine whether and how they 
addressed drug genericization in their CEAs. We also selected a sample of 270 
US-based CEAs from the Tufts Medical Center's CEA Registry, restricting the 
sample to studies on pharmaceuticals published from 1991 to 2019 and to analyses 
taking a lifetime time horizon. We determined whether each CEA examined 
genericization (and if so, whether in base case or sensitivity analyses), and 
how inclusion of genericization influenced the estimated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Fourteen (33%) of the 43 HTA guidelines mention genericization for CEAs 
and 4 (9%) recommend that base case analyses include assumptions about future 
drug price changes due to genericization. Most published CEAs (95%) do not 
include assumptions about future generic prices for intervention drugs. Only 2% 
include such assumptions about comparator drugs. Most studies (72%) conduct 
sensitivity analyses on drug prices unrelated to genericization.
CONCLUSIONS: The omission of assumptions about genericization means that CEAs 
may misrepresent the long run opportunity costs for drugs. The field needs 
clearer guidance for when CEAs should account for genericization, and for the 
inclusion of other price dynamics that might influence a drug's 
cost-effectiveness.

OBJECTIVES: Living donor kidney transplantation (LTx) is the preferred treatment 
for patients with end-stage renal disease. Kidney exchange programs (KEPs) 
promote LTx by facilitating exchange of donors among patients who are not 
compatible with their donors. We analyze and maximize the efficacy and 
effectiveness of KEPS from a health value perspective and the health value of 
altruistic donation in KEPs.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model for the health outcomes of patients, which 
was embedded in a discrete event simulation model to assess the effectiveness of 
allocation policies in KEPs. A new allocation policy to maximize health value 
was developed on the basis of integer programing techniques. The evidence-based 
transition probabilities in the Markov model were based on data from the Dutch 
KEP using a variety of econometric models. Scenarios analysis was presented to 
improve robustness.
RESULTS: The efficacy of the Dutch KEP without altruistic donation is reflected 
by the increase in expected discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 
3.23 from 6.42 to 9.65. The present Dutch policy and the policy to maximize the 
number of transplants achieve 63% of the potential efficacy gain (2.11 
discounted QALYs). The new policy achieves 69% of this gain (2.33 discounted 
QALYs). When systematically enrolling altruistic donors in the KEP, the new 
policy increased expected discounted QALYs by 4.05 to 10.27 and reduced 
inequities for patients with blood type O.
CONCLUSIONS: The Dutch KEP can increase health value for patients by more than 
half. An allocation policy that maximizes health outcomes and maximally allows 
altruistic donation can yield significant further improvements.

OBJECTIVES: Since 2015, Zorginstituut Nederland (ZIN) has linked disease 
severity ranges of 0.10 to 0.40, 0.41 to 0.70, and 0.71 to 1.00 with 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) reference values of €20 000, €50 000, and €80 000 per 
quality-adjusted life year gained, respectively. We sought to review whether 
these changes have affected ZIN health technology assessment (HTA) outcomes for 
specialist and outpatient drugs.
METHODS: ZIN recommendations for specialist and outpatient drugs published 
between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2020, that included a pharmacoeconomic 
report were reviewed. Data were extracted on disease severity, proportional 
shortfall calculation, reported WTP reference value, outcomes related to the 
cost-effectiveness of the product, budget impact, and ZIN's recommendation 
including rationale for their advice.
RESULTS: A total of 51 HTAs were included. Of the 20 HTAs published before June 
2015, a total of 9 received positive recommendations, 7 were conditionally 
reimbursed, and 4 received negative recommendations. None reported WTP reference 
values. Of the 31 evaluations published after June 2015, a total of 4 products 
received positive recommendations, 1 was conditionally approved, and 26 received 
negative recommendations initially. Most products (65%) reported disease 
severity to be >0.70.
CONCLUSIONS: Since 2015, most products have fallen within the highest category 
of disease severity. Although pre-2015 outcomes were varied, post-2015 products 
overwhelmingly received negative recommendations, and the proportion of products 
for which price negotiations were recommended has increased. These differences 
in outcomes may result from the introduction of an explicit WTP reference value, 
whether or not in combination with the severity-adjusted ranges, but may also 
reflect other national policy changes in 2015.

Collagen from tilapia skin was extracted and confirmed as type I collagen. 
Collagen was then hydrolyzed with alcalase for 4 h and the released peptides 
were identified. The structure-activity relationship of collagen-released 
peptides showed that proline at position C3 played a key role in improving ACE 
inhibitory activity, while proline at position C2 had a negative effect. 
Collagen peptide release kinetics showed that with the extension of time, the 
number of peptides increased dramatically at first, decreased, and then tended 
to be stable. This indicated that collagen peptides mainly originated from 
primary enzymolysis at the first stage and began to undergo secondary hydrolysis 
in the second stage. Afterwards, secondary enzymolysis was dominant at the third 
stage and finally remained stable at final two stages. Understanding the pattern 
of collagen peptide release kinetics might offer a powerful approach in the 
collagen-peptide food processing industry to better control food safety and 
quality.

BACKGROUND: Simulation models can be used to quantify the projected health 
impact of interventions. Quantifying heterogeneity in these impacts, for example 
by socioeconomic status, is important to understand impacts on health 
inequalities. We aim to disaggregate one type of Markov macro-simulation model, 
the proportional multistate lifetable, ensuring that under business-as-usual 
(BAU) the sum of deaths across disaggregated strata in each time step returns 
the same as the initial non-disaggregated model. We then demonstrate the 
application by deprivation quintiles for New Zealand (NZ), for: hypothetical 
interventions (50% lower all-cause mortality, 50% lower coronary heart disease 
mortality) and a dietary intervention to substitute 59% of sodium with potassium 
chloride in the food supply.
METHODS: We developed a disaggregation algorithm that iteratively rescales 
mortality, incidence and case-fatality rates by time-step of the model to ensure 
correct total population counts were retained at each step. To demonstrate the 
algorithm on deprivation quintiles in NZ, we used the following inputs: overall 
(non-disaggregated) all-cause mortality & morbidity rates, coronary heart 
disease incidence & case fatality rates; stroke incidence & case fatality rates. 
We also obtained rate ratios by deprivation for these same measures. Given 
all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates by deprivation quintile, we derived 
values for the incidence, case fatality and mortality rates for each quintile, 
ensuring rate ratios across quintiles and the total population mortality and 
morbidity rates were returned when averaged across groups. The three 
interventions were then run on top of these scaled BAU scenarios.
RESULTS: The algorithm exactly disaggregated populations by strata in BAU. The 
intervention scenario life years and health adjusted life years (HALYs) gained 
differed slightly when summed over the deprivation quintile compared to the 
aggregated model, due to the stratified model (appropriately) allowing for 
differential background mortality rates by strata. Modest differences in health 
gains (HALYs) resulted from rescaling of sub-population mortality and incidence 
rates to ensure consistency with the aggregate population.
CONCLUSION: Policy makers ideally need to know the effect of population 
interventions estimated both overall, and by socioeconomic and other strata. We 
demonstrate a method and provide code to do this routinely within proportional 
multistate lifetable simulation models and similar Markov models.

OBJECTIVE: Life expectancy can be estimated accurately from a cohort of 
individuals born in the same year and followed from birth to death. However, due 
to the resource-consuming nature of following a cohort prospectively, life 
expectancy is often assessed based upon retrospective death record reviews. This 
conventional approach may lead to potentially biased estimates, in particular 
when estimating life expectancy of rare diseases such as Morquio syndrome A. We 
investigated the accuracy of life expectancy estimation using death records by 
simulating the survival of individuals with Morquio syndrome A under four 
different scenarios.
RESULTS: When life expectancy was constant during the entire period, using death 
data did not result in a biased estimate. However, when life expectancy 
increased over time, as is often expected to be the case in rare diseases, using 
only death data led to a substantial underestimation of life expectancy. We 
emphasize that it is therefore crucial to understand how estimates of life 
expectancy are obtained, to interpret them in an appropriate context, and to 
assess estimation methods within a sensitivity analysis framework, similar to 
the simulations performed herein.

Ambient high temperature is a worldwide trigger for hypertension events. 
However, the effects of heat exposure on hypertension and years of life lost 
(YLL) due to heat remain largely unknown. We conducted a multicenter study in 13 
cities in Jiangsu Province, China, to investigate 9727 individuals who died from 
hypertension during the summer months (May to September) between 2016 and 2017. 
Meteorological observation data (temperature and rainfall) and air pollutants 
(fine particulate matter and ozone) were obtained for each decedent by geocoding 
the residential addresses. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to 
quantify the association between heat and different types of hypertension and 
further explore the modification effect of individual and hospital 
characteristics. Meanwhile, the YLL associated with heat exposure was estimated. 
Our results show that summer heat exposure shortens the YLL of hypertensive 
patients by a total of 14,74 years per month. Of these, 77.9% of YLL was mainly 
due to hypertensive heart disease. YLL due to heat was pronounced for essential 
hypertension (5.1 years (95% empirical confidence intervals (eCI): 4.1-5.8)), 
hypertensive heart and renal disease with heart failure (4.4 years (95% eCI: 
0.9-5.9)), and hypertensive heart and renal disease (unspecified, 3.5 years (95% 
eCI: 1.8-4.5)). Moderate heat was associated with a larger YLL than extreme 
heat. The distance between hospitals and patients and the number of local 
first-class hospitals can significantly mitigate the adverse effect of heat 
exposure on longevity. Besides, unmarried people and those under 65 years of age 
were potentially susceptible groups, with average reduced YLL of 3.5 and 3.9 
years, respectively. Our study reveals that heat exposure increases the 
mortality risk from many types of hypertension and YLL. In the context of 
climate change, if effective measures are not taken, hot weather may bring a 
greater burden of disease to hypertension due to premature death.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bacopa floribunda (BF), a locally available 
plant has been employed traditionally as memory enhancer in Southwestern, 
Nigeria. It has been utilized in traditional and Ayurvedic medicine as brain 
tonic for enhancing memory, anti-aging and forestalling series of psychological 
disorders. However, there is a dearth of scientific information on the 
mechanism(s) of action of important phytochemicals from BF extract on dementia.
AIM OF THE STUDY: Alzheimer's disease, the commonest form of dementia has been 
postulated to triple by 2050 as a result of increase in life expectancy. This 
study therefore assessed and compared the possible mechanism(s) of action of 
flavonoids and saponins from BF on Amyloid beta (Aβ1-42)-induced dementia in 
male BALB/c mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty (80) healthy BALB/c mice divided into 10 groups 
(n = 8) were given a single bilateral ICV injection of Aβ1-42 or normal saline. 
Graded doses of Saponins and flavonoids (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) were used as 
treatment for 21 days. Hippocampal homogenates were assayed for the levels of 
antioxidants, oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory markers. In vitro 
antioxidant activity of flavonoids and saponins were equally assessed using 
standard procedures. The extent of microglial activation was quantified through 
immunohistochemistry procedure.
RESULTS: Aβ1-42 successfully caused a spike in hippocampal levels of MDA, IL1β, 
TNF-α including MPO levels and invariably decreased antioxidant activities. 
Likewise an increase in reactive microglia (microgliosis) was observed. However, 
crude saponins and flavonoids from BF were able to suppress microgliosis, 
oxidative stress and neuroinflammation induced by Aβ1- 42 and were observed to 
be more effective at higher doses of saponins (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) and 
flavonoid (100 mg/kg).
CONCLUSIONS: Phytochemicals from BF efficiently exhibited dose dependent 
alleviation of some symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease.

There is strong evidence supporting the influence of social determinants of 
health (SDOH) on the development and progression of asthma. SDOH are defined as 
conditions in which people are born, grow up, live, work, and age, which 
influence their opportunity to be healthy, risk of illness, and life expectancy. 
The goal of this article was to describe 2 case-based approaches (pediatric and 
adult) to assessing and addressing SDOH in asthma across the life course and in 
community settings. As asthma providers and specialists, the role of SDOH is 
complex in our clinical care; however, it is critical to address social needs 
identified through clinical care for our patients with asthma. 
Clinical-community partnerships, through grant and cost-sharing mechanisms with 
resource agencies, are necessary to ameliorate social needs for patients and 
their communities and have the potential to improve asthma outcomes. Although 
this is a unique and exciting time in health care to promote individual and 
population health, knowledge gaps remain, including best practices to integrate 
holistic SDOH care into the care of patients with asthma.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to calculate the years of life lost (YLL) 
and years of potential life lost (YPLL) due to COVID-19, according to age groups 
in Turkey in the first year of the pandemic and the cost of this burden.
STUDY DESIGN: This is an observational study with quantitative analyses.
METHODS: YLL due to premature deaths was calculated for men and women by 
interpolating the number of deaths and the expected life expectancy. YPLL was 
calculated according to the age 65 years. Productivity loss is an estimation of 
the cost of time lost at work-related activities-in a scenario analysis-using 
predetermined wage rates with the human capital theory.
RESULTS: Men lost 205,177 (67.57%) years of life, whereas women lost 125,330 
(32.43%) years of life. The YLL average age in men was 63.66 ± 14.66 years, and 
the YLL average age in women was 66.07 ± 15.46 years. The average YLL age in men 
was younger than in women (P < 0.001). Men lost 65,180 (70.16%) YPLL, whereas 
women lost 27,723 (29.84%) YPLL. The average YPLL age in women was younger than 
in men (P < 0.001). During one year of the pandemic, premature death cost Turkey 
227,396,694 USD, the cost for one premature death was 14,187 USD, and the cost 
of any year of life lost was 1261 USD.
CONCLUSION: YLL and YPLLs are very closely associated with COVID-19 deaths in 
the country. The economic dimensions of the pandemic with human losses are quite 
high.

BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with 
substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. With currently no 
approved treatment, an effective pharmaceutical intervention for this disease 
must be both clinically- and cost-effective.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the clinical outcomes, 
costs, and quality of life impact of a hypothetical pharmaceutical intervention. 
Lifetime clinical outcomes, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
costs (2020 $US), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and 
economically justifiable prices (EJPs) were quantified. Only patients with 
fibrosis stage F2-F4 were assumed eligible to initiate pharmaceutical treatment.
RESULTS: Over a mean life expectancy of approximately 21 years in the simulated 
cohort, drug treatment reduced liver-related mortality by 6.0% (2.7% absolute 
reduction). Assuming an annual drug cost of $36,000, total discounted medical 
costs were $574,238 and $120,312 for drug and usual care, respectively, with 
discounted QALYs estimated to be 9.452 and 9.272 for the two comparators. This 
yielded an ICER of $2,517,676/QALY gained. The EJP of the drug at an ICER 
threshold of $150,000/QALY gained was $2,633, a 93% reduction from a base case. 
Sensitivity analyses suggest that, without a substantial decrease in the drug 
price, ICERs would exceed $500,000/QALY gained even with the most favorable 
efficacy assumptions.
CONCLUSIONS: For a pharmaceutical intervention to be considered cost-effective 
in the NAFLD fibrosis population, the substantial clinical benefit will need to 
be coupled with a modest annual price. Annual drug costs exceeding $12,000 
likely will not provide reasonable value, even with favorable efficacy. More 
work is needed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle modifications.
