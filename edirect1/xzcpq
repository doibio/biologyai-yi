INTRODUCTION: Physical activity is one of the basic needs of people throughout 
their lives. Physical activity prevents many diseases, including cardiovascular 
diseases, which have the highest mortality rate, both among urban and rural 
populations in Poland. The average life expectancy in Poland and the European 
Union is increasing. The proportion of children and adolescents under the age of 
20 is decreasing slowly but steadily, while the proportion of older people (aged 
65+) in the total population is gradually increasing. According to the forecast 
of the Central Statistical Office, the percentage of older people increased 
rapidly after 2010, and will reach 22.3% in 2030. The number of the elderly will 
increase from 5,134,000 in 2007 to 8,195,000 in 2030. The health situation of 
Poles is less favourable compared to other European Union states. The most 
common health risks are: nicotine, drug addiction, alcoholism and obesity. One 
of the causes of obesity is an unhealthy lifestyle. Lifestyle is a basic 
determinant of human health.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to present research results based on a 
literature review on the importance of physical activity for human health as an 
element of organizing and managing the lifestyle of urban and rural populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive measures should be taken to increase public health 
awareness and promote health education, especially among school-age children and 
youths, and to provide appropriate sports infrastructure in particularly 
neglected rural areas.

Aim: To assess the cost-effectiveness of standard utilization of zoledronic acid 
(ZA) relative to real-world utilization of ZA for bone metastasis (BM) in 
Chinese patients with advanced lung cancer. Materials & methods: A decision 
analytic model was constructed to simulate health benefits and medical costs 
associated with standard and real-world utilization of ZA for BM in Chinese 
patients with advanced lung cancer. Results: Compared with real-world 
utilization of ZA, standard utilization of ZA reduced cumulative risk of 
skeletal-related events (45.7 vs 63.6%), increased quality-adjusted life years 
(0.673 vs 0.626 QALY) and saved cumulated medical costs (¥343,163 vs ¥376,943). 
Conclusion: Standard utilization of ZA dominated real-world utilization of ZA 
for BM in Chinese patients with advanced lung cancer from cost-effectiveness 
perspective.

The Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ) is a widely used measure of body shape 
concerns that was originally designed for use with women but has more recently 
been used with boys and men. The latter use may be problematic, given that no 
previous study has demonstrated sex invariance for BSQ scores. To determine the 
extent to which BSQ scores are sex invariant, we asked Portuguese-speaking women 
( n = 1,613) and men ( n = 871) to complete the full BSQ (34 items). 
Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a hypothesized 32-item model of BSQ 
scores and shorter versions had acceptable fit indices in women and men, 
separately. However, multigroup confirmatory factor analysis showed that these 
BSQ model scores had configural but not metric, scalar, or strict sex 
invariance. Differential item analysis indicated significant item-functioning 
differences on 19 of the 32 retained BSQ items. Thus, BSQ scores are not sex 
invariant, making problematic the results of previous studies that have compared 
latent BSQ scores across sex.

BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib is a multikinase inhibitor of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3, 
and other receptor tyrosine kinases. Pembrolizumab, an antibody targeting PD-1, 
has moderate efficacy in biomarker-unselected endometrial cancer. We aimed to 
assess the combination of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in patients with 
advanced endometrial carcinoma, after establishing the maximum tolerated dose in 
a phase 1b study.
METHODS: In this open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study done at 11 centres in the 
USA, eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had metastatic 
endometrial cancer (unselected for microsatellite instability or PD-L1), had an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, had received no 
more than two previous systemic therapies, had measurable disease according to 
the immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (irRECIST), and 
had a life expectancy of 12 weeks or longer. Patients received 20 mg oral 
lenvatinib daily plus 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks. Treatment 
continued until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxic effects, 
or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint of this interim analysis was the 
proportion of patients with an objective response at week 24 as assessed by 
investigators according to irRECIST in the per-protocol population. This trial 
is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02501096.
FINDINGS: Between Sept 10, 2015, and July 24, 2017, 54 patients were enrolled, 
53 of whom were included in the analysis. At the cutoff date for anti-tumour 
activity data (Dec 15, 2017), median study follow-up was 13·3 months (IQR 
6·7-20·1). 21 (39·6% [95% CI 26·5-54·0]) patients had an objective response at 
week 24. Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 16 (30%) patients, 
and one treatment-related death was reported (intracranial haemorrhage). The 
most frequently reported any-grade treatment-related adverse events were 
hypertension (31 [58%]), fatigue (29 [55%]), diarrhoea (27 [51%]), and 
hypothyroidism (25 [47%]). The most common grade 3 treatment-related adverse 
events were hypertension (18 [34%]) and diarrhoea (four [8%]). No grade 4 
treatment-related adverse events were reported. Five (9%) patients discontinued 
study treatment because of treatment-related adverse events.
INTERPRETATION: Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab showed anti-tumour activity in 
patients with advanced recurrent endometrial cancer with a safety profile that 
was similar to those previously reported for lenvatinib and pembrolizumab 
monotherapies, apart from an increased frequency of hypothyroidism. Lenvatinib 
plus pembrolizumab could represent a new potential treatment option for this 
patient population, and is being investigated in a randomised phase 3 study.

OBJECTIVE: The treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI), with the intention to 
prevent limb loss, is often an intensive and expensive therapy. The aim of this 
study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of endovascular and conservative 
treatment of elderly CLI patients unsuitable for surgery.
METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, data were gathered in 
two Dutch peripheral hospitals. CLI patients aged 70 years or older were 
included in the outpatient clinic. Exclusion criteria were malignant disease, 
lack of language skills, and cognitive impairment; 195 patients were included 
and 192 patients were excluded. After a multidisciplinary vascular conference, 
patients were divided into three treatment groups (endovascular 
revascularization, surgical revascularization, or conservative therapy). 
Subanalyses based on age were made (70-79 years and ≥80 years). The follow-up 
period was 2 years. Cost-effectiveness of endovascular and conservative 
treatment was quantified using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 
euros per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: At baseline, patients allocated to surgical revascularization had 
better health states, but the health states of endovascular revascularization 
and conservative therapy patients were comparable. With an ICER of 
€38,247.41/QALY (∼$50,869/QALY), endovascular revascularization was 
cost-effective compared with conservative therapy. This is favorable compared 
with the Dutch applicable threshold of €80,000/QALY (∼$106,400/QALY). The 
subanalyses also established that endovascular revascularization is a 
cost-effective alternative for conservative treatment both in patients aged 70 
to 79 years (ICER €29,898.36/QALY; ∼$39,765/QALY) and in octogenarians (ICER 
€56,810.14/QALY; ∼$75,557/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown that endovascular revascularization is 
cost-effective compared with conservative treatment of CLI patients older than 
70 years and also in octogenarians. Given the small absolute differences in 
costs and effects, physicians should also consider individual circumstances that 
can alter the outcome of the intervention. Cost-effectiveness remains one of the 
aspects to take into consideration in making a clinical decision.

OBJECTIVE: Long-term data about the incidence of late adverse radiation effects 
(AREs) in pediatric brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with Gamma 
Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) are lacking. This study addresses the incidence of 
late AREs, including cyst formation (CF), chronic encapsulated hematoma (CEH), 
and radiation-induced tumor, in pediatric patients with AVM treated with GKRS.
METHODS: This is a single-institutional study involving pediatric patients with 
AVM who underwent GKRS between 1991 and 2014. Among 201 pediatric patients with 
AVM (age ≤15 years), 189 who had at least 12 months of follow-up were assessed 
in this study. The median treatment volume was 2.2 cm3, and the median marginal 
dose was 20 Gy.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 136 months. During the follow-up period, 
symptomatic radiation-induced perilesional edema was found in 5 patients (3%), 
CFs in 7 patients (4%), CEHs in 7 patients (4%), and radiation-induced tumors in 
2 patients (1%). The cumulative incidences of late AREs including CF, CEH, and 
radiation-induced tumor were 1.2% at 5 years, 5.2% at 8 years, 6.1% at 10 years, 
7.2% at 15 years, and 17.0% at 20 years. In the multivariate analysis, treatment 
volume alone was a significant factor for late AREs (P < 0.001; hazard ratio, 
1.111).
CONCLUSIONS: GKRS is a reasonable treatment option for pediatric AVMs to prevent 
future intracranial hemorrhages, particularly in the eloquent regions. However, 
considerable attention should be paid to late AREs such as CFs, CEHs, and 
radiation-induced tumors because of longer life expectancy in pediatric 
patients.

BACKGROUND: The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in refractory 
cardiac arrest (ECPR) has increased exponentially. ECPR is a resource intensive 
service and its cost effectiveness has yet to be demonstrated. We sought to 
complete a cost analysis with modelling of cost effectiveness and quality of 
life outcomes. We sought to complete a cost analysis with modelling of cost 
effectiveness and quality of life outcomes of patients who have undergone ECPR.
METHODS: Using data on all extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) 
patients at two ECMO centres in Sydney, Australia; we completed a costing 
analysis of ECPR patients. A Markov model of cost, quality of life and survival 
outcomes was developed to examine cost per QALY estimates and incremental cost 
effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was 
completed to assess the probability of cost effectiveness for base case and 
variations.
RESULTS: Sixty-two consecutive ECPR patients were analysed; mean age of 
51.9 ± 13.6 years, 38 (61%) were in hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA). Twenty-five 
patients (40%) survived to hospital discharge; all with a cerebral performance 
category (CPC) of 1 or 2. The mean cost per ECPR patient was AUD 75,165 
(€50,535; ±AUD 75,737). Over 10 years ECPR was estimated to add a mean gain of 
3.0 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) per patient with an incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio (ICER) of AUD 25,212 (€16,890) per QALY, increasing to 4.0 
QALYs and an ICER of AUD 18,829 (€12,614) over a 15-year survival scenario. Mean 
cost per QALY did not differ significantly by OHCA or IHCA.
CONCLUSIONS: ECMO support for refractory cardiac arrests is cost effective and 
compares favourably to accepted cost effectiveness thresholds.

The majority of patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 
will enjoy a life expectancy equivalent to that of unaffected individuals, but 
will remain on life-long treatment with a concomitant requirement for on-going 
hospital interactions for molecular monitoring and drug dispensing. In order to 
determine more accurately the frequency of monitoring required, we performed a 
'real-life' retrospective single-center cohort study of 450 patients with CML in 
at least major molecular remission (MR3) to analyze the risk of loss of MR3 
[defined as at least 2 consecutive real-time quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-qPCR) results >0.1% International Scale (IS)]. Patients who 
achieved sustained MR4 (sMR4, BCR-ABL1 RT-qPCR <0.01% IS for 12 months) had a 
probability of loss of MR3 at 1 and 5 years of 0 and 2.6% (95%CI: 1.2-5.4) 
respectively, compared to 4.4% (95%CI: 1.9-9.8) and 25.4% (95%CI: 16.7-36.7) 
respectively, in those who achieved sustained MR3 (sMR3) but not sMR4 (P<0.001). 
No patient who improved their response to a deep molecular level (at least MR4) 
lost MR3 if they were considered compliant, had no history of resistance and 
remained on standard dose tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). MR4 maintained for at 
least one year represents a secure response threshold for patients with CML, 
after which no MR3 loss occurs if certain conditions are satisfied (standard TKI 
dose, full compliance, and lack of previous TKI resistance). This finding may 
justify reduction of the frequency of hospital interaction, with an associated 
positive impact on quality of life, survivorship, and economic burden to both 
patients and healthcare providers.

The increase in human life expectancy is accompanied by age-related cognitive 
and motor disability, thus raising the demand for strategies toward healthy 
aging. This requires understanding the biology of normal aging and late-life 
functional phenotypes. Genetic model organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, 
can help identifying evolutionary conserved mechanisms underlying aging. 
Longitudinal assessment of motor performance of more than 1000 individual flies 
revealed age-related motor performance decline and specific late-life motor 
disabilities. This allows defining heath- and ill-span and scoring late-life 
quality of individual flies. As in mammals, including humans, onset, duration, 
severity, and progression dynamics of decline are heterogenic and characterized 
by both, progressive worsening and sudden late-life events. Flies either become 
increasingly incapacitated by accumulating disability over multiple days prior 
to death, or they escape disability until few hours prior to death. Both 
late-life trajectories converge into a terminal stage characterized by 
stereotypical signs of functional collapse and death within 3 hours. Drosophila 
can now be used to evaluate life prolonging manipulations in the context of 
late-life quality. High sugar diet increases lifespan and late-life quality, 
whereas lifespan prolonging antioxidant supplementation has either no, or 
negative effects on late-life quality, depending on base diet and gender.

BACKGROUND: Upper airway stimulation (UAS) is a treatment approach for patients 
with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea who cannot adhere to continuous 
positive airway pressure therapy.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate added patient benefit and 
cost-effectiveness of UAS in the German health care system.
METHODS: We used a decision-analytic Markov model to project major adverse 
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (myocardial infarction [MI] or stroke), 
motor vehicle collision (MVC), mortality, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
and costs. The assumed reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index with UAS compared 
to no treatment is based on German real-world data. Other input data were 
derived from the literature, public statistics, and multivariate regression. 
Cost-effectiveness was evaluated in Euros per QALY gained, both discounted at 
3%.
RESULTS: UAS was projected to reduce event risks (10-year relative risk for 
stroke, MI, cardiovascular death, and MVC: 0.76, 0.64, 0.65, and 0.34, 
respectively), and to increase survival by 1.27 years. While the UAS strategy 
incurred an additional 1.02 QALYs within the patient lifetime, there were also 
additional costs of EUR 45,196, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of EUR 44,446 per QALY gained. -Conclusions: In the present model-based 
analysis, UAS therapy provides meaningful benefit to patient-relevant endpoints 
and is a cost-effective therapy in the German setting.

BACKGROUND: For the Korean Burden of Disease (KBD) 2015 study, we have amended 
disability weights for causes of disease adapting the methodology of the KBD 
disability weight 2012 study.
METHODS: We conducted a self-administered web-based survey in Korea using 
ranking five causes of disease. A total of 605 physicians and medical college 
students who were attending in third or fourth grade of a regular course 
performed the survey. We converted the ranked data into paired comparison data 
and ran a probit regression. The predicted probabilities for each cause of 
disease were calculated from the coefficient estimates of the probit regression. 
'Being dead (1)' and 'Full health (0)' were utilized as anchor points to rescale 
the predicted probability on a scale from 0 to 1.
RESULTS: As a result, disability weights for a total of 289 causes of disease 
were estimated. In particular, we calculated the disability weights of 60 causes 
of disease considering severity level. These results show that prejudice about 
the severity of cause of disease itself can affect the estimation of disability 
weight, when estimating the disability weight for causes of disease without 
consideration of severity. Furthermore, we have shown that disability weights 
can be estimated based on a ranking method which can maximize efficiency of data 
collection.
CONCLUSION: Disability weights from this study can be used to estimate 
disability adjusted life year and healthy life expectancy. Furthermore, we 
expected that the use of the ranking method will increase gradually in 
disability weight studies.

BACKGROUND: Injury represents an important aspect of disease that affects 
everyone at some point in their lives. To better understand and prevent these 
injuries, various analytical methods have been developed to assess both the 
magnitude and features of injury burden. In this study, we attempted to estimate 
the injury burden of Korea in 2014 by comparing the prevalence-based approach 
used by the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) team and the World Health 
Organization against an alternative incidence-based approach, and to assess the 
different implications of these measurements.
METHODS: The 10th Korean National Hospital Discharge survey data and causes of 
death statistics in 2014 were used as data sources. Years of life lost (YLL), 
years lived with disability (YLD) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
were calculated using both the incidence- and prevalence-based approaches. The 
Korean Classification of Diseases (KCD) version 5 diagnostic codes were used to 
classify the mechanism of injury.
RESULTS: The prevalence-based injury burden tended to be higher (1,670,229 
DALYs) than the incidence-based injury burden (1,544,467 DALYs). The elderly 
population exhibited a higher prevalence-based YLD and DALY relative to 
incidence-based outcomes. In order of significance, the three most common causes 
of injury as calculated using an incidence-based approach were road injury, 
fall, and self-harm, compared with a prevalence-based method, which identified 
self-harm, road injury, and falls as the most common injuries.
CONCLUSION: An appropriate prevention program is needed for injuries with 
potential to cause long-lasting morbidity. Accordingly, a tailored 
injury-prevention strategy should be developed for each high-risk group.

BACKGROUND: Duration of type 2 diabetes is clinically important. Duration of 
morbidity is an independent and critical predictor of developing its 
complications. This study aims to explore an applicability of a Markov model to 
estimate the duration of diabetes in the Korean population.
METHODS: We constructed the Markov model with two Markov states, diabetes and 
death, for estimation of duration of diabetes. The cycle of the Markov model was 
1 year. Each diabetes onset by 5 years was considered from 30 to 85 years old or 
above. The endpoint of the Markov was 100 years old. Type 2 diabetes was 
operationally defined using the 10th revision of International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and prescriptions of anti-diabetic drugs from the 
National Health Insurance Services-National Sample cohort. In each incident and 
existing prevalence cases, survival probabilities were obtained. Durations of 
diabetes from the Markov model were compared with those from the DisMod II 
program. Reductions of life expectancy due to diabetes were defined as 
differences of life expectancies between diabetic patients and the general 
public. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted using a cure rate and 95% 
confidence interval of survival probability.
RESULTS: The duration of diabetes gradually decreased with incident age in both 
genders. In the early 30s, the duration was the largest at 48.9 and 41.9 years 
in women and men, respectively. In the average incident age group of type 2 
diabetes, the late 50s, the reduction of life expectancy due to diabetes was 
estimated to be about two years in both genders. As annual cure probabilities 
increased, the durations of diabetes were reduced.
CONCLUSION: This study estimated the duration of diabetes using a Markov model. 
The model seems to work well and diabetes could reduce life expectancy by about 
2 years on average. This approach could be useful to estimate the duration of 
illness, calculate disability-adjusted life years, and conduct economic 
evaluation studies on interventions for diabetic patients.

BACKGROUND: It is extremely important to objectively take a view of population 
health to provide useful information to decision makers, health-sector leaders, 
researchers, and informed citizens. This study aims to examine the burden of 
disease in Korea as of 2015, and to study how the burden of disease changes with 
the passage of time.
METHODS: We used results from the Korean National Burden of Disease and Injuries 
Study 2015 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal 
disease burden to derive disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by gender and 
age groups from 2007 to 2015. DALYs were calculated as the sum of the years of 
life lost (YLLs) and the years lived with disability (YLDs).
RESULTS: In 2015, the burden of disease for Korean people was calculated at 
29,476 DALYs per 100,000 population. DALYs caused by low back pain were the 
highest, followed by diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. The burden of disease showed a consistently increasing trend from 2007 
to 2015. Although YLLs have been on the decrease since 2011, the increase in 
YLDs has contributed to the overall rise in DALYs. The DALYs per 100,000 
population in 2015 increased by 28.1% compared to 2007.
CONCLUSION: As for the diseases for which the burden of disease is substantially 
increasing, it is needed to establish appropriate policies in a timely manner. 
The results of this study are expected to be the basis for prioritizing public 
health and health care policies in Korea.

BACKGROUND: Burden of disease can be used to prioritize the healthcare budget 
allocation. We analyzed the research and development (R&D) budget of the 
Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) in 2018 and compared the results with 
those of the 2015 Korean National Burden of Disease (KNBD) study.
METHODS: The 2018 MOHW R&D Project integrated implementation plan was used to 
analyze the R&D budget of the MOHW. The budget was allocated according to the 
KNBD disease group and according to the budget lines. The allocated budget was 
compared with the economic burden and the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) 
in 2015. Also, for budget targets for risk factors, DALYs of attributable risk 
factors were compared with corresponding budgets.
RESULTS: In 2018, the MOHW major R&D budget of USD 435.1 million accounted for 
3% of the total government budget. Within the disease specific R&D budget, 35.9% 
was allocated to communicable disease groups, 64.1% to non-communicable 
diseases, and 0% to injury and violence. Among level 2 disease groups, neoplasm 
was ranked first. Among risk factors, climate change and behavioral risk were 
targeted for R&D.
CONCLUSIONS: It would be difficult to say that current R&D allocations focus to 
minimize the burden of disease. A mismatch was observed between the R&D budget 
and the burden of disease in terms of economic burden and DALYs. There was a 
similar finding for risk factors R&D. A novel approach for allocating government 
R&D funding that is based on the goal of minimizing the disease burden in the 
Korean population should be considered.

Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Korea.

BACKGROUND: Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) means life expectancy (LE) 
reflecting health-related quality of life and is one of the indicators of 
healthy LE. We determined the trends in QALE in Korea by age, gender, 
educational level, and subregion from 2005 to 2013.
METHODS: We applied the Sullivan method to estimate QALE. We calculated QALE 
from 2005 to 2013 by gender and QALE for 2005 and 2010 by educational level at 
the national level. Furthermore, we estimated QALE for 2005, 2008, and 2011 by 
subregion according to metropolitan and provincial levels.
RESULTS: Population health in Korea measured by LE and QALE at age 0 increased 
steadily from 2005 to 2013. Annual percent changes of LE and QALE in men were 
0.52 and 0.73, respectively (P value < 0.05), and those in women were 0.47 and 
0.71, respectively (P value < 0.05). Koreans with a higher educational level had 
longer LE and QALE than those with a lower educational level, but the 
differences in LE and QALE according to educational level narrowed from 2005 to 
2010. The LE and QALE at age 0 for each of the 16 subnational regions in 2011 
increased compared to 2005, but there was still a difference of up to 4.57 years 
in QALE between subnational regions.
CONCLUSION: We showed that QALE could be easily calculated and be an appropriate 
measure for tracking the overall population's health level. The results from 
this study are expected to aid the Ministry of Health of Republic of Korea in 
setting up a goal for the National Health Plan.

Following the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD), 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) have been widely used as a summary 
measure of population health. The DALY metric is a comprehensive measurement of 
population health, enabling comparison among groups. However, the available data 
and reliance on estimates to supplement the data gap require contextualization 
at the national level, and the outcomes of which are more appropriate for 
national policymakers. The Korean National Burden of Disease (KNBD) study was 
initiated by the Research and Development Project of the Ministry of Health and 
Welfare, funded by a 5-year grant from 2013, to contextualize the GBD method to 
the Korean population. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the KNBD 
study with its achievements and challenges and discuss the implications for 
public health policies.

BACKGROUND: Reducing the gaps in health inequality at a regional level and 
improving health equity have been emphasized in Korea, it is essential to 
accurately measure the burden of disease by region. This study aimed to estimate 
years of life lost (YLLs) in 17 Si and Do of Korea from 1997 to 2015 and 
determine the trends of regional differences in health status and disease 
structure.
METHODS: YLL was calculated by subtracting the age at death from the life 
expectancy. Data on the region, gender, and age-stratified cause-specific death 
were obtained from the Korean Statistical Information Service of Statistics 
Korea.
RESULTS: Age-standardized YLLs per 100,000 population decreased by year in all 
regions from 1997 to 2015 by 27.4% (27.5% for men; 27.2% for women). Despite the 
decline in YLLs, the regions with the highest and lowest YLLs did not change 
between 1997 and 2015. The diseases showing regional differences were caused by 
injury, often classified as avoidable mortality. We also confirmed that YLLs 
were higher in the regions with a higher deprivation index.
CONCLUSION: The present study identified that YLLs differed by regions in Korea 
with specific causes. The findings of this study can be used by decision-makers 
to prioritize the reduction of regional gaps in premature deaths.

BACKGROUND: Projection of future trends in disease burden can facilitate setting 
of priorities for health policies and resource allocation. We report here 
projections of disease-specific mortality and the burdens of various diseases in 
Korea from 2016 to 2030.
METHODS: Separate age- and sex-specific projection models for 21 major cause 
clusters from 2016 to 2030 were developed by applying coherent functional data 
models based on historical trends from 2002 to 2015. The age- and sex-specific 
years of life lost (YLL) for each cause cluster were projected based on the 
projected number of deaths. Years lived with disability (YLD) projections were 
derived using the 2015 age- and sex-specific YLD to YLL ratio. The 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) was the sum of YLL and YLD.
RESULTS: The total number of deaths is projected to increase from 275,777 in 
2015 to 421,700 in 2030, while the age-standardized death rate is projected to 
decrease from 586.9 in 2015 to 447.3 in 2030. The largest number of deaths is 
projected to be a result of neoplasms (75,758 deaths for males; 44,660 deaths 
for females), followed by cardiovascular and circulatory diseases (34,795 deaths 
for males; 48,553 deaths for females). The three leading causes of DALYs for 
both sexes are projected to be chronic respiratory diseases, musculoskeletal 
disorders, and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that NCDs will continue to account for the majority 
of the disease burden in Korea in the future.

With population ageing and rise of life expectancy, a progressively increasing 
proportion of patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are 
older adults, including those at extreme chronological age. Increasing amounts 
of data, including randomized clinical trials, have shown that the benefits of 
an early revascularization are maintained also at very old age, resulting in 
improved outcome after an acute coronary event. On the contrary, the optimal 
antiplatelet therapy (APT) remains unclear in these patients, because of both 
safety and efficacy concerns. Indeed, age-related multiple organ dysfunction and
