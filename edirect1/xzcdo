Distant metastases from differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) are a rare event, 
occurring in less than 10% of patients with persistent or recurrent clinical 
disease. About 50% of these patients do respond to radioiodine (RAI) therapy, 
either with complete remission or stabilization of the disease on a long term 
period. Unfortunately, another 50% of these patients are refractory to the 
treatment with RAI, either from the first appearance of distant metastases or 
during follow-up. Overall, these patients represent 4-5 new cases/year/million. 
After the discovery of RAI-refractory disease, the 10-year survival rate is 
usually less than 10% and the mean life expectancy is 3-5 years (Durante et al., 
2006). Tyrosine hinase inhibitors (TKI) have been introduced in the clinical 
practice based on the results of several phase III clinical trial, which brought 
to the approval from competent authorities in USA and Europe of two specific 
drugs: sorafenib and lenvatinib. Both of them, have shown objective response 
rates improving the progression-free survival rates, although no overall 
survival benefit has been demonstrated yet (Schlumberger et al., 2015; Brose 
et al., 2014) [2,3]. The most challenging issue in RAI-refractory thyroid cancer 
is when a patient should be considered RAI-refractory and when to initiate 
treatment with TKI.

Comment in
    Circ Heart Fail. 2017 Sep;10(9):

Increased pulmonary venous pressure secondary to left heart disease is the most 
common cause of pulmonary hypertension (PH). The diagnosis of PH due to left 
heart disease relies on a clinical probability assessment followed by the 
invasive measurements of a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) ≥25 mm Hg and 
mean wedged PAP (PAWP) >15 mm Hg. A combination of mean PAP and mean PAWP 
defines postcapillary PH. Postcapillary PH is generally associated with a 
diastolic pulmonary pressure gradient (diastolic PAP minus mean PAWP) <7 mm Hg, 
a transpulmonary pressure gradient (mean PAP minus mean PAWP) <12 mm Hg, and 
pulmonary vascular resistance ≤3 Wood units (WU). This combination of criteria 
defines isolated postcapillary PH. Postcapillary PH with elevated vascular 
gradients and pulmonary vascular resistance defines combined post- and 
precapillary PH (Cpc-PH). Postcapillary PH is associated with a decreased 
survival in proportion to increased pulmonary vascular gradients, decreased 
pulmonary arterial compliance, and reduced right ventricular function. The 
Cpc-PH subcategory occurs in 12% to 13% of patients with PH due to left heart 
disease. Patients with Cpc-PH have severe PH, with higher diastolic pulmonary 
pressure gradient, transpulmonary pressure gradient, and pulmonary vascular 
resistance and more pronounced ventilatory responses to exercise, lower 
pulmonary arterial compliance, depressed right ventricular ejection fraction, 
and shorter life expectancy than isolated postcapillary PH. Cpc-PH bears 
similarities to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Whether Cpc-PH is amenable to 
therapies targeting the pulmonary circulation remains to be tested by properly 
designed randomized controlled trials.

Nutritional counseling as part of the Osteoporosis Liaison Service(OLS)should 
provide active nutritional counseling and lifestyle guidance by referring to the 
detailed methods for conducting "nutritional status assessments", an item of 
OLS-7, a detailed activity outcome measure of the OLS. After conducting adequate 
nutritional assessments, the goals for each stage of behavior change should be 
established, aiming to set roughly one goal for a specified period of time and 
increasing the goals once improvements have been made. Incorporating feedback in 
the next improvement plan becomes very important. Good nutritional counseling 
will surely lead to achieving the OLS goals(improvement in treatment rates and 
treatment continuation rates). Moreover, it will contribute to decreasing the 
number of patients with fractures, eliminating sequential fractures and 
prolonging a healthy life expectancy in Japan.

INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary artery sarcoma (PAS) is a rare tumor, whose therapeutic 
approach is mainly based on surgery, either pneumonectomy or pulmonary 
endarterectomy (PEA). The prognosis reported in published series is very poor, 
with survival of 1.5 months without any kind of treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2010 to January 2016, 1027 patients were 
referred to our hospital for symptoms of acute or chronic pulmonary 
thromboembolic disease. Twelve patients having a confirmed diagnosis of PAS 
underwent PEA. Median age was 64.5 years. Most patients had a long history of 
symptoms, having a median time of 7.5 months from onset of symptoms to surgery.
RESULTS: Following PEA and cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, 10 patients received 
conventional chemotherapy with doxorubicin and ifosfamide, starting at a median 
of 42 days from surgery. Four patients also received radiotherapy. Four patients 
have died due to disease progression, while 7 are still alive, with 5 being 
disease-free at 4-55+ months from diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PAS, a multimodal approach including PEA, CT, and 
RT is feasible but it should be evaluated individually, according to the tumor 
extension and the patient's clinical condition. Apart from improving quality of 
life mainly by reducing or delaying symptoms due to PH, it may improve life 
expectancy.

Alpine ski racing is known to be a sport with a high risk of injuries. Because 
most studies have focused mainly on top-level athletes and on traumatic 
injuries, limited research exists about injury risk factors among youth ski 
racers. The aim of this study was to determine the intrinsic risk factors 
(anthropometrics, biological maturity, physical fitness, racing technique) for 
injury among youth alpine ski racers. Study participants were 81 youth ski 
racers attending a ski boarding school (50 males, 31 females; 9-14 years). A 
prospective longitudinal cohort design was used to monitor sports-related risk 
factors over two seasons and traumatic (TI) and overuse injuries (OI). At the 
beginning of the study, anthropometric characteristics (body height, body 
weight, sitting height, body mass index); biological maturity [status age at 
peak height velocity (APHV)]; physical performance parameters related to jump 
coordination, maximal leg and core strength, explosive and reactive strength, 
balance and endurance; and ski racing technique were assessed. Z score 
transformations normalized the age groups. Multivariate binary logistic 
regression (dependent variable: injury yes/no) and multivariate linear 
regression analyses (dependent variable: injury severity in total days of 
absence from training) were calculated. T-tests and multivariate analyses of 
variance were used to reveal differences between injured and non-injured 
athletes and between injury severity groups. The level of significance was set 
to p < 0.05. Relatively low rates of injuries were reported for both traumatic 
(0.63 TI/athlete) and overuse injuries (0.21 OI/athlete). Athletes with higher 
body weight, body height, and sitting height; lower APHV values; better core 
flexion strength; smaller core flexion:extension strength ratio; shorter drop 
jump contact time; and higher drop jump reactive strength index were at a lower 
injury risk or more vulnerable for fewer days of absence from training. However, 
significant differences between injured and non-injured athletes were only 
observed with respect to the drop jump reactive strength index. Regular 
documentation of anthropometric characteristics, biological maturity and 
physical fitness parameters is crucial to help to prevent injury in youth ski 
racing. The present findings suggest that neuromuscular training should be 
incorporated into the training regimen of youth ski racers to prevent injuries.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this article was to review recent guideline 
recommendations on glycemic target, glucose monitoring, and therapeutic 
strategies, while providing practical recommendations for the management of 
medical and surgical patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) admitted to critical 
and non-critical care settings.
RECENT FINDINGS: Studies evaluating safety and efficacy of insulin pump therapy, 
continuous glucose monitoring, electronic glucose management systems, and closed 
loop systems for the inpatient management of hyperglycemia are described. Due to 
the increased prevalence and life expectancy of patients with type 1 diabetes, a 
growing number of these patients require hospitalization every year. Inpatient 
diabetes management is complex and is best provided by a multidisciplinary 
diabetes team. In the absence of such resource, providers and health care staff 
must become familiar with the features of this condition to avoid complications 
such as severe hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, hypoglycemia, or glycemic 
variability. We reviewed most recent guidelines and relevant literature in the 
topic to provide practical recommendations for the inpatient management of 
patients with T1D.

A Hopeful Prospect of Riociguat as a Soluble Guanylate Cyclase Stimulator for 
Management of Pressure Ulcers.

BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcer remains as a common problem, especially developed in 
disabled patients and hence, subjected to continuous pressure for prolonged 
periods of time. Most of the studies investigating the preventive and 
therapeutic approaches have focused on wound cleansing, dressing and supportive 
strategies, as well as pharmacological therapy including zinc sulphate, vitamin 
A or phenytoin. Despite such efforts, pressure ulcer continues to impair the 
life quality and expectancy. Thus involving in the paradigm shift in biomedical 
studies, the recent ones focus on biological signaling pathways involving nitric 
oxide (NO)- soluble guanylatecyclase (sGC)- cyclic guanosine monophosphate 
(cGMP) contributing in vasodilation, reperfusion and oxygen delivery.
METHODS: Literatures review focusing on NO/sGC/cGMP pathway was performed as 
well as seeking themolecular biology aspects inKyoto Encyclopedia of genes and 
genomes (KEGG).
RESULTS: NO is an important signaling molecule activating sGC and cGMP 
production, which is a mediator of vasodilation and platelet inhibition. 
Considering the subject, it could be hypothesized that the application of sGC 
stimulators and activators is a very curious strategy for pressure ulcer 
healing. It is well known that pressure and shear forces usually produce the 
blood vessel obstruction, inducing ischemia and tissue necrosis and in 
pathologic states, damaged endothelium leads to a reduced synthesis of NO and 
inadequate oxygen supply contributing to delayed wound healing. Riociguat is the 
first FDA approved agent of new class of sGC stimulators, involving in 
activation of sGC both in presence and absence of NO.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this review confirm that Riociguat could start a new 
therapeutic approach for pressure ulcer treatment even with dysfunctional 
endothelium.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of smoking on premature death in the 
Netherlands and the difference between causes of death for smokers and 
non-smokers.
DESIGN: Observational cohort study.
METHOD: Data on smoking behaviour were obtained from 40,000 people who 
participated in the CBS (Statistics Netherlands) health survey between 
2001-2006. These data were linked to data on death and cause of death for the 10 
years following this questionnaire. Hazard ratios were calculated for premature 
deaths among smokers, classified into smoking intensity, and ex-smokers as 
compared with those who had never smoked. These data were used to estimate 
cumulative death of smokers versus non-smokers.
RESULTS: The hazard ratio for premature death was 3.8 (95% CI: 3.2-4.5) for 
heavy smokers, 2.6 (95% CI: 2.2-3.0) for moderate smokers and 1.7 (95% CI: 
1.3-2.3) for light smokers. Lifelong heavy smokers had a chance of 23% of dying 
before the age of 65. For moderate and light smokers and for non-smokers, the 
chance was respectively 16, 11 and 7%. For half of all people who died 
relatively young, cancer was the underlying cause of death. This was mainly lung 
cancer for smokers. Heavy smokers are estimated to have lost 13 years of life, 
moderate smokers 9 and light smokers 5. Smoking cessation at any age still 
benefited health. Ex-smokers who had quit before an approximate age of 35 had 
the same life expectancy as lifelong non-smokers.
CONCLUSION: An estimated four in ten premature deaths can be attributed to 
smoking in the Netherlands. Cancer is the predominant cause of death amongst 
smokers. Smoking cessation increases life expectancy. Therefore, the earlier a 
smoker stops, the better.

Studies examining how diet affects mortality risk over age typically 
characterise mortality using parameters such as aging rates, which condense how 
much and how quickly the risk of dying changes over time into a single measure. 
Demographers have suggested that decoupling the tempo and the magnitude of 
changing mortality risk may facilitate comparative analyses of mortality 
trajectories, but it is unclear what biologically meaningful information this 
approach offers. Here, we determine how the amount and ratio of protein and 
carbohydrate ingested by female Drosophila melanogaster affects how much 
mortality risk increases over a time-standardised life-course (the shape of 
aging) and the tempo at which animals live and die (the pace of aging). We find 
that pace values increased as flies consumed more carbohydrate but declined with 
increasing protein consumption. Shape values were independent of protein intake 
but were lowest in flies consuming ~90 μg of carbohydrate daily. As protein 
intake only affected the pace of aging, varying protein intake rescaled 
mortality trajectories (i.e. stretched or compressed survival curves), while 
varying carbohydrate consumption caused deviation from temporal rescaling (i.e. 
changed the topography of time-standardised survival curves), by affecting pace 
and shape. Clearly, the pace and shape of aging may vary independently in 
response to dietary manipulation. This suggests that there is the potential for 
pace and shape to evolve independently of one another and respond to different 
physiological processes. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for 
independent variation in pace and shape, may offer insight into the factors 
underlying diverse mortality trajectories.

PURPOSE: Preventive breast surgery is offered to unaffected BRCA mutation 
carriers to prevent breast cancer incidence and mortality. The clinical benefit 
of preventive mastectomy can be measured in several ways, including extension of 
life expectancy (mean years of life gained) and by estimating the probability of 
surviving until age 80. We sought to estimate the expected benefit of a 
preventive mastectomy at various ages, using these indices of mortality, by 
simulating hypothetical cohorts of women.
METHODS: The age-specific annual risks of developing breast cancer were used to 
estimate the actuarial risk of developing breast cancer by age 80 for women with 
a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. The probability of developing breast cancer before 
age 80 was then modified to include competing causes of death, including from 
ovarian cancer. The mortality rate from breast cancer after a diagnosis of 
breast cancer was set at 2% annually for the first 10 years and then 1% annually 
for years ten to twenty. The incidence rate and mortality rate from ovarian 
cancer were based on published literature. We assumed that preventive mastectomy 
was associated with complete protection against subsequent breast cancer. A 
series of simulations was conducted to evaluate the reduction in the probability 
of death (from all causes) until age 80, according to the age at mastectomy.
RESULTS: The actuarial risk of developing breast cancer until age 80 was 
estimated to be 70.8%. The actual risk (incorporating competing risks) was 
64.0%. The probability of being alive at age 80 by having a mastectomy at age 25 
increased by 8.7% (from 42.7 to 51.3%). The estimated benefit declined with age 
at mastectomy; for surgery done at age 50 the improvement in survival to age 80 
was much more modest (2.8% at age 80, from 42.7 to 45.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Among BRCA mutation carriers, the mortality benefit of preventive 
mastectomy at age 25 is substantial, but the expected benefit declines rapidly 
with increasing age at surgery.

Erratum in
    Pharmacoeconomics. 2018 Feb 24;:

The manufacturer of olaratumab (Lartruvo®), Eli Lilly & Company Limited, 
submitted evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of this drug, in 
combination with doxorubicin, for untreated advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) 
not amenable to surgery or radiotherapy, as part of the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Single Technology Appraisal process. The 
Peninsula Technology Assessment Group, commissioned to act as the Evidence 
Review Group (ERG), critically reviewed the company's submission. Clinical 
effectiveness evidence for the company's analysis was derived from an 
open-label, randomised controlled trial, JGDG. The analysis was based on a 
partitioned survival model with a time horizon of 25 years, and the perspective 
was of the UK National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services. Costs 
and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per year. Given the available evidence, 
olaratumab is likely to meet NICE's end-of-life criteria. To improve the cost 
effectiveness of olaratumab, the company offered a discount through a Commercial 
Access Agreement (CAA) with the NHS England. When the discount was applied, the 
mean base-case and probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
for olaratumab plus doxorubicin versus the standard-of-care doxorubicin were 
£46,076 and £47,127 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, respectively; 
the probability of this treatment being cost effective at the willingness-to-pay 
threshold of £50,000 per QALY gained, applicable to end-of-life treatments, was 
0.54. The respective ICERs from the ERG's analysis were approximately 
£60,000/QALY gained, and the probability of the treatment being cost effective 
was 0.21. In August 2017, the NICE Appraisal Committee recommended olaratumab in 
combination with doxorubicin for this indication for use via the UK Cancer Drugs 
Fund under the agreed CAA until further evidence being collected in the ongoing 
phase III trial-ANNOUNCE-becomes available in December 2020.

A 52-year-old man with a past medical history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 
in remission developed progressive shortness of breath over a two-month period. 
He was initially treated with dasatinib for four years, until developing 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with pleural effusions. His symptoms 
improved after stopping dasatinib. He was then switched to bosutinib for 
approximately one year, which was then stopped before admission due to worsening 
shortness of breath. His initial workup showed bilateral pleural effusions with 
severe PAH and cor pulmonale. He had symptomatic improvement with PAH-specific 
therapy following discontinuation of the bosutinib. The life expectancy of CML 
patients has increased in the era of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and 
managing adverse events (AEs) of the TKIs and improving quality of life are 
becoming more important. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) and pleural effusions are 
rarely reported AEs of bosutinib. More reports with PH and pleural effusions 
arising after bosutinib use in patients previously treated with dasatinib is 
furthermore concerning. In this era with novel chemotherapeutic agents, 
physicians ought to be weary of the significant morbidity implicated by these 
agents in the lives of patients.

Palliative care in neuromuscular diseases.

de Visser M(1), Oliver DJ.

bTizard Centre, Cornwallis North East, University of Kent, Canterbury, United 
Kingdom.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of 
life of patients and their families facing the problem associated with 
life-threatening illness. Neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) are characterized by 
progressive muscle weakness, leading to pronounced and incapacitating physical 
disabilities. Most NMDs are not amenable to curative treatment and would thus 
qualify for palliative care. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a relentlessly 
progressive disease, which leads to death about 2 years after onset due to 
respiratory muscle weakness. Increasingly, neurologists caring for these 
patients learn to apply the principles of palliative care. However, this does 
not yet apply to other well known and frequently occurring NMDs.
RECENT FINDINGS: There is sparse literature on palliative care in NMDs such as 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, muscular dystrophies, some 
congenital myopathies, Pompe's disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1. These NMDs 
are often associated with imminent respiratory insufficiency and/or heart 
failure leading to a reduced life expectancy. Reasons for underutilization may 
include misconceptions about palliative care amongst patients, family carers and 
healthcare professionals or lack of awareness of the usefulness of this approach 
in these severely affected patients and the possibilities of integration of 
palliative principles into care for children and adults with NMDs.
SUMMARY: There is an urgent need for increased attention to the development of 
palliative care in chronic progressive neuromuscular diseases associated with 
increasing functional incapacities and premature death. This will require 
education and training of the healthcare professionals, involvement of patient 
associations and funding to perform research.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of the pharmacogenetic-guided dosing of 
warfarin (PGx), when compared to the current dosing strategy.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the impact of the 
genotypingguided warfarin dosing in a hypothetical cohort of patients. The model 
was based on the percentage of time patients spent within the therapeutic 
international normalized ratio (INR) range (PTTR). PTTR estimates and genotype 
distribution were derived from a cohort of patients (n = 206) treated in the 
Veteran Affairs Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS) and from results of other 
research study. Costs, utilities and event probability data were obtained from 
the literature. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to 
explore the range of plausible results. Willingness to pay was established at 
$50,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: According to our model, the PGx strategy showed a QALY increase of 
0.0021, with an increase in total cost of $272. This corresponds to an 
incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of $127,501, ranging from $95,690 to 
$148,611. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the ICURs were more 
sensitive to the cost of genotyping and the effect of genotyping on the PTTR.
CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that the warfarin PGx was not superior to the 
standard of care dosing strategy in terms of cost-utility.

OBJETIVO: Evaluar la costo-utilidad de la dosificación de warfarina basada en 
farmacogenómica (PGx), comparada con a la estrategia tradicional de 
dosificación.
MÉTODOS: Un modelo de Markov fue desarrollado para evaluar el impacto del PGx de 
warfarina en un cohorte hipotético de pacientes. El modelo fue basado en el 
porcentaje de tiempo en que los pacientes se mantienen dentro del rango 
terapéutico de INR (PTTR). Estimados del PTTR y de la distribución de genotipos 
fueron obtenidas de un cohorte de pacientes (n = 206) tratados en el Veteran 
Affairs Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS) y de resultados de otros estudios 
clínicos. Costos, utilidades y la probabilidad de que ocurrieran los eventos 
fueron obtenidas de la literatura. Se llevó a cabo un análisis de sensibilidad 
para explorar el rango de posibles resultados y se estableció una disposición a 
pagar de $50,000 por QALY ganado.
RESULTADOS: Según nuestro modelo, la estrategia basada en PGx demostró un 
aumento en QALY de 0.0021, con un aumento en costos total $272. Esto corresponde 
a un aumento en la relación de costo-utilidad incremental (ICUR) de $127,501, 
variando desde $95,690 a $148,611. El análisis de sensibilidad demostró que el 
ICUR fue más sensitivo al costo de genotipaje y al efecto del genotipaje en el 
PTTR.
CONCLUSIÓN: Nuestro modelo sugiere que el PGx de warfarina no fue superior a la 
estrategia tradicional de dosificación en términos de costo-utilidad.

ECM-Related Myopathies and Muscular Dystrophies: Pros and Cons of Protein 
Therapies.

Extracellular matrix (ECM) myopathies and muscular dystrophies are a group of 
genetic diseases caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins that provide 
critical links between muscle cells and the extracellular matrix. These include 
structural proteins of the ECM, muscle cell receptors, enzymes, and 
intracellular proteins. Loss of adhesion within the myomatrix results in 
progressive muscle weakness. For many ECM muscular dystrophies, symptoms can 
occur any time after birth and often result in reduced life expectancy. There 
are no cures for the ECM-related muscular dystrophies and treatment options are 
limited to palliative care. Several therapeutic approaches have been explored to 
treat muscular dystrophies including gene therapy, gene editing, exon skipping, 
embryonic, and adult stem cell therapy, targeting genetic modifiers, modulating 
inflammatory responses, or preventing muscle degeneration. Recently, protein 
therapies that replace components of the defective myomatrix or enhance muscle 
and/or extracellular matrix integrity and function have been explored. 
Preclinical studies for many of these biologics have been promising in animal 
models of these muscle diseases. This review aims to summarize the ECM muscular 
dystrophies for which protein therapies are being developed and discuss the 
exciting potential and possible limitations of this approach for treating this 
family of devastating genetic muscle diseases. © 2017 American Physiological

BACKGROUND: We sought to examine the relationship between child specific health 
aid (CHA) and burden of disease. Based on existing evidence, we hypothesized 
that foreign aid for child health would not be proportional to burden of 
disease.
METHODS: In order to examine CHA and burden of disease, we obtained estimates of 
these parameters from established sources. Estimates of disability adjusted life 
years (DALYs) in children (0-5 years) were obtained from the World Health 
Organization for 2000 and 2012. The 10 most burdensome disease categories in 
each continent, excluding high-income countries, were identified for study. 
Descriptions of all foreign aid commitments between 1996 and 2009 were obtained 
from AidData, and an algorithm to designate the target diseases of the 
commitments was constructed. Data were examined in scatterplots for trends.
RESULTS: The most burdensome childhood diseases varied by continent. In all 
continents, newborn diseases, vaccine-preventable diseases (lower respiratory 
diseases, measles, meningitis, tetanus, and pertussis), and diarrheal diseases 
ranked within the four most burdensome diseases. Infectious diseases such as 
malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV were also among the ten most burdensome diseases 
in sub-Saharan Africa, and non-communicable diseases were associated with much 
of the burden in the other continents. CHA grew from $7.4 billion in 1996 to 
$17.7 billion in 2009 for our study diseases. Diarrheal diseases and 
malnutrition received the most CHA as well as the most CHA per DALY. CHA 
directed at HIV increased dramatically over our study period, from $227,000 in 
1996 to $3.4 billion in 2008. Little aid was directed at injuries such as 
drowning, car accidents, and fires, as well as complex medical diseases such as 
leukemia and endocrine disorders.
CONCLUSION: CHA has grown significantly over the last two decades. There is no 
clear relationship between CHA and burden of disease. This report provides a 
description of foreign aid for child health, and hopes to inform policy and 
decision-making regarding foreign aid.

BACKGROUND: Less intensive treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction (HFrEF) may be appropriate for patients in long-term care settings 
because of limited life expectancy, frailty, comorbidities, and emphasis on 
quality of life.
METHODS: We compared treatment patterns between REasons for Geographic And 
Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study participants discharged to 
long-term care versus home following HFrEF hospitalizations. We examined medical 
records and Medicare pharmacy claims for 147 HFrEF hospitalizations among 80 
participants to obtain information about discharge disposition and medication 
prescriptions and fills.
RESULTS: Discharge to long-term care followed 22 of 147 HFrEF hospitalizations 
(15%). Participants discharged to long-term care were more likely to be 
prescribed beta-blockers and less likely to be prescribed aldosterone receptor 
antagonists and hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate (96%, 14%, and 5%, 
respectively) compared to participants discharged home (81%, 22%, and 23%, 
respectively). The percentages of participants discharged to long-term care and 
home who had claims for filled prescriptions were similar for beta-blockers (68% 
versus 66%) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor 
blockers (ACEI/ARBs) (45% versus 47%) after 1 year. Smaller percentages of 
participants discharged to long-term care had claims for filled prescriptions of 
other medications compared to participants discharged home (diuretics: long-term 
care-50%, home-72%; hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate: long-term care-5%, 
home-23%; aldosterone receptor antagonists: long-term care-5%, home-23%).
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in medication prescriptions and fills among individuals 
with HFrEF discharged to long-term care versus home may reflect prioritization 
of some medical therapies over others for patients in long-term care.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate epidemiologic and 
prognostic factors relevant to the treatment of loco-regionally advanced gastric 
cancer (GC).
METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-five patients with GC were identified in Uppsala 
County between 2000 and 2009. Patient records were analyzed for loco-regionally 
advanced GC defined as tumor with peritoneal involvement, excluding serosal 
invasion from the primary tumor only, at primary diagnosis or during follow-up. 
The presence or not of distant metastasis (DM), including hematogenous 
metastases (e.g., liver, lung, and bone) and/or distant lymph node metastases, 
was also analyzed. The Cox proportional hazard model was used for multivariate 
analysis of factors influencing survival.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients (47% of all patients with GC; median 
age 70.5 years) had loco-regionally advanced disease, corresponding to an 
incidence of 3.8 per 100,000 person-years. Forty-one percent of these also had 
DM. Median overall survival (mOS) from the time of the diagnosis of 
loco-regionally advanced disease was 4.8 months for the total patient cohort, 
5.1 months for the subgroup of patients without DM, and 4.7 months for the 
subgroup with DM. There was no significant difference in mOS between the 
subgroups with synchronous versus metachronous loco-regionally advanced GC: 
4.8 months (range 0.0-67.4) versus 4.7 months (range 0.0-28.3). Using 
multivariate Cox analysis, positive prognostic factors for survival were good 
performance status at diagnosis and treatment with palliative chemotherapy 
and/or radiotherapy. Synchronous DM was a negative prognostic factor. The mOS 
did not differ when comparing the time period 2000-2004 (5.1 months, range 
0-67.4) with the period 2005-2009 (4.0 months, range 0.0-28.3).
CONCLUSION: Peritoneal involvement occurred in almost half of the patients with 
GC in this study and was associated with short life expectancy. New treatment 
strategies are warranted.

The progressive improvement of lymphoma therapies has led to a significant 
prolongation of patient survival and life expectancy. However, lymphoma 
survivors are at high risk of experiencing a range of early and late adverse 
effects associated with the extent of treatment exposure. Among these, second 
malignancies and cardiopulmonary diseases can be fatal, and neurocognitive 
dysfunction, endocrinopathy, muscle atrophy, and persistent fatigue can affect 
patients' quality of life for decades after treatment. Early recognition and 
reduction of risk factors and proper monitoring and treatment of these 
complications require well-defined follow-up criteria, close coordination among 
specialists of different disciplines, and a tailored model of survivorship care. 
We have summarized the major aspects of therapy-related effects in lymphoma 
patients, reviewed the current recommendations for follow-up protocols, and 
described a new hospital-based model of survivorship care provision from a 
recent multicenter Italian experience.
