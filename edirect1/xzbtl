OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare treatment profiles 
including both health outcomes and process characteristics in Parkinson disease 
using best-worst scaling (BWS), time trade-off (TTO), and visual analogue scales 
(VAS).
METHODS: From the model comprising of seven attributes with three levels, six 
unique profiles were selected representing process-related factors and health 
outcomes in Parkinson disease. A Web-based survey (N = 613) was conducted in a 
general population to estimate process-related utilities using profile-based BWS 
(case 2), multiprofile-based BWS (case 3), TTO, and VAS. The rank order of the 
six profiles was compared, convergent validity among methods was assessed, and 
individual analysis focused on the differentiation between pairs of profiles 
with methods used.
RESULTS: The aggregated health-state utilities for the six treatment profiles 
were highly comparable for all methods and no rank reversals were identified. On 
the individual level, the convergent validity between all methods was strong; 
however, respondents differentiated less in the utility of closely related 
treatment profiles with a VAS or TTO than with BWS. For TTO and VAS, this 
resulted in nonsignificant differences in mean utilities for closely related 
treatment profiles.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that all methods are equally able to measure 
process-related utility when the aim is to estimate the overall value of 
treatments. On an individual level, such as in shared decision making, BWS 
allows for better prioritization of treatment alternatives, especially if they 
are closely related. The decision-making problem and the need for explicit 
trade-off between attributes should determine the choice for a method.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analysis of pediatric vaccines for infectious 
diseases often requires quality-of-life (utility) weights.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate how utility weights have been elicited and used in 
this context.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of studies published between January 
1990 and July 2013 that elicited or used utility weights in cost-effectiveness 
analyses of vaccines for pediatric populations. The review focused on vaccines 
for 17 infectious diseases and is presented following the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology.
RESULTS: A total of 6410 titles and abstracts and 225 full-text articles were 
reviewed. Of those selected for inclusion (n = 101), 15 articles described the 
elicitation of utility weights and 86 described economic modeling studies using 
utilities. Various methods were used to generate utilities, including time 
trade-off, contingent valuation, and willingness to pay, as well as a 
preference-based measure with associated value sets, such as the EuroQol 
five-dimensional questionnaire or the Health Utilities Index. In modeling 
studies, the source of utilities used was often unclear, poorly reported, or 
based on weak underlying evidence. We found no articles that reported on the 
elicitation or use of utilities in diphtheria, polio, or tetanus.
CONCLUSIONS: The scarcity of appropriate utility weights for vaccine-preventable 
infectious diseases in children and a lack of standardization in their use in 
economic assessments limit the ability to accurately assess the benefits 
associated with interventions to prevent infectious diseases. This is an issue 
that should be of concern to those making decisions regarding the prevention and 
treatment of infectious childhood illnesses.

BACKGROUND: Dedicated units for the care of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have 
been submitted to economic evaluations; however, the results have not been 
systematically presented.
OBJECTIVE: To identify and summarize economic outcomes of studies on hospital 
units dedicated to the initial care of patients with suspected or confirmed ACS.
METHODS: A systematic review of literature to identify economic evaluations of 
chest pain unit (CPU), coronary care unit (CCU), or equivalent units was done. 
Two search strategies were used: the first one to identify economic evaluations 
irrespective of study design, and the second one to identify randomized clinical 
trials that reported economic outcomes. The following databases were searched: 
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and National Health Service (NHS)Economic Evaluation 
Database. Data extraction was performed by two independent reviewers. Costs were 
inflated to 2012 values.
RESULTS: Search strategies retrieved five partial economic evaluations based on 
observational studies, six randomized clinical trials that reported economic 
outcomes, and five model-based economic evaluations. Overall, cost estimates 
based on observational studies and randomized clinical trials reported 
statistically significant cost savings of more than 50% with the adoption of CPU 
care instead of routine hospitalization or CCU care for suspected 
low-to-intermediate risk patients with ACS (median per-patient cost US 
$1,969.89; range US $1,002.12-13,799.15). Model-based economic evaluations 
reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below US $ 
50,000/quality-adjusted life-year for all comparisons between intermediate care 
unit, CPU, or CCU with routine hospital admissions. This finding was sensible to 
myocardial infarction probability.
CONCLUSIONS: Published economic evaluations indicate that more intensive care is 
likely to be cost-effective in comparison to routine hospital admission for 
patients with suspected ACS.

Use, Australia.

BACKGROUND: Heroin use carries the highest burden of disease of any drug of 
dependence. The study aimed to determine mortality rates of the Australian 
Treatment Outcome Study cohort over the period 2001-2015, and the years of 
potential life lost (YPLL).
METHODS: The cohort consisted of 615 heroin users. Crude mortality rates per 
1000 person years (PY) and Standardised Mortality Ratios (SMR) were calculated. 
YPLL were calculated using two criteria: years lost prior to age 65, and years 
lost prior to average life expectancy.
RESULTS: The cohort was followed for 7,790.9 PY. At 2015, 72 (11.7%) of the 
cohort were deceased, with a crude mortality rate of 9.2 per 1000 PYs. Neither 
age nor gender associated with mortality. The SMR was 10.2 (males 7.3, females 
17.2), matched for age, gender and year of death. The most common mortality 
cause was opioid overdose (52.8%). Using the<65 years criterion, there were 
1988.3 YPLL, with a mean of 27.6 (males 27.6, females 27.7). Using the average 
life expectancy criterion, there were 3135.1 YPLL, with a mean of 43.5 (males 
41.9, females 46.3). Accidental overdose (<65 yr 63.0%, average life expectancy 
63.7%) and suicide (<65 yr 12.8%, average life expectancy 13.3%) accounted for 
three quarters of YPLL where cause of death was known.
CONCLUSIONS: YPLL associated with heroin use was a quarter of a century, or 
close to half a century, depending on the criteria used. Given the prominent 
role of overdose and suicide, the majority of these fatalities, and the 
associated YPLL, appear preventable.

The increasing number of total knee arthroplasties, in combination with the 
population's longer life expectancy, has led to a greater number of long-term 
complications. These add to the poor bone quality of elderly patients and often 
culminate in periprosthetic fractures. This complex orthopedic problem has a 
great diversity of clinical presentation. It may affect any of the bones in the 
knee and, because of the difficulty in finding solutions, may lead to disastrous 
outcomes. Its treatment requires that orthopedists should have broad knowledge 
both of arthroplasty techniques and of osteosynthesis, as well as an elaborate 
therapeutic arsenal including, for example, access to a bone bank.

of Korea, Seoul, Korea.

BACKGROUND: Poor vessel quality and limited life expectancy in the elderly may 
make arteriovenous fistula (AVF) less ideal than arteriovenous graft (AVG) or 
catheter for vascular access (VA) in hemodialysis (HD).
METHODS: A total of 946 adult incident HD patients from clinical research center 
registry for end-stage renal disease prospective cohort in South Korea were 
analyzed for outcomes with AVF and AVG.
RESULTS: Overall, AVF was associated with better patient survival only in male 
(p < 0.001) and diabetic (p = 0.004) patients, although it was superior to AVG 
in access patency, regardless of diabetes mellitus status and gender. AVG (vs. 
AVF; hazard ratio (HR) 2.282; 95% CI 1.071-4.861; p = 0.032) was associated with 
poor patient survival. In elderly patients (≥65 years), AVF was associated with 
survival benefit only in male (p < 0.001) and diabetic (p = 0.04) patients, and 
with better access patency only in female (p = 0.05) and diabetic (p = 0.04) 
patients. AVG (vs. AVF; HR 3.158; 95% CI 1.080-9.238; p = 0.036) was associated 
with poor patient survival. In septuagenarian patients, AVF was associated only 
with survival benefit (p = 0.01) and there was no advantage in access patency (p 
= 0.12). However, AVF was superior to AVG in both access patency (p = 0.001) and 
patient survival (p = 0.03) even with propensity matching.
CONCLUSION: AVF is the more desirable VA and its survival benefits warrant its 
consideration in septuagenarian patients although a prolonged life expectancy is 
essential to realize the potential benefits of AVF.

Predictions Burden of Diabetes and Economics Cost: Contributing Risk Factors of 
Changing Disease Prevalence and its Pandemic Impact to Qatar.

Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.

Background: The Middle East region is predicted to have one of the highest 
prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the world. The risk of diabetes 
continues to increase worldwide and its public health burden is unevenly 
distributed across socioeconomic strata. This burden is not only related to 
health care costs, but also to indirect costs caused by loss of productivity 
from disability and premature mortality. Aim: This study aims to estimate the 
economics cost of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus [T2DM] among adults in Qatar using 
national data, and to quantify the potential effect of a suggested preventive 
intervention program. Design: It is an observational cohort study. Setting: The 
survey was based on registry at the Hamad General Hospital and Primary Health 
Care (PHC) centers in the State of Qatar. Subject: This study consisted of 
patients above 25 years of age with diagnosed diabetes mellitus registered at 
Hamad General Hospital and Primary Health Care (PHC) centers during January 2004 
to July 2014. Methods: We developed a dynamic model in which actual incidence, 
prevalence, and life expectancy data are used and alternative assumptions about 
future trends in these parameters can be incorporated. Linear regression model 
has been performed to forecast the burden of diabetes in oil-rich country. 
Results: According to the dynamic model, a 10% increased in the number of 
diabetic patients in the State of Qatar from 33 610 in 2005 to 122 000 in 2012 
(about 1% annually). The annual diabetes incidence rate was higher in women than 
in men during a period between 2005 to 2015 years. The static model forecasted 
as 10% increase over 10 years. The relative increase in prevalence of diabetes 
and number of diabetic people are higher in women than in men (16.6%; 17.5% and 
18.4% in men vs. 22.6%; 23.8% and 25.1% in women). Most of the increase in 
prevalence of diabetes is projected to occur in younger age groups where it is 
estimated to increase among age groups of 50-59 years and above 60 years, 
respectively. Conclusion: The burden of diabetes in Qatar is markedly larger 
than proposed by IDF estimations - suggesting that Qatar would be one of the top 
10 countries worldwide in diabetes prevalence. Family history of diabetes, 
consanguinity marriages', hereditary gene-environment interactions, poor 
nutrition in utero and in early life plus over nutrition in later life may also 
contribute to the current diabetes epidemic in Qatari's Arab populations. 
Finally, continuous training of primary health care professionals on diabetes 
care and prevention is an essential tool of improving diabetes in Qatar.

The Clinical and Economic Benefits of Co-Testing Versus Primary HPV Testing for 
Cervical Cancer Screening: A Modeling Analysis.

BACKGROUND: Consensus United States cervical cancer screening guidelines 
recommend use of combination Pap plus human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for 
women aged 30 to 65 years. An HPV test was approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration in 2014 for primary cervical cancer screening in women age 25 
years and older. Here, we present the results of clinical-economic comparisons 
of Pap plus HPV mRNA testing including genotyping for HPV 16/18 (co-testing) 
versus DNA-based primary HPV testing with HPV 16/18 genotyping and reflex 
cytology (HPV primary) for cervical cancer screening.
METHODS: A health state transition (Markov) model with 1-year cycling was 
developed using epidemiologic, clinical, and economic data from healthcare 
databases and published literature. A hypothetical cohort of one million women 
receiving triennial cervical cancer screening was simulated from ages 30 to 70 
years. Screening strategies compared HPV primary to co-testing. Outcomes 
included total and incremental differences in costs, invasive cervical cancer 
(ICC) cases, ICC deaths, number of colposcopies, and quality-adjusted life years 
for cost-effectiveness calculations. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: In a simulation cohort of one million 30-year-old women modeled up to 
age 70 years, the model predicted that screening with HPV primary testing 
instead of co-testing could lead to as many as 2,141 more ICC cases and 2,041 
more ICC deaths. In the simulation, co-testing demonstrated a greater number of 
lifetime quality-adjusted life years (22,334) and yielded $39.0 million in 
savings compared with HPV primary, thereby conferring greater effectiveness at 
lower cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Model results demonstrate that co-testing has the potential to 
provide improved clinical and economic outcomes when compared with HPV primary. 
While actual cost and outcome data are evaluated, these findings are relevant to 
U.S. healthcare payers and women's health policy advocates seeking 
cost-effective cervical cancer screening technologies.

Left Ventricular Assist Devices for Destination Therapy: A Health Technology 
Assessment.

Health Quality Ontario.

BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) provide circulatory support 
to assist the damaged left ventricle in patients with end-stage heart failure. 
Implantation of an LVAD is sometimes a last resort for patients with end stage 
heart failure who are ineligible for heart transplantation (destination 
therapy). First-generation LVADs used pulsatile pumps to mimic the natural 
pulsing action of the heart. Implanted second-generation LVADs use a rapidly 
spinning rotor to produce a continuous flow of blood into the systemic arterial 
system.
OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to: Determine the clinical effectiveness of 
LVADs for destination therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure who are 
ineligible for heart transplantationEstimate the cost-effectiveness of 
destination-therapy LVAD for patients with end-stage heart failure who are 
ineligible for heart transplantation and to estimate the potential budget impact 
for the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care over the next 5 years.
METHODS: We performed a narrative review of the clinical and economic literature 
for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness and a budget impact analysis from the 
perspective of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. We did not conduct a 
meta-analysis of the clinical evidence owing to differences in the type of LVADs 
included in the studies.
RESULTS: Three systematic reviews and one observational study contributed to the 
clinical evidence. Three economic reviews contributed to the economic evidence. 
There is moderate quality evidence that treatment with continuous-flow LVADs 
improves survival but has higher adverse events rates compared with drug 
therapy. Low quality evidence suggests treatment with a continuous-flow LVADs 
improves quality of life. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated 
with destination-therapy LVAD over optimal medical management is relatively high 
and exceeds the traditionally accepted thresholds ($50,000 to $100,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year). The estimated net budget impact is $13.6 million in 
2015, $20.7 million in 2016, $27.8 million in 2017, $35.8 million in 2018, and 
$45.0 million in 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with end-stage heart failure who are ineligible for 
heart transplantation, permanent treatment with continuous-flow LVADs is 
effective at improving survival and quality of life compared with drug therapy. 
However, permanent continuous-flow devices have higher adverse event rates than 
drug therapy. Although it improves survival and quality of life, the device 
itself and the surgery to implant it are very expensive.

Estimation of the risk of secondary malignancy arising from whole-breast 
irradiation: comparison of five radiotherapy modalities, including TomoHDA.

The risk of secondary cancer from radiation treatment remains a concern for 
long-term breast cancer survivors, especially those treated with radiation at 
the age younger than 45 years. Treatment modalities optimally maximize the dose 
delivery to the tumor while minimizing radiation doses to neighboring organs, 
which can lead to secondary cancers. A new TomoTherapy treatment machine, 
TomoHDATM, can treat an entire breast with two static but intensity-modulated 
beams in a slice-by-slice fashion. This feature could reduce scattered and 
leakage radiation doses. We compared the plan quality and lifetime attributable 
risk (LAR) of a second malignancy among five treatment modalities: 
three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, field-in-field forward-planned 
intensity-modulated radiation therapy, inverse-planned intensity-modulated 
radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy, and TomoDirect mode 
on the TomoHDA system. Ten breast cancer patients were selected for 
retrospective analysis. Organ equivalent doses, plan characteristics, and LARs 
were compared. Out-of-field organ doses were measured with 
radio-photoluminescence glass dosimeters. Although the IMRT plan provided 
overall better plan quality, including the lowest probability of pneumonitis, it 
caused the second highest LAR. The TomoTherapy plan provided plan quality 
comparable to the IMRT plan and posed the lowest total LAR to neighboring 
organs. Therefore, it can be a better treatment modality for younger patients 
who have a longer life expectancy.

Gut Microbiota and Allergic Disease. New Insights.

Francisco, California.

The rapid rise in childhood allergies (atopy) in Westernized nations has 
implicated associated environmental exposures and lifestyles as primary drivers 
of disease development. Culture-based microbiological studies indicate that 
atopy has demonstrable ties to altered gut microbial colonization in very early 
life. Infants who exhibit more severe multisensitization to food- or 
aero-allergens have a significantly higher risk of subsequently developing 
asthma in childhood. Hence an emerging hypothesis posits that environment- or 
lifestyle-driven aberrancies in the early-life gut microbiome composition and by 
extension, microbial function, represent a key mediator of childhood allergic 
asthma. Animal studies support this hypothesis. Environmental microbial 
exposures epidemiologically associated with allergy protection in humans confer 
protection against airway allergy in mice. In addition, gut microbiome-derived 
short-chain fatty acids produced from a high-fiber diet have been shown to 
protect against allergy via modulation of both local and remote mucosal immunity 
as well as hematopoietic antigen-presenting cell populations. Here we review key 
data supporting the concept of a gut-airway axis and its critical role in 
childhood atopy.

As human life expectancy is prolonged, age-related diseases are thriving. Aging 
is a complex multifactorial process of molecular and cellular decline that 
affects tissue function over time, rendering organisms frail and susceptible to 
disease and death. Over the last decades, a growing body of scientific 
literature across different biological models, ranging from yeast, worms, flies, 
and mice to primates, humans and other long-lived animals, has contributed 
greatly towards identifying conserved biological mechanisms that ward off 
structural and functional deterioration within living systems. Collectively, 
these data offer powerful insights into healthy aging and longevity. For 
example, molecular integrity of the genome, telomere length, epigenetic 
landscape stability, and protein homeostasis are all features linked to 
"youthful" states. These molecular hallmarks underlie cellular functions 
associated with aging like mitochondrial fitness, nutrient sensing, efficient 
intercellular communication, stem cell renewal, and regenerative capacity in 
tissues. At present, calorie restriction remains the most robust strategy for 
extending health and lifespan in most biological models tested. Thus, pathways 
that mediate the beneficial effects of calorie restriction by integrating 
metabolic signals to aging processes have received major attention, such as 
insulin/insulin growth factor-1, sirtuins, mammalian target of rapamycin, and 5' 
adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase. Consequently, small-molecule 
targets of these pathways have emerged in the impetuous search for calorie 
restriction mimetics, of which resveratrol, metformin, and rapamycin are the 
most extensively studied. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular and 
cellular mechanisms that underlie age-related deterioration and repair, and how 
these pathways interconnect, remains a major challenge for uncovering 
interventions to slow human aging while extending molecular and physiological 
youthfulness, vitality, and health. This review summarizes key molecular 
mechanisms underlying the biology of healthy aging and longevity.

Biodegradable food packaging promises a more sustainable future. Among the many 
different biopolymers used, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) possesses the good 
mechanical property and cost-effectiveness necessary of a biodegradable food 
packaging. However, PLA food packaging suffers from poor water vapor and oxygen 
barrier properties compared to many petroleum-derived ones. A key challenge is, 
therefore, to simultaneously enhance both the water vapor and oxygen barrier 
properties of the PLA food packaging. To address this issue, we design a 
sandwich-architectured PLA-graphene composite film, which utilizes an 
impermeable reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as the core barrier and commercial PLA 
films as the outer protective encapsulation. The synergy between the barrier and 
the protective encapsulation results in a significant 87.6% reduction in the 
water vapor permeability. At the same time, the oxygen permeability is reduced 
by two orders of magnitude when evaluated under both dry and humid conditions. 
The excellent barrier properties can be attributed to the compact lamellar 
microstructure and the hydrophobicity of the rGO core barrier. Mechanistic 
analysis shows that the large rGO lateral dimension and the small interlayer 
spacing between the rGO sheets have created an extensive and tortuous diffusion 
pathway, which is up to 1450-times the thickness of the rGO barrier. In 
addition, the sandwiched architecture has imbued the PLA-rGO composite film with 
good processability, which increases the manageability of the film and its 
competency to be tailored. Simulations using the PLA-rGO composite food 
packaging film for edible oil and potato chips also exhibit at least eight-fold 
extension in the shelf life of these oxygen and moisture sensitive food 
products. Overall, these qualities have demonstrated the high potential of a 
sandwich-architectured PLA-graphene composite film for food packaging 
applications.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine the source of advanced 
cancer patients' information about their prognosis and determine whether this 
source of information could explain racial disparities in the accuracy of 
patients' life expectancy estimates (LEEs).
METHODS: Coping With Cancer was a prospective, longitudinal, multisite study of 
terminally ill cancer patients followed until death. In structured interviews, 
patients reported their LEEs and the sources of these estimates (ie, medical 
providers, personal beliefs, religious beliefs, and other). The accuracy of LEEs 
was calculated through a comparison of patients' self-reported LEEs with their 
actual survival.
RESULTS: The sample for this analysis included 229 patients: 31 black patients 
and 198 white patients. Only 39.30% of the patients estimated their life 
expectancy within 12 months of their actual survival. Black patients were more 
likely to have an inaccurate LEE than white patients. A minority of the sample 
(18.3%) reported that a medical provider was the source of their LEEs; none of 
the black patients (0%) based their LEEs on a medical provider. Black race 
remained a significant predictor of an inaccurate LEE, even after the analysis 
had been controlled for sociodemographic characteristics and the source of LEEs.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of advanced cancer patients have an inaccurate 
understanding of their life expectancy. Black patients with advanced cancer are 
more likely to have an inaccurate LEE than white patients. Medical providers are 
not the source of information for LEEs for most advanced cancer patients and 
especially for black patients. The source of LEEs does not explain racial 
differences in LEE accuracy. Additional research into the mechanisms underlying 
racial differences in prognostic understanding is needed. Cancer

BACKGROUND: The use of combined therapy of antiplatelet and anticoagulant versus 
anticoagulant alone to reduce instances of thromboembolic events in patients 
with heart valve prostheses is an established standard of care in many countries 
but not in Egypt. A previous Markov model cost-effectiveness study on Egyptian 
patients aged 50-60 years demonstrated that the combined therapy reduces the 
overall treatment cost. However, due to the lack of actual real-world data on 
cost-effectiveness and the limitation of the Markov model study to 50- to 
60-year-old patients, the Egyptian medical community is still questioning 
whether the added benefit is worth the cost.
OBJECTIVE: To assess, from the perspective of the Egyptian health sector, the 
cost-effectiveness of the combined use of warfarin and low-dose aspirin (75 mg) 
versus that of warfarin alone in patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses 
who began therapy between the age of 15 and 50 years.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized, controlled 
trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of the combined therapy in patients with 
mechanical valve prostheses. A total of 316 patients aged between 15 and 
50 years were included in the study and randomly assigned to a group treated 
with both warfarin and aspirin or a group treated with warfarin alone.
RESULTS: The patients in the combined therapy group exhibited a significantly 
longer duration of protection against the first event. Fewer primary events were 
observed in the patients treated with warfarin plus aspirin than in those 
treated with warfarin alone (1.4 %/year, vs. 4.8 %/year), and a higher mean 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) value over 4 years was obtained for the 
group treated with warfarin plus aspirin (difference 0.058; 95 % CI 
0.013-0.118), although this difference did not reach a conventional level of 
statistical significance. The total costs over a 4-year period were lower with 
the combined therapy (difference -US$244; 95 % CI -US$483.1 to -US$3.8), which 
yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -US$4206 per QALY gained. 
Thus, the combined therapy was dominant. All costs were reported in US dollars 
(USD) for the financial year 2014.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis indicate that from the perspective of 
the Egyptian health sector, the addition of aspirin to the typical warfarin 
therapy is more effective and less costly for patients with mechanical valve 
prostheses than treatment with warfarin alone. This combined strategy could be 
adopted to prevent the complications of mechanical valve prostheses. Our study 
adds to the body of evidence supporting the option of warfarin-plus-aspirin 
therapy for patients with mechanical valve prostheses.

BACKGROUND: It is unknown if a survival gap remains between HIV-infected and 
HIV-uninfected individuals with access to care.
METHODS: We conducted a cohort study within Kaiser Permanente California during 
1996-2011, using abridged life tables to estimate the expected years of life 
remaining ("life expectancy") at age 20.
RESULTS: Among 24,768 HIV-infected and 257,600 HIV-uninfected individuals, there 
were 2229 and 4970 deaths, with mortality rates of 1827 and 326 per 100,000 
person-years, respectively. In 1996-1997, life expectancies at age 20 for 
HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals were 19.1 and 63.4 years, 
respectively, corresponding with a gap of 44.3 years (95% confidence interval: 
38.4 to 50.2). Life expectancy at age 20 for HIV-infected individuals increased 
to 47.1 years in 2008 and 53.1 years by 2011, narrowing the gap to 11.8 years 
(8.9-14.8 years) in 2011. In 2008-2011, life expectancies at age 20 for 
HIV-infected individuals ranged from a low of 45.8 years for blacks and 46.0 
years for those with a history of injection drug use to a high of 52.2 years for 
Hispanics. HIV-infected individuals who initiated antiretroviral therapy with 
CD4 ≥500 cells per microliter had a life expectancy at age 20 of 54.5 years in 
2008-2011, narrowing the gap relative to HIV-uninfected individuals to 7.9 years 
(5.1-10.6 years). For these HIV-infected individuals, the gap narrowed further 
in subgroups with no history of hepatitis B or C infection, smoking, 
drug/alcohol abuse, or any of these risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Even with early treatment and access to care, an 8-year gap in life 
expectancy remains for HIV-infected compared with HIV-uninfected individuals.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the dynamics of suicides depending on the changes in 
medical-demographic and socio-economic factors in the Russian population in the 
period 1992--2012.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research material was the data of the official medical 
statistics on the groups of people with mental disorders, as well as the data on 
the socio-economic situation of the Russian population during this period. To 
assess the significance of the association between suicide and these factors, 
correlation and regression analysis was used.
RESULTS: The regression model explained 95.9% of the variance in the suicide 
index by two indicators: 1) life expectancy and 2) morbidity of psychotic 
disorders for the population of Russia during this period. The interpretation of 
the integral indicators used in the model, and the dynamics of suicides in the 
Russian population according to socio-economic changes in the country in 
1992--2012 are presented.
CONCLUSION: The model can be used as a tool for operational forecasting and 
monitoring of suicidal patients by government agencies and medical and social 
services.

OBJECTIVE: In Brazil, universal provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has 
been guaranteed free of charge to eligible HIV-positive patients since December 
1996. We sought to quantify the survival benefits of ART attributable to this 
programme.
METHODS: We used a previously published microsimulation model of HIV disease and 
treatment (CEPAC-International) and data from Brazil to estimate life expectancy 
increase for HIV-positive patients initiating ART in Brazil. We divided the 
period of 1997 to 2014 into six eras reflecting increased drug regimen efficacy, 
regimen availability and era-specific mean CD4 count at ART initiation. Patients 
were simulated first without ART and then with ART. The 2014-censored and 
lifetime survival benefits attributable to ART in each era were calculated as 
the product of the number of patients initiating ART in a given era and the 
increase in life expectancy attributable to ART in that era.
RESULTS: In total, we estimated that 598,741 individuals initiated ART. 
Projected life expectancy increased from 2.7, 3.3, 4.1, 4.9, 5.5 and 7.1 years 
without ART to 11.0, 17.5, 20.7, 23.0, 25.3, and 27.0 years with ART in Eras 1 
through 6, respectively. Of the total projected lifetime survival benefit of 9.3 
million life-years, 16% (or 1.5 million life-years) has been realized as of 
December 2014.
CONCLUSIONS: Provision of ART through a national programme has led to dramatic 
survival benefits in Brazil, the majority of which are still to be realized. 
Improvements in initial and subsequent ART regimens and higher CD4 counts at ART 
initiation have contributed to these increasing benefits.

BACKGROUND: Although animal studies have shown that exposure to glyphosate (a 
commonly used herbicide) does not result in glyphosate bioaccumulation in 
tissues, to our knowledge there are no published data on whether it is 
detectable in human milk and therefore consumed by breastfed infants.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether glyphosate and its metabolite 
aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) could be detected in milk and urine produced 
by lactating women and, if so, to quantify typical consumption by breastfed 
infants.
DESIGN: We collected milk (n = 41) and urine (n = 40) samples from healthy 
lactating women living in and around Moscow, Idaho and Pullman, Washington. Milk 
and urine samples were analyzed for glyphosate and AMPA with the use of highly 
sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods validated for 
and optimized to each sample matrix.
RESULTS: Our milk assay, which was sensitive down to 1 μg/L for both analytes, 
detected neither glyphosate nor AMPA in any milk sample. Mean ± SD glyphosate 
and AMPA concentrations in urine were 0.28 ± 0.38 and 0.30 ± 0.33 μg/L, 
respectively. Because of the complex nature of milk matrixes, these samples 
required more dilution before analysis than did urine, thus decreasing the 
sensitivity of the assay in milk compared with urine. No difference was found in 
urine glyphosate and AMPA concentrations between subjects consuming organic 
compared with conventionally grown foods or between women living on or near a 
farm/ranch and those living in an urban or suburban nonfarming area.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that glyphosate and AMPA are not 
detectable in milk produced by women living in this region of the US Pacific
