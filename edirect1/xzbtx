This study was conducted in order to map European research in chronic 
respiratory diseases (CRDs). It was intended to assist the European Commission 
and other research funders to identify gaps and overlaps in their portfolios, 
and to suggest ways in which they could improve the effectiveness of their 
support and increase the impact of the research on patient care and on the 
reduction of the incidence of the CRDs. Articles and reviews were identified in 
the Web of Science on research in six non-communicable respiratory diseases that 
were published in 2002-13 from 31 European countries. They represented only 0.8% 
of biomedical research output but these diseases accounted for 4.7% of the 
European disease burden, as measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), 
so the sub-field is seriously under-researched. Europe is prominent in the 
sub-field and published 56% of the world total, with the UK the most productive 
and publishing more than France and Italy, the next two countries, combined. 
Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) were the diseases with 
the most publications and the highest citation rates. They also received the 
most funding, with around two acknowledgments per paper (in 2009-13), whereas 
cystic fibrosis and emphysema averaged only one. Just over 37% of papers had no 
specific funding and depended on institutional support from universities and 
hospitals.

[Effects of mercury concentration on life table demography of Moina macrocopa 
under different Scenedesmus obliquus densities].

[Article in Chinese]

Huang Y, Wang L, Mu WP, Ren TT, Pan L, Xi YL.

In order to compare the chronic toxicity of pollutants to organisms in an 
aquatic environment under different food densities, the cladoceran Moina 
macrocopa was used as test animal to investigate the effects of Hg²⁺ 
concentrations (0, 0.4, 1.1, 1.8, 2.5, 3.2 and 3.9 µg · L⁻¹) on its life table 
demography under low (0.5 x 10⁶ cells · mL⁻¹), medium (1.0 x 10⁶ cells · mL⁻¹) 
and high (2.0 x 10⁶ cells · mL⁻¹) densities of Scenedesmus obliquus. The results 
showed that at low and high food levels, certain concentrations of Hg²⁺ had 
inhibitory effects on survival, reproduction and population growth of M. 
macrocopa. However, at the medium food level, the inhibitory effects 
disappeared. Compared with the control, at the low food level, Hg²⁺ at 0.4-2.5 
and 3.9 µg · L⁻¹ significantly decreased the life expectancy at hatching, Hg²⁺ 
at 0.4, 1.1, 2.5 and 3.9 µg · L⁻¹ decreased the generation time, Hg²⁺ at 1.1, 
2.5 and 3.9 µg · L⁻¹ decreased the net reproduction rate, and Hg²⁺ at 3.9 µg · 
L⁻¹ decreased the gross reproduction rate of M. macrocopa. At the high food 
level, Hg²⁺ at 1.1 µg · L⁻¹ decreased the intrinsic rate of population increase, 
and Hg²⁺ at 3.9 µg · L⁻¹ decreased the life expectancy at hatching and the net 
reproduction rate of M. macrocopa. However, at the medium food level, Hg²⁺ at 
3.2 µg · L⁻¹ increased the life expectancy at hatching of M. macrocopa. When S. 
obliquus density was 0.5 x 10⁶ cells · mL⁻¹, there were significant dose-effect 
relationships between Hg²⁺ concentration and the life expectancy at hatching, 
the generation time as well as the cross reproduction rate of M. macrocopa. 
However, when S. obliquus density was 1.0 x 10⁶ or 2.0 x 10⁶ cells · mL⁻¹, there 
were no any significant dose-effect relationships between Hg²⁺ concentration and 
each of the life table demographic parameters of M. macrocopa.

Health outcomes and economic consequences of using angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors in comparison with angiotensin receptor blockers in the treatment of 
arterial hypertension in the contemporary Polish setting.

BACKGROUND: Arterial hypertension (AH) represents a public health problem in 
Poland, firstly due to the huge, still growing population of patients (10.45 
million patients based on NATPOL 2011 and PolSenior Surveys), and secondly 
because of the substantial cost of reimbursement from the National Health Fund 
(NHF). The most commonly used drugs in the treatment of AH include 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor 
blockers (ARBs), the latter being associated with significantly higher unit 
reimbursement cost. Recent meta-analyses of randomised, controlled trials 
indicate that there is no medical reason to favour ARBs over ACEIs in AH 
treatment.
AIM: To assess the clinical benefit of using ACEIs instead of ARBs and to 
calculate the potential savings for the payer and patients associated with 
changing the treatment paradigm to preferential use of ACEIs.
METHODS: The assessment of clinical consequences includes differences between 
ACEIs and ARBs in terms of average life expectancy and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) gained. The impact of these drugs on general mortality was 
estimated based on the meta-analysis carried out by van Vark et al. in 2012. 
Patients' health-related quality of life was adjusted with Polish population 
utility norms derived for the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire and additionally for 
ACEI-induced cough-related utility decrease. Potential savings for the payer on 
a yearly basis were calculated for a hypothetical cohort of patients who are 
currently treated with ARBs and might be switched to ACEIs. The number of 
patients treated with ARBs and ACEIs was estimated based on NHF and IMS Health 
data.
RESULTS: ACEIs were associated with a statistically significant 10% reduction in 
all-cause mortality, which results in extra life gained of 0.354 years (4.2 
months) or an additional 0.201 QALY (2.4 months). Potential annual savings could 
amount to 112.0 million PLN (25.7 million EUR) and 10.5 million PLN (2.4 million 
EUR) for the public payer (NHF) and patients, respectively; and 1768 
cardiovascular deaths per year could be prevented.
CONCLUSIONS: Preferential use of ACEIs in comparison with ARBs in the treatment 
of AH is associated with substantial extension of life (including 
quality-adjusted life), reduction of cardiovascular deaths, and savings for the 
NHF and patients.

BACKGROUND: The M.E. Müller (MEM) prosthesis is a self-locking straight stem. 
Although this prosthesis is widely used, few outcomes have been published thus 
far.
METHODS: We examined long-term outcomes with the MEM cemented self-locking total 
hip arthroplasty (THA) with a polyethylene liner and 28-mm head. Between 1993 
and 1994, 167 patients (173 hips) underwent primary THA implantation and were 
invited for clinical and radiological review a mean of 20.6 (20.1 - 21.7) years 
later; 111 patients had a metal and 62 a ceramic head. Hip function was assessed 
using the Postel Merle d'Aubigné Score.
RESULTS: Overall, 121 patients died and six were lost to follow-up. Forty 
patients (41 hips) were reviewed. Five patients required revision, of whom two 
were due to acetabular loosening, one to premature haematoma, one to recurrent 
dislocation and one to femoral fracture. Wear levels were significantly lower 
with ceramic than metal heads. The majority of radiological or clinical failures 
were acetabular (7.3 % versus 2.4 % femoral). At the femoral level, osteolysis 
was observed in seven patients (17 %). Twenty-year survival was 88.67 ± 6.61 % 
using an endpoint of all-cause revision and 97.9 ± 2.1 % using femoral failure 
as the endpoint.
CONCLUSION: Our retrospective analysis confirms the good results seen with the 
MEM stem in the literature and support the "French paradox" concept. Failures of 
these prostheses with a cemented polyethylene cup are largely on the acetabular 
side and, as such, the cup is the weak link. Improvements in survival will 
require optimisation of cup fixation and the use of a ceramic head to reduce 
wear in patients with a long life expectancy.

A literature search was made using PubMed. The proportion of postmenopausal 
women has been continually increasing because of enhanced life expectancy. 
However, accompanying this trend, there is an observed increase in mortality due 
to cardiovascular disease (CVD). All over the world, obesity rates are 
increasing and this fact is associated with expanded rates of hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Many of these well-known risk factors for CVD can be 
modified by lifestyle changes. For this reason, nutritional strategies to 
prevent CVD in this population should be a primary objective for health-care 
providers. Any attempt at lifestyle modification should include behavioral 
changes and the implementation of healthy diets and physical activity. The 
Mediterranean diet is comparable with other interventions such as aspirin, 
statins, physical activity, and even antihypertensives in terms of reducing the 
risk of CVD morbidity, mortality and events. The aim of this review is to 
analyze the effect of dietary advice on postmenopausal women's health.

BACKGROUND: The potential harms of a prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis may 
outweigh its benefits in elderly men.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the use of prostate biopsy in men with limited life 
expectancy (LE) within the practices comprising the Michigan Urological Surgery 
Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: MUSIC is a consortium of 42 practices and 
nearly 85% of the urologists in Michigan. From July 2013 to October 2014, 
clinical data were collected prospectively for all men undergoing prostate 
biopsy.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We calculated 
comorbidity-adjusted LE in men aged ≥66 yr and identified men with <10 yr LE 
(limited LE) undergoing a first biopsy. Our LE calculator was not designed for 
men aged <66 yr; thus these men were excluded. Multivariable models estimated 
the proportion of all biopsies performed for men with limited LE in each MUSIC 
practice, adjusting for differences in patient characteristics. We also 
evaluated what treatments, if any, these patients received.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Among 3035 men aged ≥66 yr undergoing initial prostate 
biopsy, 60% had none of the measured comorbidities. Overall, 547 men (18%) had 
limited LE. Compared with men with a longer LE, these men had significantly 
higher prostate-specific antigen levels and abnormal digital rectal examination 
findings. The adjusted proportion of biopsies performed for men with limited LE 
ranged from 3.8% to 39% across MUSIC practices (p < 0.001). PCa was diagnosed in 
69% of men with limited LE; among this group, 74% received any active treatment. 
Of these men, 46% had high-grade cancer (Gleason score 8-10).
CONCLUSIONS: Among a large and diverse group of urology practices, nearly 20% of 
prostate biopsies are performed in men with limited LE. These data provide 
useful context for quality improvement efforts aimed at optimizing patient 
selection for prostate biopsy.
PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, nearly 2 of every 10 men undergoing prostate 
biopsy had a life expectancy (LE) <10 yr. Implementing LE calculators in 
clinical practice may help refine patient selection for prostate biopsy.

OBJECTIVE: While the increased risk of psychopathology in the biological 
offspring of depressed parents has been widely replicated, the long-term outcome 
through their full age of risk is less known. The authors present a 30-year 
follow-up of biological offspring (mean age=47 years) of depressed (high-risk) 
and nondepressed (low-risk) parents.
METHOD: One hundred forty-seven offspring of moderately to severely depressed or 
nondepressed parents selected from the same community were followed for up to 30 
years. Diagnostic assessments were conducted blind to parents' clinical status. 
Final diagnoses were made by a blinded M.D. or Ph.D. evaluator.
RESULTS: The risk for major depression was approximately three times as high in 
the high-risk offspring. The period of highest risk for first onset was between 
ages 15 and 25 in both groups. Prepubertal onsets were uncommon, but high-risk 
offspring had over 10-fold increased risk. The early onset of major depression 
seen in the offspring of depressed parents was not offset by later first onsets 
in the low-risk group as they matured. The increased rates of major depression 
in the high-risk group were largely accounted for by the early onsets, but later 
recurrences in the high-risk group were significantly increased. The high-risk 
offspring continue to have overall poorer functioning and receive more treatment 
for emotional problems. There was increased mortality in the high-risk group 
(5.5% compared with 2.5%) due to unnatural causes, with a nearly 8-year 
difference in the mean age at death (38.8 years compared with 46.5 years).
CONCLUSIONS: The offspring of depressed parents remain at high risk for 
depression, morbidity, and mortality that persists into their middle years. 
While adolescence is the major period of onset for major depression in both risk 
groups, it is the offspring with family history who go on to have recurrences 
and a poor outcome as they mature. In the era of personalized medicine, until a 
more biologically based understanding of individual risk is found, a simple 
family history assessment of major depression as part of clinical care can be a 
predictor of individuals at long-term risk.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been recommended 
for steroid-resistant chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy 
(CIDP). The treatment, however, is very costly to healthcare system, and there 
remains no evidence of its economic justifiability. This study aimed to conduct 
an economic evaluation (EE) of IVIG plus corticosteroids in steroid-resistant 
CIDP in Thailand.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the lifetime costs and 
outcomes for IVIG plus corticosteroids in comparison with immunosuppressants 
plus corticosteroids in steroid-resistant CIDP patients from a societal 
perspective. Efficacy and utility data were obtained from clinical literature, 
meta-analyses, medical record reviews, and patient interviews. Cost data were 
obtained from list prices, an electronic hospital database, published source, 
and patient interviews. All costs [in 2015 US dollars (US$)] and outcomes were 
discounted at 3 % annually. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
conducted.
RESULTS: In the base-case, the incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) of IVIG plus corticosteroids versus immunosuppressants plus 
corticosteroids were US$2112.02 and 1.263 QALYs, respectively, resulting in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$1672.71 per QALY gained. 
Sensitivity analyses revealed that the utility value of disabled patients was 
the greatest influence on ICER. At a societal willingness-to-pay threshold in 
Thailand of US$4672 per QALY gained, IVIG plus corticosteroids had a 92.1 % 
probability of being cost effective.
CONCLUSIONS: At a threshold of US$4672 per QALY gained, IVIG plus 
corticosteroids is considered a cost-effective treatment for steroid-resistant 
CIDP patients in Thailand.

OBJECTIVES: Internet-delivered exposure-based cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) 
has been shown to be effective in the treatment of severe health anxiety. The 
health economic effects of the treatment have, however, been insufficiently 
studied and no prior study has investigated the effect of ICBT compared with an 
active psychological treatment. The aim of the present study was to investigate 
the cost effectiveness of ICBT compared with internet-delivered behavioural 
stress management (IBSM) for adults with severe health anxiety defined as 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) 
hypochondriasis. ICBT was hypothesised to be the more cost-effective treatment.
SETTING: This was a cost-effectiveness study within the context of a randomised 
controlled trial conducted in a primary care/university setting. Participants 
from all of Sweden could apply to participate.
PARTICIPANTS: Self-referred adults (N=158) with a principal diagnosis of DSM-IV 
hypochondriasis, of whom 151 (96%) provided baseline and post-treatment data.
INTERVENTIONS: ICBT or IBSM for 12 weeks.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Health Anxiety 
Inventory. The secondary outcome was the EQ-5D. Other secondary measures were 
used in the main outcome study but were not relevant for the present health 
economic analysis.
RESULTS: Both treatments led to significant reductions in gross total costs, 
costs of healthcare visits, direct non-medical costs and costs of domestic work 
cutback (p=0.000-0.035). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
indicated that the cost of one additional case of clinically significant 
improvement in ICBT compared with IBSM was $2214. The cost-utility ICER, that 
is, the cost of one additional quality-adjusted life year, was estimated to be 
$10,000.
CONCLUSIONS: ICBT is a cost-effective treatment compared with IBSM and treatment 
costs are offset by societal net cost reductions in a short time. A cost-benefit 
analysis speaks for ICBT to play an important role in increasing access to 
effective treatment for severe health anxiety.

AIM: To explore patients' and family caregivers' experiences and perceptions of 
Hospice at Home care.
BACKGROUND: The public indicate a preference to be cared for and to die at home. 
This has inherent challenges, with a key factor being the family caregiver. 
Supporting end-of-life care at home has resulted in the expansion of Hospice at 
Home services. A wide configuration of services exists with a lack of robust 
evidence as to what is valued by recipients, particularly those who are older 
people.
DESIGN: A prospective descriptive qualitative study.
METHODS: Recruitment was purposive. Eligible participants were in receipt of 
Hospice at Home service on at least three occasions and were deemed to have a 
life expectancy measured in weeks rather than days. Digitally recorded 
semistructured interviews with 41 participants (16 patients and 25 family 
caregivers) were undertaken between October 2014 - July 2015. Data were analysed 
and organized thematically.
RESULTS: Several subthemes: 'Talking about'; 'Knowing and Doing'; 'Caring for 
the Caregivers'; and 'Promoting Choice' contributed to the overall theme of 
Embracing Holism. A positive impact on emotional, psychological, social and 
physical well-being was apparent.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided additional insights as to the value of 
Hospice at Home care where Hospice Nurses are helping to bring Hospice care into 
the home. This is helping to support older people who are dying and their 
caregivers, to live as well as possible and facilitate their wish to be cared 
for and die in their own home.

PURPOSE: To optimally exploit fractionation effects in the context of 
radiosurgery treatments of large cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In 
current practice, fractionated treatments divide the dose evenly into several 
fractions, which generally leads to low obliteration rates. In this work, we 
investigate the potential benefit of delivering distinct dose distributions in 
different fractions.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five patients with large cerebral AVMs were reviewed and 
replanned for intensity modulated arc therapy delivered with conventional photon 
beams. Treatment plans allowing for different dose distributions in all 
fractions were obtained by performing treatment plan optimization based on the 
cumulative biologically effective dose delivered at the end of treatment.
RESULTS: We show that distinct treatment plans can be designed for different 
fractions, such that high single-fraction doses are delivered to complementary 
parts of the AVM. All plans create a similar dose bath in the surrounding normal 
brain and thereby exploit the fractionation effect. This partial 
hypofractionation in the AVM along with fractionation in normal brain achieves a 
net improvement of the therapeutic ratio. We show that a biological dose 
reduction of approximately 10% in the healthy brain can be achieved compared 
with reference treatment schedules that deliver the same dose distribution in 
all fractions.
CONCLUSIONS: Boosting complementary parts of the target volume in different 
fractions may provide a therapeutic advantage in fractionated radiosurgery 
treatments of large cerebral AVMs. The strategy allows for a mean dose reduction 
in normal brain that may be valuable for a patient population with an otherwise 
normal life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: The French college of general hospital respiratory physicians 
(CPHG) has conducted 10 years apart two prospective observational studies to 
assess changes in the primary lung cancer epidemiology and outcomes, including 
1-year mortality.
METHODS: In 2000 and 2010, all volunteer adult patients followed in the 
respiratory department of general hospitals participating in the study were 
consecutively included if their lung cancer was histologically or cytologically 
diagnosed between 01 January and 31 December (sample date). Their vital status 
at least 1 year after inclusion and date of death (if applicable) were 
collected.
RESULTS: Respectively, 5667 and 7051 patients were included in the study in 2000 
and 2010 and vital status of 5441 (96.0%) and 6981 (99%) patients known. 
One-year mortality rate was 61.8% in 2000 and 56.4% in 2010 (P<0.0001). 
Mortality rate significantly decreased from 2000 to 2010 in non-small-cell lung 
cancer (60.7% vs. 55.2%; P<0.0001) but not in small-cell lung cancer (66.9% vs. 
64.2%; P=0.22). The year of diagnosis was an independent risk factor of 
mortality (OR=0.84; 95% CI: 0.77-0.91; P<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Although it remains low (43.6% in 2010), life expectancy at 1 year 
for patients with lung cancer has improved in 10 years. Five-year results are 
expected to show whether this improvement is maintained or not over time.

Medicine Sydney (J.A.E.), University of Notre Dame 2010 Australia.

CONTEXT: Hip fracture incidence has been declining and life expectancy 
improving. However, trends of postfracture outcomes are unknown.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to compare the refracture risk and 
excess mortality after osteoporotic fracture between two birth cohorts, over 2 
decades.
DESIGN: Prospective birth cohorts were followed up over 2 decades (1989-2004 and 
2000-2014).
SETTING: The study was conducted in community-dwelling participants in Dubbo, 
Australia.
PARTICIPANTS: Women and men aged 60-80 years, participating in Dubbo 
Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study 1 (DOES 1; born before 1930) and Dubbo 
Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study 2 (DOES 2; born after 1930) participated in the 
study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Age-standardized fracture and mortality over two time 
intervals: (1989-2004 [DOES 1] and 2000-2014 [DOES 2]) were measured.
RESULTS: The DOES 2 cohort had higher body mass index and bone mineral density 
and lower initial fracture rate than DOES 1, but similar refracture rates 
[age-standardized refracture rates per 1000 person-years: women: 53 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 42-63) and 51 (95% CI 41-60) and men: 53 (95% CI 38-69) 
and 55 (95% CI 40-71) for DOES 2 and DOES 1, respectively). Absolute 
postfracture mortality rates declined in DOES 2 compared with DOES 1, mirroring 
the improvement in general-population life expectancy. However, when compared 
with period-specific general-population mortality, there was a similar 2.1- to 
2.6-fold increased mortality risk after a fracture in both cohorts (age-adjusted 
standardized mortality ratio, women: 2.05 [95% CI 1.43-2.83] and 2.43 [95% CI 
1.95-2.99] and men: 2.56 [95% CI 1.78-3.58] and 2.48 [95% CI 1.87-3.22] for DOES 
2 and DOES 1, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Over the 2 decades, despite the decline in the prevalence of 
fracture risk factors, general-population mortality, and initial fracture 
incidence, there was no improvement in postfracture outcomes. Refracture rates 
were similar and fracture-associated mortality was 2-fold higher than expected. 
These data indicate that the low postfracture treatment rates are still a major 
problem.

Can renal prognosis and life expectancy be accurately predicted? Increasingly, 
the answer is yes. The natural history of different forms of renal disease is 
becoming clearer; the degree of reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
and the magnitude of proteinuria are strong predictors of renal outcome. 
Actuarial data on life expectancy from the start of renal replacement therapy 
are available from renal registries such as the U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS), 
and the UK Renal Registry. Recently, similar data have become available for 
patients with chronic kidney disease. Data collected from a large 
population-based registry in Alberta, Canada and stratified for different levels 
of estimated GFR (eGFR) have shown that the reduction in life expectancy with 
kidney failure is not a uremic event associated with starting dialysis but a 
continuous process that is evident from an eGFR of ≤60 ml/min. Nevertheless, 
despite the poor prognosis of the last stages of renal failure, progress in the 
treatment and management of these patients and, in particular, of their 
cardiovascular risk factors continues to improve long-term outcome.

BACKGROUND: Preference-based health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) scores are 
useful as outcome measures in clinical studies, for monitoring the health of 
populations, and for estimating quality-adjusted life-years.
METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data collected in an internet survey 
as part of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
(PROMIS(®)) project. To estimate Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI-3) 
preference scores, we used the ten PROMIS(®) global health items, the 
PROMIS-29 V2.0 single pain intensity item and seven multi-item scales (physical 
functioning, fatigue, pain interference, depressive symptoms, anxiety, ability 
to participate in social roles and activities, sleep disturbance), and the 
PROMIS-29 V2.0 items. Linear regression analyses were used to identify 
significant predictors, followed by simple linear equating to avoid regression 
to the mean.
RESULTS: The regression models explained 48 % (global health items), 61 % 
(PROMIS-29 V2.0 scales), and 64 % (PROMIS-29 V2.0 items) of the variance in the 
HUI-3 preference score. Linear equated scores were similar to observed scores, 
although differences tended to be larger for older study participants.
CONCLUSIONS: HUI-3 preference scores can be estimated from the PROMIS(®) global 
health items or PROMIS-29 V2.0. The estimated HUI-3 scores from the PROMIS(®) 
health measures can be used for economic applications and as a measure of 
overall HR-QOL in research.

The University of Michigan Sarcoma Survivorship Clinic: Preventing, Diagnosing, 
and Treating Chronic Illness for Improved Survival and Long-Term Health.

Bobowski NP(1), Baker LH(1).

Author information:

Program , Ann Arbor, Michigan.

The Children's Cancer Survivorship Study reports more chronic illnesses in 
sarcoma survivors than other pediatric cancers. Chemotherapy and radiation put 
survivors at risk for developing chronic illnesses, including heart disease, 
diabetes, hypertension, and kidney failure. Sarcoma survivors may have a reduced 
life expectancy and signs of heart disease in their 30s and 40s. Since these 
medical problems occur much later in the general population, they often go 
undetected or misdiagnosed in sarcoma survivors, creating delays in intervention 
and treatment. The good news is that these chronic illnesses can often be 
prevented or minimized. The most common adverse effect of chemotherapy and 
radiation is coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD has a number of risk factors, 
including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. These risk factors 
are modifiable with lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, and/or 
pharmacological intervention. By identifying and managing risk factors like 
hypertension early, we in turn reduce the risk for CAD and prolong survival. 
This is well established in the general population; there is no reason a priori 
not to apply it to sarcoma survivors. Sarcoma survivors should be followed by 
physicians who understand the late effects and outcomes of sarcoma treatment. 
The University of Michigan Sarcoma Survivorship Clinic provides long-term care 
for sarcoma survivors by preventing, diagnosing, and treating the adverse 
long-term physical and psychological effects associated with sarcoma 
survivorship.

[The influence of kinesiotaping on lumbar spine pain].

[Article in Polish]

Ciosek Z, Kopacz L, Samulak L, Kaźmierczak A, Rotter I.

INTRODUCTION: Pain in the lumbosacral spine is currently one of the most common 
pain complaints among the elderly. About 72% of the Polish population younger 
than 40 years have at least once been treated by a doctor for back pain. 
Degenerative changes of intervertebral joints, overloads, intervertebral disc 
diseases, and dysfunction of spinal ligaments are very often responsible for the 
formation of back pain, which is basically a problem of the elderly,
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted among 60 residents of a Nursing 
Home in Szczecin with chronic lumbar pain. The age range was 56-85 years. 
Subjects were randomly divided into two groups of 30 (study group, where 
KinesioTaping was used, and a control group without KinesioTaping application). 
To assess the degree of pain experienced by the patient a visual analogue scale 
(VAS) in the horizontal format from 0-10 was used, on which subjects scored the 
severity of pain. Flexion, extension, tilt and rotation were measured with a 
tape to assess spinal and trunk mobility.
RESULTS: In all patients, who had a KinesioTaping patch applied on the 
lumbosacral spine pain measured by VAS reduced (p ≤ 0.001). Considering 
respondents' sex, the spine mobility in the tilting position improved in men in 
the study group in terms of tilting to both sides. In all patients, the 
application of a KinesioTaping patch significantly improved the rotation to the 
right side (p ≤ 0.05), scores in the "finger-floor" flexion test (p ≤ 0.01), and 
the extension range (p ≤ 0.01).
CONCLUSION: KinesioTaping is a beneficial method reducing pain and improving the 
mobility in the lumbosacral spine. The improvement was independent of the sex of 
the respondents.

[Vascular reactivity and receptor expression of endogenous vasoconstrictor in 
rats with alcoholic cardiomyopathy and insulation stress].

[Article in Russian]

Kozhevnikova LM, Tsorin IB, Varkov AI, Stolyaruk VN, Vititnova MB, Kolik LG, 
Sukhanova IF, Kryzhanovskii SA.

On the model of alcohol cardiomyopathy studied the effect of chronic ethanol 
consumption and the insulation stress on the reactivity of isolated rat aorta 
and the expression of the endogenous vasoconstrictor receptors in the aorta. 
Pushing alcoholization outbred rats was carried out for 24-28 weeks, using as 
the sole source of liquid 10% ethanol solution. In assessing the results of the 
study took into account the age of the animals. It is found that the reactivity 
of isolated aortic rings dissected from the body of old (40-45 weeks) 
nonstressed rats in response to endothelin-1 (ET1), noradrenaline (NA), arginine 
vasopressin (AVP) or angiotensin II (ATII) is not different from such reactivity 
for young animals. However, with the increase in life expectancy increases the 
sensitivity of vessels to vasoconstrictor action of serotonin (5HT). Prolonged 
stress insulation and the consumption of high doses of ethanol the stress lead 
to increased ET1- and NA-induced contraction of the aortic rings and a 
significant decrease in contractile response of the aorta to the impact ATII and 
AVP. Stress and alco- hol in combination with stress causing reduction mRNA 
ETA-R, AT1A-R. and V1A-R and increased mRNA α₁-AR in rat aorta. It is found that 
in the vessels of stressed and alcoholized animals reduced level of expression 
of cytosolic glucocorticoid receptors (GR), which is a transcription factor for 
genes ETA-R, AT1A-R V1A-R. It is propoused that the development of vascular 
hyporesponsiveness of stressed and alcoholized rats to action ATII and AVP is 
the result of reducing the expression of their receptors on the GR-dependent 
mechanism. It is shown that under the influence of ethanol vessels become 
hyporeactivity selectively with respect to the action of 5HT. The mechanism of 
this process is unclear. Importantly, the changes in the contractile properties 
vessels recovered from the rat at 1 month after the abolition of the reception 
of ethanol (step abstinence) were similar to changes found at the alcohohzed 
animals. Thus, the importance of breaking the neuroendocrine regulation of 
vascular tone during long-term consumption of ethanol has a stressor components. 
Furthermore, in this experimental model we not received data in favor ethanol 
direct impact on the development of hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) in women are rare and their 
outcomes compared with men with PAA are unknown. The purpose of this study was 
to compare the surgical outcomes of PAA of women with men.
METHODS: All patients who underwent PAA repair at a single institution from 1985 
to 2013 were reviewed. All women with degenerative PAA treated during that time 
frame were matched on year of repair to men. Presentation, mode of repair, and 
outcomes were reviewed. Survival and amputation-free survival were evaluated by 
life table analysis.
RESULTS: During the study interval, 8 women with degenerative PAA underwent 
surgical treatment (1.6% of 485 total PAA repairs). The overall median follow-up 
was 5 years (range 1 month to 19 years), but the median follow-up was shorter 
for women than men (1.6 vs. 6 years, P = 0.04). At the time of repair, women 
were of similar age compared with men (73.5 vs. 71.7 years) and had similar 
aneurysm size (2.7 vs. 2.9 cm). Women had similar urgency (25 vs. 17.5% 
emergent) and symptomatic status (50% vs. 55% acute) even though 7 of the 8 
women had a thrombosed PAA at the time of repair. Operative time, approach, 
graft type, and inflow and outflow sources were similar between genders. No 
women received endovascular repair (0% vs. 10%, P = 0.5). One patient of each 
gender underwent major amputation (one woman on post-operative day 158 and one 
man on post-operative day 3). Overall, women had lower survival and 
amputation-free survival at 2 years (51% vs. 100% and 20% vs. 94%, P < 0.01 for 
both, standard error 0.2).
CONCLUSIONS: PAA requiring intervention in women is a rare clinical occurrence. 
Although our series is limited, women requiring PAA repair had higher long-term 
mortality compared with men with a similar pathology and treatment strategy.

BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab (BEV)-containing therapies are costly. We performed a 
health economic analysis of a randomized phase 3 study (SAKK 41/06) that 
compared BEV continuation as a single agent (BEV) with treatment holidays (no 
BEV) after completing 4 to 6 cycles of first-line chemotherapy plus BEV in 
metastatic colorectal cancer patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Costs for first-line chemotherapy with BEV, BEV 
continuation therapy, hospitalizations (length of stay), control visits, 
diagnostic tests, and second-line and later rounds of chemotherapy were 
collected. Mean costs per patient per treatment arm and an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was 
performed to account for uncertainty in the input parameters.
RESULTS: The total incurred mean costs per patient were 126,631 Swiss francs 
(CHF) [95% confidence interval (CI), 116,521-136,740] for BEV versus CHF100,146 
(95% CI, 92,811-107,481) for no BEV. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio 
was CHF108,991 per life-year gained (LYG; 95% CI from probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, 62,890-248,515). Compared to a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
CHF100,000/LYG, there was 42% probability that BEV continuation was cost 
effective, which decreased to 20% at a threshold of CHF75,000/LYG. Economic 
equality was reached in only 0.07% of cases.

supported by this health economic analysis. Costs increase without significant 
clinical benefit in this setting.
