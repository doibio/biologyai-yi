study. Data were collected from four European aortic centres treating patients 
between 2001 and 2021. The initial model included age, estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as 
independent predictors for survival. Model performance was measured by 
discrimination and calibration.
RESULTS: The validation cohort included 1 500 patients with a median follow up 
of 65 months, during which 54.6% of the patients died. The external validation 
showed slightly decreased discrimination ability and signs of overfitting in 
model calibration. However, a high risk subgroup of patients with impaired 
survival rates was identified: octogenarians with eGFR < 60 OR COPD, 
septuagenarians with eGFR < 30, and septuagenarians with eGFR < 60 and COPD 
having survival rates of only 55.2% and 15.5% at five and 10 years, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: EVAR is a valuable treatment option for AAA, especially for patients 
unsuitable for open repair. Nonetheless, not all these patients will benefit 
from EVAR, and an individualised treatment recommendation should include 
considerations on life expectancy. This study provides a risk stratification to 
identify patients who may not benefit from EVAR under the present diameter 
threshold.

Creating effective dietary guidance requires a rigorous evidence base that is 
predominantly developed from robust clinical trials or large scale cohort 
studies, with the quality of the data available depending on the completeness 
and accuracy of their reporting. An international group of academics from 14 
institutions in 12 different countries and on five continents, working on behalf 
of the Federation of European Nutrition Societies within its "Improving 
Standards in the Science of Nutrition" initiative, reviewed the CONsolidated 
Standards Of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement checklist as it pertains to 
nutrition trials. This perspective piece documents the procedure followed to 
gain input and consensus on the checklist previously published by this group, 
including its presentation and interrogation at the International Union of 
Nutritional Sciences International Congress of Nutrition 2022 (IUNS-ICN 22), 
inputs from a survey of journal editors, and its piloting on eight nutrition 
trials of diverse designs. Overall, the initiative has been met with 
considerable enthusiasm. At IUNS-ICN 22, refinements to our proposal were 
elicited through a World Café method discussion with participating nutrition 
scientists. The contributing journal editors provided valuable insights and the 
discussion led to development of a potential tool specific to assess adherence 
to the proposed nutrition extension checklist. The piloting of the proposed 
checklist provided evidence from real-life studies that reporting of nutrition 
trials can be improved. This initiative aims to stimulate further discussion and 
development of a CONSORT-nutrition-specific extension.

OBJECTIVE: Increasing numbers of young people attending university has raised 
concerns about the capacity of student mental health services to support them. 
We conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to explore whether provision of 
an 8 week mindfulness course adapted for university students (Mindfulness Skills 
for Students-MSS), compared with university mental health support as usual 
(SAU), reduced psychological distress during the examination period. Here, we 
conduct an economic evaluation of MSS+SAU compared with SAU.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Economic evaluation conducted alongside a pragmatic, 
parallel, single-blinded RCT comparing provision of MSS+SAU to SAU.
PARTICIPANTS: 616 university students randomised.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary economic evaluation assessed 
the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from the perspective of 
the university counselling service. Costs relate to staff time required to 
deliver counselling service offerings. QALYs were derived from the Clinical 
Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Dimension 6 Dimension (CORE-6D) preference based 
tool, which uses responses to six items of the Clinical Outcomes in Routine 
Evaluation Outcome Measure (CORE-OM; primary clinical outcome measure). Primary 
follow-up duration was 5 and 7 months for the two recruitment cohorts.
RESULTS: It was estimated to cost £1584 (2022 prices) to deliver an MSS course 
to 30 students, £52.82 per student. Both costs (adjusted mean difference: £48, 
95% CI £40-£56) and QALYs (adjusted mean difference: 0.014, 95% CI 0.008 to 
0.021) were significantly higher in the MSS arm compared with SAU. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £3355, with a very high (99.99%) 
probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 
per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: MSS leads to significantly improved outcomes at a moderate 
additional cost. The ICER of £3355 per QALY suggests that MSS is cost-effective 
when compared with the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
thresholds of £20 000 per QALY.

PURPOSE: Trisomy 21 (T21), more commonly known as Down syndrome (DS) is a 
genetic condition where every cell in the body has an additional copy of 
chromosome 21. Despite improvements in our management of DS-associated health 
risks, we still do not understand how T21 impacts human bone health. This is a 
critical area of research owing to increased life expectancy of people with DS, 
and the predisposition of individuals with DS to early-onset osteoporosis and 
osteopenia.
METHODS: We have conducted a scoping review using the methodological framework 
of Arksey and O'Malley (2005) which analysed the existing data on bone growth, 
development, maintenance and repair in T21 using the Medical Subject Headings 
(MeSH) terms: Trisomy 21, Down syndrome, Down's syndrome, bone development, bone 
growth, bone maintenance, fracture risk, osteoporosis, bone mineral density, 
bone strength, bone mineral content, bone formation, bone repair, osteoblast, 
osteoclast, osteocyte, osteomacs. A total of 31 papers were identified. After 
screening, 16 articles were included in full-text review.
RESULTS: There was a total of eleven in vivo animal model studies identified and 
included in the scoping review. Of those eleven, ten revealed a difference in 
bone growth and development in animal models of DS, and two found that bone 
maintenance and repair in animal models of DS is reduced with both studies 
reporting an osteoporotic bone phenotype in male and female mice. All five 
studies that included human participants reported impacts on bone growth and 
development with reduced bone growth rates and delayed bone maturation in 
individuals with DS. At the time of review, there were no human studies directly 
investigating bone maintenance and repair in individuals with DS.
CONCLUSION: We found documented evidence that T21 impacts bone growth and 
development, maintenance and repair in both animal models and human studies.

Klotho is a human protein with versatile functions associated with longevity and 
well-being. α-Klotho (αKL) deficiency in the circulatory system is associated 
with reduced life expectancy with numerous disorders such as chronic kidney 
disease, atherosclerosis, infertility, skin atrophy, emphysema, and 
osteoporosis. The antagonistic effects of Klotho protein against intractable 
cancers have also been well documented over the past two decades. In addition, 
recent findings have also illuminated the importance of soluble Klotho during 
cognitive development, oxidative stress, cellular apoptosis, and 
neurodegenerative disorders. The low-cost and sustainable production of alpha 
klotho protein is extremely important for its widespread use against different 
diseases. Here, we report heterologous, functional, and extracellular production 
of mouse α-KL (mα-KL) protein in model microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The 
secretion of mα-KL into the extracellular environment facilitated downstream 
processes and warranted low-cost purification in high-titer. Furthermore, the 
anticarcinogenic efficiency of recombinant mα-KL was examined and validated on 
Rattus norvegicus AR42J pancreas tumors. Microalgae-based photosynthetic, 
low-cost, and scalable production of mα-KL could be used to develop a variety of 
cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and wellness products, all aimed at serving health 
and well-being.

BACKGROUND: Theories from anthropology, evolutionary psychology, and sociology 
have focused on the potential adaptive benefits of hobby engagement for mental 
health in older adults. However, previous studies have used data from single 
countries, potentially biased by specific measurement and methodological 
approaches, cohort effects, or cultural specificities. Whether there are genuine 
benefits for mental health in older adults cross-culturally remains unknown. 
This study explored the consistency of this association across 16 different 
nations.
METHODS: For this epidemiological study, we used data from adults aged 65 years 
or older across 16 countries in the USA, Europe, and Asia, represented in five 
longitudinal studies (ELSA, JAGES, HRS, SHARE and CHARLS; N=93 263, 45-62% 
female, mean age 72-76 years, data collected 2008-20). We harmonised measures of 
self-reported engagement in hobbies and past-times, depressive symptoms 
(validated scales), and Likert scale responses for self-reported health, 
happiness, and life satisfaction. We conducted fixed-effects models and 
longitudinal regression models of hobbies and mental health for each country and 
then pooled in multinational meta-analyses. We accounted for all time-constant 
factors including those unobserved (eg, genetics, past leisure behaviour, 
medical history, psychological traits) and identified time-varying factors (eg, 
sociodemographic background, clinical conditions, daily functioning). We tested 
the potential moderating effects of country-level determinants of health in 
meta-regressions and multilevel models.
FINDINGS: Meta-analytic fixed-effects findings showed that having a hobby was 
associated with fewer depressive symptoms (pooled coefficient -0·10, 95% CI 
-0·13 to -0·07, I2=69·5%, H2=3·28), and higher levels of self-reported health 
(0·06, 0·03 to 0·08, I2=48·1%, H2=1·93), happiness (0·09, 0·06 to 0·13, 
I2=67·0%, H2=3·03), and life satisfaction (0·10, 0·08 to 0·12, I2=33·6%, 
H2=1·51). Results were consistent in meta-analyses of longitudinal regression 
models testing directionality of findings. Macro-level factors such as life 
expectancy, world happiness index, country wealth, and income inequality 
predicted prevalence of hobby engagement, but they showed only marginal 
moderating effects on the association between hobbies and mental health.
INTERPRETATION: Despite some heterogeneity in measurement between the cohorts, 
the apparent universality of the health benefits of hobbies internationally 
suggests that facilitating greater opportunities for engagement across 
demographic groups and between countries could be an important part of 
multidisciplinary care. Findings have implications for social prescribing 
schemes (currently in trial in many countries) and multidisciplinary work on 
origins and human behavioural patterns of hobby engagement.

BACKGROUND: The Welsh government recently set a target to be smoke-free by 2030, 
which means reducing the prevalence of tobacco smoking in adults to 5% by then. 
The goal is to improve health and population life expectancy. To support this 
strategy, we identified profile groups with different sets of socioeconomic and 
demographic characteristics within the population of smokers. We compared these 
profiles to those identified in the ex-smoker population to provide a broader 
understanding of smokers and inform targeting of interventions and policy.
METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study using data from the National Survey for 
Wales. This survey is a random sample telephone survey of individuals aged 16 
years and older across Wales carried out from Sept 1, 2021 to Jan 31, 2022, 
weighted to be representative of the Welsh population. For the smoking subgroup, 
we did a weighted hierarchical cluster analysis with multiple imputation to 
impute missing data and repeated it for ex-smokers. In total, 63 survey 
variables were used in the analysis. These variables included smoking history, 
e-cigarette use, sociodemographics, lifestyle factors, individual-level 
deprivation, general health and long-term conditions, mental health, and 
wellbeing.
FINDINGS: Among the 6407 respondents (weighted proportions: 49% male, 51% 
female; 28% aged 16-34 years, 46% aged 35-44 years, 26% aged ≥65 years; 95% 
white, 5% other ethnicity), 841 (13%) smoked and 2136 (33%) were ex-smokers. 
Four distinctive profiles of smokers were identified, the groups were of 
relatively comparable size and characterised by similarities described as (1) 
high-risk alcohol drinkers and without children; (2) single, mostly in social 
housing, and poor health and mental health; (3) mostly single, younger, tried 
e-cigarettes, and poor mental health; (4) older couples and poor health; when 
comparing the groups with each other. Cluster quality and validation statistics 
were considered fair: silhouette coefficient=0·09, Dunn index (Dunn2)=1·06. 
Generally, ex-smoker clusters differed from smoking clusters because of themes 
related to increased sickness, better affluence, employment, and older age (≥75 
years).
INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that not all smokers are the same, and they 
do not fall into one coherent group. Smoking cessation interventions to improve 
the health of ageing populations might need a different approach to consider a 
wider context or motivations to inform targeted quitting. It is acknowledged 
that smoking might be underreported because of perceived social unacceptability.

evaluation of a behavioural weight management programme from the GLoW trial: a 
methodological study.

BACKGROUND: In economic evaluations, average intervention effects are usually 
applied to a population. However, this fails to reflect the change in the 
distribution of HbA1c due to heterogeneous responses to weight loss. We aimed to 
investigate whether allowing heterogeneous treatment effects using a beta 
regression better represented the distribution of HbA1c after a weight-loss 
intervention, and how this affected cost effectiveness.
METHODS: The Glucose Lowering through Weight Management (GLoW) trial evaluated 
the effectiveness of a diabetes education and weight-loss intervention against a 
standard diabetes education programme. Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 
within 3 years were recruited from Clinical Commissioning Groups across 159 
sites in England from July 20, 2018, to July 22, 2018. Ethics approval 
(18/ES/0048) and participant informed consent were obtained. Considering the 
between-treatment-arm difference in HbA1c after 12 months, we compared a 
mean-effect estimated from a mixed-effects regression to a heterogeneous effect 
estimated from a beta regression performed on 12-month HbA1c conditional on 
baseline HbA1c, gender, diabetes duration and intervention group. We used the 
School of Public Health Research (SPHR) Diabetes Treatment model to apply these 
treatment effects and evaluate the lifetime NHS costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), discounted at 3·5%. The microsimulation model estimated 
diabetes-related health outcomes using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study 
Outcomes Model 2 risk equations and risk factor trajectory equations, alongside 
estimating diabetes remission, osteoarthritis, and cancer. We calculated the 
incremental net benefit (INB) of the intervention using a £20 000 per QALY 
valuation, by deterministic analysis. The GLoW trial is registered with the 
ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN18399564.
FINDINGS: The trial recruited 577 participants (mean age 60 years; 278 [53%] 
female, 247 [47%] male; 474 [91%] white ethnic background). Applying 
heterogeneous HbA1c changes better reproduced the skewness in post-intervention 
HbA1c than applying a mean-effect (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p=0·02 compared with 
p=0·0000007). The beta-regression method suggested the intervention was more 
cost-effective, estimating an INB of £736 per person, compared with £584 when 
applying the mean-effect.
INTERPRETATION: Alternative regression specification methods should be 
considered when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of interventions if the key 
intervention outcomes are not normally distributed. However, this alternative 
method requires further investigation to conclude its appropriateness in 
evaluating cost-effectiveness in different contexts.

The yellow-spined bamboo locust (YSBL), Ceracris kiangsu Tsai, has historically 
had a significant impact on different bamboo varieties in East Asia and 
Southeast Asia. Since 2014, there have been many outbreaks of YSBL populations 
in Laos, and YSBLs subsequently invaded Southwest China in 2020 and 2023. 
However, there was limited information about the damage to staple crops. Life 
table parameters and fitness parameters were assessed using wheat, rice, waxy 
maize, and sweet maize under three different temperatures (25 °C, 30 °C, and 35 
°C) in the laboratory. The results indicated that the YSBLs feeding on wheat 
seedlings displayed a significantly higher survival rate, a shorter 
developmental time, and a higher adult emergence rate compared to YSBLs feeding 
on the other host species at 30 °C. The developmental durations of 1st and 3rd 
instar YSBLs on wheat (1st: 8.21 ± 0.35 d; 3rd: 6.32 ± 0.34 d) and rice (1st: 
7.19 ± 0.23 d; 3rd: 9.00 ± 0.66 d) were significantly shorter than those of 1st 
and 3rd instar YSBLs on waxy maize (1st: 13.62 ± 1.22 d; 3rd: 13.67 ± 6.33 d) 
and sweet maize (1st: 16.00 ± 1.79 d; 3rd: 18.00 ± 3.49 d) at 30 °C. The body 
lengths of male and female YSBLs on wheat (male: 29.52 ± 0.40 mm, female: 34.97 
± 0.45 mm) and rice (male: 28.85 ± 0.68 mm, female: 34.66 ± 0.35 mm) were 
significantly longer than those observed when they were fed on sweet maize 
(male: 25.64 ± 1.60 mm, female: 21.93 ± 6.89 mm). There were only male adults 
obtained on waxy maize. The phenotypic characteristics of the YSBLs feeding on 
rice seedlings were very close to those of the YSBLs feeding on wheat seedlings. 
A relatively slower decline was observed in the survival rates of YSBL nymphs on 
wheat and rice compared to those on waxy maize and sweet maize at 25 °C, 30 °C, 
and 35 °C. In short, this study implied that YSBLs prefer wheat and rice. This 
study is the first report of direct damage caused by the YSBL to wheat in the 
laboratory, and its results could be useful in improving our understanding of 
the host preference of the YSBL and providing strategies for the management of 
this pest in field crops.

This study presents a technique for detecting 3'-5' exonuclease activity through 
the use of CRISPR/Cas12a. These enzymes, including 3'-5' exonuclease (Exo III), 
perform crucial roles in various cellular processes and are associated with life 
expectancy. However, imbalances in their expression can increase susceptibility 
to diseases such as cancer, particularly under prolonged stress. In this study, 
an activator sequence of CRISPR/Cas12a was constructed on the 5'-end of a 
hairpin probe (HP), forming a blunt end. When the 3'-end of the HP was 
hydrolyzed with Exo III activity, the activator sequence of Cas12a was exposed, 
which led to collateral cleavage of the DNA signal probe and generated a 
fluorescent signal, allowing sensitive and highly specific Exo III detection. 
This detection principle relied on the fact that Exo III exclusively cleaves the 
3'-end mononucleotide of dsDNA and does not affect ssDNA. Based on this 
strategy, Exo III activity was successfully assayed at 0.0073 U/mL, 
demonstrating high sensitivity. In addition, this technique was used to screen 
candidate inhibitors of Exo III activity.

BACKGROUND: Traffic injuries include acute low back pain (LBP) needing active 
treatment to prevent chronicity. This two-armed, parallel, assessor-blinded, 
randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness and safety of 
progressive loading-motion style acupuncture treatment (PL-MSAT) for acute LBP 
following traffic accidents.
METHODS: Based on an effect size of 1.03, 104 participants were recruited and 
divided in a 1:1 ratio into PL-MAST and control groups using block 
randomization. Both groups underwent integrative Korean medicine treatment 
(IKMT) daily; only the PL-MSAT group underwent three PL-MSAT sessions. The 
outcomes were assessed before and after the treatment sessions and at 1 and 3 
months post-discharge. The primary outcome was the difference in the numeric 
rating scale (NRS) for LBP. The secondary outcomes included a visual analog 
scale for LBP, leg pain status, the Oswestry disability index, lumbar active 
range of motion (ROM), quality of life, Patient Global Impression of Change, and 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist adverse events.
RESULTS: In the modified intention-to-treat analysis, 50 and 51 participants 
were included in the PL-MSAT and control groups. On Day 4, the mean LBP NRS 
score was 3.67 (3.44-3.90) in the PL-MSAT group, indicating a significantly 
lower NRS 0.77 (0.44-1.11) compared to 4.44 (4.20-4.68) for the control group (p 
< 0.001). The PL-MSAT group exhibited greater ROM flexion (-5.31; -8.15 to 
-2.48) and extension (-2.09; -3.39 to -0.80). No significant differences were 
found for the secondary outcomes and follow-ups.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with IKMT alone, PL-MSAT plus IKMT showed significantly 
better outcomes for reducing pain and increasing the ROM in acute LBP.

Pain continues to be a significant problem for cancer patients, and the impact 
of a population-based strategy on their experiences is not completely 
understood. Our study aimed to determine the impact of palliative care on 
mitigating pain and its associated effects in determining the quality of life 
(QoL) among colon cancer outpatients. Six collection databases were used to 
perform a structured systematic review of the available literature, considering 
all papers published between the year 2000 and February 2023. PRISMA guidelines 
were adopted in our study, and a total of 9792 papers were evaluated. However, 
only 126 articles met the inclusion criteria. A precise diagnosis of disruptive 
colorectal cancer (CRC) pain disorders among patients under palliative care is 
necessary to mitigate it and its associated effects, enhance health, promote 
life expectancy, increase therapeutic responsiveness, and decrease comorbidity 
complications. Physical activities, the use of validated pain assessment tools, 
remote outpatient education and monitoring, chemotherapeutic pain reduction 
strategies, music and massage therapies, and bridging social isolation gaps are 
essential in enhancing QoL. We recommend and place a strong emphasis on the 
adoption of online training/or coaching programs and the integration of formal 
and informal palliative care systems for maximum QoL benefits among CRC 
outpatients.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established alternative to 
surgery in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and has expanded its 
indications to even low-surgical-risk patients. Conduction abnormalities (CA) 
and permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantations remain a relatively common finding 
post TAVI due to the close proximity of the conduction system to the aortic 
root. New onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) and high-grade atrioventricular 
block are the most commonly reported CA post TAVI. The overall rate of PPM 
implantation post TAVI varies and is related to pre- and intra-procedural 
factors. Therefore, when screening patients for TAVI, Heart Teams should take 
under consideration the various anatomical, pathophysiological and procedural 
conditions that predispose to CA and PPM requirement after the procedure. This 
is particularly important as TAVI is being offered to younger patients with 
longer life-expectancy. Herein, we highlight the incidence, predictors, impact 
and management of CA in patients undergoing TAVI.

Comorbidity rates in the geriatric population have increased because of rising 
life expectancy; thus, patients have had to use more medications. Type 2 
diabetes mellitus, one of the most common diseases, may influence the number of 
drugs used in geriatric patients. The present study was designed to investigate 
the association between the level of type 2 DM and polypharmacy. Fifty patients 
with type 2 diabetes over the age of 65 were included according to the inclusion 
criteria; 23 were well-controlled and 27 had poorly controlled diabetes. The 
groups were similar in terms of age, sex, WBC, Hb, Plt, AST, ALT, serum 
creatinine, fasting glucose, and eGFR levels. Patients with HbA1c values above 
7.5 were classified as poorly controlled diabetes patients, and those below were 
considered well-controlled diabetes patients and were evaluated for 
inappropriate medication use. The number of medications used daily by the cases 
(p < 0.001), the number of concomitant diseases (p = 0.001), and the number of 
increased risks according to the Beers Criteria (p = 0.02) were observed to be 
high in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects. HbA1c levels were 
related to the number of medications (r = 0.4, p = 0.004), comorbidities (r = 
0.28, p = 0.04), and the number of increased risks according to the Beers 
Criteria (r = 0.31, p = 0.014). In conclusion, the number of medications used in 
patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus was found to be more 
elevated than in individuals with well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. The 
HbA1c values varied among patients regarding polypharmacy, comorbidities, and 
increased risks according to the Beers Criteria.

Dental caries are an oral infectious disease that can affect human health both 
orally and systemically. It remains an urgent issue to establish a novel 
antibacterial method to prevent oral infection for a healthy life expectancy. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effects of novel iron 
chelators, super-polyphenols (SPs), on the cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus 
mutans, in vitro. SPs were developed to reduce the side effects of iron 
chelation therapy and were either water-soluble or insoluble depending on their 
isoforms. We found that SP6 and SP10 inhibited bacterial growth equivalent to 
povidone-iodine, and viability tests indicated that their effects were 
bacteriostatic. These results suggest that SP6 and SP10 have the potential to 
control oral bacterial infections such as Streptococcus mutans.

Floccularia luteovirens, a rare wild edible and medicinal fungus, is endemic to 
the Tibetan plateau. However, attempts to artificially domesticate this species 
have not been successful, resulting in extremely limited utilization of this 
valuable resource. This paper presents the geographical distribution of F. 
luteovirens, along with its ecological and biological characteristics. It 
explores population relations, symbiotic relationships, soil microbial community 
relations, fruiting body occurrence conditions, nutritional metabolism, and 
reproductive patterns. The cultivation techniques, as well as the edible and 
medicinal value of this mushroom, are also reviewed. Through an overall analysis 
of the physiological characteristics and current research status of F. 
luteovirens, the paper discusses its development prospects. The aim is to 
provide a reference for other researchers and promote its artificial 
domestication, resource development, and utilization.

Patients with incurable cancers have an increasing number of comorbidities, 
which can lead to polypharmacy and its associated adverse events (drug-to-drug 
interaction, prescription of a potentially inappropriate medication, adverse 
drug event). Deprescribing is a patient-centered process aimed at optimizing 
patient outcomes by discontinuing medication(s) deemed no longer necessary or 
potentially inappropriate. Improved patient quality of life, risk reduction of 
side effects or worse clinical outcomes, and a decrease in healthcare costs are 
well-documented benefits of deprescribing. Deprescribing and advance care 
planning both require consideration of patients' values, preferences, and care 
goals. Here, we provide an overview of comorbidities and associated polypharmacy 
risks in cancer patients, as well as useful tools and resources for 
deprescribing in daily practice, and we shed light on how deprescribing can 
facilitate advance care planning discussions with patients who have advanced 
cancer or a limited life expectancy.

Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is thought to be associated with life 
expectancy and anti-aging. Although skeletal muscle disorders are often found in 
diabetic people, the clinical significance of DHEAS in skeletal muscle remains 
unclear. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether DHEAS is associated with the 
development of skeletal muscle disorders in individuals with type 2 diabetes 
(T2D). A cross-sectional study was conducted in 361 individuals with T2D. Serum 
DHEAS levels, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), handgrip strength (HS), and gait 
speed (GS) were measured in the participants. Pre-sarcopenia, sarcopenia, and 
dynapenia were defined according to the definitions of the AWGS 2019 criteria. 
DHEAS level was positively associated with HS but not with SMI or GS after 
adjustment of confounding factors. Multiple logistic regression analyses in 
total subjects showed that DHEAS level had an inverse association with the 
prevalence of dynapenia but not with the prevalence of pre-sarcopenia or 
sarcopenia. Furthermore, a significant association between DHEAS level and 
dynapenia was found in males but not in females. ROC curve analysis indicated 
that cutoff values of serum DHEAS for risk of dynapenia in males was 92.0 μg/dL. 
Therefore, in male individuals with T2D who have low serum levels of DHEAS, 
adequate exercise might be needed to prevent dynapenia.

Aging is not a disease; it is a natural evolution of human physiology. Medical 
advances have extended our life expectancy, but chronic diseases and geriatric 
syndrome continue to affect the increasingly aging population. Yet modern 
medicine perpetuates an approach based on treatment rather than prevention and 
education. In order to help solve this ever-growing problem, a new discipline 
has emerged: lifestyle medicine. Nutrition, physical activity, stress 
management, restorative sleep, social connection, and avoidance of risky 
substances are the pillars on which lifestyle medicine is founded. The aim of 
this discipline is to increase healthspan and reduce the duration of morbidity 
by making changes to our lifestyle. In this review, we propose the use of klotho 
protein as a novel biomarker for lifestyle medicine in order to quantify and 
monitor the health status of individuals, as no integrative tool currently 
exists.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides an appropriate microenvironment for many 
kinds of cells, including pancreatic cells. Collagens are the most abundant 
components of the ECM. Type I, IV, V and VI collagen has been detected in 
pancreatic islets, and each type plays important role in the proliferation, 
survival, function and differentiation of pancreatic cells. In some cases, 
collagens show behaviours similar to those of growth factors and regulate the 
biological behaviour of β cells by binding with certain growth factors, 
including IGFs, EGFs and FGFs. The transcriptional coactivator YAP/TAZ has been 
widely recognised as a mechanosensor that senses changes in the physical 
characteristics of the ECM and inhibition of YAP/TAZ enhances insulin production 
and secretion. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease 
characterised by the destruction of insulin-producing β cells. The crosstalk 
between collagens and immune cells plays a key role in the development and 
differentiation of immune cells. Further, Supplementation with collagens during 
islet transplantation is a promising strategy for improving the quality of the 
islets. But, excessive collagen deposition results in pancreatic fibrosis and 
pancreatic carcinoma. Targeting inhibit Piezo, autophagy or IL-6 may reduce 
excessive collagen deposition-induced pancreatic fibrosis and pancreatic 
carcinoma. This review provides insights into the treatment of T1DM to prolong 
life expectancy and provides the potential targets for treating collagen 
deposition-induced pancreatic fibrosis and pancreatic carcinoma.
