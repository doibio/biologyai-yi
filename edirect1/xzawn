dynamic supervision. The remote results are studied at 32 (62,7%) persons. Term 
of supervision has made from 6 till 168 months on the average. Postoperative 
lethal cases at scheduled operations were 4,7%, the general postoperative lethal 
cases were about - 11,7%. At the analysis of the remote results it is 
established, that the survival rate in a year has made 100 %, 5 years - 83,3% of 
patients. Average life expectancy in the given group of patients has made 76,4 ± 
4 years, that there corresponds to data the WOHC for a healthy population. 
Dynamic supervision in both groups has shown progressing current of aneurysms 
combination in all arterial parts. Our data show perspectivity of surgical 
treatment aneurysms of an aorta and the main arteries except for patients with 
multistorey aneurysmosis arteries of legs in a combination to the continued 
thrombosis, in which treatment we adhere conservative tactics.

Medicine was revolutionized in the last two centuries and its advances have more 
than doubled life expectancy. Nevertheless, some problems are as old as mankind 
and although the underlying causes might have changed, the problems themselves 
have not. Musculoskeletal disorders and tooth loss are such problems; they are 
the major reasons for the ever-growing need for bone replacement, which cannot 
always be realized by autologous material. New, multidisciplinary strategies are 
needed for the development of novel materials to meet the demand. 
Stem-cell-based approaches combined with newly designed scaffold materials seem 
to be promising tools for constructing tissue replacements. Human mesenchymal 
stem cells and their remarkable differentiation potential are an interesting 
cell source for the development of bio-engineered tissues. Scaffolds based on 
natural and synthetic materials with or without the use of bioactive molecules 
are constructed to mimic the natural environment. They can improve proliferation 
and differentiation of the scaffold-seeded cells. Combined, they can provide 
specific remedies for hard tissue replacement, which will be discussed in this 
chapter.

Consolidated bioprocessing strategy for ethanol production from Jerusalem 
artichoke tubers by Kluyveromyces marxianus under high gravity conditions.

AIMS: Developing an innovative process for ethanol fermentation from Jerusalem 
artichoke tubers under very high gravity (VHG) conditions.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) strategy that integrated 
inulinase production, saccharification of inulin contained in Jerusalem 
artichoke tubers and ethanol production from sugars released from inulin by the 
enzyme was developed with the inulinase-producing yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus 
Y179 and fed-batch operation. The impact of inoculum age, aeration, the 
supplementation of pectinase and nutrients on the ethanol fermentation 
performance of the CBP system was studied. Although inulinase activities 
increased with the extension of the seed incubation time, its contribution to 
ethanol production was negligible because vigorously growing yeast cells 
harvested earlier carried out ethanol fermentation more efficiently. Thus, the 
overnight incubation that has been practised in ethanol production from 
starch-based feedstocks is recommended. Aeration facilitated the fermentation 
process, but compromised ethanol yield because of the negative Crabtree effect 
of the species, and increases the risk of contamination under industrial 
conditions. Therefore, nonaeration conditions are preferred for the CBP system. 
Pectinase supplementation reduced viscosity of the fermentation broth and 
improved ethanol production performance, particularly under high gravity 
conditions, but the enzyme cost should be carefully balanced. Medium 
optimization was performed, and ethanol concentration as high as 94·2 g l(-1) 
was achieved when 0·15 g l(-1) K(2) HPO(4) was supplemented, which presents a 
significant progress in ethanol production from Jerusalem artichoke tubers.
CONCLUSIONS: A CBP system using K. marxianus is suitable for efficient ethanol 
production from Jerusalem artichoke tubers under VHG conditions.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Jerusalem artichoke tubers are an 
alternative to grain-based feedstocks for ethanol production. The high ethanol 
concentration achieved using K. marxianus with the CBP system not only saves 
energy consumption for ethanol distillation, but also significantly reduces the 
amount of waste distillage discharged from the distillation system.

BACKGROUND: The selection criteria for phase III trials are often stringent. We 
aimed to determine how many advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients 
would have been eligible for phase III targeted therapy trials and the 
proportion receiving anticancer treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 2007 to May 2008, all advanced NSCLC patients 
presented at our lung cancer multidisciplinary team meeting were included to 
assess eligibility for the targeted therapy trials: ECOG-4599, AVAiL, FLEX, 
TALENT, INTACT-1, INTACT-2, ESCAPE, NEXUS and MONET1. Medical records were 
examined to determine treatment utilisation and overall survival.
RESULTS: A total of 62 patients were registered: 63% male; median age 71 years; 
61% stage IIIB disease. Percentages that met criteria were: ECOG-4599 31%, AVAiL 
24%, FLEX 69%, TALENT 27%, INTACT-1 50%, INTACT-2 42%, ESCAPE 39%, NEXUS 63% and 
MONET1 34%. Common reasons for ineligibility were insufficient life expectancy, 
poor performance status, abnormal bloods, proteinuria and associated cancer 
problems. Systemic therapies were received by 66% of patients and median 
survival was 10.3 months.
CONCLUSION: Only 24%-69% were eligible for targeted therapy trials but 66% 
received anticancer treatment. Clinical trials in patients with advanced NSCLC 
need to be more representative of the majority of patients.

This cross-sectional epidemiological study aimed to calculate the potential 
years of life lost by female homicide victims in Recife, Pernambuco State, 
Brazil, in 2003-2007. A database was used from the Operational Division for 
Information on Births and Deaths under the Recife Municipal Health Department. 
All death certificates for childbearing-age women were reviewed for the 
five-year period. The results showed a total of 12,120 potential years of life 
lost by these women, mostly young, black (88%), with unknown levels of schooling 
(78.2%), single (80%), in District III of the city, and murdered with firearms 
in their own homes. The specific mortality rate was 10.8 homicides per 100,000 
childbearing-age women. The 43.3 years of life lost per woman express the city's 
characteristics, poverty levels, unemployment, population density, residential 
instability, and social inequality, exposing residents to social strife, crime, 
and violence.

Southampton.

This article examines changes between 1984 and 2007 in the demographic and 
socio-economic circumstances of British men and women in mid-life. Changing 
living arrangements in mid-life reflect historical changes in the occurrence and 
timing of life events such as marriage and parenthood, as well as increased 
longevity. In order to place mid-life in this wider demographic context, the 
article first reviews changes over time in kin availability across the adult 
life course using the British Household Panel Survey (2001) and Understanding 
Society (2009). The article goes on to use data from the General Household 
Survey (1984-2007) to document shifts over time in living arrangements for those 
aged 20- 79. In the final part of the article we focus specifically on those 
aged between 45 and 64 and examine how their characteristics in terms of marital 
status, educational attainment, activity status and housing tenure have changed 
over the past quarter century.

Measuring unmet need for social care amongst older people.

Vlachantoni A(1), Shaw R, Willis R, Evandrou M, Falkingham J, Luff R.

Recent spending cuts in the area of adult social care raise policy concerns 
about the proportion of older people whose need for social care is not being 
met. Such concerns are emphasised in the context of population ageing and other 
demographic changes. For example, the increasing proportion of the population 
aged 75 and over places greater pressure on formal and informal systems of care 
and support provision, while changes in the living arrangements of older people 
may affect the supply of informal care within the household. This article 
explores the concept of 'unmet need' for support in relation to specific 
Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living 
(IADLs), using data on the receipt of support (informal, formal state or formal 
paid) from the General Household Survey, the English Longitudinal Study of 
Ageing and the British Household Panel Survey. The results show that different 
kinds of need tend to be supported by particular sources of care, and that there 
is a significant level of 'unmet need' for certain activities.

Intergenerational replacement and migration in the countries and regions of the 
United Kingdom, 1971-2009.

Wilson C(1), Williamson L.

Author information:

University of St Andrews.

This article uses a recently proposed measure, the overall replacement ratio or 
ORR, to assess the extent to which migration alters intergenerational 
replacement within the United Kingdom. The UK as a whole can be seen to 
experience 'replacement migration' as immigration compensates for fertility 
below the replacement level. However, the article shows that the impact of 
migration differs radically in the different regions of the country. South East 
England experiences very substantial immigration from both the rest of the UK 
and overseas, far more than is needed for intergenerational replacement, whereas 
most of the rest of the UK sees little or no net immigration and the ORR remains 
below the replacement level.

Mortality of the 'Golden Generation': what can the ONS Longitudinal study tell 
us?

Goldring S(1), Henretty N, Mills J, Johnson K, Smallwood S.

Author information:
(1)Office for National Statistics.

It is well documented that the generations born around 1930 are consistently 
exhibiting higher rates of mortality improvement than the generations either 
side of them. There is currently no evidence that these differentials are 
declining. In current ONS National Population Projections, it is assumed that 
these cohorts will continue to experience higher rates of improvement. However, 
it is not yet precisely clear why this is so. This article details preliminary 
research carried out using the ONS Longitudinal Study to try to understand 
better why the members of the generation born around 1930 have been enjoying 
higher rates of mortality improvement throughout their adult life.

BACKGROUND: We evaluated mortality among 11,311 former U.S. flight attendants. 
The primary a priori outcomes of interest were breast cancer and melanoma.
METHODS: Vital status was ascertained through 2007, and life table analyses was 
conducted. Cumulative exposure to cosmic radiation and circadian rhythm 
disruption were estimated from work history data and historical published flight 
schedules.
RESULTS: All-cause mortality was less than expected among women but was elevated 
among men, primarily due to elevated HIV-related disease mortality. Mortality 
from breast cancer among women and melanoma was neither significantly elevated 
nor related to metrics of exposure. Mortality was elevated for non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma among men; for alcoholism, drowning, and intentional self-harm among 
women; and for railway, water, and air transportation accidents.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of increased breast cancer or melanoma 
mortality. Limitations include reliance on mortality data and limited power 
resulting from few melanoma deaths and relatively short employment durations.

Impact of reproductive health on socio-economic development: a case study of 
Nigeria.

Azikiwe University, Nnewi Campus, Nnewi, Nigeria.

The link between reproductive health, sexual and reproductive right, and 
development was highlighted at the International Conference on Population and 
Development held in Egypt. Developmental disparities are related to 
socio-economic differences which have led to the identification of distinct 
socio-economic classifications of nations. Human development represents the 
socioeconomic standing of any nation, in addition to literacy status and life 
expectancy. Africa accounts for 25% of the world's landmass but remains the 
world's poorest continent. Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, has 
policies and programmes geared towards the improvement of its socio-economic 
standing and overal development, with little positive result. Reproductive 
health is a panacea towards reversing the stalled socio-economic growth of 
Nigeria as evident from the linkage between reproductive health and development, 
highlighted in Millennium Development Goals 3, 4, 5 and 6. Fast tracking 
Nigeria's development requires implementation of reproductive health policies 
and programmes targeted on women and children.

Sciences, Iran.

BACKGROUND: The Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) was designed by the World 
Health Organization (WHO) to measure, compare, and analyze the burden of various 
diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the 
assessment of burden of traumatic spinal fracture (TSF) in an Iranian community. 
We estimated burden of TSF includes both isolated (iTSF) and associated injuries 
related to traumatic spinal fractures (aTSF) in Tehran, the capital of Iran, for 
the year 2006-2007 using DALYs.
METHODS: Burden of TSF was estimated based on information provided by the 
national data on Iranian trauma, data from the WHO, and literature data using 
disease modeling (DISMOD). Incidence of TSF and associated injuries were 
obtained from two population based studies and National Trauma Data Bank in 
Iran, while duration, and relative risk of mortality (RRM) were obtained from 
WHO data and the literature. The incidence, duration, and relative risk of 
mortality (RRM) were used to calculate DALY for TSF. To calculate DALY, the 
years of life lost because of premature mortality (YLL) were added to the number 
of years lost because of disability (YLD). DALYs were calculated separately for 
both iTSF and aTSF. In-hospital YLD and post-hospital YLL for iTSF and 
in-hospital YLL and YLD were calculated for aTSFs.
RESULTS: TSF incidence was 16.35 (95%CI: 3.4-48.0) per 100,000. The incidence of 
TSF in males was more than twice that of females. The largest DALYs were seen in 
15-29 years. The highest burden of associated injuries of TSF was related to 
spinal cord and head injury. DALYs for aTSF were estimated to be 2496.9 years 
(32.0 DALY/100,000 population). The YLD and YLL were almost similar. Total DALY 
for iTSF and aTSF was 2568.9 years (32.92 DALY/100,000 population). Based on the 
risk extracted from the literature, post-hospital increased risk of mortality 
was increased by 1318 DALY (16.89 DALY/100,000 population).
CONCLUSION: This study showed a considerable burden for TSFs mainly due to 
associated injuries and increased lifelong RRM in patients with TSF.

National and subnational mortality effects of metabolic risk factors and smoking 
in Iran: a comparative risk assessment.

BACKGROUND: Mortality from cardiovascular and other chronic diseases has 
increased in Iran. Our aim was to estimate the effects of smoking and high 
systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), total cholesterol 
(TC), and high body mass index (BMI) on mortality and life expectancy, 
nationally and subnationally, using representative data and comparable methods.
METHODS: We used data from the Non-Communicable Disease Surveillance Survey to 
estimate means and standard deviations for the metabolic risk factors, 
nationally and by region. Lung cancer mortality was used to measure cumulative 
exposure to smoking. We used data from the death registration system to estimate 
age-, sex-, and disease-specific numbers of deaths in 2005, adjusted for 
incompleteness using demographic methods. We used systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses of epidemiologic studies to obtain the effect of risk factors on 
disease-specific mortality. We estimated deaths and life expectancy loss 
attributable to risk factors using the comparative risk assessment framework.
RESULTS: In 2005, high SBP was responsible for 41,000 (95% uncertainty interval: 
38,000, 44,000) deaths in men and 39,000 (36,000, 42,000) deaths in women in 
Iran. High FPG, BMI, and TC were responsible for about one-third to one-half of 
deaths attributable to SBP in men and/or women. Smoking was responsible for 
9,000 deaths among men and 2,000 among women. If SBP were reduced to optimal 
levels, life expectancy at birth would increase by 3.2 years (2.6, 3.9) and 4.1 
years (3.2, 4.9) in men and women, respectively; the life expectancy gains 
ranged from 1.1 to 1.8 years for TC, BMI, and FPG. SBP was also responsible for 
the largest number of deaths in every region, with age-standardized attributable 
mortality ranging from 257 to 333 deaths per 100,000 adults in different 
regions.
DISCUSSION: Management of blood pressure through diet, lifestyle, and 
pharmacological interventions should be a priority in Iran. Interventions for 
other metabolic risk factors and smoking can also improve population health.

The burden of premature mortality in Spain using standard expected years of life 
lost: a population-based study.

BACKGROUND: Measures of premature mortality have been used to guide debates on 
future health priorities and to monitor the population health status. Standard 
expected years of life lost (SEYLL) is one of the methods used to assess the 
time lost due to premature death. This article affords an overview of premature 
mortality in Spain for the year 2008.
METHODS: A population-based study was conducted estimating SEYLL by sex and age 
groups. SEYLL, a key component of the disability-adjusted life years measure of 
disease burden, was calculated using Princeton West standard life tables with 
life expectancy at birth fixed at 80 years for males and 82.5 years for females. 
Population data and specific death records were obtained from the official 
registers of the National Institute of Statistics. All data were analysed and 
prepared in GesMor and Epidat software packages.
RESULTS: The burden of premature mortality was estimated at 2.1 million SEYLL 
when age at death is taken into account. Males lost 60.9% and females lost 39.1% 
of total SEYLL. Malignant tumors (34.5%) and cardiovascular diseases (24.0%) 
were the leading categories in terms of SEYLL. Ischaemic heart disease (8.5%) 
and lung cancers (8.0%) were the most common specific causes of SEYLL followed 
by cerebrovascular diseases (5.9%), colorectal cancer (4.1%), road traffic 
accidents (3.5%), Alzheimer and other dementias (2.9%), chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (2.8%), breast cancer (2.8%) and suicides (2.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: In Spain, premature mortality was essentially due to chronic 
non-communicable diseases. Data provided in this study are relevant for a more 
balanced health agenda aimed at reducing the burden of premature mortality. This 
study also represents a first step in estimating the overall burden of disease 
in terms of premature death and disability.

Comment in
    CMAJ. 2011 Nov 8;183(16):1821-3.

BACKGROUND: Although statins have been shown to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular events in patients at low cardiovascular risk, their absolute 
benefit is small in the short term, which may adversely affect 
cost-effectiveness. We sought to determine the long-term cost-effectiveness 
(beyond the duration of clinical trials) of low- and high-potency statins in 
patients at low cardiovascular risk and to estimate the impact on Canada's 
publicly funded health care system.
METHODS: Using Markov modelling, we performed a cost-utility analysis in which 
we compared low-potency statins (fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and 
simvastatin) and high-potency statins (atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) with no 
statins in a simulated cohort of low-risk patients over a lifetime horizon. 
Model outcomes included costs (in 2010 Canadian dollars), quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) gained and the cost per QALY gained.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, the cost of managing a patient at low 
cardiovascular risk was estimated to be about $10,100 without statins, $15,200 
with low-potency statins and $16,400 with high-potency statins. The cost per 
QALY gained with high-potency statins (v. no statins) was $21 300; the use of 
low-potency statins was not considered economically attractive. These results 
were robust to sensitivity analyses, although their use became economically 
unattractive when the duration of benefit from statin use was assumed to be less 
than 10 years.
INTERPRETATION: Use of high-potency statins in patients at low cardiovascular 
risk was associated with a cost per QALY gained that was economically attractive 
by current standards, assuming that the benefit from statin use would continue 
for at least 10 years. However, the overall expenditure on statins would be 
substantial, and the ramifications of this practice should be carefully 
considered by policy-makers.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate life expectancy for people with HIV undergoing treatment 
compared with life expectancy in the general population and to assess the impact 
on life expectancy of late treatment, defined as CD4 count <200 cells/mm(3) at 
start of antiretroviral therapy.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: Outpatient HIV clinics throughout the United Kingdom. Population Adult 
patients from the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (UK CHIC) Study with CD4 count ≤ 
350 cells/mm(3) at start of antiretroviral therapy in 1996-2008.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy at the exact age of 20 (the average 
additional years that will be lived by a person after age 20), according to the 
cross sectional age specific mortality rates during the study period.
RESULTS: 1248 of 17,661 eligible patients died during 91,203 person years' 
follow-up. Life expectancy (standard error) at exact age 20 increased from 30.0 
(1.2) to 45.8 (1.7) years from 1996-9 to 2006-8. Life expectancy was 39.5 (0.45) 
for male patients and 50.2 (0.45) years for female patients compared with 57.8 
and 61.6 years for men and women in the general population (1996-2006). Starting 
antiretroviral therapy later than guidelines suggest resulted in up to 15 years' 
loss of life: at age 20, life expectancy was 37.9 (1.3), 41.0 (2.2), and 53.4 
(1.2) years in those starting antiretroviral therapy with CD4 count <100, 
100-199, and 200-350 cells/mm(3), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy in people treated for HIV infection has increased 
by over 15 years during 1996-2008, but is still about 13 years less than that of 
the UK population. The higher life expectancy in women is magnified in those 
with HIV. Earlier diagnosis and subsequent timely treatment with antiretroviral 
therapy might increase life expectancy.

I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II) is a rare metabolic disorder resulting from 
the deficiency of a specific lysosomal enzyme, 
N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferease. Developmental delay and growth 
failure are common presentations of I-cell disease. Psychomotor deterioration is 
rapid and progressive. Some physical signs, such as hip dislocations, inguinal 
hernia, hepatomegaly, joint limitation, and skin changes may be present at 
birth. Coarse facial features and skeletal abnormalities become more conspicuous 
with time. The life expectancy of children with this condition is poor, with 
death usually occurring around the fifth year. A case report of the anesthetic 
management of gingivectomy with multiple dental extractions in a 5 years old 
Omani female, with I-cell disease, is presented. The problems faced and their 
management during anesthesia are described.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of roflumilast/tiotropium therapy versus tiotropium 
monotherapy for treating severe-to-very severe COPD.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing 
roflumilast/tiotropium therapy vs tiotropium monotherapy in patients with 
severe-to-very severe COPD.
METHODS: The economic evaluation applied a disease-based Markov cohort model 
with five health states: (1) severe COPD, (2) severe COPD with a history of 
severe exacerbation, (3) very severe COPD, (4) very severe COPD with a history 
of severe exacerbation, and (5) death. Within a given health state, a patient 
may have a mild/moderate or severe exacerbation or die. Data from roflumilast 
clinical trials and published literature were used to populate model parameters. 
The model calculated health outcomes and costs for roflumilast/tiotropium 
therapy vs tiotropium monotherapy over a 5-year horizon. Incremental cost and 
benefits were then calculated as cost-effectiveness ratios, including cost per 
exacerbation avoided and cost per quality adjusted life year ($/QALY).
RESULTS: Over a 5-year horizon, the estimated incremental costs per exacerbation 
and per severe exacerbation avoided were $589 and $5869, respectively, and the 
incremental cost per QALY was $15,815. One-way sensitivity analyses varying key 
parameters produced an incremental cost per QALY ranging from $1963-$32,773.
LIMITATIONS: A number of key parameters used in the model were obtained from 
studies in the literature that were conducted under different contexts. 
Specifically, the relative risk estimate for severe COPD patients originates 
from a small trial not designed to demonstrate the impact of roflumilast on 
frequency of exacerbations. In addition, the model extrapolates the relative 
risk estimates over periods of 5-30 years, even though the estimates were only 
observed in trials that spanned less than a year.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of roflumilast to tiotropium is cost-effective for the 
treatment of severe to very severe COPD patients.

Cost-effectiveness of adding rh-endostatin to first-line chemotherapy in 
patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in China.

BACKGROUND: Adding rh-endostatin to standard platinum-based chemotherapy may 
significantly improve progression-free and overall survival in patients with 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the cost-effectiveness of this 
practice is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this cost-effectiveness analysis was to estimate the 
effects of adding rh-endostatin to standard chemotherapy in patients with 
advanced NSCLC on health and economic outcomes in China.
METHODS: A semi-Markov model was constructed to track 3-week patient transitions 
between 3 health states: progression-free survival, progressed survival, and 
death. Probabilities were derived mainly from the results of a pivotal Phase III 
trial assessing the addition of rh-endostatin to standard first-line 
chemotherapy with vinorelbine-cisplatin in patients with advanced NSCLC. Costs 
were estimated from the perspective of the Chinese health care system, and the 
analysis was run over a 10-year time horizon. The primary outcome was the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adding rh-endostatin at a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 3 × the per-capita gross domestic product 
(GDP) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: According to the model, treatment with rh-endostatin plus standard 
chemotherapy would increase overall survival by 0.63 years and 0.35 QALYs per 
patient compared with standard chemotherapy, at an additional cost of $8402.60. 
The ICER for adding rh-endostatin to chemotherapy was $24,454.25/QALY gained (at 
a 3% discounted rate). On 1-way sensitivity analysis, the utility value of 
progression-free survival was the most influential factor on the results, 
followed by the cost of rh-endostatin. On probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 
the probabilities of cost-effectiveness varied by region due to discrepant 
per-capita GDPs in China. Modeling to extrapolate clinical survival beyond trial 
completion was the main limitation.
CONCLUSION: The findings from the present analysis suggest that the addition of 
rh-endostatin to standard first-line chemotherapy is unlikely to be 
cost-effective. However, at a high WTP, rh-endostatin might be a cost-effective 
treatment option.

USA. Ovibes@ucsd.edu

BACKGROUND: Stroke is a major complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). In an 
era of chronic red cell transfusions for stroke prophylaxis in children and 
greater life expectancy, nationwide data on stroke rates among pediatric and 
adult patients with SCD are scarce. We evaluated recent time trends in stroke 
hospitalization among children (0-17 years) and adults (>17 years) with SCD in 
the United States.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Pediatric 
(n=26,380) and adult (n=9,638,507) patients admitted to hospitals between 1997 
and 2006 with a primary stroke discharge diagnosis (identified by the 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision procedure codes) were 
included. Time trends in the proportion of stroke patients with SCD were 
computed.
RESULTS: Pediatric stroke patients with co-morbid SCD constituted 8.7% in 1997 
vs. 4.8% in 2006 (p=0.04), with 81 fewer actual hospitalizations. Adult stroke 
patients with SCD were 0.3% in 1997 vs. 0.5% in 2006 (p=0.01), with 157 more 
actual hospitalizations. Factors that changed substantially and significantly 
across the decade among pediatric stroke patients with SCD included a drop in 
ischemic stroke type (74.2% vs. 56.3%) and a rise in comorbid hypertension (1.5% 
vs. 11.5%), while among adult stroke patients with SCD there was a rise in other 
stroke type (20.4% vs. 35.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: In an era of increasing prophylactic red cell transfusions, the 
proportion of SCD diagnoses among pediatric stroke patients significantly 
decreased in the United States. The rise in SCD diagnoses among adult stroke 
patients is possibly due to a cohort effect, but further study is needed.

Cost-effectiveness of a dual non-treponemal/treponemal syphilis point-of-care 
test to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa.

BACKGROUND: A dual nontreponemal/treponemal point-of-care test (Dual-POC) that 
simultaneously detects both nontreponemal and treponemal antibodies has been 
developed and evaluated. In this study, we compare the health and economic 
outcomes of the new test with existing syphilis tests/testing algorithms in a 
high prevalence setting.
METHODS: We used a cohort decision analysis model to examine 4 testing/screening 
algorithms; the Dual-POC test, the laboratory-based rapid plasma reagin and 
Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay (RPR+TPHA) algorithm, an onsite RPR 
testing, and point-of-care treponemal immunochromatographic strip (ICS) testing. 
Outcomes included miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital syphilis, low birth 
weight, and neonatal death. Disability-adjusted life-years were estimated for 
all health outcomes. The analytic horizon was the life expectancy for the mother 
and child.
RESULTS: For a cohort of 1000 pregnant women in a historically high syphilis 
prevalence population (10% infected and 15% previously infected), the model 
predicted a total of 39 adverse pregnancy outcomes if no serologic screening 
were performed; 13 for the laboratory-based RPR+TPHA; 11 for the on-site RPR 
strategy; 5 for the Dual-POC strategy; and 2 for the ICS strategy. On the basis 
of assumption that the cost of ICS and the Dual-POC tests were the same, the ICS 
strategy was the most cost saving (saved $30,000) followed by the Dual-POC 
strategy (saved $27,000).
CONCLUSIONS: The dual-POC test may help save cost in resource-poor settings 
where disease prevalence (and loss to follow-up) is high, while substantially 
reducing overtreatment.

BACKGROUND: Partner treatment is an important component of sexually transmitted 
disease control. Several randomized controlled trials have compared expedited 
partner treatment (EPT) to unassisted standard partner referral (SR). All of 
these trials found that EPT significantly increased partner treatment over SR, 
whereas some found that EPT significantly lowered reinfection rates in index 
patients.
METHODS: We collected cost data to assess the payer-specific, health care 
system, and societal-level cost of EPT and SR. We used data on partner treatment 
and index patient reinfection rates from 2 randomized controlled trials 
examining EPT and SR for patients diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea. 
Additional elements were estimated or drawn from the literature. We used a Monte 
Carlo simulation to assess the impact on cost and effectiveness of varying 
several variables simultaneously, and calculated threshold values for selected 
variables at which EPT and SR costs per patient were equal.
RESULTS: From a health care system or societal perspective, EPT was less costly 
and it treated more partners than SR. From the perspective of an individual 
payer, EPT was less costly than SR if ≥32% to 37% of male index patients' female 
partners or ≥29% of female index patients' male partners received care from the 
same payer.
CONCLUSIONS: EPT has a lower cost from a societal or health care system 
perspective than SR and treats more partners. Individual payers may find EPT to 
be more costly than SR, depending on how many of their patients' partners 
receive care from the same payer.

Systematic review and empirical comparison of contemporaneous EQ-5D and SF-6D 
group mean scores.

BACKGROUND: Group mean estimates and their underlying distributions are the 
focus of assessment for cost and outcome variables in economic evaluation. 
Research focusing on the comparability of alternative preference-based measures 
of health-related quality of life has typically focused on analysis of 
individual-level data within specific clinical specialties or community-based 
samples.
PURPOSE: To explore the relationship between group mean scores for the EQ-5D and 
SF-6D across the utility scoring range.
METHODS: Studies were identified via a systematic search of 13 online electronic 
databases, a review of reference lists of included papers, and hand searches of 
key journals. Studies were included if they reported contemporaneous mean EQ-5D 
and SF-6D health state scores. All (sub)group comparisons of group mean EQ-5D 
and SF-6D scores identifiable from text, tables, or figures were extracted from 
identified studies. A total of 921 group mean comparisons were extracted from 56 
studies. The nature of the relationship between the paired scores was examined 
using ranked scatter graphs and analysis of agreement.
RESULTS: Systematic differences in group mean estimates were observed at both 
ends of the utility scale. At the lower (upper) end of the scale, the SF-6D 
(EQ-5D) provides higher mean utility estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that group mean EQ-5D and SF-6D scores are not 
directly comparable. This raises serious concerns about the cross-study 
comparability of economic evaluations that differ in the choice of 
preference-based measures, although the review focuses on 2 of the available 
instruments only. Further work is needed to address the practical implications 
of noninterchangeable utility estimates for cost-per-QALY estimates and decision 
making.

Can case study approaches speed implementation of the NRC report: "toxicity 
testing in the 21st century: a vision and a strategy?".

The 2007 report "Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy" 
argued for a change in toxicity testing for environmental agents and discussed 
federal funding mechanisms that could be used to support this transformation 
within the USA. The new approach would test for in vitro perturbations of 
toxicity pathways using human cells with high-throughput testing platforms. The 
NRC report proposed a deliberate timeline, spanning about 20 years, to implement 
a wholesale replacement of current in-life toxicity test approaches focused on 
apical responses with in vitro assays. One approach to accelerating 
implementation is to focus on well-studied prototype compounds with known 
toxicity pathway targets. Through a series of carefully executed case studies 
with four or five pathway prototypes, the various steps required for 
implementation of an in vitro toxicity pathway approach to risk assessment could 
be developed and refined. In this article, we discuss alternative approaches for 
implementation and also outline advantages of a case study approach and the 
manner in which the case studies could be pursued using current methodologies. A 
case study approach would be complementary to recently proposed efforts to map 
the human toxome, while representing a significant extension toward more formal 
risk assessment compared to the profiling and prioritization approaches inherent 
in programs such as the EPA's ToxCast effort.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct an economic analysis (EA) of coronary calcium scoring 
(CCS) using a 0 score, as alternative to stress electrocardiography (sECG) in 
diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHOD: A decision tree was constructed to compare four strategies for 
investigation of suspected CAD previously assessed in the formulation of 
clinical guidelines for the United Kingdom (UK) to two new strategies 
incorporating CCS. Sensitivity (96%; 95% CI 95.4-96.4%) and specificity (40%; 
95% CI 38.7-41.4%) values for CCS were derived from a meta-analysis of 10,760 
patients. Other input variables were obtained from a previous EA and average 
prices for hospital procedures in the UK. A threshold of 
£30,000/Quality-adjusted Life Year (QALY) was considered cost-effective.
RESULTS: Using net monetary benefit calculations, CCS-based strategies were 
found to be cost-effective compared to sECG equivalents at all assessed 
prevalence of CAD. Using CCS prior to myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS)
