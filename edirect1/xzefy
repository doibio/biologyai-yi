Postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis who have a recent fracture are at very 
high risk of fracture, and this study finds that stratified treatment based on 
fracture risk would be a cost-effective treatment option for this population.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of four anti-osteoporosis 
medications (denosumab, zoledronate, teriparatide, and alendronate) for 
postmenopausal osteoporotic women in mainland China, using a stratified 
treatment strategy recommended by the American Association of Clinical 
Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE).
METHODS: A microsimulation Markov model was used to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of the four treatments in postmenopausal osteoporotic 
patients of different ages (65, 70, 75, and 80 years), with a recent fracture 
from the Chinese healthcare perspective. The primary outcome was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which represent the incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) obtained. One-way deterministic sensitivity 
analysis (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were performed to 
assess the robustness of model findings.
RESULTS: Alendronate was dominated by denosumab-to-alendronate and zoledronate 
at all ages examined, indicating that the costs of the two drugs were lower, but 
QALYs was greater. However, teriparatide-to-alendronate yielded an ICER of 
$76,432.07/ QALY, compared with alendronate at age 65, which exceeded the 
pre-determined willingness-to-pay threshold of $37,653/ QALY. The results were 
similar at other ages. The DSA showed that the most sensitive parameters were 
drug efficacy for vertebral and wrist fractures, the relative risk of vertebral 
fractures, and the persistence of the drugs. The PSA showed that zoledronate had 
a 100% probability of being the most cost-effective treatment, with a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $37,653/ QALY.
CONCLUSION: Stratified treatment based on very high fracture risk is more 
cost-effective than conventional pills in mainland China. Among the stratified 
treatments, zoledronate is the optimal option.

BACKGROUND: Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) is a dreadful disease escaping 
the classical genetic model of cancer evolution and characterized by wide 
heterogeneity and transcriptional plasticity. Clinical evolution of MPM is 
marked by a progressive transdifferentiation that converts well differentiated 
epithelioid (E) cells into undifferentiated and pleomorphic sarcomatoid (S) 
phenotypes. Catching the way this transition takes place is necessary to 
understand how MPM develops and progresses and it is mandatory to improve 
patients' management and life expectancy. Bulk transcriptomic approaches, while 
providing a significant overview, failed to resolve the timing of this evolution 
and to identify the hierarchy of molecular events through which this transition 
takes place.
METHODS: We applied a spatially resolved, high-dimensional transcriptomic 
approach to study MPM morphological evolution. 139 regions across 8 biphasic 
MPMs (B-MPMs) were profiled using the GeoMx™Digital Spatial Profiler to 
reconstruct the positional context of transcriptional activities and the spatial 
topology of MPM cells interactions. Validation was conducted on an independent 
large cohort of 84 MPMs by targeted digital barcoding analysis.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrated the existence of a complex circular ecosystem 
in which, within a strong asbestos-driven inflammatory environment, MPM and 
immune cells affect each other to support S-transdifferentiation. We also showed 
that TGFB1 polarized M2-Tumor Associated Macrophages foster immune evasion and 
that TGFB1 expression correlates with reduced survival probability.
CONCLUSIONS: Besides providing crucial insights into the multidimensional 
interactions governing MPM clinical evolution, these results open new 
perspectives to improve the use of immunotherapy in this disease.

BACKGROUND: Globally, silicosis accounts for 90% of all pneumoconiosis cases and 
is a serious public health issue. It is characterized by progressive 
inflammation and irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. A comprehensive analysis at 
temporal, spatial and population levels with the most updated data from GBD 2019 
is provided in this study to estimate the disease burden of silicosis from 1990 
to 2019 and make predictions to 2029.
METHODS: We delineated silicosis data on incidence, prevalence, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as well as age-standardized rates (ASRs) 
across 30 years from GBD 2019. Joinpoint regression analysis was employed to 
detect temporal changes and estimate annual percentage change (APC) of each 
trend segment. Measures were stratified by time, location, age, and 
sociodemographic index (SDI). Back propagation artificial neural network 
(BP-ANN) model was applied to elaborate ASR trends from 1990 to 2019 and 
projections to the next 10 years.
RESULTS: Globally, silicosis incident, prevalent cases, and DALYs increased by 
64.6%, 91.4%, and 20.8%, respectively. However, all the corresponding ASRs 
showed overall downward trends with an estimated average APC (AAPC) of -0.5(-0.7 
to -0.3), -0.2(-0.5 to 0.0), and - 2.0(-2.2 to -1.8), respectively. Middle and 
high-middle SDI regions carried the heaviest disease burden. The highest disease 
burden of silicosis was mainly transferred to the older from 1990 to 2019. The 
trend of ASRs demonstrated a rapid decline between 2005 and 2019, followed by a 
continuous decline until 2029.
CONCLUSION: Though disease burden of silicosis has been on a decline in general 
from 1990 to 2019, which shows a promising prospect but cannot be ignored. We 
should pay more attention to implementing preventive tactics and improving the 
life quality of present sufferers.

BACKGROUND: The Central Government of India introduced the National Health 
Mission (NHM) in 2005 to improve health outcomes by enhancing publicly financed 
(government) health expenditure and health infrastructure at the state level. 
This study aims to examine the effects of the state-level heterogeneity in 
publicly financed spending on health services on major health outcomes such as 
life expectancy, infant mortality rate, child mortality rate, the incidence of 
malaria, and immunization coverage (i.e., BCG, Polio, Measles, and Tetanus).
METHODS: This study investigates the relationships between publicly financed 
health expenditure and health outcomes by controlling income and infrastructure 
levels across 28 Indian States from 2005 to 2016. Along with all states, the 
empirical analysis has also been carried out for high-focus and non-high-focus 
states as per the NHM fund flow criteria. It has applied panel fixed-effects and 
random effects model wherever required based on the Hausman test.
RESULTS: The empirical results show that publicly financed health expenditure 
reduces infant mortality, child mortality, and malaria cases. At the same time, 
it improves life expectancy and immunization coverage in India. It also finds 
that the relationship between publicly financed health expenditure and health 
outcomes is weak, especially in the high-focus states.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the healthcare need for achieving desirable health outcomes, 
Indian States should enhance publicly financed expenditure on health services. 
This study augments essential guidance for implementing public health policies 
in developing countries.

BACKGROUND: Liver cirrhosis is one of the leading causes of decreased life 
expectancy worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying liver 
cirrhosis remain unclear. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis 
using transcriptome and metabolome sequencing to explore the genes, pathways, 
and interactions associated with liver cirrhosis.
METHODS: We performed transcriptome and metabolome sequencing of blood samples 
from patients with cirrhosis and healthy controls (1:1 matched for sex and age). 
We validated the differentially expressed microRNA (miRNA) and mRNAs using 
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: For transcriptome analysis, we screened for differentially expressed 
miRNAs and mRNAs, analyzed mRNAs to identify possible core genes and pathways, 
and performed co-analysis of miRNA and mRNA sequencing results. In terms of the 
metabolome, we screened five pathways that were substantially enriched in the 
differential metabolites. Next, we identified the metabolites with the most 
pronounced differences among these five metabolic pathways. We performed 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of these five metabolites 
to determine their diagnostic efficacy for cirrhosis. Finally, we explored 
possible links between the transcriptome and metabolome.
CONCLUSION: Based on sequencing and bioinformatics, we identified miRNAs and 
genes that were differentially expressed in the blood of patients with liver 
cirrhosis. By exploring pathways and disease-specific networks, we identified 
unique biological mechanisms. In terms of metabolomes, we identified novel 
biomarkers and explored their diagnostic efficacy. We identified possible common 
pathways in the transcriptome and metabolome that could serve as candidates for 
further studies.

Double and triple thermodynamic mutant cycles reveal the basis for specific 
MsbA-lipid interactions.

Lyu J, Zhang T, Marty MT, Clemmer D, Russell DH, Laganowsky A.

Structural and functional studies of the ATP-binding cassette transporter MsbA 
have revealed two distinct lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding sites: one located 
in the central cavity and the other at a membrane-facing, exterior site. 
Although these binding sites are known to be important for MsbA function, the 
thermodynamic basis for these specific MsbA-LPS interactions is not well 
understood. Here, we use native mass spectrometry to determine the 
thermodynamics of MsbA interacting with the LPS-precursor 3-deoxy-D- manno 
-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) 2 -lipid A (KDL). The binding of KDL is solely driven 
by entropy, despite the transporter adopting an inward-facing conformation or 
trapped in an outward-facing conformation with adenosine 5'-diphosphate and 
vanadate. An extension of the mutant cycle approach is employed to probe basic 
residues that interact with KDL. We find the molecular recognition of KDL is 
driven by a positive coupling entropy (as large as -100 kJ/mol at 298K) that 
outweighs unfavorable coupling enthalpy. These findings indicate that 
alterations in solvent reorganization and conformational entropy can contribute 
significantly to the free energy of protein-lipid association. The results 
presented herein showcase the advantage of native MS to obtain thermodynamic 
insight into protein-lipid interactions that would otherwise be intractable 
using traditional approaches, and this enabling technology will be instrumental 
in the life sciences and drug discovery.

The integrity of the high cervical spine, the transition zone from the brainstem 
to the spinal cord, is crucial for survival and daily life. The region protects 
the enclosed neurovascular structure and allows a substantial portion of the 
head motion. Injuries of the high cervical spine are frequent, and the fractures 
of the C2 vertebra account for approximately 17-25% of acute cervical fractures. 
We review the two major types of C2 vertebral fractures, odontoid fracture and 
Hangman's fracture. For both types of fractures, favorable outcomes could be 
obtained if the delicately selected conservative treatment is performed. In 
odontoid fractures, as the most common fracture on the C2 vertebrae, anterior 
screw fixation is considered first for type II fractures, and C1-2 fusion is 
suggested when nonunion is a concern or occurs. Hangman's fractures are the 
second most common fracture. Many stable extension type I and II fractures can 
be treated with external immobilization, whereas the predominant flexion type 
IIA and III fractures require surgical stabilization. No result proves that 
either anterior or posterior surgery is superior, and the surgeon should decide 
on the surgical method after careful consideration according to each clinical 
situation. This review will briefly describe the basic principles and current 
treatment concepts of C2 fractures.

Stretching or compressing hydrogels creates anisotropic environments that lead 
to motionally averaged alignment of embedded guest quadrupolar nuclear spins 
such as 23Na+. These distorted hydrogels can elicit a residual quadrupolar 
coupling that gives an oscillation in the trajectories of single quantum 
coherences (SQCs) as a function of the evolution time during a spin-echo 
experiment. We present solutions to equations of motion derived with a 
Liouvillian superoperator approach, which encompass the coherent quadrupolar 
interaction in conjunction with relaxation, to give a full analytical 
description of the evolution trajectories of rank-1 (T^1±1), rank-2 (T^2±1), and 
rank-3 (T^3±1) SQCs. We performed simultaneous numerical fitting of the 
experimental 23Na nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and rank-2 (T^2±1) 
and rank-3 (T^3±1) SQC evolution trajectories measured in double and triple 
quantum filtered experiments, respectively. We estimated values of the 
quadrupolar coupling constant CQ, rotational correlation time τC, and 3 × 3 
Saupe order matrix. We performed simultaneous fitting of the analytical 
expressions to the experimental data to estimate values of the quadrupolar 
coupling frequency ωQ/2π, residual quadrupolar coupling ωQ/2π, and corresponding 
spherical order parameter S0*, which showed a linear dependence on the extent of 
uniform hydrogel stretching and compression. The analytical expressions were 
completely concordant with the numerical approach. The insights gained here can 
be extended to more complicated (biological) systems such as 23Na+ bound to 
proteins or located inside and outside living cells in high-field NMR 
experiments and, by extension, to the anisotropic environments found in vivo 
with 23Na magnetic resonance imaging.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic disorder 
predominantly affecting the lungs and pancreas. Airway clearance techniques 
(ACTs) and exercise therapy are key components of physiotherapy, which is 
considered integral in managing CF; however, low adherence is well-documented. 
Poor physiotherapy adherence may lead to repeated respiratory infections, 
reduced exercise tolerance, breathlessness, reduced quality of life, malaise and 
reduced life expectancy, as well as increased use of pharmacology, healthcare 
access and hospital admission. Therefore, evidence-based strategies to inform 
clinical practice and improve adherence to physiotherapy may improve quality of 
life and reduce treatment burden.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions to enhance adherence to 
airway clearance treatment and exercise therapy in people with CF and their 
effects on health outcomes, such as pulmonary exacerbations, exercise capacity 
and health-related quality of life.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, 
compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and 
conference abstract books. Date of last search: 1 March 2023. We also searched 
online trials registries and the reference lists of relevant articles and 
reviews. Date of last search: 28 March 2023.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 
quasi-RCTs of parallel design assessing any intervention aimed at enhancing 
adherence to physiotherapy in people with CF versus no intervention, another 
intervention or usual care.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently checked search 
results for eligible studies and independently extracted data. We used standard 
procedures recommended by Cochrane and assessed the certainty of evidence using 
the GRADE system.
MAIN RESULTS: Two RCTs (77 participants with CF; age range 2 to 20 years; 44 
(57%) males) met the inclusion criteria of this review. One study employed an 
intervention to improve adherence to exercise and the second an intervention to 
improve adherence to ACT. Both studies measured outcomes at baseline and at 
three months, but neither study formally assessed our primary outcome of 
adherence in terms of our planned outcome measures, and results were dependent 
on self-reported data. Adherence to ACTs One RCT (43 participants) assessed 
using specifically-composed music alongside ACTs compared to self-selected or no 
music (usual care). The ACT process consisted of nebuliser inhalation treatment, 
ACTs and relaxation or antibiotic nebuliser treatment. We graded all evidence as 
very low certainty. This study reported adherence to ACTs using the 
Morisky-Green questionnaire and also participants' perception of treatment time 
and enjoyment, which may influence adherence (outcome not reported specifically 
in this review). We are uncertain whether participants who received 
specifically-composed music may be more likely to adhere at six and 12 weeks 
compared to those who received usual care, risk ratio (RR) 1.75 (95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.07 to 2.86) and RR 1.56 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.40) respectively. 
There may not be any difference in adherence when comparing 
specifically-composed music to self-selected music at six weeks, RR 1.21 (95% CI 
0.87 to 1.68) or 12 weeks, RR 1.52 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.38); or self-selected music 
to usual care at six weeks, RR 1.44 (95% CI 0.82 to 2.52) or 12 weeks, RR 1.03 
(95% CI 0.57 to 1.86). The music study also reported the number of respiratory 
infections requiring hospitalisation at 12 weeks, with no difference seen in the 
risk of hospitalisation between all groups. Adherence to exercise One RCT (24 
participants) compared the provision of a manual of aerobic exercises, 
recommended exercise prescription plus two-weekly follow-up phone calls to 
reinforce exercise practice over a period of three months to verbal instructions 
for aerobic exercise according to the CF centre's protocol. We graded all 
evidence as very low certainty. We are uncertain whether an educational 
intervention leads to more participants in the intervention group undertaking 
increased regular physical activity at three months (self-report), RR 3.67 (95% 
CI 1.24 to 10.85), and there was no reported difference between groups in the 
number undertaking physical activity three times per week or undertaking at 
least 40 minutes of physical activity. No effect was seen on secondary outcome 
measures of spirometry, exercise capacity or any CF quality of life domains. 
This study did not report on the frequency of respiratory infections 
(hospitalised or not) or adverse events.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain whether a music-based motivational 
intervention may increase adherence to ACTs or affect the risk of 
hospitalisation for a respiratory infection. We are also uncertain whether an 
educational intervention increases adherence to exercise or reduces the 
frequency of respiratory infection-related hospital admission. However, these 
results are largely based on self-reported data and the impact of strategies to 
improve adherence to ACT and exercise in children and adolescents with stable CF 
remains inconclusive. Given that adherence to ACT and exercise therapy are 
fundamental to the clinical management of people with CF, there is an urgent 
need for well-designed, large-scale clinical trials in this area, which should 
conform to the CONSORT statement for standards of reporting and use appropriate, 
validated outcome measures. Studies should also ensure full disclosure of data 
for all important clinical outcomes.

Cilia build distinct subdomains with variable axonemal structures to perform 
diverse functions in cell motility and signaling. In sensory cilia across 
species, an axoneme differentiates longitudinally into a middle segment with 
nine microtubule (MT) doublets and a distal segment with nine MT singlets that 
extends from the A tubules of the doublets. Here, we study axoneme 
differentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans by analyzing the flagellar inner 
junction protein FAP20 and PCRG1 that connect A and B tubules in Chlamydomonas. 
The nematode CFAP-20 is restricted to the middle segment with doublets, and its 
loss disconnects A and B tubules. However, PCRG-1 is absent from most sensory 
cilia, and its deletion does not disrupt cilia. Ectopic introduction of PCRG-1 
into cilia generated abnormal MT doublets in the distal segment and reduced 
intraflagellar transport and animal sensation. Thus, the absence of an inner 
junction protein prevents B-tubule extension, which contributes to axoneme 
differentiation and ciliary function.

Helicobacter pylori strains that deliver the oncoprotein CagA into gastric 
epithelial cells are the major etiologic agents of upper gastric diseases 
including gastric cancer. CagA promotes gastric carcinogenesis through 
interactions with multiple host proteins. Here, we show that CagA also disrupts 
Wnt-dependent planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP), which orients cells within the 
plane of an epithelium and coordinates collective cell behaviors such as 
convergent extension to enable epithelial elongation during development. Ectopic 
expression of CagA in Xenopus laevis embryos impaired gastrulation, neural tube 
formation, and axis elongation, processes driven by convergent extension 
movements that depend on the Wnt/PCP pathway. Mice specifically expressing CagA 
in the stomach epithelium had longer pyloric glands and mislocalization of the 
tetraspanin proteins VANGL1 and VANGL2 (VANGL1/2), which are critical components 
of Wnt/PCP signaling. The increased pyloric gland length was due to 
hyperproliferation of cells at the gland base, where Lgr5+ stem and progenitor 
cells reside, and was associated with fewer differentiated enteroendocrine 
cells. In cultured human gastric epithelial cells, the N terminus of CagA 
interacted with the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of VANGL1/2, which impaired 
Wnt/PCP signaling by inducing the mislocalization of VANGL1/2 from the plasma 
membrane to the cytoplasm. Thus, CagA may contribute to the development of 
gastric cancer by subverting a Wnt/PCP-dependent mechanism that restrains 
pyloric gland stem cell proliferation and promotes enteroendocrine 
differentiation.

INTRODUCTION: Continually rising life expectancy and a shift towards an ageing 
population are resulting in an increasing population of nonagenarians. By 2030, 
the global population of nonagenarians is expected to exceed 30 million. The 
incidence of symptomatic cardiac disease is reported to occur in 25% of those 
aged over 75 years. Therefore, the number of nonagenarians undergoing cardiac 
surgery is also expected to increase. A linear relationship between advanced age 
and surgical risk has previously been demonstrated; however, it is not yet known 
whether this knowledge extends to the perioperative course and mortality of 
nonagenarians undergoing cardiac surgery. This scoping review aims to review the 
literature, assess whether a deficiency exists in the published literature and 
potentially identify knowledge gaps to guide future efforts to improve the 
understanding of nonagenarians undergoing cardiac surgery.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Following the relevant aspects of the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Review 
guidelines, electronic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library 
will be systematically searched, with additional reference tracking of eligible 
studies. Studies reporting the outcomes of nonagenarians undergoing open cardiac 
surgery or minimally invasive cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass 
will be included. Screening and data extraction will be performed by two 
reviewers independently. The data will be analysed and summarised descriptively 
with a narrative approach. Qualitative data that capture quality-of-life 
outcomes will be subjected to thematic analysis where feasible. Additionally, 
reporting results will highlight similarities and differences in nonagenarian 
selection for surgery.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was not required. The findings will be 
disseminated through professional networks, conference presentations and 
publications in scientific journals.

BACKGROUND: On average, educated people are healthier, wealthier and have higher 
life expectancy than those with less education. Numerous studies have attempted 
to determine whether education causes differences in later health outcomes or 
whether another factor ultimately causes differences in education and subsequent 
outcomes. Previous studies have used a range of natural experiments to provide 
causal evidence. Here we compare two natural experiments: a policy reform, 
raising the school leaving age in the UK in 1972; and Mendelian randomization.
METHODS: We used data from 334 974 participants of the UK Biobank, sampled 
between 2006 and 2010. We estimated the effect of an additional year of 
education on 25 outcomes, including mortality, measures of morbidity and health, 
ageing and income, using multivariable adjustment, the policy reform and 
Mendelian randomization. We used a range of sensitivity analyses and 
specification tests to assess the plausibility of each method's assumptions.
RESULTS: The three different estimates of the effects of educational attainment 
were largely consistent in direction for diabetes, stroke and heart attack, 
mortality, smoking, income, grip strength, height, body mass index (BMI), 
intelligence, alcohol consumption and sedentary behaviour. However, there was 
evidence that education reduced rates of moderate exercise and increased alcohol 
consumption. Our sensitivity analyses suggest that confounding by genotypic or 
phenotypic confounders or specific forms of pleiotropy are unlikely to explain 
our results.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have suggested that the differences in outcomes 
associated with education may be due to confounding. However, the two 
independent sources of exogenous variation we exploit largely imply consistent 
causal effects of education on outcomes later in life.

A comprehensive characterization of blood proteome profiles in cancer patients 
can contribute to a better understanding of the disease etiology, resulting in 
earlier diagnosis, risk stratification and better monitoring of the different 
cancer subtypes. Here, we describe the use of next generation protein profiling 
to explore the proteome signature in blood across patients representing many of 
the major cancer types. Plasma profiles of 1463 proteins from more than 1400 
cancer patients are measured in minute amounts of blood collected at the time of 
diagnosis and before treatment. An open access Disease Blood Atlas resource 
allows the exploration of the individual protein profiles in blood collected 
from the individual cancer patients. We also present studies in which 
classification models based on machine learning have been used for the 
identification of a set of proteins associated with each of the analyzed 
cancers. The implication for cancer precision medicine of next generation plasma 
profiling is discussed.

Growing life expectancy poses important societal challenges, placing an 
increasing burden on ever more strained health systems. Digital technologies 
offer tremendous potential for shifting from traditional medical routines to 
remote medicine and transforming our ability to manage health and independence 
in aging populations. In this Perspective, we summarize the current progress 
toward, and challenges and future opportunities of, harnessing digital 
technologies for effective geriatric care. Special attention is given to the 
role of wearables in assisting older adults to monitor their health and maintain 
independence at home. Challenges to the widespread future use of digital 
technologies in this population will be discussed, along with a vision for how 
such technologies will shape the future of healthy aging.

Asthma, a common airway disease, results in a significant burden to both 
patients and society worldwide. Yet, despite global political commitment backed 
by the United Nations, progress to reduce the burden of asthma remains 
inadequate. This is particularly true in low-income countries. To date, progress 
has been delayed by the lack of uniform data collection, imperfect surveillance 
methods, inadequate resources, poor access to effective therapies, substandard 
asthma education, ineffective governmental policies, rapid urbanization, 
progressive increase in asthma prevalence, increased life expectancy and obesity 
rates worldwide, asthma heterogeneity and disease complexity, smoking, and 
environmental exposures to allergens and pollution. A thorough understanding of 
the challenges facing the international community is essential to define future 
strategies to improve the burden of asthma.

BACKGROUND: Within long-term care, a culture change (e.g. focus on increasing 
autonomy in everyday life) is leading to the development of innovative living 
arrangements for older adults. Insight into characteristics of innovative living 
arrangements, which are described as an alternative to regular nursing homes, is 
lacking. This review aims to provide an overview of innovative living 
arrangements and to describe their defining characteristics.
METHODS: A scoping review was performed following the framework of Arksey and 
O'Malley. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
with extension, for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was also followed. The 
databases PubMed, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched. Articles, 
published between 2012 and 2023 were included when they presented an innovative 
living arrangement as an alternative to regular nursing homes. A thematic 
analysis was performed, describing the physical, social, and organizational 
environment of the innovative living arrangements.
RESULTS: Fifty-six articles were identified describing seven types of distinct 
innovative living arrangements: small-scale living, the green house model, 
shared housing arrangements, green care farms, dementia villages, group homes, 
intergenerational living, and an 'other' category. The themes included 
supporting autonomy and creating a small-scale and/or homelike environment, 
which were emphasized in most innovative living arrangements. Other themes, such 
as involvement of the community, focus on nature, integration of work tasks, and 
involvement of family members, were emphasized in a subsection of the described 
living arrangements. Twenty-eight articles reported on the effects of the 
innovative living environment on residents, family members, or staff members. 
Most articles (N = 22) studied resident-related outcomes, focusing mainly on 
quality of life and aspects of daily life.
CONCLUSION: More insight into the mechanisms of the social and organizational 
environments is needed, which may lead to greater transparency and homogeneity 
regarding the description of living arrangements. This review shows that more 
knowledge is needed about the potential key elements of innovative living 
arrangements, especially related to their social and organizational environment. 
This may provide a better guide for developers within long-term care.

OBJECTIVES: Higher levels of happiness are associated with longer life 
expectancy. Our study assessed the extent to which various factors explain the 
protective effect of happiness on all-cause mortality risk, and whether the 
association differs between older men and women.
METHODS: Using data from the Singapore Longitudinal Aging Studies (N = 6073) of 
community-dwelling older adults aged ≥ 55 years, we analyzed the association of 
baseline Likert score of happiness (1 = very sad to 5 = very happy) and 
mortality from mean 11.7 years of follow up. Cox regression models were used to 
assess the extent to which confounding risk factors attenuated the hazard ratio 
of association in the whole sample and sex-stratified analyses.
RESULTS: Happiness was significantly associated with lower mortality (p < .001) 
adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity: HR = 0.85 per integer score and HR = 0.57 
for fairly-or-very happy versus fairly-or-very sad. The HR estimate (0.90 per 
integer score) was modestly attenuated (33.3%) in models that included 
socio-demographic and support, lifestyle or physical health and functioning 
factor, but remained statistically significant. The HR estimate (0.94 per 
integer score) was substantially attenuated (60%) and was insignificant in the 
model that included psychological health and functioning. Including all 
co-varying factors in the model resulted in statistically insignificant HR 
estimate (1.04 per integer score). Similar results were obtained for HR 
estimates for fairly-to-very happy versus fairly-to- very sad).
DISCUSSION: Much of the association between happiness and increased life 
expectancy could be explained by socio-demographic, lifestyle, health and 
functioning factors, and especially psychological health and functioning 
factors.

BACKGROUND: In Malaysia, the previous mortality burden has been a significant 
concern, particularly due to the high prevalence of noncommunicable diseases 
(NCDs) as the leading cause of death. Estimates of mortality are key indicators 
for monitoring population health and determining priorities in health policies 
and health planning. The aim of this study was to estimate the disease burden 
attributed to 113 major diseases and injuries in Malaysia in 2018 using years of 
life lost (YLL) method.
METHODS: This study included all deaths that occurred in Malaysia in 2018. The 
YLL was derived by adding the number of deaths from 113 specific diseases and 
multiplying it by the remaining life expectancy for that age and sex group. Data 
on life expectancy and mortality were collected from the Department of 
Statistics Malaysia.
RESULTS: In 2018, there were 3.5 million YLL in Malaysia. Group II (NCDs) caused 
72.2% of total YLL. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of premature 
mortality among Malaysians (17.7%), followed by lower respiratory infections 
(9.7%), road traffic injuries (8.7%), cerebrovascular disease (stroke) (8.0%), 
and diabetes mellitus (3.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: NCDs are a significant health concern in Malaysia and are the 
primary contributor to the overall burden of disease. These results are 
important in guiding the national health systems on how to design and implement 
effective interventions for NCDs, as well as how to prioritise and allocate 
healthcare resources. Key strategies to consider include implementing health 
promotion campaigns, adopting integrated care models, and implementing policy 
and regulatory measures. These approaches aim to enhance health outcomes and the 
managements of NCDs in Malaysia.
