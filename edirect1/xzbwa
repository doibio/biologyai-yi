threshold was cost-effective; however, this result was very uncertain partly 
owing to the negligible difference in quality-adjusted life-years gained.
CONCLUSIONS: A restrictive transfusion threshold is not superior to a liberal 
threshold after cardiac surgery. This finding supports restrictive transfusion 
due to reduced consumption and costs of red blood cells. However, secondary 
findings create uncertainty about recommending restrictive transfusion and 
prompt a new hypothesis that liberal transfusion may be superior after cardiac 
surgery. Reanalyses of existing trial datasets, excluding all participants who 
did not breach the liberal threshold, followed by a meta-analysis of the 
reanalysed results are the most obvious research steps to address the new 
hypothesis about the possible harm of red blood cell transfusion.

Management of persistent lower urinary tract dysfunction resulting from severe 
thoracolumbar spinal cord injury can be challenging. Severe suprasacral spinal 
cord injury releases the spinal cord segmental micturition reflex from 
supraspinal modulation and increases nerve growth factor concentration in the 
bladder wall, lumbosacral spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglion, which 
subsequently activates hypermechanosensitive C-fiber bladder wall afferents. 
Hyperexcitability of bladder afferents and detrusor overactivity can cause urine 
leaking during the storage phase. During urine voiding, the loss of supraspinal 
control that normally coordinates detrusor contraction with sphincter relaxation 
can lead to spinal cord segmental reflex-mediated simultaneous detrusor and 
sphincter contractions or detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, resulting in 
inefficient urine voiding and high residual volume. These disease-associated 
changes can impact on the quality of life and life expectancy of spinal-injured 
animals. Here, we discuss the pathophysiology and management considerations of 
lower urinary tract dysfunction as the result of severe, acute, suprasacral 
spinal cord injury. In addition, drawing from experimental, preclinical, and 
clinical medicine, we introduce some treatment options for neurogenic lower 
urinary tract dysfunction that are designed to: (1) prevent urine leakage 
arising because of detrusor overactivity during bladder filling, (2) preserve 
upper urinary tract integrity and function by reducing intravesical pressure and 
subsequent vesicoureteral reflux, and (3) prevent urinary tract and systemic 
complications by treating and preventing urinary tract infections.

Unmet oral care needs are high among people living with human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV)/AIDS (PLWH). Oral health care is of increasing importance as life 
expectancy is being prolonged extensively among PLWH. The benefit of oral health 
care in relation to time since HIV diagnosis has not previously been assessed. A 
retrospective multivariable analysis of the Special Project of National 
Significance Oral Health Initiative observational cohort study ( N = 2,178) was 
performed to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of oral health outcomes comparing 
historically diagnosed subjects (>1 y since HIV diagnosis) to newly diagnosed 
subjects (≤1 y since HIV diagnosis). ORs were adjusted for age, study site, 
language, income, last dental care visit, and dental insurance. Historically 
diagnosed subjects were more likely to report oral problems than newly 
HIV-diagnosed subjects (OR, 2.10). Historically diagnosed subjects were more 
likely to require oral surgery (OR, 1.52), restorative treatment (OR, 1.35), 
endodontic treatment (OR, 1.63), and more than 10 oral clinic visits over the 
24-mo study period (OR, 2.02). The crude cumulative 2-y risk of requiring 
prosthetic (risk difference [RD], 0.21) and endodontic (RD, 0.11) treatment was 
higher among historically than newly diagnosed subjects, despite no significance 
postadjustment. Furthermore, poor oral health outcomes were exacerbated among 
non-highly active antiretroviral therapy users. Summarizing, the authors found 
that historically diagnosed subjects were more likely to report oral problems 
and require dental procedures compared with newly diagnosed subjects, suggesting 
that oral health among PLWH declines over time since HIV diagnosis. Hence, newly 
diagnosed PLWH may benefit from the implementation of early oral interventions.

BACKGROUND: Second-generation drug eluting stents (DES) may reduce costs and 
improve clinical outcomes compared to first-generation DES with improved 
cost-effectiveness when compared to bare metal stents (BMS). We aimed to conduct 
an economic evaluation of a cobalt-chromium everolimus eluting stent (Co-Cr EES) 
compared with BMS in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of a cobalt-chromium 
everolimus eluting stent (Co-Cr EES) versus BMS in PCI.
METHODS: A Markov state transition model with a 2-year time horizon was applied 
from a US Medicare setting with patients undergoing PCI with Co-Cr EES or BMS. 
Baseline characteristics, treatment effects, and safety measures were taken from 
a patient level meta-analysis of 5 RCTs (n = 4,896). The base-case analysis 
evaluated stent-related outcomes; a secondary analysis considered the broader 
set of outcomes reported in the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The base-case and secondary analyses reported an additional 0.018 and 
0.013 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost savings of $236 and $288, 
respectively with Co-Cr EES versus BMS. Results were robust to sensitivity 
analyses and were most sensitive to the price of clopidogrel. In the 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Co-Cr EES was associated with a greater than 
99% chance of being cost saving or cost effective (at a cost per QALY threshold 
of $50,000) versus BMS.
CONCLUSIONS: Using data from a recent patient level meta-analysis and 
contemporary cost data, this analysis found that PCI with Co-Cr EES is more 
effective and less costly than PCI with BMS. © 2016 The Authors. Catheterization

OBJECTIVE: To determine how the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program 
(EFNEP) affects the quality of life (QoL) of its exemplary paraprofessional 
educators.
METHODS: Qualitative telephone interviews with EFNEP supervisors (15), educators 
(28), and agency partners (15). Template analysis based on the University of 
Toronto's QoL constructs.
RESULTS: The EFNEP had a positive impact on 6 of 9 a priori categories: physical 
being, psychological being, social belonging, community belonging, practical 
becoming, and growth becoming.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The EFNEP enhances the QoL of its exemplary 
educators, which suggests that the program's benefits go beyond those documented 
in participants.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy, growth of minority populations, and 
advances in cancer screening and treatment have resulted in an increasing number 
of older, racially diverse cancer survivors. Potential black/white disparities 
in cancer incidence, stage, and survival among the oldest old (≥85 years) were 
examined using data from the SEER Program of the National Cancer Institute.
METHODS: Differences in cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis were examined 
for cases diagnosed within the most recent 5-year period, and changes in these 
differences over time were examined for white and black cases aged ≥85 years. 
Five-year relative cancer survival rate was also examined by race.
RESULTS: Among those aged ≥85 years, black men had higher colorectal, lung and 
bronchus, and prostate cancer incidence rates than white men, respectively. From 
1973 to 2012, lung and bronchus and female breast cancer incidence increased, 
while colorectal and prostate cancer incidence decreased among this population. 
Blacks had higher rates of unstaged cancer compared with whites. The 5-year 
relative survival rate for all invasive cancers combined was higher for whites 
than blacks. Notably, whites had more than three times the relative survival 
rate of lung and bronchus cancer when diagnosed at localized (35.1% vs. 11.6%) 
and regional (12.2% vs. 3.2%) stages than blacks, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: White and black differences in cancer incidence, stage, and 
survival exist in the ≥85 population.
IMPACT: Continued efforts are needed to reduce white and black differences in 
cancer prevention and treatment among the ≥85 population. Cancer Epidemiol

Telehealth programs for congestive heart failure have been shown to be 
clinically effective. This study assesses clinical and economic consequences of 
providing telehealth programs for CHF patients. A Markov model was developed and 
presented in the context of a home-based telehealth program on CHF. Incremental 
life expectancy, hospital admissions, and total healthcare costs were examined 
at periods ranging up to five years. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses 
were also conducted on clinical performance parameters. The base case analysis 
yielded cost savings ranging from $2832 to $5499 and 0.03 to 0.04 life year gain 
per patient over a 1-year period. Applying telehealth solution to a low-risk 
cohort with no prior admission history would result in $2502 cost increase per 
person over the 1-year time frame with 0.01 life year gain. Sensitivity analyses 
demonstrated that the cost savings were most sensitive to patient risk, baseline 
cost of hospital admission, and the length-of-stay reduction ratio affected by 
the telehealth programs. In sum, telehealth programs can be cost saving for 
intermediate and high risk patients over a 1- to 5-year window. The results 
suggested the economic viability of telehealth programs for managing CHF 
patients and illustrated the importance of risk stratification in such programs.

Pharmacological management of chronic heart failure in adults: a review of the 
literature.

Medicine, Blantyre, Malawi.

Heart failure is a common, life threatening condition encountered in patients of 
all ages and in all clinical settings. It may be due to any of a wide variety of 
causes - in Malawi, cardiomyopathies, hypertension and rheumatic heart disease 
are probably the commonest causes of heart failure. In more affluent societies, 
ischaemic heart disease is an important factor. Chronic heart failure (CHF) 
causes significant morbidity: it reduces exercise capacity, interferes with 
sleep and produces unsightly and uncomfortable oedema. The syndrome also carries 
substantial mortatity, worse than that of many malignant tumours: 20 -30% of 
patients with mild or moderately severe heart failure will die every year if 
left untreated. The life expectancy of a patient with untreated severe heart 
failure is only about 6 months. Table 1 explains the symptomatic classification 
of the severity of heart failure. Objective measurements of cardiac function, 
such as Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LYEF) or chamber filling pressures, 
correlate poorly with symptoms and New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
classification. Many of the problems experienced by a patient with heart failure 
are due to a 'vicious circle' of events in which pathophysiological responses to 
the falling cardiac output cause further deterioration in cardiac function over 
time. These responses include ventricular remodeling, neurohumoural activation 
(increased sympathetic activity; increased atrial natriuretic peptide; increased 
angiotensin II), increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system 
(RAAS) causing fluid retention, vasoconstriction and sodium retention. [Table: 
see text].

Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy in a HIV Negative, Immunocompetent 
Patient.

Nanda T(1).

Center, 161 Fort Washington Avenue, New York, NY 10032, USA.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare demyelinating disease 
most common in immunodeficient patients. It occurs due to reactivation of the 
John Cunningham Virus (JCV) and carries a poor prognosis, with a median life 
expectancy of 6 months. We report a case of a 66-year-old man with a history of 
HCV related cirrhosis (HCV) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who was found to 
have PML in the setting of a negative viral load in the CSF and a CD4+ >200. He 
initially presented with two weeks of mild confusion and word-finding difficulty 
concerning for hepatic encephalopathy. An MRI was notable for extensive T2/FLAIR 
hyperintensity signal in the left temporal lobe. Brain biopsy was positive for 
JCV. PML is rare in immunocompetent individuals, especially in the setting of a 
negative viral load. It is possible, however, that transient states of 
immunosuppression may have been responsible in this case. Although viral load 
was reported as negative, virus may still have been detected but was below the 
quantifiable threshold. It is important for clinicians to note that a negative 
result does not necessarily exclude the possibility of PML, and care should be 
taken to review lab values on viral load in closer detail.

Women's preferences for contralateral prophylactic mastectomy: An investigation 
using protection motivation theory.

Tesson S, Richards I, Porter D, Phillips KA, Rankin N, Musiello T, Marven M, 
Butow P.

OBJECTIVE: Most women diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer without BRCA1 or 
BRCA2 mutations are at low risk of contralateral breast cancer. Contralateral 
Prophylactic Mastectomy (CPM) decreases the relative risk of contralateral 
breast cancer, but may not increase life expectancy; yet international uptake is 
increasing. This study applied protection motivation theory (PMT) to determine 
factors associated with women's intentions to undergo CPM.
METHODS: Three hundred eighty-eight women previously diagnosed with unilateral 
breast cancer and of negative or unknown BRCA1 or BRCA2 status were recruited 
from an advocacy group's research database. Participants completed measures of 
PMT constructs based on a common hypothetical CPM decision-making scenario.
RESULTS: PMT constructs explained 16% of variance in intentions to undergo CPM. 
Response efficacy (CPM's advantages) and response costs (CPM's disadvantages) 
were unique individual predictors of intentions.
CONCLUSION: Decision-making appears driven by considerations of the 
psychological, cosmetic and emotional advantages and disadvantages of CPM. 
Overestimations of threat to life from contralateral breast cancer and survival 
benefit from CPM also appear influential factors.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Patients require balanced and medically accurate 
information regarding the pros and cons of CPM, survival rates, and recurrence 
risks to ensure realistic and informed decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Behaviours such as smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, and 
unhealthy alcohol consumption are leading risk factors for death. We assessed 
the Canadian burden attributable to these behaviours by developing, validating, 
and applying a multivariable predictive model for risk of all-cause death.
METHODS: A predictive algorithm for 5 y risk of death-the Mortality Population 
Risk Tool (MPoRT)-was developed and validated using the 2001 to 2008 Canadian 
Community Health Surveys. There were approximately 1 million person-years of 
follow-up and 9,900 deaths in the development and validation datasets. After 
validation, MPoRT was used to predict future mortality and estimate the burden 
of smoking, alcohol, physical inactivity, and poor diet in the presence of 
sociodemographic and other risk factors using the 2010 national survey 
(approximately 90,000 respondents). Canadian period life tables were generated 
using predicted risk of death from MPoRT. The burden of behavioural risk factors 
attributable to life expectancy was estimated using hazard ratios from the MPoRT 
risk model.
FINDINGS: The MPoRT 5 y mortality risk algorithms were discriminating 
(C-statistic: males 0.874 [95% CI: 0.867-0.881]; females 0.875 [0.868-0.882]) 
and well calibrated in all 58 predefined subgroups. Discrimination was 
maintained or improved in the validation cohorts. For the 2010 Canadian 
population, unhealthy behaviour attributable life expectancy lost was 6.0 years 
for both men and women (for men 95% CI: 5.8 to 6.3 for women 5.8 to 6.2). The 
Canadian life expectancy associated with health behaviour recommendations was 
17.9 years (95% CI: 17.7 to 18.1) greater for people with the most favourable 
risk profile compared to those with the least favourable risk profile (88.2 
years versus 70.3 years). Smoking, by itself, was associated with 32% to 39% of 
the difference in life expectancy across social groups (by education achieved or 
neighbourhood deprivation).
CONCLUSIONS: Multivariable predictive algorithms such as MPoRT can be used to 
assess health burdens for sociodemographic groups or for small changes in 
population exposure to risks, thereby addressing some limitations of more 
commonly used measurement approaches. Unhealthy behaviours have a substantial 
collective burden on the life expectancy of the Canadian population.

BACKGROUND: An economic analysis from the perspective of the UK National Health 
Service (NHS) evaluated the cost effectiveness of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate 
(LDX) compared with atomoxetine in children and adolescents with 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who have had an inadequate response to 
methylphenidate.
METHODS: A 1-year decision-analytic model was constructed, with the health 
outcomes "response", "nonresponse", and "unable to tolerate". Clinical data were 
taken from a head-to-head, randomized controlled trial in inadequate responders 
to methylphenidate. Response to treatment was defined as a score of 1 (very much 
improved) or 2 (much improved) on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement 
subscale. Tolerability was assessed by discontinuation rates owing to adverse 
events. Utility weights were identified via a systematic literature review. 
Healthcare resource use estimates were obtained via a survey of clinicians. 
Daily drug costs were derived from British National Formulary 2012 costs and 
mean doses reported in the trial. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
(PSAs) were performed.
RESULTS: The comparison of LDX with atomoxetine resulted in an estimate of an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £1802 per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY). The result was robust in a wide range of sensitivity analyses; results 
were most sensitive to changes in drug costs and efficacy. In the PSA, assuming 
a maximum willingness to pay of £20,000 per QALY, LDX versus atomoxetine had an 
86 % probability of being cost effective. In 38 % of PSA runs, LDX was more 
effective and less costly than atomoxetine.
CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the UK NHS, LDX provides a cost-effective 
treatment option for children and adolescents who are inadequate responders to 
methylphenidate.

A Self-Activated Mechanism for Nucleic Acid Polymerization Catalyzed by DNA/RNA 
Polymerases.

The enzymatic polymerization of DNA and RNA is the basis for genetic inheritance 
for all living organisms. It is catalyzed by the DNA/RNA polymerase (Pol) 
superfamily. Here, bioinformatics analysis reveals that the incoming nucleotide 
substrate always forms an H-bond between its 3'-OH and β-phosphate moieties upon 
formation of the Michaelis complex. This previously unrecognized H-bond implies 
a novel self-activated mechanism (SAM), which synergistically connects the in 
situ nucleophile formation with subsequent nucleotide addition and, importantly, 
nucleic acid translocation. Thus, SAM allows an elegant and efficient 
closed-loop sequence of chemical and physical steps for Pol catalysis. This is 
markedly different from previous mechanistic hypotheses. Our proposed mechanism 
is corroborated via ab initio QM/MM simulations on a specific Pol, the human DNA 
polymerase-η, an enzyme involved in repairing damaged DNA. The structural 
conservation of DNA and RNA Pols supports the possible extension of SAM to Pol 
enzymes from the three domains of life.

OBJECTIVE: The article assessed the overall mortality in Brazil in 2000 and 
2010.
METHODS: Data source was the Mortality Information System from Ministry of 
Health of Brazil.
RESULTS: The data show the high rate of mortality among men compared to women 
between ages of 20 to 59 years and an expressive lower life expectancy by this 
population. The main groups of death were: external causes; diseases of the 
circulatory system, diseases of the digestive system, infectious and parasitic 
diseases, diseases of the respiratory system; mental and behavioral disorders; 
diseases of the nervous system; endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases; 
neoplasia and diseases of the genitourinary system.
CONCLUSION: Unequal gender relations and distinct characteristics of exposure to 
risk factors can explain this mortality, highlighting the need to bring critical 
incorporation of relational gender perspective by public health policies.

IMPORTANCE: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors 
were recently approved for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and have potential for broad ASCVD prevention. 
Their long-term cost-effectiveness and effect on total health care spending are 
uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors and their 
potential effect on US health care spending.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model, a 
simulation model of US adults aged 35 to 94 years, was used to evaluate 
cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe in heterozygous FH or ASCVD. 
The model incorporated 2015 annual PCSK9 inhibitor costs of $14,350 (based on 
mean wholesale acquisition costs of evolocumab and alirocumab); adopted a 
health-system perspective, lifetime horizon; and included probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses to explore uncertainty.
EXPOSURES: Statin therapy compared with addition of ezetimibe or PCSK9 
inhibitors.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: 
cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke), incremental 
cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and total effect on US health care 
spending over 5 years.
RESULTS: Adding PCSK9 inhibitors to statins in heterozygous FH was estimated to 
prevent 316,300 MACE at a cost of $503,000 per QALY gained compared with adding 
ezetimibe to statins (80% uncertainty interval [UI], $493,000-$1,737,000). In 
ASCVD, adding PCSK9 inhibitors to statins was estimated to prevent 4.3 million 
MACE compared with adding ezetimibe at $414,000 per QALY (80% UI, 
$277,000-$1,539,000). Reducing annual drug costs to $4536 per patient or less 
would be needed for PCSK9 inhibitors to be cost-effective at less than $100,000 
per QALY. At 2015 prices, PCSK9 inhibitor use in all eligible patients was 
estimated to reduce cardiovascular care costs by $29 billion over 5 years, but 
drug costs increased by an estimated $592 billion (a 38% increase over 2015 
prescription drug expenditures). In contrast, initiating statins in these 
high-risk populations in all statin-tolerant individuals who are not currently 
using statins was estimated to save $12 billion.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Assuming 2015 prices, PCSK9 inhibitor use in patients 
with heterozygous FH or ASCVD did not meet generally acceptable incremental 
cost-effectiveness thresholds and was estimated to increase US health care costs 
substantially. Reducing annual drug prices from more than $14,000 to $4536 would 
be necessary to meet a $100,000 per QALY threshold.

Improving overall health and quality of life, preventing diseases and increasing 
life expectancy are key concerns in the field of public health. The search for 
antioxidants that can inhibit oxidative damage in cells has received a lot of 
attention. Rosmarinus officinalis L. represents an exceptionally rich source of 
bioactive compounds with pharmacological properties. In the present study, we 
explored the effects of the ethanolic extract of R. officinalis (eeRo) on stress 
resistance and longevity using the non-parasitic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans 
as a model. We report for the first time that eeRo increased resistance against 
oxidative and thermal stress and extended C. elegans longevity in an insulin/IGF 
signaling pathway-dependent manner. These data emphasize the eeRo beneficial 
effects on C. elegans under stress.

A positive outcome of the modern welfare state is prolonged life expectancy. In 
Sweden, the expected life span has increased with approximatively 25 years 
during the 20th century [Statistics Sweden]. However, ageing is associated with 
an increased risk for acquiring cognitive and physical disabilities. This study 
is based on anonymized interviews with groups of older persons who experience 
cognitive problems and relatives. The interviewees were asked about everyday 
activities like shopping groceries, clothes or other necessities. The 
interviewees identified problems and described a series of strategies for 
coping. This paper uses fictionalized characters to present problems and coping 
strategies that the interviewees use to overcome cognitive challenges when 
shopping groceries. The strategies range from complete withdrawal, an increased 
dependency on proxies to the development of elaborate techniques to mask their 
problem and obtain assistance. Following the current trend in the design of the 
Swedish sales environment - large scale, abundance of goods and Maslowian 
strategies for making people stay longer (and spend more money) - accessibility 
in the built environment is often an absent friend.

BACKGROUND: Achalasia is a rare motility disorder of the esophagus. Treatment is 
palliative with the goal of symptom remission and slowing the progression of the 
disease. Treatment options include per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), 
laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LM) and endoscopic treatments such as pneumatic 
dilation (PD) and botulinum toxin type A injections (BI). We evaluate the 
economics and cost-effectiveness of treating achalasia.
METHODS: We performed cost analysis for POEM, LM, PD and BI at our institution 
from 2011 to 2015. Cost of LM was set to 1, and other procedures are presented 
as percentage change. Cost-effectiveness was calculated based on cost, number of 
interventions required for optimal results for dilations and injections and 
efficacy reported in the current literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio was calculated by a cost-utility analysis using quality-adjusted life year 
gained, defined as a symptom-free year in a patient with achalasia.
RESULTS: Average number of interventions required was 2.3 dilations or two 
injections for efficacies of 80 and 61 %, respectively. POEM cost 1.058 times 
the cost of LM, and PD and BI cost 0.559 and 0.448 times the cost of LM. Annual 
cost per cure over a period of 4 years for POEM, and LM were consistently 
equivalent, trending the same as PD although this has a lower initial cost. The 
cost per cure of BI remains stable over 3 years and then doubles.
CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of POEM and LM is equivalent. Myotomy, either 
surgical or endoscopic, is more cost-effective than BI due to high failure rates 
of the economical intervention. When treatment is being considered BI should be 
utilized in patients with less than 2-year life expectancy. Pneumatic dilations 
are cost-effective and are an acceptable approach to treatment of achalasia, 
although myotomy has a lower relapse rate and is cost-effective compared to PD 
after 2 years.

Life extension is no longer considered sufficient evidence of delayed aging in 
research animals. It must also be demonstrated that a broad swathe of health 
indicators have been extended. During a retreat of the Geroscience Network, a 
consortium of basic and clinical aging researchers, potential measures of mouse 
health were considered for their potential as easily standardized, highly 
informative metrics. Major health domains considered were neuromuscular, 
cognitive, cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory functions as well as body 
composition and energetics and a multitude of assays interrogating these 
domains. A particularly sensitive metric of health is the ability to respond to, 
and recover, from stress. Therefore, the Network also considered stresses of 
human relevance that could be implemented in mouse models to assess frailty and 
resilience. Mouse models already exist for responses to forced immobility, 
cancer chemotherapy, infectious diseases, dietary challenges, and surgical 
stress, and it was felt that these could be employed to determine whether 
putative senescence-retarding interventions increased and extended organismal 
robustness. The Network discussed challenges in modeling age-related human 
chronic diseases and concluded that more attention needs to be paid to 
developing disease models with later age of onset, models of co- and 
multimorbidity, diversifying the strains and sexes commonly used in aging 
research, and considering additional species.

Incheon, Korea.

PURPOSE: The results of ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearing surfaces in primary 
total hip arthroplasty (THA) were well known. However, it was not known in 
revision THA. The purpose of this study is to report the results of revision THA 
with ceramic articulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 112 revision THAs were evaluated. The mean age 
at the time of surgery was 51.6 years (27.7 to 84.2 years). The mean duration of 
the follow-up periods was 6.3 years (2.3 to 11.4 years).
RESULTS: The Harris hip scores improved from an average of 56.2 at the index 
surgery to an average of 93.3 at the last follow-up (P<0.001). None of hips 
showed osteolysis or ceramic head fracture. One hip showed aseptic loosening in 
the acetabular component with squeaking that caused a re-revision. There were 
nine cases of dislocation. The survivorship at 5 years was 94.5% (95% confidence 
interval, 87.9% to 97.6%) with revision for any reason as the endpoint and 100% 
with femoral revision.
CONCLUSION: The ceramic articulation is one of good bearing options for revision 
THA in patients with a long life expectancy.

Modeling and Control of Colorectal Cancer.

Author information:
(1)Department of Computer Science and Technology, North University of China, 
Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.

Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is becoming a major threat to people's life in China. 
Screening methods adopted by many other countries as effective counter-cancer 
methods have not been explicitly explored for people there. Thus, we present a 
Markov model with detailed precancerous adenoma states and then evaluate various 
screening strategies in this paper. Different from current researches, our model 
considers the population's heterogeneous risk of developing adenomas and 
observation-based screening strategies. Furthermore, we also give a new 
cost-effectiveness metric. After calibrating, the model is simulated using the 
Monte Carlo method. Numerical results show that there are threshold values of 
compliance rates below which strategy with every ten-year colonoscopy becomes 
the most cost-effective method; otherwise, an observation-based screening 
strategy is the most cost-effective. We also find that strategy with single 
colonoscopy for adenoma-free individuals and every three-year colonoscopy for 
those with adenoma is recommended when the observation-based strategy is not 
considered. Our findings give an explicit and complete instruction in CRC 
screening protocol in average-risk Chinese.
