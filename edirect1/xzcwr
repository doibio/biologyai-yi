life. However, individuals with transfemoral amputations have difficulties in 
preventing falls due to prosthetic knee buckling, defined as the sudden loss of 
postural support during weight-bearing activities. The risk of prosthetic knee 
buckling can be evaluated by determining the prosthetic knee angular impulse 
(PKAI) during the early stance phase. However, little is known about the factors 
associated with PKAI in individuals with unilateral transfemoral amputations.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the demographic factors that can be associated with 
the risk of prosthetic knee buckling, quantified by PKAI, during walking in 
individuals with unilateral transfemoral amputations?
METHODS: Thirteen individuals with unilateral transfemoral amputations were 
instructed to perform level walking at a comfortable, self-selected speed on a 
straight, 10-m walkway. PKAI was calculated as the time integral of the 
prosthetic knee external flexion-extension moment during the initial 40 % of the 
prosthetic gait cycle. We used Pearson's correlation coefficients to examine the 
relationship of PKAI with the following variables: the subject's body height, 
body mass, and age; the time since amputation; and the current prosthesis use 
history. Furthermore, an independentt-test was used to compare PKAI according to 
the sex (male vs. female) and etiology (trauma vs. nontrauma).
RESULTS: PKAI exhibited a significant negative linear relationship with the 
subject's body height and body mass. However, it showed no significant 
correlation with age, the time since amputation, and the current prosthesis use 
history. It was also significantly greater in women than in men and was not 
significantly influenced by the etiology.
SIGNIFICANCE: Awareness about demographic factors associated with PKAI during 
walking can contribute to fall assessments in gait rehabilitation programs for 
individuals with unilateral transfemoral amputations.

Background and Purpose- Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and atrial 
fibrillation (AF) are at risk for ischemic events. While risk calculators 
(CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED) have been validated to assess risk for ischemic 
stroke and major bleeding in AF patients, decisions about anticoagulation must 
consider the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation. Furthermore, stroke and 
bleeding risk are highly correlated, making decisions more difficult. Methods- 
We examined patients in the GERFHS III study (Genetic and Environmental Risk 
Factors for Hemorrhagic Stroke)-a population-based retrospective study of 
spontaneous ICH patients without a structural or traumatic cause in the Greater 
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region between July 2008 and December 2012. 
CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-B(L)ED (minus L because labile international normalized 
ratio was unavailable) scores were calculated for ICH patients with AF. Using a 
Markov state transition model, we estimated net clinical benefit of 
anticoagulation relative to no treatment in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). 
We defined minimal clinically relevant benefit as 0.1 QALYs. Results- Among 1186 
cases of spontaneous ICH, 95 cases had AF and met our survival criteria. Within 
1 year, 8 of 95 (8%) would be expected to have a major bleeding event on 
anticoagulation, and 5 of 95 (5%) of patients would be expected to have an 
ischemic stroke off anticoagulation. Sixty-eight of 95 (71%) patients would have 
higher risk for major bleeding than for ischemic stroke. Anticoagulation with 
directly acting anticoagulants would result in no clinically significant gain or 
loss in 73%. Roughly 12% would gain >0.1 QALYs, and 15% would lose >0.1 QALYs. 
Among patients receiving aspirin, most have no significant net clinical benefit 
or loss. Overall, anticoagulation of the entire cohort would result in an 
aggregate loss of 0.92 QALYs. Conclusions- Our analysis suggests that universal 
anticoagulation after ICH would be associated with a net loss of QALY. 
Additional factors should be considered before anticoagulating patients with AF 
after ICH. Registration- URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier:

BACKGROUND: Robot-based rehabilitation for persons post-stroke may improve arm 
function and daily-life activities as measured by clinical scales, but its 
effects on motor strategies during functional tasks are still poorly 
investigated. This study aimed at assessing the effects of robot-therapy versus 
arm-specific physiotherapy in persons post-stroke on motor strategies derived 
from upper body instrumented kinematic analysis, and on arm function measured by 
clinical scales.
METHODS: Forty persons in the sub-acute and chronic stage post-stroke were 
recruited. This sample included all those subjects, enrolled in a larger 
bi-center study, who underwent instrumented kinematic analysis and who were 
randomized in Center 2 into Robot (R_Group) and Control Group (C_Group). R_Group 
received robot-assisted training. C_Group received arm-specific treatment 
delivered by a physiotherapist. Pre- and post-training assessment included 
clinical scales and instrumented kinematic analysis of arm and trunk during a 
virtual untrained task simulating the transport of an object onto a shelf. 
Instrumented outcomes included shoulder/elbow coordination, elbow extension and 
trunk sagittal compensation. Clinical outcomes included Fugl-Meyer Motor 
Assessment of Upper Extremity (FM-UE), modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and 
Functional Independence Measure (FIM).
RESULTS: R_Group showed larger post-training improvements of shoulder/elbow 
coordination (Cohen's d = - 0.81, p = 0.019), elbow extension (Cohen's 
d = - 0.71, p = 0.038), and trunk movement (Cohen's d = - 1.12, p = 0.002). Both 
groups showed comparable improvements in clinical scales, except proximal 
muscles MAS that decreased more in R_Group (Cohen's d = - 0.83, p = 0.018). 
Ancillary analyses on chronic subjects confirmed these results and revealed 
larger improvements after robot-therapy in the proximal portion of FM-UE 
(Cohen's d = 1.16, p = 0.019).
CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted rehabilitation was as effective as arm-specific 
physiotherapy in reducing arm impairment (FM-UE) in persons post-stroke, but it 
was more effective in improving motor control strategies adopted during an 
untrained task involving vertical movements not practiced during training. 
Specifically, robot therapy induced larger improvements of shoulder/elbow 
coordination and greater reduction of abnormal trunk sagittal movements. The 
beneficial effects of robot therapy seemed more pronounced in chronic subjects. 
Future studies on a larger sample should be performed to corroborate present 
findings.

In economic evaluation, the healthcare perspective has gradually given way to 
use of the societal perspective, as this perspective is often advocated for 
support in making optimal societal decisions. In practice, economic evaluations 
conducted from the societal perspective ignore, fail to measure and/or fail to 
monetize many of the costs that fall outside of the healthcare sector. To limit 
bias and increase decision-supportive power, researchers could strengthen their 
evaluations by adhering to a few basic principles. Five "pillars for the 
societal perspective" are proposed. First, who bears the cost and who does not 
is irrelevant. Second, it is imperative to consider including costs for sectors 
outside the healthcare sector. Third, both high frequent costs and costs with 
high unit prices should be considered. Fourth, double counting should be 
avoided. And fifth, researchers should reflect on choices related to costs, i.e. 
cost omission and problems with identifying, measuring, and valuing costs.

INTRODUCTION: Recommending both the conjugate and polysaccharide pneumococcal 
vaccines to all U.S. seniors may have little public health impact and be 
economically unreasonable. Public health impact and cost-effectiveness of using 
both vaccines in all adults aged ≥65 years were estimated compared with an 
alternative strategy (omitting pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the 
nonimmunocompromised) and with the newly revised recommendation (giving or 
omitting conjugate vaccine based on patient-physician shared decision making).
METHODS: Strategies were examined in hypothetical U.S. 65-year-old population 
cohorts and segmented into health states based on age- and population-specific 
data in a Markov state-transition model with a lifetime time horizon from a 
healthcare perspective. Black population cohorts were examined separately given 
greater illness risk and lower vaccine uptake. Model parameters came from the 
Centers for Disease Control Active Core Bacterial Surveillance network, National 
Health Interview Survey, and Nationwide Inpatient Sample data. Outcomes included 
incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained and pneumococcal disease 
outcomes for each strategy. Data were gathered and analysis performed in 2018.
RESULTS: Giving both vaccines, either routinely or with shared decision making, 
was most effective, reducing pneumococcal disease incidence compared with no 
vaccination, but costing $765,000-$2.18 million/quality-adjusted life year 
gained. Depending on examined population and scenario, the alternative strategy 
cost $65,700-$226,700/quality-adjusted life year gained (less in black 
populations) and reduced cases and deaths by 0.3%-0.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: A vaccination strategy that omits pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 
immunocompetent U.S. seniors may be economically reasonable, particularly for 
black seniors. Use of both pneumococcal vaccines was more effective but 
substantially more expensive.

PURPOSE: Liver transplantation is the standard definitive treatment for 
nonmetastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, less than 5% of patients 
are ultimately candidates as a result of frequent comorbidities and graft 
shortage. The aim of this study was to evaluate stereotactic body radiation 
therapy (SBRT) as an ablative treatment for inoperable HCC.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A prospective phase 2 trial included newly diagnosed 
single HCC lesions that were without extrahepatic extension and that were deemed 
unsuitable for standard locoregional therapies, with a tumor size ranging from 1 
to 6 cm. The SBRT dose was 45 Gy in 3 fractions. Primary endpoint was the local 
control of irradiated HCC at 18 months, defined by Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients were treated and evaluable. Median follow-up was 
4.0 years (range, 1.2-4.6 years). All 43 patients had cirrhosis; 37 (88%) were 
Child-Pugh grade A and 5 (12%) grade B (1 missing data). No patients had 
received prior local treatment. Thirteen patients (31%) presented grade ≥3 acute 
adverse events, including 8 patients with an abnormality of the liver function 
tests (19%). Three patients (10%) experienced a decline in Child-Pugh at 3 
months post-SBRT. The 18-month local control rate was 98% (95% confidence 
interval, 85%-99%). The 18-month overall survival rate was 72% (range, 56%-83%). 
Median overall survival was 3.5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Local control and overall survival after SBRT for untreated 
solitary HCC were excellent despite candidates being unfit for transplantation, 
resection, ablation, or embolization treatments. SBRT should be considered as a 
bridge to transplant or as definitive therapy for those ineligible for 
transplant.

Stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy (SRS/SRT) is a hypofractionated treatment 
where accurate dose calculation is of prime importance. The accuracy of the dose 
calculation depends on the treatment planning algorithm. This study is a 
retrospective dosimetric comparison of iPlanⓇ Monte Carlo (MC) and Pencil Beam 
(PB) algorithms in SRS/SRT plans of cranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). 
PB plans of 60 AVM patients who were already treated using 6 MV photons from a 
linear accelerator were selected and divided into 2 groups. Group-I consists of 
30 patients who have undergone embolization procedure with high density OnyxⓇ 
prior to radiosurgery whereas Group-II had 30 patients who did not have 
embolization. These plans were recalculated with MC algorithm while keeping 
parameters like beam orientation, multileaf collimator (MLC) positions, MLC 
margin, prescription dose, and monitor units constant. Several treatment 
coverage parameters, isodose volumes, plan quality metrics, dose to organs at 
risk, and integral dose were used for comparing the 2 algorithms. The isodose 
distribution generated by the 2 algorithms was also compared with gamma analysis 
using 1%/1 mm criterion. The difference between the 2 groups as well as the 
differences in dose calculation by PB and MC algorithms were tested for 
significance using independent t-test and paired t-test respectively at 5% level 
of significance. The results of the independent t-test showed that there is no 
significant difference between the Group-I and Group-II patients for PB as well 
as MC algorithm due to the presence of high density embolization material. 
However, results of the paired t-test showed that the differences between the PB 
and MC algorithms were significant for several parameters analyzed in both 
groups of patients. The gamma analysis results also showed differences in the 
dose calculated by the 2 algorithms especially in the low dose regions. The 
significant differences between the 2 algorithms are probably due to the 
incorrect representation of the loss of lateral charged particle equilibrium and 
lateral broadening of small photon beams by PB algorithm. MC algorithms are 
generally considered not essential for dose calculations for target volumes 
located in the brain. This study demonstrates PB algorithm may not be 
sufficiently accurate to predict dose distributions for small fields where there 
is loss of LCPE. The lateral broadening due to the loss of LCPE as predicted by 
the MC algorithm could be the main reason for significant differences in the 
parameters compared. Hence, an accurate MC algorithm if available may prove 
valuable for intracranial SRS treatment planning of such benign lesions where 
the long life expectancy of patients makes accurate dosimetry critical.

Sadness is typically characterized by raised inner eyebrows, lowered corners of 
the mouth, reduced walking speed, and slumped posture. Ancient subcortical 
circuitry provides a neuroanatomical foundation, extending from dorsal 
periaqueductal grey to subgenual anterior cingulate, the latter of which is now 
a treatment target in disorders of sadness. Electrophysiological studies further 
emphasize a role for reduced left relative to right frontal asymmetry in 
sadness, underpinning interest in the transcranial stimulation of left 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as an antidepressant target. Neuroimaging studies 
- including meta-analyses - indicate that sadness is associated with reduced 
cortical activation, which may contribute to reduced parasympathetic inhibitory 
control over medullary cardioacceleratory circuits. Reduced cardiac control may 
- in part - contribute to epidemiological reports of reduced life expectancy in 
affective disorders, effects equivalent to heavy smoking. We suggest that the 
field may be moving toward a theoretical consensus, in which different models 
relating to basic emotion theory and psychological constructionism may be 
considered as complementary, working at different levels of the phylogenetic 
hierarchy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic thoracic pain, even though not as prevalent as low 
back and neck pain, appears in approximately 30% of the general population. The 
severity of thoracic pain and degree of disability seems to be similar to other 
painful conditions. Despite this severity, interventions in managing chronic 
thoracic pain are less frequent, and there is a paucity of literature regarding 
epidural injections and facet joint interventions.
RECENT FINDINGS: As with lumbar and cervical spine, a multitude of interventions 
are offered in managing chronic thoracic pain, including interventional 
techniques with epidural injections and facet joint interventions. A single 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been published with a 2-year follow-up of 
clinical effectiveness of the results. However, there have not been any 
cost-utility analysis studies pertaining to either epidural injections or facet 
joint interventions in thoracic pain. Based on the results of the RCT, a 
cost-utility analysis of thoracic interlaminar epidural injections was 
undertaken. Evaluation of the cost-utility analysis of thoracic interlaminar 
epidural injections with or without steroids in managing thoracic disc 
herniation, thoracic spinal stenosis, and thoracic discogenic or axial pain was 
assessed in 110 patients with a 2-year follow-up. Direct payment data from 2018 
was utilized for procedural costs and indirect costs. Costs, including drug 
costs, were determined by multiplication of direct procedural payment data by a 
factor of 1.67 or addition of 40% of cost to accommodate for indirect payments 
and arrive at overall costs. Cost-utility analysis showed direct procedural cost 
of USD $1943.19, whereas total estimated costs year per QALY were USD $3245.12.

Alternative strategies can reduce road vehicle emissions, with differential 
effects on exposure across population groups. We compare alternative strategies 
in West Yorkshire using a framework for economic evaluation that considers 
multiple perspectives and that takes account of the distribution of health 
outcomes. Exposure to pollutants by area is converted, via dose response 
relationships, into disease averted. Health benefits and National Health Service 
costs from diseases are estimated conditional on population demographics and 
index of multiple deprivation. The net health benefits from alternative 
strategies are expressed as distributions of quality-adjusted life expectancy 
(QALE), which are compared using dominance criteria and societal aversion to 
health inequality. Net production is estimated from intervention costs and the 
effects of health improvement on production and consumption. Social care 
outcomes are estimated from health improvement among care recipients and changes 
in care expenditure. A switch to less polluting private vehicles is dominant in 
terms of the distribution of QALE and social care outcomes but not consumption. 
Inclusion of health inequality aversion alters the rank order compared with 
prioritisation on health maximisation. The results were sensitive to the 
magnitude of health opportunity costs, the level of inequality aversion, and the 
proportion of intervention cost that generates health opportunity cost.

OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the length of working life, even though it is 
a key indicator for policy-makers. In this paper, we study how the length of 
working life at age 50 has developed in the United States from a cohort 
perspective.
METHODS: We use a large longitudinal sample of U.S. Social Security register 
data that covers close to 1.7 million individuals of the cohorts born from 1920 
to 1965. For all of these cohorts, we study the employment trajectories and 
working life expectancy (WLE) at age 50 by gender and nativity 
(native-born/foreign-born). For the cohorts with employment trajectories that 
are only incompletely observed, we borrow information from older cohorts to 
predict their WLE.
RESULTS: The length of working life has been increasing for the native-born 
males and females, and the younger cohorts worked longer than the older cohorts. 
However, WLE might soon peak, and then stall. The gap in WLE between the 
native-born and the foreign-born has increased over time, although latter group 
might be able to catch up in the coming years.
DISCUSSION: Our ﬁndings show that studying employment from a cohort perspective 
reveals crucial information about patterns of working life. The future 
development of the length of working life should be a major concern for 
policy-makers.

Despite food technology advancements, food safety policies and alert systems, 
foodborne diseases are still a relevant concern for consumers and public health 
authorities, with great impacts on the economy and the society. Evaluating the 
cost of foodborne diseases may support the design and the implementation of 
policy interventions. This paper proposes a simple method for cost 
identification of foodborne diseases, accessible to researchers and 
practitioners who are not specialist in economics. The method is based on the 
assumption that epidemiological and economic models can be integrated to 
understand how the burden of disease determines costs in a wider socio-economic 
perspective. Systems thinking and interdisciplinary approach are the pivotal 
conceptual tools of the method. Systems thinking allows for the understanding of 
the complex relationships working among the elementary units of a system (e.g. 
wildlife, bred animals, consumers, environment, agro-food industry) in the 
occurrence of a health problem such foodborne diseases. Complex systemic 
relationships usually cross the traditional boundaries of scientific knowledge 
(human medicine, veterinary science, economics) and sectoral institutional 
responsibilities (e.g. ministry of health, ministry of agriculture). For these 
reasons more scientific disciplines, institutional competences and social bodies 
need to work together to face complex health problems, in an interdisciplinary 
framework. The first step of the proposed method is the identification of the 
potential cost of the disease. To this aim, the authors first focus on the links 
between epidemiological and economic models, based on the fact that foodborne 
diseases, likewise other diseases, hit people's and animals' aptitude to produce 
utility and goods for the society (e.g. wellbeing, revenue, safe food). These 
utility losses are real economic costs. Then they show how simple economic 
models, such as the food supply chain, can help understand the way costs spread 
across the economic sectors and the society. It should be underlined that the 
authors adopt already existing and well rooted scientific tools, focusing in 
particular that their integration in an interdisciplinary framework can 
effectively contribute to increase the understanding of complex health problems 
in a viable way.

OBJECTIVE: Despite efforts toward achieving gender equality in clinical trial 
enrollment, females are often underrepresented, and gender-specific data 
analysis is often unavailable. Identifying and reducing gender bias in medical 
decision-making and outcome reporting may facilitate equitable healthcare 
delivery. Gender disparity in the utilization of surgical therapy has been 
exemplified in the orthopedic literature through studies of total joint 
arthroplasty. A paucity of literature is available to guide the management of 
lumbar degenerative disease, which stratifies on the basis of demographic 
factors. The objective of this study was to systematically map and synthesize 
the adult surgical literature regarding gender differences in pre- and 
postoperative patient-reported clinical assessment scores for patients with 
lumbar degenerative disease (disc degeneration, disc herniation, 
spondylolisthesis, and spinal canal stenosis).
METHODS: A systematic scoping review was performed according to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping 
Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Registry of 
Controlled Trials were searched from inception to September 2018. Study 
characteristics including patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, and pre- 
and postoperative clinical assessment scores (pain, disability, and 
health-related quality of life [HRQoL]) were collected.
RESULTS: Thirty articles were identified, accounting for 32,951 patients. Six 
studies accounted for 84% of patients; 5 of the 6 studies were published by 
European groups. The most common lumbar degenerative conditions were disc 
herniation (59.0%), disc degeneration (20.3%), and spinal canal stenosis 
(15.9%). The majority of studies reported worse preoperative pain (93.3%), 
disability (81.3%), and HRQoL (75%) among females. The remainder reported 
equivalent preoperative scores between males and females. The majority of 
studies (63.3%) did not report preoperative duration of symptoms, and this 
represents a limitation of the data. Eighty percent of studies found that 
females had worse absolute postoperative scores in at least one outcome category 
(pain, disability, or HRQoL). The remainder reported equivalent absolute 
postoperative scores between males and females. Seventy-three percent of studies 
reported either an equivalent or greater interval change for females.
CONCLUSIONS: Female patients undergoing surgery for lumbar degenerative disease 
(disc degeneration, disc herniation, spondylolisthesis, and spinal canal 
stenosis) have worse absolute preoperative pain, disability, and HRQoL. 
Following surgery, females have worse absolute pain, disability, and HRQoL, but 
demonstrate an equal or greater interval change compared to males. Further 
studies should examine gender differences in preoperative workup and clinical 
course.

BACKGROUND: Biomechanical characteristics of noncontinuous ACDF and 
noncontinuous CDA in the treatment of noncontinuous cervical degenerative disc 
disease were still unclear. The aim of this research is to compare the 
differences between these two kinds of treatment methods and to verify the 
effectiveness of Prodisc-C in noncontinuous CDA.
METHODS: Eight FEMs of the cervical spine (C2-C7) were built based on CT images 
of 8 mild CDDD volunteers. In the arthroplasty group, we inserted Prodisc-C at 
C3/4 and C5/6. In the fusion group, CoRoent® Contour and NuVasive® Helix ACP 
were implanted at C3/4 and C5/6. Initial loads of 75 N were used to simulate the 
head weight and muscle forces. The application of 1.0 N m moment on the top on 
the C2 vertebra was used to create motion in all directions. Statistical 
analyses were performed using STATA version 14.0 (Stata Corp LP, College 
Station, Texas, USA). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
RESULTS: The IDPs in C2/3 (P < 0.001, P = 0.005, P < 0.001, P < 0.001), C4/5 (P 
< 0.001), and C6/7 (P < 0.001) of the intact group were significantly less than 
that in the fusion group in flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial 
rotation, respectively. In addition, the IDPs in C2/3 (P < 0.001, P = 0.001, P < 
0.001, P < 0.001), C4/5 (P < 0.001), and C6/7 (P < 0.001) of the arthroplasty 
group were significantly less than that in the fusion group in flexion, 
extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation, respectively. Contact forces of 
facet joints in C2/3 (P = 0.010) in the arthroplasty group was significantly 
less than that in the intact group. Contact forces of facet joints in C2/3 (P < 
0.001), C4/5 (P < 0.001), and C6/7 (P < 0.001) in the arthroplasty group was 
significantly less than that in the fusion group. Contact forces of facet joints 
in C2/3 (P < 0.001), C4/5 (P < 0.001), and C6/7 (P < 0.001) in the intact group 
were significantly less than that in the fusion group.
CONCLUSIONS: Noncontinuous CDA could preserve IDP and facet joint forces at the 
adjacent and intermediate levels to maintain the kinematics of cervical spine 
near preoperative values. However, noncontinuous ACDF would increase 
degenerative risks at adjacent and intermediate levels. In addition, the 
application of Prodisc-C in noncontinuous CAD may have more advantages than that 
of Prestige LP.

BACKGROUND: China is facing challenges of the shifting presentation of 
tuberculosis (TB) from younger to elderly due to an ageing population, longer 
life expectancy and reactivation disease. However, the burden of elderly TB and 
influence factors are not yet clear. To fill the gap, we generated a cohort 
study to measure the magnitude of TB incidence and associated factors among the 
elderly population aged 65 years and above in China.
METHODS: In this cohort established in 2013 through a prevalence survey 
conducted in selected sites, a total of 34 076 elderlies without TB were 
enrolled into two-year follow-up. We used both active and passive case findings 
to find out all TB patients among them. The person-year (PY) incidence rates for 
both bacteriologically positive TB and active TB were calculated. Cox 
proportional regression model was performed to test effect of risk factors, and 
the population attributable fraction (PAF) of each risk factor contributing to 
incident TB among elderlies was calculated.
RESULTS: Over the two-year follow-up period, a total of 215 incident active TB 
were identified, 62 of which were bacteriologically positive. The incidence 
rates for active TB and bacteriologically positive TB were 481.8 per 100 000 PY 
(95% CI: 417.4-546.2 per 100 000 PY) and 138.9 per 100 000 PY (95% CI: 
104.4-173.5 per 100 000 PY), respectively. Incident cases detected by active 
case finding were significantly higher (P < 0.001). Male, non-Han nationality, 
previously treated TB, ex/current smoker and body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 
presented as independent predictors for developing TB disease. For developing 
bacteriologically positive TB, the biggest contribution was from self-reported 
ex or current smoker (18.06%). And, for developing active TB, the biggest 
contribution was from non-Han nationality (35.40%), followed by male (26.80%) 
and age at 75 years and above (10.85%).
CONCLUSIONS: Ageing population in China had a high TB incidence rate and risk to 
develop TB disease, implying that National TB Program (NTP) needs to prioritize 
for elderly. Active case finding should be applied capture more active TB cases 
among this particular population, especially for male, non-Han nationality, and 
those with identified risk factors.

The ongoing worldwide increase in life expectancy portends a rising prevalence 
of age-related cardiovascular (CV) diseases in the coming decades that demands a 
deeper understanding of their molecular mechanisms. Inflammation has recently 
emerged as an important contributor for CV disease development. Indeed, a state 
of chronic sterile low-grade inflammation characterizes older organisms (also 
known as inflamm-ageing) and participates pivotally in the development of 
frailty, disability, and most chronic degenerative diseases including 
age-related CV and cerebrovascular afflictions. Due to chronic activation of 
inflammasomes and to reduced endogenous anti-inflammatory mechanisms, 
inflamm-ageing contributes to the activation of leucocytes, endothelial, and 
vascular smooth muscle cells, thus accelerating vascular ageing and 
atherosclerosis. Furthermore, inflamm-ageing promotes the development of 
catastrophic athero-thrombotic complications by enhancing platelet reactivity 
and predisposing to plaque rupture and erosion. Thus, inflamm-ageing and its 
contributors or molecular mediators might furnish targets for novel therapeutic 
strategies that could promote healthy ageing and conserve resources for health 
care systems worldwide. Here, we discuss recent findings in the pathophysiology 
of inflamm-ageing, the impact of these processes on the development of 
age-related CV diseases, results from clinical trials targeting its components 
and the potential implementation of these advances into daily clinical practice.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012 Apr 18;(4):CD006282.

BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by a homozygous deletion of 
the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene on chromosome 5, or a heterozygous 
deletion in combination with a (point) mutation in the second SMN1 allele. This 
results in degeneration of anterior horn cells, which leads to progressive 
muscle weakness. Children with SMA type II do not develop the ability to walk 
without support and have a shortened life expectancy, whereas children with SMA 
type III develop the ability to walk and have a normal life expectancy. This is 
an update of a review first published in 2009 and previously updated in 2011.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate if drug treatment is able to slow or arrest the disease 
progression of SMA types II and III, and to assess if such therapy can be given 
safely.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, 
CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and ISI Web of Science conference proceedings in 
October 2018. In October 2018, we also searched two trials registries to 
identify unpublished trials.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought all randomised or quasi-randomised trials that 
examined the efficacy of drug treatment for SMA types II and III. Participants 
had to fulfil the clinical criteria and have a homozygous deletion or hemizygous 
deletion in combination with a point mutation in the second allele of the SMN1 
gene (5q11.2-13.2) confirmed by genetic analysis. The primary outcome measure 
was change in disability score within one year after the onset of treatment. 
Secondary outcome measures within one year after the onset of treatment were 
change in muscle strength, ability to stand or walk, change in quality of life, 
time from the start of treatment until death or full-time ventilation and 
adverse events attributable to treatment during the trial period. Treatment 
strategies involving SMN1-replacement with viral vectors are out of the scope of 
this review, but a summary is given in Appendix 1. Drug treatment for SMA type I 
is the topic of a separate Cochrane Review.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology.
MAIN RESULTS: The review authors found 10 randomised, placebo-controlled trials 
of treatments for SMA types II and III for inclusion in this review, with 717 
participants. We added four of the trials at this update. The trials 
investigated creatine (55 participants), gabapentin (84 participants), 
hydroxyurea (57 participants), nusinersen (126 participants), olesoxime (165 
participants), phenylbutyrate (107 participants), somatotropin (20 
participants), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (nine participants), valproic 
acid (33 participants), and combination therapy with valproic acid and 
acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) (61 participants). Treatment duration was from three to 
24 months. None of the studies investigated the same treatment and none was 
completely free of bias. All studies had adequate blinding, sequence generation 
and reporting of primary outcomes. Based on moderate-certainty evidence, 
intrathecal nusinersen improved motor function (disability) in children with SMA 
type II, with a 3.7-point improvement in the nusinersen group on the Hammersmith
