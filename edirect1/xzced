OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the mechanical 
responses of dorsal neck muscles in individuals with whiplash-associated 
disorders (WAD) versus healthy individuals.
DESIGN: This study included 36 individuals with WAD (26 women and 10 men) and 36 
healthy controls (26 women and 10 men). Ultrasound imaging with speckle tracking 
was used to measure deformation and deformation rate in five dorsal neck muscles 
during a neck extension task.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, individuals with WAD showed higher deformations 
of the semispinalis cervicis (P = 0.02) and multifidus (P = 0.002) muscles and 
higher deformation rates (P = 0.03 and 0.0001, respectively). Among individuals 
with WAD, multifidus deformation and deformation rate were significantly 
associated with pain, disability, and fatigue (r = 0.31-0.46, P = 0.0001-0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the mechanical responses of the deep 
dorsal neck muscles differ between individuals with WAD and healthy controls, 
possibly reflecting that these muscles use altered strategies while performing a 
neck extension task. This finding provides new insight into neck muscles 
pathology in patients with chronic WAD and may help improve rehabilitation 
programs.

BACKGROUND: Women live on average five years longer than men, and the sex 
difference in longevity is typically lower in populations with high mortality. 
South Africa-a high mortality population with a large sex disparity-is an 
exception, but the causes of death that contribute to this difference are not 
well understood.
METHODS: Using data from a demographic surveillance system in rural 
KwaZulu-Natal (2000-2014), we estimate differences between male and female adult 
life expectancy by HIV status. The contribution of causes of death to these life 
expectancy differences are computed with demographic decomposition techniques. 
Cause of death information comes from verbal autopsy interviews that are 
interpreted with the InSilicoVA tool.
RESULTS: Adult women lived an average of 10.4 years (95% confidence Interval 
9.0-11.6) longer than men. Sex differences in adult life expectancy were even 
larger when disaggregated by HIV status: 13.1 (95% confidence interval 
10.7-15.3) and 11.2 (95% confidence interval 7.5-14.8) years among known HIV 
negatives and positives, respectively. Elevated male mortality from pulmonary 
tuberculosis (TB) and external injuries were responsible for 43% and 31% of the 
sex difference in life expectancy among the HIV negative population, and 81% and 
16% of the difference among people living with HIV.
CONCLUSIONS: The sex differences in adult life expectancy in rural KwaZulu-Natal 
are exceptionally large, atypical for an African population, and largely driven 
by high male mortality from pulmonary TB and injuries. This is the case for both 
HIV positive and HIV negative men and women, signalling a need to improve the 
engagement of men with health services, irrespective of their HIV status.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether investments made in public health research align 
with the health burdens experienced by white and black Americans.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study of all deaths in the United States in 
2015, we compared the distribution of potential years of life lost (PYLL) across 
39 causes of death by race and identified key differences. We examined the 
relationship between cause-of-death-specific PYLL and key indicators of public 
health investment (federal funding and number of publications) by race using 
linear spline models. We also compared the number of courses available at the 
top schools of public health relevant to the top causes of death contributor to 
PYLL for black and white Americans.
RESULTS: Homicide was the number one contributor to PYLL among black Americans, 
while ischemic heart disease was the number one contributor to PYLL among white 
Americans. Firearm-related violence accounted for 88% of black PYLL attributed 
to homicide and 71% of white PYLL attributed to homicide. Despite the high 
burden of PYLL, homicide research was the focus of few federal grants or 
publications. In comparison, ischemic heart disease garnered 341 grants and 594 
publications. The number of public health courses available relevant to homicide 
(n = 9) was similar to those relevant to ischemic heart disease (n = 10).
CONCLUSIONS: Black Americans are disproportionately affected by homicide, 
compared to white Americans. For both black and white Americans, the majority of 
PYLL due to homicide are firearm-related. Yet, homicide research is dramatically 
underrepresented in public health research investments in terms of grant funding 
and publications, despite available public health training opportunities. If 
left unchecked, the observed disproportionate distribution of investments in 
public health resources threatens to perpetuate a system that disadvantages 
black Americans.

GOAL OF THE STUDY: Environmental risk factors are of great importance for public 
health with a considerable but often unused potential for prevention. However, 
knowledge about the complex associations between the environment and health 
effects is limited for some risk factors. A concept, which is using the existing 
evidence on associations between the impact of environmental factors and health 
effects, is the environmental burden of disease (EBD) concept. The aim of this 
article is to present the quantification method of the EBD concept and to 
discuss the advantages and its points of criticism.
METHODS: The EBD concept combines morbidity and mortality data in a single 
measure (Disability-Adjusted Life Year, DALY) to enable a comparative 
description of the burden of disease. Life years are used as measurement unit. 
The environmental share of the total DALYs is quantified by using the 
attributable fraction.
RESULTS: Despite its increasing application especially in the international 
context, the method is still criticized, because by summarizing the complex 
construct of health in one single measurement unit, much important information 
about quality of life is lost. A further criticism refers to partly arbitrarily 
set social value choices. Additionally, missing or insufficient data can limit 
the quality and validity of EBD estimations.
CONCLUSION: A scientific discourse is needed to decide to what extent the EBD 
approach can and should be used in Germany.

Publisher: ZIEL DER STUDIE: Umweltrisikofaktoren haben häufig eine hohe 
gesundheitliche Relevanz mit einem großen und z. T. nicht ausreichend genutzten 
Präventionspotenzial. Das Wissen über die komplexen Wirkungszusammenhänge 
zwischen Umwelt und Gesundheit ist für einige Umweltrisikofaktoren begrenzt. Ein 
Instrument, das bestehende Evidenz nutzt, um die gesundheitlichen Auswirkungen 
für eine Bevölkerung oder Bevölkerungsgruppe zu quantifizieren, ist das Konzept 
der umweltbedingten Krankheitslast (Environmental Burden of Disease, EBD). Ziel 
des Beitrages ist es, das Konzept der umweltbedingten Krankheitslast 
vorzustellen sowie den Nutzen aber auch die Kritikpunkte zu benennen.
METHODIK: EBD fasst Morbiditäts- und Mortalitätsdaten in einem Summenmaß, dem 
Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY), zusammen und ermöglicht eine vergleichende 
Darstellung von Krankheitslasten. Hierfür werden Lebensjahre als Einheit 
genutzt. Mithilfe des attributablen Anteils kann ermittelt werden, welcher 
Anteil der Gesamtkrankheitslast auf umweltbedingte Risikofaktoren zurückzuführen 
ist.
ERGEBNISSE: Das EBD-Konzept wird, trotz seiner zunehmenden Anwendung im 
internationalen Raum, häufig kritisch diskutiert, da die Einschränkung des 
mehrdimensionalen Konstrukts Gesundheit in einer Maßzahl zusammengefasst wird. 
Weitere Kritik bezieht sich auf die sozialen und normativen Konventionen, die 
das Konzept beinhaltet. Fehlende oder unzureichende Eingangsdaten können zudem 
die Qualität und Aussagekraft von EBD-Schätzungen limitieren.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Es bedarf eines wissenschaftlichen Diskurses, in welchem 
Rahmen das Konzept in Deutschland genutzt werden kann und sollte.

BACKGROUND: Subjective expectations regarding future health may influence 
patients' judgement of current health and treatment effects, as well as 
adherence to therapies in chronic diseases. We aimed to explore subjective 
expectations on longevity and future health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of 
patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treated with antiVEGF 
injections and analyse the influencing factors.
METHODS: Consecutive AMD patients in two ophthalmology centres were included. 
Demographics, clinical characteristics and informal care utilisation were 
recorded. Current health was evaluated by the EQ-5D generic health status 
questionnaire and time trade-off (TTO) methods. Happiness was measured on a 
visual analogue scale (VAS). Subjective life-expectancy and expected EQ-5D 
status at ages 70, 80 and 90 were surveyed. T-test was applied to compare 
subgroups and Pearson correlations were performed to analyse relationships 
between variables.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty two patients were involved (females 62%) with a mean 
(SD) age of 75.2 (7.9) years and disease duration of 2.9 (2.5) years. The 
majority were in AREDS-4 state, the better eye's ETDRS was 64.7 (15.4). EQ-5D 
and TTO revealed moderate deterioration of health (0.66 vs. 0.72, p = 0.131), 
happiness VAS was 6.3 (2.2). Correlation between EQ-5D and ETDRS was moderate 
(R = 0.242, p < 0.05) and having both versus one eye in AREDS-4 resulted lower 
TTO (0.68 vs. 0.83; p = 0.013). Subjective life-expectancy did not differ 
significantly from statistical life-expectancy and had no significant impact on 
TTO. The self-estimated mean EQ-5D score was 0.60, 0.40 and 0.24 for ages 70, 80 
and 90 which is lower than the population norm of age-groups 65-74, 75-84 and 
85+ (0.77, 0.63 and 0.63, respectively). Age, gender, current EQ-5D, need for 
informal care and happiness were deterministic factors of subjective health 
expectations.
CONCLUSION: AMD patients with antiVEGF treatment have comparable HRQOL as the 
age-matched general public but expect a more severe deterioration of health with 
age. Older patients with worse HRQOL have worse subjective expectations. 
Exploring patients' health expectations provides an opportunity for 
ophthalmologists to correct misperceptions and improve the quality of AMD care. 
Further studies should provide evidences on the relationship between subjective 
expectations and actual health outcomes, and on its impact on patients' 
AMD-specific health behaviour.

BACKGROUND: It is well documented that obesity is strongly associated with 
mortality and morbidity, but less is known about its impact on functional status 
and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The purpose of this study was to 
calculate the impact of the Body Mass Index (BMI) on the HRQOL of the Spanish 
adult population, with special emphasis on BMI ≥ 35.
METHODS: We used the Spanish National Health Survey (SNHS) 2011-2012 to assess 
the statistical association between HRQOL, measured through the EuroQol-5D-5L 
questionnaire, and the BMI. We conducted linear regression analysis for the 
EuroQol-5D-5L Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and probit regressions for each of the 
five dimensions of the EuroQol-5D-5L.
RESULTS: Self-perceived problems in the five dimensions of the EuroQol-5D-5L 
increased along the BMI, especially in the mobility and pain/discomfort 
dimensions. Having a BMI ≥ 35 reduced HRQOL even in the absence of chronic 
diseases. After controlling for comorbidities, severe obesity decreased the VAS 
score by an average of 1.9 points and increased the probability of reporting any 
HRQOL problem in mobility (11.8%), self-care (2.2%), usual activities (4.3%) and 
pain/discomfort (7.4%). No association was found between obesity and mental 
problems. All the parameters analysed suggest that HRQOL in women and people 
aged 65 years and over was significantly worse than average.
CONCLUSIONS: BMI is an explanatory factor of self-perceived quality of life. 
Obesity is associated with a worse HRQOL, especially in women and people aged 
over 64 years. These results may be useful for designing prevention or treatment 
health policies to target obesity among the Spanish population.

BACKGROUND: ParentCorps is a family-centered enhancement to pre-kindergarten 
programming in elementary schools and early education centers. When implemented 
in high-poverty, urban elementary schools serving primarily Black and Latino 
children, it has been found to yield benefits in childhood across domains of 
academic achievement, behavior problems, and obesity. However, its long-term 
cost-effectiveness is unknown.
METHODS: We determined the cost-effectiveness of ParentCorps in high-poverty, 
urban schools using a Markov Model projecting the long-term impact of 
ParentCorps compared to standard pre-kindergarten programming. We measured costs 
and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) resulting from the development of three 
disease states (i.e., drug abuse, obesity, and diabetes); from the health 
sequelae of these disease states; from graduation from high school; from 
interaction with the judiciary system; and opportunity costs of unemployment 
with a lifetime time horizon. The model was built, and analyses were performed 
in 2015-2016.
RESULTS: ParentCorps was estimated to save $4387 per individual and increase 
each individual's quality adjusted life expectancy by 0.27 QALYs. These benefits 
were primarily due to the impact of ParentCorps on childhood obesity and the 
subsequent predicted prevention of diabetes, and ParentCorps' impact on 
childhood behavior problems and the subsequent predicted prevention of 
interaction with the judiciary system and unemployment. Results were robust on 
sensitivity analyses, with ParentCorps remaining cost saving and health 
generating under nearly all assumptions, except when schools had very small 
pre-kindergarten programs.
CONCLUSIONS: Effective family-centered interventions early in life such as 
ParentCorps that impact academic, behavioral and health outcomes among children 
attending high-poverty, urban schools have the potential to result in 
longer-term health benefits and substantial cost savings.

American trypanosomiasis, or Chagas disease, is a growing public health problem 
in Panama, and further forest degradation due to human population growth is 
expected to worsen the situation. Most people infected with the parasite 
Trypanosoma cruzi are silently ill, and their life expectancy is severely 
compromised, which contributes to further deterioration of living conditions in 
endemic regions. Here, we review the outcomes of nearly 100 years of ecological 
and epidemiological investigation about Chagas disease in Panama, in an attempt 
to highlight progress, identify needs, and re-orient future efforts. Rhodnius 
pallescens and Triatoma dimidiata are both primary vectors of T. cruzi in 
Panama, but R. pallescens seems more efficient in human-altered forest 
ecosystems due to a greater degree of association with Attalea butyracea. In 
contrast, T. dimidiata transmits T. cruzi efficiently under more sylvatic 
conditions (e.g. settlements inside old-growth or secondary forest patches), 
where its populations reach considerable numbers irrespective of the absence of 
A. butyracea. A trend of increasing forest degradation, suburbanization, and 
development of tourism in Panama favoring the establishment of A. butyracea and 
other palm tree species (Acrocomia sp.) suggests that a colonist species like R. 
pallescens will continue to play a more prominent role in the transmission of T. 
cruzi than a forest specialist like T. dimidiata. However, studies about the 
taxonomic status and ecology of these vectors are still needed in Panama to 
address their transmission potential fully. The implementation of an active 
surveillance system and education programs could greatly minimize the risk of 
Chagas disease transmission in Panama, preventing fatal infections in children 
from endemic areas.

BACKGROUND: Acute human African trypanosomiasis (rHAT) caused by Trypanosoma 
brucei rhodesiense is associated with high mortality and is fatal if left 
untreated. Only a few studies have examined the psychological, social and 
economic impacts of rHAT. In this study, mixed qualitative and quantitative 
research methods were used to evaluate the socio-economic impacts of rHAT in 
Mambwe, Rufunsa, Mpika and Chama Districts of Zambia.
METHODS: Individuals diagnosed with rHAT from 2004 to 2014 were traced using 
hospital records and discussions with communities. Either they, or their 
families, were interviewed using a structured questionnaire and focus group 
discussions were conducted with affected communities. The burden of the disease 
was investigated using disability adjusted life years (DALYs), with and without 
discounting and age-weighting. The impact of long-term disabilities on the rHAT 
burden was also investigated.
RESULTS: Sixty four cases were identified in the study. The majority were 
identified in second stage, and the mortality rate was high (12.5%). The total 
number of DALYs was 285 without discounting or age-weighting. When long-term 
disabilities were included this estimate increased by 50% to 462. The proportion 
of years lived with disability (YLD) increased from 6.4% to 37% of the 
undiscounted and un-age-weighted DALY total. When a more active surveillance 
method was applied in 2013-2014 the cases identified increased dramatically, 
suggesting a high level of under-reporting. Similarly, the proportion of females 
increased substantially, indicating that passive surveillance may be especially 
failing this group. An average of 4.9 months of productive time was lost per 
patient as a consequence of infection. The health consequences included pain, 
amnesia and physical disability. The social consequences included stigma, 
dropping out of education, loss of friends and self-esteem. Results obtained 
from focus group discussions revealed misconceptions among community members 
which could be attributed to lack of knowledge about rHAT.
CONCLUSIONS: The social and economic impact of rHAT on rural households and 
communities is substantial. Improved surveillance and strengthening of local 
medical services are needed for early and accurate diagnosis. Disease prevention 
should be prioritised in communities at risk of rHAT, and interventions put in 
place to prevent zoonotic disease spill over from domestic animals and wildlife. 
Supportive measures to mitigate the long-term effects of disability due to rHAT 
are needed.

INTRODUCTION: Lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to increased prostate 
volume are associated with ageing and are becoming more prevalent due to 
increased life expectancy. We present our experience with transperitoneal 
laparoscopic adenomectomy for the management of bladder outlet obstruction 
caused by benign prostatic enlargement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients who 
underwent laparoscopic adenomectomy between 2005 and 2015. We recorded age, 
maximum flow and postvoid residual urine (preoperative and postoperative), 
surgical time, operative bleeding, weight and pathology, complications and 
duration of catheterisation and hospitalisation.
RESULTS: We included 80 patients with a mean age of 70 years. The mean 
preoperative and postoperative Qmax was 8.21mL/s and 22.52mL/s, respectively. 
The mean preoperative and postoperative postvoid residual urine was 91.4mL and 
14.2mL, respectively. The mean surgical time was 137.7min. Conversion to open 
surgery was necessary in one case due to intestinal injury. The mean 
intraoperative bleeding was 227.6mL. The mean hospital stay was 5.46 days, and 
the catheterisation time was 4.86 days. There were 13 complications, which were 
recorded according to the Clavien-Dindo system, 3 of which were severe. The mean 
weight of the surgical specimen was 80.02g. Pathology showed benign hyperplasia 
in 75 cases and prostate cancer in the remaining 5.
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic adenomectomy is a safe, reproducible technique with the 
same functional results as open surgery. Our series shows that this approach is 
useful and safe and has a low rate of complications.

OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord ischemia (SCI) is a devastating complication after 
branched or fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (B/FEVAR) for 
thoracoabdominal aortic disease. The purpose of this analysis was to describe 
the impact of a bundled clinical care protocol designed to reduce the risk of 
SCI in this population of patients.
METHODS: A bundled SCI prevention protocol including cerebrospinal fluid 
drainage, blood pressure parameters, transfusion goals, and pharmacologic 
adjuncts (steroids, naloxone) was initiated in May 2015. Before that date, 
portions of the protocol (cerebrospinal fluid drainage in particular) were used 
in an informal fashion in patients perceived to be at high risk. B/FEVAR cases 
completed from January 2012 to May 2016 were reviewed, and outcomes before (n = 
223) and after (n = 70) SCI bundle application were compared. The primary end 
point was the incidence of SCI events. Secondary end points included length of 
stay, complications, and survival. High-risk patients for SCI were defined as 
those undergoing B/FEVAR resulting in aortic coverage equivalent to open 
Crawford extent I to III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repair. 
Survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis.
RESULTS: Postprotocol patients were more likely to be older (75 ± 7 vs 72 ± 
8 years; P = .03), to have an American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 
designation (94% vs 81%; P = .04), and to be treated for TAAA (67% vs 56%; P = 
.004). Postprotocol pre-emptive spinal drain use was greater in high-risk 
patients (100% vs 87%; P = .04) but significantly decreased in lower 
risk patients (suprarenal aneurysm or extent IV TAAA: 5% after protocol 
implementation vs 21% before protocol implementation; P = .04). Rates of any SCI 
before and after implementation of the bundled protocol were 13% (n = 29 of 223) 
and 3% (n = 2 of 70; P = .007), respectively. In comparing high-risk patients, 
protocol use resulted in an even more significant reduction in SCI rate (19% [28 
of 144] vs 4% [2 of 50]; P = .004). Postoperative morbidity (41% vs 33%; P = .2) 
and 30-day mortality (5% vs 1%; P = .3) were not different between groups. 
However, patients treated on protocol had significantly improved 1-year survival 
(99% ± 1% after protocol implementation vs 90% ± 2% before protocol 
implementation; log-rank, P = .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a bundled multimodal protocol may significantly 
reduce risk of SCI after B/FEVAR, with the greatest risk reduction occurring in 
the most vulnerable patients. Interestingly, reduction in SCI risk was 
associated with improvement in 1-year survival.

Faulty BRCA1, BRCA2 genes: how poor is the prognosis?

Curie - Paris VI, Paris, France. Electronic address: john.oquigley@upmc.fr.

We take a critical look at the meaning behind the number 87% given to 
25-year-old Sophie, a BRCA1 and BRCA2 carrier. Sophie has been told she has an 
87% chance of getting breast cancer. She is contemplating a preventive double 
mastectomy after genetic counseling and her physician's advice. Some 92% of 
British general practitioners are in favor of prophylactic mastectomy as a 
treatment option for women similar to Sophie. The treatment decision results, to 
a very large extent, from the size of the number (87%) alone. The central 
argument of this study is that physicians, their patients, and the public need a 
much better understanding on what is meant by probability estimates of 0.87. The 
figure on its own does not tell us much, and we need to be very cautious in its 
interpretation. It is important to know that the very same genetic and 
statistical models, and observed data, resulting in a verdict of an 87% lifetime 
chance of getting breast cancer, based on BRCA1, BRCA2, and familial 
information, simultaneously show Sophie to have a greater than 99% chance of 
surviving beyond the next 5 years cancer free. If she succeeds-the chances are 
overwhelmingly in her favor-then, given that fact, her chances of surviving a 
further 5 years are once again greater than 98%. Her chances of not dying due to 
breast cancer over the next 20 years are greater than 97%, a percentage that 
changes little if instead of 20 we write the number 30. In a word, although the 
diagnosis of a faulty BRAC gene may be a disappointment, there is no immediate 
peril and no need for undue alarm. Sophie, and her primary care providers, can 
carefully consider her options without feeling that they are under any kind of 
acute pressure. Whatever the threat, it is not an imminent one.

Healthy grandparenthood represents the period of overlap during which 
grandparents and grandchildren can build relationships, and grandparents can 
make intergenerational transfers to younger kin. The health of grandparents has 
important implications for upward and downward intergenerational transfers 
within kinship networks in aging societies. Although the length of 
grandparenthood is determined by fertility and mortality patterns, the amount of 
time spent as a healthy grandparent is also affected by morbidity. In this 
study, we estimate the length of healthy grandparenthood for the first time. 
Using U.S. and Canadian data, we examine changes in the length of healthy 
grandparenthood during years when grandparenthood was postponed, health 
improved, and mortality declined. We also examine variation in healthy 
grandparenthood by education and race/ethnicity within the United States. Our 
findings show that the period of healthy grandparenthood is becoming longer 
because of improvements in health and mortality, which more than offset delays 
in grandparenthood. Important variation exists within the United States by 
race/ethnicity and education, which has important implications for family 
relationships and transfers.

A key concern about population aging is the decline in the size of the 
economically active population. Working longer is a potential remedy. However, 
little is known about the length of working life and how it relates to 
macroeconomic conditions. We use the U.S. Health and Retirement Study for 
1992-2011 and multistate life tables to analyze working life expectancy at age 
50 and study the impact of the Great Recession in 2007-2009. Despite declines of 
one to two years following the recession, in 2008-2011, American men aged 50 
still spent 13 years, or two-fifths of their remaining life, working; American 
women of the same age spent 11 years, or one-third of their remaining life, in 
employment. Although educational differences in working life expectancy have 
been stable since the mid-1990s, racial differences started changing after the 
onset of the Great Recession. Our results show that although Americans generally 
work longer than people in other countries, considerable subpopulation 
heterogeneity exists. We also find that the time trends are fluctuating, which 
may prove troublesome as the population ages. Policies targeting the weakest 
performing groups may be needed to increase the total population trends.

Reliable subnational mortality estimates are essential in the study of health 
inequalities within a country. One of the difficulties in producing such 
estimates is the presence of small populations among which the stochastic 
variation in death counts is relatively high, and thus the underlying mortality 
levels are unclear. We present a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate 
mortality at the subnational level. The model builds on characteristic age 
patterns in mortality curves, which are constructed using principal components 
from a set of reference mortality curves. Information on mortality rates are 
pooled across geographic space and are smoothed over time. Testing of the model 
shows reasonable estimates and uncertainty levels when it is applied both to 
simulated data that mimic U.S. counties and to real data for French 
départements. The model estimates have direct applications to the study of 
subregional health patterns and disparities.

OBJECTIVES: This study examines the cost-effectiveness of the OPTI-SCRIPT 
intervention on potentially inappropriate prescribing in primary care.
METHODS: Economic evaluation, using incremental cost-effectiveness and cost 
utility analyses, conducted alongside a cluster randomized controlled trial of 
twenty-one general practices and 196 patients, to compare a multifaceted 
intervention with usual practice in primary care in Ireland. Potentially 
inappropriate prescriptions (PIPs) were determined by a pharmacist. Incremental 
costs, PIPs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at 12-month follow-up were 
estimated using multilevel regression. Uncertainty was explored using 
cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
RESULTS: The intervention was associated with a nonsignificant mean cost 
increase of €407 (95 percent CIs, -357-1170), a significant mean reduction in 
PIPs of 0.379 (95 percent CI, 0.092-0.666), and a nonsignificant mean increase 
in QALYs of 0.013 (95 percent CIs, -0.016-0.042). The incremental cost per PIP 
avoided was €1,269 (95 percent CI, -1400-6302) and the incremental cost per QALY 
gained was €30,535 (95 percent CI, -334,846-289,498). The probability of the 
intervention being cost-effective was 0.602 at a threshold value of €45,000 per 
QALY gained and was at least 0.845 at threshold values of €2,500 per PIP avoided 
and higher.
CONCLUSIONS: While the OPTI-SCRIPT intervention was effective in reducing 
potentially inappropriate prescribing in primary care in Ireland, our findings 
highlight the uncertainty with respect to its cost-effectiveness. Further 
studies are required to explore the health and economic implications of 
interventions targeting potentially inappropriate prescribing.

University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease is common. This study 
sought to assess whether the postoperative management should be based on 
biological therapy alone or combined with thiopurines and whether the therapy 
should be started immediately after surgery or guided by either endoscopic or 
clinical recurrence.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate expected health outcomes in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs in Canadian dollars (CAD$) accrued 
by hypothetical patients with high recurrence risk after ileocolic resection. 
Eight strategies of postoperative management were evaluated. A lifetime time 
horizon, an annual discount rate of 5%, a societal perspective, and a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of 50,000 CAD$/QALY were assumed. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. The model was validated 
against randomized trials and historical cohorts.
RESULTS: Three strategies dominated the others: endoscopy-guided full step-up 
therapy (14.80 QALYs, CAD$ 462,180), thiopurines immediately post-surgery plus 
endoscopy-guided biological step-up therapy (14.89 QALYs, CAD$ 464,099) and 
combination therapy immediately post-surgery (14.94 QALYs, CAD$ 483,685). The 
second strategy was the most cost-effective, assuming a cost-effectiveness 
threshold of 50,000 CAD$/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that 
the second strategy has the highest probability of being the optimal alternative 
in all comparisons at cost-effectiveness thresholds from 30,000 to 100,000 
CAD$/QALY. The strategies guided only by clinical recurrence and those using 
biologics alone were dominated.
CONCLUSIONS: According to this decision analysis, thiopurines immediately after 
surgery and addition of biologics guided by endoscopic recurrence is the optimal 
strategy of postoperative management in patients with Crohn's disease with high 
risk of recurrence (see Video Abstract, Supplemental Digital Content 1, 
http://links.lww.com/IBD/B654).

BACKGROUND: Mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin is the cornerstone of 
efforts to eliminate human onchocerciasis by 2020 or 2025. The feasibility of 
elimination crucially depends on the effects of multiple ivermectin doses on 
Onchocerca volvulus. A single ivermectin (standard) dose clears the 
skin-dwelling microfilarial progeny of adult worms (macrofilariae) and 
temporarily impedes the release of such progeny by female macrofilariae, but a 
macrofilaricidal effect has been deemed minimal. Multiple doses of ivermectin 
may cumulatively and permanently reduce the fertility and shorten the lifespan 
of adult females. However, rigorous quantification of these effects necessitates 
interrogating longitudinal data on macrofilariae with suitably powerful 
analytical techniques.
METHODS: Using a novel mathematical modeling approach, we analyzed, at an 
individual participant level, longitudinal data on viability and fertility of 
female worms from the single most comprehensive multiple-dose clinical trial of 
ivermectin, comparing 3-monthly with annual treatments administered for 3 years 
in Cameroon.
RESULTS: Multiple doses of ivermectin have a partial macrofilaricidal and a 
modest permanent sterilizing effect after 4 or more consecutive treatments, even 
at routine MDA doses (150 µg/kg) and frequencies (annual). The life expectancy 
of adult O. volvulus is reduced by approximately 50% and 70% after 3 years of 
annual or 3-monthly (quarterly) exposures to ivermectin.
CONCLUSIONS: Our quantification of macrofilaricidal and sterilizing effects of 
ivermectin should be incorporated into transmission models to inform 
onchocerciasis elimination efforts in Africa and residual foci in Latin America. 
It also provides a framework to assess macrofilaricidal candidate drugs 
currently under development.

BACKGROUND: High hepatitis C virus (HCV) rates have been reported in young 
people who inject drugs (PWID). We evaluated the clinical benefit and 
cost-effectiveness of testing among youth seen in communities with a high 
overall number of reported HCV cases.
METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model to project quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), costs (2016 US$), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) of 9 strategies for 1-time testing among 15- to 30-year-olds seen at 
urban community health centers. Strategies differed in 3 ways: targeted vs 
routine testing, rapid finger stick vs standard venipuncture, and ordered by 
physician vs by counselor/tester using standing orders. We performed
