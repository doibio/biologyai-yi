PURPOSE: Acetabular deficiencies in young patients can be restored in several 
ways during total hip arthroplasty. Currently, cementless cups are most 
frequently used. Impaction bone grafting of acetabular defects is a more 
biological approach, but is it cost-effective in young patients on the long 
term?
METHODS: We designed a decision model for a cost-utility analysis of a cemented 
cup with acetabular impaction bone grafting versus an uncemented cup, in terms 
of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for the young adult with 
acetabular bone deficiency, in need for a primary total hip arthroplasty. 
Outcome probabilities and effectiveness were derived from the Radboud University 
Nijmegen Medical Centre and the Norwegian Hip Register. Multiple sensitivity 
analyses were used to assess the contribution of the included variables in the 
model's outcome.
RESULTS: Cemented cups with impaction bone grafting were more cost-effective 
compared to the uncemented option in terms of costs per QALY. A scenario 
suggesting equal primary survival rates of both cemented and uncemented cups 
still showed an effect gain of the cemented cup with impaction bone grafting, 
but at higher costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on this model, the first choice of treatment of the 
acetabular bone deficient osteoarthritic hip in a young patient is 
reconstruction with impaction bone grafting and a cemented cup.

Skin aging is determined by a combination of endogenous and environmental 
influences, including epigenetic, posttranslational, microbial, and lifestyle 
factors. In particular genetic changes, programmed or not, play a pivotal role 
and understanding of these complex mechanisms may contribute to the prevention 
of age-related diseases and extension of healthy lifespan. In this article, new 
knowledge about genes and biological processes that can significantly affect 
skin homeostasis in old age and can lead to the typical morphological and 
physiological characteristics of aging skin are summarized.

Survival and Reproductive Strategies in Two-Spotted Spider Mites: Demographic 
Analysis of Arrhenotokous Parthenogenesis of Tetranychus urticae (Acari: 
Tetranychidae).

Tuan SJ, Lin YH, Yang CM, Atlihan R, Saska P, Chi H.

Tetranychus urticae Koch is a cosmopolitan pest whose rapid developmental rate 
enables it to produce colonies of thousands of individuals within a short time 
period. When a solitary virgin female colonizes a new host plant, it is capable 
of producing male offspring through the arrhenotokous parthenogenesis; once her 
sons mature, oedipal mating occurs and the female will produce bisexual 
offspring. To analyze the effect of arrhenotokous reproduction on population 
growth, we devised and compared separate life tables for arrhenotokous and 
bisexual populations of T. urticae using the age-stage, two-sex life table 
theory. For the cohort with bisexual reproduction, the intrinsic rate of 
increase (r), finite rate (λ), net reproductive rate (R0), and mean generation 
time (T) were 0.2736 d(−1), 1.3146 d(−1), 44.66 offspring, and 13.89 d, 
respectively. Because only male eggs were produced during the first 8 d of the 
oviposition period and the cohort would soon begin bisexual reproduction, it 
would be theoretically wrong to calculate the population parameters using the 
survival rate and fecundity of an arrhenotokous cohort. We demonstrated that the 
effect of arrhenotokous reproduction could be accurately described and evaluated 
using the age-stage, two-sex life table. We also used population projection 
based on life table data, quantitatively showing the effect that arrhenotokous 
reproduction has on the growth potential and management of T. urticae.

Suppression of Lipid Accumulation.

Japan has been known as a healthy country since its life expectancy became among 
the highest in the world in the 1980s. The influence of the Japanese diet is one 
of the factors explaining Japan's high life expectancy. Our recent study that 
fed representative freeze-dried and powdered Japanese diets from 1960, 1975, 
1990, and 2005 based on National Health and Nutrition Research to mice showed 
the 1975 Japanese diet exhibited the strongest visceral fat accumulation 
suppression and overall health benefits. However, it is unclear why. We 
investigated the effects of the fatty acid composition in Japanese diets on 
visceral fat accumulation in mice. ICR mice were fed diets replicating the fatty 
acid composition and macronutrient ratios of Japanese diets from 1960, 1975, 
1990, and 2005 for four weeks. The 1975 diet suppressed visceral fat 
accumulation and adipocyte hypertrophy. DNA microarray analysis showed the 1975 
diet suppressed Acyl-CoA synthetase and prostaglandin D2 synthase mRNA 
expressions in white adipose tissue. As the effects of the 1975 diet are likely 
due to differences in fatty acid intake and/or composition, we investigated test 
diets that replicated only the fatty acid composition of Japanese diets. There 
were no significant differences in visceral fat mass. Therefore, both the 
quality and quantity of fatty acids are involved in the anti-obesity effects of 
the 1975 Japanese diet.

BACKGROUND: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an incurable, cholestatic 
liver disease often coincident with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
AIMS: To evaluate the impact of liver disease and IBD on health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL) in PSC.
METHODS: A mixed-methods, cross-sectional study was performed at a tertiary 
center. Short Form-36 (SF-36) scores were compared between PSC, Canadian 
normative data, and disease controls. Disease-specific instruments scores 
[PBC-40, Short IBD questionnaire, Liver Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire 
(LDQOL)] were compared between PSC and disease controls. Multivariable 
regression identified factors independently associated with final SF-36 
component scores. Qualitative evaluation of patient questionnaires was performed 
using a content analysis framework.
RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-two surveys were completed (99 PSC, 26 primary 
biliary cirrhosis, 16 non-autoimmune cholestatic liver disease, and 21 IBD). PSC 
patients had significantly lower SF-36 scores than Canadian controls, but 
similar scores to disease controls. LDQOL most accurately predicted HRQoL. 
Factors negatively associated with physical HRQoL included shorter IBD duration, 
liver disease symptoms, and decompensated cirrhosis. Mental HRQoL was influenced 
by liver disease and IBD symptoms, pruritus, social isolation, and depression. 
Nearly 75 % expressed existential anxiety regarding disease progression and 
diminished life expectancy, with 25 % disclosing social isolation.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PSC have significantly lower HRQoL than healthy 
controls. Both symptoms of IBD and chronic liver disease impact HRQoL in 
patients with PSC, which lead to significant psychologic burden that is 
expressed by existential anxieties and social isolation. A PSC-specific HRQoL 
tool is critical to adequately quantify the distinct impact of IBD and 
cholestatic liver disease.

BACKGROUND: Overall survival (OS) and other important clinical trial end-points 
seem increasingly more elusive in supporting rapid and efficient incorporation 
of innovative cancer drugs in clinical practice. This study proposes a clinical 
trial based pharmacoeconomic framework to assess the therapeutic and economic 
value of ruxolitinib in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis.
METHODS: Individual patient level 144 week follow-up data from the COMFORT-II 
trial was used to account for the crossover effect on overall survival. Lifetime 
treatment benefits and costs were estimated considering detailed patterns of 
both ruxolitinib dose adjustments and blood transfusion needs.
RESULTS: The authors estimate a 3.3 years increment in life expectancy 
(HR = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.17-0.55; p-value <0.001) and an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of €40,000 per life year gained with the use of 
ruxolitinib.
CONCLUSION: This study also demonstrates how valuable information from clinical 
trials can be used to support informed decisions about the early incorporation 
of innovative drugs.

Hochschule Hannover, Hannover.

OBJECTIVE: The number of implantation of cochlear implants has steadily risen in 
recent years. Reasons for this are an extension of indication criteria, 
demographic change, increased quality of life needs and greater acceptance. The 
consequences are rising expenditure for statutory health insurance (SHI) for 
cochlear implantation. A detailed calculation of lifetime costs from SHI's 
perspective for postlingually deafened adolescents and adults is essential in 
estimating future cost developments.
METHODS: Calculations are based on accounting data from the Hannover Medical 
School. With regard to further life expectancy, average costs of preoperative 
diagnosis, surgery, rehabilitation, follow-ups, processor upgrades and 
electrical maintenance were discounted to their present value at age of 
implantation.
RESULTS: There is an inverse relation between cost of unilateral cochlear 
implantation and age of initial implantation. From SHI's perspective, the 
intervention costs between 36,001 and 68,970 € ($ 42,504-$ 81,429). The largest 
cost components are initial implantation and processor upgrades.
CONCLUSION: Compared to the UK the cost of cochlear implantation in Germany 
seems to be significantly lower. In particular the costs of, rehabilitation and 
maintenance in Germany cause only a small percentage of total costs. Also, the 
costs during the first year of treatment seem comparatively low. With regard to 
future spending of SHI due to implant innovations and associated extension of 
indication, increasing cost may be suspected.

PURPOSE: Intake of specific nutrients has been linked to mental states and 
various indices of cognitive performance although the effects are often subtle 
and difficult to interpret. Measurement of so-called objective variables (e.g. 
reaction times) is often considered to be the gold standard for assessing 
outcomes in this field of research. It can, however, be argued that data on 
subjective experience (e.g. mood) are also important and may enrich existing 
objective data. The aim of this review is to evaluate methods for measuring 
mental performance and mood, considering the definition of subjective mood and 
the validity of measures of subjective experience.
METHODS: A multi-stakeholder expert group was invited by ILSI Europe to come to 
a consensus around the utility of objective and subjective measurement in this 
field, which forms the basis of the paper. Therefore, the present review 
reflects a succinct overview of the science but is not intended to be a 
systematic review.
RESULTS: The proposed approach extends the traditional methodology using 
standard 'objective' measurements to also include the consumers' subjective 
experiences in relation to food. Specific recommendations include 1) using 
contemporary methods to capture transient mood states; 2) using sufficiently 
sensitive measures to capture effects of nutritional intervention; 3) 
considering the possibility that subjective and objective responses will occur 
over different time frames; and 4) recognition of the importance of expectancy 
and placebo effects for subjective measures.
CONCLUSIONS: The consensus reached was that the most informative approach should 
involve collection and consideration of both objective and subjective data.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasian 
populations with respiratory, gastrointestinal and endocrine manifestations. 
Thanks to recent advances in medical therapies and infection control, life 
expectancy of a patient with CF has significantly increased from less than 5 
years in the mid-1900s to almost 50 years nowadays. However, as CF patients are 
living longer, multimorbidity and Hyperpharmacotherapy are becoming more common. 
This case illustrates a cascade of problems that ensued from medication 
side-effects, highlighting the increasing challenge of managing an ageing CF 
population.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide and 
its incidence is generally increasing. In 2012, it was the second most common 
cancer in the world. It is necessary to obtain information on incidence and 
mortality for health planning. This study aimed to investigate the relationship 
between the human development index (HDI), and the incidence and mortality rates 
of breast cancer in the world in 2012.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This ecologic study concerns incidence rate and 
standardized mortality rates of the cancer from GLOBOCAN in 2012, and HDI and 
its components extracted from the global bank site. Data were analyzed using 
correlation tests and regression with SPSS software (version 15).
RESULTS: Among the six regions of WHO, the highest breast cancer incidence rate 
(67.6) was observed in the PAHO, and the lowest incidence rate was 27.8 for 
SEARO. There was a direct, strong, and meaningful correlation between the 
standardized incidence rate and HDI (r=0.725, p≤0.001). Pearson correlation test 
showed that there was a significant correlation between age-specific incidence 
rate (ASIR) and components of the HDI (life expectancy at birth, mean years of 
schooling, and GNP). On the other, a non-significant relationship was observed 
between ASIR and HDI overall (r=0.091, p=0.241). In total, a significant 
relationship was not found between age-specific mortality rate (ASMR) and 
components of HDI.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant positive correlations exist between ASIR and components 
of the HDI. Socioeconomic status is directly related to the stage of the cancer 
and patient's survival. With increasing the incidence rate of the cancer, 
mortality rate from the cancer does not necessariloy increase. This may be due 
to more early detection and treatment in developed that developing countries. It 
is necessary to increase awareness of risk factors and early detection in the 
latter.

Sciences, University of Vigo, Spain (GR-F, IMdO).

OBJECTIVE: As myofascial release therapy is currently under development, the 
objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of myofascial release 
therapy with manual therapy for treating occupational mechanical neck pain.
DESIGN: A randomized, single-blind parallel group study was developed. The 
sample (n = 59) was divided into GI, treated with manual therapy, and GII, 
treated with myofascial release therapy. Variables studied were intensity of 
neck pain, cervical disability, quality of life, craniovertebral angle, and 
ranges of cervical motion.
RESULTS: At five sessions, clinical significance was observed in both groups for 
all the variables studied, except for flexion in GI. At this time point, an 
intergroup statistical difference was observed, which showed that GII had better 
craniovertebral angle (P = 0.014), flexion (P = 0.021), extension (P = 0.003), 
right side bending (P = 0.001), and right rotation (P = 0.031). A comparative 
analysis between therapies after intervention showed statistical differences 
indicating that GII had better craniovertebral angle (P = 0.000), right (P = 
0.000) and left (P = 0.009) side bending, right (P = 0.024) and left (P = 0.046) 
rotations, and quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of occupational mechanical neck pain by myofascial 
release therapy seems to be more effective than manual therapy for correcting 
the advanced position of the head, recovering range of motion in side bending 
and rotation, and improving quality of life.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of glioma, with life 
expectancy of around 2 years after diagnosis, due to recidivism and to the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) limiting the amount of drugs which reach the residual 
malignant cells, thus contributing to the failure of chemotherapies. To bypass 
the obstacles imposed by the BBB, we investigated the use of nanotechnologies 
combined with radiotherapy, as a potential therapeutic strategy for GBM. We used 
poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (PNP) conjugated to 
chlorotoxin (CTX), a peptide reported to bind selectively to glioma cells. 
Silver nanoparticles were entrapped inside the functionalized nanoparticles 
(Ag-PNP-CTX), to allow detection and quantification of the cellular uptake by 
confocal microscopy, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro experiments performed 
with different human glioblastoma cell lines showed higher cytoplasmic uptake of 
Ag-PNP-CTX, with respect to nonfunctionalized nanoparticles. In vivo experiments 
showed that Ag-NP-CTX efficiently targets the tumor, but are scarcely effective 
in crossing the blood brain barrier in the healthy brain, where dispersed 
metastatic cells are present. We show here that single whole brain X-ray 
irradiation, performed 20 h before nanoparticle injection, enhances the 
expression of the CTX targets, MMP-2 and ClC-3, and, through BBB 
permeabilization, potently increases the amount of internalized Ag-PNP-CTX even 
in dispersed cells, and generated an efficient antitumor synergistic effect able 
to inhibit in vivo tumor growth. Notably, the application of Ag-PNP-CTX to 
irradiated tumor cells decreases the extracellular activity of MMP-2. By 
targeting dispersed GBM cells and reducing MMP-2 activity, the combined use of 
CTX-nanovectors with radiotherapy may represent a promising therapeutic approach 
toward GBM.

OBJECTIVE Cavernous sinus meningiomas (CSMs) represent a cohort of challenging 
skull base tumors. Proper management requires achieving a balance between 
optimal resection, restoration of cranial nerve (CN) function, and maintaining 
or improving quality of life. The objective of this study was to assess the 
pre-, intra-, and postoperative factors related to clinical and neurological 
outcomes, morbidity, mortality, and tumor control in patients with CSM. METHODS 
A retrospective review of a single surgeon's experience with microsurgical 
removal of CSM in 65 patients between January 1996 and August 2013 was done. 
Sekhar's classification, modified Kobayashi grading, and the Karnofsky 
Performance Scale were used to define tumor extension, tumor removal, and 
clinical outcomes, respectively. RESULTS Preoperative CN dysfunction was evident 
in 64.6% of patients. CN II deficits were most common. The greatest improvement 
was seen for CN V deficits, whereas CN II and CN IV deficits showed the smallest 
degree of recovery. Complete resection was achieved in 41.5% of cases and was 
not significantly associated with functional CN recovery. Internal carotid 
artery encasement significantly limited the complete microscopic resection of 
CSM (p < 0.0001). Overall, 18.5% of patients showed symptomatic recurrence after 
their initial surgery (mean follow-up 60.8 months [range 3-199 months]). The use 
of adjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) after microsurgery independently 
decreased the recurrence rate (p = 0.009; OR 0.036; 95% CI 0.003-0.430). 
CONCLUSIONS Modified Kobayashi tumor resection (Grades I-IIIB) was possible in 
41.5% of patients. CN recovery and tumor control were independent of extent of 
tumor removal. The combination of resection and adjuvant SRS can achieve 
excellent tumor control. Furthermore, the use of adjuvant SRS independently 
decreases the recurrence rates of CSM.

Prevention and Research Center, both at the University of Washington in Seattle.

OBJECTIVE: Approximately 30 million Americans present to acute care medical 
settings annually after incurring traumatic injuries. Posttraumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms are endemic among injury survivors. Our 
article is a replication and extension of a previous report documenting a 
pattern of multiple traumatic life events across patients admitted to Level I 
trauma centers for an alcohol-related injury.
METHOD: This study is a secondary analysis of a nationwide 20-site randomized 
trial of an alcohol brief intervention with 660 traumatically injured 
inpatients. Pre-injury trauma history was assessed using the National 
Comorbidity Survey trauma history screen at the six-month time point.
RESULTS: Most common traumatic events experienced by our population of 
alcohol-positive trauma survivors were having had someone close unexpectedly 
die, followed by having seen someone badly beaten or injured. Of particular 
note, there is high reported prevalence of rape/sexual assault, and childhood 
abuse and neglect among physically injured trauma survivors. Additional trauma 
histories are increasingly common among alcohol-positive patients admitted for a 
traumatic injury.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the high rate of experienced multiple traumatic events among 
acutely injured inpatients, the trauma history screen could be productively 
integrated into screening and brief intervention procedures developed for acute 
care settings.

Life expectancy of most human populations has greatly increased as a result of 
factors including better hygiene, medical practice, and nutrition. 
Unfortunately, as humans age, they become more prone to suffer from 
neurodegenerative diseases and neurotoxicity. Polyphenols can be cheaply and 
easily obtained as part of a healthy diet. They present a wide range of 
biological activities, many of which have relevance for human health. Compelling 
evidence has shown that dietary phytochemicals, particularly polyphenols, have 
properties that may suppress neuroinflammation and prevent toxic and 
degenerative effects in the brain. The mechanisms by which polyphenols exert 
their action are not fully understood, but it is clear that they have a direct 
effect through their antioxidant activities. They have also been shown to 
modulate intracellular signaling cascades, including the PI3K-Akt, MAPK, Nrf2, 
and MEK pathways. Polyphenols also interact with a range of neurotransmitters, 
illustrating that these compounds can promote their health benefits in the brain 
through a direct, indirect, or complex action. We discuss whether polyphenols 
obtained from diet or food supplements are an effective strategy to prevent or 
treat neurodegeneration. We also discuss the safety, mechanisms of action, and 
the current and future relevance of polyphenols in clinical treatment of 
neurodegenerative diseases. As populations age, it is important to discuss the 
dietary strategies to avoid or counteract the effects of incurable 
neurodegenerative disorders, which already represent an enormous financial and 
emotional burden for health care systems, patients, and their families.

OBJECTIVE: Studies suggest nerve growth factor inhibitors (NGFi) relieve pain 
but may accelerate disease progression in some patients with osteoarthritis 
(OA). We sought cost and toxicity thresholds that would make NGFi a 
cost-effective treatment for moderate-to-severe knee OA.
DESIGN: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy (OAPol) model to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of NGFi compared to standard of care (SOC) in OA, using 
Tanezumab as an example. Efficacy and rates of accelerated OA progression were 
based on published studies. We varied the price/dose from $200 to $1000. We 
considered self-administered subcutaneous (SC) injections (no administration 
cost) vs provider-administered intravenous (IV) infusion ($69-$433/dose). 
Strategies were defined as cost-effective if their incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was less than $100,000/quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY). In sensitivity analyses we varied efficacy, toxicity, and costs.
RESULTS: SOC in patients with high levels of pain led to an average discounted 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 11.15 QALYs, a lifetime risk of total knee 
replacement surgery (TKR) of 74%, and cumulative discounted direct medical costs 
of $148,700. Adding Tanezumab increased QALYs to 11.42, reduced primary TKR 
utilization to 63%, and increased costs to between $155,400 and $199,500. In the 
base-case analysis, Tanezumab at $600/dose was cost-effective when delivered 
outside of a hospital. At $1000/dose, Tanezumab was not cost-effective in all 
but the most optimistic scenario. Only at rates of accelerated OA progression of 
10% or more (10-fold higher than reported values) did Tanezumab decrease QALYs 
and fail to represent a viable option.
CONCLUSIONS: At $100,000/QALY, Tanezumab would be cost effective if priced 
≤$400/dose in all settings except IV hospital delivery.

BACKGROUND: A significant number of advanced cancer admissions to the intensive 
care unit (ICU) are inappropriate in that they do not result in prolonged 
survival. No clear consensus criteria for reasonable admissions of advanced 
cancer patients have been developed.
METHOD: We established four criteria for reasonable admissions to ICU in 
patients who suffered from advanced, incurable cancer: post procedure 
complication, recent notification of cancer, ECOG performance status of 0-1, and 
life expectancy of more than 6 months. Based on these criteria, we reviewed the 
charts of all patients who died in the ICU at the University of Tennessee Health 
Science Center (UTHSC) affiliated Veteran's Affairs Medical Center between 
10/2005 and 10/2010. We identified patients with advanced, incurable cancer and 
performed an in depth review of their charts.
RESULTS: In the 421 charts of patients who died in our ICU between October 2005 
and October 2010 we identified 52 patients admitted to the ICU with advanced, 
incurable cancer. 14 patients were diagnosed with cancer one month or less prior 
to admission. 21 patients had ECOG performance status of 0-1. 14 patients had 
life expectancy of more than 6 months and 8 patients were admitted for post 
procedure complication. 47% of patients who did not satisfy any of our 
reasonable admission criteria had APDs.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating proposed admission criteria in ICU admission 
guidelines may prevent 37% of inappropriate, advanced cancer admissions to the 
ICU. A simple increase in numbers of APDs would not likely change significantly 
the numbers of inappropriate ICU admissions.

INTRODUCTION: Ranibizumab and aflibercept are anti-vascular endothelial growth 
factor agents licensed for the treatment of visual impairment due to macular 
edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). The aim of this study 
was to estimate, from a UK healthcare payer's perspective, the 
cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab versus aflibercept in this indication.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate the outcomes and costs of treating 
BRVO. Patient baseline characteristics and efficacy data for ranibizumab were 
obtained from the BRAVO trial. The relative efficacy of aflibercept was derived 
from a published network meta-analysis. Injection frequencies were derived from 
ranibizumab and aflibercept studies included in the network meta-analysis. 
Health states were defined by increments of 10 letters in best corrected visual 
acuity (BCVA). Patients could gain or lose a maximum of two health states 
between cycles. The first cycle was 6 months, followed by monthly cycles. 
Different utility values were assigned to the better-seeing and worse-seeing 
eyes based on BCVA. A 2-year treatment time frame and a lifetime time horizon 
were used. Future costs and health outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per annum. 
Sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: The lifetime cost per patient treated was £15,273 with ranibizumab and 
£17,347 with aflibercept. Ranibizumab was dominant over aflibercept, producing 
incremental health gains of 0.0120 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost 
savings of £2074. Net monetary benefit for ranibizumab at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of £20,000/QALY was £2314. Sensitivity analyses showed that the 
results were robust to variations in model parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Ranibizumab provides greater health gains at a lower overall cost 
than aflibercept in the treatment of visual impairment due to macular edema 
secondary to BRVO. Ranibizumab is therefore cost-effective from a UK healthcare 
payer's perspective.

The benefits of chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO) revascularization are not 
well established. In this prospective cohort study, 47 consecutive patients with 
successful percutaneous recanalization of CTO underwent adenosine stress cardiac 
magnetic resonance (CMR), 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and the Short Form-36 
Health Survey before and 6 months after the procedure. Successful recanalization 
of a CTO was followed by significant improvement of (1) global physical and 
mental health status; (2) the distance walked in the 6MWT; (3) the incidence of 
chest pain at the end of the 6MWT; and (4) the score of a novel CMR ischemic 
burden index on the basis of the characteristics of adenosine stress perfusion 
defects (extension, persistence, transmurality, and induced contractile regional 
dysfunction). Patients with greater CMR ischemic index before percutaneous 
revascularization showed better improvement in the 6MWT. In conclusion, 
successful recanalization of a CTO leads to a concurrent improvement in ischemic 
burden, exercise tolerance, angina frequency, and quality of life scores. 
Patients with a high ischemic CMR score before CTO recanalization showed the 
better improvement in exercise tolerance.

Cost-effectiveness of Corticosteroid Nasal Spray vs Surgical Therapy in Patients 
With Severe to Extreme Anatomical Nasal Obstruction.

Teti VP(1), Akdagli S(1), Most SP(1).

Stanford University, Stanford, California.

IMPORTANCE: Health insurance companies commonly require a trial of 
corticosteroid nasal spray prior to authorizing nasal surgery, even in patients 
with severe to extreme anatomical nasal obstruction, despite lack of data 
supporting such medical therapy.
OBJECTIVES: To provide a model for the comparative analysis of medical vs 
surgical treatment for nasal obstruction to help maximize health care benefit 
per dollar spent and to explore the cost-effectiveness of corticosteroid nasal 
spray in patients with severe to extreme nasal airway obstruction on Nasal 
Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scores.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cost-efficiency frontier economic 
evaluation was performed. The economic perspective was that of the health care 
third-party payer. Effectiveness data were obtained from NOSE score 
questionnaires in 179 patients. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
determined from the cost and efficacy data. Comparative treatment groups were 
medical therapy with corticosteroid nasal spray vs surgical therapy for nasal 
airway obstruction. The study was conducted between January 1, 2011, and 
December 30, 2013. The time horizon included 1, 2, and 5 years. Data analysis 
was completed June 1, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY). A modified Markov decision tree model was used. Costs were 
obtained from the Medicare 2015 physician fee schedule, and the mean was 
determined (owing to geographic disparity) along with wholesale and generic 
pharmaceutical pricing.
RESULTS: Among 100 men and 79 women evaluated (mean [SD] age, 37.9 [12.9] 
years), surgical repair of severe nasal airway obstruction cost $6537 and 
produced a total of 1.15 QALYs at 1 year. Medical treatment involved a trial of 
corticosteroid nasal sprays, which cost $520 and produced a total of 1.03 QALYs. 
The surgical approach was markedly more effective but at greater short-term 
cost. In cases of extreme nasal obstruction, medical treatment cost $520.73 with 
1.004 QALYs, demonstrating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
$354 693 per QALY compared with no treatment. Conversely, surgical treatment 
cost $6536.64 and produced 1.136 QALYs, with an ICER of $45 633 compared with 
medical therapy. At 5 years, the ICER decreased from $45 634 to $8110 per QALY 
for surgical treatment of extreme nasal obstruction. The medical treatment ICER 
decreased from $354 693 per QALY at 1 year to $273 704 per QALY at 5 years. An 
ICER was performed and demonstrated a cost threshold of $50 554 per QALY for 
surgical treatment compared with $67 518 per QALY for medical treatment at 1 
year for severe nasal obstruction. If the evaluation is extended to 5 years, 
surgical treatment cost $8984 per QALY compared with $52 571 per QALY for 
medical treatment. Owing to the improved effectiveness outcomes, greater cost 
savings per ICER was demonstrated in patients with extreme nasal obstruction.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Surgical treatment for patients with severe to 
extreme anatomical nasal obstruction demonstrates increased short-term expense 
but is cost-effective in the long term. These data suggest that treatment with 
corticosteroid nasal spray in patients with documented severe to extreme 
anatomical nasal obstruction is unnecessary and results in a delay in treatment.

Articulating the Case for the Longevity Dividend.

The survival of large segments of human populations to advanced ages is a 
crowning achievement of improvements in public health and medicine. But, in the 
21st century, our continued desire to extend life brings forth a unique dilemma. 
The risk of death from cardiovascular diseases and many forms of cancer have 
declined, but even if they continue to do so in the future, the resulting health 
benefits and enhanced longevities are likely to diminish. It is even possible 
that healthy life expectancy could decline in the future as major fatal diseases 
wane. The reason is that the longer we live, the greater is the influence of 
biological aging on the expression of fatal and disabling diseases. As long as 
the rates of aging of our bodies continues without amelioration, the progress we 
make on all major disease fronts must eventually face a point of diminishing 
returns. Research in the scientific study of aging has already showed that the 
aging of our bodies is inherently modifiable, and that a therapeutic 
intervention that slows aging in people is a plausible target for science and 
public health. Given the speed with which population aging is progressing and 
chronic fatal and disabling conditions are challenging health care costs across 
the globe, the case is now being made in the scientific literature that delayed 
aging could be one of the most efficient and promising ways to combat disease, 
extend healthy life, compress morbidity, and reduce health care costs. A 
consortium of scientists and nonprofit organizations has devised a plan to 
initiate an accelerated program of scientific research to develop, test for 
safety and efficacy, and then disseminate a therapeutic intervention to delay 
aging if proven to be safe and effective; this is referred to as the Longevity 
Dividend Initiative Consortium (LDIC). In this review, I articulate the case for 
the LDIC.

INTRODUCTION: People with severe mental illness have increased risk for 
premature mortality and thus a shorter life expectancy. Relative death rates are 
used to show the excess mortality among patients with mental health disorder but 
cannot be used for the comparisons by country, region and time.
METHODS: A population-based register study including all Swedish patients in 
adult psychiatry admitted to hospital with a main diagnosis of schizophrenia, 
bipolar or unipolar mood disorder in 1987-2010 (614 035 person-years). Mortality 
rates adjusted for age, sex and period were calculated using direct 
standardization methods with the 2010 Swedish population as standard. Data on 
all residents aged 15 years or older were used as the comparison group.
RESULTS: Patients with severe mental health disorders had a 3-fold mortality 
compared to general population. All-cause mortality decreased by 9% for people 
with bipolar mood disorder and by 26-27% for people with schizophrenia or 
unipolar mood disorder, while the decline in the general population was 30%. 
Also mortality from diseases of the circulatory system declined less for people 
with severe mental disorder (-35% to - 42%) than for general population (-49%). 
The pattern was similar for other cardiovascular deaths excluding 
cerebrovascular deaths for which the rate declined among people with 
schizophrenia (-30%) and unipolar mood disorder (-41%), unlike for people with 
bipolar mood disorder (-3%).
CONCLUSIONS: People with mental health disorder have still elevated mortality. 
The mortality declined faster for general population than for psychiatric 
patients. More detailed analysis is needed to reveal causes-of-death with 
largest possibilities for improvement.
