contemporary oncology phase 1 trials. Nevertheless, there is no reliable and 
consensual guidance for estimating this criterion. We have conducted a 
systematic review of published studies investigating the risk factor for 90-day 
mortality and the inherent generated scores. Nine studies have been published on 
this topic. Only two of these prognostic models have been validated on an 
independent dataset. Most of the models are based on a very subjective and 
investigator-dependent parameter: the performance status. The predictive 
performance of these prognostic models is poorly evaluated.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are no longer considered merely toxic by-products 
of the oxidative metabolism. Tightly controlled concentrations of ROS and 
fluctuations in redox potential may be important mediators of signaling 
processes. Understanding the role of ROS and redox status in physiology, stress 
response, development, and aging requires their nondisruptive, spatiotemporal, 
real-time quantification in a living organism. We established Caenorhabditis 
elegans strains bearing the genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors HyPer and 
Grx1-roGFP2 for the detection of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and the 
glutathione redox potential, respectively. Although, given its transparency and 
genetic tractability, C. elegans is perfectly suitable as a model organism for 
such approaches, they have never been tried before in this nematode. We found 
that H(2)O(2) treatment clearly induces a dose-dependent, reversible response of 
both biosensors in the living worms. The ratio of oxidized to reduced 
glutathione decreases during postembryonic development. H(2)O(2) levels increase 
with age and this effect is delayed when life span is extended by dietary 
restriction. In young adults, we detected several regions with distinct redox 
properties that may be linked to their biological function. Our findings 
demonstrate that genetically encoded biosensors can reveal previously unknown 
details of in vivo redox biology in multicellular organisms.

PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the relationship between time 
trade off (TTO) and standard gamble (SG) estimates of health and vision 
utilities in a low vision patient sample.
METHODS: Telephone surveys were conducted on 74 low vision patients. All study 
participants were administered utility questionnaires that used the TTO and SG 
methods as they relate to health and vision.
RESULTS: There is high between-person variability in the relationship of TTO- to 
SG-estimated utilities for both vision and health. However, when transformed to 
logits, differences between TTO and SG utilities for health are equal to 
differences between TTO and SG utilities for vision. These differences are 
symmetrically distributed around the origin. The data were consistent with a 
model that includes both health or vision state and personal response criteria. 
The model explains between-person variability in the relationship of TTO to SG 
utilities as idiosyncratic differences within people between response criteria 
for making TTO and SG judgments.
CONCLUSIONS: The large between-person variability in the relation of utilities 
estimated from TTO to those estimated from SG can be explained by large between- 
and within-person variability in personal TTO and SG response criteria. However, 
within each person, the response criteria used to judge health state are the 
same as the response criteria used to judge vision state. This observation leads 
to the conclusion that health and vision states are in the same units when 
estimated from utilities. A meta-analysis of published studies that compared TTO 
with SG utilities for different health states confirms the conclusion of the 
model that average utilities across people are criterion-free estimates of 
average health-related states on a common logit scale.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate preoperative use 
of mupirocin in patients with total joint arthroplasty (TJA).
DESIGN: Simple decision tree model.
SETTING: Outpatient TJA clinical setting.
PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of patients with TJA.
INTERVENTIONS: A simple decision tree model compared 3 strategies in a 
hypothetical cohort of patients with TJA: (1) obtaining preoperative screening 
cultures for all patients, followed by administration of mupirocin to patients 
with cultures positive for Staphylococcus aureus; (2) providing empirical 
preoperative treatment with mupirocin for all patients without screening; and 
(3) providing no preoperative treatment or screening. We assessed the costs and 
benefits over a 1-year period. Data inputs were obtained from a literature 
review and from our institution's internal data. Utilities were measured in 
quality-adjusted life-years, and costs were measured in 2005 US dollars.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
RESULTS: The treat-all and screen-and-treat strategies both had lower costs and 
greater benefits, compared with the no-treatment strategy. Sensitivity analysis 
revealed that this result is stable even if the cost of mupirocin was over $100 
and the cost of SSI ranged between $26,000 and $250,000. Treating all patients 
remains the best strategy when the prevalence of S. aureus carriers and surgical 
site infection is varied across plausible values as well as when the prevalence 
of mupirocin-resistant strains is high.
CONCLUSIONS: Empirical treatment with mupirocin ointment or use of a 
screen-and-treat strategy before TJA is performed is a simple, safe, and 
cost-effective intervention that can reduce the risk of SSI. S. aureus 
decolonization with nasal mupirocin for patients undergoing TJA should be 
considered.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, economic and decision analysis.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate G17DT, an immunogen producing 
neutralizing antibodies against the tumor growth factors amidated and 
glycine-extended forms of gastrin-17, in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, group-sequential 
multicenter trial of G17DT in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer 
unsuitable for or unwilling to take chemotherapy. Inclusion criteria were a 
Karnofsky performance score of 60 or higher and a life expectancy of more than 2 
months. Patients received G17DT or placebo emulsion at weeks 0, 1, 3, 24, and 
52. The primary end point was survival, and secondary end points were 
tolerability, Karnofsky performance.
RESULTS: A total of 154 patients were recruited: 79 G17DT and 75 placebo. A 
final analysis of the intention-to-treat population, using a proportional 
hazards model, stratifying by disease stage and adjusting for interim analysis, 
gave a hazard ratio for mortality of 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.51-1.10, P 
= 0.138; G17DT/placebo). A conventional analysis without adjustment for disease 
stage or interim analysis, censoring for chemotherapy and excluding protocol 
violators, gave median survival periods of 151 (G17DT) and 82 days (placebo) 
(log-rank test, P = 0.03).Patients developing anti-G17DT responses (73.8%) 
survived longer than nonresponders or those on placebo (median survival, 176 vs 
63 vs 83; log-rank test, P = 0.003). G17DT was well tolerated.

Since the discovery of the CFTR gene mutations which cause cystic fibrosis (CF) 
in 1989 the average life expectancy of CF patients has almost doubled and now 
exceeds 37 years. The advances in molecular diagnostics and medical treatments 
expanded beyond the CF patient population as some of the newest treatments are 
also being tested for treatment of complex diseases such as COPD and other 
inherited disorders. Rapid development of CF therapeutics is important for the 
cystic fibrosis community and is an excellent example for other nonprofit 
organizations, disease foundations and pharmaceutical companies alike. Better 
understanding of disease variability and underlying molecular mechanisms through 
genetic association studies aimed to identify novel CF modifier genes opens new 
venues for targeted drug design. Furthermore, these genetic studies allow 
development of molecular diagnostic tests for patient population stratification 
and treatment personalization, which is already being done for CF patients with 
specific mutations in the CFTR gene, as well as implementation of new molecular 
tests for reliable assessment of disease progression and severity.

Varicella-zoster virus causes chickenpox (CP) and after reactivation herpes 
zoster (HZ). Vaccines are available against both diseases warranting an 
assessment of the pre-vaccination burden of disease. We collected data from 
relevant Belgian databases and performed five surveys of CP and HZ patients. The 
rates at which a general practitioner is visited at least once for CP and HZ are 
346 and 378/100 000 person-years, respectively. The average CP and HZ 
hospitalization rates are 5·3 and 14·2/100 000 person-years respectively. The 
direct medical cost for HZ is about twice as large as the direct medical cost 
for CP. The quality-adjusted life years lost for ambulatory CP patients 
consulting a physician is more than double that of those not consulting a 
physician (0·010 vs. 0·004). In conclusion, both diseases cause a substantial 
burden in Belgium.

BACKGROUND: Patients with fibromyalgia have difficulty with activities of daily 
living, they exhibit reduced muscle strength and high incidence of reported 
falls. The objective of this study was to evaluate the functional performance 
and lower limb muscle strength in women with fibromyalgia and determine the 
relationship between muscle strength and falls.
METHODS: Sixteen females with fibromyalgia and 16 healthy women participated in 
the study. Pain intensity, fibromyalgia impact on quality of life, physical 
activity level and fall prevalence were assessed. The peak torque and the rate 
of torque development were determined in maximal voluntary isometric contraction 
(hip, knee and ankle joints) using a load cell. The 30s chair stand, 8 ft up and 
go, sit and reach, and functional reach tests were used to characterize 
functional performance.
FINDINGS: Women with fibromyalgia showed deficits in lower limb muscle strength, 
balance and agility and exhibited decreased knee extension peak torque and rate 
of torque development. In addition, they showed lower hip adduction and 
extension peak torque in comparison to the control group (P>0.05). Hip extension 
rate of torque development, duration of fibromyalgia symptoms, overall pain, 
knee pain, and fibromyalgia impact were strong predictors of the number of falls 
in patients with fibromyalgia (R2=0.86; P<0.05), when considered collectively.
INTERPRETATION: Women with fibromyalgia showed reduced functional performance 
and lower limb muscle strength, mostly explained by pain. There was a high 
prevalence of falls in this population, as explained by hip extensors rate of 
torque development, duration of fibromyalgia symptoms and pain.

Measuring the value of older people's production: a diary study.

and Global Health, Umeå University, SE-901 85 Umeå, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: The productive capacity of retired people is usually not valued. 
However, some retirees produce much more than we might expect. This diary-based 
study identifies the activities of older people, and suggests some value 
mechanisms. One question raised is whether it is possible to scale up this diary 
study into a larger representative study.
METHODS: Diaries kept for one week were collected among 23 older people in the 
north of Sweden. The texts were analysed with a grounded theory approach; an 
interplay between ideas and empirical data.
RESULTS: Some productive activities of older people must be valued as the 
opportunity cost of time or according to the market value, and others must be 
valued with the replacement cost. In order to make the choice between these 
methods, it is important to consider the societal entitlement. When there is no 
societal entitlement, the first or second method must be used; and when it 
exists, the third must be used.
CONCLUSIONS: An explicit investigation of the content of the entitlement is 
needed to justify the choice of valuation method for each activity. In a 
questionnaire addressing older people's production, each question must be 
adjusted to the type of production. In order to fully understand this 
production, it is important to consider the degree of free choice to conduct an 
activity, as well as health-related quality of life.

The effect of an addition of sodium chloride and sodium triphosphate on fat 
oxidation products in cold stored beef.

INTRODUCTION: Meat and processed meats, depending on the animal species and 
anatomical element from which they were obtained, exhibit a varied fat content 
(most typically from 10% to 80% dry matter). Fats are relatively unstable food 
components. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an addition of 
model brines on lipid oxidation rate in the selected beef element stored under 
aerobic conditions and in vacuum at a temperature of 5°C.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Material for analyses comprised beef: rump cut (R) and the 
heel of round (L). Meat was cured (at 20% in relation to raw material weight) 
with brine A, containing 1% NaCl in total weight and brine B, containing 1% NaCl 
and 0.3% sodium tripolyphosphate E 451i (including 56% P2O5 ). Meat after being 
massaged was stored under aerobic conditions (T) and in vacuum (P) at a 
temperature of 5°C for 15 days. During storage of samples changes were 
determined in peroxide value (PV), contents of secondary fat decomposition 
products using the TBARS test as well as changes in pH value.
RESULTS: It was observed that with an extension of sample storage time peroxide 
value was growing gradually, but the dynamics of this growth varied. Samples 
coming from the rump cut muscle, stored in the atmosphere with unlimited access 
of oxygen, were characterised by slightly, but statistically significantly 
higher peroxide values in comparison to the other tested samples. The highest 
increase in the TBARS test value was observed in samples stored under aerobic 
conditions and coming from the heel of round muscle, irrespective of the type of 
applied brine. Conducted analyses showed that vacuum packaging of meat, in 
comparison to the storage of samples at unlimited access of oxygen, effectively 
slowed down the increase in the content of secondary oxidation products 
determined by the TBARS test. The greatest effect of vacuum packaging was 
observed for the heel of round in brine A.
CONCLUSIONS: Vacuum packaging, in comparison to storage of experimental samples 
under aerobic conditions, delayed the increase in peroxide value and effectively 
slowed down the increase in contents of secondary lipid oxidation products. 
Statistically significant changes in pH values were observed in the heel of 
round, irrespective of the type of applied brine, stored under aerobic 
conditions.

A direct method and ICER tables for the estimation of the cost-effectiveness of 
smoking cessation interventions in general populations: application to a new 
cytisine trial and other examples.

INTRODUCTION: The popularity of smoking cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis has 
grown rapidly. Differences in models and inputs mean results may not be 
comparable, and researchers may have to take them on trust because the methods 
are beyond their expertise and not always transparent. We describe a direct 
method and tables of results for researchers without specialist knowledge.
METHODS: We estimate the health benefit to an individual attributed to an 
intervention and compute tables of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
for interventions with varying incremental intervention effects and costs. 
Estimates of life years gained come from the longest epidemiological study. 
After discounting, adjustments are made for future cessation and relapse. The 
method is described in simple steps, and conservative inputs are used 
throughout.
RESULTS: To look up an ICER, the user needs only to know the cost of the 
intervention per smoker and the effect as measured by the percentage of 
ex-smokers attributable to the intervention at either 6- or 12-month follow-up. 
Reanalysis of authoritative reports indicates that these ICERs are comparable to 
those from decision-analytic simulation models.
CONCLUSIONS: Researchers can now obtain immediate estimates of the CE of 
interventions in general populations. The method is easily programmed in a 
spreadsheet. ICERs are from the payer perspective and exclude offset and 
societal costs. Interventions in subpopulations will require inputs specific to 
those populations. Readers who wish to include an adjustment for quality of life 
can easily do so. The tables might promote a standard approach, with 
interventions compared on a consistent and transparent basis.

The cost-effectiveness of Welcome to Medicare visual acuity screening and a 
possible alternative welcome to medicare eye evaluation among persons without 
diagnosed diabetes mellitus.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of visual acuity screening 
performed in primary care settings and of dilated eye evaluations performed by 
an eye care professional among new Medicare enrollees with no diagnosed eye 
disorders. Medicare currently reimburses visual acuity screening for new 
enrollees during their initial preventive primary care health check, but dilated 
eye evaluations may be a more cost-effective policy.
DESIGN: Monte Carlo cost-effectiveness simulation model with a total of 50 000 
simulated patients with demographic characteristics matched to persons 65 years 
of age in the US population.
RESULTS: Compared with no screening policy, dilated eye evaluations increased 
quality-adjusted life-years(QALYs) by 0.008 (95% credible interval [CrI], 
0.005-0.011) and increased costs by $94 (95% CrI, −$35 to$222). A visual acuity 
screening increased QALYs in less than 95% of the simulations (0.001 [95% CrI, 
−0.002 to 0.004) and increased total costs by $32 (95% CrI, −$97 to $159) per 
person. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a visual acuity screening 
and an eye examination compared with no screening were $29 000 and$12 000 per 
QALY gained, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay value of $15 000 or more per 
QALY gained, a dilated eye evaluation was the policy option most likely to be 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: The currently recommended visual acuity screening showed limited 
efficacy and cost-effectiveness compared with no screening. In contrast, anew 
policy of reimbursement for Welcome to Medicare dilated eye evaluations was 
highly cost-effective.

Caenorhabditis elegans RNA-processing protein TDP-1 regulates protein 
homeostasis and life span.

Transactive response DNA-binding protein (TARDBP/TDP-43), a heterogeneous 
nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) with diverse activities, is a common 
denominator in several neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Orthologs of TDP-43 
exist in animals ranging from mammals to invertebrates. Here, we systematically 
studied mutant Caenorhabditis elegans lacking the nematode TDP-43 ortholog, 
TDP-1. Heterologous expression of human TDP-43 rescued the defects in C. elegans 
lacking TDP-1, suggesting their functions are conserved. Although the tdp-1 
mutants exhibited deficits in fertility, growth, and locomotion, loss of tdp-1 
attenuated defects in several C. elegans models of proteotoxicity. Loss of tdp-1 
suppressed defects in transgenic C. elegans expressing TDP-43 or CuZn superoxide 
dismutase, both of which are associated with proteotoxicity in neurodegenerative 
diseases. Loss of tdp-1 also reduced defects in mutant animals lacking the heat 
shock factor HSF-1. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that the loss of 
TDP-1 altered expression of genes functioning in RNA processing and protein 
folding. Furthermore, the absence of tdp-1 extended the life span in C. elegans. 
The life span extension required a FOXO transcriptional factor DAF-16 but not 
HSF-1. These results suggest that the C. elegans TDP-1 has a role in the 
regulation of protein homeostasis and aging.

Telomere length in early life predicts lifespan.

The attrition of telomeres, the ends of eukaryote chromosomes, is thought to 
play an important role in cell deterioration with advancing age. The observed 
variation in telomere length among individuals of the same age is therefore 
thought to be related to variation in potential longevity. Studies of this 
relationship are hampered by the time scale over which individuals need to be 
followed, particularly in long-lived species where lifespan variation is 
greatest. So far, data are based either on simple comparisons of telomere length 
among different age classes or on individuals whose telomere length is measured 
at most twice and whose subsequent survival is monitored for only a short 
proportion of the typical lifespan. Both approaches are subject to bias. Key 
studies, in which telomere length is tracked from early in life, and actual 
lifespan recorded, have been lacking. We measured telomere length in zebra 
finches (n = 99) from the nestling stage and at various points thereafter, and 
recorded their natural lifespan (which varied from less than 1 to almost 9 y). 
We found telomere length at 25 d to be a very strong predictor of realized 
lifespan (P < 0.001); those individuals living longest had relatively long 
telomeres at all points at which they were measured. Reproduction increased 
adult telomere loss, but this effect appeared transient and did not influence 
survival. Our results provide the strongest evidence available of the 
relationship between telomere length and lifespan and emphasize the importance 
of understanding factors that determine early life telomere length.

Progressive hemifacial atrophy, also known as Parry-Romberg syndrome, is an 
uncommon degenerative condition which is poorly defined. It is characterized by 
a slow and progressive atrophy affecting one side of the face. The onset usually 
occurs during the first two decades of life. Characteristically, the atrophy 
progresses slowly for several years, and then it becomes stable. Ophthalmic 
involvement is common, with progressive enophthalmos which is a frequent 
finding. Cutaneous pigmentation is common in such conditions, however its 
extension to the conjunctiva is rarely reported. We report a case of Parry 
Romberg syndrome with characteristic clinical and radiographic presentation 
accompanied with rare ocular findings. The clinical features, radiological 
findings, and differential diagnoses to be considered, and the available 
treatment options are discussed in this report.

BACKGROUND: Because of an increase in life expectancy and 
de-institutionalisation, many adults with intellectual disability (ID) live with 
and are cared for by their parents throughout their adult lives. Because of 
caring demands, the quality of life (QOL) of parents may be affected. The study 
explored the impact of caring for an adult with ID on the QOL of parents.
METHODS: Participants were 12 parents who were the full-time carers of an adult 
with ID. Participants were interviewed about the effect of caring on their QOL. 
Interviews were analysed thematically.
RESULTS: Caring had a positive impact on QOL by enabling participants to develop 
relationships and receive support, participate in leisure activities, achieve a 
sense of personal satisfaction and enable a more positive appraisal of their 
lives. Caring had a negative impact on participants' QOL by restricting their 
relationships, leisure activities and employment opportunities. Caring was also 
associated with financial insecurity, frustrations at the service system and 
fear of what the future held for their offspring.
CONCLUSIONS: Caring for an adult with ID had both positive and negative effects 
on parents' QOL. Improving services and service delivery, including the 
provision of residential services and respite, would address many of the issues 
that were reported to have a negative impact on parents' QOL.

BACKGROUND: Rapid socioeconomic development resulting in changing lifestyles and 
life expectancy appears to be accompanied by an increasing prevalence of type 2 
diabetes. Genetic predisposition related to ethnicity is a major determinant of 
diabetes risk. This study investigates the prevalences of diabetes and 
prediabetes in different ethnic populations residing in the Mudanjiang area 
located in the northeast of China.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among Han, Manchu and Korean 
Chinese aged 20 years or older. Diabetes and prediabetes were diagnosed using 
standard oral glucose tolerance tests.
RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes in Manchu (8.39%) and Korean Chinese (9.42%) 
was significantly lower than that in Han (12.10%). The prevalence of prediabetes 
was 18.96%, 19.36% and 20.47% in Han, Manchu and Korean populations, 
respectively. Korean Chinese had a lower prevalence of isolated impaired fasting 
glucose and higher prevalence of isolated impaired glucose tolerance than the 
other two ethnic groups. Most patients with diabetes, especially ethnic minority 
patients, were undiagnosed. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that 
age, family history of diabetes, control of diet, self-monitoring of weight, 
central obesity, increased heart rate, hypertension, elevated plasma 
triglyceride level, elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and Han 
ethnicity were significantly associated with an increased risk of diabetes. 
Further, Manchu Chinese were found to have the lowest risk of diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that diabetes is a major public health problem 
in the Mudanjiang area of China. Ethnicity plays a role in the different 
prevalences of diabetes and prediabetes among the three ethnic groups. Diabetes 
is less prevalent among Manchu Chinese compared with Han and Korean Chinese.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The Denver peritoneovenous shunt is useful in the resolution of 
refractory ascites, because it alleviates symptoms and allows effective 
palliation. However, this shunt did not prolong the life expectancy of patients 
with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Therefore, when deciding whether or not to 
implant a Denver shunt, it is important to determine the condition of the 
patient with refractory ascites. Here, we determined the appropriate time for 
Denver shunt implantation.
METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively studied 21 patients who underwent Denver shunt 
implantation for hepatic failure-related ascites. The patients were divided into 
PC and WPC groups depending on whether or not paracentesis was performed before 
implantation of the Denver shunt, respectively.
RESULTS: The mean interval from hospital admission to Denver shunt implantation 
was significantly shorter in the WPC group (9.0±2.2 days) than in the PC group 
(25.9±5.9 days) (p<0.0001). The mean survival time was significantly longer in 
the WPC group (8.4±2.5 months) (p<0.0071) than in the PC group (5.6±1.7 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Early implantation of a Denver shunt should be considered for the 
treatment of ascites that is resistant to conservative medical therapy.

Substrate inhibition and allosteric regulation by heparan sulfate of Trypanosoma 
brucei cathepsin L.

Costa TF(1), dos Reis FC, Lima AP.

The cysteine protease brucipain is an important drug target in the protozoan 
Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of both Human African trypanosomiasis 
and Animal African trypanosomiasis. Brucipain is closely related to mammalian 
cathepsin L and currently used as a framework for the development of inhibitors 
that display anti-parasitic activity. We show that recombinant brucipain lacking 
the C-terminal extension undergoes inhibition by the substrate 
benzyloxycarbonyl-FR-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin at concentrations above the K(m), 
but not by benzyloxycarbonyl-VLR-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. The allosteric 
modulation exerted by the substrate is controlled by temperature, being apparent 
at 25°C but concealed at 37°C. The behavior of the enzyme in vitro can be 
explained by discrete conformational changes caused by the shifts in temperature 
that render it less susceptible to substrate inhibition. Enzyme inhibition by 
the di-peptydyl substrate impaired the degradation of human fibrinogen at 25°C, 
but not at 37°C. We also found that heparan sulfate acts as a natural allosteric 
modulator of the enzyme through interactions that prevent substrate inhibition. 
We propose that brucipain shifts between an active and an inactive form as a 
result of temperature-dependent allosteric regulation.

CRMP4 suppresses apical dendrite bifurcation of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the 
mouse hippocampus.

Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are a family of cytosolic 
phosphoproteins that consist of 5 members (CRMP 1-5). CRMP2 and CRMP4 regulate 
neurite outgrowth by binding to tubulin heterodimers, resulting in the assembly 
of microtubules. CRMP2 also mediates the growth cone collapse response to the 
repulsive guidance molecule semaphorin-3A (Sema3A). However, the role of CRMP4 
in Sema3A signaling and its function in the developing mouse brain remain 
unclear. We generated CRMP4-/- mice in order to study the in vivo function of 
CRMP4 and identified a phenotype of proximal bifurcation of apical dendrites in 
the CA1 pyramidal neurons of CRMP4-/- mice. We also observed increased dendritic 
branching in cultured CRMP4-/- hippocampal neurons as well as in cultured 
cortical neurons treated with CRMP4 shRNA. Sema3A induces extension and 
branching of the dendrites of hippocampal neurons; however, these inductions 
were compromised in the CRMP4-/- hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that 
CRMP4 suppresses apical dendrite bifurcation of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the 
mouse hippocampus and that this is partly dependent on Sema3A signaling.

CONTEXT: To better target services to those who may benefit, many guidelines 
recommend incorporating life expectancy into clinical decisions.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality and limitations of prognostic indices for 
mortality in older adults through systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Google Scholar from 
their inception through November 2011.
STUDY SELECTION: We included indices if they were validated and predicted 
absolute risk of mortality in patients whose average age was 60 years or older. 
We excluded indices that estimated intensive care unit, disease-specific, or 
in-hospital mortality.
DATA EXTRACTION: For each prognostic index, we extracted data on clinical 
setting, potential for bias, generalizability, and accuracy.
RESULTS: We reviewed 21,593 titles to identify 16 indices that predict risk of 
mortality from 6 months to 5 years for older adults in a variety of clinical 
settings: the community (6 indices), nursing home (2 indices), and hospital (8 
indices). At least 1 measure of transportability (the index is accurate in more 
than 1 population) was tested for all but 3 indices. By our measures, no study 
was free from potential bias. Although 13 indices had C statistics of 0.70 or 
greater, none of the indices had C statistics of 0.90 or greater. Only 2 indices 
were independently validated by investigators who were not involved in the 
index's development.
CONCLUSION: We identified several indices for predicting overall mortality in 
different patient groups; future studies need to independently test their 
accuracy in heterogeneous populations and their ability to improve clinical 
outcomes before their widespread use can be recommended.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease is now regarded as amajor public health 
concern. This is especially true in developing countries where it accounts for 
significant morbidity, mortality and decreased life expectancy. The main problem 
for developing countries is the cost of dialysis. Indeed, the availability of 
peritoneal dialysis for renal replacement therapy is low in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Since March 2004 peritoneal dialysis has been available to some patients with 
end-stage renal disease in Senegal. The purpose of this study was to assess 
epidemiologic, clinical, technical patterns and outcomes in patients who 
underwent peritoneal dialysis in the first three years of the program.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This three-year retropective study identified 26 patients 
who underwent peritoneal dialysis for end-stage renal disease for a period of at 
least 15 days. Patients not meeting these criteria were not included. All 
patients had a Baxter type transfer set. Lactate-bicarbonate solution was used 
for countinuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. In 3 cases, Icodextrin- and 
amino-acid based-solutions were employed. In automated peritoneal dialysis, the 
Home Choice machine was used for all patients. Epidemiological, 
clinical/paraclinical data and outcomes were noted for each patient.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included in the study. Median age was 48 +/- 6 
years with a M/F sex ratio of 1.17. Most patients (84%) were literate. Diabetic 
nephropathy and nephroangiosclerosis were the main causes of end-stage renal 
disease. The mean Charlson score was 3 (range, 2 to 5). Mean residual diuresis 
was 435 mL/day. The peritonitis rate was 1 per 20 patient months. Staphylococcus 
aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common germs. Six patients 
presented catheter infection: exit-site in 4 and tunnel in 2. Catheter 
obstruction occurred in three cases. At the end of the study, 6 patients were 
still in automated peritoneal dialysis and 8 in countinuous ambulatory 
peritoneal dialysis. Six 6 patients died and 6 were switched to hemodialysis.
CONCLUSION: Peritoneal dialysis is available as a renal replacement therapy in 
Senegal. It has allowed end-stage renal disease patients greater autonomy in 
their working place.

Immunology in the clinic review series; focus on cancer: double trouble for 
tumours: bi-functional and redirected T cells as effective cancer 
immunotherapies.

Cancer is one of the most important pathological conditions facing mankind in 
the 21st century, and is likely to become the most important cause of death as 
improvements continue in health, diet and life expectancy. The immune response 
is responsible for controlling nascent cancer through immunosurveillance. If 
tumours escape this control, they can develop into clinical cancer. Although 
surgery and chemo- or radiotherapy have improved survival rates significantly, 
there is a drive to reharness immune responses to treat disease. As T cells are 
one of the key immune cells in controlling cancer, research is under way to 
enhance their function and improve tumour targeting. This can be achieved by 
transduction with tumour-specific T cell receptor (TCR) or chimaeric antigen 
receptors (CAR) to generate redirected T cells. Virus-specific cells can also be 
transduced with TCR or CAR to create bi-functional T cells with specificity for 
both virus and tumour. In this review we outline the development and 
optimization of redirected and bi-functional T cells, and outline the results 
from current clinical trials using these cells. From this we discuss the 
challenges involved in generating effective anti-tumour responses while avoiding 
concomitant damage to normal tissues and organs.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant and aggressive type of brain 
tumor with an average life expectancy of less than 15 months. This is mostly due 
to the highly mutated genome of GBM, which is characterized by the deregulation 
of many key signaling pathways involving growth, proliferation, survival, and 
apoptosis. It is critical to explore novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies 
that target these pathways to improve the treatment of malignant glioma in the 
future. This review summarizes the most common and important pathways that are 
highly mutated or deregulated in GBM and discusses potential therapeutic 
strategies targeting these pathways.

BACKGROUND: Although comorbidity has been shown to affect the benefits and risks 
of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, it has not been accounted for in prior 
cost-effectiveness analyses of CRC screening.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, a highly 
prevalent comorbidity in U.S. adults aged 50 and older, on health and economic 
outcomes of CRC screening.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using an integrated modeling framework.
DATA SOURCES: Derived from basic and epidemiologic studies, clinical trials, 
cancer registries, and a colonoscopy database.
TARGET POPULATION: U.S. 50-year-old population.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Costs are based on Medicare reimbursement rates.
INTERVENTIONS: Colonoscopy screening at ten-year intervals, beginning at age 50, 
and discontinued after age 50, 60, 70, 80 or death.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Health outcomes and cost effectiveness.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Diabetes diagnosis significantly affects 
cost-effectiveness of CRC screening. For the same CRC screening strategy, a 
person without diabetes at age 50 gained on average 0.07-0.13 life years more 
than a person diagnosed with diabetes at age 50 or younger. For a population of 
1,000 patients diagnosed with diabetes at baseline, increasing stop age from 
70 years to 80 years increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by 
0.3, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $206,671/QALY. The 
corresponding figures for 1,000 patients without diabetes are 2.3 QALYs and 
$46,957/QALY.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness results are sensitive to 
cost of colonoscopy and adherence to colonoscopy screening.
LIMITATIONS: Results depend on accuracy of model assumptions.
CONCLUSION: Benefits of CRC screening differ substantially for patients with and 
without diabetes. Screening for CRC in patients diagnosed with diabetes at age 
50 or younger is not cost-effective beyond age 70. Screening recommendations 
should be individualized based on the presence of comorbidities.

    Kidney Int. 2013 Feb;83(2):331.

We studied here the clinical course of heterozygous carriers of X-linked Alport 
syndrome and a subgroup of patients with thin basement membrane disease due to 
heterozygous autosomal recessive Alport mutations whose prognosis may be worse 
than formerly thought. We analyzed 234 Alport carriers, including 29 with 
autosomal recessive mutations. Using Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests, 
autosomal and X-linked carriers were found to have similar incidences of renal 
replacement therapy, proteinuria, and impaired creatinine clearance. Further, 
age at onset of renal replacement therapy did not differ between X-chromosomal 
and autosomal carriers. Both groups showed an impaired life expectancy when 
reaching renal replacement therapy. RAAS inhibition significantly delayed the 
onset of end-stage renal failure. Not only carriers of X-linked Alport mutations 
but also heterozygous carriers of autosomal recessive mutations were found to 
have an increased risk for worse renal function. The risk of end-stage renal 
disease in both groups affected life expectancy, and this should cause a greater 
alertness toward patients presenting with what has been wrongly termed 'familial 
benign hematuria.' Timely therapy can help to delay onset of end-stage renal 
failure. Thus, yearly follow-up by a nephrologist is advised for X-linked Alport 
carriers and patients with thin basement membrane nephropathy, microalbuminuria,
