screening, and 0·25 years (0·22-0·27) from all three screenings together. One 
integrated strategy (screening alcohol, tobacco, and depression with diagnostic 
assessment for all CASM conditions if any screened positive) produced 
near-maximal benefit (0·82 years [0·80-0·84]) without adding substantial 
screening burden, albeit requiring additional diagnostic assessments.
INTERPRETATION: Primary care providers for people with HIV should consider 
comprehensive diagnostic assessment of CASM conditions if one or more conditions 
screen positive.

An increase in life expectancy in developed countries has led to a surge of 
chronic aging-related diseases. In the last few decades, several studies have 
provided evidence of the prominent role of cellular senescence in many of these 
pathologies. Key traits of senescent cells include cell cycle arrest, apoptosis 
resistance, and secretome shift to senescence-associated secretory phenotype 
resulting in increased secretion of various intermediate bioactive factors 
important for senescence pathophysiology. However, cellular senescence is a 
highly phenotypically heterogeneous process, hindering the discovery of totally 
specific and accurate biomarkers. Also, strategies to prevent the pathologic 
effect of senescent cell accumulation during aging by impairing senescence onset 
or promoting senescent cell clearance have shown great potential during in vivo 
studies, and some are already in early stages of clinical translation. The 
adaptability of these senotherapeutic approaches to human application has been 
questioned due to the lack of proper senescence targeting and senescence 
involvement in important physiologic functions. In this review, we explore the 
heterogeneous phenotype of senescent cells and its influence on the expression 
of biomarkers currently used for senescence detection. We also discuss the 
current evidence regarding the efficacy, reliability, development stage, and 
potential for human applicability of the main existing senotherapeutic 
strategies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This paper is an extensive review of what is 
currently known about the complex process of cellular senescence and explores 
its most defining features. The main body of the discussion focuses on how the 
multifeature fluctuation of the senescence phenotype and the physiological role 
of cellular senescence have both caused a limitation in the search for truly 
reliable senescence biomarkers and the progression in the development of 
senotherapies.

BACKGROUND: Physicians treating similar patients in similar care-delivery 
contexts vary in the intensity of life-extending care provided to their patients 
at the end-of-life. Physician psychological propensities are an important 
potential determinant of this variability, but the pertinent literature has yet 
to be synthesized.
OBJECTIVE: Conduct a review of qualitative studies to explicate whether and how 
psychological propensities could result in some physicians providing more 
intensive treatment than others.
METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted in five major electronic 
databases-MEDLINE ALL (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO 
(Ovid), and Cochrane CENTRAL (Wiley)-to identify eligible studies (earliest 
available date to August 2021). Eligibility criteria included examination of a 
physician psychological factor as relating to end-of-life care intensity in 
advanced life-limiting illness. Findings from individual studies were pooled and 
synthesized using thematic analysis, which identified common, prevalent themes 
across findings.
RESULTS: The search identified 5623 references, of which 28 were included in the 
final synthesis. Seven psychological propensities were identified as influencing 
physician judgments regarding whether and when to withhold or de-escalate 
life-extending treatments resulting in higher treatment intensity: (1) 
professional identity as someone who extends lifespan, (2) mortality aversion, 
(3) communication avoidance, (4) conflict avoidance, (5) personal values 
favoring life extension, (6) decisional avoidance, and (7) over-optimism.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychological propensities could influence physician judgments 
regarding whether and when to de-escalate life-extending treatments. Future work 
should examine how individual and environmental factors combine to create such 
propensities, and how addressing these propensities could reduce 
physician-attributed variation in end-of-life care intensity.

STUDY QUESTION: What is the recommended management for medically assisted 
reproduction (MAR) in patients with a viral infection or disease, based on the 
best available evidence in the literature?
SUMMARY ANSWER: The ESHRE guideline on MAR in patients with a viral 
infection/disease makes 78 recommendations on prevention of horizontal and 
vertical transmission before, during and after MAR, and the impact on its 
outcomes, and these also include recommendations regarding laboratory safety on 
the processing and storage of gametes and embryos testing positive for viral 
infections.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The development of new and improved anti-viral 
medications has resulted in improved life expectancy and quality of life for 
patients with viral infections/diseases. Patients of reproductive age are 
increasingly exploring their options for family creation.
STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: The guideline was developed according to the 
structured methodology for the development of ESHRE guidelines. After the 
formulation of nine key questions for six viruses (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis 
C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, human papilloma virus, human 
T-lymphotropic virus I/II and Zika virus) by a group of experts, literature 
searches and assessments were performed. Papers published up to 2 November 2020 
and written in English were included in the review. Evidence was analyzed by 
female, male or couple testing positive for the virus.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: Based on the collected evidence, 
recommendations were formulated and discussed until consensus was reached within 
the guideline group. There were 61 key questions to be answered by the guideline 
development group (GDG), of which 12 were answered as narrative questions and 49 
as PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) questions. A stakeholder 
review was organized after the finalization of the draft. The final version was 
approved by the GDG and the ESHRE Executive Committee.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: This guideline aims to help providers meet 
a growing demand for guidance on the management of patients with a viral 
infection/disease presenting in the fertility clinic.The guideline makes 78 
recommendations on prevention of viral transmission before and during MAR, and 
interventions to reduce/avoid vertical transmission to the newborn. Preferred 
MAR treatments and interventions are described together with the effect of viral 
infections on outcomes. The GDG formulated 44 evidence-based recommendations-of 
which 37 were formulated as strong recommendations and 7 as weak-33 good 
practice points (GPP) and one research only recommendation. Of the 
evidence-based recommendations, none were supported by high-quality evidence, 
two by moderate-quality evidence, 15 by low-quality evidence and 27 by very 
low-quality evidence. To support future research in the field of MAR in patients 
with a viral infection/disease, a list of research recommendations is provided.
LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: Most interventions included are not 
well-studied in patients with a viral infection/disease. For a large proportion 
of interventions, evidence was very limited and of very low quality. More 
evidence is required for these interventions, especially in the field of human 
papilloma virus (HPV). Such future studies may require the current 
recommendations to be revised.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The guideline provides clinicians with clear 
advice on best practice in MAR for patients with a viral infection/disease, 
based on the best evidence currently available. In addition, a list of research 
recommendations is provided to stimulate further studies in the field.
STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The guideline was developed and funded by 
ESHRE, covering expenses associated with the guideline meetings, with the 
literature searches and with the dissemination of the guideline. The guideline 
group members did not receive any financial incentives, all work was provided 
voluntarily. A.D. reports research fees from Ferring and Merck, consulting fees 
from Ferring, outside the submitted work. C.P. reports speakers fees from Merck 
and MSD outside the submitted work. K.T. reports speakers fees from Cooper 
Surgical and Ferring and consultancy fees as member of the advisory board 
BioTeam of Ferring, outside the submitted work. The other authors have no 
conflicts of interest to declare.
DISCLAIMER: This guideline represents the views of ESHRE, which were achieved 
after careful consideration of the scientific evidence available at the time of 
preparation. In the absence of scientific evidence on certain aspects, a 
consensus between the relevant ESHRE stakeholders has been obtained. Adherence 
to these clinical practice guidelines does not guarantee a successful or 
specific outcome, nor does it establish a standard of care. Clinical practice 
guidelines do not replace the need for application of clinical judgment to each 
individual presentation, nor variations based on locality and facility type.

BACKGROUND: Improved understanding and treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) has led 
to longer life expectancy, which is accompanied by an increasingly complex 
regimen of treatments. Suboptimal adherence to the treatment plan, in the 
context of respiratory disease, has been found to be associated with poorer 
health outcomes. With digital technology being more accessible, it can be used 
to monitor adherence to inhaled therapies via chipped nebulisers, mobile phone 
apps and web-based platforms. This technology can allow monitoring of adherence 
as well as clinical outcomes, and allow feedback to both the person with CF and 
their healthcare team.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of using digital technology to monitor 
adherence to inhaled therapies and health status in adults and children with CF.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, 
compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and 
conference abstract books.  Date of last search: 28 October 2021. We also 
searched Embase and three clinical trial registries and checked references of 
included studies. Date of last search: 9 November 2021.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) looking 
at the effects of a digital technology for monitoring adherence of children and 
adults with CF to inhaled therapies.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors screened the search results for 
studies eligible for inclusion in the review and extracted their data. We used 
Risk of Bias 2 for assessing study quality. We assessed the overall certainty of 
the evidence using GRADE.
MAIN RESULTS: We included two studies in our review, with 628 participants aged 
five to 41 years. There was one study each for two different comparisons.  
Nebuliser target inhalation mode versus standard inhalation mode The included 
parallel study was carried out over 10 weeks after a run-in period of four to 
six weeks. The study compared the effects of a digitally enhanced inhalation 
mode (target inhalation mode) for nebulised antibiotics compared to standard 
mode in children attending a regional CF clinic in the United Kingdom. The 
study's primary outcome was the time taken to complete the inhaled treatment, 
but investigators also reported on adherence to therapy. The results showed that 
there may be an improvement in adherence with the target inhalation mode when 
this intervention is used (mean difference (MD) 24.0%, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) 2.95 to 45.05; low-certainty evidence). The target inhalation mode may make 
little or no difference to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % 
predicted (MD 1.00 % predicted, 95% CI -9.37 to 11.37; low-certainty evidence). 
The study did not report on treatment burden, quality of life (QoL) or pulmonary 
exacerbations. eNebuliser with digital support versus eNebuliser without support 
One large multicentre RCT monitored adherence via data-tracking nebulisers. The 
intervention group also receiving access to an online web-based platform, 
CFHealthHub, which offered tailored, flexible support from the study 
interventionist as well as access to their adherence data, educational and 
problem-solving information throughout the 12-month trial period. We graded all 
evidence as moderate certainty. Compared to usual care, the digital intervention 
probably improves adherence to inhaled therapy (MD 18%, 95% CI 12.90 to 23.10); 
probably leads to slightly reduced treatment burden (MD 5.1, 95% CI 1.79 to 
8.41); and may lead to slightly improved FEV1 % predicted (MD 3.70, 95% CI -0.23 
to 7.63). There is probably little or no difference in the incidence of 
pulmonary exacerbations or QoL between the two groups.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Digital monitoring plus tailored support via an online 
platform probably improves adherence to inhaled therapies and reduces treatment 
burden (but without a corresponding change in QoL) in the medium term (low- and 
moderate-certainty evidence). In a shorter time frame, technological enhancement 
of inhaling antibiotics may improve adherence to treatment (low-certainty 
evidence). There may be little or no effect on lung function with either 
intervention, and online monitoring probably makes no difference to pulmonary 
exacerbations.  Future research should assess the effect of digital technology 
on adherence in both children and adults. Consideration of adherence to the 
total treatment regimen is also important, as an improvement in adherence to 
inhaled therapies could come at the cost of adherence to other parts of the 
treatment regimen.

Fasting is associated with improvements in cognitive function, and triggers 
weight loss in human and animal models. In recent years, the connection between 
fasting, brain health, and cognitive function has increasingly proven deserving 
of attention from researchers. The objective of this review work is to highlight 
evidence supporting a positive association between fasting and enhanced 
cognition. We looked at the following database sources "The Cochrane Library, 
PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Google Scholar" for present review article. 
All the studies based on the key words "impact of fasting", or "cognitive 
function" or "brain stimulation". Much of this evidence demonstrates that 
fasting results in enhanced performance in cognitive tests of memory and 
visuospatial processing, which rely heavily on hippocampal function. The 
mechanisms responsible for the cognitive improvements associated with fasting 
are not fully understood, although current evidence suggests neuroplasticity 
plays an important role. Maintaining the health and the functionality of 
neurologically and cognitively impaired individuals can be extremely costly. 
Higher life expectancy and ageing populations globally is anticipated to 
increase the prevalence of many non-communicable, chronic, progressive 
conditions including neurological disorders.

OBJECTIVES: This population-based study aimed to collect, analyze, and summarize 
the long-term trends in medical imaging use in Taiwan.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort population-based study of medical imaging usage 
for the individuals who received care under the National Health Insurance system 
from 2000 to 2017. CT and MRI utilization rates were determined overall as well 
as across certain variables including patient age, hospital type, health care 
type, hospital characteristics, and geographic area.
RESULTS: Individuals registered in our health insurance system have received 
21,766,745 CT scans and 7,520,088 MRI scans from 2000 to 2017. Annual growth 
rates for both imaging types were positive over that period, though growth rates 
have slowed in recent years. The growth rate for CT use was greatest (9-12%) 
between 2001 and 2004, dropped to 2% in 2005, then generally rose thereafter, 
reaching 3% in 2017. Similarly, MRI use growth peaked at 24% between 2001 and 
2003, dropped to 4% in 2005, then increased in a fluctuating manner, reaching 2% 
in 2017.
CONCLUSION: Over the past 2 decades, CT and MRI use in Taiwan has increased 
sharply, especially in the oldest age group (≥ 60 years old), but growth rates 
have slowed in recent years. Increases in imaging use have corresponded with 
improved clinical outcomes, including greater life expectancy and reduced 
mortality rates, though further assessment is required to demonstrate a direct 
link with imaging. Nevertheless, the better clinical outcomes are also 
predisposed by the comprehensive care covered by the NHI system.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) is associated 
with an increased risk of depression, poor sleep and reduced health-related 
quality of life. Two phase III studies (KALM-1 and KALM-2) of difelikefalin 
showed reduced CKD-aP severity and improved itch-related health-related quality 
of life in patients with moderate and severe CKD-aP receiving haemodialysis for 
kidney failure.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the cost effectiveness of difelikefalin for 
patients with CKD-aP receiving haemodialysis for kidney failure compared to 
standard care from a UK National Health Service perspective.
METHODS: A cohort model was developed with four health states representing 
levels of pruritus intensity over time, based on the KALM trials augmented with 
longer term CKD-aP severity data from another haemodialysis trial (SHAREHD) for 
standard care. Utilities were estimated from a mapping study of 5-D Itch to 
EQ-5D-5L in 487 patients receiving haemodialysis, costs were estimated based on 
resource use alongside the SHAREHD and 2018 unit costs, and inflated to 2021 
costs. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years were discounted at 3.5% per annum. 
A de novo economic model was developed in Microsoft Excel with scenario analyses 
performed using a range of assumptions.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis over a time horizon of 64 weeks, using a 
placeholder cost of £75 per 28-days for difelikefalin, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of difelikefalin compared with standard care was 
£19,558/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Scenario analyses resulted in 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios that ranged from £10,154/QALY (severe 
only) to £16,957/QALY (5-year horizon) for difelikefalin compared to standard 
care. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested difelikefalin has a 48.6% 
probability of being cost effective at a threshold of £20,000/QALY and a 57.2% 
probability of being cost effective at a threshold of £30,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of difelikefalin in a range of scenarios 
could make it an important pharmacotherapy to address the high burden of disease 
and unmet need for treatments associated with CKD-aP in the UK.

Volunteering and political participation are differentially associated with 
eudaimonic and social well-being across age groups and European countries.

Pavlova MK(1), Lühr M(1).

Voluntary participation is thought to promote the well-being of engaged 
individuals, especially in old age, but prior evidence on this link is mixed. In 
the present studies, we used the cross-sectional data from Round 6 (2012) of the 
European Social Survey (ESS) to investigate the variation in the associations 
between voluntary participation and eudaimonic (e.g., sense of direction) and 
social (e.g., perceived social support) well-being across types of participation 
(nonpolitical volunteering vs. political participation), age groups, and 
European countries. Study 1 addressed individual-level associations and age 
differences therein (preregistered at https://osf.io/2p9sz and 
https://osf.io/6twqe). Two-level multiple regression with an extensive set of 
control variables showed that at the within-country level, the associations 
between voluntary participation and well-being indicators were small on average. 
Nonpolitical volunteering had significantly more positive effects than did 
political participation, whereas few significant age differences emerged. Study 
2 focused on the country-level variables that might explain the substantial 
cross-national variation in the main effects of voluntary participation 
(preregistered at https://osf.io/mq3dx). Only GDP per capita was a significant 
moderator at the country level: The associations of nonpolitical volunteering 
with eudaimonic well-being were more positive in the European countries with 
lower GDP. Other country-level variables (Gini coefficient, social welfare 
spending, and democracy indices) yielded no consistent moderation effects. Study 
3 considered potential country-level explanations for the substantial 
cross-national variation in whether younger or older adults appeared to benefit 
more (preregistered at https://osf.io/7ks45). None of the country-level 
variables considered (effective retirement age in men, life expectancy at 65, 
average age of members of the national parliament and cabinet, and youth 
unemployment rate) could account for this variation. We conclude that, given the 
large cross-national variation in the effects of voluntary participation on 
well-being and in age differences therein, more attention to national specifics 
is warranted.

With the ease of gene sequencing and the technology available to study and 
manipulate non-model organisms, the extension of the methodological toolbox 
required to translate our understanding of model organisms to non-model 
organisms has become an urgent problem. For example, mining of large coral and 
their symbiont sequence data is a challenge, but also provides an opportunity 
for understanding functionality and evolution of these and other non-model 
organisms. Much more information than for any other eukaryotic species is 
available for humans, especially related to signal transduction and diseases. 
However, the coral cnidarian host and human have diverged over 700 million years 
ago and homologies between proteins in the two species are therefore often in 
the gray zone, or at least often undetectable with traditional BLAST searches. 
We introduce a two-stage approach to identifying putative coral homologues of 
human proteins. First, through remote homology detection using Hidden Markov 
Models, we identify candidate human homologues in the cnidarian genome. However, 
for many proteins, the human genome alone contains multiple family members with 
similar or even more divergence in sequence. In the second stage, therefore, we 
filter the remote homology results based on the functional and structural 
plausibility of each coral candidate, shortlisting the coral proteins likely to 
have conserved some of the functions of the human proteins. We demonstrate our 
approach with a pipeline for mapping membrane receptors in humans to membrane 
receptors in corals, with specific focus on the stony coral, P. damicornis. More 
than 1000 human membrane receptors mapped to 335 coral receptors, including 151 
G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). To validate specific sub-families, we chose 
opsin proteins, representative GPCRs that confer light sensitivity, and 
Toll-like receptors, representative non-GPCRs, which function in the immune 
response, and their ability to communicate with microorganisms. Through detailed 
structure-function analysis of their ligand-binding pockets and downstream 
signaling cascades, we selected those candidate remote homologues likely to 
carry out related functions in the corals. This pipeline may prove generally 
useful for other non-model organisms, such as to support the growing field of 
synthetic biology.

Neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) pose a serious 
health concern worldwide, with a particular incidence in developed countries as 
a result of life expectancy increase and the absence of restorative treatments. 
Presently, treatments for these neurological conditions are focused on managing 
the symptoms and/or slowing down their progression. As so, the research on novel 
neuroprotective drugs is of high interest. Glypromate 
(glycyl-l-prolyl-l-glutamic acid, also known as GPE), an endogenous small 
peptide widespread in the brain, holds great promise to tackle neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's, s well as other 
CNS-related disorders like Rett and Down's syndromes. However, the limited 
pharmacokinetic properties of Glypromate hinder its clinical application. As 
such, intense research has been devoted to leveraging the pharmacokinetic 
profile of this neuropeptide. This review aims to offer an updated perspective 
on Glypromate research by exploring the vast array of chemical derivatizations 
of more than 100 analogs described in the literature over the past two decades. 
The collection and discussion of the most relevant structure-activity 
relationships will hopefully guide the discovery of new Glypromate-based 
neuroprotective drugs.

Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy increases, the comorbidities related to aging 
require greater attention. Skin aging exposomes were only recently defined and 
need additional delineation, particularly in Skin of Color (SOC) populations.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to shed the light and summarize the existing 
literature on skin aging exposome in SOC populations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an extensive search in the PubMed and Google 
Scholar databases. We included peer-reviewed studies in SOC populations around 
the world regarding one or more of the skin aging exposome factors, and we 
grouped and organized the studies under each factor of the skin aging exposome.
RESULTS: Some environmental exposome factors are preventable or modifiable, for 
example, by applying broad-spectrum sunscreens with visible light protection, 
improving nutrition, and smoking cessation. Other factors such as air pollution 
will require more complex solutions. Our search revealed a paucity of references 
on skin aging exposome factors in SOC populations.
CONCLUSION: We identified the need for more dedicated studies in SOC populations 
to advance knowledge on skin aging exposome factors. This knowledge will provide 
a better understanding of approaches to minimize extrinsic skin aging in these 
populations.

Life expectancy has been on the rise for the past few decades, but healthy life 
expectancy has not kept pace, leading to a global burden of age-associated 
disorders. Advancing age is accompanied by a chronic increase in basal systemic 
inflammation, termed inflammaging, contributing towards an increased risk of 
developing chronic diseases in old age. This article reviews the recent 
literature to formulate hypotheses regarding how age-associated inflammaging 
plays a crucial role in driving chronic diseases and ill health in older adults. 
Here, we discuss how non-pharmacological intervention strategies (diet, 
nutraceutical supplements, phytochemicals, physical activity, microbiome-based 
therapies) targeting inflammaging restore health in older adults. We also 
consider alternative existing pharmacological interventions (Caloric restriction 
mimetics, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors) and explore novel 
targets (senolytics) aimed at combating inflammaging and optimising the ageing 
process to increase healthy lifespan.

ABSTRACTWith early and effective antiretroviral therapy leading to improved life 
expectancy in people with HIV (PWH), PWH aged 50 or older face concerns and 
issues related to aging. Providers at the University of Colorado identified a 
need to assess the healthcare needs of PWH aged 50 and older at the UCHealth 
Infectious Diseases/Travel (TEAM) Clinic in Aurora, Colorado. A survey was 
developed to illuminate participants' general rating of their health, factors 
that made it challenging to get the healthcare needed prior to COVID-19 and 
during COVID-19, and types of healthcare appointments and providers that would 
make a difference in healthcare experience. Descriptive statistics and brief 
thematic analysis of open-ended questions found that most participants rated 
their current health as very good or good. Participants noted that connecting to 
resources and appointment scheduling were the top challenges prior to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, participants described 
challenges with resource connection, communication with providers, and wait 
times. To reduce these barriers, telehealth video appointments, healthcare 
visits with a provider who specializes in aging, and healthcare visits with 
providers who specialize in aging if co-located in the HIV clinic were 
recognized as beneficial resources from the perspectives of participants.

BACKGROUND: The differences in cost and efficacy between dapagliflozin and 
empagliflozin in combination with standard of care (SoC) raise the question of 
which regimen would be cost-effective in treating heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction (HFrEF). This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of 
dapagliflozin plus SoC (dapagliflozin-SoC) versus empagliflozin plus SoC 
(empagliflozin-SoC) or SoC alone for treatment of HFrEF.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
dapagliflozin-SoC, empagliflozin-SoC, and SoC alone from the healthcare system 
perspective over a lifetime horizon. Data on efficacy of dapagliflozin-SoC, 
empagliflozin-SoC, and SoC were obtained from randomized controlled trials. 
Costs were measured in 2022 US dollars, and effectiveness was measured in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Among three strategies, dapagliflozin-SoC was the most cost-effective 
strategy and dominated empagliflozin-SoC in an extended sense. Compared with SoC 
alone, dapagliflozin-SoC and empagliflozin-SoC had incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of $56,782 and $89,258 per QALY, respectively. 
Dapagliflozin-SoC cost more $5524 but yielded more 0.20 QALYs than 
empagliflozin-SoC, with the ICER of $27,861 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness of 
dapagliflozin-SoC, empagliflozin-SoC, and SoC alone did not depend on diabetic 
status. However, empagliflozin-SoC was no longer cost-effective versus SoC alone 
in HFrEF patients without CKD, and dapagliflozin-SoC was not cost-effective 
versus empagliflozin-SoC in HFrEF patients with CKD.
CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin-SoC was cost-effective versus empagliflozin-SoC or SoC 
alone for treatment of HFrEF.

Accurate and up-to-date data on longevity and mortality are essential for 
describing, analyzing, and managing animal populations in captivity. We 
assembled a comprehensive demography data set and analyzed survival and 
mortality patterns in a population of captive former biomedical research 
chimpanzees. The study synthesized over 51,000 life-years of demographic data 
collected on 2349 individuals between 1923 and 2014. Our goal was to assess the 
population's current age-sex composition, estimate rates of survivorship, 
mortality and life expectancy, and compare findings with other chimpanzee 
populations of interest. Results indicated an increasingly geriatric 
contemporary population declining in size. The median life expectancy (MLE) of 
the entire population was 32.6 years (males 29.1, females 36.1). For chimpanzees 
who reached 1 year of age, the MLE increased to 34.9 years (males 31.0, females 
38.8). Survival probability was influenced by both sex and birth type. Females 
exhibited greater survivorship than males (β1  = -0.34, z = -5.74, p < 0.001) 
and wild-born individuals exhibited greater survivorship than captive-born 
individuals (β2  = -0.55, z = -5.89, p < 0.001). There was also a seasonal trend 
in mortality, wherein more individuals died during the winter months 
(December-February) compared with other seasons. Analyses of life expectancy 
over time showed continual increases in both median age of living individuals 
and median age at death, suggesting that these chimpanzees have yet to reach 
their full aging potential in a postresearch environment. As they continue to 
age, ongoing monitoring and analysis of demographic changes will be necessary 
for science-based population and program management until extinction occurs some 
decades in the future.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) impacts effectiveness and morbidity of prostate 
cancer (CaP) treatment, but its impact on cost-effectiveness is unknown. We 
sought to evaluate the impact of LE on the cost-effectiveness of radical 
prostatectomy (RP), radiation therapy (RT), and active surveillance (AS) for 
clinically localized disease.
METHODS: We created a Markov model to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) for RP, RT, and AS over a 20-year time horizon from a Medicare 
payer perspective for low- and intermediate-risk CaP. Mortality outcomes varied 
by tumor risk and PCCI score, a validated proxy for LE. We performed 1,000 Monte 
Carlo simulations with 1-way sensitivity analyses of PCCI within each tumor risk 
subgroup to compare cost/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between treatments.
RESULTS: AS dominated RP and RT for low- and intermediate-risk disease in men 
with LE ≤10 years (PCCI ≥7 and ≥9, respectively). However, AS failed to dominate 
RP and RT for men with longer LE. For men with low-risk cancer and LE>10 years 
(PCCI 0-6), AS had the greatest effectiveness, but failed to dominate due to 
higher cost relative to RP. For men with intermediate-risk cancer with LE>10 
years, AS failed to dominate due to higher cost relative to RP (PCCI 0-8) and 
lower effectiveness relative to RT (PCCI 0-3). The range of QALYs between RP, 
RT, and AS varied <13% (range: 0%-12.9%) while costs varied up to 521% (range 
0.5%-521%) across PCCI scores.
CONCLUSIONS: LE strongly modulates the cost of CaP treatments. This results in 
AS dominating RP and RT in men with LE ≤10 years. However, in men with longer 
LE, AS fails to dominate primarily due to its high cumulative costs, 
underscoring the need for risk-adjusted AS protocols.

Fruit peels are rich source of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols, 
flavonoids, and antioxidants but are often discarded as waste due to limited 
pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications. This study aimed to valorise 
pomegranate and citrus fruit peel into green synthesised silver nanoparticles 
(AgNPs) in order to modify cellulose-based wrapping material for prospective 
food packaging applications and propose an alternate and sustainable approach to 
replace polyethene based food packaging material. Four different concentrations 
of AgNO3 (0.5 mM, 1 mM, 2 mM, and 3 mM) were used for green synthesis of AgNPs 
from fruit peel bioactive, which were characterised followed by phytochemical 
analysis. Ultraviolet-Visible spectroscopy showed surface plasmon resonance at 
420 nm, XRD analysis showed 2θ peak at 27.8°, 32.16°, 38.5°, 44.31°, 46.09°, 
54.76°, 57.47°, 64.61° and 77.50° corresponding to (210), (122), (111), (200), 
(231), (142), (241), (220) and (311) plane of face centred cubic crystal 
structure of AgNPs. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis of AgNPs 
green synthesised from pomegranate and kinnow peel extract showed a major peak 
at 3277, 1640 and 1250-1020 1/cm while a small peak at 2786 1/cm was observed in
