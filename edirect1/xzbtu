[Evaluation and treatment of portal hypertension].

[Article in Czech]

Brůha R, Petrtýl J.

Liver cirrhosis is a serious disease shortening the life expectancy. Unavoidable 
consequence of cirrhosis is portal hypertension, which usually limits the 
prognosis by its complications. Portal hypertension is a prognostic factor for 
cirrhosis decompensation, variceal bleeding and even the mortality in cirrhotic 
patients. In the evaluation of portal hypertension hepatic venous pressure 
gradient (HVPG) measurement is used.Measurement of HVPG is used in clinical 
praxis in these situations: diagnosis of portal hypertension, evaluation of 
prognosis of patients with cirrhosis, monitoring the treatment efficacy in the 
prevention of variceal bleeding, management of acute variceal bleeding. Decrease 
of HVPG below 12 mmHg or at least for more than 20% of initial value in the 
treatment by beta-blockers is associated with the lower risk of bleeding from 
varices or other complications. HVPG above 20 mm Hg is associated with the high 
risk of early rebleeding from varices and can discriminate those patients 
profiting from early TIPS.HVPG measurement is an invasive, but simple, 
reproducible and safe catheterization technique with minimal complication rate. 
The most frequent complication could be incorrect assessment of obtained values. 
HVPG measurement should be a routine technique in centers specialized to liver 
diseases.

[Diabetes: glycemic targets and over-treatment in older patients].

[Article in French]

Deletre S, Coutaz M.

Diabetic glycemic targets in older patients must reflect their preferences, 
clinical status and life expectancy. The presence of multiple comorbidities as 
well as functional or cognitive impairment are better predictors than age alone 
of both limited life expectancy and reduced benefit of intensive treatment. For 
most of these patients, the harms of intensive diabetes therapy outweigh the 
benefits. Our retrospective study analyzing 257 diabetic patients hospitalized 
in a geriatric ward shows a very high incidence of over-treatment and suggests 
the need to review our practices and to adopt individualized treatment goals.

BACKGROUND: The silent information regulator SIR2/SIRT1gene has been 
demonstrated as regulating lifespan in many model organisms, including yeast, 
worms, fruit flies and rodents. SIRT1, the human homolog of SIR2, is considered 
a candidate gene as a modifier of human life expectancy.
METHODS: In the current study we included 616 long-lived individuals and 846 
matched younger controls to investigate associations between 8 common single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (i.e., rs12778366, rs3758391, rs3740051, 
rs33957861, rs7896005, rs12413112, rs11599176 and rs4746720) in the SIRT1 gene 
and human longevity.
RESULTS: The 8 SNPs had strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) and were in an LD 
block, which was characterized by 4 common haplotypes that capture 99.3% of the 
genetic variation present within it. We found no evidence for statistically 
significant associations between the tested SIRT1 SNPs and longevity at the 
allele, genotype or haplotype levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Current findings show that several common variants in SIRT1 are not 
associated with human longevity.

BACKGROUND: Oomph! Wellness organises interactive exercise and activity classes 
(Oomph! classes) for older people in care homes. We investigated the 
cost-effectiveness of Oomph! classes.
METHODS: Health-related quality of life was measured using the EQ-5D-5 L 
questionnaire at three time points; 3 months and 1 week prior to the start of 
the classes and after 3 months of Oomph! classes. Costs included the costs of 
organising the classes, training instructors and health service use (General 
Practitioner (GP) and hospital outpatient visits). To determine the 
cost-effectiveness of Oomph! classes, total costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) during the 3 months after initiation of the classes were 
compared to the total costs and QALYs of the 3 months prior to the classes and 
extrapolated to a 1-year time horizon. Uncertainty was taken into account using 
one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Sixteen residents completed all three EQ-5D-5 L questionnaires. There 
was a decrease in mean health related quality of life per participant in the 3 
months before Oomph! classes (0.56 to 0.52, p = 0.26) and an increase in the 3 
months after the start of Oomph! classes (0.52 to 0.60, p = 0.06), but the 
changes were not statistically significant. There were more GP visits after the 
start of Oomph! classes and fewer hospital outpatient visits, leading to a 
slight decrease in NHS costs (mean £132 vs £141 per participant), but the 
differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.79). In the base case 
scenario, total costs for Oomph! classes were £113 higher per participant than 
without Oomph! classes (£677 vs £564) and total QALYs were 0.074 higher (0.594 
vs 0.520). The incremental costs per QALY gained were therefore £1531. The 95 % 
confidence intervals around the cost/QALY gained varied from dominant to 
dominated, meaning there was large uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness 
results. Given a willingness to pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained, Oomph! 
classes had a 62 %-86 % probability of being cost-effective depending on the 
scenario used.
CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggests that Oomph! classes may be 
cost-effective, but further evidence is needed about its impact on 
health-related quality of life and health service use.

AIM: To investigate the trends in the utilization of nuclear medicine procedures 
and radiopharmaceuticals in an aging population and to establish the prediction 
models.
METHODS: Based on Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, a 
longitudinal study was conducted from 2000 to 2012. Descriptive statistics were 
adopted to analyze the frequencies and distributions of nuclear medicine 
procedures. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to establish the 
prediction model for the utilization of nuclear medicine.
RESULTS: The utilization of myocardial perfusion imaging increased most 
significantly, i.e. 250 per million population (pmp) increment annually, 
followed by the whole-body bone scan (176 pmp) and whole-body PET scan (100 pmp) 
in Taiwan during the period of 2000-2012. The use rate of nuclear medicine 
procedure which the first quartile (Q1) of age at examination above 35 years 
fits the regression model: Use rate expected year = 0.03 Q1 of age at 
examination × use rate baseline year + 14797 life expectancy expected year / 
life expectancy baseline year - 15030. Adversely, the use rate of procedure 
which Q1 of age at examination below 35 years fits the model: Use rate expected 
year = 0.01 Q1 of age at examination × use rate baseline year - 4565 life 
expectancy expected year / life expectancy baseline year + 4749. In addition, 
the similar models were found in the applications of radiopharmaceuticals.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the age at examination and life expectancy 
can be used to predict the utilities of nuclear medicine procedures and 
radiopharmaceuticals in an aging population. Nuclear medicine practice applied 
in the geriatrics would increase significantly with the aging of population.

Modulation of Energy Intake and Expenditure Due to Habitual Physical Exercise.

BACKGROUND: The 20th and 21st centuries are marked by an increase in life 
expectancy on one hand and on the other hand by the increase of so called 
civilization diseases. Their share one common trait: the energy metabolism 
imbalance, with low energy expenditure and high energy uptake. Our age can be 
viewed as the age of inactivity and wealth.
METHODS: The aim of the present review is to highlight the influence of habitual 
physical activity on energy metabolism and balance.
RESULTS: Energy balance is the difference between energy intake and energy 
expenditure, where energy expenditure further divides into resting metabolic 
rate, thermic effect of feeding and energy used by physical activity. In general 
population, resting metabolic rate remains constant and proportional to muscle 
body mass. Muscle mass increases with exercise, especially resistance exercise, 
concomitantly with increasing energy expenditure. The effect of exercise on 
appetite is very strong, proportional to exercise intensity. An acute bout of 
aerobic exercise suppresses appetite by decreasing ghrelin plasma levels, and 
increasing gut hormones. Different subgroups of patients respond differently to 
the same exercise or habitual activity and have thus distinct effects on energy 
balance. Different myokines plasma levels after exercise could explain these 
different reactions although most of their effect is still unclear.
CONCLUSION: Physical activity plays an important role in the prevention and 
treatment of many disorders, like obesity, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, 
dyslipidaemia, hypertension, coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, psychiatric 
and neurologic disorders. It is evident, that physical activity has an effect 
not only on energy balance but also has a direct effect on other body organ via 
its own molecules - myokines. The pharmacological effect of myokines gives hope 
that one day we could have a "myokine drug" that could be used in patients who 
are unable to exercise. Until then we should use our 
&amp;quot;muscle-pharmacy&amp;quot; and try to convince also our patients to use 
theirs. Physical activity makes a huge impact on human health.

BACKGROUND: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common type of lymphoid 
cancer in Western Europe.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost utility of 
rituximab-bendamustine treatment compared with R-CHOP (rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) treatment as a 
first-line therapy for patients with advanced FL in Spain.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost effectiveness of 
rituximab-bendamustine compared with R-CHOP as first-line treatment for patients 
with advanced FL in the Spanish National Health System (NHS). Transitions 
between health states (progression-free, including induction and maintenance; 
first relapse; second relapse; and death) were allowed for the patient cohort in 
4-week-long cycles. Clinical data for the extrapolation of progression-free 
survival curves were obtained from randomized trials. Mortality rates and 
utilities were obtained from the literature. Outcomes were measured as 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The total costs (€, 2013) included drug 
costs (ex-factory prices with mandatory deductions), disease management costs 
and adverse event-associated costs. Costs and outcomes were discounted at a 3 % 
annual rate. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed using 10,000 Monte 
Carlo simulations to assess the model robustness.
RESULTS: Treatment and administration costs during the induction phase were 
higher for rituximab-bendamustine (€17,671) than for R-CHOP (€11,850). At the 
end of the 25-year period, the rituximab-bendamustine first-line strategy had a 
total cost of €68,357 compared with €69,528 for R-CHOP. Health benefits were 
higher for rituximab-bendamustine treatment (10.31 QALYs) than for R-CHOP 
treatment (9.82 QALYs). In the probabilistic analysis, rituximab-bendamustine 
was the dominant strategy over treatment with R-CHOP in 53.4 % of the 
simulations.
CONCLUSION: First-line therapy with rituximab-bendamustine in FL patients was 
the dominant strategy over treatment with R-CHOP; it showed cost savings and 
higher health benefits for the Spanish NHS.

BACKGROUND: Active surveillance (AS) has become a well-accepted and widely used 
treatment strategy.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term safety of AS for men with screen-detected 
prostate cancer (PCa).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: All men with screen-detected PCa who had very 
low-, low-, or intermediate-risk PCa and were managed with AS (January 1, 1995 
to December 31, 2014) in the Göteborg screening trial.
INTERVENTION: Prostate-specific antigen tests every 3-12 mo, rebiopsies in cases 
of clinical progression, and every 2-3 yr in men with stable disease. Triggers 
for intervention were disease progression (prostate-specific antigen, grade, 
and/or stage) or patient initiative.
OUTCOMES MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Treatment-free, failure-free, 
PCa-specific, and overall survival. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional 
hazards models were used.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Four-hundred and seventy-four men were managed with AS 
(median age at diagnosis 66.0 yr, median follow-up 8.0 yr). Two-hundred and two 
men discontinued AS and initiated treatment. The 10-yr and 15-yr treatment-free 
survival was 47% and 34%, respectively. The hazard ratio for the treatment for 
low- and intermediate-risk PCa, compared with very low risk, was 1.4 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.94) and 1.6 (95% CI 1.13-2.25). Fifty-four men 
failed AS. The 10-yr and 15-year failure-free survival was 87% and 72%, 
respectively. These estimates were 94% and 88% for the very low-risk group, 85% 
and 77% for the low-risk group, and 73% and 40% for the intermediate-risk group. 
The hazard ratio for failure for low- and intermediate-risk PCa, compared with 
very low-risk, was 2.2 (95% CI 1.05-4.47) and 4.8 (95% CI 2.44-9.33). Six men 
died from PCa and none had very low-risk PCa. The 10-yr and 15-yr PCa-specific 
survival was 99.5% and 96%, respectively. These estimates were 100% for the very 
low-risk group, 100% and 94% for the low-risk group, and 98% and 90% for the 
intermediate-risk group. No predefined protocol was used.
CONCLUSIONS: AS is safe for men with very low-risk PCa, but for men with low- 
and intermediate-risk PCa, AS carries a risk of missing the possibility of being 
able to cure the cancer. It is questionable whether men who are not in the 
lowest tumor risk group and who have a long remaining life expectancy are 
suitable candidates for this strategy.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Long-term results from this study indicate that some men will 
miss their chance of cure with active surveillance and it is questionable 
whether active surveillance is a suitable strategy for men who are not in the 
lowest tumor risk group and who have a very long remaining life expectancy.

PURPOSE: We assessed the year-to-year consistency of outcomes in patients with 
urinary incontinence due to neurogenic detrusor overactivity who completed 
4 years of onabotulinumtoxinA treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients who completed a 52-week phase 3 trial 
of onabotulinumtoxinA for urinary incontinence could enter a 3-year open label 
extension study of onabotulinumtoxinA 200 or 300 U administered as needed for 
symptom control. This analysis focused on 227 patients who completed the 4-year 
study. Outcomes assessed by year of treatment included mean treatments per year, 
mean change from baseline at week 6 in urinary incontinence episodes per day and 
the I-QOL (Incontinence Quality of Life) total summary score, the proportion of 
patients with 50% or greater and 100% reductions in urinary incontinence 
episodes per day, duration of effect and adverse events.
RESULTS: Patients reported 4.3 urinary incontinence episodes per day at baseline 
and received 1.4 to 1.5 onabotulinumtoxinA treatments per year. The decrease in 
urinary incontinence following onabotulinumtoxinA consistently ranged from -3.4 
to -3.9 episodes per day across 4 years. A high proportion of patients achieved 
50% or greater and 100% urinary incontinence reductions in each year (range 
86.6% to 94.1% and 43.6% to 57.4%, respectively). Consistent and clinically 
relevant improvements in I-QOL scores were observed in each treatment year. The 
overall median duration of effect of onabotulinumtoxinA was 9.0 months or 
greater (range 3.0 to 49.2) and 26.0% or more of patients experienced a duration 
of effect of 12 months or greater. The most common adverse event was urinary 
tract infection with no increased incidence with time.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity who completed 4 
years of onabotulinumtoxinA treatment experienced a consistent duration of 
treatment effect and year-to-year improvements in urinary incontinence and 
quality of life with no new safety signals.

BACKGROUND: As health services researchers and decision makers tackle more 
difficult problems using simulation models, the number of parameters and the 
corresponding degree of uncertainty have increased. This often results in 
reduced confidence in such complex models to guide decision making.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate a systematic approach of linked sensitivity analysis, 
calibration, and uncertainty analysis to improve confidence in complex models.
METHODS: Four techniques were integrated and applied to a System Dynamics stroke 
model of US veterans, which was developed to inform systemwide intervention and 
research planning: Morris method (sensitivity analysis), multistart Powell 
hill-climbing algorithm and generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation 
(calibration), and Monte Carlo simulation (uncertainty analysis).
RESULTS: Of 60 uncertain parameters, sensitivity analysis identified 29 needing 
calibration, 7 that did not need calibration but significantly influenced key 
stroke outcomes, and 24 not influential to calibration or stroke outcomes that 
were fixed at their best guess values. One thousand alternative well-calibrated 
baselines were obtained to reflect calibration uncertainty and brought into 
uncertainty analysis. The initial stroke incidence rate among veterans was 
identified as the most influential uncertain parameter, for which further data 
should be collected. That said, accounting for current uncertainty, the analysis 
of 15 distinct prevention and treatment interventions provided a robust 
conclusion that hypertension control for all veterans would yield the largest 
gain in quality-adjusted life years.
CONCLUSIONS: For complex health care models, a mixed approach was applied to 
examine the uncertainty surrounding key stroke outcomes and the robustness of 
conclusions. We demonstrate that this rigorous approach can be practical and 
advocate for such analysis to promote understanding of the limits of certainty 
in applying models to current decisions and to guide future data collection.

Heat shock proteins including the major stress protein HSP70 support 
intracellular homeostasis and prevent protein damage after a temperature 
increase and other stressful environmental stimuli, as well as during aging. We 
have shown earlier that prolonged administration of recombinant human HSP70 to 
mice exhibiting Alzheimer's-like neurodegeneration as well as during sepsis 
reduces the clinical manifestations of these pathologies. Herein, we studied the 
action of recombinant human HSP70 on young and aged mouse mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs) in culture. The results obtained indicate that HSP70 at concentrations of 
2 μg/ml and higher significantly stimulates growth of aged but not young MSCs. A 
similar effect is produced by application of a mild heat shock (42 °C 5 min) to 
the cells. Importantly, responses of young and aged MSCs to heat shock treatment 
of various durations differed drastically, and aged MSCs were significantly more 
sensitive to higher heat stress exposures than the young cells. Western blotting 
and protein labeling experiments demonstrated that neither mild heat shock nor 
exogenous HSP70 administration resulted in significant endogenous HSP70 
induction in young and aged MSCs, whereas mild heat shock increased HSC70 levels 
in aged MSCs. The results of this study suggest that the administration of 
exogenous HSP70 and the application of mild heat stress may produce a certain 
"rejuvenating" effect on MSCs and possibly other cell types in vivo, and these 
interventions may potentially be used for life extension by delaying various 
manifestations of aging at the molecular and cellular level.

PURPOSE: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined as the cessation of 
the ovarian function before the age of 40 years. POI aetiology may be related to 
iatrogenic or endogenous factors and in many cases remains unclear. The aim of 
this review was to characterize the long-term consequences of POI.
METHODS: The available literature regarding the long-term consequences of POI 
from MEDLINE has been reviewed.
RESULTS: Lack of ovarian steroids synthesis has serious consequences for women's 
health. The short-term effects are similar to spontaneous menopause and refer 
mainly to the climacteric syndrome. In a longer perspective, POI affects a 
variety of aspects. It obviously and drastically reduces the chances for 
spontaneous pregnancies. Oestrogen loss leads also to urogenital atrophy. The 
most common urogenital symptoms include vaginal dryness, vaginal irritation and 
itching. The urogenital atrophy and hypoestrogenism interferes also with sexual 
functioning. Patients with POI are threatened by a decrease in bone mineral 
density (BMD). POI women also experience psychological distress and some studies 
have shown an increased risk of neurodegenerating diseases. Overall, POI women 
have a shortened life expectancy, mainly due to cardiovascular disease. Some 
studies have reported a reduced risk of breast cancer in this group of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion there are several well-characterized health risks in 
POI women. With every patient, an individualized approach is required to 
properly recognize and prevent these risks.

Laboratory and extended laboratory bioassays were conducted to determine the 
residual toxicities of various insecticides against two key pests of 
cranberries, Sparganothis sulfureana and Choristoneura parallela (Lepidoptera: 
Tortricidae), and their non-target effects on the predatory Orius insidiosus 
(Hemiptera: Anthocoridae). The effects of nine insecticides with different modes 
of action on S. sulfureana and Ch. parallela eggs, larvae, and adults were 
tested in the laboratory, while the efficacy of a post-bloom application on 
larval mortality and mass of these pests and on adult O. insidiosus was 
evaluated in extended laboratory experiments. The organophosphate chlorpyrifos 
and the spinosyn spinetoram provided long-lasting (seven-day) control against 
all stages of both pests. The growth regulator methoxyfenozide and the diamides 
chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole had strong (1-7 days) larvicidal, 
particularly on young larvae, and growth inhibitory activity, but only the 
diamides were adulticidal. Among neonicotinoids, acetamiprid had stronger 
ovicidal and adulticidal activity than thiamethoxam, showing within-insecticide 
class differences in toxicities; however, both were weak on larvae. Lethality of 
novaluron and indoxacarb was inconsistent, varying depending on species and 
stage. Chlorpyrifos was most toxic to O. insidiosus. These results show species- 
and stage-specific toxicities, and greater compatibility with biological 
control, of the newer reduced-risk classes of insecticides than older 
chemistries.

With the advent of antiretroviral therapy and improved access to care, the 
average life expectancy of patients with HIV infection receiving optimal 
treatment approaches that of patients in the general population. AIDS-related 
opportunistic infections and malignancies are no longer the primary issues; 
instead, traditional age- and lifestyle-related conditions are a growing 
concern. Patients with HIV infection are at higher risk of cardiovascular 
disease, diabetes, hypertension, and some non-AIDS-related cancers than patients 
in the general population. Family physicians need to be knowledgeable about 
screening for and managing chronic comorbid conditions as this population ages. 
Health maintenance, including appropriate vaccinations, prophylaxis against 
opportunistic infections, and routine screening for sexually transmitted 
infections, remains an important part of care. As HIV infection becomes a 
chronic condition, emerging strategies in prevention, including preexposure 
prophylaxis, fall within the scope of practice of the family physician.

Randomized trials have shown marked reductions in low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C), a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), when 
evolocumab is administered. We hypothesized that evolocumab added to standard of 
care (SOC) vs SOC alone is cost-effective in the treatment of patients with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) 
with or without statin intolerance and LDL-C >100 mg/dL. Using a Markov cohort 
state transition model, primary and recurrent CVD event rates were predicted 
considering population-specific trial-based mean risk factors and calibrated 
against observed rates in the real world. The LDL-C-lowering effect from 
population-specific phase 3 randomized studies for evolocumab was used together 
with estimated LDL-C-lowering effect on CVD event rates per 38.67-mg/dL LDL-C 
lowering from a statin-trial meta-analysis. Costs and utilities were included 
from published sources. Evolocumab treatment was associated with both increased 
cost and improved quality-adjusted life-years (QALY): HeFH (incremental cost: 
US$153 289, incremental QALY: 2.02, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: 
US$75 863/QALY); ASCVD (US$158 307, 1.12, US$141 699/QALY); and ASCVD with 
statin intolerance (US$136 903, 1.36, US$100 309/QALY). Evolocumab met both the 
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and World 
Health Organization (WHO) thresholds in each population evaluated. Sensitivity 
and scenario analyses confirmed that model results were robust to changes in 
model parameters. Among patients with HeFH and ASCVD with or without statin 
intolerance, evolocumab added to SOC may provide a cost-effective treatment 
option for lowering LDL-C using ACC/AHA intermediate/high value and WHO 
cost-effectiveness thresholds. More definitive information on the clinical and 
economic value of evolocumab will be available from the forthcoming CVD outcomes 
study.

BACKGROUND: Joint reminiscence groups, involving people with dementia and family 
carers together, are popular, but the evidence-base is limited. This study aimed 
to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of joint reminiscence groups 
as compared to usual care.
METHODS: This multi-centre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial had two 
parallel arms: intervention group and usual-care control group. A restricted 
dynamic method of randomisation was used, with an overall allocation ratio of 
1:1, restricted to ensure viable sized intervention groups. Assessments, blind 
to treatment allocation, were carried out at baseline, three months and ten 
months (primary end-point), usually in the person's home. Participants were 
recruited in eight centres, mainly through NHS Memory Clinics and NHS community 
mental health teams. Included participants were community resident people with 
mild to moderate dementia (DSM-IV), who had a relative or other care-giver in 
regular contact, to act as informant and willing and able to participate in 
intervention. 71% carers were spouses. 488 people with dementia (mean age 
77.5)were randomised: 268 intervention, 220 control; 350 dyads completed the 
study (206 intervention, 144 control). The intervention evaluated was joint 
reminiscence groups (with up to 12 dyads) weekly for twelve weeks; monthly 
maintenance sessions for further seven months. Sessions followed a published 
treatment manual and were held in a variety of community settings. Two trained 
facilitators in each centre were supported by volunteers. Primary outcome 
measures were self-reported quality of life for the person with dementia 
(QoL-AD), psychological distress for the carer (General Health Questionnaire, 
GHQ-28). Secondary outcome measures included: autobiographical memory and 
activities of daily living for the person with dementia; carer stress for the 
carer; mood, relationship quality and service use and costs for both.
RESULTS: The intention to treat analysis (ANCOVA) identified no differences in 
outcome between the intervention and control conditions on primary or secondary 
outcomes (self-reported QoL-AD mean difference 0.07 (-1.21 to 1.35), F = 0.48, p 
= 0.53). Carers of people with dementia allocated to the reminiscence 
intervention reported a significant increase in anxiety on a General Health 
Questionnaire-28 sub-scale at the ten month end-point (mean difference 1.25 
(0.25 to 2.26), F = 8.28, p = 0.04). Compliance analyses suggested improved 
autobiographical memory, quality of life and relationship quality for people 
with dementia attending more reminiscence sessions, however carers attending 
more groups showed increased care-giving stress. Economic analyses from a public 
sector perspective indicated that joint reminiscence groups are unlikely to be 
cost-effective. There were no significant adverse effects attributed to the 
intervention. Potential limitations of the study include less than optimal 
attendance at the group sessions--only 57% of participants attended at least 
half of the intervention sessions over the 10 month period, and a higher rate of 
study withdrawal in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: This trial does not support the clinical effectiveness or 
cost-effectiveness of joint reminiscence groups. Possible beneficial effects for 
people with dementia who attend sessions as planned are offset by raised anxiety 
and stress in their carers. The reasons for these discrepant outcomes need to be 
explored further, and may necessitate reappraisal of the movement towards joint 
interventions.

The Drosophila GeneSwitch system facilitates the spatial and temporal control of 
gene expression through dietary supplementation of mifepristone (RU486). Because 
experimental and control groups differ only by treatment with RU486, confounding 
results from using flies of different genetic backgrounds are eliminated, making 
GeneSwitch especially useful in studies of aging. However, the effect of RU486 
itself on longevity has not been well characterized, particularly in relation to 
nutritional states known to affect lifespan. Here, we show that RU486 has dose- 
and diet-dependent effects on longevity in both sexes. On low nutrient diets, 
RU486 supplementation reduces total food consumption, perhaps exacerbating 
undernutrition to shorten life. RU486 also inhibits proboscis extension 
responses to low nutrient diets, suggesting that RU486 has an aversive taste 
which leads to decreased food consumption and diminished longevity. RU486 is not 
detrimental to fly lifespan on high nutrient food, correlating with reduced 
effects of the drug on palatability and total consumption on rich diets. Our 
results highlight the critical importance of considering how food palatability 
and nutrient intake might be altered by dietary or drug manipulations in studies 
of aging and behavior.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Few studies exist on long-term post-stroke depressive 
symptoms and anxiety in young adults, although these young patients have a 
particular interest in their long-term prognosis, given their usually long life 
expectancy and being in the midst of an active social, working and family life. 
The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms 
and anxiety and their association with clinical and demographic variables and 
with functional outcome after stroke in young adults.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Long-term prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety was 
calculated in 511 patients with a transient ischaemic attack or ischaemic 
stroke, aged 18-50 years, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, 
compared with 147 controls. Functional outcome was assessed with the modified 
Rankin Score (mRS) and the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale (IADL). 
16.8% of patients had depressive symptoms and 23.0% had anxiety, versus 6.1% (P 
= 0.001) and 12.2% (P < 0.001) in controls. In ischaemic stroke patients, 
depressive symptoms and anxiety were associated with poor functional outcome 
(mRS > 2 or IADL < 8).
CONCLUSION: Even a decade after stroke at young age, depressive symptoms and 
anxiety were prevalent and associated with poor functional outcome. Therefore, 
even in the long term, treating physicians should be aware of the long-term 
presence of these symptoms as their recognition may be the first step in 
improving long-term functional independence.

MPMV has great potential for development as a vector for gene therapy. In this 
respect, precisely defining the sequences and structural motifs that are 
important for dimerization and packaging of its genomic RNA (gRNA) are of utmost 
importance. A distinguishing feature of the MPMV gRNA packaging signal is two 
phylogenetically conserved long-range interactions (LRIs) between U5 and gag 
complementary sequences, LRI-I and LRI-II. To test their biological significance 
in the MPMV life cycle, we introduced mutations into these structural motifs and 
tested their effects on MPMV gRNA packaging and propagation. Furthermore, we 
probed the structure of key mutants using SHAPE (selective 2'hydroxyl acylation 
analyzed by primer extension). Disrupting base-pairing of the LRIs affected gRNA 
packaging and propagation, demonstrating their significance to the MPMV life 
cycle. A double mutant restoring a heterologous LRI-I was fully functional, 
whereas a similar LRI-II mutant failed to restore gRNA packaging and 
propagation. These results demonstrate that while LRI-I acts at the structural 
level, maintaining base-pairing is not sufficient for LRI-II function. In 
addition, in vitro RNA dimerization assays indicated that the loss of RNA 
packaging in LRI mutants could not be attributed to the defects in dimerization. 
Our findings suggest that U5-gag LRIs play an important architectural role in 
maintaining the structure of the 5' region of the MPMV gRNA, expanding the 
crucial role of LRIs to the nonlentiviral group of retroviruses.

There are two main bioengineering approaches to extending the half-life of 
factor (F)VIII or FIX products used for hemophilia replacement therapy. These 
are fusion to Fc-immunoglobulin G (FVIII and FIX) or to albumin (FIX) or 
pegylation/glycopegylation (FVIII and FIX). Four FVIII and three FIX products 
are in clinical development or have recently been licensed in regions of the 
world. The reported half-life extension is approximately 1.5-fold for FVIII and 
2.5-fold, or even longer, for FIX. Clinical trials have shown promising results 
with respect to extension of dose intervals and efficacy in the treatment and 
prevention of bleeding events. The role of these products in clinical practice 
has been discussed in terms of either improving convenience and adherence 
through prolongation of the interval between infusions or maintaining current 
intervals thereby increasing trough levels and the safety margin against bleeds. 
This review of extended half-life products addresses the possibilities and 
problems of their introduction in hemophilia treatment.
