develop a proof of concept demonstrating that the mechanical properties measured 
from pacemaker extensions and leads extracted posthumously of known duration, 
measured in months while in vivo, can be used to predict the duration of DBS 
leads of unknown lifespan. The goal is to explore the validity of the proposed 
model using multiple regression of mechanical properties.

Background and Objectives: This study focused on investigating sarcopenic 
factors and immune cells in older adulthood. To achieve this, the variables 
related to sarcopenia and immune cells in people living in the same community 
were analyzed. Materials and Methods: A total of 433 elderly individuals aged 61 
to 85 years were randomly categorized as follows in 5-year intervals: 68 in the 
youngest-old group (aged 61-65), 168 in the young-old group (aged 66-70), 127 in 
the middle-old group (aged 71-75), 46 in the old-old group (aged 76-80), and 19 
in the oldest-old group (aged 81-85). Results: With the progression of age, calf 
circumference (-8.4 to -11.05%; p = 0.001) and grip strength (-9.32 to -21.01%; 
p = 0.001) exhibited a noticeable reduction with each successive 5-year age 
bracket. Conversely, the capability to complete the five-time chair stand 
demonstrated a clear incline (32.49 to 56.81%; p = 0.001), starting from the 
middle-aged group. As for appendicular skeletal muscle mass, there was an 
evident tendency for it to decrease (-7.08 to -26.62%; p = 0.001) with 
increasing age. A gradual decline in natural killer cells became apparent within 
the old-old and oldest-old groups (-9.28 to -26.27%; p = 0.001). The results of 
the post hoc test revealed that CD3 T cells showcased their peak levels in both 
the youngest-old and young-old groups. This was followed by the middle-old and 
old-old groups, with slightly lower levels. This pattern was similarly observed 
in CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and CD19 B cells. Conclusions: This study 
reaffirmed that sarcopenia and immune cell function decline with each successive 
5-year increase in age. Considering these findings, the importance of 
implementing programs aimed at ensuring a high-quality extension of life for the 
elderly is strongly underscored.

Stroke during pregnancy and preeclampsia are two distinct but interrelated 
medical conditions, sharing a common denominator-blood control failure. Along 
with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypercoagulability, 
hypertension is undoubtedly a major risk factor associated with stroke. Even 
though men have higher age-specific stroke rates, women are facing higher 
life-long stroke risk, primarily due to longer life expectancy. Sex hormones, 
especially estrogen and testosterone, seem to play a key link in the chain of 
blood pressure control differences between the genders. Women affected with 
stroke are more susceptible to experience some atypical stroke manifestations, 
which might eventually lead to delayed diagnosis establishment, and result in 
higher morbidity and mortality rates in the population of women. Preeclampsia is 
a part of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy spectrum, and it is common 
knowledge that women with a positive history of preeclampsia are at increased 
stroke risk during their lifetime. Preeclampsia and stroke display similar 
pathophysiological patterns, including hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, 
dyslipidemia, hypercoagulability, and cerebral vasomotor reactivity 
abnormalities. High-risk pregnancies carrying the burden of hypertensive 
disorder of pregnancy have up to a six-fold higher chance of suffering from 
stroke. Resemblance shared between placental and cerebral vascular changes, 
adaptations, and sophisticated auto-regulatory mechanisms are not merely 
coincidental, but they reflect distinctive and complex cardiovascular 
performances occurring in the maternal circulatory system during pregnancy. 
Placental and cerebral malperfusion appears to be in the midline of both of 
these conditions; placental malperfusion eventually leads to preeclampsia, and 
cerebral to stoke. Suboptimal performances of the cardiovascular system are 
proposed as a primary cause of uteroplacental malperfusion. Placental 
dysfunction is therefore designated as a secondary condition, initiated by the 
primary disturbances of the cardiovascular system, rather than an immunological 
disorder associated with abnormal trophoblast invasion. In most cases, with 
properly and timely applied measures of prevention, stroke is predictable, and 
preeclampsia is a controllable condition. Understanding the differences between 
preeclampsia and stroke in pregnancy is vital for healthcare providers to 
enhance their clinical decision-making strategies, improve patient care, and 
promote positive maternal and pregnancy outcomes. Management approaches for 
preeclampsia and stroke require a multidisciplinary approach involving 
obstetricians, neurologists, and other healthcare professionals.

Particularities of Urinary Tract Infections in Diabetic Patients: A Concise 
Review.

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that, untreated or poorly controlled, can 
lead to serious complications, reducing life expectancy and quality. Diabetic 
patients are more likely to develop infections, including many common 
infections, but also pathognomonic ones such as emphysematous pyelonephritis, 
malignant otitis externa, mucormycosis and Fournier's gangrene. Considering the 
fact that diabetic patients experience more frequently urinary tract infections 
(UTIs) with a worse prognosis than non-diabetic people, we conducted a review 
study based on data in the literature, following the particularities of UTIs in 
this group of patients, the risk factors, the mechanisms involved and the 
challenges in their management. The findings highlight that UTI in diabetic 
patients have some particularities, including a more frequent evolution to 
bacteremia, increased hospitalizations, and elevated rates of recurrence and 
mortality than non-diabetic patients. The possible risk factors identified seem 
to be female gender, pregnancy, older age, UTI in the previous six months, poor 
glycemic control and duration of diabetes. The mechanisms involved are related 
to glucosuria and bladder dysfunction, factors related to bacterial strains and 
host response. The bacterial strains involved in UTIs in diabetic patients and 
their antibiotic susceptibility profile are, with some exceptions, similar to 
those in non-diabetic people; however, the antimicrobial agents should be 
carefully chosen and the duration of the treatment should be as those required 
for a complicated UTI. The data related to the risk of developing UTIs in 
patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors, a new class of oral hypoglycaemic 
agents with cardiovascular and renal benefits, are controversial; overall, it 
was evidenced that UTIs occurred at the initiation of the treatment, recurrent 
infection was uncommon and the majority of UTIs responded to treatment with 
standard antibiotics. Moreover, interruption or discontinuation of SGLT-2 
inhibitor as a result of UTI was rare and SGLT-2 inhibitors did not increase the 
risk of severe infections such as urosepsis and pyelonephritis.

Chitooligosaccharide (CHOS), a depolymerized chitosan, can be prepared via 
physical, chemical, and enzymatic hydrolysis, or a combination of these 
techniques. The superior properties of CHOS have attracted attention as 
alternative additives or bioactive compounds for various food and biomedical 
applications. To increase the bioactivities of a CHOS, its derivatives have been 
prepared via different methods and were characterized using various analytical 
methods including FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. CHOS derivatives such as 
carboxylated CHOS, quaternized CHOS, and others showed their potential as potent 
anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, neuroprotective, and anti-cancer agents, which 
could further be used for human health benefits. Moreover, enhanced 
antibacterial and antioxidant bioactivities, especially for a CHOS-polyphenol 
conjugate, could play a profound role in shelf-life extension and the safety 
assurance of perishable foods via the inhibition of spoilage microorganisms and 
pathogens and lipid oxidation. Also, the effectiveness of CHOS derivatives for 
shelf-life extension can be augmented when used in combination with other 
preservative technologies. Therefore, this review provides an overview of the 
production of a CHOS and its derivatives, as well as their potential 
applications in food as either additives or nutraceuticals. Furthermore, it 
revisits recent advancements in translational research and in vivo studies on 
CHOS and its derivatives in the medical-related field.

The continuing increase in patient numbers and improvement in healthcare 
provisions of HIV services in the UK, alongside the effectiveness of combined 
antiretroviral therapy (cART), has resulted in increasing numbers of the ageing 
population among people living with HIV (PLWH). It is expected that 
geriatricians will need to deal with many older people living with HIV (OPLWH) 
as life expectancy increases. Therefore, geriatric syndromes in OPLWH will be 
similar to the normal population, such as falls, cognitive decline, frailty, 
dementia, hypertension, diabetes and polypharmacy. The increase in the long-term 
use of cART, diabetes, dyslipidaemia and hypertension may lead to high 
prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The treatment of such conditions may 
lead to polypharmacy and may increase the risk of cART drug-drug interactions. 
In addition, the risk of developing infection and cancer is high. OPLWH may 
develop an early onset of low bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporosis and 
fractures. In this review, we have also provided potential psychosocial aspects 
of an ageing population with HIV, addressing issues such as depression, stigma, 
isolation and the need for comprehensive medical and psychosocial care through 
an interdisciplinary team in a hospital or community setting. OPLWH have a 
relatively high burden of physical, psychological, and spiritual needs and 
social difficulties, which require palliative care. The holistic type of 
palliative care that will improve physical, emotional and psychological 
wellbeing is discussed in this review.

Lung cancers with ALK rearrangement represent less than 5% of all lung cancers. 
ALK inhibitors are currently used to treat first-line metastatic non-small cell 
lung cancer with ALK rearrangement. Compared to chemotherapy, ALK inhibitors 
have improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and quality of life 
for patients. The results of several phase 3 studies with a follow-up of over 6 
years suggest that the life expectancy of these patients treated with targeted 
therapies is significantly higher than 5 years and could approach 10 years. 
Nevertheless, these treatments induce haematological toxicities, including 
neutropenia. Few data are available on neutropenia induced by ALK inhibitors and 
on the pathophysiological mechanism and therapeutic adaptations necessary to 
continue the treatment. Given the high efficacy of these treatments, managing 
side effects to avoid treatment interruptions is essential. Here, we have 
reviewed the data from published clinical studies and case reports to provide an 
overview of neutropenia induced by ALK inhibitors.

Glioblastomas (GBs) are incurable brain tumors. The persistence of aggressive 
stem-like tumor cells after cytotoxic treatments compromises therapeutic 
efficacy, leading to GBM recurrence. Forcing the GBM cells to irreversibly 
abandon their aggressive stem-like phenotype may offer an alternative to 
conventional cytotoxic treatments. Here, we show that the RNA binding protein 
CELF2 is strongly expressed in mitotic and OLIG2-positive GBM cells, while it is 
downregulated in differentiated and non-mitotic cells by miR-199a-3p, 
exemplifying GBM intra-tumor heterogeneity. Using patient-derived cells and 
human GBM samples, we demonstrate that CELF2 plays a key role in maintaining the 
proliferative/OLIG2 cell phenotype with clonal and tumorigenic properties. 
Indeed, we show that CELF2 deficiency in patient-derived GSCs drastically 
reduced tumor growth in the brains of nude mice. We further show that CELF2 
promotes TRIM28 and G9a expression, which drive a H3K9me3 epigenetic profile 
responsible for the silencing of the SOX3 gene. Thus, CELF2, which is positively 
correlated with OLIG2 and Ki67 expression in human GBM samples, is inversely 
correlated with SOX3 and miR-199a-3p. Accordingly, the invalidation of SOX3 in 
CELF2-deficient patient-derived cells rescued proliferation and OLIG2 
expression. Finally, patients expressing SOX3 above the median level of 
expression tend to have a longer life expectancy. CELF2 is therefore a crucial 
target for the malignant potential of GBM and warrants attention when developing 
novel anticancer strategies.

68Ga-based radiopharmaceuticals are routinely used for PET imaging of multiple 
types of tumors. Gallium-68 is commonly obtained from 68Ge/68Ga generators, 
which are limited in the quantity of activity produced. Alternatively, 
gallium-68 can easily be produced on a cyclotron using liquid targets. In this 
study, we optimized the GMP production of [68Ga]GaFAPI-46 using gallium-68 
produced via a standard medical cyclotron using liquid targets. Starting from 
the published synthesis and quality control procedures described for other 
68Ga-based radiopharmaceuticals, we have validated the synthesis process and the 
analytical methods to test the quality parameters of the final product to be 
used for routine clinical studies. [68Ga]GaFAPI-46 was successfully produced 
with high radiochemical purity and yield using an IBA Synthera® Extension 
module. Gallium chloride was produced on a medical cyclotron using a liquid 
target with activity of 4.31 ± 0.36 GBq at the end of purification (EOP). 
Analytical methods were established and validated, meeting Ph. Eur. standards. 
Full GMP production was also validated in three consecutive batches, producing 
2.50 ± 0.46 GBq of [68Ga]GaFAPI-46 at the end of synthesis (EOS), with 98.94 ± 
0.72% radiochemical purity measured via radio-HPLC. Quality was maintained for 
up to 3 h after the EOS. Production of [68Ga]GaFAPI-46 was performed and 
validated using a standard medical cyclotron with liquid targets. The quality 
control parameters (e.g., sterility, purity, and residual solvents) conformed to 
Ph. Eur. and a shelf life of 3 h was established. The activity of 
[68Ga]GaFAPI-46 produced was substantially higher than the one obtained with 
generators, enabling a better response to the clinical need for this 
radiopharmaceutical.

A Narrative Review: The Effect and Importance of Carotenoids on Aging and 
Aging-Related Diseases.

Aging is generally defined as a time-dependent functional decline that affects 
most living organisms. The positive increase in life expectancy has brought 
along aging-related diseases. Oxidative stress caused by the imbalance between 
pro-oxidants and antioxidants can be given as one of the causes of aging. At the 
same time, the increase in oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) is 
main reason for the increase in aging-related diseases such as cardiovascular, 
neurodegenerative, liver, skin, and eye diseases and diabetes. Carotenoids, a 
natural compound, can be used to change the course of aging and aging-related 
diseases, thanks to their highly effective oxygen-quenching and ROS-scavenging 
properties. Therefore, in this narrative review, conducted using the PubMed, 
ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases and complying with the Scale for the 
Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA) guidelines, the effects of 
carotenoids on aging and aging-related diseases were analyzed. Carotenoids are 
fat-soluble, highly unsaturated pigments that occur naturally in plants, fungi, 
algae, and photosynthetic bacteria. A large number of works have been conducted 
on carotenoids in relation to aging and aging-related diseases. Animal and human 
studies have found that carotenoids can significantly reduce obesity and fatty 
liver, lower blood sugar, and improve liver fibrosis in cirrhosis, as well as 
reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and erythema formation, while also 
lowering glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose levels. Carotenoid 
supplementation may be effective in preventing and delaying aging and 
aging-related diseases, preventing and treating eye fatigue and dry eye disease, 
and improving macular function. These pigments can be used to stop, delay, or 
treat aging-related diseases due to their powerful antioxidant, restorative, 
anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aging properties. As an 
increasingly aging population emerges globally, this review could provide an 
important prospective contribution to public health.

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a lethal congenital heart disease 
(CHD) affecting 8-25 per 100,000 neonates globally. Clinical interventions, 
primarily surgical, have improved the life expectancy of the affected subjects 
substantially over the years. However, the etiological basis of HLHS remains 
fundamentally unclear to this day. Based upon the existing paradigm of studies, 
HLHS exhibits a multifactorial mode of etiology mediated by a complicated course 
of genetic and signaling cascade. This review presents a detailed outline of the 
HLHS phenotype, the prenatal and postnatal risks, and the signaling and 
molecular mechanisms driving HLHS pathogenesis. The review discusses the 
potential limitations and future perspectives of studies that can be undertaken 
to address the existing scientific gap. Mechanistic studies to explain HLHS 
etiology will potentially elucidate novel druggable targets and empower the 
development of therapeutic regimens against HLHS in the future.

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important food crop in Taiwan, among which fragrant 
rice is highly regarded for its special aroma when cooked. During the storage of 
fragrant rice, the aroma components will change, which will affect the aroma 
quality of fragrant rice. Therefore, headspace solid-phase microextraction 
(HS-SPME) was used in this study, combined with gas chromatography and gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry, to analyze the difference in the aroma 
components of Taikeng No. 4 (TK4), Tainung No. 71 (TN71), Kaohsiung No. 147 
(KH147), and Taichung No. 194 (TC194) fragrant rice. A total of 28 aroma 
components were identified in the four varieties of fragrant rice, and the main 
components were all Nonanal. Among them, TK4 contains a very high content of 
hydrocarbons, including Tridecane and Dodecane; TN71, KH147, and TC194 contain 
mainly aldehydes such as Nonanal and Hexanal. During different storage times, 
the contents of alcohols, monoterpenes, aromatic aldehydes, and furans increased 
with storage time, while the content of aliphatic aldehydes decreased with 
storage time. After storage, the fragrant rice samples showed a tendency for the 
total volatile component content to decrease, with the most pronounced reduction 
observed in Nonanal content.

Throughout history, spices have been employed for their pharmaceutical 
attributes and as a culinary enhancement. The food industry widely employs 
artificial preservatives to retard the deterioration induced by microbial 
proliferation, enzymatic processes, and oxidative reactions. Nevertheless, the 
utilization of these synthetic preservatives in food products has given rise to 
significant apprehension among consumers, primarily stemming from the potential 
health risks that they pose. These risks encompass a spectrum of adverse 
effects, including but not limited to gastrointestinal disorders, the disruption 
of gut microbiota, allergic reactions, respiratory complications, and concerns 
regarding their carcinogenic properties. Consequently, consumers are displaying 
an increasing reluctance to purchase preserved food items that contain such 
additives. Spices, known for their antimicrobial value, are investigated for 
their potential as food preservatives. The review assesses 25 spice types for 
their inherent antimicrobial properties and their applicability in inhibiting 
various foodborne microorganisms and suggests further future investigations 
regarding their use as possible natural food preservatives that could offer 
safer, more sustainable methods for extending shelf life. Future research should 
delve deeper into the use of natural antimicrobials, such as spices, to not only 
replace synthetic preservatives but also optimize their application in food 
safety and shelf-life extension. Moreover, there is a need for continuous 
innovation in encapsulation technologies for antimicrobial agents. Developing 
cost-effective and efficient methods, along with scaling up production 
processes, will be crucial to competing with traditional antimicrobial options 
in terms of both efficacy and affordability.

Chronic, low-grade inflammation has been implicated in aging and age-dependent 
conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, cardiomyopathy, and cancer. One of 
the age-associated processes underlying chronic inflammation is protein 
aggregation, which is implicated in neuroinflammation and a broad spectrum of 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's 
diseases. We screened a panel of bioactive thiadiazolidinones (TDZDs) from our 
in-house library for rescue of protein aggregation in human-cell and C. elegans 
models of neurodegeneration. Among the tested TDZD analogs, PNR886 and PNR962 
were most effective, significantly reducing both the number and intensity of 
Alzheimer-like tau and amyloid aggregates in human cell-culture models of 
pathogenic aggregation. A C. elegans strain expressing human Aβ1-42 in muscle, 
leading to AD-like amyloidopathy, developed fewer and smaller aggregates after 
PNR886 or PNR962 treatment. Moreover, age-progressive paralysis was reduced 90% 
by PNR886 and 75% by PNR962, and "healthspan" (the median duration of 
spontaneous motility) was extended 29% and 62%, respectively. These TDZD analogs 
also extended wild-type C. elegans lifespan by 15-30% (p < 0.001), placing them 
among the most effective life-extension drugs. Because the lead drug in this 
family, TDZD-8, inhibits GSK3β, we used molecular-dynamic tools to assess 
whether these analogs may also target GSK3β. In silico modeling predicted that 
PNR886 or PNR962 would bind to the same allosteric pocket of inactive GSK3β as 
TDZD-8, employing the same pharmacophore but attaching with greater avidity. 
PNR886 and PNR962 are thus compelling candidate drugs for treatment of tau- and 
amyloid-associated neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, potentially also 
reducing all-cause mortality.

A major goal of regenerative medicine of the central nervous system is to 
accelerate the regeneration of nerve tissue, where astrocytes, despite their 
positive and negative roles, play a critical role. Thus, scaffolds capable of 
producing astrocytes from neural precursor cells (NPCs) are most desirable. Our 
study shows that NPCs are converted into reactive astrocytes upon cultivation on 
coralline-derived calcium carbonate coated with poly-D-lysine (PDL-CS). As shown 
via nuclei staining, the adhesion of neurospheres containing hundreds of 
hippocampal neural cells to PDL-CS resulted in disaggregation of the cell 
cluster as well as the radial migration of dozens of cells away from the 
neurosphere core. Migrating cells per neurosphere averaged 100 on PDL-CS, 
significantly higher than on uncoated CS (28), PDL-coated glass (65), or 
uncoated glass (20). After 3 days of culture on PDL-CS, cell migration plateaued 
and remained stable for four more days. In addition, NPCs expressing nestin 
underwent continuous morphological changes from round to spiky, extending and 
elongating their processes, resembling activated astrocytes. The extension of 
the process increased continuously during the maturation of the culture and 
doubled after 7 days compared to day 1, whereas bifurcation increased by twofold 
during the first 3 days before plateauing. In addition, nestin positive cells' 
shape, measured through the opposite circularity level correlation, decreased 
approximately twofold after three days, indicating spiky transformation. 
Moreover, nestin-positive cells co-expressing GFAP increased by 2.2 from day 1 
to 7, reaching 40% of the NPC population on day 7. In this way, PDL-CS promotes 
NPC differentiation into reactive astrocytes, which could accelerate the repair 
of neural tissue.

Changes in consumer lifestyles have raised awareness of a variety of food 
options and packaging technologies. Active and smart packaging is an innovative 
technology that serves to enhance the safety and quality of food products like 
fruit, vegetables, fish, and meat. Smart packaging, as a subset of this 
technology, entails the integration of additives into packaging materials, 
thereby facilitating the preservation or extension of product quality and shelf 
life. This technological approach stimulates a heightened demand for safer food 
products with a prolonged shelf life. Active packaging predominantly relies on 
the utilization of natural active substances. Therefore, the combination of 
active substances has a significant impact on the characteristics of active 
packaging, particularly on polymeric blends like polylactic acid (PLA) as a 
matrix. Therefore, this review will summarize how the addition of natural active 
agents influences the performance of smart packaging through systematic 
analysis, providing new insights into the types of active agents on 
physical-mechanical properties, colony reduction, and its application in foods. 
Through their integration, the market for active and smart packaging systems is 
expected to have a bright future.

Point-of-care testing (POCT) platforms utilizing immunoassay-based microfluidic 
chips offer a robust and specific method for detecting target antibodies, 
demonstrating a wide range of applications in various medical and research 
settings. Despite their versatility and specificity, the adoption of these 
immunoassay chips in POCT has been limited by their short shelf-life in liquid 
environments, attributed to the degradation of immobilized antibodies. This 
technical limitation presents a barrier, particularly for resource-limited 
settings where long-term storage and functionality are critical. To address this 
challenge, we introduce a novel freeze-dry sublimation process aimed at 
extending the shelf-life of these microfluidic chips without compromising their 
functional integrity. This study elaborates on the mechanisms by which 
freeze-drying preserves the bioactivity of the immobilized antibodies, thereby 
maintaining the chip's performance over an extended period. Our findings reveal 
significant shelf-life extension, making it possible for these POCT platforms to 
be more widely adopted and practically applied, especially in settings with 
limited resources. This research paves the way for more accessible, 
long-lasting, and effective POCT solutions, breaking down previous barriers to 
adoption and application.

Demographic changes and an ageing population require more effective methods to 
confront the increased prevalence of chronic diseases which generate dependence 
in older adults as well as an important rise in social expenditure. The 
challenge is not only to increase life expectancy, but also to ensure that the 
older adults can fully enjoy that moment in their lives, living where they wish 
to (private home, nursing home, …). Physical activity (PA) is a representative 
parameter of a person's state of health, especially when we are getting older, 
because it plays an important role in the prevention of diseases, and that is 
the reason why it is promoted in older adults. One of the goals of this work is 
to assess the feasibility of objectively measuring the PA levels of older adults 
wherever they live. In addition, this work proposes long-term monitoring that 
helps to gather daily activity patterns. We fuse inertial measurements with 
other technologies (WiFi- and ultrasonic-based location) in order to provide not 
only PA, but also information about the place where the activities are carried 
out, including both room-level location and precise positioning (depending on 
the technology used). With this information, we would be able to generate 
information about the person's daily routines which can be very useful for the 
early detection of physical or cognitive impairment.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the oncological and functional outcomes of focal 
high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in treating localised prostate cancer 
(PCa), a 3-year prospective study was undertaken using periodic post-ablation 
saturation biopsies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men with two or fewer lesions of grade group (GG) ≤3 PCa 
were eligible for participation. Additional criteria included a 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of ≤15 ng/mL, clinical T1c-T2, and a life 
expectancy of ≥10 years. The primary endpoint was failure-free survival (FFS), 
defined as absence of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) in- or out-of-field on 
protocol-mandated saturation biopsy, no whole-gland or systemic salvage 
treatment, PCa metastasis, or PCa-related death. Results are reported using two 
distinct definitions of csPCa: (i) the presence of any GG ≥2 and (ii) any GG ≥3 
or core involvement of ≥6 mm. Secondary endpoints were functional 
patient-reported outcome measures addressing urinary, sexual, and bowel 
function.
RESULTS: A total of 91 patients were included: six (7%) with GG1 and 85 (93%) 
with GG ≥2. In all, 83 (91%) underwent at least one follow-up biopsy. Biopsy 
attendance at 6, 12, and 36 months was 84%, 67%, and 51%, respectively. The FFS 
at these time points for any GG ≥2 PCa was 79% (95% confidence interval [CI] 
80-88%), 57% (95% CI 48-69%) and 44% (95% CI 34-56%), respectively. Using the 
second definition, FFS were 88% (95% CI 81-95%), 70% (95% CI 61-81%) and 65% 
(95% CI 55-77%), respectively. The 3-year cancer-specific survival was 100%, and 
freedom from metastasis was 99%. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (negative 
predictive value of up to 89%, 95% CI 84-93%) and relative decrease of PSA 
values (P = 0.4) performed poorly in detecting residual disease. Urinary and 
bowel assessment returned to baseline questionnaire scores within 3 months. In 
all, 17 (21%) patients reported meaningful worsening in erectile function. A 
significant decrease of PCa related anxiety was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Focal HIFU treatment for localised PCa shows excellent functional 
outcomes with half of the patients remaining cancer-free after 3 years. 
Whole-gland treatment was avoided in 81%. Early follow-up biopsies are crucial 
to change or continue the treatment modality at the right time, while the use of 
MRI and PSA in detecting PCa recurrence is uncertain.

According to epidemiological studies, constipation has a negative effect on life 
expectancy, necessitating appropriate treatment. According to the 
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), patients who have been taking 
magnesium oxide (MgO) for constipation over a prolonged period, especially those 
with impaired renal function and older individuals, are at high risk of 
hypermagnesemia. Therefore, serum Mg levels, which are often not checked in 
clinical practice, should be monitored in these patients. Thus, to predict 
elevated serum Mg levels and prevent the development of hypermagnesemia, we 
aimed to identify the risk factors of hypermagnesemia, especially in the older 
population. Our study included patients who were prescribed MgO at our hospital 
between January 1, 2014, and March 31, 2016. Patients who did not meet the 
inclusion criteria were excluded and matched to adjust for background factors; 
finally, 35 patients in the hypermagnesemia arm and 140 patients in the 
non-hypermagnesemia arm were included in the analysis. Multivariate analysis 
identified estimated creatinine clearance (eCcr) ≤ 28.2 mL/min as a 
statistically significant risk factor. In addition, MgO dose ≥ 900 mg/day was 
identified as a risk factor for clinical consideration, although not 
statistically significant. Furthermore, the incidence of hypermagnesemia was 
shown to increase to 11.6% for those with MgO dose ≥ 900 mg/day, 27.0% for those 
with eCcr ≤ 28.2 mL/min, and 53.1% for those with both. Hypermagnesemia may 
occur in older patients with eCcr ≤ 28.2 mL/min who take more than 900 mg/day of 
MgO.

Pollen germination is an essential step for delivering sperm cells to the embryo 
sac for double fertilization in flowering plants. The cytosolic Ca2+ 
concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) and vesicle dynamics are critical for 
pollen germination, but their potential correlation in pollen grains is not 
fully understood. Here, we report that [Ca2+]cyt oscillates periodically at the 
prospective germination sites during pollen germination. The [Ca2+]cyt is mainly 
from extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]ext) influx, which implicates the Ca2+-permeable 
ion channel cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 18 (CNGC18). The [Ca2+]cyt 
oscillations spatiotemporally correlate with the accumulation of secretory 
vesicles labeled by a formin protein AtFH5, and disruption of vesicle 
accumulation inhibits the [Ca2+]cyt oscillations. In turn, the [Ca2+]cyt 
oscillations promote exocytosis, which leads to stepwise cell extension during 
pollen germination. Together, these data provide a timeline of vesicle dynamics, 
calcium oscillation, and exocytosis during pollen germination and highlight the 
importance of the correlation of these events for pollen germination.
