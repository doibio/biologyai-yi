Socioeconomic Disparities Do Not Explain the U.S. International Disadvantage in 
Mortality.

OBJECTIVES: The articles examines the contribution of internal socioeconomic 
disparities in mortality to the U.S. international disadvantage in life 
expectancy at birth.
METHODS: Using individual death records from the U.S. national vital statistics 
system for years 1982-2019 and data for other countries from the Human Mortality 
Database, we compare age-specific death rates and life expectancy between 
counties classified into 10 socioeconomic categories and 20 high-income 
countries. We also calculate the number of years of life lost in each 
socioeconomic decile in relation to the comparison set.
RESULTS: There is a clear and increasing socioeconomic gradient of mortality in 
the United States, but the growing divergence in internal mortality trends does 
not explain the rising gap between the country and its peers. In 2019, even 
American women in the most socioeconomically advantaged decile lived shorter 
lives, while only 10% of men in the most affluent decile fared better than their 
peers. The long-standing U.S. disadvantage in young adult mortality has been 
growing and the country's previous advantage in mortality at ages 75 years and 
older has virtually disappeared for all but for Americans in the most affluent 
counties.
DISCUSSION: The similar age pattern of differences in mortality rates between 
each socioeconomic deciles and the comparison group suggests that the underlying 
factors might be the same. The role of external causes (including drug 
overdoses) for middle-aged adults and a slowing down in progress to control 
cardiovascular diseases at older ages at the national level are consistent with 
this pattern.

We examine stationary regimes in granular materials from a dynamical systems 
theory perspective. The aim is to enrich the classical view of the critical 
state regime in granular materials, and more broadly, to improve the fundamental 
understanding of the underlying mesoscale mechanisms responsible for macroscopic 
stationary states in complex systems. This study is based on a series of 
discrete element method simulations, in which two-dimensional assemblies of 
nonuniformly sized circular particles are subjected to biaxial compression under 
constant lateral confining pressure. The lifespan and life expectancy of 
specific cluster conformations, comprising particles in force chains and grain 
loops, are tracked and quantified. Results suggest that these conformational 
clusters reorganize at similar rates in the critical state regime, depending on 
strain magnitudes and confining pressure levels. We quantified this rate of 
reorganization and found that the material memory rapidly fades, with an 
entirely new generation of force chains and grain loops replacing the old within 
a few percent strain.

Although technological advances and clinical studies on stem cells have been 
increasingly reported in stroke, research targeting hemorrhagic stroke is still 
lacking compared to that targeting ischemic stroke. Studies on hemorrhagic 
stroke are also being conducted, mainly in the USA and China. However, little 
research has been conducted in Korea. In reality, stem cell research or 
treatment is unfamiliar to many domestic neurosurgeons. Nevertheless, given the 
increased interest in regenerative medicine and the increase of life expectancy, 
attention should be paid to this topic. In this paper, we summarized 
pre-clinical rodent studies and clinical trials using stem cells for hemorrhagic 
stroke. In addition, we discussed results of domestic investigations and future 
perspectives on stem cell research for a better understanding.

Editorial "Minute Zero: an essential assessment in peri-operative ultrasound for 
anaesthesia".

Comment on
    Anaesthesiol Intensive Ther. 2022;54(1):80-84.

I have attentively read the article "Minute Zero: an essential assessment in 
peri-operative ultrasound for anaesthesia" by Elena Segura-Grau et al. [1]. The 
authors have suggested using point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) as part of a 
comprehensive anaesthetic assessment in the perioperative period. Such an 
extension of the standard perioperative examination aimed at searching for 
pathologies that may affect the intra- and postoperative course performed by an 
anaes-thesiologist seems fully justified and may have a significant impact on 
treatment outcomes [2]. In the "Minute Zero" model, the authors have suggested 
that POCUS assessment of anaesthetised patients should be carried out twice - on 
admission to the operating theatre and before transfer to the postoperative 
ward. The described scheme is based on the well-known eFAST, FATE and BLUE 
protocols (assessment to determine the presence of free fluid in the body 
cavities, basic cardiac assessment, including IVC, and lung ultrasound 
assessment). The examination conducted in the manner specified by the authors 
provides a general but holistic picture of the patient, focused at detecting 
life-threatening pathologies. It is right to include a preoperative assessment 
of the filling of the stomach in the protocol, as the surface area of the 
pylorus found on ultrasound scans indicates the risk of aspiration during the 
induction of general anaesthesia [3, 4]. This may be of particular importance in 
patients undergoing emergency procedures, with gastrointestinal obstruction or 
in those with difficult contact (mainly children and the elderly). In the 
algorithm described, the assessment of bladder filling in the postoperative 
period has been emphasised. This is a huge asset, which is often overlooked and, 
as the authors rightly point out, can cause postoperative delirium, especially 
in the elderly. The authors have developed an examination card that enables to 
document the examination in a simple and transparent manner based on markings of 
the appropriate blanks, which makes the protocol very friendly. The additional 
pros of the publication are the attached sample ultrasound images, which 
perfectly illustrate the ease of diagnosis of basic pathologies.

Females and males often exhibit different survival in nature, and it has been 
hypothesized that sex chromosomes may play a role in driving differential 
survival rates. For instance, the Y chromosome in mammals and the W chromosome 
in birds are often degenerated, with reduced numbers of genes, and loss of the Y 
chromosome in old men is associated with shorter life expectancy. However, 
mosaic loss of sex chromosomes has not been investigated in any non-human 
species. Here, we tested whether mosaic loss of the W chromosome (LOW) occurs 
with ageing in wild birds as a natural consequence of cellular senescence. Using 
loci-specific PCR and a target sequencing approach we estimated LOW in both 
young and adult individuals of two long-lived bird species and showed that the 
copy number of W chromosomes remains constant across age groups. Our results 
suggest that LOW is not a consequence of cellular ageing in birds. We concluded 
that the inheritance of the W chromosome in birds, unlike the Y chromosome in 
mammals, is more stable.

and Management, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston (Portnoy, 
Kim, Pandya); Massachusetts Mental Health Center and Beth Israel Deaconess 
Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston (Keshavan).

OBJECTIVE: Programs for early intervention in psychosis have shown clinical 
efficacy. The authors aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of early 
intervention programs compared with standard care for the treatment of 
first-episode psychosis in the United States.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model integrating published data on clinical 
efficacy, costs, and health utilities was developed to evaluate early 
intervention versus standard care over the lifetime of patients after their 
first psychotic episode. Model input data were derived from meta-analyses, 
clinical trials, and U.S. national data. The main outcomes included 
hospitalizations, employment rate, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime 
health care costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: Compared with patients receiving standard care, patients in the early 
intervention strategy had 3.2 fewer hospitalizations and 2.7 more years of 
employment over the course of their remaining life expectancy. From a health 
care perspective, early intervention had an ICER of approximately $51,600 per 
QALY. From a societal perspective, early intervention saved costs (i.e., yielded 
greater health benefits and had lower costs compared with standard care). 
Results were sensitive to the effect of early intervention on suicide, cost of 
standard care, cost of early intervention, and the effect (relative risk) of 
early intervention on employment. A scenario analysis that excluded the effect 
(i.e., hazard ratio) of early intervention on suicide yielded an ICER of 
approximately $197,000 per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that it is economically beneficial to fund 
early intervention in psychosis programs in the United States. The findings 
indicate that early intervention in psychosis saves costs (from the societal 
perspective) and is cost-effective (health care sector perspective).

OBJECTIVES: People with severe mental illness (SMI) have significant 
comorbidities and reduced life expectancy. The objective of the review reported 
in this paper was to synthesise material from case studies relating to the 
organisation, provision and receipt of care for people with SMI who have an 
end-of-life (EoL) diagnosis.
DESIGN: Systematic review and thematic synthesis.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, HMIC, AMED, CINAHL, CENTRAL, ASSIA, 
DARE and Web of Science from inception to December 2019. Supplementary searching 
for additional material including grey literature along with 62 organisational 
websites.
RESULTS: Of the 11 904 citations retrieved, 42 papers reporting 51 case studies 
were identified and are reported here. Twenty-five of the forty-two case study 
papers met seven, or more quality criteria, with eight meeting half or less. 
Attributes of case study subjects included that just over half were men, had a 
mean age of 55 years, psychotic illnesses dominated and the EoL condition was in 
most cases a cancer. Analysis generated themes as follows diagnostic delay and 
overshadowing, decision capacity and dilemmas, medical futility, individuals and 
their networks, care provision.
CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of high-quality intervention studies, this evidence 
synthesis indicates that cross disciplinary care is supported within the context 
of established therapeutic relationships. Attention to potential delay and 
diagnostic overshadowing is required in care provision. The values and 
preferences of individuals with severe mental illness experiencing an 
end-of-life condition should be recognised.

OBJECTIVES: Autistic people experience poor physical and mental health along 
with reduced life expectancy compared with non-autistic people. Our aim was to 
identify self-reported barriers to primary care access by autistic adults 
compared with non-autistic adults and to link these barriers to self-reported 
adverse health consequences.
DESIGN: Following consultation with the autistic community at an autistic 
conference, Autscape, we developed a self-report survey, which we administered 
online through social media platforms.
SETTING: A 52-item, international, online survey.
PARTICIPANTS: 507 autistic adults and 157 non-autistic adults.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported barriers to accessing 
healthcare and associated adverse health outcomes.
RESULTS: Eighty per cent of autistic adults and 37% of non-autistic respondents 
reported difficulty visiting a general practitioner (GP). The highest-rated 
barriers by autistic adults were deciding if symptoms warrant a GP visit (72%), 
difficulty making appointments by telephone (62%), not feeling understood (56%), 
difficulty communicating with their doctor (53%) and the waiting room 
environment (51%). Autistic adults reported a preference for online or 
text-based appointment booking, facility to email in advance the reason for 
consultation, the first or last clinic appointment and a quiet place to wait. 
Self-reported adverse health outcomes experienced by autistic adults were 
associated with barriers to accessing healthcare. Adverse outcomes included 
untreated physical and mental health conditions, not attending specialist 
referral or screening programmes, requiring more extensive treatment or surgery 
due to late presentations and untreated potentially life-threatening conditions. 
There were no significant differences in difficulty attending, barriers 
experienced or adverse outcomes between formally diagnosed and self-identified 
autistic respondents.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of healthcare inequalities for autistic people requires 
that healthcare providers understand autistic perspectives, communication needs 
and sensory sensitivities. Adjustments for autism-specific needs are as 
necessary as ramps for wheelchair users.

Cardiovascular Mortality Gap Between the United States and Other High Life 
Expectancy Countries in 2000-2016.

Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

OBJECTIVES: Reductions in U.S. cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality have 
stagnated. While other high life expectancy countries (HLCs) have also recently 
experienced a stall, the stagnation in CVD mortality in the United States 
appeared earlier and has been more pronounced. The reasons for the stall are 
unknown. We analyze cross-national variations in mortality trends to quantify 
the U.S. exceptionality and provide insight into its underlying causes.
METHODS: Data are from the World Health Organization (2000-2016). We quantified 
differences in levels and trends of CVD mortality between the United States and 
17 other HLCs. We decomposed differences to identify the individual 
contributions of major CVD subclassifications (ischemic heart disease [IHD], 
stroke, other heart diseases). To identify potential behavioral explanations, we 
compared trends in CVD mortality with trends in other causes of death related to 
obesity, smoking, alcohol, and drugs.
RESULTS: Our study has four central findings: (a) U.S. CVD mortality is 
consistently higher than the average of other HLCs; (b) the U.S.-HLC gap 
declined until around 2008 and increased thereafter; (c) the shift from 
convergence to divergence was mainly driven by slowing IHD and stroke mortality 
reductions and increasing mortality from other CVD causes; (d) among the 
potential risk factors, only obesity- and alcohol-related mortality showed 
age-specific temporal changes that are similar to those observed for 
cardiovascular mortality.
DISCUSSION: The exceptional changes in U.S. CVD mortality are driven by a 
distinct pattern of slowing reductions in IHD and stroke mortality and 
deteriorating mortality from other CVD causes. Obesity and alcohol abuse appear 
to be interrelated factors.

OBJECTIVES: This study examined the association between dog and cat ownership, 
the onset of disability and all-cause mortality in an older population. Dog and 
cat owners take more regular exercise and have closer social relationships than 
non-owners. We further assess the beneficial effects of these moderating 
variables on the onset of disability and mortality.
METHODS: Dog and cat ownership data were collected from 11233 community-dwelling 
adults age 65 years and older. These data were matched with data about the onset 
of disability held by the Japanese long-term care insurance system. Local 
registry data were used to ascertain all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: During the approximately 3.5 year follow-up period, 17.1% of the sample 
suffered onset of disability, and 5.2% died. Logistic regression analysis 
indicated that, compared with a reference group of those who had never owned a 
dog (odds ratio fixed at 1.0), older adults who were currently dog owners had a 
significantly lower odds ratio of onset of disability (OR = 0.54 95% CI: 
0.37-0.79). Our results further show that regular exercise interacts with dog 
ownership to reduce the risk of disability. The association of dog and/or cat 
ownership with all-cause mortality was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Dog ownership appears to protect against incident disability among 
older Japanese adults. Additional benefits are gained from ownership combined 
with regular exercise. Daily dog care may have an important role to play in 
health promotion and successful aging.

BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy will likely lead greater numbers of older 
patients to seek postbariatric body contouring plastic surgery. The impact of 
age on body contouring plastic surgery outcome is undetermined.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 317 postbariatric body contouring 
plastic surgery cases was performed. Patient demographics and operative and 
postoperative data were collected. Patients were categorized into three age 
groups, and univariate analysis examined group differences. Multivariate 
logistic regression analysis assessed independent associations between age and 
surgical outcome measures.
RESULTS: Patients 60 years and older had a higher mean preoperative body mass 
index (30.8 ± 3.6 kg/m2, p < 0.001) and higher rates of hypertension (48.9 
percent, p < 0.001), dyslipidemia (38.3 percent, p < 0.001), and diabetes 
mellitus (17 percent, p = 0.012) compared to the younger age groups. They also 
sustained significantly higher complication rates (any minor complications, p = 
0.004; minor surgical site infections, p = 0.005; minor hematomas, p = 0.007; 
any major complications, p < 0.001; major surgical-site infections, p < 0.001; 
and major dehiscence, p < 0.001). Increasing age was a significant risk factor 
for any major complications (p = 0.005), reoperation (p = 0.02), and readmission 
(p = 0.001). Age greater than or equal to 60 years was a significant risk factor 
solely for readmission (OR, 3.32; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing age was a risk factor for adverse postoperative outcome 
in postbariatric body contouring plastic surgery patients; however, age greater 
than or equal to 60 years in and of itself was an independent risk factor for 
readmission only. These findings may aid plastic surgeons in patient 
consultation and in decision making regarding suitable candidates for these 
procedures.

BACKGROUND: An amputation of the upper extremity not only is devastating for the 
patient's physical, emotional, and social well-being but also constitutes a 
financial stress for both the patient and the health care system. The objective 
of this study was to determine the utility and quality-adjusted life-years of 
hand allotransplantation versus myoelectric prostheses and to compare these 
measures in patients afflicted with unilateral versus bilateral amputations.
METHODS: A survey was administered on bilateral amputees, unilateral amputees, 
replantation patients, and healthy controls. Patient demographics, functional 
patient-reported outcomes, quality-of-life questionnaires, and utility outcome 
measures were calculated for four different scenarios: hand transplantation and 
myoelectric prostheses with or without complications.
RESULTS: Five bilateral amputees, 12 unilateral amputees, nine replantation 
patients, and 45 healthy controls completed the survey. The highest 
quality-adjusted life-years were obtained in the replantation patient group for 
the scenario of myoelectric prosthesis without complications (mean, 34.8 years). 
Altogether, there was no statistically significant difference between hand 
transplantation and myoelectric prostheses (p = 0.36). On subgroup analysis, 
unilateral amputees reported significantly higher quality-adjusted life-years 
for myoelectric prostheses rather than hand transplantation (6.4; p = 0.0015), 
whereas bilateral amputees did not demonstrate a significant difference (-2.4; p 
= 0.299).
CONCLUSIONS: Utility and quality-adjusted life-years do not differ significantly 
between hand transplantation and myoelectric prostheses, except in unilateral 
amputees with myoelectric prostheses, who had higher quality-of-life scores. 
Based on trends from this pilot study, myoelectric prostheses may be considered 
for unilateral amputees, whereas no superiority can be demonstrated between both 
treatments in bilateral amputees.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare neuromuscular disorder with a broad 
clinical spectrum. The most severe phenotype-SMA type 1-is characterized by 
marked muscle weakness also affecting bulbar and respiratory function. Life 
expectancy of children with SMA type 1 is expected to be less than 2 years 
without ventilator support or disease-specific drug treatment. The aim of this 
study was to evaluate parents' perspectives on the process of decision-making 
regarding ventilator support in children with SMA type 1. Fourteen 
semi-structured interviews were performed with parents of children with SMA type 
1 that decided either for or against ventilator support for their child. All 
children were diagnosed prior to the approval of SMA-specific drug treatment. 
Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis was performed 
using a qualitative content analysis approach according to Mayring. Parents 
experienced that they were not adequately informed about the disease and 
treatment options in first informed consent discussions. Especially regarding 
ventilator support, parents perceived that they were not offered ventilator 
support as an actual option for treatment. Regarding the decision of whether or 
not to offer ventilator support, parents reported that their attitude toward 
ventilator support and contact with other affected families or patient advocacy 
groups were more likely to influence the decision than the content of informed 
consent discussions with physicians. Our results underline the importance of an 
interdisciplinary team not only to provide parents with relevant information but 
also to consider the criteria of a patient-centered medicine.

Aim: De novo relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (rrAML) has 
limited treatment options for patients not eligible ('unfit') to receive 
intensive chemotherapy-based interventions. The authors aimed to summarize 
outcomes for licensed therapies in this setting. Materials & methods: A 
systematic literature review identified licensed therapies in this setting. A 
feasibility assessment was made to conduct a network meta-analysis to evaluate 
comparative efficacy. Results: Seven unique trials were identified. Median 
survival months were 13.8 for gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), 9.3 for gilteritinib 
(FLT3 mutated rrAML), 5.6 for low-dose cytarabine and 3.2 for best supportive 
care; transplant rates with gilteritinib and GO were 25.5 and 19%, respectively. 
A network meta-analysis was not feasible. Conclusion: There remains a high unmet 
need in de novo rrAML patients not eligible for intensive therapy, with GO and 
gilteritinib (only FLT3-mutated AML) providing the best current options.

Plain Language Summary: Some patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have no 
response to initial treatment or have a response that is subsequently lost. 
Follow-on treatment options after that initial stage are limited, especially for 
patients who are not able to have intensive therapy, such as chemotherapy, due 
to age, physical or cognitive function, existing comorbidities or symptoms. This 
study aimed to review the published literature to identify data associated with 
treatments that are licensed for use in patients ineligible for intensive 
therapy who do not maintain a response from their initial therapy. The study 
found that the drug gilteritinib was an option for the subgroup of AML patients 
with FLT3-mutated disease with an average life expectancy just under 1 year, 
while gemtuzumab ozogamicin was an option for a wider group of AML patients with 
a life expectancy just over 1 year. Between a fifth and a quarter of patients 
went on to receive a stem-cell transplant after treatment with one of these. 
With limited options, this patient group needs further attention; however, the 
availability of the previously mentioned treatments is promising.

life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: An increasingly popular measure for summarising cancer prognosis is 
the loss in life expectancy (LLE), i.e. the reduction in life expectancy 
following a cancer diagnosis. The proportion of life lost (PLL) can also be 
derived, improving comparability across age groups as LLE is highly 
age-dependent. LLE and PLL are often used to assess the impact of cancer over 
the remaining lifespan and across groups (e.g. socioeconomic groups). However, 
in the presence of screening, it is unclear whether part of the differences 
across population groups could be attributed to lead time bias. Lead time is the 
extra time added due to early diagnosis, that is, the time from tumour detection 
through screening to the time that cancer would have been diagnosed 
symptomatically. It leads to artificially inflated survival estimates even when 
there are no real survival improvements.
METHODS: In this paper, we used a simulation-based approach to assess the impact 
of lead time due to mammography screening on the estimation of LLE and PLL in 
breast cancer patients. A natural history model developed in a Swedish setting 
was used to simulate the growth of breast cancer tumours and age at symptomatic 
detection. Then, a screening programme similar to current guidelines in Sweden 
was imposed, with individuals aged 40-74 invited to participate every second 
year; different scenarios were considered for screening sensitivity and 
attendance. To isolate the lead time bias of screening, we assumed that 
screening does not affect the actual time of death. Finally, estimates of LLE 
and PLL were obtained in the absence and presence of screening, and their 
difference was used to derive the lead time bias.
RESULTS: The largest absolute bias for LLE was 0.61 years for a high screening 
sensitivity scenario and assuming perfect screening attendance. The absolute 
bias was reduced to 0.46 years when the perfect attendance assumption was 
relaxed to allow for imperfect attendance across screening visits. Bias was also 
present for the PLL estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the analysis suggested that lead time bias 
influences LLE and PLL metrics, thus requiring special consideration when 
interpreting comparisons across calendar time or population groups.

OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 
This study aims to synthesize evidence to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
remdesivir (RDV) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in 
England and Wales.
METHODS: A probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted informed by 2 
large trials and uses a partitioned survival approach to assess short- and 
long-term clinical consequences and costs associated with COVID-19 in a 
hypothetical cohort of hospitalized patients requiring supplemental oxygen at 
the start of treatment. Given that it is uncertain whether RDV reduces death, 2 
analyses are presented, assuming RDV either reduces death or does not. Published 
sources were used for long-term clinical, quality of life, and cost parameters.
RESULTS: Under the assumption that RDV reduces death, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio for RDV is estimated at £11 881 per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained compared with standard of care (SoC) (probabilistic incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio £12 400). The probability for RDV to be cost-effective 
is 74% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained. RDV was no longer cost-effective when the hazard ratio for 
overall survival compared with SoC was >0·915.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest that using RDV for the treatment of 
hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is likely to represent a cost-effective use 
of National Health Service resources at current willingness-to-pay threshold in 
England and Wales, only if it prevents death. Results needs to be interpreted 
caution as vaccination was introduced and the SoC and evidence available have 
also evolved considerably since the analysis is conducted.

OBJECTIVES: The use of preventive medication in palliative oncology patients may 
be inappropriate due to limited life expectancy. Deprescribing tools are 
available but time-consuming and not always tailored to this specific 
population. Our primary goal was to identify potentially inappropriate 
medications (PIMs) in palliative oncology patients with a life expectancy of up 
to 2 years using an adapted deprescribing tool. Our secondary aim was to 
identify patient characteristics associated with the presence of PIMs.
METHODS: Oncology patients with a life expectancy of up to 2 years were included 
cross-sectionally. An adapted deprescribing tool was developed to identify PIMs. 
Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with having PIMs.
RESULTS: A total of 218 patients were included in this study of which 56% had at 
least one PIM with a population mean of 1.1 PIM per patient. Most frequently 
defined PIMs were antihypertensive drugs and gastric acid inhibitors. 
Identification of PIMs by review took an estimated 5-10 min per patient. 
Polypharmacy, age >65 years and inpatient/outpatient status were found to be 
associated with having at least one PIM.
CONCLUSIONS: Deprescribing is possible in more than half of palliative oncology 
patients with a life expectancy of up to 2 years. The adapted deprescribing tool 
used is non-time consuming and suitable for palliative oncology patients, 
regardless of age.

Real-time PCR is the most utilized nucleic acid testing tool in clinical 
settings. However, the number of targets detectable per reaction are restricted 
by current modes. Here, we describe a single-step, multiplex approach capable of 
detecting dozens of targets per reaction in a real-time PCR thermal cycler. The 
approach, termed MeltArray, utilizes the 5'-flap endonuclease activity of Taq 
DNA polymerase to cleave a mediator probe into a mediator primer that can bind 
to a molecular beacon reporter, which allows for the extension of multiple 
mediator primers to produce a series of fluorescent hybrids of different melting 
temperatures unique to each target. Using multiple molecular beacon reporters 
labeled with different fluorophores, the overall number of targets is equal to 
the number of the reporters multiplied by that of mediator primers per reporter. 
The use of MeltArray was explored in various scenarios, including in a 20-plex 
assay that detects human Y chromosome microdeletions, a 62-plex assay that 
determines Escherichia coli serovars, a 24-plex assay that simultaneously 
identifies and quantitates respiratory pathogens, and a minisequencing assay 
that identifies KRAS mutations, and all of these different assays were validated 
with clinical samples. MeltArray approach should find widespread use in clinical 
settings owing to its combined merits of multiplicity, versatility, simplicity, 
and accessibility.

Metformin, the most prescribed antidiabetic medicine, has shown other benefits 
such as anti-ageing and anticancer effects1-4. For clinical doses of metformin, 
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a major role in its mechanism of 
action4,5; however, the direct molecular target of metformin remains unknown. 
Here we show that clinically relevant concentrations of metformin inhibit the 
lysosomal proton pump v-ATPase, which is a central node for AMPK activation 
following glucose starvation6. We synthesize a photoactive metformin probe and 
identify PEN2, a subunit of γ-secretase7, as a binding partner of metformin with 
a dissociation constant at micromolar levels. Metformin-bound PEN2 forms a 
complex with ATP6AP1, a subunit of the v-ATPase8, which leads to the inhibition 
of v-ATPase and the activation of AMPK without effects on cellular AMP levels. 
Knockout of PEN2 or re-introduction of a PEN2 mutant that does not bind ATP6AP1 
blunts AMPK activation. In vivo, liver-specific knockout of Pen2 abolishes 
metformin-mediated reduction of hepatic fat content, whereas intestine-specific 
knockout of Pen2 impairs its glucose-lowering effects. Furthermore, knockdown of 
pen-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans abrogates metformin-induced extension of 
lifespan. Together, these findings reveal that metformin binds PEN2 and 
initiates a signalling route that intersects, through ATP6AP1, the lysosomal 
glucose-sensing pathway for AMPK activation. This ensures that metformin exerts 
its therapeutic benefits in patients without substantial adverse effects.
