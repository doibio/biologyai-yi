Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a fatal complication of epilepsy 
in which brainstem spreading depolarization may play a pivotal role, as 
suggested by animal studies. However, patiotemporal details of spreading 
depolarization occurring in relation to fatal seizures have not been 
investigated. In addition, little is known about behavioural and 
neurophysiological features that may discriminate spontaneous fatal from 
non-fatal seizures. Transgenic mice carrying the missense mutation S218L in the 
α1A subunit of Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca2+ channels exhibit enhanced excitatory 
neurotransmission and increased susceptibility to spreading depolarization. 
Homozygous Cacna1aS218L mice show spontaneous non-fatal and fatal seizures, 
occurring throughout life, resulting in reduced life expectancy. To identify 
characteristics of fatal and non-fatal spontaneous seizures, we compared 
behavioural and electrophysiological seizure dynamics in freely-behaving 
homozygous Cacna1aS218L mice. To gain insight on the role of brainstem spreading 
depolarization in SUDEP, we studied the spatiotemporal distribution of spreading 
depolarization in the context of seizure-related death. Spontaneous and 
electrically-induced seizures were investigated by video monitoring and 
electrophysiological recordings in freely-behaving Cacna1aS218L and wild-type 
mice. Homozygous Cacna1aS218L mice showed multiple spontaneous tonic-clonic 
seizures and died from SUDEP in adulthood. Death was preceded by a tonic-clonic 
seizure terminating with hindlimb clonus, with suppression of cortical neuronal 
activity during and after the seizure. Induced seizures in freely-behaving 
homozygous Cacna1aS218L mice were followed by multiple spreading depolarizations 
and death. In wild-type or heterozygous Cacna1aS218L mice, induced seizures and 
spreading depolarization were never followed by death. To identify temporal and 
regional features of seizure-induced spreading depolarization related to fatal 
outcome, diffusion-weighted MRI was performed in anaesthetized homozygous 
Cacna1aS218L and wild-type mice. In homozygous Cacna1aS218L mice, appearance of 
seizure-related spreading depolarization in the brainstem correlated with 
respiratory arrest that was followed by cardiac arrest and death. Recordings in 
freely-behaving homozygous Cacna1aS218L mice confirmed brainstem spreading 
depolarization during spontaneous fatal seizures. These data underscore the 
value of the homozygous Cacna1aS218L mouse model for identifying discriminative 
features of fatal compared to non-fatal seizures, and support a key role for 
cortical neuronal suppression and brainstem spreading depolarization in SUDEP 
pathophysiology.

AIMS: Bridging anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients who need to 
interrupt vitamin K antagonists for procedures is a clinical dilemma. Currently, 
guidelines recommend clinicians to take the stroke and bleeding risk into 
consideration, but no clear thresholds are advised. To aid clinical decision 
making, we aimed to develop a model in which periprocedural bridging therapy is 
compared with withholding anticoagulation in AF patients, for several bleeding 
and stroke risk groups.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A model was developed to simulate both a bridge and a 
non-bridge cohort, using simulated international normalized ratio (INR) values 
for patients on warfarin, acenocoumarol, and phenprocoumon. For both clinical 
strategies, stroke and bleeding risks were included and outcomes were stratified 
by CHA2DS2-VASc or CHADS2 and HAS-BLED groups. Quality-adjusted life expectancy 
was the main outcome considered. Our analyses show bridging to only be 
beneficial for patients with HAS-BLED scores equal or lower to 2 and with 
CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 6 or higher. For patients using acenocoumarol bridging 
may be beneficial starting at a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 7. Post-procedural time to 
therapeutic INR has a significant influence on the results: no significant 
benefit of bridging was found for patients reaching therapeutic INR values 
within 5 days.
CONCLUSION: When deciding whether to bridge anticoagulation, clinicians should 
consider the patient's individual stroke and bleeding risk, while also 
considering the patient's post-procedural INR management. In practice, only a 
small subset of patients is expected to benefit from bridging anticoagulation 
treatment.

The aim of this paper was to investigate the evolution of mortality and life 
expectancy according to dementia in two French populations 10 years apart. Two 
different populations of subjects aged 65 or older included in PAQUID from 1988 
to 1989 (n = 1342) and 3C from 1999 to 2000 (n = 1996) and initially not 
demented were followed over 10 years. Dementia was assessed using an algorithmic 
approach, and participants were considered to have dementia if they had an MMSE 
score < 24 AND a 4IADL score > 1. Illness-death models were used to compare 
mortality with and without dementia and to provide total life expectancy (LE), 
dementia-free life expectancy (DemFreeLE), life expectancy with dementia 
(DemLE), and survival with dementia. Mortality without dementia has decreased 
between the two populations among men [HR = 0.63 (0.49-0.81)] and women 
[HR = 0.67 (0.50-0.90)], whereas mortality with dementia has decreased for women 
only [HR = 0.59 (0.41-0.87)]. Total LE and DemFreeLE have increased between the 
1990s and the 2000s populations (total LE: + 2.5 years; DemFreeLE: + 2.2 years); 
DemLE only slightly increased between the populations (DemLE: + 0.3 years). For 
survival with dementia, an increase in survival has been evidenced (mean 
survival: + 1.3 years) for women only. The improvement in DemFreeLE is 
promising. However, as the duration of life with dementia tends to increase for 
women, efforts to delay the onset of dementia should be reinforced.

Objective: To describe the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
(carboplatin and paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel; P + C) in metastatic, squamous, 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in the US. Methods: A model 
comparing P + C versus C alone is developed utilizing partitioned survival 
analysis. Primary clinical efficacy, treatment utilization, health utility and 
safety data are derived from the KEYNOTE-407 trial and projected over 20 years. 
Costs for drugs and non-drug disease management are also incorporated. 
Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of P + C vs. pembrolizumab monotherapy (P) 
is evaluated via an indirect treatment comparison, for patient subgroups with 
PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) ≥ 50% and 1-49%. Results: Overall, P + C is 
projected to increase life expectancy by 1.95 years vs. C (3.86 versus 1.91). 
The resultant ICER is $86,293/QALY. In patients with PD-L1 ≥ 50%, 1-49% and <1 
the corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are 
$99,777/QALY, $85,986/QALY and $87,507/QALY, respectively. Versus P, in the 
PD-L1 ≥ 50% subgroup, P + C appears cost saving; however, this result should be 
interpreted with caution as there is considerable uncertainty in the relative 
efficacy of these comparators. Conclusions: Across all eligible patients, the 
addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy is projected to approximately double 
life expectancy, yielding an extension to a point not previously seen in 
metastatic squamous NSCLC. Overall, and within all relevant PD-L1 subgroups, use 
of P + C yields an ICER below $100,000/QALY, and can be a cost-effective 
first-line treatment for eligible metastatic squamous NSCLC patients for whom 
chemotherapy is currently administered. In the PD-L1 ≥ 50% subgroup, additional 
follow-up within trials of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and pembrolizumab 
monotherapy are needed to better define cost-effectiveness between these 
comparators.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally. 
Individuals are diagnosed at an advanced stage with limited life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: To explore potential health disparities in hospice utilization and 
length of stay (LOS) in a diverse sample of patients with lung cancer.
METHODS: Demographic and clinical information as well as data for hospice 
utilization and LOS was extracted from electronic health records. Data were 
analyzed using descriptive statistics, χ2 tests, and an analysis of variance 
test.
RESULTS: Data from 242 patients were analyzed. In the sample, 33% (n = 80) were 
Black and 51% (n = 124) lived in a rural county. At the time of data collection, 
67% of the sample was deceased and 36% (n = 86) chose to enroll in hospice. No 
disparities were found for race, age, gender, or rural/urban dwellers in hospice 
enrollment. No disparities were found for race, gender, or rural/urban dwellers 
for hospice LOS. Age was associated with hospice LOS ( P = .004). Those who were 
older were more likely to have a longer LOS.
CONCLUSION: Hospice utilization and LOS were low for all groups with lung cancer 
in a geographically and racially diverse region of the United States. Given the 
rates of mortality in lung cancer, discussions about the goals and benefits of 
hospice care may be beneficial and should be part of an ongoing dialogue 
throughout the disease trajectory.

Objective: We compare population aging in Europe and Asia using a measure that 
is both consistent over time and appropriate for cross-country comparison. 
Method: Sanderson and Scherbov proposed to estimate the old-age threshold by the 
age at which the remaining life expectancy (RLE) equals 15 years. We propose an 
adjustment of this measure, taking into account cross-national differences in 
the exceptionality of reaching that age. Results: Our old-age threshold was 
lower than 65 years in 2012 in Central Asia, Southern Asia, Southeastern Asia, 
and many Eastern European countries. These populations also experienced a higher 
share of elderly compared with the RLE15 method. Our method revealed more 
geographical diversity in the shares of elderly. Both methods exhibited similar 
time trends for the old-age thresholds and the shares of elderly. Discussion: 
Our prospective and comparative measure reveals higher population aging 
estimates in most Asian and Eastern European countries and more diversity in 
aging.

BACKGROUND: Statins are widely used to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
With advancing age, the risks of statins might outweigh the potential benefits. 
It is unclear which factors influence general practitioners' (GPs) advice to 
stop statins in oldest-old patients.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of a history of CVD, statin-related side 
effects, frailty and short life expectancy, on GPs' advice to stop statins in 
oldest-old patients.
DESIGN: We invited GPs to participate in this case-based survey. GPs were 
presented with 8 case vignettes describing patients > 80 years using a statin, 
and asked whether they would advise stopping statin treatment.
MAIN MEASURES: Cases varied in history of CVD, statin-related side effects and 
frailty, with and without shortened life expectancy (< 1 year) in the context of 
metastatic, non-curable cancer. Odds ratios adjusted for GP characteristics 
(ORadj) were calculated for GPs' advice to stop.
KEY RESULTS: Two thousand two hundred fifty GPs from 30 countries participated 
(median response rate 36%). Overall, GPs advised stopping statin treatment in 
46% (95%CI 45-47) of the case vignettes; with shortened life expectancy, this 
proportion increased to 90% (95CI% 89-90). Advice to stop was more frequent in 
case vignettes without CVD compared to those with CVD (ORadj 13.8, 95%CI 
12.6-15.1), with side effects compared to without ORadj 1.62 (95%CI 1.5-1.7) and 
with frailty (ORadj 4.1, 95%CI 3.8-4.4) compared to without. Shortened life 
expectancy increased advice to stop (ORadj 50.7, 95%CI 45.5-56.4) and was the 
strongest predictor for GP advice to stop, ranging across countries from 30% 
(95%CI 19-42) to 98% (95% CI 96-99).
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of CVD, the presence of statin-related side effects, 
and frailty were all independently associated with GPs' advice to stop statins 
in patients aged > 80 years. Overall, and within all countries, cancer-related 
short life expectancy was the strongest independent predictor of GPs' advice to 
stop statins.

Comorbidities Among Patients With Prostate Cancer Upon First Visit to the 
Urology Clinic.

Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; and Sigrid V. Carlsson, Gothenburg 
University, Gothenburg, Sweden.

PURPOSE: To determine whether patient-reported collection of comorbidities 
online is sufficiently accurate to warrant use as part of a physician-reviewed, 
baseline medical history.
METHODS: Comorbidities were collected for a sample of 213 new prostate cancer 
visits to our urology clinic through an online survey (called Baseline Medical 
History) before the clinical encounter. The frequency distributions of 
comorbidities as reported by patients before physician review were compared with 
those documented by physicians for a sample of 298 consecutive patients 
presenting to the same urology clinic before the survey went live.
RESULTS: The overall frequency distribution of comorbidities and life expectancy 
estimates were similar between the two groups. A few comorbidity categories were 
reported with higher frequency in the patient-reported group compared with the 
physician-documented group, including neurologic comorbidities (7.5% v 1.7%; 
difference 6%; 95% CI, 2.0% to 10%; P = .001) and back pain (24% v 13%; 
difference 12%; 95% CI, 4.8% to 19%; P = .001). A similar trend was seen for 
vascular conditions, although the difference did not meet conventional levels of 
statistical significance. Genitourinary comorbidities, including problems with 
urination and erectile dysfunction, were better captured by the 
physician-reported group compared with the patient-reported group (68% v 53%; 
difference 15%; 95% CI, 7% to 24%; P = .001), as were other musculoskeletal 
comorbidities (8.7% v 1.9%; difference 7%; 95% CI, 3.2% to 11%; P = .001).
CONCLUSION: Patients completing a medical history, at their own pace and in the 
comfort of their own home, provide relatively accurate and complete information, 
even before physician review. Patient reporting of comorbidities thus seems to 
be a reliable starting point for the documentation of the medical history in the 
clinic.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological disorder 
worldwide. Approximately 40% of patients with focal epileptic seizures remain 
uncontrolled with antiepileptic drug (AED) monotherapy or polytherapy. 
Lacosamide has been recently approved by the European Medicines Agency as 
monotherapy for the treatment of focal seizures. The aim of this study was to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of lacosamide compared with zonisamide as 
first-line treatment of focal epilepsy in patients with epilepsy aged ≥ 16 years 
to inform clinical decision-making in Greece.
METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was adapted to reflect treatment 
pathways and resource use within the Greek national healthcare system, as 
specified by clinical experts. The model captures time-varying events and 
patient characteristics. Clinical inputs were sourced from pivotal trials and a 
network meta-analysis comparing lacosamide with other AEDs. The model predicts 
disease progression and seizures, relevant and most common adverse events, 
withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse events, and epilepsy-specific and 
all-cause mortality over a 2-year time horizon. Unit costs were retrieved from 
published Greek sources. Health outcomes were measured as quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs); secondary outcome was the cost per seizure avoided. Robustness of 
the results was tested with univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The lacosamide treatment pathway was associated with higher costs (i.e. 
€1,064) and an additional 0.119 QALYs when compared with zonisamide, resulting 
in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €8,938 per QALY gained. The 
sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results are most sensitive to the 
efficacy and utility estimates.
LIMITATIONS: There are a number of limitations which stem from the process of 
model adaptation and lack of local real-world evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Lacosamide is a cost-effective option at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of €30,000 per QALY, representing a valuable monotherapy treatment 
option for patients with focal epileptic seizures in the Greek setting.

OBJECTIVES: -To compute mortality rates and excess death rates for patients with 
serious mental illness, specific to categories of gender, age and 
race/ethnicity.
BACKGROUND: -People with serious mental illness are known to be at greatly 
increased risk of mortality across the lifespan. However, the measures of 
mortality reported for this high-risk population are typically only summary 
measures, which do not provide either the mortality rates or excess death rates 
needed to construct life tables for individuals with serious mental illness.
METHODS: -Mortality rates were computed by dividing the number of deaths by the 
amount of life-years lived in strata specific to gender, age and race/ethnicity. 
Age-specific excess death rates were determined as the difference between the 
study population rate and the corresponding general population rate in each 
stratum. To compute excess death rates beyond observed ages in the cohort, a 
method with documented reliability and validity for chronic medical conditions 
was used.
RESULTS: -For the cohort with mental illness, mortality rates for Black and 
White females were mostly equal, and consistently greater than those for 
Hispanic females; excess death rates for females displayed a similar pattern. 
Among males, mortality rates were highest for Whites, with Hispanics and Blacks 
close in magnitude at all ages. Excess death rates for males showed more 
divergence between the categories of race/ethnicity across the age range.
CONCLUSIONS: -Mortality rates specific to categories of gender, age and 
race/ethnicity show sufficient differences as to make them the preferred way to 
construct life tables. This is especially true in contrast to broader summary 
measures such as risk ratios, standardized incidence rates, or life expectancy.

The negative impact of the environment on methylation/epigenetic marking in 
gametes and embryos: A plea for action to protect the fertility of future 
generations.

Life expectancy has increased since World War II, and this may be attributed to 
several aspects of modern lifestyles. However, now we are faced with a downturn, 
which seems to be the result of environmental issues. This paradigm is 
paralleled with reduced human fertility, decreased sperm quality, increased 
premature ovarian failure, and diminished ovarian reserve syndromes. Endocrine 
disruptor chemicals and other toxic chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, 
plasticizers, to mention a few, are a rising concern in today's environment. 
Some of these are commonly used in the domestic setting: cleaning material and 
cosmetics and they have a known impact on epigenesis and imprinting via 
perturbation of methylation processes. Pollution from polyaromatic hydrocarbons, 
particulate matter <10 and <2.5 μm, and ozone released into the air, all affect 
fertility. Poor food processing management is a source of DNA adduct formation, 
which impairs the quality of gametes. An important concern is the nanoparticles 
that are present in food and are thought to induce oxidative stress. Now is the 
time to take a step backward. Global management of the environment and food 
production is required urgently to protect the fertility of future generations.

BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of epilepsy is accompanied by relevant personal, 
interpersonal, and professional restrictions for patients and their caregivers. 
Specialized epilepsy counseling services (ECS) have been introduced to inform, 
advise, and support patients with disease-related problems.
AIM AND SCOPE: The objective of this cross-sectional, multicenter study was to 
determine the demand, typical content, and outcomes of ECS in children, 
adolescents, and adults in two adjacent German regions of Hessen and Lower 
Franconia. All ECS sites in these regions participated in 2014 and 2015, 
offering a total population of 7.5 million inhabitants.
RESULTS: A total number of 435 patients [323 adults (74.3%), 51.7% female, mean 
age: 40.3 ± 14.7 years and 112 children/adolescents (25.7%), 52.7% female, mean 
age: 9.4 ± 4.6 years] were enrolled at six ECS sites. The most common reasons 
for counseling were general information needs (n = 304; 69.9%), administrative 
help (n = 208; 47.8%), problems with education or work (n = 176; 40.5%), and 
recreational activities (n = 119; 27.3%). In addition, 6.2% reported 
epilepsy-related questions on family planning as a specific reason for desiring 
counseling. Recommendation by the treating physicians was the most frequent 
reason for receiving counseling through ECS (62.5%), and most patients preferred 
to receive a personal consultation (73.1%). Patient satisfaction as measured by 
the ZUF-8 client satisfaction score was high with a mean of 29.7 points 
(standard deviation: ±2.7 points, median: 29.9 points), and 83.9% of patients 
said they would recommend ECS. Disease-related job loss or change in school was 
avoided in 72% of 82 patients. Suggestions for improvement of ECS included an 
extension of service hours (58.6%) and a better availability of more sites 
located nearby (32.8%).
CONCLUSION: Epilepsy counseling services are necessary, valued, and effective 
institutions for people with epilepsy complementing outpatient and inpatient 
care. To improve the care for people with epilepsy, access to and availability 
of ECS should be improved.

In Europe, the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in the elderly 
population (≥65 year old) has declined in the past decades to <4%. Aneurysmal 
degeneration of the aorta is a serious and potentially life-threatening vascular 
disease. Abdominal aortic aneurysms typically develop subclinically and often 
only become symptomatic when complicated by impending rupture. Most AAAs are 
discovered incidentally while investigating for an unrelated pathology. Ruptured 
AAA is the tenth leading cause of death in Belgium (0.32% of all deaths in 
2014). Health-care providers have emphasized the importance of early detection 
of AAA and elective repair when the rupture risk outweighs operative risk (usual 
diameter threshold of 55 mm). Routine AAA screening programs, consisting of a 
single abdominal ultrasonography at the age of 65 years, aim to reduce the 
number of AAA-related deaths. Does population-based ultrasound screening for AAA 
achieve its objective and is it cost-effective? This literature review tries to 
answer these challenging questions.

BACKGROUND: Mental health can help explain how social inequalities impact on 
health. Many current public health challenges are shaped by social, economic and 
environmental conditions that take a mental toll on society.
PURPOSE: This article describes a conceptual framework illustrating the 
psychosocial pathways that link the wider conditions to health behaviours and 
outcomes. It draws out implications of this framework for mental health practice 
that aim to support policy and decision-making on future action to reduce health 
inequalities and presents practical examples of what can be done.
METHODS: This article expands on a report commissioned by Public Health England. 
A narrative review and synthesis of relevant evidence built on existing research 
by the Institute of Health Equity. A conceptual framework was developed and a 
consultation exercise with stakeholders helped to revise and illustrate it with 
practice examples.
CONCLUSIONS: The field of mental health has much to contribute to prevention, 
not just of mental illness but also of physical health conditions and reduction 
of inequalities in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy, especially 
through collaborative public health action.

BACKGROUND: Prevention aiming at smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI could 
potentially bring large gains in life expectancy (LE) and health expectancy 
measures such as Healthy Life Years (HLY) and Life Expectancy in Good Perceived 
Health (LEGPH) in the European Union. However, the potential gains might differ 
by region.
METHODS: A Sullivan life table model was applied for 27 European countries to 
calculate the impact of alternative scenarios of lifestyle behavior on life and 
health expectancy. Results were then pooled over countries to present the 
potential gains in HLY and LEGPH for four European regions.
RESULTS: Simulations show that up to 4 years of extra health expectancy can be 
gained by getting all countries to the healthiest levels of lifestyle observed 
in EU countries. This is more than the 2 years to be gained in life expectancy. 
Generally, Eastern Europe has the lowest LE, HLY, and LEGPH. Even though the 
largest gains in LEPGH and HLY can also be made in Eastern Europe, the gap in 
LE, HLY, and LEGPH can only in a small part be closed by changing smoking, 
alcohol consumption, and BMI.
CONCLUSION: Based on the current data, up to 4 years of good health could be 
gained by adopting lifestyle as seen in the best-performing countries. Only a 
part of the lagging health expectancy of Eastern Europe can potentially be 
solved by improvements in lifestyle involving smoking and BMI. Before it is 
definitely concluded that lifestyle policy for alcohol use is of relatively 
little importance compared to smoking or BMI, as our findings suggest, better 
data should be gathered in all European countries concerning alcohol use and the 
odds ratios of overconsumption of alcohol.

OBJECTIVE: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) comprise an independent, 
sex-specific risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women. This study 
examined the utility of CVD risk models proposed in the 2016 Canadian 
Cardiovascular Society (CCS) lipid guidelines to identify women requiring 
further screening or lipid treatment following HDP.
METHODS: Using data collected from the postpartum Maternal Health Clinic (MHC) 
at Kingston General Hospital in Kingston, Ontario and the Preeclampsia New 
Emerging Team (PE-NET) cohort study, the study investigators used the models 
recommended by the CCS guidelines and the cardiometabolic model of life 
expectancy in each cohort to estimate CVD risk in women after HDP. (Canadian 
Task Force Classification II-2).
RESULTS: Using the 10-Year Modified Framingham Risk Score, all women were 
classified by the 2016 CCS Guidelines as low risk, requiring no follow-up. The 
30-Year and Lifetime Risk Scores resulted in significant reclassification of 
women at risk in the PE-NET control and HDP groups (P < 0.001 and P < 0.0001, 
respectively); 49.2% of women with HDP were classified as high risk, requiring 
follow-up, compared with 14.3% of control subjects. Using the cardiometabolic 
model, median life expectancy was significantly lower and expected onset of CVD 
was earlier in the HDP group compared with the control group (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The 2016 CCS lipid guidelines' risk classification recommendations 
significantly underestimated lifelong CVD risk in the HDP group compared with 
the control group. Women with HDP also had a significant decrease in 
cardiometabolic life expectancy and an earlier predicted age at onset of CVD. 
Early primary prevention in this at-risk population may improve CVD outcomes and 
reduce the future burden on the health care system.

New treatments directly targeting polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (HbS), the 
proximate event in the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD), are needed 
to address the severe morbidity and early mortality associated with the disease. 
Voxelotor (GBT440) is a first-in-class oral therapy specifically developed to 
treat SCD by modulating the affinity of hemoglobin (Hb) for oxygen, thus 
inhibiting HbS polymerization and downstream adverse effects of hemolytic anemia 
and vaso-occlusion. GBT440-001 was a phase 1/2 randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose study of voxelotor in 
adult healthy volunteers and patients with SCD, followed by a single-arm, 
open-label extension study. This report describes results of voxelotor (500-1000 
mg per day) in patients with sickle cell anemia. The study evaluated the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties of voxelotor and 
established proof of concept by improving clinical measures of anemia, 
hemolysis, and sickling. Thirty-eight patients with SCD received 28 days of 
voxelotor 500, 700, or 1000 mg per day or placebo; 16 patients received 90 days 
of voxelotor 700 or 900 mg per day or placebo. Four patients from the 90-day 
cohort were subsequently enrolled in an extension study and treated with 
voxelotor 900 mg per day for 6 months. All patients who received multiple doses 
of voxelotor for ≥28 days experienced hematologic improvements including 
increased Hb and reduction in hemolysis and percentage of sickled red cells, 
supporting the potential of voxelotor to serve as a disease-modifying therapy 
for SCD. Voxelotor was well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse 
events and no evidence of tissue hypoxia. These trials were registered at 
www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02285088 and #NCT03041909.

The modern clinical research on prostatitis started with the work of Stamey and 
coworkers who developed the basic principles we are still using. They 
established the segmented culture technique for localizing the infections in the 
males to the urethra, the bladder, or the prostate and to differentiate the main 
categories of prostatitis. Such categories with slight modifications are still 
used according to the NIH classification: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic 
bacterial prostatitis, Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) and asymptomatic 
prostatitis. Prostatic inflammation is considered an important factor in 
influencing both prostatic growth and progression of symptoms of benign 
prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Chronic inflammation/neuroinflammation is 
a result of a deregulated acute phase response of the innate immune system 
affecting surrounding neural tissue at molecular, structural and functional 
levels. Clinical observations suggest that chronic inflammation correlates with 
chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH) and an history of clinical chronic prostatitis significantly 
increases the odds for prostate cancer. The NIHNIDDK classification based on the 
use of the microbiological 4- glasses localization test or simplified 2-glasses 
test, is currently accepted worldwide. The UPOINT system identifies groups of 
clinicians with homogeneous clinical presentation and is used to recognize 
phenotypes to be submitted to specific treatments. The UPOINTS algorithm 
implemented the original UPOINT adding to the urinary domains (U), psycho-social 
(P), organspecific (O), infection (I), neurological (N), muscle tension and 
tenderness (T) a further domain related to sexuality (S). In fact sexual 
dysfunction (erectile, ejaculatory, libido loss) has been described in 46-92% of 
cases with a high impact on the quality of life of patients with CP/CPPS. 
Prostatic ultrasound represents the most popular imaging test in the work-up of 
either acute and chronic prostatitis although no specific hypo-hyperechoic 
pattern has been clearly associated with chronic bacterial prostatitis and CPPS. 
Use of a digital-processing software to calculate the extension of prostatic 
calcification area at ultrasound demonstrated a higher percentage of prostatic 
calcification in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis. Multiparametric 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) is the current state-of-the art imaging 
modality in the assessment of patients with prostate cancer although a variety 
of benign conditions, including inflammation, may mimic prostate cancer and act 
as confounding factors in the discrimination between neoplastic and 
non-neoplastic lesions. Bacteria can infect prostate gland by: ascending the 
urethra, reflux of urine into the prostatic ducts, direct inoculation of 
bacteria through inserted biopsy needles or hematogenous seeding.
