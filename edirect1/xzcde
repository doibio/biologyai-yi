The Great Recession of 2007-2008 saw the largest period of economic downturn 
since the Second World War or the Great Depression of the 1930s. Recessions, 
however, tend not to have a significant impact on population health. Rather it 
is how society and governments respond to a recession that has a larger impact 
on their populations. The dominant political response to the Great Recession was 
the introduction of austerity programmes aimed at reducing the size of the 
state. In this Commentary, I briefly review the state of evidence on the changes 
in population health during austerity. Although the negative impact of austerity 
on overall population health has been well documented across Europe, there 
remains a paucity of evidence on within-country differences in health. The 
slowing down of improvements in life expectancy, correlated to the level of 
austerity, raises uncomfortable questions as to whether we are beginning to 
transition from the era of consistently improving population health to a new age 
characterised by an instability in population health largely dictated by the 
social and political determinants of health.

BACKGROUND: An increasing proportion of prostate cancer is being managed 
conservatively. However, there are no randomized trials or consensus regarding 
the optimal follow-up strategy.
OBJECTIVE: To compare life expectancy and quality of life between watchful 
waiting (WW) versus different strategies of active surveillance (AS).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A Markov model was created for US men 
starting at age 50, diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who chose 
conservative management by WW or AS using different testing protocols 
(prostate-specific antigen every 3-6 mo, biopsy every 1-5 yr, or magnetic 
resonance imaging based). Transition probabilities and utilities were obtained 
from the literature.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Primary outcomes were life years 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Secondary outcomes include radical 
treatment, metastasis, and prostate cancer death.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: All AS strategies yielded more life years compared with 
WW. Lifetime risks of prostate cancer death and metastasis were, respectively, 
5.42% and 6.40% with AS versus 8.72% and 10.30% with WW. AS yielded more QALYs 
than WW except in cohorts age >65 yr at diagnosis, or when treatment-related 
complications were long term. The preferred follow-up strategy was also 
sensitive to whether people value short-term over long-term benefits (time 
preference). Depending on the AS protocol, 30-41% underwent radical treatment 
within 10 yr. Extending the surveillance biopsy interval from 1 to 5 yr reduced 
life years slightly, with a 0.26 difference in QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: AS extends life more than WW, particularly for men with higher-risk 
features, but this is partly offset by the decrement in quality of life since 
many men eventually receive treatment.
PATIENT SUMMARY: More intensive active surveillance protocols extend life more 
than watchful waiting, but this is partly offset by decrements in quality of 
life from subsequent treatment.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to describe long-term patient survival and 
possible prognostic factors of a group of patients diagnosed with granulomatosis 
with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) hospitalized at the 
tertiary Rheumatology Centre in Vilnius.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 27 patients hospitalized at the 
Rheumatology Centre of Santaros klinikos of Vilnius University Hospital from 1 
January 2001 to 31 December 2015 with diagnoses of GPA and MPA were carried out. 
Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and the 
Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score were collected.
RESULTS: Seven (25.9%) patients during the onset of the disease received only 
oral glucocorticoids and 20 (74.1%) patients took additional medication. The 
BVAS median was 7 (minimum [min] - 2; maximum [max] - 23). The age median was 52 
years (min - 12; max - 75). The overall mortality rate was 18.5%. Mean survival 
time was 126.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 104.5 to 148.6) limited to 
154.6 months for the longest-surviving patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy during past 15 years for AAV patients increased 
from 99.4 to 126.6 months. A high BVAS score at the onset of the disease is a 
bad prognostic factor related to shorter life expectancy. The growth of 
Staphylococcus aureus from nasopharynx might be associated with higher mortality 
rates and relapses in AAV patients.

Cells are extremely complex systems able to actively modify their metabolism and 
behavior in response to environmental conditions and stimuli such as pathogenic 
agents or drugs. The comprehension of these responses is central to understand 
the molecular bases of human pathologies, including amyloid misfolding diseases. 
Conventional bulk biological assays are limited by intrinsic cellular 
heterogeneity in gene, protein and metabolite expression, and can investigate 
only indirectly cellular reactions in non-physiological conditions. Here we 
employ a label-free nanomotion sensor to study single neuroblastoma cells 
exposed to extracellular monomeric and amyloid α-synuclein species in real-time 
and in physiological conditions. Combining this technique with fluorescence 
microscopy, we demonstrate multispecies cooperative cytotoxic effect of amyloids 
and aggregate-induced loss of cellular membrane integrity. Notably, the method 
can study cellular reactions and cytotoxicity an order of magnitude faster, and 
using 100-fold smaller volume of reagents when compared to conventional bulk 
analyses. This rapidity and sensitivity will allow testing novel pharmacological 
approaches to stop or delay a wide range of human diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Dialysis patients aged ≥70 years derive improved life expectancy 
through kidney transplantation compared to their waitlisted counterparts, but 
guidelines are not clear about how to identify appropriate transplantation 
candidates. We developed a clinical prediction score to identify elderly 
dialysis patients with expected 5-year survival appropriate for kidney 
transplantation (>5 years).
METHODS: Incident dialysis patients in 2006-2009 aged ≥70 were identified from 
the United States Renal Data System database and divided into derivation and 
validation cohorts. Using the derivation cohort, candidate variables with a 
significant crude association with 5-year all-cause mortality were included in a 
multivariable logistic regression model to generate a scoring system. The 
scoring system was tested in the validation cohort and a cohort of elderly 
transplant recipients.
RESULTS: Characteristics most predictive of 5-year mortality included age >80, 
body mass index (BMI) <18, the presence of congestive heart failure (CHF), 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), immobility, and being 
institutionalized. Factors associated with increased 5-year survival were 
non-white race, a primary cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) other than 
diabetes, employment within 6 months of dialysis initiation, and dialysis start 
via arteriovenous fistula (AVF). 5-year mortality was 47% for the lowest risk 
score group (3.6% of the validation cohort) and >90% for the highest risk cohort 
(42% of the validation cohort).
CONCLUSION: This clinical prediction score could be useful for physicians to 
identify potentially suitable candidates for kidney transplantation.

Donato, San Donato Milanese (MI).

Complex univentricular heart defects are treated with the Fontan operation that 
consists in the diversion of the systemic venous return to the pulmonary 
arteries. Currently, the operation is achieved through a staged approach and 
with the use of prosthetic extracardiac conduits to connect the inferior vena 
cava to the pulmonary arteries. The improvement of early and late survival 
allowed these patients to reach adulthood, although long-term complications 
remain a relevant problem. Most of the complications are caused by chronic 
systemic venous hypertension due to the lack of a pumping sub-pulmonary 
ventricle. The most frequent complications are arrhythmias, thromboembolism, 
protein-losing enteropathy, heart failure and plastic bronchitis. The 
pathogenetic mechanisms are not completely understood but they are all connected 
to chronic systemic venous hypertension. Quality of life and life expectancy are 
deeply impaired by the onset of such complications and then a strict follow-up 
is required to recognize early sings of complications and to start early 
treatment. The creation of a highly specialized referral center network for the 
treatment of such complications and delicate patients is needed to improve the 
efficacy and the outcomes for the Fontan patients.

Bloom syndrome, also called Bloom-Torre-Machacek syndrome or congenital 
telangiectatic erythema, is a rare genodermatosis characterized by 
genomic instability and predisposition to the development of a variety of 
cancers. Bloom syndrome is caused by mutations in the BLM gene, which induces 
the formation of an abnormal DNA helicase protein. High sister chromatid 
exchanges and quadriradial configurations are diagnostic hallmarks. The most 
prominent features include growth deficiency of prenatal onset, mild 
immunodeficiency, excessive photosensitivity with facial lupus-like skin 
lesions, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypogonadism. The increased risk of 
malignancy in Bloom syndrome leads to a shortened life expectancy and increased 
morbidity in affected persons.

BACKGROUND: Identification of older adults with serious illness (life expectancy 
less than one year) who may benefit from serious illness conversations or other 
palliative care interventions in the emergency department (ED) is difficult.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the performance of the "surprise question (SQ)" asked of 
emergency physicians to predict 12-month mortality.
DESIGN: We asked attending emergency physician "Would you be surprised whether 
this patient died in the next 12 months?" regarding patients ≥65 years old that 
they had cared for that shift. We prospectively obtained death records from 
Massachusetts Department of Health Vital Records.
SETTING: An urban, university-affiliated ED.
MEASUREMENT: Twelve-month mortality.
RESULTS: We approached 38 physicians to answer the SQ, and 86% participated. The 
mean age of our cohort was 76 years, 51% were male, and 45% had at least one 
serious illness. Out of 207 patients, the physicians stated that they "would not 
be surprised" if the patient died in the next 12 months for 102 of the patients 
(49%); 44 of the 207 patients (21%) died within 12 months. The SQ demonstrated 
sensitivity of 77%, specificity of 56%, positive predictive value of 32%, and 
negative predictive value of 90%. When combined with other predictors, the model 
sorted the patient who lived from the patient who died correctly 72% of the time 
(c-statistic = 0.72).
CONCLUSION: Use of the SQ by emergency physicians may predict 12-month mortality 
in older ED patients and may help emergency physicians identify older adults in 
need of palliative care interventions.

The spread of pathogens into new environments poses a considerable threat to 
human, animal, and plant health, and by extension, human and animal wellbeing, 
ecosystem function, and agricultural productivity, worldwide. Early detection 
through effective surveillance is a key strategy to reduce the risk of their 
establishment. Whilst it is well established that statistical and economic 
considerations are of vital importance when planning surveillance efforts, it is 
also important to consider epidemiological characteristics of the pathogen in 
question-including heterogeneities within the epidemiological system itself. One 
of the most pronounced realisations of this heterogeneity is seen in the case of 
vector-borne pathogens, which spread between 'hosts' and 'vectors'-with each 
group possessing distinct epidemiological characteristics. As a result, an 
important question when planning surveillance for emerging vector-borne 
pathogens is where to place sampling resources in order to detect the pathogen 
as early as possible. We answer this question by developing a statistical 
function which describes the probability distributions of the prevalences of 
infection at first detection in both hosts and vectors. We also show how this 
method can be adapted in order to maximise the probability of early detection of 
an emerging pathogen within imposed sample size and/or cost constraints, and 
demonstrate its application using two simple models of vector-borne citrus 
pathogens. Under the assumption of a linear cost function, we find that sampling 
costs are generally minimised when either hosts or vectors, but not both, are 
sampled.

Variations and Trends in Health Burden of Visual Impairment Due to Cataract: A 
Global Analysis.

Author information:
(1)Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Sun 
Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the global trends in health burden of people visually 
impaired from cataract in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) and its 
correlations with national levels of socioeconomic development.
METHODS: Global, regional, and national DALY numbers, crude rate, and 
age-standardized rate of cataract vision loss by age and sex were obtained from 
the database of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015. The human development 
index, per capita gross domestic product, and other country-level data were 
derived from international open databases. Regression analysis was used to 
assess the correlations between age-standardized DALY rate and socioeconomic 
variables.
RESULTS: The global DALY numbers of cataract vision loss increased by 89.42%, 
from 2048.18 (95%CI [confidence interval]: 1457.60-2761.80) thousands in 1990 to 
3879.74 (95% CI: 2766.07-5232.43) thousands in 2015 (P < 0.001). Females had 
higher DALY number 315.83 (95%CI: 237.17-394.4) and crude rate 38.29 (95%CI: 
35.35-41.23) after adjusting for age and country (all P < 0.001). The 
age-standardized DALY rate was higher in countries with low human development 
index (HDI), with 91.03 (95%CI: 73.04-108.75) for low HDI, 81.67 (95%CI: 
53.24-108.82) for medium HDI, 55.89 (95%CI: 36.87-69.63) for high HDI, and 17.10 
(95%CI: 13.91-26.84) for very high HDI countries (P < 0.01), respectively. The 
national age-standardized DALY rates in 2015 were negatively associated with 
both HDI (R2 = 0.489, P < 0.001) and per capita gross domestic product (R2 = 
0.331, P < 0.001). Stepwise multiple regression showed that HDI was 
significantly correlated with national age-standardized DALY rates in 2015 after 
adjusting for other confounding factors (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The global health burden of vision loss due to cataract increased 
between 1990 and 2015 despite considerable efforts from the World Health 
Organization and VISION 2020 initiatives.

Objective: To analyze the characteristics of life expectancy and influencing 
factors in Chinese population in different areas and provide scientific evidence 
for policy-making on disease managements, medical care and risk factor 
intervention. Methods: Based on the national census data from National Bureau of 
Statistics and the death registration data from the National Health and Family 
Planning Commission, we used exponential model, under-report adjustment model 
and abbreviated life tables to estimate the life expectancy and influence on 
disease in Chinese population in 2013. Results: The Chinese life expectancy was 
75.8 years in 2013, 1 year higher than that in 2010. The life expectancy in 
urban area was 77.4 years, while it was 75.1 years that in rural area with the 
gap between the rural area and urban area was 2.3 years. The life expectancy was 
77.2 years in the eastern area, 75.8 years in middle area and 73.5 years in 
western area, the gap between the east and west was 3.6 years. In 2013, the 
first 10 leading diseases causing the life expectancy lost were cerebrovascular 
disease, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung 
cancer, road injury, liver cancer, stomach cancer, hypertensive heart disease, 
lower respiratory infection, esophagus cancer, resulting in 7.97 years of life 
expectancy lost. Conclusion: The life expectancy in Chinese has already reached 
a relative high level, while the gap between different areas still exists. 
Different policies on disease management, medical care and risk factor 
interventions targeting different areas are needed to increase the life 
expectancy and improve the quality of life.

Objective: To analyze the death attributable to smoking and impact of life 
expectancy in China in 2013. Methods: According to the characteristics of 
different diseases, we calculated the population attributable fractions of 
different diseases, death and impact of life expectancy which caused by smoking, 
using direct method (current smoking rate as exposure levels) and indirect 
method (smoking impact ratio as exposure levels), based on data from both 
programs of death surveillance and Chinese chronic disease risk factor 
surveillance of 2013. Results: In 2013, smoking caused around 1.59 million 
deaths which accounted for 17.38% of all deaths in China. Constituent ratio of 
death caused by smoking in males (23.66%) was much higher than that in females 
(8.30%). However, in urban areas (17.24%), it was slightly lower than that in 
rural areas (17.51%). Constituent ratio of death caused by smoking in the 
eastern regions appeared the lowest (16.81%), with western regions the highest 
(17.91%). In 2013, lung cancer, COPD and ischemia heart disease were the top 
three diseases causing deaths that related to smoking, but the top three 
population attributable fractions were lung cancer, COPD and nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma in China. In 2013, smoking caused a reduction of 2.04 years of life 
expectancy loss in China, with males in the western regions the highest (3.05 
years). Conclusion: Smoking is still an important public health problem in 
China. Tobacco-control-targeted programs in the heavily involved areas could 
reduce the number of deaths from related diseases that caused by smoking.

Publisher: 目的： 分析2013年我国吸烟的归因死亡和对期望寿命的影响。 方法： 
利用2013年死因监测数据和慢性病及其危险因素监测数据，针对不同疾病特点，将以现在吸烟率作为暴露水平的直接法和以吸烟影响比作为暴露水平的间接法相结合，计算吸烟导致不同疾病死亡的人群归因分值，从而估计吸烟对于死亡和期望寿命的影响。 
结果： 
2013年中国人群由于吸烟导致约159.33万人死亡，占总死亡人数的17.38%，其中男性吸烟导致的死亡占比（23.66%）远远高于女性（8.30%），城市人群吸烟导致的死亡占比（17.24%）略低于农村人群（17.51%），东部地区人群吸烟导致的死亡占比最低（16.81%），西部地区最高（17.91%）。2013年中国人群吸烟导致死亡人数在前三位的疾病是肺癌、COPD和缺血性心脏病，吸烟导致死亡归因分值最大的前三位疾病是肺癌、COPD和鼻咽癌。2013年中国人群吸烟导致期望寿命损失2.04岁，其中最高的为西部地区男性，共损失3.05岁。 
结论： 吸烟仍是我国重要的公共卫生问题，针对重点地区人群开展控烟工作，可以降低吸烟相关疾病的死亡，有效地提高我国人群健康水平。.

Objective: To estimate the deaths (mortality) and life expectancy that 
attributable to high blood pressure in people from different regions and gender, 
in China in 2013. Methods: Data was from the 'China Chronic Disease Risk Factor 
Surveillance 2013' and the 'China National Mortality Surveillance 2013'. 
According to the comparative risk assessment theory, population attributable 
fraction (PAF) of high blood pressure by gender, urban-rural, east-central-west 
regions was calculated before the estimations on deaths (mortality) and life 
expectancy attributable to high blood pressure was made. Results: In 2013, among 
the Chinese people aged 25 years old and above, the mean SBP was (129.48±20.27) 
mmHg. High blood pressure[SBP>(115±6) mmHg]caused 20.879 million deaths and 
accounted for 22.78% of the total deaths. SBP, deaths, mortality rate and 
standardized mortality rate that attributable to high blood pressure all 
appeared higher in men [(131.15±18.73) mmHg, 11.517 million, 165.56/100 000 and 
106.97/100 000, respectively]than in women[(127.79±21.60) mmHg, 9.362 million, 
141.99/100 000 and 68.93/100 000, respectively]. SBP, deaths, mortality rate and 
PAF were all seen higher in rural[(130.25±20.66) mmHg, 11.234 million, 
178.58/100 000 and 23.59%, respectively]than in urban[(128.58±19.77) mmHg, 9.645 
million, 132.87/100 000 and 21.54%, respectively]areas. However, levels of SBP 
were similar in the east, central or west regions, with attributable deaths, 
attributable mortality rate and PAF the highest as 7.658 million 179.93/100 000, 
and 26.72% respectively. In 2013, among the Chinese people aged 25 years old and 
above, deaths caused by cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease 
attributable to high blood pressure were 19.912 million and 0.966 million, 
accounting for 52.31% of the total deaths due to cardiovascular diseases and 
62.11% to the total chronic kidney diseases. The top three deaths attributable 
to high blood pressure were ischemic heart disease (6.656 million), hemorrhagic 
stroke (5.331 million) and ischemic stroke (3.593 million). When the effect of 
high blood pressure had been eliminated, the life expectancy per capita would 
have increased by 2.86 years old, with higher in women than in men (3.07 and 
2.64 years old, respectively), higher in central than in east and west (3.48, 
2.56 and 2.58 years, respectively) areas, in rural than in urban (2.97 and 2.59 
years, respectively) areas. Conclusions: In 2013, the number of deaths 
attributable to high blood pressure was around 20.9 million, accounting for 
22.78% of the total deaths, and appeared higher in men than in women, in rural 
than in urban, in central than in east and west areas. The mortality burden 
induced by ischemic heart disease, hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke was 
most serious since the high blood pressure brought about 2.86 years of lost in 
life expectancy.

Publisher: 目的： 评估2013年中国不同地区、性别人群血压升高造成的死亡和期望寿命损失情况。 方法： 
用2013年中国慢性病及其危险因素监测数据和2013年人口死亡信息登记管理系统中死因监测数据，根据比较风险评估理论，计算分性别、城乡、东中西部地区人群血压升高的人群归因分值（PAF），进而估计血压升高造成的死亡和期望寿命损失。 
结果： 
2013年中国≥25岁人群SBP平均为（129.48±20.27）mmHg，血压升高[SBP高于（115±6）mmHg）]导致208.79万人死亡，占总死亡人数的22.78%；男性SBP[（131.15±18.73）mmHg]、归因于血压升高的死亡数（115.17万例）、死亡率（165.56/10万）、标化死亡率（106.97/10万）均高于女性[分别为（127.79±21.60）mmHg、93.62万例、141.99/10万和68.93/10万]。农村人群SBP[（130.25±20.66）mmHg]、归因死亡数（112.34万例）、归因死亡率（178.58/10万）和PAF（23.59%）均高于城市人群[分别为（128.58±19.77）mmHg、96.45万例、132.87/10万和21.54%]；东、中、西部地区人群之间的SBP水平接近，归因死亡数、归因死亡率和PAF在中部地区最高，分别为76.58万例、179.93/10万和26.72%。2013年中国≥25岁人群血压升高导致的心血管病和慢性肾病死亡数为199.12万和9.66万，分别占心血管病总死亡数的52.31%和慢性肾病总死亡数的62.11%。血压升高导致疾病死亡数最多的前3种疾病是缺血性心脏病（66.56万例）、出血性脑卒中（53.31万例）和缺血性脑卒中（35.93万例）。若消除血压升高因素影响，人均期望寿命可平均增加2.86岁，其中女性增加数量高于男性（分别为3.07和2.64岁），中部地区人群高于东西部地区人群（分别为3.48、2.56和2.58岁），农村人群高于城市（分别为2.97和2.59岁）。 
结论： 2013年中国人群血压升高对死亡和期望寿命造成严重影响。.

Objective: To estimate the effect of high total cholesterol (TC) on life 
expectancy in China. Methods: Population attributable fractions (PAF) of high TC 
were calculated in both urban, rural areas and regions, using data related to TC 
levels from the chronic disease risk factor surveillance in China, 2013. 
Together with PAFs, data related to death registry, demographics, attributable 
deaths from high TC and its effect on life expectancy, were estimated. Results: 
In 2013, the TC level in Chinese population aged 25 and above appeared as 
(4.8±1.0) mmol/L, higher in urban areas[(4.8±1.0) mmol/L]than that in rural 
areas[(4.7±1.0) mmol/L)], with the highest in eastern regions[(4.9±1.0) mmol/L] 
and lowest in the central regions [(4.6±1.0) mmol/L]. TC level appeared as 
(4.8±1.0) mmol/L in both sexes. A total of 2.9% of all the deaths were 
attributed to high TC (264 998 deaths), among which 89.3% were caused by 
ischemic heart disease (236 540 deaths). PAF was seen higher in females (3.7%) 
than that in males (2.3%), higher in urban (3.4%) than that in rural areas 
(2.4%), with the highest in eastern (3.7%) and lowest in western regions (2.1%). 
Mortality that attributed to high TC was 19.6/100 000, higher in females 
(21.2/100 000) than that in males (18.0/100 000), higher in urban(20.8/100 000) 
than that in rural areas (18.2/100 000), with the highest in eastern (23.2/100 
000) and lowest in western regions (15.6/100 000). In 2013, the loss of life 
expectancy that caused by high TC was 0.30 year, higher in females (0.35 year) 
than in males (0.26 year), higher in urban (0.34 year) than that in rural areas 
(0.28 year), with the highest seen in the eastern (0.36 year) and lowest (0.23 
year) in the western regions. Conclusion: In 2013, the effect of high TC on life 
expectancy appeared different between genders, urban and rural areas or regions, 
with greater impact on females, urban and eastern areas of the country.

结果： 
2013年，中国≥25岁人群血清TC水平为（4.8±1.0）mmol/L，城市人群TC水平[（4.8±1.0）mmol/L]高于农村[（4.7±1.0）mmol/L]，东部地区人群TC最高[（4.9±1.0）mmol/L]，中部最低[（4.6±1.0）mmol/L]，男性和女性TC均为（4.8±1.0）mmol/L。全部死亡中，2.9%归因于高胆固醇（264 
998人），其中89.3%死于缺血性心脏病（236 
540人），女性全死因人群归因分值（3.7%）高于男性（2.3%），城市（3.4%）高于农村（2.4%），东部最高（3.7%），西部最低（2.1%）。中国人群高胆固醇归因死亡率为19.6/10万，女性（21.2/10万）高于男性（18.0/10万），城市（20.8/10万）高于农村（18.2/10万），东部归因死亡率最高（23.2/10万），西部最低（15.6/10万）。2013年中国人群高胆固醇导致期望寿命损失为0.30岁，女性（0.35岁）高于男性（0.26岁）；城市人群期望寿命损失（0.34岁）高于农村（0.28岁）；东部人群期望寿命损失最高（0.36岁），西部最低（0.23岁）。 
结论： 高胆固醇对中国人群期望寿命的影响存在性别、城乡和地区差异。女性、城市和东部受影响较大。.

Planning Commission, Beijing 100044, China.

Objective: To quantitatively estimate the deaths and life expectancy losses 
attributable to diet high in sodium in China, and examine the gains and shifts 
under different control scenarios of sodium consumption. Methods: Based on data 
from the cause-of-death through the National Mortality Surveillance System, and 
24 hours urinary sodium values from Global Burden of Disease study on Chinese's 
estimates, population attributable fractions with the framework of comparative 
risk assessment were used to analyze the deaths and life expectancy losses due 
to diet high in sodium. The same methods were followed to examine the gains and 
shifts under different control scenarios of sodium consumption. Results: In 
2013, 1 430 (940 for men and 490 for women) thousand deaths were attributable to 
diet high in sodium, accounting for 15.6% (17.4% for men and 13.0% for women) of 
all-cause deaths in China, which causing 2.17 (2.49 for men and 1.71 for women) 
years of life expectancy loss. Diet with high sodium in 2013 caused 1 200, 50 
and 180 thousand deaths from cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and 
stomach cancer respectively, accounting for 31.5%, 30.8% and 64.8% of those 
specific causes. Comparing to the baseline in 2013, if the targets of 10% 
decrease of sodium consumption by 2020 and 15% by 2030 for Chinese chronic 
disease prevention and treatment planning, and 30% decrease by 2030 for WHO 
non-communicable disease monitoring framework are achieved, 220, 340 and 730 
thousand deaths will be averted, which may gain 0.30, 0.45 and 0.95 years of 
life expectancy, respectively. Conclusions: As one of the leading risk factors, 
diet high in sodium had caused heavy burden of disease from cardiovascular 
disease, chronic kidney disease and stomach cancer on Chinese residents. 
Intervention programs on sodium-reduction are urgently needed in China and 
related cost-effectiveness is highly expected.

Publisher: 目的： 定量估计中国居民高盐饮食相关的死亡和期望寿命损失，并分析在不同的控制场景下相关死亡和期望寿命损失的变化。 方法： 
利用全国死因监测系统2013年死因监测数据，以及全球疾病负担对中国居民24 
h尿钠的估计值，按照比较风险评估理论，采用人群归因分值计算2013年中国居民高盐饮食归因死亡和期望寿命损失。应用相同的方法预测在达到不同的控制目标下，归因死亡和期望寿命损失的变化情况。 
结果： 
2013年中国居民归因于高盐饮食的死亡约143万人，占全部死亡的15.6%，其中男性94万（17.4%），女性49万（13.0%），造成中国居民期望寿命损失达2.17岁（男性2.49岁，女性1.71岁）。高盐饮食导致心脑血管病、慢性肾病和胃癌死亡分别约120万人、5万人和18万人，占该疾病死亡的31.5%、30.8%和64.8%。如果实现到2020年食盐摄入量下降10%，到2025年下降15%的慢性病防治规划目标，以及2025年下降30%的WHO自愿性目标，将分别避免死亡约22万人、34万人和73万人，人均期望寿命损失将分别减少0.30岁、0.45岁和0.95岁。 
结论： 高盐饮食给中国居民带来了沉重的疾病负担，是导致心脑血管病、慢性肾病和胃癌死亡的重要危险因素。积极开展有效的综合减盐干预，将带来很好的成本效果。.

Objective: To analyze deaths that attributable to high fasting plasma glucose 
and its impact on life expectancy among Chinese residents in 2013. Methods: Data 
from the Mortality Surveillance Programs in National Disease Surveillance Points 
System and the China Chronic Disease Surveillance (2013) were used. Death 
attributed to high fasting plasma glucose and its impact on the life expectancy 
of Chinese residents were estimated, based on the principle of population 
attributable fraction. Results: In 2013, the total number of deaths attributed 
to high fasting plasma glucose among aged ≥25 years old was 621 thousand, with 
333 thousand males and 288 thousand females. Diseases related to the number of 
deaths caused by high fasting plasma glucose would include ischemic heart 
disease (212 thousand) as the most important one. Cerebrovascular disease 
appeared the 2(nd) place, with around 181 thousand cases and then followed by 
diabetes (145 thousand), chronic kidney disease (52 thousand) and tuberculosis 
(31 thousand). After removal of the effects on high blood glucose exposure, the 
life expectancy of Chinese residents in 2013 would have reached 76.5 years old, 
an average increase of 0.7 years, compared to the average life expectancy of all 
deaths, with men having an increase of 0.7 years and women of 0.8 years, 
respectively. Conclusions: High fasting plasma glucose appeared an important 
risk factor for mortality and life expectancy on the Chinese residents. Programs 
related to prevention and control of high fasting plasma glucose and related 
diseases should be strengthened.

Objective: To analyze the attribution of mortality and impact on life expectancy 
caused by insufficient physical activity in different gender and areas in adults 
aged ≥25 years among Chinese people. Methods: Data from the programs related to 
Chinese death surveillence, risk factors of chronic survey, health outcomes of 
physical activity as well as relative risk (RR) on Global Burden of Disease 
(GBD) study were used. Population attributable fraction (PAF) of different 
health outcomes attributable to deaths that caused physical activity and the 
influence of life expectancy in adults aged ≥25 years in Chinese people were 
calculated. Results: The overall PAF for all cause of death due to physical 
activity in adults aged ≥25 years was 4.24%, with 4.86% in females and 3.82% in 
males. The health outcomes of inadequate physical activity would include breast 
cancer, colorectal cancer, ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke and diabetes 
with relative PAFs as 9.04%, 13.96%, 14.96%, 17.80% and 16.92%, respectively. 
The attribution of death on Physical activity was 388 954. The most attributed 
death was ischemic heart disease, followed by ischemic stroke. With the 
elimination of physical inactivity, the total life expectancy was expected to 
lose by 0.43 years, with 0.47 years in women, and 0.39 years in men. Conclusion: 
The increase of physical activity may benefit on health condition so to reduce 
the burden of chronic diseases and increase the life expectancy.

Objective: To assess the mortality attributable to low fruit intake among people 
over 25 years old in China, 2013, and its effect on life expectancy. Methods: 
Based on data collected from China Chronic Disease and Risk Factor Surveillance 
in 2013, the average fruit intake in different genders and areas were 
calculated. Potential impact fraction (PIF) was used to examine the impact on 
deaths, mortality and life expectancy. Results: The average daily fruit intake 
was (113.3±168.9) g among people over 25 years old, with (103.6±160.1) g for men 
and (122.7±176.6) g for women, in China in 2013. Fruit intake for urban 
residents was significantly higher than that in rural residents and higher in 
eastern regions than that in central or western regions. Scores that 
attributable to low fruit intake accounted for 15.21% of the total deaths and 
the population attributable fraction of inadequate intake of fruits to 
associated diseases was 35.00%. PIF for all the deaths in rural residents 
(16.50%) appeared higher than that of the urban residents (13.88%), and higher 
in the residents living in the eastern region (15.48%) than that in the central 
(16.27%) or western (13.75%) regions. Number of deaths that attributable to low 
fruit intake was 1.348 4 million. Deaths caused by related diseases appeared as: 
ischemic heart disease (472.5 thousands), hemorrhagic stroke (338.8 thousands), 
ischemic stroke (259.0 thousands), lung cancer (208.4 thousands), esophageal 
cancer (60.7 thousands), laryngeal cancer (5.4 thousands) and oral cancer (3.6 
thousands). Numbers of all deaths and related diseases for urban residents were 
lower than that of the rural residents, with central regions (452.7 thousands) 
higher than that in the eastern (531.1 thousands) or western (364.6 thousands) 
regions. The average life expectancy loss caused by low fruit intake was 1.73 
years, 1.80 years for men and 1.58 years for women, in this country. Loss of 
life expectancy in the rural residents was higher than that of the urban 
residents, and higher in central regions than that in the eastern or western 
regions. Conclusions: The intake of fruit was far lower than the recommended 
standard set for the Chinese people. Population attributable fraction was 
related to the associated diseases caused by inadequate intake of fruits which 
also made serious impact on life expectancy.

The relation between life expectancy and energy utilization is of particular 
concern. Different viewpoints concerned the health impacts of heating policy in 
China. However, it is still obscure that what kind of heating energy or what 
pattern of heating methods is the most related with the difference of life 
expectancies in China. The aim of this paper is to comprehensively investigate 
the spatial relations between life expectancy at birth (LEB) and different 
heating energy utilization in China by using spatial autocorrelation models 
including global spatial autocorrelation, local spatial autocorrelation and hot 
spot analysis. The results showed that: (1) Most of heating energy exhibit a 
distinct north-south difference, such as central heating supply, stalks and 
domestic coal. Whereas spatial distribution of domestic natural gas and 
electricity exhibited west-east differences. (2) Consumption of central heating, 
stalks and domestic coal show obvious spatial dependence. Whereas firewood, 
natural gas and electricity did not show significant spatial autocorrelation. It 
exhibited an extinct south-north difference of heat supply, stalks and domestic 
coal which were identified to show significant positive spatial autocorrelation. 
(3) Central heating, residential boilers and natural gas did not show any
