BACKGROUND: The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 
England and Wales recommends the combination of pharmacotherapy and 
psychotherapy for the treatment of moderate to severe depression. However, the 
cost-effectiveness analysis on which these recommendations are based has not 
included psychotherapy as monotherapy as a potential option. For this reason, we 
aimed to update, augment and refine the existing economic evaluation.
METHOD: We constructed a decision analytic model with a 27-month time horizon. 
We compared pharmacotherapy with cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and 
combination treatment for moderate to severe depression in secondary care from a 
healthcare service perspective. We reviewed the literature to identify relevant 
evidence and, where possible, synthesized evidence from clinical trials in a 
meta-analysis to inform model parameters.
RESULTS: The model suggested that CBT as monotherapy was most likely to be the 
most cost-effective treatment option above a threshold of £ 22,000 per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY). It dominated combination treatment and had an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £ 20,039 per QALY compared with 
pharmacotherapy. There was significant decision uncertainty in the probabilistic 
and deterministic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previous NICE guidance, the results indicated that even 
for those patients for whom pharmacotherapy is acceptable, CBT as monotherapy 
may be a cost-effective treatment option. However, this conclusion was based on 
a limited evidence base, particularly for combination treatment. In addition, 
this evidence cannot easily be transferred to a primary care setting.

BACKGROUND: Imperata cylindrica is being considered as a biomass candidate for 
bioethanol. This work aimed to evaluate a mild alkali pretreatment effect on the 
Imperata recalcitrant structure. Therefore, varied concentrations of NaOH (0, 
7.5, 15, 20, and 25 g L(-1) ) were applied as treatments to Imperata at 105 °C 
for 10 min.
RESULTS: Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and Fourier 
transform infrared spectroscopy studies revealed that 20 to 25 g L(-1) 
NaOH-treated Imperata exposed amorphous cellulose on surface granules composed 
of lignin, waxes, and partly hemicelluloses were abolished due to the 
comprehensive disruption of the linkages between lignin and carbohydrates. The 
cellulose crystalline index was increased with 7.5 to 20 g L(-1) NaOH treatments 
and reduced with a 25 g L(-1) NaOH treatment. In fact, the cellulose content in 
solids increased with the increasing NaOH concentration and was estimated to be 
720 and 740 g kg(-1) for the 20 and 25 g L(-1) NaOH treatments, respectively. 
The yield of the reducing sugar was obtained 805 and 813 mg g(-1) from 20 and 
25 g L(-1) NaOH-treated Imperata, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Considering the cost of pretreatment, the 20 g L(-1) NaOH treatment 
is judged to be effective for disrupting Imperata recalcitrance in this 
pretreatment regime.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is a group of disorders characterized by 
deformation of erythrocytes. Renal damage is a frequent complication in sickle 
cell disease as a result of long-standing anemia and disturbed circulation 
through the renal medullary capillaries. Due to the improvement in life 
expectancy of people with sickle cell disease, there has been a corresponding 
significant increase in the incidence of renal complications. Microalbuminuria 
and proteinuria are noted to be a strong predictor of subsequent renal failure. 
There is extensive experience and evidence with angiotensin-converting enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitors over many years in a variety of clinical situations for 
patients who do not have sickle cell disease, but their effect in people with 
this disease is unknown. It is common practice to administer ACE inhibitors for 
sickle nephropathy due to their renoprotective properties; however, little is 
known about their effectiveness and safety in this setting. This is an update of 
a Cochrane Review first published in 2013.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of ACE inhibitor administration in 
people with sickle cell disease for decreasing intraglomerular pressure, 
microalbuminuria and proteinuria and to to assess the safety of ACE inhibitors 
as pertains to their adverse effects.
SEARCH METHODS: The authors searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic 
Disorders Group's Hameoglobinopathies Trials Register comprising references 
identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of 
relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Date of the most 
recent search: 03 June 2015.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of ACE 
inhibitors designed to reduce microalbuminuria and proteinuria in people with 
sickle cell disease compared to either placebo or standard treatment regimen.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors independently applied the inclusion 
criteria in order to select studies for inclusion in the review. Two authors 
assessed the risk of bias of studies and extracted data and the third author 
verified these assessments.
MAIN RESULTS: Five studies were identified through the searches, only one met 
our inclusion criteria. The included study randomized 22 participants (seven 
males and 15 females) having proteinuria or microalbuminuria with sickle cell 
disease and treated the participants for six months (median length of follow up 
of three months) with captopril or placebo. The overall quality of the outcomes 
reported was high, since most aspects that may contribute to bias were regarded 
to be of low risk, although allocation concealment was not reported. At six 
months, the study reported no significant difference in urinary albumin 
excretion between the captopril group and the placebo group, although the mean 
urinary albumin excretion in the captopril group was lower by a mean difference 
of -49.00 (95% confidence interval -124.10 to 26.10) compared to that of 
placebo. However, our analysis on the absolute change score showed significant 
changes between the two groups by a mean difference of -63.00 (95% confidence 
interval -93.78 to -32.22). At six months albumin excretion in the captopril 
group was noted to decrease from baseline by a mean of 45 ± 23 mg/day and the 
placebo group was noted to increase by 18 ± 45 mg/day. Serum creatinine and 
potassium levels were reported constant throughout the study. The potential for 
inducing hypotension should be highlighted; the study reported a decrease of 8 
mmHg in systolic pressure and 5 mmHg in diastolic and mean blood pressure.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is not enough evidence to show that the 
administration of ACE inhibitors is associated with a reduction of 
microalbuminuria and proteinuria in people with sickle cell disease, although a 
potential for this was seen. More long-term studies involving multiple centers 
and larger cohorts using a randomized-controlled design are warranted, 
especially among the pediatric age group. Detailed reporting of each outcome 
measure is necessary to allow a clear cut interpretation in a systematic review. 
One of the difficulties encountered in this review was the lack of detailed data 
reported in the included study.

BACKGROUND: A systematic review was conducted to assess the cost-effectiveness 
of routine varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) vaccination in high-income countries 
estimated by modelling studies.
METHODS: A PubMed search was performed to identify relevant studies published 
before October 2013. Studies were included in the review if they (i) evaluated 
the cost-effectiveness of routine childhood or adolescent varicella vaccination 
and/or HZ vaccination targeting the elderly, and if they (ii) reported results 
for high-income countries.
RESULTS: A total of 38 model-based studies were identified that fulfilled the 
inclusion criteria. Routine childhood or adolescent varicella vaccination was 
cost-effective or cost-saving from a payer perspective and always cost-saving 
from a societal perspective when ignoring its potential impact on HZ incidence 
due to reduced or absent exogenous boosting. The inclusion of the potential 
impact of childhood varicella vaccination on HZ led to net quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) losses or incremental cost-effectiveness ratios exceeding 
commonly accepted thresholds. Additional HZ vaccination could partially mitigate 
this effect. Studies focusing only on the evaluation of HZ vaccination reported 
a wide range of results depending on the selected target age-group and the 
vaccine price, but most found HZ vaccination to be a cost-effective or 
marginally cost-effective intervention. Cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination was 
strongly dependent on the age at vaccination, the price of the vaccine, the 
assumed duration of protection and the applied cost per QALY threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: While HZ vaccination is mostly considered cost-effective, 
cost-effectiveness of varicella vaccination primarily depends on the in- or 
exclusion of exogenous boosting in the model. As a consequence, clarification on 
the role of exogenous boosting is crucial for decision-making regarding 
varicella vaccination.

Dedicated multisensory mechanisms in the brain represent peripersonal space 
(PPS), a limited portion of space immediately surrounding the body. Previous 
studies have illustrated the malleability of PPS representation through 
hand-object interaction, showing that tool use extends the limits of the 
hand-centered PPS. In the present study we investigated the effects of a special 
tool, the wheelchair, in extending the action possibilities of the whole body. 
We used a behavioral measure to quantify the extension of the PPS around the 
body before and after Active (Experiment 1) and Passive (Experiment 2) training 
with a wheelchair and when participants were blindfolded (Experiment 3). Results 
suggest that a wheelchair-mediated passive exploration of far space extended PPS 
representation. This effect was specifically related to the possibility of 
receiving information from the environment through vision, since no extension 
effect was found when participants were blindfolded. Surprisingly, the active 
motor training did not induce any modification in PPS representation, probably 
because the wheelchair maneuver was demanding for non-expert users and thus they 
may have prioritized processing of information from close to the wheelchair 
rather than at far spatial locations. Our results suggest that plasticity in PPS 
representation after tool use seems not to strictly depend on active use of the 
tool itself, but is triggered by simultaneous processing of information from the 
body and the space where the body acts in the environment, which is more 
extended in the case of wheelchair use. These results contribute to our 
understanding of the mechanisms underlying body-environment interaction for 
developing and improving applications of assistive technological devices in 
different clinical populations.

The increase of life expectancy has led to the increase of age-related diseases 
such as osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is characterized by bone weakening promoting 
the occurrence of fractures with defective bone regeneration. Men aged over 50 
have a prevalence for osteoporosis of 20%, which is related to a decline in sex 
hormones occurring during andropause or surgical orchidectomy. As we previously 
demonstrated in a mouse model for menopause in women that treatment with the 
neurohypophyseal peptide hormone oxytocin (OT) normalizes body weight and 
prevents the development of osteoporosis, herein we addressed the effects of OT 
in male osteoporosis. Thus, we treated orchidectomized mice, an animal model 
suitable for the study of male osteoporosis, for 8 weeks with OT and then 
analyzed trabecular and cortical bone parameters as well as fat mass using 
micro-computed tomography. Orchidectomized mice displayed severe bone loss, 
muscle atrophy accompanied by fat mass gain as expected in andropause. 
Interestingly, OT treatment in male mice normalized fat mass as it did in female 
mice. However, although OT treatment led to a normalization of bone parameters 
in ovariectomized mice, this did not happen in orchidectomized mice. Moreover, 
loss of muscle mass was not reversed in orchidectomized mice upon OT treatment. 
All of these observations indicate that OT acts on fat physiology in both sexes, 
but in a sex specific manner with regard to bone physiology.

BACKGROUND: Caregivers of patients with advanced cancer provide extensive care 
and experience high levels of psychosocial distress. The patient-oncologist 
therapeutic alliance may be a modifiable factor that can prevent or reduce 
negative caregiver outcomes.
METHODS: Coping with Cancer (CwC) was a prospective, longitudinal, multisite 
cohort study of terminally ill cancer patients (life expectancy ≤6 months) and 
their informal caregivers, who were followed into bereavement (n = 68). Trained 
raters interviewed patients and caregivers upon study entry and also interviewed 
caregivers 6 months after the patient's death. Patients answered quantitative 
questions assessing their perception of the patient-oncologist therapeutic 
alliance (The Human Connection scale), and caregivers completed a measure of 
health-related quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36). 
Interviewers rated caregivers' level of emotional well being. Associations 
between therapeutic alliance and caregiver outcomes were analyzed using 
univariate analysis of variance and logistic regression analyses, controlling 
for baseline caregiver measures and confounding sample characteristics.
RESULTS: A strong patient-oncologist therapeutic alliance was bivariately 
associated with caregiver self-report of less role limitation because of 
emotional problems, better social function and mental and general health-related 
quality of life, and better interviewer-rated emotional well being after the 
patient's death. After controlling for baseline measures and confounding sample 
characteristics, the correlation between patient-perceived therapeutic alliance 
and bereaved caregivers' mental health and interviewer ratings of bereaved 
caregivers' emotional well being remained significant.
CONCLUSIONS: The influence of the patient-oncologist alliance may generalize 
beyond the patient to positively impact the caregiver. By developing a strong 
relationship with the patient, the oncologist may benefit the caregiver and the 
patient. This caregiver benefit may extend into bereavement.

Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) have been used to quantify endpoint 
indicators of the human burden of disease in life cycle assessment (LCA). The 
purpose of this paper was to examine the current use of DALYs in LCA, and also 
to consider whether DALYs as used in LCA have the potential to be compatible 
with DALYs as used in quantitative risk assessment (QRA) to facilitate direct 
comparison of the results of the two approaches. A literature review of current 
usage of DALYs in LCA was undertaken. Two prominent methods were identified: 
ReCiPe 2008 and LIME2. The methods and assumptions used in their calculations 
were then critically reviewed. The assumptions used for the derivation of 
characterization factors in DALYs were found to be considerably different 
between LCA methods. In many cases, transparency of these calculations and 
assumptions is lacking. Furthermore, global average DALY values are often used 
in these calculations, but may not be applicable for impact categories where the 
local factors play a significant role. The concept of DALYs seems beneficial 
since it enables direct comparison and aggregation of different health impacts. 
However, given the different assumptions used in each LCA method, it is 
important that LCA practitioners are aware of the differences and select the 
appropriate method for the focus of their study. When applying DALYs as a common 
metric between LCA and QRA, understanding the background information on how 
DALYs were derived is crucial to ensure the consistency of DALYs used in LCA and 
QRA for resulting DALYs to be comparable and to minimize any double counting of 
effects.

OBJECTIVES: To develop prognostic models for long-term survival in adults with 
traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to assess their external validity in 2 
independent populations.
DESIGN: Survival analysis.
SETTING: Post-discharge from rehabilitation units and long-term follow-up at 
regional centers.
PARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts of long-term survivors of TBI (N=12,481): the 
Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems (TBIMS) cohort comprised 7365 persons who 
were admitted to a TBIMS facility and were assessed at ≥1 years postinjury, and 
the California Department of Developmental Services (CDDS) cohort comprised 5116 
persons who sustained a TBI and received long-term services from the CDDS.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival/mortality.
RESULTS: Older age, male sex, and severity of disability in walking and feeding 
were significant predictors of increased long-term mortality rates (all P<.05, 
both databases). The CDDS model predicted 623 deaths for persons in the TBIMS 
cohort, with an observed-to-expected ratio of .94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.87-1.02). The TBIMS model predicted a total of 525 deaths for persons in the 
CDDS cohort, with an observed-to-expected ratio of 1.08 (95% CI, 0.99-1.17). 
Regression calibration statistics were satisfactory, and both models ranked 
survival times well from shortest to longest (TBIMS: C index, .78; 95% CI, 
.76-.80; CDDS: C index, .80; 95% CI, .78-.82).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival prognosis in TBI is related to age, sex, and 
severity of disability. When compared on the basis of these factors, the 
survival estimates derived from the TBIMS and CDDS cohorts are found to be 
similar. The close agreement between model predictions and actual mortality 
rates confirm the external validity of the prognostic models presented herein.

OBJECTIVES: To compute the life expectancy of persons with traumatic brain 
injury (TBI) based on validated prognostic models from 2 cohorts, to compare 
mortality and life expectancy of persons with TBI with those of the U.S. general 
population, and to investigate trends toward improved survival over the last 2 
decades.
DESIGN: Survival analysis.
SETTING: Postdischarge from rehabilitation units and long-term follow-up at 
regional centers.
PARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts of long-term survivors of TBI (N=12,481): the 
Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems (TBIMS) cohort comprised 7365 persons who 
were admitted to a TBIMS facility with moderate to severe TBI and were assessed 
at ≥1 years postinjury, and the California Department of Developmental Services 
(CDDS) cohort comprised 5116 persons who sustained a TBI and received long-term 
services from the CDDS.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy.
RESULTS: The estimates of age-, sex-, and disability-specific life expectancy of 
persons with TBI derived from the CDDS and TBIMS were similar. The estimates of 
age- and sex-specific life expectancy were lower than those of the U.S. general 
population. Mortality rates of persons with TBI were higher than those of the 
U.S. general population. Mortality rates did not improve and the standardized 
mortality ratio increased over the study period from 1988 to 2010.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy of persons with TBI is lower than that of the 
general population and depends on age, sex, and severity of disability. When 
compared, the survival outcomes in the TBIMS and CDDS cohorts are remarkably 
similar. Because there have been no marked trends in the last 20 years, the life 
expectancies presented in this article may remain valid in the future.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the 
manufacturer of ipilimumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Limited) to 
submit clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence for previously untreated 
advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma as part of the Institute's Single 
Technology Appraisal process. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and 
Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act 
as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article presents a summary 
of the manufacturer's submission of ipilimumab, the ERG review and the resulting 
NICE guidance TA319, issued in July 2014. Ipilimumab at a recommended dose of 3 
mg/kg monotherapy was previously granted marketing authorisation by the European 
Medicines Agency in adult patients who had received prior therapy and was 
recommended by NICE in guidance TA268. In October 2013, the EMA approved the 
extension of this indication to previously untreated advanced melanoma patients. 
NICE decisions are bound by the marketing authorisation; therefore, the decision 
problem faced by the NICE Appraisal Committee was whether ipilimumab at a 
recommended dose of 3 mg/kg monotherapy was effective and cost effective 
compared with first-line standard of care involving dacarbazine (DTIC) and 
vemurafenib (for BRAF V600 mutation-positive patients). The CA184-024 trial was 
the primary source of clinical evidence for ipilimumab. However, this was based 
on a dose of 10 mg/kg with concomitant DTIC. The results over a 5-year period 
indicated that ipilimumab 10 mg/kg plus DTIC demonstrated a significant increase 
in median overall survival (OS) of 2.1 months compared with DTIC plus placebo 
(11.2 vs. 9.1 months). The BRIM-3 trial, which was an open-label randomised 
controlled trial (RCT) in BRAF V600 mutation-positive patients, was the primary 
source of evidence for an indirect comparison with vemurafenib. The results 
showed that vemurafenib increased median OS by 3.6 months compared with DTIC 
(13.2 vs. 9.6 months). The economic evaluation compared the costs and outcomes 
of ipilimumab by assuming that the 3 mg/kg dosing regimen was clinically 
equivalent in efficacy to an ipilimumab 10 mg/kg dosing regimen plus DTIC and by 
using a treatment sequencing approach that incorporated second-line active 
therapy and third-line best supportive care (BSC). In the first appraisal 
meeting, the committee recommended ipilimumab only in the context of research as 
part of a clinical study. This was primarily based on the lack of robust 
evidence to support the assumption of clinical equivalence between dosages and 
the absence of evidence available to inform the sequential use of treatments. 
Following the consultation, the manufacturer submitted additional analyses and 
evidence to support the cost effectiveness of ipilimumab at first line. The 
manufacturer's response was based on concerns relating to uncertainty 
surrounding the relative efficacy of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy compared 
with DTIC and vemurafenib, comparability of the patient populations at first and 
second line, and the effects of concomitant DTIC. These additional analyses 
indicated that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £ 47,900 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for ipilimumab compared with DTIC and £ 
28,600 per QALY gained for ipilimumab compared with vemurafenib. Following 
consideration of the additional evidence and the responses from a large number 
of consultees and commentators, the committee recommended ipilimumab as an 
option for adults with previously untreated advanced melanoma.

Local and long-distance transport of cytoskeletal proteins is vital to neuronal 
maintenance and growth. Though recent progress has provided insight into the 
movement of microtubules and neurofilaments, mechanisms underlying the movement 
of actin remain elusive, in large part due to rapid transitions between its 
filament states and its diverse cellular localization and function. In this 
work, we integrated live imaging of rat sensory neurons, image processing, 
multiple regression analysis, and mathematical modeling to perform the first 
quantitative, high-resolution investigation of GFP-actin identity and movement 
in individual axons. Our data revealed that filamentous actin densities arise 
along the length of the axon and move short but significant distances 
bidirectionally, with a net anterograde bias. We directly tested the role of 
actin and microtubules in this movement. We also confirmed a role for actin 
densities in extension of axonal filopodia, and demonstrated intermittent 
correlation of actin and mitochondrial movement. Our results support a novel 
mechanism underlying slow component axonal transport, in which the stability of 
both microtubule and actin cytoskeletal components influence the mobility of 
filamentous actin.

All evaluation exercises involve ethical values, as they require some conception 
of the "good life." Evaluation of health technologies is no exception. Because 
there is no consensus about what is a good life, we have to devise 
decision-making procedures in which citizens with different opinions are heard 
and treated fairly (1). The purpose of health technology assessment (HTA) is to 
offer useful input into this process so as to increase the quality of the 
deliberations and of the resulting decisions. How to bring ethical values into 
this process?

The use of the early cannulation prosthetic graft (Acuseal™) for angioaccess for 
haemodialysis.

OBJECTIVES: Autogenous arteriovenous (AV) accesses are the preferred choice for 
the delivery of haemodialysis (HD). With an increase in the prevalence of 
end-stage renal disease and in the life expectancy of these patients, the 
quality and availability of superficial vessels can be limited and reduced with 
time. The use of prosthetic AV accesses may therefore become necessary for the 
delivery of HD. A new early cannulation vascular prosthesis (GORE® ACUSEAL 
Vascular Graft) has been introduced, developed to hinder suture line and 
cannulation needle bleeding. The authors report their experience with this new 
conduit at a London teaching hospital.
METHODS: Between May 2011 and June 2013, 52 patients underwent 55 procedures 
where the ACUSEAL® prosthetic AV access was utilized to facilitate HD. The 
majority of procedures involved the placement of prosthetic brachio-axillary 
accesses or prosthetic axillo-axillary chest accesses.
RESULTS: The 1-year primary and secondary patency was found to be 46% and 61%, 
respectively. Successful cannulation of the newly placed AV access was performed 
with 24 hours of surgery in 40 patients (73%). Tunnelled vascular catheters were 
required in only 10 (18%) patients. Six (11%) of the patients in the study 
suffered early complications, and 9 (16%) patients developed AV access 
infection.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that, while providing patency results that 
compare favourably to those published for other types of regular prosthetic 
accesses, the conduits are amenable to very early cannulation with few 
cannulation-related complications. This leads to a dramatic reduction in the 
need for temporary or tunnelled catheters.

INTRODUCTION: We describe long term trends in prostate cancer epidemiology in 
Lithuania, where a national prostate specific antigen (PSA) test based early 
detection programme has been running since 2006.
METHODS: We used population-based cancer registry data, supplemented by 
information on PSA testing, life expectancy and mortality from Lithuania to 
examine age-specific prostate cancer incidence, mortality and survival trends 
among men aged 40+ between 1978 and 2009, as well as life expectancy of 
screening-eligible men, and the proportion of men with a first PSA test per year 
since the programme started.
RESULTS: The number of prostate cancer patients rose from 2.237 in 1990-1994 to 
15.294 in 2005-2009. By 2010, around 70% of the eligible population was tested, 
on average around two times. The early detection programme brought about the 
highest prostate cancer incidence peaks ever seen in a country to date. Recent 
incidence and survival rises in the age groups 75-84 suggest PSA testing in the 
elderly non-eligible population. Life expectancy of men aged 70-74 indicates 
that less than 30% of patients will live for 15 years and may have a chance to 
benefit from early detection.
CONCLUSIONS: Early detection among men aged 70-74, and particularly among the 
elderly (75+) may have to be reconsidered. Life expectancy assessment before 
testing, avoiding a second test among men with low PSA values and increasing the 
threshold for further evaluation and the screening interval may help reducing 
harm. Publishing information on treatment modalities, side-effects and patient 
reported quality of life is recommended.

BACKGROUND: Medical Emergency Teams (METs) are frequently involved in ethical 
issues associated to in-hospital emergencies, like decisions about end-of-life 
care and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. MET involvement offers both 
advantages and disadvantages, especially when an immediate decision must be 
made. We performed a survey among Italian intensivists/anesthesiologists 
evaluating MET's perspective on the most relevant ethical aspects faced in daily 
practice.
METHODS: A questionnaire was developed on behalf of the Italian scientific 
society of anesthesia and intensive care (SIAARTI) and administered to its 
members. Decision making criteria applied by respondents when dealing with 
ethical aspects, the estimated incidence of conflicts due to ethical issues and 
the impact on the respondents' emotional and moral distress were explored.
RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 327 intensivists/anesthesiologists. 
Patient life-expectancy, wishes, and the quality of life were the factors most 
considered for decisions. Conflicts with ward physicians were reported by most 
respondents; disagreement on appropriateness of ICU admission and family 
unpreparedness to the imminent patient death were the most frequent reasons. 
Half of respondents considered that in case of conflicts the final decision 
should be made by the MET. Conflicts were generally recognized as causing 
increased and moral distress within the MET members. Few respondents reported 
that dedicated protocols or training were locally available.
CONCLUSION: Italian intensivists/anesthesiologists reported that ethical issues 
associated with in-hospital emergencies are occurring commonly and are having a 
significant negative impact on MET well-being. Conflicts with ward physicians 
happen frequently. They also conveyed that hospitals don't offer ethics training 
and have no protocols in place to address ethical issues.

Development of cancer treatment regimens including immunotoxins is partly 
hampered by their immunogenicity. Recently, deimmunized versions of toxins have 
been described, potentially being better suited for translation to the clinic. 
In this study, a recombinant tripartite fusion toxin consisting of a deimmunized 
version of exotoxin A from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PE38) genetically fused to an 
affibody molecule specifically interacting with the human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2), and also an albumin binding domain (ABD) for half-life 
extension, has been produced and characterized in terms of functionality of the 
three moieties. Biosensor based assays showed that the fusion toxin was able to 
interact with human and mouse serum albumin, but not with bovine serum albumin 
and that it interacted with HER2 (KD=5 nM). Interestingly, a complex of the 
fusion toxin and human serum albumin also interacted with HER2 but with a 
somewhat weaker affinity (KD=12 nM). The IC50-values of the fusion toxin ranged 
from 6 to 300 pM on SKOV-3, SKBR-3 and A549 cells and was lower for cells with 
higher surface densities of HER2. The fusion toxin was found specific for HER2 
as shown by blocking available HER2 receptors with free affibody molecule before 
subjecting the cells to the toxin. Analysis of contact time showed that 10 min 
was sufficient to kill 50% of the cells. In conclusion, all three regions of the 
fusion toxin were found to be functional.

Culture and National Well-Being: Should Societies Emphasize Freedom or 
Constraint?

Throughout history and within numerous disciplines, there exists a perennial 
debate about how societies should best be organized. Should they emphasize 
individual freedom and autonomy or security and constraint? Contrary to 
proponents who tout the benefits of one over the other, we demonstrate across 32 
nations that both freedom and constraint exhibit a curvilinear relationship with 
many indicators of societal well-being. Relative to moderate nations, very 
permissive and very constrained nations exhibit worse psychosocial outcomes 
(lower happiness, greater dysthymia, higher suicide rates), worse health 
outcomes (lower life expectancy, greater mortality rates from cardiovascular 
disease and diabetes) and poorer economic and political outcomes (lower gross 
domestic product per capita, greater risk for political instability). This 
supports the notion that a balance between freedom and constraint results in the 
best national outcomes. Accordingly, it is time to shift the debate away from 
either constraint or freedom and focus on both in moderation.

BACKGROUND: Deleterious mutations in the BRCA genes are responsible for a small, 
but significant, proportion of breast and ovarian cancers (5 - 10 %). Proof of 
de novo mutations in hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) families is rare, 
in contrast to founder mutations, thousands of years old, that may be carried by 
as much as 1 % of a population. Thus, if mutations favoring cancer survive 
selection pressure through time, they must provide advantages that compensate 
for the loss of life expectancy.
METHOD: This hypothesis was tested within 2,150 HBOC families encompassing 
96,325 individuals. Parameters included counts of breast/ovarian cancer, age at 
diagnosis, male breast cancer and other cancer locations. As expected, 
well-known clinical parameters discriminated between BRCA-mutated families and 
others: young age at breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and male 
breast cancer. The major fertility differences concerned men in BRCA-mutated 
families: they had lower first and mean age at paternity, and fewer remained 
childless. For women in BRCA families, the miscarriage rate was lower. In a 
logistic regression including clinical factors, the different miscarriage rate 
and men's mean age at paternity remained significant.
RESULTS: Fertility advantages were confirmed in a subgroup of 746 BRCA mutation 
carriers and 483 non-carriers from BRCA mutated families. In particular, female 
carriers were less often nulliparous (9.1 % of carriers versus 16.0 %, p = 
0.003) and had more children (1.8 ± 1.4 SD versus 1.5 ± 1.3, p = 0.002) as well 
as male carriers (1.7 ± 1.3 versus 1.4 ± 1.3, p = 0.024).
CONCLUSION: Although BRCA mutations shorten the reproductive period due to 
cancer mortality, they compensate by improving fertility both in male and female 
carriers.

BACKGROUND: Lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) involves excessive 
inflammation, repetitive infections and development of bronchiectasis. Recently, 
literature on emphysema in CF has emerged, which might become an increasingly 
important disease component due to the increased life expectancy. The purpose of 
this study was to assess the presence and extent of emphysema in endstage CF
