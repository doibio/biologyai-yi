For patients with multilevel degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), laminectomy 
and fusion is an established technique. A concomitant effect of multilevel 
fusion is a restriction of cervical spine mobility. This retrospective study on 
DCM-patients with at least 4 laminectomy and fusion levels, compares data 
between objective and subjective restriction of the postoperative cervical spine 
mobility. The patient-reported restriction of cervical spine mobility was 
acquired by a five-step score. Measurements of cervical range of motion were 
performed using the CROM device and were correlated with the subjective scores. 
Fusion was performed over 6 levels in most of the 36 patients. For the 
subjective cervical spine mobility, 52.8% reported none to medium, 38.9% severe 
and 8.3% complete restriction. Mean objective cervical range of motion was 45.0° 
for flexion-extension, 26.3° for total lateral flexion and 51.4° for total 
rotation and therefore evidently reduced compared to non-operated patient 
cohorts in literature. There was a significant medium, negative correlation 
between the objective measurements and the patient-reported general restriction 
of cervical spine mobility, and with the physical component summary of SF-8. The 
significant objective reduction of cervical range of motion after laminectomy 
and multilevel fusion correlates with the patient-reported assessment for 
general restriction.

Optimism is associated with reduced mortality risk among Whites, but evidence 
for this relationship is limited among African-Americans, whose life expectancy 
is shorter than Whites. This study examined the association between optimism and 
mortality rate in African-Americans. Data were from African-American women 
(n = 2652) and men (n = 1444) in the United States from the Jackson Heart Study. 
Optimism was measured using the Life Orientation Test-Revised at the baseline 
period (2000-2004), and mortality data were obtained until 2018. Using Cox 
proportional hazards models, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality by 
optimism level, controlling for sociodemographic factors, depressive symptoms, 
health conditions, and health behaviors. In secondary analyses, we evaluated 
potential effect modification by sex, age, income, and education. Higher 
optimism was related to lower mortality rates (HR = 0.85, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 0.74, 0.99), controlling for sociodemographic factors and 
depressive symptoms. After further adjusting for health conditions and health 
behaviors, associations were slightly attenuated (HR = 0.89; 95%CI = 0.77, 
1.02). Stronger associations between optimism and mortality were observed in 
men, among those with higher income or education, and with age ≤ 55 (all p's for 
interaction terms <0.06). In summary, optimism was associated with lower 
mortality rates among African-Americans in the Jackson Heart Study. Effect 
modification by sociodemographic factors should be further explored in 
additional research considering optimism and mortality in diverse populations. 
Positive factors, such as optimism, may provide important health assets that can 
complement ongoing public health efforts to reduce health disparities, which 
have traditionally focused primarily on risk factors.

OBJECTIVE: Evidence is limited regarding the impact of frailty phenotype with 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) among younger people and life expectancy.
METHODS: The present study included 449971 participants who were enrolled 
between 2006 and 2010. We used separate cox proportional hazard models 
stratified by sex to investigate the association of frailty status and each 
fraity phenotype with CVD events. Using flexible parametric survival models with 
age as the time scale, we calculated the number of years of life expectancy lost 
due to frailty status and frailty phenotypes.
RESULTS: The present analysis included 449,971 (38-73 years old) participants, 
including 199,617 (44.36%) men in the UK Biobank Study. Both frailty and 
pre-frailty status significantly were associated with an increase of the CVD 
incidence and all-cause mortality across a wider age range. For individuals with 
a pre-frailty status, life expectancy at age 45 had a significant reduction of 
2.05 (95% CI, 1.75-2.34) years in men and 1.63 (95% CI, 1.34-1.93) years in 
women; life expectancy at age 65 had a significant reduction of 1.75 (95% CI, 
1.49-2.00) years in men and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.18-1.70) years in women.
CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort study, frailty was associated with 
higher risks of CVD incidence and all-cause mortality across a wider age range, 
and led to a reduction in life expectancy. These findings highlight the 
importance of not only considering frailty modification in older people but also 
extending preventive efforts to younger people.

INTRODUCTION: South Carolina has experienced a surge in fatal overdoses, 
primarily fueled by opioid-involved overdose deaths. This work aims to quantify 
the burden of premature mortality due to fatal opioid-involved overdoses in 
South Carolina while documenting the contribution of synthetic opioids to excess 
mortality, examining substance specific geographic and demographic patterns of 
mortality burden, and measuring the effect of fatal opioid and synthetic 
opioid-involved overdoses on average lifespan.
METHODS: We obtained death certificates for fatalities involving opioids, 
cocaine, benzodiazepines, and psychostimulants (N = 3,726) in South Carolina 
from 2014 to 2018. Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) was used to examine 
gender, racial, and geographic disparities in mortality burden. We assessed the 
contribution of synthetic opioid poisoning to the overall opioid mortality 
burden over time and calculated the effect of fatal opioid and synthetic 
opioid-involved overdoses on average lifespan.
RESULTS: From 2014 to 2018, opioid-involved overdose deaths resulted in 124,451 
YPLL. The average age of fatal male and female opioid-involved overdoses 
decreased 2.8 and 3.9 years, respectively. Synthetic opioids increasingly 
contributed to opioid YPLL, accounting for 22% in 2014 to 64% in 2018. Mortality 
burden was not shared equally between races, sexes, or rural/urban counties. The 
largest change occurred in black male synthetic opioid-involved deaths (2234%). 
Rural counties comprised 44-48% of the population adjusted YPLL despite 
containing 34% of the population.
CONCLUSION: Opioid-involved overdoses account for a critical cause of mortality 
in South Carolina, demonstrate significant impact on YPLL and highlight 
mortality burden disparities in gender, race, and rural/urban settings.

BACKGROUND: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the Check It program, a novel 
community-based chlamydia screening and expedited partner treatment program for 
young Black men conducted in New Orleans since 2017.
METHODS: We implemented a probabilistic cost-effectiveness model using a 
synthetic cohort of 16 181 men and 13 419 women intended to simulate the size of 
the Black, sexually active population in New Orleans ages 15-24 years.
RESULTS: The Check It program cost $196 838 (95% confidence interval [CI]: $117 
320-$287 555) to implement, saved 10.2 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 95% 
CI: 7.7-12.7 QALYs), and saved $140 950 (95% CI: -$197 018 to -$105 620) in 
medical costs per year. The program cost $5468 (95% CI: cost saving, $16 717) 
per QALY gained. All iterations of the probabilistic model returned 
cost-effectiveness ratios less than $50 000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The Check It program (a bundled seek, test, and treat chlamydia 
prevention program for young Black men) is cost-effective under base case 
assumptions. Communities where Chlamydia trachomatis rates have not declined 
could consider implementing a similar program.

AIMS: Knowledge of the features of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia 
(FH) who are protected from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is 
important for the clinical and prognostic care of this apparently high-risk 
condition. Our aim was to investigate the determinant and characteristics of 
patients with FH who are protected from ASCVD and have normal life expectancy, 
so-called 'resilient' FH (R-FH).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Spanish Familial Hypercholesterolaemia cohort study 
(SAFEHEART) is an open, multicentre, nation-wide, long-term prospective cohort 
study in genetically defined patients with heterozygous FH in Spain. Patients in 
the registry who at the time of analysis were at least 65 years or those who 
would have reached that age had they not died from an ASCVD event were analysed 
as a case-control study. Resilient FH was defined as the presence of a 
pathogenic mutation causative of FH in a patient aged ≥65 years without clinical 
ASCVD. Nine hundred and thirty registrants with FH met the study criteria. A 
defective low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor mutation, higher plasma level 
of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), younger age, female gender, 
absence of hypertension, and lower plasma lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] concentration 
were independently predictive of R-FH. In a second model, higher levels of HDL-C 
and lower 10-year score in SAFEHEART-RE were also independently predictive of 
R-FH.
CONCLUSION: Resilient FH may be typified as being female and having a defective 
LDL-receptor mutation, higher levels of plasma HDL-C, lower levels of Lp(a), and 
an absence of hypertension. The implications of this type of FH for clinical 
practice guidelines and the value for service design and optional care of FH 
remains to be established.

The Paid and Unpaid Working Life Expectancy at 50 in Europe.

Ophir A(1).

OBJECTIVES: Amid growing concerns about the economic implications of population 
aging and the sustainability of older adults' working life, unpaid family care 
work receives less attention despite its direct relevance to population aging. 
This article systematically compares the paid and unpaid working life expectancy 
at age 50 to understand the overlap and trade-off between paid and unpaid work 
among older European adults.
METHOD: Using data from the Survey of Health and Retirement in Europe with the 
Sullivan method, the article presents gender differences across 17 countries in 
life expectancy at age 50 at various paid (employment) and unpaid (caregiving) 
role configurations.
RESULTS: When work is defined to include unpaid family caregiving, women and men 
have similar working life expectancies at age 50, in contrast to prior research. 
However, its paid and unpaid components are gendered. The results also show that 
at age 50, women are expected to spend a similar number of years providing 
grandchild care and activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily 
living care and that most of these years take place after retirement.
DISCUSSION: The results highlight that the gendered tension between paid and 
unpaid work persists into older adulthood and needs to be accounted for in 
working life expectancy measures. The results also underscore the gendered 
implications of population aging and unpaid work in older adulthood for 
retirement age policies and strategies for promoting gender equality in later 
life.

Bariatric surgery is a gastro-intestinal surgery aimed at obtaining weight loss 
in obesity. The rapid metabolic effects of this type of operations provided a 
rational to change its name to metabolic surgery, in fact often the improvement 
of metabolic diseases is observed before a meaningful weight reduction.In this 
review, we examine the effects of laparoscopic metabolic surgery on life 
expectancy, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and 
cancer.Furthermore, we review the surgical endoscopy approaches to obesity 
including primary obesity procedures and revision procedures that address weight 
regain after bariatric surgery.Finally, as a bridge to the specific chapter, we 
summarize the effects on weight reduction of new anti-obesity medications.

Studies on the conditional life expectancy of patients with chronic myeloid 
leukaemia (CML) are lacking. Using data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry, we 
examined the life expectancy of patients with CML in the Netherlands diagnosed 
during 1989-2018. As of the early 2010s, the life expectancy of patients with 
CML who survived several years after diagnosis came narrowly close to the 
general population's life expectancy, regardless of age. This finding can 
essentially be ascribed to the introduction and broader application of tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and provide optimism to patients with CML who can look 
forward to a near-normal life expectancy in a modern TKI era.

Cost-utility of as-needed ICS-formoterol versus to maintenance ICS in mild to 
moderate persistent asthma.

BACKGROUND: Recent asthma guidelines, such as the Global Initiative for Asthma 
(GINA), recommend in adult patients as-needed inhaled corticosteroids 
(ICS)-formoterol as an alternative to maintenance ICS in mild to moderate 
persistent asthma. The introduction of these recommendations concerns whether 
using as-needed budesonide-formoterol would be more cost-effective than to 
maintenance ICS. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
as-needed combination low-dose budesonide-formoterol compared to short-acting 
β2-agonist (SABA) reliever therapy in patients with mild asthma.
METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was created to estimate the cost and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of patients with mild asthma in Colombia. 
Total costs and QALYs of low-dose budesonide-formoterol compared to short-acting 
β2-agonist (SABA) were calculated over a lifetime horizon. Multiple sensitivity 
analyses were conducted. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated at a 
willingness-to-pay value of $19,000.
RESULTS: The model suggests a potential gain of 0.37 QALYs and per patient per 
year on as-needed ICS-formoterol and a reduction in the discounted cost per 
person-year, of as-needed ICS-formoterol to maintenance ICS, of US$40. This 
position of dominance of as-needed ICS-formoterol negates the need to calculate 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. In the deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, our base-case results were robust to variations in all 
assumptions and parameters.
CONCLUSION: Low-dose budesonide-formoterol as a reliever was cost-effective when 
added to usual care in patients with mild asthma. Our study provides evidence 
that should be used by decision-makers to improve clinical practice guidelines 
and should be replicated to validate their results in other middle-income 
countries.

BACKGROUND: An important proportion of asthma patients remain uncontrolled 
despite using inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Clinical 
guidelines recommend, in these patients, using add-on long-acting muscarinic 
antagonists (triple therapy) to treatment with high doses of inhaled 
corticosteroids-long-acting beta2-agonist (dual therapy). The purpose of this 
study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of triple therapy versus dual therapy 
for patients with severe asthma.
METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was created to estimate the cost and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of patients with severe asthma in Colombia. 
Total costs and QALYS of dual and triple therapy were calculated over a lifetime 
horizon. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted. Cost-effectiveness was 
evaluated at a willingness-to-pay value of $19,000.
RESULTS: The model suggests a potential gain of 1.55 QALYs per patient per year 
on triple therapy with respect to dual therapy. We observed a difference of 
US$304 in discounted cost per person-year on triple therapy with respect to dual 
therapy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$196 in the 
probabilistic model. In the sensitivity analysis, our base-case results were 
robust to variations in all assumptions and parameters.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, triple therapy in patients with moderate-severe 
asthma was cost-effective. Using triple therapy emerges with our results as an 
alternative before using oral corticosteroids or biologics, especially in 
resource-limited settings.

This is the first published description of edge-to-edge transcatheter mitral 
valve repair (ETE-TMVr) in a patient with Down's Syndrome. This case experience 
suggests a potential role for ETE-TMVr in high-risk and complex congenital 
mitral pathologies. This includes symptomatic Down's Syndrome patients, 
particularly given the increasing life expectancy and reported high prevalence 
of regurgitant lesions in adults with trisomy 21.

Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.

Objective: To assess the feasibility and efficacy of palliative radiotherapy 
dose regimens for patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. Methods: 
Fifty patients of previously untreated, inoperable, stage IVA and IVB squamous 
cell carcinoma of the head and neck, deemed unfit for radical treatment, were 
included in the study from May 2020 to June 2020. Two palliative radiotherapy 
regimens were used. First was a single fraction radiation with 8 Gy for patients 
with limited life expectancy and poor performance status, which was repeated 
after 4 weeks in case of good symptom relief. The second regimen was used for 
patients with good performance status and consisted of fractionated radiation 
with 30 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks, which was followed by supplementary 
radiation with 25 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks in patients with good 
symptomatic response at 2 weeks. Symptoms were assessed at baseline and at the 
end of 4 weeks after treatment completion using the numerical rating score. 
Patients were followed up for a median of 4.5 months and assessed for symptom 
control and overall survival. Results: Forty-eight patients completed treatment 
and were included for analysis. Of the 24 patients who received single fraction 
radiation, 13 (54.2%) were given the second dose. Improvement in pain and 
dysphagia were reported in 57.9% and 60% patients, respectively. A total of 
55.5% noted decrease in size of the neck node. Twenty-four patients received 
fractionated radiation and 15 (62.5%) were given the second course after 2 
weeks. Relief in pain and dysphagia was reported in 68.2% and 63.6% patients, 
respectively. There were no grade 3/4 toxicities. Symptom control lasted for at 
least 3 months in 30% of the patients who received single fraction radiation and 
54.2% of the patients who received fractionated radiation. The estimated 6-month 
overall survival of the entire cohort was 51.4%. Conclusion: Judicious use of 
palliative radiation in advanced incurable head and neck cancers provides 
effective and durable symptom relief and should be used after careful 
consideration of patient prognosis, logistics of treatment, and goals of care.

BACKGROUND: With the increasing occurrence of infectious diseases in 
lower-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), emergency preparedness is essential 
for rapid response and mitigation. Economic evaluations of mitigation 
technologies and strategies have been recommended for inclusion in emergency 
preparedness plans. We aimed to perform an economic evaluation using dynamic 
transition modeling of ebola virus disease (EVD) vaccination in a hypothetical 
community of 1,000 persons in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
METHOD: Using a modified SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered, with 
Death added [SEIR-D]) model that accounted for death and epidemiological data 
from an EVD outbreak in the DRC, we modeled the transmission of EVD in a 
hypothetical population of 1,000. With our model, we estimated the 
cost-effectiveness of an EVD vaccine and an EVD vaccination intervention.
RESULTS: The results showed vaccinating 50% of the population at risk prevented 
670 cases, 538 deaths, and 22,022 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The 
vaccine was found to be cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of $95.63 per DALY averted. We also determined the minimum required 
vaccination coverage for cost-effectiveness to be 40%. Sensitivity analysis 
showed our model to be fairly robust, assuring relatively consistent results 
even with variations in such input parameters as cost of screening, as well as 
transmission, infection, incubation, and case fatality rates.
CONCLUSION: EVD vaccination in our hypothetical population was found to be 
cost-effective from the payer perspective. Our model presents an efficient and 
reliable approach for conducting economic evaluations of infectious disease 
interventions as part of an emergency preparedness plan.

Plain Language Summary: PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARYInfectious diseases affect 
lower-and-middle-income (LMIC) countries, with their limited resources, 
disproportionately more. This is certainly the case for ebola virus disease 
(EVD), a rare, severe, and mostly fatal disease. Vaccination is now available, 
but whether it is cost-effective remains an open question. We evaluated its 
cost-effectiveness by modeling the spread of EVD in a hypothetical population of 
1000 persons. Using data from an EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo (DRC), we estimated how many of persons susceptible to infection were 
exposed to the virus, became infected, recovered, or died. We did so for two 
scenarios: vaccinating versus not vaccinating enough people to achieve herd 
immunity. We assumed vaccinating 50% of the people and estimated how many 
infections, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALY; the loss of the 
equivalent of a year of full health) would be prevented by vaccination. Our 
cost-effectiveness metric was the incremental cost of preventing one DALY.The 
outcomes of vaccination offset the additional costs. Vaccinating 50% of the 
population of 1000 cost an additional $2,081,358 but prevented 670 infections, 
538 deaths, and 22022 DALYs. Preventing one DALY cost $95.63. This is very 
cost-effective as it is less than the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita 
for the DRC of $556.81. Vaccination below 40% of the population was less 
cost-effective, was most cost-effective at the herd immunity threshold of 45.3%, 
beyond which there were diminishing returns. Summarized, vaccination against EVD 
is clinically very effective and certainly worth the additional cost.

In recent years, and particularly associated with the increase of cancer 
patients' life expectancy, the occurrence of cancer treatment sequelae, 
including cognitive impairments, has received considerable attention. 
Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments (CICI) can be observed not only 
during pharmacological treatment of the disease but also long after cessation of 
this therapy. The lack of effective tools for its diagnosis together with the 
limited treatments currently available for alleviation of the side-effects 
induced by chemotherapeutic agents, demonstrates the need of a better 
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathology. This review focuses on 
the comprehensive appraisal of two main processes associated with the 
development of CICI: neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and proposes the 
endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) as a new therapeutic target against CICI. 
The neuroprotective role of the ECS, well described in other cognitive-related 
neuropathologies, seems to be able to reduce the activation of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines involved in the neuroinflammatory supraspinal processes underlying 
CICI. This review also provides evidence supporting the role of 
cannabinoid-based drugs in the modulation of oxidative stress processes that 
underpin cognitive impairments, and warrant the investigation of endocannabinoid 
components, still unknown, that may mediate the molecular mechanism behind this 
neuroprotective activity. Finally, this review points forward the urgent need of 
research focused on the understanding of CICI and the investigation of new 
therapeutic targets.

The purpose of this work is to reveal how subjective well-being has been 
generated in a group of professionals in the healthcare field in Colombia, who 
carried out postgraduate studies at the time of the pandemic caused by the novel 
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in a synchronous and remote learning course facilitated 
by employing digital technologies. Two methods were assumed, one was 
qualitative, taking into account some elements of narrative research and 
discourse analysis, and the other was quantitative, through a rapid 
reconnaissance survey. The research assumes the constitution of subjectivity 
from memory and everyday life, as well as the ethics of care concerning caring 
for oneself and others, as categories that were (re)signified with the 
narratives-and as notions that make up a theoretical corpus-to understand 
subjective well-being.

While the immunomodulatory pathways initiated in immune cells contribute to 
therapeutic response, their activation in cancer cells play a role in cancer 
progression. Also, many of the aberrantly expressed immunomodulators on cancer 
cells are considered as therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce host defense 
peptide (HDP), a known immuomodulator, as a therapeutic agent to target them. 
The cationic host defense peptides (HDPs), an integral part of the innate immune 
system, possess membranolytic activity, which imparts antimicrobial and 
antitumor efficacy to it. They act as immunomodulators by activating the immune 
cells. Though their antimicrobial function has been recently reassigned to 
immunoregulation, their antitumor activity is still attributed to its 
membranolytic activity. This membrane pore formation ability, which is 
proportional to the concentration of the peptide, also leads to side effects 
like hemolysis, limiting their therapeutic application. So, despite the 
identification of a variety of anticancer HDPs, their clinical utility is 
limited. Though HDPs are shown to exert the immunomodulatory activity through 
specific membrane targets on immune cells, their targets on cancer cells are 
unknown. We show that SSTP1, a novel HDP identified by shotgun cloning, binds to 
the active IL6/IL6Rα/gp130 complex on cancer cells, rearranging the active site 
residues. In contrast to the IL6 blockers inhibiting JAK/STAT activity, SSTP1 
shifts the proliferative IL6/JAK/STAT signaling to the apoptotic IL6/JNK/AP1 
pathway. In IL6Rα-overexpressing cancer cells, SSTP1 induces apoptosis at low 
concentration through JNK pathway, without causing significant membrane 
disruption. We highlight the importance of immunomodulatory pathways in cancer 
apoptosis, apart from its established role in immune cell regulation and cancer 
cell proliferation. Our study suggests that identification of the membrane 
targets for the promising anticancer HDPs might lead to the identification of 
new drugs for targeted therapy.

BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms are burdened by a reduced life 
expectancy mostly due to an increased risk of thrombo-hemorrhagic events, 
fibrotic progression/leukemic evolution, and infectious complications. In these 
clonal myeloid malignancies, JAK2V617F is the main driver mutation, leading to 
an aberrant activation of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of 
transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway. Therefore, its inhibition represents 
an attractive therapeutic strategy for these disorders. Several JAK inhibitors 
have entered clinical trials, including ruxolitinib, the first JAK1/2 inhibitor 
to become commercially available for the treatment of myelofibrosis and 
polycythemia vera. Due to interference with the JAK-STAT pathway, JAK inhibitors 
affect several components of the innate and adaptive immune systems such as 
dendritic cells, natural killer cells, T helper cells, and regulatory T cells. 
Therefore, even though the clinical use of these drugs in MPN patients has led 
to a dramatic improvement of symptoms control, organ involvement, and quality of 
life, JAK inhibitors-related loss of function in JAK-STAT signaling pathway can 
be a cause of different adverse events, including those related to a condition 
of immune suppression or deficiency. This review article will provide a 
comprehensive overview of the current knowledge on JAK inhibitors' effects on 
immune cells as well as their clinical consequences, particularly with regards 
to infectious complications.

The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) enables digital devices to gather, infer, 
and broadcast health data via the cloud platform. The phenomenal growth of the 
IoMT is fueled by many factors, including the widespread and growing 
availability of wearables and the ever-decreasing cost of sensor-based 
technology. The cost of related healthcare will rise as the global population of 
elderly people grows in parallel with an overall life expectancy that demands 
affordable healthcare services, solutions, and developments. IoMT may bring 
revolution in the medical sciences in terms of the quality of healthcare of 
elderly people while entangled with machine learning (ML) algorithms. The 
effectiveness of the smart healthcare (SHC) model to monitor elderly people was 
observed by performing tests on IoMT datasets. For evaluation, the precision, 
recall, fscore, accuracy, and ROC values are computed. The authors also compare 
the results of the SHC model with different conventional popular ML techniques, 
e.g., support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and decision tree 
(DT), to analyze the effectiveness of the result.

In recent years, as human life expectancy increases, birth rate decreases and 
health management concerns; the traditional Healthcare imaging system, with its 
uneven Healthcare imaging resources, high Healthcare imaging costs, and 
diagnoses often relying on doctors' clinical experience and equipment level 
limitations, has affected people's demand for health, so there is a need for a 
more accurate, convenient, and affordable Healthcare imaging system that allows 
all people to enjoy fair and quality Healthcare imaging services. This paper 
discusses the construction and evaluation of an intelligent medical diagnostic 
model based on integrated deep neural networks, which not only provides a 
systematic diagnostic analysis of the various symptoms input by the inquirer but 
also has higher accuracy and efficiency compared with traditional medical 
diagnostic models. The construction of this model provides a theoretical basis 
for integrating deep neural networks applied to medical neighborhoods with big 
data algorithms.
