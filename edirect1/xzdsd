BACKGROUND: Soft palate defects created during oral cancer surgery may prevent 
complete palatal closure and trigger palatopharyngeal insufficiency. One current 
treatment employs a rigid obturator prosthesis; an extension of acrylic resin at 
the level of the hard palate ensures surface contact with the remaining 
musculature. Unfortunately, airflow escape often causes hypernasality, 
compromises speech intelligibility, and creates swallowing problems (including 
leakage of food and fluid into the nasal airway). We plan to test a new 
removable denture featuring a thick dental dam that serves as a membrane 
obturator. The principal objective of the clinical trial is a comparison of 
speech handicap levels after 1 month in patients with acquired velar 
insufficiencies who wear either the new device or a conventional, rigid 
obturator. The secondary objectives are between-device comparisons of the 
swallowing handicaps and the health-related qualities of life.
METHODS: The VELOMEMBRANE trial is a superiority, open-labeled, two-way, random 
crossover clinical trial. Adult patients exhibiting velar or palatovelar 
substance loss after tumor excision and who are indicated for rigid 
obturator-mediated prosthetic rehabilitation will be recruited in two teaching 
hospitals in France. Fourteen participants will be randomly allocated to wear 
both prostheses for 1-month periods in either order. The new membrane obturator 
is a removable resin prosthesis incorporating a rigid extension that holds a 
dental dam to restore the soft palate. The primary outcome will be the extent of 
phonation-related disability (the overall score on the Voice Handicap Index 
[VHI]). The secondary outcomes will be the Deglutition Handicap Index and 
health-related quality of life scores of the European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).
DISCUSSION: High-quality evidence will be provided to document the utility of a 
new medical device that may greatly improve the management and quality of life 
of patients with acquired velar insufficiency.

BACKGROUND: PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) is a well established 
endoscopic procedure for enteral feeding. However, patients with a shorter life 
expectancy will not benefit from PEG tube placement. Furthermore, some specific 
evolving diseases will never benefit from PEG. The aim of the study focuses on 
short and long term mortality rates after PEG tube placement in a referral 
gastroenterology centre (Geneva University Hospital). 219 patients were enrolled 
in this study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients scheduled for a PEG procedure between January 
2011 and December 2014 were included. Nine patient parameters were collected for 
further analysis as well as the main underlying disease requiring PEG tube 
placement. Patients were subsequently divided into 4 groups according to 
underlying disease: Group 1) swallowing disorders of neurologic origin; Group 2) 
swallowing disorders associated with upper digestive tract neoplasia ; Group 3) 
nutritional support for a non GI reason ; Group 4) Other.
RESULTS: 219 patients had undergone a PEG tube placement. 33 patients died 
within 60 days after the procedure. After one year, 71 patients died. Global 
survival was 870 days. The nutritional support group had the better survival 
rate with 1276 days compared to the swallowing groups and others. The 
multivariate analysis has highlighted the underlying disease as the only 
associated parameter with short and long term mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: PEG tube placement is associated with high short and long term 
mortality depending on the underlying disease. We outlined the potential role of 
PEG tube insertion as a supportive transient approach for nutritional support.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the prevalence and incidence of periodontitis and 
associated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: We collected data on periodontitis between 1990 and 2019 from the 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 Study. The global prevalence, incidence, and 
DALYs attributed to periodontitis were analyzed. The age-standardized rate (ASR) 
and estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to quantify the 
burden of the disease and temporal trends.
RESULTS: The ASR of the prevalence, incidence, and DALYs increased worldwide 
from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, Western Sub-Saharan Africa carried the heaviest 
burden of periodontitis, whereas the nation with the highest periodontitis 
burden was Gambia. The burden of periodontitis was negatively associated with 
the level of socioeconomic development. Although, the majority of periodontitis 
burden was observed among those aged 55-59 years, the incidence of periodontitis 
has shown an increasing trend among younger individuals.
CONCLUSION: Periodontitis continues to be a global public health problem. 
Current prevention and control strategies should be enhanced to prevent an 
increase in periodontitis.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is increasingly recognised as being 
responsible for a substantial proportion of the global burden of disease. 
Neurosurgical interventions are an important aspect of care for patients with 
TBI, but there is little epidemiological data available on this patient 
population. We aimed to characterise differences in casemix, management, and 
mortality of patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI across different 
levels of human development.
METHODS: We did a prospective observational cohort study of consecutive patients 
with TBI undergoing emergency neurosurgery, in a convenience sample of hospitals 
identified by open invitation, through international and regional scientific 
societies and meetings, individual contacts, and social media. Patients 
receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI in each hospital's 30-day study period 
were all eligible for inclusion, with the exception of patients undergoing 
insertion of an intracranial pressure monitor only, ventriculostomy placement 
only, or a procedure for drainage of a chronic subdural haematoma. The primary 
outcome was mortality at 14 days postoperatively (or last point of observation 
if the patient was discharged before this time point). Countries were stratified 
according to their Human Development Index (HDI)-a composite of life expectancy, 
education, and income measures-into very high HDI, high HDI, medium HDI, and low 
HDI tiers. Mixed effects logistic regression was used to examine the effect of 
HDI on mortality while accounting for and quantifying between-hospital and 
between-country variation.
FINDINGS: Our study included 1635 records from 159 hospitals in 57 countries, 
collected between Nov 1, 2018, and Jan 31, 2020. 328 (20%) records were from 
countries in the very high HDI tier, 539 (33%) from countries in the high HDI 
tier, 614 (38%) from countries in the medium HDI tier, and 154 (9%) from 
countries in the low HDI tier. The median age was 35 years (IQR 24-51), with the 
oldest patients in the very high HDI tier (median 54 years, IQR 34-69) and the 
youngest in the low HDI tier (median 28 years, IQR 20-38). The most common 
procedures were elevation of a depressed skull fracture in the low HDI tier (69 
[45%]), evacuation of a supratentorial extradural haematoma in the medium HDI 
tier (189 [31%]) and high HDI tier (173 [32%]), and evacuation of a 
supratentorial acute subdural haematoma in the very high HDI tier (155 [47%]). 
Median time from injury to surgery was 13 h (IQR 6-32). Overall mortality was 
18% (299 of 1635). After adjustment for casemix, the odds of mortality were 
greater in the medium HDI tier (odds ratio [OR] 2·84, 95% CI 1·55-5·2) and high 
HDI tier (2·26, 1·23-4·15), but not the low HDI tier (1·66, 0·61-4·46), relative 
to the very high HDI tier. There was significant between-hospital variation in 
mortality (median OR 2·04, 95% CI 1·17-2·49).
INTERPRETATION: Patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI differed 
considerably in their admission characteristics and management across human 
development settings. Level of human development was associated with mortality. 
Substantial opportunities to improve care globally were identified, including 
reducing delays to surgery. Between-hospital variation in mortality suggests 
changes at an institutional level could influence outcome and comparative 
effectiveness research could identify best practices.

BACKGROUND: Compared to treatment as usual (TAU), early psychosis intervention 
programs (EPI) have been shown to reduce mortality, hospitalizations and days of 
assisted living while improving employment status.
AIMS: The study aim was to conduct a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and a 
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) to compare EPI and TAU in Canada.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was used to estimate the 5-year costs and 
benefits of treating patients with a first episode of psychosis with EPI or TAU. 
EPI benefits were derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Canadian 
administrative data. The cost of EPI was based on a published survey of 52 EPI 
centers in Canada while hospitalizations, employment and days of assisted living 
were valued using Canadian unit costs. The outcomes of the CBA and CEA were 
expressed in terms of net benefit (NB) and incremental cost per life year gained 
(LYG), respectively. Scenario analyses were conducted to examine the impact of 
key assumptions. Costs are reported in 2019 Canadian dollars.
RESULTS: Base case results indicated that EPI had a NB of $85,441 (95% CI: 
$41,140; $126,386) compared to TAU while the incremental cost per LYG was 
$26,366 (95% CI: EPI dominates TAU (less costs, more life years); $102,269). In 
all sensitivity analyses the NB of EPI remained positive and the incremental 
cost per LYG was less than $50,000.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to EPI demonstrated clinical benefits, our results 
suggest that large-scale implementation of EPI in Canada would be desirable from 
an economic point of view .

CONTEXTE: Comparés au traitement habituel (TH), les programmes d’intervention 
précoce en psychose (IPP) se sont révélés réduire la mortalité, les 
hospitalisations et les journées d’aide à la vie autonome tout en améliorant le 
statut d’emploi.
OBJECTIFS: La présente étude visait à mener une analyse coût-bénéfice (ACB) et 
une analyse coût-efficacité (ACE) pour comparer les IPP et le TH au Canada.
MÉTHODES: Un modèle analytique décisionnel a servi à estimer les coûts et les 
bénéfices sur 5 ans de traiter des patients au premier épisode de psychose avec 
les IPP ou le TH. Les bénéfices des IPP ont été dérivés d’essais randomisés 
contrôlés (ERC) et des données administratives canadiennes. Le coût des IPP 
était basé sur un sondage publié mené auprès de 52 centres d’IPP au Canada 
tandis que les hospitalisations, l’emploi et les journées d’aide à la vie 
autonome ont été calculés à l’aide des coûts unitaires canadiens. Les résultats 
des ACB et ACE ont été exprimés selon l’avantage net (AN) et le coût 
supplémentaire par année de vie gagnée (AVG), respectivement. Des analyses de 
scénarios ont été menées pour examiner l’effet des principales hypothèses. Les 
coûts sont mentionnés en dollars canadiens de 2019.
RÉSULTATS: Les résultats du scénario de base ont indiqué que les IPP avaient un 
AN de 85 441 $ (IC à 95% 41 140 $ à 126 386 $) comparativement au TH tandis que 
le coût supplémentaire par AVG était de 26 366 $ (IC à 95% les IPP dominent le 
TH (moins de coûts, plus d’AVG); 102 269 $). Dans toutes les analyses de 
sensibilité, l’AN des IPP demeurait positif et le coût supplémentaire par AVG 
était inférieur à 50 000 $.
CONCLUSIONS: Outre les bénéfices cliniques démontrés des IPP, nos résultats 
suggèrent que la mise en œuvre à grande échelle des IPP au Canada serait 
désirable d’un point de vue économique.

INTRODUCTION: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetically determined disease 
that manifests itself in a number of abnormalities resulting, among others, from 
dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary system. Only integrated, 
multidisciplinary care gives patients the chance to significantly improve the 
quality of life and achieve a life expectancy that does not differ from the 
general population.
AIM: The aim of the study was to summarize the available literature on the 
management of patients suffering from PWS.
CONCLUSIONS: More and more reports based on clinical trials conducted around the 
world indicate the undeniable benefits of rhGH therapy in patients with PWS in 
childhood and after the end of growth period. They consist in improving the body 
composition, improving the lipid profile, increasing bone mineral density and 
improving the mental state and patients' quality of life.

INTRODUCTION: Bioethics and nutrition are essential issues in end of life, 
advanced dementia, life-sustaining therapies, permanent vegetative status, and 
unacceptably minimal quality of life. Even though artificially administered 
nutrition (AAN), for this type of health condition, does not improve quality of 
life and extension of life, and there is evidence of complications (pulmonary 
and gastrointestinal), it has been used frequently. It had been easier 
considering cardiopulmonary resuscitation as an ineffective treatment than AAN 
for a healthy team and/or family. For this reason, many times, this issue has 
been forgotten.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to discuss bioethical principles and AAN in the 
involved patients.
DISCUSSION: The AAN has been an essential source of ethical concern and 
controversy. There is a conceptual doubt about AAN be or not be a medical 
treatment. It would be a form of nourishment, which constitutes primary care. 
These principles should be used to guide the decision-making of healthcare 
professionals in collaboration with patients and their surrogates.
CONCLUSIONS: This difficult decision about whether or not to prescribe AAN in 
patients with a poor prognosis and without benefits should be based on 
discussions with the bioethics committee, encouraging the use of advanced 
directives, education, and support for the patient, family, and health team, in 
addition to the establishment of effective protocols on the subject. All of this 
would benefit the most important person in this process, the patient.

Patient report of functioning is one component of the neurocognitive exam 
following traumatic brain injury, and standardized patient-reported outcomes 
measures are useful to track outcomes during rehabilitation. The Traumatic Brain 
Injury Quality of Life measurement system (TBI-QOL) is a TBI-specific extension 
of the PROMIS and Neuro-QoL measurement systems that includes 20 item banks 
across physical, emotional, social, and cognitive domains. Previous research has 
evaluated the responsiveness of the TBI-QOL measures in community-dwelling 
individuals and found clinically important change over a 6-month assessment 
interval in a sample of individuals who were on average 5 years post-injury. In 
the present study, we report on the responsiveness of the TBI-QOL 
Cognition-General Concerns and Executive Function item bank scores and the 
Cognitive Health Composite scores in a recently injured sample over a 1-year 
study period. Data from 128 participants with complicated mild, moderate, or 
severe TBI within the previous 6 months were evaluated. The majority of the 
sample was male, white, and non-Hispanic. The participants were 18-92 years of 
age and were first evaluated from 0 to 5 months post-injury. Eighty participants 
completed the 1-year follow-up assessment. Results show acceptable standard 
response mean values (0.47-0.51) for all measures and minimal detectable change 
values ranging from 8.2 to 8.8 T-score points for Cognition-General Concerns and 
Executive Functioning measures. Anchor rating analysis revealed that changes in 
scores on the Executive Function item bank and the Cognitive Health Composite 
were meaningfully associated with participant-reported changes in the areas of 
attention, multitasking, and memory. Evaluation of change score differences by a 
variety of clinical indicators demonstrated a small but significant difference 
in the three TBI-QOL change scores by TBI injury severity grouping. These 
results support the responsiveness of the TBI-QOL cognition measures in newly 
injured individuals and provides information on the minimal important 
differences for the TBI-QOL cognition measures, which can be used for score 
interpretation by clinicians and researchers seeking patient-reported outcome 
measures of self-reported cognitive QOL after TBI.

BACKGROUND: The influence of shared genetic vulnerability is well-known in the 
development of alcohol use disorder. However, there is a dearth of studies on 
shared environments. Hence, the present study aimed to ascertain the influence 
of shared environments in the development of alcohol use disorder.
AIM: To examine the influence of adverse childhood experiences, parental 
bonding, and temperament in the development of alcohol use disorder.
METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis 
extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines were followed. Studies 
were identified through search engines such as PubMed, Embase, and PsychInfo, 
CINAHL databases. Peer-reviewed articles in English published during 2000 - 2021 
were included for the review.
RESULTS: About 47 articles were considered for the scoping review. Shared 
environmental factors such as adverse childhood experiences or childhood trauma 
within 18 years of life, novelty, adventure-seeking, cyclothymia, and immediate 
need for gratification contribute to alcohol use disorder development. Positive 
parenting is associated with a lower incidence of AUD.
CONCLUSION: Understanding the influence of shared environments and providing 
tailor-made psycho-social interventions would reduce the risk and prevent 
alcohol use disorder development..

The current randomized controlled study investigated whether or not the 
inclusion of the eccentric phase in resistance training favors the contralateral 
strength gains after different unilateral protocols, and whether such gains are 
retained after detraining. Sixty healthy women were randomly assigned to a 
unilateral concentric-only (CONC), eccentric-only (ECC), concentric-eccentric 
(TRAD) volume-equated knee extension training or control group (CON). The 
participants trained 2 days/week for 8 weeks and then did not train for further 
8 weeks. Knee extensors isokinetic concentric, eccentric, and isometric peak 
torque and vastus lateralis muscle thickness were assessed in the contralateral 
limb at baseline, post-training, and post-detraining. At post-training, 
concentric peak torque increased in CONC [+9.2%, 95%CI (+6.2/+12.3), p < 0.001, 
ES: 0.70, 95%CI (0.01/1.39)], ECC [+11.0% (+7.7/+14.2), p < 0.001: ES: 
0.66(0.09/1.23)] and TRAD [+8.5%(+5.7/+11.6), p < 0.001, ES: 0.50(0.02/0.98)]. 
Eccentric peak torque increased in ECC in ECC [+15.0%(+11.4/+20.7), p < 0.001, 
ES: 0.91(0.14/1.63)] and TRAD [+5.5%(+0.3/10.7), p = 0.013, ES: 
0.50(0.05/0.95)]. Isometric peak torque increased in ECC [+11.3(+5.8/16.8), 
p < 0.001, ES: 0.52(0.10/0.94)] and TRAD [+8.6%(+3.4/+13.7), p < 0.001, ES: 
0.55(0.14/0.96)]. No change in eccentric and isometric peak torque occurred in 
CONC (p > 0.05). Muscle thickness did not change in any group (p > 0.05). At 
post-detraining, all groups preserved the contralateral strength gains observed 
at post-training (p < 0.05). The findings showed that ECC and TRAD increased 
contralateral knee extensors strength in concentric, eccentric, and isometric 
modality, while CONC only increased concentric strength. The eccentric phase 
appears to amplify the cross-education effect, permitting a transfer in strength 
gaining toward multiple testing modalities. Both eccentric-based and traditional 
eccentric-concentric resistance protocols are recommended to increase the 
contralateral retention in strength gains after a detraining period.

Reproductive efforts, such as pregnancy, delivery, and interaction with 
children, make maternal brains optimized for child-rearing. However, extensive 
studies in non-human species revealed a tradeoff between reproductive effort and 
life expectancy. In humans, large demographic studies have shown that this is 
the case for the most part; however, molecular marker studies regarding aging 
remain controversial. There are no studies simultaneously evaluating the 
relationship between reproductive effort, aging, and brain structures. We 
therefore examined the associations between reproductive efforts (parity status, 
number of deliveries, motherhood period, and cumulative motherhood period), DNA 
methylation age (mAge) acceleration (based on Horvath's multi-tissue clock and 
the skin & blood clock), and the regional gray matter volumes (obtained through 
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using voxel-based morphometry) in 51 
mothers aged 27-46 years of children in early childhood. We found that 
increasing reproductive efforts were significantly associated with decelerated 
aging in mothers with one to four children, even after adjusting for the 
confounding effects in the multiple linear regression models. We also found that 
the left precuneus gray matter volume was larger as deceleration of aging 
occurred; increasing left precuneus gray matter volume, on the other hand, 
mediates the relationship between parity status and mAge deceleration. Our 
findings suggest that mothers of children in early childhood, who have had less 
than four children, may benefit from deceleration of aging mediated via 
structural changes in the precuneus.

Ovarian recovery via autologous platelet-rich plasma: New benchmarks for 
condensed cytokine applications to reverse reproductive aging.

Health and life expectancy gains have pushed the overall number of menopausal 
patients to record levels. Because maternal age at first pregnancy also 
continues to rise, it is unsurprising that reduced birth rates are consistently 
reported across many populations. Both trends severely strain national 
demographics and present a socioeconomic challenge for which no satisfactory 
solution currently exists. Symptomatic menopause and infertility/miscarriage are 
met with standard therapies like hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and in vitro 
fertilization, respectively. Although these accepted interventions do supply 
some cover, both are expensive, low yield, and not without controversy. 
Meanwhile, ovarian steroid output and competent oocyte availability approach 
unrecoverable loss beyond age ~35 years, irrespective of treatment. Received 
wisdom holds that postnatal oogenesis in humans is impossible, a tenet which 
until recently encountered little serious confrontation. Reassessing this 
paradigm is overdue given proof-of-concept work on native sex steroid 
rejuvenation, de novo euploid oogenesis, ovulation, blastocyst development, 
fetal growth, and healthy term livebirths-all apparently possible with 
intraovarian insertion of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Discrete functional 
analysis of the full platelet-derived cytokine array carried with PRP 
unfortunately for now, is incomplete. Here, selected platelet releasate 
constituents and measured effects are framed to address advances in wellness and 
women's health. Emphasis is on cytokines best positioned to enable recovery of 
senescent ovarian function sufficient to suspend synthetic HRT dependency and/or 
permit egg retrieval and pregnancy. Whereas the chronicle of progress in other 
clinical fields does invite generalization of fresh platelet applications to 
reproductive endocrinology, basic mechanistic questions remain open.

The study's main purpose is to estimate the impact of the financial structure of 
Asian economies on the healthcare sector from 2000 to 2019. For empirical 
estimation, we relied on two-stage least square (2SLS) and generalized method of 
moment (GMM) estimation techniques. Two different proxies, infant mortality and 
life expectancy, were used in the analysis to represent the health status of the 
people. The findings of both 2SLS and GMM models confirm that improved financial 
structure causes life expectancy to rise and infant mortality to fall. Moreover, 
the increased usage of the internet also exerts a positive impact on the health 
status of Asians. Further, the rise in gross domestic product (GDP) and health 
expenditures also improve the health status of Asians by increasing their life 
expectancy and reducing their infant mortality rate. Improvement in financial 
structure causes the health status of the people to rise. Therefore, to achieve 
superior health status, the development of financial structure should be part 
and parcel of health policies and strategies in Asian economies.

OBJECTIVES: To provide a comprehensive assessment of the estimated burden and 
trend of urolithiasis at the global, regional, and national levels.
METHODS: The age-standardized rates (ASRs) of the incidence and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of urolithiasis from 1990 to 2019 were 
obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 database. Estimated annual 
percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to quantify the temporal trends in 
urolithiasis burden.
RESULTS: In 2019, the ASRs of the incidence and DALYs were 1,394.03/100,000 and 
7.35/100,000, respectively. The ASRs of the incidence and DALYs of urolithiasis 
decreased from 1990 to 2019 with EAPCs of -0.83 and -1.77, respectively. Males 
had a higher burden of urolithiasis than females. In 2019, the highest burden of 
urolithiasis was observed in regions with high-middle sociodemographic index 
(SDI), particularly in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia. The 
burden of urolithiasis increased in most countries or territories. The burden of 
urolithiasis and SDI had a non-linear relationship, and the estimated value of 
urolithiasis burden was the highest when the SDI value was ~0.7.
CONCLUSION: Globally, the ASRs of the incidence and DALYs of urolithiasis 
decreased from 1990 to 2019, but an increasing trend was observed among many 
countries. More effective and appropriate medical and health policies are needed 
to prevent and early intervene in urolithiasis.

BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness affecting approximately 20 
million individuals globally. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute 
to the illness. If left undiagnosed and untreated, schizophrenia results in 
impaired social function, repeated hospital admissions, reduced quality of life 
and decreased life expectancy. Clinical diagnosis largely relies on subjective 
evidence, including self-reported experiences, and reported behavioural 
abnormalities followed by psychiatric evaluation. In addition, psychoses may 
occur along with other conditions, and the symptoms are often episodic and 
transient, posing a significant challenge to the precision of diagnosis. 
Therefore, objective, specific tests using biomarkers are urgently needed for 
differential diagnosis of schizophrenia in clinical practice.
AIMS: We aimed to provide evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations, 
with a summary of laboratory measurements that could potentially be used as 
biomarkers for schizophrenia, and to discuss directions for future research.
METHODS: We searched publications within the last 10 years with the following 
keywords: 'schizophrenia', 'gene', 'inflammation', 'neurotransmitter', 'protein 
marker', 'gut microbiota', 'pharmacogenomics' and 'biomarker'. A draft of the 
consensus was discussed and agreed on by all authors at a round table session.
RESULTS: We summarised the characteristics of candidate diagnostic markers for 
schizophrenia, including genetic, inflammatory, neurotransmitter, peripheral 
protein, pharmacogenomic and gut microbiota markers. We also proposed a novel 
laboratory process for diagnosing schizophrenia in clinical practice based on 
the evidence summarised in this paper.
CONCLUSIONS: Further efforts are needed to identify schizophrenia-specific 
genetic and epigenetic markers for precise diagnosis, differential diagnosis and 
ethnicity-specific markers for the Chinese population. The development of novel 
laboratory techniques is making it possible to use these biomarkers clinically 
to diagnose disease.
