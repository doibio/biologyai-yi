Advances in health care mean that we can now treat diseases that once cut lives 
short. However, the increase in life expectancy has not been matched by 
improvements in quality of life. The World Health Organization warns us that all 
countries should prepare to meet the challenges of an aging population and this 
is integral to the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This 
may require a shift in attitude toward aging. We aimed to use meta-ethnography 
to explore the experience of adults living beyond the age of 80. Our conceptual 
model illuminates the phenomenon of connection in older age and reflects on the 
paradox of time: ephemeral, yet interminable. Our findings encourage us to 
reflect on the influence of enlightenment philosophies that underpin the desire 
for autonomy at all costs. Our study challenges the stereotypes of old age and 
has the potential to influence people's perspectives toward aging.

The ultrastructural effects of prolonged normothermic and cold ischemia on the 
cerebral cortex of the adult rat were investigated. Complete cerebral ischemia 
was produced by cardiac arrest and the animals' temperature was maintained at 
37°C for periods ranging from 0 to 81 hours before electron microscopy 
preparation. Electron micrographs of cold cerebral ischemia were generated after 
stabilizing the rat's temperature at 0°C after cardiac arrest for periods 
ranging from 0 hours to 6 months. A qualitative examination of the electron 
micrographs shows structural signatures of energy depletion such as vessel 
leaking and chromatin clumping after 1 hour at 37°C and after 24 hours at 0°C, 
followed by synapse degradation after 6 hours at 37°C and 1 week at 0°C. 
Evidence of advanced necrosis was observed after 36 hours at 37°C and 2 months 
at 0°C. A deep learning algorithm was introduced that demonstrates the 
temperature dependence of ischemia-induced ultrastructural changes and that can 
also successfully distinguish between early ischemic changes and advanced 
necrosis.

In the US, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes are in the top ten 
leading causes of death categories. The diseases compromise US life-expectancy 
and account for significant US health-care costs. This observational study 
investigates the US population's 1997-2017 Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) WONDER ICD-10 mortality records to extract the prevalence rates 
for leading causes of death by diabetes, neoplasms (cancers), and diseases of 
the circulatory system. The variables of race and age are examined for each 
disease in order to evaluate demographic and age-group risks. To document the 
public health burden from these three chronic conditions, mortality data from 
CDC WONDER was analyzed using MS-Excel and Statistical Analysis System (SAS) 
software. The general trend of deaths by diabetes, neoplasms, and diseases of 
the circulatory system has been progressively decreasing nationally; however, a 
significantly higher trend in mortality rates is observed for the Black or 
African American populations. Furthermore, over the 1997-2017 observational 
period, the crude mortality rates for the 45-54 (middle-age) and lower 
age-groups are below national mortality rate averages but are troublingly 
increasing for diabetes and notably, for the diseases of the circulatory system, 
the (younger) 25-34 age-group had a crude mortality rate increase of 6.78%.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy in patients with end-stage kidney disease treated 
with hemodialysis (HD) is limited, and as such, the presence of an advanced care 
directive (ACD) may improve the quality of death as experienced for patients and 
families. Strategies to discuss and implement ACDs are limited with little being 
known about the status of Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders in the Canadian HD 
population.
OBJECTIVES: Using data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study 
(DOPPS), we set out to (1) examine the variability in DNR orders across Canada 
and its largest province, Ontario and (2) identify clinical and functional 
status measures associated with a DNR order.
DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the DOPPS 
Canada Phase 4 to 6 from 2009 to 2017.
SETTING: DOPPS facilities in Canada.
PATIENTS: All adults (>18 years) who initiated chronic HD with a documented ACD 
were included.
MEASUREMENTS: ACD and DNR orders.
METHODS: Descriptive statistics were compared for baseline characteristics 
(demographics, comorbidities, medications, facility characteristics, and patient 
functional status) and DNR status. The crude proportion of patients per facility 
with a DNR order was calculated across Canada and Ontario. Functional status was 
determined by activities of daily living and components of the Kidney Disease 
Quality of Life (KDQOL)-validated questionnaire. We used generalized estimating 
equations (GEEs) to create sequential multivariable models (demographics, 
comorbidities, and functional status) of variables associated with DNR status.
RESULTS: A total of 1556 (96% of total) patients treated with HD had a 
documented ACD and were included. A total of 10% of patients had a DNR order. 
The crude variation of DNR status differed considerably across facilities within 
Canada, between Ontario and non-Ontario, and within Ontario (interprovince 
variation = 6.3%-17.1%, Ontario vs non-Ontario = 8.2% vs 11.7%, intraprovincial 
variation [Ontario] = 1%-26%). Patients with a DNR order were more commonly 
older, white, with cardiac comorbidities, with less or shorter predialysis care 
compared with those without a DNR order. Patients with a DNR order reported 
lower energy, more difficulty with transfers, meal preparation, household tasks, 
and financial management. In a multivariate model, age, cardiac disease, stroke, 
dialysis duration, and intradialytic weight gain were associated with DNR 
status.
LIMITATIONS: Relatively small number of events or measures in certain 
categories.
CONCLUSIONS: A large inter- and intraprovincial (Ontario) variation was observed 
regarding DNR orders across Canada highlighting areas for potential quality 
improvement. While functional status did not appear to have a bearing on the 
presence of a DNR order, the presence of various comorbidities was associated 
with the presence of a DNR order.

Publisher: CONTEXTE: L’espérance de vie des patients atteints d’insuffisance 
rénale terminale (IRT) traités par hémodialyse (HD) est limitée et, de ce fait, 
la présence de directives médicales anticipées (DMA) peut améliorer la qualité 
du décès tel qu’il sera vécu par les patients et leurs proches. Les stratégies 
de discussion et de mise en œuvre de DMA sont limitées et on en sait peu sur le 
statut des ordonnances de non-réanimation (statut des ONR) dans la population 
des patients canadiens hémodialysés.
OBJECTIFS: À partir des données de l’étude DOPPS (Dialysis Outcomes and Practice 
Patterns Study), nous avons analysé la variabilité du statut des ONR à travers 
le Canada et au sein de sa plus grande province, l’Ontario, puis nous avons 
défini des mesures des états cliniques et fonctionnels associés à une ONR.
TYPE D’ÉTUDE: Étude de cohorte rétrospective.
SOURCE: Les données canadiennes des phases 4 à 6 de l’étude DOPPS.
PARTICIPANTS: Ont été inclus tous les adultes ayant amorcé un traitement d’HD 
chronique entre 2009 et 2017 et qui avaient rédigé des DMA.
MESURES: La non-réanimation (statut de l’ONR) et le statut fonctionnel selon les 
activités de la vie quotidienne et les composantes du questionnaire validé KDQOL 
(Kidney Disease Quality of Life) sur la qualité de vie des personnes dialysées.
MÉTHODOLOGIE: Les statistiques descriptives ont été comparées sur la base des 
caractéristiques à l’inclusion (données démographiques, comorbidités, 
médicaments, caractéristiques de l’établissement de santé et statut fonctionnel 
du patient) et du statut de l’ONR. La proportion brute de patients par 
établissement avec une ONR a été calculée pour l’ensemble du Canada et pour 
l’Ontario seulement. Nous avons utilisé des équations d’estimation généralisées 
(EEG) pour créer des modèles multivariés séquentiels (données démographiques, 
comorbidités et statut fonctionnel) des variables associées au statut de l’ONR.
RÉSULTATS: Au total, nous avons inclus 1 556 patients hémodialysés (96 % des 
patients répertoriés) qui avaient des DMA documentées, et 10 % d’entre elles 
contenaient une ONR. La variation brute du statut de l’ONR différait 
considérablement d’un établissement à l’autre au Canada, entre l’Ontario et les 
autres provinces et entre les établissements ontariens (variation entre 
provinces: 6,3 à 17,1 %; Ontario par rapport aux autres provinces: 8,2 contre 
11,7 %; variation intraprovinciale [Ontario]: 1 à 26 %). Les patients avec une 
ONR étaient généralement de race blanche et plus âgés, présentaient des 
comorbidités cardiaques et avaient reçu moins de soins de prédialyse et sur une 
plus courte durée comparativement aux patients sans ONR. Les patients ayant une 
ONR ont signalé des pertes d’énergie et une plus grande difficulté avec les 
transferts, la préparation des repas, les tâches ménagères et la gestion 
financière. Dans un modèle multivarié, l’âge, la maladie cardiaque, les 
accidents vasculaires cérébraux, la durée de la dialyse et une perte de poids 
intradialyse ont été associés à l’existence d’une ONR.
LIMITES: Un nombre limité d’événements dans certaines catégories; les mesures de 
l’état fonctionnel étaient transversales.
CONCLUSIONS: Une importante variation inter et intraprovinciale (Ontario) a été 
observée quant au statut des ONR à travers le Canada, ce qui met en évidence les 
domaines d’amélioration potentielle de la qualité. Bien que l’état fonctionnel 
du patient n’ait pas semblé avoir d’incidence sur l’existence ou non d’une ONR, 
on a noté une association entre la présence de comorbidités et l’existence d’une 
ONR.

We evaluated the effects of type of nutrients on redox status according to age 
and gender in Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were raised on different dose of 
sucrose and fixed concentration of protein containing media and separated 
according to their gender and age. Redox status biomarkers such as protein 
carbonyl groups, dityrosine, kynurenine, lipid hydroperoxides, advanced 
glycation end products, and Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase were assessed. We found 
that all of the males had higher levels of basal oxidative stress biomarkers 
except protein carbonyl. On the other hand, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase activity 
was elevated. We found that high concentration of sucrose leads to impaired 
redox status. We also observed that high protein content in sucrose-based media 
fecundity rate was increased and also transition to adult flies and survival 
ratio were decreased. Further studies are needed to focus on evaluation of the 
relation between median life span, nutritional mechanisms, and redox status 
biomarkers. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Aging is characterized by functional decline 
in whole body system. Unfortunately, many of the life span extension strategies 
may lead to age-related disorders. It is widely accepted that impaired redox 
homeostasis is one of the signs of age-related pathophysiological changes. Due 
to difficulties in the establishment and validation of mimetic aging models in 
rodents, D. melanogaster is becoming/getting widely used model organism in 
gerontological studies. Currently, high protein and low carbohydrate-based 
nutrition regimes have become one of the most popular nutritional choice in 
aging population. Favorable nutrition type is considered one of the important 
factors for preventing age-related pathologies and promote healthy aging. In 
this study, we aimed to evaluate redox modulatory effects of different nutrition 
types as combination of various sucrose and constant protein concentration on 
basal redox status in D. melanogaster. Due to evolutionally conservation, we 
hypothesize that similar findings may be observed in aging population. Favorable 
nutrition type may ameliorate or postpone age-related degenerative processes and 
promote healthy aging.

OBJECTIVE: Life expectancy for individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) 
has increased recently; however, it is unknown how diabetes care attitudes 
affect late-life brain health.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Study of Longevity in Diabetes (SOLID) consists 
of 734 older adults with T1DM, reporting diabetes locus of control (dLOC), age 
of diabetes diagnosis and other demographics, history of hypoglycemic episodes, 
and depressive symptoms. Global and domain-specific (language, executive 
function, episodic memory, simple attention) cognitive functioning was assessed 
at in-person interviews. Cross-sectional associations between dLOC and cognition 
were estimated using covariate-adjusted linear regression models in pooled and 
sex-stratified models.
RESULTS: In pooled analyses, a 1-point increase in dLOC (more internal) was 
positively associated with global cognition [β=0.05, 95% confidence interval 
(CI): 0.02, 0.07], language (β=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07), and executive function 
(β=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07), but not episodic memory or simple attention. 
However, in sex-stratified analyses, this effect was seen only in males and not 
females.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly individuals with T1DM, we found associations between 
dLOC and cognition overall and in men but not women. Underlying sex differences 
should be considered in future research or interventions on psychosocial 
characteristics for cognition.

Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.

OBJECTIVE: To compare early operative treatment with nonoperative treatment of 
fragility fractures of the pelvis regarding mortality and functional outcome.
DESIGN: Retrospective.
SETTING: Two trauma centers.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred thirty consecutive patients 60 years of age or 
older with an isolated low-energy fracture of the pelvis and with a follow-up of 
at least 24 months. In center 1, treatment consisted of a nonoperative attempt 
and early operative fixation if mobilization was not possible. In center 2, all 
patients were treated nonoperatively.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes 
were in-hospital complications. Patients who survived were contacted by phone, 
and a modified Majeed score was obtained to assess functional outcome at the 
final follow-up.
RESULTS: At the final follow-up (mean 61 months, SD 24), 105/230 (45.7%) 
patients had died. One year after the initial hospitalization, 34/148 patients 
[23%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 17%-31%] of the early operative group and 
14/82 patients (17%, 95% CI: 10%-27%) of the nonoperative group had died (P = 
0.294). Nonoperative treatment had a protective effect on survival during the 
first 2 years (hazard ratio of the nonlinear effect: 2.86, 95% CI: 1.38-5.94, P 
< 0.001). Patients in the early operative treatment group who survived the first 
2 years had a better long-term survival. The functional outcome at the end of 
follow-up as measured by a modified Majeed score was not different between the 2 
groups (early operative: 66.1, SD 12.6 vs. nonoperative: 65.7, SD 12.5, P = 
0.910).
CONCLUSION: Early operative fixation of patients who cannot be mobilized within 
3-5 days was associated with a higher mortality rate and complication rate at 1 
year but with a better long-term survival after more than 2 years. Hence, 
patients with a life expectancy of less than 2 years may not benefit from 
surgery with regard to survival.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Traditional detachable syringes used by people who inject 
drugs (PWID) retain larger volumes of blood when the plunger is depressed than 
syringes with fixed needles-referred to as high (HDSS) and low dead space 
syringes (LDSS), respectively. Evidence suggests that using HDSS may result in 
greater hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission risk than LDSS. We evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of an intervention to introduce detachable LDSS in a needle 
and syringe programme (NSP).
DESIGN: HCV transmission and disease progression model with cost-effectiveness 
analysis using a health-care perspective. Detachable LDSS are associated with 
increased costs (£0.008) per syringe, yearly staff training costs (£536) and an 
estimated decreased risk (by 47.5%) of HCV transmission compared with HDSS. The 
intervention was modelled for 10 years, with costs and health benefits 
(quality-adjusted life-years: QALYs) tracked over 50 years.
SETTING: Bristol, UK.
PARTICIPANTS AND CASES: PWID attending NSP.
INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Gradual replacement of HDSS at NSP, with 8, 58 and 
95% of HDSS being replaced by detachable LDSS in 2016, 2017 and 2018, 
respectively. Comparator was continuing use of HDSS.
MEASUREMENTS: Net monetary benefit. Benefits were measured in QALYs.
FINDINGS: Introducing detachable LDSS was associated with a small increase in 
intervention costs (£21 717) compared with not introducing detachable LDSS, but 
considerable savings in HCV-related treatment and care costs (£4 138 118). 
Overall cost savings were £4 116 401 over 50 years and QALY gains were 1000, 
with an estimated 30% reduction in new infections over the 10-year intervention 
period. In all sensitivity analyses, detachable LDSS resulted in cost savings 
and additional QALYs. Threshold analyses suggested that detachable LDSS would 
need to reduce HCV transmission risk of HDSS by 0.26% to be cost-saving and 
0.04% to be cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Replacing high dead space syringes with detachable low dead space 
syringes in needle and syringe programmes in the United Kingdom is likely to be 
a cost-saving approach for reducing hepatitis C virus transmission.

BACKGROUND: Kinematic patterns after TKA can vary considerably from those of the 
native knee. It is unknown, however, if there is a relationship between a given 
kinematic pattern and patient satisfaction after TKA.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Is there an association between kinematic patterns as 
measured by AP translation during open kinetic chain flexion-extension and 
closed kinetic chain exercises (rising from a chair and squatting) and a custom 
aggregate of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) that targeted symptoms, 
pain, activities of daily living (ADL), sports, quality of life (QOL), and 
patient satisfaction after TKA?
METHODS: Thirty patients who underwent TKA between 2014 and 2016 were tested at 
a minimum follow-up of 6 months. As three different implants were used, per 
implant the first 10 patients who presented themselves at the follow-up 
consultations and were able to bend the knee at least 90°, were recruited. 
Tibiofemoral kinematics during an open kinetic chain flexion-extension and 
closed kinetic chain exercises-rising from a chair and squatting-were analyzed 
using fluoroscopy. A two-step cluster analysis was performed, resulting in two 
clusters of patients who answered the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome 
Score and the satisfaction subscore of the Knee Society Score questionnaires. 
Cluster 1 (CL1) consisted of patients with better (good-to-excellent) 
patient-reported outcome measures scores (high-PROMs cluster); Cluster 2 (CL2) 
consisted of patients with poorer scores (low-PROMs cluster). Tibiofemoral 
kinematics were compared between patients in these clusters by performing a 
Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction.
RESULTS: Concerning open kinetic chain flexion-extension, there was no 
difference in kinematic patterns between the patients in the high-PROMs cluster 
and those in the low-PROMs cluster, with the numbers available. However, during 
the closed-chain kinetic exercises, medially, initial anterior translation 
(femur relative to tibia) was found in patients in Cluster 1 during early 
flexion, but in those in Cluster 2, translation was steeper and ran more 
anteriorly (CL1 -1.5 ± 7.3%; CL2 -8.5 ± 4.4%); mean difference 7.0% [95% CI 0.1 
to 13.8]; p = 0.046). In midflexion, the femur did not translate anterior nor 
posterior in relation to the tibia, resulting in a stable medial compartment in 
Cluster 1, whereas Cluster 2 had already started translating posteriorly (CL1 
-0.7 ± 3.5%; CL2 3.4 ± 3.6%; mean difference -4.1% [95% CI -7.0 to -1.2]; p = 
0.008). There was no difference, with the numbers available, between the two 
clusters with respect to posterior translation in deep flexion. Laterally, there 
was small initial anterior translation in early flexion, followed by posterior 
translation in midflexion that continued in deep flexion. Patients in Cluster 1 
demonstrated more pronounced posterior translation in deep flexion laterally 
than patients in Cluster 2 did (CL1 8.3 ± 5.2%; CL2 3.5 ± 4.5%); mean difference 
4.9% [95% CI 0.6 to 9.1]; p = 0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: This study of total knee kinematics suggests that during closed 
kinetic chain movements, patients with poor PROM scores after TKA experience 
more anterior translation on the medial side followed by a medial mid-flexion 
instability and less posterior translation on the lateral side in deep flexion 
than patients with good PROM scores. The relationship of kinematic variations

The Psilocybin-Telomere Hypothesis: An empirically falsifiable prediction 
concerning the beneficial neuropsychopharmacological effects of psilocybin on 
genetic aging.

We introduce a novel hypothesis which states that the therapeutic utilisation of 
psilocybin has beneficial effects on genetic aging. Ex hypothesi, we predict a 
priori that controlled psilocybin interventions exert quantifiable positive 
impact on leucocyte telomere length (telomeres are a robust predictor of 
mortality and multifarious aging-related diseases). Our hypothesising follows 
the Popperian logic of scientific discovery, viz., bold (and refutable) 
conjectures form the very foundation of scientific progress. The 
'psilocybin-telomere hypothesis' is formalised as a logically valid deductive 
(syllogistic) argument and we provide substantial evidence to support the 
underlying premises. Impetus for our theorising derives from a plurality of 
converging empirical sources indicating that psilocybin has persistent 
beneficial effects on various aspects of mental health (e.g., in the context of 
depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, addiction, etc.). Additional support is based on 
a large corpus of studies that establish reliable correlations between mental 
health and telomere attrition (improved mental health is generally correlated 
with longer telomeres). Another pertinent component of our argument is based on 
recent studies which demonstrate that "meditative states of consciousness" 
provide beneficial effects on genetic aging. Similarly, psilocybin can induce 
states of consciousness that are neurophysiologically and phenomenologically 
significantly congruent with meditative states. Furthermore, prior research has 
demonstrated that a single dose of psilocybin can occasion life-changing 
transformative experiences (≈ 70% of healthy volunteers rate their experience 
with psilocybin amongst the five personally most meaningful lifetime events, 
viz., ranked next to giving birth to a child or losing a loved one). We 
postulate that these profound psychological events leave quantifiable marks at 
the molecular genetic/epigenetic level. Given the ubiquitous availability and 
cost effectiveness of telomere length assays, we suggest that quantitative 
telomere analysis should be regularly included in future psilocybin studies as 
an adjunctive biological marker (i.e., to facilitate scientific consilience via 
methodological triangulation). In order to substantiate the 'psilocybin-telomere 
hypothesis' potential neuropsychopharmacological, endocrinological, and genetic 
mechanisms of action are discussed (e.g., HPA-axis reactivity, hippocampal 
neurogenesis, neurotropic growth factors such as BDNF, 5-HT2A receptor agonism, 
neuroplasticity/synaptoplasticity, brain-wide alterations in neuronal functional 
connectivity density, involvement of the SLC6A4 serotonin transporter gene, 
inter alia). The proposed research agenda is thus intrinsically highly 
interdisciplinary, and it has deep ramifications from a philosophy of science 
perspective as it connects the epistemic level (qualitative experiential 
phenomenology) with the ontic level (quantitative molecular genetics) of 
analysis. In the long term, multidisciplinary and innovative investigations of 
the 'psilocybin-telomere hypothesis' could contribute to the improvement of 
senotherapeutic psychological interventions and the identification of novel 
geroprotective and neuroprotective/restorative pharmaceutical targets to 
decelerate genetic aging and improve well-being and quality of life during the 
aging process.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of first-line chemotherapy regimens 
for non-small cell lung cancer patients in Thailand.
METHODS: A Markov model comprising 3 health states (progression-free survival, 
progression, death) was used to estimate the long-term costs and health outcomes 
under a societal perspective with a lifetime horizon. Intervention was the 
combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin, AND the comparators were gemcitabine 
plus cisplatin and carboplatin plus paclitaxel. The efficacy and toxicity were 
obtained from landmark clinical trials, and the costs were based on a local Thai 
database. All costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. The findings were 
reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in both Thai baht 
(THB) and USD per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A series of 
sensitivity analyses, including 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, 
were performed. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was generated with a 
threshold of 160 000 THB/QALY or 4987 USD/QALY.
RESULTS: Under the base-case analysis, pemetrexed plus cisplatin had the 
greatest total cost among 3 regimens, yielding an ICER of 64 369.97 USD/QALY (2 
064 989 THB/QALY) compared with gemcitabine plus cisplatin, and ICER of 8649.16 
USD/QALY (277 465 THB/QALY) compared with carboplatin plus paclitaxel. The 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis results indicated that at the local Thai 
threshold, gemcitabine plus cisplatin was likely to be the most cost-effective 
regimen.
CONCLUSIONS: At the current price of pemetrexed, the combination of pemetrexed 
plus cisplatin was not found to be a cost-effective first-line regimen for 
patients with non-small cell lung cancer at the local Thai threshold compared 
with the gemcitabine plus cisplatin and carboplatin plus paclitaxel regimens.

BACKGROUND: Although risk-based selection of ever-smokers for screening could 
prevent more lung cancer deaths than screening according to the U.S. Preventive 
Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines, it preferentially selects older 
ever-smokers with shorter life expectancies due to comorbidities.
OBJECTIVE: To compare selection of ever-smokers for screening based on gains in 
life expectancy versus lung cancer risk.
DESIGN: Cohort analyses and model-based projections.
SETTING: U.S. population of ever-smokers aged 40 to 84 years.
PARTICIPANTS: 130 964 National Health Interview Survey participants, 
representing about 60 million U.S. ever-smokers during 1997 to 2015.
INTERVENTION: Annual computed tomography (CT) screening for 3 years versus no 
screening.
MEASUREMENTS: Estimated number of lung cancer deaths averted and life-years 
gained after development of a mortality model.
RESULTS: Using the calibrated and validated mortality model in U.S. ever-smokers 
aged 40 to 84 years and selecting 8.3 million ever-smokers to match the number 
selected by the USPSTF criteria in 2013 to 2015, the analysis estimated that 
life-gained-based selection would increase the total life expectancy from CT 
screening (633 400 vs. 607 800 years) but prevent fewer lung cancer deaths 
(52 600 vs. 55 000) compared with risk-based selection. The 1.56 million persons 
selected by the life-gained-based strategy but not the risk-based strategy were 
younger (mean age, 59 vs. 75 years) and had fewer comorbidities (mean, 0.75 vs. 
3.7).
LIMITATION: Estimates are model-based and assume implementation of lung cancer 
screening with short-term effectiveness similar to that from trials.
CONCLUSION: Life-gained-based selection could maximize the benefits of lung 
cancer screening in the U.S. population by including ever-smokers who have both 
high lung cancer risk and long life expectancy.

Despite the availability of antifibrotic therapies, many patients with 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) will progress to advanced disease and 
require lung transplantation. International guidelines for transplant referral 
and listing of patients with interstitial lung disease are not specific to those 
with IPF and were published before the widespread use of antifibrotic therapy. 
In this review, we discussed difficulties in decision-making when dealing with 
patients with IPF due to the wide variability in clinical course and life 
expectancy, as well as the acute deterioration associated with exacerbations. 
Indeed, the ideal timing for referral and listing for lung transplant remains 
challenging, and the acute deterioration might be influenced after transplant 
outcomes. Of note, patients with IPF are frequently affected by multimorbidity, 
thus a screening program for occurring conditions, such as coronary artery 
disease and pulmonary hypertension, before lung transplant listing is crucial to 
candidate selection, risk stratification, and optimal outcomes. Among several 
comorbidities, it is of extreme importance to highlight that the prevalence of 
lung cancer is increased amongst patients affected by IPF; therefore, 
candidates' surveillance is critical to avoid organ allocation to unsuitable 
patients. For all these reasons, early referral and close longitudinal follow-up 
for potential lung transplant candidates are widely encouraged.

Ambulatory patients with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) are increasing 
in number, and so is their life expectancy. Thus, there is an increasing need 
for care of these patients by non-LVAD specialists, such as providers in the 
emergency department, urgent care centers, community-based hospitals, outpatient 
clinics, etc. Non-LVAD specialists will increasingly come across LVAD patients 
and should be equipped with the knowledge and skills to provide initial 
assessment and management for these complex patients. These encounters may be 
for LVAD-related or unrelated issues. However, there are limited data and 
guidelines to assist non-LVAD specialists in caring for these complex patients. 
The aim of our review, targeting primary care providers (both inpatient and 
outpatient), general cardiologists, and other providers is to describe the 
current status of durable LVAD therapy in adults, patient selection, management 
strategies, complications and to summarize current outcome data.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an established alternative to 
surgical valve replacement for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and 
increased surgical risk. On the basis of the favorable outcomes of recent 
randomized clinical trials conducted in intermediate and low risk populations, 
TAVR is expected in the near future to be offered to patients not only at lower 
surgical risk, but also with longer life expectancy. In this particular subset, 
the long-term durability of the bioprosthetic valve is of critical importance. 
The European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI), 
the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and the European Association for 
Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) recently introduced standardized criteria to 
define structural valve deterioration (SVD) and valve failure of transcatheter 
and surgical aortic bioprosthesis-this with the aim to generate uniformity in 
data reporting in future studies assessing long-term durability of aortic 
bioprosthesis. On this background, the aim of this article is to review the 
definition, incidence and predictors of transcatheter bioprosthetic valve 
dysfunction, including structural and non-structural valve deterioration 
(SVD/NSVD), valve thrombosis, and endocarditis.

BACKGROUND: Medical advancements have resulted in better survival and life 
expectancy among those with spina bifida, but a significantly increased risk of 
perinatal and postnatal mortality for individuals with spina bifida remains.
OBJECTIVES: To examine stillbirth and infant and child mortality among those 
affected by spina bifida using data from multiple countries.
METHODS: We conducted an observational study, using data from 24 population- and 
hospital-based surveillance registries in 18 countries contributing as members 
of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research 
(ICBDSR). Cases of spina bifida that resulted in livebirths or stillbirths from 
20 weeks' gestation or elective termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly 
(ETOPFA) were included. Among liveborn spina bifida cases, we calculated 
mortality at different ages as number of deaths among liveborn cases divided by 
total number of liveborn cases with spina bifida. As a secondary outcome 
measure, we estimated the prevalence of spina bifida per 10 000 total births. 
The 95% confidence interval for the prevalence estimate was estimated using the 
Poisson approximation of binomial distribution.
RESULTS: Between years 2001 and 2012, the overall first-week mortality 
proportion was 6.9% (95% CI 6.3, 7.7) and was lower in programmes operating in 
countries with policies that allowed ETOPFA compared with their counterparts 
(5.9% vs. 8.4%). The majority of first-week mortality occurred on the first day 
of life. In programmes where information on long-term mortality was available 
through linkage to administrative databases, survival at 5 years of age was 
90%-96% in Europe, and 86%-96% in North America.
CONCLUSIONS: Our multi-country study showed a high proportion of stillbirth and 
infant and child deaths among those with spina bifida. Effective folic acid 
interventions could prevent many cases of spina bifida, thereby preventing 
associated childhood morbidity and mortality.

Background and Purpose- There is limited evidence to guide rehabilitation to 
meet the longer term needs of stroke survivors. The clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of an extended stroke rehabilitation service (EXTRAS) 
provided following early supported discharge were determined. Methods- EXTRAS 
was a pragmatic parallel-group observer-blind randomized controlled trial 
involving 19 UK centers. Patients with stroke were individually randomized to 
receive EXTRAS or usual care at discharge from early supported discharge. Five 
EXTRAS reviews were provided by an early supported discharge team member between 
one and 18 months, usually by telephone. Reviews consisted of a semi-structured 
interview assessing progress, rehabilitation needs, and service provision, with 
goal setting and action planning. The primary outcome was performance in 
extended activities of daily living (Nottingham EADL Scale) at 24 months 
post-randomization. The Nottingham EADL Scale is scored 0 to 66, with higher 
scores indicating better performance in these activities. Cost-effectiveness was 
estimated using resource utilization costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years. 
Analyses were intention to treat. Results- Between January 9, 2013 and October 
26, 2015, 573 participants were randomized (EXTRAS, n=285; usual care, n=288).
