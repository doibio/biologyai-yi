BACKGROUND: Despite steady gains in life expectancy, individuals with cystic 
fibrosis (CF) lung disease still experience rapid pulmonary decline throughout 
their clinical course, which can ultimately end in respiratory failure. 
Point-of-care tools for accurate and timely information regarding the risk of 
rapid decline is essential for clinical decision support.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to translate a novel algorithm for earlier, more 
accurate prediction of rapid lung function decline in patients with CF into an 
interactive web-based application that can be integrated within electronic 
health record systems, via collaborative development with clinicians.
METHODS: Longitudinal clinical history, lung function measurements, and 
time-invariant characteristics were obtained for 30,879 patients with CF who 
were followed in the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (2003-2015). 
We iteratively developed the application using the R Shiny framework and by 
conducting a qualitative study with care provider focus groups (N=17).
RESULTS: A clinical conceptual model and 4 themes were identified through coded 
feedback from application users: (1) ambiguity in rapid decline, (2) clinical 
utility, (3) clinical significance, and (4) specific suggested revisions. These 
themes were used to revise our application to the currently released version, 
available online for exploration. This study has advanced the application's 
potential prognostic utility for monitoring individuals with CF lung disease. 
Further application development will incorporate additional clinical 
characteristics requested by the users and also a more modular layout that can 
be useful for care provider and family interactions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our framework for creating an interactive and visual analytics 
platform enables generalized development of applications to synthesize, model, 
and translate electronic health data, thereby enhancing clinical decision 
support and improving care and health outcomes for chronic diseases and 
disorders. A prospective implementation study is necessary to evaluate this 
tool's effectiveness regarding increased communication, enhanced shared 
decision-making, and improved clinical outcomes for patients with CF.

In recent years, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated, followed by 
three consecutive years of decline. The decline is small in absolute terms but 
is unprecedented and has generated considerable research interest and theorizing 
about potential causes. Recent trends show that the decline has affected nearly 
all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the proximate causes of the decline are 
increases in opioid overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer's disease. 
A slowdown in the long-term decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases 
has also prevented life expectancy from improving further. Although a popular 
explanation for the decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across 
generations, recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes 
of death are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in 
overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent deaths, 
and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently needed to 
improve mortality in the United States.

Background: Health care providers (HCPs) require ongoing training and mentorship 
to fully appreciate the palliative care needs of children. Project ECHO® 
(Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) is a model for delivering 
technology-enabled interprofessional education and cultivating a community of 
practice among HCPs who care for children with life-limiting illness. 
Objectives: To develop, implement, and evaluate the Project ECHO model within 
the pediatric palliative care (PPC) context. Specific objectives were to 
evaluate (1) participation levels, (2) program acceptability, (3) HCP knowledge 
changes, (4) HCP self-efficacy changes, and (5) perceived practice changes after 
six months. Intervention: An interprofessional PPC curriculum was informed by a 
needs assessment. The curriculum was delivered through monthly virtual 90-minute 
TeleECHO sessions (didactic presentation and case-based learning) from January 
2018 to December 2019. The program was freely available to all HCPs wishing to 
participate. Design: A mixed-methods design with repeat measures was used. 
Surveys were distributed at baseline and six months to assess outcomes using 
7-point Likert scales. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were 
conducted. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at the Hospital 
for Sick Children. Results: Twenty-four TeleECHO sessions were completed with a 
mean of 32 ± 12.5 attendees. Acceptability scores (n = 43) ranged from 5.1 ± 1.1 
to 6.5 ± 0.6. HCPs reported improvements in knowledge and self-efficacy across 
most topics (11 out of 12) and skills (8 out of 10) with demonstrated 
statistical significance (p < 0.05). Most participants reported positive 
practice impacts, including enhanced ability to provide PPC in their practice. 
Conclusion: Project ECHO is a feasible and impactful model for fostering a 
virtual PPC-focused community of practice among interprofessional HCPs.

BACKGROUND: People with reduced kidney function have increased cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) risk. We present a policy model that simulates individuals' 
long-term health outcomes and costs to inform strategies to reduce risks of 
kidney and CVDs in this population.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a United Kingdom primary healthcare database, the 
Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), linked with secondary healthcare and 
mortality data, to derive an open 2005-2013 cohort of adults (≥18 years of age) 
with reduced kidney function (≥2 measures of estimated glomerular filtration 
rate [eGFR] <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 ≥90 days apart). Data on individuals' 
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics at entry and outcomes (first 
occurrences of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and hospitalisation for heart 
failure; annual kidney disease stages; and cardiovascular and nonvascular 
deaths) during follow-up were extracted. The cohort was used to estimate risk 
equations for outcomes and develop a chronic kidney disease-cardiovascular 
disease (CKD-CVD) health outcomes model, a Markov state transition model 
simulating individuals' long-term outcomes, healthcare costs, and quality of 
life based on their characteristics at entry. Model-simulated cumulative risks 
of outcomes were compared with respective observed risks using a split-sample 
approach. To illustrate model value, we assess the benefits of partial (i.e., at 
2013 levels) and optimal (i.e., fully compliant with clinical guidelines in 
2019) use of cardioprotective medications. The cohort included 1.1 million 
individuals with reduced kidney function (median follow-up 4.9 years, 45% men, 
19% with CVD, and 74% with only mildly decreased eGFR of 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2 at 
entry). Age, kidney function status, and CVD events were the key determinants of 
subsequent morbidity and mortality. The model-simulated cumulative disease risks 
corresponded well to observed risks in participant categories by eGFR level. 
Without the use of cardioprotective medications, for 60- to 69-year-old 
individuals with mildly decreased eGFR (60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2), the model 
projected a further 22.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.8-22.3) years of life 
if without previous CVD and 18.6 (18.2-18.9) years if with CVD. Cardioprotective 
medication use at 2013 levels (29%-44% of indicated individuals without CVD; 
64%-76% of those with CVD) was projected to increase their life expectancy by 
0.19 (0.14-0.23) and 0.90 (0.50-1.21) years, respectively. At optimal 
cardioprotective medication use, the projected health gains in these individuals 
increased by further 0.33 (0.25-0.40) and 0.37 (0.20-0.50) years, respectively. 
Limitations include risk factor measurements from the UK routine primary care 
database and limited albuminuria measurements.
CONCLUSIONS: The CKD-CVD policy model is a novel resource for projecting 
long-term health outcomes and assessing treatment strategies in people with 
reduced kidney function. The model indicates clear survival benefits with 
cardioprotective treatments in this population and scope for further benefits if 
use of these treatments is optimised.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of pharmacological pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP) using a combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate (FTC/TDF) with respect to HIV transmission in high-risk patients in the 
Czech Republic.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A pharmacoeconomic model was constructed to compare costs 
and outcomes in a cohort with and without PrEP. Initially, a decision tree is 
used to evaluate short-term benefits of PrEP (proportion of HIV-infected 
individuals), followed by Markov cycles to simulate the course of the disease 
based on CD4 lymphocyte counts. The efficacy of PrEP, probability of transition 
between HIV infection stages, costs per category and quality of life data were 
derived from the literature. The results are presented as an incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio of incremental costs and incremental quality adjusted 
life-years (ICER/QALY) in a lifetime horizon with a 3% annual discount rate of 
costs and benefits.
RESULTS: The FTC/TDF prophylaxis is dominant, that is, it generates lower costs 
and higher benefits (expressed as QALYs) in comparison with the control group 
without prophylaxis. A sensitivity analysis modelled all relevant parameters and 
all scenarios confirmed the PrEP dominance.
CONCLUSIONS: A cost-effectiveness analysis in the Czech Republic setting 
confirmed that pharmacological PrPE intervention is cost-effective, or 
cost-saving, in a high-risk population of men having sex with men, using a 
lifetime horizon.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Alcohol use treatment such as medication-assisted therapies 
(MATs) and counseling are available and effective in promoting alcohol 
abstinence. We sought to explore the cost-effectiveness of different alcohol use 
treatments among patients with compensated alcohol-related cirrhosis (AC).
METHODS: We simulated a cohort of patients with compensated AC receiving care 
from a hepatology clinic over their lifetimes. We estimated costs (in 2017 US$) 
and benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from 
healthcare and societal perspectives. Transition probabilities, costs, and 
health utility weights were taken from the literature. Treatment effects of 
FDA-approved MATs (acamprosate and naltrexone) and non-FDA approved MATs 
(baclofen, gabapentin, and topiramate) and counseling were based on a study of 
employer-insured patients with AC. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) and performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to 
understand the impact of parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: Compared to a do-nothing scenario, MATs and counseling were found to be 
cost-saving from a healthcare perspective, which means that they provide more 
benefits with less costs than no intervention. Compared to other interventions, 
acamprosate and naltrexone cost the least and provide the most QALYs. If the 
effectiveness of MATs and counseling decreased, these interventions would still 
be cost-effective based on the commonly used $100,000 per QALY gained threshold. 
Several sensitivity and scenario analyses showed that our main findings are 
robust.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with compensated AC, MATs and counseling are 
extremely cost-effective, and in some cases cost-saving, interventions to 
prevent decompensation and improve health. Health policies (e.g. payer 
reimbursement) should emphasize and appropriately compensate for these 
interventions.
LAY SUMMARY: Alcohol use treatments, including physician counseling and 
medication-assisted therapies (MATs), improve the outcomes of patients with 
compensated alcohol-related cirrhosis, though use and access have remained 
suboptimal. In this study, we found that counseling and MATs are extremely 
cost-effective, and in some cases cost-saving, interventions to help patients 
with alcohol-related cirrhosis abstain from alcohol and improve their health. 
Wider use of these interventions should be encouraged.

INTRODUCTION: Onconephrology is an emerging medical subspecialization that 
focuses on the numberless interrelations between cancer and kidney diseases. 
Tumor cells evade immune surveillance through activation of immune checkpoint 
pathways that suppress antitumor immune responses. By blocking checkpoints, new 
anticancer agents disrupt immune homeostasis but potentially induce 
immune-mediated diseases. Nephrologists and nephroimmunologists should be able 
to treat the nephrotoxic sequelae of cancer therapy and ensure continuation of 
the life-saving treatment.
METHODS: Thirty-seven renal biopsies have been carried out over 42 months in 
oncologic patients, that is, 5.2% of the total native renal biopsies were 
carried out in the same period. The commonest diagnoses (>6 cases) were 
interstitial tubular nephritis, membranous glomerulopathy, IgA nephropathy, 
vasculitis, and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: Three example cases, including focusing on key questions 
which could involve the nephrologists are reported in detail. They include a 
cancer-related Goodpasture Syndrome, the peculiar toxic effects of pemetrexed on 
tubular cells, and the intriguing relationship between bevacizumab and 
cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis.
CONCLUSION: As shown by these 3 example cases, nephrologists need to be 
open-minded with regard to kidney biopsy in order to get a timely diagnosis. 
Nephrologists also need to improve their knowledge of cancer biology and therapy 
in order to prevent kidney problems, manage therapy-related immune-mediated 
disorders, and improve patient life expectancy.

We monitored the burden of cancer in Italy and its trends over the last three 
decades, providing estimates of cancer incidence, mortality, years of life lost, 
years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), for 
cancer overall and 30 cancer sites using data from the Global Burden of Disease 
study 2017. An overview of mortality trends between 1990 and 2017 was also 
provided. In 2017, there were 254,336 new cancer cases in men and 214,994 in 
women, corresponding to an age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of 438 and 
330/100,000, respectively. Between 1990 and 2017, incident cancer cases, and, to 
a lesser extent, ASIRs significantly increased overall and for almost all cancer 
sites, but ASIRs significantly declined for lung and other tobacco-related 
neoplasms. In 2017, there were 101,659 cancer deaths in men (age-standardized 
death rate, ASDR, 158.5/100,000) and 78,918 in women (ASDR 93.9/100,000). Cancer 
deaths significantly increased between 1990 and 2017 (+ 18%), but ASDR 
significantly decreased (- 28%). Deaths significantly increased for many cancer 
sites, but decreased for stomach, esophageal, laryngeal, Hodgkin lymphoma, and 
testicular cancer. ASDRs significantly decreased for most neoplasms, with the 
main exceptions of cancer of the pancreas and uterus, and multiple myeloma. In 
2017, cancer caused 3,204,000 DALYs. Between 1990 and 2017, DALYs and 
age-standardized DALY rates significantly declined (-3.4% and -33%, 
respectively). Age-standardized mortality rates in Italy showed favorable 
patterns over the last few decades. However, the absolute number of cancer cases 
and, to a lower extent, of cancer deaths increased likely due to the progressive 
ageing of the population, this calling for a continuous effort in cancer 
prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the leading causes of mortality rate globally 
and is usually associated with obstructive jaundice (OJ). Up to date, there is 
no clear consensus on whether biliary decompression should be performed prior to 
surgery and how high levels of serum bile affects the outcome of PC. Therefore, 
our study aims were to characterise the effect of bile acids (BAs) on 
carcinogenic processes using pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines 
and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry was used to determine the serum concentrations of BAs. The effects 
of BAs on tumour progression were investigated using different assays. Mucin 
expressions were studied in normal and PDAC cell lines and in human samples at 
gene and protein levels and results were validated with gene silencing. The 
levels of BAs were significantly higher in the PDAC + OJ group compared to the 
healthy control. Treating PDAC cells with different BAs or with human serum 
obtained from PDAC + OJ patients enhanced the rate of proliferation, migration, 
adhesion, colony forming, and the expression of MUC4. In PDAC + OJ patients, 
MUC4 expression was higher and the 4-year survival rate was lower compare to 
PDAC patients. Silencing of MUC4 decreased BAs-induced carcinogenic processes in 
PDAC cells. Our results show that BAs promote carcinogenic process in PDAC 
cells, in which the increased expression of MUC4 plays an important role. Based 
on these results, we assume that in PC patients, where the disease is associated 
with OJ, the early treatment of biliary obstruction improves life expectancy.

Fall armyworm [Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith); FAW] invasion has exacerbated 
maize (Zea mays L.) crop yield losses in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), already 
threatened by other stresses, especially those that are climate-change induced. 
The FAW is difficult to control, manage, or eradicate, because it is polyphagous 
and trans-boundary, multiplies fast, has a short life cycle and migrates easily, 
and lacks the diapause growth phase. In this study, FAW and its impact in Africa 
was reviewed, as well as past and present control strategies for this pest. 
Pesticides, cultural practices, natural enemies, host-plant resistance, 
integrated pest management (IPM), and plant breeding approaches were examined as 
possible control strategies. It was concluded that an IPM control strategy, 
guided by cultural approaches already being used by farmers, and what can be 
adopted from the Americas, coupled with an insect-resistance management 
strategy, is the best option to manage this pest in Africa. These strategies 
will be strengthened by breeding for multi-trait host-plant resistance through 
stacking of genes for different modes of control of the pest.

In many countries, life expectancy has increased considerably in past years, and 
the importance of finding ways to ensure good levels of wellbeing through aging 
has become more important than ever. Arts based interventions are promising in 
this respect, and the literature suggests that musical activities can reduce 
isolation and anxiety and foster feelings of achievement and self-confidence. 
The present study examined the effects of group music making programs on the 
health and wellbeing of nursing home residents in Southern Switzerland. A team 
of professional and student musicians delivered 10 weekly music sessions in four 
nursing homes, focusing on singing, rhythm-based activities with percussion 
instruments, and listening to short, live performances. 22 participants (16 
women and 6 men, aged 72-95 years, mean 83.6, SD ± 6.9) were recruited to take 
part in the study and were interviewed after the last music session. The data 
were analyzed with thematic analysis to investigate how residents experienced 
group music making and its effects. The findings show that the music programs 
were beneficial for residents' wellbeing. Music plays an important role in their 
lives, both in their pasts and presently, and being involved in musical 
activities offers engagement and novelty in daily life, providing learning 
opportunities and facilitating interpersonal relationships. Moreover, these 
results were due to interactions with the musicians involved. Residents 
particularly appreciated the opportunity to listen to live performances as part 
of the sessions. This study suggests that nursing home residents value music and 
that music based interventions play an important and direct role in enhancing 
their wellbeing.

In all three domains of life, tRNA genes contain introns that must be removed to 
yield functional tRNA. In archaea and eukarya, the first step of this process is 
catalyzed by a splicing endonuclease. The consensus structure recognized by the 
splicing endonuclease is a bulge-helix-bulge (BHB) motif which is also found in 
rRNA precursors. So far, a systematic analysis to identify all biological 
substrates of the splicing endonuclease has not been carried out. In this study, 
we employed CRISPRi to repress expression of the splicing endonuclease in the 
archaeon Haloferax volcanii to identify all substrates of this enzyme. 
Expression of the splicing endonuclease was reduced to 1% of its normal level, 
resulting in a significant extension of lag phase in H. volcanii growth. In the 
repression strain, 41 genes were down-regulated and 102 were up-regulated. As an 
additional approach in identifying new substrates of the splicing endonuclease, 
we isolated and sequenced circular RNAs, which identified excised introns 
removed from tRNA and rRNA precursors as well as from the 5' UTR of the gene 
HVO_1309. In vitro processing assays showed that the BHB sites in the 5' UTR of 
HVO_1309 and in a 16S rRNA-like precursor are processed by the recombinant 
splicing endonuclease. The splicing endonuclease is therefore an important 
player in RNA maturation in archaea.

BACKGROUND: The administration of second- or third-generation anti-CD19 chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has remarkably improved the survival of patients 
with relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies. However, there are limited 
clinical results from fourth-generation CAR-T cell therapy, and the factors 
affecting response rate and survival have not been fully determined.
METHODS: Lymphoma patients with progression or relapse after intensive 
treatments, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and life 
expectancy >2 months were enrolled in the study. Peripheral lymphocytes were 
collected through apheresis, and magnetically selected T cells were lentivirally 
transduced with a 4th-generation CAR featuring an anti-CD19 CAR and the iCasp9 
suicide switch (4SCAR19). The patients received 4SCAR19 T cell infusion after 
approximately seven days of expansion and a conditioning regimen comprising 
cyclophosphamide/fludarabine. The efficacy, safety, and risk factors were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 21 patients with relapsed/refractory B cell non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma were enrolled and received 4SCAR19 T cell infusions at a median dose of 
8.9×105 CAR-T cells/kg. The overall response rate was 67% [95% confidence 
interval (CI), 43 to 85], with 43% of patients achieving a complete response and 
24% having a partial response. The overall and complete response rates were 58 
and 33% in the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) group and 78 and 56% in the 
non-DLBCL group, respectively. The median overall survival was 23.8 months (95% 
CI, not reached), with a median follow-up of 13.7 months. Factors affecting 
overall survival were International Prognostic Index (IPI), disease type, and 
remission status after CAR-T cell treatment. The most common adverse events of 
grade 3 or 4 during treatment were neutropenia (76%), leukopenia (71%), and 
thrombocytopenia (29%). The incidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was 
14%, and all cases were grade 1. One patient developed grade 3 neurotoxicity. No 
deaths were attributed to infusion of 4SCAR19 T cells, CRS, or neurotoxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients with relapsed or refractory B cell 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who received 4SCAR19 T cell therapy had durable responses 
and few of adverse events. The IPI model is suitable for evaluating the 
prognosis of patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy.

Multipartite viruses package their genomic segments independently and mainly 
infect plants; few target animals. Nanoviridae is a family of multipartite 
single-stranded DNA plant viruses that individually encapsidate single-stranded 
DNAs of approximately 1 kb and transmit them through aphids without replication 
in the aphid vectors, thereby causing important diseases of leguminous crops and 
banana. Significant findings regarding nanoviruses have recently been made on 
important features, such as their multicellular way of life, the transmission of 
distinct encapsidated genome segments through the vector body, evolutionary 
ambiguities, mode of infection, host range and geographical distribution. This 
review deals with all the above-mentioned features in view of recent advances 
with special emphasis on the emergence of new species and recognition of new 
host range of nanoviruses and aims to shed light on the evolutionary linkages, 
the potentially devastating impact on the world economy, and the future 
challenges imposed by nanoviruses.

Neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) of Childhood onset are a genetically 
heterogeneous group of diseases affecting the anterior horn cell, the peripheral 
nerve, the neuromuscular junction, or the muscle. For many decades, treatment of 
NMDs has been exclusively symptomatic. But this has changed fundamentally in 
recent years due to the development of new drugs attempting either to ameliorate 
secondary pathophysiologic consequences or to modify the underlying genetic 
defect itself. While the effects on the course of disease are still modest in 
some NMDs (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy), new therapies have substantially 
prolonged life expectancy and improved motor function in others (e.g., spinal 
muscular atrophy and infantile onset Pompe disease). This review summarizes 
recently approved medicaments and provides an outlook for new therapies that are 
on the horizon in this field.

Context: The human development territories have been severely constrained under 
the Covid-19 pandemic. A common dynamics has been observed, but its propagation 
has not been homogeneous over each continent. We aimed at characterizing the 
non-viral parameters that were most associated with death rate. Methods: We 
tested major indices from five domains (demography, public health, economy, 
politics, environment) and their potential associations with Covid-19 mortality 
during the first 8 months of 2020, through a Principal Component Analysis and a 
correlation matrix with a Pearson correlation test. Data of all countries, or 
states in federal countries, showing at least 10 fatality cases, were retrieved 
from official public sites. For countries that have not yet finished the first 
epidemic phase, a prospective model has been computed to provide options of 
death rates evolution. Results: Higher Covid death rates are observed in the 
[25/65°] latitude and in the [-35/-125°] longitude ranges. The national criteria 
most associated with death rate are life expectancy and its slowdown, public 
health context (metabolic and non-communicable diseases (NCD) burden vs. 
infectious diseases prevalence), economy (growth national product, financial 
support), and environment (temperature, ultra-violet index). Stringency of the 
measures settled to fight pandemia, including lockdown, did not appear to be 
linked with death rate. Conclusion: Countries that already experienced a 
stagnation or regression of life expectancy, with high income and NCD rates, had 
the highest price to pay. This burden was not alleviated by more stringent 
public decisions. Inherent factors have predetermined the Covid-19 mortality: 
understanding them may improve prevention strategies by increasing population 
resilience through better physical fitness and immunity.

Unpaired fins, which are the most ancient form of locomotory appendages in 
chordates, had emerged at least 500 million years ago. While it has been 
suggested that unpaired fins and paired fins share structural similarities, 
cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the outgrowth of the former have 
not been fully elucidated yet. Using the ventral fin fold in zebrafish as a 
model, here, we investigate how the outgrowth of the unpaired fin is modulated. 
We show that Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling restricts extension of 
the ventral fin fold along the proximodistal axis by modulating diverse aspects 
of cellular behaviors. We find that lack of BMP signaling, either caused by 
genetic or chemical manipulation, prolongs the proliferative capacity of 
epithelial cells and substantially increases the number of cells within the 
ventral fin fold. In addition, inhibition of BMP signaling attenuates the innate 
propensity of cell division along the anteroposterior axis and shifts the 
orientation of cell division toward the proximodistal axis. Moreover, abrogating 
BMP signaling appears to induce excessive distal migration of cells within the 
ventral fin fold, and therefore precipitates extension along the proximodistal 
axis. Taken together, our data suggest that BMP signaling restricts the 
outgrowth of the ventral fin fold during zebrafish development.

BACKGROUND: As the first non-factor replacement therapy for persons with 
congenital hemophilia A (PwcHA), emicizumab's safety profile is of particular 
interest to the community.
OBJECTIVES: We applied an algorithm for categorization of fatal events 
contemporaneous to emicizumab using reporter-assessed causality documented in 
the Roche Emicizumab Global Safety Database.
PATIENTS/METHODS: All fatalities in PwcHA reported to the database (from 
clinical trials, pre-market access, and spontaneous post-marketing reports) were 
categorized into: associated with hemophilia A-hemorrhagic, thrombotic, human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatic (non-HCV); 
associated with general population-trauma/suicide, non-HA-associated conditions; 
or, unspecified. Reported cause of death was not reassessed.
RESULTS: As of cut-off May 15, 2020, 31 fatalities in PwcHA taking emicizumab 
were reported. Median age at death was 58 years; 51% had factor VIII inhibitors. 
Fifteen fatalities were considered associated with HA; overall, the most 
frequent category was hemorrhage (11/31). Of these, six had a history of 
life-threatening bleeds, and four had a history of intracranial hemorrhage. The 
remaining HA-associated fatalities were related to HIV/HCV (3/31) and other 
hepatic causes (1/31). No cases were categorized as thrombotic. Of 10 cases 
considered not associated with HA, two were categorized as cardiovascular 
(non-thrombotic), five as infection/sepsis, and one each of trauma/suicide, 
pulmonary, and malignancy. Six cases were unspecified.
CONCLUSIONS: No unique risk of death was associated with emicizumab prophylaxis 
in PwcHA. The data reveal that mortality in PwcHA receiving emicizumab was 
primarily associated with hemorrhage or non-HA-associated conditions, and was 
not reported by treaters to be related to emicizumab treatment.
