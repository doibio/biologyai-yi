INTRODUCTION: Selective thoracic fusions (STFs) were introduced by Moe to treat 
the structural thoracic curve when a more flexible lumbar component existed. It 
is unknown how the curves behave and how the patients function beyond 20 years 
after surgery.
METHODS: Of the 152 eligible patients with STF, 67 were traced and contacted and 
40 completed outcome questionnaires (Oswestry Disability index [ODI], Scoliosis 
Research Society-30 [SRS-30]) and had follow-up standing radiographs. The 
preoperative, postoperative, 1-year, and follow-up films were compared, and the 
lumbar spine on follow-up assessed for signs of degeneration-disc space 
narrowing, osteophyte formation, rotatory subluxation, and lateral 
spondylolisthesis.
RESULTS: The average follow-up was 32.7 years. There were 27 Lenke 1C, 10 Lenke 
2C, and 3 Lenke 1B curves. A posterior fusion was performed in 37, with a 
Harrington rod used in 28 and all-hook constructs in 12 with fusion to T10 (1), 
T11 (10), T12 (22), or L1 (7). The average preoperative right thoracic curves 
were 56.1°, 36.2° 1 year postoperation, and 38.6° at follow-up. The average 
preoperative lumbar curve was 44.6°, being 35.2° at 1 year postoperation, and 
36.9° at follow-up. Five patients had additional surgery, 3 pseudarthrosis 
repairs (one with extension of the fusion to L4), 1 implant removal, and 1 
microdiscectomy 35 years postoperatively. At follow-up, the average ODI was 8.7 
(0-62) and the average SRS-30 3.8 (1.4-4.9). Nine patients took nonnarcotic 
medication, usually weekly or less, with only one taking daily narcotics. The 
most common lumbar radiographic finding was disc space narrowing at the apex of 
the lumbar curve, and osteophytes at L2-L3. There was no correlation of the 
lumbar changes to ODI, with a tendency to more medication use with longer 
follow-up (older subjects).
CONCLUSION: At an average 33-year follow-up, the lumbar curve in STF is 
unchanged, with patients functioning well and mild radiographic changes in the 
lumbar spine.

Conditions of metabolic distress, from malnutrition to obesity, impact, via as 
yet ill-defined mechanisms, the timing of puberty, whose alterations can hamper 
later cardiometabolic health and even life expectancy. AMP-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK), the master cellular energy sensor activated in conditions of 
energy insufficiency, has a major central role in whole-body energy homeostasis. 
However, whether brain AMPK metabolically modulates puberty onset remains 
unknown. We report here that central AMPK interplays with the puberty-activating 
gene, Kiss1, to control puberty onset. Pubertal subnutrition, which delayed 
puberty, enhanced hypothalamic pAMPK levels, while activation of brain AMPK in 
immature female rats substantially deferred puberty. Virogenetic overexpression 
of a constitutively active form of AMPK, selectively in the hypothalamic arcuate 
nucleus (ARC), which holds a key population of Kiss1 neurons, partially delayed 
puberty onset and reduced luteinizing hormone levels. ARC Kiss1 neurons were 
found to express pAMPK, and activation of AMPK reduced ARC Kiss1 expression. The 
physiological relevance of this pathway was attested by conditional ablation of 
the AMPKα1 subunit in Kiss1 cells, which largely prevented the delay in puberty 
onset caused by chronic subnutrition. Our data demonstrate that hypothalamic 
AMPK signaling plays a key role in the metabolic control of puberty, acting via 
a repressive modulation of ARC Kiss1 neurons in conditions of negative energy 
balance.

BACKGROUND: The extent to which screening mammography (SM) recommendations in 
older women incorporate life expectancy factors is not well established.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to evaluate evidence on SM 
utilization in older women by life expectancy factors.
DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase and Web of Science from January 1991 
to March 2016.
STUDY SELECTION: We included studies examining SM utilization in women ages ≥65 
years that measured life expectancy using comorbidity, functional limitations or 
health or prognostic status.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: ORs and 95% CIs were extracted and grouped by 
life expectancy category. Findings were aggregated into pooled ORs and 95% CIs 
and meta-analyzed by life expectancy category.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was SM utilization within the 
last 5 years. Life expectancy factors included number of comorbidities, Charlson 
Comorbidity Index (CCI), activities of daily living, instrumental activities of 
daily living, self-reported health status and 5-year prognostic indices.
RESULTS: Of 2,606 potential titles, we identified 25 meeting the inclusion 
criteria (comorbidity: eight studies, functional status: 11 studies and 
health/prognostic status: 13 studies). Women with higher CCI scores had 
decreased SM utilization (pooled OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.67-0.85), but increased 
absolute number of comorbidities were weakly associated with increased SM 
utilization (pooled OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.00-1.36). Women with more functional 
limitations had lower SM use odds than women with no limitations (pooled OR: 
0.72, 95% CI: 0.62-0.83). Screening utilization odds were lower among women with 
poor vs excellent health (pooled OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.96).
CONCLUSION: Greater CCI score, functional limitations and lower perceived health 
were associated with decreased SM use, whereas higher absolute number of 
comorbidities was associated with increased SM use. SM guidelines should 
consider these factors to improve assessments of potential benefits and harms in 
older women.

Mesothelioma is a rare cancer of the mesothelial cell layer of the pleura, 
peritoneum, pericardium and tunica vaginalis. It is typically caused by 
asbestos, notoriously resistant to chemotherapy and generally considered 
incurable with a poor life expectancy. Transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a GTP binding 
regulatory protein, is an important cancer stem cell survival and therapy 
resistance factor. We show that TG2 is highly expressed in human mesothelioma 
tumors and in mesothelioma cancer stem cells (MCS cells). TG2 knockdown or TG2 
inhibitor treatment reduces MCS cell spheroid formation, matrigel invasion, 
migration and tumor formation. Time to tumor first appearance is doubled in TG2 
knockout cells as compared to wild-type. In addition, TG2 loss is associated 
with reduced expression of stemness, and epithelial mesenchymal transition 
markers, and enhanced apoptosis. These studies indicate that TG2 is an important 
MCS cell survival protein and suggest that TG2 may serve as a mesothelioma 
cancer stem cell therapy target.

Studies on slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) for decontamination and 
shelf life extension of beef are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the 
effects of SAEW and tea polyphenols (Tpp) on the microbiological, 
physicochemical, and sensory qualities of fresh beef during storage. The changes 
in total viable count, thiobarbituric acid content, pH, total volatile basic 
nitrogen, and sensory scores revealed that the required quality standard of the 
beef treated with distilled water, Tpp, and SAEW was maintained for up to 6-8, 
12-14, and 14-16 days, respectively. These results demonstrated that SAEW could 
effectively extend the shelf life of beef in comparison with that of other 
treatments. However, there were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between 
the untreated and SAEW-treated group in the content of thiobarbituric acid, 
suggesting that SAEW does not possess antioxidant activity. Therefore, further 
studies are required to increase its antioxidant activity. This study suggests 
that SAEW treatment is an effective and promising method to prolong the shelf 
life of beef by around 8 days at 4°C.

[Mortality parameters of patients with occupational diseases and evaluation of 
medical care quality].

[Article in Russian]

Izmerov NF, Pictushanskaya TE.

The authors analyzed mortality parameters among occupational disease patients in 
coal industry over 1968- 2014 (9271 cases). Findings are significant increase in 
age and length of service in workers first registered in occupational pathology 
center, and 6-fold decrease of life span from occupational disease diagnosis 
till death. The authors necessitate specification and implementation of 
follow-up procedure in workers with high occupational risk-and in occupational 
diseases patients, and complex medical rehabilitation for individuals with 
primary stage of occupational diseases.

BACKGROUND: Daclatasvir (DCV) combinated with Sofosbuvir (SOF) has shown good 
efficacy and safety profile for HCV patients. The aim was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of DCV/SOF regimen versus HCV alternative treatments for 
patients who failed to achieve the SVR12 after a first DAA treatment from 
Italian perspective (PITER cohort).
METHODS: A Markov model of HCV chronically infected patients was used to develop 
two scenarios: 1) DCV+ SOF versus Ledipasvir (LDV)+ SOF in Genotype (Gt)1 and 
Gt4; 2) DCV+ SOF versus no retreatment option in Gt1, Gt3, and Gt4. The 
percentage of patients who failed the first line with SOF/Simeprevir/Ribavirin 
(RBV) or SOF/RBV and were retreated or not according to evidences from PITER 
cohort, were used to populate the model. HCV resources consumption and SVR rates 
were quantified using PITER data. Transition probabilities and utility rates 
were derived from the literature. The outcomes were expressed in terms of 
Quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) 
was performed considering a cost-effectiveness threshold of € 30,000/QALY.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, DCV+ SOF represents a cost-effectiveness 
therapy with ICERs lower than the threshold. The PSA showed robust results, 
ICERs remain below the threshold in 94% and 99% simulations in Scenario 1 and 2, 
respectively.

INTRODUCTION: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement gene testing is 
used increasingly to identify patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) who are most likely to benefit from crizotinib. This study was to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the ALK tests followed by crizotinib compared 
to the standard chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC from the Chinese healthcare 
system perspective.
METHODS: A 10-year Markov model was constructed to compare the costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of crizotinib with standard chemotherapy, 
guided by the ALK rearrangement tests: next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel 
tests and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The health states 
included progression-free survival (PFS), progressed survival, and death. The 
costs examined included cost of drugs (pemetrexed, standard chemotherapy, 
salvage chemotherapy, and crizotinib), follow-up, palliative care, supportive 
care, severe adverse events, and ALK rearrangement testing.
RESULTS: Under Patient Assistance Program (PAP), the model demonstrated that the 
patients using NGS panel tests spent US $31,388 and gained 0.780 QALYs, whereas 
patients using multiplex PCR spent US $31,362 and gained 0.780 QALYs, 
respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of crizotinib with PAP 
compared to the control strategy were projected at $14,384 (NGS) and $13,740 
(multiplex PCR) per QALY gained, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed the 
utility of PFS and the costs of crizotinib and pemetrexed were the most 
impactful factors on the model outcomes. The results were robust to changes in 
all parameters.
CONCLUSION: ALK-rearrangement test positive followed by crizotinib may be 
cost-effective compared to standard chemotherapy from the Chinese healthcare 
system perspective when PAP was available.

INTRODUCTION: The use of multimodal computed tomography imaging (MMCT) in 
routine clinical assessment of stroke patients improves the identification of 
patients with large regions of salvageable brain tissue, lower risk for 
haemorrhagic transformation, or a large vessel occlusion requiring endovascular 
therapy.
AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using MMCT compared to usual practice 
for determining eligibility for reperfusion therapy with alteplase using real 
world data from the International Stroke Perfusion Imaging Registry (INSPIRE).
METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis. Mean costs and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) per patient for two alternative screening protocols were 
calculated. Protocol 1 represented usual practice, while Protocol 2 reflected 
treatment targeting using multimodal imaging. Cost-effectiveness was assessed 
using the net-benefit framework.
RESULTS: Protocol 1 had a total mean per patient cost of $2,013 USD and 0.148 
QALYs. Protocol 2 had a total mean per patient cost of $1,519 USD and 0.153 
QALYs. For a range of willingness-to-pay values, representing implicit 
thresholds of cost-effectiveness, the lower bound of the incremental net 
monetary benefit statistic was consistently greater than zero, indicating that 
MMCT is cost- effective compared to usual practice. The results were most 
sensitive to variation in the mean number of alteplase vials administered.
CONCLUSION: In a healthcare setting where multimodal imaging technologies are 
available and reimbursed, their use in screening patients presenting with acute 
stroke to determine eligibility for alteplase treatment is cost-effective given 
a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds and warrants consideration as an 
alternative to routine practice.

Smoking is a major contributor to the disparity in life expectancy between those 
with and without a mental health condition. Previous work has found associations 
between individual conditions such as depression and current smoking, cigarette 
consumption and dependence, but did not compare a range of specific mental 
disorders. Using data from the nationally-representative Adult Psychiatric 
Morbidity Survey, we characterised trends in smoking prevalence in the general 
population in Great Britain and among those with and without mental health 
conditions for the period 1993-2014. We tested associations across different 
common mental health conditions (including depression, phobia, generalised 
anxiety and mixed anxiety and depression), in addition to personality 
conditions, and heaviness of smoking, desire to quit, perceived difficulty of 
remaining abstinent and successful cessation within the previous 12 months. 
Smoking prevalence among those without any mental health condition decreased 
from 29.3% in 1993 to 19.6% in 2014. Prevalence was higher among those with a 
condition but fell from 44.6% to 34.1%. Having a mental health condition was 
associated with current smoking, heavy smoking, difficulty remaining abstinent, 
desire to quit and perceived difficulty remaining abstinent. The same was found 
for all conditions individually but the strength and significance of the 
associations varied. Having any common mental health condition was associated 
with lower odds of smoking cessation-but not after adjustment for heavy smoking. 
We found no significant associations between individual conditions and cessation 
outcomes, however. In summary, smoking prevalence among people with common 
mental health conditions remained around 50% higher than among those without 
despite their higher desire to quit. Adequately addressing higher dependence 
could support cessation and contribute to narrowing health disparities.

BACKGROUND: Difference in life expectancy between males and females has been 
suggested to rest on sex difference in physiological dysregulation. But 
allostatic load, a physiological index, has not been carefully examined for an 
extended period beyond middle age. We aim to draw longitudinal trajectories of 
allostatic load in a national sample of older Americans and Britons; also to 
examine sex-based trajectories and factors behind their differences.
METHODS: We studied men and women aged ≥50 years participating in the Health and 
Retirement Study Waves 8-11, 2006-2012 (N = 15,583 person-years) and the English 
Longitudinal Study of Ageing Waves 2, 4 and 6, 2004-2012 (N = 14,765 
person-years). Because of the difference in provenance, we included different 
number of biomarkers to calculate allostatic load in HRS and ELSA. In HRS we 
used 8 biomarkers (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, haemoglobin A1c, 
high-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, waist circumference, cystatin C, 
and C-reactive protein), while ELSA allostatic load was constructed from 10 
biomarkers (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, haemoglobin A1c, high-density 
lipoprotein, total cholesterol, waist circumference, BMI, triglyceride, 
fibrinogen and C-reactive protein). A growth curve model was fitted to repeated 
observations of allostatic load, demographic characteristics, socioeconomic 
position, comorbidities and health behaviours (smoking, drinking, and physical 
exercise). To account for attrition, a joint model was applied.
RESULTS: The analysis showed that allostatic load increases linearly with age in 
the U.S. However, there are different levels for males and females. In England 
allostatic load follows such different paths that their trajectories cross in 
later life.
CONCLUSIONS: Sex-based trajectories of allostatic load showed distinct female 
advantage and are mostly consistent with female advantage in life expectancy.

AIMS: Palliative radiotherapy (PRT) can relieve symptoms and improve quality of 
life, but remains underutilised, possibly due to lack of referrals. We conducted 
a systematic review to study barriers impeding referral for PRT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched EMBASE and MEDLINE to identify published 
studies of physician barriers to PRT referral. Data were synthesised using the 
percentage of respondents to the surveys in these studies who identified a given 
factor as a significant barrier to PRT referral. Barriers were categorised using 
a conceptual framework for radiotherapy access described by Sundaresan et al. 
(Aust Health Rev 40 (1), 2016, 11-18.) RESULTS: EMBASE and MEDLINE searches 
returned 364 distinct papers. Of these, 11 papers (reporting on 12 cohorts of 
survey respondents) met the study inclusion criteria. All used a cross-sectional 
survey design. Seven cohorts included mainly family physicians, one surveyed 
mostly radiation oncologists, one surveyed hospice professionals and one 
surveyed members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American 
Society of Radiation Oncology and the American Academy of Hospice Palliative 
Medicine. Many factors were identified as strongly influencing referral 
decisions. Only two cohorts of respondents were asked whether patient wishes 
influence referrals, but most (78-82%) respondents in these cohorts agreed that 
it was an important influence. Other important barriers included functional 
status (five cohorts asked, cited as a strong influence by 53-78% of 
respondents), short life expectancy (three, 44-59%), treatment length (five, 
51-58%), inconvenience (six, 24-65%), cancer type (three, 55-80%), uncertainty 
of benefits (seven, 18-54%) and toxicity concerns (11, 18-43%). Hospice 
professionals most frequently cited factors related to expense of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Published high-quality data on barriers to PRT referral are limited 
to survey studies. Barriers to PRT referral include referrers' unfamiliarity 
regarding risks and benefits, cumbersome referral processes and perceived 
inconvenience of treatment. Interventions to increase referrals should be 
tailored to different professional groups and may include increased expert 
participation in multidisciplinary palliative care, shortening treatment courses 
and in-person interprofessional education.

Elucidation of the complex processes involved in plant growth requires analysis 
of the spatial gene expression patterns in all affected tissues. This protocol 
extension is an adaptation of a protocol that describes how to use barcoded 
oligo-dT microarrays to evaluate spatial global gene expression profiles in 
mammalian tissue to enable it to be applied to plant material. Here, we explain 
the required adjustments for preparing and treating plant tissue sections on the 
array surface, specifically in regard to how to permeabilize and remove the 
tissue. Once the tissue has been removed, the cDNA-mRNA hybrid that is left on 
the slide is processed in the same way as cDNA obtained during experiments on 
mammalian tissue; thus the later stages of the protocol are not included here, 
and readers should follow the accompanying protocol for those. We have 
previously used our protocol to generate high-quality sequencing libraries for 
Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescence, Populus tremula developing and dormant leaf 
buds, and Picea abies female cones. However, we anticipate that the protocol can 
be adapted to other tissue types and species. The entire protocol for preparing 
samples and processing libraries can be completed in 3-4 d.

OBJECTIVE: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), the earliest symptom in 
preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), is insufficient to identify individuals at 
risk for AD dementia. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether function in 
instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) contributes to identification.
METHODS: We analysed data of cognitively unimpaired participants of the 
prospective German Study on Ageing, Cognition, and Dementia in Primary Care 
Patients (AgeCoDe) and its extension, the Study on Needs, Health Service Use, 
Costs and Health-related Quality of Life in a Large Sample of Oldest-old Primary 
Care Patients (AgeQualiDe), collected over 10.5 years. Development of AD 
dementia was quantified as incidence rates (IRs) per 1000 person-years. Cox 
regression was used to assess the association of SCD and IADL function in regard 
to incident AD dementia.
RESULTS: Of 1467 included individuals, 792 (54.0%) reported SCD at baseline. 
Impaired IADL were present in 50 (3.4%) individuals. IR for AD dementia was 
highest in individuals with SCD and impaired IADL (49.7; 95% CI, 24.8-99.3). 
Unadjusted and adjusted Cox analyses revealed an increased AD dementia risk for 
individuals with SCD and impaired IADL (uHR = 6.1; 95% CI, 2.9-13.0; P < 0.001; 
aHR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.7; P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the SCD concept, IADL function was largely well 
preserved in the majority of individuals with SCD. However, if difficulties in 
IADL were present, risk for AD dementia was increased. Therefore, screening for 
IADL impairment could serve as an economically viable indicator to assess AD 
dementia risk above and beyond SCD.

Sex-biased dispersal: a review of the theory.

Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057, Zurich, Switzerland.

Dispersal is ubiquitous throughout the tree of life: factors selecting for 
dispersal include kin competition, inbreeding avoidance and spatiotemporal 
variation in resources or habitat suitability. These factors differ in whether 
they promote male and female dispersal equally strongly, and often selection on 
dispersal of one sex depends on how much the other disperses. For example, for 
inbreeding avoidance it can be sufficient that one sex disperses away from the 
natal site. Attempts to understand sex-specific dispersal evolution have created 
a rich body of theoretical literature, which we review here. We highlight an 
interesting gap between empirical and theoretical literature. The former 
associates different patterns of sex-biased dispersal with mating systems, such 
as female-biased dispersal in monogamous birds and male-biased dispersal in 
polygynous mammals. The predominant explanation is traceable back to Greenwood's 
() ideas of how successful philopatric or dispersing individuals are at gaining 
mates or the resources required to attract them. Theory, however, has developed 
surprisingly independently of these ideas: models typically track how 
immigration and emigration change relatedness patterns and alter competition for 
limiting resources. The limiting resources are often considered sexually 
distinct, with breeding sites and fertilizable females limiting reproductive 
success for females and males, respectively. We show that the link between 
mating system and sex-biased dispersal is far from resolved: there are studies 
showing that mating systems matter, but the oft-stated association between 
polygyny and male-biased dispersal is not a straightforward theoretical 
expectation. Here, an important understudied factor is the extent to which 
movement is interpretable as an extension of mate-searching (e.g. are matings 
possible en route or do they only happen after settling in new habitat - or can 
females perhaps move with stored sperm). We also point out other new directions 
for bridging the gap between empirical and theoretical studies: there is a need 
to build Greenwood's influential yet verbal explanation into formal models, 
which also includes the possibility that an individual benefits from mobility as 
it leads to fitness gains in more than one final breeding location (a 
possibility not present in models with a very rigid deme structure). The order 
of life-cycle events is likewise important, as this impacts whether a departing 
individual leaves behind important resources for its female or male kin, or 
perhaps both, in the case of partially overlapping resource use.

Objective: To evaluate whether administration of antenatal late-preterm 
betamethasone is cost-effective in the immediate neonatal period.Study design: 
Cost-effectiveness analysis of late-preterm betamethasone administration with a 
time horizon of 7.5 days was conducted using a health-system perspective. Data 
for neonatal outcomes, including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), transient 
tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), and hypoglycemia, were from the Antenatal 
Betamethasone for Women at Risk for Late-Preterm Delivery trial. Cost data were 
derived from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project from the Agency for 
Health Care Research and Quality, and utilities of neonatal outcomes were from 
the literature. Outcomes were total costs in 2017 United States dollars and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each individual infant as well as for a 
theoretical cohort of the 270 000 late-preterm infants born in 2015 in the 
USA.Results: For an individual patient, compared to withholding betamethasone, 
administering betamethasone incurred a higher total cost ($6592 versus $6265) 
and marginally lower QALYs (0.02002 QALYS versus 0.02006 QALYs) within the 
studied time horizon. For the theoretical cohort of 270 000 patients, 
administration of betamethasone was $88 million more expensive ($1780 million 
versus $1692 million) with lower QALYs (5402 QALYs versus 5416 QALYs), compared 
to withholding betamethasone. For administration of betamethasone to be 
cost-effective, the rate of hypoglycemia, RDS, or TTN among late-preterm infants 
receiving betamethasone would need to be less than 20.0, 4.5, and 2.4%, 
respectively.Conclusion: Administration of betamethasone in the late-preterm 
period is likely not cost-effective in the short-term.

Background The decision to initially implant an implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is informed by robust randomized controlled 
trials, but no such data exist to guide the decision to replace an ICD 
generator. In this study, we aimed to determine outcomes after ICD generator 
replacement. Methods All patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy 
who underwent ICD generator replacement from 2001 to 2011 at Mayo Clinic, MN, or 
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, MA, were included. Outcomes included (1) 
appropriate therapy after generator replacement and (2) death before appropriate 
therapy after generator replacement. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used 
to determine the associations between patient characteristics and outcomes. 
Results In 1421 patients undergoing ICD generator replacement (mean±SD age 
69.6±12.1 years, 81% male), appropriate therapy occurred after replacement in 
435 patients (30.6%) over a mean follow-up of 2.7±2.6 years. Associated factors 
included lower left ventricular ejection fraction and history of appropriate 
therapy before generator replacement. Death before appropriate ICD therapy 
occurred in 336 (23.7%) patients. Older age, lower left ventricular ejection 
fraction, and noncardiac comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, chronic 
lung disease, peripheral vascular disease, lower hemoglobin, and lower 
glomerular filtration rate, were associated with greater risk of death before 
appropriate therapy. A progressive increase in mortality was observed with 
aggregation of these noncardiac comorbidities. Conclusions The decision to 
replace the ICD should take into consideration not only left ventricular 
ejection fraction and history of ventricular arrhythmias, but also comorbid 
illnesses that may impact the duration and the quality of life.

Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants for Mechanical Heart Valves: Is the 
Door Still Open?

The estimated prevalence of mitral or aortic valvular heart disease is ≈2.5% in 
the general population of Western countries, and is expected to rise with 
population aging. A substantial proportion of patients with valvular heart 
disease undergoes surgical valve replacement. Mechanical heart valves are much 
more durable than bioprostheses, and are thus preferentially implanted in 
patients with a longer life expectancy, but have the major drawback of requiring 
lifelong anticoagulation to prevent valve thrombosis because of their higher 
thrombogenicity. The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are 
replacing vitamin K antagonists in many settings, including bioprostheses, 
because of their favorable safety and efficacy profiles. However, mechanical 
heart valves currently pose an absolute contraindication to NOACs based on the 
results of a single phase II study comparing dabigatran and warfarin (RE-ALIGN 
[Randomized, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oral 
Dabigatran Etexilate in Patients after Heart Valve Replacement]). That trial was 
stopped prematurely because of an excess of both stroke and bleeding with the 
dabigatran doses tested. Because of such negative findings, research in this 
area has been halted. We believe that several aspects of both the preclinical 
studies and the RE-ALIGN trial should be critically reevaluated. In our opinion, 
1 single trial with a single NOAC does not represent sufficient evidence for 
dismissing a therapeutic strategy, anticoagulation with NOACs, that has shown 
better safety and at least similar efficacy as warfarin in the setting of atrial 
fibrillation and venous thromboembolism,. Herein, we reevaluate this topic to 
identify the patient profile that has the greatest likelihood of benefit from 
some of the NOACs, with a focus on factor Xa inhibitors, thus providing some 
perspectives for basic and translational research.

The study of aging relates to changes in physical and functional dimensions that 
occur over time in living organisms. Yet, a model that establishes the 
hierarchical relationship and interlaced time courses of molecular, phenotypic, 
and functional hierarchical domains of aging in humans has not been established. 
We propose that studying the mechanisms and consequences of aging through the 
lens of these hierarchical domains and their connections will provide clarity in 
semantics and enhance a translational perspective. The study of human aging 
would be most informative from a life course, longitudinal perspective, given 
that manifestations of aging are already detectable early in life at the 
molecular level, yet the phenotypic responses remain masked by 
compensatory/resiliency mechanisms. Understanding the nature of these mechanisms 
is paramount for developing interventions that reduce the burden of disease and 
disability in older persons.

Aging and diabetes mellitus are 2 well-known risk factors for cardiovascular 
disease (CVD). During the past 50 years, there has been an dramatic increase in 
life expectancy with a simultaneous increase in the prevalence of diabetes 
mellitus in the older population. This large number of older individuals with 
diabetes mellitus is problematic given that CVD risk associated with aging and 
diabetes mellitus. In this review, we summarize epidemiological data relating to 
diabetes mellitus and CVD, with an emphasis on the aging population. We then
