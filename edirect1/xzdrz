varying starting ages (40-60), stopping ages (64-84) and intervals (1-4 years) 
were simulated. The number of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and 
additional net costs (in €) per 1000 women were predicted (3.5% discounted) and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated to compare 
screening scenarios. Sensitivity analyses were performed using different 
assumptions. In total, 26 strategies covering all four intervals were on the 
efficiency frontier. Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20 000/QALY 
gained, the biennial 40 to 76 screening strategy was optimal. However, this 
strategy resulted in more overdiagnoses and false positives, and required a high 
screening capacity. The current strategy in the Netherlands, biennial 50 to 
74 years, was dominated. Triennial screening in the age range 44 to 71 (ICER 
9364) or 44 to 74 (ICER 11144) resulted in slightly more QALYs gained and lower 
costs than the current Dutch strategy. Furthermore, these strategies were 
estimated to require a lower screening capacity. Findings were robust when 
varying attendance and effectiveness of treatment. In conclusion, switching from 
biennial to triennial screening while simultaneously lowering the starting age 
to 44 can increase benefits at lower costs and with a minor increase in harms 
compared to the current strategy.

AIMS: Diabetic foot ulceration can contribute to lowered life expectancy and 
quality of life for people with diabetes, and yet, scant attention has been 
given to improving preventive and educational measures. This article uses a 
phenomenological approach to explore individuals' lived experiences of diabetic 
foot ulcerations to explore factors that can be harnessed to achieve improved 
outcomes.
DESIGN: This was a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews grounded 
in a phenomenological framework to explore how patients perceive and understand 
their foot problems.
METHODS: Study participants were recruited from February 2020 to February 2021 
from a tertiary referral centre that treats foot problems in persons with 
diabetes. A total of 15 Hispanic, Native American and White patients 
participated in the study. We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews 
which were audio recorded with the participant's consent. Interview data were 
transcribed and analysed with Dedoose data management software.
RESULTS: Analysis revealed findings in two primary domains: (1) how patients 
perceive foot ulceration, with themes around limited understandings of foot 
ulceration, close sensory observation of foot problems and barriers to ulcer 
perception and (2) how patients experience the timing of foot ulceration, with 
themes on how time perceptions shifted as foot problems became more serious, 
which correlated closely to how patients responded to their foot problems.
CONCLUSION: Despite the close sensory observation of their feet, people with 
diabetes face an array of barriers to recognizing and understanding the 
implications of diabetic foot ulceration, which can lead to delayed care 
seeking. Nurses can play a critical role in promoting patient education and 
improving patient self-management of foot ulcers.
IMPACT: This phenomenological study offers important lessons to guide nurses and 
other providers in enhancing patient self-management of DFUs and improving care 
outcomes by expanding an understanding of DFU early warning signs, the 
imperative to seek medical care quickly, and addressing possible barriers.

Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.

INTRODUCTION: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor osimertinib was recently approved for resected EGFR-mutant stages 
IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer due to improved disease-free survival (DFS) 
in this population compared with placebo. This study aimed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness (CE) of this strategy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov model using post-resection health 
state transitions with digitized DFS data from the ADAURA trial to compare cost 
and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 3 years of adjuvant osimertinib 
versus placebo over a 10-year time horizon. An overall survival (OS) benefit of 
5% was assumed. Costs and utility values were derived from Medicare 
reimbursement data and literature. A CE threshold of 3 times the gross domestic 
product per capita was used. Sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for adjuvant osimertinib was 
$317 119 per QALY-gained versus placebo. Initial costs of osimertinib are higher 
in years 1-3. Costs due to progressive disease (PD) are higher in the placebo 
group through the first 6.5 years. Average pre-PD, post-PD, and total costs were 
$2388, $379 047, and $502 937, respectively, in the placebo group, and $505 775, 
$255 638, and $800 697, respectively, in the osimertinib group. Sensitivity 
analysis of OS gains reaches CE with an hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70-0.75 benefit 
of osimertinib over placebo. A 50% discount to osimertinib drug cost yielded an 
ICER of $115 419.
CONCLUSIONS: Three-years of adjuvant osimertinib is CE if one is willing to pay 
$317 119 more per QALY-gained. Considerable OS benefit over placebo or other 
economic interventions will be needed to reach CE.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) 
association with cancer and its clinical implications.
METHODS: IMNM cases were identified 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2020 matching 
sex and age controls (4:1).
RESULTS: A total of 152 patients with IMNM were identified and among 
serologically tested, 60% (83/140) were HMGCR-IgG+, 14% (20/140) were SRP-IgG+ 
and 26% (37/140) were seronegative. Cancer rates were not significantly 
different between serological subgroups; 18.1% (15/83) HMGCR-IgG+, 25% (5/20) 
SRP-IgG+ and 30% (11/37) seronegative (P = 0.34). Cancer screening was performed 
within 12 months from IMNM diagnosis in 88% (134/152) (whole-body CT plus 
FDG-PET CT in 53, CT alone in 72 and FDG-PET alone in 9). FDG-PET/CT was 
positive in 73% (25/34) of cancers. Increasing age was the only risk associated 
with cancer (P = 0.02). The odds of developing cancer at ±3 or ±5 years from 
IMNM diagnosis was not higher than controls (OR = 0.49; CI: 0.325-0.76). 
Lifetime IMNM diagnosis of cancer was less compared with controls (OR = 0.5 CI: 
0.33-0.78, P = 0.002). Most patients responded to treatment (137/147, 
P < 0.001). Death and treatment response did not significantly differ between 
cancer [23% (8/34); 88% (29/33)] and non-cancer patients [19% (23/118); 92% 
(108/118)]. In total, 13% (20/152) of patients died during follow-up compared 
with 14% (41/290) of medicine and 16% (46/290) of neurology controls (P = 0.8). 
Seropositives had greater life expectancy than seronegatives (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Greater cancer risk is not observed in IMNM vs controls. Cancer 
screening in IMNM should be individualized based on age-personal and family 
history, including consideration of FDG-PET/CT. Immune-treatment response did 
not differ with cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic infection due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) is frequently 
asymptomatic even in advanced stages of liver disease. Implementation of a 
screening program based on different HCV tests may enable an earlier diagnosis 
of HCV liver disease and subsequent application of highly effective treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov model which compares three different screening 
strategies for hepatitis C versus no screening in low-risk prevalence (general 
population) and high-risk prevalence population (people who inject drugs or 
prison population) was designed, taking into account age at the start of 
screening and participation. The three strategies were: 1) serological detection 
of antibodies against the HCV, 2) dried blood spot test (DBS) to detect 
antibodies against HCV and 3) detection of RNA from HCV. Quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALY) were taken as a measurement of effectiveness. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated and a deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed.
RESULTS: All three screening strategies were found to be cost-effective with an 
ICER of €13,633, €12,015 and €12,328/QALY for AntiHCV, DBS-AntiHCV and DBS-RNA 
HCV, respectively. There was a decrease in mortality due to liver disease in 
comparison to no screening for AntiHCV (40.7% and 52%), DBS-AntiHCV (45% and 
80%) and DBS-RNA HCV (45.2% and 80%) for low-prevalence and high-prevalence 
populations, respectively.
CONCLUSION: All test interventions for HCV screening are cost-effective for the 
early detection of HCV infection, also achieving a reduction in mortality. Thus, 
implementation of screening programs for HCV should not be halted by decisions 
on monetary policy.

BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 crisis underscores the importance of preprints, 
as they allow for rapid communication of research results without delay in 
review. To fully integrate this type of publication into library information 
systems, we developed preview: a publicly available, central search engine for 
COVID-19-related preprints, which clearly distinguishes this source from 
peer-reviewed publications. The relationship between the preprint version and 
its corresponding journal version should be stored as metadata in both versions 
so that duplicates can be easily identified and information overload for 
researchers is reduced.
OBJECTIVE: In this work, we investigated the extent to which the relationship 
information between preprint and corresponding journal publication is present in 
the published metadata, how it can be further completed, and how it can be used 
in preVIEW to identify already republished preprints and filter those duplicates 
in search results.
METHODS: We first analyzed the information content available at the preprint 
servers themselves and the information that can be retrieved via Crossref. 
Moreover, we developed the algorithm Pre2Pub to find the corresponding reviewed 
article for each preprint. We integrated the results of those different 
resources into our search engine preVIEW, presented the information in the 
result set overview, and added filter options accordingly.
RESULTS: Preprints have found their place in publication workflows; however, the 
link from a preprint to its corresponding journal publication is not completely 
covered in the metadata of the preprint servers or in Crossref. Our algorithm 
Pre2Pub is able to find approximately 16% more related journal articles with a 
precision of 99.27%. We also integrate this information in a transparent way 
within preVIEW so that researchers can use it in their search.
CONCLUSIONS: Relationships between the preprint version and its journal version 
is valuable information that can help researchers finding only previously 
unknown information in preprints. As long as there is no transparent and 
complete way to store this relationship in metadata, the Pre2Pub algorithm is a 
suitable extension to retrieve this information.

PURPOSE: Patients with advanced and metastatic cervical cancer have a poor 
prognosis with a 1-year survival rate of 10%-15%. Recently, an antiangiogenic 
humanized monoclonal antibody bevacizumab has shown to improve the survival of 
these patients. This study was designed to assess the cost effectiveness of 
incorporating bevacizumab with standard chemotherapy for the treatment of 
patients with advanced and metastatic cervical cancer in India.
METHODS: Using a disaggregated societal perspective and lifetime horizon, a 
Markov model was developed for estimating the costs and health outcomes in a 
hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients with advanced and metastatic cervical 
cancer treated with either standard chemotherapy alone or in combination with 
bevacizumab. Effectiveness data for each of the treatment regimen were assessed 
using estimates from Gynecologic Oncology Group 240 trial. Data on 
disease-specific mortality in metastatic cervical cancer, health system cost, 
and out-of-pocket expenditure were derived from Indian literature. Multivariable 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for parameter 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: Over the lifetime of one patient with advanced and metastatic cervical 
cancer, bevacizumab along with standard chemotherapy results in a gain of 0.275 
(0.052-0.469) life-years (LY) and 0.129 (0.032-0.218) quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALY), at an additional cost of $3,816 US dollars (USD; 2,513-5,571) 
compared with standard chemotherapy alone. This resulted in an incremental cost 
of $19,080 USD (7,230-52,434) per LY gained and $34,744 USD (15,782-94,914) per 
QALY gained with the use of bevacizumab plus standard chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: Addition of bevacizumab to the standard chemotherapy is not cost 
effective for the treatment of advanced and metastatic cervical cancer in India 
at a threshold of 1-time per-capita gross domestic product.

BACKGROUND: Adaptation of existing guidelines can be an efficient way to develop 
contextualized recommendations. Transparent reporting of the adaptation approach 
can support the transparency and usability of the adapted guidelines.
OBJECTIVE: To develop an extension of the RIGHT (Reporting Items for practice 
Guidelines in HealThcare) statement for the reporting of adapted guidelines 
(including recommendations that have been adopted, adapted, or developed de 
novo), the RIGHT-Ad@pt checklist.
DESIGN: A multistep process was followed to develop the checklist: establishing 
a working group, generating an initial checklist, optimizing the checklist 
(through an initial assessment of adapted guidelines, semistructured interviews, 
a Delphi consensus survey, an external review, and a final assessment of adapted 
guidelines), and approval of the final checklist by the working group.
SETTING: International collaboration.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 119 professionals participated in the development 
process.
MEASUREMENTS: Participants' consensus on items in the checklist.
RESULTS: The RIGHT-Ad@pt checklist contains 34 items grouped in 7 sections: 
basic information (7 items); scope (6 items); rigor of development (10 items); 
recommendations (4 items); external review and quality assurance (2 items); 
funding, declaration, and management of interest (2 items); and other 
information (3 items). A user guide with explanations and real-world examples 
for each item was developed to provide a better user experience.
LIMITATION: The RIGHT-Ad@pt checklist requires further validation in real-life 
use.
CONCLUSION: The RIGHT-Ad@pt checklist has been developed to improve the 
reporting of adapted guidelines, focusing on the standardization, rigor, and 
transparency of the process and the clarity and explicitness of adapted 
recommendations.

IL-2 is a cytokine clinically approved for the treatment of melanoma and renal 
cell carcinoma. Unfortunately, its clinical utility is hindered by serious side 
effects driven by the systemic activity of the cytokine. Here, we describe the 
design and characterization of a conditionally activated IL-2 prodrug, WTX-124, 
that takes advantage of the dysregulated protease milieu of tumors. WTX-124 was 
engineered as a single molecule containing an inactivation domain and a 
half-life extension domain that are tethered to a fully active IL-2 by 
protease-cleavable linkers. We show that the inactivation domain prevented IL-2 
from binding to its receptors in nontumor tissues, thereby minimizing the 
toxicity associated with systemic exposure to IL-2. The half-life extension 
element improves the pharmacokinetic profile of WTX-124 over free IL-2, allowing 
for greater exposure. WTX-124 was preferentially activated in tumor tissue by 
tumor-associated proteases, releasing active IL-2 in the tumor microenvironment. 
In vitro assays confirmed that the activity of WTX-124 was dependent on 
proteolytic activation, and in vivo WTX-124 treatment resulted in complete 
rejection of established tumors in a cleavage-dependent manner. Mechanistically, 
WTX-124 treatment triggered the activation of T cells and natural killer (NK) 
cells, and markedly shifted the immune activation profile of the tumor 
microenvironment, resulting in significant inhibition of tumor growth in 
syngeneic tumor models. Collectively, these data demonstrate that WTX-124 
minimizes the toxicity of IL-2 treatment in the periphery while retaining the 
full pharmacology of IL-2 in the tumor microenvironment, supporting its further 
development as a cancer immunotherapy treatment. See related Spotlight by Silva, 
p. 544.

The intrinsic rate of natural increase of a population (rm) has been in focus as 
a key parameter in entomology and acarology. It is considered especially 
important in studies of predators that are potential biological control agents 
of fast-growing pests such as mites, whiteflies and thrips. Life-table 
experiments under controlled laboratory conditions are standard procedures to 
estimate rm. However, such experiments are often time consuming and may 
critically depend on the precise assessment of the developmental time and the 
fecundity rate early in the reproductive phase. Using selected studies of 
predatory mites with suitable life-table data, we investigated whether and how 
measurements of growth rates can be simplified. We propose a new method for 
estimating rm from partial life tables, in which the researcher can choose a 
level of precision based on a stand-in measure of relative error. Based on this 
choice, the procedure helps the researcher to decide when a life-table 
experiment can be terminated. Depending on the chosen precision, significant 
amounts of experimental time can be saved without seriously compromising the 
reliability of the estimated growth parameter.

This paper focuses on effective messaging practices identified in data collected 
after 10 years of implementing a gain-framed messaging campaign encouraging 
healthier behaviors in middle-aged and older adults. In Study 1, we measured 
message recall and intended health behaviors in an intercept survey of 733 
adults. Binary logistic regression indicated that women were more likely than 
men to report intent to change behavior. Recalling messages from billboards or 
fliers was associated with a lower likelihood of intended behavior change, and 
media type was associated with intended behavior for those who saw the message 
online (reducing screen time) or on television (increasing physical activity and 
ceasing smoking). Study 2 focused on adult generational differences in response 
to the campaign and types of media used to access information. Data from an 
intercept survey of 604 clients at agencies serving low-income adults were 
segmented into three age groups: under 35, ages 35-54, and ages 55+. Recall and 
reaction to campaign materials differed by age group, and the influence of life 
stage factors and health costs varied across age groups. Television and 
newspapers were most frequently reported by the oldest group, and social media 
and online news/blogs were most frequently chosen by the youngest group. 
Campaign response of adults older than age 35 aligned with goals of improving 
health behaviors. Together, these studies indicate that diffuse messaging 
strategies may raise overall awareness, and targeted strategies may be more 
influential in motivating behavior change. Influential factors and media should 
be differentially leveraged to target different age cohorts of adults.

Roughly 150,000 malignant pleural effusions (MPE) are diagnosed in the United 
States each year. The majority of cases are caused by lung and breast cancer, 
and since MPE represents advanced disease, the prognosis is generally poor. In 
this article we review the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and prognosis of MPE. 
We then discuss the approach to diagnosis of MPE including the role of imaging, 
pleural fluid analysis, and medical thoracoscopy. Current management strategies 
for symptomatic MPE include repeated thoracentesis for patients with very 
limited life expectancy as well as more definitive procedures such as chemical 
pleurodesis, tunneled indwelling pleural catheters, and novel combined 
approaches. The choice of intervention is guided by the efficacy, local 
expertise, and risk, as well as patient factors and preferences.

[Benefits of bariatric surgery on weight loss, development of comorbidities and 
mortality].

BENEFITS OF BARIATRIC SURGERY ON WEIGHT LOSS, DEVELOPMENT OF COMORBIDITIES AND 
MORTALITY Bariatric surgery, mainly sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and gastric bypass 
(GBP) in France, induces a greater and more durable weight loss than current 
treatments in cases of morbid or severe obesity with co-morbidity. Bariatric 
surgery can also improve, or even put into remission, most of the pathologies 
associated with obesity, such as type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, arterial 
hypertension, dyslipidemia... An improvement in the quality of life and life 
expectancy of patients after bariatric surgery has been observed, even 
considering the operative risk and the discomfort generated by these procedures. 
The differences in efficacy, risk and discomfort at short and long term between 
SG and GPB do not allow to define a procedure of choice at the present time. The 
great effectiveness of bariatric surgery on diabetes associated with obesity, 
corresponding to the metabolic surgery concept, will probably lead to an 
extension of the operative indications.

Publisher: BÉNÉFICES DE LA CHIRURGIE BARIATRIQUE SUR LA PERTE PONDÉRALE, 
L’ÉVOLUTION DES COMORBIDITÉS ET LA MORTALITÉ Les interventions de chirurgie 
bariatrique, majoritairement sleeve gastrectomie (SG) et bypass gastrique (BPG) 
en France, induisent une perte de poids plus importante et plus durable que les 
traitements courants, en cas d’obésité morbide ou sévère avec comorbidité(s). La 
chirurgie bariatrique permet aussi d’améliorer, voire de mettre en rémission, la 
plupart des pathologies associées à l’état d’obésité, comme le diabète de type 
2, les apnées du sommeil, l’hypertension artérielle, les dyslipidémies… on 
observe une amélioration de la qualité et de l’espérance de vie des patients 
après chirurgie bariatrique, malgré le risque opératoire et les contraintes 
engendrées par ces interventions. Entre SG et BPG, les différences d’efficacité, 
de risque et de contraintes à court et long termes ne permettent pas, à l’heure 
actuelle, de définir une procédure de choix. La grande efficacité de la 
chirurgie bariatrique sur le diabète associé à l’obésité, correspondant à une 
véritable chirurgie métabolique, conduit à réfléchir sur l’extension des 
indications opératoires.

Thalassemia is a group of autosomal recessive hemoglobinopathies affecting the 
production of normal alpha- or beta-globin chains that comprise hemoglobin. 
Ineffective production of alpha- or beta-globin chains may result in ineffective 
erythropoiesis, premature red blood cell destruction, and anemia. Chronic, 
severe anemia in patients with thalassemia may result in bone marrow expansion 
and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Thalassemia should be suspected in patients 
with microcytic anemia and normal or elevated ferritin levels. Hemoglobin 
electrophoresis may reveal common characteristics of different thalassemia 
subtypes, but genetic testing is required to confirm the diagnosis. Thalassemia 
is generally asymptomatic in trait and carrier states. Alpha-thalassemia major 
results in hydrops fetalis and is often fatal at birth. Beta-thalassemia major 
requires lifelong transfusions starting in early childhood (often before two 
years of age). Alpha- and beta-thalassemia intermedia have variable 
presentations based on gene mutation or deletion, with mild forms requiring only 
monitoring but more severe forms leading to symptomatic anemia and requiring 
transfusion. Treatment of thalassemia includes transfusions, iron chelation 
therapy to correct iron overload (from hemolytic anemia, intestinal iron 
absorption, and repeated transfusions), hydroxyurea, hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation, and luspatercept. Thalassemia complications arise from bone 
marrow expansion, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and iron deposition in 
peripheral tissues. These complications include morbidities affecting the 
skeletal system, endocrine organs, heart, and liver. Life expectancy of those 
with thalassemia has improved dramatically over the past 50 years with increased 
availability of blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy, and improved iron 
overload monitoring. Genetic counseling and screening in high-risk populations 
can assist in reducing the prevalence of thalassemia.

In the era of widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), people with HIV 
(PWH) have a near-normal life expectancy. However, PWH have high rates of kidney 
diseases and progression to end-stage renal disease at a younger age. PWH have 
multiple risks for developing acute and chronic kidney diseases, including 
traditional risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and HIV-related factors 
such as HIV-associated nephropathy and increased susceptibility to infections 
and exposure to nephrotoxic medications. Despite an improvement in access to 
kidney transplant among PWH, the number of PWH on dialysis continues to 
increase. The expansion of the number of antiretrovirals (ARVs) and kidney 
replacement modalities, the absence of pharmacokinetic data, and therapeutic 
drug monitoring make it very challenging for providers to dose ARVs 
appropriately leading to medication errors, adverse events, and higher 
mortality. Most of the recommendations are either based on small sample size 
studies or extrapolated based on physiochemical characteristics of ART. We aim 
to review the most available and most current literature on ART in PWH with 
renal insufficiency and ART dosing recommendations on dialysis to ensure that 
PWH are provided with the safest and most effective ART regimen.

IMPORTANCE: Crisis standards of care (CSOC) scores designed to allocate scarce 
resources during the COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate racial disparities in 
health care.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association of a CSOC scoring system with resource 
prioritization and estimated excess mortality by race, ethnicity, and residence 
in a socially vulnerable area.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort analysis included 
adult patients in the intensive care unit during a regional COVID-19 surge from 
April 13 to May 22, 2020, at 6 hospitals in a health care network in greater 
Boston, Massachusetts. Participants were scored by acute severity of illness 
using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and chronic severity of 
illness using comorbidity and life expectancy scores, and only participants with 
complete scores were included. The score was ordinal, with cutoff points 
suggested by the Massachusetts guidelines.
EXPOSURES: Race, ethnicity, Social Vulnerability Index.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was proportion of patients in 
the lowest priority score category stratified by self-reported race. Secondary 
outcomes were discrimination and calibration of the score overall and by race, 
ethnicity, and neighborhood Social Vulnerability Index. Projected excess deaths 
were modeled by race, using the priority scoring system and a random lottery.
RESULTS: Of 608 patients in the intensive care unit during the study period, 498 
had complete data and were included in the analysis; this population had a 
median (IQR) age of 67 (56-75) years, 191 (38.4%) female participants, 79 
(15.9%) Black participants, and 225 patients (45.7%) with COVID-19. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the priority score was 
0.79 and was similar across racial groups. Black patients were more likely than 
others to be in the lowest priority group (12 [15.2%] vs 34 [8.1%]; P = .046). 
In an exploratory simulation model using the score for ventilator allocation, 
with only those in the highest priority group receiving ventilators, there were 
43.9% excess deaths among Black patients (18 of 41 patients) and 28.6% (58 of 
203 patients among all others (P = .05); when the highest and intermediate 
priority groups received ventilators, there were 4.9% (2 of 41 patients) excess 
deaths among Black patients and 3.0% (6 of 203) among all others (P = .53). A 
random lottery resulted in more excess deaths than the score.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, a CSOC priority score resulted in 
lower prioritization of Black patients to receive scarce resources. A model 
using a random lottery resulted in more estimated excess deaths overall without 
improving equity by race. CSOC policies must be evaluated for their potential 
association with racial disparities in health care.

The intent of this paper is to present a new idea for increasing the life 
expectancy of class II composite restorations where the proximal marginal seal 
is compromised by the necessity to rely on dentin bonding. As implied by the 
Clinical Relevance statement, studies show that bonding to dentin in areas with 
high levels of bacterial action, combined with sustained high plaque formation, 
tends to be the "Achilles heel" with regard to sustained long-term restorations. 
Therefore, this paper will present a thought experiment, combined with clinical 
evidence, for combining gold foil with composite in these areas for the class 
two composite restoration. The results, if proven viable, will be to develop a 
procedure utilizing the properties of gold foil that make it one of the 
longest-lasting restorative materials with the recent development of modern 
cosmetic materials for a truly long-lasting and healthy class II restoration.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the long-term and spatial patterns of incidence, 
prevalence, and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates of severe 
periodontitis in Asia from 1990 to 2019, and to estimate the associations 
between disease burden and socioeconomic development using the Socio-Demographic 
Index (SDI).
METHODS: Data were obtained from the global burden of disease study 2019. The 
average annual percent change (AAPC) was calculated to reflect temporal trends, 
spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted to estimate the spatial 
characteristics, and spatial panel models were used to investigate the 
association between SDI and severe periodontitis burden.
RESULTS: For Asia as a whole, the crude rates increased by 1.10% per year for 
incidence, 1.42% per year for prevalence, and 1.41% per year for DALY from 1990 
to 2019. The age-standardized incidence, prevalence and DALY rates increased by 
0.18%, 0.22%, and 0.23% per year, respectively. Spatially, the hot spots of 
age-standardized incidence, prevalence and DALY rates were located in Southern 
Asia, besides, these rates all showed increasing trends in most countries, and 
the increases were clustered in Southeastern Asia. Further, SDI showed a 
negative association with incidence (coef = -14.44; 95% CI: -24.63, -4.25) and 
prevalence (coef = -40.09; -51.81, -28.36), and a positive association with DALY 
rates (coef = 0.31; 0.23; 0.38).
CONCLUSIONS: Severe periodontitis poses a serious public health challenge in 
Asian countries with increasing temporal trends and substantial spatial 
inequalities. Effective geographically targeted public health interventions and 
strategies are needed to address the growing burden associated with severe 
periodontitis.

BACKGROUND: People with severe mental illness have significant comorbidities and 
a reduced life expectancy. This project answered the following question: what 
evidence is there relating to the organisation, provision and receipt of care 
for people with severe mental illness who have an additional diagnosis of 
advanced incurable cancer and/or end-stage lung, heart, renal or liver failure 
and who are likely to die within the next 12 months?
OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to locate, appraise and synthesise relevant 
research; to locate and synthesise policy, guidance, case reports and other grey 
and non-research literature; to produce outputs with clear implications for 
service commissioning, organisation and provision; and to make recommendations 
for future research.
REVIEW METHODS: This systematic review and narrative synthesis followed 
international standards and was informed by an advisory group that included 
people with experience of mental health and end-of-life services. Database 
searches were supplemented with searches for grey and non-research literature. 
Relevance and quality were assessed, and data were extracted prior to narrative 
synthesis. Confidence in synthesised research findings was assessed using the 
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation and the 
Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research approaches.
RESULTS: One hundred and four publications were included in two syntheses: 34 
research publications, 42 case studies and 28 non-research items. No research 
was excluded because of poor quality. Research, policy and guidance were 
synthesised using four themes: structure of the system, professional issues, 
contexts of care and living with severe mental illness. Case studies were 
synthesised using five themes: diagnostic delay and overshadowing, decisional 
capacity and dilemmas, medical futility, individuals and their networks, and 
care provision.
CONCLUSIONS: A high degree of confidence applied to 10 of the 52 Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation and Confidence in the 
Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research summary statements. Drawing on 
these statements, policy, services and practice implications are as follows: 
formal and informal partnership opportunities should be taken across the whole 
system, and ways need to be found to support people to die where they choose; 
staff caring for people with severe mental illness at the end of life need 
education, support and supervision; services for people with severe mental 
illness at the end of life necessitate a team approach, including advocacy; and 
the timely provision of palliative care requires proactive physical health care 
for people with severe mental illness. Research recommendations are as follows: 
patient- and family-facing studies are needed to establish the factors helping 
and hindering care in the UK context; and studies are needed that co-produce and 
evaluate new ways of providing and organising end-of-life care for people with 
severe mental illness, including people who are structurally disadvantaged.
LIMITATIONS: Only English-language items were included, and a meta-analysis 
could not be performed.
FUTURE WORK: Future research co-producing and evaluating care in this area is 
planned.
STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42018108988.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research 
(NIHR) Health and Social Care Delivery Research programme and will be published 
in full in Health and Social Care Delivery Research; Vol. 10, No. 4. See the 
NIHR Journals Library website for further project information.

This study highlighted a number of policy, service and practice issues, 
including supporting people where they choose to die, staff education, support 
and supervision, and proactive physical health care.
