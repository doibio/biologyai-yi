Background This study was conducted to estimate the distribution of and changes 
in the global disease burden of ischemic heart disease attributable to smoking 
between 1990 and 2019. Methods and Results Data used in this study come from the 
GBD 2019 (Global Burden of Disease Study 2019). Age-standardized rates and 
estimated annual percentage change of age-standardized rates were used to 
describe this burden and its changing trend. Pearson's correlation coefficient 
was used to evaluate the correlation between the sociodemographic index and 
changing trend. From 1990 to 2019, the burden of ischemic heart disease 
attributable to smoking has shown a downward trend globally; estimated annual 
percentage changes of age-standardized mortality rates and age-standardized 
disability-adjusted life-years rates were -2.012 (95% CI, -2.068 to -1.956) and 
-1.907 (95% CI, -1.975 to -1.838). Nineteen countries experienced an increase in 
disease burden, and the changes in 17 countries were not statistically 
significant. In addition, this burden was higher in men and older age groups. 
Estimated annual percentage change of the age-standardized rates of this burden 
were negatively correlated with the sociodemographic index. Conclusions Although 
the burden of ischemic heart disease attributable to smoking has decreased in 
>80% of countries or regions in the past 30 years, it has remained a significant 
issue in low- and middle-income countries, particularly among men and elderly 
populations. Therefore, active tobacco control measures, focusing on key 
populations, are required to reduce the associated burden of ischemic heart 
disease, especially in those countries or regions with increasing prevalence and 
disease burden.

BACKGROUND: CKD is becoming a major human health concern. Limited quantitative 
assessments of the burden of CKD due to glomerulonephritis have been performed. 
We performed a comprehensive analysis of the disease burden to update the 
epidemiology of this disease.
METHODS: Incidence, prevalence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) data and percent changes in these indicators were extracted from Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2019 to analyze the burden of CKD due to 
glomerulonephritis.
RESULTS: Globally, there were 606,300 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 560,100 to 
658,100) incident patients, 17,300,000 (95% UI, 16,100,000 to 18,600,000) 
prevalent patients, 183,700 (95% UI, 146,300 to 228,900) deaths, and 6,900,000 
(95% UI, 5,900,000 to 8,100,000) DALYs of CKD due to glomerulonephritis in 2019. 
Compared with those in 1990, the numbers of incident patients, prevalent 
patients, deaths, and DALYs increased by 77%, 81%, 100%, and 66%, respectively. 
Most of the disease burden was concentrated in countries with lower 
sociodemographic index. In Central Latin America, the disease burden was much 
higher than expected on the basis of its sociodemographic index. Decomposition 
analysis showed that population aging and growth were the two major drivers of 
the increase in DALYs. Frontier analysis revealed considerable opportunities to 
reduce the age-standardized DALYs in the middle of the sociodemographic-index 
spectrum. Although middle-aged and elderly individuals accounted for the 
majority of the disease burden, the highest incidence rate was observed in 
children aged 1-4 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of CKD due to glomerulonephritis has increased 
worldwide, especially in regions and countries with lower sociodemographic 
indexes.

BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a rare 
inherited disease, causes ventricular tachycardia, sudden cardiac death, and 
heart failure (HF). We investigated ARVC clinical features, genetic findings, 
natural history, and the occurrence of life-threatening arrhythmic events 
(LTAEs), HF death, or heart transplantation (HF-death/HTx) to identify risk 
factors.
METHODS: The clinical course of 111 consecutive patients with definite ARVC, 
predictors of LTAE, HF-death/HTx, and combined events were analyzed in the 
entire cohort and in a subgroup of 40 patients without sustained ventricular 
arrhythmia before diagnosis.
RESULTS: The 5-year cumulative probability of LTAE was 30% and HF-death/HTx was 
10%. Predictors of HF-death/HTx were reduced right ventricle ejection fraction 
(HR: 0.93; P=0.010), HF symptoms (HR: 4.37; P=0.010), epsilon wave (HR: 4.99; 
P=0.015), and number of leads with low QRS voltage (HR: 1.28; P=0.001). Each 
additional lead with low QRS voltage increased the risk of HF-death/HTx by 28%. 
Predictors of LTAE were prior syncope (HR: 1.81; P=0.040), number of leads with 
T wave inversion (HR: 1.17; P=0.039), low QRS voltage (HR: 1.12; P=0.021), 
younger age (HR: 0.97; P=0.006), and prior ventricular arrhythmia/ventricular 
fibrillation (HR: 2.45; P=0.012). Each additional lead with low QRS voltage 
increased the risk of LTAE by 17%. In patients without ventricular arrhythmia 
before clinical diagnosis of ARVC, the number of leads with low QRS voltage (HR: 
1.68; P=0.023) was independently associated with HF-death/HTx.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the characteristics of a specific cohort 
with a high prevalence of arrhythmic burden at presentation, male predominance, 
younger age and HF severe outcomes. Our main results suggest that the presence 
and extension of low QRS voltage can be a risk predictor for HF-death/HTx in 
ARVC patients, regardless of the arrhythmic risk. This study can contribute to 
the global ARVC risk stratification, adding new insights to the international 
current scientific knowledge.

A 5-month-old castrated male Smooth Fox Terrier presented for a 1-month history 
of right thoracic limb lameness. Physical examination revealed right elbow pain 
on extension and mild soft tissue swelling of the distal antebrachium. 
Radiographs and computed tomography showed elongated focal radiolucent regions 
in the distal radial metaphysis. There was incongruity of the right elbow with a 
short radius. Bone biopsy and histopathology of the regions confirmed a retained 
cartilaginous core characterised by bony trabeculae with frequently retained 
central cartilaginous cores. A dynamic proximal ulnar ostectomy was performed to 
improve elbow congruity. The owner was instructed to restrict activity to short 
leash walks for 8 weeks followed by a gradual activity increase. On follow-up 
examination 16 weeks after operatively, the lameness and elbow pain were 
resolved. Radiographs at that time showed a healed ulnar ostectomy, proper elbow 
congruity, and resolved retained cartilaginous core.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) with either duration 
included an attribute or with dead included as an option can be used as a 
stand-alone approach to value health states. This paper reports on a DCE with 
both of these features to develop an EQ-5D-5L value set for Australia.
METHODS: A DCE was undertaken using a large Australian panel of internet 
respondents, from which a sample of more than 4000 Australian adults was chosen, 
stratified to be population representative on age and gender. The DCE contained 
500 choice triplets, with two EQ-5D-5L health states with duration, and dead as 
the third option. Each respondent answered 12 choice sets from the 500, stating 
both the best and worst options from the three available. The design was 
constructed to estimate a utility algorithm with main effects plus some key 
interaction terms. A variety of approaches to parameterising interactions, and 
to anchoring the value set on the required 0-1 scale, were tested. A preferred 
Australian adult utility algorithm for use in cost-utility analysis was then 
generated.
RESULTS: In total, 4477 people completed at least one choice set and were 
included in the analysis. The results reflected the monotonic structure of the 
EQ-5D-5L, in that moving from no problems to extreme problems led to worsening 
utility in each dimension. Inclusion of interaction terms demonstrates that the 
disutility of the first dimension moving to a poor level (defined as either 
level 5, or level 4 or 5) had a large impact, but subsequent dimensions moving 
to a poor level had a relatively smaller disutility.
DISCUSSION: This work develops a value set for the EQ-5D-5L in Australia, and 
also provides a range of methodological insights which can inform future work 
using a stand-alone DCE to value health in other countries.

RATIONALE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of 
thromboembolism. This risk is currently assessed with scoring systems based on 
clinical characteristics. However, these tools have limited prognostic 
performance. Circulating biomarkers are proposed for improved prediction of 
major clinical events and individualization of treatments in patients with AF.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of precision medicine 
(PM), i.e., the use of combined biomarkers and clinical variables, in comparison 
to standard of care (SOC) for risk stratification in a hypothetical cohort of AF 
patients at risk of stroke.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to evaluate the costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of PM compared to SOC, over 20 years using a 
Canadian healthcare system perspective.
RESULTS: PM decreased the mean per-patient overall costs by 7% ($94,932 vs 
$102,057 [Canadian dollars], respectively) and increased the QALYs by 12% (8.77 
vs 7.68 QALYs, respectively). The calculated incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio was negative, indicating that PM is an economically dominant strategy. 
These results were robust to one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: PM compared to SOC is economically dominant and is projected to 
generate cost savings.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of Risperidone ISM on social functioning and 
health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in both short- and long-term treatment 
of patients with schizophrenia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This analysis was based on data from both phases of the 
PRISMA-3 study, including 433 relapsed patients from the double-blind (DB) phase 
of the PRISMA-3 trial who were treated for 12-weeks with once-monthly (every 28 
days) intramuscular Risperidone ISM 75 mg or 100 mg (n = 288), or placebo (n = 
145), as well as 174 patients transitioning from the DB to an open-label 52-week 
extension (OLE) phase, plus 41 de novo patients treated on a stable maintenance 
dose of oral risperidone. The clinician-administered Personal and Social 
Performance (PSP) scale and the patient-reported 20-item Subjective Well-being 
under Neuroleptics scale (SWN-20) were used to measure social functioning and 
HR-QoL outcomes, respectively.
RESULTS: Risperidone ISM significantly improved PSP total score from baseline to 
endpoint (Day 85) versus placebo in the DB phase with mean change total score 
(95% CI) of 10.7 (9; 12) compared to 4.8 (3; 7) for placebo (p < 0.0001). The 
statistically significant improvement was present from the first measurement 
time point (Day 29). SWN-20-measured HR-QoL increased on average in patients 
treated with Risperidone ISM in the DB phase. A significant improvement was also 
observed for PSP and SWN-20 scores from the OLE baseline to week 52 for patients 
transitioning from the DB phase. Stable de novo patients maintained similar PSP 
and SWN-20 scores during the whole OLE phase.
CONCLUSION: Risperidone ISM provided a rapid and sustained improvement in 
personal and social functioning, and HR-QOL without need of oral risperidone 
supplementation or loading doses. These findings, along with a fast onset of 
efficacy, could contribute to reinforcing the therapeutic alliance and possibly 
an earlier discharge. Moreover, patient functioning continued improving or was 
maintained with long-term treatment.

The secondary evolution of quadrupedality from bipedal ancestry is a rare 
evolutionary transition in tetrapods yet occurred convergently at least three 
times within ornithischian dinosaurs. Despite convergently evolving quadrupedal 
gait, ornithischians exhibited variable anatomy, particularly in the forelimbs, 
which underwent a major functional change from assisting in foraging and feeding 
in bipeds to becoming principal weight-bearing components of the locomotor 
system in quadrupeds. Here, we use three-dimensional multi-body dynamics models 
to demonstrate quantitatively that different quadrupedal ornithischian clades 
evolved distinct forelimb musculature, particularly around the shoulder. We find 
that major differences in glenohumeral abduction-adduction and long axis 
rotation muscle leverages were key drivers of mechanical disparity, thereby 
refuting previous hypotheses about functional convergence in major clades. Elbow 
muscle leverages were also disparate across the major ornithischian lineages, 
although high elbow extension muscle leverages were convergent between most 
quadrupeds. Unlike in ornithischian hind limbs, where differences are more 
closely tied to functional similarity than phylogenetic relatedness, mechanical 
disparity in ornithischian forelimbs appears to have been shaped primarily by 
phylogenetic constraints. Differences in ancestral bipedal taxa within each 
clade may have resulted in disparate ecomorphological constraints on the 
evolutionary pathways driving divergence in their quadrupedal descendants.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are some of the most important health 
challenges modern medicine and advanced societies face. Indeed, the number of 
patients affected by one of these illnesses will increase in the following years 
at the same rate that human life expectancy allows us to live longer. Despite 
many years of research, NDs remain invariably fatal. A complete understanding of 
the exact mechanisms leading to neuronal death, which will ideally allow 
preclinical detection and the development of effective treatments, has not yet 
been achieved. However, a great deal of information about ND pathology and the 
search for possible therapies has been acquired using animal models and more 
precisely transgenic mouse models. In this review, the main contributions of 
these powerful research tools in NDs as well as their advantages and caveats are 
discussed.

BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis, a chronic degenerative disease, is becoming a 
public health problem around the world due to increasing life expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the impact of knee osteoarthritis on the quality 
of life (QoL) of the patients and to identify factors associated with impaired 
QoL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional monocentric study 
including patients with knee osteoarthritis. The pain was evaluated by the 
Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The short form of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis 
Outcome Score (KOOS-PS) was used to assess functional impact. QoL was assessed 
using the OsteoArthritis of Knee Hip Quality Of Life (OAKHQOL) questionnaire.
RESULTS: Fifty patients were included. The mean age of patients was 59 ± 9 
years. The sex ratio was 0.25. At least one comorbidity was noted in 77% of 
patients. The mean disease duration was 8.82 years. Mean VAS pain and KOOS-PS 
were 6.8 ± 1.1 and 54.7 ± 9.6/100; respectively. Assessment of the QoL by 
OAKHQOL showed impaired QoL in all domains; the worst scores concerned the areas 
of social functioning and pain. Factors associated with an altered QoL were age 
> 65 years, longer disease duration, higher pain intensity, comorbidities, and 
functional impairment.
CONCLUSION: Our patients showed an impaired QoL in all domains, particularly in 
terms of physical activity and social functioning. Lower QoL scores were 
associated with age, comorbidities, pain, function, and disease duration. 
Factors associated with QoL should be considered in the management program of 
these patients. Screening and the treatment of comorbidities are also useful for 
the management of knee OA.

of Chicago Medicine & Biological Sciences, Chicago, Illinois.

»: Optimal care for pathologic fractures centers on the use of a 
multidisciplinary team; thus, whenever there is a concern for pathologic 
fracture and proper workup is unable to be performed, prompt referral to a 
center equipped to manage these injuries should occur.
»: Fixation strategies for pathologic fractures must take into account patient 
characteristics, cancer subtypes, and overall goals of treatment.
»: As the treatments of cancers improve, patient life expectancy with disease 
will improve as well. This will lead to an increase in the incidence of 
impending or completed pathologic fractures. The broader subspecialties of 
orthopaedics must be aware of general principles in the diagnosis and management 
of these injuries.

BACKGROUND: Measuring the health of the population is of great significance to 
the development of a region. We aimed to estimate the population, probability of 
death, and quality of life in western China.
METHODS: We calculated the age-specific mortality rate and prevalence rate of 
diseases and injuries using the Full Population Database and the Home Page of 
Inpatient Medical Record. We used multiple interpolation methods to insert 
missing information from the death data and the model of Kannisto to adjust the 
mortality rate for elderly individuals. The age-specific prevalence rate of 
diseases and injuries was adjusted according to the standard ratio of age and 
methods of equal proportional allocation. Life expectancy was calculated by a 
life table, and the quality of life was estimated using the Sullivan method.
RESULTS: The total population continued to increase in 2015 to 2019 in the 
Shaanxi Province, China. The mortality rate of children under five has improved, 
and the mortality rate of people over 65 is decreasing year by year. Life 
expectancy increased from 74.66 years in 2015 to 77.19 years in 2019. Even with 
the total risk of disease and injury, the health-adjusted life expectancy 
increased by 1.90 years within 5 years, and the number of unhealthy years 
significantly improved. Health-adjusted life expectancy increased by 1.75 years 
when only considered the ten major disease systems (tumors; endocrinology, 
nutrition and metabolism; mental and behavioral disorders; nervous system; 
sensory diseases; circulatory system; respiratory system; digestive system; 
genitourinary system; musculoskeletal system and connective tissue), and the 
number of unhealthy years increased slightly.
CONCLUSIONS: In the past five years, Shaanxi Province has made progress in 
improving life expectancy and controlling the development of chronic diseases. 
It is necessary to take specific preventive measures and improve the quality of 
basic public health services.

INTRODUCTION: The burden of rectal cancer in the elderly population continues to 
increase. The aim of this narrative review is to assess evidence updates on the 
management of elderly patients with rectal cancer.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The subject of rectal cancer in patients ≥70 years old was 
divided into different topics and, based on the research items, the literature 
review searched relevant studies from MEDLINE (via PubMed), Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE between January 2000 and November 
2022. Systematic reviews with or without meta-analyses, narrative reviews, 
randomized trials, and non-randomized cohort studies were included.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: For the fit elderly patient with preserved sphincter tone, 
standard-of-care surgical therapy should be pursued, whereas frail patients with 
more advanced disease could benefit from local excision as a palliative approach 
in combination with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or more intensive radiotherapy 
options. Laparoscopic total mesorectal excision is recommended after carefully 
evaluating the patient's medical history, performance status, and tumor 
characteristics. Conversely, local excision can be implemented when balancing 
frailty, oncological outcomes, functional outcomes, and life expectancy. A watch 
and wait strategy can be considered in selected frail elderly patients with 
low-rectal tumors in case of complete clinical response after neoadjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy, with a stringent surveillance protocol, at least in the first 
three years.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with rectal cancer, the adoption of strategies 
for patient involvement in healthcare decision-making is essential, as well as 
the evaluation of the social background and a discussion with the patient about 
therapeutic modalities.

Spongospora subterranea is a soilborne plasmodiophorid that causes powdery scab 
and root gall formation in potato. In this study, 18 cover crops suitable for 
use in dry, high-altitude potato production regions were assessed in potting mix 
trials to determine whether these cover crops altered S. subterranea population 
levels. Although S. subterranea appeared to invade roots of all plant species 
tested, the pathogen was unable to complete its life cycle on 11 of 18 cover 
crops based on postharvest qPCR and microscopy results. Buckwheat, legumes, and 
scarlet barley do not appear to support pathogen replication, but the pathogen 
may be able to complete its life cycle in some mustards. High variability 
occurred in the experiments and part of this may be due to the natural 
infestations of peat-based potting mix with S. subterranea. A tomato bioassay 
was used to confirm that commercial sources of peat-based potting mix were 
infested with S. subterranea. Dry heat and autoclaving were tested as sanitation 
methods and multiple rounds of autoclaving were required to reduce viable S. 
subterranea in potting mix. A second cover crop experiment with autoclaved 
potting mix was conducted and it confirmed that buckwheat, legumes, and barley 
do not support S. subterranea replication but that some brassica crops may be 
hosts of this pathogen. The results suggest that buckwheat, legumes, and barley 
pose the least risk as cover crops in S. subterranea infested fields and show 
that peat-based potting mix should not be used in seed potato production.

Temperate Zone Isolation by Climate: An Extension of Janzen's 1967 Hypothesis.

Wishingrad V, Thomson RC.

AbstractOne of the most stunning patterns of the distribution of life on Earth 
is the latitudinal biodiversity gradient. In an influential article, Janzen 
(1967) predicted that tropical mountains are more effective migration barriers 
than temperate mountains of the same elevation, because annual temperature 
variation in the tropics is lower. A great deal of research has demonstrated 
that the mechanism envisioned by Janzen operates at broad latitudinal scales. 
However, the extent that the mechanism mediates biodiversity generally, and at 
smaller scales, is far less understood. We investigated whether climate overlap 
is associated with genetic similarity between populations within temperate 
regions using lizards in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California as a 
study system. By comparing genetic differentiation between high- and 
low-elevation populations, we found that in addition to the expected strong 
pattern of isolation by distance, high climate overlap was negatively associated 
with genetic differentiation, indicating that population pairs that inhabit 
climatically similar environments are less genetically differentiated. Moreover, 
while climate overlap between high- and low-elevation sites is predicted to 
increase from the equator to temperate regions, we find that in adjacent 
mountain ranges at the same latitude in temperate regions, climate overlap 
values can vary widely. This study suggests that in addition to the well-studied 
main effect of latitude on climate overlap and population differentiation, local 
climate factors within bioclimatic regions can also influence genetic 
differentiation between populations and do so by the same general mechanism that 
operates at larger geographic scales.

A family of non-empirical double-hybrid (DH) density functionals, such as 
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)0-DH, PBE-QIDH, and their range-separated exchange 
(RSX) versions RSX-0DH and RSX-QIDH, all using Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof(PBE) 
exchange and correlationfunctionals, is applied here to calculate the excitation 
energies for increasingly longer linear and cyclic acenes as part of their 
intense benchmarking for excited states of all types. The energies for the two 
lowest-lying singlet 1La and 1Lb states of linear oligoacenes as well as the 
triplet 3La and 3Lb states, are calculated and compared with experimental 
results. These functionals clearly outperform the results obtained from hybrid 
functionals and favorably compare with other double-hybrid expressions also 
tested here, such as B2-PLYP, B2GP-PLYP, ωB2-PLYP, and ωB2GP-PLYP. The study is 
complemented by the computation of adiabatic S0-T1 singlet-triplet energy 
difference for linear acenes as well as the extension of the study to strained 
cyclic oligomers, showing how the family of non-empirical expressions robustly 
leads to competitive results.

BACKGROUND: Costs of informal care are ignored in many cost-effectiveness 
analyses (CEAs) conducted from a societal perspective; however, these costs are 
relevant for lifesaving interventions targeted at the older population. In this 
study, we estimated informal care costs by age and proximity to death across 
European regions and showed how these estimates can be included in CEAs.
METHODS: We estimated informal care costs by age and proximity to death using 
generalised linear mixed-effects models. For this, we selected deceased singles 
from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement, which we grouped by four 
European regions. We combined the estimates of informal care costs with life 
tables to illustrate the impact of including informal care costs on the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a hypothetical intervention that 
prevents a death at different ages.
RESULTS: Informal care use, and hence informal care costs, increase when 
approaching death and with increasing age. The impact of including informal care 
costs on the ICER varies between €200 and €17,700 per quality-adjusted life-year 
gained. The impact increases with age and is stronger for women and in southern 
European countries.
CONCLUSION: Our estimates of informal care costs facilitate including informal 
care costs in CEAs of life-extending healthcare interventions. Including these 
costs may influence decisions as it leads to reranking of life-extending 
interventions compared with interventions improving quality of life.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence invited the manufacturer 
(Galapagos) of filgotinib (Jyseleca®), as part of the Single Technology 
Appraisal process, to submit evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost 
effectiveness of filgotinib for treating moderately to severely active 
ulcerative colitis in adults who have had an inadequate response, loss of 
response or were intolerant to a previous biologic agent or conventional 
therapy. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with Maastricht 
University Medical Centre+, was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence 
Review Group. This paper summarises the company submission, presents the 
Evidence Review Group's critical review on the clinical and cost-effectiveness 
evidence in the company submission, highlights the key methodological 
considerations and describes the development of the National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence guidance by the Appraisal Committee. The company 
submission included one relevant study for the comparison of filgotinib versus 
placebo: the SELECTION trial. As there was no head-to-head evidence with any of 
the comparators, the company performed two separate network meta-analyses, one 
for the biologic-naïve population and one for the biologic-experienced 
population, and for both the induction and maintenance phases. The Evidence 
Review Group questioned the validity of the maintenance network meta-analysis 
because it assumed all active treatments to be comparators in this phase, which 
is not in line with clinical practice. The economic analysis used a number of 
assumptions that introduced substantial uncertainty, which could not be fully 
explored, for instance, the assumption that a risk of loss of response would be 
independent of health state and constant over time. Company and Evidence Review 
Group results indicate that at its current price, and disregarding confidential 
discounts for comparators and subsequent treatments, filgotinib dominates some 
comparators (golimumab and adalimumab in the company base case, all but 
intravenous and subcutaneous vedolizumab in the Evidence Review Group's base 
case) in the biologic-naïve population. In the biologic-experienced population, 
filgotinib dominates all comparators in both the company and the Evidence Review 
Group's base case. Results should be interpreted with caution as some important 
uncertainties were not included in the modelling. These uncertainties were 
mostly centred around the maintenance network meta-analysis, loss of response, 
health-related quality-of-life estimates and modelling of dose escalation. The 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended filgotinib within 
its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating moderately to severely 
active ulcerative colitis in adults when conventional or biological treatment 
cannot be tolerated, or if the disease has not responded well enough or has 
stopped responding to these treatments, and if the company provides filgotinib 
according to the commercial arrangement.
