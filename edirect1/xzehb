Understanding the determinants of multimorbidity, including whether they are 
causal, may help with the design and prioritisation of prevention interventions. 
This study seeks to assess the causality of education, BMI, smoking and alcohol 
as determinants of multimorbidity, and the degree to which BMI, smoking and 
alcohol mediate differences in multimorbidity by level of education.
METHODS: Participants were 181,214 females and 155,677 males, mean ages 56.7 and 
57.1 years respectively, from UK Biobank. We used a Mendelian randomization 
design; an approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to 
interrogate causality.
RESULTS: The prevalence of multimorbidity was 55.1%. Mendelian randomization 
suggests that lower education, higher BMI and higher levels of smoking causally 
increase the risk of multimorbidity. For example, one standard deviation 
(equivalent to 5.1 years) increase in genetically-predicted years of education 
decreases the risk of multimorbidity by 9.0% (95% CI: 6.5 to 11.4%). A 5 kg/m2 
increase in genetically-predicted BMI increases the risk of multimorbidity by 
9.2% (95% CI: 8.1 to 10.3%) and a one SD higher lifetime smoking index increases 
the risk of multimorbidity by 6.8% (95% CI: 3.3 to 10.4%). Evidence for a causal 
effect of genetically-predicted alcohol consumption on multimorbidity was less 
strong; an increase of 5 units of alcohol per week increases the risk of 
multimorbidity by 1.3% (95% CI: 0.2 to 2.5%). The proportions of the association 
between education and multimorbidity explained by BMI and smoking are 20.4% and 
17.6% respectively. Collectively, BMI and smoking account for 31.8% of the 
educational inequality in multimorbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: Education, BMI, smoking and alcohol consumption are intervenable 
causal risk factors for multimorbidity. Furthermore, BMI and lifetime smoking 
make a considerable contribution to the generation of educational inequalities 
in multimorbidity. Public health interventions that improve population-wide 
levels of these risk factors are likely to reduce multimorbidity and 
inequalities in its occurrence.

BACKGROUND: Disparities in life expectancy between socioeconomic groups are one 
of the main challenges for health policy, and their reduction over time is an 
important policy objective.
METHODS: Observational study using routinely registered data on mortality around 
2011 and 2016 by sex, age, educational attainment level, and cause of death in 
13 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD). The main outcome measures are life expectancy by education at the ages 
of 25 and 65 in 2011 and 2016.
RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2016, the life expectancy gap has increased by 
0·2 years among men and 0·3 years among women from 13 available countries. The 
United States recorded one the largest increases in the absolute life expectancy 
gap, 1·3 years for women and 1·1 years for men respectively.
CONCLUSION: Inequality in longevity has increased in over half of the countries 
surveyed and starkly so in the United States in a context of deteriorating 
health.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly changed the treatment of 
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and improved outcomes for patients with CML in 
chronic phase (CML-CP) and accelerated phase (AP). Now armed with numerous 
effective therapeutic options, clinicians must consider various patient- and 
disease-specific factors when selecting the most appropriate TKI across lines of 
therapy. While most patients with CML expected to have a near-normal life 
expectancy due to the success of TKIs, emphasis has expanded beyond response and 
survival to include factors like quality of life, tolerability, and long-term 
toxicity management. Importantly, a subset of patients can achieve sustained 
deep molecular response and can attain treatment-free remission. Despite these 
successes, unmet needs remain related to CML treatment, including the persistent 
challenge of treatment resistance and intolerance, broadening treatment options 
for patients with resistance mutations or serious comorbidities, and focus on 
specific populations such as children and young adults. In particular, the only 
previously available treatments for patients with CML-CP with the T315I mutation 
were ponatinib, olverembatinib (exclusively approved for use in China at the 
time of this writing), omacetaxine, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Asciminib has entered the CML treatment landscape as a new option for adult 
patients with CML-CP who have received ≥2 prior TKIs or those with the T315I 
mutation. Asciminib's unique mechanism of action, Specifically Targeting the ABL 
Myristoyl Pocket, sets it apart from traditional adenosine 
triphosphate-competitive TKIs. While asciminib may overcome unmet needs for 
patients with CML-CP and continues to be studied in other novel settings, 
guidance on how to integrate asciminib in treatment algorithms is needed. This 
review focuses on clinical data and how asciminib can overcome current unmet 
needs, discusses how to individualize patient selection, and highlights future 
directions to investigate asciminib in earlier lines of therapy and in children 
and adolescents.

INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of hypothyroidism increases along with aging, 
resulting in one of the most common comorbidities among patients over 75 years. 
The leading causes of hypothyroidism in older adults are iatrogenic, Hashimoto's 
thyroiditis, and medications.
AIMS: The narrative review aimed to discuss the clinical characteristics of 
hypothyroidism in older adults and the impact of hormonal replacement therapy on 
survival rates.
RESULTS: Thyroid function declines over time due to physiological changes in the 
thyroid stimulating hormone signaling, iodine absorption and metabolism, thyroid 
hormone metabolism, and activity at peripheral sites. A serum TSH value over the 
upper limit of the normal reference range is not necessarily attributable to 
hypothyroidism. However, an appropriate diagnostic work-up is required to rule 
out true hypothyroidism and discriminate the etiology (i.e., thyroid autoimmune 
diseases, iodine deficiency, drug-induced hypothyroidism). Levothyroxine 
treatment should be considered in cases of overt hypothyroidism. A complete 
risk-to-benefit assessment, particularly considering the overall health status, 
life expectancy, cognitive function, mood, and cardiovascular and neurological 
background, should be considered before treating subclinical hypothyroidism with 
more potential benefits in patients under 75 years old. Levothyroxine 
formulations facilitating hormone absorption and increasing compliance to 
long-term treatment should be preferred. TSH target should usually be set over 3 
mIU/ml.
CONCLUSION: Defining optimal diagnostic approaches and targeted therapeutic 
strategies should be considered in the personalized management of aged patients 
with hypothyroidism.

INTRODUCTION: With the increasing life expectancy of Western populations, more 
octogenarians are presenting with large abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). 
Endovascular repair offers a less invasive alternative and older patients who 
may not have been offered open repair in the past are now being considered for 
elective repair with this approach. Age in isolation may not be the only 
consideration in recommending elective aneurysm repair. We aimed to review the 
literature on complex endovascular AAA repairs (mainly fenestrated endovascular 
aortic repair [FEVAR]) in octogenarians.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the Ovid Medline®, Embase® and 
Cochrane Library databases for articles published up to January 2022. All 
English language publications from 1995 onwards were eligible for inclusion. 
Search terms included: "FEVAR", "F-EVAR", "fenestrated EVAR", "fenestrated 
endovascular aortic repair", "fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair", 
"fenestrated AAA repair", "fenestrated endograft", "fenestrated stent graft", 
"fenestrated", "endograft", "EVAR", "octogenarian", "elderly", "above 80" and 
"over 80".
METHODS: The literature search identified 134 potential articles. Following 
qualitative assessment by two independent appraisers, this was refined to 11 
studies, in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement.
RESULTS: The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality, which was highly 
variable, ranging from 0% to 9% in octogenarians and from 0% to 5% in 
non-octogenarians. However, these differences were only found to be 
statistically significant in two studies. The secondary outcome measures 
included technical success rates, major adverse events, reintervention rates, 
freedom from reintervention, target vessel patency, freedom from target branch 
instability, and length of hospital and intensive care unit stay. No 
statistically significant differences were found between octogenarians and 
non-octogenarians. Long-term survival was significantly lower for octogenarians 
in two studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The perioperative outcomes of FEVAR in octogenarians are comparable 
with those of younger patients. FEVAR therefore appears to be an acceptable 
option for complex endovascular aneurysm repairs in carefully selected 
octogenarians. Nevertheless, this review highlights the paucity of published 
data on the outcomes of endovascular repair of complex aneurysms in 
octogenarians.

The specific aims of the current study were to determine and quantify the 
bioactive compounds derived from the cell-free supernatant (CFS) of Pediococcus 
acidilactici and screen their protective effect in frankfurters by applying an 
edible coating. This was achieved by immersing the peeled frankfurters in the 
CFS (CFS: 50% and 100%) alone or in combination with chitosan (CH: 0.5% and 1%) 
solutions for 3 min. Untreated frankfurter samples (control) exceeded the 
maximum acceptable total viable count limit (7.0 log10) on the 14th day, whereas 
samples treated with 100% CFS + 1% chitosan reached the limit on day 28 during 
refrigerated storage (P < 0.05). This treatment provided a 14-day extension to 
the shelf life of frankfurters without causing any significant changes in color 
and sensory attributes (P > 0.05). Additionally, this treatment inhibited 
oxidation in the frankfurters, leading to no significant changes in TBA and 
TVB-N within this group during storage (P > 0.05). This protective effect was 
mainly attributed to the wide variety of bioactive compounds identified in the 
CFS, including a total of 5 organic acids, 20 free amino acids, 11 free fatty 
acids, 77 volatiles, and 10 polyphenols. Due to these bioactive compounds, CFS 
exhibited a strong radical scavenging capacity (DPPH: 435.08 TEAC/L, ABTS: 
75.01 ± 0.14 mg TEAC/L; FRAP: 1.30 ± 0.03 mM FE/L) and antimicrobial activity 
against microorganisms primarily responsible for the spoilage of frankfurters. 
In conclusion, the results indicate that the CFS contains high levels of 
bioactive metabolites, and an edible chitosan coating impregnated with CFS can 
be utilized to extend the shelf life of frankfurters through its antimicrobial 
effects and oxidation stabilization.

Sperm cryodamage caused by cryopreservation limits the use of frozen yak 
spermatozoa in artificial insemination (AI). However, the proteomic changes 
involved in the cryodamage of yak spermatozoa have not been investigated to 
date. Therefore, this study aimed to identify proteins related to freezing 
tolerance. Tandem mass tag (TMT) were used in combination with liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for identifying 
differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between high-motility (HM) and 
low-motility (LM) frozen-thawed yak spermatozoa. A total of 116 DEPs were 
identified (>1.5-fold, P < 0.05); of which, 104 proteins were upregulated in HM 
spermatozoa and 12 proteins were upregulated in LM spermatozoa. The results of 
functional annotation analysis revealed that the DEPs were mainly involved in 
metabolic processes. A total of 20 DEPs that were abundantly expressed in HM 
spermatozoa were strongly associated with carbohydrate metabolism. The results 
of KEGG analysis revealed that the DEPs were enriched in 
glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, PPAR signaling pathway, and Ras signaling pathway. 
In addition, many antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD1), 
peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6), and Parkinson disease protein 7 (PARK7) were 
upregulated in HM spermatozoa, suggesting that these enzymes affect the motility 
of spermatozoa by regulating the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in 
frozen-thawed spermatozoa. Altogether, the findings of this study elucidate the 
mechanisms through which cryopreservation affects the movement of yak 
spermatozoa and offer a novel basis for refining freezing techniques and 
modifying cryopreservation extender components.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia-related stigma reduces the quality of life of people 
living with dementia and their care partners. However, there is a dearth of 
literature synthesising knowledge on stigma of dementia during the COVID-19 
pandemic. This scoping review protocol outlines a methodology that will be used 
to understand the impact of stigma on people living with dementia during the 
pandemic. Addressing dementia-related stigma is critical to promoting timely 
dementia diagnoses and enhancing the quality of life for people living with 
dementia and their care partners.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This review will follow the Arksey and O'Malley 
methodological framework and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. The review 
will focus on English-language, peer-reviewed literature published between 13 
January 2020 and 30 June 2023. Stigma will be broadly defined according to 
pre-established components (stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination). We will 
search six databases including CINAHL, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Medline, PsycINFO 
and Web of Science. We will also hand-search the reference lists of relevant 
articles to identify additional manuscripts. Two reviewers will develop the data 
extraction table, as well as independently conduct the data screening. Any 
disagreements will be resolved through open discussion between the two 
researchers, and if necessary, by consulting the full team to achieve consensus. 
Data synthesis will be conducted using an inductive thematic analysis approach.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This review will be the first to explore the impact of 
dementia-related stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic. An advisory panel 
including a person living with dementia and a care partner will be consulted to 
inform our review's findings and support the data dissemination process. The 
results of this scoping review will be shared and disseminated through 
publication in a peer-reviewed journal, presentations at academic conferences, a 
community workshop and webinars with various stakeholders.

Real world settings are seldomly just composed of level surfaces and stairs are 
frequently encountered in daily life. Unfortunately, ~ 90% of the elderly 
population use some sort of compensation pattern in order to negotiate stairs. 
Because the biomechanics required to successfully ascend stairs is significantly 
different from level walking, an independent training protocol is warranted. 
Here, we present as a preliminary investigation with 11 able-bodied subjects, 
prior to clinical trials, whether Myosuit could potentially serve as a stair 
ascent training robot. Myosuit is a soft wearable exosuit that was designed to 
assist the user via hip and knee extension during the early stance phase. We 
hypothesized that clinical studies could be carried out if the lower limb 
kinematics, sensory feedback via plantar force, and electromyography (EMG) 
patterns do not deviate from the user's physiological stair ascent patterns 
while reducing hip and knee extensor demand. Our results suggest that Myosuit 
conserves the user's physiological kinematic and plantar force patterns. 
Moreover, we observe approximately 20% and 30% decrease in gluteus maximus and 
vastus medialis EMG levels in the pull up phase, respectively. Collectively, 
Myosuit reduces the hip and knee extensor demand during stair ascent without any 
introduction of significant compensation patterns.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence of the 
effect of isothermal changes in entropy on a living organism. In greater detail, 
the effect of the reduction of the total Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy (S) of the 
aquatic environment on the survival rate and body mass of the fruit fly 
Drosophila melanogaster was investigated. The tests were carried out in standard 
thermodynamic states at room temperature of 296.15 K and ambient atmospheric 
pressure of 1 bar. Two variants of entropy reduction (ΔS) were tested for 
ΔS = 28.49 and 51.14 J K-1 mol-1 compared to the blind and control samples. The 
entropy level was experimentally changed, using the quantum system for 
isothermal entropy reduction. This system is based on quantum bound entanglement 
of phonons and the phenomenon of phonon resonance (interference of phonon modes) 
in condensed matter (Silicon dioxide (SiO2) and single crystals of Silicon 
(Si0), Aluminum (Al0) plates ("chips"), glass, and water). All studied organisms 
were of the same age (1 day). Mortality was observed daily until the natural 
death of the organisms. The investigations showed that changes in the 
Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy affected the survival and body mass of the fruit flies. 
On the one hand, the reduction in entropy under isothermal conditions in the 
aquatic environment for ΔS = 28.49 J K-1 mol-1 resulted in an extension of the 
lifespan and an increase in the body mass of female fruit flies. On the other 
hand, the almost twofold reduction in this entropy for ΔS = 51.14 J K-1 mol-1 
shortened the lives of the males. Thus, the lifespan and body mass of flies 
turned out to be a specific reaction of metabolism related to changes in the 
entropy of the aquatic environment.

BACKGROUND: The worldwide society is currently facing an epidemiological shift 
due to the significant improvement in life expectancy and increase in the 
elderly population. This shift requires the public and scientific community to 
highlight successful aging (SA), as an indicator representing the quality of 
elderly people's health. SA is a subjective, complex, and multidimensional 
concept; thus, its meaning or measuring is a difficult task. This study seeks to 
identify the most affecting factors on SA and fed them as input variables for 
constructing predictive models using machine learning (ML) algorithms.
METHODS: Data from 1465 adults aged ≥ 60 years who were referred to health 
centers in Abadan city (Iran) between 2021 and 2022 were collected by interview. 
First, binary logistic regression (BLR) was used to identify the main factors 
influencing SA. Second, eight ML algorithms, including adaptive boosting 
(AdaBoost), bootstrap aggregating (Bagging), eXtreme Gradient Boosting 
(XG-Boost), random forest (RF), J-48, multilayered perceptron (MLP), Naïve Bayes 
(NB), and support vector machine (SVM), were trained to predict SA. Finally, 
their performance was evaluated using metrics derived from the confusion matrix 
to determine the best model.
RESULTS: The experimental results showed that 44 factors had a meaningful 
relationship with SA as the output class. In total, the RF algorithm with 
sensitivity = 0.95 ± 0.01, specificity = 0.94 ± 0.01, accuracy = 0.94 ± 0.005, 
and F-score = 0.94 ± 0.003 yielded the best performance for predicting SA.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other selected ML methods, the effectiveness of the 
RF as a bagging algorithm in predicting SA was significantly better. Our 
developed prediction models can provide, gerontologists, geriatric nursing, 
healthcare administrators, and policymakers with a reliable and responsive tool 
to improve elderly outcomes.

As life expectancy continues to increase in most EU Member States, smart 
technologies can help enable older people to continue living at home, despite 
the challenges accompanying the ageing process. The Innovation Action (IA) 
SHAPES 'Smart and Healthy Ageing through People Engaging in Supportive Systems' 
funded by the EU under the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (grant 
agreement number 857159) attends to these topics to support active and healthy 
ageing and the wellbeing of older adults. This protocol article outlines the 
SHAPES project's objectives and aims, methods, structure, and expected outcomes. 
SHAPES seeks to build, pilot, and deploy a large-scale, EU-standardised 
interoperable, and scalable open platform. The platform will facilitate the 
integration of a broad range of technological, organisational, clinical, 
educational, and social solutions. SHAPES emphasises that the home is much more 
than a house-space; it entails a sense of belonging, a place and a purpose in 
the community. SHAPES creates an ecosystem - a network of relevant users and 
stakeholders - who will work together to scale-up smart solutions. Furthermore, 
SHAPES will create a marketplace seeking to connect demand and supply across the 
home, health and care services. Finally, SHAPES will produce a set of 
recommendations to support key stakeholders seeking to integrate smart 
technologies in their care systems to mediate care delivery. Throughout, SHAPES 
adopts a multidisciplinary research approach to establish an empirical basis to 
guide the development of the platform. This includes long-term ethnographic 
research and a large-scale pan-European campaign to pilot the platform and its 
digital solutions within the context of seven distinct pilot themes. The project 
will thereby address the challenges of ageing societies in Europe and facilitate 
the integration of community-based health and social care. SHAPES will thus be a 
key driver for the transformation of healthcare and social care services across 
Europe.

Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are common 
conditions that can lead to significant morbidity and death. We aimed to 
understand the distribution and disparities of the global burden of AF/AFL as 
well as the underlying risk factors. Methods and Results Data on the AF/AFL 
burden from the Global Burden of Disease data set were analyzed for the years 
1990 to 2019, with countries grouped into low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and 
high national income classes according to World Bank categories. Data were 
supplemented with World Health Organization and World Bank information. The 
prevalence of AF/AFL has more than doubled (+120.7%) since 1990 in all income 
groups, though with a larger increment in middle-income countries (+146.6% in 
lower-middle- and +145.2% in upper-middle-income countries). In absolute 
numbers, 63.4% of AF/AFL cases originate from upper-middle-income countries, 
although the relative prevalence is highest in high-income countries. Prevalence 
of AF/AFL appears to be correlated with medical doctor rate and life expectancy. 
The most relevant AF/AFL risk factors are unevenly distributed among income 
classes, with elevated blood pressure as the only risk factor that becomes less 
common with increasing income. The development of these risk factors differed 
over time. Conclusions The global burden of AF/AFL is increasing in all income 
groups and is more pronounced in middle-income countries, with further growth to 
be expected. Underdiagnosis of AF/AFL in low- and middle-income countries may 
contribute to lower reported prevalence. The risk factor distribution varies 
between income groups.

Radiotherapy is a mainstay of glioblastoma (GBM) treatment; however, the 
development of therapeutic resistance has hampered the efficacy of radiotherapy, 
suggesting that additional treatment strategies are needed. Here, an in vivo 
loss-of-function genome-wide CRISPR screen was carried out in orthotopic tumors 
in mice subjected to radiation treatment to identify synthetic lethal genes 
associated with radiotherapy. Using functional screening and transcriptome 
analyses, glutathione synthetase (GSS) was found to be a potential regulator of 
radioresistance through ferroptosis. High GSS levels were closely related to 
poor prognosis and relapse in patients with glioma. Mechanistic studies 
demonstrated that GSS was associated with the suppression of 
radiotherapy-induced ferroptosis in glioma cells. The depletion of GSS resulted 
in the disruption of glutathione (GSH) synthesis, thereby causing the 
inactivation of GPX4 and iron accumulation, thus enhancing the induction of 
ferroptosis upon radiotherapy treatment. Moreover, to overcome the obstacles to 
broad therapeutic translation of CRISPR editing, we report a previously 
unidentified genome editing delivery system, in which Cas9 protein/sgRNA complex 
was loaded into Angiopep-2 (Ang) and the trans-activator of the transcription 
(TAT) peptide dual-modified extracellular vesicle (EV), which not only targeted 
the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and GBM but also permeated the BBB and penetrated 
the tumor. Our encapsulating EVs showed encouraging signs of GBM tissue 
targeting, which resulted in high GSS gene editing efficiency in GBM (up to 
67.2%) with negligible off-target gene editing. These results demonstrate that a 
combination of unbiased genetic screens, and CRISPR-Cas9-based gene therapy is 
feasible for identifying potential synthetic lethal genes and, by extension, 
therapeutic targets.

The challenging environmental chemical and microbial pollution has always caused 
issues for human life. This article investigates the detailed mechanism of 
photodegradation and antimicrobial activity of oxide semiconductors and realizes 
the interface phenomena of nanostructures with toxins and bacteria. We 
demonstrate how oxygen vacancies in nanostructures affect photodegradation and 
antimicrobial behavior. Additionally, a novel method with a simple, tunable, and 
cost-effective synthesis of nanostructures for such applications is introduced 
to resolve environmental issues. The high-voltage, high-current electrical 
switching discharge (HVHC-ESD) system is a novel method that allows on-the-spot 
sub-second synthesis of nanostructures on top and in the water for wastewater 
decontamination. Experiments are done on rhodamine B as a common dye in 
wastewater to understand its photocatalytic degradation mechanism. Moreover, the 
antimicrobial mechanism of oxide semiconductors synthesized by the HVHC-ESD 
method with oxygen vacancies is realized on methicillin- and 
vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. The results yield new 
insights into how oxygen ions in dyes and bacterial walls interact with the 
surface of ZnO with high oxygen vacancy, which results in breaking of the 
chemical structure of dyes and bacterial walls. This interaction leads to 
degradation of organic dyes and bacterial inactivation.

Nanoagrochemicals have the potential to revolutionize agriculture towards a 
precision farming system, able to reduce application rates and consequently 
their environmental footprint, while keeping efficacy. Several nanoagrochemicals 
(including nanopesticides (Npes) and nanofertilizers (Nfer)) are already 
commercialized but the environmental risk assessment of these advanced materials 
is often lacking. In the present study, we studied the commercial fertilizer 
WELGRO® Cu + Zn and assessed its ecotoxicity to the soil invertebrate species 
Enchytraeus crypticus (Oligochaeta), further comparing it to its individual 
active substances CuO and ZnO. To get a comprehensive picture of possible 
effects, we used four types of highly relevant tests in LUFA 2.2 soil: 1) 
avoidance behaviour (2 days), 2) reproduction (OECD standard, 28 d), 3) its 
extension (56 d), and 4) the full life cycle (FLC) (46 d) - this high level of 
hazard screening allows for increased interpretation. The results confirmed the 
nano-features of WELGRO® and a higher toxicity than the mixture of the 
individual components CuO + ZnO. E. crypticus avoided the soil spiked with 
WELGRO® and CuO + ZnO, this being the most sensitive endpoint - avoidance 
behaviour. Both WELGRO® and the active substances were little to non-toxic based 
on the OECD standard test. However, the toxicity dramatically increased in the 
tests focussing on longer-term sustainability measures, i.e., 56 days, ca. 170 
for WELGRO®. This seems related to the nano-features of WELGRO®, e.g., slow 
release of ions from the nanoparticles throughout time. The FLCt results showed 
WELGRO® affected hatching and juveniles' survival, being these the most 
sensitive life stages. Hence, under actual real world field usage scenarios, 
i.e., based on the recommended application rates, nanoenabled WELGRO® can affect 
oligochaete populations like enchytraeids, both via the immediate avoidance 
behaviour and also via prolonged exposure periods.

British Columbia, Canada.

PURPOSE: To review dental sleep medicine in older adults based on the 
literature.
STUDY SELECTION: This narrative review focuses on sleep physiology, common sleep 
disorders, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in older adults and their 
management.
RESULTS: Sleep physiology differs between older and younger adults, with sleep 
disturbances occurring more frequently in older adults. The prevalence of 
insomnia increases in older adults due to age-related changes in sleep 
physiology. Insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movement 
disorder, restless legs syndrome, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior 
disorder are common sleep disorders in older adults. OSA is more prevalent in 
older adults, and its effects on them are considered more substantial than those 
on younger adults. The treatment of older patients with mandibular advancement 
devices may be less effective and more complex owing to potential impairments in 
oral and dental health. Furthermore, the prevalence of edentulism in older 
adults is decreasing while life expectancy is increasing.
CONCLUSIONS: As older adults have comorbidities that affect sleep quality, 
dentists should consider the effects of sleep physiology and sleep disorders in 
these patients. OSA may decrease the quality of life and increase the risk of 
developing other diseases. Therefore, dentists proposing treatment with 
mandibular advancement devices need to inform patients of their potential lack 
of efficacy and the requirement for careful follow-up owing to known and unknown 
side effects.

BACKGROUND: Treatment advancements have improved life expectancy and nutritional 
status of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Alongside reductions in 
malnutrition, incidences of overweight, obesity and risk factors for 
diet-related chronic diseases have increased in recent years. This study aimed 
to synthesise the available literature on diet quality, macronutrient and 
micronutrient intakes compared to the recommended guidelines in adults with CF, 
an essential step in deducing the optimal dietary pattern and intakes for CF 
adults.
METHODS: A systematic search of five electronic databases from inception until 
April 2023 was conducted using keywords related to CF, diet quality and nutrient 
intakes.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included comprising 18 cross-sectional, one 
cohort and two case control studies, reporting data from 724 adults with CF. 
Energy and / or macronutrient intake data was reported across 17 cohorts, eight 
studies provided micronutrients data, and diet quality was determined for four 
CF cohorts by using a diet quality score, and / or categorising food intake into 
servings per day for food groups and comparing findings to national dietary 
guidelines. Although energy intake recommendations were met, and most 
micronutrient requirements were achieved through supplementation, total energy 
intake from fat was above recommendations and diet quality was poor.
CONCLUSION: This is the first systematic review comprehensively evaluating 
literature on dietary intakes of adults with CF. Energy-dense, nutrient-poor 
foods contribute to intakes which pose risk in developing diet-related chronic 
diseases. Revision of dietary guidelines and practice change in CF nutritional 
therapy is warranted to optimise nutrition and health outcomes.

AIMS: To estimate the health impacts of key modelled alcohol interventions among 
Māori (indigenous peoples) and non-Māori in New Zealand (NZ).
DESIGN: Multi-stage life-table intervention modelling study. We modelled two 
scenarios: (1) business-as-usual (BAU); and (2) an intervention package scenario 
that included a 50% alcohol tax increase, outlet density reduction from 63 to 
five outlets per 100 000 people, outlet hours reduction from 112 to 50 per week 
and a complete ban on all forms of alcohol marketing.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The model's population replicates the 2018 NZ 
population by ethnicity (Māori/non-Māori), age and sex.
