AIMS/INTRODUCTION: There is uncertainty about the direct medical costs of type 2 
diabetes patients with cancers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A population-based retrospective cohort of 99,915 type 2 
diabetes patients from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority between 2006 and 2017 
was assembled. A total of 16,869 patients who had an initial cancer diagnosis 
after type 2 diabetes diagnosis were matched with 83,046 patients without cancer 
(controls) using a matching ratio of up to one-to-five propensity score-matching 
method. Patients were divided into four categories according to life expectancy. 
Healthcare service utilization and direct medical costs during the index year, 
subsequent years and mortality year were compared between patients with and 
without cancer in each category.
RESULTS: Medical costs of cancer patients in the index year ranged from 
$US27,533 for patients who died in <1 year to $US11,303 for those survived 
>3 years. Cancer patients had significantly greater expenditures than controls 
in the index year (all P < 0.001) and subsequent years ($US4,569 vs $US4,155, 
P < 0.001). Cancer patients also had greater costs in the year of death, and the 
difference was significant for patients who survived >3 years after the index 
year ($US32,558 vs $US28,260). For patients in both groups, patients who 
survived >3 years had significantly lower costs than those who died in <1 year. 
Costs incurred in the mortality year were greater than those in the index year 
and subsequent years. Hospitalization accounted for >90% of the medical costs 
for both groups in the mortality year.
CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes patients with cancers incurred greater medical 
costs in the diagnosis, ensuing and mortality years than type 2 diabetes 
patients without cancers.

Nowadays, active packaging is becoming significant for the extension of the 
shelf life of food products via the incorporation of raw nanomaterials such as 
nanoclays and bioactive compounds such as essential oils (EO). This study aims 
to study the performance of the sodium montmorillonite (NaMt) and organically 
modified montmorillonite (OrgMt) as thyme (TO), oregano (OO), and basil (BO) 
essential oil (EO) control release nanocarriers in low-density poly-ethylene 
(LDPE) active films. NaMt and OrgMt nanofillers are modified with low (20 wt.%), 
medium (40 wt.%), and high (80 wt.%) nominal contents of TO, OO, and BO. The 
novel active packaging films were tested using the X-ray diffraction method 
(XRD), tensile, water, and oxygen barrier properties, and antioxidant activity 
tests. For the two most active packaging films, the lipid oxidation of chicken 
breast fillets estimated by the thiobarbituric-acid-reacting substances (TBARS) 
method. Overall study shows that both NaMtEO-based and OrgMt-based films 
exhibited controllable and sustained antioxidant activity. All films retained up 
to 50-70% of their antioxidant activity after six months of incubation. 
OrgMtEO-based LDPE films showed more significance applied as active packaging 
films than NaMtEO-based LDPE films because of their highest tensile and barrier 
properties.

BACKGROUND: Patients affected by hepatic cirrhosis show reductions in muscle 
mass and function, with poor quality of life and functional performance. As 
such, resistance training with blood flow restriction (BFR-RT) could be a useful 
therapeutic tool for health promotion. Thus, we aim to verify the effects of 
this intervention on muscle strength, muscle mass, fiber Pennation angle, 
fascicle length, functional performance, quality of life, and fall risk scores 
in this population.
METHODS: Thirty participants will be randomly distributed between 1) BFR-RT and 
2) control (CTRL). Assessments will occur at three time points: before the 
training intervention (0 W), after 12 weeks (12 W), and at follow-up (24 W). The 
following variables will be assessed: Child-Pugh classification; MELD score; 
SF-36 questionnaire; fatigue severity index; 6-min walk test; timed-up and go; 
30-s sitting and rising test; dietary record; one-repetition maximum (1-RM) 
strength test (knee extension exercise); and vastus lateralis' cross-sectional 
area, Pennation angle, and fascicle length. The BFR-RT group will undergo 
12 weeks of knee extension exercise (1 × 30 repetitions and 3 × 15 repetitions 
at 20% 1-RM and 50% of total blood flow occlusion pressure), with two sessions 
per week. Data normality will be assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. In case 
of normal distribution, a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance will be 
implemented to test for differences in baseline values. A mixed model then will 
be applied for each dependent variable. In case of non-normal data distribution, 
a Kruskal-Wallis test will be implemented to test for differences in baseline 
values. Next, the Friedman test will be used to analyze repeated measures. 
Within- and between-group effect sizes will be calculated using Cohen's d for 
each outcome. Finally, the minimal clinically important difference will be 
analyzed with distribution-based methods.
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this will be the first trial to investigate BFR-RT 
in patients with cirrhosis and evaluate the effects on neuromuscular parameters, 
functional performance, disease severity, and quality of life outcomes.

Chronic kidney disease patients have a high prevalence of severe valvular heart 
disease, which reduces life expectancy. Transcatheter valve interventions has 
revamped the way we manage severe valvular heart disease and are an attractive 
alternative to invasive surgery in patients with chronic kidney disease and 
severe valvular heart disease. This review summarizes the impact of 
transcatheter valve interventions in patients with severe valvular heart disease 
and chronic kidney disease.

Laminin-α2 related congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD) is a fatal muscle 
disease caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene. Laminin-α2 is critical for the 
formation of laminin-211 and -221 heterotrimers in the muscle basal lamina. 
LAMA2-CMD patients exhibit hypotonia from birth and progressive muscle loss that 
results in developmental delay, confinement to a wheelchair, respiratory 
insufficiency and premature death. There is currently no cure or effective 
treatment for LAMA2-CMD. Several studies have shown laminin-111 can serve as an 
effective protein-replacement therapy for LAMA2-CMD. Studies have demonstrated 
early treatment with laminin-111 protein results in an increase in life 
expectancy and improvements in muscle pathology and function. Since LAMA2-CMD 
patients are often diagnosed after advanced disease, it is unclear if 
laminin-111 protein therapy at an advanced stage of the disease can have 
beneficial outcomes. In this study, we tested the efficacy of laminin-111 
protein therapy after disease onset in a mouse model of LAMA2-CMD. Our results 
showed laminin-111 treatment after muscle disease onset increased life 
expectancy, promoted muscle growth and increased muscle stiffness. Together 
these studies indicate laminin-111 protein therapy either early or late in the 
disease process could serve as an effective protein replacement therapy for 
LAMA2-CMD.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early 
gastrointestinal (GI) cancers is widely performed as a standard treatment in 
Japan. Given the increasing life expectancy worldwide, it is naturally regarded 
that the rate of elderly patients diagnosed with early GI cancer has increased. 
Available guidelines do not specifically outline how to manage endoscopic 
therapy for the elderly. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and 
usefulness of ESD for superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SESCC) in 
elderly patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 393 consecutive patients, who underwent 
426 ESD for 444 SESCCs from January 2011 to August 2016 at our institution. For 
this study, patients were divided into 2 groups based on their age; ≥ 80 years 
(Group aged ≥ 80 years, n = 42) and < 80 years (group aged < 80 years, n = 351). 
Patient demographics, sedation methods, technical outcomes, adverse events, 
sedatives, dosages given, overall survival, and disease-specific survival were 
then examined.
RESULTS: The ESD procedure time was significantly longer for group 
aged ≥ 80 years than for group aged < 80 years (110 min [range 29-260] vs 85 min 
[24-504], p = 0.006); however, there was no significant differences between 
other technical items and adverse events. The 3-year overall survival and 
disease-specific survival were favorable in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal ESD for elderly patients aged ≥ 80 years can be safely 
performed. Mid-term outcome was favorable. Our study suggests that esophageal 
ESD might be a useful treatment for SESCCs.

PURPOSE: In breast cancer (BC), the duration of endocrine adjuvant therapies 
(AT) has been extended continuously up to 10 years. We present an alternative 
explanation for the effect, which could enable shorter treatments.
METHOD: The relevant literature on chemoprevention and (neo-)adjuvant therapy 
was reviewed. Data for initiation and growth of primary and contralateral BCs 
and their metastases (MET) were considered. Also, population-based data from the 
Munich Cancer Registry for MET-free survival, time trends of MET patterns, and 
survival achieved by improved ATs are used to estimate all events in the 
long-term follow-up.
RESULTS: Extended ATs (EAT) that continue after 1, 2, or 5 years reduce 
mortality only slightly. The effect is delayed, occurring more than 5 years 
after extension. EATs does not affect the prognosis of 1stBCs, they preventively 
eradicate contralateral 2ndBCs and thus their future life-threatening METs. 
Because chemoprevention can eradicate BCs from the smallest clusters to almost 
detectable BCs, ATs can be temporarily suspended without imposing harm. Results 
equal to EATs can be achieved by short-term ATs of the 1stBC and by repeated 
neo-ATs targeted at the indefinitely developing 2ndBCs. Considering this 
potential in de-escalation, a 70-80% reduction of overtreatment seems possible.
CONCLUSION: Knowledge of initiation and growth of tumors with known effects of 
neo-ATs suggest that intermittent endocrine ATs may achieve the same results as 
EATs but with improved quality of life and survival because of fewer side 
effects and better compliance. The challenge for developments of repeated ATs 
becomes: how short is short enough.

Age is a primary risk factor for multiple comorbidities including 
neurodegenerative diseases. Pet dogs and humans represent two populations that 
have experienced a significant increase in average life expectancy over the last 
century. A higher prevalence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases has been 
observed across both species, and human diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), have canine analogs, canine 
cognitive dysfunction (CCD), and degenerative myelopathy (DM) respectively. In 
humans, protein biomarkers have proved useful in the prediction and diagnosis of 
neurodegeneration. Molecular signatures of many proteins are highly conserved 
across species. In this study, we explored the potential of the neuronal 
cytoskeletal protein neurofilament light chain (NfL) as a biomarker of 
neuro-aging in dogs using an ultrasensitive single-molecule array assay to 
measure plasma concentrations. Healthy dogs of different ages and dogs affected 
with CCD and DM were evaluated. The mean plasma NfL concentrations in the 
different age groups of the healthy population were as follows: 
4.55 ± 1.70 pg/mL in puppy/junior group (0.43-2 years), 13.51 ± 6.8 pg/mL in 
adult/mature group (2.1-9 years), and 47.1 ± 12.68 pg/mL in geriatric/senior 
group (9.3-14.5 years). Concentrations in dogs with DM (7.5-12.6 years) and CCD 
(11.0-15.6 years) were 84.17 ± 53.57 pg/mL and 100.73 ± 83.72 pg/mL, 
respectively. Plasma NfL increases in an age-dependent manner and is 
significantly elevated in dogs diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease. This 
work identified plasma NfL as a key clinical index of neuro-aging and 
neurodegeneration in pet dogs. Our findings mirror recent reports from human 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: The Otago Exercise Program (OEP) has demonstrated cost-effectiveness 
for the primary prevention of falls in a general community setting. The 
cost-effectiveness of exercise as a secondary falls prevention (ie, preventing 
falls among those who have already fallen) strategy remains unknown. The primary 
objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness (incremental 
cost-effectiveness/utility ratio) of the OEP from a healthcare system 
perspective.
DESIGN: A concurrent 12-month prospective economic evaluation conducted 
alongside the Action Seniors! randomized critical trial (OEP compared with usual 
care).
SETTING: Vancouver Falls Prevention Clinic (Vancouver, BC, Canada; 
http://www.fallsclinic.ca).
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 344 community-dwelling older adults, aged 70 years and 
older, who attended a geriatrician-led Falls Prevention Clinic in Vancouver, 
after sustaining a fall in the previous 12 months.
MEASUREMENTS: Main outcome measures included: incidence rate ratio for falls, 
healthcare costs, incremental cost per fall prevented, and incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: The OEP costs $393 CAD per participant to implement. The incremental 
cost per fall prevented resulted in a savings of $2 CAD. The incremental cost 
per QALY gained (where QALYs were estimated using the Euro-Qol 5D three-level 
version [EQ-5D-3L]) indicated the OEP was less effective than usual care. The 
incremental cost per QALY gained (where QALYs were estimated using the Short 
Form 6D [SF-6D]) indicated the OEP was more effective and less costly than usual 
care. The incremental QALYs estimated using the EQ-5D-3L and the SF-6D were not 
clinically significant and close to zero, indicating no change in quality of 
life.
CONCLUSION: Compared with usual care, healthcare system costs are saved and 
falls are prevented when older fallers who attend a geriatrician-led falls 
clinic are allocated to, and provided, the physiotherapist-guided exercise-based 
falls prevention program (the OEP).

Paranasal sinuses (PNS) infections are common in children. They may cause common 
and well-known complications, but also, unusual and potentially devastating 
complications. Diagnosing PNS infections and complications in children requires 
knowledge of the unique anatomy of the nasal cavity and the PNS. In fetal life, 
nasal mucosa evaginations into the lateral nasal walls initiate the development 
of the PNS. The PNS continue to develop after birth and complete their 
maturation and pneumatization at different ages during childhood which makes the 
pattern of PNS infections determined by patient age. Complications are caused by 
direct spread of the infection to the orbit, face, intracranial or osseous 
structures or hematogenous spread of the infection to the intracranial 
structures. Emergent imaging studies are often necessary in the evaluation of 
the complications in pediatric patients when the symptoms persist for 10 days 
and/or if there is evidence of intracranial or orbital complications. In 
addition, immunocompromised children are especially vulnerable to developing 
unusual complications. Computed tomography (CT) is excellent for determining 
whether there is intraorbital extension of PNS disease. However, when the 
infection approaches the orbital apex, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study 
with contrast is necessary to assess spread into the cavernous sinus and the 
intracranial compartment. The goal of this manuscript is to review and 
characterize imaging findings of PNS infections using CT and MRI allowing 
determination of the extent of PNS infections and their common and unusual 
complications in children. In addition, a summary of the development of the 
normal PNS is provided.

BACKGROUND: Ileorectal anastomosis in patients with ulcerative colitis results 
in decreased postoperative morbidity and better functional outcome but leads to 
increased risk for rectal cancer compared with IPAA.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare ileorectal anastomosis with IPAA in 
ulcerative colitis by using a decision model.
DESIGN: A Markov simulation model was designed to simulate clinical events of 
ileorectal anastomosis and IPAA over a time horizon of 40 years with time cycles 
of 1 year. All probabilities and utilities were derived from observational 
studies, identified after a systematic literature search using MEDLINE. Primary 
outcomes were life-years and quality-adjusted life-years. Deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
SETTINGS: A decision model using Markov simulation was designed.
PATIENTS: The base case was a 35-year-old patient with ulcerative colitis and a 
relatively preserved rectum.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were (quality-adjusted) 
life-years.
RESULTS: The model resulted in lower life-years (36.22 vs 37.02) and higher 
quality-adjusted life-years (33.42 vs 31.57) for ileorectal anastomosis. This 
was confirmed after probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The model was sensitive 
to the utility of ileorectal anastomosis, IPAA, and end-ileostomy. A higher 
proportion of patients with ileorectal anastomosis will develop rectal cancer 
(7.6% vs 3.2%) and 43.5% of all patients with ileorectal anastomosis will end 
with an ileostomy as opposed to 23.0% of all patients with IPAA.
LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by characteristics inherent to modeling 
studies, including assumptions necessary to build the model, data input based on 
best available but often limited evidence, and unavoidable extra- and 
interpolation of data.
CONCLUSIONS: Ileorectal anastomosis was the preferred treatment option when 
quality-adjusted life-years were the outcome, with higher life-years for IPAA. 
This model highlights that both surgical strategies are useful in patients who 
have ulcerative colitis with a relatively spared rectum. See Video Abstract at

CON RESERVORIO ILEAL EN EL TRATAMIENTO QUIRÚRGICO DE LA COLITIS ULCEROSA: 
ANÁLISIS DE DECISIÓN DE MARKOV: Las anastomosis ileorrectales en pacientes con 
colitis ulcerosa se encuentran asociadas con la disminución de la morbilidad 
postoperatoria y un mejor resultado funcional, pero conducen a un mayor riesgo 
de cáncer de recto cuando se las compara con casos de confección de un 
reservorio íleo-anal.Comparar las anastomosis ileorrectales con la anastomosis 
de un reservorio íleo-anal en casos de colitis ulcerosa, utilizando un modelo de 
procesos de decisión.Se diseñó un modelo de proceso de Markov para simular 
eventos clínicos en casos de anastomosis ileorrectales y anastomosis de 
reservorios íleo-anales en un horizonte temporal de 40 años comprendiendo ciclos 
temporales de 1 año. Todas las probabilidades y utilidades se derivaron de 
estudios observacionales, identificados después de una búsqueda sistemática de 
literatura usando MEDLINE. Los resultados primarios fueron años de vida y los 
años ajustados a la calidad de vida. Se realizaron los análisis de sensibilidad 
determinada y de probabilística.Se diseñó un modelo de decisión utilizando el 
proceso de simulación de Markov.El caso base fue el de un paciente de 35 años 
con colitis ulcerosa y con un recto relativamente sano.El resultado principal 
fué la medida de los años de vida (con ajuste en la calidad de vida).El modelo 
resultó en menos años de vida (36.22 frente a 37.02) y años de vida de menor 
calidad (33.42 frente a 31.57) para los casos de anastomosis ileorrectales. Esto 
se confirmó después del análisis de sensibilidad probabilística. El modelo era 
sensible a la utilidad de la anastomosis ileorrectal, la anastomosis del 
reservorio íleo-anal y la ileostomía terminal. Una mayor proporción de pacientes 
con anastomosis ileorectales desarrollarán cáncer de recto (7,6% frente a 3,2%) 
y el 43,5% de todos los pacientes con anastomosis ileorrectales terminarán con 
una ileostomía en comparación con el 23,0% de todos los pacientes con un 
reservorio íleo-anal.El analisis estuvo limitado por las características 
inherentes a los estudios de modelado, incluidas las suposiciones necesarias 
para construir el modelo, la entrada de datos basada en la mejor evidencia 
disponible pero a menudo limitada y la extrapolación e interpolación inevitable 
de datos.Las anastomosis ileorrectales fueron la opción de tratamiento preferida 
cuando el resultado fue ajustado en años con calidad de vida, con años de vida 
más larga para la anastomosis de reservorios íleo-anales. Este modelo destaca 
que ambas estrategias quirúrgicas son útiles en pacientes con colitis ulcerosa 
con rectos relativamente sanos. Consulte Video Resumen en

OBJECTIVE: Immediate-access arteriovenous grafts (IAAVGs), or early cannulation 
arteriovenous grafts (AVGs), are more expensive than standard grafts (sAVGs) but 
can be used immediately after placement, reducing the need for a tunneled 
dialysis catheter (TDC). We hypothesized that a decrease in TDC-related 
complications would make IAAVGs a cost-effective alternative to sAVGs.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model in which patients 
initially received either an IAAVG or an sAVG and a TDC until graft usability; 
patients were followed through multiple subsequent access procedures for a 
60-month time horizon. The model simulated mortality and typical graft- and 
TDC-related complications, with parameter estimates including probabilities, 
costs, and utilities derived from previous literature. A key parameter was 
median time to TDC removal after graft placement, which was studied under both 
real-world (7 days for IAAVG and 70 days for sAVG) and ideal (no TDC placed with 
IAAVG and 1 month for sAVG) conditions. Costs were based on current Medicare 
reimbursement rates and reflect a payer perspective. Both microsimulation 
(10,000 trials) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (10,000 samples) were 
performed. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: IAAVG placement is a dominant strategy under both real-world ($1201.16 
less expensive and 0.03 QALY more effective) and ideal ($1457.97 less expensive 
and 0.03 QALY more effective) conditions. Under real-world parameters, the 
result was most sensitive to the time to TDC removal; IAAVGs are cost-effective 
if a TDC is maintained for ≥23 days after sAVG placement. The mean catheter time 
was lower with IAAVG (3.9 vs 8.7 months; P < .0001), as was the mean number of 
access-related infections (0.55 vs 0.74; P < .0001). Median survival in the 
model was 29 months. Overall mortality was similar between groups (76.3% vs 
76.7% at 5 years; P = .33), but access-related mortality trended toward 
improvement with IAAVG (6.1% vs 6.8% at 5 years; P = .052).
CONCLUSIONS: The Markov decision analysis model supported our hypothesis that 
IAAVGs come with added initial cost but are ultimately cost-saving and more 
effective. This apparent benefit is due to our prediction that a decreased 
number of catheter days per patient would lead to a decreased number of 
access-related infections.

Technology, Nathalal Parekh, Marg, Matunga - 400 019, Mumbai, Maharashtra, 
India.

BACKGROUND: According to the American Cancer Society, prostate cancer ranks 
second in terms of mortality and is a front-runner of newly detected cases. 
Conventional therapies neither eradicated cancer nor increased the life 
expectancy of patients obviating the need for less toxic as well as efficient 
therapies to treat cancer. Gene therapy alone, or in combination with 
conventional therapies, possesses a strong potential to combat cancer.
METHODS: This review encompasses a brief note on the etiology and conventional 
therapy of prostate cancer with an emphasis on gene therapy and its suitability 
for the treatment of prostate cancer.
RESULTS: A comprehensive range of gene therapy approaches have been successfully 
explored for prostate cancer treatment in animal models and this has been well 
translated into early clinical trials. We have also discussed in brief about 
specific therapeutic genes and suitable vector systems for gene therapy in 
prostate cancer.
CONCLUSION: Based on the results of these clinical trials, the application of 
gene therapy in prostate cancer therapeutics can be satisfactorily established.

Cementation of a Dual Mobility Cup Into an Existing Well-Fixed Metal Shell: A 
Reliable Option to Manage Wear-Related Recurrent Dislocation in Patients With 
High Surgical Risk.

Lausanne, Switzerland.

BACKGROUND: During revision total hip arthroplasty (THA), the "double-socket" 
technique has been proposed as a straightforward solution in order to reduce the 
overall perioperative morbidity in patients with high surgical risk. However, 
the option of cementing a dual mobility cup into an existing well-fixed metal 
shell was sparsely reported. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the outcome 
of a "double-socket" technique performed with a cemented dual mobility cup in 
revision THA for late instability.
METHODS: Twenty-eight revision THAs (28 patients) were performed for 
wear-related recurrent dislocation using a "double-socket" technique with a 
cemented dual mobility cup and retrospectively reviewed. The age at revision 
averaged 82 years (range 74-93). According to the American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification, 12 patients (43%) were 
ASA II and 16 patients (57%) were ASA III before revision.
RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 3.5 years (range 2-5), the mean preoperative to 
postoperative functional outcome improved significantly (P < .01). The mean 
operative time was 107 minutes (range 75-140). The mean intraoperative bleeding 
was 200 mL (range 110-420). No postoperative complication, reoperation, or 
re-revision was reported. Importantly, no dislocation, dissociation of the 
cemented dual mobility cup construct, or aseptic loosening of the retained metal 
shell was observed.
CONCLUSION: The "double-socket" technique with a dual mobility cup cemented into 
an existing well-fixed and well-positioned metal shell ensured a straightforward 
and blood-sparing revision technique that was efficient to restore stability and 
provide a secure acetabular construct in frail patients with high surgical risk 
and/or older than their natural life expectancy.

Coronary artery occlusion is an uncommon but life-threatening complication of 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Both low coronary artery height 
and externally mounted stented bioprosthesis present an increased risk for 
coronary artery occlusion, and various prevention strategies have been 
recommended. We present an 86-year-old woman with failed surgical bioprosthesis, 
concomitant obstructive ostial right coronary artery (RCA) lesion, and low 
coronary ostial heights who underwent simultaneous TAVR and percutaneous 
coronary intervention of ostial RCA. Due to suprannular valve expansion after 
post-dilation, the RCA ostium was compromised, and a novel stent tunnel was 
created under the native leaflets towards the left coronary sinus to maintain 
RCA perfusion.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this video is to demonstrate different clinical 
presentations of peritoneal defects (peritoneal retraction pockets) and their 
anatomic relationships with the pelvic innervation, justifying the occurrence of 
some neurologic symptoms in association with these diseases.
DESIGN: Surgical demonstration of complete excision of different types of 
peritoneal retraction pockets and a comparison with a laparoscopic 
retroperitoneal cadaveric dissection of the pelvic innervation.
SETTING: Private hospital in Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil.
INTERVENTIONS: A pelvic peritoneal pocket is a retraction defect in the surface 
of the peritoneum of variable size and shapes [1]. The origin of defects in the 
pelvic peritoneum is still unknown [2]. It has been postulated that it is the 
result of peritoneal irritation or invasion by endometriosis, with resultant 
scarring and retraction of the peritoneum [3,4]. It has also been suggested that 
a retraction pocket may be a cause of endometriosis, where the disease 
presumably settles in a previously altered peritoneal surface [5]. These defects 
are shown in many studies to be associated with pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and 
secondary dysmenorrhea [1-4]. Some studies have shown that the excision of these 
peritoneal defect improves pain symptoms and quality of life [5]. It is 
important to recognize peritoneal pockets as a potential manifestation of 
endometriosis because in some cases, the only evidence of endometriosis may be 
the presence of these peritoneal defects [6]. In this video, we demonstrate 
different types of peritoneal pockets and their close relationship with pelvic 
anatomic structures. Case 1 is a 29-year-old woman, gravida 0, with severe 
dysmenorrhea and catamenial bowel symptoms (bowel distension and 
diarrhea/constipation) that were unresponsive to medical treatment. Imaging 
studies were reported as normal, and a laparoscopy showed a posterior cul-de-sac 
peritoneal pocket infiltrating the pararectal fossa, with extension to the 
lateral border of the rectum. Case 2 is a cadaveric dissection of a posterior 
cul-de-sac peritoneal pocket infiltrating the pararectal fossa, with extension 
to the pelvic sidewall. After dissection of the obturator fossa, we can observe 
that the pocket is close to the sacrospinous ligament, pudendal nerve, and some 
sacral roots. Case 3 is a 31-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, with severe 
dysmenorrhea that was unresponsive to medical treatment and catamenial bowel 
symptoms (catamenial bowel distention and diarrhea). Imaging studies were 
reported as normal and a laparoscopy showed left uterosacral peritoneal pocket 
infiltrating the pararectal fossa in close proximity to the rectal wall. Case 4 
is a cadaveric dissection of the ovarian fossa and the obturator fossa showing 
the proximity between these structures. Case 5 is a 35-year-old woman, gravida 
0, with severe dysmenorrhea that was unresponsive to medical treatment, 
referring difficulty, and pain when walking only during menstruation. A 
neurologic physical examination revealed weakness in thigh adduction, and the 
magnetic resonance imaging showed no signs of endometriosis. During laparoscopy, 
we found a peritoneal pocket infiltrating the ovarian fossa, with involvement in 
the area between the umbilical ligament and the uterine artery. This type of 
pocket can easily reach the obturator nerve. Because the obturator nerve and its 
branches supply the muscle and skin of the medial thigh [7,8], patients may 
present with thigh adduction weakness or difficulty ambulating [9,10]. Case 6 is 
a cadaveric dissection of the sacrospinous ligament and the pudendal nerve from 
a medial approach, between the umbilical artery and the iliac vessels. Case 7 is 
a 34-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 1, with severe dysmenorrhea and catamenial 
bowel symptoms as well as deep dyspareunia. The transvaginal ultrasound showed 
focal adenomyosis and a 2-cm nodule, 9-cm apart from the anal verge, affecting 
30% of the bowel circumference. In the laparoscopy, we found a posterior 
cul-de-sac retraction pocket associated with a large deep endometriosis nodule 
affecting the vagina and the rectum. In all cases, endometriosis was confirmed 
by histopathology, and in a 6-month follow-up, all patients showed improvement 
of bowel, pain, and neurologic symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Peritoneal pockets can have different clinical presentations. 
Depending on the topography and deepness of infiltration, they can be the cause 
of some neurologic symptoms associated with endometriosis pain. With this video, 
we try to encourage surgeons to totally excise these lesions and raise awareness 
about the adjacent key anatomic structures that can be affected.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing a domestic 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7-TT) into the Cuban National Immunization 
Program (NIP).
METHODS: We compared PCV7-TT given at two, four and six months of age to a 
scenario without PCV7-TT, over a ten-year period (2020-2029). We calculated the 
cost (Cuban pesos - CUP) per Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted from a 
Government perspective. We compared results from a static cohort model and a 
parsimonious prediction model informed by the serotype distribution among 
pneumococcal carriers and cases. We ran probabilistic and deterministic 
uncertainty analyses.
RESULTS: PCV7-TT could prevent 6897 (95% uncertainty interval, 4344-8750) 
hospitalizations and 189 (115-253) deaths in children <5 years of age, over the 
period 2020-2029. This could cost around 25 million (20-31) discounted CUP but 
would be offset by treatment cost savings of around 23 million (14-31). A 
parsimonious model predicted less favourable impact and cost-effectiveness but 
the cost per DALY averted was still less than 0.4 times the current GDP per 
capita.
CONCLUSIONS: PCV7-TT is likely to be cost-effective in Cuba. The impact of the 
vaccine would need to be carefully monitored following its introduction into the 
NIP.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential epidemiological impact and 
cost-effectiveness of shorter antibiotic regimens in high tuberculosis (TB) 
burden regions of Taiwan.
METHODS: This study combined the TB population dynamic model and 
cost-effectiveness analysis with local data to simulate the disease burdens, 
effectiveness and costs of hypothetical 4-month, 2-month and 7-day regimens 
compared with the standard regimen.
RESULTS: The main outcomes were the potential of shorter regimens for averted 
incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life years, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio and net monetary benefit. Shorter regimens would lower 
incidence rates and mortality cases in a high TB burden region by an average of 
19-33% and 27-41%, respectively, with the potential for cost-effectiveness or 
cost-saving. The 2-month and 7-day regimens would be more cost-effective than 
the 4-month regimen. The threshold daily drug prices for achieving 
cost-effectiveness and cost-saving for 4-month, 2-month and 7-day regimens were 
$US1, $US2 and $US70, respectively. Such cost-effectiveness would remain, even 
if the willingness-to-pay threshold was less than one gross domestic product per 
capita.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the inclusion of shorter regimens in global 
guidelines and regional-scale TB control strategies, which would improve disease 
control, particularly in settings with high rates of incidence and poor 
treatment outcomes.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: In 2016, Médecins Sans Frontières established the first 
general population Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and treatment site in 
Cambodia, offering free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment. This study 
analysed the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.
METHODS: Costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness of 
the intervention were projected with a Markov model over a lifetime horizon, 
discounted at 3%/year. Patient-level resource-use and outcome data, treatment 
costs, costs of HCV-related healthcare and EQ-5D-5L health states were collected 
from an observational cohort study evaluating the effectiveness of DAA treatment 
under full and simplified models of care compared to no treatment; other model 
parameters were derived from literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
