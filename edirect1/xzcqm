BACKGROUND: Availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV 
has prolonged life expectancy of patients but has also increased the incidence 
of non-AIDS comorbid conditions. Among these, there are cardiovascular diseases, 
and aortic involvement has been described in patients with HIV in the form of 
aortitis, aneurysms, or dissections. Our study aims to describe aortic pathology 
occurring in patients with HIV, focusing on clinical and surgical presentation, 
management, and outcome, through a review of cases published in literature.
METHODS: MEDLINE (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) database was reviewed for 
"aortitis" OR "aortic aneurysm" OR "aortic dissection" AND HIV. Research was 
restricted to English language. Only case reports were included. Data on 
patients' age, sex, traditional risk factors, timing from HIV diagnosis, 
pharmacological details, coinfection (syphilis, hepatitis C virus [HCV], and 
hepatitis B virus [HBV]), anatomical localization of lesion, presence of 
inflammatory involvement, rapid growing or rupture, and surgical treatment and 
outcomes were collected and summarized in tables.
RESULTS: Forty articles (51 cases) were included in the study. The mean age of 
patients was 48.8 ± 8.3 years. Male sex was preponderant (43 cases, 84.3%). 
Among traditional risk factors, hypertension and smoking were the most 
frequently reported ones (14 and 13 cases, respectively), followed by 
vasculopathy involving other arterial districts, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and 
drug addiction. In 3 cases, HIV was diagnosed in the same time as aortic 
pathology, whereas in most cases, aortic event occurred after five years from 
HIV diagnosis. In 30.5% of cases for which data on pharmacologic management were 
available, no treatment or poor adherence was reported. Coinfection occurred in 
some cases (syphilis in 6, HCV in 5, and HBV in 3). As for anatomical 
involvement, isolated thoracic lesions were more frequent (24, 47.1%), followed 
by abdominal and thoracoabdominal lesions. The etiology ranged from bacterial 
mycotic aneurysms to tertiary syphilis, postsurgical complications, or 
atherosclerosis. In 3 cases, HIV vasculitis was directly suggested, and in 
another 2, no other potential etiology had been diagnosed through cultural 
tests. Open surgical treatment was carried out in 30 cases (58.8%), and in 
addition, 10 endovascular (19.6%) and 2 hybrid procedures were described. 
Inflammatory features occurred in 7 cases, and a rapid evolution of lesions in 
6. In 9 cases (17.6%), rupture occurred. Mortality was reported in 8 cases 
(15.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic pathology may occur in patients with HIV. The entanglement 
of different patterns of pathological involvement of the aortic wall, secondary 
to immune dysregulation, infectious process, or atherosclerotic damage that may 
co-occur in one single case, results in a very challenging management of the 
condition. Because of the increased life expectancy of patients and immigration 
from regions with both high HIV and coinfection prevalence, the incidence of 
aortic pathology could increase in the upcoming years, suggesting the urgent 
need for further studies to optimize management in these very complex cases.

Intracellular pathogens such as HIV, hepatitis B virus, and Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis are responsible for millions of deaths worldwide and represent 
major obstacles to global health. Current treatment options have improved 
patient outcomes and extended life-expectancy in many countries; however, 
challenges such as latency, drug-resistance, and inflammatory pathology have 
necessitated advancements in curative strategies which go beyond the traditional 
antimicrobial focus. This review highlights recent advances in host-directed 
therapies to eradicate intracellular pathogens or augment the endogenous immune 
response by targeting host cell pathways. The 'kick and kill' strategy for HIV 
latency, adjunct immunomodulatory compounds for tuberculosis, and pro-apoptotic 
small-molecule inhibitors in the case of chronic Hepatitis B are promising 
examples of host-directed therapies that signal a paradigm shift in treatment 
and management of chronic infectious disease.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that palliative radiation therapy (PRT) 
is often underused, especially in rural and remote settings despite evidence 
supporting its effectiveness in managing symptoms from advanced or metastatic 
cancer.
PURPOSE: To identify factors which influence family physicians (FPs) in British 
Columbia (BC) to refer patients for PRT at the BC Cancer Agency (BCCA) and to 
compare referral patterns between FPs in rural and urban areas.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 1,001 questionnaires were sent to all FPs 
practicing in rural areas and randomly to FPs in urban areas (351 and 650, 
respectively). Rural and urban areas were chosen based on our previous study of 
utilization rates of PRT in BC. The questionnaire was adapted from a previously 
validated survey, and was used to obtain information on referral practices of 
FPs in BC. FPs who did not practice family medicine or where 80% of their 
practice was spent with either obstetrical or pediatric patients were excluded.
RESULTS: The overall response rate was 33% (44% rural vs. 28% urban). Rural FPs 
were more involved in both palliative care and metastatic cancer management of 
their patients (88% vs. 74%; P = .01 and 58% vs. 39%; P = .01). No difference 
was observed in the FPs' awareness of the BCCA's Radiation Oncology Program. The 
most significant factors influencing an FP to refer a patient for PRT were: poor 
functional status, inconvenience to travel and life expectancy. A higher 
proportion of rural FPs had 10 years or less of experience in family practice 
than the urban FPs (P = .03). There was no significant difference in the formal 
training or additional training between the rural and urban FPs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that FPs practicing in rural areas were more 
involved in palliative management of their patients and participated more in the 
care of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer than those in urban areas. 
They also more commonly referred patients for palliative radiotherapy than their 
urban counterparts. The reported factors that influenced rural and urban FPs to 
refer were patients' functional status and life expectancy, combined with 
uncertain benefit and potential side effects of radiotherapy. More than twice as 
many FPs from rural compared to urban areas were influenced by perceived 
inconvenience to travel for palliative radiotherapy. After controlling for 
potential confounding factors, FP awareness of the radiotherapy program, high 
participation in advanced, metastatic, or palliative care of cancer patients, 
formal training in radiation oncology, and additional training in palliative 
care were all associated with an increased probability of ever referring for 
palliative radiotherapy.

The aim of the study was an analysis of years of life lost due to cervical 
cancer in Poland in the period 2000 to 2015 with consideration given to 
differences related to education and place of residence. The study material was 
28,274 death certificates of all female inhabitants of Poland, who died in 2000 
to 2015 due to cervical cancer. In order to calculate years of life lost, the 
authors used indices: SEYLLp (Standard Expected Years of Life Lost per living 
person), SEYLLd (per deaths) and AAPC (Average Annual Percentage Change). The 
SEYLLp index (per 100,000) due to cervical cancer in Poland decreased from 394.3 
in 2000 to 220.9 years of life in 2015 (AAPC = -3.6%). Women with university 
education lost the smallest number of years of life (SEYLLp = 139.0 in 2000 and 
53.7 in 2015; AAPC = -5.4%), whereas those with elementary education had the 
greatest number of years of life lost (524.2 and 312.8; AAPC = -3.4%). Women 
living in rural areas lost on average 329.5 years in 2000 and 177.0 in 2015 
(AAPC = -3.8%). In city areas, the values were 428.6 and 247.1 (AAPC = -3.4%). 
Many of the years of life lost could have been avoided by including more women, 
particularly those with elementary education, in screening examinations.

In the last few years, there has been growing interest in the relationship 
between cancer and cardiovascular disease. The increase in life expectancy in 
both diseases has led to their frequent coexistence in the same patient, which 
can lead to adverse drug reactions that increase patient risk. This is 
especially relevant in the case of atherosclerosis, which seems to share a 
common pathophysiological substrate with cancer. In this review, we analyze 
these common risk factors, and specifically analyze the relationship between 
different cancer treatments with the risk of coronary or cerebrovascular 
disease, as well as the current scientific evidence on the possible relationship 
between antiplatelet therapy and cancer risk. We also review the incidence and 
prognosis of cancer in patients with atherosclerosis and vice versa, based on 
the information reported in the most recently published studies in the field of 
cardio-oncology.

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a very aggressive disease, lacking 
effective therapeutic approaches and leaving PDAC patients with a poor 
prognosis. The life expectancy of PDAC patients has not experienced a 
significant change in the last few decades with a five-year survival rate of 
only 8%. To address this unmet need, novel pharmacological targets must be 
identified for clinical intervention. ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters 
are frequently overexpressed in different cancer types and represent one of the 
major mechanisms responsible for chemoresistance. However, a more direct role 
for ABC transporters in tumorigenesis has not been widely investigated. Here, we 
show that ABCC3 (ABC Subfamily C Member 3; previously known as MRP3) is 
overexpressed in PDAC cell lines and also in clinical samples. We demonstrate 
that ABCC3 expression is regulated by mutant p53 via miR-34 and that the 
transporter drives PDAC progression via transport of the bioactive lipid 
lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). Disruption of ABCC3 function either by genetic 
knockdown reduces pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. 
Mechanistically, we demonstrate that knockdown of ABCC3 reduce cell 
proliferation by inhibition of STAT3 and HIF1α signalling pathways, previously 
been shown to be key regulators of PDAC progression. Collectively, our results 
identify ABCC3 as a novel and promising target in PDAC therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of neuromuscular ultrasound (NMUS) 
for the evaluation of focal neuropathies.
METHODS: A prior prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled trial 
demonstrated that NMUS, when added to electrodiagnostic testing, resulted in 
improved clinical outcomes after 6 months of follow-up. From this study, we 
abstracted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from the 36-item Short Form 
Health Survey and entered this health-utility estimate into a mixed trial and 
model-based cost-effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective. Costs of 
intervention (NMUS) were estimated from Medicare payment rates for Current 
Procedural Terminology codes. Health care use was otherwise estimated to be 
equal, but sensitivity analyses further examined this and other key assumptions. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used as the primary outcome with 
a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY.
RESULTS: The predicted mean health outcome associated with use of NMUS was 0.079 
QALY, and the mean cost was $37, resulting in an ICER of $463 per QALY. Results 
and conclusions remained robust across all sensitivity analyses, including 
variations in time horizon, initial distribution of health states, costs, and 
effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: From a societal perspective, the addition of NMUS to 
electrodiagnostic testing when evaluating a focal neuropathy is cost-effective. 
A study of longer follow-up incorporating total health care use would further 
quantify the value of NMUS.

Inter-symbol and co-channel interferences restrict the capacity of molecular 
communication (MC) systems. In this study, the effect of these interferences on 
the data rate of MC systems is investigated to design an efficient MC system. To 
this end, the authors propose an analytical model for a diffusion-based MC 
system comprised of two nanomachines when they exploit On/Off keying modulation. 
They model the Brownian motion of molecules in a one-dimensional environment as 
a wiener process and the life expectancy of diffused molecules as an exponential 
process. First, they consider the inter-symbol interference to derive the data 
rate of the MC system as a function of the receiver decision threshold and the 
symbol time duration. Hence, they propose an algorithm to obtain the optimal 
values of MC system parameters. Then, the effect of co-channel interference is 
considered by assuming parallel MC systems. They propose a minimum distance 
between adjacent MC systems that their co-channel interferences effect to be 
negligible. Moreover, they verify the accuracy of the analytical results by 
Monte-Carlo simulations. Results show a remarkable improvement in the data rate 
of MC systems. The derived results may find application in nanonetworks where 
nanomachines connect together to perform complex tasks.

This report describes the rationale and design of a study assessing tolvaptan in 
children with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Phase A is a 
1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Phase B 
is a 2-year, open-label extension. The target population is at least 60 children 
aged 12-17 years, diagnosed by family history and/or genetic criteria and the 
presence of ≥ 10 renal cysts, each ≥ 0.5 cm on magnetic resonance imaging. 
Subjects will be allocated into 4 groups: females 15-17 years; females 
12-14 years; males 15-17 years; and males 12-14 years. Up to 40 subjects aged 
4-11 years may also enroll, provided they meet the entry criteria. 
Weight-adjusted tolvaptan doses, titrated once to achieve a tolerated 
maintenance dose, and matching placebo will be administered twice-daily. 
Assessments include spot urine osmolality and specific gravity (co-primary 
endpoints), height-adjusted total kidney volume, estimated glomerular filtration 
rate, pharmacodynamic parameters (urine volume, fluid intake and fluid balance, 
serum sodium, serum creatinine, free water clearance), pharmacokinetic 
parameters, safety (aquaretic adverse events, changes from baseline in 
creatinine, vital signs, laboratory values including liver function tests), and 
generic pediatric quality of life assessments.Conclusion: This will be the first 
clinical study to evaluate tolvaptan in pediatric ADPKD. What is Known: • 
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disorder 
causing the development of cysts that impede kidney function over time and 
eventually induce renal failure • There are few data on the effects of 
tolvaptan, the only treatment approved for adults to slow disease progression, 
in pediatric ADPKD patients with early-stage disease What is New: • A phase 3, 
placebo-controlled study is evaluating tolvaptan over 3 years in children and 
adolescents with ADPKD • This study is designed to account for challenges of 
tolvaptan dosing and outcome assessment specific to the pediatric population.

Longevity of a species is a multifactorial quantitative trait influenced by 
genetic background, sex, age and environment of the organism. Extended longevity 
phenotypes (ELP) from experimental evolution in the laboratory can be used as 
model systems to investigate the mechanisms underlying aging and senescence. 
ELPs of Drosophila are correlated with various life history attributes such as 
resistance to environmental stressors (starvation, desiccation, cold and 
paraquat), developmental time, biochemical defenses, etc. The association 
between oxidative stress resistance and longevity is not clear and ELPs offer an 
opportunity to examine the role of oxidative stress resistance in longevity. 
Here, we have investigated the hypothesis that enhanced oxidative stress 
resistance and elevated antioxidant defense system play a positive role in 
longevity using an ELP of Drosophila melanogaster. An ELP of D. melanogaster 
isolated and characterized in our laboratory through artificial selection 
(inbred laboratory strain of Oregon K) is employed in this study. Our ELP, named 
as long lifespan (LLS) flies, shows marked extension in lifespan when compared 
to the progenitor population (normal lifespan, NLS) and makes a suitable model 
to study the role of mitochondrial genome in longevity because of its least 
heterogeneity. In this study, sensitivity to ethanol with age was employed as a 
measure of resistance to oxidative stress in NLS and LLS flies. Effect of age 
and oxidative stress on longevity was examined by employing NLS and LLS flies of 
different age groups against ethanol-induced oxidative stress. Results show that 
the lower mortality against ethanol was associated with enhanced oxidative 
stress resistance, higher antioxidant defenses, lower reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) levels, enhanced alcohol dehydrogenase activity and better locomotor 
ability attributes of LLS flies. In addition, age-related changes like locomotor 
impairments, decreased antioxidant defenses, higher ROS levels and sensitivity 
to oxidative stress were delayed in LLS flies when compared to NLS. Our study 
supports the hypothesis that higher oxidative stress resistance and enhanced 
antioxidant defenses are significant factors in extending longevity.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the experiences and communication preferences of adult 
patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) in the domains of employment, 
insurance, and family planning.
DESIGN: Patients ≥ 18 years of age completed a questionnaire about experiences 
and communication preferences regarding employment, health insurance, and family 
planning.
RESULTS: Of 152 patients (median age = 33 years, 50% female, 35% with CHD of 
great complexity), one in four reported work-related problems due to CHD and a 
quarter also recalled a previous gap in health insurance. Of females, 29% 
experienced an unplanned pregnancy. The median importance of discussion ratings 
(on a 0-10 scale) were 3.5 (employment), 6.0 (insurance), and 8.0 (family 
planning). Few patients recalled discussions about employment (19%) or health 
insurance (20%). Over half recalled discussions about family planning, although 
males were less likely to have had these discussions than females (24% vs 86%, 
P < .001). Across the three domains, patients identified 16-18 years as the most 
appropriate age to initiate discussion, although for patients who recalled 
discussions, they typically occurred between 20 and 25 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Adults with CHD commonly face employment, health insurance, and 
family planning challenges. However, discussions about these matters occur with 
less frequency than recommended and at older ages than patients would prefer. 
Communication about such issues should be incorporated into a comprehensive 
educational curriculum for adolescents during the process of transition to adult 
care.

There are a broad range of survival-based metrics that are available to report 
from cancer survival studies, with varying advantages and disadvantages. A 
combination of metrics should be considered to improve comprehensibility and 
give a fuller understanding of the impact of cancer. In this article, we discuss 
the utility of loss in life expectancy and gain in life years as measures of 
cancer impact, and to quantify differences across population groups. These 
measures are simple to interpret, have a real-world meaning, and evaluate impact 
over a life-time horizon. We illustrate the use of the loss in life expectancy 
measures through a range of examples using data on women diagnosed with cancer 
in England. We use four different examples across a number of tumour types to 
illustrate different uses of the metrics, and highlight how they can be 
interpreted and used in practice in population-based oncology studies. 
Extensions of the measures conditional on survival to specific times after 
diagnosis can be used to give updated prognosis for cancer patients. 
Furthermore, we show how the measures can be used to understand the impact of 
population differences seen across patient groups. We believe that these 
under-used, and relatively easy to calculate, measures of overall impact can 
supplement reporting of cancer survival metrics and improve the 
comprehensibility compared to the metrics typically reported.

BACKGROUND: Somatic diseases, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and cancer 
diseases, are the main contributors to a shortened life expectancy of 
10-20 years in patients with bipolar disorder as compared to the general 
population. In the general population an increase in survival has been observed 
over the last decades, primarily due to the advances in primary prophylaxis, 
medical treatment and progress in early detection and monitoring of somatic 
diseases. In this narrative review, we discuss the existing literature on 
treatment and outcomes of cardiovascular, respiratory, and cancer diseases in 
patients with bipolar disorder, and put this in the context of findings in 
studies on patients diagnosed with other severe mental disorders.
MAIN BODY: The existing literature suggests that patients with bipolar disorder 
receive fewer or delayed medical interventions, when admitted with severe 
somatic diseases, compared to those not diagnosed with bipolar disorder. 
Cardiovascular disease is the most investigated disease regarding outcomes in 
patients with severe mental illness, and novel findings indicate that the 
increased mortality following cardiac events in these patients can be reduced if 
they are intensively treated with secondary prophylactic cardiac intervention. 
Elderly patients diagnosed with mental disorders and cancer experience a delay 
in receiving specific cancer treatment. No studies have investigated treatment 
outcomes in patients with severe mental disease and respiratory diseases.
CONCLUSION: It is surprising and of major concern that patients with bipolar 
disorder have not benefitted from the significant improvement that has taken 
place over time over time of somatic treatments in general, especially in 
countries with equal and free access to healthcare services. Therefore, no 
matter whether this situation is a result of a negative attitude from health 
care providers to patients with mental illness, the result of the patient's lack 
of awareness of their physical illness or the results of other factors, further 
attention including research on developing strategies for improving the 
management of somatic diseases in patients with bipolar disorder is needed.

The tomato red spider mite, Tetranychus evansi Baker & Pritchard, is one of the 
main pests of the tomato crop in several countries, mainly in Africa, where it 
can reduce tomato yield by up to 90%. The biotic potential of this mite is high 
and its control is difficult because of low efficiency of chemicals used and the 
rapid development of resistance to acaricides. We used the two-sex life table to 
evaluate the effect of two wild tomato genotypes (PI134417 and PI134418) and 
five tomato varieties widely grown in Benin (Kekefo, Akikon, TLCV15, Tounvi, and 
TOML4) on demographic characteristics of T. evansi under laboratory conditions. 
Tetranychus evansi did not develop on the genotypes PI134417 and PI134418, 
indicating their resistance to this mite. Developmental time of immature stages 
and female longevity were significantly higher on TLCV15 and Kekefo. Fecundity, 
net reproductive rate (R0), intrinsic rate of increase (r), and finite rate of 
increase (λ) of T. evansi on the African varieties were not statistically 
different among varieties. Generation time (T) was shorter on TOML4 than on 
TLCV15 and Tounvi. Thus, efforts should be made to prospect varieties with 
resistance characteristics or to develop other control means, to reduce the use 
of pesticides to control T. evansi in Africa.

Median age at diagnosis for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is 
72 years, and the number of older individuals affected by this condition is 
predicted to increase in the future as populations age. Contrary to common 
assumptions, CLL significantly affects the life expectancy of older individuals, 
frequently presenting at a more advanced stage and with more unfavorable 
features than in the younger population. Therefore, identifying the optimal 
treatment for these patients is a priority. Older patients with CLL are usually 
classified as fit, non-fit, or frail based on performance status and 
comorbidities, and several assessment tools can be used to make these 
evaluations. While supportive care is appropriate for frail patients, the 
remaining patients should be treated when indication criteria are met. Treatment 
options include chemoimmunotherapy, monoclonal antibody-based approaches (such 
as the use of rituximab, ofatumumab, or obinutuzumab) and, more recently, small 
molecules (such as ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax). The choice of 
treatment is guided by the patient's performance status and co-morbidities and 
by the disease characteristics, such as chromosomal and molecular abnormalities, 
and in patients with recurrent disease also by the type of prior regimen, their 
tolerability, and duration of response.

Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of second-line pharmacological 
treatments in patients with acromegaly resistant to first-generation 
somatostatin analogues (FG SSA) from the Spanish National Health System (NHS) 
perspective.Methods: A Markov model was developed to analyze the 
cost-effectiveness of pegvisomant and pasireotide in FG SSA-resistant 
acromegaly, simulating a cohort of patients from the treatment beginning to 
death. Treatment with pegvisomant or pasireotide was compared to FG SSA 
retreatment. Efficacy data were obtained from clinical trials and utilities from 
the literature. Direct health costs were obtained from Spanish sources 
(€2018).Results: The Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of pegvisomant 
vs. FG SSA was €85,869/Quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The ICER of 
pasireotide vs. FG SSA was €551,405/QALY. The ICER was mainly driven by the 
incremental efficacy (4.41 QALY for pegvisomant vs. FG SSA and 0.71 QALY for 
pasireotide vs. FG SSA), with a slightly lower increase in costs with 
pegvisomant (€378,597 vs. FG SSA) than with pasireotide (€393,151 vs. FG 
SSA).Conclusion: The ICER of pasireotide compared to FG SSA was six times higher 
than the ICER of pegvisomant vs. FG SSA. Pegvisomant is a more cost-effective 
alternative for the treatment of acromegaly in FG SSA-resistant patients in the 
Spanish NHS.

This study is aimed to estimate the epidemiological burden of dengue in Odisha, 
India using the disability adjusted life year (DALY) methods and to explore the 
associated factors in the year 2010-2016. During the period of 2010-2016, 27 772 
cases (68.4% male) were reported in the state. Mean age (years) of male and 
female was 31.63 and 33.82, respectively. Mean district wise disability adjusted 
life years (DALY) per 100 000 people was higher in the year 2016 (0.45) and mean 
DALY lost per person was highest in the year 2015 (34.90 years). Adjusted 
regression model indicates, every unit increase in humidity and population 
density increases DALY by 1.05 and 1.02 units respectively. Whereas, unit change 
in sex ratio (females per 1000 males) and forest coverage increases the DALY by 
0.98 units. Our results indicate geographical variation of DALY in Odisha, which 
is associated with population density, humidity and forest cover. Discrepancies 
identified between standard incidence and DALY maps suggests, latter can be used 
to present disease burden more effectively. More prevalence among young males 
suggests the need of strengthening the targeted prevention and control measures.

BACKGROUND: A considerable number of prostate cancer (PCa) patients eligible for 
expectant management receive definitive treatment. We aimed to investigate the 
hospital-level contribution to overtreatment in the United States.
METHODS: Using the National Cancer Database we identified two nonoverlapping 
cohorts: (1) men with a life expectancy <10 years harbouring low or intermediate 
risk PCa (2) men with life expectancy ≥10 years with low-risk PCa. Multivariable 
mixed models with patient characteristics as fixed and hospital-level intercept 
as random effect were used to assess the hospital-level risk-adjusted 
probability of definitive treatment in both groups. Pearson's correlation 
coefficient was calculated to investigate the correlation between the hospitals 
probabilities of treating patients of both cohorts.
RESULTS: We found 33,431 men with a life expectancy <10 years and 122,514 men 
with a life expectancy ≥10 years and low-risk PCa. In the latter, the 
probability of treatment ranged from 29.0% in the bottom to 90.0% in the top 
decile and from 35.0% to 88.0% for men with a life expectancy <10 years. Age and 
race were independent predictors of low-value treatment in both cohorts. The 
correlation between 1,225 hospitals treating men of both cohorts was strong 
(Pearson's r = 0.66, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: There is wide hospital-level variability in low-value treatment of 
men with limited life expectancies and low-risk PCa. Hospitals more likely to 
treat men with limited life expectancies were more likely to treat men with 
low-risk PCa and vice versa. Identifying drivers and modifying practice at these 
hospitals may represent an effective tool for reducing overtreatment.

Tuberculosis has risen to worldwide attention due to its widespread diffusion 
and overall impact on health and life expectancy. Despite being historically 
neglected, children require a different approach and management from adults. 
From the treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis to extensively 
drug-resistant strains, and extrapulmonary disease, therapies in children 
require revision and a more children-oriented approach. We therefore exposed the 
main critical points and differences between treatment in adults and children 
and the possible consequences on outcome, safety and tolerability.
