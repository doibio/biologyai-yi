compared with healthy controls. These results suggest an impaired HRQoL in 
meningioma patients, even years after anti-tumor treatment. Results of this 
systematic review warrant high quality prospective studies, better instruments 
to assess HRQoL, and improved level of reporting for this group of patients.

BACKGROUND: International guidelines recommend nintedanib (OFEV®) as an option 
for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of 
nintedanib versus pirfenidone, N-acetylcysteine and best supportive care (BSC) 
for the treatment of IPF from a UK payer's perspective.
METHODS: A Markov model was designed to capture the changes in the condition of 
adults with IPF. Efficacy outcomes included mortality, lung function decline and 
acute exacerbations. Treatment safety (serious adverse events) and tolerability 
(overall discontinuation) were also considered. The baseline risk of these 
events was derived from patient-level data from the placebo arms of nintedanib 
clinical trials (TOMORROW, INPULSIS-1, INPULSIS-2). A network meta-analysis 
(NMA) was conducted to estimate the relative effectiveness of the comparator 
treatments. Quality of life and healthcare resource use data from the clinical 
trials were also incorporated in the economic model.
RESULTS: Nintedanib showed statistically significant differences against placebo 
on acute exacerbation events avoided and lung function decline. In the 
cost-effectiveness analysis, the results were split between two treatments with 
relative low costs and modest effectiveness (BSC and N-acetylcysteine) and two 
that showed improved effectiveness (lung function) and higher costs (nintedanib 
and pirfenidone). All comparators were assumed to have similar projected 
survival and the difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was driven by 
the acute exacerbations and lung function estimates. In the base-case 
deterministic pairwise comparison with pirfenidone, nintedanib was found to have 
fewer acute exacerbations and resulted in less costs and more QALYs gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with BSC (placebo), nintedanib and pirfenidone were the 
only treatments to show statistical significance in the efficacy parameters. We 
found substantial uncertainty in the overall cost-effectiveness results between 
nintedanib and pirfenidone. N-Acetylcysteine was largely similar to BSC but with 
a worse survival profile. INPULSIS-1 and INPULSIS-2 ClinicalTrials.gov numbers,

INTRODUCTION: Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) is primarily 
treated with low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), a strategy based on studies 
showing it to be superior to the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) warfarin for 
preventing VTE recurrence. Subsequent analyses suggest that the magnitude of 
this benefit might be less than previously determined. Neither patient-focused 
measures of utility nor the costs of each strategy have been evaluated in the 
current treatment era.
METHODS: This is a cost-effectiveness analysis of VKA and LMWH for the treatment 
of cancer-associated thrombosis through use of a microsimulation model of 
outcomes for competing anticoagulation management strategies from a 2014 United 
States societal perspective.
RESULTS: LMWH therapy added 0.27 QALYs relative to VKA treatment with an ICER of 
$217,007. One-way sensitivity analysis evaluating the utility of LMWH revealed 
that VKA was always the preferred strategy at a willingness to pay (WTP) 
threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Limitations include that the model incorporates 
a low VKA time in therapeutic range (TTR) and that the TTR in some centers may 
be higher thereby increasing the cost-effectiveness of the VKA strategy. 
Utilities for anticoagulation strategies were not derived from cancer patients, 
and preference is known to vary depending on how anticoagulation method is 
integrated with cancer treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that compared to LMWH, warfarin is a more 
cost-effective strategy to treat cancer-associated VTE. Although LMWH is 
associated with a modest increase in life expectancy, this increase comes at 
significant cost.

Rheumatic and joint diseases, as exemplified by osteoarthritis and rheumatoid 
arthritis, are among the most widespread painful and disabling pathologies 
across the globe. Given the continuing rise in life expectancy, their prevalence 
is destined to grow. Osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease, is, in 
particular, on its way to becoming the fourth leading cause of disability 
worldwide by 2020, with the rising incidence of obesity in addition to age being 
important factors. It is estimated that 25% of osteoarthritic individuals are 
unable to perform daily activities. Accompanying osteoarthritis is rheumatoid 
arthritis, which is a chronic systemic disease that often causes pain and 
deformity. At least 50% of those affected are unable to remain gainfully 
employed within 10 years of disease onset. A growing body of evidence now points 
to inflammation, locally and more systemically, as a promoter of damage to 
joints and bones, as well as joint-related functional deficits. The pathogenesis 
underlying joint diseases remains unclear; however, it is currently believed 
that cross-talk between cartilage and subchondral bone-and loss of balance 
between these two structures in joint diseases-is a critical element. This view 
is amplified by the presence of mast cells, whose dysregulation is associated 
with alterations of junction structures (cartilage, bone, synovia, matrix, nerve 
endings, and blood vessels). In addition, persistent activation of mast cells 
facilitates the development of spinal neuroinflammation mediated through their 
interaction with microglia. Unfortunately, current treatment strategies for 
rheumatic and articular disease are symptomatic and do little to limit disease 
progression. Research now should be directed at therapeutic modalities that 
target osteoarticular structural elements and thereby delaying disease 
progression and joint replacement.

BACKGROUND: The early detection and adequate management of cardiometabolic 
diseases (CMD) is becoming a priority to prevent future health problems and 
related healthcare costs.
AIM: This study systematically reviewed the economic evaluations of screening 
programmes for the early detection of persons at risk for CMD.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, Web of Science, NHSEED 
and the CEA registry to identify relevant articles published between 1 January 
2005 and 1 May 2015. Two reviewers independently selected articles, 
systematically extracted data and critically appraised the study quality using 
the Extended Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) List.
RESULTS: From the initial 2820 studies identified, 17 were included. Six studies 
assessed whether screening would be cost-effective, seven aimed to determine the 
most efficient screening programme and four assessed the cost-effectiveness of 
existing programmes. There were 11 cost-utility analyses using quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years. Decision-analytic 
modelling (e.g. Markov model) was most frequently used (n = 10), followed by 
simulation models (n = 4), observational (n = 2) and trial-based (n = 1) 
studies. All studies assessing the cost per QALY gained of screening for 
cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus (n = 8) were below a threshold of 
£30 000, while those assessing chronic kidney diseases (n = 2) were above the 
threshold. Conclusions: In view of the heterogeneity in study objectives, 
country setting, screening programmes, comparators, methodology and outcomes, it 
is not possible to make clear recommendations about the economic value of 
screening programmes for CMD. Developing further screening programmes and 
conducting thorough economic analysis, including usual care, is needed.

In order to leverage novel sequencing techniques for cloning genes in eukaryotic 
organisms with complex genomes, the false positive rate of variant discovery 
must be controlled for by experimental design and informatics. We sequenced five 
lines from three pedigrees of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized Sorghum 
bicolor, including a pedigree segregating a recessive dwarf mutant. Comparing 
the sequences of the lines, we were able to identify and eliminate error-prone 
positions. One genomic region contained EMS mutant alleles in dwarfs that were 
homozygous reference sequences in wild-type siblings and heterozygous in 
segregating families. This region contained a single nonsynonymous change that 
cosegregated with dwarfism in a validation population and caused a premature 
stop codon in the Sorghum ortholog encoding the gibberellic acid (GA) 
biosynthetic enzyme ent-kaurene oxidase. Application of exogenous GA rescued the 
mutant phenotype. Our method for mapping did not require outcrossing and 
introduced no segregation variance. This enables work when line crossing is 
complicated by life history, permitting gene discovery outside of genetic 
models. This inverts the historical approach of first using recombination to 
define a locus and then sequencing genes. Our formally identical approach first 
sequences all the genes and then seeks cosegregation with the trait. Mutagenized 
lines lacking obvious phenotypic alterations are available for an extension of 
this approach: mapping with a known marker set in a line that is phenotypically 
identical to starting material for EMS mutant generation.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal strategy for 
men with newly diagnosed intermediate-risk prostate cancer by age and cardiac 
risk.
METHODS: A Markov model was calibrated to the EORTC 22991 trial, which randomly 
assigned men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer to radiation therapy (RT) 
with or without six months of hormonal therapy (HT). We compared 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in men age 50, 60, and 70 years by age 
decile and cardiac risk group. Competing risks of cardiovascular mortality were 
estimated from the published literature. Sensitivity analyses were used to 
assess the impact of varying model assumptions.
RESULTS: HT was associated with a net decrease of 0.3 to 0.4 QALYs in men with a 
history of myocardial infarction. However, for all other men, HT improved QALYs 
(range = 0.4-2.6 QALYs). Younger men with fewer cardiac risk factors experienced 
the largest benefit from HT. In sensitivity analyses, the model was only found 
to be sensitive to the probability of biochemical failure. Men at low risk for 
biochemical failure (≤8.7% at five years) did not benefit from HT. Further, the 
benefits of HT did not begin to manifest until after 7.3 years of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The optimal choice of therapy depends upon age, cardiac risk, and 
disease recurrence risk. Young men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer with 
no cardiac risk factors benefit most from HT. Men with a history of myocardial 
infarction who are at very low risk for biochemical failure may be negatively 
impacted by the addition of HT.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of conservative versus surgical 
treatment strategies for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).
METHODS: Patients prospectively enrolled in the multicenter Lumbar Stenosis 
Outcome Study (LSOS) with a minimum follow-up of 12 months were included. 
Quality adjusted life years (QALY) were calculated based on EQ-5D data. Cost 
data were retrieved retrospectively. Cost-effectiveness was calculated via 
decision tree analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 434 patients were included, treated surgically (n = 170) or 
conservatively (n = 264) for LSS. The majority of surgically treated patients 
underwent decompression (n = 141, 82.9%), and 17.1% (n = 29) additionally 
underwent fusion. A reoperation was required in 13 (7.6%) surgically treated 
patients. In 27 (10.2%) conservatively treated patients, a single infiltration 
was successful, with no further infiltration or surgery within the follow-up. 
However, 46 patients (17.4%) required multiple infiltrations, and in 191 (72.4%) 
initially conservatively treated patients a subsequent surgery was needed. The 
area under the curve was 0.776 QALY in the surgical arm (0.776 and 0.790, 
decompression or additional fusion, respectively), compared to 0.778 in the 
conservative arm. Treatment costs were estimated at CHF 12,958 and 13,637 (USD 
13,465 and 14,169) in surgically and initially conservatively treated patients, 
respectively [base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER): CHF 
392,145, USD 407,831], per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
identified surgery as the preferred strategy in 67.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the surgical and the conservative treatment approach resulted 
in a comparable health-related quality of life within the first year after study 
inclusion. Due to slightly higher costs, mostly because the majority of 
initially conservatively treated patients underwent multiple infiltrations or a 
subsequent surgery, decompressive surgery was identified as the most 
cost-effective approach for LSS in this setting.

OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic 
pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) decrease life expectancy for affected patients. 
The aim was to describe the perceptions of received information regarding 
diagnosis, treatment and management, as well as social support and coping 
perceived by patients with PAH or CTEPH.
METHODS: A descriptive, national cohort survey that included patients from all 
PAH-centres in Sweden. A quantitative methodology was employed where all 
patients received three questionnaires, QLQ-INFO25, Mastery Scale and Social 
Network & Support Scale.
RESULTS: The response rate was 74% (n=325), mean age 66±14years, 71% were female 
and 69% were diagnosed with PAH and 31% with CTEPH. Sixty percent of respondents 
were satisfied with the received information and felt it was helpful. Best 
experiences were of information in the areas of medical tests (70%) and the 
disease (61%). Forty-five percent wanted more information. Men described their 
social network as more accessible than women (p=0.004). Those living alone had a 
lower coping ability.
CONCLUSION: Despite a high level of satisfaction with the received information, 
almost half of the patients wanted more information.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Regular repeating or giving new information should be an 
ongoing process in the care of patients at the PAH-centres.

The world total of passenger cars is expected to go from the current one billion 
to >2.5 billion by 2050. Cars for domestic use account for ~74% of the world's 
yearly production of motorized vehicles. In North America, ~80% of the commuters 
use their own car with another 5.6% travelling as passengers. With the current 
life-expectancy of 78.6 years, the average North American spends 4.3 years 
driving a car! This equates to driving 101 minutes/day with a lifetime driving 
distance of nearly 1.3 million km inside the confined and often shared space of 
the car with exposure to a mix of potentially harmful pathogens, allergens, 
endotoxins, particulates, and volatile organics. Such risks may increase in 
proportion to the unprecedented upsurge in the numbers of family cars globally. 
Though new technologies may reduce the levels of air pollution from car exhausts 
and other sources, they are unlikely to impact our in-car exposure to pathogens. 
Can commercial in-car air decontamination devices reduce the risk from airborne 
infections and other pollutants? We lack scientifically rigorous protocols to 
verify the claims of such devices. Here we discuss the essentials of a 
customized aerobiology facility and test protocols to assess such devices under 
field-relevant conditions.

BACKGROUND: The incidence and mortality of kidney cancer have steadily increased 
by 2%- 3% per decade worldwide, and an increased risk of kidney cancer has been 
observed in many Asian countries. The information on the incidence and mortality 
of a disease and its distribution is essential for better planning for 
prevention and further studies.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the incidence and mortality of kidney 
cancer and their correlation with the human development index (HDI) in Asia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This ecological study was based on GLOBOCAN data Asia for 
assessment the correlation between age-specific incidence rate (ASIR) and 
age-specific mortality rate (ASMR) with HDI and its details that include life 
expectancy at birth, mean years of schooling and gross national income (GNI) per 
capita. We use of correlation bivariate method for assessment the correlation 
between ASIR and ASMR with HDI and its components.
RESULTS: A total of 121 099 kidney cancer cases were recorded in Asian countries 
in 2012.Overall, 80 080 cases (66.12%) were males. Sex ratio was 1.95. The three 
countries with the highest number of new patients were china (66 466 cases), 
Japan (16 830 cases), India(9658 cases), respectively. Positive correlation were 
seen between HDI and ASIR of kidney cancer 0.655 (P = 0.001), and HDI and ASMR 
of kidney cancer 0.285 (P = 0.055).
CONCLUSIONS: A positive relationship between ASIR and the HDI was seen. The 
relationship is due to risk factors in countries with high development such as 
older age, smoking, hypertension, obesity, and diet. However, ASMR showed no 
significant relationship with HDI.

The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most important 
food-related pathogens worldwide. Besides contact to oocysts or ingestion of 
tissue cysts mainly by consumption of raw or undercooked meat from infected 
animals, raw milk is considered to be a risk factor and possible route of 
transmission for tachyzoites. This stage of the parasite is usually very 
sensitive to acidic pH and, therefore, considered unlikely to survive stomach 
passage. However, tachyzoites were shown to survive for several days in milk and 
there are also reports on transmission of toxoplasmosis via milk. Thus, the aim 
of the study was to examine retention of infectivity of tachyzoites in simulated 
gastric fluid (SGF) of different acidity and to elucidate whether addition of 
different shares of milk would affect survival of the parasites. Tachyzoites 
were exposed to SGF of pH 2.0 through 6.0 and their remaining infectivity was 
examined by cell culture. Furthermore, the impact on survival was investigated 
in different admixtures of milk to the SGF (25, 50, 75%) as well as in pure 
milk. Tachyzoites were shown to retain infectivity in SGF of pH 5.0 and 6.0 for 
at least 90min while they were more sensitive to lower pH values. Admixture of 
milk resulted in extension of survival. The results support the hypothesis of 
tachyzoites to survive stomach passage and their retention of infectivity.

The ultimate goal of treatment in people with diabetes mellitus is to prevent 
development of cardiovascular (CV) disease, resulting in prolongation of healthy 
life expectancy. Although impaired glycemic metabolism has a central role in its 
pathology, a number of studies have demonstrated that remedy for its imbalance 
cannot necessarily be accomplished as a therapeutic goal. A comprehensive 
medical approach against multi-factorial pathologies in diabetes, such as 
insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, in addition to diet 
and exercise therapy should be rather performed in the routine clinical setting. 
Along with such conceptual transition, what is required in anti-diabetes agents 
has also changed, and several anti-diabetes agents have been newly placed on the 
market in this decade. Such agents are required to undergo global pre- or 
post-marketing clinical trials assessing CV safety. A growing body of clinical 
evidence from those trials is now accumulating, and empagliflozin, a 
sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, has first demonstrated 
significant risk reduction, relative to placebo, in CV death, overall mortality, 
and hospitalization for worsened heart failure in high-risk patients with 
diabetes mellitus. An SGLT2 inhibitor is a unique glucose-lowering agent and at 
the same time has multifaceted effects on hemodynamic and metabolic parameters 
beyond glycemic control. A major mode of action of SGLT2 inhibitors appears to 
be 'glycosuria' and 'natriuresis,' leading to amelioration of systemic glycemic 
homeostasis and potential cardio-renal protection. However, the precise 
mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors affect benefits on the CV systems are yet 
to be fully elucidated. Thus, although we are now facing several unanswered 
concerns lurking behind the successful trial, SGLT2 inhibitors surely play 
several important roles in high-quality management of not only diabetes, but 
also CV medicine. This review summarizes our current understandings and future 
perspectives of SGLT2 inhibitors in CV medicine.

The Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis is the most economically important 
cultivated crab species in China, and its genome has a high number of 
chromosomes (2n = 146). To obtain sufficient markers for construction of a dense 
genetic map for this species, we employed the recently developed specific-locus 
amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) method for large-scale SNPs screening 
and genotyping in a F1 full-sib family of 149 individuals. SLAF-seq generated 
127,677 polymorphic SNP markers, of which 20,803 valid markers were assigned 
into five segregation types and were used together with previous SSR markers for 
linkage map construction. The final integrated genetic map included 17,680 SNP 
and 629 SSR markers on the 73 linkage groups (LG), and spanned 14,894.9 cM with 
an average marker interval of 0.81 cM. QTL mapping localized three significant 
growth-related QTL to a 1.2 cM region in LG53 as well as 146 sex-linked markers 
in LG48. Genome-wide QTL-association analysis further identified four 
growth-related QTL genes named LNX2, PAK2, FMRFamide and octopamine receptors. 
These genes are involved in a variety of different signaling pathways including 
cell proliferation and growth. The map and SNP markers described here will be a 
valuable resource for the E. sinensis genome project and selective breeding 
programs.

INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is the third most frequent neoplastic tumour in Spain, 
with around 27 000 new cases diagnosed per year; 80-95% of these are 
non-small-cell cancer (NSCLC), and the majority of cases are diagnosed in 
advanced stages of the disease, and for this reason it is one of the oncologic 
conditions with higher mortality rates (21.4% mean survival at 5 years). The 
main treatment regimens used for first-line treatment of NSCLC are: 
cisplatin/pemetrexed (cis/pem), cisplatin/gemcitabine/ bevacizumab 
(cis/gem/bev), and carboplatin/paclitaxel/ bevacizumab (carb/pac/bev). The 
objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness ratio of 
antineoplastic 1st line NSCLC treatment regimens, from the point of view of 
hospital management.
METHODOLOGY: A cost-efficacy mathematical model was prepared, based on a 
decision tree. The efficacy variable was Progression Free Survival, obtained 
from the PARAMOUNT, AVAIL and SAIL Phase III clinical trials. The study was 
conducted from the perspective of the hospital management, considering only the 
direct costs of drug acquisition. A deterministic sensitivity analysis was 
conducted to confirm the robustness of outcomes.
RESULTS: The PFS obtained in clinical trials with cis/pem, cis/ gem/bev and 
carb/pac/bev was: 6.9, 6.7 and 6.2 months, respectively. Based on our model, the 
mean cost of treatment per patient for these regimens was: 19 942 €, 15 594 € 
and 36 095 €, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per month 
of additional PFS between cis/pem and cis/gem/bev was 19 303 €. Estimating a 30% 
reduction in acquisition costs for pemetrexed (Alimta®Eli Lilly Nederland B.V.), 
due to the forthcoming launch of generic medications, the cis/pem treatment 
would become the predominant alternative for 1st line treatment of NSCLC 
patients, by offering the best health results at a lower cost.

Publisher: Introducción: El cáncer de pulmón es la tercera neoplasia tumoral más 
frecuente en España, con unos 27.000 nuevos casos/ año, de los que el 80-85% son 
de etiología no microcítica (NSCLC) y en la mayoría de los casos diagnosticados 
en estadíos avanzados de la enfermedad, razón por la que es uno de los procesos 
oncológicos con mayores tasas de mortalidad (supervivencia media a los 5 años 
del 21,4%). Los principales esquemas de primera línea utilizados en el 
tratamiento del NSCLC son: cisplatino/pemetrexed (cis/pem), 
cisplatino/gemcitabina/ bevacizumab (cis/gem/bev), y 
carboplatino/paclitaxel/bevacizumab (carbo/pac/Bev). El objetivo del presente 
trabajo consistirá en realizar un análisis para estimar el ratio coste-eficacia 
de los esquemas antineoplásicos de primera línea en el tratamiento del NSCLC, 
desde la perspectiva de la gerencia hospitalaria. Metodos: Se elaboró un modelo 
matemático de coste-eficacia basado en un árbol de decisiones. Como variable de 
eficacia se utilizó la supervivencia libre de progresión, obtenida de los 
ensayos clínicos fase III PARAMOUNT, AVAIL y SAIL. El estudio se efectuó desde 
la perspectiva de la gerencia hospitalaria considerando únicamente los costes 
directos de adquisición de los fármacos. Se realizó un análisis de sensibilidad 
determinístico para comprobar la robustez de los resultados. Resultados: La SLP 
obtenida en los ensayos clínicos de los tratamientos cis/pem, cis/gem/bev y 
carb/pac/bev fue de: 6,9, 6,7 y 6,2 meses, respectivamente. En base a nuestro 
modelo, el coste medio del tratamiento por paciente para estos esquemas fue de 
19.942 €, 15.594 € y 36.095 €, respectivamente. La razón coste-eficacia 
incremenal por mes de SLP adicional entre cis/pem y cis/gem/bev fue de 19.303 €. 
Estimando una reducción del 30% de los costes de adquisición de pemetrexed 
(Alimta®Eli Lilly Nederland B.V) ante su próxima incorporación al mercado de 
medicamentos genéricos, el tratamiento cis/pem se convertiría en la alternativa 
dominante en el tratamiento de primera línea de los pacientes con NSCLC, al 
ofrecer los mejores resultados en salud a un menor coste.

INTRODUCTION: There are large differences in the burden and health implications 
of obesity by race and gender in the US. It is unclear to what extent policies 
modifying caloric consumption change the distribution of the burden of obesity 
and related health outcomes. Meat is a large component of the American diet. We 
investigate how changing meat prices (that may result from policies or from 
exogenous factors that reduce supply) might impact the burden of obesity by race 
and gender.
METHODS: We construct a microsimulation model that evaluates the 15-year 
body-mass index (BMI) and mortality impact of changes in meat price (5, 10, 25, 
and 50% increase) in the US adult population stratified by age, gender, race, 
and BMI.
RESULTS: Under each price change evaluated, relative to the status quo, white 
males, black males, and black females are expected to realize more dramatic 
reduction in 2030 obesity prevalence than white females. Life expectancy gains 
are also projected to differ by subpopulation, with black males far less likely 
to benefit from an increase in meat prices than other groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Changing meat prices has considerable potential to affect 
population health differently by race and gender. In designing interventions 
that alter the price of foods to consumers, it is not sufficient to assess 
health effects based solely on the population as a whole, since differential 
effects across subpopulations may be substantial.

Seasonal influenza epidemics have a substantial public health and economic 
burden in the United States (US). On average, over 200,000 people are 
hospitalized and an estimated 23,000 people die from respiratory and circulatory 
complications associated with seasonal influenza virus infections each year. 
Annual direct medical costs and indirect productivity costs across the US have 
been found to average respectively at $10.4 billion and $16.3 billion. The 
objective of this study was to estimate the economic impact of severe 
influenza-induced illness on the US Veterans Affairs population. The five-year 
study period included 2010 through 2014. Influenza-attributed outcomes were 
estimated with a statistical regression model using observed emergency 
department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths from the Veterans Health 
Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic medical 
records and respiratory viral surveillance data from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC). Data from VA's Managerial Cost Accounting system 
were used to estimate the costs of the emergency department and hospital visits. 
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were used to estimate the costs of lost 
productivity; data on age at death, life expectancy and economic valuations for 
a statistical life year were used to estimate the costs of a premature death. An 
estimated 10,674 (95% CI 8,661-12,687) VA ED visits, 2,538 (95% CI 2,112-2,964) 
VA hospitalizations, 5,522 (95% CI 4,834-6,210) all-cause deaths, and 3,793 (95% 
CI 3,375-4,211) underlying respiratory or circulatory deaths (inside and outside 
VA) among adult Veterans were attributable to influenza each year from 2010 
through 2014. The annual value of lost productivity amounted to $27 (95% CI 
$24-31) million and the annual costs for ED visits were $6.2 (95% CI $5.1-7.4) 
million. Ninety-six percent of VA hospitalizations resulted in either death or a 
discharge to home, with annual costs totaling $36 (95% CI $30-43) million. The 
remaining 4% of hospitalizations were followed by extended care at 
rehabilitation and skilled nursing facilities with annual costs totaling $5.5 
(95% CI $4.4-6.8) million. The annual monetary value of quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) lost amounted to $1.1 (95% CI $1.0-1.2) billion. In total, the 
estimated annual economic burden was $1.2 (95% CI $1.0-1.3) billion, indicating 
the substantial burden of seasonal influenza epidemics on the US Veterans 
Affairs population. Premature death was found to be the largest driver of these 
costs, followed by hospitalization.

BACKGROUND: Infections with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) are a global public 
health problem. Long-term consequences are the development of liver cirrhosis 
and hepatocellular carcinoma. Newly introduced direct acting antivirals, 
especially interferon-free regimens, have improved rates of sustained viral 
response above 90% in most patient groups and allow treating patients who were 
ineligible for treatment in the past. These new regimens have replaced former 
treatment and are recommended by current guidelines. However, there is an 
ongoing discussion on high pharmaceutical prices. Our aim was to assess the 
long-term cost-effectiveness of treating hepatitis C genotype 1 patients with 
sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) treatment in Germany.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used a Markov cohort model to simulate disease 
progression and assess cost-effectiveness. The model calculates lifetime costs 
and outcomes (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) of SOF/LDV and other 
strategies. Patients were stratified by treatment status (treatment-naive and 
treatment-experienced) and absence/presence of cirrhosis. Different treatment 
strategies were compared to prior standard of care. Sensitivity analyses were 
performed to evaluate model robustness.
RESULTS: Base-case analyses results show that in treatment-naive non-cirrhotic 
patients treatment with SOF/LDV dominates the prior standard of care (is more 
effective and less costly). In cirrhotic patients an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 3,383 €/QALY was estimated. In 
treatment-experienced patients ICERs were 26,426 €/QALY and 1,397 €/QALY for 
treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, respectively. Robustness of 
results was confirmed in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that treatment with SOF/LDV is cost-effective 
compared to prior standard of care in all patient groups considering 
international costs per QALY thresholds.

Patients with schizophrenia exhibit a reduced life expectancy. Although 
unhealthy lifestyle or suicide risk plays a role, the main causes are diverse 
medical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
metabolic syndrome. Albeit pharmacological secondary side effects might also 
trigger previous conditions, studies in naïve patients reflect diverse anomalies 
at the onset. Patients with a first episode of psychosis, display a wide scope 
of metabolic abnormalities, ranging from normality till pathological values 
depending on the parameters studied. We attempted to evaluate the metabolic 
syndrome and glycemic homeostasis in a subset of antipsychotic-naïve patients 
with a first episode of non-affective psychosis. Patients (n=84) showed a 
similar prevalence of metabolic syndrome compared with a matched control sample 
(n=98) (6% vs 4%, P=0.562), while glucose homeostasis values differed 
significantly (14% vs. 5%, P=0.034). Our results suggest that metabolic syndrome 
is not a useful clinical condition to be evaluated in patients before 
pharmacological treatment. Abnormal glycemic homeostasis at the onset of the 
disease requires specific diagnostic tools and preventive measures in order to 
avoid future cardiovascular events. New strategies must be implemented in order 
to evaluate the cardiovascular risk and subsequent morbidity in patients at the 
onset of the disease.

Fibrosing lung disorders include a large number of diseases with diverse 
behaviour. Patients can die because of the progression of their illness, remain 
stable or even improve after appropriate treatment has been instituted. 
Comorbidities, such as acute and chronic infection, gastro-oesophageal reflux, 
pulmonary hypertension, lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and obstructive 
sleep apnoea, can pre-exist or develop at any time during the course of the 
disease and, if unidentified and untreated, may impair quality of life, impact 
upon the respiratory status of the patients, and ultimately lead to disease 
progression and death. Therefore, early identification and accurate treatment of 
comorbidities is essential.
