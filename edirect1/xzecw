efgartigimod alfa provided consistent clinically meaningful improvements in 
patients with gMG. Efgartigimod alfa was generally well tolerated, with most 
adverse events being mild to moderate in severity.

Plain Language Summary: Generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a chronic, 
autoimmune neuromuscular disorder that can significantly impair quality of life. 
Several novel targeted therapeutic approaches have emerged to provide faster 
onset of action compared with conventional immunosuppressive therapy, favourable 
tolerability profile and the potential for a sustained disease control for 
patients with gMG. Intravenous efgartigimod alfa (also known as efgartigimod 
alfa-fcab in the USA; Vyvgart®) is the first neonatal Fc receptor antagonist 
approved in several countries worldwide, including the USA and EU for the 
treatment of gMG in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody 
positive, and in Japan for the treatment of gMG regardless of antibody status. 
In the pivotal clinical trial in patients with gMG, efgartigimod alfa rapidly 
reduced disease burden and improved muscle strength and quality of life. The 
beneficial effects of efgartigimod alfa occurred early and were durable and 
reproducible. Longer term, efgartigimod alfa provided consistent clinically 
meaningful improvements in patients with gMG. Efgartigimod alfa is generally 
well tolerated, with most adverse events being mild to moderate in severity. 
Thus, efgartigimod alfa is a novel, effective and generally well-tolerated 
treatment option for patients with gMG.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is the 12th most common cancer worldwide, with an 
overall survival rate of 4.9%. Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is essential 
for timely treatment and survival. Artificial intelligence (AI) provides 
advanced models and algorithms for better diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore AI models used for the prediction and 
early diagnosis of pancreatic cancers as reported in the literature.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted and reported in line with the PRISMA-ScR 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension 
for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, 
BioRXiv, and MedRxiv were explored to identify relevant articles. Study 
selection and data extraction were independently conducted by 2 reviewers. Data 
extracted from the included studies were synthesized narratively.
RESULTS: Of the 1185 publications, 30 studies were included in the scoping 
review. The included articles reported the use of AI for 6 different purposes. 
Of these included articles, AI techniques were mostly used for the diagnosis of 
pancreatic cancer (14/30, 47%). Radiological images (14/30, 47%) were the most 
frequently used data in the included articles. Most of the included articles 
used data sets with a size of <1000 samples (11/30, 37%). Deep learning models 
were the most prominent branch of AI used for pancreatic cancer diagnosis in the 
studies, and the convolutional neural network was the most used algorithm 
(18/30, 60%). Six validation approaches were used in the included studies, of 
which the most frequently used approaches were k-fold cross-validation (10/30, 
33%) and external validation (10/30, 33%). A higher level of accuracy (99%) was 
found in studies that used support vector machine, decision trees, and k-means 
clustering algorithms.
CONCLUSIONS: This review presents an overview of studies based on AI models and 
algorithms used to predict and diagnose pancreatic cancer patients. AI is 
expected to play a vital role in advancing pancreatic cancer prediction and 
diagnosis. Further research is required to provide data that support clinical 
decisions in health care.

The climate has drastically changed over the past two decades. Rising 
temperatures and climate change may lead to increased evapotranspiration, 
specifically soil evaporation, causing water to evaporate and salt to accumulate 
in the soil, resulting in increased soil salinity. As a result, there is a need 
to evaluate methods for predicting and monitoring the effects of salinity on 
crop growth and production through rapid screening. Our study was conducted on 
20 wheat genotypes, 10 sensitive and 10 tolerant, exposed to two salinity levels 
(90 and 120 mM NaCl) with the control under greenhouse conditions. Our results 
revealed significant differences in the genotypes' response to salinity. Salt 
stress decreased chlorophyll index in sensitive genotypes but increased 
chlorophyll a and carotenoids in tolerant genotypes at 90 mM. Salt stress also 
increased protein, proline, lipoxygenase, and reactive thiobarbituric acid 
levels in all wheat genotypes. The study suggests that plant photosynthetic 
efficiency is a reliable, non-destructive biomarker for determining the salt 
tolerance of wheat genotypes, while other biochemical traits are destructive and 
time-consuming and therefore not suitable for rapid screening.

OBJECTIVE: Vestibular schwannoma (VS) growth of ≥2 mm during serial MRI 
observation, irrespective of size, is the benchmark for treatment initiation in 
almost all centers. Although the probability of less optimal outcomes 
significantly increases in VS closer to the brainstem, early intervention does 
not improve long-term quality of life. Moving beyond the recommendation of 
definitive treatment for all VS after detected growth, we subclassified Koos 2 
tumors based on extrameatal extension and relation to the brainstem. The aim of 
the current study was to evaluate the Koos 2 subclassification's validity and 
the inter-and intra-rater reliability of the entire Koos classification.
METHODS: Six experts, including neurosurgeons, otorhinolaryngologists and 
radiologists from two tertiary referral centers, classified 43 VS MRI scans. 
Validity of the Koos 2 subclassification was evaluated by the percentage 
agreement against the multidisciplinary skull base tumor board management 
advice. Inter- and intra-rater reliability were calculated using the intraclass 
correlation coefficient (ICC).
RESULTS: Validity was almost perfect in Koos 2a VSs with a 100% agreement and 
87.5% agreement for Koos 2b. Inter-rater reliability for all Koos grades was 
significantly excellent (ICC 0.91; 95%CI 0.866 to 0.944, p= <0.001). Five raters 
had an excellent intra-rater reliability (ICC > 0.90; p= <0.01) and one rater 
had a good intra-rater reliability (ICC 0.88; 95% CI 0.742 to 0.949).
CONCLUSIONS: Although multiple factors influence decision-making, the 
classification of Koos 2a and 2b with excellent inter- and intra-rater 
reliability, can aid in recommending treatment initiation, moving beyond 
detected tumor growth, aiming to optimize patient centered care.

Many neurons undergo apoptosis after ischemic stroke. In the brain, neurogenesis 
has the potential for neuronal replacement and can be activated by external 
conditions to repair the injury. Crocetin (CRO), naturally extracted from the 
plant saffron, acts as a neuroprotective agent for ischemic stroke. However, the 
underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this work, the effect of CRO on neural 
stem cell (NSC) behaviors and subventricular zone neurogenesis is investigated. 
Initially, NSCs are incubated with different concentrations of CRO to detect the 
cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro. Second, ischemic stroke induced 
rats are treated with CRO using nimodipine (NMDP) as a comparison. The 
behavioral functions, infarcted volume, and apoptotic Nissl bodies of rats are 
noticeably improved after CRO-treatment, comparable to those of NMDP. In 
addition, the increased regional cerebral blood flow and promoted neuronal 
differentiation are achieved by CRO-treatment. Brain tissue examination shows 
significantly increased neuronal regeneration in the focal ischemic injury area. 
Meanwhile, the length of neurites is prolonged, indicating that CRO could 
potentially promote neurite extension to enhance cell-cell communication. These 
findings demonstrate that CRO facilitated the neuronal differentiation of NSCs 
by activating subventricular zone neurogenesis in damaged cortex and striatum 
sites to repair ischemic stroke.

The purpose of this study was to develop and assess the antimicrobial properties 
of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)-based whey emulsions and edible films for 
extending the shelf life of fruits and vegetables. The AgNPs were synthesized 
using a biological method, and their morphological and topographical 
characteristics were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The 
AgNPs were incorporated into the emulsions and films to increase their 
antimicrobial efficacy. Bacterial and fungal strains were identified by DNA 
regions, including 16S and 18S rRNA, TEF-1α, and RPB2 to evaluate antimicrobial 
activity. AgNPs-based emulsions and films were used to extend the shelf life of 
fruits and vegetables for up to 15 days. The results showed that the use of 
AgNPs in the coated samples significantly increased their effectiveness against 
bacterial and fungal strains. SEM analysis revealed the presence of AgNPs of 
varying sizes, ranging from 21 to 62 nm. The zones of inhibition were measured 
against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, 
Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus tamari, and Aspergillus niger. The total viable 
count (log cfu/ml) decreased from 6.423 in the control group to 3.301 in the 
treated samples. The antioxidant activity of the treated fruits and vegetables 
was also significantly improved, with values of 56.12, 23.36, 26.10, 7.6, 36.04, 
and 33.81% for strawberry, taro root, guava, peas, green chili, and carrot, 
respectively (p < 0.05). The AgNPs-based whey protein emulsions were found to 
exhibit the highest antimicrobial activity and are therefore a promising 
approach to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables.

Patients with schizophrenia are burdened by higher rates of obesity, 
cardiovascular disease and reduced life expectancy than the general population. 
In addition to illness, genetic and lifestyle factors, the associated weight 
gain and metabolic adverse effects of antipsychotic (AP) medications are known 
to exacerbate and accelerate these cardiometabolic problems significantly. Given 
the detrimental consequences of weight gain and other metabolic disturbances, 
there is an urgent need for safe and effective strategies to manage these issues 
as early on as possible. This review summarizes the literature of adjunctive 
pharmacological interventions aimed at preventing AP-induced weight gain.

BACKGROUND: Although dietary factors play a crucial role in the incidence of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), the specific dietary risk factors vary across 
regions and require further investigation.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to analyze the burden of CVD due to different dietary 
factors by sex, age, and sociodemographic index (SDI) for 204 countries and 
territories between 1990 and 2019.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 and analyzed 
to determine population attributable fractions (PAFs), mortality, 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and trends thereof, for CVDs 
attributable to dietary risk factors from 1990 to 2019. We used a generalized 
linear model with a Gaussian distribution to calculate the estimated annual 
percentage changes (EAPCs) in CVD mortality and DALY rates attributable to 
dietary risk factors. We also used a comparative risk-assessment framework to 
estimate CVD mortality and DALYs attributable to dietary risk factors.
RESULTS: Approximately 40% of CVD mortality and DALY rates were attributable to 
dietary risk factors, with high-sodium intake, low whole grain intake, and low 
legume intake being the greatest dietary risk factors globally. Moreover, high 
SDI regions had the highest PAFs for CVD mortality and DALYs associated with 
high red and processed meat intake, middle SDI regions had the highest PAFs with 
high-sodium intake, and low SDI regions had the highest PAFs with low fruit and 
vegetable intake. The highest PAFs for CVD mortality and DALYs were associated 
with low whole grain intake in 13 and 9 regions, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Reducing sodium intake and increasing whole grain and legume intake 
should be the top priority worldwide for improving regional diets and thereby 
decreasing CVD burdens. Other priorities should be set for regions with 
different SDIs, depending on the predominant dietary risk factors for CVDs in 
the respective regions.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B is a global public health concern, and modifiable risk 
factors can accelerate progression of this disease. The burden of hepatitis B 
attributable to modifiable risk factors has not been well evaluated. We aimed to 
estimate the disease burden of hepatitis B attributable to tobacco, alcohol use, 
and a high body mass index (BMI) to guide lifestyle interventions in the 
management of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
RESULTS: In 2019, 33.73% of hepatitis B age-standardized deaths and 34.52% of 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were attributable to tobacco, alcohol 
use, and a high BMI. The proportion showed an increasing trend that 28.23% of 
deaths and 27.56% of DALYs were attributable to the three modifiable risk 
factors in 1990. The hepatitis B burden attributable to modifiable risk factors 
was disparate across regions and countries. Countries with a low socioeconomic 
status have a high burden of hepatitis B owing to modifiable risk factors. 
Countries with a high-level sociodemographic index also had an increasing burden 
of hepatitis B attributable to a high BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle interventions are warranted in hepatitis prevention 
strategies and plans of action. Countries with low and middle socioeconomic 
development should be prioritized, and countries with high socioeconomic 
development should be aware of the novel challenge of a high BMI-related disease 
burden.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the burden of tobacco consumption on mortality and years 
of life expectancy lost in population ≥35 years in Brazil in the period 
1996-2019 and to identify trend changes in smoking-attributable mortality.
METHOD: An independent prevalence method using the lung cancer mortality rate as 
a proxy for cumulative smoking risk was used to estimate smoking-attributable 
mortality. Smoking-attributable mortality is estimated from the lung cancer 
mortality rate and applying relative risks from 5 US cohorts. 
Smoking-attributable mortality, crude and standardized attributed mortality 
rates are presented overall, by sex, age and causes of death. Trend analysis was 
performed by applying joinpoint regression models. Years of life expectancy lost 
due to tobacco were calculated.
RESULTS: Tobacco consumption caused 2,389,831 deaths in Brazil between 
1996-2019. Cardiometabolic diseases were the leading cause of death in women 
throughout the period and in men until 2015. Since 2006, smoking-attributable 
mortality rates in men, regardless of age, show a decreasing trend while in 
females the evolution is different. The years of life expectancy lost show a 
slight decrease since the first triennia and are higher in men.
CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, the 8.5% of total mortality between 1996-2019 is 
attributed to tobacco consumption. It is important to monitor the burden of the 
tobacco consumption on mortality in order to strengthen or implement 
interventions against smoking in Brazil.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systematically review the use of 
cost-effectiveness (CE) threshold for evaluating pharmacological interventions 
in Greece.
METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and ScienceDirect was conducted between 
January 2009 and June 2022. The data of selected studies were extracted using a 
relevant form and consequently were synthesized. Qualitative variables were 
presented with relative frequencies (%) and quantitative variables with median 
and interquartile range (IQR).
RESULTS: From the 302 identified studies, 83 satisfied the inclusion criteria. 
Studies were categorized to oncology (26.5%) and a nononcology related (73.5%) 
based on drug treatment. The most frequently reported outcome associated with CE 
threshold was the "per quality-adjusted life-year gained." A total of 32.5% of 
the studies with a reported threshold did not specify the origin of the 
threshold. From the rest of studies, the vast majority (92.8%) adopted 
thresholds equal to 1 to 3 times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, 
whereas the rest similar to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
guidelines. The median CE threshold was differentiated between oncology (€51 000 
[IQR €50 000-€60 000]) and nononcology studies (€34 000 [IQR €30 000-€36 000]; P 
< .001). In both type of studies, the median CE thresholds were not 
statistically significantly different among GDP, National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence, and not specified approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Aligned with other countries where there is no standard CE 
threshold to promote efficient use of healthcare resources, the most prominent 
practice in Greece was found to be that of 1 to 3 times the GDP per capita 
irrespective of type of treatment or outcome studied.

The impact of different types of NHS expenditure on health: Marginal cost per 
QALY estimates for England for 2016/17.

English data from 2003 to 2012 suggests that it costs the NHS £10,000 to 
generate an additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY).  This estimate relates 
to all NHS expenditure and no attempt was made to explore possible heterogeneity 
within this total.  Different types of expenditure - such as secondary care, 
primary care and specialized commissioning - may have different productivities 
and estimates of these may help policymakers decide where additional investment 
is most beneficial.  We use the two-stage least squares estimator and data for 
2016 to explore the mortality response to three types of healthcare 
expenditure.  Three specifications are estimated for each type of 
expenditure: backward selection and regularized regression are used to identify 
parsimonious specifications, and a full specification with all covariates is 
also estimated.  The regression results are combined with information about 
survival and morbidity disease burden to calculate the marginal cost per QALY 
for each type of expenditure: the most conservative results suggest that this is 
about £8,000 for locally (CCG) commissioned services, while estimates for 
specialized commissioning and primary care are more uncertain.  When this 
heterogeneity is taken into account, the estimated marginal cost per QALY for 
all NHS expenditure increases slightly, from about £6,000 to £7,000.  Our 
results suggest that additional investment is likely to be most productive in 
primary care and in locally commissioned services.

New Targeted Drugs for Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Antifungals: Pharmacokinetic 
Challenges and Opportunities.

BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a life-threatening disease whose 
treatment is made difficult by a number of mutations or receptor overexpression 
in the proliferating cellular clones. Life expectancy of patients diagnosed with 
new, relapsed-refractory, or secondary AML has been improved by drugs targeted 
at such moieties. Regrettably, however, clinical use of new AML drugs is 
complicated by pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs the patient is 
exposed to.
SUMMARY: The most relevant drug-drug interactions (DDI) with clinical 
implications build on competition for or induction/inhibition of CYP3A4, which 
is a versatile metabolizer of a plethora of pharmacological agents. Here, we 
review DDI between AML drugs and the agents used to prevent or treat invasive 
fungal infections (IFI). The pathophysiology of AML, characterized by 
functionally defective white blood cells and neutropenic/immunosuppressive 
effects of concomitant induction chemotherapy, can in fact increase the risk of 
infectious complications, with IFI causing high rates of morbidity and 
mortality. Triazole antifungals, such as posaconazole, are strong inhibitors of 
CYP3A4 and may thus cause patient's overexposure to AML drugs that are 
metabolized by CYP3A4. We describe potential strategies to minimize the 
consequences of DDI between triazole antifungals and targeted therapies for AML 
and the role that collaboration between clinical pharmacologists, hematologists, 
and clinical or laboratory microbiologists may have in these settings.
KEY MESSAGES: Therapeutic drug monitoring and clinical pharmacology stewardship 
could represent two strategies that best express multidisciplinary collaboration 
for improving patient management.

Baseline and oxidatively damaged DNA in end-stage renal disease patients on 
varied hemodialysis regimens: a comet assay assessment.

Global estimates exhibit that one million people have end-stage renal disease, a 
disease-state characterized by irreversible loss of kidney structure and 
function, thus necessitating renal replacement therapy. The disease-state, 
oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, as well as the treatment procedure can 
have damaging effects on the genetic material. Therefore, the present study was 
carried out to investigate DNA damage (basal and oxidative) using the comet 
assay in peripheral blood leukocytes of patients (n = 200) with stage V Chronic 
Kidney Disease (on dialysis and those recommended but yet to initiate dialysis) 
and compare it to that in controls (n = 210). Basal DNA damage was significantly 
elevated (1.13x, p ≤ 0.001) in patients (46.23 ± 0.58% DNA in tail) compared to 
controls (40.85 ± 0.61% DNA in tail). Oxidative DNA damage was also 
significantly (p ≤ 0.001) higher in patients (9.18 ± 0.49 vs. 2.59 ± 0.19% tail 
DNA) compared to controls. Twice-a-week dialysis regimen patients had 
significantly elevated % tail DNA and Damage Index compared to the non-dialyzed 
and to the once-a-week dialysis group implying dialysis- induced mechanical 
stress and blood-dialyzer membrane interactions as probable contributors to 
elevated DNA damage. The present study with a statistically significant power 
implies higher disease-associated as well as maintenance therapy 
(hemodialysis)-induced basal and oxidatively damaged DNA, which if not repaired 
has the potential to initiate carcinogenesis. These findings mark the need for 
improvement and development of interventional therapies for delaying disease 
progression and associated co-morbidities so as to improve life expectancy of 
patients with kidney disease.

BACKGROUND: To plan social and health services, future life expectancy 
projections are needed. The aim of this study was to forecast the future life 
expectancy for mainland China and its provinces.
METHODS: Following the same approach as the Global Burden of Disease Study, we 
used the largest compiled epidemiological and demographic datasets to estimate 
age-specific mortality and evaluate population data from 1990 to 2019. A total 
of 21 life expectancy forecasting models were combined by a probabilistic 
Bayesian model to forecast the life expectancy for mainland China and its 
provinces in 2035.
FINDINGS: The projected life expectancy at birth in mainland China in 2035 is 
81·3 years (95% credible interval 79·2-85·0), and there is a high probability 
that the national goals of improving life expectancy will be achieved (79 years 
in 2030, and over 80 years in 2035). At the provincial level, women in Beijing 
have the highest projected life expectancy in 2035 with an 81% probability of 
reaching 90 years, followed by Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, which all have 
more than a 50% probability of surpassing 90 years. Men in Shanghai are 
projected to have the highest life expectancy at birth in 2035, with a 77% 
probability of life expectancy being over 83 years, the highest provincial life 
expectancy in mainland China in 2019. The projected gains in life expectancy are 
mainly derived from older individuals (aged ≥65 years), except those in 
Xinjiang, Tibet, and Qinghai (for men), in which the main contributions come 
from younger (0-29 years) or middle-aged (30-64 years) individuals.
INTERPRETATION: Life expectancy in mainland China and its provinces has a high 
probability of continuing to increase through to 2035. Adequate policy planning 
of social and health services will be needed.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate spatiotemporal variations of global 
heat-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data on the burden of heat-related CVD were derived from the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2019. Deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
were used to quantify heat-induced CVD burden. We calculated the 
age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and DALY rate (ASDR) per 100,000 
population to compare this burden across regions. Generalized linear models were 
applied to evaluate estimated annual percentage changes (EAPC) for temporal 
trends from 1990 to 2019. The correlation between the socio-demographic index 
(SDI) and age-standardized rate was measured using the Spearman rank test.
RESULTS: Heat-induced CVD caused approximately 90 thousand deaths worldwide in 
2019. Global ASMR and ASDR of heat-related CVD in 2019 were 1.17 [95% confidence 
interval ( CI): 0.13-1.98] and 25.59 (95% CI: 2.07-44.17) per 100,000 
population, respectively. The burden was significantly increased in middle and 
low-SDI regions and slightly decreased in high-SDI regions from 1990 to 2019. 
ASMR showed an upward trend, with the most considerable increase in low-latitude 
countries. We observed a negative correlation between SDI and EAPC in ASMR ( r s 
= -0.57, P < 0.01) and ASDR ( r s = -0.59, P < 0.01) among 204 countries.
CONCLUSION: Heat-attributable CVD burden substantially increased in most 
developing countries and tropical regions.

BACKGROUND: Speech disorders are common dysfunctions in patients with tongue 
squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) that can diminish their quality of life. There 
are few studies with multidimensional and longitudinal assessments of speech 
function in TSCC patients.
METHODS: This longitudinal observational study was conducted at the Hospital of 
Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University, China, from January 2018 to March 2021. A 
cohort of 92 patients (53 males, age range: 24-77 years) diagnosed with TSCC 
participated in this study. Speech function was assessed from preoperatively to 
one year postoperatively using the Speech Handicap Index questionnaire and 
acoustic parameters. The risk factors for postoperative speech disorder were 
analyzed by a linear mixed-effects model. A t test or Mann‒Whitney U test was 
applied to analyze the differences in acoustic parameters under the influence of 
risk factors to determine the pathophysiological mechanisms of speech disorders 
in patients with TSCC.
RESULTS: The incidence of preoperative speech disorders was 58.7%, which 
increased up to 91.4% after surgery. Higher T stage (P＜0.001) and larger range 
of tongue resection (P = 0.002) were risk factors for postoperative speech 
disorders. Among the acoustic parameters, F2/i/decreased remarkably with higher 
T stage (P = 0.021) and larger range of tongue resection (P = 0.009), indicating 
restricted tongue movement in the anterior-posterior direction. The acoustic 
parameters analysis during the follow-up period showed that F1 and F2 were not 
significantly different of the patients with subtotal or total glossectomy over 
time.
CONCLUSIONS: Speech disorders in TSCC patients is common and persistent. Less 
residual tongue volume led to worse speech-related QoL, indicating that 
surgically restoring the length of the tongue and strengthening tongue extension 
postoperatively may be important.

BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of lower extremities comprises a 
clinical spectrum that extends from asymptomatic patients to critical limb 
ischemia (CLI) patients. 10% to 40% of the patients are at the risk of primary 
amputation. This study was planned in "no-option" patients of CLI due to 
atherosclerotic PAD to assess the efficacy and safety of pooled, allogeneic, 
adult human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells which is already 
approved for marketing in India for CLI due to Buerger's disease.
METHODS: This was a single-arm, multi-centric, phase III study where mesenchymal 
stromal cells was injected as 2 million cells/kg body weight in the calf muscle 
and around the ulcer. Twenty-four patients of lower extremity CLI due to PAD 
with Rutherford III-5 or III-6 and ankle-brachial pressure index ≤ 0.6 and 
having have at least one ulcer with area between 0.5 and 10 cm2 were included in 
the study. These patients were evaluated over 12 months from drug 
administration.
RESULTS: Over a period of 12 months, statistical significant reduction of rest 
pain and ulcer size along with improvement in ankle-brachial pressure index and 
ankle systolic was observed. The quality of life of patients improved together 
with increase in total walking distance and major amputation-free survival time.
CONCLUSION: Mesenchymal stromal cells may be a feasible option to treat 
"no-option" patients with atherosclerotic PAD. Trial registration This study is
