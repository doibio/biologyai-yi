was similar between all filters.
CONCLUSIONS: The left vertebral artery is an important entry route for embolic 
material to the brain during TAVR. Selective filter protection of the left 
vertebral artery revealed embolic debris in all patients. The clinical value of 
complete filter-based TCEP during TAVR warrants further research.

BACKGROUND: Inherited mutations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch repair 
(MMR) genes lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), gynaecological 
cancers and other cancers, known as Lynch syndrome (LS). Risk-reducing 
interventions can be offered to individuals with known LS-causing mutations. The 
mutations can be identified by comprehensive testing of the MMR genes, but this 
would be prohibitively expensive in the general population. Tumour-based tests - 
microsatellite instability (MSI) and MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC) - are used 
in CRC patients to identify individuals at high risk of LS for genetic testing. 
MLH1 (MutL homologue 1) promoter methylation and BRAF V600E testing can be 
conducted on tumour material to rule out certain sporadic cancers.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether testing for LS in CRC patients using MSI or 
IHC (with or without MLH1 promoter methylation testing and BRAF V600E testing) 
is clinically effective (in terms of identifying Lynch syndrome and improving 
outcomes for patients) and represents a cost-effective use of NHS resources.
REVIEW METHODS: Systematic reviews were conducted of the published literature on 
diagnostic test accuracy studies of MSI and/or IHC testing for LS, end-to-end 
studies of screening for LS in CRC patients and economic evaluations of 
screening for LS in CRC patients. A model-based economic evaluation was 
conducted to extrapolate long-term outcomes from the results of the diagnostic 
test accuracy review. The model was extended from a model previously developed 
by the authors.
RESULTS: Ten studies were identified that evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy 
of MSI and/or IHC testing for identifying LS in CRC patients. For MSI testing, 
sensitivity ranged from 66.7% to 100.0% and specificity ranged from 61.1% to 
92.5%. For IHC, sensitivity ranged from 80.8% to 100.0% and specificity ranged 
from 80.5% to 91.9%. When tumours showing low levels of MSI were treated as a 
positive result, the sensitivity of MSI testing increased but specificity fell. 
No end-to-end studies of screening for LS in CRC patients were identified. Nine 
economic evaluations of screening for LS in CRC were identified. None of the 
included studies fully matched the decision problem and hence a new economic 
evaluation was required. The base-case results in the economic evaluation 
suggest that screening for LS in CRC patients using IHC, BRAF V600E and MLH1 
promoter methylation testing would be cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
for this strategy was £11,008 per QALY compared with no screening. Screening 
without tumour tests is not predicted to be cost-effective.
LIMITATIONS: Most of the diagnostic test accuracy studies identified were rated 
as having a risk of bias or were conducted in unrepresentative samples. There 
was no direct evidence that screening improves long-term outcomes. No 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted.
CONCLUSIONS: Systematic review evidence suggests that MSI- and IHC-based testing 
can be used to identify LS in CRC patients, although there was heterogeneity in 
the methods used in the studies identified and the results of the studies. There 
was no high-quality empirical evidence that screening improves long-term 
outcomes and so an evidence linkage approach using modelling was necessary. Key 
determinants of whether or not screening is cost-effective are the accuracy of 
tumour-based tests, CRC risk without surveillance, the number of relatives 
identified for cascade testing, colonoscopic surveillance effectiveness and the 
acceptance of genetic testing. Future work should investigate screening for more 
causes of hereditary CRC and screening for LS in endometrial cancer patients.

This study proposes a quantitative and qualitative comparison of two popular 
metrics used for time-dependent density functional simulations of chromophores 
when describing absorption and emission processes, with high discrimination 
power between short- and long-range character of involved electronic excitations 
and functional performances. To this end, a total of 160 absorption and emission 
electronic excitations of 80 molecular systems belonging to the "Real-Life 
Molecules" data set, recently introduced in literature, have been considered a 
relevant data set. The two selected indexes are based on density (the DCT one) 
and natural transition orbitals (the ΔrNTO one), respectively. For comparison 
purposes, an extension of the DCT index, in line with what exists for ΔrNTO, 
enabling to discriminate electronic transitions occurring in symmetric systems 
is also proposed. The results show that, independently of the exchange and 
correlation functional used, a good correlation between the natural transition 
orbital and density based descriptors is found, thus cross validating their use 
for the quantification of a large variety of transitions in chemically relevant 
molecular systems.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable, progressive neurological 
condition, with symptoms impacting movement, walking, and posture that 
eventually become severely disabling. Advanced PD (aPD) has a significant impact 
on quality-of-life (QoL) for patients and their caregivers/families. 
Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is indicated for the treatment of 
advanced levodopa-responsive PD with severe motor fluctuations and 
hyper-/dyskinesia when available combinations of therapy have not given 
satisfactory results.
AIMS: To determine the cost-effectiveness of LCIG vs standard of care (SoC) for 
the treatment of aPD patients.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate LCIG vs SoC in a hypothetical 
cohort of 100 aPD patients with severe motor fluctuations from an Irish 
healthcare perspective. Model health states were defined by Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) 
scale-combined with amount of time in OFF-time-and death. SoC comprised of 
standard oral therapy ± subcutaneous apomorphine infusion and standard follow-up 
visits. Clinical efficacy, utilities, and transition probabilities were derived 
from published studies. Resource use was estimated from individual patient-level 
data from Adelphi 2012 UK dataset, using Irish costs, where possible. Time 
horizon was 20 years. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 4%. Both one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for LCIG vs SOC was 
€26,944/quality adjusted life year (QALY) (total costs and QALYs for LCIG vs 
SoC: €537,687 vs €514,037 and 4.37 vs 3.49, respectively). LCIG is 
cost-effective at a payer threshold of €45,000. The model was most sensitive to 
health state costs.
CONCLUSION: LCIG is a cost-effective treatment option compared with SoC in 
patients with aPD.

BACKGROUND: Differences in cancer survival exist across socio-economic groups 
for many cancer types. Standard metrics fail to show the overall impact for 
patients and the population.
METHODS: The available data consist of a population of ∼2.5 million patients and 
include all patients recorded as being diagnosed with melanoma, prostate, 
bladder, breast, colon, rectum, lung, ovarian and stomach cancers in England 
between 1998 and 2013. We estimated the average loss in expectation of life per 
patient in years and the proportion of life lost for a range of cancer types, 
separately by deprivation group. In addition, estimates for the total number of 
years lost due to each cancer were also obtained.
RESULTS: Lung and stomach cancers result in the highest overall loss for males 
and females in all deprivation groups in terms of both absolute life years lost 
and loss as a proportion of expected life remaining. Female lung cancer patients 
in the least- and most-deprived group lose 14.4 and 13.8 years on average, 
respectively, that is translated as 86.1% and 87.3% of their average expected 
life years remaining. Melanoma, prostate and breast cancers have the lowest 
overall loss. On the basis of the number of patients diagnosed in 2013, lung 
cancer results in the most life years lost in total followed by breast cancer. 
Melanoma and bladder cancer account for the lowest total life years lost.
CONCLUSIONS: There are wide differences in the impact of cancer on life 
expectancy across deprivation groups, and for most cancers the most affluent 
lose less years.

STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of intradiscal electrothermal 
therapy (IDET) relative to circumferential lumbar fusion with femoral ring 
allograft (FRA) in the United Kingdom.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Circumferential lumbar fusion is an established 
treatment for discogenic low back pain. However, IDET could be a cost-effective 
treatment alternative as it can be carried out as a day case.
METHODS: Patient-level data were available for patients with discogenic low back 
pain treated with FRA (n = 37) in a randomized trial of FRA vs. titanium cage, 
and for patients recruited to a separate study evaluating the use of IDET 
(n = 85). Both studies were carried out at a single institution in the United 
Kingdom. Patients were followed-up for 24 months, with data collected on low 
back disability (Oswestry Disability Index), back and leg pain (visual analog 
scale), quality of life (Short Form 36), radiographic evaluations, and U.K. 
National Health Service (NHS) resource use. Cost-effectiveness was measured by 
the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Both treatments produced statistically significant improvements in 
outcome at 24-month follow-up. NHS costs were significantly lower with IDET due 
to a shorter mean procedure time (377.4 minutes vs. 49.9 minutes) and length of 
stay (7 days vs. 1.2 days). At a threshold of £20,000 per QALY, the probability 
that IDET is cost effective is high.
CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments led to significant improvements in patient outcomes 
that were sustained for at least 24 months. Costs were lower with IDET, and for 
appropriate patients IDET is an effective and cost-effective treatment 
alternative.

BACKGROUND: Improvement in social functioning is important for recovery in first 
episode psychosis (FEP).
METHODOLOGY: 51 individuals diagnosed with first episode psychosis were assessed 
for social functioning at baseline and one year follow-up.
RESULTS: Significant improvement was seen in certain domains of social 
functioning measured by LSP scale such as communication and non-turbulence while 
no significant changes were observed in self-care and social contact.
CONCLUSION: At one year follow-up, partial improvement in social functioning is 
observed in individuals with first episode psychosis. This warrants inclusion of 
specific interventions to improve social functioning in the management plan of 
individuals with FEP.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate temporal trends in the incidence, mortality, 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and costs of health loss caused by 
serious road traffic injury.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective review of data from the 
population-based Victorian State Trauma Registry and the National Coronial 
Information System on road traffic-related deaths (pre- and in-hospital) and 
major trauma (Injury Severity Score > 12) during 2007-2015.Main outcomes and 
measures: Temporal trends in the incidence of road traffic-related major trauma, 
mortality, DALYs, and costs of health loss, by road user type.
RESULTS: There were 8066 hospitalised road traffic major trauma cases and 2588 
road traffic fatalities in Victoria over the 9-year study period. There was no 
change in the incidence of hospitalised major trauma for motor vehicle occupants 
(incidence rate ratio [IRR] per year, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.01; P = 0.70), 
motorcyclists (IRR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97-1.01; P = 0.45) or pedestrians (IRR, 
1.00; 95% CI, 0.97-1.02; P = 0.73), but the incidence for pedal cyclists 
increased 8% per year (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI; 1.05-1.10; P < 0.001). While DALYs 
declined for motor vehicle occupants (by 13% between 2007 and 2015), 
motorcyclists (32%), and pedestrians (5%), there was a 56% increase in DALYs for 
pedal cyclists. The estimated costs of health loss associated with road traffic 
injuries exceeded $14 billion during 2007-2015, although the cost per patient 
declined for all road user groups.
CONCLUSIONS: As serious injury rates have not declined, current road safety 
targets will be difficult to meet. Greater attention to preventing serious 
injury is needed, as is further investment in road safety, particularly for 
pedal cyclists.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this paper is to analyse the utilization of formal 
and informal home care among older patients with cancer (OCP) and to compare 
this with middle-aged patients with cancer (MCP) and older patients without 
cancer (ONC). Additionally, we examined predictors of transitions towards formal 
care one year after a cancer diagnosis.
METHODS: OCP and MCP had to be recruited within three months after a cancer 
diagnosis and have an estimated life expectancy over six months. ONC consisted 
of patients without known cancer, seen by the general practitioner. Formal and 
informal care were compared between the patient groups at baseline, i.e. shortly 
after a cancer diagnosis and changes in care were studied after one year.
RESULTS: A total of 844 patients were evaluable for formal care at baseline and 
469 patients (56%) at follow-up. At baseline, about half of older adults and 18% 
of MCP used formal care, while about 85% of cancer patients and 57% ONC used 
informal care. Formal care increased for all groups after one year though not 
significantly in OCP. The amount of informal care only changed in MCP which 
decreased after one year. Cancer-related factors and changes in need factors 
predict a transition towards formal care after a cancer diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: A cancer diagnosis has a different impact on the use of formal and 
informal care than ageing as such. The first year after a cancer diagnosis is an 
important time to follow-up on the patients' needs for home care.

Chlorogenic acid, a major polyphenol in edible plants, possesses strong 
antioxidant activity, anti-lipid peroxidation and anticancer effects. It used 
for industrial applications; however, this is limited by its instability to heat 
or light. In this study, we for the first time synthesized chlorogenic acid 
glucoside (CHG) via transglycosylation using dextransucrase from Leuconostoc 
mesenteroides and sucrose. CHG was purified and its structure determined by 
nuclear magnetic resonance and matrix-associated laser desorption 
ionization-time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. The production yield of CHG was 
44.0% or 141mM, as determined by response surface methodology. CHG possessed a 
65% increased water solubility and 2-fold browning resistance while it displayed 
stronger inhibition of lipid peroxidation and of colon cancer cell growth by MTT 
assay, compared to chlorogenic acid. Therefore, this study may expand the 
industrial applications of chlorogenic acid as water-soluble or browning 
resistant compound (CHG) through enzymatic glycosylation.

Enhancing Seasonal Influenza Surveillance: Topic Analysis of Widely Used 
Medicinal Drugs Using Twitter Data.

BACKGROUND: Uptake of medicinal drugs (preventive or treatment) is among the 
approaches used to control disease outbreaks, and therefore, it is of vital 
importance to be aware of the counts or frequencies of most commonly used drugs 
and trending topics about these drugs from consumers for successful 
implementation of control measures. Traditional survey methods would have 
accomplished this study, but they are too costly in terms of resources needed, 
and they are subject to social desirability bias for topics discovery. Hence, 
there is a need to use alternative efficient means such as Twitter data and 
machine learning (ML) techniques.
OBJECTIVE: Using Twitter data, the aim of the study was to (1) provide a 
methodological extension for efficiently extracting widely consumed drugs during 
seasonal influenza and (2) extract topics from the tweets of these drugs and to 
infer how the insights provided by these topics can enhance seasonal influenza 
surveillance.
METHODS: From tweets collected during the 2012-13 flu season, we first 
identified tweets with mentions of drugs and then constructed an ML classifier 
using dependency words as features. The classifier was used to extract tweets 
that evidenced consumption of drugs, out of which we identified the mostly 
consumed drugs. Finally, we extracted trending topics from each of these widely 
used drugs' tweets using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
RESULTS: Our proposed classifier obtained an F1 score of 0.82, which 
significantly outperformed the two benchmark classifiers (ie, P<.001 with the 
lexicon-based and P=.048 with the 1-gram term frequency [TF]). The classifier 
extracted 40,428 tweets that evidenced consumption of drugs out of 50,828 tweets 
with mentions of drugs. The most widely consumed drugs were influenza virus 
vaccines that had around 76.95% (31,111/40,428) share of the total; other 
notable drugs were Theraflu, DayQuil, NyQuil, vitamins, acetaminophen, and 
oseltamivir. The topics of each of these drugs exhibited common themes or 
experiences from people who have consumed these drugs. Among these were the 
enabling and deterrent factors to influenza drugs uptake, which are keys to 
mitigating the severity of seasonal influenza outbreaks.
CONCLUSIONS: The study results showed the feasibility of using tweets of widely 
consumed drugs to enhance seasonal influenza surveillance in lieu of the 
traditional or conventional surveillance approaches. Public health officials and 
other stakeholders can benefit from the findings of this study, especially in 
enhancing strategies for mitigating the severity of seasonal influenza 
outbreaks. The proposed methods can be extended to the outbreaks of other 
diseases.

University, Beijing, China.

INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have shown that deep anaesthesia is associated with 
poor outcomes. However, no randomised controlled trials have been conducted to 
test the causality in patients undergoing brain tumour resection.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: DEPTH is a multicenter, randomised, parallel-group, blind 
trial. The depth of general anaesthesia will be monitored using the bispectral 
index (BIS). Patients elected for supratentorial tumour resection will be 
randomly allocated to the deep or the light anaesthesia group in which the 
target BIS value is 35 or 50, respectively. BIS will be maintained at the target 
value for more than 90% of the total anaesthesia period. The primary outcome is 
the disability-free survival rate at postoperative 30 days and 1 year. The 
secondary outcomes are the mortality and morbidity within 30 days after surgery.
ETHICS APPROVAL AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by the 
Medical Ethics Committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medicine 
University. The reference number is KY2016-059-02. The results of this study 
will be disseminated through presentations at scientific conferences and 
publication in scientific journals.

INTRODUCTION: In the European Union three different health systems could be 
defined according to service delivery, financing, and economic policies: 
Beveridge, Bismarck and Mixed system. Although health systems are hardly to 
compare, various organizations are developing methods assessing performance. In 
the present work the performance of the three systems were evaluated using 
European Community Health Indicators according to Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development.
METHODS: The study has been conducted among the 28 states of the European Union 
using the following indicators: Standardized death rate for diseases of the 
circulatory system, standardized death rate of malignant neoplasms, road traffic 
accidents with injury, life expectancy at birth, incidence of Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), infant deaths, pure alcohol consumption, infants 
vaccinated against Diphtheria Tetanus Pertussis (DTP), public and total 
expenditure on health over the period 2001-2010.
RESULTS: The variation of health indicators over the observational time shows 
similar trend of circulatory system diseases and malignant neoplasms death 
rates, road accidents with injury, infant deaths, life expectancy at birth, 
public and total health expenditure. Some differences in the trend of HIV 
incidence, alcohol intake and DTP vaccination rates arise among systems. 
Grouping countries by health system paradigm and geographical area, resulted in 
a relevant heterogeneity (I2 ≥ 90%, Pvalue < 0.0001). No clear superiority of a 
given health delivery system was found with respect to other paradigms.
CONCLUSIONS: In accordance with the evidence of our study, it can be stated that 
best performances are more likely to be linked to country specific economic 
factors. In conclusion, it was not possible to identify the best health system 
model.

In an endeavor to search for affordable and safer therapeutics against 
debilitating visceral leishmaniasis, we examined antileishmanial potential of 
ammonium trichloro [1,2-ethanediolato-O,O']-tellurate (AS101); a tellurium based 
non toxic immunomodulator. AS101 showed significant in vitro efficacy against 
both Leishmania donovani promastigotes and amastigotes at sub-micromolar 
concentrations. AS101 could also completely eliminate organ parasite load from 
L. donovani infected Balb/c mice along with significant efficacy against 
infected hamsters (˃93% inhibition). Analyzing mechanistic details revealed that 
the double edged AS101 could directly induce apoptosis in promastigotes along 
with indirectly activating host by reversing T-cell anergy to protective Th1 
mode, increased ROS generation and anti-leishmanial IgG production. AS101 could 
inhibit IL-10/STAT3 pathway in L. donovani infected macrophages via blocking 
α4β7 integrin dependent PI3K/Akt signaling and activate host MAPKs and NF-κB for 
Th1 response. In silico docking and biochemical assays revealed AS101's affinity 
to form thiol bond with cysteine residues of trypanothione reductase in 
Leishmania promastigotes leading to its inactivation and inducing ROS-mediated 
apoptosis of the parasite via increased Ca2+ level, loss of ATP and 
mitochondrial membrane potential along with metacaspase activation. Our findings 
provide the first evidence for the mechanism of action of AS101 with excellent 
safety profile and suggest its promising therapeutic potential against 
experimental visceral leishmaniasis.

Early growth conditions can have profound impacts on individuals' development, 
growth and physiology, with subsequent long-term consequences for individuals' 
fitness and life expectancy. Telomere length (TL) has been suggested to indicate 
both individual fitness and life expectancy in wide range of species, as the 
telomere attrition rate at early age can be accelerated due to exposure to 
various stressors, including parasites and inflammatory diseases, which increase 
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and influence antioxidant (AO) 
levels. We investigated impacts of Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae infection, a 
causative agent of proliferative kidney disease (PKD), on AO status and TL in a 
natural population of juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta). The fish with higher 
parasite load showed more severe kidney hyperplasia, anemia and smaller body 
size compared to less parasitized fish. Furthermore, fish with severe PKD 
symptoms had lower SOD-, CAT- and GST activity than fish with milder kidney 
hyperplasia. However, parasite load was not directly correlated either with AOs 
or with TL. Smaller fish showed shorter TLs, potentially reflecting lower 
individual quality. The fish, which were less sensitive to parasite-induced 
impaired growth, quantified as parasite load-adjusted fork length, showed also 
longer TLs, lower GR- and GST activity and less GSHtot compared to more 
sensitive fish. These results provide novel knowledge about the impacts of the 
PKD in brown trout at the molecular level and support the idea that TL may 
reflect individual quality and ability to cope with parasitic infections.

PURPOSE: Corticoid-induced osteonecrosis (ON) of femoral head can lead to severe 
hip joint impairment and hip replacement, with negative impact in young 
survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with long life expectancy. We 
aim to improve quality of life in these patients with a novel approach.
METHODS/PATIENTS: Based on the regenerative capacities of mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs), we performed locally implanted autologous cell therapy in two 
adolescents suffering of bilateral femoral ON. This required a simple, minimally 
invasive surgical procedure.
RESULTS: Both patients experienced significant pain relief and restoration of 
gait kinematic values. Radiographic evaluation showed cessation of hip collapse. 
No toxicities/complications were observed after a 4-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that autologous MSCs can be 
considered as a novel treatment for children and young adults with ON after 
overcoming ALL. It may avoid hip replacement and improve quality of life of 
leukaemia survivors.

BACKGROUND: In adulthood, depression is the most common type of mental illness 
and will be the second leading cause of disease by 2020. Major depression 
dramatically affects the function of the central nervous system and degrades the 
quality of life, especially in old age. Several mechanisms underlie the 
pathophysiology of depressive illness, since it has a multifactorial etiology. 
Human and animal studies have demonstrated that depression is mainly associated 
with imbalances in neurotransmitters and neurotrophins, 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis alterations, brain volume changes, 
neurogenesis dysfunction, and dysregulation of inflammatory pathways. Also the 
gut microbiota may influence mental health outcomes. Although depression is not 
a consequence of normal aging, depressive disorders are common in later life, 
even if often undiagnosed or mis-diagnosed in old age. When untreated, 
depression reduces life expectancy, worsens medical illnesses, enhances health 
care costs and is the primary cause of suicide among older people. To date, the 
underpinnings of depression in the elderly are still to be understood, and the 
pharmacological treatment is the most commonly used therapy.
OBJECTIVE: Since a sedentary lifestyle and poor eating habits have recently 
emerged as crucial contributors to the genesis and course of depression, in the 
present review, we have focused on the effects of physical activity and omega-3 
fatty acids on depressive illness in the elderly.
RESULTS: A growing literature indicates that both exercise and dietary 
interventions can promote mental health throughout one's lifespan.
CONCLUSION: There thus emerges the awareness that an active lifestyle and a 
balanced diet may constitute valid low-cost prevention strategies to counteract 
depressive illness in the elderly.

[Procurement of medical devices based on cost-effectiveness data.].

Toscana, Firenze.

The field of medical devices is characterized by a paucity of cost-effectiveness 
data that support their use. In this context, we have proposed a project based 
on the calculation of net monetary benefit (NMB) for each product subjected to 
procurement through tenders. This project consists of two steps: 1) calculation 
of NMB; 2) calculation of a value-based score to be used in the process of 
procurement and tendering. The NMB is defined as follows: NMB per patient= 
(monetary threshold of WTP) x (QALYs per patient) - (treatment cost per 
patient); WTP= willingness to pay]. Its main advantage is represented by the 
linear relation between NMB and unit price as opposed to the non-linear 
relationship that links the ICER to the unit price of the device. For all 
devices included in the same tender lot, our procedure firstly determines the 
valus of NMB and converts the NMB into a tender score determined on a 0-to-100 
scale. The device with the worst pharmacoeconomic profile is assigned a tender 
score of 0 while the one with the best pharmacoeconomic profile is assigned a 
tender score of 100.

OBJECTIVE: The School-based Education Program to Reduce Salt Intake in Children 
and Their Families study was a cluster randomized control trial among grade five 
students in 28 primary schools and their families in Changzhi, China. It 
achieved a significant effect in lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in all 
family adults by 2.3 mmHg and in elderlies (aged > = 60 years) by 9.5 mmHg. The 
aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of this salt reduction 
program.
METHODS: Costs of the intervention were assessed using an ingredients approach 
to identify resource use. A trial-based incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) was estimated based on the observed effectiveness in lowering SBP. A 
Markov model was used to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of the 
intervention, and then based on population data, extrapolated to a scenario 
where the program is scaled up nationwide. Findings were presented in terms of 
an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The perspective was 
that of the health sector.
RESULTS: The intervention cost Int$19.04 per family and yielded an ICER of 
Int$2.74 (90% CI: 1.17-12.30) per mmHg reduction of SBP in all participants 
(combining children and adult participants together) compared with control 
group. If scaled up nationwide for 10 years and assumed deterioration in 
treatment effect of 50% over this period, it would reach 165 million families 
and estimated to avert 42,720 acute myocardial infarction deaths and 107,512 
stroke deaths in China. This would represent a gain of 635,816 QALYs over 
10-year time frame, translating into Int$1,358 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Based on WHO-CHOICE criteria, our analysis demonstrated that the 
proposed salt reduction strategy is highly cost-effective, and if scaled up 
nationwide, the benefits could be substantial.

OBJECTIVES: It is disputed whether arthroscopic meniscectomy is an (cost-) 
effective treatment for degenerative meniscus tears in day-to-day clinical 
practice. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
arthroscopic meniscectomy in subjects with knee osteoarthritis, in routine 
clinical practice, while taking into account the increased risk for future knee 
replacement surgery. We compared cost-effectiveness of arthroscopic meniscectomy 
compared to no surgery.
DESIGN: We used a state transition (Markov) simulation model to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of arthroscopic meniscectomy compared to no surgery in 
subjects with knee osteoarthritis (age range 45-79 years). Data used in the 
preparation of the current study were obtained from the Osteoarthritis 
Initiative (AOI) database. We applied a 9 years' time horizon (which is equal to 
the current OAI study follow up period), and evaluated cost-effectiveness from a 
societal perspective. The main outcome measure was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (Euros per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained).
RESULTS: Arthroscopic meniscectomy was associated with 8.09 (SD ± 0.07) QALYs at 
a cost of € 21,345 (SD ± 841), whereas the no surgery was associated with 8.05 
(SD ± 0.07) QALYs at a cost of € 16,284 (SD ± 855). For arthroscopic 
meniscectomy, the incremental cost per QALY gained was € 150,754.
CONCLUSIONS: In day-to-day clinical practice, arthroscopic meniscectomy in 
subjects with knee osteoarthritis is associated with € 150,754 per QALY gained, 
which exceeds the generally accepted willingness to pay (WTP) (range € 20,000-€ 
80,000).
