RESULTS: Fifty patients with sellar tumors were enrolled. The mean age of 
patients in this study was 46.15 years. The minimum age was 18 years and the 
maximum was 75 years. Of the 50 patients in the study, 18 were female and 32 
were male. Eleven patients had more than one presenting complaint. Loss of 
vision was the commonest and altered sensorium was the rarest symptom.
CONCLUSION: Superior turbinectomy is a viable option to gain wider access to 
sella without affecting the sinonasal function, quality of life, and olfaction. 
There was doubtful presence of olfactory neurons in superior turbinate. The 
extent of tumor resection and postoperative complications were unaffected and 
statistically nonsignificant in both the groups.

OBJECTIVE: Accurate determination of life expectancy becomes very important when 
determining the treatment of patients with pathologic fractures. We aimed to 
investigate the predictive role of the PATHFx model in Turkish patients by 
estimating the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic 
(ROC) and externally validating the results of PATHFx on the Turkish population.
METHODS: The data of 122 patients who presented to one of four orthopaedic 
oncology referral centres in Istanbul (2010-2017) and underwent surgical 
management of pathologic fractures were retrospectively collected. Patients were 
evaluated according to age, sex, type of pathologic fracture, presence of organ 
metastasis, presence of lymph node metastasis, haemoglobin concentration at 
presentation, primary oncologic diagnosis, number of bone metastases, and 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status. Estimations of the PATHFx 
program by months were statistically evaluated using ROC analysis.
RESULTS: In our study population (122 patients), all survived the first month, 
102 survived the third month, 89 were alive at 6 months, and 58 patients 
survived at 12 months. At 18 and 24 months, 39 and 27 patients were alive, 
respectively. The AUC value was 0.677 at 3 months, 0.695 at 6 months, 0.69 at 12 
months, 0.674 at 18 months, and 0.693 at 24 months. The 3-, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 
24-month survival rates were statistically significant (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05). 
ECOG performance status was 0-2 points in 33 patients (Memorial Sloan-Kettering 
Cancer Center (MSKCC) data set: 93 cases, our data set: 33 cases). ECOG 
performance status was 3-4 points in 89 patients (MSKCC data set: 96 cases, our 
data set: 89 cases).
CONCLUSIONS: The objective data used by PATHFx for prediction provided 
statistically accurate estimates on Turkish patients, who are presumed to have 
mixed genomes through history from both Europe and Asia, and demonstrates its 
applicability to the Turkish population.

Medicine., Cleveland, Ohio, USA.

As the baby boomer cohort ages, they have an ever-increasing number of 
comorbidities and associated poly-pharmaceutical treatment needs. The challenge 
for healthcare providers is to stay current of advancements in providing for 
this aging population. Baby boomers can expect a longer life expectancy than any 
previous generation. Yet, longevity has not correlated with better health. This 
cohort is noted for being goal driven and more self-assured than younger 
generations. They are resourceful and will often attempt to fix things 
themselves, including their healthcare. They believe hard work deserves 
justifiable rewards and relaxation. These beliefs have resulted in baby boomers 
utilizing more alcohol and illicit drugs. Altogether this means today's 
healthcare providers must be aware of potential interactions from the 
polypharmacy of prescribed medication, and they must include and understand 
additional complications associated with supplemental medications and illegal 
drugs.

Over the past two decades, numerous studies have linked the subjective 
experience of neighborhood disorder (perceptions of crime, dilapidation and 
ambient strains) with poorer health. We test whether religious struggles 
(religious doubts and feeling abandoned or punished by God) mediate this 
association. Our counterfactual mediation analyses of data from the 2021 Crime, 
Health, and Politics Survey (CHAPS) (n = 1741) revealed consistent indirect 
effects of neighborhood disorder through religious struggles for anger, 
psychological distress, sleep disturbance, poorer self-rated health, and shorter 
subjective life expectancy. This study contributes to previous work by 
integrating the study of neighborhood context and religion.

Evolution within the body: the rise and fall of somatic Darwinism in the late 
nineteenth century.

Originating in the work of Ernst Haeckel and Wilhelm Preyer, and advanced by a 
Prussian embryologist, Wilhelm Roux, the idea of struggle for existence between 
body parts helped to establish a framework, in which population cell dynamics 
rather than a predefined harmony guides adaptive changes in an organism. 
Intended to provide a causal-mechanical view of functional adjustments in body 
parts, this framework was also embraced later by early pioneers of immunology to 
address the question of vaccine effectiveness and pathogen resistance. As an 
extension of these early efforts, Elie Metchnikoff established an evolutionary 
vision of immunity, development, pathology, and senescence, in which 
phagocyte-driven selection and struggle promote adaptive changes in an organism. 
Despite its promising start, the idea of somatic evolution lost its appeal at 
the turn of the twentieth century giving way to a vision, in which an organism 
operates as a genetically uniform, harmonious entity.

Down Syndrome for the Otolaryngologist: A Review.

Zalzal HG(1), Lawlor CM(1).

Author information:

DC.

IMPORTANCE: There are many features of Down syndrome that prompt referral to an 
otolaryngologist. As the lifetime prevalence and life expectancy of individuals 
with Down syndrome increase, it is increasingly likely that otolaryngologists 
will have the opportunity to care for patients with Down syndrome.
OBSERVATIONS: A confluence of characteristics common to Down syndrome may be 
associated with issues in the head and neck, from infancy through adulthood. 
Hearing concerns range from narrow ear canals and cerumen impactions to 
eustachian tube dysfunction, middle ear effusion, cochlear malformations, and 
conductive, sensorineural, and/or mixed hearing loss. Immune deficiency, 
hypertrophy of Waldeyer ring, and hypoplastic sinuses may complicate and develop 
into chronic rhinosinusitis. Speech delay, obstructive sleep apnea, dysphagia, 
and airway anomalies are also common among this patient population. Because 
these concerns may necessitate otolaryngologic surgery, it is vital for 
otolaryngologists to familiarize themselves with anesthetic concerns, including 
cervical spine instability, in patients with Down syndrome. Comorbid cardiac 
disease, hypothyroidism, and obesity may also affect these patients and 
otolaryngologic care.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Individuals with Down syndrome may visit 
otolaryngology practices at all ages. Otolaryngologists that familiarize 
themselves with the head and neck manifestations that are common among patients 
with Down syndrome and know when to order screening tests will be able to 
provide comprehensive care.

10-year follow-up study on medical expenses and medical care use according to 
biological age: National Health Insurance Service Health Screening Cohort 
(NHIS-HealS 2002~2019).

Hospital, Goyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of South Korea.

OBJECTIVES: The world is witnessing a sharp increase in its elderly population, 
accelerated by longer life expectancy and lower birth rates, which in turn 
imposes enormous medical burden on society. Although numerous studies have 
predicted medical expenses based on region, gender, and chronological age (CA), 
any attempt has rarely been made to utilize biological age (BA)-an indicator of 
health and aging-to ascertain and predict factors related to medical expenses 
and medical care use. Thus, this study employs BA to predict factors that affect 
medical expenses and medical care use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Referring to the health screening cohort database of the 
National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), this study targeted 276,723 adults who 
underwent health check-ups in 2009-2010 and kept track of the data on their 
medical expenses and medical care use up to 2019. The average follow-up period 
is 9.12 years. Twelve clinical indicators were used to measure BA, while the 
total annual medical expenses, total annual number of outpatient days, total 
annual number of days in hospital, and average annual increases in medical 
expenses were used as the variables for medical expenses and medical care use. 
For statistical analysis, this study employed Pearson correlation analysis and 
multiple regression analysis.
RESULTS: Regression analysis of the differences between corrected biological age 
(cBA) and CA exhibited statistically significant increases (p<0.05) in all the 
variables of the total annual medical expenses, total annual number of 
outpatient days, total annual number of days in hospital, and average annual 
increases in medical expenses.
CONCLUSIONS: This study quantified decreases in the variables for medical 
expenses and medical care use based on improved BA, thereby motivating people to 
become more health-conscious. In particular, this study is significant in that 
it is the first of its kind to predict medical expenses and medical care use 
through BA.

BACKGROUND: US racial-ethnic mortality disparities are well documented and 
central to debates on social inequalities in health. Standard measures, such as 
life expectancy or years of life lost, are based on synthetic populations and do 
not account for the real underlying populations experiencing the inequalities.
METHODS: We analyze US mortality disparities comparing Asian Americans, Blacks, 
Hispanics, and Native Americans/Alaska Natives to Whites using 2019 CDC and NCHS 
data, using a novel approach that estimates the mortality gap, adjusted for 
population structure by accounting for real-population exposures. This measure 
is tailored for analyses where age structures are fundamental, not merely a 
confounder. We highlight the magnitude of inequalities by comparing the 
population structure-adjusted mortality gap against standard metrics' estimates 
of loss of life due to leading causes.
RESULTS: Based on the population structure-adjusted mortality gap, Black and 
Native American mortality disadvantage exceedsmortality from circulatory 
diseases. The disadvantage is 72% among Blacks (men: 47%, women: 98%) and 65% 
among Native Americans (men: 45%, women: 92%), larger than life expectancy 
measured disadvantage. In contrast, estimated advantages for Asian Americans are 
over three times (men: 176%, women: 283%) and, for Hispanics, two times (men: 
123%; women: 190%) larger than those based on life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality inequalities based on standard metrics' synthetic 
populations can differ markedly from estimates of the population 
structure-adjusted mortality gap. We demonstrate that standard metrics 
underestimate racial-ethnic disparities through disregarding actual population 
age structures. Exposure-corrected measures of inequality may better inform 
health policies around allocation of scarce resources.

Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal rare disease due to a deficiency of 
α-galactosidase A activity. The accumulation of glycosphingolipids mainly 
affects the kidney, heart, and central nervous system, considerably reducing 
life expectancy. Although the accumulation of undegraded substrate is considered 
the primary cause of FD, it is established that secondary dysfunctions at the 
cellular, tissue, and organ levels ultimately give rise to the clinical 
phenotype. To parse this biological complexity, a large-scale deep plasma 
targeted proteomic profiling has been performed. We analyzed the plasma protein 
profiles of FD deeply phenotyped patients (n = 55) compared to controls (n = 30) 
using next-generation plasma proteomics including 1463 proteins. Systems biology 
and machine learning approaches have been used. The analysis enabled the 
identification of proteomic profiles that unambiguously separated FD patients 
from controls (615 differentially expressed proteins, 476 upregulated, and 139 
downregulated) and 365 proteins are newly reported. We observed functional 
remodeling of several processes, such as cytokine-mediated pathways, 
extracellular matrix, and vacuolar/lysosomal proteome. Using network strategies, 
we probed patient-specific tissue metabolic remodeling and described a robust 
predictive consensus protein signature including 17 proteins CD200, SPINT1, 
CD34, FGFR2, GRN, ERBB4, AXL, ADAM15, PTPRM, IL13RA1, NBL1, NOTCH1, VASN, ROR1, 
AMBP, CCN3, and HAVCR2. Our findings highlight the pro-inflammatory cytokines' 
involvement in FD pathogenesis along with extracellular matrix remodeling. The 
study shows a tissue-wide metabolic remodeling connection to plasma proteomics 
in FD. These results will facilitate further studies to understand the molecular 
mechanisms in FD to pave the way for better diagnostics and therapeutics.

The challenging surgical vascular access creation.

Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.

With the increasing life expectancy of patients with end-stage kidney disease, 
the creation and maintenance of hemodialysis vascular access are becoming more 
challenging. A comprehensive patient evaluation including a complete history, 
physical examination, and ultrasonographic vessel assessment is the foundation 
of the clinical evaluation. A patient-centered approach acknowledges the myriad 
of factors that impact the selection of optimal access for the distinct clinical 
and social circumstance of each patient. An interdisciplinary team approach 
involving various healthcare providers in all stages of hemodialysis access 
creation is important and associated with better outcomes. While patency is 
considered the most important parameter in most vascular reconstructive 
scenarios, the ultimate determinant of success in vascular access for 
hemodialysis is a circuit that allows consistent and uninterrupted delivery of 
the prescribed hemodialysis. The best conduit is one that is superficial, easily 
identified, straight, and of a large caliber. Individual patient factors and 
skill level of the cannulating technician also play a crucial role in the 
initial success and maintenance of vascular access. Special attention should be 
considered in dealing with more challenging groups such as the elderly 
population where the newest vascular access guidance from The National Kidney 
Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative will be transformative. 
The current guidelines recommend monitoring the vascular access by regular 
physical and clinical assessments, however, inadequate evidence is available to 
support routine ultrasonographic surveillance for improving access patency.

University, Baghdad, Iraq.

Iraq.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global disease, and the number of 
people affected is increasing due to driving factors such as diabetes, obesity, 
and hypertension, as well as increased life expectancy. Many patients with CKD 
suffer anemia throughout the period of their disease.
AIM: This research aimed to investigate the relation between resistance to the 
methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (ME-β) and angiotensin-converting 
enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism.
METHODS: Seventy Iraqi patients with CKD on hemodialysis treatment for at least 
six months and receiving a subcutaneous injection of ME-β were selected to 
enroll in this current study. In addition to these patients, the control group 
of 20 healthy subjects. Baseline samples (Three blood samples) were obtained and 
withdrawn from each participant, then 3 and 6 months following the starting 
sample. In addition, a unique blood sample was taken from each participant in 
the control group in the early morning hours following 8 h of fasting and before 
dialysis (for the patients' group).
RESULTS: ACE polymorphism did not demonstrate a significant (p ˃ 0.05) relation 
with changing the dose of ME-β. Furthermore, there was a negative relationship 
between ME-β dose and hemoglobin (Hb) in CKD patients. Comparing ACE 
polymorphism between good and hypo-response groups shows no significant effect 
(p ˃ 0.05) on ME-β therapy. Moreover, the erythropoietin resistance index (ERI) 
was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in good responders to ME-β therapy compared 
to the hypo-response group. Finally, comparing the ERI of the patient, the good 
response group to the hypo-response group showed no significant association (p ˃ 
0.05) with ACE gene polymorphism in response to ME-β therapy.
CONCLUSION: No relation was determined between the polymorphism ACE gene and the 
resistance to the ME-β administration in CKD Iraqi patients.

Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Yiwu, China.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung 
disease (ILD) without an identifiable cause. If not treated after diagnosis, the 
average life expectancy is 3-5 years. Currently approved drugs for the treatment 
of IPF are Pirfenidone and Nintedanib, as antifibrotic drugs, which can reduce 
the decline rate of forced vital capacity (FVC) and reduce the risk of acute 
exacerbation of IPF. However these drugs can not relieve the symptoms associated 
with IPF, nor improve the overall survival rate of IPF patients. We need to 
develop new, safe and effective drugs to treat pulmonary fibrosis. Previous 
studies have shown that cyclic nucleotides participate in the pathway and play 
an essential role in the process of pulmonary fibrosis. Phosphodiesterase (PDEs) 
is involved in cyclic nucleotide metabolism, so PDE inhibitors are candidates 
for pulmonary fibrosis. This paper reviews the research progress of PDE 
inhibitors related to pulmonary fibrosis, so as to provide ideas for the 
development of anti-pulmonary fibrosis drugs.

BACKGROUND: Smoking cessation rates after stroke and transient ischemic attack 
are suboptimal, and smoking cessation interventions are underutilized. We 
performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of smoking cessation interventions in 
this population.
METHODS: We constructed a decision tree and used Markov models that aimed to 
assess the cost-effectiveness of varenicline, any pharmacotherapy with intensive 
counseling, and monetary incentives, compared with brief counseling alone in the 
secondary stroke prevention setting. Payer and societal costs of interventions 
and outcomes were modeled. The outcomes were recurrent stroke, myocardial 
infarction, and death using a lifetime horizon. Estimates and variance for the 
base case (35% cessation), costs and effectiveness of interventions, and outcome 
rates were imputed from the stroke literature. We calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios and incremental net monetary benefits. An intervention 
was considered cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
less than the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) or when the incremental net monetary benefit was positive. 
Probabilistic Monte Carlo simulations modeled the impact of parameter 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: From the payer perspective, varenicline and pharmacotherapy with 
intensive counseling were associated with more QALYs (0.67 and 1.00, 
respectively) at less total lifetime costs compared with brief counseling alone. 
Monetary incentives were associated with 0.71 more QALYs at an additional cost 
of $120 compared with brief counseling alone, yielding an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $168/QALY. From the societal perspective, all 3 
interventions provided more QALYs at less total costs compared with brief 
counseling alone. In 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations, all 3 smoking cessation 
interventions were cost-effective in >89% of runs.
CONCLUSIONS: For secondary stroke prevention, it is cost-effective and 
potentially cost-saving to deliver smoking cessation therapy beyond brief 
counseling alone.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of infant universal vaccination 
against hepatitis A in Spain.
METHOD: Using a dynamic model and decision tree model, a cost-effectiveness 
analysis was performed to compare three vaccination strategies against hepatitis 
A: non-vaccination strategy versus universal childhood vaccination of hepatitis 
A with one or two doses. The perspective of the study was that of the National 
Health System (NHS) and a lifetime horizon was considered. Both costs and 
effects were discounted at 3% per year. Health outcomes were measured in terms 
of quality adjusted life years (QALY) and the cost-effectiveness measure used 
was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). In addition, deterministic 
sensitivity analysis by scenarios was performed.
RESULTS: In the particular case of Spain, with low endemicity for hepatitis A, 
the difference in health outcomes between vaccination strategies (with 1 or 2 
doses) and non-vaccination are practically non-existent, terms of QALY. In 
addition, the ICER obtained is high, exceeding the limits of willingness to pay 
from Spain (€22,000-25,000/QALY). The deterministic sensitivity analysis showed 
that the results are sensitive to the variations of the key parameters, although 
in no case the vaccination strategies are cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Universal infant vaccination strategy against hepatitis A would not 
be a cost-effective option from the NHS perspective in Spain.

BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is usually accompanied by 
metabolic syndrome, which is associated with increased risk of cancer. To inform 
a tailored cancer screen in patients at higher risks, we estimated the global 
burden of cancer attributable to metabolic risks.
METHODS: Data of common metabolism-related neoplasms (MRNs) were derived from 
the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 database. Age-standardized, 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates and death rates of patients with MRNs 
were extracted from the GBD 2019 database and stratified by metabolic risk, sex, 
age, and level of socio-demographic index (SDI). The annual percentage changes 
of age-standardized DALYs and death rates were calculated.
FINDINGS: Metabolic risks, consisting of high body mass index and fasting plasma 
glucose, contributed substantially to the burden of neoplasms, including 
colorectal cancer (CRC), tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer (TBLC), etc. 
Globally, in 2019, there was an estimated age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) of 
234 (95% confidence interval [CI] 124-376) per 100,000 person years for 
neoplasms attributable to metabolic risks. ASDRs of MRNs were higher for CRC, 
TBLC, men, patients aged ≥50 years, and patients with high or high-middle SDI.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study further underpin the correlation between 
NAFLD and intrahepatic and extrahepatic cancers and highlight the possibility of 
tailored cancer screening for the NAFLD population at higher risks.

Southeast (SE) Asia is a highly biodiverse region, yet it is also estimated to 
cumulatively contribute a third of the total global marine plastic pollution. 
This threat is known to have adverse impacts on marine megafauna, however, 
understanding of its impacts has recently been highlighted as a priority for 
research in the region. To address this knowledge gap, a structured literature 
review was conducted for species of cartilaginous fishes, marine mammals, marine 
reptiles, and seabirds present in SE Asia, collating cases on a global scale to 
allow for comparison, coupled with a regional expert elicitation to gather 
additional published and grey literature cases which would have been omitted 
during the structured literature review. Of the 380 marine megafauna species 
present in SE Asia, but also studied elsewhere, we found that 9.1 % and 4.5 % of 
all publications documenting plastic entanglement (n = 55) and ingestion 
(n = 291) were conducted in SE Asian countries. At the species level, published 
cases of entanglement from SE Asian countries were available for 10 % or less of 
species within each taxonomic group. Additionally, published ingestion cases 
were available primarily for marine mammals and were lacking entirely for 
seabirds in the region. The regional expert elicitation led to entanglement and 
ingestion cases from SE Asian countries being documented in 10 and 15 additional 
species respectively, highlighting the utility of a broader approach to data 
synthesis. While the scale of the plastic pollution in SE Asia is of particular 
concern for marine ecosystems, knowledge of its interactions and impacts on 
marine megafauna lags behind other areas of the world, even after the inclusion 
of a regional expert elicitation. Additional funding to help collate baseline 
data are critically needed to inform policy and solutions towards limiting the 
interactions of marine megafauna and plastic pollution in SE Asia.

Sexual dimorphism is a key factor to consider in the ageing process given the 
impact that it has on life expectancy. The oxidative-inflammatory theory of 
ageing states that the ageing process is the result of the establishment of 
oxidative stress which, due to the interplay of the immune system, translates 
into inflammatory stress, and that both processes are responsible for the damage 
and loss of function of an organism. We show that there are relevant gender 
differences in a number of oxidative and inflammatory markers and propose that 
they may account for the differential lifespan between sexes, given that males 
display, in general, higher oxidation and basal inflammation. In addition, we 
explain the significant role of circulating cell-free DNA as a marker of 
oxidative damage and an inductor of inflammation, connecting both processes and 
having the potential to become a useful ageing marker. Finally, we discuss how 
oxidative and inflammatory changes take place differentially with ageing in each 
sex, which could also have an impact on the sex-differential lifespan. Further 
research including sex as an essential variable is needed to understand the 
grounds of sex differences in ageing and to better comprehend ageing itself.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 3 isolated meniscal repair (IMR) 
treatment strategies: platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-augmented IMR, IMR with a 
marrow venting procedure (MVP), and IMR without biological augmentation.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the baseline case: a young 
adult patient meeting the indications for IMR. Health utility values, failure 
rates, and transition probabilities were derived from the published literature. 
Costs were determined based on the typical patient undergoing IMR at an 
outpatient surgery center. Outcome measures included costs, quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS: Total costs of IMR with an MVP were $8,250; PRP-augmented IMR, $12,031; 
and IMR without PRP or an MVP, $13,326. PRP-augmented IMR resulted in an 
additional 2.16 QALYs, whereas IMR with an MVP produced slightly fewer QALYs, at 
2.13. Non-augmented repair produced a modeled gain of 2.02 QALYs. The ICER 
comparing PRP-augmented IMR versus MVP-augmented IMR was $161,742/QALY, which 
fell well above the $50,000 willingness-to-pay threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: IMR with biological augmentation (MVP or PRP) resulted in a higher 
number of QALYs and lower costs than non-augmented IMR, suggesting that 
biological augmentation is cost-effective. Total costs of IMR with an MVP were 
significantly lower than those of PRP-augmented IMR, whereas the number of 
additional QALYs produced by PRP-augmented IMR was only slightly higher than 
that produced by IMR with an MVP. As a result, neither treatment dominated over 
the other. However, because the ICER of PRP-augmented IMR fell well above the 
$50,000 willingness-to-pay threshold, IMR with an MVP was determined to be the 
overall cost-effective treatment strategy in the setting of young adult patients 
with isolated meniscal tears.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, economic and decision analysis.

Prevention does not fit well within our problem-oriented medical paradigm in 
which the focus is on curing or ameliorating existing diseases. It is easier and 
more satisfying to solve existing problems than it is to advise and motivate 
patients to implement measures to prevent future problems that may or may not 
occur. Clinician motivation is further diminished by the time required to help 
people make lifestyle changes, the low reimbursement rate, and the fact that the 
benefits, if any, are often not apparent for years. Typical patient panel sizes 
make it difficult to provide all of the recommended disease-oriented preventive 
services and to also address the social and lifestyle factors that can impact 
future health problems. One solution to this square peg-round hole mismatch is 
to focus on the goals, life extension and prevention of future disabilities.
