IMPORTANCE: Using race and ethnicity in clinical prediction models can reduce or 
inadvertently increase racial and ethnic disparities in medical decisions.
OBJECTIVE: To compare eligibility for lung cancer screening in a contemporary 
representative US population by refitting the life-years gained from 
screening-computed tomography (LYFS-CT) model to exclude race and ethnicity vs a 
counterfactual eligibility approach that recalculates life expectancy for racial 
and ethnic minority individuals using the same covariates but substitutes White 
race and uses the higher predicted life expectancy, ensuring that historically 
underserved groups are not penalized.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The 2 submodels composing LYFS-CT NoRace were 
refit and externally validated without race and ethnicity: the lung cancer death 
submodel in participants of a large clinical trial (recruited 1993-2001; 
followed up until December 31, 2009) who ever smoked (n = 39 180) and the 
all-cause mortality submodel in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 
1997-2001 participants aged 40 to 80 years who ever smoked (n = 74 842, followed 
up until December 31, 2006). Screening eligibility was examined in NHIS 
2015-2018 participants aged 50 to 80 years who ever smoked. Data were analyzed 
from June 2021 to September 2022.
EXPOSURE: Including and removing race and ethnicity (African American, Asian 
American, Hispanic American, White) in each LYFS-CT submodel.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: By race and ethnicity: calibration of the LYFS-CT 
NoRace model and the counterfactual approach (ratio of expected to observed 
[E/O] outcomes), US individuals eligible for screening, predicted days of life 
gained from screening by LYFS-CT.
RESULTS: The NHIS 2015-2018 included 25 601 individuals aged 50 to 80 years who 
ever smoked (2769 African American, 649 Asian American, 1855 Hispanic American, 
and 20 328 White individuals). Removing race and ethnicity from the submodels 
underestimated lung cancer death risk (expected/observed [E/O], 0.72; 95% CI, 
0.52-1.00) and all-cause mortality (E/O, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94) in African 
American individuals. It also overestimated mortality in Hispanic American (E/O, 
1.08, 95% CI, 1.00-1.16) and Asian American individuals (E/O, 1.14, 95% CI, 
1.01-1.30). Consequently, the LYFS-CT NoRace model increased Hispanic American 
and Asian American eligibility by 108% and 73%, respectively, while reducing 
African American eligibility by 39%. Using LYFS-CT with the counterfactual 
all-cause mortality model better maintained calibration across groups and 
increased African American eligibility by 13% without reducing eligibility for 
Hispanic American and Asian American individuals.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, removing race and ethnicity 
miscalibrated LYFS-CT submodels and substantially reduced African American 
eligibility for lung cancer screening. Under counterfactual eligibility, no one 
became ineligible, and African American eligibility increased, demonstrating the 
potential for maintaining model accuracy while reducing disparities.

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the presence of intertissue-communication 
regulating systemic aging, but the underlying molecular network has not been 
fully explored. We and others previously showed that two basic helix-loop-helix 
transcription factors, MML-1 and HLH-30, are required for lifespan extension in 
several longevity paradigms, including germlineless Caenorhabditis elegans. 
However, it is unknown what tissues these factors target to promote longevity. 
Here, using tissue-specific knockdown experiments, we found that MML-1 and its 
heterodimer partners MXL-2 and HLH-30 act primarily in neurons to extend 
longevity in germlineless animals. Interestingly, however, the downstream 
cascades of MML-1 in neurons were distinct from those of HLH-30. Neuronal RNA 
interference (RNAi)-based transcriptome analysis revealed that the glutamate 
transporter GLT-5 is a downstream target of MML-1 but not HLH-30. Furthermore, 
the MML-1-GTL-5 axis in neurons is critical to prevent an age-dependent collapse 
of proteostasis and increased oxidative stress through autophagy and peroxidase 
MLT-7, respectively, in long-lived animals. Collectively, our study revealed 
that systemic aging is regulated by a molecular network involving neuronal MML-1 
function in both neural and peripheral tissues.

The success of the visceral leishmaniasis (VL) elimination program largely 
depends on cost-effective vector control measures. Our goal was to investigate 
the longevity of the efficacy of insecticidal wall painting (IWP), a new vector 
control tool, compared with a routine indoor residual spraying (IRS) program for 
reducing the VL vector density in Bangladesh. This study is the extension of our 
recent IWP study for VL vector management in Bangladesh, which was undertaken in 
seven highly VL endemic villages of the Mymensingh district with a 12-month 
follow-up. In this 24-months follow-up study, we collected sand flies 
additionally at 15, 18, 21, and 24 months since the interventions from the IWP 
and control (where the program did routine IRS) clusters to examine the 
longevity of the efficacy of IWP on sand fly density reduction and mortality. 
The difference-in-differences regression models were used to estimate the effect 
of IWP on sand fly reduction against Program IRS. The IWP showed excellent 
performance in reducing sand fly density and increasing sand fly mortality 
compared with Program IRS. The effect of IWP for controlling sand flies was 
statistically significant for up to at least 24 months. The mean female 
Phlebotomus argentipes density reduction ranged from -56% to -83%, and the P. 
argentipes sand fly mortality ranged from 81% to 99.5% during the 24-month 
follow-up period. Considering the duration of the efficacy of IWP for 
controlling VL vectors, Bangladesh National Kala-azar Elimination Program may 
consider IWP as the best alternative to IRS for the subsequent phases of the 
program.

Although coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery improves the life 
expectancy of patients with coronary artery disease, it is associated with 
various short and long-term complications. Early mobilization has been shown to 
reduce the risk of these complications. This study aimed to compare the 
effectiveness of different early mobilization protocols on postoperative 
cognitive dysfunction (POCD), pain intensity, and length of hospital stay (LOS) 
in patients undergoing CABG. This three-arm parallel randomized controlled trial 
included 120 patients undergoing CABG surgery who were randomly assigned to 
Intervention A, which received a four-phase early mobilization protocol; 
Intervention B, which received a three-phase early mobilization protocol; and 
the Control group, which received routine care. Postoperative cognitive 
dysfunction and pain were assessed using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
and visual analog scale (VAS), respectively. Groups were comparable in 
demographic and clinical characteristics and postoperative cognitive dysfunction 
at baseline. After the intervention, Group B had statistically significantly 
(p < 0.001) less cognitive dysfunction (25.8 ± 1.7) compared to Group A 
(24.1 ± 2.2) and the Control Group (23.4 ± 2.7). Likewise, hospital stay was 
statistically (p < 0.01) shorter for Group B (7.7 ± 1.5) than the Control group 
(8.9 ± 1.9). However, the experience of pain was statistically significantly 
lower over time in Group A than in the other groups (p < 0.001). This study 
concludes that an early mobilization protocol based on deep breathing exercises 
and chest physiotherapy may better improve postoperative cognitive dysfunction 
and length of hospital stay than an early mobilization protocol based on passive 
and active range of motion activities or routine care.

BACKGROUND: Age-related muscle decline (sarcopenia) associates with numerous 
health risk factors and poor quality of life. Drugs that counter sarcopenia 
without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing 
pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. Recent studies 
suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the efficacy of 
bisphosphonates as an anti-sarcopenic therapy is currently unclear.
METHODS: Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a sarcopenia model, we treated animals 
with 100 nM, 1, 10, 100 and 500 μM zoledronic acid (ZA) and assessed lifespan 
and healthspan (movement rates) using a microfluidic chip device. The effects of 
ZA on sarcopenia were examined using GFP-tagged myofibres or mitochondria at 
days 0, 4 and 6 post-adulthood. Mechanisms of ZA-mediated healthspan extension 
were determined using combined ZA and targeted RNAi gene knockdown across the 
life-course.
RESULTS: We found 100 nM and 1 μM ZA increased lifespan (P < 0.001) and 
healthspan [954 ± 53 (100 nM) and 963 ± 48 (1 μM) vs. 834 ± 59% (untreated) 
population activity AUC, P < 0.05]. 10 μM ZA shortened lifespan (P < 0.0001) but 
not healthspan (758.9 ± 37 vs. 834 ± 59, P > 0.05), whereas 100 and 500 μM ZA 
were larval lethal. ZA (1 μM) significantly improved myofibrillar structure on 
days 4 and 6 post-adulthood (83 and 71% well-organized myofibres, respectively, 
vs. 56 and 34% controls, P < 0.0001) and increased well-networked mitochondria 
at day 6 (47 vs. 16% in controls, P < 0.01). Genes required for ZA-mediated 
healthspan extension included fdps-1/FDPS-1 (278 ± 9 vs. 894 ± 17% population 
activity AUC in knockdown + 1 μM ZA vs. untreated controls, respectively, 
P < 0.0001), daf-16/FOXO (680 ± 16 vs. 894 ± 17%, P < 0.01) and agxt-2/BAIBA 
(531 ± 23 vs. 552 ± 8%, P > 0.05). Life/healthspan was extended through 
knockdown of igdb-1/FNDC5 (635 ± 10 vs. 523 ± 10% population activity AUC in 
gene knockdown vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01) and sir-2.3/SIRT-4 (586 ± 10 
vs. 523 ± 10%, P < 0.05), with no synergistic improvements in ZA co-treatment 
vs. knockdown alone [651 ± 12 vs. 635 ± 10% (igdb-1/FNDC5) and 583 ± 9 vs. 
586 ± 10% (sir-2.3/SIRT-4), both P > 0.05]. Conversely, let-756/FGF21 and 
sir-2.2/SIRT-4 were dispensable for ZA-induced healthspan [630 ± 6 vs. 523 ± 10% 
population activity AUC in knockdown + 1 μM ZA vs. untreated controls, P < 0.01 
(let-756/FGF21) and 568 ± 9 vs. 523 ± 10%, P < 0.05 (sir-2.2/SIRT-4)].
CONCLUSIONS: Despite lacking an endoskeleton, ZA delays Caenorhabditis elegans 
sarcopenia, which translates to improved neuromuscular function across the life 
course. Bisphosphonates might, therefore, be an immediately exploitable 
anti-sarcopenia therapy.

INTRODUCTION: The Dental Caries Utility Index (DCUI) is a new oral 
health-specific health state classification system for adolescents, consisting 
of 5 domains: pain/discomfort, difficulty eating food/drinking, worried, ability 
to participate in activities, and appearance. Each domain has 4 response levels. 
This study aims to generate an Australian-specific utility algorithm for the 
DCUI.
METHODS: An online survey was conducted using a representative sample of the 
adult Australian general population. The discrete choice experiment (DCE) was 
used to elicit the preferences on 5 domains. Then, the latent utilities were 
anchored onto the full health-dead scale using the visual analogue scale (VAS). 
DCE data were modeled using conditional logit, and 2 anchoring procedures were 
considered: anchor based on the worst health state and a mapping approach. The 
optimal anchoring procedure was selected based on the model parsimony and the 
mean absolute error (MAE).
RESULTS: A total of 995 adults from the Australian general population completed 
the survey. The conditional logit estimates on 5 dimensions and levels were 
monotonic and statistically significant, except for the second level of the 
"worried" and "appearance" domains. The mapping approach was selected based on a 
smaller MAE between the 2 anchoring procedures. The Australian-specific tariff 
of DCUI ranges from 0.1681 to 1.
CONCLUSION: This study developed a utility algorithm for the DCUI. This value 
set will facilitate utility value calculations from the participants' responses 
for DCUI in economic evaluations of dental caries interventions targeted for 
adolescents.
HIGHLIGHTS: Preference-based quality-of-life measures (PBMs), which consist of a 
health state classification system and a set of utility values (a scoring 
algorithm), are used to generate utility weights for economic evaluations.This 
study is the first to develop an Australian utility value set for the Dental 
Caries Utility Index (DCUI), a new oral health-specific classification system 
for adolescents.The availability of a utility value set will enable using DCUI 
in economic evaluations of oral health interventions targeted for adolescents 
and may ultimately lead to more effective and efficient planning of oral health 
care services.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a leading genetic cause of infant mortality. 
The advent of approved treatments for this devastating condition has 
significantly changed SMA patients' life expectancy and quality of life. 
Nevertheless, these are not without limitations, and research efforts are 
underway to develop new approaches for improved and long-lasting benefits for 
patients. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are emerging as druggable 
epigenetic targets, with several small-molecule PRMT inhibitors already in 
clinical trials. From a screen of epigenetic molecules, we have identified 
MS023, a potent and selective type I PRMT inhibitor able to promote SMN2 exon 7 
inclusion in preclinical SMA models. Treatment of SMA mice with MS023 results in 
amelioration of the disease phenotype, with strong synergistic amplification of 
the positive effect when delivered in combination with the antisense 
oligonucleotide nusinersen. Moreover, transcriptomic analysis revealed that 
MS023 treatment has minimal off-target effects, and the added benefit is mainly 
due to targeting neuroinflammation. Our study warrants further clinical 
investigation of PRMT inhibition both as a stand-alone and add-on therapy for 
SMA.

AIMS: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic 
shock (STEMICS) is associated with substantial mortality. As life expectancy 
increases, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is being performed more 
frequently, even in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 
This study sought to investigate the characteristics and impact of PCI on 
in-hospital mortality in patients with STEMICS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The Japan AMI Registry (JAMIR) is a retrospective, 
nationwide, real-world database. Among 46,242 patients with AMI hospitalized in 
2011-2016, 2,760 patients with STEMICS (median age, 72 years) were studied. We 
compared 2,396 (86.8%) patients who underwent PCI with 364 (13.2%) patients who 
did not. The percentage of mechanical circulatory support use in patients with 
STEMICS was 69.3% and in-hospital mortality was 34.6%. Compared with patients 
who did not undergo PCI, patients undergoing PCI were younger and had a higher 
rate of intra-aortic balloon pump use. A higher proportion were male or current 
smokers. In-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the PCI group than in 
the no-PCI group (31.3% vs. 56.0%, P < 0.001). PCI was independently associated 
with lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.508; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.347-0.744). In 789 (28.6%) patients aged ≥80 years, 
PCI was associated with fewer in-hospital cardiac deaths (adjusted OR, 0.524; 
95% CI, 0.281-0.975), but was not associated with in-hospital mortality 
(adjusted OR, 0.564; 95% CI, 0.300-1.050).
CONCLUSION: In Japan, PCI was effective in reducing in-hospital cardiac death in 
elderly patients with STEMICS. Age alone should not preclude potentially 
beneficial invasive therapy.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to examine temporal trends in frailty state 
transitions, and years spent frail, in older Swedish adults.
METHODS: We followed Swedish National study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen 
(SNAC-K) participants from baseline (2001-2004) for 15 (median: 9.6) years. A 
40-deficit frailty index (FI) was constructed to identify three frailty states: 
robust (FI ≤ 0.125), mild frailty (0.125 < FI ≤ 0.25), and moderate and severe 
frailty (FI > 0.25). Multi-state survival analyses were implemented to obtain 
hazard ratios for frailty state transitions, with birth year and sex as 
predictors. To examine temporal trends, frailty state-specific life expectancies 
at age 60 were forecasted for robust persons born in different years (1900, 
1910, 1920, 1930, 1940), also by sex.
RESULTS: At baseline, the 2941 participants' mean age was 75 years and 65% were 
women. Predicted life expectancy and time spent frail from age 60 followed an 
increasing trend by birth year. Hazards of transitioning from mild frailty to 
death (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-0.97) and 
moderate and severe frailty to death (HR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97-1.00) were lower 
for those born later. Women were less likely to transition from robust to mild 
frailty (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70-0.93), mild frailty to moderate and severe 
frailty (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.68-0.93), and moderate and severe frailty to death 
(HR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.59-0.78), but spent more time frail.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results point to an expansion of time spent frail among older 
Swedish adults over time.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers and is 
responsible for the second cancer-related death globally. Many treatment 
regimens have been developed to cure the disease; however, life expectancy is 
still low. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new selective, 
specific, and robust diagnosis markers for efficient early recognition of the 
ailment. Along with the diagnosis, the treatment's effectiveness can be 
determined by prognostic markers, and miRNAs are excellent tools for the 
diagnosis and prognosis of HCC. In addition, the altered expression profile of a 
few miRNAs promotes HCC cell migration and invasion, and selective up- or 
downregulation of these responsible genes may help mitigate the disorder. On one 
hand, few of the miRNAs have been found to enhance angiogenesis, a crucial step 
of tumor growth; on the other hand, upregulation of specific miRNAs is reported 
to suppress angiogenesis and resulting tumor growth of HCC cells. Exosomal 
miRNAs have significant implications in promoting angiogenesis, increased 
endothelial cell permeability, tube formation, and metastasis to hepatic and 
pulmonary tissues. miRNA also attributes to drug resistance toward chemotherapy 
and the prevention of autophagy also. Identifying novel miRNA and determining 
their differential expression in HCC tissue may serve as a potential tool for 
diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy to enhance the life expectancy and quality of 
life of HCC patients. In the present review, we have summarized the recent 
advances in HCC-related research.

Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder associated with a reduced 
fertility and decreased life expectancy, yet common predisposing variation 
substantially contributes to the onset of the disorder, which poses an 
evolutionary paradox. Previous research has suggested balanced selection, a 
mechanism by which schizophrenia risk alleles could also provide advantages 
under certain environments, as a reliable explanation. However, recent studies 
have shown strong evidence against a positive selection of predisposing loci. 
Furthermore, evolutionary pressures on schizophrenia risk alleles could have 
changed throughout human history as new environments emerged. Here in this 
study, we used 1000 Genomes Project data to explore the relationship between 
schizophrenia predisposing loci and recent natural selection (RNS) signatures 
after the human diaspora out of Africa around 100,000 years ago on a genome-wide 
scale. We found evidence for significant enrichment of RNS markers in derived 
alleles arisen during human evolution conferring protection to schizophrenia. 
Moreover, both partitioned heritability and gene set enrichment analyses of 
mapped genes from schizophrenia predisposing loci subject to RNS revealed a 
lower involvement in brain and neuronal related functions compared to those not 
subject to RNS. Taken together, our results suggest non-antagonistic pleiotropy 
as a likely mechanism behind RNS that could explain the persistence of 
schizophrenia common predisposing variation in human populations due to its 
association to other non-psychiatric phenotypes.

BACKGROUND: We investigated the application of years of life lost (YLL) in 
routine cancer statistics using cancer mortality data from 1988 to 2017.
METHODS: Cancer mortality data for 17 cancers and all cancers in the UK from 
1988 to 2017 were provided by the UK Association of Cancer Registries by sex, 
5-year age group, and year. YLL, age-standardised YLL rate (ASYR) and 
age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) were estimated.
RESULTS: The annual average YLL due to cancer, in the time periods 1988-1992 and 
2013-2017, were about 2.2 and 2.3 million years, corresponding to 4510 and 3823 
ASYR per 100,000 years, respectively. During 2013-2017, the largest number of 
YLL occurred in lung, bowel and breast cancer. YLL by age groups for all cancers 
showed a peak between 60-64 and 75-79. The relative contributions to incidence, 
mortality, and YLL differ between cancers. For instance, pancreas (in women and 
men) made up a smaller proportion of incidence (3%) but bigger proportion of 
mortality (6 and 5%) and YLL (5 and 6%), whereas prostate cancer (26% of 
incidence) contributed 13% mortality and 9% YLL.
CONCLUSION: YLL is a useful measure of the impact different cancers have on 
society and puts a higher weight on cancer deaths in younger individuals.

BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is common, but underdiagnosed, 
and few systematic early screening programs exist.
OBJECTIVE: To assess health outcomes among those with a recorded diagnosis of FH 
and potential cases of FH with no recorded diagnosis.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using the UK Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink. Records of adults were classified as diagnosed FH (FHCoded), or via 
accepted algorithms using LDL-C and clinical characteristics as potential FH 
(FHPotential) or unlikely FH (FHUnlikely) using the DLCN or EUROASPIRE criteria 
(but no record of FH). Outcomes assessed were premature cardiovascular (CV) 
events, premature deaths and life expectancy.
RESULTS: Among 1,729,046 individuals free from CV events, a record of FHCoded 
before the age of 40 was 0.3/1000 (IQR 0.3-0.4) and increased with age. Where 
LDL-C levels were available, 1.8/1000 (IQR 1.6-2.0) could be classified as 
FHPotential. LDL-C was higher for both FHCoded and FHPotential vs FHUnlikely 
(185.6 and 216.6 vs 116 mg/dL, respectively, p<0.001). Compared to FHUnlikely 
both FHCoded and FHPotential cohorts had a higher risk of premature 
cardiovascular events (both p<0.001) with highest rates among FHCoded. Risk of 
premature deaths did not differ between FHCoded and FHUnlikely, but was 1.88 
(95% CI 1.27-2.78, p = 0.002) for FHPotential vs FHCoded and 2.40 (95% CI 
1.57-3.67, p<0.001) for FHPotential vs FHUnlikely. At age 18, the FHPotential 
cohort had a life expectancy 16 years lower than the FHCoded cohort (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Potential cases of FH had a doubling in risk of premature death and 
a large reduction in life expectancy compared to individuals with a recorded 
diagnosis of FH. These findings strengthen the critical importance of 
identifying potential cases of FH early and early treatment.

BACKGROUNDS: Despite a wide spectrum of contraceptive methods for women, the 
unintended pregnancy rate remains high (45% in the US), with 50% resulting in 
abortion. Currently, 20% of global contraceptive use is male-directed, with a 
wide variation among countries due to limited availability and lack of efficacy. 
Worldwide studies indicate that >50% of men would opt to use a reversible 
method, and 90% of women would rely on their partner to use a contraceptive. 
Additional reasons for novel male contraceptive methods to be available include 
the increased life expectancy, sharing the reproductive risks among partners, 
social issues, the lack of pharma industry involvement and the lack of opinion 
makers advocating for male contraception.
AIM: The present guidelines aim to review the status regarding male 
contraception, the current state of the art to support the clinical practice, 
recommend minimal requirements for new male contraceptive development and 
provide and grade updated, evidence-based recommendations from the European 
Society of Andrology (EAA) and the American Society of Andrology (ASA).
METHODS: An expert panel of academicians appointed by the EAA and the ASA 
generated a consensus guideline according to the GRADE (Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.
RESULTS: Sixty evidence-based and graded recommendations were produced on 
couple-centered communication, behaviors, barrier methods, semen analysis and 
contraceptive efficacy, physical agents, surgical methods, actions before 
initiating male contraception, hormonal methods, non-hormonal methods, vaccines, 
and social and ethical considerations.
CONCLUSION: As gender roles transform and gender equity is established in 
relationships, the male contribution to family planning must be facilitated. 
Efficient and safe male-directed methods must be evaluated and introduced into 
clinical practice, preferably reversible, either hormonal or non-hormonal. From 
a future perspective, identifying new hormonal combinations, suitable testicular 
targets, and emerging vas occlusion methods will produce novel molecules and 
products for male contraception.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the cost utility of 
nonoperative treatment for adult spinal deformity (ASD).
METHODS: Nonoperatively and operatively treated patients who met database 
criteria for ASD and in whom complete radiographic and health-related quality of 
life data at baseline and at 2 years were available were included. A cost 
analysis was completed on the PearlDiver database assessing the average cost of 
nonoperative treatment prior to surgical intervention based on previously 
published treatments (NSAIDs, narcotics, muscle relaxants, epidural steroid 
injections, physical therapy, and chiropractor). Utility data were calculated 
using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) converted to SF-6D with published 
conversion methods. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) used a 3% discount rate 
to account for residual decline in life expectancy (78.7 years). Minor and major 
comorbidities and complications were assessed according to the CMS.gov manual's 
definitions. Successful nonoperative treatment was defined as a gain in the 
minimum clinically importance difference (MCID) in both ODI and Scoliosis 
Research Society (SRS)-pain scores, and failure was defined as a loss in MCID or 
conversion to operative treatment. Patients with baseline ODI ≤ 20 and continued 
ODI of ≤ 20 at 2 years were considered nonoperative successful maintenance. The 
average utilization of nonoperative treatment and cost were applied to the ASD 
cohort.
RESULTS: A total of 824 patients were included (mean age 58.24 years, 81% 
female, mean body mass index 27.2 kg/m2). Overall, 75.5% of patients were in the 
operative and 24.5% were in the nonoperative cohort. At baseline patients in the 
operative cohort were significantly older, had a greater body mass index, 
increased pelvic tilt, and increased pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis mismatch 
(all p < 0.05). With respect to deformity, patients in the operative group had 
higher rates of severe (i.e., ++) sagittal deformity according to SRS-Schwab 
modifiers for pelvic tilt, sagittal vertical axis, and pelvic incidence-lumbar 
lordosis mismatch (p < 0.05). At 2 years, patients in the operative cohort 
showed significantly increased rates of a gain in MCID for physical component 
summary of SF-36, ODI, and SRS-activity, SRS-pain, SRS-appearance, and 
SRS-mental scores. Cost analysis showed the average cost of nonoperative 
treatment 2 years prior to surgical intervention to be $2041. Overall, at 2 
years patients in the nonoperative cohort had again in ODI of 0.36, did not show 
a gain in QALYs, and nonoperative treatment was determined to be 
cost-ineffective. However, a subset of patients in this cohort underwent 
successful maintenance treatment and had a decrease in ODI of 1.1 and a gain in 
utility of 0.006 at 2 years. If utility gained for this cohort was sustained to 
full life expectancy, patients' cost per QALY was $18,934 compared to a cost per 
QALY gained of $70,690.79 for posterior-only and $48,273.49 for combined 
approach in patients in the operative cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ASD undergoing operative treatment at baseline had 
greater sagittal deformity and greater improvement in health-related quality of 
life postoperatively compared to patients treated nonoperatively. Additionally, 
patients in the nonoperative cohort overall had an increase in ODI and did not 
show improvement in utility gained. Patients in the nonoperative cohort who had 
low disability and sagittal deformity underwent successful maintenance and

We examine the association between ethnic inequality and various key health 
outcomes for a global set of developed and developing countries. Our results 
show that higher ethnic inequality is associated with a poor state of public 
health, such as higher child and maternal mortality, increased stillbirths and 
child stunting, and reduced life expectancy at birth. This set of effects is 
found to be predominant mainly in developing countries, and Sub-Saharan African 
countries. Results remain robust to the inclusion of various other measures of 
inequality, ethnic composition indices, geographic endowments, and other 
relevant controls. We argue that lower contraceptive usage and poor vaccination 
rates are potential mechanisms through which ethnic inequality affects health 
outcomes. Policies targeted at improving public health may need to focus more on 
these key intermediate channels in ethnic minority regions.
