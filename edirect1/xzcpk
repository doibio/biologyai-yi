Background and Purpose- Infratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has a poor 
outcome but is rarely analyzed by cerebellar versus brain stem location. We 
evaluated this relationship and clinical outcomes among participants of the 
INTERACT 1 and 2 (Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral 
Hemorrhage Trials). Methods- Participants with brain stem and cerebellar ICH 
were compared. Logistic regression models were used to compare outcomes of death 
or major disability and quality of life. Results- Of 195 included patients, 92 
(47%) and 103 (53%) had brain stem and cerebellar ICH, respectively. Patients 
with brain stem ICH were younger (mean [SD] age, 59±13 versus 70±11 years), less 
female (28.3% versus 50.5%), with higher admission National Institutes of Health 
Stroke Scale scores (median [interquartile range], 6 [4-10) versus 3 [2-8]), 
less prior ICH (3% versus 17%), smaller ICH volumes (1.6 mL [1.0-2.8 mL] versus 
5.1 mL [2.6-10.7 mL]), and less intraventricular extension (3% versus 39%) than 
those with cerebellar ICH. Brain stem ICH had higher mortality (odds ratio, 
37.1; 95% CI, 1.99-692.27) and worse scores in the European Quality of Life 
Scale (EQ-5D) pain domain (odds ratio, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.38-8.20). Conclusions- 
Cerebellar and brain stem ICH differ in their clinical characteristics and 
prognosis, with the latter being associated with higher case fatality and worse 
EQ-5D scores in the pain domain. Clinical Trial Registration- URL:

BACKGROUND: The early detection of Fabry nephropathy is of interest to us. Its 
treatment is more effective in early stages. It has been studied by analysing 
molecular and tissue biomarkers. These have certain disadvantages that hinder 
its routine use. The aim of this study is to describe the role of the 
nephrologist in the diagnosis of the disease, and to describe the clinical 
variables associated with nephropathy in affected patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study. Patients were included from three 
reference centres in Argentina.
RESULTS: Seventy two patients were studied (26.26±16.48years): 30 of which 
(41.6%) were men and 42 of which (58.4%) were women; 27 paediatric patients and 
45 adults. Fourteen "index cases" were detected, 50% of which were diagnosed by 
nephrologists. Nephropathy was found in 44 patients (61%): 6 paediatric patients 
and 38 adults. Two types of clinical variables were associated with nephropathy: 
(i)peripheral nervous system compromise (P≤.001), angiokeratomas (P≤.001) and 
auditory compromise (P=.01-.001), with these being early clinical manifestations 
of the most severe disease phenotype, and (ii)structural heart disease 
(P=.01-.001) and central nervous system compromise (P=.05-.01), which are major 
and late complications, responsible for increased morbidity and mortality and 
lower life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: The nephrologist plays an important role in the diagnosis of Fabry 
nephropathy, although the detection thereof owing to its renal involvement would 
represent a late diagnosis, because nephropathy is associated with late 
complications of the most severe disease phenotype.

Hamilton, ON, Canada, vdalbel@mcmaster.ca.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, neurodegenerative, and 
inevitably fatal disease. There is no cure for ALS and life expectancy is 
typically 2-5 years after symptom onset. Despite the lack of a cure and the 
rapidly progressive nature of the disease, ALS is considered a "treatable 
disease" and rehabilitation is integral to optimal, comprehensive care. In 
addition to the other health care professions making up the health care team, 
physical therapy provides a critical role in the overall management in 
individuals with ALS. Physical therapy that is tailored to the individual's 
needs and goals and focused on addressing symptoms and maximizing function and 
participation enables people with ALS to live their lives to the fullest and 
with quality. The purpose of this paper is to review some of the recent ALS 
research findings that have implications for physical therapy practice.

Some effects of aging in animals are tissue-specific. In D. melanogaster 
neuronal overexpression of Gclc increases lifespan and improves certain 
physiological parameters associated with health benefits such as locomotor 
activity, circadian rhythmicity, and stress resistance. Our previous 
transcriptomic analyses of Drosophila heads, primarily composed of neuronal 
tissue, revealed significant changes in expression levels of genes involved in 
aging-related signaling pathways (Jak-STAT, MAPK, FOXO, Notch, mTOR, TGF-beta), 
translation, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, proteasomal 
degradation, glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, regulation of 
circadian rhythms, differentiation of neurons, synaptic plasticity, and 
transmission. Considering that various tissues age differently and age-related 
gene expression changes are tissue-specific, we investigated the effects of 
neuronal Gclc overexpression on gene expression levels in the imago thorax, 
which is primarily composed of muscles. A total of 58 genes were found to be 
differentially expressed between thoraces of control and Gclc overexpressing 
flies. The Gclc level demonstrated associations with expression of genes 
involved in the circadian rhythmicity, the genes in categories related to the 
muscle system process and the downregulation of genes involved in proteolysis. 
Most of the functional categories altered by Gclc overexpression related to 
metabolism including Drug metabolism, Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome 
P450, Glutathione metabolism, Starch and sucrose metabolism, Citrate cycle (TCA 
cycle), One carbon pool by folate. Thus, the transcriptomic changes caused by 
neuron-specific Gclc overexpression in the thorax were less pronounced than in 
the head and affected pathways also differed from previous results. Although 
these pathways don't belong to the canonical longevity pathways, we suggest that 
they could participate in the delay of aging of Gclc overexpressing flies.

BACKGROUND: Artificial insemination is a preferred breeding method for beef 
heifers as it advances the genetic background, produces a predictive and 
profitable calving season, and extends the heifer's reproductive life span. As 
reproductive efficiency in heifers is key for the success of beef cattle 
production systems, following artificial insemination, heifers are exposed to a 
bull for the remainder of the breeding season. Altogether, up to 95% of heifers 
might become pregnant in their first breeding season. Heifers that do not become 
pregnant at the end of the breeding season represent an irreparable economical 
loss. Additionally, heifers conceiving late in the breeding season to natural 
service, although acceptable, poses serious losses to producers. To minimize 
losses due to reproductive failure, different phenotypic parameters can be 
assessed and utilized as selection tools. Here, we tested the hypothesis that in 
a group of pre-selected heifers, records of weaning weight, age at weaning, age 
at artificial insemination, and age of dam differ among heifers of varied 
reproductive outcomes during the first breeding season.
RESULTS: None of the parameters tested presented predictive ability to 
discriminate the heifers based on the response variable ('pregnant to artificial 
insemination', 'pregnant to natural service', 'not pregnant'). Heifers 
categorized with body condition score = 6 and reproductive tract score ≥ 4 had 
the greatest proportion of pregnancy to artificial insemination (49% and 44%, 
respectively). Furthermore, it was notable that heifers presenting body 
condition score = 6 and reproductive tract score = 5 presented the greatest 
pregnancy rate at end of the breeding season (89%). Heifers younger than 368 d 
at the start of the breeding season did not become pregnant to artificial 
insemination. Those young heifers had 12.5% chance to become pregnant in their 
first breeding season, compared to 87.5% if the heifers were older than 
368 days.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that beef heifers with body condition score = 6 
and reproductive tract score ≥ 4 are more likely to become pregnant to 
artificial insemination. Careful assessment should be undertaken when developing 
replacement heifers that will not reach 12 months of age by the beginning of the 
breeding season.

Would the elimination of obesity and smoking reduce U.S. racial/ethnic/nativity 
disparities in total and healthy life expectancy?

Obesity and smoking are the two leading causes of preventable death and 
disability in the United States. Both of these health risks are socially 
patterned in ways that likely produce racial/ethnic/nativity disparities in 
total and healthy life expectancy. The current study simulates the extent to 
which the hypothetical elimination of smoking and obesity would change 
disparities in longevity and disability by analyzing data from 19,574 U.S.-born 
white, black, Hispanic and foreign-born Hispanic men and women in the 1999-2000 
through 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked 
mortality files. Results suggest that the elimination of both obesity and 
smoking would significantly narrow disparities in total and healthy life 
expectancy between black and white adults and remaining differences are 
statistically non-significant. The longstanding life expectancy advantage of 
Hispanic immigrants over whites is reduced, but remains large. The life 
expectancy advantage of U.S.-born Hispanics is reduced as well, though to a 
smaller extent than what is observed for Hispanic immigrants. There were no 
significant observed healthy life expectancy differences between white and 
U.S.-born Hispanic adults. Overall study results suggest that the elimination of 
obesity and smoking would change the shape of racial/ethnic/nativity disparities 
in ways that would result in greater health equity.

PURPOSE: De-implementation of low-value services among patients with limited 
life expectancy is challenging. Robust mortality prediction models using 
routinely collected health care data can enhance health care stakeholders' 
ability to identify populations with limited life expectancy. We developed and 
validated a claims-based prediction model for 5-year mortality using regularized 
regression methods.
METHODS: Medicare beneficiaries age 66 or older with an office visit and at 
least 12 months of pre-visit continuous Medicare A/B enrollment were identified 
in 2008. Five-year mortality was assessed through 2013. Secondary outcomes 
included 30-, 90-, and 180-day and 1-year mortality. Claims-based predictors, 
including comorbidities and indicators of disability, frailty, and functional 
impairment, were selected using regularized logistic regression, applying the 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in a random 80% training 
sample. Model performance was assessed and compared with the Gagne comorbidity 
score in the 20% validation sample.
RESULTS: Overall, 183 204 (24%) individuals died. In addition to demographics, 
161 indicators of comorbidity and function were included in the final model. In 
the validation sample, the c-statistic was 0.825 (0.823-0.828). Median-predicted 
probability of 5-year mortality was 14%; almost 4% of the cohort had a predicted 
probability greater than 80%. Compared with the Gagne score, the LASSO model led 
to improved 5-year mortality classification (net reclassification index = 9.9%; 
integrated discrimination index = 5.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our claims-based model predicting 5-year mortality showed excellent 
discrimination and calibration, similar to the Gagne score model, but resulted 
in improved mortality classification. Regularized regression is a feasible 
approach for developing prediction tools that could enhance health care research 
and evaluation of care quality.

BackgroundGiven that measles is eliminated in Canada and measles immunisation 
coverage in Ontario is high, it has been questioned whether Ontario's measles 
outbreak response is worthwhile.AimOur objective was to determine 
cost-effectiveness of measles containment protocols in Ontario from the 
healthcare payer perspective.MethodsWe developed a decision-analysis model 
comparing Ontario's measles containment strategy (based on actual 2015 outbreak 
data) with a hypothetical 'modified response'. The modified scenario assumed 10% 
response costs with reduced case and contact tracing and no outbreak-associated 
vaccinations; it was based on local and provincial administrative and laboratory 
data and parameters from peer-reviewed literature. Short- and long-term health 
outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs discounted at 1.5%, were 
estimated. We conducted one- and two-way sensitivity analyses.ResultsThe 2015 
outbreak in Ontario comprised 16 measles cases and an estimated 3,369 contacts. 
Predictive modelling suggested that the outbreak response prevented 16 
outbreak-associated cases at a cost of CAD 1,213,491 (EUR 861,579). The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CAD 739,063 (EUR 524,735) per QALY 
gained for the outbreak response vs modified response. To meet the commonly 
accepted cost-effectiveness threshold of CAD 50,000 (EUR 35,500) per QALY 
gained, the outbreak response would have to prevent 94 measles cases. In 
sensitivity analyses, the findings were robust.ConclusionsOntario's measles 
outbreak response exceeds generally accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds and 
may not be the most efficient use of public health resources from a healthcare 
payer perspective. These findings should be balanced against benefits of 
increased vaccine coverage and maintaining elimination status.

Life expectancy at age 60 in Brazil has increased by around nine years in a 
little over 50 years. This general gain in life expectancy at national level has 
been heterogeneous across the country's major regions. Furthermore, little is 
known about how increases in life expectancy at age 60 across regions influence 
the number of years lived with some form of associated disability or the number 
of years lived free from disability. This study aimed to analyze increases in 
total life expectancy and its components [disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) 
and disability life expectancy (DLE)] at ages 60, 70, and 80 in Brazil and Major 
Regions in 1998 and 2013. The study used data on disability obtained from the 
1998 National Household Sample Survey (PNAD - acronym in Portuguese) and 2013 
National Health Survey (PNS- acronym in Portuguese) and used the Sullivan method 
to estimate DFLE by sex and age. The findings show that there was an increase in 
life expectancy and a concomitant increase in DFLE between 1998 and 2013. 
However, the gains in DFLE were not statistically significant in the North and 
Center-west regions. This means that, with the exception of the latter regions, 
in addition to living longer, the Brazils population aged 60 years can expect to 
live a greater number of healthy years.

Publisher: A expectativa de vida aos 60 anos no Brasil aumentou cerca de 9 anos 
em pouco mais de meio século. Trata-se de um ganho de sobrevida generalizado, 
mas que também ocorre de forma heterogênica entre as Grandes Regiões do país. 
Por outro lado, pouco se sabe, ainda, como os aumentos da expectativa de vida 
aos 60 anos por região podem ser acompanhados por acréscimos ou decréscimos 
tanto nos anos vividos com incapacidade, quanto nos vividos livre de 
incapacidade. O objetivo deste artigo é analisar, para 1998 e 2013, aumentos na 
Expectativa de Vida Total e suas componentes: Expectativa de Vida Livre de 
Incapacidade Funcional (EVLI) e com Incapacidade Funcional (EVCI), aos 60, 70 e 
80 anos para a população do Brasil e Grandes Regiões. O estudo utilizou 
informações sobre incapacidade funcional da PNAD de 1998 e PNS de 2013 e 
empregou o método de Sullivan para estimação da EVLI por sexo e idade. No geral, 
os resultados mostraram que, entre 1998 e 2013, concomitantemente aos ganhos na 
EV, ocorreu um crescimento na EVLI. Contudo, os ganhos na EVLI não foram 
estatisticamente significativos para as regiões Norte e Centro-Oeste. Ou seja, 
com exceção dessas regiões, além de viver mais, a população idosa de 60 anos 
poderia esperar viver um número maior de anos com saúde.

PURPOSE: National hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening recommendations for patients 
with cancer anticipating systemic anticancer therapy range from universal 
screening to screening based on risk of HBV infection, cancer therapy-specific 
risk of HBV reactivation, or both. We conducted cost-effectiveness analyses to 
identify optimal HBV screening strategies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We constructed decision-analytic models to analyze three 
strategies (no screening, universal screening, and selective screening based on 
use of an HBV infection risk tool) for hypothetic cohorts of patients 
anticipating anticancer therapy at high or lower risk for HBV reactivation. 
Model parameters were drawn from previously published studies, the SEER-Medicare 
database, and other online resources. Outcomes included lifetime expected cost, 
quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, 
measured in US dollars required to gain an additional quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY).
RESULTS: For patients at high reactivation risk, universal screening dominated 
(ie, was cheaper and more effective than) the other two strategies. Universal 
screening was associated with a gain in life expectancy of 0.01 QALY compared 
with no screening and cost $76.06 less than no screening and $4.34 less than 
selective screening. For those at lower reactivation risk, universal screening 
still dominated selective screening; however, the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio of the universal screening strategy compared with no screening was 
$186,917 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Universal HBV screening is cost effective and cheaper for patients 
receiving anticancer therapy associated with a high reactivation risk. For 
patients receiving anticancer therapy associated with a lower reactivation risk, 
universal screening is not cost effective.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an up-to-date overview on indications, efficacy 
and safety of the existing fertility preservation strategies as well as on the 
features and management of sexual dysfunction in young adult women with newly 
diagnosed cancer.
RECENT FINDINGS: Because of the improved life expectancy of cancer survivors, a 
growing attention should be given to the side effects of anticancer treatments. 
Among young cancer patients, risk of infertility and sexual dysfunction are of 
great concern.
SUMMARY: As advocated by guidelines, patients need to be thoroughly informed of 
potential side effects of treatment before starting them. On this regard, 
efforts should be made to improve the counseling of young adult patients around 
fertility and sexuality. Fertility preservation strategies should be properly 
and extensively explained to all young patients, weighting the pros and cons to 
choose the more appropriate options for each situation. In addition, discussing 
sexual dysfunction and delivering sexual rehabilitation for cancer survivors not 
only allows for renewal of sexual function but can also promote increased 
quality of life and help women create a new and satisfying chapter in their life 
for many years after cancer.

Disease.

University, Gothenburg, Sweden.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the cost-effectiveness of continued treatment for 
patients with moderate-severe Crohn's disease in clinical remission, with a 
combination of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha [anti-TNFα] [infliximab] and 
immunomodulator therapy compared with two different withdrawal strategies: [1] 
withdrawal of the anti-TNFα therapy; and [2] withdrawal of the immunomodulator 
therapy, respectively.
METHODS: A decision-tree model was constructed mimicking three treatment arms: 
[1] continued combination therapy with infliximab and immunomodulator; [2] 
withdrawal of infliximab; or [3] withdrawal of the immunomodulator. Relapses in 
each arm are managed with treatment intensification and re-institution of the 
de-escalated drug according to a prespecified algorithm. State-dependent relapse 
risks, remission probabilities, and quality of life weights were collected from 
previous published studies.
RESULTS: Combination therapy was less costly and more efficient than the 
withdrawal of the immunomodulator, and more costly and more efficient than 
withdrawal of infliximab. Whether or not combination therapy is cost-effective, 
compared with the alternatives, depends primarily on current pharmaceutical 
prices and the willingness-to-pay per additional quality-adjusted life-year 
[QALY].
CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy using a combination of anti-TNFα [infliximab] 
and an immunomodulator is cost-effective in the treatment of Crohn's disease 
compared with treatment cycles in which the immunomodulator is withdrawn. 
Combination treatment is cost-effective compared with treatment cycles in which 
infliximab is withdrawn, at prices of infliximab below€192/100 mg, given a 
willingness-to-pay threshold at€49 020 [Sweden] per additional QALY.

Cardiovascular diseases are the most prominent cause of death in Western 
society, especially in the elderly. With the increasing life expectancy, the 
number of patients with cardiovascular diseases will rise in the near future, 
leading to an increased healthcare burden. There is a need for new therapies to 
treat this growing number of patients. The discovery of long non-coding RNAs has 
led to a novel group of molecules that could be considered for their potential 
as therapeutic targets. This review presents an overview of long non-coding RNAs 
that are regulated in vascular disease and aging and which might therefore give 
insight into new pathways that could be targeted to diagnose, prevent, and/or 
treat vascular diseases.

Author information:
(1)Iowa State University.

Iowa State University Extension and Outreach conducted an assessment of Iowa 
farm operators' perceptions of the barriers and motivators when considering 
retrofitting tractors with rollover protective structures (ROPS). A statewide 
sample of approximately 2,000 farm operators was surveyed in the 2017 Iowa Farm 
and Rural Life Poll. A series of questions was asked to evaluate the importance 
of potential barriers to decisions to not retrofit a tractor and potential 
motivators that could influence the decision to retrofit or purchase a tractor 
with ROPS. The survey received a 48% response rate (999 responses). Among the 
76% of Iowa farm operators who reported at least one pre-1985 tractor, only 
18.6% reported that all of those tractors had ROPS. The remaining 81.4% had at 
least one tractor that did not have ROPS. Iowa farm operators' perceptions of 
the barriers and motivators when considering retrofitting tractors with ROPS are 
shared. The results of Iowa farm operators' perceptions will be used as Iowa 
State University Extension and Outreach prepares to align efforts with the 
National Tractor Safety Coalition and participate in the National ROPS Rebate 
Program, with the goal of reducing tractor fatalities.

Acromegaly is a rare disease, associated with multiple organs and systems 
damage. Thanks to implementation of registries, systematic data gathering, 
knowledge sharing and standardizing medical practices for optimal care greatly 
improved. Data concerning 19 national acromegaly registries are available, 
involving more than 16,000 patients. The weighted mean age of diagnosis is 45.2 
years and seems stable over time. A macroadenoma is found in 75% of the cases. 
The proportion of patients operated (>80%) did not change along time. By 
contrast, use of radiotherapy has decreased while use of medical therapy 
increased. If judged on IGF-I levels, acromegaly is controlled in 61.3% of the 
patients. The disease control rate has improved over time. This is likely due to 
the development of medical treatment strategies. The collection of data about 
comorbidities in national registries is much less comprehensive than those about 
epidemiology, disease control or treatment strategies. The most reported 
comorbidities are arterial hypertension and diabetes. Data concerning mortality 
trends are controversial. It seems that cancer has become a leading cause of 
death in acromegaly patients in the last decade, period in which life expectancy 
improved, while cardiovascular mortality decreased. In conclusion, acromegaly 
registries offer a global view of the disease with no "a priori" assumptions. 
This is of outmost importance, because of the large amount of data and the huge 
number of associated comorbidities. This will help to establish guidelines for 
management of this rare disease.

Heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) is a component of the heat shock response pathway 
that is induced by cytoplasmic proteotoxic stress. In addition to its role in 
stress response, HSF-1 also acts as a key regulator of the rate of organismal 
aging. Overexpression of HSF-1 promotes longevity in C. elegans via mechanisms 
that remain less understood. Moreover, genetic ablation of a negative regulator 
of HSF-1, termed as heat shock factor binding protein 1 (HSB-1), results in 
hsf-1-dependent life span extension in animals. Here we show that in the absence 
of HSB-1, HSF-1 acquires increased DNA binding activity to its genomic target 
sequence. Using RNA-Seq to compare the gene expression profiles of the hsb-1 
mutant and hsf-1 overexpression strains, we found that while more than 1,500 
transcripts show ≥1.5-fold upregulation due to HSF-1 overexpression, HSB-1 
inhibition alters the expression of less than 500 genes in C. elegans Roughly 
half of the differentially regulated transcripts in the hsb-1 mutant have 
altered expression also in hsf-1 overexpressing animals, with a strongly 
correlated fold-expression pattern between the two strains. In addition, genes 
that are upregulated via both HSB-1 inhibition and HSF-1 overexpression include 
numerous DAF-16 targets that have known functions in longevity regulation. This 
study identifies how HSB-1 acts as a specific regulator of the transactivation 
potential of HSF-1 in non-stressed conditions, thus providing a detailed 
understanding of the role of HSB-1/HSF-1 signaling pathway in transcriptional 
regulation and longevity in C. elegans.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Treatment for Metastatic Renal Carcinoma in 
Romania.

Liviu Preda A(1), Galieta Mincă D(1).

Author information:
(1)Public Health and Management Department, Carol Davila University of Medicine 
and Pharmacy, Bucharest.

Rationale: In recent years, the cost of several treatment options for renal 
cancer have been supported by the Romanian healthcare system for both first- and 
second-line therapies. First-line alternatives through real-life efficacy and 
amplitude of adverse reactions may influence the efficacy and costs of patients 
treated with second-line treatment. Objective: Estimation of the 
cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit ratio for first-line treatment alternatives: 
Sunitinib and Pazopanib from the payer's perspective in the Romanian healthcare 
system. Methods and Results: We developed a Markov model to calculate the 
cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit ratio for 2 cohorts of patients using the 
results from the COMPARZ study for efficacy (progression-free survival, general 
survivability and quality of life) and safety and costs from national hospital 
databases. For an estimated population of 800 patients, Pazopanib has a 
quantified benefit of 7.19 years in progression-free survival, 11.71 life years 
gained and 8.97 years of quality-adjusted life-years compared to Sunitinib. The 
analysis is limited by the accuracy of the national data used and the 
transposition of general data on efficacy and safety at the local level.

Survival Analysis of Cancer Patients in North Eastern Nigeria from 2004 - 2017 - 
A Kaplan - Meier Method.

University, Ota, Nigeria.

Lagos, Nigeria.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is a deadly malignant disease and is prevalent in Sub Saharan 
Africa. The North East part of Nigeria in particular and the country, in 
general, are struggling to cope with the increasing burden of cancer and other 
communicable and non-communicable diseases. The situation is worsened by the 
ongoing insurgency and terrorist activities in the area.
AIM: The aim of this paper is to present the research findings from a cohort 
study aimed at the analysis of the estimation of the survivorship time of the 
real data of cancer patients in the North-eastern part of Nigeria and to 
establish if the insurgency in the region has contributed negatively to the life 
expectancy of its inhabitants.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The record of 1,090 patients from medical records 
departments of the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH), located in 
Maiduguri, the capital city of Borno State in northeast Nigeria was obtained. 
The record showed patients that were diagnosed and died of one type of cancer or 
the other from 2004 to 2017. All the cancer cases included in the present study 
were grouped into sex, age, marital status, occupation, date admitted and date 
of death/discharge. Descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier method were used to 
analyse the data using SPSS version 23 while Microsoft EXCEL and Minitab 16.0 
were used for data cleansing and organisation.
RESULTS: Of the 1,090 patients analysed, 920 (84.40%) experienced the event, 
i.e. death, while 170 (15.60%) patients were censored. The data were analysed 
based on the ages and sex of the patients. 50.20% of the patients were of ages 
21-50 years. The proportions of patients in this age bracket surviving past 7 
days are 75%, while those between ages 80 years and above is 12 days. Others are 
of survival time of 5 days (ages 0-20 years) and 7 days (51-79 years). Using 
sex, 75% of the patients' survival time is 7 days in the case of male and 6 days 
for females. It is safe to say that the survival time for cancer patients of the 
university the Maiduguri is 6 days and the result reflects the Northeastern part 
of Nigeria. This is because the hospital is one of few tertiary healthcare 
facilities in that area and consequently, cancer cases are often referred there.
CONCLUSION: Cancer incidence is high, and the probability of survival reduces as 
the survival time increases. This is a dire situation in need of urgent 
intervention from the government, groups and individuals to tackle the scourge 
of cancer, thereby improving on the life expectancy battered by the ongoing Boko 
Haram insurgency in that region.

B-1852, Belgium.

BACKGROUND: Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), often and misleadingly 
referred to as 'premature menopause', is defined as a loss of ovarian activity 
before the age of 40 years and is characterized by irregular or absent periods 
and reduced fertility. Symptoms include those associated with the natural 
menopause (night sweats and vaginal dryness), and with the long-term adverse 
effects of estrogen deficiency (osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease): the 
latter is believed to explain the shorter life expectancy associated with POI.
OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The objective of the current review was to collect all 
relevant studies supporting recommendations on the indications, treatment 
options, and risks of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (estrogen, progestogens 
and androgens) for women with POI.
SEARCH METHODS: The current review was written based on the best available 
evidence on the topic collected for the recently published ESHRE guideline on 
the management of women with POI. PUBMED/MEDLINE and the Cochrane library were 
searched in a stepwise approach. Relevant references were summarized in evidence 
tables, with assessment of the quality.
OUTCOMES: HRT is strongly recommended for women with POI, mainly for vasomotor 
and genito-urinary symptom relief. In addition, HRT has been shown to have a 
role in bone protection and probably also in primary prevention of 
cardiovascular disease. There is little evidence on the optimal type, regimen 
and dose of HRT; patient preference for route and method of administration of 
each component of HRT must be considered when prescribing, as should 
contraceptive needs. In women with POI, physiological replacement of estrogen 
(and progesterone) is essential for their health, and the controversies that 
surround the use of HRT in postmenopausal women do not apply.
LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: N/A.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS: New areas of study on HRT for women with POI should focus on 
life expectancy, quality of life and neurological function. Furthermore, 
randomized controlled trials comparing transdermal estradiol with oral estrogens 
with regard to efficacy, patient satisfaction and side effects are urgently 
needed.
STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The authors received no funding for the 
review. The costs for the development of the ESHRE guideline were covered by 
ESHRE. The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
