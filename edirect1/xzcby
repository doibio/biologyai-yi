The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the company 
that manufactures ramucirumab (Cyramza®, Eli Lilly and Company) to submit 
evidence of the clinical and cost effectiveness of the drug administered alone 
(monotherapy) or with paclitaxel (combination therapy) for treating adults with 
advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction (GC/GOJ) adenocarcinoma 
that were previously treated with chemotherapy, as part of the Institute's 
single technology appraisal (STA) process. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd 
(KSR), in collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam, was commissioned to 
act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the company's 
submission, the ERG review, and NICE's subsequent decisions. Clinical 
effectiveness evidence for ramucirumab monotherapy (RAM), compared with best 
supportive care (BSC), was based on data from the REGARD trial. Clinical 
effectiveness evidence for ramucirumab combination therapy (RAM + PAC), compared 
with paclitaxel monotherapy (PAC), was based on data from the RAINBOW trial. In 
addition, the company undertook a network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare 
RAM + PAC with BSC and docetaxel. Cost-effectiveness evidence of monotherapy and 
combination therapy relied on partitioned survival, cost-utility models. The 
base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the company was 
£188,640 (vs BSC) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for monotherapy 
and £118,209 (vs BSC) per QALY gained for combination therapy. The ERG 
assessment indicated that the modelling structure represented the course of the 
disease; however, a few errors were identified and some of the input parameters 
were challenged. The ERG provided a new base case, with ICERs (vs BSC) of 
£188,100 (monotherapy) per QALY gained and £129,400 (combination therapy) per 
QALY gained and conducted additional exploratory analyses. The NICE Appraisal 
Committee (AC), considered the company's decision problem was in line with the 
NICE scope, with the exception of the choice of comparators for the combination 
therapy model. The most plausible ICER for ramucirumab monotherapy compared with 
BSC was £188,100 per QALY gained. The Committee considered that the ERG's 
exploratory analysis in which RAM + PAC was compared with PAC by using the 
direct head-to-head data (including utilities) from the RAINBOW trial, provided 
the most plausible ICER (i.e. £408,200 per QALY gained) for ramucirumab 
combination therapy. The Committee concluded that end-of-life considerations 
cannot be applied for either case, since neither failed to offer an extension to 
life of at least 3 months. The company did not submit a patient access scheme 
(PAS). After consideration of the evidence, the Committee concluded that 
ramucirumab alone or with paclitaxel could not be considered a cost-effective 
use of National Health Service resources for treating advanced GC/GOJ patients 
that were previously treated with chemotherapy, and therefore its use could not 
be recommended. We might wonder if a complete STA process is necessary for 
treatments without a PAS, which are, according to the company's submission, 
already associated with ICERs far above the currently accepted threshold in all 
(base-case, sensitivity and scenario) analyses.

Inactivation of p53 has been shown to correlate with drug resistance in tumors. 
However, in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), p53 is rarely mutated, yet 
the tumors remain highly insensitive to the conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. 
The underlying mechanisms responsible for the non-genetic p53 inactivation 
remain obscure. Here, we report, for the first time, that Apoptosis Stimulating 
of P53 Protein 1 (ASPP1) was remarkably downregulated at both mRNA (about 
3.9-fold) and protein (about 4.9-fold) levels in ccRCC human specimens in 
comparison with the paired normal controls. In addition, lower ASPP1 was closely 
related to the higher grade of tumors and shorter life expectancy of ccRCC 
patients, both with p < 0.001. We also find that CpG island hypermethylation at 
promoter region contributed to the suppression of ASPP1 expression in ccRCC that 
contained relatively low levels of ASPP1. Further functional studies 
demonstrated that forced expression ASPP1 not only significantly inhibited the 
growth rate of ccRCC, but also promoted sensitivity of ccRCC to the conventional 
chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced apoptosis. Moreover, ASPP1 
expression was accompanied with the apoptosis-prone alterations of p53 targets 
expression and p53 target PIG3 luciferase reporter activation. In contrast, 
ASPP1 knockdown promoted cell growth and prevent 5-FU-induced p53 activation and 
apoptosis. In conclusion, our results suggest that ASPP1 silencing is one of 
dominate mechanisms in inhibiting wild type p53 in ccRCC. ASPP1, therefore, may 
be potentially used as a promising biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic 
intervention in ccRCC.

AIM: Growth charts for cerebral palsy (CP) have been constructed using data for 
24 920 Californian patients, covering ages 2 to 20 years, with separate charts 
for the five severity levels of the Gross Motor Function Classification System 
(GMFCS). Our aim was to test how the data for British children with CP fit these 
charts, compared with conventional local charts.
METHOD: US CP growth reference was reanalysed using the lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) 
method to allow calculation of standard deviation z-scores. Growth data for 195 
children with CP in Glasgow, UK, were retrieved and converted to z-scores using 
the CP reference as well as the combined World Health Organization and UK 1990 
growth reference (UK-WHO).
RESULTS: Compared to the UK-WHO reference, measurements diverged progressively 
with increasing severity, with mean height for GMFCS level V being close to the 
second UK-WHO centile. Compared with the CP reference, mean height and weight 
z-scores were between the 50th and 75th centiles for all severity levels, while 
body mass index was just below the 50th centile.
INTERPRETATION: British children with severe CP seem relatively very small when 
their growth data are plotted on non-CP charts, but their data for weight and 
body mass index fit well to US CP charts and reasonably well for height. The LMS 
look-up tables will make it possible to calculate z-scores and produce charts in 
local formats.

Recent advances in targeted advanced lung cancer therapy in the elderly.

With increasing life expectancy over the last several decades, the incidence of 
lung cancer is increasing in the elderly population too. In clinical practice 
about 50% of lung cancers were diagnosed in patients older than 65 years and 
about 30-40% of lung cancer patients are 70 years old or more. Treatment of 
elderly patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a challenge 
in clinical practice, because these patients are not eligible for aggressive 
therapies for the age-related reduction of functional reserve of many organs and 
comorbidities. Areas covered: The activity and safety of small molecules for the 
treatment of NSCLC harbouring EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement are reviewed 
and discussed here, using evidence from clinical trials. Expert commentary: Age 
alone should not dictate treatment-related decisions for elderly patients with 
advanced NSCLC. Some evidence has shown that the only relevant factor for 
survival outcome in the elderly is performance status and organ functions both 
with chemotherapy and targeted therapy too. Considering the toxicity profile of 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, these small molecules are particularly attractive to 
treat elderly patients, who could experience potentially more toxicity from 
chemotherapy. Studies specifically addressed to evaluate the activity of 
targeted therapy are still more limited.

AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of nutrition education by dedicated 
dietitians (DD) for hyperphosphatemia management among hemodialysis patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a trial-based economic evaluation in 12 Lebanese 
hospital-based units. In total, 545 prevalent patients were cluster randomized 
to DD, trained hospital dietitian (THD), and existing practice (EP) groups. 
During Phase I (6 months), DD (n = 116) received intensive education by DD 
trained on renal nutrition, THD (n = 299) received care from trained hospital 
dietitians, and EP (n = 130) received usual care from untrained hospital 
dietitians. Patients were followed-up during Phase II (6 months).
RESULTS: At baseline, EP had the lowest weekly hemodialysis time, and DD had the 
highest serum phosphorus and malnutrition-inflammation score. The additional 
costs of the intervention were low compared with the societal costs (DD: $76.7, 
$21,007.7; EP: $4.6, $18,675.4; THD: $17.4, $20,078.6, respectively). Between 
Phases I and II, DD showed the greatest decline in services use and societal 
costs (DD: -$2,364.0; EP: -$1,727.7; THD: -$1,105.7). At endline, DD experienced 
the highest decrease in adjusted serum phosphorus (DD: -0.32; EP: +0.16; THD: 
+0.04 mg/dL), no difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and the 
highest societal costs. DD had a cost-effectiveness ratio of $7,853.6 per 1 mg 
decrease in phosphorus, compared with EP; and was dominated by THD. Regarding 
QALY, DD was dominated by EP and THD. The results were sensitive to changes in 
key parameters.
LIMITATIONS: The analysis depended on numerous assumptions. Interpreting the 
results is limited by the significant baseline differences in key parameters, 
suggestive of higher baseline societal costs in DD.
CONCLUSIONS: DD yielded the greatest effectiveness and decrease in societal 
costs, but did not affect QALY. Regarding serum phosphorus, DD was likely to be 
cost-effective compared with EP, but had a low cost-effectiveness probability 
compared with THD. Regarding QALY, DD was not likely to be cost-effective. 
Assessing the long-term cost-effectiveness of DD, on similar groups, is 
recommended.

Life-Threatening and Suspicious Lesions Caused by Mechanical Cardiopulmonary 
Resuscitation.

Milling L(1), Leth PM, Astrup BS.

Author information:
(1)From the Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Southern Denmark, 
Odense C, Denmark.

Chest compression devices for mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 
have become more common. Here, we report the case of a young woman who attempted 
resuscitated with LUCAS™2 after she was found unconscious at home. At autopsy, 
we found extensive intramuscular hemorrhages in posterior neck, between the 
scapulae, and in the lumbar region. Investigation of internal organs showed 
injuries to the lung, spleen, and kidney. The extension of the injuries gave 
rise to suspicion of homicide by smothering, which police investigation 
subsequently did not support. The pattern of injury could be attributed to 
automatic compression decompression CPR with LUCAS™2.The injuries may have been 
lethal had the patient survived. For the forensic pathologists, it is important 
to remain updated on developments in treatment techniques to avoid pitfalls when 
interpreting injury.Larger studies, prospective or retrospective, may be able to 
qualify the possible risks of automatic compression decompression CPR even 
further.

INTRODUCTION: Alcohol use is one of the main preventable risk factors affecting 
mortality and premature disability.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the estimates of mortality and years of life lost as a 
result of premature death (YLL) due to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and disorders 
attributed to alcohol use in Brazil and its federated units in 1990 and 2015.
METHODS: Descriptive study using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 
(2015) and the Mortality Information System (SIM). Statistical models were used 
to obtain corrected mortality estimates for selected causes. Rates were 
standardized by age.
RESULTS: In 1990, 16,226 deaths were estimated for the three conditions 
(17.0/100 thousand inhabitants), while in 2015 there were 28,337 deaths 
(15.7/100 thousand inhabitants). There was a reduction in mortality (per 100 
thousand) due to cirrhosis (from 11.4 to 9.5), stability in mortality rates 
related to liver cancer (1.5 and 1.9), and stability in mortality rates caused 
by alcohol use disorders (4.1 and 4.3). Mortality rates were 5.1 times higher 
among men, and the five states with the highest mortality rates and YLL were 
from the Northeast Region: Sergipe, Ceará, Pernambuco, Paraíba, and Alagoas. 
Mortality and YLL rates for the three conditions studied increased in the 
ranking of causes of death in both sexes, with the exception of cirrhosis in the 
female population.
CONCLUSION: The three conditions studied are responsible for a significant 
burden of premature mortality in Brazil, especially among men and residents of 
the northeast region. These results reinforce the urgent need for public 
policies that address harmful alcohol consumption in Brazil.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The global burden of disease (GBD) 2015 project, 
extends GBD analyses to include Brazilian federative units separately. We take 
advantage of GBD methodological advances to describe the current burden of 
diabetes and hyperglycemia in Brazil.
METHODS: Using standard GBD 2015 methods, we analyzed the burden of diabetes, 
chronic kidney disease due to diabetes and high fasting plasma glucose in Brazil 
and its states.
RESULTS: The age-standardized rate of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
which was lost to high fasting plasma glucose, a category which encompasses 
burdens of diabetes and of lesser hyperglycemia, were 2448.85 (95% UI 
2165.96-2778.69) /100000 for males, and 1863.90 (95% UI 1648.18-2123.47) /100000 
for females in 2015. This rate was more than twice as great in states with 
highest burden, these being overwhelmingly in the northeast and north, compared 
with those with lowest rates. The rate of crude DALYs for high fasting plasma 
glucose, increased by 35% since 1990, while DALYs due to all non-communicable 
diseases increased only by 12.7%, and DALYs from all causes declined by 20.5%.
DISCUSSION: The worldwide pandemic of diabetes and hyperglycemia now causes a 
major and growing disease burden in Brazil, especially in states with greater 
poverty and a lesser educational level.
CONCLUSION: Diabetes and chronic kidney disease due to diabetes, as well as high 
fasting plasma glucose in general, currently constitute a major and growing 
public health problem in Brazil. Actions to date for their prevention and 
control have been slow considering the magnitude of this burden.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze mortality and years of life lost due to death or 
disability (disability-adjusted life years - DALYs) for interpersonal violence 
and self-harm, comparing 1990 and 2015, in Brazil and Federated Units, using 
estimates produced by the Global Burden of Disease 2015 (GBD 2015).
METHODS: Secondary data analysis of estimates from the GBD 2015, producing 
standardized death rates and years of life lost due to death or disability. The 
main source of death data was the Mortality Information System, submitted to 
correction of underreporting of deaths and redistribution of garbage codes.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2015, homicide mortality rates were stable, with a 
percentage variation of -0.9%, from 28.3/100 thousand inhabitants (95% UI 
26.9-32.1) in 1990 to 27.8/100,000 (95% UI 24.3-29.8) in 2015. Homicide rates 
were higher in Alagoas and Pernambuco, and there was a reduction in São Paulo 
(-40.9%). Suicide rates decreased by 19%, from 8.1/100,000 (95% UI 7.5-8.6) in 
1990 to 6.6/100,000 (95% UI 6.1-7,9) in 2015. Higher rates were found in Rio 
Grande do Sul. In the ranking of external causes for years of life lost due to 
death or disability (DALYs), firearm aggression predominated, followed by 
transportation accidents; self-inflicted injuries were in sixth place.
CONCLUSIONS: The study shows the importance of external causes among young 
people and men as a cause of premature death and disabilities, which is a 
priority problem in the country. The Global Burden of Disease study may support 
public policies for violence prevention.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the global burden of disease related to disability 
adjusted life years (DALYs) attributed to selected risk factors in Brazil and 
its 27 Federated Units.
METHODS: Databases from the Global Burden of Disease study in Brazil and its 
Federated Units were used, estimating the summary exposure value (SEV) for 
selected environmental, behavioral, and metabolic risk factors (RFs), and their 
combinations. The DALYs were used as the main metric. The ranking of major RFs 
between 1990 and 2015 was compiled, comparing data by sex and states.
RESULTS: The analyzed RFs account for 38.8% of the loss of DALYs in the country. 
Dietary risks was the main cause of DALYs in 2015. In men, dietary risks 
contributed to 12.2% of DALYs and in women, to 11.1%. Other RFs were high 
systolic blood pressure, high body mass index, smoking, high fasting plasma 
glucose and, among men, alcohol and drug use. The main RFs were metabolic and 
behavioral. In most states, dietary risks was the main RF, followed by high 
blood pressure.
CONCLUSION: Dietary risks leads the RF ranking for Brazil and its Federated 
Units. Men are more exposed to behavioral risk factors, and women are more 
exposed to metabolic ones.

Pituitary Apoplexy (PA) is defined as a clinical syndrome comprising headache, 
visual deficits and altered sensorium, which can result from haemorrhage or 
infarction of the pituitary gland. Acute ischaemic stroke following PA is very 
rare. We are presenting a 35-year-old young otherwise healthy lady who presented 
with neuro ophthalmological and vascular symptoms on a background of PA. Imaging 
revealed a pituitary macro adenoma with parasellar extension with internal 
bleed. Cerebral angiography revealed that the mass compressed the bilateral 
cavernous sinuses (left more than right), resulting in obliteration of the 
cavernous portion of the left Internal Carotid Artery (ICA). She was treated 
with steroids and surgical debulking of the tumour through trans-sphenoidal 
approach and postoperative imaging showed recanalization of the ICA with 
reduction of the tumour size. The histopathological diagnosis was consistent 
with pituitary macro adenoma. Patient improved in level of sensorium, eye 
movement and the patient showed almost full recovery after the operation. PA 
resulting in ICA occlusion is very rare. Early intervention is required for 
reducing mortality and morbidity and to improve quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced diseases often experience deficient 
continuity of care. Although integrated palliative care promotes continuity of 
care, it is not clear how it can be optimized to improve continuity of care 
experiences.
AIM: To examine how relational, informational and management continuity of care 
are experienced by patients with advanced diseases and their family caregivers 
receiving care from several integrated palliative care initiatives in five 
European countries.
DESIGN: We adopted a longitudinal qualitative study design including two 
interviews (interval 3 months) with patients and family caregivers focusing on 
how health care professionals responded to their needs. Interviews were 
audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analysis involved a two-step 
qualitative content approach.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 22 integrated palliative care initiatives 
(established local palliative care collaborations) were selected in Belgium, 
Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. We recruited 152 
patients (63% cancer, 24% chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 13% heart 
failure; life expectancy <1 year; mean age 68 years, 56% female) and 92 family 
caregivers (mean age 61 years, 66% female).
RESULTS: Trusted relationships with a small number of key health care 
professionals to receive tailored care and easily access help were essential. 
Relational continuity was often deficient, especially with general 
practitioners. Although informational and management continuity was often 
lacking in care provision, collaborative integrated palliative care initiatives 
were related to consistent and coherent care.
CONCLUSION: Patients and family caregivers most likely experience continuity of 
care by having a small number of trusted health care professionals who are 
available, provide multidisciplinary care and regularly transfer information to 
all health care professionals involved. Optimizing continuity of care requires 
further integration of integrated palliative care initiatives with other health 
care professionals involved in the patients' care networks.

OBJECTIVES: To compare long term changes in mortality and life expectancy at 
birth (LE) of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory and of the overall 
Australian population; to determine the contributions of changes in mortality in 
specific age groups to changes in LE for each population.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective trend analysis of death and LE data 
for the NT Aboriginal and Australian populations, 1967-2012.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: LE estimates based on abridged life tables; mortality 
estimates (deaths per 100 000 population); and age decomposition of LE changes 
by sex and time period.
RESULTS: Between 1967 and 2012, LE increased for both NT Aboriginal and all 
Australians; the difference in LE between the two populations declined by 4.6 
years for females, but increased by one year for males. Between 1967-1971 and 
1980-1984, LE of NT Aboriginal people increased rapidly, particularly through 
reduced infant mortality; from 1980-1984 to 1994-1998, there was little change; 
from 1994-1998 to 2008-2012, there were modest gains in older age groups. 
Decomposition by age group identified the persistent and substantial 
contribution of the 35-74-year age groups to the difference in LE between NT 
Aboriginal people and all Australians.
CONCLUSIONS: Early gains in LE for NT Aboriginal people are consistent with 
improvements in nutrition, maternal and infant care, and infectious disease 
control. A rapid epidemiological transition followed, when LE gains in younger 
age groups plateaued and non-communicable diseases became more prevalent. Recent 
LE gains, across all adult age groups, are consistent with improved health 
service access and chronic disease management. If LE is to continue improving, 
socio-economic disadvantage and its associated risks must be reduced.

Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the risk of 
drug-sensitive HIV transmission but may increase the transmission of 
drug-resistant HIV. We used a mathematical model to estimate the long-term 
population-level benefits of ART and determine the scenarios under which earlier 
ART (treatment at 1 year post-infection, on average) could decrease 
simultaneously both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence (new infections). We 
constructed an infection-age-structured mathematical model that tracked the 
transmission rates over the course of infection and modelled the patients' life 
expectancy as a function of ART initiation timing. We fitted this model to the 
annual AIDS incidence and death data directly, and to resistance data and 
demographic data indirectly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in San 
Francisco. Using counterfactual scenarios, we assessed the impact on total and 
drug-resistant HIV incidence of ART initiation timing, frequency of acquired 
drug resistance, and second-line drug effectiveness (defined as the combination 
of resistance monitoring, biomedical drug efficacy and adherence). Earlier ART 
initiation could decrease the number of both total and drug-resistant HIV 
incidence when second-line drug effectiveness is sufficiently high (greater than 
80%), but increase the proportion of new infections that are drug resistant. 
Thus, resistance may paradoxically appear to be increasing while actually 
decreasing.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) with complicating chronic lung diseases and/or 
hypoxia falls into group 3 of the updated classification of PH. Patients with 
chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), diffuse lung disease (such as 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)) and with sleep disordered breathing are 
particularly exposed to the risk of developing PH. Although PH in such a context 
is usually mild, a minority of patients exhibit severe haemodynamic impairment, 
defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) of ≥35 mmHg or mPAP values 
ranging between 25 mmHg and 35 mmHg with a low cardiac index (<2 L·min-1·m-2). 
The overlap between lung parenchymal disease and PH heavily affects life 
expectancy in such a patient population and complicates their therapeutic 
management. In this review we illustrate the pathological features and the 
underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of pulmonary circulation in chronic 
lung diseases, with an emphasis on COPD, IPF and obstructive sleep apnoea 
syndrome.

On the background of high morbidity and mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) and rapid development of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), we conducted 
a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) 
according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety 
of traditional insect Chinese medicine and related preparation for non-surgical 
HCC. RCTs were searched based on standardized searching rules in mainstream 
medical databases from the inception up to May 2016. Ultimately, a total of 57 
articles with 4,651 patients enrolled in this meta-analysis. We found that 
traditional insect Chinese medicine and related preparation combined 
chemotherapy show significantly effectiveness and safety in objective response 
rate (P < 0.001), survival time extension [12 months (P < 0.001); 18 months 
(P < 0.001); 24 months (P < 0.001); 36 months (P < 0.001)], amelioration for 
life quality [QoL scores improvement (P < 0.001); KPS improvement (P < 0.001); 
AFP improvement (P < 0.001)] and reduction of therapeutic toxicity [WBC decrease 
(P = 0.04); gastrointestinal adverse reactions (P < 0.001)]. In conclusion, 
traditional insect Chinese medicine and related preparations could be 
recommended as auxiliary therapy combined chemotherapy for HCC therapy.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
OBJECTIVE: Spinal metastasis can produce pain, deformity, neurological 
compromise and can decrease life expectancy. Surgical management is usually 
indicated for pain control, neurological decompression, and to avoid deformity 
progression. Tokuhashi et al created a scoring system to estimate survival and 
stratify surgical treatment based on established parameters. Our objective was 
to evaluate the usefulness of Tokuhashi scoring (TS) system by comparing the 
predicted and real survival times and analyze the survival time according to the 
type of tumor.
METHODS: From 2004 to 2014, 105 patients with vertebral metastasis who underwent 
surgical treatment were enrolled and retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative TS 
was performed in all cases. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to 
TS; group 1 (TS 0-8), group 2 (TS 9-11), and group 3 (TS 12-15). Patients' 
average age was 61.5 years, main primary tumor site were as follows: kidney 
(23%), lung (19%), and breast (18%).
RESULTS: The Tokuhashi general concordance was 67.6%. Per group concordance was 
as follows: group 1 80%, in group 2, only 33% of concordance was observed. In 
group 3, 100% of concordance was observed. In group 2, the most common primary 
sites were breast and kidney and the mean survival was 20 and 22.3 months, 
respectively, both longer than that expected for this group.
CONCLUSIONS: Tokuhashi concordance was acceptable in our study, particularly in 
lower and higher scores. The lesser concordance observed in group 2 (33.3%) was 
observed in almost all tumors. For our practice, TS constitutes an acceptable 
tool to define survival, particularly in lower and higher scores.

Over the last decades, life expectancy has significantly increased although 
several chronic diseases persist in the population, with aging as the leading 
risk factor. Despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment, many elderlies 
suffer from cardiovascular problems that are much more frequent in an older, 
more fragile organism. In the long term, age-related cardiovascular diseases 
(CVDs) contribute to the decline of quality of life and ability to perform 
normal activities of daily living. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small 
non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level 
in both physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we will focus 
on the role of miRNAs in aging and age-related CVDs as heart failure, 
hypertension, atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus. 
miRNAs are key regulators of complex biological mechanisms, representing an 
exciting potential therapeutic target in CVDs. Moreover, one major challenge in 
geriatric medicine is to find reliable biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and 
prediction of the response to specific drugs. miRNAs represent a very promising 
tool due to their stability in the circulation and unique signature in CVDs. 
However, further studies are needed to investigate their translational potential 
in the real clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, has demonstrated prolonged 
survival by 2.8 months as a second-line agent in patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) who progress on sorafenib therapy. The objective of the current 
study was to examine the cost effectiveness of regorafenib for the treatment of 
HCC.
METHODS: The authors constructed a Markov simulation model of patients with 
unresectable HCC and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis who received treatment with 
regorafenib versus best supportive care. Model inputs for regorafenib 
effectiveness and rates of adverse events in patients with HCC were based on 
published clinical trial data and literature review. Quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) were calculated along with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of regorafenib therapy. One-way sensitivity analyses also were conducted 
simultaneously on all model parameters and on various Monte-Carlo simulation 
parameters, and the regorafenib cost threshold at which cost effectiveness would 
be achieved was determined.
RESULTS: Regorafenib provided an increase of 0.18 QALYs at a cost of $47,112. 
The ICER for regorafenib, compared with best supportive care, was $224,362. In 
1-way sensitivity analyses, there were no scenarios in which regorafenib was 
cost effective. In cost threshold analysis, regorafenib would have to be priced 
at or below $67 per pill to be cost effective at an ICER of $100,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Regorafenib is not cost effective as a second-line agent in the 
treatment of HCC, with a marginal increase in QALYs at a high cost. Lowering the 
cost of regorafenib or improving the selection of patients who can achieve 
maximal survival benefit would improve its value as a second-line treatment 
option for patients with HCC. Cancer 2017;123:3725-3731. © 2017 American Cancer

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a safe and effective 
modality in patients with liver cancer who are ineligible for other local 
therapies. However SABR is not current standard of practice and requires further 
validation. Patient reported quality of life (QOL) is key to this validation, 
yet no systematic reviews to date have been performed to analyse QOL following 
liver SABR. QOL is a critical part of therapy evaluation, particularly in 
disease states with short life expectancy. The purpose of this study was to 
conduct a systematic review of QOL outcomes for liver SABR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from 1996 to October 2015 
were queried to obtain English language studies analysing QOL following liver 
SABR. Included studies described patient-reported QOL as either a primary or 
secondary endpoint, and analysed QOL change over time. Studies were screened, 
and relevant data were abstracted and analysed.
RESULTS: Of 2181 initially screened studies, 5 met all inclusion criteria. 
Extracted studies included a total of 392 eligible patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma, liver metastases and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Four studies
