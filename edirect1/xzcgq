BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures are of interest 
because they can be used to describe health of populations and represent a 
broader health outcome for population health analyses than mortality rates or 
life expectancy. The most widely used measure of HRQoL for deriving estimates of 
health-adjusted life expectancy is the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3). The 
HUI3 is available in most national surveys administered by Statistics Canada, 
and has been used as part of a microsimulation model to examine the impact of 
neurological conditions over the life course. Persons receiving home care and 
nursing home services are often not well-represented in these surveys; however, 
interRAI assessment instruments are now used as part of normal clinical practice 
in these settings for nine Canadian provinces/territories. Building on previous 
research that developed a HUI2 crosswalk for the interRAI assessments, the 
present study examined a new interRAI HRQoL index crosswalked to the HUI3.
METHODS: interRAI and survey data were used to examine the distributional 
properties of global and domain-specific interRAI HRQoL and HUI3 index scores, 
respectively. Three populations were considered: well-elderly persons not 
receiving home care, home care clients and nursing home residents.
RESULTS: The mean HUI3 and interRAI HRQoL index global scores declined from 
independent healthy older persons to home care clients, followed by nursing home 
residents. For the home care and nursing home populations, the interRAI HRQoL 
global estimates tended to be lower than HUI3 global scores obtained from survey 
respondents. While there were some statistically significant age, sex and 
diagnostic group differences in global scores and within attributes, the most 
notable differences were between populations from different care settings.
DISCUSSION: The present study provides strong evidence for the validity of the 
interRAI HRQoL based on comparisons of distributional properties with those 
obtained with survey data based on the HUI3. The results demonstrate the 
importance of admission criteria for home care and nursing home settings, where 
function plays a more important role than demographic or diagnostic criteria. 
The interRAI HRQoL has a distinct advantage because it is gathered as part of 
normal clinical practice in care settings where interRAI instruments are 
mandatory and are used to assess all eligible persons in those sectors. In 
particular, those with severe cognitive and functional impairments (who tend to 
be under-represented in survey data) will be evaluated using the interRAI tools. 
Future research should build on this work by providing direct, person-level 
comparisons of interRAI HRQoL index and HUI3 scores, as well as longitudinal 
analyses to examine responsiveness to change.

The humanized monoclonal antibody eculizumab (Soliris®) is a complement 
inhibitor indicated for use in anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) 
antibody-positive adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in the USA, 
refractory gMG in the EU, or gMG with symptoms that are difficult to control 
with high-dose IVIg therapy or PLEX in Japan. It is the first complement 
inhibitor to be approved for use in these patients. In the well-designed, 
26-week REGAIN study in patients with anti-AChR-positive refractory gMG, 
although a statistically significant benefit of eculizumab over placebo in the 
prespecified primary endpoint analysis (change from baseline in MG-activities of 
daily living (ADL) score assessed by worst-rank ANCOVA) was not formally 
demonstrated, preplanned and post hoc sensitivity analyses of this outcome, as 
well as other secondary outcomes supported the efficacy of eculizumab. Overall, 
patients receiving eculizumab experienced significant improvements in the ADL, 
muscle strength and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) parameters relative 
to patients receiving placebo. Moreover, an ongoing extension of REGAIN showed 
that treatment benefits with eculizumab were sustained during continued therapy 
for at least 52 weeks. Eculizumab was generally well tolerated in these studies, 
with a tolerability profile similar to that reported previously in other 
indications. Although several questions remain, such as duration of treatment, 
cost effectiveness and long-term efficacy and tolerability, current evidence 
indicates that eculizumab is a valuable emerging therapy for patients with 
refractory gMG.

BACKGROUND: Although ablation with focal impulse and rotor modulation (FIRM), as 
an adjunct to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), has been shown to decrease atrial 
fibrillation (AF) recurrence, cost-effectiveness has not been assessed.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of FIRM-guided ablation 
when added to PVI in a mixed AF population.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a Markov model to estimate the costs, 
quality-adjusted survival, and cost effectiveness of adding FIRM ablation to 
PVI. AF recurrence rates were based on 3-year data from the CONFIRM trial. Model 
inputs for event probabilities and utilities were obtained from literature 
review. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursement, wholesale acquisition costs, 
and literature review. Three-year total costs FIRM+PVI versus PVI alone were 
$27,686 versus $26,924. QALYs were 2.338 versus 2.316, respectively, resulting 
in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $34,452 per QALY gained. 
Most of the cost (65-81%) was related to the index ablation procedure. Lower AF 
recurrence generated cost offsets of $4,266, primarily due to a reduced need for 
medications and repeat ablation. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated 
ICER below $100,000/QALY in 74% of simulations.
CONCLUSION: Based on data from the CONFIRM study, the addition of FIRM to PVI 
does have the potential to be cost-effective due to higher quality-adjusted life 
years and lower follow-up costs. Value is sensitive to the incremental reduction 
in AF recurrence, and FIRM may have the greatest economic value in patients with 
greater AF symptom severity. Results from ongoing randomized trials will provide 
further clarity.

BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews suggest that school-based interventions can be 
effective in preventing childhood obesity, but better-designed trials are needed 
that consider costs, process, equity, potential harms and longer-term outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the 
WAVES (West Midlands ActiVe lifestyle and healthy Eating in School children) 
study intervention, compared with usual practice, in preventing obesity among 
primary school children.
DESIGN: A cluster randomised controlled trial, split across two groups, which 
were randomised using a blocked balancing algorithm. Schools/participants could 
not be blinded to trial arm. Measurement staff were blind to allocation arm as 
far as possible.
SETTING: Primary schools, West Midlands, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Schools within a 35-mile radius of the study centre and all year 1 
pupils (aged 5-6 years) were eligible. Schools with a higher proportion of 
pupils from minority ethnic populations were oversampled to enable subgroup 
analyses.
INTERVENTIONS: The 12-month intervention encouraged healthy eating/physical 
activity (PA) by (1) helping teachers to provide 30 minutes of additional daily 
PA, (2) promoting 'Villa Vitality' (interactive healthy lifestyles learning, in 
an inspirational setting), (3) running school-based healthy cooking 
skills/education workshops for parents and children and (4) highlighting 
information to families with regard to local PA opportunities.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the difference in body mass 
index z-scores (BMI-zs) between arms (adjusted for baseline body mass index) at 
3 and 18 months post intervention (clinical outcome), and cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (cost-effectiveness outcome). The secondary 
outcomes were further anthropometric, dietary, PA and psychological 
measurements, and the difference in BMI-z between arms at 27 months post 
intervention in a subset of schools.
RESULTS: Two groups of schools were randomised: 27 in 2011 (n = 650 pupils) 
[group 1 (G1)] and another 27 in 2012 (n = 817 pupils) [group 2 (G2)]. Primary 
outcome data were available at first follow-up (n = 1249 pupils) and second 
follow-up (n = 1145 pupils) from 53 schools. The mean difference (MD) in BMI-z 
between the control and intervention arms was -0.075 [95% confidence interval 
(CI) -0.183 to 0.033] and -0.027 (95% CI -0.137 to 0.083) at 3 and 18 months 
post intervention, respectively. The main analyses showed no evidence of 
between-arm differences for any secondary outcomes. Third follow-up included 
data on 467 pupils from 27 G1 schools, and showed a statistically significant 
difference in BMI-z (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.01). The mean cost of the 
intervention was £266.35 per consented child (£155.53 per child receiving the 
intervention). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with the base 
case was £46,083 per QALY (best case £26,804 per QALY), suggesting that the 
intervention was not cost-effective.
LIMITATIONS: The presence of baseline primary outcome imbalance between the 
arms, and interschool variation in fidelity of intervention delivery.
CONCLUSIONS: The primary analyses show no evidence of clinical effectiveness or 
cost-effectiveness of the WAVES study intervention. A post hoc analysis, driven 
by findings at third follow-up, suggests a possible intervention effect, which 
could have been attenuated by baseline imbalances. There was no evidence of an 
intervention effect on measures of diet or PA and no evidence of harm.
FUTURE WORK: A realist evidence synthesis could provide insights into contextual 
factors and strategies for future interventions. School-based interventions need 
to be integrated within a wider societal framework and supported by upstream 
interventions.

OBJECTIVES: Limited empirical attention has been devoted to individualized 
treatment objectives in intensive group therapy for personality dysfunction. 
This study investigated patients' ratings of distress associated with individual 
therapy goals - referred to as target object severity - in an intensive Evening 
Treatment Programme for patients with personality dysfunction.
DESIGN: Change in target objective severity was examined in a sample of 81 
patients who completed treatment in an intensive, integrative group therapy 
programme.
METHODS: Correlation and regression analyses were used to examine associations 
between change in target object severity and patients' pre-treatment diagnosis, 
symptom distress, and treatment outcome expectancy, and between change in target 
objective severity and patients' ratings of group therapy process (group 
climate, therapeutic alliance, group cohesion). The relationship between change 
in target objective severity and longer-range life satisfaction was also 
examined in a subsample of patients who rated life satisfaction at follow-up.
RESULTS: While change in target objective severity was not significantly related 
to pre-treatment variables, significant associations were found with several 
aspects of group therapy process. Patients' experience of a highly engaged group 
climate was uniquely associated with improvement in target object severity. Such 
improvement was significantly related to longer-term life satisfaction after 
controlling for general symptom change.
CONCLUSION: The working atmosphere in group therapy contributes to patients' 
progress regarding individual treatment targets, and such progress is an 
important factor in later satisfaction. Attention to individualized treatment 
targets deserves further clinical and research attention in the context of 
integrative group therapy for personality dysfunction.
PRACTITIONER POINTS: This study found that patients attending an integrative 
group treatment programme for personality dysfunction experienced significant 
improvement in severity of distress related to individual treatment objectives. 
Improvement in severity of distress related to individual treatment objectives 
was uniquely associated with patients' experience of an engaged, collaborative 
working atmosphere. Improvement in individual target objective severity was 
associated with patients' ratings of overall life satisfaction, rated an average 
of 9 months following termination, after controlling for change in general 
symptom severity.

BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement is crucial to assess the 
benefit of psychotherapeutic interventions. Is repeated assessment of 
psychometric self-report data possible, as inpatient palliative care patients 
suffer from physical and psychological symptoms? What is the self-perceived 
strain caused by the assessment? Objective The main objective of this study was 
to investigate the feasibility of a repeated comprehensive psychometric 
self-assessment of inpatient palliative care patients. Secondary objectives were 
the PROs of the psychometric assessment.
DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study. Patients admitted to our 
palliative care unit (PCU) were reviewed for eligibility within 72 hours. They 
were asked for weekly self-reports regarding hope (HHI-D), well-being 
(FACIT-Sp), anxiety and depression (STADI), and quality of life (QoL; 
EORTC-QLQ-C-30 single item). The strain caused by the assessment was assessed by 
a numeric rating scale (0-10) and free comments.
RESULTS: Within 11 months, 219 patients were admitted to the PCU. In total, 92 
patients were eligible. The most frequent exclusion criterion was "life 
expectancy <1 week." A total of 60 patients participated at the first point of 
measurement. The mean of self-perceived strain (Likert scale 0-10) due to the 
assessment was 1.44 (SD 1.99) at T1. Twenty-four patients participated twice. 
Here we found increased scores for physical well-being and QoL.
CONCLUSION: Repeated assessment of psychological conditions is feasible for 
27.4% of inpatients at a German PCU. The most limiting factor is life expectancy 
of only days at admission to the PCU. However, the self-perceived strain is low.

Electronic address: victor.e.grech@gov.mt.

INTRODUCTION: The sex ratio at birth (male divided by total live births: M/T) 
has been mooted as a potential sentinel health indicator. Several metrics 
indicate individual countries' health and socioeconomic status. In this study, 
in all available countries (where such data was accessible), M/T and these 
indicators were compared in order to ascertain whether better (vis-à-vis health 
and socioeconomic status) levels of these indicators were associated with higher 
M/T in available countries.
METHODS: The following were obtained (by country) from various sources: M/T, 
infant mortality rate, under 5 years mortality rate, fertility rate, Human 
Development Index, gross domestic product per capita, life expectancy for both 
sexes, females, males, as well as both sexes Health Adjusted Life Expectancy 
(HALE). Pearson correlation was performed comparing M/T and these indicators.
RESULTS: Despite weak correlation values, all except for the Human Development 
Index (HDI) correlated with M/T at statistically significant levels.
DISCUSSION: A decrease in mortality and an increase in life expectancy and 
GDP/capita are indicators of socioeconomic wellbeing. In this study, mortality 
was negatively correlated with M/T. Life expectancy and GDP/capita were both 
positively correlated with M/T, indicating that M/T may also serve as a 
surrogate health indicator, and incidentally, also supporting the 
Trivers-Willard hypothesis. Improving economies lead to increasing education, 
which in turns tends to lower fertility rate in association with a declining 
M/T. In conclusion, the global correlation of health and socioeconomic 
indicators with M/T suggests that M/T may be a useful sentinel health indicator.

Genetic factors underlying the human limb abnormality congenital talipes 
equinovarus ('clubfoot') remain incompletely understood. The spontaneous 
autosomal recessive mouse 'peroneal muscular atrophy' mutant (PMA) is a faithful 
morphological model of human clubfoot. In PMA mice, the dorsal (peroneal) 
branches of the sciatic nerves are absent. In this study, the primary 
developmental defect was identified as a reduced growth of sciatic nerve lateral 
motor column (LMC) neurons leading to failure to project to dorsal (peroneal) 
lower limb muscle blocks. The pma mutation was mapped and a candidate gene 
encoding LIM-domain kinase 1 (Limk1) identified, which is upregulated in mutant 
lateral LMC motor neurons. Genetic and molecular analyses showed that the 
mutation acts in the EphA4-Limk1-Cfl1/cofilin-actin pathway to modulate growth 
cone extension/collapse. In the chicken, both experimental upregulation of Limk1 
by electroporation and pharmacological inhibition of actin turnover led to 
defects in hindlimb spinal motor neuron growth and pathfinding, and mimicked the 
clubfoot phenotype. The data support a neuromuscular aetiology for clubfoot and 
provide a mechanistic framework to understand clubfoot in humans.

BACKGROUND: The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine 
the effect of diet on telomere length.
METHODS: We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, 
ISI Web of Science, and Scopus, as well as the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials and the National Institutes of Health, from inception to 
December 2016. Articles that assessed effects of diet on telomere length were 
included.
RESULTS: A total of 2,128 studies were identified, 30 were read in full, and 7 
were systematically reviewed. Five RCTs were included in the meta-analysis, 
covering 9 diets; a total of 533 participants were included. Study heterogeneity 
(I2) was 89%, and differences were not identified regarding average telomere 
lengths (mean difference 1.06; 95% CI -1.53 to 3.65).
CONCLUSION: The available evidence suggests that there is no effect of diet on 
telomere length, but the strong heterogeneity in the type and duration of 
dietary interventions does not allow any final statement on the absence of an 
effect of diet on telomere length.

BACKGROUND: Inequality in life expectancy (ILE) is defined as inequality in the 
distribution of expected span of life-based on data from survival tables 
estimated using the Atkinson inequality index. ILE can be influenced by 
socio-ecological indicators including the Gini coefficient, secondary education, 
output per worker, and old age pension. This study examined the effects on ILE 
from a social ecology perspective.
METHODS: This analysis is based on ILE data from 108 countries obtained from the 
United Nations Development Programme. Data on socio-ecological indicators were 
obtained from the United Nations database. The associations between 
socio-ecological indicators and ILE were assessed using correlation coefficients 
and multiple regression models.
RESULTS: Significant correlations were evident between ILE and the following 
indicators from a socio-ecological perspective: Gini coefficient (GC: r = 0.335, 
p = 0.001) as an indicator of income inequality, female population with at least 
some secondary education (FSE: r = - 0.757, p = 0.001), male population with at 
least some secondary education (MSE: r = - 0.741, p = 0.001), output per worker 
as a measure of labor productivity (OPW: r = - 0.714, p = 0.001), and number of 
old age pension recipients (OPR: r = - 0.641, p = 0.001). In multivariate 
regression, the ILE predictors were higher GC and lower levels of FSE, MSE, OPW, 
and OPR (R2 = 0.648, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Socio-ecological factors have an important effect on ILE. Policies 
that address ILE should consider targeted socio-ecological factors, such as the 
Gini coefficient of income inequality, that give a personal perspective of 
economic deprivation, attainment of at least a secondary education by both 
females and males that gives a social environment perspective, output per worker 
that indicates labor productivity, and the number of old age pension recipients 
that indicates social security from a public policy perspective.

Waste causes environmental pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when it 
is not managed sustainably. In Bangladesh, municipal organic waste (MOW) is 
partially collected and landfilled. Thus, it causes deterioration of the 
environment urging a recycle-oriented waste management system. In this study, we 
propose a waste management system through pyrolysis of selective MOW for biochar 
production and composting of the remainder with biochar as an additive. We 
estimated the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) 
recycling potentials in the new techniques of waste management. Waste generation 
of a city was calculated using population density and per capita waste 
generation rate (PWGR). Two indicators of economic development, i.e., gross 
domestic product (GDP) and per capita gross national income (GNI) were used to 
adopt PWGR with a projected contribution of 5-20% to waste generation. The 
projected PWGR was then validated with a survey. The waste generation from urban 
areas of Bangladesh in 2016 was estimated between 15,507 and 15,888 t day-1 with 
a large share (∼75%) of organic waste. Adoption of the proposed system could 
produce 3936 t day-1 biochar blended compost with an annual return of US $210 
million in 2016 while it could reduce GHG emission substantially (-503 CO2 e t-1 
municipal waste). Moreover, the proposed system would able to recover ∼46%, 54%, 
54% and 61% of total C, N, P and K content in the initial waste, respectively. 
We also provide a projection of waste generation and nutrient recycling 
potentials for the year 2035. The proposed method could be a self-sustaining 
policy option for waste management as it would generate ∼US$51 from each tonne 
of waste. Moreover, a significant amount of nutrients can be recycled to 
agriculture while contributing to the reduction in environmental pollution and 
GHG emission.

Many ambush predators attack prey using rapid strikes, but these strikes are 
typically only anteriorly directed. However, a predator may attack laterally and 
posteriorly oriented prey if it can couple the strikes with rapid body 
reorientation. Here, we examined omnidirectional strikes in flattie spiders 
(Selenopidae), a group of sit-and-wait ambush predators found on open surfaces. 
These spiders attack prey throughout their entire peripheral range using rapid 
strikes that consist of rapid translation and rotation toward the prey. These 
spiders ambush with radially oriented, long, laterigrade legs in a ready-to-fire 
status. Once prey is detected, the spider maneuvers toward it using a single 
flexion of the legs closest to the prey, which is assisted by 0-3 extension 
strides by the contralateral legs. The within-stance joint actions by a few legs 
generate a large resultant force directed toward the prey and a large turning 
moment. Furthermore, the turning speed is enhanced by rapid midair leg 
adductions, which effectively reduce the spider's moment of inertia during 
angular acceleration. Our results demonstrate a novel hunting behavior with high 
maneuverability that is generated with effectively controlled reconfigurations 
of long, laterigrade legs. These results provide insights for understanding the 
diversity of animal legs and developing highly maneuverable multi-legged robots.

INTRODUCTION: Traditional and transcatheter surgical treatments of severe aortic 
valve stenosis (SAVS) are increasing in parallel with the improved life 
expectancy. Recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported comparable or 
non-inferior mortality with transcatheter treatments compared with traditional 
surgery. However, RCTs have the limitation of being a mirror of the predefined 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, without reflecting the 'real clinical world'. 
Technological improvements have recently allowed the development of minimally 
invasive surgical accesses and the use of sutureless valves, but their impact on 
the clinical scenario is difficult to assess because of the monocentric design 
of published studies and limited sample size. A prospective multicentre registry 
including all patients referred for a surgical treatment of SAVS (traditional, 
through full sternotomy; minimally invasive; or transcatheter; with both 
'sutured' and 'sutureless' valves) will provide a 'real-world' picture of 
available results of current surgical options and will help to clarify the 'grey 
zones' of current guidelines.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: European Aortic Valve Registry is a prospective 
observational open registry designed to collect all data from patients admitted 
for SAVS, with or without coronary artery disease, in 16 cardiac surgery centres 
located in six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and UK). 
Patients will be enrolled over a 2-year period and followed up for a minimum of 
5 years to a maximum of 10 years after enrolment. Outcome definitions are 
concordant with Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria and established 
guidelines. Primary outcome is 5-year all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes 
aim at establishing 'early' 30-day all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, as 
well as major morbidity, and 'late' cardiovascular mortality, major morbidity, 
structural and non-structural valve complications, quality of life and 
echocardiographic results.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol is approved by local ethics 
committees. Any formal presentation or publication of data will be considered as 
a joint publication by the participating physician(s) and will follow the 
recommendations of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for 
authorship.

In neuronal development, dynamic rearrangement of actin promotes axonal growth 
cone extension, and spatiotemporal translation of local mRNAs in response to 
guidance cues directs axonal growth cone steering, where cofilin plays a 
critical role. While regulation of cofilin activity is well studied, regulatory 
mechanism for cofilin mRNA translation in neurons is unknown. In eukaryotic 
cells, proteins can be synthesized by cap-dependent or cap-independent mechanism 
via internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation. IRES-mediated 
translation has been reported in various pathophysiological conditions, but its 
role in normal physiological environment is poorly understood. Here, we report 
that 5'UTR of cofilin mRNA contains an IRES element, and cofilin is 
predominantly translated by IRES-mediated mechanism in neurons. Furthermore, we 
show that IRES-mediated translation of cofilin is required for both axon 
extension and axonal growth cone steering. Our results provide new insights into 
the function of IRES-mediated translation in neuronal development.

Should frail older adults be in long-term care facilities?

Sørbye LW(1), Sverdrup S(1), Pay BB(1).

Author information:

AIM: Home-based nursing care is relatively easy to access in Norway compared to 
the rest of Europe, and the threshold for applying for assistance is relatively 
low. The aim of the present study was to analyze factors that enable frail older 
adults to live in their own homes, with a low level of care burden stress.
METHODOLOGY: In 2015 and 2016, eight municipalities from different parts of 
Norway participated in a cross-sectional study. The quantitative part of the 
project consisted of assessing care of 71 older adults, aged ≥80 years, using a 
geriatric comprehensive assessment. The qualitative part consisted of 
semistructured telephone interviews with 14 leaders of nursing homes and 
home-based nursing care and interviews with 26 close relatives.
RESULTS: In this sample, 60% of the older adults were living alone, and 79% were 
at risk of permanent nursing home admission; 31% stated that they would be 
better-off at a higher caring level, mainly due to living alone. The relatives, 
their resources, and motivation to provide care seemed to be crucial for how 
long older adults with heavy care burden could stay at home. The municipalities 
offered a combination of comprehensive home care, day centers, and revolving 
short-term stays to enable them to live at home.
CONCLUSION: The results reveal that the need for home care services is steadily 
increasing. The relatives are coping with the physical care, far better than the 
uncertainties and worries about what could happen when the older adults stay 
alone. The number of beds in institutional care in each municipality depends on 
various factors, such as the inhabitants' life expectancy, social aspects, 
geography, well-functioning eldercare pathways, competence of the health 
professionals, and a well-planned housing policy.

BACKGROUND: Metrics to measure the burden of surgical conditions, such as 
disability weights (DWs), are poorly defined, particularly for pediatric 
conditions. To summarize the literature on DWs of children's surgical 
conditions, we performed a systematic review of disability weights of pediatric 
surgical conditions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
METHOD: For this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE for pediatric surgery 
cost-effectiveness studies in LMICs, published between January 1, 1996, and 
April 1, 2017. We also included DWs found in the Global Burden of Disease 
studies, bibliographies of studies identified in PubMed, or through expert 
opinion of authors (ES and HR).
RESULTS: Out of 1427 publications, 199 were selected for full-text analysis, and 
30 met all eligibility criteria. We identified 194 discrete DWs published for 66 
different pediatric surgical conditions. The DWs were primarily derived from the 
Global Burden of Disease studies (72%). Of the 194 conditions with reported DWs, 
only 12 reflected pre-surgical severity, and 12 included postsurgical severity. 
The methodological quality of included studies and DWs for specific conditions 
varied greatly.
INTERPRETATION: It is essential to accurately measure the burden, 
cost-effectiveness, and impact of pediatric surgical disease in order to make 
informed policy decisions. Our results indicate that the existing DWs are 
inadequate to accurately quantify the burden of pediatric surgical conditions. A 
wider set of DWs for pediatric surgical conditions needs to be developed, taking 
into account factors specific to the range and severity of surgical conditions.

Refrigeration, cryopreservation and pathogen inactivation: an updated 
perspective on platelet storage conditions.

Conventional storage of platelet concentrates limits their shelf life to between 
5 and 7 days due to the risk of bacterial proliferation and the development of 
the platelet storage lesion. Cold storage and cryopreservation of platelets may 
facilitate extension of the shelf life to weeks and years, and may also provide 
the benefit of being more haemostatically effective than conventionally stored 
platelets. Further, treatment of platelet concentrates with pathogen 
inactivation systems reduces bacterial contamination and provides a safeguard 
against the risk of emerging and re-emerging pathogens. While each of these 
alternative storage techniques is gaining traction individually, little work has 
been done to examine the effect of combining treatments in an effort to further 
improve product safety and minimize wastage. This review aims to discuss the 
benefits of alternative storage techniques and how they may be combined to 
alleviate the problems associated with conventional platelet storage.
