Heart failure (HF) hospitalisations due to decompensation are associated with 
shorter life expectancy and lower quality of life. These hospitalisations pose a 
significant burden on the patients, doctors and healthcare resources. Early 
detection of an upcoming episode of decompensation may facilitate timely 
optimisation of the ambulatory medical treatment and thereby prevent 
heart-failure-related hospitalisations. The HeartLogicTM algorithm combines data 
from five sensors of cardiac implantable electronic devices into a cumulative 
index value. It has been developed for early detection of fluid retention in 
heart failure patients. This review aims to provide an overview of the current 
literature and experience with the HeartLogicTM algorithm, illustrate how the 
index can be implemented in daily clinical practice and discuss ongoing studies 
and potential future developments of interest.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a peptide hormone with tremendous therapeutic 
potential for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the short half-life of 
its native form is a significant drawback. We previously prolonged the plasma 
half-life of GLP-1 via site-specific conjugation of human serum albumin (HSA) at 
position 16 of recombinant GLP-1 using site-specific incorporation of 
p-azido-phenylalanine (AzF) and strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition 
(SPAAC). However, the resulting conjugate GLP1_8G16AzF-HSA showed only moderate 
in vivo glucose-lowering activity, probably due to perturbed interactions with 
GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) caused by the albumin-linker. To identify 
albumin-conjugated GLP-1 variants with enhanced in vivo glucose-lowering 
activity, we investigated the conjugation of HSA to a C-terminal region of GLP-1 
to reduce steric hindrance by the albumin-linker using two different conjugation 
chemistries. GLP-1 variants GLP1_8G37AzF-HSA and GLP1_8G37C-HSA were prepared 
using SPAAC and Michael addition, respectively. GLP1_8G37C-HSA exhibited a 
higher glucose-lowering activity in vivo than GLP1_8G16AzF-HSA, while 
GLP1_8G37AzF-HSA did not. Another GLP-1 variant, GLP1_8A37C-HSA, had a glycine 
to alanine mutation at position 8 and albumin at its C-terminus and exhibited in 
vivo glucose-lowering activity comparable to that of GLP1_8G37C-HSA, despite a 
moderately shorter plasma half-life. These results showed that site-specific HSA 
conjugation to the C-terminus of GLP-1 via Michael addition could be used to 
generate GLP-1 variants with enhanced glucose-lowering activity and prolonged 
plasma half-life in vivo.

The parametric model introduced by Lee and Carter in 1992 for modeling mortality 
rates in the USA was a seminal development in forecasting life expectancies and 
has been widely used since then. Different extensions of this model, using 
different hypotheses about the data, constraints on the parameters, and 
appropriate methods have led to improvements in the model's fit to historical 
data and the model's forecasting of the future. This paper's main objective is 
to evaluate if differences between models are reflected in different mortality 
indicators' forecasts. To this end, nine sets of indicator predictions were 
generated by crossing three models and three block-bootstrap samples with each 
of size fifty. Later the predicted mortality indicators were compared using 
functional ANOVA. Models and block bootstrap procedures are applied to Spanish 
mortality data. Results show model, block-bootstrap, and interaction effects for 
all mortality indicators. Although it was not our main objective, it is 
essential to point out that the sample effect should not be present since they 
must be realizations of the same population, and therefore the procedure should 
lead to samples that do not influence the results. Regarding significant model 
effect, it follows that, although the addition of terms improves the adjustment 
of probabilities and translates into an effect on mortality indicators, the 
model's predictions must be checked in terms of their probabilities and the 
mortality indicators of interest.

Plantar heel pain is a common cause of foot pain that affects patients' quality 
of life and represents a significant cost for the healthcare system. Dry 
needling and percutaneous needle electrolysis are two minimally invasive 
treatments that were shown to be effective for the management of plantar heel 
pain. The aim of our study was to compare these two treatments in terms of 
health and economic consequences based on the results of a published randomized 
controlled trial. For this, we evaluated the costs from the point of view of the 
hospital and we carried out a cost-effectiveness study using quality of life as 
the main variable according to the Eq-5D-5L questionnaire. The cost of the 
complete treatment with dry needling (DN) was €178.86, while the percutaneous 
needle electrolysis (PNE) was €200.90. The quality of life of patients improved 
and was translated into +0.615 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for DN and 
+0.669 for PNE. PNE presented an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of €411.34/QALY against DN. These results indicate that PNE had a better 
cost-effectiveness ratio for the treatment of plantar heel pain than DN.

Opisthotonus refers to abnormal axial extension and arching of the trunk 
produced by excessive contractions of the paraspinal muscles. In childhood, the 
abnormal posture is most often related to dystonia in the setting of hypoxic 
injury or a number of other acquired and genetic etiologies. The condition is 
often painful, interferes with ambulation and quality of life, and is 
challenging to treat. Therapeutic options include oral benzodiazepines, oral and 
intrathecal baclofen, botulinum neurotoxin injections, and deep brain 
stimulation. Management of opisthotonus within the pediatric population has not 
been systematically reviewed. Here, we describe a series of seven children who 
presented to our institution with opisthotonus in whom symptom relief was 
achieved following administration of botulinum neurotoxin injections.

BACKGROUND: Intestinal failure (IF) is defined as reduction in functioning gut 
mass below the minimal amount necessary for adequate digestion and absorption. 
In most cases, IF results from intrinsic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract 
(digestive IF) (DIF); few cases arise from digestive vascular components, gut 
annexed (liver and pancreas) and extra-digestive organs or from systemic 
diseases (non-digestive IF) (NDIF). The present review revised etiology and 
treatments of DIF and NDIF, with special focus on the pathophysiological 
mechanisms, whereby NDIF develops.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search of published literature from 
January 2010 to the present by selecting the following search strings: 
"intestinal failure" OR "home parenteral nutrition" OR "short bowel syndrome" OR 
"chronic pseudo-obstruction" OR "chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction" OR 
"autoimmune enteropathy" OR "long-term parenteral nutrition".
RESULTS: We collected overall 1656 patients with well-documented etiology of IF: 
1419 with DIF (86%) and 237 with NDIF (14%), 55% males and 45% females. Among 
DIF cases, 66% had SBS and among NDIF cases 90% had malabsorption/maldigestion.
CONCLUSIONS: The improved availability of diagnostic and therapeutic tools has 
increased prevalence and life expectancy of rare and severe diseases responsible 
for IF. The present review greatly expands the spectrum of knowledge on the 
pathophysiological mechanisms through which the diseases not strictly affecting 
the intestine can cause IF. In view of the rarity of the majority of pediatric 
IF diseases, the development of IF Registries is strongly required; in fact, 
through information flow within the network, the Registries could improve IF 
knowledge and management.

Sustainable End-of-Life Management of Wind Turbine Blades: Overview of Current 
and Coming Solutions.

Mishnaevsky L Jr(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Wind Energy, Technical University of Denmark, 4000 Roskilde, 
Denmark.

Various scenarios of end-of-life management of wind turbine blades are reviewed. 
"Reactive" strategies, designed to deal with already available, ageing turbines, 
installed in the 2000s, are discussed, among them, maintenance and repair, 
reuse, refurbishment and recycling. The main results and challenges of 
"pro-active strategies", designed to ensure recyclability of new generations of 
wind turbines, are discussed. Among the main directions, the wind turbine blades 
with thermoplastic and recyclable thermoset composite matrices, as well as wood, 
bamboo and natural fiber-based composites were reviewed. It is argued that 
repair and reuse of wind turbine blades, and extension of the blade life has 
currently a number of advantages over other approaches. While new recyclable 
materials have been tested in laboratories, or in some cases on small or medium 
blades, there are remaining technological challenges for their utilization in 
large wind turbine blades.

Providing the conduit for treatment: The impact of vascular access and vein 
preservation in a 5-year-old child with prenatally diagnosed CRIM-negative 
Infantile Pompe disease.

Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive glycogen storage disorder resulting in 
progressive glycogen accumulation expressed in infancy with cardiomyopathy and 
skeletal myopathy. Without treatment by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), life 
expectancy is less than 2 years. The cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) 
positive or negative status is the basis for the response to ERT. CRIM-negative 
patients mount an immune response to ERT, making this the most dangerous 
presentation. The following case study describes the 5-year course of the first 
successful treatment of an in utero CRIM-negative Pompe disease patient with 
prophylactic immune tolerance induction (ITI) and administration of ERT given 
within the first 2 days of life followed by ultrasound guided vascular access 
that facilitated by bi-weekly infusions and extensive phlebotomy.

Increased life expectancy combined with the aging baby boomer generation has 
resulted in an unprecedented global expansion of the elderly population. The 
growing population of older adults and increased rate of age-related chronic 
illness has caused a substantial socioeconomic burden. The gradual and 
progressive age-related decline in hormone production and action has a 
detrimental impact on human health by increasing risk for chronic disease and 
reducing life span. This article reviews the age-related decline in hormone 
production, as well as age-related biochemical and body composition changes that 
reduce the bioavailability and actions of some hormones. The impact of hormonal 
changes on various chronic conditions including frailty, diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, and dementia are also discussed. Hormone replacement 
therapy has been attempted in many clinical trials to reverse and/or prevent the 
hormonal decline in aging to combat the progression of age-related diseases. 
Unfortunately, hormone replacement therapy is not a panacea, as it often results 
in various adverse events that outweigh its potential health benefits. 
Therefore, except in some specific individual cases, hormone replacement is not 
recommended. Rather, positive lifestyle modifications such as regular aerobic 
and resistance exercise programs and/or healthy calorically restricted diet can 
favorably affect endocrine and metabolic functions and act as countermeasures to 
various age-related diseases. We provide a critical review of the available data 
and offer recommendations that hopefully will form the groundwork for 
physicians/scientists to develop and optimize new endocrine-targeted therapies 
and lifestyle modifications that can better address age-related decline in 
heath.

The mature basal stipe of mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea loses wall extensibility. 
We found that an endo-β-1,3-glucanase ENG from C. cinerea could restore mature 
basal stipe wall extensibility via pretreatment such that the ENG-pretreated 
basal stipe walls could be induced to extend by chitinase ChiIII. ENG 
pretreatment released glucose, laminaribiose, and 3-O-D-gentiobiose-D-glucose 
from the basal stipe walls, consistent with ENG-digested products of 
β-1,6-branched β-1,3-glucan. Different effects of endo-β-1,3-glucanase ENG and 
exo-β-1,3-glucanase EXG pretreatment on the structure, amount and ratio 
(β-1,3-glucoside bonds to β-1,6-glucoside bonds) of products from the basal 
stipe and the apical stipe cell walls, respectively, and on the cell wall 
extensibility and the cell wall ultra-architecture of the basal stipes were 
analyzed. All results demonstrate that the more accumulation and cross-linkage 
of β-1,6-branched β-1,3-glucan with wall maturation lead to loss of wall 
extensibility of the basal stipe regions compared to the apical stipe cell 
walls.

Pancreatic cancer is still one of the most lethal cancers with a reported 5-year 
relative survival rate of approximatively 9% and medical treatment remains a 
major challenge. Systemic treatment is recommended in every setting: resectable, 
borderline resectable, locally advanced and metastatic. Yet, few groundbreaking 
changes in practice have occurred in the last 30 years compared to other cancers 
and new treatments options are highly desirable. Most treatment approaches using 
chemotherapy have failed to improve patients' life expectancy and the few 
therapies finally found to have statistically significant benefit actually have 
modest clinical impact. It is becoming imperative to find new paths for 
improvement, such as encapsulated agents, new generation targeted therapies and 
treatments directed against the tumor microenvironment. We report here the new 
drugs of interest in pancreatic cancer and analyze the most recent failures.

BACKGROUND: Major trauma has been one of the leading causes of morbidity, 
mortality, and functional disability, resulting in substantial societal burden. 
The aim of this study was to estimate the trends in burden of adult major trauma 
in Taiwan during 2003-2015.
METHODS: Adult patients with initial encounter of major trauma (injury severity 
score ≥ 16) were abstracted from the claim data of National Health Insurance 
(NHI) in Taiwan from January 2003 to December 2015. We explored the trends of 
incidence and mortality rates over time stratified by age and sex, as well as 
life expectancy (LE), loss-of-LE, lifetime healthcare expenditure and total 
loss-of-LE compared with age, sex and calendar-year matched referents simulated 
from the vital statistics of Taiwan.
RESULTS: A total of 71,731 cases of adult major trauma, and an estimated loss of 
979,676 life-years were found with an increasing trend in cumulative incidence 
rate (CIR18-84) during 2003-2015. The incidence rates were significantly higher 
in men than women. For both sexes, the incidence rates for those aged 65 and 
above were about 2-3 times higher than those of all other age groups. The 
one-year case fatality rates among the elderly were about 31-61%, higher than 
all other ages. The lifetime healthcare expenditures per person were 47,616 USD 
in men and 43,416 USD in women.
CONCLUSION: There is a consistently increasing trend in incidence and mortality 
of major trauma in Taiwan, especially among elderly people. For Taiwan, an aged 
society beginning since 2018, the challenge should be tackled more effectively 
in the coming decades.

OTTER, a new method quantifying absolute amounts of tRNAs.

To maintain optimal proteome, both codon choice of each mRNA and supply of 
aminoacyl-tRNAs are two principal factors in translation. Recent reports have 
revealed that the amounts of tRNAs in cells are more dynamic than we had 
expected. High-throughput methods such as RNA-Seq and microarrays are versatile 
for comprehensive detection of changes in individual tRNA amounts, but they 
suffer from inability to assess signal production efficiencies of individual 
tRNA species. Thus, they are not the perfect choice to measure absolute amounts 
of tRNAs. Here, we introduce a novel method for this purpose, termed 
Oligonucleotide-directed Three-prime Terminal Extension of RNA (OTTER), which 
employs fluorescence-labeling at the 3'-terminus of a tRNA by optimized reverse 
primer extension and an assessment step of each labeling efficiency by northern 
blotting. Using this method, we quantified the absolute amounts of the 34 
individual and 4 pairs of isoacceptor tRNAs out of the total 42 nuclear-encoded 
isoacceptors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that the amounts of 
tRNAs in log phase yeast cells grown in a rich glucose medium range from 0.030 
to 0.73 pmol/µg RNA. The tRNA amounts seem to be altered at the isoacceptor 
level by a few folds in response to physiological growing conditions. The data 
obtained by OTTER are poorly correlated with those by simple RNA-Seq, marginally 
with those by microarrays and by microscale thermophoresis. However, the OTTER 
data showed good agreement with the data obtained by 2D-gel analysis of in vivo 
radiolabeled RNAs. Thus, OTTER is a suitable method for quantifying absolute 
amounts of tRNAs at the level of isoacceptor resolution.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Atezolizumab is an anti-programmed death ligand 1 
(PD-L1) antibody that shows good safety and efficacy for patients with 
PD-L1-positive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The cost of atezolizumab 
therapy is expensive, and its economic burden is an important problem. In this 
study, we evaluated the cost effectiveness of atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel 
therapy (AnP) compared with nab-paclitaxel monotherapy (nP) for PD-L1-positive 
TNBC under Japanese medical conditions and environments using a Markov model.
METHODS: The medical information was collected from data published by the 
IMpassion130 trial. A Markov model was established to simulate the number of 
patients in each disease state after AnP or nP therapy during each time period. 
As indices for cost effectiveness, total cost, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was used to assess the uncertainty of 
the model using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations with difference parameters.
RESULTS: The QALYs for AnP treatment were longer than for nP treatment (1.12 vs 
0.82 QALYs), but the total cost of AnP treatment was more expensive than that of 
nP treatment (¥11,070,143 vs ¥2,056,164). The ICER values comparing AnP 
treatment with nP treatment were ¥30,208,143/QALY. The ICER/QALY was more 
expensive than the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of ¥15,000,000 per QALY. To achieve 
a 50% cost-effective probability with a WTP threshold, the price of the 
atezolizumab should be reduced by 55.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: AnP was not cost effective compared to nP for PD-L1-positive 
inoperable TNBC under the Japanese condition.

Transplant candidates should undergo an assessment of their mental health, 
social support, lifestyle, and behaviors. The primary aims of this "psychosocial 
evaluation" are to ensure that transplantation is of benefit to life expectancy 
and quality of life, and to allow optimization of the candidate and transplant 
outcomes. The content of psychosocial evaluations is informed by evidence 
regarding pretransplant psychosocial predictors of transplant outcomes. This 
review summarizes the current literature on pretransplant psychosocial 
predictors of transplant outcomes across differing solid organ transplants and 
discusses the limitations of existing research. Pretransplant depression, 
substance misuse, and nonadherence are associated with poorer posttransplant 
outcomes. Depression, smoking, and high levels of prescription opioid use are 
associated with reduced posttransplant survival. Pretransplant nonadherence is 
associated with posttransplant rejection, and nonadherence may mediate the 
effects of other psychosocial variables such as substance misuse. There is 
evidence to suggest that social support is associated with likelihood of 
substance misuse relapse after transplantation, but there is a lack of 
consistent evidence for an association between social support and posttransplant 
adherence, rejection, or survival across all organ transplant types. 
Psychosocial evaluations should be undertaken by a trained individual and should 
comprise multiple consultations with the transplant candidate, family members, 
and healthcare professionals. Tools exist that can be useful for guiding and 
standardizing assessment, but research is needed to determine how well scores 
predict posttransplant outcomes. Few studies have evaluated interventions 
designed to improve psychosocial functioning specifically pretransplant. We 
highlight the challenges of carrying out such research and make recommendations 
regarding future work.

Global average life expectancy continues to rise. As aging increases the 
likelihood of frailty, which encompasses metabolic, musculoskeletal, and 
cognitive deficits, there is a need for effective anti-aging treatments. It is 
well established in model organisms that dietary restriction (DR), such as 
caloric restriction or protein restriction, enhances health and lifespan. 
However, DR is not widely implemented in the clinic due to patient compliance 
and its lack of mechanistic underpinnings. Thus, the present study tested the 
effects of a somewhat more clinically applicable and adoptable DR regimen, 
every-other-day (EOD) intermittent fasting, on frailty in 20-month-old male and 
female C57BL/6 mice. Frailty was determined by a series of metabolic, 
musculoskeletal, and cognitive tasks performed prior to and toward the end of 
the 2.5-month dietary intervention. Late-life EOD fasting attenuated overall 
energy intake, hypothalamic inflammatory gene expression, and frailty in males. 
However, it failed to reduce overall caloric intake and had a little positive 
effect in females. Given that the selected benefits of DR are dependent on 
augmented production of the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and that 
renal H2S production declines with age, we tested the effects of EOD fasting on 
renal H2S production capacity and its connection to frailty in males. EOD 
fasting boosted renal H2S production, which positively correlated with 
improvements in multiple components of frailty tasks. Therefore, late-life 
initiated EOD fasting is sufficient to reduce aging-related frailty, at least in 
males, and suggests that renal H2S production capacity may modulate the effects 
of late-life EOD fasting on frailty.

OBJECTIVES: While the costs and outcomes of cochlear implantation (CI) have been 
widely assessed, most of these analyses were solely performed from the 
perspective of healthcare costs. This study assesses the costs and benefits of 
CI in the Netherlands from a broader societal perspective, including health 
outcomes, healthcare cost, educational cost, and productivity losses and gains.
DESIGN: The cost and benefits of CI were analyzed in this cost-benefit analysis, 
in which a monetary value is put on both the resources needed and the outcomes 
of CI. The costs and benefits were analyzed by prototypical instances of three 
groups, representing the majority of cochlear implant patients: prelingually 
deaf children implanted at the age of 1, adults with progressive profound 
hearing loss implanted at the age of 40 and seniors implanted at the age of 70 
with progressive profound hearing loss. Costs and benefits were estimated over 
the expected lifetimes of the members of each group, using a Markov state 
transition model. Model parameters and assumptions were based on published 
literature. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: In all three patient groups, the total benefits of CI exceeded the 
total cost, leading to a net benefit of CI. Prelingually deaf children with a 
bilateral CI had a lifetime positive outcome net benefit of €433,000. Adults and 
seniors with progressive profound hearing loss and a unilateral CI had a total 
net benefit of €275,000 and €76,000, respectively. These results ensue from 
health outcomes expressed in monetary terms, reduced educational cost, and 
increased productivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on estimates from modeling, the increased healthcare costs 
due to CI were more than compensated by the value of the health benefits and by 
savings in educational and productivity costs. In particular, for children and 
working adults, the societal benefit was positive even without taking health 
benefits into account. Therefore, CI generates an advantage for both patients 
and society.

Tarsonemus bakeri Ewing (Acari: Tarsonemidae) is a species of mite commonly 
associated with citrus in many countries including the United States. A short 
report in 1942 suggested this species is phytophagous, but it has not been 
reported as a pest in citrus or any other crop since then. A single survey of 78 
orchards in three growing regions in California demonstrated that Tarsonemus 
spp. mites were only associated with leaf samples that had visible sooty mold. A 
seasonal population study in one citrus orchard showed that all life stages of 
Tarsonemus spp. were present year-round on leaves and fruit, with the population 
on fruit reaching a peak in December (59.7 ± 15.2 mites per fruit). Results from 
a food suitability study showed that the population declined sharply on both 
plastic and leaf substrate when the mites were not provided a supplementary food 
source. When supplementary food was provided in the form of Alternaria, 
honeydew, molasses, or combinations of these, mites survived and multiplied 
throughout the 29-d study, irrespective of the substrate. Tarsonemus bakeri were 
found on excised, decaying leaves collected from an orchard. These studies 
verify that Tarsonemus spp. are associated only with sooty mold in citrus 
orchards. T. bakeri populations cannot sustain themselves on leaf tissue alone, 
indicating that they are nondamaging to citrus and therefore need not be 
considered a phytosanitary concern by importing countries.

BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are the only eating disorders 
included in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) 2019, yet binge-eating disorder and other specified feeding or eating 
disorder (OSFED) are more prevalent. This study sought to estimate the 
prevalence and burden of binge-eating disorder and OSFED globally and present a 
case for their inclusion in GBD.
METHODS: We sourced studies from the GBD 2019 anorexia nervosa and bulimia 
nervosa epidemiological databases, two systematic reviews that included studies 
with epidemiological estimates of binge-eating disorder and OSFED, and experts 
in the field. Studies, published between Jan 1, 1998, and March 1, 2019, were 
included if they reported non-zero prevalence of two or more eating disorders 
(anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or OSFED) and 
diagnosed cases according to DSM-IV or DSM-5. The proportions of total eating 
disorder cases that met diagnostic criteria for each individual eating disorder 
were estimated via network meta-regression and simulation using studies 
reporting eating disorder prevalence. The global cases unrepresented in GBD 2019 
were estimated using the proportions from the simulation and the GBD 2019 eating 
disorder prevalence. Disability weights for binge-eating disorder and OSFED were 
then estimated along with disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Estimates are 
presented with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).
FINDINGS: 54 studies, of which 36 were from high-income countries, were included 
in the analysis. The number of global eating disorder cases in 2019 that were 
unrepresented in GBD 2019 was 41·9 million (95% UI 27·9-59·0), and consisted of 
17·3 million (11·3-24·9) people with binge-eating disorder and 24·6 million 
(14·7-39·7) people with OSFED (vs 13·6 million [10·2-17·5] people with eating 
disorders in GBD 2019). Together, binge-eating disorder and OSFED caused 3·7 
million (95% UI 2·0-6·5) DALYs globally, bringing the total eating disorder 
DALYs to 6·6 million (3·8-10·6) in 2019.
INTERPRETATION: Binge-eating disorder and OSFED accounted for the majority of 
eating disorder cases and DALYs globally. These findings warrant the inclusion 
of binge-eating disorder and OSFED in future iterations of GBD, which will bring 
the burden experienced by people living with these disorders to the attention of 
policy makers with the means to target this burden.

BACKGROUND: Antituberculosis-drug resistance is an important public health 
issue, and its epidemiological patterns has dramatically changed in recent 
decades. This study aimed to estimate the trends of multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis (MDR-TB), which can be used to inform health strategies.
METHODS: Data were collected from the Global Burden of Disease study 2017. The 
estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to assess the trends 
of MDR-TB burden at global, regional, and national level from 1990 to 2017 using 
the linear regression model.
RESULTS: Globally, the age-standardized rate (ASR) of MDR-TB burden including 
incidence, prevalence, death and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) had 
pronounced increasing trends from 1990 to 1999, with the EAPCs were 17.63 [95% 
confidence interval (CI): 10.77-24.92], 17.57 (95% CI 11.51-23.95), 21.21 (95% 
CI 15.96-26.69), and 21.90 (95% CI 16.55-27.50), respectively. Particularly, the 
largest increasing trends were seen in areas and countries with low and 
low-middle sociodemographic index (SDI). However, the trends in incidence, 
prevalence, death and DALYs of MDR-TB decreased globally from 2000 to 2017, with 
the respective EAPCs were - 1.37 (95% CI - 1.62 to - 1.12), - 1.32 (95% 
CI - 1.38 to - 1.26), - 3.30 (95% CI - 3.56 to - 3.04) and - 3.32 (95% CI - 3.59 
to - 3.06). Decreasing trends of MDR-TB were observed in most regions and 
countries, particularly that of death and DALYs in Slovenia were - 18.96 (95% 
CI - 20.82 to - 17.06) and -19.35 (95% CI - 21.10 to - 17.55), respectively. 
Whereas the pronounced increasing trends of MDR-TB occurred in Papua New Guinea, 
Singapore, and Australia.
CONCLUSIONS: The ASR of MDR-TB showed pronounced decreasing trends from 2000 to 
2017. However, the MDR-TB burden remains a substantial challenge to the TB 
control globally, and requires effective control strategies and healthcare 
systems.

BACKGROUND: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis incorporating recent 
phase III clinical trial (MONALEESA-7) data to evaluate the cost-effectiveness 
of ribociclib (RIB) as a first-line treatment for premenopausal women with 
hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-negative advanced breast cancer (ABC) from the United States healthcare 
payer perspective. In addition, because RIB has not been marketed in China, we 
identified the range of drug costs for which RIB could be considered cost 
effective from a Chinese healthcare system perspective.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of adding RIB to endocrine therapy over a lifetime. The 
clinical outcomes and utility data were obtained from published literature. 
Costs data were obtained from United States and Chinese official websites, and 
we determined the potential price for RIB in China based on its price in the 
United States. The main outcomes of this study were the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
RESULTS: The model projected that mean outcome was better with RIB and endocrine 
combined (3.83366 QALYs) than with endocrine therapy alone (2.71203 QALYs). In 
the United States, RIB and endocrine therapy cost an additional $604,960.06, 
resulting in an ICER of $539,357.95/QALY compared with endocrine monotherapy. 
Subgroup analyses indicated that, in China, the projected mean outcomes were 
better for RIB and endocrine therapy (6.37 QALYs) than for endocrine monotherapy 
(2.71 QALYs). The corresponding incremental costs were $224,731.88943. Thus, the 
ICER comparing RIB and endocrine therapy with endocrine therapy alone 
represented a $61,454.96/QALY gain.
CONCLUSION: Additional use of RIB is estimated to not be cost effective as a 
first-line treatment for premenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative ABC 
in the United States. A value-based price for the cost of RIB is less than 
$31.74/200 mg for China.
