PURPOSE: About half of unaffected BRCA1/2 carriers have a negative family 
history, confounding efforts toward presymptomatic carrier identification. 
Ovarian cancer is preventable for known carriers but is otherwise highly lethal. 
Cost-effectiveness and gains in life expectancy are important factors in 
evaluating the desirability of population-based genetic screening, currently the 
only viable strategy to identify carriers with unrevealing family histories.
METHODS: Cost-utility analysis for a population-based genetic screening program 
offered to American Ashkenazi Jewish women aged 35-55 years measuring cancer 
incidence, life expectancy, and cost.
RESULTS: Our model predicts that a genetic screening program would result in 
2811 fewer cases of ovarian cancer, with a life expectancy gain of 1.83 
quality-adjusted life years among carriers. At a cost of 460 USD for founder 
mutation testing, the cost of the program is 8300 USD(discounted) per year of 
quality-adjusted life gained.
CONCLUSION: In populations with a high prevalence of BRCA1/2 founder mutations, 
genetic screening may be cost-effective when compared with recommended public 
health interventions such as mammographic screening. We advocate the initiation 
of a dialogue among Jewish stakeholders, genetics professionals, and public 
health leaders to determine whether a population-based BRCA1/2 genetic screening 
program should be pursued.

hepatitis B: an updated systematic review and economic evaluation.

OBJECTIVE: To update and extend a 2006 report on the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) and pegylated interferon alpha 
(PEG-alpha) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB).
DATA SOURCES: Thirteen bibliographic databases were searched including MEDLINE, 
EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Searches were run from the beginning of 2005 to 
September 2007.
REVIEW METHODS: For the clinical effectiveness review, randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs) comparing ADV, PEG-alpha-2a and PEG-alpha-2b with currently 
licensed treatments for CHB, including non-pegylated interferon alpha 
(IFN-alpha) and lamivudine (LAM), were included. Outcomes included biochemical, 
histological and virological response to treatment, drug resistance and adverse 
effects. A systematic review of economic evaluations of antiviral treatments for 
CHB was conducted. The economic Markov model used in the 2006 report was updated 
in terms of utility values, discount rates and costs.
RESULTS: Of the 82 papers retrieved for detailed screening, eight RCTs were 
included. Three evaluated ADV, four evaluated PEG-alpha-2b and one (from the 
original literature search) compared PEG-alpha-2b plus LAM with PEG-alpha-2b 
monotherapy. No RCTs of PEG-alpha-2a were identified. One ADV trial showed a 
statistically significant difference between ADV and placebo in terms of ALT 
response and HBV DNA levels, favouring ADV. Following withdrawal of ADV, levels 
were similar to those in placebo patients. In the ADV versus ADV plus LAM trial, 
there was a statistically significant difference in favour of the combination 
treatment. In the PEG-alpha trials, there were statistically significant 
differences favouring PEG-alpha-2b plus LAM compared with either one of the 
drugs given as monotherapy. For the comparison between PEG-alpha-2b and 
IFN-alpha and the comparison between different staggered regimens of the 
commencement of PEG-alpha-2b and LAM, there were no statistically significant 
differences between groups. Four full economic evaluations were identified, in 
addition to one identified in the original report. Two assessed PEG-alpha-2a; 
the remainder assessed ADV. PEG-alpha-2a was associated with increased treatment 
costs and gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy. In a UK study, the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for PEG-alpha-2a was 10,444 pounds 
per QALY gained compared with LAM. Evaluations of ADV found that LAM monotherapy 
was dominated; the ICER for ADV monotherapy compared with 'doing nothing' was 
$19,731. The results of the updated analysis were generally robust to changes in 
deterministic sensitivity analysis. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the 
same sequence of treatments was identified as optimal. In a probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, PEG-alpha-2b had a probability of being cost-effective of 
79% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000 pounds per QALY, and 86% at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000 pounds per QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Both ADV and PEG-alpha are beneficial for patients with CHB in 
terms of suppressing viral load, reducing liver damage-associated biochemical 
activity, inducing HBeAg seroconversion, and reducing liver fibrosis and 
necroinflammation. The effects of long-term treatment with ADV are generally 
durable, with relatively low rates of resistance. In most cases, 
cost-effectiveness estimates were within acceptable ranges. Further research 
should assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of newer 
antiviral agents in relation to existing drugs, including the role of initiating 
treatment with combination therapy.

Anxious individuals tend to overestimate the probability that encounters with 
anxiogenic stimuli (CS) will be followed by aversive consequences (UCS). This 
study examined whether such (biased) UCS expectancies predict the persistence of 
PTSD symptoms. A total of 265 soldiers were recruited before a four-month 
deployment to Iraq in 2004. About 2-5 months after deployment, 171 (65%) 
soldiers completed self-report scales about adverse events in Iraq and PTSD 
symptoms, and a UCS expectancy task. In this task, participants were exposed to 
a series of deployment-related and deployment-unrelated (control) picture 
stimuli. For each trial, the participants indicated the subjective probability 
that a particular slide would be followed by an imminent loud noise. Around 15 
months after deployment, 130 (76%) soldiers completed surveys about PTSD 
symptoms again. Only a small group of participants had high levels of PTSD 
symptoms. Regression analyses showed that the level of PTSD symptoms at 15 
months was predicted by earlier PTSD symptoms, but also and independently by an 
enhanced UCS expectancy to deployment-related stimuli. The findings support the 
notion that UCS expectancy bias contributes to the persistence of PTSD symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyse premature deaths due to alcohol 
consumption in 2004 in Spain and its different Autonomous Communities.
DESIGN: Using data on deaths that can be attributed to alcohol consumption in 
2004 for Spain and its different Autonomous Communities, the Potential Years of 
Life Lost (PYLL) were calculated up to the age of 70 for each diagnostic 
category, by sex and 5-year age groups.
SETTING: Spain: 17 Autonomous Communities, Ceuta and Melilla.
PARTICIPANTS: Data on deaths that can be attributed to alcohol consumption in 
2004 for Spain and its different Autonomous Communities.
MEASUREMENTS: The number of PYLL, the percentage of PYLL, and average PYLL.
RESULTS: During 2004, 118,411 PYLL were lost, 4 times higher in males than in 
females, the average PYLL per death being attributable to alcohol was 22.6 years 
(ranging from 34.7 in Ceuta and 20.2 in Asturias). Acute causes (68% of the 
PYLL), and in particular unintentional accidents (47.9 of the PYLL), were the 
main causes that contributed to premature death related to alcohol consumption 
in Spain and in each of Spanish Autonomous Communities.
CONCLUSIONS: The estimation of the PYLL shows the great impact that alcohol 
consumption has on the premature death rate in Spain ant the Spanish Autonomous 
Communities. Given that alcohol consumption is an avoidable cause of death, the 
adoption of preventive measures aimed at reducing consumption, as well as the 
early detection and treatment of possible alcohol related problems is vital.

OBJETIVO: Analizar la mortalidad prematura relacionada con el consumo de alcohol 
2004 en España y en las diferentes comunidades autónomas (CC.AA.) españolas.
DISEÑO: Se partió de los datos de las muertes atribuibles al consumo de alcohol 
en 2004 para España y las distintas CC.AA.; a partir de éstos se calcularon los 
años potenciales de vida perdidos (APVP) hasta los 70 años para cada categoría 
diagnóstica, sexo y grupos quinquenales de edad.
EMPLAZAMIENTO: España: 17 CC.AA., Ceuta y Melilla.
PARTICIPANTES: Datos de defunciones según causa de muerte, desagregados por sexo 
y edad para cada una de las 17 CC.AA., Ceuta y Melilla.
MEDICIONES PRINCIPALES: Los APVP, el porcentaje sobre el total de APVP y la 
media de APVP por muerte atribuible al consumo de alcohol.
RESULTADOS: Durante 2004 se perdieron 118.411 APVP, 4 veces más en varones, y la 
media por cada muerte atribuible al consumo de alcohol fue de 22,6 años (34,7 
años en Ceuta y 20,2 años en Asturias). Las causas agudas (el 68,0% de los APVP) 
y en particular los accidentes no intencionales (el 47,9% de los APVP) son los 
que más contribuyen a la mortalidad prematura relacionada con el consumo de 
alcohol en España y las distintas CC.AA.
CONCLUSIONES: La estimación de los APVP pone de manifiesto el elevado impacto 
del consumo de alcohol en la mortalidad prematura en las CC.AA. españolas. El 
consumo de alcohol es una causa evitable de mortalidad y deberían adoptarse 
medidas de prevención para reducir la exposición al consumo, así como para 
detectar y tratar precozmente los posibles problemas relacionados con el consumo 
de alcohol.

BACKGROUND: To compare cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by 
influenza vaccination with or without pneumococcal vaccination in the elderly 
living in long-term care facilities (LTCFs).
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on Markov modelling over 5 years, 
from a Hong Kong public health provider's perspective, on a hypothetical cohort 
of LTCF residents aged > or = 65 years. Benefit-cost ratio (BCR) and net present 
value (NPV) of two vaccination strategies versus no vaccination were estimated. 
The cost and QALYs gained by two vaccination strategies were compared by 
Student's t-test in probabilistic sensitivity analysis (10,000 Monte Carlo 
simulations).
RESULTS: Both vaccination strategies had high BCRs and NPVs (6.39 and US$334 for 
influenza vaccination; 5.10 and US$332 for influenza plus pneumococcal 
vaccination). In base case analysis, the two vaccination strategies were 
expected to cost less and gain higher QALYs than no vaccination. In 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the cost of combined vaccination and 
influenza vaccination was significantly lower (p<0.001) than the cost of no 
vaccination. Both vaccination strategies gained significantly higher (p<0.001) 
QALYs than no vaccination. The QALYs gained by combined vaccination were 
significantly higher (p = 0.030) than those gained by influenza vaccination 
alone. The total cost of combined vaccination was significantly lower (p = 
0.011) than that of influenza vaccination.
CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccination with or without pneumococcal vaccination 
appears to be less costly with higher QALYs gained than no vaccination, over a 
5-year period, for elderly people living in LTCFs from the perspective of a Hong 
Kong public health organisation. Combined vaccination was more likely to gain 
higher QALYs with lower total cost than influenza vaccination alone.

Aging, Bethesda, MD 20892-9205, USA. tomse@mail.nih.gov

BACKGROUND: Although trouble sleeping is a common problem among women at 
mid-life, patterns in trouble sleeping relating to social and health-related 
risk factors are unclear. This analysis describes the dynamics of trouble 
sleeping among women at mid-life.
METHODS: The National Survey of Health and Development is a nationally 
representative study of births in 1946 in England, Scotland, and Wales followed 
up through mid-life. Multistate life table analysis utilised 893 women 
interviewed annually between ages 48 to 54 years.
RESULTS: Women spent an average of 2.6 years with trouble sleeping, and the 
average length of a continuous episode of trouble sleeping was 2.4 years. Among 
women who reported at least one episode, the average number of episodes was 1.5. 
Health-related risk factors at age 43 of number of physical conditions, anxiety 
and depression symptoms, use of prescription medication, and current or past 
trouble sleeping were related to increased total and per episode duration of 
trouble sleeping over the 7-year study interval and increased duration per 
episode. Differences associated with these risk factors ranged from 1.2 to 1.8 
years for duration over the study interval and 0.5 to 0.8 years per episode. 
There was no association between average number of episodes per woman reporting 
at least one episode and these health-related risk factors at age 43.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides support for association between increased 
duration of trouble sleeping, in total and per episode, and health risk factors 
at age 43, suggesting a long-term relationship between risk factors and sleep.

Comment in
    Haematologica. 2009 Dec;94(12):1641-4.

BACKGROUND: There are limited data on survival patterns among patients with 
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.
DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared the survival of 4,259 patients with monoclonal 
gammopathy of undetermined significance, collected from hematology outpatient 
units in Sweden, with the survival of the general population by computing 
relative survival ratios. We also compared causes of death in these patients 
with those in 16,151 matched controls.
RESULTS: One-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year relative survival ratios were 0.98 (95% CI 
0.97-0.99), 0.93 (0.91-0.95), 0.82 (0.79-0.84), and 0.70 (0.64-0.76), 
respectively. Younger age at diagnosis of the gammopathy was associated with a 
significantly lower excess mortality compared to that in older patients 
(p<0.001). The excess mortality among patients with gammopathy increased with 
longer follow-up (p<0.0001). IgM (versus IgG/A) gammopathy was associated with a 
superior survival (p=0.038). Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined 
significance had an increased risk of dying from multiple myeloma (hazards ratio 
(HR)=553; 95% CI 77-3946), Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (HR=infinity), other 
lymphoproliferative malignancies (6.5; 2.8-15.1), other hematologic malignancies 
(22.9; 8.9-58.7), amyloidosis (HR=infinity), bacterial infections (3.4; 
1.7-6.7), ischemic heart disease (1.3; 1.1-1.4), other heart disorders (1.5; 
1.2-1.8), other hematologic conditions (6.9; 2.7-18), liver (2.1; 1.1-4.2), and 
renal diseases (3.2; 2.0-4.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of decreased life expectancy in patients with 
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, which was most pronounced in 
the elderly and explained by both malignant transformation and non-malignant 
causes, is of importance in the understanding and clinical management of this 
disease. The underlying mechanisms may be causally related to the gammopathy, 
but may also be explained by underlying disease that led to the detection of the 
hematologic disease. Our results are of importance since they give a true 
estimation of survival in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined 
significance diagnosed in clinical practice.

Paget's disease of bone--becoming a rarity?

Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1020, New Zealand.

OBJECTIVES: Paget's disease is a chronic bone disorder of unknown cause. Recent 
studies have reported an unexplained reduction in both prevalence and disease 
severity. We undertook a radiographic survey to determine the current prevalence 
of Paget's disease in New Zealand (previously recognized as a high prevalence 
area).
METHODS: A total of 3350 plain abdominal radiographs taken in 2005-06 in 
subjects of European descent >54 years old were examined for Paget's disease. 
The results were compared with those of a similar survey from 1996-98. The 
medical record of affected subjects was examined to determine when the disease 
had been first recognized and the plasma ALP at that time.
RESULTS: Paget's disease was detected in 87 radiographs (2.6%). In 55 cases 
(63%), it was already known to have been present, for a mean 14 years 
beforehand. The newly recognized or 'incident' cases were significantly older 
(mean age 86 vs 67 years, P < 0.0001) and had milder disease (ALP 139 vs 239 
u/l, P < 0.0001) than the known cases. Compared with the 1996-98 survey, the age 
distribution of affected patients was shifted to the right, with a significantly 
lower proportion in the youngest age group (55-69 years, P < 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the secular trend of Paget's disease 
presenting later in life and in milder form, suggesting that there are important 
environmental determinants. The relatively few 'incident' cases are mostly in 
the very elderly. Given the secular trend and limitations to life expectancy, it 
is predicted that Paget's disease will become increasingly rare.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether non-invasive ventilation reduces mortality and 
whether there are important differences in outcome by treatment modality.
DESIGN: Multicentre open prospective randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Patients presenting with severe acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in 
26 emergency departments in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria were age > 16 years, clinical diagnosis of 
acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, pulmonary oedema on chest radiograph, 
respiratory rate > 20 breaths per minute, and arterial hydrogen ion 
concentration > 45 nmol/l (pH < 7.35).
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to standard oxygen therapy, continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP) (5-15 cmH2O) or non-invasive positive pressure 
ventilation (NIPPV) (inspiratory pressure 8-20 cmH2O, expiratory pressure 4-10 
cmH2O) on a 1:1:1 basis for a minimum of 2 hours.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point for the comparison between NIPPV or 
CPAP and standard therapy was 7-day mortality. The composite primary end point 
for the comparison of NIPPV and CPAP was 7-day mortality and tracheal intubation 
rate. Secondary end points were breathlessness, physiological variables, 
intubation rate, length of hospital stay and critical care admission rate. 
Economic evaluation took the form of a cost-utility analysis, taken from an NHS 
(and personal social services) perspective.
RESULTS: In total, 1069 patients [mean age 78 (SD 10) years; 43% male] were 
recruited to standard therapy (n = 367), CPAP [n = 346; mean 10 (SD 4) cmH2O] or 
NIPPV [n = 356; mean 14 (SD 5)/7 (SD 2) cmH2O]. There was no difference in 7-day 
mortality for standard oxygen therapy (9.8%) and non-invasive ventilation (9.5%; 
p = 0.87). The combined end point of 7-day death and intubation rate was 
similar, irrespective of non-invasive ventilation modality (CPAP 11.7% versus 
NIPPV 11.1%; p = 0.81). Compared with standard therapy, non-invasive ventilation 
was associated with greater reductions (treatment difference, 95% confidence 
intervals) in breathlessness (visual analogue scale score 0.7, 0.2-1.3; p = 
0.008) and heart rate (4/min, 1-6; p = 0.004) and improvement in acidosis (pH 
0.03, 0.02-0.04; p < 0.001) and hypercapnia (0.7 kPa, 0.4-0.9; p < 0.001) at 1 
hour. There were no treatment-related adverse events or differences in other 
secondary outcomes such as myocardial infarction rate, length of hospital stay, 
critical care admission rate and requirement for endotracheal intubation. 
Economic evaluation showed that mean costs and QALYs up to 6 months were 3023 
pounds and 0.202 for standard therapy, 3224 pounds and 0.213 for CPAP, and 3208 
pounds and 0.210 for NIPPV. Modelling of lifetime costs and QALYs produced 
values of 15,764 pounds and 1.597 for standard therapy, 17,525 pounds and 1.841 
for CPAP, and 17,021 pounds and 1.707 for NIPPV. These results suggest that both 
CPAP and NIPPV accrue more QALYs but at higher cost than standard therapy. 
However, these estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-invasive ventilatory support delivered by either CPAP or NIPPV 
safely provides earlier improvement and resolution of breathlessness, 
respiratory distress and metabolic abnormality. However, this does not translate 
into improved short- or longer-term survival. We recommend that CPAP or NIPPV 
should be considered as adjunctive therapy in patients with severe acute 
cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in the presence of severe respiratory distress or 
when there is a failure to improve with pharmacological therapy.

Tools for measuring outcomes in health and social care have become key parts of 
the processes of evaluation and setting priorities. Measures of output that can 
be used in all settings and specialties have the advantage that they facilitate 
comparisons and choices between and within patient groups. However, the most 
commonly used composite measure of outcomes, the quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) appears not to work well in complex interventions, such as palliative 
care, leading to the paradox that there is evidence that people would give 
priority to interventions and services that would be shown not to be 
cost-effective, using QALYs as an outcome measure. This article explores the 
possible reasons for this paradox, and looks at alternative approaches that may 
provide better tools for setting priorities within palliative care and for 
comparison of palliative and other care services.

OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the study was to estimate a preference-based 
Short Form (SF)-6D index from the SF-36 for Japan and compare it with the UK 
results.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The SF-6D was translated into Japanese. Two hundred 
and forty-nine health states defined by this version of the SF-6D were then 
valued by a representative sample of 600 members of the Japanese general 
population using standard gamble (SG). These health-state values were modeled 
using classical parametric random-effect methods with individual-level data and 
ordinary least squares (OLS) on mean health-state values, together with a new 
nonparametric approach using Bayesian methods of estimation.
RESULTS: All parametric models estimated on Japanese data were found to perform 
less well than their UK counterparts in terms of poorer goodness of fit, more 
inconsistencies, larger prediction errors and bias, and evidence of systematic 
bias in the predictions. Nonparametric models produce a substantial improvement 
in out-of-sample predictions. The physical, role, and social dimensions have 
relatively larger decrements than pain and mental health compared with those in 
the United Kingdom.
CONCLUSION: The differences between Japanese and UK valuations of the SF-6D make 
it important to use the Japanese valuation data set estimated using the 
nonparametric Bayesian technique presented in this article.

University, Syracuse, New York 31210, USA.

PURPOSE: Recent guidelines recommend that men older than 75 years should not be 
screened for prostate cancer. However, increased life expectancy and the 
development of less invasive treatments have led to an interest in 
characterizing prostate cancer in elderly men. We determined how prostate cancer 
pathological characteristics differ in men older vs younger than 70 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied differences in prostate cancer pathological 
characteristics in autopsied glands from men 70 years old or older and compared 
findings to those in men younger than 70 years. All men died of causes unrelated 
to prostate cancer. Prostates were whole mounted at 4 mm intervals. Histological 
analysis was done to identify and characterize each cancer focus observed. Tumor 
volume was measured by computerized planimetry. Cancer was defined as clinically 
significant or insignificant based on established histological characteristics.
RESULTS: Of 211 prostates evaluated 74 were from men 70 years old or older. We 
identified cancer in 33 men (45%) in this age group vs in 26 of 137 (19%) 
younger than 70 years (p <0.001). Men older than 70 years had significantly 
larger cancer and more clinically significant cancer (64% vs 23%, p <0.005). 
Older men had more advanced stage cancer and greater Gleason scores (p <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In an autopsy study of men with no history of prostate cancer those 
older than 70 years were more likely to have larger and higher grade prostate 
cancer than younger men.

Bridging gaps, expanding outreach: Metastatic Breast Cancer Advocacy Working 
Group Consensus Report. January 25, 2008.

MBC Advocacy Working Group.

It is estimated that approximately one-third of women diagnosed with early 
breast cancer will develop metastatic breast cancer (MBC) over the course of 
their disease. As advances have been made in the treatment of MBC, patients' 
life expectancy has increased and consequently more women are living with the 
disease. Many report feeling isolated in terms of the availability of resources, 
and the attention paid to MBC compared with early stage breast cancer. In order 
to identify the needs of patients with MBC, a group of 16 patient advocates from 
seven countries (the MBC Advocacy Working Group) met to share insights on the 
current obstacles facing women with MBC and discuss potential solutions for 
better addressing their unmet needs. The group compiled their findings into a 
Consensus Report, and the report and its recommendations are published here.

USA. jcristia@iadb.org

Are mortality and life expectancy differences by socioeconomic groups increasing 
in the United States? Using a unique data set matching administrative and survey 
data, this study explores trends in these differentials by lifetime earnings for 
the 1983-2003 period. Results indicate a consistent increase in mortality 
differentials across sex and age groups. The study also finds a substantial 
increase in life expectancy differentials by lifetime earnings: the 
top-to-bottom quintile premium increased 30 percent for men and almost doubled 
for women. These results complement recent research to point to almost five 
decades of increasing differential mortality in the United States.

Senior Services, Jefferson City, MO 65102-0570, USA. noaman.kayani@dhss.mo.gov

OBJECTIVE: We examined the financial and social costs resulting from traumatic 
brain injury (TBI) in Missouri.
METHODS: We computed mortality rates from death certificates, the direct cost of 
TBI from hospital and emergency department (ED) visit charges, the social cost 
in terms of years of potential life lost (YPLL) using an abridged Missouri life 
table, and the indirect financial cost in terms of lost productivity due to 
premature death for all TBI and four major causes of TBI in Missouri.
RESULTS: During 2001-2005, a mean of 1358 lives were lost due to TBI in 
Missouri. Four major causes-unintentional falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, 
motorcycle crashes, and firearms-accounted for 88% of all TBI deaths. We 
estimated the annual direct medical cost of TBI at $95 million, or about $1.67 
million per 100,000 Missourians. This cost increased by about 60% between 2001 
and 2005. The four major causes of TBI accounted for 68% of all direct medical 
costs of TBI. We estimated the cost per hospitalization and ED visit at $6948 
and the indirect social cost at 48,501 YPLL. During this period, the mean age of 
TBI fatality was 44 years. We determined the lost productivity due to TBI 
mortality--$1.1 billion, or about $18.8 million per 100,000 Missourians--to be 
three times as high for males as for females.
CONCLUSIONS: The types of costs covered in this study underestimated the total 
cost of TBI in Missouri, as we did not include outpatient care, rehabilitation, 
and drug costs. Nevertheless, we found the health and economic burden from 
medical care and mortality related to TBI to be substantial in Missouri.

96822, USA. parkc@hawaii.edu

OBJECTIVE: We examined differences among seven major ethnic groups in Hawaii in 
life expectancy at birth (e[0]) and mortality at broad age groups.
METHODS: We constructed life tables for 2000 for Caucasian, Chinese, Filipino, 
Hawaiian, Japanese, Korean, and Samoan ethnic groups in Hawaii. We partitioned 
overall mortality into broad age groups: <15 (representing premature mortality), 
15-65 (representing working age), and 66-84 and > or =85 (representing senescent 
mortality).
RESULTS: The overall e(O) in Hawaii was 80.5 years, but the difference between 
the longest-living group (Chinese) and the shortest-living group (Samoan) was 13 
years. Chinese had the lowest mortality rates in each age group except the > or 
=85 category. In this last age group, we observed anomalously low rates for some 
new immigrant groups (especially Samoan males) suggesting, as a cause, that 
elders in these immigrant groups may return to natal countries in their old age 
and die there. In the <15 age group, mortality rates for Samoans and Koreans 
were highest, especially for Korean girls, suggesting some continuance in the 
U.S. of a preference for boy children. Outside of these anomalies, ethnic 
differences in e(O) were likely explained by socioeconomic and behavioral 
variables known to affect mortality levels, which are closely associated with 
ethnicity in Hawaii.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the need to disaggregate Asian and Pacific 
Islander data, to conduct ethnic-specific research, and to address socioeconomic 
disparities.

Prevention of depression and anxiety in later life: design of a randomized 
controlled trial for the clinical and economic evaluation of a life-review 
intervention.

BACKGROUND: Depressive and anxiety symptoms in older adults could develop into 
significant health problems with detrimental effects on quality of life and a 
possibly poor prognosis. Therefore, there is a need for preventive interventions 
which are at once effective, acceptable and economic affordable.
METHODS AND DESIGN: This paper describes the design of a study evaluating "The 
stories we live by", a preventive life-review group intervention, which was 
recently developed for adults of 55 years and over with depressive and anxiety 
symptoms. Both clinical and economic effectiveness will be evaluated in a 
pragmatic randomized controlled trial. The participants in the intervention 
condition will receive the 8-session preventive intervention. The participants 
in the control condition will have access to usual care. Clinical end-terms are 
depressive and anxiety symptoms, current major depressive episode, quality of 
life and positive mental health post-treatment (3 months after baseline) and at 
follow-ups (6 and 12 months after baseline). Additional goals of this study are 
to identify groups for whom the intervention is particularly effective and to 
identify the therapeutic pathways that are vital in inducing clinical change. 
This will be done by analyzing if treatment response is moderated by 
demographics, personality, past major depressive episodes, important life events 
and chronically disease, and mediated by reminiscence functions, perceived 
control, automatic positive thoughts and meaning in life. Finally the 
cost-effectiveness of the intervention relative to care as usual will be 
assessed by computing incremental costs per case of depression and anxiety 
avoided (cost-effectiveness) and per quality adjusted life year (QALY) (cost 
utility).
DISCUSSION: It is expected that both the life-review intervention and its 
evaluation will contribute to the existing body of knowledge in several ways. 
First, the intervention is unique in linking life-review with narrative therapy 
and in its focus on specific, positive memories. Second, the evaluation is 
likely to answer questions regarding the acceptability and cost-effectiveness of 
life-review that have not been addressed thoroughly until now. Positive results 
of this study will make available a new evidence-based intervention to improve 
public health among people of 55 years and over.

The effectiveness of a training for patients with unexplained physical symptoms: 
protocol of a cognitive behavioral group training and randomized controlled 
trial.

BACKGROUND: In primary care, up to 74% of physical symptoms is classified as 
unexplained. These symptoms can cause high levels of distress and healthcare 
utilization. Cognitive behavioral therapy has shown to be effective, but does 
not seem to be attractive to patients. An exception herein is a therapy based on 
the consequences model, which distinguishes itself by its labeling of 
psychosocial distress in terms of consequences rather than as causes of physical 
symptoms. In secondary care, 81% of the patients accepts this therapy, but in 
primary care the outcome is poor. We assume that positive outcome can also be 
reached in primary care, when the consequences model is modified and used 
bottom-up in an easily accessible group training, in which patients are relieved 
of being blamed for their symptoms. Our aim is to investigate the 
(cost-)effectiveness of this training.
METHODS AND DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial is designed. One hundred 
patients are randomized to either the group training or the waiting list. 
Physicians in general practices and outpatients clinics of general hospitals 
refer patients. Referral leads to inclusion if patients are between 18 and 65 
years old, understand Dutch, have no handicaps impeding participation and the 
principal DSM-IV-TR classification is undifferentiated somatoform disorder or 
chronic pain disorder. In contrast to other treatment effect studies, the 
co-morbidity of a personality disorder does not lead to exclusion. By this, we 
optimize the comparability between the study population and patients in daily 
practice enlarging the generalization possibilities. Also in contrast to other 
effect studies, we chose quality of life (SF-36) instead of physical symptoms as 
the primary outcome measure. The SF-6D is used to estimate Quality Adjusted Life 
Years (QALYs). Costs are measured with the Trimbos/iMTA Questionnaire for Costs 
associated with Psychiatric Illness. Measurements are scheduled at baseline, 
after the training or waiting list, three and twelve months after the training. 
The differences between measurements are analyzed according to the 
intention-to-treat principle. The cost-effectiveness is expressed as costs per 
QALY, using multiple sensitivity analyses on the basis of a probabilistic model 
of the trial.
DISCUSSION: If we show that our group training is (cost-)effective, more 
patients could be served, their quality of life could be improved while costs 
might be reduced. As the training is investigated in a heterogeneous patient 
group in the daily practice of a mental healthcare institution, its transfer to 
practice should be relatively easy.

Comparison of biomarkers of oxidative stress and cardiovascular disease in 
humans and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).

In the oxidative stress hypothesis of aging, the aging process is the result of 
cumulative damage by reactive oxygen species. Humans and chimpanzees are 
remarkably similar; but humans live twice as long as chimpanzees and therefore 
are believed to age at a slower rate. The purpose of this study was to compare 
biomarkers for cardiovascular disease, oxidative stress, and aging between male 
chimpanzees and humans. Compared with men, male chimpanzees were at increased 
risk for cardiovascular disease because of their significantly higher levels of 
fibrinogen, IGF1, insulin, lipoprotein a, and large high-density lipoproteins. 
Chimpanzees showed increased oxidative stress, measured as significantly higher 
levels of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-deoxyuridine and 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha), a 
higher peroxidizability index, and higher levels of the prooxidants 
ceruloplasmin and copper. In addition, chimpanzees had decreased levels of 
antioxidants, including alpha- and beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, 
and tocopherols, as well as decreased levels of the cardiovascular protection 
factors albumin and bilirubin. As predicted by the oxidative stress hypothesis 
of aging, male chimpanzees exhibit higher levels of oxidative stress and a much 
higher risk for cardiovascular disease, particularly cardiomyopathy, compared 
with men of equivalent age. Given these results, we hypothesize that the longer 
lifespan of humans is at least in part the result of greater antioxidant 
capacity and lower risk of cardiovascular disease associated with lower 
oxidative stress.

Left ventricular assist device as destination therapy: application of the 
payment-by-results approach for the device reimbursement.

Messori A(1), Trippoli S, Bonacchi M, Sani G.

Author information:
(1)Laboratory of Pharmacoeconomics, University Hospital of Careggi, Firenze, 
Italy. andreamessori@interfree.it

OBJECTIVE: Value-based methods are increasingly used to reimburse therapeutic 
innovation, and the payment-by-results approach has been proposed for handling 
interventions with limited therapeutic evidence. Because most left ventricular 
assist devices are supported by preliminary efficacy data, we examined the 
effectiveness data of the HeartMate (Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA) device to 
explore the application of the payment-by-results approach to these devices and 
to develop a model for handling reimbursements.
METHODS: According to our model, after establishing the societal economic 
countervalue for each month of life saved, each patient treated with one such 
device is associated to the payment of this countervalue for every month of 
survival lived beyond the final date of estimated life expectancy without left 
ventricular assist devices. Our base-case analysis, which used the published 
data of 68 patients who received the HeartMate device, was run with a monthly 
countervalue of euro 5000, no adjustment for quality of life, and a baseline 
life expectancy of 150 days without left ventricular assist devices. Sensitivity 
analysis was aimed at testing the effect of quality of life adjustments and 
changes in life expectancy without device.
RESULTS: In our base-case analysis, the mean total reimbursement per patient was 
euro 82,426 (range, euro 0 to euro 250,000; N = 68) generated as the sum of 
monthly payments. This average value was close to the current price of the 
HeartMate device (euro 75,000). Sensitivity testing showed that the base-case 
reimbursement of euro 82,426 was little influenced by variations in life 
expectancy, whereas variations in utility had a more pronounced impact.
CONCLUSION: Our report delineates an innovative procedure for appropriately 
allocating economic resources in this area of invasive cardiology.

BACKGROUND: The results of international clinical trials that are assessing when 
to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) will not be available for several 
years.
OBJECTIVE: To inform HIV treatment decisions about the optimal CD4 threshold at 
which to initiate ART in South Africa while awaiting the results of these 
trials.
DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis by using a computer simulation model of HIV 
disease.
DATA SOURCES: Published data from randomized trials and observational cohorts in 
South Africa.
TARGET POPULATION: HIV-infected patients in South Africa.
TIME HORIZON: 5-year and lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Modified societal.
INTERVENTION: No treatment, ART initiated at a CD4 count less than 0.250 x 10(9) 
cells/L, and ART initiated at a CD4 count less than 0.350 x 10(9) cells/L.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Morbidity, mortality, life expectancy, medical costs, and 
cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: If 10% to 100% of HIV-infected patients are 
identified and linked to care, a CD4 count threshold for ART initiation of 0.350 
x 10(9) cells/L would reduce severe opportunistic diseases by 22,000 to 221,000 
and deaths by 25,000 to 253,000 during the next 5 years compared with ART 
initiation at 0.250 x 10(9) cells/L; cost increases would range from $142 
million (10%) to $1.4 billion (100%). Either ART initiation strategy would 
increase long-term survival by at least 7.9 years, with a mean per-person life 
expectancy of 3.8 years with no ART and 12.5 years with an initiation threshold 
of 0.350 x 10(9) cells/L. Compared with an initiation threshold of 0.250 x 10(9) 
cells/L, a threshold of 0.350 x 10(9) cells/L has an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $1200 per year of life saved.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Initiating ART at a CD4 count less than 0.350 x 
10(9) cells/L would remain cost-effective over the next 5 years even if the 
probability that the trial would demonstrate the superiority of earlier therapy 
is as low as 17%.
LIMITATION: This model does not consider the possible benefits of initiating ART 
at a CD4 count greater than 0.350 x 10(9) cells/L or of reduced HIV 
transmission.
CONCLUSION: Earlier initiation of ART in South Africa will probably reduce 
morbidity and mortality, improve long-term survival, and be cost-effective. 
While awaiting trial results, treatment guidelines should be liberalized to 
allow initiation at CD4 counts less than 0.350 x 10(9) cells/L, earlier than is 
currently recommended.
