unrelated regression) that included interactions between TNM stage, age, and 
surgical procedure to perform subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: The sample was composed of 1591 patients, 963 who underwent laparoscopy 
and 628 open surgery. Using propensity score and regression analysis, we found 
that laparoscopy was associated with more QALYs and less resource use than open 
surgery (0.0163 QALYs, 95% CI 0.0114-0.0212; and - €3461, 95% CI - 3337 to 
- 3586). Costs were lower for laparoscopy in all subgroups. In the subgroups 
younger than 80 years old, utility was higher in patients who underwent 
laparoscopy. Nevertheless, open surgery had better outcomes in older patients in 
stages I-II (0.0618 QALYs) and IV (0.5090 QALYs).
CONCLUSION: Overall, laparoscopy appears to be dominant, resulting in more QALYs 
and lower costs. Nevertheless, while laparoscopy required fewer resources in all 
subgroups, outcomes may be negatively affected in elderly patients, representing 
an opportunity for shared decision making between surgeons and patients.

In order to understand the effect of submergence on nutrient release of the 
reforested tree leaves and assess the environmental risk of leaf decomposition 
under submergence, the mass loss and nutrient release rates of three 
reforestation tree species, Taxodium ascendens Brongn, Taxodium distichum (L.) 
Rich., and Salix matsudana Koidz., at different elevation in the 
hydro-fluctuation zone of the Three Gorges Dam Reservoir (TGDR) region were 
tested in situ. Results showed that the initial macroelement contents of the 
leaves of the three tree species varied among different elevations due to 
different submergence stresses. All foliar mass loss rates of the three tree 
species at 165 m a.s.l. were significantly higher than that at 175 m a.s.l. 
(except that of S. matsudana at 165 m a.s.l.), after 179 days of incubation 
commenced September 20. After 138 days of incubation commenced October 5, the 
foliar mass loss rates of the three tree species at 170 m a.s.l. were 
significantly higher than that at 175 m a.s.l. Moreover, the leaf mass loss 
rates of S. matsudana were higher than the other two species when compared at 
the same elevation of the same incubation period. In addition, foliar release 
rates of N and Ca in T. ascendens, C, N, and Ca in T. distichum as well as Ca in 
S. matsudana at 165 m a.s.l. after 179 days of incubation and at 170 m a.s.l. 
after 138 days of incubation were significantly higher than that at 
175 m a.s.l., respectively. Leaf mass loss rates of T. ascendens were 
significantly correlated with its initial leaf K, Ca, and Mg contents. In 
contrast, leaf mass loss rates of T. distichum had significant correlations with 
the initial leaf P and K contents, as well as C/P and N/P ratios. However, the 
mass loss rates of S. matsudana significantly correlated with initial leaf N, P, 
and Ca contents and C/N, C/P, and N/P ratios. Foliar nutrient release rates, 
especially the foliar release of C, N, and P of the three tree species, had 
significant correlations with initial leaf C/P and N/P ratios. Our results 
suggested that submergence facilitated the decomposition and nutrient release 
rates of the leaves of the three woody species, especially the broad leaves of 
S. matsudana, which may potentially cause secondary pollution to the water body 
of the TGDR. Thus, we suggested that a sustainable harvest of leaves of the 
reforested forest stands prior to submergence should be considered in the 
hydro-fluctuation zone so as to protect the water quality of the TGDR.

Parametric models for survival data help to differentiate aging from other 
lifespan determinants. However, such inferences suffer from small sizes of 
experimental animal samples and variable animals handling by different labs. We 
analyzed control data from a single laboratory where interventions in murine 
lifespan were studied over decades. The minimal Gompertz model (GM) was found to 
perform best with most murine strains. However, when several control datasets 
related to a particular strain are fitted to GM, strikingly rigid 
interdependencies between GM parameters emerge, consistent with the 
Strehler-Mildvan correlation (SMC). SMC emerges even when survival patterns do 
not conform to GM, as with cancer-prone HER2/neu mice, which die at a 
log-normally distributed age. Numerical experiments show that SMC includes an 
artifact whose magnitude depends on dataset deviation from conformance to GM 
irrespectively of the noisiness of small datasets, another contributor to SMC. 
Still another contributor to SMC is the compensation effect of mortality (CEM): 
a real tradeoff between the physiological factors responsible for initial 
vitality and the rate of its decline. To avoid misinterpretations, we advise 
checking experimental results against a SMC based on historical controls or on 
subgroups obtained by randomization of control animals. An apparent acceleration 
of aging associated with a decrease in the initial mortality is invalid if it is 
not greater than SMC suggests. This approach applied to published data suggests 
that the effects of calorie restriction and of drugs believed to mimic it are 
different. SMC and CEM relevance to human survival patterns is discussed.

The cost-effectiveness of the standard of care for snakebite treatment, 
antivenom, and supportive care has been established in various settings. In this 
study, based on data from South Indian private health-care providers, we address 
an additional question: "For what cost and effectiveness values would adding 
adjunct-based treatment strategies to the standard of care for venomous 
snakebites be cost-effective?" We modeled the cost and performance of potential 
interventions (e.g., pharmacologic or preventive) used adjunctively with 
antivenom and supportive care for the treatment of snakebite. Because these 
potential interventions are theoretical, we used a threshold cost-effectiveness 
approach to explore this forward-looking concept. We examined economic 
parameters at which these interventions could be cost-effective or even cost 
saving. A threshold analysis was used to examine the addition of new 
interventions to the standard of care. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
were used to compare treatment strategies. One-way, scenario, and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to analyze parameter uncertainty and define 
cost and effectiveness thresholds. Our results suggest that even a 3% reduction 
in severe cases due to an adjunct strategy is likely to reduce the cost of 
overall treatment and have the greatest impact on cost-effectiveness. In this 
model, for example, an investment of $10 of intervention that reduces the 
incidence of severe cases by 3%, even without changing antivenom usage patterns, 
creates cost savings of $75 per individual. These findings illustrate the 
striking degree to which an adjunct intervention could improve patient outcomes 
and be cost-effective or even cost saving.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the elderly 
that seriously affects the quality of life and the life expectancy of those 
affected. There is, as yet, no effective drug treatment of AD, although several 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors and a glutamate antagonist can provide 
relief from its symptoms. Recent studies have indicated that the overactivation 
of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) may promote nerve cell death in the 
brains of AD patients, implying that PARP-1 inhibition may have therapeutic 
value for the treatment of AD. Therefore, it is important to investigate novel 
agents with both AChE- and PARP-1-inhibitory bioactivities. In this study, the 
structure-based virtual screening of PARP-1 inhibitors was performed to search 
for potential agents with high affinities for AChE. The dynamic stability of the 
selected AChE-ligand complexes was investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulation. Two compounds, CID57390505 and CID71605390, showed high affinities 
for and stability in complex with AChE in docking and MD simulations. Thus, our 
in silico research identified two compounds with AChE and PARP-1 dual-targeted 
activities, indicating that this technique could aid attempts to develop more 
potent agents against AD.

Molecular mechanisms underlying uremic toxin-related systemic disorders in 
chronic kidney disease: focused on β(2)-microglobulin-related amyloidosis and 
indoxyl sulfate-induced atherosclerosis-Oshima Award Address 2016.

Uremic toxins are linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related systemic 
diseases. β2-Microglobulin (β2-m), a water-soluble, middle-sized molecule, is 
associated with mortality and dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA). DRA occurs in 
long-term dialysis patients, with β2-m amyloid deposited mainly in 
osteoarticular tissues. We investigated a model of β2-m amyloid fibril extension 
at neutral pH in the presence of trifluoroethanol or sodium dodecyl sulfate. 
Using this model, some biological molecules, including glycosaminoglycans and 
lysophospholipids, were found to be chaperones for β2-m amyloid fibril 
extension. Several protein-bound solutes, such as indoxyl sulfate (IS) and 
p-cresyl sulfate, are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease in CKD 
patients, especially those undergoing dialysis. We investigated kidney 
injury-induced acceleration of atherosclerosis in association with macrophage 
phenotypic change to a proinflammatory state as well as increased IS deposition 
in lesions in an animal model. IS directly induced macrophage inflammation and 
impaired cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in vitro. In 
addition, a clinical study showed that HDL isolated from CKD patients induced 
proinflammatory reactions and impaired cholesterol efflux to macrophages. These 
findings suggest that protein-bound solutes, including IS, will induce 
dysfunction of both macrophages and HDL in atherosclerotic lesions. To remove 
uremic toxins efficiently, we demonstrated the potential efficacy of oral 
charcoal adsorbent and hexadecyl-immobilized cellulose beads in hemodialysis 
patients. These findings suggest that uremic toxins induce various CKD-related 
systemic disorders, and further therapeutic strategies will be needed to reduce 
uremic toxins enough and improve life expectancy in CKD patients.

Cadmium (Cd) stress is one of the most serious heavy metal stresses limiting 
plant growth and development. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying 
Cd-induced root growth inhibition remain unclear. Here, we found that ethylene 
signalling positively regulates Cd-induced root growth inhibition. Arabidopsis 
seedlings pretreated with the ethylene precursor 
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid exhibited enhanced Cd-induced root growth 
inhibition, whereas the addition of the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor 
aminoethoxyvinyl glycine decreased Cd-induced root growth inhibition. 
Consistently, ethylene-insensitive mutants, such as ein4-1, ein3-1 eil1-1 double 
mutant, and EBF1ox, displayed an increased tolerance to Cd. Furthermore, we also 
observed that Cd inhibited EIN3 protein degradation, a process that was 
regulated by ethylene signalling. Genetic and biochemical analyses showed that 
EIN3 enhanced root growth inhibition under Cd stress through direct binding to 
the promoters and regulating the expression of XTH33 and LSU1, which encode key 
regulators of cell wall extension and sulfur metabolic process, respectively. 
Collectively, our study demonstrates that ethylene plays a positive role in 
Cd-regulated root growth inhibition through EIN3-mediated transcriptional 
regulation of XTH33 and LSU1 and provides a molecular framework for the 
integration of environmental signals and intrinsic regulators in modulating 
plant root growth.

Life expectancy is increasing in Ireland, but whether this has resulted in 
healthier life years among the elderly and its impact (if any) on hospital 
services is unknown. The purpose of the study was to use routinely available 
data to explore the relationship of age and indicators of clinical complexity in 
acute hospitals over ten years. The study included all in-patients aged 65+ 
years from the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE) discharged between 2005 and 
2014. Indicators of complexity included the Charlson index, overall length of 
stay (LOS), intensive care unit LOS and deaths in hospital, analysed by the 
major clinical classification software (CCS). Over the period, the number and 
rate of admissions increased, especially among those aged 85+. Indicators of 
patient complexity increased and LOS decreased. In-hospital mortality decreased 
from 5.9% to 4.7%. Hospitals appear to be managing the emergency care of the 
older and more complex patient more efficiently and with better outcomes.

Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients were assessed in terms of risk factors, 
hematoma size and localization, the effects of spontaneous intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH) on mortality and morbidity, and post-stroke depression.
METHODS: The present study evaluated the demographic data, risk factors, and 
neurological examinations of 216 ICH patients. The diagnosis, volume, 
localization, and ventricular extension of the hematomas were determined using 
computed tomography scans. The mortality rate through the first 30 days was 
evaluated using ICH score and ICH grading scale. The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 
was used to determine the dependency status and functional recovery of each 
patient, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was administered to assess the 
psychosocial status of each patient.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 65.3±14.5 years. The most common 
locations of the ICH lesions were as follows: lobar (28.3%), thalamus (26.4%), 
basal ganglia (24.0%), cerebellum (13.9%), and brainstem (7.4%). The average 
hematoma volume was 15.8±23.8 cm3; a ventricular extension of the hemorrhage 
developed in 34.4% of the patients, a midline shift in 28.7%, and perihematomal 
edema, as the most frequently occurring complication, in 27.8%. Over the 6-month 
follow-up period, 57.9% of patients showed a poor prognosis (mRS: ≥3), while 
42.1% showed a good prognosis (mRS: <3). The mortality rate over the first 30 
days was significantly higher in patients with a low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 
score at admission, a large hematoma volume, and ventricular extension of the 
hemorrhage (p=0.0001). In the poor prognosis group, the presence of moderate 
depression (39.13%) was significantly higher than in the good prognosis group 
(p=0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Determination and evaluation of the factors that could influence the 
prognosis and mortality of patients with ICH is crucial for the achievement of 
more effective patient management and improved quality of life.

Publisher: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A betegeket az alábbiak szerint értékeltük: 
kockázati tényezők, a haematoma mérete és lokalizációja, a spontán 
intracerebralis haematoma (ICH) hatása a mortalitásra, a morbiditásra és a 
post-stroke depresszióra.
METHODS: A vizsgálat 216, ICH-t szenvedett beteg demográfiai adatait, kockázati 
tényezőit és neurológiai vizsgálati eredményeit elemezte. A haematoma 
diagnózisát, méretét, lokalizációját és kamrai kiterjedését CT-vizsgálattal 
határoztuk meg. Az első 30-on belüli mortalitási arányt az ICH-pontszám és az 
ICH súlyossági skála alapján értékeltük. A módosított Rankin-skálát (mRS) 
alkalmaztuk minden betegnél a függőségi állapot és a funkcionális javulás 
meghatározásához, a pszichoszociális állapot megítéléséhez pedig a Hamilton-féle 
Depresszió Skálát.
RESULTS: A betegek átlagos életkora 65,3±14,5 év volt. Az ICH leggyakrabban az 
alábbi lokalizációkban volt jelen: lobaris (28,3%), thalamicus (26,4%), basalis 
ganglionbeli (24,0%), kisagyi (13,9%), agytörzsi (7,4%). A haematomák átlagos 
volumene 15,8±23,8 cm3 volt, a haematoma a betegek 34,4%-ánál terjedt ki a 
kamrára. Középvonali struktúrák eltolódása a betegek 28,7%-ánál, haematoma 
körüli oedema pedig, mint a leggyakrabban előforduló szövődmény, 27,8%-uknál. A 
hat hónapos követési időszak alatt a betegek 57,9%-a esetében bizonyult 
kedvezőtlennek a prognózis (mRS≥3), kedvező prognózist (mRS<3) pedig 42,1%-nál 
észleltünk. Az első 30 napra vonatkozó mortalitási arány szignifikánsan magasabb 
volt a felvételkor kis GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) -pontszámú betegek esetében, 
továbbá nagy haematomavolumen és kamrai kiterjedés esetén (p=0,0001). A 
kedvezőtlen prognózisú csoportban a közepes erősségű depresszió szignifikánsan 
gyakrabban fordult elő (39,13%), mint a kedvező prognózisúak csoportjában 
(p=0,0001).
CONCLUSION: Intracerebralis haematoma esetén a prognózist és a mortalitást 
befolyásolni képes faktorok meghatározása és értékelése döntő fontosságú a 
hatékonyabb betegellátás és a jobb életminőség eléréséhez.

BACKGROUND: Cancer causes significant morbidity and mortality among HIV patients 
in the US due to extended life expectancy with access to effective 
antiretroviral therapy. Low, detectable HIV RNA has been studied as a risk 
factor for adverse health outcomes, but its clinical impact on cancer risk 
remains unclear. The objective of this study was to determine whether HIV RNA 
<1,000 copies/mL six months after starting therapy was associated with 10-year 
first cancer risk.
METHODS: We followed 7,515 HIV therapy initiators from a US-based multicenter 
clinical cohort from 1998 to 2014. We used nonparametric multiple imputation to 
account for viral loads that fell below assay detection limits, and categorized 
viral loads six months after therapy initiation into four groups: <20, 20-199, 
200-999, and >999 copies/mL. We calculated estimates of the cumulative incidence 
of cancer diagnosis, accounting for death as a competing event. Inverse 
probability of exposure and censoring weights were used to control for 
confounding and differential loss to follow up, respectively.
RESULTS: Crude 10-year first cancer risk in the study sample was 7.03% (95% CI: 
6.08%, 7.98%), with the highest risk observed among patients with viral loads 
between 200 and 999 copies/mL six months after ART initiation (10.7%). After 
controlling for baseline confounders, 10-year first cancer risk was 6.90% (95% 
CI: 5.69%, 8.12%), and was similar across viral load categories.
CONCLUSION: Overall risk of first cancer was not associated with incomplete 
viral suppression; however, cancer remains a significant threat to HIV patients 
after treatment initiation. As more HIV patients gain access to treatment in the 
current "treat all" era, occurrences of incomplete viral suppression will be 
observed more frequently in clinical practice, which supports continued study of 
the role of low-level HIV RNA on cancer development.

Although highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) remarkably increased 
life expectancy of HIV positive people, the rate of novel HIV-1 infections 
worldwide still represent a major concern. In this context, pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP) approaches such as vaginal microbicide gels topically 
releasing antiretroviral drugs, showed to have a striking impact in limiting 
HIV-1 spread. Nevertheless, the co-presence of other genital infections, 
particularly those due to HSV-1 or 2, constitute a serious drawback that 
strongly limits the efficacy of PrEP approaches. For this reason, combinations 
of different compounds with mixed antiviral and antiretroviral activity are 
thoroughly investigated Here we report the synthesis and the biological 
evaluation of a novel series of rhodanine derivatives, which showed to inhibit 
both HIV-1 and HSV-1/2 replication at nanomolar concentration, and were found to 
be active also on acyclovir resistant HSV-2 strains. The compounds showed a 
considerable reduction of activity in presence of serum due to a high binding to 
serum albumin, as determined through in vitro ADME evaluations. However, the 
most promising compound of the series maintained a considerable activity in gel 
formulation, with an EC50 comparable to that obtained for the reference drug 
tenofovir. Moreover, the series of compounds showed pharmacokinetic properties 
suitable for topical formulation, thus suggesting that the novel rhodanine 
derivatives could represent effective agents to be used as dual anti HIV/HSV 
microbicides in PrEP approaches.

Here, we describe the development of a Dutch national guideline on metastases 
and hematological malignancies localized within the spine. The aim was to create 
a comprehensive guideline focusing on proactive management of these diseases, 
enabling healthcare professionals to weigh patient perspectives, life 
expectancy, and expected outcomes to make informed treatment recommendations. A 
national multidisciplinary panel consisting of clinicians, a nurse, a patient 
advocate, an epidemiologist, and a methodologist drafted the guideline. The 
important role of patients in the realization of the guideline enabled us to 
identify and address perceived shortcomings in patient care. The guideline 
covers not only metastatic epidural spinal cord compression, but also the 
treatment of uncomplicated metastases and hematological malignancies localized 
within the spine. The guideline is applicable in daily practice and provides an 
up-to-date and concise overview of the diagnostic and treatment possibilities 
for patients suffering from a disease that can have a serious impact on their 
quality of life. Suggestions for the practical implementation of patient care in 
hospitals are also provided, including approaches for pursuing proactive 
management. The crucial role of the patient in decision making is emphasized in 
this guideline.

Treatment Perspectives in Crohn's Disease.

Vetter M, Neurath MF.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated disorder of the 
gastrointestinal tract. The pathophysiological understanding of this disease is 
limited and no curative therapy is available so far. Therefore, most patients 
require long-lasting or even life-long immunosuppressive therapies for the 
suppression of symptoms to improve quality of life and reduction of long-term 
risks. However, in a relevant subgroup of patients, these therapeutic goals 
cannot be sufficiently attained.
SUMMARY: Clinically established therapies in active CD comprise corticosteroids 
and immunosuppressants such as azathioprine. After the introduction of anti-TNFα 
(Tumor necrosis factor alpha) antibodies, other biologicals (e.g., vedolizumab 
and ustekinumab) have also been approved. New drugs in the pipeline like 
filgotinib, upadacitinib, risankizumab or rifaximin could improve the therapy of 
CD in the near future. Thus, an individualized therapy management, based on 
optimal selection of therapeutic agents will become more important. 
Additionally, the local application of mesenchymal stem cells might be helpful 
in the management of fistulas. Key Messages: The targeted biological therapeutic 
agents (anti-TNFα antibodies, vedolizumab, ustekinumab) are well established for 
therapy in CD. There are several new substances in the pipeline with promising 
results in phase II trials (filgotinib, rifaximin, risankizumab, upadacitinib). 
The upcoming extension of the therapeutic arsenal will require methods for an 
optimized selection of substances, thus enabling a more individualized therapy.

Advances in motor vehicle safety, trauma care, combat body armor, and cancer 
treatment have enhanced the life expectancy and functional expectations of 
patients with upper-extremity amputations. Upper-extremity surgeons have 
multiple surgical options to optimize the potential of emerging prosthetic 
technologies for this diverse patient group. Targeted muscle reinnervation is an 
evolving technique that improves control of myoelectric prostheses and can 
prevent or treat symptomatic neuromas. This review addresses current strategies 
for the care of patients with amputations proximal to the wrist with an emphasis 
on recent advancements in surgical techniques and prostheses.

BACKGROUND: The mortality rates for different cancers are no longer an efficient 
tool for making national policy. The purpose of this study were to quantify the 
lifetime risks, life expectancies (LEs) after diagnosis, expected years of life 
lost (EYLL), and lifetime health care expenditures for 19 major cancers in 
Taiwan.
METHODS: A total of 831,314 patients with 19 pathologically proven cancers were 
abstracted from the Taiwan Cancer Registry from 1998 to 2012. They were linked 
to the National Mortality Registry (1998-2014) and National Health Insurance 
reimbursement database (1998-2013) for survival and health care costs. We 
estimated the cumulative incidence rate for ages 0-79 years and the lifetime 
survival function for patients with different cancer sites. The EYLL was 
calculated by subtracting the LE of each cancer cohort from that of the age- and 
sex-matched referents simulated from national life tables. The estimated 
lifetime cost was calculated by adding up the product of survival probability 
and mean cost at the corresponding duration-to-date after adjustment for the 
inflation to the year of 2013.
RESULTS: There were 5 cancers with a lifetime risk exceeding 4%: colorectal, 
liver, lung, and prostate in males, and breast and colorectal in females. 
Cancers with EYLL of >10 years were: esophageal, intrahepatic bile ducts, liver, 
pancreas, oral, nasopharyngeal, leukemia, lung, and gallbladder, extrahepatic 
bile ducts and biliary tract in males, and intrahepatic bile ducts, pancreas, 
nasopharyngeal, lung, esophageal, leukemia, liver, gallbladder, extrahepatic 
bile ducts and biliary tract, ovary, and stomach in females. Cancers with 
lifetime health care expenditures exceeding US$50,000 to the National Health 
Insurance were as follows: leukemia, kidney, testis, renal pelvis and ureter in 
males, and renal pelvis and ureter, leukemia, breast, urinary bladder, kidney, 
ovary, and nasopharyngeal in females. All these impacts should be considered in 
health policy decisions.
CONCLUSION: The impacts of cancer in Taiwan are very large. Future studies must 
consider both quality of life and the entire impact from societal perspectives.

BACKGROUND: The risk of getting cancer before full life expectancy and 
mortalities per year are on the rise in Saudi Arabia. Yet, evidence of economic 
burden of cancer in the country remains largely unknown. In order to provide 
evidence, we attempted to estimate the economic burden in terms of indirect cost 
associated with premature cancer deaths among the active or potentially 
economically active population aged 15-60 years in Saudi Arabia.
METHOD: Within the framework of the World Health Organization guide of 
identifying the economic consequences of disease and injury, our method employs 
cost-of-illness approach. This approach is based on a macroeconomic model that 
estimates the indirect cost of cancer in terms of total non-health gross 
domestic product resource loss associated with a disease. We used 
epidemiological, health system, and macroeconomic data for our estimation. We 
discounted the net loss at 3% and computed an extension of the loss with a 
finite and stable upper limit proxied by non-health gross domestic product per 
capita. We carried out separate analyses for male and female. We conducted 
sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainties of epidemiological and 
economic factors on the robustness of the estimated economic burden. We varied 
the proportion of total cancer deaths, discount rate, and value of health 
expenditure per capita by ±20%. We further determined which of these factors or 
parameters had the greatest uncertainty or variation on the net present value 
total non-health gross domestic product resource loss per Capita.
RESULTS: Our results indicate the indirect cost associated with cancer deaths 
among Saudi population aged 15-60 years to be Int$ 2.57 billion of which Int$ 
1.46 billion (57%) was accounted for by females. The total indirect loss of 
cancer deaths increased by 8% to Int$ 2.77 billion when the loss is allowed to 
grow with a finite and stable upper limit proxied by non-health gross domestic 
product per capita over the discounted years of life lost per a death among 
female and male respectively. Much of the uncertainty in the determination of 
the value of the loss was accounted for by the proportion of total cancer deaths 
and discount rate, while health expenditure per capita was responsible for the 
least variability.
CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal evidence of indirect cost associated with cancer 
premature deaths in Saudi Arabia. In order to develop cancer control actions, 
the results of this study can inform health system policymakers not only of the 
extent of the enormous economic burden but also drawing attention to 
epidemiological and economic factors that explain the variability of the burden.

of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.

AIM: Compared with second-generation durable polymer drug-eluting stents 
(DP-DES), the cost-effectiveness of biodegradable polymer drug-eluting stents 
(BP-DES) remains unclear in the real-world setting. We assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of BP-DES in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of BP-DES to DP-DES over 1 year and 5 years from healthcare 
payer perspective. Relative treatment effects during the first year post-PCI 
were obtained from a real-world population analysis while clinical event risks 
in the subsequent 4 years were derived from a meta-analysis of published 
studies.
RESULTS: At 1 year, based on the clinical data analysis of 497 propensity-score 
matched pairs of patients, BP-DES were associated with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD20 503 per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained. At 5 years, BP-DES yielded an ICER of USD4062 per QALY gained. At 
the willingness-to-pay threshold of USD50 400 (one gross domestic product per 
capita in Singapore in 2015), BP-DES were cost-effective. Sensitivity analysis 
showed that the cost of stents had a significant impact on the 
cost-effectiveness of BP-DES. Threshold analysis demonstrated that if the cost 
difference between BP-DES and DP-DES exceeded USD493, BP-DES would not be 
cost-effective in patients with 1 year of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Biodegradable polymer drug-eluting stents were cost-effective 
compared with DP-DES in patients with coronary artery disease at 1 year and 
5 years after PCI. It is worth noting that the cost of stents had a significant 
impact on the findings.

AIMS: Patients with psoriasis often undergo treatment with a sequence of 
biologic agents because of poor/loss of response to initial therapy. With the 
availability of newer agents like ixekizumab and secukinumab, there is a need 
for cost-effectiveness analyses to better reflect current clinical practice. 
This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a sequence of biologic 
therapies containing first-line ixekizumab vs first-line secukinumab in patients 
with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the UK.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model with a lifetime horizon was developed to 
compare the cost-effectiveness of ixekizumab and secukinumab treatment 
sequences: ixekizumab → ustekinumab → infliximab → best supportive care (BSC) vs 
secukinumab → ustekinumab → infliximab → BSC. The model used monthly cycles, and 
included four health states: trial period, treatment maintenance, BSC, and 
death. At the end of the trial period, responders transitioned to maintenance 
therapy; non-responders transitioned to the next biologic in the sequence. An 
annual discontinuation rate of 20% was assumed for maintenance therapy.
RESULTS: The ixekizumab sequence provided cost savings of £898 (£176,203 vs 
177,101) [year 2015 values] and gained 0.03 more quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs: 1.45 vs 1.42) vs the secukinumab sequence over the lifetime horizon. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed an 89.8% likelihood that the 
ixekizumab sequence would be cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY 
gained.
LIMITATIONS: The analysis used list prices for drugs rather than confidential, 
preferentially priced Patient Access Scheme costs. In addition, efficacy input 
data were based on a network meta-analysis, as there were no head-to-head trials 
comparing ixekizumab and secukinumab.
CONCLUSION: First-line treatment with ixekizumab as part of a specific 
sequential biologic therapy for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the UK 
provided slight advantages in cost savings and QALYs gained over a similar 
treatment sequence initiated with secukinumab. In view of the small magnitude of 
these differences, factors such as patient preferences (e.g. for number of 
injections) and long-term safety (e.g. related to time on the market) may also 
be important for clinical decision-making.

In residential care homes and aged-care facilities globally, between one in 
three and one in four residents may have diabetes, an often complex highly 
co-morbid illness that leads to frailty, dependency, disability and reduced life 
expectancy. Residents with diabetes also have a high risk of hypoglycaemia, 
avoidable hospital admissions, and represent one of the most difficult 
challenges to health professionals and care staff in optimizing their diabetes 
and medical care. This detailed review examines the literature relating to care 
home diabetes over the last 25 years to assess what has been achieved in 
characterizing residents with diabetes, and what we know about the various but 
limited intervention studies that have been carried out internationally. The 
guidance and guidelines that have been published to assist clinicians in 
planning effective and safe care for this rather vulnerable group of people with 
diabetes are also reviewed. The review presents the first diagrammatic 
representation of a likely physiological cascade depicting the mainly 
irreversible functional decline a resident with diabetes might experience, 
provides modern principles of care for each resident with diabetes, and 
identifies what priority recommendations are required to be implemented if 
diabetes care is to improve. The review concludes that action is required since 
diabetes care still remains fragmented, sub-optimal, and in need of investment, 
otherwise care home residents with diabetes will continue to have their needs 
unfulfilled.

AIMS: This prospective, epidemiologic study was designed to translate the 
original Spanish Bone Metastases Quality-of-Life-10 (BOMET-QoL-10) questionnaire 
and undertake a validation of the translated German version of BOMET-QoL-10 in 
Germany to assess health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) in patients with bone 
metastases (BM).
METHODS: The translation process included forward and backward translations, and 
a linguistic validation. Patients aged ≥18 years with histological confirmation 
of cancer, diagnosed with BM, life expectancy ≥6 months, and fluency in German 
were eligible for this study (enrolled consecutively in 33 outpatient centers in 
Germany). Patients were given the German version of BOMET-QoL-10, together with 
the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality 
of Life Questionnaire QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BM22 questionnaires at inclusion, 6 
weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after inclusion. A debriefing questionnaire was 
administered at inclusion to determine patient acceptability and understanding.
RESULTS: Data include 364 patients with BM (median age = 68 years; 
females = 71.7%). The BOMET-QoL-10 is brief and clear (median completion 
time = 5 minutes; >90% of patients completed the questionnaire without 
assistance). The BOMET-QoL-10 forms only one overall scale. All 10 items showed 
a substantial correlation with the first factor (factor loading, 
range = 0.58-0.86). BOMET-QoL-10 exhibits high internal consistency and 
reproducibility (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91; intra-class correlation 
coefficient = 0.76). BOMET-QoL-10 showed significant correlations 
(range = 0.69-0.79) both with EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BM22 within the 
functioning (physical, social, interference) and symptom (fatigue, pain) scales, 
displayed significant sensitivity to change in EORTC QLQ-BM22 scores, and proved 
the potential ability to detect change in HRQoL in patients with different 
disease status.
LIMITATIONS: There was a high proportion of females in this study, which might 
represent a limitation.
CONCLUSIONS: The German version of BOMET-QoL-10 is a valid, reliable, brief, and 
clear instrument able to measure HRQoL in patients with BM.
