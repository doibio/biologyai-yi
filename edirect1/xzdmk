BACKGROUND: Resources are spent worldwide on the development of digital 
platforms and their user interfaces (UIs) for digital mental health services 
(DMHS). However, studies investigating the potential benefits of different UIs 
for DMHS are currently lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, the aim of this 
study was to investigate differences in treatment engagement between two 
different UIs for DMHS.
METHODS: A total of 397 participants from the Swedish general public were 
randomized (1:1) to use a self-guided digital problem-solving intervention 
during one week, either with an optimized UI (N = 198), based on user experience 
(UX) design principles and with automated features, or a basic UI (N = 199), 
analogous with a UI used in Swedish regular health care comprising elementary UI 
features and less automation. Primary outcome measures were self-rated 
usability, on the System Usability Scale, and treatment credibility, on the 
Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures included 
behavioral engagement with the intervention.
FINDINGS: There were no significant differences between the UIs in ratings of 
usability or treatment credibility. However, participants who used the optimized 
UI were significantly more engaged with the intervention as measured by usage of 
the intervention at least once (odds ratio 2.54, 95% CI [1.67, 3.85]), total 
number of generated solutions (mean difference 1.41, 95% CI [0.72, 2.11]), and 
mean number of generated solutions per initiated problem-solving attempt (mean 
difference 1.45, 95% CI [1.06, 1.85]). Other findings included participants 
using the optimized UI rating the intervention as easier to understand, while 
feeling more overwhelmed, than those using the basic UI.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that an optimized UI based on UX design 
principles, in comparison to a basic UI comprising elementary UI features, do 
not affect overall self-rated usability or treatment credibility but increases 
some measures of behavioral engagement with a digital intervention.

PURPOSE: Health utility, which is a measure of patient-reported outcome (PRO), 
has recently been used in health-related quality of life for patients with 
various cancers. However, the relationship between health utility and the 
physical function and of patients undergoing pleurectomy/decortication (P/D) as 
surgical treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) has not been 
reported in the perioperative and convalescent phases. This study aimed to 
evaluate the perioperative and postoperative health utility of patients 
undergoing P/D for MPM at one year postoperatively and to examine the 
relationship with physical function.
METHODS: We included patients underwent P/D. Grip strength, knee extension 
strength, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced 
expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were measured to assess physical 
function, and the Short-Form Six-Dimension (SF-6D) was completed to assess 
health utility. These assessments were performed preoperatively, 
postoperatively, and one year postoperatively. Statistical analysis was 
performed using one-way analysis of variance for comparison of pre and 
postoperative and one year mean values.
RESULTS: There were 24 subjects (23 males, 65.5±8.3 year). SF-6D, 6MWD, FVC, and 
FEV1 values one year operatively improved significantly compared with 
postoperative. Additionally, SF-6D was correlated with 6MWD.
CONCLUSION: Health utility were also correlated with exercise capacity.

Life expectancy in sub-Saharan African women is increasing, and by the late 
2020s an estimated 76% of postmenopausal women globally will be living in 
developing countries. Menopause transition has been associated with cognitive 
decline in a wide range of studies, but data on cognition and reproductive aging 
are lacking in sub-Saharan African women. Approximately 72 million people in the 
region are expected to suffer from dementias and neurocognitive decline by 2050. 
Studies show that compromised cognitive health in low-income countries has 
significant implications for adult quality of life and socioeconomic 
development. There is now an urgent need to further examine risk factors for 
cognitive decline in these aging women and to understand the ability of public 
health programs to diagnose and treat cognitive dysfunction. This review 
examines studies assessing cognition and aging in sub-Saharan African adults, 
while addressing the significant research gaps. It examines data on the 
association of the menopause transition with cognitive function and describes 
how validated tools should be available to assess both menopausal stage and 
symptoms. Culturally appropriate and validated neurocognitive measures are 
required to better understand the relationship of reproductive aging with 
cognition. Longitudinal population-based studies are needed to assess the effect 
of lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, on cognitive health in 
sub-Saharan African populations, with an emphasis on women as they transition 
into menopause.

Early detection of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is critical for better 
therapeutic outcomes. The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis of ALS is 
11 months, with a range of 6-21 months. Given that the median life expectancy is 
three years, it is important to shorten the diagnostic journey, initiate 
therapies promptly, and facilitate clinical research participation. Biomarkers 
may be the key to enhancing early diagnosis, tracking disease progression, and 
testing target engagement of promising therapeutics. Clinically valid biomarkers 
for ALS are currently lacking, and research has been ongoing to identify 
appropriate biomarkers. Ideal biomarkers should be minimally invasive, such as 
blood. In this chapter, we review our current understanding of blood-based 
biomarker research in ALS and discuss future directions.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease which 
leads to a progressive degeneration of motoneurons. Since the pharmacological 
options available provide only a slight increase in life expectancy, cell 
therapy is emerging as a promising therapeutic alternative for ALS. A growing 
body of evidence from studies using genetically engineered ALS animal models 
demonstrate the safety and efficacy of therapies based on different cell types 
such as mononuclear cells, neural progenitors, and mesenchymal stem cells. 
Despite the encouraging results in preclinical studies, cell therapy-based 
clinical trials for ALS have achieved only modest results so far, probably due 
to the genotypic variations seen among ALS patients, which is difficult to 
reproduce in animal models. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 
has enabled the development of patient-specific cell lines, a valuable tool to 
investigate in vitro molecular mechanisms of the disease and therapies in 
different genetic backgrounds. The applications of ALS iPSCs and their future 
therapeutic potential are also briefly discussed in this chapter.

Nitroreductases are emerging as attractive bioremediation enzymes, with 
substrate promiscuity toward both natural and synthetic compounds. Recently, the 
nitroreductase NfnB from Sphingopyxis sp. strain HMH exhibited metabolic 
activity for dinitroaniline herbicides including butralin and pendimethalin, 
triggering the initial steps of their degradation and detoxification. However, 
the determinants of the specificity of NfnB for these herbicides are unknown. In 
this study, we performed structural and biochemical analyses of NfnB to decipher 
its substrate specificity. The homodimer NfnB is a member of the PnbA subgroup 
of the nitroreductase family. Each monomer displays a central α + β fold for the 
core domain, with a protruding middle region and an extended C-terminal region. 
The protruding middle region of Val75-Tyr129 represents a structural extension 
that is a common feature to members of the PnbA subgroup and functions as an 
opening wall connecting the coenzyme FMN-binding site to the surface, therefore 
serving as a substrate binding site. We performed mutational, kinetic, and 
structural analyses of mutant enzymes and found that Tyr88 in the middle region 
plays a pivotal role in substrate specificity by determining the dimensions of 
the wall opening. The mutation of Tyr88 to phenylalanine or alanine caused 
significant changes in substrate selectivity toward bulkier dinitroaniline 
herbicides such as oryzalin and isopropalin without compromising its activity. 
These results provide a framework to modify the substrate specificity of 
nitroreductase in the PnbA subgroup, which has been a challenging issue for its 
biotechnological and bioremediation applications.

The need for bone repair and insight into new regeneration therapies as well as 
improvement of existing regeneration routes is constantly increasing as a direct 
consequence of the rise in the number of trauma victims, musculoskeletal 
disorders, and increased life expectancy. Bisphosphonates (BPs) have emerged as 
a class of drugs with proven efficacy against many bone disorders. The most 
recent ability of this class of drugs is being explored in its anti-cancer 
ability. However, despite the pharmacological success, there are certain 
shortcomings that have circumvented this class of the drug. The mediation of 
biomaterials in delivering bisphosphonates has greatly helped in overcoming some 
of these shortcomings. This article is focused on reviewing the benefits the 
bisphosphonates have provided upon getting delivered via the use of 
biomaterials. Furthermore, the role of bisphosphonates as a potent anticancer 
agent is also accounted. It is witnessed that employing engineering tools in 
combination with therapeutics has the potential to provide solutions to bone 
loss from degenerative, surgical, or traumatic processes, and also aid in 
accelerating the healing of large bone fractures and problematic non-union 
fractures. The role of nanotechnology in enhancing the efficacy of the 
bisphosphonates is also reviewed and innovative approaches are identified.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, New Urban Agenda and Paris 
Agreement on Climate Change are blueprints for health promotion action that 
mandate human health is linked inextricably to the health of the environment. In 
the Anthropocene, new indicators are required to promote community engagement 
with, and measurement of, healthy and sustainable wellbeing for people and 
planet. This study explored the need for a metric such as the Happy Planet Index 
that explicitly links human health to health of the environment for a local 
level scale in Australia. The project arose from an international coalition of 
health promoters advocating for 'planetary health' approaches. Qualitative 
description methods guided the study design involving key informant interviews 
(n = 17) and four focus groups (n = 27 participants) with health and/or 
sustainability academics, practitioners and policy-makers. Document analysis of 
health and environment indices and policy mandates augmented the analysis. 
Qualitative content analysis techniques were used to analyse the findings. There 
was strong interest for a local level composite indicator, such as a rescaled 
Happy Planet Index (life expectancy × life satisfaction × equity 
adjustment/ecological footprint) for use at a local level. The value of a 
composite index was: its ability to promote community engagement with planetary 
health thinking; an advocacy tool for joint health and sustainability policy; to 
justify programs on health and environmental co-benefits; and to provide a 
mechanism for correlative comparisons between local governments and national 
comparisons. However, disciplinary silos currently limit partnerships for health 
promotion and planetary health and a local composite index could help bridge 
these divides.

BACKGROUND: Vastus lateralis (VL) can be used to reconstruct defects of the head 
and neck. Whilst the advantages are documented, donor-site morbidity is not well 
described. This study aimed to assess donor-site morbidity after VL flap 
harvest. Results will determine future directions for preventative and 
post-operative care to improve patient health outcomes.
METHODS: Ten participants (mean age 55 years) were assessed for the presence of 
donor-site morbidity after VL harvest. Musculoskeletal (pain, muscle strength, 
muscle length and tactile sensation), quality of life (SF-12), lower extremity 
function, gait (function and speed) and sit to stand were assessed using 
validated and standardized procedures. The outcomes were compared to age-matched 
healthy reference values or to the non-operative side. Analyses were conducted 
using descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests.
RESULTS: There was no difference in muscle strength (knee extension), muscle 
length, ability to sit-to-stand, or gait function (all P > 0.05). Knee flexor 
muscle strength was significantly less on the operated leg compared to the 
non-operated leg (P = 0.02) and walking speed was slower than age-matched 
healthy values (P < 0.001). Thigh tactile sensation was impaired in 89% of 
participants. Quality of life was significantly less for the physical health 
component of the SF-12 (P < 0.001). The mental health component of the SF-12 was 
similar to healthy controls (P = 0.256).
CONCLUSION: There was no effect on donor site morbidity with regards to knee 
extensor strength, pain, walking function, ability to sit-to-stand and muscle 
length. VL harvest affected donor-site knee flexion strength, walking speed, 
tactile sensation and physical health-related quality of life.

Azobenzene-embedded photoswitchable ligands are the widely used chemical tools 
in photopharmacological studies. Current approaches to azobenzene introduction 
rely mainly on the isosteric replacement of typical azologable groups. However, 
atypical scaffolds may offer more opportunities for photoswitch remodeling, 
which are chemically in an overwhelming majority. Herein, we investigate the 
rational remodeling of atypical scaffolds for azobenzene introduction, as 
exemplified in the development of photoswitchable ligands for the cannabinoid 
receptor 2 (CB2). Based on the analysis of residue-type clusters surrounding the 
binding pocket, we conclude that among the three representative atypical arms of 
the CB2 antagonist, AM10257, the adamantyl arm is the most appropriate for 
azobenzene remodeling. The optimizing spacer length and attachment position 
revealed AzoLig 9 with excellent thermal bistability, decent 
photopharmacological switchability between its two configurations, and high 
subtype selectivity. This structure-guided approach gave new impetus in the 
extension of new chemical spaces for tool customization for increasingly 
diversified photo-pharmacological studies and beyond.

Examining Ethnic Variation in Life Expectancy Among Asians in the United States, 
2012-2016.

As the fastest growing racial group in the United States, understanding the 
health patterns of Asians is important to addressing health gaps in American 
society. Most studies have not considered the unique experiences of the ethnic 
groups contained in the Asian racial group, implying that Asians have a shared 
story. However, we should expect differences between the ethnic groups given the 
differences in their timing and place of migration, socioeconomic status, and 
racialized experiences in the United States. We estimate the life expectancy of 
the six largest Asian ethnic groups-Chinese, Asian Indians, Filipinos, 
Vietnamese, Koreans, and Japanese-analyzing data from the Multiple Cause of 
Death File (2012-2016) and the American Community Survey (2012-2016) in the 
United States at the national and regional levels. Nationally, Chinese had the 
highest life expectancy (males e0 = 86.8; females e0 = 91.3), followed by Asian 
Indians, Koreans, Japanese, Filipinos, and Vietnamese, generally reflecting the 
pattern expected given their educational attainment, our primary indicator of 
socioeconomic status. We also found regional differences in life expectancy, 
where life expectancy for Asians in the West was significantly lower than all 
other regions. These findings suggest the presence of underlying selection 
effects associated with settlement patterns among new and traditional 
destinations. Our results underline the necessity of studying the experiences of 
the different Asian ethnic groups in the United States, permitting a better 
assessment of the varying health needs within this diverse racial group.

BACKGROUND: Nasal septum perforations (NSP) have many uncomfortable symptoms for 
the patient and a highly negative impact on quality of life. NSPs are closed 
using patient-specific implants or surgery. Implants are created either under 
anesthesia using silicone impressions or using 3D models from CT data. 
Disadvantages for patient safety are the increased risk of morbidity or 
radiation exposure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the context of otorhinolaryngologic surgery, we 
present a gentle approach to treating NSP with a new image-based, contactless, 
and radiation-free measurement method using a 3D endoscope. The method relies on 
image information only and makes use of real-time capable computer vision 
algorithms to compute 3D information. This endoscopic method can be repeated as 
often as desired in the clinical course and has already proven its accuracy and 
robustness for robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) and surgical microscopy. We expand 
our method for nasal surgery, as there are additional spatial and 
stereoperspective challenges.
RESULTS: After measuring 3 relevant parameters (NSP extension: axial, coronal, 
and NSP circumference) of 6 patients and comparing the results of 2 
stereoendoscopes with CT data, it was shown that the image-based measurements 
can achieve comparable accuracies to CT data. One patient could be only 
partially evaluated because the NSP was larger than the endoscopic field of 
view.
CONCLUSION: Based on the very good measurements, we outline a therapeutic 
procedure which should enable the production of patient-specific NSP implants 
based on endoscopic data only.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Die vielfältigen unangenehmen Symptome 
von Nasenseptumdefekten (NSD) führen zu einer deutlichen Einschränkung der

Das Verfahren beruht ausschließlich auf Bilddaten und nutzt echtzeitfähige 
Bildverarbeitungsalgorithmen zur Berechnung von 3D-Informationen. Es ist 
beliebig oft wiederholbar und wurde bereits erfolgreich in der robotergestützten 
Chirurgie und in der OP-Mikroskopie eingesetzt. Daher wurde diese Methode für 
die Nasenchirurgie erweitert, für die es zusätzliche anatomische und 
stereoskopische Herausforderungen gibt.
ERGEBNISSE: Nach Auswertung von 3 relevanten Messgrößen (NSD-Ausdehnung: axial, 
koronal und Umfang) von 6 Patienten und Vergleich der Ergebnisse von 
2 Stereoendoskopen mit vorhandenen CT-Daten zeigte sich: Die bildbasierten 
Messergebnisse können vergleichbare Genauigkeiten wie CT-Daten erzielen. Bei 
einem Patienten wurden die Daten nur teilweise ausgewertet, da der NSD größer 
als das endoskopische Sichtfeld war.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Aufbauend auf den sehr guten Messwerten wird ein 
Therapieverfahren skizziert, welches die Herstellung von patientenspezifischen 
NSD-Implantaten auf Basis endoskopischer Daten ermöglicht.

from PID Patients Allow for Stratification of the Infection Risk.

Over the years, a wide variety of therapeutic antibodies has been successfully 
introduced in the autoimmunology clinic and many more are on the edge to follow. 
Many of these treatments address either a pathogenic circulating molecule or a 
cell-bound molecule. Whereas the former target results in neutralization of the 
soluble factor, the latter target either inhibits cellular function or induces 
selective cell death. If this targeted molecule or cell is part of the immune 
system, this therapy evokes a state of immunodeficiency. Knowing the exact 
function of the respective components enables the risk stratification for 
possible infectious complications in patients treated with biologics. Much of 
the understanding of the function of immune cells and their associated 
molecules, in relation to redundancy in the immune system, is derived from 
studies in knockout mice. However, as mice are not men in terms of their 
life-expectancy, their infection exposure, or the composition of their immune 
system, the most useful knowledge for estimating the consequence of therapeutic 
intervention on immune competence comes from monitoring patients. In the current 
chapter, we focus on patients with a primary immunodeficiency (PID) because they 
provide us with a unique perspective to estimate the redundancy of a certain 
genetic defect for overall immune competence. These patients have inborn errors 
of the immune system that, in general, are due to single gene defects. Depending 
on the immunological pathway that is defective, patients can present with 
different types of (opportunistic) infectious diseases, as well as other 
clinical manifestations. Based on selected examples, we focus in this chapter on 
finding parallels in the infectious risk of autoimmune patients treated with 
biologics and PID patients with a defect in the immunological pathway that is 
affected by the respective biologic. The goal is to learn from the 
(dis)similarities between both patient populations in terms of safety profiles 
of biologic treatments.

The molecular mechanisms of aging are unsolved fundamental biological questions. 
Caenorhabditis elegans is an ideal model organism for investigating aging. 
PUF-8, a PUF (Pumilio and FBF) protein in C. elegans, is crucial for germline 
development through binding with the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTR) in the 
target mRNAs. Recently, PUF-8 was reported to alter mitochondrial dynamics and 
mitophagy by regulating MFF-1, a mitochondrial fission factor, and subsequently 
regulated longevity. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the PUF domain 
of PUF-8 with an RNA substrate. Mutagenesis experiments were performed to alter 
PUF-8 recognition of its target mRNAs. Those mutations reduced the fertility and 
extended the lifespan of C. elegans. Deep sequencing of total mRNAs from 
wild-type and puf-8 mutant worms as well as in vivo RNA Crosslinking and 
Immunoprecipitation (CLIP) experiments identified six PUF-8 regulated genes, 
which contain at least one PUF-binding element (PBE) at the 3' UTR. One of the 
six genes, pqm-1, is crucial for lipid storage and aging process. Knockdown of 
pqm-1 could revert the lifespan extension of puf-8 mutant animals. We conclude 
that PUF-8 regulate the lifespan of C. elegans may not only via MFF but also via 
modulating pqm-1-related pathways.

How I treat and prevent venous thrombotic complications in patients with 
lymphoma.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication occurring in 5% to 10% of 
patients with lymphoma. As the complexity of lymphoma management has increased 
with novel therapies, so too has the treatment of VTE. Therapeutic options for 
the treatment of cancer-associated VTE have expanded from only warfarin and 
low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) to include the direct oral anticoagulants 
(DOACs) apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban. There have been no head-to-head 
trials comparing different DOACs in this setting, and randomized trials 
comparing a DOAC with LMWH dalteparin differ in trial design and results. 
Drug-drug interactions, drug-specific side effects, and patient selection are 
important considerations when prescribing anticoagulant therapy. In all 
patients, the relative risks of thrombosis and bleeding, the availability of the 
anticoagulant, and the life expectancy of the patient are vital elements in 
selecting the most appropriate anticoagulant (which can vary over time) for the 
individual patient. We describe the intricacies and challenges of treating 
thrombotic complications in patients with lymphoma with an emphasis on evidence 
and guideline-based care.

BACKGROUND: Migraine and cervicogenic headache (CGH) are common headache 
disorders, although the large overlap of symptoms between them makes 
differential diagnosis challenging. To strengthen differential diagnosis, 
physical testing has been used to examine for the presence of musculoskeletal 
impairments in both conditions. This review aimed to systematically evaluate 
differences in physical examination findings between people with migraine, CGH 
and asymptomatic individuals.
METHODS: The databases MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE 
were searched from inception until January 2020. Risk of bias was assessed with 
the Downs and Black Scale for non-randomized controlled trials, and with the 
Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool for diagnostic accuracy 
studies. When possible, meta-analyses with random effect models was performed.
RESULTS: From 19,682 articles, 62 studies were included in this review and 41 
were included in the meta-analyses. The results revealed: a) decreased range of 
motion [°] (ROM) on the flexion-rotation test (FRT) (17.67, 95%CI:13.69,21.65) 
and reduced neck flexion strength [N] (23.81, 95%CI:8.78,38.85) in CGH compared 
to migraine; b) compared to controls, migraineurs exhibit reduced flexion ROM 
[°] (- 2.85, 95%CI:-5.12,-0.58), lateral flexion ROM [°] (- 2.17, 95% 
CI:-3.75,-0.59) and FRT [°] (- 8.96, 95%CI:-13.22,-4.69), reduced cervical 
lordosis angle [°] (- 0.89, 95%CI:-1.72,-0.07), reduced pressure pain thresholds 
over the cranio-cervical region [kg/cm2], reduced neck extension strength [N] 
(- 11.13, 95%CI:-16.66,-5.6) and increased activity [%] of the trapezius (6.18, 
95%CI:2.65,9.71) and anterior scalene muscles (2.87, 95%CI:0.81,4.94) during 
performance of the cranio-cervical flexion test; c) compared to controls, CGH 
patients exhibit decreased neck flexion (- 33.70, 95%CI:-47.23,-20.16) and 
extension (- 55.78, 95%CI:-77.56,-34.00) strength [N].
CONCLUSION: The FRT and neck flexion strength could support the differential 
diagnosis of CGH from migraine. Several physical tests were found to 
differentiate both headache types from asymptomatic individuals. Nevertheless, 
additional high-quality studies are required to corroborate these findings.

BACKGROUND: A number of cellular processes have evolved in metazoans that 
increase the proteome repertoire in relation to the genome, such as alternative 
splicing and translation recoding. Another such process, translational stop 
codon readthrough (SCR), generates C-terminally extended protein isoforms in 
many eukaryotes, including yeast, plants, insects, and humans. While comparative 
genome analyses have predicted the existence of programmed SCR in many species 
including humans, experimental proof of its functional consequences are scarce.
RESULTS: We show that SCR of the Drosophila POU/Oct transcription factor Ventral 
veins lacking/Drifter (Vvl/Dfr) mRNA is prevalent in certain tissues in vivo, 
reaching a rate of 50% in the larval prothoracic gland. Phylogenetically, the 
C-terminal extension is conserved and harbors intrinsically disordered regions 
and amino acid stretches implied in transcriptional activation. Elimination of 
Vvl/Dfr translational readthrough by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis changed the 
expression of a large number of downstream genes involved in processes such as 
chromatin regulation, neurogenesis, development, and immune response. As a 
proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that the C-terminal extension of Vvl/Dfr is 
necessary for correct timing of pupariation, by increasing the capacity to 
regulate its target genes. The extended Vvl/Dfr isoform acts in synergy with the 
transcription factor Molting defective (Mld) to increase the expression and 
biosynthesis of the steroid hormone ecdysone, thereby advancing pupariation. 
Consequently, late-stage larval development was prolonged and metamorphosis 
delayed in vvl/dfr readthrough mutants.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that translational recoding of a POU/Oct 
transcription factor takes place in a highly tissue-specific and temporally 
controlled manner. This dynamic and regulated recoding is necessary for normal 
expression of a large number of genes involved in many cellular and 
developmental processes. Loss of Vvl/Dfr translational readthrough negatively 
affects steroid hormone biosynthesis and delays larval development and 
progression into metamorphosis. Thus, this study demonstrates how SCR of a 
transcription factor can act as a developmental switch in a spatiotemporal 
manner, feeding into the timing of developmental transitions between different 
life-cycle stages.

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of 
low-dose IFN-β in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 recently infected elderly 
patients to progress towards severe COVID-19 versus control group within 28 
days. Secondary objectives are: 1) To assess the reduction in Intensive Care 
Unit (ICU) admission in patients treated with IFN-β versus control group within 
28 days of randomization 2) To assess the reduction in number of deaths in IFN- 
β compared to control group (day 28) 3) To evaluate the increase in proportion 
of participants returning to negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in IFN-β -treated versus 
control group at Day 14 and Day 28 4) To assess the increase in 
SARS-CoV-2-specific binding antibody titers in IFN-β compared to control group 
(day 28) 5) To assess the safety of IFN-β -treated patients versus control group 
TRIAL DESIGN: Randomized, Open-Label, Controlled, Superiority Phase II Study. 
Patients, who satisfy all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, will be 
randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups in a ratio 2:1 (IFN-treated 
versus control patients). Randomization will be stratified by gender. Stratified 
randomization will balance the presence of male and female in both study arms.
PARTICIPANTS: Male and female adults aged 65 years or older with newly diagnosed 
SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild COVID-19 symptoms are eligible for the study. The 
trial is being conducted in Rome. Participants will be either hospitalized or 
home isolated. A group of physicians belonging to the Special Unit for Regional 
Continued Care (USCAR), specifically trained for the study and under the 
supervision of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases "Lazzaro 
Spallanzani", will be responsible for the screening, enrolment, treatment and 
clinical monitoring of patients, thus acting as a bridge between clinical 
centers and territorial health management. Inclusion criteria are as follows: ≥ 
65 years of age at time of enrolment; Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 
as determined by PCR, in any specimen < 72 hours prior to randomization; Subject 
(or legally authorized representative) provides written informed consent prior 
to initiation of any study procedures; Understands and agrees to comply with 
planned study procedures; Agrees to the collection of nasopharyngeal swabs and 
venous blood samples per protocol; Being symptomatic for less than 7 days before 
starting therapy; NEWS2 score ≤2. Exclusion criteria are as follows: 
Hospitalized patients with illness of any duration, and at least one of the 
following: Clinical assessment (evidence of rales/crackles on exam) and SpO2 ≤ 
94% on room air at rest or after walking test, OR Acute respiratory failure 
requiring mechanical ventilation and/or supplemental oxygen; Patients currently 
using IFN-β (e.g., multiple sclerosis patients); Patients undergoing 
chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive treatments; Patients with chronic kidney 
diseases; Known allergy or hypersensitivity to IFN (including asthma); Any 
autoimmune disease (resulting from patient anamnesis); Patients with signs of 
dementia or neurocognitive disorders; Patients with current severe depression 
and/or suicidal ideations; Being concurrently involved in another clinical 
trial; HIV infection (based on the anamnesis); Use of any antiretroviral 
medication; Impaired renal function (eGFR calculated by CKD-EPI Creatinine 
equation < 30 ml/min); Presence of other severe diseases impairing life 
expectancy (e.g. patients are not expected to survive 28 days given their 
pre-existing medical condition); Any physical or psychological impediment in a 
patient that could let the investigator to suspect his/her poor compliance; Lack 
or withdrawal of informed consent INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Control arm: No 
specific antiviral treatment besides standard of care. Treatment arm: 11μg 
(3MIU) of IFN-β1a will be injected subcutaneously at day 1, 3, 7, and 10 in 
addition to standard of care. The drug solution, contained in a pre-filled 
cartridge, will be injected by means of the RebiSmart® electronic injection 
device. Interferon β1a (Rebif®, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is a 
disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). 
The dose selected for this study is expected to exploit the antiviral and 
immunomodulatory properties of the cytokine without causing relevant toxicity or 
inducing refractoriness phenomena sometimes observed after high-dose and/or 
chronic IFNβ treatments.
MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients 
experiencing a disease progression, during at least 5 days, according to the 
National Early Warning Score (NEWS2). The NEWS2 score is a standardized approach 
aimed at promptly detecting signs of clinical deterioration in acutely ill 
patients and establishing the potential need for higher level of care. It is 
based on the evaluation of vital signs, including respiratory rate, oxygen 
saturation, temperature, blood pressure, pulse/heart rate, AVPU response. The 
resulting observations, compared to a normal range, are combined in a single 
composite "alarm" score. Any other clinical sign clearly indicating a disease 
worsening will be considered as disease progression.
RANDOMIZATION: Sixty patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive IFN-β1a plus the 
standard of care or the standard of care only. Eligible patients will be 
randomized (no later than 36 h after enrolment) by means of a computerized 
central randomization system. All patients will receive a unique patient 
identification number at enrolling visit when signing the informed consent and 
before any study procedure is performed. This number remains constant throughout 
the entire study. The randomization of patients will be closed when 60 patients 
have been enrolled. The randomization will be stratified by sex; for each 
stratum a sequence of treatments randomly permuted in blocks of variable length 
(3 or 6) will be generated.
BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label study. After the randomization, 
patients will be notified whether they will be in the experimental arm or in the 
control arm.
NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The study plans to enrol 60 patients: 40 
in the IFN-β1a arm, 20 in the control arm, according to a 2:1 - treated: 
untreated ratio.
TRIAL STATUS: Protocol Version: 3.0 Version Date: 18/03/2021 The study is open 
for recruitment since 16/04/2021.Recruitment is expected to l be completed 
before 15/08/2021.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT N°: 2020-003872-42, registration date: 19/10/2020.
FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible 
from the Trials website (Additional file 1). In the interest in expediting 
dissemination of this material, the familiar formatting has been eliminated;

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy with low-dose cisplatin and 
doxorubicin (PIPAC C/D) for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer.
METHODS: A Partitioned Survival Model followed by state transition Markov model 
was developed to estimate the costs and effectiveness of the use of PIPAC C/D 
versus palliative chemotherapy in the UK. The intervention was assessed at two 
different levels of care, including upfront therapy (PIPAC C/D plus Oxaliplatin 
in combination with Capecitabine (XELOX) chemotherapy versus first-line 
chemotherapy alone) and second-line therapy (PIPAC C/D alone versus second-line 
chemotherapy (ramucirumab monotherapy)). Data from multiple sources, including 
published literature and UK-based databases, were used to inform the economic 
model.
RESULTS: For the upfront therapy analysis, the estimated total costs in the 
intervention and comparator arms were £32,606 (SD: £3877) and £17,844 (SD: 
£920), respectively. PIPAC C/D plus XELOX led to an increase of 0.46 in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. The incremental cost per QALY gained 
was £31,868. For the second-line therapy analysis, the use of PIPAC C/D led to 
an increase of 0.19 in QALYs and a £21,474 reduction in costs, meaning the 
intervention was a dominant strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness results for the upfront therapy analysis 
indicate that PIPAC C/D plus chemotherapy is a cost-effective strategy. 
Additionally, PIPAC C/D alone as a second-line therapy has the potential to 
reduce costs and improve clinical outcomes for patients with advanced gastric 
cancer with peritoneal metastasis.
