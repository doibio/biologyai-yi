BACKGROUND: Impaired active digital extension is common after stroke, hindering 
functional rehabilitation, and predicting poor recovery. The SaeboGlove assists 
digital extension and may improve outcome after stroke. We recently performed a 
single group, open, pilot trial of the SaeboGlove early after stroke which 
demonstrated satisfactory safety, feasibility and acceptability. An adequately 
powered randomised clinical trial is now needed to assess the clinical 
effectiveness of the SaeboGlove.
METHODS: SUSHI is a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised 
controlled trial with blinded outcome assessment, and embedded process and 
economic evaluations. Adults, 7-60 days post-stroke, with upper limb disability 
and severe hand impairment, including reduced active digital extension, will be 
recruited from NHS inpatient stroke services in Scotland. Participants will be 
randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive 6 weeks of self-directed, repetitive, 
functional-based practice involving a SaeboGlove plus usual care, or usual care 
only. The primary outcome is upper limb function measured by the Action Research 
Arm Test (ARAT) at 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes will be measured at 6 and 14 
weeks. A process evaluation will be performed via interviews with 'intervention' 
participants, and their carers and clinical therapists. A within-trial 
cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed. 110 participants are required to 
detect a difference between groups of 9 in the ARAT with 90% power at a 5% 
significance level allowing for 11% attrition.
DISCUSSION: SUSHI will determine if SaeboGlove self-directed, repetitive, 
functional-based practice improves upper limb function after stroke, whether it 
is acceptable to stroke survivors and whether it is cost-effective.

OBJECTIVES: Supracondylar humeral fractures (SCHF) are the most common elbow 
injury in the pediatric population. The treatment, outcome, and health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) following these injuries are described.
METHODS: Patients with SCHF who were treated depending on the fracture type were 
evaluated. Medical records stored in the REDCap database were reviewed to obtain 
information on demographics, mechanisms of injury, neurovascular status, 
infection rates, and postoperative complications. Outcomes were assessed using 
Flynn's criteria and Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) version 4.0. Follow-up 
was for 6 months.
RESULTS: A total of 101 patients with a mean age of 5.2 years (SD ± 2.3) were 
seen. Most of the injuries occurred at home (64.3%). The left-arm (nondominant) 
was the most injured (62%), though 92% of patients were right hand dominant. 
Ninety-six percent of the fractures were the extension type. A total of 98% had 
satisfactory outcomes using Flynn's criteria and older patients were likely to 
sustain Gartland type III SCHF (P = .01). There was a significant difference in 
mean scores of PedsQL (all P values < .01) at 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, the quality of life of patients 
following SCHF diminished at the time of the injury and returned to the 
population normal 6 months after. There was no significant difference in HRQoL 
scores between patients who presented early and those who presented late. The 
delayed presentation and management did not also affect the functional outcome 
and complications. Therefore, surgical management of these injuries after late 
presentation is still safe.

To compare clinical and radiographic outcomes following antegrade versus 
retrograde intramedullary nailing of infraisthmic femoral shaft fractures.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Tertiary hospital in Tanzania.
PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with infraisthmic diaphyseal femur fractures.
INTERVENTION: Antegrade or retrograde SIGN intramedullary nail.
OUTCOMES: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL), radiographic healing, knee 
range of motion, pain, and alignment (defined as less than or equal to 5 degrees 
of angular deformity in both coronal and sagittal planes) assessed at 6, 12, 24, 
and 52 weeks postoperatively.
RESULTS: Of 160 included patients, 141 (88.1%) had 1-year follow-up and were 
included in analyses: 42 (29.8%) antegrade, 99 (70.2%) retrograde. 
Antegrade-nailed patients had more loss of coronal alignment (P = .026), but 
less knee pain at 6 months (P = .017) and increased knee flexion at 6 weeks 
(P = .021). There were no significant differences in reoperations, HRQOL, hip 
pain, knee extension, radiographic healing, or sagittal alignment.
CONCLUSIONS: Antegrade nailing of infraisthmic femur fractures had higher 
incidence of alignment loss, but no detectable differences in HRQOL, pain, 
radiographic healing, or reoperation. Retrograde nailing was associated with 
increased knee pain and decreased knee range of motion at early time points, but 
this dissipated by 1 year. To our knowledge, this is the first study to 
prospectively compare outcomes over 1 year in patients treated with antegrade 
versus retrograde SIGN intramedullary nailing of infraisthmic femur 
fractures.Level of Evidence: III.

BACKGROUND: Young adult cancer caregivers (YACC) may experience heightened 
caregiver burden because they take on caregiving during a dynamic time of life. 
The purpose of this study was to describe YACC experiences, burden, and social 
support while caregiving.
METHODS: Grounded by the Cancer Family Caregiving Experience Model and the 
Stress and Coping Social Support theory, semi-structured interviews were 
conducted with YACC. Inductive analysis was applied to YACC perceptions of 
caregiving, and deductive analysis to YACC social networks and social support.
RESULTS: YACC (N=34) were primarily between 25 to 29 years of age (38.2%), 
primarily female (70.6%), non-Hispanic White (91.2%), employed (85.3%), college 
graduates or higher (53.0%), and caring for a spouse/partner (52.9%). 
Qualitative analysis of interviews with YACC resulted in 2 themes: cancer 
caregiving during young adulthood and young adult cancer caregiver social 
support. In the first theme YACC often did not perceive themselves as 
caregivers, rather their caregiving responsibilities were viewed as an extension 
of their relationship with the patient. Further YACC reported 
developmental-specific responsibilities (eg, caring for young children, being 
unable to take time off while solidifying careers) which often conflicted with 
their caregiving responsibilities (eg, managing patient's medication, attending 
appointments) and heightened burden. In response, YACC often formed caregiver 
teams consisting of family, friends, and community members to care for their 
loved one. In the second theme YACC most commonly reported receiving emotional 
and instrumental support from their social network. YACC specifically mentioned 
their appreciation for emotional support provided by other young adults and 
instrumental support in the form of financial support.
CONCLUSIONS: YACC faced developmentally specific challenges during caregiving 
that older adult caregivers may not encounter. The conflict of young adult and 
caregiving responsibilities resulted in YACC forming caregiver teams. Thus, 
theoretical approaches to understand and improve caregiver health would benefit 
from the inclusion of the developmental context of young adulthood. Furthermore, 
it is crucial that cancer centers tailor supportive services to YACC as the 
number of young caregivers increases.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries experienced something of a boom in 
interest in gardening. Gardens have long been considered as refuges into which 
we retreat to escape various struggles and challenges. In this study we examine 
the characteristics and functions of the garden as a refuge during the period of 
increased garden interest associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of 
qualitative results about garden experiences from 3,743 survey respondents 
revealed intertwining garden and emotional geographies. Utilising 
non-representational and therapeutic landscape theories, we found multifarious 
and heightened experiences of non-material aspects of gardens; that is, the 
sensory and emotional aspects. People experienced, for example, a sense of joy, 
beauty, and reassurance, a greater attunement to the natural world and an 
increased sense of nature connection than they had at other times: birds felt 
louder. These heightened sensory and emotional experiences had therapeutic 
benefits, across age and geographical spectrums, during these difficult times. 
This research improves our understandings of the positive potential of 
non-material aspects of gardens in the creation of therapeutic landscapes in and 
beyond COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: Based on world experience, first, a modern assessment of the flora 
is needed to develop strategies for the conservation of ecosystems of rare and 
endangered plant species. A regional and global biodiversity strategy should 
focus on assessing the current state of bioresources. To preserve the 
biodiversity of the species and its habitat, we evaluated botanical features, 
ontogenetic phases, the ecological and phytocenotic structure of the rare and 
endangered of Rhodiola rosea L. (golden rose root) populations from the 
highlands of Eastern Kazakhstan.
RESULTS: R. rosea in the study region lives on damp mossy rocks, rocky slopes, 
overgrown moraines and along the banks of mountain rivers in the upper limit of 
cedar-larch forests, subalpine and alpine belts, in the altitude limit of 
1700-2400 m. In the studied region, R. rosea begins to vegetate in May-June, 
blooms in June-July, the fruits ripen in August. The species is encountered in 
the high mountain ranges of the Kazakh Altai and Saur-Tarabagatai. Unfavorable 
habitat conditions for the species are overgrown by sedge-grass and birch-moss 
communities. The most common species at sites with R. rosea are: Schulzia 
crinita, Achillea ledebourii, Doronicum altaicum, Macropodium nivale, 
Hylotelephium telephium, Rhodiola algida, Carex capillaris, C. aterrima. 
Ontogenetic study revealed that all age-related phases were present, with the 
exception of the senile states. Individual life expectancy shown to be 50-55 
years. The analysis of the species composition in the communities with R. rosea 
showed that the leading families in terms of the number of accompanying species 
are Poaceae, Ranunculaceae, Asteraceae, Rosaceae and Caryophyllaceae, Apiaceae, 
Fabaceae; while the most dominant genera are: Carex, Aconitum, Dracocephalum, 
Festuca, Pedicularis, Poa, Salix; the ecological groups are dominated by 
psychrophytes, mesophytes mesopsychrophytes; the Asian, Eurasian, and Holarctic 
groups are the most represented groups. Dominant life forms according to 
Serebyakov were rod-rooted, brush-rooted, short-rooted and long-rooted grasses, 
while based on Raunkiaer's groups the overwhelming majority consisted of 
Hemincryptophytes (74%).
CONCLUSIONS: The R. rosea populations of Kazakhstan represent an important gene 
stock of the species. Our study provides new insights into the species' biology 
thus contributes to the conservation of biodiversity on a wide spatial scale.

IMPORTANCE: US life expectancy and health outcomes for preventable causes of 
disease have continued to lag in many populations that experience racism.
OBJECTIVE: To propose iterative changes to US Preventive Services Task Force 
(USPSTF) processes, methods, and recommendations and enact a commitment to 
eliminate health inequities for people affected by systemic racism.
DESIGN AND EVIDENCE: In February 2021, the USPSTF began operational steps in its 
work to create preventive care recommendations to address the harmful effects of 
racism. A commissioned methods report was conducted to inform this process. Key 
findings of the report informed proposed updates to the USPSTF methods to 
address populations adversely affected by systemic racism and proposed pilots on 
implementation of the proposed changes.
FINDINGS: The USPSTF proposes to consider the opportunity to reduce health 
inequities when selecting new preventive care topics and prioritizing current 
topics; seek evidence about the effects of systemic racism and health inequities 
in all research plans and public comments requested, and integrate available 
evidence into evidence reviews; and summarize the likely effects of systemic 
racism and health inequities on clinical preventive services in USPSTF 
recommendations. The USPSTF will elicit feedback from its partners and experts 
and proposed changes will be piloted on selected USPSTF topics.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The USPSTF has developed strategies intended to 
mitigate the influence of systemic racism in its recommendations. The USPSTF 
seeks to reduce health inequities and other effects of systemic racism through 
iterative changes in methods of developing evidence-based recommendations, with 
partner and public input in the activities to implement the advancements.

IMPORTANCE: Decisions for older adults (aged ≥65 years) and their clinicians 
about whether to continue to screen for cancer are not easy. Many older adults 
who are frail or have limited life expectancy or comorbidities continue to be 
screened for cancer despite guidelines suggesting they should not; furthermore, 
many older adults have limited knowledge of the potential harms of continuing to 
be screened.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize the patient-reported factors associated with older 
adults' decisions regarding screening for breast, prostate, colorectal, and 
cervical cancer.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: Studies were identified by searching databases from January 
2000 to June 2020 and were independently assessed for inclusion by 2 authors. 
Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were independently conducted by 2 
authors, and then all decisions were cross-checked and discussed where 
necessary. Data analysis was performed from September to December 2020.
FINDINGS: The search yielded 2475 records, of which 21 unique studies were 
included. Nine studies were quantitative, 8 were qualitative, and 4 used mixed 
method designs. Of the 21 studies, 17 were conducted in the US, and 10 of 21 
assessed breast cancer screening decisions only. Factors associated with 
decision-making were synthesized into 5 categories: demographic, health and 
clinical, psychological, physician, and social and system. Commonly identified 
factors associated with the decision to undergo screening included personal or 
family history of cancer, positive screening attitudes, routine or habit, to 
gain knowledge, friends, and a physician's recommendation. Factors associated 
with the decision to forgo screening included being older, negative screening 
attitudes, and desire not to know about cancer. Some factors had varying 
associations, including insurance coverage, living in a nursing home, prior 
screening experience, health problems, limited life expectancy, perceived cancer 
risk, risks of screening, family, and a physician's recommendation to stop.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although guidelines suggest incorporating life 
expectancy and health status to inform older adults' cancer screening decisions, 
older adults' ingrained beliefs about screening may run counter to these 
concepts. Communication strategies are needed that support older adults to make 
informed cancer screening decisions by addressing underlying screening beliefs 
in context with their perceived and actual risk of developing cancer.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a common mental health condition with considerable 
negative impact on health and well-being. Although antidepressants are 
recommended as first-line treatment, there is limited evidence regarding the 
cost effectiveness of long-term maintenance antidepressants for preventing 
relapse.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to calculate the mean incremental costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 12 months of discontinuing long-term 
antidepressant medication in well patients compared with maintenance, using 
patient-level trial data.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis of 478 participants from 150 UK 
general practices recruited to a randomised, double-blind trial (ANTLER). QALYs 
were calculated from EQ-5D-5L and 12-Item Short Form survey (SF-12) results, 
with primary analysis using the EQ-5D-5L value set for England. Resource use was 
collected from primary care patient electronic medical records and 
self-completed questionnaires capturing mental-health-related resource use. 
Costs were calculated by applying standard UK unit costs to resource use. 
Adjustments were made for baseline variables.
RESULTS: Participants randomised to discontinuation had significantly worse 
utility scores at 3 months (- 0.032; 95% confidence interval [CI] - 0.053 to 
- 0.011) but no significant difference in QALYs (- 0.011; 95% CI - 0.026 to 
0.003) or costs (£3.11; 95% CI - 41.28 to 47.50) at 12 months. The probability 
that discontinuation was cost effective compared with maintenance was 12.9% at a 
threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Discontinuation of antidepressants was unlikely to be cost 
effective compared with maintenance for currently well patients on long-term 
antidepressants. However, this analysis provides no information on the wider 
impact of antidepressants. Our findings provide information on the potential 
impact of discontinuing long-term maintenance antidepressants and facilitate 
improving guidance for shared patient-clinician decision making.

Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by 
mutations in the α-galactosidase A (AGAL/GLA) gene. The lysosomal accumulation 
of the substrates globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine 
(lyso-Gb3) results in progressive renal failure, cardiomyopathy associated with 
cardiac arrhythmia, and recurrent strokes, significantly limiting life 
expectancy in affected patients. Current treatment options for FD include 
recombinant enzyme-replacement therapies (ERTs) with intravenous agalsidase-α 
(0.2 mg/kg body weight) or agalsidase-β (1 mg/kg body weight) every 2 weeks, 
facilitating cellular Gb3 clearance and an overall improvement of disease 
burden. However, ERT can lead to infusion-associated reactions, as well as the 
formation of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) in ERT-treated males, 
leading to an attenuation of therapy efficacy and thus disease progression. In 
this narrative review, we provide a brief overview of the clinical picture of FD 
and diagnostic confirmation. The focus is on the biochemical and clinical 
significance of neutralizing ADAs as a humoral response to ERT. In addition, we 
provide an overview of different methods for ADA measurement and 
characterization, as well as potential therapeutic approaches to prevent or 
eliminate ADAs in affected patients, which is representative for other 
ERT-treated lysosomal storage diseases.

BACKGROUND: Whilst access to cannabis-based medicinal products (CBMPs) has 
increased globally subject to relaxation of scheduling laws globally, one of the 
main barriers to appropriate patient access remains a paucity of high-quality 
evidence surrounding their clinical effects.
DISCUSSION: Whilst randomised controlled trials (RCTs) remain the gold-standard 
for clinical evaluation, there are notable barriers to their implementation. 
Development of CBMPs requires novel approaches of evidence collection to address 
these challenges. Real world evidence (RWE) presents a solution to not only both 
provide immediate impact on clinical care, but also inform well-conducted RCTs. 
RWE is defined as evidence derived from health data sourced from 
non-interventional studies, registries, electronic health records and insurance 
data. Currently it is used mostly to monitor post-approval safety requirements 
allowing for long-term pharmacovigilance. However, RWE has the potential to be 
used in conjunction or as an extension to RCTs to both broaden and streamline 
the process of evidence generation.
CONCLUSION: Novel approaches of data collection and analysis will be integral to 
improving clinical evidence on CBMPs. RWE can be used in conjunction or as an 
extension to RCTs to increase the speed of evidence generation, as well as 
reduce costs. Currently, there is an abundance of potential data however, whilst 
a number of platforms now exist to capture real world data it is important the 
right tools and analysis are utilised to unlock potential insights from these.

Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a multi-system genetically determined 
neurodevelopmental disorder and the commonest cause of syndromal obesity. The 
development of hyperphagia in early childhood is part of the phenotype arising 
as a result of an impaired neural response to food intake and the inability to 
regulate food intake in line with energy needs. Severe obesity develops if 
access to food is not controlled. In this review we evaluate the evidence for 
increased morbidity and mortality in PWS in order to establish the extent to 
which it is directly related to the obesity; a consequence of the eating 
behaviour itself independent of obesity; or associated with other 
characteristics of the syndrome. Medline, Cochrane, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Web of 
Science and Scopus databases were used to systematically identify published 
material on PWS and hyperphagia and syndrome-related morbidity and mortality. 
One hundred and ten key papers were selected. Data on 500 people with PWS 
indicated that the average age of death was 21 years and obesity was, as 
expected, a significant factor. However, the behaviour of hyperphagia itself, 
independent of obesity, was also important, associated with choking, gastric 
rupture, and/or respiratory illness. Other syndrome-related factors increased 
the risk for, and seriousness of, co-morbid illness or accidents. We conclude 
that improving life-expectancy largely depends on managing the immediate 
non-obesity and obesity-related consequences of the hyperphagia, through 
improved support. The development of new treatments that significantly reduce 
the drive to eat are likely to decrease morbidity and mortality improving 
quality of life and life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Knee joint distraction (KJD) has received much attention as a joint 
preserving surgery, especially in young patients with advanced knee 
osteoarthritis (OA).
METHODS: This study included 16 patients with advanced knee OA who underwent KJD 
combined with marrow stimulating techniques and were followed up for more than 
2 years. The patients' clinical scores, including the Japanese Orthopaedic 
Association (JOA) score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) 
subscales, ROM, joint space width, and semiquantitative MRI were evaluated. The 
factors affecting clinical outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Postoperatively, the JOA score and the individual scores of the KOOS 
subscales improved significantly (JOA score: P = 0.0028, KOOS-symptoms: 
P = 0.0016, -pain: P = 0.0011, -ADL: P = 0.0009, -sports/recreation: P = 0.0144, 
and -QOL: P = 0.0034). Although the extension of the knee joint did not change 
throughout the follow-up period, flexion of the joint deteriorated at the time 
of device removal but recovered to the preoperative level at the final 
follow-up. Preoperative joint space width was 2.4 ± 2.0 mm and at the final 
follow-up, it increased to 3.3 ± 1.5 mm, showing statistically significant 
improvement (P = 0.034). The postoperative semiquantitative MRI score also 
improved significantly (from 6.0 ± 3.0 to 42.1 ± 28.7, P = 0.0001). A high BMI 
was associated with a poor clinical outcome.
CONCLUSION: Although the effect of marrow stimulating techniques for cartilage 
repair was not well clarified and the complication rate was high, the clinical 
and radiographic outcomes showed significant improvement after KJD combined with 
marrow stimulating techniques in patients with advanced knee OA. However, we 
should be careful about suggesting this procedure in obese patients.

The goal of our paper is to provide our perspectives on why there is a need to 
change the narrative in academic surgery to improve health equity by increasing 
the pipeline of pre-med students to professors. It is well documented that 
Health disparities hurt many different people, but they especially hurt Black, 
Indigenous, and People of color. Black men and women have a decreased life 
expectancy. Differences in care are associated with greater mortality among 
minority patients and that care provided to black patients by black physicians 
can lead to improved compliance with medications and care plans. The lack of 
black diversity in the medical profession proportional to the societal ethnic 
distribution is alarming. We have opportunities for improvement for recruitment, 
retention and promotion within the field of surgery.

BACKGROUND: Patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral 
artery disease (PAD) are at substantial risk of atherothrombotic events. The 
COMPASS trial showed that patients with stable CAD or PAD experienced 
significant benefits after treatment with rivaroxaban in combination with 
acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) compared with ASA alone. This paper aims to provide 
insight into the clinical and economic consequences of treatment with 
rivaroxaban from a Dutch societal perspective.
METHODS: The clinical and economic implications of rivaroxaban in terms of the 
number of events prevented, costs, the incremental cost per life-years gained 
(LYG), and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 
determined based on a cost-effectiveness model for patients with stable CAD or 
PAD and in high-risk subgroups (i.e. patients with CAD and PAD, CAD and prior 
myocardial infarction and renal impairment, CAD and heart failure) using results 
from the Cardiovascular OutcoMes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies 
(COMPASS) trial.
RESULTS: Patients treated with rivaroxaban have an expected increased discounted 
life expectancy of 0.67 years. In high-risk groups discounted incremental life 
expectancy ranged from 1.33 to 1.90 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio for the full COMPASS population was €9,760/LYG and €12,033/QALY, whereas, 
for high-risk subgroups of patients with underlying conditions, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from €2,966/LYG to €5,052/LYG and from 
€3,940/QALY to €6,815/QALY. Results from the sensitivity analyses revealed that 
the model results were robust to variations in single or multiple input 
parameters at once.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that rivaroxaban in 
combination with ASA is a cost-effective treatment option in stable CAD or PAD 
patients. Rivaroxaban in combination with ASA is even more cost-effective in 
high-risk subgroups.

BACKGROUND: Although the harm to health from electronic nicotine delivery 
systems (ENDS) compared to smoked tobacco remains highly uncertain, society and 
governments still need to know the likely range of the relative harm to inform 
regulatory policies for ENDS and smoking.
METHODS: We identified biomarkers with specificity of association with different 
disease groupings e.g., volatile organic compound (VOCs) for chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease; and tobacco-specific N´-nitrosamines (TSNAs) and polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for all cancers. We conducted a review of recent 
studies (post January 2017) that compared these biomarkers between people 
exclusively using ENDS and those exclusively smoking tobacco. The percentage 
differences in these biomarkers, weighted by study size and adjusted for 
acrolein from other sources, were used as a proxy for the assumed percentage 
difference in disease harm between ENDS and smoking. These relative differences 
were applied to previously modelled estimates of smoking-related health loss (in 
health-adjusted life-years; HALYs).
RESULTS: The respective relative biomarker levels (ENDS vs smoking) were: 28% 
for respiratory diseases (five results, three studies); 42% for cancers (five 
results, four studies); and 35% for cardiovascular (seven results, four 
studies). When integrated with the HALY impacts by disease, the overall harm to 
health from ENDS was estimated to be 33% that of smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis, suggests that the use of modern ENDS devices 
(vaping) could be a third as harmful to health as smoking in a high-income 
country setting. But this estimate is based on a limited number of biomarker 
studies and is best be considered a likely upper level of ENDS risk given 
potential biases in our method (i.e., the biomarkers used being correlated with 
more unaccounted for toxicants in smoking compared to with using ENDS).

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common autosomal recessive 
diseases. Factors contributing to disease exacerbations and survival rate of CF 
patients are type of mutation in the CFTR gene, poor nutritional status, lung 
failure, and infection development by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The study aimed to 
evaluate the relationship between the severity of mutation, nutritional status, 
lung function, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa prevalence and survival rate in adult 
patients with cystic fibrosis.
METHODS: A study of 124 (68 ♀ and 56 ♂) adults with CF aged 18-51 years were 
evaluated for (a) type of mutation in the CFTR gene, (b) nutritional status 
(BMI), (c) lung function (FEV1%), and (d) Pseudomonas aeruginosa prevalence. For 
statistical calculations, Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival, chi-squared test 
for multiple samples, and logistic regression were used.
RESULTS: The type of mutation (χ2 = 12.73, df = 3, p = 0.005), FEV1% (χ2 = 
15.20, df = 2, p = 0.0005), Pseudomonas aeruginosa prevalence (χ2 = 11.48, df = 
3, p = 0.009), and BMI (χ2 = 31.08, df = 4, p < 0.000) significantly 
differentiated the probability of survival of patients with CF. The shortest 
life expectancy was observed in patients with a severe type of mutation on both 
alleles, FEV1% < 40, subjects in whom Pseudomonas culture was extensively 
drug-resistant or pandrug-resistant, and patients whose BMI was lower than 
18.5 kg/m2. The period from 30 to 40 years of age was the most critical in CF 
adults' lifespan. The risk of adults with CF death doubled with Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa prevalence (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.29; 2.28) and eightfold when the 
bacteria acquired antibiotic resistance (OR = 8.11, 95% CI 1.67; 38.15).
CONCLUSIONS: All factors included in the study were significantly related to the 
survival rate of patients with cystic fibrosis.

Assessment of Mortality Rate in 10 Years and the Associated Risk Factors in 
Schizophrenia.

[Article in English, Turkish]

Yaşar H, Yildiz M.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the mortality rate and the 
associated risks factors in patients with schizophrenia during a10- year follow 
up period.
METHOD: We searched the records of patients with schizophrenia receiving 
treatment as outpatients and/or inpatients in the psychiatric clinic of a 
university hospital between 2004 and 2008 and determine the survival of these 
patients by the end of 2018. The results were compared with the all cause 
mortality rate in the general population during the same period. Also, the risk 
factors affecting the mortality rate among the patients were investigated.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 626 registered patients 506 were included in the 
study. The mortality rate within 10 years was found to be 10.6%, with a mean age 
of 53.1 years at the time of death. The overall expected life expectancy was 
73.4 years; varying between 66.6 years among the males and 77.6 years among the 
females; and 64.7 and 76.5 years among smokers and non-smokers, respectively. 
The overall standardized mortality rate (SMR) was 3.7, being 3.9 among the males 
and 3.3 among the females. The risk factors that were associated with the death 
were old age, male gender, smoking, not working, and early age of disease onset.
CONCLUSION: Smoking is a significant risk factor for mortality. Giving priority 
to programs for stopping smoking, and supporting rehabilitation services that 
enables patients to get involved in could help reducing the mortality risk.
