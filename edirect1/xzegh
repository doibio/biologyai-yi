INTRODUCTION: Maharashtra, India, remained a hotspot during the COVID-19 
pandemic. After the initial complete lockdown, the state slowly relaxed 
restrictions. We aim to estimate the lockdown's impact on COVID-19 cases and 
associated healthcare costs.
METHODS: Using daily case data for 84 days (9 March-31 May 2020), we modeled the 
epidemic's trajectory and predicted new cases for different phases of lockdown. 
We fitted log-linear models to estimate the growth rate, basic (R0), daily 
reproduction number (Re), and case doubling time. Based on pre-restriction and 
Phase 1 R0, we predicted new cases for the rest of the restriction phases, and 
we compared them with the actual number of cases during each phase. Furthermore, 
using the published and gray literature, we estimated the costs and savings of 
implementing these restrictions for the projected period, and we performed a 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The estimated median R0 during the different phases was 1.14 (95% CI: 
0.85, 1.45) for pre-lockdown, 1.67 (95% CI: 1.50, 1.82) for phase 1 (strict 
mobility restrictions), 1.24 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.35) for phase 2 (extension of 
phase 1 with no restrictions on agricultural and essential services), 1.12 (95% 
CI: 1.01, 1.23) for phase 3 (extension of phase 2 with mobility relaxations in 
areas with few infections), and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.123) for phase 4 
(implementation of localized lockdowns in high-case-load areas with fewer 
restrictions on other areas), respectively. The corresponding doubling time rate 
for cases (in days) was 17.78 (95% CI: 5.61, -15.19), 3.87 (95% CI: 3.15, 5.00), 
10.37 (95% CI: 7.10, 19.30), 20.31 (95% CI: 10.70, 212.50), and 45.56 (95% CI: 
20.50, -204.52). For the projected period, the cases could have reached 631,819 
without the lockdown, as the actual reported number of cases was 64,975. From a 
healthcare perspective, the estimated total value of averted cases was INR 
194.73 billion (USD 2.60 billion), resulting in net cost savings of 84.05%. The 
Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) per Quality Adjusted Life Year 
(QALY) for implementing the lockdown, rather than observing the natural course 
of the pandemic, was INR 33,812.15 (USD 450.83).
CONCLUSION: Maharashtra's early public health response delayed the pandemic and 
averted new cases and deaths during the first wave of the pandemic. However, we 
recommend that such restrictions be carefully used while considering the local 
socio-economic realities in countries like India.

(1) Background: Although metastatic spine disease is increasing, the debate on 
therapeutic modality remains due to the heterogeneity of tumors and patients. 
This study aims to evaluate the efficacies of surgery and risk factors for 
patients' survival from potentially unstable spinal metastasis of non-small cell 
lung cancer; (2) Methods: Twenty-two patients undergoing surgery and 
radiotherapy (group I) were compared with 22 patients undergoing radiotherapy 
alone (group II) using propensity score matching in a 1-to-1 format. Clinical 
outcomes included the performance status and ambulatory status. In addition, 
independent risk factors for patients' survival were evaluated, including the 
molecular targeted therapy for mutations; (3) Results: deterioration in 
neurologic status was only observed in group II compared to group I (22.7% vs. 
0%, p-value = 0.018). In addition, five patients in the surgery group showed 
improved Frankel grades. Regarding the patients' survival, a smoking history of 
more than ten pack-years (hazard ratio (HR) = 12.18), worse performance status 
(HR = 6.86), and absence of mutations (HR = 3.39) were the independent risk 
factors; (4) Conclusions: Spinal surgery with radiotherapy could have advantages 
for improving the neurologic status including ambulation for potentially 
unstable spine due to metastasis. Thus, surgery should be considered for 
patients with a longer life expectancy resulting from better performance status 
and use of the targeted therapy.

Background: The present study reports on the outcomes of our mono-institutional 
experience of Helical Tomotherapy (HT)-based SRT for brain metastases. The use 
of this linac is less frequently reported for this kind of treatment. Methods: 
This retrospective study displays a series of patients treated with HT-SRT. The 
eligibility of using SRT for brain metastases was defined by a Karnofsky 
performance status of >70, a life expectancy of >6 months, and controlled 
extra-cranial disease; no SRT was allowed in the case of a number of brain 
metastases larger than 10. All the cases were discussed by a multidisciplinary 
board. Toxicity assessments were performed based on CTCAE v5.0. Survival 
endpoints were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariate and 
multivariate analyses were carried out to identify any potential predictive 
factor for an improved outcome. Results: Sixty-four lesions in 37 patients were 
treated using HT-SRT with a median total dose of 30 Gy in five fractions. The 
median follow-up was 7 months, and the 1- and 2-year LC rates were both 92.5%. 
The IPFS rates were and 56.75% and 51.35%. The OS rates were 54% and 40%. The UA 
showed better IPFS rates significantly related to male sex (p = 0.049), a BED12 
of ≥42 Gy (p = 0.006), and controlled extracranial disease (p = 0.03); in the 
MA, a favorable trend towards LC (p = 0.11) and higher BED (p = 0.11) schedules 
maintained a correlation with improved IPFS rates, although statistical 
significance was not reached. Conclusions: HT-based SRT for brain metastases 
showed safety and efficacy in our monoinstiutional experience. Higher RT doses 
showed statistical significance for improved outcomes of LC and OS.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) after craniotomy lead to additional morbidity 
and mortality for patients, which are related to higher costs for the healthcare 
system. Furthermore, SSIs are associated with a longer hospital stay for the 
patient, which is particularly detrimental in glioblastoma patients due to their 
limited life expectancy. Risk factors for SSIs have already been described for 
craniotomies in general. However, there is limited data available for 
glioblastoma patients. As postoperative radiation influences wound healing, very 
early radiation is suspected to be a risk factor for SSI. Nevertheless, there 
are no data on the optimal timing of radiotherapy. To define risk factors for 
these patients, we analyzed our collective. We performed a retrospective 
analysis of all operations with histological evidence of a glioblastoma between 
2012 and 2021. Open biopsy and tumor removal (gross total resection, subtotal 
resection) were included. Stereotactic biopsies were excluded. Demographic data 
such as age and gender, as well as duration of surgery, diameter of the 
trepanation, postoperative radiation with interval, postoperative chemotherapy, 
highest blood glucose level, previous surgery, ASA score, foreign material 
introduced, subgaleal suction drainage, ventricle opening and length of hospital 
stay, were recorded. The need for surgical revision due to infection was 
registered as an SSI. A total of 177 patients were included, of which 14 
patients (7.9%) suffered an SSI. These occurred after a median of 45 days. The 
group with SSIs tended to include more men (57.1%, p = 0.163) and more 
pre-operated patients (50%, p = 0.125). In addition, foreign material and 
subgaleal suction drains had been implanted more frequently and the ventricles 
had been opened more frequently, without reaching statistical significance. 
Surprisingly, significantly more patients without SSIs had been irradiated 
(80.3%, p = 0.03). The results enable a better risk assessment of SSIs in 
glioblastoma patients. Patients with previous surgery, introduced foreign 
material, subgaleal suction drain and opening of the ventricle may have a 
slightly higher for SSIs. However, because none of these factors were 
significant, we should not call them risk factors. A less radical approach to 
surgery potentially involving these factors is not justified. The postulated 
negative role of irradiation was not confirmed, hence a rapid chemoradiation 
should be induced to achieve the best possible oncologic outcome.

Due to the chronic relapsing nature of mental disorders and increased life 
expectancy, the societal burden of these non-communicable diseases will increase 
even further. Treatments for mental disorders, such as depression, are 
available, but their effect is limited due to patients' (genetic) heterogeneity, 
low treatment compliance and frequent side effects. In general, only one-third 
of the patients respond to treatment. Today, medication selection in psychiatry 
relies on a trial-and-error approach based mainly on physicians' experience. 
Pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing can help in this process by determining the 
person-specific genetic factors that may predict clinical response and side 
effects associated with genetic variants that impact drug-metabolizing enzymes, 
drug transporters or drug targets. PGxis a discipline that investigates genetic 
factors that affect the absorption, metabolism, and transport of drugs, thereby 
affecting therapy outcome. These genetic factors can, among other things, lead 
to differences in the activity of enzymes that metabolize drugs. Studies in 
depressed patients show that genotyping of drug-metabolizing enzymes can 
increase the effectiveness of treatment, which could benefit millions of 
patients worldwide. This review highlights these studies, gives recommendations 
and provides future perspectives on how to proceed with PGx testing. Finally, it 
is recommended to consider genotyping for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, when there is an 
indication (side effects or inefficacy).

Malignant melanoma rarely develops in mucous membranes. Statistical data show 
that approximately 0.6-9.3% of patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma will 
develop metastases in the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa, and within these 
metastatic sites, the least common are the laryngeal and tracheobronchial ones. 
This exceedingly rare clinical entity has no clear treatment recommendations; 
radical surgery does not seem to benefit the patient in term of life expectancy. 
We present the case of a 56-year-old male patient diagnosed with laryngeal and 
tracheobronchial melanoma metastases. Prior to admission to our clinic the 
patient had a personal history of malignant melanoma of the nuchal region 
operated on 7 years ago, malignant melanoma of the gallbladder and metastatic 
left axillary polyadenopathy for which he underwent surgical treatment 3 months 
prior. Histopathological and immunohistochemical reports established the 
diagnosis of laryngeal metastasis of malignant melanoma. Genetic molecular 
analysis was positive for B-Raf (BRAF) gene and hence Vemurafenib was 
administered, with a favorable outcome at the one-year follow-up. Nevertheless, 
there are currently no clear universally accepted guidelines for the treatment 
of laryngeal melanoma, mainly due to the rarity of this clinical entity. We 
conducted a review of similar cases reported in the literature. Interestingly, 
reviewing the cases reported in the literature, it appears that laryngeal 
metastases of a primary cutaneous melanoma are more common in men, with an 
average time to metastasis of 4.3 years.

Liver transplantation (LT) represents the primary curative option for HCC. 
Despite the extension of transplantation criteria and conversion with 
down-staging loco-regional treatments, transplantation is not always possible. 
The introduction of new standards of care in advanced HCC including a 
combination of immune checkpoint inhibitor-based therapies led to an improvement 
in response rates and could represent a promising strategy for down-staging the 
tumor burden. In this review, we identify reports and series, comprising a total 
of 43 patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitors as bridging or 
down-staging therapies prior to LT. Overall, treated patients registered an 
objective response rate of 21%, and 14 patients were reduced within the Milan 
criteria. Graft rejection was reported in seven patients, resulting in the death 
of four patients; in the remaining cases, LT was performed safely after 
immunotherapy. Further investigations are required to define the duration of 
immune checkpoint inhibitors, their minimum washout period and the LT long-term 
safety of this strategy. Some randomized clinical trials including immunotherapy 
combinations, loco-regional treatment and/or tyrosine kinase inhibitors are 
ongoing and will likely determine the appropriateness of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors' administration before LT.

Lung transplantation for people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) is a critical 
therapeutic option, in a disease without a cure to this day, and its overall 
success in this population is evident. The medical advancements in knowledge, 
treatment, and clinical care in the field of cystic fibrosis (CF) rapidly 
expanded and improved over the last several decades, starting from early 
pathology reports of CF organ involvement in 1938, to the identification of the 
CF gene in 1989. Lung transplantation for CF has been performed since 1983, and 
CF now accounts for about 17% of pre-transplantation diagnoses in lung 
transplantation recipients. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR) modulators have been the latest new therapeutic modality addressing the 
underlying CF protein defect with the first modulator, ivacaftor, approved in 
2012. Fast forward to today, and we now have a growing CF population. More than 
half of PwCF are now adults, and younger patients face a better life expectancy 
than they ever did before. Unfortunately, CFTR modulator therapy is not 
effective in all patients, and efficacy varies among patients; it is not a cure, 
and CF remains a progressive disease that leads predominantly to respiratory 
failure. Lung transplantation remains a lifesaving treatment for this disease. 
Here, we reviewed the current knowledge of lung transplantation in PwCF, the 
challenges associated with its implementation, and the ongoing changes to the 
field as we enter a new era in the care of PwCF. Improved life expectancy in 
PwCF will surely influence the role of transplantation in patient care and may 
even lead to a change in the demographics of which people benefit most from 
transplantation.

The Japanese population has the world's longest life expectancy but faces the 
challenge of extending the healthy life expectancy without developing chronic 
diseases. Therefore, the effectiveness of products derived from olives used in 
the Mediterranean diet as a potential dietary solution has attracted attention. 
This study examined the effects of desert olive tree pearls (DOTPs), which 
contain 162 times more polyphenol hydroxytyrosol than olive oil, on the 
cognitive function of middle-aged and older adults using the Cognitrax test. 
Participants (aged 51-82 years) were assigned to the DOTP intake (n = 36) or 
placebo group (n = 36) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group study. The participants received 3 g of DOTPs or placebo in olive 
oil twice daily for 12 weeks. Among cognitive domains, complex attention had a 
significant time × group interaction effect (p = 0.049) between the DOTP and 
placebo groups. The simple main effect for this item was significantly different 
(p < 0.001 and p = 0.572, respectively). Time effects were significant (p < 
0.05) for the psychomotor speed, reaction time, cognitive flexibility, 
processing speed, and executive function domains. Therefore, DOTPs have the 
potential to alleviate cognitive problems faced by middle-aged and older adults 
in Japan.

Atherosclerosis, chronic non-communicable diseases, and metabolic syndrome are 
highly interconnected and collectively contribute to global health concerns that 
reduce life expectancy and quality of life. These conditions arise from multiple 
risk factors, including inflammation, insulin resistance, impaired blood lipid 
profile, endothelial dysfunction, and increased cardiovascular risk. Adopting a 
plant-based diet has gained popularity as a viable alternative to promote health 
and mitigate the incidence of, and risk factors associated with, these three 
health conditions. Understanding the potential benefits of a plant-based diet 
for human health is crucial, particularly in the face of the rising prevalence 
of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, 
and cancer. Thus, this review focused on the plausible advantages of consuming a 
type of food pattern for the prevention and/or treatment of chronic diseases, 
emphasizing the dietary aspects that contribute to these conditions and the 
evidence supporting the benefits of a plant-based diet for human health. To 
facilitate a more in-depth analysis, we present separate evidence for each of 
these three concepts, acknowledging their intrinsic connection while providing a 
specific focus on each one. This review underscores the potential of a 
plant-based diet to target the underlying causes of these chronic diseases and 
enhance health outcomes for individuals and populations.

tet(X4) is the critical resistance gene for tigecycline degradation that has 
been continually reported in recent years. In particular, pathogenic bacteria 
carrying tet(X4) are a severe threat to human health. However, information 
describing Escherichia coli coharboring tet(X4) with virulence genes is limited. 
Here, we isolated an E. coli strain coharboring tet(X4) and the heat-stable 
toxin gene astA from a dead piglet. The strain named 812A1-131 belongs to ST10. 
The genome was sequenced using the Nanopore and Illumina platforms. The 
virulence genes astA and tet(X4) are located on the chromosome and in the 
IncHI1-type plasmid p812A1-tetX4-193K, respectively. The plasmid could be 
conjugatively transferred to recipient E. coli J53 with high frequency. In vivo 
experiments showed that strain 812A1-131 is pathogenic to Galleria mellonella 
and could colonize the intestines of mice. In summary, pathogenic E. coli could 
receive a plasmid harboring the tet(X4) gene, which can increase the difficulty 
of treatment. The prevalence and transmission mechanisms of pathogenic bacteria 
coharboring the tet(X4) gene need more attention.

A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a group of autonomous sensors geographically 
distributed for environmental monitoring and tracking purposes. Since the 
sensors in the WSN have limited battery capacity, the energy efficiency is 
considered a challenging task because of redundant data transmission and 
inappropriate routing paths. In this research, a Quasi-Oppositional Learning 
(QOL)-based African Vulture Optimization Algorithm (AVOA), referred to as QAVOA, 
is proposed for an effective data fusion and cluster-based routing in a WSN. The 
QAVOA-based Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is developed to optimize the 
weights and threshold coefficients for removing the redundant information and 
decreasing the amount of transmitted data over the network. Moreover, the 
QAVOA-based optimal Cluster Head Node (CHN) selection and route discovery are 
carried out for performing reliable data transmission. An elimination of 
redundant data during data fusion and optimum shortest path discovery using the 
proposed QAVOA-BPNN is used to minimize the energy usage of the nodes, which 
helps to increase the life expectancy. The QAVOA-BPNN is analyzed by using the 
energy consumption, life expectancy, throughput, End to End Delay (EED), Packet 
Delivery Ratio (PDR) and Packet Loss Ratio (PLR). The existing approaches such 
as Cross-Layer-based Harris-Hawks-Optimization (CL-HHO) and Improved Sparrow 
Search using Differential Evolution (ISSDE) are used to evaluate the QAVOA-BPNN 
method. The life expectancy of QAVOA-BPNN for 500 nodes is 4820 rounds, which is 
high when compared to the CL-HHO and ISSDE.

INTRODUCTION: Socioeconomic factors have been recognized by the WHO as 
determinants of health, and it is important to consider these factors in 
decision making to curb existing inequality in vaccination for SARS-CoV-2, which 
causes COVID-19.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether there is a correlation between 
socioeconomic factors and vaccination worldwide and measure inequality.
METHOD: A study of secondary sources was carried out to assess inequality in 
vaccination against COVID-19 worldwide and its association with socioeconomic 
factors. For this assessment, 169 countries were chosen from January 2020 to 
March 2022 using LibreOffice and JASP 0.16.1.10. Several mathematical models and 
statistical tests were used, including a normality test, an analysis of 
frequencies and proportions, a Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman's correlations, a 
Lorenz curve, a Concentration Index, and a slope.
RESULTS: Correlations were found between socioeconomic factors and vaccination 
with one, two, and three doses. As the GDP showed correlations of 0.71 for one 
dose and 0.82 for three doses, we found that the greater the competitiveness of 
the countries, the higher the percentage of vaccinated individuals in their 
populations. According to the Concentration Index, there was greater inequality 
in vaccination with regard to receiving a higher number of doses, as reflected 
in the life expectancy indices of 0.16-0.19 and 0.50. The continent with the 
highest degree of inequality was Africa, and the continent with the lowest 
degree was America. South Americans were vaccinated with two doses at a rate of 
6.19%/month, which was 4.3 times faster than Africans, with 72% of the 
population being vaccinated in South America, compared to only 16% in Africa.
CONCLUSION: There is inequality in vaccination against COVID-19 with one, two, 
and three doses, which is associated with socioeconomic factors.

The genus Flavivirus is a group of arthropod-borne single-stranded RNA viruses, 
which includes important human and animal pathogens such as Japanese 
encephalitis virus (JEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever 
virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). 
Reverse genetics has been a useful tool for understanding biological properties 
and the pathogenesis of flaviviruses. However, the conventional construction of 
full-length infectious clones for flavivirus is time-consuming and difficult due 
to the toxicity of the flavivirus genome to E. coli. Herein, we applied a 
simple, rapid, and bacterium-free circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER) 
method to synthesize recombinant flaviviruses in vertebrate cells as well as 
insect cells. We started with the de novo synthesis of the JEV vaccine strain 
SA-14-14-2 in Vero cells using CPER, and then modified the CPER method to 
recover insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) in mosquito C6/36 cells. Chimeric 
Zika virus (ChinZIKV) based on the Chaoyang virus (CYV) backbone and the Culex 
flavivirus reporter virus expressing green fluorescent protein (CxFV-GFP) were 
subsequently rescued in C6/36 cells. CPER is a simple method for the rapid 
generation of flaviviruses and other potential RNA viruses. A CPER-based 
recovery system for flaviviruses of different host ranges was established, which 
would facilitate the development of countermeasures against flavivirus outbreaks 
in the future.

University, Shanghai 201508, China.

BACKGROUND: China initiated its national free antiretroviral therapy program in 
2004 and saw a dramatic decline in mortality among the population with HIV. 
However, the morbidity of non-AIDS-defining cancers such as breast cancer is 
steadily growing as life expectancy improves. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of breast cancer patients 
with HIV in China.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 21 breast cancer patients with HIV and 396 
breast cancer patients without HIV treated at the Shanghai public health 
clinical center from 2014-2022 was collected. After propensity score matching, 
21 paired patients in the two groups were obtained and compared. The optimal 
cut-off value of preoperative biomarkers for recurrence was determined via 
maximally selected log-rank statistics. Preoperative biomarkers were categorized 
into high and low groups, based on the best cut-off values and compared using 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards 
regression model was used to perform univariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 38 months (IQR: 20-68 months) for the 
propensity-score-matching cohort. The progression-free survival at 1, 2 and 3 
years for patients with and without HIV were 74.51%, 67.74%, and 37.63% and 
95.24%, 95.24%, and 90.48%, respectively. The overall survival for patients with 
HIV at 1, 2 and 3 years were 94.44%, 76.74%, and 42.63%. After multivariate 
analysis, Only HIV status (hazard ratios (HRs) = 6.83, 95% [confidence intervals 
(CI)] 1.22-38.12) were associated with progression-free survival. Based on the 
best cut-off value, CD8 showed discriminative value for overall survival (p = 
0.04), whereas four variables, the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (p = 0.02), 
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.03), CD3 (p = 0.01) and CD8 (p < 0.01) were 
suggested be significant for progression-free survival. The univariate analysis 
suggested that CD3 (HRs = 0.10, 95% [CI] 0.01-0.90) and lymphocyte-to-monocyte 
ratio (HRs = 0.22, 95% [CI] 0.05-0.93) were identified as significant predictors 
for progression-free survival.
CONCLUSION: In this study, breast cancer in patients with HIV in China reflected 
a more aggressive nature with a more advanced diagnostic stage and worse 
prognosis. Moreover, preoperative immune and inflammatory biomarkers might play 
a role in the prognosis of breast cancer patients with HIV.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The INTRO-HCV randomized controlled trial conducted in 
Norway over 2017-2019 found that integrated treatment, compared with 
standard-of-care hospital treatment, for hepatitis C virus (HCV) with 
direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) improved treatment outcomes among people who 
inject drugs (PWID). We evaluated cost-effectiveness of the INTRO-HCV 
intervention.
DESIGN: A Markov health state transition model of HCV disease progression and 
treatment with cost-effectiveness analysis from the health-provider perspective. 
Primary cost, utility, and health outcome data were derived from the trial. 
Costs and health benefits (quality-adjusted life-years, QALYs) were tracked over 
50 years. Probabilistic and univariate sensitivity analyses investigated DAA 
price reductions and variations in HCV treatment and disease care cost 
assumptions, using costs from different countries (Norway, United Kingdom, 
United States, France, Australia).
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: PWID attending community-based drug treatment centers 
for people with opioid dependence in Norway.
MEASUREMENTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of cost per 
QALY gained, compared against a conventional (€70 000/QALY) willingness-to-pay 
threshold for Norway and lower (€20 000/QALY) threshold common among high-income 
countries.
FINDINGS: Integrated treatment resulted in an ICER of €13 300/QALY gained, with 
99% and 71% probability of being cost-effective against conventional and lower 
willingness-to-pay thresholds, respectively. A 30% lower DAA price reduced the 
ICER to €6 900/QALY gained, with 91% probability of being cost-effective at the 
lower willingness-to-pay threshold. A 60% and 90% lower DAA price had 36% and 
>99% probability of being cost-saving, respectively. Sensitivity analyses 
suggest integrated treatment was cost-effective at the lower willingness-to-pay 
threshold (>60% probability) across different assumptions on HCV treatment and 
disease care costs with 30% DAA price reduction, and became cost-saving with 
60%-90% price reductions.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrated hepatitis C virus treatment for people who inject drugs 
in community settings is likely cost-effective compared with standard-of-care 
referral pathways in Norway and may be cost-saving in settings with particular 
characteristics.

Hemophilia is an X-linked bleeding disorder, characterized by low plasma levels 
of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) (hemophilia A) or FIX (hemophilia B). Because 
of this, hemophilia patients (HP) were considered as naturally-anticoagulated 
and therefore protected from thrombosis. Over the last decades hemophilia care 
underwent striking changes by the introduction of prophylaxis with repeated 
injections of standard or modified coagulation factor products that maintain 
steady-state trough levels of the deficient factor. Meanwhile, new medications, 
not based on replacement therapy, were developed (i.e., emicizumab and others). 
However, emicizumab (the only licensed drug) can be used only for prophylaxis; 
during acute bleeding or surgery, HP require additional therapies, supplementing 
emicizumab with FVIII/IX concentrates or with bypassing agents (e.g., 
recombinant activated FVII or activated prothrombin complex concentrate). Owing 
to the new therapeutic strategies, the hemostatic competency of HP is now much 
better assured than in the past and therefore their life expectancy is 
considerably improved. Furthermore, the combined effects of the improved 
life-expectancy and of the steady-state hemostatic competence achieved by 
prophylaxis, make HP to be near(normal). They are, therefore, liable to be 
affected by the circumstantial risk factors of venous thromboembolism (VTE) that 
are common in the general population. Furthermore, HP undergo frequent 
surgery/invasive procedures (especially major orthopedic surgery) when they are 
treated with coagulation factor concentrates or bypassing agents that may 
increase the risk of post-operative VTE. Therefore, one wonders if HP should be 
considered for perioperative antithrombotic prophylaxis to prevent postoperative 
VTE.Clinical data on the value of antithrombotic prophylaxis in this setting are 
scanty. Indeed, data from an observational multicentre prospective study of 46 
HP who underwent orthopedic surgery concluded that the prevalence of 
postoperative symptomatic VTE was similar to that estimated in the general 
population. Multicenter prospective trials are warranted to address the value of 
antithrombotic prophylaxis to avoid post-operative VTE in HP, especially during 
major surgery when regular prophylaxis is supplemented with additional 
coagulation factor products or bypassing agents. Until this information is 
available, HP undergoing major surgery whilst on antihemorrhagic prophylaxis 
supplemented with coagulation factor concentrates or bypassing agents, should at 
least receive intermittent pneumatic compression.

The present study was conducted to determine the effect of indole acetic acid 
(IAA) and Citrate Capped Silver Nanoparticles (Cit-AgNPs) on various attributes 
of maize under induced salinity stress. Seeds of the said variety were collected 
from Cereal Crop Research Institute (CCRI) Pirsabaq, Nowshera, sterilized and 
sown in earthen pots filled with 2 kg silt and soil (1:2) in triplicates in the 
green house of the Botany Department, University of Peshawar. Nanoparticles were 
analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray 
Spectroscopy (EDX), Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and Differential thermal 
analysis (DTA). Results of SEM revealed spherical morphology of Cit-AgNPs while 
EDX showed various elemental composition. TGA showed dominant weight loss up to 
300 °C while the DTA showed major exothermic peaks at 420 °C. High Salinity 
concentration (80 mM) imposed significant detrimental impacts by reducing the 
agronomic attributes, photosynthetic pigments, osmolytes and antioxidant 
enzymes, which was remarkably ameliorated by the foliar application of Cit-AgNPs 
and IAA. Agronomic attributes including leaf, root and shoot fresh and dry 
weight was improved by 52-74%, 43-69% and 36-79% in individual as well as 
combined treatments of IAA and NPs. Photosynthetic pigments were amplified by 
35-63%, total osmolytes were augmented by 39-68% and antioxidant enzymes 
including SOD and POD were boosted by 42-57% and 37-62% respectively, in 
combined as well as individual application. Conclusively, Cit-AgNPs are 
considered as salt mitigating entities that enhance the tolerance level of crop 
plants along with IAA, which may be beneficial for the plants growing in saline 
stressed environment.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The use of recombinant human bone morphogenetic proteins-2 
(rhBMP-2) for spinal fusion has been reported to be effective. However, most 
studies have focused on posterolateral and anterior lumbar interbody fusion, and 
few have investigated posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF).
PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of the 
delivery of Escherichia coli-derived rhBMP-2 (E.BMP-2) with hydroxyapatite (HA) 
and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) poloxamer hydrogel composite carriers for 
PLIF.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients who underwent 1 to 3 levels of PLIF for lumbar 
degenerative disc disorders between 2015 and 2020 with a follow-up of ≥1 year 
were enrolled. In total, 254 patients (357 levels) were included in the
