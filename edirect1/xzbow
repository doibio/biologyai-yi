Fragaria chiloensis fruit has a short postharvest life mainly due to its rapid 
softening. In order to improve its postharvest life, preharvest applications of 
methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and chitosan were evaluated during postharvest storage 
at room temperature. The quality and chemical parameters, and protection against 
decay were evaluated at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h of storage from fruits of two 
subsequent picks (termed as first harvest and second harvest). In general, 
fruits treated with MeJA and chitosan maintained higher levels of fruit 
firmness, anthocyanin, and showed significant delays in decay incidence compared 
to control fruit. MeJA-treated fruits exhibited a greater lignin content and 
SSC/TA ratio, and delayed decay incidences. Instead, chitosan-treated fruits 
presented higher antioxidant capacity and total phenol content. In short, both 
the elicitors were able to increase the shelf life of fruits as evidenced by the 
increased levels of lignin and anthocyanin, especially of the second harvest.

BACKGROUND: Several studies in the new field of cognitive epidemiology have 
shown that higher intelligence predicts longer lifespan. This positive 
correlation might arise from socioeconomic status influencing both intelligence 
and health; intelligence leading to better health behaviours; and/or some shared 
genetic factors influencing both intelligence and health. Distinguishing among 
these hypotheses is crucial for medicine and public health, but can only be 
accomplished by studying a genetically informative sample.
METHODS: We analysed data from three genetically informative samples containing 
information on intelligence and mortality: Sample 1, 377 pairs of male veterans 
from the NAS-NRC US World War II Twin Registry; Sample 2, 246 pairs of twins 
from the Swedish Twin Registry; and Sample 3, 784 pairs of twins from the Danish 
Twin Registry. The age at which intelligence was measured differed between the 
samples. We used three methods of genetic analysis to examine the relationship 
between intelligence and lifespan: we calculated the proportion of the more 
intelligent twins who outlived their co-twin; we regressed within-twin-pair 
lifespan differences on within-twin-pair intelligence differences; and we used 
the resulting regression coefficients to model the additive genetic covariance. 
We conducted a meta-analysis of the regression coefficients across the three 
samples.
RESULTS: The combined (and all three individual samples) showed a small positive 
phenotypic correlation between intelligence and lifespan. In the combined sample 
observed r = .12 (95% confidence interval .06 to .18). The additive genetic 
covariance model supported a genetic relationship between intelligence and 
lifespan. In the combined sample the genetic contribution to the covariance was 
95%; in the US study, 84%; in the Swedish study, 86%, and in the Danish study, 
85%.
CONCLUSIONS: The finding of common genetic effects between lifespan and 
intelligence has important implications for public health, and for those 
interested in the genetics of intelligence, lifespan or inequalities in health 
outcomes including lifespan.

Disparities in Disability Life Expectancy in US Birth Cohorts: The Influence of 
Sex and Race.

Soneji S(1).

Racial and sex disparities in chronic diseases and mortality are sources of 
health inequality and have been observed from infancy to adulthood. Disparities 
in health and mortality contribute to corresponding disparities in healthy life. 
I address two previously unanswered questions in the aging literature. First, 
does the racial and sex gap in healthy life narrow, persist, or expand over age 
and time, particularly considering severity of ill health, among the oldest old? 
Second, do some race-sex groups of birth cohorts live not just longer lives, but 
longer healthier lives, while others spend additional years in illness? To 
estimate the quantities, I employ a refined definition of physical disability 
and apply a new extension of Sullivan's method to true birth cohorts. The 
results suggest among the oldest old, few racial or sex disparities exist over 
age and time in mild disability. Yet, racial and sex disparities persist over 
age and time in severe disability.

OBJECTIVES: The constructs optimism, pessimism, hope, treatment credibility and 
treatment expectancy are associated with outcomes of medical treatment. While 
these constructs are grounded in different theoretical models, they nonetheless 
show some conceptual overlap. The purpose of this study was to examine whether 
currently available measurement instruments for these constructs capture the 
conceptual differences between these constructs within a treatment setting.
METHODS: Patients undergoing Total Hip and Total Knee Arthroplasty (THA and TKA) 
(Total N = 361; 182 THA; 179 TKA), completed the Life Orientation Test-Revised 
for optimism and pessimism, the Hope Scale, the Credibility Expectancy 
Questionnaire for treatment credibility and treatment expectancy. Confirmatory 
factor analysis was used to examine whether the instruments measure distinct 
constructs. Four theory-driven models with one, two, four and five latent 
factors were evaluated using multiple fit indices and Δχ2 tests, followed by 
some posthoc models.
RESULTS: The results of the theory driven confirmatory factor analysis showed 
that a five factor model in which all constructs loaded on separate factors 
yielded the most optimal and satisfactory fit. Posthoc, a bifactor model in 
which (besides the 5 separate factors) a general factor is hypothesized 
accounting for the commonality of the items showed a significantly better fit 
than the five factor model. All specific factors, except for the hope factor, 
showed to explain a substantial amount of variance beyond the general factor.
CONCLUSION: Based on our primary analyses we conclude that optimism, pessimism, 
hope, treatment credibility and treatment expectancy are distinguishable in THA 
and TKA patients. Postdoc, we determined that all constructs, except hope, 
showed substantial specific variance, while also sharing some general variance.

Understanding genetic diversity, population structure, and linkage 
disequilibrium is a prerequisite for the association mapping of complex traits 
in a target population. In this study, the genetic diversity and population 
structure of 40 waxy and 40 normal inbred maize lines were investigated using 10 
morphological traits and 200 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Based on a 
population structure analysis, the 80 maize inbred lines were divided into three 
groups: I, II, and admixed. Significant marker-trait associations were 
identified between the markers and the 10 morphological traits, which were 
studied according to the model used to confirm the association. Using a general 
linear model, the lowest R(2) value (9.03) was detected in umc1139, which was 
associated with ear number, and the highest (43.97) was in umc1858, which was 
associated with plant height. Using a mixed linear model, the lowest R(2) value 
(18.74) was in umc1279, which was associated with ear weight; the highest 
(27.66) was in umc1858, which was associated with 100-kernel weight. The SSR 
markers identified in the present study may serve as useful molecular markers 
for selecting important yield and agronomic traits. These results will be useful 
for marker-assisted selection in maize breeding programs, to help breeders 
choose parental lines and markers for crosses.

BACKGROUND: Long-term prognosis in terms of quality of life (QoL) in young 
stroke patients is of importance because they usually have a long life 
expectancy and extensive daily life demands. We aimed at determining which 
medical and psychological factors influence the QoL in young stroke patients 
(<50 years), after long-term follow-up.
METHODS: Young ischemic stroke patients admitted to the St. Elisabeth Hospital 
and the TweeSteden Hospital, Tilburg, the Netherlands, between 2000 and 2010 
were included. One hundred seventy patients and 61 controls filled out the 
following questionnaires: (1) the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, (2) the 
Fatigue Assessment Scale, and (3) the shortened World Health Organization 
Quality of Life scale. Using linear multiple regression analysis, we assessed 
the factors influencing QoL.
RESULTS: QoL did not differ significantly between patients (median modified 
Rankin Scale score at follow-up, 0) and controls after a mean follow-up of 4.5 
(standard deviation, 2.8) years. The presence of excessive fatigue was 
associated with lower scores on all domains of the QoL (P ≤ .003), but not for 
general health domain (P = .010). Similarly, depression was associated with 
worse QoL on the physical (P = .004) and psychological (P = .001) domains and 
anxiety with lower scores on the psychological (P < .001) QoL domain. No 
relationship was found between stroke-specific factors and QoL.
CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue and to a lesser extent depression and anxiety affect the 
QoL in young adults after ischemic stroke of mild severity. Therefore, young 
stroke patients should be informed about, screened, and, if possible, treated 
for fatigue, depression, and anxiety.

The generation of complex three-dimensional bioengineered scaffolds that are 
capable of mimicking the molecular and topographical cues of the extracellular 
matrix found in native tissues is a field of expanding research. The systematic 
development of such scaffolds requires the characterisation of cell behaviour in 
response to the individual components of the scaffold. In the present 
investigation, we studied cell-substrate interactions between purified 
populations of Schwann cells and three-dimensional fibrin hydrogel scaffolds, in 
the presence or absence of multiple layers of highly orientated electrospun 
polycaprolactone nanofibres. Embedded Schwann cells remained viable within the 
fibrin hydrogel for up to 7 days (the longest time studied); however, cell 
behaviour in the hydrogel was somewhat different to that observed on the 
two-dimensional fibrin substrate: Schwann cells failed to proliferate in the 
fibrin hydrogel, whereas cell numbers increased steadily on the two-dimensional 
fibrin substrate. Schwann cells within the fibrin hydrogel developed complex 
process branching patterns, but, when presented with orientated nanofibres, 
showed a strong tendency to redistribute themselves onto the nanofibres, where 
they extended long processes that followed the longitudinal orientation of the 
nanofibres. The process length along nanofibre-containing fibrin hydrogel 
reached near-maximal levels (for the present experimental conditions) as early 
as 1 day after culturing. The ability of this three-dimensional, extracellular 
matrix-mimicking scaffold to support Schwann cell survival and provide 
topographical cues for rapid process extension suggest that it may be an 
appropriate device design for the bridging of experimental lesions of the 
peripheral nervous system.

INTRODUCTION: Road traffic crashes constitute a considerable public health 
burden and represent the eighth leading cause of death and tenth leading cause 
of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) globally. However, very little is 
known about the extent, causes and impact of crashes in low- and middle-income 
countries including those in the Pacific. This lack of data is particularly true 
for the Solomon Islands.
METHODS: The study is a retrospective record review of a pre-existing, 
de-identified dataset. A standardised trauma form is completed for all patients 
presenting to the orthopaedic department at the National Referral Hospital in 
Honiara with a suspected fracture following a trauma. Data are coded using one 
of 27 unique codes. Data related to road traffic crashes were extracted from the 
larger dataset, cleaned and analysed in Microsoft Excel.
RESULTS: The database contained 699 records coded with one of seven codes 
related to road traffic crashes. Patients in the database were most frequently 
injured whilst a passenger in a car (27.8%), as a pedestrian (24.0%), or as a 
passenger in an open truck (21.6%). Almost three-quarters of patients were male. 
Just under half (48.5%) were aged between 10 and 29 years. Alcohol was listed as 
a contributing factor in 23.8% of presentations.
CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to provide data on road traffic 
crashes in the Solomon Islands. In this database, young males were most likely 
to be involved in a crash that resulted in a suspected fracture. Young males are 
in their prime years of productivity, and injuries that remove them from the 
workforce could have severe socioeconomic implications. This study found that 
more than half of injuries were borne by vulnerable road users such as 
pedestrians and motorcyclists, indicating a need for interventions that take 
these users into account. Finally, the study provides insight into the large 
impact that alcohol has on the risk of road traffic crashes.

BACKGROUND: Computerized provider order entry (CPOE) with clinical decision 
support is a basic criterion for hospitals' meaningful use of electronic health 
record systems. A study was conducted to evaluate from the societal perspective 
the cost-utility of implementing CPOE in acute care hospitals in the United 
States.
METHODS: A decision-analytical model compared CPOE with paper ordering among 
patients admitted to acute care hospitals with >25 beds. Parameters included 
start-up and maintenance costs, as well as costs for provider time use, 
medication and laboratory test ordering, and preventable adverse drug events. 
Probabilistic analyses produced incremental costs, effectiveness, and 
cost-effectiveness ratios for hospitals in four bed-size categories (25-72, 
72-141, 141-267, 267-2,249).
RESULTS: Relative to paper ordering and using typical estimates of 
implementation costs, CPOE had, on average, >99% probability of yielding savings 
to society and improving health. Per hospital in each size category, mean 
life-time savings -in millions-were $11.6 (standard deviation, $9.30), $34.4 
($21.2), $71.8 ($43.8), and $170 ($119) (2012 dollars), respectively, and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were 19.9 (16.9), 53.7 (38.7), 109 
(79.6), and 249 (205). Incremental effectiveness and costs were less favorable 
in certain circumstances, such as high implementation costs. Nationwide, 
anticipated increases in CPOE implementation from 2009 through 2015 could save 
$133 billion and 201,000 QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to improving health, implementing CPOE with clinical 
decision support could yield substantial long-term savings to society in the 
United States, although results for individual hospitals are likely to vary.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin K antagonists are commonly used for the prevention of 
thromboembolic events. Patient self-monitoring of vitamin K antagonists has 
proved superior to usual care. Dabigatran has been shown, relative to warfarin, 
to reduce thromboembolic events without increasing bleeding.
METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to compare vitamin K self-monitoring 
strategies to dabigatran including effectiveness and costs of monitoring and 
complications (thromboembolism and major bleeding). The model was used to 
project the incidence of these complications, life years, quality-adjusted life 
years, and health system costs with anticoagulant treatment throughout life. The 
analysis was conducted from the health system perspective and from the societal 
perspective.
RESULTS: Low quality evidence suggests that self-monitoring is at least as 
effective as dabigatran for the outcomes of thrombosis, bleeding and death. 
Moderate quality evidence that patient self-monitoring is more effective than 
other forms of monitoring degree of anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists, 
reducing the relative risk of thromboembolism by 41% and death by 34%. The cost 
per quality adjusted year gained relative to other warfarin monitoring 
strategies is well below 30,000 € in the short term, and is a dominant 
alternative from the fourth year. In comparison with dabigatran, the lower 
annual cost and its equivalence in terms of effectiveness made self-monitoring 
the dominant option. These results were confirmed in the probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: We have moderate quality evidence that self-monitoring of vitamin K 
antagonists is a cost-effective alternative compared with hospital and primary 
care monitoring, and low quality evidence, compared with dabigatran. Our 
analyses contrast with the available cost analysis of dabigatran and usual care 
of anticoagulated patients.

Phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) by eIF2α 
family kinases is a conserved mechanism to limit protein synthesis under 
specific stress conditions. The baculovirus-encoded protein PK2 inhibits eIF2α 
family kinases in vivo, thereby increasing viral fitness. However, the precise 
mechanism by which PK2 inhibits eIF2α kinase function remains an enigma. Here, 
we probed the mechanism by which PK2 inhibits the model eIF2α kinase human 
RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) as well as native insect eIF2α kinases. 
Although PK2 structurally mimics the C-lobe of a protein kinase domain and 
possesses the required docking infrastructure to bind eIF2α, we show that PK2 
directly binds the kinase domain of PKR (PKR(KD)) but not eIF2α. The PKR(KD)-PK2 
interaction requires a 22-residue N-terminal extension preceding the globular 
PK2 body that we term the "eIF2α kinase C-lobe mimic" (EKCM) domain. The 
functional insufficiency of the N-terminal extension of PK2 implicates a role 
for the adjacent EKCM domain in binding and inhibiting PKR. Using a genetic 
screen in yeast, we isolated PK2-activating mutations that cluster to a surface 
of the EKCM domain that in bona fide protein kinases forms the catalytic cleft 
through sandwiching interactions with a kinase N-lobe. Interaction assays 
revealed that PK2 associates with the N- but not the C-lobe of PKR(KD). We 
propose an inhibitory model whereby PK2 engages the N-lobe of an eIF2α kinase 
domain to create a nonfunctional pseudokinase domain complex, possibly through a 
lobe-swapping mechanism. Finally, we show that PK2 enhances baculovirus fitness 
in insect hosts by targeting the endogenous insect heme-regulated inhibitor 
(HRI)-like eIF2α kinase.

INTRODUCTION: The safety, efficacy and prolonged half-life of recombinant factor 
VIII Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) in previously treated patients with severe 
haemophilia A was demonstrated in the phase 3 A-LONG and Kids A-LONG studies. 
Here, we report interim safety and efficacy data from the rFVIIIFc extension 
study, ASPIRE (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT01454739).
METHODS: Eligible subjects could enrol in ASPIRE upon completing A-LONG or Kids 
A-LONG. There were four treatment groups: individualized prophylaxis; weekly 
prophylaxis; modified prophylaxis (for subjects in whom optimal treatment could 
not be achieved with individualized or weekly prophylaxis); and episodic 
treatment. The primary endpoint was development of inhibitors.
RESULTS: A total of 150 A-LONG subjects and 61 Kids A-LONG subjects enrolled in 
ASPIRE. As of the interim data cut (6 January 2014), the median time on study 
was 80.9 (A-LONG) and 23.9 (Kids A-LONG) weeks. The majority of subjects 
(A-LONG, 92.0%; Kids A-LONG, 57.4%) had ≥100 cumulative rFVIIIFc exposure days. 
No inhibitors were observed. Adverse events were generally consistent with those 
expected in the general haemophilia A population. Median annualized bleeding 
rates (ABRs) were low with individualized [A-LONG: 0.66; Kids A-LONG: 0.00 (<6 
years old), 1.54 (6 to <12 years old)], weekly (A-LONG: 2.03) and modified 
(A-LONG: 1.97) prophylaxis. There was no change in prophylactic infusion 
frequency or total weekly prophylactic dose in the majority of subjects from 
A-LONG and Kids A-LONG.
CONCLUSION: Interim data from ASPIRE confirm the long-term safety of rFVIIIFc 
and the maintenance of a low ABR with extended-interval prophylactic dosing in 
patients with severe haemophilia A.

BACKGROUND: Countries are increasingly considering how to reduce or even end 
tobacco consumption, and raising tobacco taxes is a potential strategy to 
achieve these goals. We estimated the impacts on health, health inequalities, 
and health system costs of ongoing tobacco tax increases (10% annually from 2011 
to 2031, compared to no tax increases from 2011 ["business as usual," BAU]), in 
a country (New Zealand) with large ethnic inequalities in smoking-related and 
noncommunicable disease (NCD) burden.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We modeled 16 tobacco-related diseases in parallel, using 
rich national data by sex, age, and ethnicity, to estimate undiscounted 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and net health system costs over the 
remaining life of the 2011 population (n = 4.4 million). A total of 260,000 (95% 
uncertainty interval [UI]: 155,000-419,000) QALYs were gained among the 2011 
cohort exposed to annual tobacco tax increases, compared to BAU, and cost 
savings were US$2,550 million (95% UI: US$1,480 to US$4,000). QALY gains and 
cost savings took 50 y to peak, owing to such factors as the price sensitivity 
of youth and young adult smokers. The QALY gains per capita were 3.7 times 
greater for Māori (indigenous population) compared to non-Māori because of 
higher background smoking prevalence and price sensitivity in Māori. Health 
inequalities measured by differences in 45+ y-old standardized mortality rates 
between Māori and non-Māori were projected to be 2.31% (95% UI: 1.49% to 3.41%) 
less in 2041 with ongoing tax rises, compared to BAU. Percentage reductions in 
inequalities in 2041 were maximal for 45-64-y-old women (3.01%). As with all 
such modeling, there were limitations pertaining to the model structure and 
input parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing tobacco tax increases deliver sizeable health gains and 
health sector cost savings and are likely to reduce health inequalities. 
However, if policy makers are to achieve more rapid reductions in the NCD burden 
and health inequalities, they will also need to complement tobacco tax increases 
with additional tobacco control interventions focused on cessation.

In cost-effectiveness analyses of drugs or health technologies, estimates of 
life years saved or quality-adjusted life years saved are required. Randomised 
controlled trials can provide an estimate of the average treatment effect; for 
survival data, the treatment effect is the difference in mean survival. However, 
typically not all patients will have reached the endpoint of interest at the 
close-out of a trial, making it difficult to estimate the difference in mean 
survival. In this situation, it is common to report the more readily estimable 
difference in median survival. Alternative approaches to estimating the mean 
have also been proposed. We conducted a simulation study to investigate the bias 
and precision of the three most commonly used sample measures of absolute 
survival gain--difference in median, restricted mean and extended mean 
survival--when used as estimates of the true mean difference, under different 
censoring proportions, while assuming a range of survival patterns, represented 
by Weibull survival distributions with constant, increasing and decreasing 
hazards. Our study showed that the three commonly used methods tended to 
underestimate the true treatment effect; consequently, the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) would be overestimated. Of the three methods, 
the least biased is the extended mean survival, which perhaps should be used as 
the point estimate of the treatment effect to be inputted into the ICER, while 
the other two approaches could be used in sensitivity analyses. More work on the 
trade-offs between simple extrapolation using the exponential distribution and 
more complicated extrapolation using other methods would be valuable.

Tehranchi A, Behnia H, Ghochani MS, Younessian F.

Despite the fact that recent medical advances have improved the quality of life 
and increased the life expectancy of patients suffering from thalassaemia, no 
standard strategy or clinical guidelines are available for the correction of the 
presenting craniofacial anomalies. The aim of the present study is to review the 
craniofacial features of affected patients, and to discuss the orthodontic and 
orthognathic surgical treatment options available to manage the associated and 
characteristic facial deformity.

[A history of men's health--on the origin of a field of research].

[Article in German]

Dinges M.

This contribution traces the conditions surrounding the emergence and 
development of a new field of research since the millennium. It primarily 
presents research initiated by the Stuttgart Institute for the History of 
Medicine: starting with the (re)discovery of sources and the setting up of 
bodies of sources for a gender-sensitive, patient-oriented history of health 
(autobiographies, diaries, correspondence) it moves to issues such as health 
lifestyles, workers' masculinity, the use of medical services, health 
experiences during particular stages of life such as childhood or youth, as well 
as prevention, healthcare, mental health and the gender gap in life expectancy. 
In conclusion the article discusses possible theoretical frameworks and 
perspectives.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analyses provide insight in the use of lifestyle 
interventions. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention 
compared to usual care in people with Familial Hypercholesterolemia, 340 people 
with FH were randomized to the intervention or control group. LDL cholesterol, 
quality of life and costs were measured at 0 and 12 months. Cost-effectiveness 
analyses were performed from a healthcare perspective using bootstrapping 
techniques.
RESULTS: Non-significant decreases in LDL cholesterol and quality of life were 
found. The mean between-group difference in costs was €-237 (95% CI -1,386 to 
130). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 1,729 per 1 mmol/l LDL 
cholesterol and 145,899 per QALY gained. Assumed that the small non-significant 
decrease in LDL cholesterol is attributed to the intervention, the probability 
of cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared to usual care was 91% per 1 
mmol/l LDL cholesterol reduction and 75% per QALY gained at a ceiling ratio of 
€20,000.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention is not cost-effective.

FoxO transcription factors promote longevity across taxa. How they do so is 
poorly understood. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the A- and F-isoforms 
of the FoxO transcription factor DAF-16 extend life span in the context of 
reduced DAF-2 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) signaling. To elucidate 
the mechanistic basis for DAF-16/FoxO-dependent life span extension, we 
performed an integrative analysis of isoform-specific daf-16/FoxO mutants. In 
contrast to previous studies suggesting that DAF-16F plays a more prominent role 
in life span control than DAF-16A, isoform-specific daf-16/FoxO mutant 
phenotypes and whole transcriptome profiling revealed a predominant role for 
DAF-16A over DAF-16F in life span control, stress resistance, and target gene 
regulation. Integration of these datasets enabled the prioritization of a subset 
of 92 DAF-16/FoxO target genes for functional interrogation. Among 29 genes 
tested, two DAF-16A-specific target genes significantly influenced longevity. A 
loss-of-function mutation in the conserved gene gst-20, which is induced by 
DAF-16A, reduced life span extension in the context of daf-2/IGFR RNAi without 
influencing longevity in animals subjected to control RNAi. Therefore, gst-20 
promotes DAF-16/FoxO-dependent longevity. Conversely, a loss-of-function 
mutation in srr-4, a gene encoding a seven-transmembrane-domain receptor family 
member that is repressed by DAF-16A, extended life span in control animals, 
indicating that DAF-16/FoxO may extend life span at least in part by reducing 
srr-4 expression. Our discovery of new longevity genes underscores the efficacy 
of our integrative strategy while providing a general framework for identifying 
specific downstream gene regulatory events that contribute substantially to 
transcription factor functions. As FoxO transcription factors have conserved 
functions in promoting longevity and may be dysregulated in aging-related 
diseases, these findings promise to illuminate fundamental principles underlying 
aging in animals.

The management of small renal masses: what is likely to change?

Pisa, Pisa - Italy.

The diffusion of imaging has determined an increased discovery of small renal 
masses (SRMs). Recent publications have been reviewed to present the state of 
the art in the management of SRMs and to try to foresee the next steps in this 
challenging condition. The role of percutaneous biopsies is expanding, since 
management algorithms include also active surveillance and ablative therapies. 
However up to 30% of biopsies fail to provide histological diagnosis and there 
is the risk of under-evaluating high-grade tumors. Active surveillance has been 
proposed in patients with reduced life expectancy and numerous comorbidities. 
The average growth of SRMs is slow, and metastatic progression has been observed 
in about 1%. Ablative therapies (cryotherapy and radiofrequency ablation) are 
used in patients with relevant comorbidities or advanced age and unfit for 
surgery, but who desire active treatment. Compared to conservative surgical 
treatment both techniques have increased local progression rates, while 
metastatic progression is relatively low.Partial nephrectomy (PN) is the 
recommended curative treatment for SRMs and can be performed open, 
laparoscopically or robotically. Open PN represents the benchmark, with similar 
cancer specific survival and better preservation of renal function compared to 
nephrectomy. Laparoscopy is comparable to open surgery in terms of oncologic 
results, but a long learning curve is necessary. Perioperative outcomes of 
robot-assisted PN appear superior to laparoscopy and the learning curve is 
shorter, but data for oncological results are still immature. With the 
increasing diffusion of robotic technology it is likely more SRMs will be 
managed with this approach.

PURPOSE: In reports of end-of-life communication interventions, it is difficult 
to find sufficient detail about the intervention to allow replication, 
extension, and translation into practice. The purpose of this article is to 
provide details about a theory-guided advance care planning intervention, 
sharing the patient's illness representations to increase trust (SPIRIT), an 
intervention that has been shown to be efficacious for patients and their 
surrogates with respect to preparation for end-of-life decision making.
METHODS AND DESIGN: The description of SPIRIT is based on an intervention 
description checklist by Conn (2012), the Intervention Taxonomy from Schulz, 
Czaja, McKay, Ory, and Belle (2010) and on relevant segments of Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials.
DISCUSSION: The SPIRIT intervention was developed based on sound theoretical 
underpinnings and pilot tested with target patient populations and racial or 
ethnic groups. We describe details about the intervention's theoretical basis, 
requisite intervener training, implementation of each intervention component, 
and fidelity monitoring.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The details about the components of a theory-guided advance 
care planning intervention may facilitate translation of the intervention to 
practice settings.
