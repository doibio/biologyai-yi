The need to accelerate large-scale protein-ligand docking in virtual screening 
against a huge compound database led researchers to propose a strategy that 
entails memorizing the evaluation result of the partial structure of a compound 
and reusing it to evaluate other compounds. However, the previous method 
required frequent disk accesses, resulting in insufficient acceleration. Thus, 
more efficient memory usage can be expected to lead to further acceleration, and 
optimal memory usage could be achieved by solving the minimum cost flow problem. 
In this research, we propose a fast algorithm for the minimum cost flow problem 
utilizing the characteristics of the graph generated for this problem as 
constraints. The proposed algorithm, which optimized memory usage, was 
approximately seven times faster compared to existing minimum cost flow 
algorithms.

INTRODUCTION: Total knee replacement is a common surgical procedure in the 
elderly. The number of surgeries has increased owing to the increasing life 
expectancy of the population and better functional outcomes postsurgery. 
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is an identified entity postsurgery 
in elderly but most of the studies have been on patients undergoing cardiac and 
other nonorthopaedic surgeries. The studies have shown variable incidence due to 
selection bias. We studied the incidence and probable predictive factors of POCD 
in elderly Indian population undergoing total knee replacement under spinal 
anesthesia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a prospective, observational study at a 
single center including patients above 60 years of age undergoing total knee 
replacement under spinal anesthesia. Preoperative mini-mental scale examination, 
electrolytes, urea and creatinine levels were recorded. Postoperatively, mini 
mental scale evaluation (MMSE) was done 2 days postsurgery, at 3 months, 6 
months, and 1 year follow-up. Laboratory values postoperatively were recorded.
RESULTS: The average preoperative MMSE was 27 and declined to 25.4 on second 
postoperative day the value increased to 25.9, 26.6, and 27 at 3 months, 6 
months, and 1-year follow-up, respectively. Sixty-three out of 600 patients 
developed POCD at second postoperative day. Forty-three patients showed recovery 
in subsequent visits and 20 patients had persistent dysfunction at the end of 1 
year. Electrolyte imbalance, oxygen saturation, and age over 80 years were 
factors that showed statistically significant difference in multiple comparison 
analysis.
CONCLUSION: In our study, we have found POCD to be a definitive entity which can 
cause short- and long-term cognitive defect in elderly Indian population 
undergoing total knee replacement and electrolyte imbalance, age, and oxygen 
saturation were the significant factors in the patients who developed POCD.

Megaprosthesis versus Allograft Prosthesis Composite for massive skeletal 
defects.

Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, 110029, India.

Massive skeletal defects are encountered in the setting of tumors necessitating 
excision, failed total hip arthroplasty with periprosthetic bone loss, 
periprosthetic fracture, complex trauma, multiple failed osteosynthesis and 
infection. Reconstruction of the segmental defects poses a tremendous challenge 
to the orthopaedic surgeons. The goal of osseous reconstruction of these defects 
is to restore the bone length and function. Currently the most commonly employed 
methods for reconstruction are either a megaprosthesis or an Allograft 
Prosthesis Composite (APC). Megaprosthesis, initially created for the treatment 
in neoplastic pathologies are being used for the non-neoplastic pathologies as 
well. The longevity of these implants is an issue as majority of the patients 
receiving them are the survivors of oncologic issue or elderly population, both 
in which the life expectancy is limited. However, the early complications like 
instability, infection, prosthetic breakage and fixation failure have been 
extensively reported in several literatures. Moreover, the megaprostheses are 
non-biological options preventing secure fixation of the soft tissue around the 
implant. The Allograft Prosthesis Composites were introduced to overcome the 
complications of megaprosthesis. APC is made of a revision-type prosthesis 
cemented into the skeletal allograft to which the remaining soft tissue sleeve 
can be biologically fixed. APCs are preferred in young and low risk patients. 
Though the incidence of instability is relatively low with the composites as 
compared to the megaprosthesis, apart from infection, the newer complications 
pertaining to APCs are inevitable that includes non-union, allograft resorption, 
periprosthetic fracture and potential risk of disease transmission. The current 
review aims to give an overview on the treatment outcomes, complications and 
survival of both the megaprostheses and APCs at different anatomic sites in both 
the upper and lower limbs.

AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of treatment 
with an osseointegrated percutaneous (OI-) prosthesis and a socket-suspended 
(S-) prosthesis for patients with a transfemoral amputation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the medical costs 
and changes in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) attributable to treatment of 
unilateral transfemoral amputation over a projected period of 20 years from a 
healthcare perspective. Data were collected alongside a prospective clinical 
study of 51 patients followed for two years.
RESULTS: OI-prostheses had an incremental cost per QALY gained of €83 374 
compared with S-prostheses. The clinical improvement seen with OI-prostheses was 
reflected in QALYs gained. Results were most sensitive to the utility value for 
both treatment arms. The impact of an annual decline in utility values of 1%, 
2%, and 3%, for patients with S-prostheses resulted in a cost per QALY gained of 
€37 020, €24 662, and €18 952, respectively, over 20 years.
CONCLUSION: From a healthcare perspective, treatment with an OI-prosthesis 
results in improved quality of life at a relatively high cost compared with that 
for S-prosthesis. When patients treated with S-prostheses had a decline in 
quality of life over time, the cost per QALY gained by OI-prosthesis treatment 
was considerably reduced. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2018;100-B:527-34.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
landmark-based and image-guided intraarticular steroid injections for the 
initial treatment of a population with adhesive capsulitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision analytic model from the health care system 
perspective over a 6-month time frame for 50-year-old patients with clinical 
findings consistent with adhesive capsulitis was used to evaluate the 
incremental cost-effectiveness of three techniques for administering 
intraarticular steroid to the glenohumeral joint: landmark based (also called 
blind), ultrasound guided, and fluoroscopy guided. Input data on cost, 
probability, and utility estimates were obtained through a comprehensive 
literature search and from expert opinion. The primary effectiveness outcome was 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Costs were estimated in 2017 U.S. dollars.
RESULTS: Ultrasound-guided injections were the dominant strategy for the base 
case, because it was the least expensive ($1280) and most effective (0.4096 
QALY) strategy of the three options overall. The model was sensitive to the 
probabilities of getting the steroid into the joint by means of blind, 
ultrasound-guided, and fluoroscopy-guided techniques and to the costs of the 
ultrasound-guided and blind techniques. Two-way sensitivity analyses showed that 
ultrasound-guided injections were favored over blind and fluoroscopy-guided 
injections over a range of reasonable probabilities and costs. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis showed that ultrasound-guided injections were 
cost-effective in 44% of simulations, compared with 34% for blind injections and 
22% for fluoroscopy-guided injections and over a wide range of 
willingness-to-pay thresholds.
CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided injections are the most cost-effective option for 
the initial steroid-based treatment of patients with adhesive capsulitis. Blind 
and fluoroscopy-guided injections can also be cost-effective when performed by a 
clinician likely to accurately administer the medication into the correct 
location.

Setting Dead at Zero: Applying Scale Properties to the QALY Model.

Author information:
(1)Department for Health Evidence, Radboud University Medical Center, Radboud 
Institute for Health Sciences, Nijmegen, Gelderland, the Netherlands.

INTRODUCTION: Scaling severe states can be a difficult task. First, the method 
of measurement affects whether a health state is considered better or worse than 
dead. Second, in discrete choice experiments, different models to anchor health 
states on 0 (dead) and 1 (perfect health) produce varying amounts of health 
states worse than dead.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Within the context of the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
model, this article provides insight into the value assigned to dead and its 
consequences for decision making. Our research questions are 1) what are the 
arguments set forth to assign dead the number 0 on the health-utility scale? And 
2) what are the effects of the position of dead on the health-utility scale on 
decision making?
METHODS: A literature review was conducted to explore the arguments set forth to 
assign dead a value of 0 in the QALY model. In addition, scale properties and 
transformations were considered.
RESULTS: The review uncovered several practical and theoretical considerations 
for setting dead at 0. In the QALY model, indifference between 2 health episodes 
is not preserved under changes of the origin of the duration scale. Ratio scale 
properties are needed for the duration scale to preserve indifferences. In 
combination with preferences and zero conditions for duration and health, it 
follows that dead should have a value of 0.
CONCLUSIONS: The health-utility and duration scales have ratio scale properties, 
and dead should be assigned the number 0. Furthermore, the position of dead 
should be carefully established, because it determines how life-saving and 
life-improving values are weighed in cost-utility analysis.

Colon and rectal cancers (CRC) combined are the third most commonly diagnosed 
cancer in the United States and the second deadliest. Rectal cancer has distinct 
environmental associations and genetic risk factors different from colon 
cancer.  The transformation of the normal rectal epithelium to a dysplastic 
lesion and eventually an invasive carcinoma requires a combination of genetic 
mutations, either somatic (acquired) or germline (inherited), over an 
approximately 10 to 15 year period. Response to pre-operative therapy and 
pathological staging are the most important prognostic indicators of rectal 
cancer. Initial workup starts with a careful history and physical examination, 
including a digital rectal exam. An endoscopic examination with rigid 
sigmoidoscopy is required; this is important to measure the distance from the 
lesion to the anal verge and for tissue biopsy to confirm rectal cancer. Once 
rectal cancer has been established pathologically, an MRI or transrectal 
ultrasound can accurately determine local tumor extension and node status. 
Baseline computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis rules out 
metastatic lesions. An interdisciplinary evaluation by medical oncology, 
radiation oncology, and surgical oncology is important to discuss the best 
combination of perioperative chemo-radiotherapy (in addition to possible 
surgical resection) that could augment the chance of cure, particularly in 
high-risk patients. Oligo-metastatic disease to the liver and lung and 
local-recurrence patients with rectal cancer are still potentially curable with 
multimodality therapies. Palliative systemic therapy is reserved for 
non-surgical candidates to ameliorate symptoms, improve quality of life, and 
prolong life expectancy.

First- and second-line bevacizumab in ovarian cancer: A Belgian cost-utility 
analysis.

Neyt M(1), Vlayen J(1), Devriese S(1), Camberlin C(1).

Author information:
(1)Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre (KCE), Brussels, Belgium.

BACKGROUND: Currently, in Belgium, bevacizumab is reimbursed for ovarian cancer 
patients, based on a contract between the Minister and the manufacturer 
including confidential agreements. This reimbursement will be re-evaluated in 
2018.
OBJECTIVE: To support the reimbursement reassessment by calculating the 
cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab: (1) in addition to first-line chemotherapy; 
(2) in the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer (platinum-sensitive or 
platinum-resistant).
METHODS: A health economic model has been developed for the Belgian situation 
according to the Belgian guidelines for economic evaluations. The lifetime 
Markov model was set up from the perspective of the health care payer 
(government and patient), including direct healthcare related costs. Results are 
expressed as the extra costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Calculations 
were based on results of four international trials. Both probabilistic and 
one-way sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of first-line bevacizumab 
are on average 158 000/QALY (GOG-0218 trial) and 443 000/QALY (ICON7 trial). The 
most favourable scenario is based on the stage IV subgroup of the GOG-0218 trial 
(€52 000/QALY). Since subgroup findings are often exploratory and require 
confirmatory studies, results of the economic evaluation based on this subgroup 
analysis should be considered with caution. For second-line bevacizumab, ICERs 
are on average €587 000/QALY (OCEANS trial) and €172 000/QALY (AURELIA trial). 
Sensitivity analysis shows that results are most sensitive to the price of 
bevacizumab.
CONCLUSION: From a health economic perspective, ICERs of bevacizumab are 
relatively high. The most favourable results are found for first-line treatment 
of stage IV ovarian cancer patients. Price reductions have a major impact on the 
estimated ICERs. It is recommended to take these findings into account when 
re-evaluating the reimbursement of bevacizumab in ovarian cancer.

BACKGROUND: Women with a history of hypertensive disease of pregnancy have 
increased risks for early mortality from multiple causes. The effect of 
recurrent hypertensive disease of pregnancy on mortality risk and life 
expectancy is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether recurrent hypertensive disease of 
pregnancy is associated with increased mortality risks.
STUDY DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study, we used birth certificate data 
to determine the number of pregnancies affected by hypertensive disease of 
pregnancy for each woman delivering in Utah from 1939 through 2012. We assigned 
women to 1 of 3 groups based on number of affected pregnancies: 0, 1, or ≥2. 
Exposed women had ≥1 affected singleton pregnancy and lived in Utah for ≥1 year 
postpartum. Exposed women were matched 1:2 to unexposed women by age, year of 
childbirth, and parity. Underlying cause of death was determined from death 
certificates. Mortality risks by underlying cause of death were compared between 
exposed and unexposed women as a function of number of affected pregnancies. Cox 
regressions controlled for infant sex, gestational age, parental education, 
ethnicity, and marital status.
RESULTS: We identified 57,384 women with ≥1 affected pregnancy (49,598 women 
with 1 affected pregnancy and 7786 women with ≥2 affected pregnancies). These 
women were matched to 114,768 unexposed women. As of 2016, 11,894 women were 
deceased: 4722 (8.2%) exposed and 7172 (6.3%) unexposed. Women with ≥2 affected 
pregnancies had increased mortality from all causes (adjusted hazard ratio, 
2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.76-2.36), diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio, 
4.33; 95% confidence interval, 2.21-8.47), ischemic heart disease (adjusted 
hazard ratio, 3.30; 95% confidence interval, 2.02-5.40), and stroke (adjusted 
hazard ratio, 5.10; 95% confidence interval, 2.62-9.92). For women whose index 
pregnancy delivered from 1939 through 1959 (n = 10,488), those with ≥2 affected 
pregnancies had shorter additional life expectancies than mothers who had only 1 
or 0 hypertensive pregnancies (48.92 vs 51.91 vs 55.48 years, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Hypertensive diseases of pregnancy are associated with excess risks 
for early all-cause mortality and some cause-specific mortality, and these risks 
increase further with recurrent disease.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) have the 
potential to accelerate the impact of prostate cancer screening recommendations.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using Medicare data 
evaluating the rates of PSA testing and prostate biopsy among men without 
prostate cancer between 2011 and 2014. We assessed PSA testing and biopsy rates 
before and after policy implementation among patients of ACO and non-ACO-aligned 
physicians. To control for secular trends, difference-in-differences methods 
were used to determine the effects of ACO implementation.
RESULTS: We identified 1.1 million eligible men without prostate cancer. From 
2011 to 2014, the rates of PSA testing and biopsy declined by 22.3% and 7.0%, 
respectively. PSA testing declined similarly regardless of ACO 
participation-from 618 to 530 tests per 1000 beneficiaries among ACO-aligned 
physicians and from 607 to 516 tests per 1000 beneficiaries among 
non-ACO-aligned physicians (difference-in-differences P = .11). Whereas rates of 
prostate biopsy remained constant for patients of non-ACO-aligned physicians at 
12 biopsies per 1000 beneficiaries, these rates increased from 11.6 to 12.5 
biopsies per 1000 beneficiaries of patients of ACO-aligned physicians 
(difference-in-differences P = .03).
CONCLUSION: PSA testing and prostate biopsy rates decreased significantly 
between 2011 and 2014. The rate of PSA testing was not differentially affected 
by ACO participation. Conversely, there was an increase in the rate of prostate 
biopsy among patients of ACO-aligned physicians. ACOs did not accelerate 
deimplementation of PSA testing for eligible Medicare beneficiaries without 
prostate cancer.

Background: Stroke is often a severe and debilitating event that requires 
ongoing rehabilitation. The Community Stroke Rehabilitation Teams (CSRTs) offer 
home-based stroke rehabilitation to individuals for whom further therapy is 
unavailable or inaccessible. The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of the CSRT programme compared with a "Usual Care" cohort. 
Methods: We collected data on CSRT clients from January 2012 to February 2013. 
Comparator data were derived from a study of stroke survivors with limited 
access to specialised stroke rehabilitation. Literature-derived values were used 
to inform a long-term projection. Using Markov modelling, we projected the model 
for 35 years in six-month cycles. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were performed. Results were discounted at 3% per year. 
Results: Results demonstrated that the CSRT programme has a net monetary benefit 
(NMB) of $43,655 over Usual Care, and is both less costly and more effective 
(incremental cost = -$17,255; incremental effect = 1.65 Quality Adjusted Life 
Years [QALYs]). Results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that 
incremental cost-effectiveness of the CSRT programme is superior in 100% of 
iterations when compared to Usual Care. Conclusions: The study shows that CSRT 
model of care is cost-effective, and should be considered when evaluating 
potential stroke rehabilitation delivery methods. Implications for 
Rehabilitation Ongoing rehabilitation following stroke is imperative for optimal 
recovery. Home-based specialised stroke rehabilitation may be an option for 
individuals for whom ongoing rehabilitation is unavailable or inaccessible. The 
results of this study demonstrated that home-based rehabilitation is a 
cost-effective means of providing ongoing rehabilitation to individuals who have 
experienced a stroke.

Animal-microbe mutualisms are typically maintained by vertical symbiont 
transmission or partner choice. A third mechanism, screening of high-quality 
symbionts, has been predicted in theory, but empirical examples are rare. Here 
we demonstrate that ambrosia beetles rely on ethanol within host trees for 
promoting gardens of their fungal symbiont and producing offspring. Ethanol has 
long been known as the main attractant for many of these fungus-farming beetles 
as they select host trees in which they excavate tunnels and cultivate fungal 
gardens. More than 300 attacks by Xylosandrus germanus and other species were 
triggered by baiting trees with ethanol lures, but none of the foundresses 
established fungal gardens or produced broods unless tree tissues contained in 
vivo ethanol resulting from irrigation with ethanol solutions. More X. germanus 
brood were also produced in a rearing substrate containing ethanol. These 
benefits are a result of increased food supply via the positive effects of 
ethanol on food-fungus biomass. Selected Ambrosiella and Raffaelea fungal 
isolates from ethanol-responsive ambrosia beetles profited directly and 
indirectly by (i) a higher biomass on medium containing ethanol, (ii) strong 
alcohol dehydrogenase enzymatic activity, and (iii) a competitive advantage over 
weedy fungal garden competitors (Aspergillus, Penicillium) that are inhibited by 
ethanol. As ambrosia fungi both detoxify and produce ethanol, they may maintain 
the selectivity of their alcohol-rich habitat for their own purpose and that of 
other ethanol-resistant/producing microbes. This resembles biological screening 
of beneficial symbionts and a potentially widespread, unstudied benefit of 
alcohol-producing symbionts (e.g., yeasts) in other microbial symbioses.

PURPOSE: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common condition that significantly 
affects quality of life and interpersonal relationships.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to 
evaluate the efficacy of herbal dietary supplements in the treatment of ED.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched five databases to identify randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the clinical efficacy of herbal 
medicines in ED. Quality was assessed and risk of bias was estimated using the 
Jadad score and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.
RESULTS: In total, 24 RCTs, including 2080 patients with ED, were identified. 
Among these, 12 evaluated monopreparations (five ginseng [n = 399], three 
saffron [n = 397], two Tribulus terrestris [n = 202], and one each Pinus 
pinaster [n = 21] and Lepidium meyenii [n = 50]), seven evaluated formulations 
(n = 544), and five investigated dietary supplements in combination with pure 
compounds (n = 410). Ginseng significantly improved erectile function 
(International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF]-5 score: 140 ginseng, 96 
placebo; standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.15-0.70; P < 0.01; I2 = 0), P. pinaster and L. meyenii showed very preliminary 
positive results, and saffron and T. terrestris treatment produced mixed 
results. Several herbal formulations were associated with a decrease of IIEF-5 
or IIEF-15, although the results were preliminary. The quality of the included 
studies varied, with only seven having a prevalent low risk of bias. The median 
methodological quality Jadad score was three out of a maximum of five. Adverse 
events were recorded in 19 of 24 trials, with no significant differences between 
placebo and verum in placebo-controlled studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Encouraging evidence suggests that ginseng may be an effective 
herbal treatment for ED. However, further, larger, and high-quality studies are 
required before firm conclusions can be drawn. Promising (although very 
preliminary) results have also been generated for some herbal formulations. 
Overall, more research in the field, adhering to the CONSORT statement extension 
for reporting trials, is justified before the use of herbal products in ED can 
be recommended.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) imposes a heavy disease burden on China due to 
its high morbidity and mortality. China accounts for about 50% of the total new 
cases and deaths worldwide. Most cases are related to hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
infection and are associated with cirrhosis at diagnosis. Antiviral treatment 
with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) after resection in HBV-related HCC can reduce 
recurrence and improve survival. Such treatment is in fact recommended by 
Chinese guidelines. However, cost-effectiveness studies regarding this treatment 
are rare. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 
NA treatment after resection in HBV-related HCC patients with compensated 
cirrhosis. A Markov model was constructed to simulate HBV-related HCC patients 
with compensated cirrhosis and detectable HBV DNA, with or without NA treatment 
after resection, followed up over their lifetime. Costs, life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICER) were calculated for each strategy from the societal perspective. The 
parameters of the model were derived from published studies, government 
documents, and our surveys. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore the impact 
of parameters on the uncertainty of the results. NA treatment produced 4.22 
QALYs, costing $39,898, while non-NA treatment achieved 2.80 QALYs, costing 
$16,048. The ICER of NA treatment versus non-NA treatment was $16,848/QALY, 
which was between 2 and 3 times gross domestic product per capita and was 
therefore deemed cost-effective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed 
that NA treatment was cost-effective, with a probability of 0.852.
CONCLUSION: NA treatment after liver resection was likely cost-effective in 
HBV-related HCC patients with compensated cirrhosis. (Hepatology 2018).

INTRODUCTION: Recent haemophilia treatment advances include new recombinant 
FVIII (rFVIII) products with improved pharmacokinetic (PK) properties that aim 
to reduce the burden of prophylaxis. These treatments are commonly referred to 
as extended half-life rFVIII products (EHL rFVIII). There is no uniform 
definition of what constitutes an EHL rFVIII. Such a definition would help 
physicians, patients and funders understand the properties of standard and EHL 
rFVIIIs and thus provide clarity when selecting an EHL in clinical settings.
AIM: To critically assess the published evidence on new and emerging rFVIII 
products in order to propose a definition to classify EHL rFVIIIs.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and regulatory authorities 
(FDA/EMA/Health Canada) websites for publications and regulatory submissions 
describing prospective crossover PK studies evaluating rFVIIIs that demonstrate 
improved PK parameters in adults and adolescents with severe haemophilia A.
RESULTS: Following critical analyses of the published data, we developed a 
holistic approach to defining rFVIIIs as EHLs, which requires all of the 
following: (i) using technology designed to extend rFVIII half-life; (ii) 
lacking bioequivalence with a standard rFVIII comparator-above the FDA/EMA 
cut-off of 125% for the 90% confidence intervals for area under the curve ratio; 
and (iii) having an extended half-life ratio measured in a PK comparator 
crossover study.
CONCLUSION: In this systematic review, a pragmatic definition of EHL rFVIII has 
been proposed that should provide better clarity in clinical discussions 
surrounding the appropriate use of rFVIII products. At present, only products 
using PEGylation or Fc fusion half-life extension technology meet the proposed 
criteria for definition of EHL rFVIII.

(4)National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

OBJECTIVES: Value assessment frameworks have gained prominence recently in the 
context of U.S. healthcare. Such frameworks set out a series of factors that are 
considered in funding decisions. The UK's National Institute of Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) is an established health technology assessment (HTA) agency. 
We present a novel application of text analysis that characterizes NICE's 
Technology Appraisals in the context of the newer assessment frameworks and 
present the results in a visual way.
METHODS: A total of 243 documents of NICE's medicines guidance from 2007 to 2016 
were analyzed. Text analysis was used to identify a hierarchical set of decision 
factors considered in the assessments. The frequency of decision factors stated 
in the documents was determined and their association with terms related to 
uncertainty. The results were incorporated into visual representations of 
hierarchical factors.
RESULTS: We identified 125 decision factors, and hierarchically grouped these 
into eight domains: Clinical Effectiveness, Cost Effectiveness, Condition, 
Current Practice, Clinical Need, New Treatment, Studies, and Other Factors. 
Textual analysis showed all domains appeared consistently in the guidance 
documents. Many factors were commonly associated with terms relating to 
uncertainty. A series of visual representations was created.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the complexity and consistency of NICE's 
decision-making processes and demonstrates that cost effectiveness is not the 
only decision-criteria. The study highlights the importance of processes and 
methodology that can take both quantitative and qualitative information into 
account. Visualizations can help effectively communicate this complex 
information during the decision-making process and subsequently to stakeholders.

Nanobodies consist of a single domain variable fragment of a camelid heavy-chain 
antibody. Nanobodies have potential applications in biomedical fields because of 
their simple production procedures and low cost. Occasionally, nanobody clones 
of interest exhibit low affinities for their target antigens, which, together 
with their short half-life limit bioanalytical or therapeutic applications. 
Here, we developed a novel platform we named fenobody, in which a nanobody 
developed against H5N1 virus is displayed on the surface of ferritin in the form 
of a 24mer. We constructed a fenobody by substituting the fifth helix of 
ferritin with the nanobody. TEM analysis showed that nanobodies were displayed 
on the surface of ferritin in the form of 6 × 4 bundles, and that these 
clustered nanobodies are flexible for antigen binding in spatial structure. 
Comparing fenobodies with conventional nanobodies currently used revealed that 
the antigen binding apparent affinity of anti-H5N1 fenobody was dramatically 
increased (∼360-fold). Crucially, their half-life extension in a murine model 
was 10-fold longer than anti-H5N1 nanobody. In addition, we found that our 
fenobodies are highly expressed in Escherichia coli, and are both soluble and 
thermo-stable nanocages that self-assemble as 24-polymers. In conclusion, our 
results demonstrate that fenobodies have unique advantages over currently 
available systems for apparent affinity enhancement and half-life extension of 
nanobodies. Our fenobody system presents a suitable platform for various 
large-scale biotechnological processes and should greatly facilitate the 
application of nanobody technology in these areas.

SIGNIFICANCE: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) at the right concentration is associated 
with numerous health benefits in experimental organisms, ranging from protection 
from ischemia/reperfusion injury to life span extension. Given the considerable 
translation potential, two major strategies have emerged: supplementation of 
exogenous H2S and modulation of endogenous H2S metabolism. Recent Advances: 
Recently, it was reported that hepatic H2S production capacity is increased in 
two of the best-characterized mammalian models of life span extension, dietary 
restriction, and hypopituitary dwarfism, leading to new insights into dietary 
and hormonal regulation of endogenous H2S production together with broader 
changes in sulfur amino acid (SAA) metabolism with implications for DNA 
methylation and redox status.
CRITICAL ISSUES: Here, we discuss the role of dietary SAAs and growth hormone 
(GH)/thyroid hormone (TH) signaling in regulation of endogenous H2S production 
largely via repression of H2S generating enzymes cystathionine γ-lyase (CGL) and 
cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) on the level of gene transcription, as well as 
reciprocal regulation of GH and TH signaling by H2S itself. We also discuss 
plasticity of CGL and CBS gene expression in response to environmental stimuli 
and the potential of the microbiome to impact overall H2S levels.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The relative contribution of increased H2S to health span or 
lifespan benefits in models of extended longevity remains to be determined, as 
does the mechanism by which such benefits occur. Nonetheless, our ability to 
control H2S levels using exogenous H2S donors or by modifying the endogenous H2S 
production/consumption equilibrium has the potential to improve health and 
increase "shelf-life" across evolutionary boundaries, including our own.

INTRODUCTION: Muscle force production is usually impaired in people with spinal 
cord injury (SCI). The use of high-intensity neuromuscular electrical 
stimulation (NMES) strength training can help promote metabolically active lean 
muscle mass and, thus, increase muscle mass and improve physical health and 
quality of life (QoL). Nonetheless, NMES is usually used at low-stimulation 
intensities, and there is limited evidence on the effects of high-intensity NMES 
strength training into improving muscle force and mass, symptoms of spasticity, 
or physical health and QoL in people with SCI.
METHODS: Five individuals with chronic SCI completed five 10-repetition sets of 
high-intensity knee extension NMES strength training sessions for 12 wk in both 
quadriceps muscles. Quadriceps femoris (QF) knee extensor torque was measured on 
a dynamometer, and cross-sectional area (CSAQF) was measured with extended 
field-of-view ultrasonography. Venous blood samples were collected for blood 
lipid profiling and C-reactive protein analyses. The Spinal Cord Injury 
Spasticity Evaluation Tool was used to assess symptoms of spasticity, and the 
QoL index SCI version III was used for QoL measures.
RESULTS: QF tetanic knee extensor torque increased on average by 35% (2%-92%), 
and CSAQF increased by 47% (14%-145%). A significant increase in the HDL/LDL 
cholesterol ratio (P < 0.001) and a mean significant improvement of 4.8% ± 2.3% 
(absolute value = 0.26) in the Spinal Cord Injury Spasticity Evaluation Tool 
score was observed, whereas QoL showed a near-significant improvement in the 
health and functioning domain (15.0 ± 4.2 and 17.3 ± 5.1; P = 0.07).
CONCLUSIONS: High-intensity NMES strength training in people with SCI may 
improve muscle strength, mass, physical health, and QoL. However, replication of 
these results is necessary before clinical implementation.
