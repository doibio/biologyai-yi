BACKGROUND: In many high-income countries, life expectancy (LE) has increased, 
with women outliving men. This gender gap in LE (GGLE) has been explained with 
biological factors, healthy behaviours, health status, and sociodemographic 
characteristics, but little attention has been paid to the role of public health 
policies that include/affect these factors. This study aimed to assess the 
contributions of avoidable causes of death, as a measure of public health 
policies and healthcare quality impacts, to the GGLE and its temporal changes in 
the UK. We also estimated the contributions of avoidable causes of death into 
the gap in LE between countries in the UK.
METHODS: We obtained annual data on underlying causes of death by age and sex 
from the World Health Organization mortality database for the periods 2001-2003 
and 2014-2016. We calculated LE at birth using abridged life tables. We applied 
Arriaga's decomposition method to compute the age- and cause-specific 
contributions into the GGLE in each period and its changes between two periods 
as well as the cross-country gap in LE in the 2014-2016 period.
RESULTS: Avoidable causes had greater contributions than non-avoidable causes to 
the GGLE in both periods (62% in 2001-2003 and 54% in 2014-2016) in the UK. 
Among avoidable causes, ischaemic heart disease (IHD) followed by injuries had 
the greatest contributions to the GGLE in both periods. On average, the GGLE 
across the UK narrowed by about 1.0 year between 2001-2003 and 2014-2016 and 
three avoidable causes of IHD, lung cancer, and injuries accounted for about 
0.8 years of this reduction. England & Wales had the greatest LE for both sexes 
in 2014-2016. Among avoidable causes, injuries in men and lung cancer in women 
had the largest contributions to the LE advantage in England & Wales compared to 
Northern Ireland, while drug-related deaths compared to Scotland in both sexes.
CONCLUSION: With avoidable causes, particularly preventable deaths, 
substantially contributing to the gender and cross-country gaps in LE, our 
results suggest the need for behavioural changes by implementing targeted public 
health programmes, particularly targeting younger men from Scotland and Northern 
Ireland.

The main recommendations from public health entities include healthy diets and 
physical activity as the main lifestyle factors impacting the development of 
chronic diseases such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, cancer, and even 
neurological diseases. Randomized clinical trials have been designed to 
demonstrate those lifestyle modifications can change the pattern of chronic 
diseases development and progression. Among these, nutrition is one of the most 
impacting factors. Therefore, nutrition and diets were also included in 
different randomized clinical trials, and most of them showed a favorable impact 
of nutrition modification on the participant's health. Nevertheless, study 
designs were considerably different, and future studies are needed to support 
nutrition modifications further. The choice of a healthy considered diet, like 
the Mediterranean diet, was shown to impact chronic diseases, cardiovascular 
risk, and adult life expectancy mainly due to its anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant properties. Furthermore, a high intake of fibers, fruits, and 
vegetables together with a low intake of fat and energy-dense, processed foods 
contribute to an inflammation reduction and a more robust immune system leading. 
Besides these well-known properties, all lifestyle modifications must be 
personalized according to the availability of foods, geographic localizations, 
and the healthy status of the patient.

Can populations be healthy? Perspectives from Georges Canguilhem and Geoffrey 
Rose.

Canguilhem criticized the concept of "public health": health and disease are 
concepts that only apply to individuals, taken as organic totalities. Their 
extension to a different level of organization is purely metaphorical. The 
importance assumed by epidemiology in the construction of our knowledge of the 
normal and the pathological does, however, call for reflection on the role and 
the status of the population level of organization in our approach to health 
phenomena. The entanglement of the biological and the social in human life and 
in contemporary societies justifies this level of analysis for better 
understanding the complexity and the interaction of health determinants both at 
the level of individuals and their interactions and at that of the population. 
But is this population level just a useful level of analysis that makes it 
possible to bring to light the social determinants of health at the individual 
level, or does it rest instead on characteristics of the population that are 
irreducible to individual characteristics, but which are nevertheless important 
for understanding and taking action with respect to both population and 
individual health? Defending this second alternative, I show how the 
epidemiological point of view, and in particular that of social epidemiology, 
leads us to rethink the possibility of a concept of "population health" that is 
not reducible to the sum of individual instances of health.

AIMS: The present historical case report aims to characterize the long-term 
orofacial repercussions of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a rare 
neurodegenerative disease with poor prognosis and relatively short life 
expectancy following initial diagnosis.
METHODS: Here we focus on the long-term orofacial evolution seen in the example 
of Stephen Hawking, one of the greatest personalities in the scientific world, 
using publicly-available photographic documentation. The fact that Stephen 
Hawking lived several decades following his diagnosis of ALS presents one with a 
unique opportunity to characterize and follow-up the evolution of the ALS on the 
orofacial sphere. Through this article, we want to show him and his family, and 
all those living with this disease, our deepest respect, without intending in 
any way to intrude or misuse the privacy of the late universally-respected 
astrophysicist.
RESULTS: Photographic documentation analyzed longitudinally shows changes 
towards the development of a Class III malocclusion, lower incisor protrusion, 
and a concave profile. Moreover, tooth wear has occurred, accompanied by 
posterior tooth loss and aberrant tongue and lip posture.
CONCLUSION: The causes of such changes remain speculative but could be due to 
changes in the soft tissue equilibrium, changes in head and tongue posture, loss 
of oral function, respiratory needs, and a general deterioration of dental 
health. Our sincere thanks to the Hawking family who took the time to read the 
article and approve its publication for scientific and educational purposes. We 
are also deeply grateful to them for providing us with some photographs from 
their family collection.

OBJECTIVES: The aim was to estimate the trend of incidence, mortality and 
mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) in Central Serbia in 1999-2018 and its 
possible association with the human development index (HDI).
METHODS: In this study, cancer of unknown primary (CUP) was included as C77-C80 
codes. Trend analysis was performed in the Joinpoint Regression Programme 
version 4.8.0.1. HDI combines life expectancy, educational attainment and gross 
national income. HDI values for Serbia are extracted from the global bank site.
RESULTS: Joinpoint regression analysis of the age-standardised incidence rate of 
CUP showed a significantly increasing trend with annual percent change (APC) of 
8.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0-14.3%) in males and 7.8% (95%CI 2.7-13.2) 
in females. The age-standardised mortality rate of CUP showed a significantly 
decreasing trend with APC of -1.7% (95%CI -2.8 to -0.5%) in males and -1.4% 
(95%CI -2.7 to -0.1%) in females. MIR showed a significantly decreasing trend 
with APC of -9.3% (95%CI -14.6 - -3.6%) in males and -7.1% (95%CI -10.5% to 
-4.2%) in females. The linear regression showed significant inverse association 
among HDI and the MIR of CUP in males (r2  = 0.464, p = 0.002) and in females 
(r2  = 0.612, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Decline of MIR was associated with HDI, suggesting that CUP 
prognosis follows socio-economic status.

Aim: To conduct a cost-utility analysis of a novel genetic diagnostic test 
(OUDTEST) for risk of developing opioid use disorder for elective orthopedic 
surgery patients. Materials & Methods: A simulation model assessed 
cost-effectiveness and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for OUDTEST from 
private insurer and self-insured employer perspectives over a 5-year time 
horizon for a hypothetical patient population. Results: OUDTEST was found to 
cost less and increase QALYs, over a 5-year period for private insurance 
(savings US$2510; QALYs 0.02) and self-insured employers (-US$2682; QALYs 0.02). 
OUDTEST was a dominant strategy in 71.1% (private insurance) and 72.7% 
(self-insured employer) of model iterations. Sensitivity analyses revealed 
robust results except for physician compliance. Conclusion: OUDTEST was expected 
to be a cost-effective solution for personalizing postsurgical pain management 
in orthopedic patients.

The study of proteins circulating in blood offers tremendous opportunities to 
diagnose, stratify, or possibly prevent diseases. With recent technological 
advances and the urgent need to understand the effects of COVID-19, the 
proteomic analysis of blood-derived serum and plasma has become even more 
important for studying human biology and pathophysiology. Here we provide views 
and perspectives about technological developments and possible clinical 
applications that use mass-spectrometry(MS)- or affinity-based methods. We 
discuss examples where plasma proteomics contributed valuable insights into 
SARS-CoV-2 infections, aging, and hemostasis and the opportunities offered by 
combining proteomics with genetic data. As a contribution to the Human Proteome 
Organization (HUPO) Human Plasma Proteome Project (HPPP), we present the Human 
Plasma PeptideAtlas build 2021-07 that comprises 4395 canonical and 1482 
additional nonredundant human proteins detected in 240 MS-based experiments. In 
addition, we report the new Human Extracellular Vesicle PeptideAtlas 2021-06, 
which comprises five studies and 2757 canonical proteins detected in 
extracellular vesicles circulating in blood, of which 74% (2047) are in common 
with the plasma PeptideAtlas. Our overview summarizes the recent advances, 
impactful applications, and ongoing challenges for translating plasma proteomics 
into utility for precision medicine.

BACKGROUND: Increase in life-expectancy is not necessarily matched by an 
increase in quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: (1) To explore the quality of life of patients over the age of 85 in 
the second decade following unicompartmental knee replacement surgery (2) To 
understand the usefulness of a priori themes from an evidence synthesis as a 
framework for primary qualitative analysis.
DESIGN: Qualitative Research. A hermeneutic phenomenological approach, using a 
priori themes as sensitising concepts.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults over the age of 85 who were part of an outcomes study in 
the second decade following unicompartmental knee joint replacement.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews in people's homes. Transcripts were coded 
and data sorted using a priori themes as sensitising concepts. Data that did not 
fit these themes, or that added nuance, were analysed thematically through 
constant comparison.
RESULTS: We interviewed seven white women and five white men, aged 85-100. Data 
resonated with a priori themes and supported additional themes that help us to 
understand older peoples' experience: (1) losing our autonomy can be 
challenging, so be kind; (2) we must take care of our own bodies and the NHS; 
(3) I am more afraid of not dying.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that health outcomes for older people should 
incorporate measures of participation and well-being; they highlight the 
importance of kindness in healthcare; they indicate that older people do not 
want to place additional burden on the NHS, and this can act as a barrier to 
care; they support the need for open conversations about dying well.

BACKGROUND: We estimated the global burden of ovarian cancer (OC) in 194 
countries and territories between 2007 and 2017.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD), Injuries, 
and Risk Factors 2017 study.
RESULTS: Globally, 286 126.80 (95% UI = 278 075.38-295 311.41) incident cases, 
4.67 million (4.53-4.83) disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and 175 981.99 
(171 384.15-181 198.43) deaths were reported in 2017. The age-standardized 
incidence and DALY rates increased by 2.05% and 1.34% during 2007-2017, 
respectively, while the age-standardized mortality rate decreased by -0.14%. The 
age-standardized incidence, DALY, and mortality rates in 2017 were the highest 
in the high socio-demographic index (SDI) quintile, but the largest percentage 
increase during 2007-2017 was in the low-SDI quintile. Among regions, Central 
Europe showed the highest 2017 age-standardized incidence, DALY, and mortality 
rates, whereas South Asia and East Asia showed the largest percentage increases 
in both rates during 2007-2017. Among countries, India showed the largest 
percentage increase in age-standardized incidence and DALY rates, whereas Iran 
showed the largest percentage increase in age-standardized mortality rates. 
Globally, the largest percentage increase in risk-attributable DALYs was 
associated with metabolic risk factors (e.g., high fasting plasma glucose 
levels).
CONCLUSION: The global age-standardized incidence, DALYs, and mortality rates of 
OC remain stable during 2007-2017. However, the low SDI quintile and the 
greatest burden in South and East Asia, India, and Iran suggested that more 
targeted strategies should be performed in those regions and countries.

OBJECTIVE: Diabetes increases the risk of premature mortality and considerably 
impacts on work productivity. We sought to examine the impact of diabetes in 
India, in terms of excess premature mortality, years of life lost (YLL), 
productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs) lost, and its associated economic 
impact.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A life table model was constructed to examine the 
productivity of the Indian working-age population currently aged 20-59 years 
with diabetes, followed until death or retirement age (60 years). The same 
cohort was resimulated, hypothetically assuming that they did not have diabetes. 
The total difference between the two cohorts, in terms of excess deaths, YLL and 
PALYs lost reflected the impact of diabetes. Data regarding the prevalence of 
diabetes, mortality, labor force dropouts, and productivity loss attributable to 
diabetes were derived from published sources.
RESULTS: In 2017, an estimated 54.4 million (7.6%) people of working-age in 
India had diabetes. With simulated follow-up until death or retirement age, 
diabetes was predicted to cause 8.5 million excess deaths (62.7% of all deaths), 
42.7 million YLL (7.4% of total estimated years of life lived), and 89.0 million 
PALYs lost (23.3% of total estimated PALYs), equating to an estimated Indian 
rupee 176.6 trillion (U.S. dollars 2.6 trillion; purchasing power parity 9.8 
trillion) in lost gross domestic product.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the impact of diabetes on productivity loss 
and highlights the importance of health strategies aimed at the prevention of 
diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is achronic inflammatory and 
angiogenic condition that is potentially fatal and common among the elderly with 
a probability of gender, racial and ethnic differences. As our population ages 
due to increase in our life expectancy, a closer look at this disease in our 
environment is therefore justified.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective is to evaluate the epidemiology, relationship of 
demography, procedure type and mode of anaesthesia on outcome in the patients.
METHODS: Retrospective analyses of patients with CSDHs treated by single 
burrhole, over a 9-year period was performed. Patients' biodata, type of 
surgery, mode of anaesthesia and discharge outcome were noted. Data were 
analysed with chisquare, independent t test and multivariate binary regression. 
Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistical significance.
RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-four patients were managed during the study 
period. The male-to-female ratio was 2:1 with mean age of 61.4 years. The peak 
age range was in the seventh decade. Recurrence and mortality rates were 2.7% 
and 6.8% respectively. Age was significantly associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: The study showed a male preponderance. Age was significantly 
associated with mortality. Recurrence of CSDH was not related to patients' age, 
gender or mode of anaesthesia.

Publisher: CONTEXTE: L’hématome sous-dural chronique (HSC) est une affection 
chronique inflammatoire et angiogénique potentiellement mortelle et fréquente 
chez les personnes âgées avec une probabilité de différences entre les sexes, 
les races et les ethnies. Comme notre population vieillit en raison de 
l’augmentation de notre espérance de vie, un examen plus approfondi de cette 
maladie dans notre environnement est donc justifié.
OBJECTIFS: Notre objectif est d’évaluer l’épidémiologie, la relation entre la 
démographie, le type de procédure et le mode d’anesthésie sur le résultat chez 
les patients.
MÉTHODES: Nous avons effectué une analyse rétrospective des patients atteints de 
CSDH traités par un seul trou de bavure, sur une période de 9 ans. Les données 
personnelles des patients, le type de chirurgie, le mode d’anesthésie et le 
résultat de la sortie ont été notés. Les données ont été analysées à l’aide du 
test de Chisquare, du test t indépendant et de la régression binaire 
multivariée. Les valeurs de p < 0,05 ont été considérées comme statistiquement 
significatives.
RÉSULTATS: Deux cent soixante-quatre patients ont été pris en charge pendant la 
période d’étude. Le rapport homme/femme était de 2:1 avec un âge moyen de 61,4 
ans. La tranche d’âge maximale se situait dans la septième décennie. Les taux de 
récidive et de mortalité étaient respectivement de 2,7 % et 6,8 %. L’âge était 
significativement associé à la mortalité.
CONCLUSION: L’étude a montré une prépondérance masculine. L’âge était 
significativement associé à la mortalité. La récurrence du CSDH n’était pas liée 
à l’âge, au sexe ou au mode d’anesthésie des patients.
MOTS-CLÉS: Âge, Hématome sous-dural chronique, Anesthésie locale, Trou de bavure

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive chronic condition effecting 
approximately 70 000 to 100 000 people globally and is caused by a 
loss-of-function mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator. Through 
improvements in clinical care, life expectancy in CF has increased considerably 
associated with rising incidence of secondary complications including CF-related 
diabetes (CFRD). CFRD is believed to result from β-cell loss as well as 
insufficient insulin secretion due to β-cell dysfunction, but the underlying 
pathophysiology is not yet fully understood. Here we review the morphological 
and cellular changes in addition to the architectural remodelling of the 
pancreatic exocrine and endocrine compartments in CF and CFRD pancreas. We 
consider also potential underlying proinflammatory signalling pathways impacting 
on endocrine and specifically β-cell function, concluding that further research 
focused on these mechanisms may uncover novel therapeutic targets enabling 
restoration of normal insulin secretion.

Life expectancy at birth (e0) forecasts are used to estimate future pension 
costs. Previous French official forecasts have often overestimated e0. Recent 
forecasts published by demographers provide higher e0 estimates than official 
forecasts for France, Sweden, Japan and the USA, and do not consider that e0 
could decrease, as in previous years because of flus, heatwaves, or other 
outbreaks. Too optimistic forecasts make that governments may overestimate 
future pension needs.

INTRODUCTION: This study sought to explore the pattern of epidemiological 
transition in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
METHODS: We extracted data from the global burden of disease study. Countries 
were grouped using the Sociodemographic Index (SDI). The DisMod-MR 2.1, a 
Bayesian meta-regression tool, was used as the main method of estimating 
variations in epidemiologic data sources and other parameters. Examples of these 
included model predictions, as well as 95% corresponding uncertainty intervals 
for all death, Years of Life Lost, Years Lived with Disability, and 
DisabilityAdjusted Life Years (DALYs).
RESULTS: The DALYs from Group 1 diseases were higher in all the countries in the 
region compared to those from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries, as 
well as total NCDs in 1990 and this was the same in the subregion in 2017, 
except in Cape Verde (with the highest SDI), where there were higher DALYs from 
NCDs/ injuries and the total NCDs than the Group 1 diseases. In 1990, deaths 
from Group 1 diseases were higher in all the countries in the region than those 
from the total NCDs except in Cape Verde, while in 2017, deaths from Group 1 
diseases were higher than those from Total NCDs except in Cape Verde, the 
Gambia, Ghana, and Senegal.
CONCLUSION: The overall pattern is that of concurrent communicable disease and 
increasing NCD burden with increasing SDI. Detailed understanding of these 
patterns and contextual factors are needed to help inform national and regional 
policies to address the epidemiological transition in the ECOWAS.

Publisher: INTRODUCTION: Cette étude a cherché à explorer le modèle de 
transition épidémiologique dans la Communauté économique des États de l’Afrique 
de l’Ouest (CEDEAO).
MÉTHODES: Nous avons extrait les données de l’étude sur la charge mondiale de 
morbidité. Les pays ont été regroupés à l’aide de l’indice sociodémographique 
(IDS). Le DisMod-MR 2.1, un outil de métarégression bayésienne, a été utilisé 
comme principale méthode d’estimation des variations des sources de données 
épidémiologiques et d’autres paramètres. Des exemples de ceux-ci comprenaient 
les prédictions du modèle, ainsi que les intervalles d’incertitude 
correspondants à 95 % pour tous les décès, les années de vie perdues, les années 
vécues avec une incapacité et les années de vie corrigées de l’incapacité 
(DALY).
RÉSULTATS: Les DALY des maladies du groupe 1 étaient plus élevées dans tous les 
pays de la région par rapport à celles des maladies non transmissibles (MNT) et 
des traumatismes, ainsi que le total des MNT en 1990 et il en était de même dans 
la sous-région en 2017, sauf au Cap. Verde (avec le SDI le plus élevé), où il y 
avait des DALY des MNT/blessures plus élevées et le total des MNT que les 
maladies du groupe 1. En 1990, les décès dus aux maladies du groupe 1 étaient 
plus élevés dans tous les pays de la région que ceux du total des MNT sauf au 
Cap-Vert, tandis qu’en 2017, les décès dus aux maladies du groupe 1 étaient plus 
élevés que ceux du total des MNT sauf au CapVert, le Gambie, Ghana et Sénégal.
CONCLUSION: Le schéma général est celui d’une maladie transmissible concomitante 
et d’un fardeau croissant des MNT avec l’augmentation du SDI. Une compréhension 
détaillée de ces modèles et facteurs contextuels est nécessaire pour aider à 
éclairer les politiques nationales et régionales pour faire face à la transition 
épidémiologique dans la CEDEAO.

With population aging and increased life expectancy, an increasing number of 
people are facing musculoskeletal health problems that necessitate therapeutic 
intervention at defect sites. Bone tissue engineering (BTE) has become a 
promising approach for bone graft substitutes as traditional treatments using 
autografts or allografts involve clinical complications. Significant 
advancements have been made in developing ideal BTE scaffolds that can integrate 
bioactive molecules promoting robust bone repair. Herein, we review bioactive 
scaffolds tuned for local bone regenerative therapy, particularly through 
integrating synthetic liposomal vesicles or extracellular vesicles to the 
scaffolds. Liposomes offer an excellent drug delivery system providing sustained 
release of the loaded bioactive molecules. Extracellular vesicles, with their 
inherent capacity to carry bioactive molecules, are emerging as an advanced 
substitute of synthetic nanoparticles and a novel cell-free therapy for bone 
regeneration. We discuss the recent advance in the use of synthetic liposomes 
and extracellular vesicles as bioactive materials combined with scaffolds, 
highlighting major challenges and opportunities for their applications in bone 
regeneration. We put a particular focus on strategies to integrate vesicles to 
various biomaterial scaffolds and introduce the latest advances in achieving 
sustained release of bioactive molecules from the vesicle-loaded scaffolds at 
the bone defect site.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is an acute and progressive neurodegenerative disorder, 
and diagnosis of the disease at its earliest stage is of paramount importance to 
improve the life expectancy of patients. α-Synuclein (α-syn) is a potential 
biomarker for the early diagnosis of PD, and there is a great need to develop a 
biosensing platform that precisely detects α-syn in human body fluids. Herein, 
we developed a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor based on the label-free 
iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) and paired antibody for the highly 
sensitive and selective detection of α-syn in serum samples. The sensitivity of 
the SPR platform is enhanced significantly by directly depositing Fe3O4 NPs on 
the Au surface at a high density to increase the decay length of the evanescent 
field on the Au film. Moreover, the utilization of rabbit-type monoclonal 
antibody (α-syn-RmAb) immobilized on Au films allows the SPR platform to have a 
high affinity-selectivity binding performance compared to mouse-type monoclonal 
antibodies as a common bioreceptor for capturing α-syn molecules. As a result, 
the current platform has a detection limit of 5.6&nbsp;fg/mL, which is 
20,000-fold lower than that of commercial ELISA. The improved sensor chip can 
also be easily regenerated to repeat the α-syn measurement with the same 
sensitivity. Furthermore, the SPR sensor was applied to the direct analysis of 
α-syn in serum samples. By using a format of paired α-syn-RmAb, the SPR sensor 
provides a recovery rate in the range from 94.5% to 104.3% to detect the α-syn 
in diluted serum samples precisely. This work demonstrates a highly sensitive 
and selective quantification approach to detect α-syn in human biofluids and 
paves the way for the future development in the early diagnosis of PD.

IMPORTANCE: The possibility of widespread use of a novel effective therapy for 
Alzheimer disease (AD) will present important clinical, policy, and financial 
challenges.
OBJECTIVE: To describe how including different patient, caregiver, and societal 
treatment-related factors affects estimates of the cost-effectiveness of a 
hypothetical disease-modifying AD treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this economic evaluation, the Alzheimer 
Disease Archimedes Condition Event Simulator was used to simulate the prognosis 
of a hypothetical cohort of patients selected from the Alzheimer Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative database who received the diagnosis of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI). Scenario analyses that varied costs and quality of life inputs 
relevant to patients and caregivers were conducted. The analysis was designed 
and conducted from June 15, 2019, to September 30, 2020.
EXPOSURES: A hypothetical drug that would delay progression to dementia in 
individuals with MCI compared with usual care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), 
measured by cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: The model included a simulated cohort of patients who scored between 24 
and 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination and had a global Clinical Dementia 
Rating scale of 0.5, with a required memory box score of 0.5 or higher, at 
baseline. Using a health care sector perspective, which included only individual 
patient health care costs, the ICER for the hypothetical treatment was $192 000 
per QALY gained. The result decreased to $183 000 per QALY gained in a 
traditional societal perspective analysis with the inclusion of patient 
non-health care costs. The inclusion of estimated caregiver health care costs 
produced almost no change in the ICER, but the inclusion of QALYs gained by 
caregivers led to a substantial reduction in the ICER for the hypothetical 
treatment, to $107 000 per QALY gained in the health sector perspective. In the 
societal perspective scenario, with the broadest inclusion of patient and 
caregiver factors, the ICER decreased to $74 000 per added QALY.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this economic evaluation suggest that 
policy makers should be aware that efforts to estimate and include the effects 
of AD treatments outside those on patients themselves can affect the results of 
the cost-effectiveness analyses that often underpin assessments of the value of 
new treatments. Further research and debate on including these factors in 
assessments that will inform discussions on fair pricing for new treatments are 
needed.

The citrus red mite (Panonychus citri) is a challenge to manage in citrus 
orchards due to resistance against several pesticides. There is a necessity 
therefore to find new pesticides for effective control of P. citri. This study 
was designed to evaluate the lethal and sublethal effects of emamectin benzoate 
against P. citri. The results showed that the LC50 of emamectin benzoate to 
adults of P. citri was 0.35 (0.26-0.43) mg a.i. L-1 and the LC90 was 1.44 
(1.16-1.96) mg a.i. L-1. The sublethal concentration exposures (LC10 and LC30) 
had a significant negative impact on the larval, protonymph, and deutonymph 
developmental periods. Male longevity was much lower in LC30 treatments than in 
the controls. Although female longevity was unaffected, the fecundity (eggs per 
female) was decreased in the sublethal concentration treatments. Results 
revealed that the adult pre-oviposition period (APOP) and total pre-oviposition 
period (TPOP) were increased. Other growth parameters r, λ, and R0 decreased, 
whereas mean generation time (T) increased due to pesticide exposure. The 
survival rate (Sxj), age-specific fecundity and net maternity, life expectancy 
(Exj), and reproduction (Vxj) was reduced by LC10 and LC30 exposure. An increase 
in malondialdehyde (MDA) contents with increasing emamectin benzoate 
concentration demonstrates that emamectin benzoate induces oxidative stress in 
P. citri. The activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD and 
catalase, CAT) was decreased due to LC30 and LC10 treatments compared to the 
control. Detoxification enzyme activity (cytochrome P450, 
glutathione-S-transferases, GST and acetylcholinesterase, AChE) was increased in 
treated mites compared to the control. This study demonstrates that emamectin 
benzoate has both a lethal effect on citrus red mite and sublethal effects on 
its biology and physiology. It is, therefore, potentially an effective pesticide 
for management of P. citri.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are the second leading mental health-related cause 
of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) 
worldwide. This study aimed to quantitatively assess the burden of anxiety 
disorders at the global, regional, and national levels in 1990 and 2019 and the 
trends over this period.
METHODS: We used data for incidence cases, DALYs, age-standardized incidence
