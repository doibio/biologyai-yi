Obesity and its repercussions constitute an important source of morbidity, 
impaired quality of life and its complications can have a major bearing on life 
expectancy. The present article summarizes the most important co-morbidities of 
obesity and their prevalence. Furthermore, it describes classification and 
grading systems that can be used to assess the individual and combined impact of 
co-morbid conditions on mortality risk. The literature was screened for 
assessment tools that can be deployed in the quantification of morbidity and 
mortality risk in individual patients. Thirteen specific domains have been 
identified that account for morbidity and mortality in obesity. Cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) and cancer account for the greatest mortality risk associated with 
obesity. The King's Criteria and Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS) were 
identified as useful tools for the detection and monitoring of individual 
patient mortality risk in obesity care. The stark facts on the complications of 
obesity should be capitalized on to improve patient management and knowledge and 
referred to in the wider dissemination of public health messages aimed at 
improving primary prevention.

The aim of research was to assess the impact of the introduction of information 
system 1C: Enterprise on the work of medical staff. It was evaluated staff 
satisfaction in terms of quality and speed of their duties, as well as 
sociological changes after the introduction in the work the information system 
1C: Enterprise from 2010. The research involved 138 employees of the hospital, 
including 48 doctors and 90 nurses with experience of at least 5 years. The 
average age of respondents was 45 years. The study was conducted through 
questionnaires, including questions relating to life expectancy, changing the 
speed and quality of execution of tasks, also attended to questions about the 
change in the frequency of conflict situations and wages. Separately, it was 
included open-ended question about the change in the level of motivation before 
and after the implementation of the information system. Respondents gave the 
evaluation and describe the specific changes they have noticed. Objective 
assessment of the effectiveness was evaluated according to the official 
statistics on the number of people served, the time spent on one patient, the 
level of qualification of medical personnel. 76% of employees have noted 
positive changes in the work after the implementation of the information system 
1C: Enterprise in the work, there is a change of diagnosis rate, the quality of 
treatment, 72.3% of physicians and 48% of nurses have noted a decrease in time 
spent on paperwork. 13.6% of physicians and 23.0% of nurses did not notice any 
difference. Other members expressed dissatisfaction, because of the necessity of 
learning of a computer program. After the number of the served population 
program of work increased by 6.8%, decreased the number of days of 
hospitalization by 12%. The use of modern information systems increases the 
level of health services and health workers, increasing productivity.

To investigate the mortality probability, life expectancy of coal workers' 
pneumoconiosis (CWP), and related factors of life expectancy, a total of 495 
patients with CWP were diagnosed and reported from 1963 to 2014 in a state-owned 
mine in the east of China. The life table method, log rank method, and Cox 
regression model were used for survival analysis. 95 out of 495 CWP died during 
this period. The mortality rate was 19.19%. The average life span was 12.1 
(0.0-33.2) years and average death age was 57.4 (33.0-83.0) years. The life 
table indicated that overall mortality probability increased with the age of CWP 
patients. Life expectancy of CWP patients was prolonged to 4.3, 1.4, 1.2, and 
1.4 years without death caused by pneumoconiosis, tuberculosis, lung cancer, and 
pulmonary heart disease respectively. The survival curve of CWP patients without 
pulmonary tuberculosis was higher (average 37.9 years) than patients with 
pulmonary tuberculosis (average 34.1 years). There was significant difference 
observed (χ² = 6.196, p < 0.05). Three risk factors that include initial dust 
exposure year, age of onset, and first diagnostic stage were put into the Cox 
regression model for evaluation. The data indicated that prevention and 
treatment of CWP complication is important to improve patients' survival rates.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of financial compensation on long-term 
mortality in adults with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: An inception cohort of 2545 adults 
consecutively discharged from three metropolitan, post-acute inpatient 
rehabilitation services of the NSW Brain Injury Rehabilitation Programme from 1 
July 1990 to 1 October 2007.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Survival status at 1 October 2009.
RESULTS: Compensation data were available for 1851 (73%) participants, with 826 
(45%) receiving financial compensation. Yearly standardized mortality ratios 
remained elevated above general population norms for six to ten years for both 
groups. Compensation had a protective effect on mortality risk as a univariate 
predictor. However, when considered in multivariate Cox regression analysis, 
compensation had minimal effect on mortality risk when modelled with 
non-modifiable demographic factors and pre-existing medical history. Conversely, 
compensation trended towards a protective effect when modelled with post-injury 
variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Financial compensation had a protective effect against late 
mortality following rehabilitation for severe TBI through complex interactions 
with rehabilitation service variables but not with injury-related variables. 
This finding suggests that wider access to compensation (and hence 
rehabilitation) through recently implemented schemes (e.g., NSW Lifetime Care 
and Support) may further improve life expectancy for this clinical population.

Intravenous leiomyomatosis is a life-threatening leiomyoma that grows into the 
extrauterine venous system. A high recurrence rate has been reported in 
reproductive-age women who undergo only tumor excision to preserve fertility. 
Precise diagnosis of tumor extension is essential to achieve complete resection. 
A 24-year-old woman presented with hypermenorrhea. Contrast-enhanced MRI showed 
an intramural myoma with worm-like extension into the right parametrium. F-FES 
PET/MRI accurately depicted the extension with strong FES activity into the 
right uterine vein, whereas F-FDG PET/MRI excluded the possibility of 
malignancy. These modalities can be a novel strategy to manage such cases of 
intractable intravenous leiomyomatosis.

The objective is to understand what really drives prescription expenditure at 
the end of life in order to inform future expenditure projections and service 
planning. To achieve this objective an empirical analysis of public medication 
expenditure on the older population (individuals ≥ 70 years of age) in Ireland 
(n = 231,780) was undertaken. A two part model is used to analysis the 
individual effects of age, proximity to death (PTD) and morbidity using 
individual patient-level data from administrative pharmacy records for 2006-2009 
covering the population of community medication users. Decedents (n = 14,084) 
consistently use more medications and incur larger expenditures than similar 
survivors, especially in the last 6 months of life. The data show a positive and 
statistically significant impact of PTD on prescribing expenditures with minimal 
effect for age alone even accounting for patient morbidities. Nevertheless 
improved measures of morbidity are required to fully test the hypothesis that 
age and PTD are proxies for morbidity. The evidence presented refutes age as a 
driver of prescription expenditure and highlights the importance of accounting 
for mortality in future expenditure projections.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 
on-going decentralised targeted hepatitis B vaccination program for behavioural 
high-risk groups operated by regional public health services in the Netherlands 
since 1-November-2002. Target groups for free vaccination are men having sex 
with men (MSM), commercial sex workers (CSW) and hard drug users (HDU). 
Heterosexuals with a high partner change rate (HRP) were included until 
1-November-2007.
METHODS: Based on participant, vaccination and serology data collected up to 
31-December-2012, the number of participants and program costs were estimated. 
Observed anti-HBc prevalence was used to estimate the probability of susceptible 
individuals per risk-group to become infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 
their remaining life. We distinguished two time-periods: 2002-2006 and 
2007-2012, representing different recruitment strategies and target groups. 
Correcting for observed vaccination compliance, the number of future 
HBV-infections avoided was estimated per risk-group. By combining these numbers 
with estimates of life-years lost, quality-of-life losses and healthcare costs 
of HBV-infections - as obtained from a Markov model-, the benefit of the program 
was estimated for each risk-group separately.
RESULTS: The overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the program was 
€30,400/QALY gained, with effects and costs discounted at 1.5% and 4%, 
respectively. The program was more cost-effective in the first period 
(€24,200/QALY) than in the second period (€42,400/QALY). In particular, the 
cost-effectiveness for MSM decreased from €20,700/QALY to €47,700/QALY.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This decentralised targeted HBV-vaccination program 
is a cost-effective intervention in certain unvaccinated high-risk adults. 
Saturation within the risk-groups, participation of individuals with less risky 
behaviour, and increased recruitment investments in the second period made the 
program less cost-effective over time. The project should therefore discus how 
to reduce costs per risk-group, increase effects or when to integrate the 
vaccination in regular healthcare.

BACKGROUND: Antibiotics do not reduce mortality or short-term treatment 
non-response in patients receiving treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD in 
an outpatient setting. However, the long-term effects of antibiotics are 
unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate if the antibiotic doxycycline 
added to the oral corticosteroid prednisolone prolongs time to next exacerbation 
in patients with COPD receiving treatment for an exacerbation in the outpatient 
setting.
METHODS: In this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial, we recruited 
a cohort of patients with COPD from outpatient clinics of nine teaching 
hospitals and three primary care centres in the Netherlands. Inclusion criteria 
were an age of at least 45 years, a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years, 
mild-to-severe COPD (Global Initiative of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 
[GOLD] stage 1-3), and at least one exacerbation during the past 3 years. 
Exclusion criteria were poor mastery of the Dutch language, poor cognitive 
functioning, known allergy to doxycycline, pregnancy, and a life expectancy of 
shorter than 1 month. If a participant had an exacerbation, we randomly assigned 
them (1:1; with permuted blocks of variable sizes [ranging from two to ten]; 
stratified by GOLD stage 1-2 vs 3) to a 7 day course of oral doxycycline 100 mg 
daily (200 mg on the first day) or placebo. Exclusion criteria for randomisation 
were fever, admission to hospital, and current use of antibiotics or use within 
the previous 3 weeks. Patients in both groups received a 10 day course of 30 mg 
oral prednisolone daily. Patients, investigators, and those assessing outcomes 
were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was time to next 
exacerbation in all randomly allocated patients except for those incorrectly 
randomly allocated who did not meet the inclusion criteria or met the exclusion 
criteria. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, number 
NTR2499.
FINDINGS: Between Dec 22, 2010, and Aug 6, 2013, we randomly allocated 305 (34%) 
patients from the cohort of 887 patients to doxycycline (152 [50%]) or placebo 
(153 [50%]), excluding four (1%) patients (two [1%] from each group) who were 
incorrectly randomly allocated from the analysis. 257 (85%) of 301 patients had 
a next exacerbation (131 [87%] of 150 in the doxycycline group vs 126 [83%] of 
151 in the placebo group). Median time to next exacerbation was 148 days (95% CI 
95-200) in the doxycycline group compared with 161 days (118-211) in the placebo 
group (hazard ratio 1·01 [95% CI 0·79-1·31]; p=0·91). We did not note any 
significant differences between groups in the frequency of adverse events during 
the first 2 weeks after randomisation (47 [31%] of 150 in the doxycycline group 
vs 53 [35%] of 151 in the placebo group; p=0·54) or in serious adverse events 
during the 2 years of follow-up (42 [28%] vs 43 [29%]; p=1).
INTERPRETATION: In patients with mild-to-severe COPD receiving treatment for an 
exacerbation in an outpatient setting, the antibiotic doxycycline added to the 
oral corticosteroid prednisolone did not prolong time to next exacerbation 
compared with prednisolone alone. These findings do not support prescription of 
antibiotics for COPD exacerbations in an outpatient setting.

Mobile App for Treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence: A Cost-Effectiveness 
Analysis.

Sjöström M(1), Lindholm L(1), Samuelsson E(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Umeå University, Umeå, 
Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Mobile apps can increase access to care, facilitate self-management, 
and improve adherence to treatment. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) affects 
10-35% of women and, currently, an app with instructions for pelvic floor muscle 
training (PFMT) is available as first-line treatment. A previous randomized 
controlled study demonstrated that the app benefitted symptom severity and 
quality of life (QoL); in this study we investigate the cost-effectiveness of 
the app.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the health economy of the 
app for treating SUI.
METHODS: This deterministic cost-utility analysis, with a 1-year societal 
perspective, compared the app treatment with no treatment. Health economic data 
were collected alongside a randomized controlled trial performed in Sweden from 
March 2013 to October 2014. This study included 123 community-dwelling women 
participants of 18 years and above, with stress urinary incontinence ≥1 time per 
week. Participants were self-assessed with validated questionnaires and 2-day 
leakage diaries, and then randomized to 3 months of treatment (app group, n=62) 
or no treatment (controls, n=61). The app focused on pelvic floor muscle 
training, prescribed 3 times daily. We continuously registered treatment 
delivery costs. Data were collected on each participant's training time, 
incontinence aids, and laundry at baseline and at a 3-month follow-up. We 
measured quality of life with the International Consultation on Incontinence 
Modular Questionnaire on Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Quality of Life, and 
calculated the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Data from the 3-month 
follow-up were extrapolated to 1 year for the calculations. Our main outcome was 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios compared between app and control 
groups. One-way and multiway sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 44.7 years (SD 9.4). Annual costs were 
€547.0 for the app group and €482.4 for the control group. Annual gains in 
quality-adjusted life years for app and control groups were 0.0101 and 0.0016, 
respectively. Compared with controls, the extra cost per quality-adjusted life 
year for the app group ranged from -€2425.7 to €14,870.6, which indicated 
greater gains in quality-adjusted life years at similar or slightly higher cost.
CONCLUSIONS: The app for treating stress urinary incontinence is a new, 
cost-effective, first-line treatment with potential for increasing access to 
care in a sustainable way for this patient group.

BACKGROUND: Examination of linked data on patient outcomes and cost of care may 
help identify areas where stroke care can be improved. We report on the 
association between variations in stroke severity, patient outcomes, cost, and 
treatment patterns observed over the acute hospital stay and through the 
12-month follow-up for subjects receiving endovascular therapy compared to 
intravenous tissue plasminogen activator alone in the IMS (Interventional 
Management of Stroke) III Trial.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective data collected for a prespecified economic 
analysis of the trial were used. Data included hospital billing records for the 
initial stroke admission and subsequent detailed resource use after the acute 
hospitalization collected at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Cost of follow-up care 
varied 6-fold for patients in the lowest (0-1) and highest (20+) National 
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale category at 5 days, and by modified Rankin 
Scale at 3 months. The kind of resources used postdischarge also varied between 
treatment groups. Incremental short-term cost-effectiveness ratios varied 
greatly when treatments were compared for patient subgroups. Patient subgroups 
predefined by stroke severity had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 
$97 303/quality-adjusted life year (severe stroke) and 
$3 187 805/quality-adjusted life year (moderately severe stroke).
CONCLUSIONS: Detailed economic and resource utilization data from IMS III 
provide powerful evidence for the large effect that patient outcome has on the 
economic value of medical and endovascular reperfusion therapies. These data can 
be used to inform process improvements for stroke care and to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of endovascular therapy in the US health system for stroke 
intervention trials.

BACKGROUND: Few data exist regarding when to stop surveillance colonoscopy among 
older adults with a history of adenomatous colorectal polyps. Our goal was to 
understand decision making around surveillance colonoscopy among primary care 
providers (PCPs) and gastroenterologists.
METHODS: We designed a 15-item survey for PCPs and gastroenterologists that 
evaluated factors important in decision making about surveillance colonoscopy in 
older adults.
RESULTS: In October 2015, 88 PCPs and 30 gastroenterologists completed the 
survey. Life expectancy (40%), gastroenterology recommendation (8%), and patient 
preference (12%) were the most important factors for PCPs. Findings on prior 
colonoscopy were most important among gastroenterologists. Regardless of 
specialty, respondents felt that the existing literature on surveillance 
colonoscopy in older adults is inadequate.
CONCLUSIONS: More data surrounding the benefits and risk of surveillance 
colonoscopy are needed to inform when to stop surveillance colonoscopy among 
older adults with a positive screening history.

The outcomes of second primary oropharyngeal cancer (SPOPC) may not be 
determined by oropharyngeal cancer but from the other index cancer as well. The 
management of (SPOPC) remains inconclusive and limited. Transoral robotic 
surgery (TORS) to maximize the functional outcomes without reducing oncologic 
effect is suggested as the primary treatment for selected oropharyngeal cancer. 
This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of TORS for the 
management of SPOPC. Patients who underwent TORS from January 2011 to June 2015 
at a tertian referral center in Taiwan were recruited. Loco-regional status, 
overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and postoperative 
functional status were evaluated. Fifteen patients received TORS for SPOPC with 
curative intent, including eleven with tongue-base carcinomas, and four with 
tonsil carcinomas. One case was terminated because of inadequate exposure and 
the other 14 cases were completed with negative pathologic margins. Two-year OS 
and DSS were 53 and 77%, respectively. Patients with SPOPC occurring within 
6 months had poorer outcomes (p = 0.044). The median time to feeding-tube 
removal was 5 days, and one patient had long-term gastric-tube dependence. 
Patients of age <65 years with synchronous SPOPC and esophageal cancer as the 
other index cancer were significant worse in oncologic outcomes. We concluded 
that TORS is a feasible alternative treatment in selected patients with SPOPC. 
Patients with metachronous T1-2 SPOPC without an esophageal primary can achieve 
excellent survival after TORS, while TORS can maximize functional preservation 
with limited destruction in patients with low life expectancy.

This study aimed to evaluate the biotic potential and life table of individuals 
of Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) from different host plants (citrus, corn, and 
cotton) and Brazilian states (São Paulo, Distrito Federal, and Bahia) in 
artificial diet, under laboratory conditions (25 ± 1°C, 70 ± 10% RH, 14 h 
photophase). The longevity, pre-, post- and oviposition periods, fecundity, and 
fertility of 15 mating pairs per origin were evaluated. We also compared the 
reproductive parameters of each group of insects (São Paulo (SP), Distrito 
Federal (DF), and Bahia (BA)), including the net reproductive rate (Ro), mean 
generation time (T), intrinsic rate of increase (r m), and finite rate of 
increase (λ). Microsatellite analysis from individuals collected in different 
locations and host plants did not show differences among the parental insects. 
It was verified that parental progeny collected in cotton fields from Bahia had 
a higher biotic potential, a higher reproductive rate (Ro), and a better 
fecundity compared to the insects from remaining regions. The life table charts 
indicate that the highest values for the reproductive parameters of the Bahia 
progeny are associated with higher specific fertility, particularly in early 
adulthood. The greatest biotic potential of the Bahia progeny may be due to 
increased selection pressure from the insecticide used (organophosphate and 
pyrethroid) on cotton crops compared to that of other crops, as well due to the 
massive adoption of Bt cotton-producing areas of that state from 2013 outbreaks.

This article outlines the current and future-projected demographic data, 
organization, networks for the care of older people, and perspectives in Costa 
Rica in relation to the challenges resulting from exponential growth of the 
older adult population, most notably those aged 80 and older. It includes 
consideration of the Norms of Integrated Care of the Older Adult of Costa Rica's 
national social security system and contributions from other public and private 
institutions. It also makes note of commentaries on the need for ever-increasing 
efforts to manage the care of Costa Rica's burgeoning older adult population.

AIMS: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of the subcutaneous RANKL 
inhibitor, denosumab, vs the intravenous bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid, for 
the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with prostate 
cancer, breast cancer, and other solid tumors (OST) in the Czech Republic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was developed to compare the 
effects of denosumab and zoledronic acid on costs (including drug costs and 
administration, patient management, SREs, and adverse events), quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from a national 
payer perspective. Different discount rates, time horizons, SRE rates, 
distributions, and nature (asymptomatic vs all SREs), and the inclusion of 
treatment discontinuation were considered in scenario analyses. The robustness 
of the model was tested using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Across tumor types, denosumab was associated with fewer SREs, improved 
QALYs, and higher total costs over a lifetime. The incremental cost per QALY 
gained for denosumab vs zoledronic acid was 382,673 CZK for prostate cancer, 
408,450 CZK for breast cancer, and 608,133 CZK for OST. Incremental costs per 
SRE avoided for the same tumor type were 54,007 CZK, 51,765 CZK, and 94,426 CZK, 
respectively. In scenario analyses, the results remained similar to baseline, 
when different discount rates and time horizons were considered. At a 
non-official willingness-to-pay threshold of 1.2 million CZK, the probabilities 
of denosumab being cost-effective vs zoledronic acid were 0.64, 0.67, and 0.49 
for prostate cancer, breast cancer, and OST, respectively.
LIMITATIONS: The SRE rates used were obtained from clinical trials; studies 
suggest rates may be higher in clinical practice. Additional evidence on 
real-world SRE rates could further improve the accuracy of the modeling.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with zoledronic acid, denosumab provides a cost-effective 
treatment option for the prevention of SREs in patients with prostate cancer, 
breast cancer, and OST in the Czech Republic.

Portugal: Health System Review.

Medicine, NOVA University of Lisbon.

This analysis of the Portuguese health system reviews recent developments in 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. Overall health indicators such as life 
expectancy at birth and at age 65 years have shown a notable improvement over 
the last decades. However, these improvements have not been followed at the same 
pace by other important dimensions of health: child poverty and its 
consequences, mental health and quality of life after 65. Health inequalities 
remain a general problem in the country. All residents in Portugal have access 
to health care provided by the National Health Service (NHS), financed mainly 
through taxation. Out-of-pocket payments have been increasing over time, not 
only co-payments, but particularly direct payments for private outpatient 
consultations, examinations and pharmaceuticals. The level of cost-sharing is 
highest for pharmaceutical products. Between one-fifth and one-quarter of the 
population has a second (or more) layer of health insurance coverage through 
health subsystems (for specific sectors or occupations) and voluntary health 
insurance (VHI). VHI coverage varies between schemes, with basic schemes 
covering a basic package of services, whereas more expensive schemes cover a 
broader set of services, including higher ceilings of health care expenses. 
Health care delivery is by both public and private providers. Public provision 
is predominant in primary care and hospital care, with a gate-keeping system in 
place for access to hospital care. Pharmaceutical products, diagnostic 
technologies and private practice by physicians constitute the bulk of private 
health care provision. In May 2011, the economic crisis led Portugal to sign a 
Memorandum of Understanding with the International Monetary Fund, the European 
Commission and the European Central Bank, in exchange for a loan of 78 billion 
euros. The agreed Economic and Financial Adjustment Programme included 34 
measures aimed at increasing cost-containment, improving efficiency and 
increasing regulation in the health sector. Reforms implemented since 2011 by 
the Ministry of Health include: improving regulation and governance, health 
promotion (launch of priority health programmes such as for diabetes and mental 
health), rebalancing the pharmaceutical market (new rules for price setting, 
reduction in the prices of pharmaceuticals, increasing use of generic drugs), 
expanding and coordinating long-term and palliative care, and strengthening 
primary and hospital care.

Malta: Health System Review.

Maltese life expectancy is high, and Maltese people spend on average close to 
90% of their lifespan in good health, longer than in any other EU country. Malta 
has recently increased the proportion of GDP spent on health to above the EU 
average, though the private part of that remains higher than in many EU 
countries. The total number of doctors and GPs per capita is at the EU average, 
but the number of specialists remains relatively low; education and training are 
being further strengthened in order to retain more specialist skills in Malta. 
The health care system offers universal coverage to a comprehensive set of 
services that are free at the point of use for people entitled to statutory 
provision. The historical pattern of integrated financing and provision is 
shifting towards a more pluralist approach; people already often choose to visit 
private primary care providers, and in 2016 a new public-private partnership 
contract for three existing hospitals was agreed. Important priorities for the 
coming years include further strengthening of the primary and mental health 
sectors, as well as strengthening the health information system in order to 
support improved monitoring and evaluation. The priorities of Malta during its 
Presidency of the Council of the EU in 2017 include childhood obesity, and 
Structured Cooperation to enhance access to highly specialized and innovative 
services, medicines and technologies. Overall, the Maltese health system has 
made remarkable progress, with improvements in avoidable mortality and low 
levels of unmet need. The main outstanding challenges include: adapting the 
health system to an increasingly diverse population; increasing capacity to cope 
with a growing population; redistributing resources and activity from hospitals 
to primary care; ensuring access to expensive new medicines whilst still making 
efficiency improvements; and addressing medium-term financial sustainability 
challenges from demographic ageing.

and Policies.

This analysis of the health system of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
reviews recent developments in organization and governance, health financing, 
health care provision, health reforms and health system performance. The country 
has made important progress during its transition from a socialist system to a 
market-based system, particularly in reforming the organization, financing and 
delivery of health care and establishing a mix of private and public providers. 
Though total health care expenditure has risen in absolute terms in recent 
decades, it has consistently fallen as share of GDP, and high levels of private 
health expenditure remain. Despite this, the health of the population has 
improved over the last decades, with life expectancy and mortality rates for 
both adults and children reaching similar levels to those in ex-communist EU 
countries, though death rates caused by unhealthy behaviour remain high. 
Inheriting a large health infrastructure, good public health services and 
well-distributed health service coverage after independence in 1991, the country 
re-built a social health insurance system with a broad benefit package. Primary 
care providers were privatized and new private hospitals were allowed to enter 
the market. In recent years, the country reformed the organization of care 
delivery to better incorporate both public and private providers in an 
integrated system. Significant efficiency gains were reached with a pioneering 
health information system that has reduced waiting times and led to a better 
coordination of care. This multi-modular e-health system has the potential to 
further reduce existing inefficiencies and to generate evidence for assessment 
and research. Despite this progress, satisfaction with health care delivery is 
very mixed with low satisfaction levels with public providers. The public 
hospital sector in particular is characterized by inefficient organization, 
financing and provision of health care; and many professionals move to other 
countries and to the private sector. Future challenges include sustainable 
planning and management of human resources as well as enhancing quality and 
efficiency of care through reform of hospital financing and organization.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the characteristics of blood pressure (BP), heart rate 
(HR), and double product in a Japanese population sample.
METHODS: We pooled individual records from 1999 to 2005 for 111 007 participants 
in 25 community-based cohorts and seven worksite-based cohorts. The data were 
analyzed to provide information on BP, HR, and double product according to 
age-sex groups and use of antihypertensive medication.
RESULTS: Average BP was 130/77 mmHg among men and women combined. Among 
untreated individuals, SBP increased with age, whereas DBP reached a ceiling 
around the age of 60 years. The average SBP of treated participants was around 
140 mmHg, irrespective of age, whereas DBP decreased linearly with age, and 
56.4% of treated participants had a BP of 140/90 mmHg or over. HR did not differ 
across age groups or treatment status. The double product, also called the 
rate-pressure product, calculated by multiplying the SBP and the HR, increased 
with age among untreated individuals, whereas it first decreased and then 
increased with age among treated individuals.
CONCLUSION: Based on these collaborative data, insufficient BP control in Japan, 
where the average life expectancy is the longest in the world, was seen.
