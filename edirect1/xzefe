Background: Previous studies suggest that when combined with exercise, 
Aureobasidium pullulans-derived β-glucan (APβG) may enhance muscle health and 
fitness profiles because of its ability to improve exercise-induced fatigue and 
preserve muscle mass. Objectives: The objective was to examine the combined 
effects and safety of APβG consumption and regular resistance exercise for 12 
weeks on muscle strength, biomarkers, and fitness profiles in adults with 
relatively low skeletal muscle mass. Methods: We conducted a randomized, 
double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in adults aged ≥50 years with <110% of 
the standard lean mass. Eighty participants randomly received either 1000 mg of 
APβG per day or a placebo for 12 weeks. All participants underwent resistance 
training three times per week. At baseline and 12 weeks after treatment, we 
assessed their knee extension/flexion strength, handgrip strength, body 
composition, and biomarkers. We also evaluated Euro-QoL-5D (EQ-5D) 
questionnaire, food intake, and physical activity at baseline and 12 weeks after 
treatment. Results: The combination of APβG and regular resistance exercise over 
12 weeks resulted in a higher right knee flexion strength by 4.49 Nm (95% CI; 
-0.12-8.86 Nm; P = 0.044) than the placebo according to the intention-to-treat 
analysis. The combination intervention also led to a higher right knee flexion 
strength of 5.60 Nm (0.18-11.02 Nm; P = 0.043) and left knee flexion strength of 
7.25 Nm (0.22-14.28 Nm; P = 0.043) than the placebo according to the 
per-protocol (PP) analysis. In addition, compared to the placebo, the combined 
intervention enhanced right-hand grip strength by 1.40 kg (0.19-2.61 kg; P = 
0.024) and left-hand grip strength by 1.33 kg (0.01-2.65 kg; P = 0.048) 
according to PP analysis. The combined intervention also resulted in a more 
significant reduction in the time required for the 400 m walk test than the 
placebo. None of the participants experienced adverse events. Conclusion: APβG, 
in addition to regular resistance exercise, may enhance skeletal muscle strength 
and fitness in adults with relatively low skeletal muscle mass.

Two thrips, Megalurothrips usitatus (Bagnall) and Frankliniella intonsa (Trybom) 
are major pests of cowpea in South China. To realistically compare the growth, 
development and reproductive characteristics of these two thrips species, we 
compared their age-stage, two-sex life tables on cowpea pods under summer and 
winter natural environmental regimes. The results showed that the total preadult 
period of M. usitatus was 8.09 days, which was significantly longer than that of 
F. intonsa (7.06 days), while the adult female longevity of M. usitatus (21.14 
days) was significantly shorter than that of F. intonsa (25.77 days). 
Significant differences were showed in male adult longevity (10.68 days for F. 
intonsa and 16.95 days for M. usitatus) and the female ratio of offspring (0.67 
for F. intonsa and 0.51 for M. usitatus), and the total preadult period of M. 
usitatus (16.20 days) was significantly longer than that of F. intonsa (13.66 
days) in the winter regime. The net reproductive rate (summer: R0 = 85.62, 
winter: R0 = 105.22), intrinsic rate of increase (summer: r = 0.3020 day-1, 
winter: r = 0.2115 day-1), finite rate of increase (summer: λ = 1.3526 day-1, 
winter: λ = 1.2356 day-1) and gross reproduction rate (summer: GRR = 139.34, 
winter: GRR = 159.88) of F. intonsa were higher than those of M. usitatus 
(summer: R0 = 82.91, r = 0.2741, λ = 1.3155, GRR = 135.71; winter: R0 = 80.62, r 
= 0.1672, λ = 1.1820, GRR = 131.26), and the mean generation times (summer: T = 
14.73 days, winter: T = 22.01 days) of F. intonsa were significantly shorter 
than those of M. usitatus (summer: T = 16.11 days, winter: T = 26.25 days). 
These results may contribute to a better understanding of the bioecology of 
different thrips species, especially the interspecific competition between two 
economically important cowpea thrips with the same ecological niche in a 
changing environment.

Increased human life expectancy broadens the alternatives for missing teeth and 
played a role in the widespread use of dental implants and related augmentation 
procedures for the aging population. Though, many of these patients may have one 
or more diseases. These systemic conditions may directly lead to surgical 
complications, compromise implant/bone healing, or influence long-term 
peri-implant health and its response to biologic nuisances. Offering patients 
credible expectations regarding intra- and postoperative complications and 
therapeutic prognosis is an ethical and legal obligation. Clear identification 
of potential types of adverse effects, complications, or errors is important for 
decision-making processes as they may be related to different local, systemic, 
and technical aspects. Therefore, the present review structures the underlying 
biological mechanisms, clinical evidence, and clinical recommendations for the 
most common systemic risk factors for implant-related complications.

BACKGROUND: High fasting plasma glucose (FPG) has been listed as one of the risk 
factors for bladder cancer. We here estimated the global, regional, and national 
levels of bladder cancer burden attributable to high FPG from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Bladder cancer data attributable to high FPG were extracted from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, and analyzed by age, sex, year, and 
location. Age-standardized rates were utilized to evaluate the burden between 
different populations. The temporal trend of the burden was estimated through 
the Joinpoint analysis.
RESULTS: In 2019, high FPG contributed to 22,823.33 (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI], 4694.88-48,962.26) deaths and 399,654.91 (95% UI, 81,609.35-865,890.95) 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of bladder cancer globally. Since 1990, 
the global age-standardized death and DALY rates of bladder cancer attributable 
to high FPG increased apparently by 39.18% and 41.48%, respectively. During the 
last 30 years, high FPG-related age-standardized death and DALY rates of bladder 
cancer have increased in all countries. In 2019, Central Europe showed the 
greatest high FPG-related age-standardized death and DALY rates of bladder 
cancer, but Andean Latin America had the lowest rates. Nationally, Lebanon 
showed the greatest high FPG-related age-standardized death and DALY rates of 
bladder cancer in 2019. High FPG-attributable deaths and DALYs of bladder cancer 
were more considerable among males and older people. Countries with high SDI 
showed higher levels of age-standardized death and DALY rates of bladder cancer 
due to high FPG and presented remarkable upward trends in rates in the last 
30 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, the high FPG-associated bladder cancer burden has 
remarkably increased in all countries, and showed a higher level among countries 
with higher SDI. Monitoring FPG levels among patients with bladder cancer is 
critical to lower the corresponding burden.

Telomere length (TL) may be a biomarker of aging processes as well as 
age-related diseases. However, most studies of TL and aging are conducted in 
high-income countries. Less is known in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) 
such as South Africa, where life expectancy remains lower despite population 
aging. We conducted a descriptive analysis of TL in a cohort of older adults in 
rural South Africa. TL was assayed from venous blood draws using quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (T/S ratio). We examined the correlation between TL 
and biomarkers, demographic characteristics, mental/cognitive health measures, 
and physical performance measures in a subsample of the Wave 1 2014-2015 "Health 
and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH Community in South 
Africa" (HAALSI) cohort (n = 510). We used logistic regression to measure the 
association between TL and mortality through Wave 3 (2021-2022). In bivariate 
analyses, TL was significantly correlated with age (r = -0.29, p < .0001), 
self-reported female sex (r = 0.13, p = .002), mortality (r = -0.1297, p = 
.003), diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.09, p = .037), pulse pressure (r = -0.09, 
p = .045), and being a grandparent (r = -0.17, p = .0001). TL was significantly 
associated with age (β = -0.003; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.005, -0.003). 
TL was significantly associated in unadjusted multivariate analyses with 
mortality, but the relationship between TL and mortality was attenuated after 
adjusting for age (odds ratio [OR] = 0.19; 95% CI = 0.03, 1.27) and other 
covariates (OR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.02, 1.19). Our study is the first analysis of 
TL in an older adult South African population. Our results corroborate existing 
relationships between TL and age, sex, cardiometabolic disease, and mortality 
found in higher-income countries.

Renal involvement is a common occurrence in subjects with systemic autoimmune 
diseases. The renal manifestation and its severity depend on the underlying 
condition and may reversely complicate the clinical course of autoimmune 
diseases. Renal function markers have been widely used in the assessment of 
normal functioning of kidneys including glomerular filtration rate and 
concentrating and diluting capacity of the kidney. An increase or decrease in 
the values of these markers may indicate kidney dysfunction. In this study, a 
number of critical renal markers were examined in seropositive autoimmune 
diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), connective tissue 
disorder (CTD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The data from three cohorts of 
subjects enrolled in renal markers and autoimmune antibody testing between 
January 2015 to August 2019 were retrospectively studied. The prevalence of 
renal markers that were out of the reference range and their average levels in 
female and male subgroups across SLE, CTD, and RA cohorts were compared and 
analyzed. The levels of renal markers are significantly affected by the presence 
of autoantibodies, in particular eGFR, cystatin C, and albumin. Autoantibodies 
were also more frequent in subjects with severe renal function damage. Close 
follow-up of both renal markers and autoantibodies may potentially assist in the 
early diagnosis of kidney diseases and improve the survival and life expectancy 
of autoimmune patients.

The immune system eliminates pathogen intruders such as viruses and bacteria. To 
recruit immune effectors to virus-infected cells, we conjugated a small 
molecule, the influenza neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, to a nanobody that 
recognizes the kappa light chains of mouse immunoglobulins. This adduct was 
designed to achieve half-life extension of zanamivir through complex formation 
with the much-larger immunoglobulins in the circulation. The zanamivir moiety 
targets the adduct to virus-infected cells, whereas the anti-kappa component 
simultaneously delivers polyclonal immunoglobulins of indeterminate specificity 
and all isotypes. Activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity 
and complement-dependent cytotoxicity promoted elimination of influenza 
neuraminidase-positive cells. A single dose of the conjugate protected mice 
against influenza A or B viruses and was effective even when given several days 
after infection with a lethal dose of virus. In the absence of circulating 
immunoglobulins, we observed no in vivo protection from the adduct. The type of 
conjugates described here may thus find application for both anti-influenza 
prophylaxis and therapy.

An edible food packaging gelatin/zein nanofiber film co-loaded with 
cinnamaldehyde (CA)/thymol (THY) was developed, which possessed outstanding 
features conducive to strawberries preservation. Firstly, the synergistic 
antibacterial behavior of CA and THY was investigated. Then CA and THY were 
co-loaded into gelatin/zein nanofiber films by electrospinning technology. The 
addition of CA and THY increased water contact angle to 85.1° after 10 s and 
decreased the water vapor transmission rate of 3.1×10-8 g·mm-1·h-1·Pa-1. The 
tensile strength was 1.30 MPa and the elongation at break was 185%. The 
nanofiber films exhibited good shielding effect of ultraviolet-visible light and 
excellent antioxidant capacity with DPPH free radical scavenging percentage of 
99.9% in 4 h. The nanofiber films (12.5 mg/mL) could achieve significant 
inhibition effects on Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 with the bacteriostatic ratio 
of 67.5%, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115 
with the antibacterial ratios of 100%. A real-time study on the nanofiber films 
as fruit packaging materials was carried out on strawberries and the packaged 
strawberries kept their freshness as long as 7 days at room temperature. 
Therefore, the GZ/CT nanofiber film prepared in this work has good application 
potential in the field of fruit packaging.

BACKGROUND: Climate change plays a significant role in global health threats, 
particularly with respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) and asthma, but the long-term global-scale impact of climate 
change on these diseases' mortality remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the impact of climate change on the 
age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) of COPD and asthma at national levels.
METHODS: We used Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data of ASMR of COPD and asthma 
from 2000 to 2018. The climate change index was represented as the deviance 
percentage of temperature (DPT) and relative humidity (DPRH), calculated based 
on 19-year temperature and humidity averages. Annual temperature, RH, and fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in 185 countries/regions were obtained from 
ERA5 and the OECD's environmental statistics database. General linear 
mixed-effect regression models were used to examine the associations between 
climate change with the log of ASMR (LASMR) of COPD and asthma.
RESULTS: After adjusting for annual PM2.5, SDI level, smoking prevalence, and 
geographical regions, a 0.26% increase in DPT was associated with decreases of 
0.016, 0.017, and 0.014 per 100,000 people in LASMR of COPD and 0.042, 0.046, 
and 0.040 per 100,000 people in LASMR of asthma for both genders, males, and 
females. A 2.68% increase in DPRH was associated with increases of 0.009 and 
0.011 per 100,000 people in LASMR of COPD. We observed a negative association of 
DPT with LASMR for COPD in countries/regions with temperatures ranging from 3.8 
to 29.9 °C and with LASMR for asthma ranging from -5.3-29.9 °C. However, we 
observed a positive association of DPRH with LASMR for both COPD and asthma in 
the RH range of 41.2-67.2%.
CONCLUSION: Climate change adaptation and mitigation could be crucial in 
reducing the associated COPD and asthma mortality rates, particularly in regions 
most vulnerable to temperature and humidity fluctuations.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Despite advances in treatment, cardiovascular 
disease is the second leading cause of death in Spain. The objective of this 
study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of the CNIC-Polypill strategy 
(acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg, atorvastatin 20/40 mg, ramipril 2.5/5/10 mg) 
compared with the same separate monocomponents for the secondary prevention of 
recurrent cardiovascular events in adults in Spain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov cost-utility model was adapted considering 4 
health states (stable, subsequent major adverse cardiovascular event, subsequent 
ischemic stroke and death) and the SMART risk equation over a lifetime horizon 
from the perspective of the Spanish National Healthcare System. The 
CNIC-Polypill strategy was compared with monocomponents in a hypothetical cohort 
of 1000 secondary prevention patients. Effectiveness, epidemiological, cost and 
utilities data were obtained from the NEPTUNO study, official databases and 
literature. Outcomes were costs (in 2021 euros) per life-year (LY) and 
quality-adjusted LY (QALY) gained. A 3% discount rate was applied. Deterministic 
one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated the robustness of the 
model.
RESULTS: The CNIC-Polypill strategy in secondary prevention results in more LY 
(13.22) and QALY (11.64) gains at a lower cost than monocomponents. The 
CNIC-Polypill is dominant and saves є280.68 per patient compared with 
monocomponents. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows that 82.4% of the 
simulations are below the threshold of є25,000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: The CNIC-Polypill strategy in secondary cardiovascular prevention 
is cost-effective compared with the same separate monocomponents, resulting in a 
cost-saving strategy to the Spanish National Healthcare System.

OBJECTIVE: To establish a consensus for initial evaluation and follow-up of 
patients on active surveillance (AS) for T1 renal masses (T1RM).
METHODS: A modified Delphi method was used to gather information about AS of 
T1RM, with a focus on patient selection, timing/type of imaging modality, and 
triggers for intervention. A consensus panel of Michigan Urological Surgery 
Improvement Collaborative-affiliated urologists who routinely manage renal 
masses was formed. Areas of consensus (defined >80% agreement) about T1RM AS 
were established iteratively via 3 rounds of online questionnaires.
RESULTS: Twenty-six Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative 
urologists formed the panel. Consensus was achieved for 321/587 scenarios 
(54.7%) administered through 124 questions. Life expectancy, age, comorbidity, 
and renal function were most important for patient selection, with life 
expectancy ranking first. All tumors <3 cm and all patients with life expectancy 
<1 year were considered appropriate for AS. Appropriateness also increased with 
elevated perioperative risk, increasing tumor complexity, and/or declining renal 
function. Consensus was for multiphasic axial imaging initially (contrast CT for 
GFR >60 or MRI for GFR >30) with first repeat imaging at 3-6 months and 
subsequent imaging timing determined by tumor size. Consensus was for chest 
imaging for tumors >3 cm initially and >5 cm at follow up. Renal biopsy was not 
felt to be a requirement for entering AS, but useful in several scenarios. 
Consensus indicated rapid tumor growth as an appropriate trigger for 
intervention.
CONCLUSION: Our consensus panel was able to achieve areas of consensus to help 
define a clinically useful and specific roadmap for AS of T1RM and areas for 
further discussion where consensus was not achieved.

OBJECTIVE: The natural history of endovenous glue-induced thrombus (EGIT) 
resolution and the role of anticoagulation (AC) and/or anti-platelet (AP) agents 
in their management is currently ill-defined. The goal of this investigation is 
to determine the clinical behavior of EGITs and whether or not AC or AP affects 
treatment outcomes.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all endovenous ablations 
utilizing cyanoacrylate glue (CAG) from January 2020 to December 2021 at the 
Center for Vein Restoration. Patients were divided into two groups: (1) patients 
who developed an EGIT (EGIT/CAG) and (2) patients treated with CAG and no EGIT 
development (CAG). Demographics, medical/surgical histories, revised Venous 
Clinical Severity Score (rVCSS), Chronic Venous Insufficiency Quality of Life 
Questionnaire (CIVIQ), CEAP, EGIT category, type of anticoagulation, resolution 
time, location of any deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were analyzed, catheter tip 
distance, treatment length and proximal thigh diameters were all analyzed. EGITs 
were categorized as follows: EGIT 1: thrombus extension into the deep vein 
covering less than 25% of the luminal area; EGIT 2: thrombus between 25% and 
49%; EGIT 3: thrombus between 50% and 74%; and EGIT 4: total occlusion. Our 
protocol is to perform post-procedure duplex scans within 3 to 7 days after 
endovenous ablations to assess for post-intervention DVTs.
RESULTS: During the study period, 2374 patients received 4321 CAG procedures. 
EGITs were observed in 133 patients (3.1%): EGIT 1 (n = 57); EGIT 2 (n = 35); 
EGIT 3 (n = 19); and EGIT 4 (n = 22). All EGITs were identified by surveillance 
scanning. No patient presented with limb or pulmonary symptoms suggestive of 
VTE. The average age, rVCSS, and CIVIQ 20 of the entire cohort was 65.3 ± 14.2 
years, 8.2 ± 2.8, and 48 ± 18.3, respectively with 89 females and 44 males. For 
EGIT 1, 56 of 57 (98%) resolved at 4.2 ± 5.1 weeks, with one patient lost to 
follow-up. AC/AP regimen included two aspirin (ASA), one Eliquis, 5 Xarelto, and 
nothing in 49 patients (86%). For EGIT 2, 27 of 35 (77%) resolved at 4.4 ± 
3.4 weeks, one was unresolved, six regressed to EGIT 1, and one remained an EGIT 
2 at the last follow-up examination. AC/AP regimens included seven ASA, three 
Eliquis, three Xarelto, one Coumadin, and nothing in 21 patients (60%). For EGIT 
3, 12 were in the common femoral vein (CFV), three in the popliteal vein (POPV), 
one in the external iliac vein, and three in the gastrocnemius veins. Nine of 
nineteen (47%) resolved at 6 ± 5.9 weeks, four regressed, one migrated to the 
proximal CFV, three became chronic, and two were lost to follow-up. AC/AP 
regimens included three ASA, three Eliquis, seven Xarelto, and nothing in six 
patients (32%). AC/AP compared with no AC/AP had no effect on clot resolution 
(P = .3). Of the 22 EGIT 4, one was in the CFV, two were in the POPV, and 18 
(82%) were remote calf vein DVTs (15 gastrocnemius, one peroneal [PV], and three 
posterior tibial veins [PTVs]). The CFV EGIT became chronic, one POPV resolved, 
and one was lost to follow-up. For the gastrocnemius clots, five became chronic, 
eight resolved, and two were lost to follow-up. For the PTV clots, one resolved, 
one became chronic, and one was lost to follow-up. The PV clot became chronic. 
AC/AP regimen included four ASA, five Eliquis, six Xarelto, and nothing in seven 
patients. AC/AP compared with no AC/AP had no effect on clot resolution (P = 
.9). The average proximal thigh diameter (millimeters, mm), vein length treated 
(mm), and catheter distance (mm) from the junction were the following: EGIT 1 
(5.9 ± 2.4, 37.5 ± 17.6, and 5.2 ± 1), EGIT 2 (5.9 ± 1.7, 38 ± 16.9, 4.79 ± 
0.71), EGIT 3 (5.1 ± 2.6, 27.9 ± 16.6, and 5.26 ± 1.4), and EGIT 4 (5 ± 1.7, 
29.9 ± 15.8, and 5.39 ± 2.18), respectively. Treatment length alone was 
significantly shorter in EGIT 3 and 4, compared with EGIT 1 and 2 (P ≤ .05). 
Catheter distance from the junction was longer in EGIT 1, 3, and 4 patients 
compared with CAG patients (P ≤ .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of EGIT class or severity, the majority of EGITs are not 
associated with clot extension or migration and tend to resolve or regress. For 
EGIT class 1 and 2 patients, AC or AP therapy is not necessary, as 86% and 60%, 
respectively, resolved with observation alone by 4 weeks. For EGIT 3, 68% 
resolved or regressed regardless of AC or AP use. The majority of EGIT 4 were 
remote calf vein DVTs. EGIT 3 and 4 associated with the saphenofemoral/popliteal 
junction are rare. When compared with CAG patients, proximal thigh diameters and 
treatment lengths were larger and longer in EGIT 1 and 2 patients. Catheter 
proximity to the junction was not associated with a higher incidence of EGIT 
formation.

BACKGROUND: To analyze the risk factors for synchronous bone metastases (BM) in 
patients with tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas.
METHODS: Tonsillar carcinomas patients were extracted from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database between 2010 and 2013. We examined 
the association between risk factors and synchronous BM using Chi-squared tests. 
Predictors of survival rates were assessed using univariate and multivariate 
analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 5752 patients were analyzed, which including 35 patients 
(0.6%) with synchronous BM, and 5717 patients without synchronous BM (99.4%). 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that Caucasian, lower T or N 
classification were associated with a significantly lower risk of BM (P < 0.05, 
respectively). Elderly not married non-Caucasian patients with highly 
differentiated disease, higher T or N classification, multiple sites of 
metastases and no surgical therapy to primary tumor were more likely to reduce 
life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: By analyzing data from a large cohort, Caucasian, lower T or N 
classification were associated with a significantly lower risk of BM. Elderly 
not married non-Caucasian patients with highly differentiated disease, higher T 
or N classification, multiple sites of metastases and no surgical therapy to 
primary tumor were more likely to reduce life expectancy. More accurate 
assessments of BM will be imperative for early diagnosis and treatment in 
non-Caucasian tonsillar carcinoma patients who harbored with higher T or N 
classification.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore the prevalence and temporal trends of the burden of 
kidney dysfunction (KD) in global, regional and national level, since a lack of 
related studies.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
MATERIALS: The data of this research was obtained from Global Burden of Diseases 
Study 2019. The estimation of the prevalence, which was measured by the summary 
exposure value (SEV), and attributable burden of KD was performed by DisMod-MR 
2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. The Spearman rank order correlation method 
was adopted to perform correlation analysis. The temporal trends were 
represented by the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC).
RESULTS: In 2019, there were total 3.16 million deaths and 76.5 million 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to KD, increased by 101.1% 
and 81.7% compared with that in 1990, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, the 
prevalence of KD has increased in worldwide, but decreased in High-income Asia 
Pacific. Nearly 48.5% of countries globally, such as South Africa, Egypt and 
Mexico had increased mortality rates of KD from 1990 to 2019 while 44.6% for 
disability rate. Countries with lower socio-demographic index (SDI) are facing a 
higher prevalence as well as mortality and disability rate compared with those 
with higher SDI. Compared with females, the prevalence of KD was lower in males, 
however the attributable mortality and disability rate were higher in all years 
from 1990 to 2019.
CONCLUSION: With the progress of senescent, we will face more severe challenges 
of reducing the prevalence and attributable burden of KD, especially in regions 
with lower SDI. Effective measures are urgently required to alleviate the 
prevalence and burden of KD.

Transitional and aftercare needs of persons recovering from COVID-19 using the 
Omaha System: A Scoping Review.

AIM: To identify and classify the transitional and aftercare needs of persons 
hospitalised with and recovering from COVID-19.
BACKGROUND: Several studies exist that describe the patient needs at the acute 
phase of COVID-19. The transitional and aftercare needs that emerge during 
recovery, however, remain vague.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted and reported according to the PRISMA 
extension guidelines for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Primary studies were 
identified from database search. Narrative synthesis was undertaken, with the 
Omaha System as a framework.
RESULTS: Forty studies were included. Persons recovering from the infection may 
have several needs in all domains of the Omaha System. Although the severity and 
persistence of the needs may be unrelated to the severity of the initial 
infection, they may vary based on factors such as age and pre-morbid factors.
CONCLUSION: Recovering from COVID-19 is associated with varied 
biopsychosocial-environmental needs which can adversely affect the 
quality-of-life experience. The review findings represent an inventory of needs 
that can guide the development of multi-disciplinary post-acute or aftercare 
programmes.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Recovering from COVID-19 can be a protracted 
process requiring ongoing professional support after discharge. Policies are 
required to support the development and implementation of post-acute programmes 
of care. Comprehensive transitional and aftercare rehabilitative programmes are 
needed to support the recovery process.

Calorie restriction (CR) typically promotes a reduction in body mass, which 
correlates with increased lifespan. We evaluated the overall changes in 
survival, body mass dynamics, and body composition following long-term graded CR 
(580 days/19 months) in male C57BL/6J mice. Control mice (0% restriction) were 
fed ad libitum in the dark phase only (12-hour ad libitum [12AL]). CR groups 
were restricted by 10%-40% of their baseline food intake (10CR, 20CR, 30CR, and 
40CR). Body mass was recorded daily, and body composition was measured at 8 time 
points. At 728 days/24 months, all surviving mice were culled. A gradation in 
survival rate over the CR groups was found. The pattern of body mass loss 
differed over the graded CR groups. Whereas the lower CR groups rapidly resumed 
an energy balance with no significant loss of fat or fat-free mass, changes in 
the 30 and 40CR groups were attributed to higher fat-free mass loss and 
protection of fat mass. Day-to-day changes in body mass were less variable under 
CR than for the 12AL group. There was no indication that body mass was 
influenced by external factors. Partial autocorrelation analysis examined the 
relationship between daily changes in body masses. A negative correlation 
between mass on Day 0 and Day +1 declined with age in the 12AL but not the CR 
groups. A reduction in the correlation with age suggested body mass homeostasis 
is a marker of aging that declines at the end of life and is protected by CR.

PURPOSE: Brain metastases rarely complicate the natural history of patients with 
adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). No information is available regarding the life 
expectancy and efficacy of treatments in ACC patients with brain involvement.
METHODS: A pooled analysis was performed by searching on PubMed and using the 
keywords: "brain metastases in adrenocortical carcinoma", and "leptomeningeal 
metastases in adrenocortical carcinoma". Four patients diagnosed at Spedali 
Civili Hospital in Brescia were added to the analysis. Data concerning 
demographic, disease characteristics, adopted treatments and patient prognosis 
were collected.
RESULTS: A total of 27 patients (18 adults and 9 children) were included in this 
study, 22 of them had an adequate follow-up. Brain metastases occurred late in 
the natural history of adult patients but not in that of children. Surgery 
plus/minus radiation therapy was the treatment of choice. Adult patients with 
brain metastases had a poor prognosis with a median progression-free survival 
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) of 2 and 7 months, respectively. Median PFS and 
OS were not attained in children.
CONCLUSION: Brain metastases in ACC patients are rare and are associated with 
poor prognosis, particularly in adults. Surgery plus/minus radiotherapy is the 
only therapeutic approach that can offer patients a chance to obtain durable 
local disease control.

Ageing is characterized by the progressive loss of cellular homeostasis, leading 
to an overall decline of the organism's fitness. In the brain, ageing is highly 
associated with cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. With the rise 
in life expectancy, characterizing the brain ageing process becomes fundamental 
for developing therapeutic interventions against the increased incidence of 
age-related neurodegenerative diseases and to aim for an increase in human life 
span and, more importantly, health span. In this review, we start by introducing 
the molecular/cellular hallmarks associated with brain ageing and their impact 
on brain cell populations. Subsequently, we assess emerging evidence on how 
systemic ageing translates into brain ageing. Finally, we revisit the mainstream 
and the novel rejuvenating strategies, discussing the most successful ones in 
delaying brain ageing and related diseases.

Vermicomposting is a promising method for corn stover management to achieve 
bioresource recovery and environmental protection. Most β-glucosidases, which 
limit the cellulose degradation rate during vermicomposting of corn stover, 
belong to glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1). This study was conducted with 
different earthworm densities to quantify the GH1 gene abundance and investigate 
the evolution of GH1 cellulase-producing microbial communities using qPCR and 
pyrosequencing. The results showed that β-glucosidase activity, GH1 gene 
abundance, TOC, and microbial communities carrying the GH1 gene were affected by 
processing time and earthworm density. After introducing earthworms, 
β-glucosidase activity increased to 1.90-2.13 U/g from 0.54 U/g. The GH1 gene 
abundance of treatments with earthworms (5.82E+09-6.70E+09 copies/g) was 
significantly higher than that of treatments without earthworms (2.48E+09 
copies/g) on Day 45. Earthworms increased the richness of microbial communities. 
The relative abundances of Sphingobium and Dyadobacter, which are dominant 
genera harboring the GH1 gene, were increased by earthworms to peak values of 
23.90% and 11.20%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that Sphingobium, 
Dyadobacter, Trichoderma, and Starkeya were positively associated with
