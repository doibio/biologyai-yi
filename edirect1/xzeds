2012 and/or 2013 to 2017 were included. Estimates of life expectancy at birth, 
standardised mortality ratios and causes of death were obtained for each cohort 
according to diagnosis and gender. Comparisons were made between cohorts and 
with the general population using data obtained from the UK Office of National 
Statistics.
RESULTS: In total, 26 005 patients were included. In men, life expectancy was 
greater in 2013-2017 (64.9 years; 95% CI 63.6-66.3) than in 2008-2012 (63.2 
years; 95% CI 61.5-64.9). Similarly, in women, life expectancy was greater in 
2013-2017 (69.1 years; 95% CI 67.5-70.7) than in 2008-2012 (68.1 years; 95% CI 
66.2-69.9). The difference with general population life expectancy fell by 0.9 
years between cohorts in men, and 0.5 years in women. In the 2013-2017 cohorts, 
cancer accounted for a similar proportion of deaths as cardiovascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Relative to the general population, life expectancy for people with 
SMI is still much worse, though it appears to be improving. The increased 
cancer-related mortality suggests that physical health monitoring should 
consider including cancer as well.

BACKGROUND: A tubeless, on-body automated insulin delivery (AID) system (Omnipod 
5 Automated Insulin Delivery System) demonstrated improved glycated hemoglobin 
A1c levels and increased time in range (70 mg/dL to 180 mg/dL) for both adults 
and children with type 1 diabetes in a 13-week multicenter, single-arm study. 
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the tubeless AID system compared 
with standard of care (SoC) in the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the 
United States. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted from a US 
payer's perspective, using the IQVIA Core Diabetes Model (version 9.5), with a 
time horizon of 60 years and an annual discount of 3.0% on both costs and 
effects. Simulated patients received either tubeless AID or SoC, the latter 
being defined as either continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (86% of 
patients) or multiple daily injections. Two cohorts (children: <18 years; 
adults: ≥18 years) of patients with T1D and 2 thresholds for nonsevere 
hypoglycemia (nonsevere hypoglycemia event [NSHE] <54 mg/dL and <70 mg/dL) were 
considered. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects of different 
risk factors for tubeless AID were sourced from the clinical trial. Utilities 
and cost of diabetes-related complications were obtained from published sources. 
Treatment costs were derived from US national database sources. Scenario 
analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the 
robustness of the results. RESULTS: Treating children with T1D with tubeless 
AID, considering an NSHE threshold of less than 54 mg/dL, brings incremental 
life-years (1.375) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (1.521) at an 
incremental cost of $15,099 compared with SoC, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $9,927 per QALY gained. Similar results were 
obtained for adults with T1D assuming an NSHE threshold of less than 54 mg/dL 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $10,310 per QALY gained). Furthermore, 
tubeless AID is a dominant treatment option for children and adults with T1D 
assuming an NSHE threshold of less than 70 mg/dL compared with SoC. The 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses results showed that compared with SoC, in 
both children and adults with T1D, tubeless AID was cost-effective in more than 
90% of simulations, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY 
gained. The key drivers of the model were the cost of ketoacidosis, duration of 
treatment effect, threshold of NSHE, and definition of severe hypoglycemia. 
CONCLUSIONS: The current analyses suggest that the tubeless AID system can be 
considered a cost-effective treatment compared with SoC in people with T1D from 
a US payer's perspective. DISCLOSURES: This research was funded by Insulet. Mr

PURPOSE: The health impact and cost-effectiveness of the biomarker test 
SelectMDx were evaluated when used in combination with MRI, in two US 
populations: biopsy naïve men and men with a previous negative biopsy.
METHODS: Using a decision model, the current MRI strategy was compared with two 
SelectMDx strategies: SelectMDx used before MRI to select men for MRI and 
SelectMDx used after a negative MRI to select men for biopsy. Parameters were 
informed by the literature most relevant for both populations. Differences in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs between the current strategy and 
the SelectMDx strategies were calculated using two different assumptions 
regarding PCa-specific mortality (SPCG-4 and PIVOT).
RESULTS: In biopsy naïve men, the use of SelectMDx before MRI results in a gain 
of 0.004 QALY per patient under the SPCG-4 scenario, and a gain of 0.030 QALY 
under the PIVOT scenario. The cost savings are $1650 per patient. When used 
after MRI, SelectMDx results in a QALY gain per patient of 0.004 (SPCG-4), and 
0.006 (PIVOT) with $262 in cost savings. In the previous negative population, 
SelectMDx before MRI results in a QALY gain of 0.006 (SPCG-4) and 0.022 (PIVOT), 
with $1281 in cost savings per patient. SelectMDx after MRI results in a QALY 
gain of 0.003 (SPCG-4) and 0.004 (PIVOT) with $193 in cost savings.
CONCLUSION: Application of SelectMDx results in better health outcomes and cost 
savings. The value of SelectMDx was highest when used before MRI to select 
patients for MRI and subsequent biopsy.

How Much Better is Faster? Value Adjustments for Health-Improvement Sequences.

While the quality-adjusted life-year construct has advantages of simplicity and 
consistency, simplicity requires strong assumptions. In particular, standard 
assumptions result in health-state utility functions that are unrealistically 
linear and separable in risk and duration. Consequently, sequencing of a series 
of health improvements has no effect on the total value of the sequence because 
each increment is assessed independently of previous increments. Utility 
functions in nearly all other areas of applied economics are assumed to be 
nonlinear with diminishing marginal utility so it matters where an improvement 
occurs in a sequence. We construct a conceptual framework that that demonstrates 
how diminishing marginal utility for health improvements could affect 
preferences for different sequence patterns. Using this framework, we derive 
conditions for which the sum of conventional health-state utilities understates, 
overstates, or approximates the sequence-sensitive value of health improvements. 
These patterns suggest the direction and magnitude of possible adjustments to 
conventional value calculations. We provide numerical examples and identify 
recent studies whose results are consistent with the conceptual model.

Pollinator health risks from long-lasting neonicotinoid insecticides like 
imidacloprid has primarily focused on commercially managed, cavity-nesting bees 
in the genera Apis, Bombus, and Osmia. We expand these assessments to include 12 
species of native and non-native crop pollinators of differing levels of body 
size, sociality, and floral specialization. Bees were collected throughout 2016 
and 2017 from flowering blueberry, squash, pumpkin, sunflower and okra in south 
Mississippi, USA. Within 30-60 minutes of capture, bees were installed in 
bioassay cages made from transparent plastic cups and dark amber jars. Bees were 
fed via dental wicks saturated with 27% (1.25 M) sugar syrup containing a 
realistic range of sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid (0, 5, 20, or 100 
ppb) that are often found in nectar. Bees displayed no visible tremors or 
convulsions except for a small sweat bee, Halictus ligatus, and only at 100ppb 
syrup. Imidacloprid shortened the captive longevities of the solitary bees. 
Tolerant bee species lived ~10 to 12 days in the bioassays and included two 
social and one solitary species: Halictus ligatus, Apis mellifera and Ptilothrix 
bombiformis (rose mallow bees), respectively. No other bee species tolerated 
imidacloprid as well as honey bees did, which exhibited no appreciable mortality 
and only modest paralysis across concentration. In contrast, native bees either 
lived shorter lives, experienced longer paralysis, or endured both. Overall, 
longevity decreased with concentration linearly for social bees and non-linearly 
for solitary species. The percentage of a bee's captive lifespan spent paralyzed 
increased logarithmically with concentration for all species, although bumble 
bees suffered longest. Of greatest concern was comparable debilitation of 
agriculturally valuable solitary bees at both low and high sublethal rates of 
imidacloprid.

INTRODUCTION: Despite the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) continuing to 
increase globally, no comprehensive meta-analyses have been conducted 
quantifying premature CVD mortality. This paper reports the protocol for a 
systematic review and meta-analysis to derive updated estimates of premature CVD 
mortality.
METHODS AND EXPECTED OUTPUTS: This review will include the studies that reported 
premature CVD mortality based on standard premature mortality indicators, 
including years of life lost (YLL), age standardized mortality rate (ASMR) or 
standardised mortality ratio (SMR). PUBMED, Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), 
CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) will be 
used as the literature databases. The study selection as well as the evaluation 
of the quality of the included articles will be done independently by two 
reviewers. Pooled estimates of YLL, ASMR, and SMR will be computed by applying 
random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity among selected studies will be 
assessed using the I2 statistic and Q statistic with associated p-values. A 
funnel plot analysis and Egger's test will be conducted to assess the potential 
impact of publication bias. Depending on data availability, we propose to 
conduct subgroup analyses by sex, geographic location, main CVD types, and study 
time. Reporting of our findings will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis will provide a comprehensive synthesis of the 
available evidence on premature CVD mortality, which is a major public health 
concern worldwide. The results of this meta-analysis will have important 
implications for clinical practice and public health policy, providing insights 
into strategies to prevent and manage premature CVD mortality.

BACKGROUND: For Black men of middle-age, the overdose mortality statistics are 
increasingly dire. To better understand the severity of the crisis, we estimated 
the cumulative risk of drug overdose deaths among non-Hispanic Black men in 
mid-life using a period life table approach. We report the chances of Black men 
aged 45 years dying of a drug overdose before age 60.
METHODS: A period life table reflects what would happen to a hypothetical cohort 
if it experienced the prevailing age-specific probabilities of death. In our 
hypothetical cohort, we followed 100,000 non-Hispanic Black men aged 45 years 
for 15 years. All-cause death probabilities were obtained from the National 
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 2021 life table series. Overdose mortality 
rates were obtained from the National Vital Statistics System through the 
Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC WONDER) database. We also constructed a period life 
table for a comparison group of White men.
RESULTS: The life table shows that, for Black men who are 45 years of age in the 
United States, 1 in 52 (nearly 2%) is expected to die of drug overdose before 
reaching age 60, if current mortality rates persist. For White men, the estimate 
is 1 in 91 men (about 1%). The life table also shows that from age 45 to 
59 years, the number of overdose deaths increased in the cohort of Black men but 
decreased in White men.
CONCLUSIONS: This study extends our understanding of the immense loss to Black 
communities from the preventable drug deaths of Black men in middle-age.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Despite medical advances, mortality after 
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains high. Women are often 
underrepresented in trials and registries, limiting knowledge of their 
management and prognosis. It is unknown whether life expectancy in women of all 
ages treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is similar 
to that in a reference population free of the disease. The main objective of 
this study was to determine whether life expectancy in women undergoing PPCI and 
surviving the main event returns to a similar level to that in the general 
population of the same age and region.
METHODS: We included all patients diagnosed with STEMI from January 2014 to 
October 2021. We matched women to a reference population of the same age and 
region from the National Institute of Statistics to determine observed survival, 
expected survival, and excess mortality (EM) using the Ederer II method. We 
repeated the analysis in women aged ≤ 65 and> 65 years.
RESULTS: A total of 2194 patients were recruited, of whom 528 were women 
(23.9%). In women surviving the first 30 days, EM at 1, 5 and 7 years was 1.6% 
(95%CI, 0.3-4), 4.7% (95%CI, 0.3-10.1), and 7.2% (95%CI, 0.5-15.1), 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: EM was reduced in women with STEMI who were treated with PPCI and 
who survived the main event. However, life expectancy remained lower than that 
in a reference population of the same age and region.

Humans age at different rates and families with exceptional longevity provide an 
opportunity to understand why some people age slower than others. Unique 
features exhibited by centenarians include a family history of extended life 
span, compression of morbidity with resultant extension of health span, and 
longevity-associated biomarker profiles. These biomarkers, including 
low-circulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and elevated high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, are associated with functional genotypes 
that are enriched in centenarians, suggesting that they may be causative for 
longevity. While not all genetic discoveries from centenarians have been 
validated, in part due to exceptional life span being a rare phenotype in the 
general population, the APOE2 and FOXO3a genotypes have been confirmed in a 
number of populations with exceptional longevity. However, life span is now 
recognized as a complex trait and genetic research methods to study longevity 
are rapidly extending beyond classical Mendelian genetics to polygenic 
inheritance methodologies. Moreover, newer approaches are suggesting that 
pathways that have been recognized for decades to control life span in animals 
may also regulate life span in humans. These discoveries led to strategic 
development of therapeutics that may delay aging and prolong health span.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, the global epidemiology of inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) has changed rapidly.
AIMS: We described the updated global IBD epidemiology results based on the 2019 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD).
METHODS: We estimated the prevalence rate, death rate, years of life lost 
(YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) from GBD 2019 in 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2019.
RESULTS: The crude prevalence of IBD increased by 47% in 2019 globally. 
Accordingly, the age-standardized prevalence rate showed 19% decrease. The 
age-standardized death rates, YLDs, YLLs, and DALYs of IBD in 2019 decreased 
compared to those in 1990. The annual percentage change in age-standardized 
prevalence rate decreased most in United States and increased in East Asia and 
high-income Asia Pacific from 1990 to 2019. Continents with high socioeconomic 
index (SDI) had higher age-standardized prevalence rates compared to continents 
with low SDI. The 2019 age-standardized prevalence rate of high latitudes was 
higher than that of low latitudes in Asia, Europe, and North America.
CONCLUSION: The observed trends and geographic variations in IBD documented in 
the 2019 GBD study will aid policymakers in policy, research, and investment 
development.

BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the duration of extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and its effect on outcomes. Also, we sought to 
identify hospital mortality predictors and determine when ECMO support began to 
be ineffective.
METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted between 
January 2014 and January 2022. The prolonged ECMO (pECMO) cut-off point was 
accepted as 14 days.
RESULTS: Thirty-one (29.2%) of 106 patients followed up with ECMO had pECMO. The 
mean follow-up period of the patients who underwent pECMO was 22 (range, 15-72) 
days, and the mean age was 75 ± 72 months. According to the results of our 
heterogeneous study population, life expectancy decreased dramatically towards 
the 21st day. Hospital mortality predictors were determined in the logistic 
regression analysis in all ECMO groups in our study as high Pediatric Logistic 
Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) two score, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) 
use, and sepsis. The pECMO mortality was 61.2% and the overall mortality was 
53.0%, with the highest mortality rate in the bridge-to-transplant group (90.9%) 
because of lack of organ donation in our country.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the PELOD two score, presence of sepsis, and use of 
CRRT were found to be in the predictors of in-hospital ECMO mortality model. 
Considering the complications, in the COX regression model analysis, the factors 
affecting the probability of dying in patients followed under ECMO were found to 
be bleeding, thrombosis, and thrombocytopenia.

BACKGROUND: Health inequalities are often assessed in terms of life expectancy 
or health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Few studies combine both aspects into 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) to derive comprehensive estimates of 
lifetime health inequality. Furthermore, little is known about the sensitivity 
of estimated inequalities in QALE to different sources of HRQoL information. 
This study assesses inequalities in QALE by educational attainment in Norway 
using two different measures of HRQoL.
METHODS: We combine full population life tables from Statistics Norway with 
survey data from the Tromsø study, a representative sample of the Norwegian 
population aged ≥ 40. HRQoL is measured using the EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS 
instruments. Life expectancy and QALE at 40 years of age are calculated using 
the Sullivan-Chiang method and are stratified by educational attainment. 
Inequality is measured as the absolute and relative gap between individuals with 
lowest (i.e. primary school) and highest (university degree 4 + years) 
educational attainment.
RESULTS: People with the highest educational attainment can expect to live 
longer lives (men: + 17.9% (95%CI: 16.4 to 19.5%), women: + 13.0% (95%CI: 10.6 
to 15.5%)) and have higher QALE (men: + 22.4% (95%CI: 20.4 to 24.4%), women: 
+ 18.3% (95%CI: 15.2 to 21.6%); measured using EQ-5D-5L) than individuals with 
primary school education. Relative inequality is larger when HRQoL is measured 
using EQ-VAS.
CONCLUSION: Health inequalities by educational attainment become wider when 
measured in QALE rather than LE, and the degree of this widening is larger when 
measuring HRQoL by EQ-VAS than by EQ-5D-5L. We find a sizable educational 
gradient in lifetime health in Norway, one of the most developed and egalitarian 
societies in the world. Our estimates provide a benchmark against which other 
countries can be compared.

Heart failure impacts patients' quality of life and life expectancy and 
significantly affects the daily behaviours and feelings of family caregivers. At 
the end-of-life, the burden for family caregivers depends on their emotional and 
sentimental involvement, as well as social costs.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work is to determine whether and how family 
caregivers' experiences and expectations vary in relation to the places of care 
and teams involved in heart failure management.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted, by screening manuscripts 
dealing with the experience of Family Care Givers' (FCGs) of patients with 
Advanced Heart failure. Methods and results were reported following the PRISMA 
rules. Papers were searched through three databases (PubMed, Scopus and Web of 
Science). Seven topics were used to synthetize results by reporting qualitative 
information and quantitative evidence about the experience of FCGs in places of 
care and with care teams.
RESULTS: Thirty-one papers, dealing with the experience of 814 FCGs, were 
selected for this systematic review. Most manuscripts came from the USA (N = 14) 
and European countries (N = 13) and were based on qualitative methods. The most 
common care setting and provider profile combination at the end of life was home 
care (N = 22) and multiprofessional teams (N = 27). Family caregivers 
experienced "psychological issues" (48.4%), impact of patients' condition on 
their life (38,7%) and "worries for the future" (22.6%). Usually, when family 
caregivers were unprepared for the future, the care setting was the home, and 
there was a lack of palliative physicians on the team.
DISCUSSION: At the end-of-life, the major needs of chronic patients and their 
relatives are not health related. And, as we observed, non-health needs can be 
satisfied by improving some key components of the care management process that 
could be related to care team and setting of care. Our findings can support the 
design of new policies and strategies.

Consistent valuation of a reduction in mortality risk using values per life, 
life year, and quality-adjusted life year.

The monetary value of a reduction in mortality risk can be accurately 
characterized using the alternative concepts of value per statistical life 
(VSL), value per statistical life year (VSLY), and value per quality-adjusted 
life year (VQALY). Typically, each of these values depends on the age and other 
characteristics of the affected individual; at most one of the values can be 
independent of age. The common practice of valuing a transient or persistent 
risk reduction using a constant VSL, VSLY, or VQALY yields systematic 
differences in the calculated monetary value that depend on the age at which the 
risk reduction begins, its duration, time path, and whether future lives, life 
years, or quality-adjusted life years are discounted. Mutually consistent, 
age-dependent VSL, VSLY, and VQALY are derived and the large differences in 
valuation of illustrative transient and persistent risk reductions that can 
result from assuming age-independent values of each of the three concepts are 
illustrated.

Nanotechnology is a great choice for medical research, and the green synthesis 
approach is a novel and better way to synthesize nanoparticles. Biological 
sources are cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and allow large-scale 
production of nanoparticles. Naturally obtained 3 β-hydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic 
acids reported for neuroprotective and dendritic structure are reported as 
solubility enhancers. Plants are free from toxic substances and act as natural 
capping agents. In this review, the pharmacological properties of ursolic acid 
(UA) and the structural properties of the dendritic structure are discussed. UA 
acid appears to have negligible toxicity and immunogenicity, as well as 
favorable biodistribution, according to the current study, and the dendritic 
structure improves drug solubility, prevents drug degradation, increases 
circulation time, and potentially targets by using different pathways with 
different routes of administration. Nanotechnology is a field in which materials 
are synthesized at the nanoscale. Nanotechnology could be the next frontier of 
humankind's technological advancement. Richard Feynman first used the term 
'Nanotechnology' in his lecture, "There is Plenty of Room at the Bottom," on 
29th December, 1959, and since then, interest has increased in the research on 
nanoparticles. Nanotechnology is capable of helping humanity by solving major 
challenges, particularly in neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), the most prevalent type, which may account for 60-70% of cases. Other 
significant forms of dementia include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy 
bodies (abnormal protein aggregates that form inside nerve cells), and a number 
of illnesses that exacerbate frontotemporal dementia. Dementia is an acquired 
loss of cognition in several cognitive domains that are severe enough to 
interfere with social or professional functioning. However, dementia frequently 
co-occurs with other neuropathologies, typically AD with cerebrovascular 
dysfunction. Clinical presentations show that neurodegenerative diseases are 
often incurable because patients permanently lose some neurons. A growing body 
of research suggests that they also advance our knowledge of the processes that 
are probably crucial for maintaining the health and functionality of the brain. 
Serious neurological impairment and neuronal death are the main features of 
neurodegenerative illnesses, which are also extremely crippling ailments. The 
most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders cause cognitive impairment and 
dementia, and as average life expectancy rises globally, their effects become 
more noticeable.

A new understanding of the cognitive reappraisal technique: an extension based 
on the schema theory.

University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.

Cognitive reappraisal is a widely utilized emotion regulation strategy that 
involves altering the personal meaning of an emotional event to enhance 
attention to emotional responses. Despite its common use, individual differences 
in cognitive reappraisal techniques and the spontaneous recovery, renewal, and 
reinstatement of negative responses across varying contexts may limit its 
effectiveness. Furthermore, detached reappraisal could cause distress for 
clients. According to Gross's theory, cognitive reappraisal is an effortless 
process that can occur spontaneously. When guided language triggers cognitive 
reappraisal as an emotion regulation strategy in laboratory or counseling 
settings, clients experience improved emotional states, but this induced 
strategy may not necessarily guide them in regulating emotions in similar future 
situations. Therefore, effectively applying cognitive reappraisal techniques in 
clinical practice to help clients alleviate emotional distress in daily life 
remains a significant concern. Exploring the mechanism of cognitive reappraisal 
reveals that reconstructing stimulus meaning is akin to extinction learning, 
which entails fostering cognitive contingency that the original stimulus 
provoking negative emotions will no longer result in negative outcomes in the 
current context. However, extinction learning is a new learning process rather 
than an elimination process. The activation of new learning relies on the 
presentation of critical cues, with contextual cues often playing a vital role, 
such as a safe laboratory or consulting room environment. We propose a new 
understanding of cognitive reappraisal based on the schema theory and the 
dual-system theory, emphasizing the significance of environmental interaction 
and feedback in constructing new experiences and updating schemata. This 
approach ultimately enriches the schema during training and integrates the new 
schema into long-term memory. Bottom-up behavioral experiences as schema 
enrichment training provide the foundation for top-down regulation to function. 
This method can assist clients in activating more suitable schemata 
probabilistically when encountering stimuli in real life, forming stable 
emotions, and achieving transfer and application across diverse contexts.

BACKGROUND: CRISPR has been increasingly used for plant genetic improvements 
because of its high efficiency and precision. Recently, the authors have 
reported the possibility of homology-directed repair (HDR) using CRISPR/Cas9 
through woody plants such as poplar. HDR often replaces nucleotides with one 
donor DNA template (DDT), including homologous sequences.
METHODS: CRISPR-Cas9 was recruited, and three variables, Agrobacteria inoculator 
concentration, pDDT/pgRNA ratio, and homologous arm length, were designed to 
integrate nptII and 2XCamV 35S into the MKK2 promoter zone.
RESULTS: Here, we showed that recovered poplars on kanamycin-supplemented media 
exhibited enhanced expression of MKK2 affected by the precise integration of 
2XcamV 35S and nptII, improving biochemical and phenotypic properties. Our 
findings confirmed that Agrobacterium inoculator OD600 = 2.5, increased DDT 
numbers during cell division to 4:1 pDDT/pgRNA, and optimized homologous arms 
700 bp caused efficient HDR and increased MKK2 expression.
CONCLUSION: Efficient transformations resulted from optimized variables, 
directly affecting the HDR efficiency through woody plants such as poplar.

BACKGROUND: The small number of existing integrative studies on the global 
distribution and burden of all types of skin and subcutaneous diseases hinders 
relevant comparisons.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the latest distribution, 
epidemiological differences, and factors potentially influencing each skin and 
subcutaneous disease and the policy implications.
METHODS: Data on the skin and subcutaneous diseases were obtained from the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. The incidence, disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs), and deaths due to skin and subcutaneous diseases in 204 countries 
and regions from 1990 to 2019 were analyzed and stratified by sex, age, 
geographical location, and sociodemographic index (SDI). The annual 
age-standardized rate of change in the incidence was obtained to evaluate 
temporal trends.
RESULTS: Of 4,859,267,654 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 
4,680,693,440-5,060,498,767) new skin and subcutaneous disease cases that were 
identified, most were fungal (34.0%) and bacterial (23.0%) skin diseases, which 
accounted for 98,522 (95% UI 75,116-123,949) deaths. The burden of skin and 
subcutaneous diseases measured in DALYs was 42,883,695.48 (95%UI, 
28,626,691.71-63,438,210.22) in 2019, 5.26% of which were years of life lost, 
and 94.74% of which were years lived with disability. The highest number of new 
cases and deaths from skin and subcutaneous diseases was in South Asia. 
Globally, most new cases were in the 0-4-year age group, with skin and 
subcutaneous disease incidence slightly higher in men than in women.
CONCLUSION: Fungal infections are major contributors to skin and subcutaneous 
diseases worldwide. Low-middle SDI states had the highest burden of skin and 
subcutaneous diseases, and this burden has increased globally. Targeted and 
effective management strategies based on the distribution characteristics of 
each country are, thus, required to reduce the burden of skin and subcutaneous 
diseases.

INTRODUCTION: The consistent increase in health expenditures is an integral part 
of health policy. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of health 
expenditures on health outcomes in the OECD countries.
METHOD: We used the system generalized method of moments (GMM) for thirty eight 
OECD countries using panel data from 1996 to 2020.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The findings show that health expenditures have a 
negative impact on infant mortality while positive on life expectancy. The 
results further verify that the income measured as GDP, number of doctors, and 
air pollution has a negative effect on infant mortality, while these variables 
have a positive effect on life expectancy in the studied countries. The outcome 
of the study suggests that health expenditures need to be properly utilized and 
improvements can be made in the health policies to increase the investment in 
health technology. The government should also focus on measures like economic 
and environmental to have long-lasting health outcomes.
