IMPORTANCE: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as a first-line therapy for patients 
with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma has been shown to 
improve overall and progression-free survival compared with standard sorafenib 
treatment. However, because of the high cost of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, 
assessment of its value by considering both efficacy and cost is needed.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab 
vs sorafenib for patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular 
carcinoma from a US payer perspective.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation was performed from 
June through September 2020, with a 6-year investment time period. Hypothetical 
patients were male and female adults 18 years or older who had a diagnosis of 
locally advanced metastatic or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma confirmed 
by histologic or clinical features.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Health care costs (adjusted to 2020 US dollars), 
life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab vs sorafenib 
were examined using a partitioned survival model. One-way deterministic and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to examine model uncertainty. The 
model was also used to estimate price reductions of atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab that would achieve more favorable cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis of a hypothetical sample of 424 patients, 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was associated with an increase of 0.623 
life-years (1.840 vs 1.218 life-years) and 0.484 QALYs (1.412 vs 0.928 QALYs) 
and with an incremental cost of $156 210 per patient compared with sorafenib. 
The ICER was $322 500 per QALY (5th to 95th percentile, $149 364-$683 744 per 
QALY), with 0.6% and 5.1% chance of being cost-effective at willingness-to-pay 
thresholds of $100 000 and $150 000 per QALY, respectively. The ICER never 
decreased below $150 000 per QALY in the 1-way sensitivity analyses. To achieve 
more favorable cost-effectiveness under the thresholds of $150 000 to $100 000 
per QALY, the prices of atezolizumab and bevacizumab would need to be reduced by 
37% to 47%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this economic evaluation, atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab was associated with clinical benefit but was not cost-effective 
compared with sorafenib for first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic 
hepatocellular carcinoma from a US payer perspective. A substantial reduction in 
price for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab would be needed to achieve favorable 
cost-effectiveness for this new therapy.

There are numerous fields of science in which multistate models are used, 
including biomedical research and health economics. In biomedical studies, these 
stochastic continuous-time models are used to describe the time-to-event life 
history of an individual through a flexible framework for longitudinal data. The 
multistate framework can describe more than one possible time-to-event outcome 
for a single individual. The standard estimation quantities in multistate models 
are transition probabilities and transition rates which can be mapped through 
the Kolmogorov-Chapman forward equations from the Bayesian estimation 
perspective. Most multistate models assume the Markov property and time 
homogeneity; however, if these assumptions are violated, an extension to 
non-Markovian and time-varying transition rates is possible. This manuscript 
extends reviews in various types of multistate models, assumptions, methods of 
estimation and data features compatible with fitting multistate models. We 
highlight the contrast between the frequentist (maximum likelihood estimation) 
and the Bayesian estimation approaches in the multistate modeling framework and 
point out where the latter is advantageous. A partially observed and aggregated 
dataset from the Zimbabwe national ART program was used to illustrate the use of 
Kolmogorov-Chapman forward equations. The transition rates from a three-stage 
reversible multistate model based on viral load measurements in WinBUGS were 
reported.

BACKGROUND: The US National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) emphasizes the use of 
technology to facilitate coordination of comprehensive care for people with HIV. 
We examined cost-effectiveness from the health system perspective of 6 health 
information technology (HIT) interventions implemented during 2008 to 2012 in a 
Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Special Projects of National Significance 
(SPNS) Program demonstration project.
METHODS/FINDINGS: HIT interventions were implemented at 6 sites: Bronx, New 
York; Durham, North Carolina; Long Beach, California; New Orleans, Louisiana; 
New York, New York (2 sites); and Paterson, New Jersey. These interventions 
included: (1) use of HIV surveillance data to identify out-of-care individuals; 
(2) extension of access to electronic health records (EHRs) to support service 
providers; (3) use of electronic laboratory ordering and prescribing; and (4) 
development of a patient portal. We employed standard microcosting techniques to 
estimate costs (in 2018 US dollars) associated with intervention implementation. 
Data from a sample of electronic patient records from each demonstration site 
were analyzed to compare prescription of antiretroviral therapy (ART), CD4 cell 
counts, and suppression of viral load, before and after implementation of 
interventions. Markov models were used to estimate additional healthcare costs 
and quality-adjusted life-years saved as a result of each intervention. Overall, 
demonstration site interventions cost $3,913,313 (range = $287,682 to $998,201) 
among 3,110 individuals (range = 258 to 1,181) over 3 years. Changes in the 
proportion of patients prescribed ART ranged from a decrease from 87.0% to 72.7% 
at Site 4 to an increase from 74.6% to 94.2% at Site 6; changes in the 
proportion of patients with 0 to 200 CD4 cells/mm3 ranged from a decrease from 
20.2% to 11.0% in Site 6 to an increase from 16.7% to 30.2% in Site 2; and 
changes in the proportion of patients with undetectable viral load ranged from a 
decrease from 84.6% to 46.0% in Site 1 to an increase from 67.0% to 69.9% in 
Site 5. Four of the 6 interventions-including use of HIV surveillance data to 
identify out-of-care individuals, use of electronic laboratory ordering and 
prescribing, and development of a patient portal-were not only cost-effective 
but also cost saving ($6.87 to $14.91 saved per dollar invested). In contrast, 
the 2 interventions that extended access to EHRs to support service providers 
were not effective and, therefore, not cost-effective. Most interventions 
remained either cost-saving or not cost-effective under all sensitivity analysis 
scenarios. The intervention that used HIV surveillance data to identify 
out-of-care individuals was no longer cost-saving when the effect of HIV on an 
individual's health status was reduced and when the natural progression of HIV 
was increased. The results of this study are limited in that we did not have 
contemporaneous controls for each intervention; thus, we are only able to assess 
sites against themselves at baseline and not against standard of care during the 
same time period.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide additional support for the use of HIT as a 
tool to enhance rapid and effective treatment of HIV to achieve sustained viral 
suppression. HIT has the potential to increase utilization of services, improve 
health outcomes, and reduce subsequent transmission of HIV.

OBJECTIVES: Diabetes is the leading cause of disability-adjusted life years in 
Mexico, and cost-effective care models are needed to address the epidemic. We 
sought to evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of a novel community-based 
model of diabetes care in rural Mexico, compared with usual care.
DESIGN: We performed time-driven activity-based costing to estimate annualised 
costs associated with typical diabetes care in Chiapas, Mexico, as well as a 
novel diabetes care model known as Compañeros En Salud Programa de Enfermedades 
Crónicas (CESPEC). We conducted Markov chain analysis to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of CESPEC compared with usual care from a societal 
perspective. We used patient outcomes from CESPEC in 2016, as well as secondary 
data from existing literature.
SETTING: Rural primary care clinics in Chiapas, Mexico.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults with diabetes.
INTERVENTIONS: CESPEC is a novel, comprehensive, diabetes care model that 
integrates community health workers, provider education, supply chain management 
and active case finding.
OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness of 
CESPEC compared with care as usual, per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained, expressed in 2016 US dollars.
RESULTS: The economic cost of the CESPEC diabetes model was US$144 per patient 
per year, compared with US$125 for diabetes care as usual. However, CESPEC care 
was associated with 0.13 additional years of health-adjusted life expectancy 
compared with usual care and 0.02 additional years in the first 5 years of 
treatment. This translated to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
US$2981 per QALY gained over a patient's lifetime and an ICER of US$10 444 over 
the first 5 years. Findings were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: CESPEC is a cost-effective, community-based model of diabetes care 
for patients in rural Mexico. Given the high prevalence and significant 
morbidity associated with diabetes in Mexico and other countries in Central 
America, this model should be considered for broader scale up and evaluation.

OBJECTIVE: Giant insular tumors are commonly not amenable to complete resection 
and are associated with a high postoperative morbidity rate. Transcortical 
approach and brain mapping techniques allow to identify peri-insular functional 
networks and, with neurophysiological monitoring, to reduce vascular-associated 
insults. Cognitive functions to be mapped are still under debate, and the 
analysis of the functional risk of surgery is currently limited to neurological 
examination. This work aimed to investigate the neurosurgical outcome (extent of 
resection, EOR) and functional impact of giant insular gliomas resection, 
focusing on neuropsychological and Quality of Life (QoL) outcomes.
METHODS: In our retrospective analysis, we included all patients admitted in a 
five-year period with a radiological diagnosis of giant insular glioma. A 
transcortical approach was adopted in all cases. Resections were pursued up to 
functional boundaries defined intraoperatively by brain mapping techniques. We 
examined clinical, radiological, and intra-operative factors possibly affecting 
EOR and postoperative neurological, neuropsychological, and Quality of Life 
(QoL) outcomes.
RESULTS: We finally enrolled 95 patients in the analysis. Mean EOR was 92.3%. A 
Gross Total Resection (GTR) was obtained in 70 cases (73.7%). Five patients 
reported permanent morbidity (aphasia in 3, 3.2%, and superior quadrantanopia in 
2, 2.1%). Suboptimal EOR associated with poor seizures control postoperatively. 
Extensive intraoperative mapping (inclusive of cognitive, visual, and haptic 
functions) decreased long-term neurological, neuropsychological, and QoL 
morbidity and increased EOR. Tumor infiltration of deep perforators (vessels 
arising either medial to lenticulostriate arteries through the anterior 
perforated substance or from the anterior choroidal artery) associated with a 
higher chance of postoperative ischemia in consonant areas, with the persistence 
of new-onset motor deficits 1-month post-op, and with minor EOR. Ischemic 
insults in eloquent sites represented the leading factor for long-term 
neurological and neuropsychological morbidity.
CONCLUSION: In giant insular gliomas, the use of a transcortical approach with 
extensive brain mapping under awake anesthesia ensures broad insular exposure 
and extension of the surgical resection preserving patients' functional 
integrity. The relation between tumor mass and deep perforators predicts 
perioperative ischemic insults, the most relevant risk factor for long-term and 
permanent postoperative morbidity.

BACKGROUND: Childhood stunting and malnutrition condemn millions of people 
globally to a life of disadvantage and cognitive and physical impairment. Though 
increasing egg consumption is often seen as an important solution for low and 
middle income countries (including Ethiopia), emerging evidence suggests that 
greater exposure to poultry feces may also inhibit child growth due to the 
effects of enteric bacteria, especially Campylobacter, on gut health.
METHODS: In this rapid ethnographic study, we explored village poultry 
production, child dietary practices, and environmental hygiene conditions as 
they relate to Campylobacter risk and intervention in 16 villages in Haramaya 
Woreda, Eastern Ethiopia.
RESULTS: In the study area, we found that women assumed primary responsibility 
to care for both chickens and children: in feeding, housing, and healthcare. 
Most chickens were free-range local indigenous breeds, and flock sizes were 
small and unstable due to epidemics, seasonal trends, reproductive patterns, and 
lack of food. Generally, eggs were seen as "too luxurious" to be eaten, and were 
predominantly sold at local markets for scarce cash, despite high malnutrition 
rates. Local narratives of extreme poverty, social dietary norms, parental 
fatalism, and lack of "dietary consciousness" (as it was called) were invoked to 
explain this. We found that homesteads were highly contaminated with human and 
animal feces. Although community members viewed chicken feces and poultry 
gastrointestinal contents as particularly noxious in comparison to other animals 
because of their feeding behaviour, they did not relate them to any particular 
disease. Shared human-animal housing and childcare practices place children at 
high risk of exposure to enteric bacteria from animal manure, despite daily 
routines designed to manage the domestic landscape.
CONCLUSIONS: Addressing childhood stunting and malnutrition through egg 
production in rural landscapes like Haramaya must navigate three distinct health 
and care regimes: for children, chickens, and home environments. Interventions 
should be based on a holistic approach to social and economic empowerment, one 
that considers both women and men and integrates nutrition, health, and 
community change as its overarching goal.

OBJECTIVES: Multiple studies showed positive effects of Lutetium-Octreotate (LO) 
treatment in neuroendocrine tumours. LO has been used in the Netherlands since 
the 1980s and recently received the orphan status shortly after the acquisition 
by Novartis. Since then, the official list price has increased sixfold. From a 
value-based pricing perspective, we analysed the impact of the increase in price 
on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of LO treatment compared to 
optimal best supportive care, a high dose of Octreotide long-acting release 
(O-LAR), using the clinical data of the NETTER-1 trial.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the costs per quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) for LO treatment compared to O-LAR from the healthcare 
perspective. A scenario analysis was conducted to compare the cost-effectiveness 
with the initial and increased price level of the LO-treatment.
RESULTS: At the increased price level, the cost-effectiveness analysis rendered 
a deterministic ICER of €53,500 per QALY, while at the initial pricing, the ICER 
was €19,000 per QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) showed that 
LO had a high probability of being cost-effective at both the increased and 
initial price level, considering a cost-effectiveness threshold of €80,000.
CONCLUSIONS: Even at the increased price level, LO treatment can still be 
considered cost-effective using the applicable Dutch willingness-to-pay 
threshold of 80,000 euro per QALY. Considering the public scrutiny in relation 
to this price increase, these outcomes raise the question whether traditional 
cost-effectiveness methods are sufficient in fully capturing the societal 
acceptance of prices of new medicines.

BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients are admitted to intensive care units so they 
can be comprehensively managed and provided with services not covered in general 
hospital wards, with the aim to increase their chances of survival. These 
procedures include invasive mechanical ventilation.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the factors associated with 
survival in critically ill patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation 
in an intensive care unit of a tertiary-level hospital in Colombia.
METHODS: This was a retrospective follow-up study of a cohort of adult patients 
who required invasive mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit in San 
José de Buga Hospital, between 2017 and 2018. Sociodemographic, clinical, and 
pharmacological variables were identified. Using Cox regression, variables 
associated with survival and complications were identified.
RESULTS: A total of 357 patients were analyzed. The average age was 64.8 ± 18.9 
years, and 52.9% were male. The most frequent diagnoses were sepsis/septic shock 
(38.4%) and trauma (17.4%). The main factors associated with shorter survival 
were advanced age (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.96-0.99), a diagnosis of septic shock (HR 
0.29; 95% CI 0.18-0.48) or diabetes mellitus at admission (HR 0.57; 95% CI 
0.33-0.98), a healthcare-associated infection (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.33-0.80), and 
the need for vasopressors (HR 0.36; 95% CI 0.22-0.59). The administration of 
systemic corticosteroids was associated with a higher probability of survival 
(HR 1.93; 95% CI 1.15-3.25).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of systemic corticosteroids was associated with a greater 
probability of survival in critically ill patients who required invasive 
mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit. The identification of the 
variables associated with a higher risk of dying should allow care protocols to 
be improved, thereby extending the life expectancy of these patients.

In this study, the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP7) was used to 
evaluate the transmission of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) contamination in a 
water-sediment system and its flux into cultivated soils. The agricultural areas 
adjacent to the Wu River in Taiwan were taken as the study area, as these soils 
were heavily polluted with Cr(VI) concentrations of 2173-3271 μg/kg. The rates 
of accumulation of Cr(VI) are affected by the distance from the source of 
contamination and the size and type of cultivated areas. The highest 
concentrations of Cr(VI) (4.27 mg/kg) were detected in soil from Changhua city 
and correlated with the greater risk of gastric cancer in residents. 
Specifically, the risk of gastric cancer due to Cr(VI) contamination of 
agricultural soil was 3 × 10-7 - 15.2 × 10-6 in Taichung city (upstream) and 
1.3 × 10-6 - 76.3 × 10-6 in Changhua county (downstream). The values of 
statistical life-years (VSLYs) were US$6.2-10 million for rice, US$42-60 million 
for corn, and US$360-580 million for other vegetables, respectively, each year. 
It is critical that techniques other than source reduction are used to reduce 
human exposure to Cr(VI), such as chemical oxidation or ion-exchange treatment 
to remove Cr(VI) from factory wastewaters, prior to their discharge into rivers. 
PRACTITIONER POINTS: This study evaluated the transmission of hexavalent 
chromium (Cr(VI)) contamination in a water-sediment-soil system. Maximum 
concentrations of Cr(VI) most rapidly accumulated in the smallest cultivated 
areas. The highest concentrations of Cr(VI) (3.3 mg/kg) were correlated with the 
greater risk of gastric cancer. Young children had a threefold greater risk of 
gastric cancer than adults. Techniques other than source reduction are prior to 
their discharge into rivers.

Menopause is the natural process of ageing when women pass from reproductive to 
non -reproductive phase with the cessation of cyclical ovarian functions. After 
menopause women are usually troubled by increasing weight and waist 
circumference caused by obesity and androidal fat redistribution. With the 
increase in life expectancy resulting in women living one half to one third of 
their lives after menopause, the high incidence of overweight and obesity in 
women have become important public health concerns. In postmenopausal women, 
elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) is one of the most significant predictors of 
cardiovascular disease and heart attack risk. In middle aged women, the risk of 
a coronary event rises dramatically after onset of menopause corresponding to 
decreased levels of circulating endogenous estrogens. Both body mass index (BMI) 
and serum CRP are significantly higher among postmenopausal women as compared 
with reproductive aged women. To assess the BMI and serum CRP level changes in 
healthy postmenopausal women in order to compare this parameter with healthy 
reproductive aged women. This comparative study was carried out in the 
Department of Physiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh 
from July, 2018 to June, 2019. Two hundred healthy women (100 female were 
postmenopausal as study group and 100 female were reproductive aged women as 
control group) aged between 25 to 65 years were enrolled in this study. BMI was 
calculated as weight in kilogram divided by the height in meter square. Serum 
CRP by CRP-Latex Test (Slide agglutination procedure). Data were expressed as 
mean±SD and statistical significance of difference among the group was 
calculated by unpaired students' 't' test. The mean value ±SD of BMI and serum 
CRP level was higher in postmenopausal group in comparison to the reproductive 
women group. This study concludes, BMI and Serum C-Reactive protein level 
increased in postmenopausal women.

Diabetes and Frailty: An Expert Consensus Statement on the Management of Older 
Adults with Type 2 Diabetes.

Prognosis and appropriate treatment goals for older adults with diabetes vary 
greatly according to frailty. It is now recognised that changes may be needed to 
diabetes management in some older people. Whilst there is clear guidance on the 
evaluation of frailty and subsequent target setting for people living with 
frailty, there remains a lack of formal guidance for healthcare professionals in 
how to achieve these targets. The management of older adults with type 2 
diabetes is complicated by comorbidities, shortened life expectancy and 
exaggerated consequences of adverse effects from treatment. In particular, older 
adults are more prone to hypoglycaemia and are more vulnerable to its 
consequences, including falls, fractures, hospitalisation, cardiovascular events 
and all-cause mortality. Thus, assessment of frailty should be a routine 
component of a diabetes review for all older adults, and glycaemic targets and 
therapeutic choices should be modified accordingly. Evidence suggests that 
over-treatment of older adults with type 2 diabetes is common, with many having 
had their regimens intensified over preceding years when they were in better 
health, or during more recent acute hospital admissions when their blood glucose 
levels might have been atypically high, and nutritional intake may vary. In 
addition, assistance in taking medications, as often occurs in later life 
following implementation of community care strategies or admittance to a care 
home, may dramatically improve treatment adherence, leading to a fall in 
glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. As a person with diabetes gets older, 
simplification, switching or de-escalation of the therapeutic regimen may be 
necessary, depending on their level of frailty and HbA1c levels. Consideration 
should be given, in particular, to de-escalation of therapies that may induce 
hypoglycaemia, such as sulphonylureas and shorter-acting insulins. We discuss 
the use of available glucose-lowering therapies in older adults and recommend 
simple glycaemic management algorithms according to their level of frailty.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical benefit and compare the cost-effectiveness of 
total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with different personality traits.
METHODS: The present study was retrospectively conducted from January 2017 to 
May 2018. A total of 232 patients between 46 and 71 years old who underwent 
unilateral, primary TKA with the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis were 
interviewed. Three types of data were required to compare the cost-effectiveness 
differences among groups: personality traits, postoperative clinical outcomes 
about health-related quality of life, and costs associated with TKA. Personality 
was assessed using the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, functional outcome was 
assessed through the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis 
Index (WOMAC) questionnaire, and costs were evaluated. Besides, the marginal 
cost-effectiveness ratio (MCER) as the primary outcome, which relates the direct 
costs to the associated patient benefit as assessed by the clinical endpoint 
($/quality-adjusted life years [QALY]), was compared among different personality 
traits. All information for this study was acquired by directly interviewing the 
patients and reviewing the medical computer records at our hospital.
RESULTS: Two hundred and eleven patients completed the final analysis with an 
average of 24.6 months follow-up postoperatively. The choleric group, sanguine 
group, melancholic group, and phlegmatic group has 41, 70, 46, and 54 patients, 
respectively. A statistically significant difference in MECR, QALYs, and 
postoperative WOMAC existed among different personality traits (all P < 0.05). 
There was no significant difference in mean age (P = 0.588), body mass index 
(BMI) (P = 0.790), smoking (P = 0.934), heavy drinking (P = 0.994), chronic 
comorbidities (all P > 0.05), preoperative albumin <3.5 g/dL (P = 0.991), and 
American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score (P = 0.687) among personality 
traits. More women tend to be melancholic in comparison to other personality 
traits (P = 0.016). Melancholic patients attested inferiority of TKA compared 
with other personality traits, who would pay for the same QALYs at the highest 
costs (P < 0.05). By contrast, sanguine patients have a more cost-effective TKA 
than other personality traits, as they pay the least money for the same QALYs (P 
< 0.05). Although phlegmatic and choleric patients seemingly have moderate gains 
from TKA, in general, the extroversion (measured by the extroversion subscale) 
and stability (measured by the neuroticism subscale) displayed more pleasurable 
QALYs in comparison with introversion and instability (P < 0.05). Sensitivity 
analysis showed that the results mentioned above appeared not to be sensitive 
when varying key parameters (prosthesis survival and life expectancy) in a 
one-way sensitivity analysis. Sanguine and melancholic patients still have the 
lowest and highest MCER in comparison with choleric and phlegmatic traits (P 
< 0.05). The multivariate logistic regression showed that RA (adjusted OR = 1.3, 
95% CI = 1.2-1.4, P < 0.01), ASA Class I-II (adjusted OR = 0.9, 95% CI 
= 0.8-1.0, P < 0.001), sanguine (adjusted OR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.7-0.9, P < 0.001) 
and melancholic (adjusted OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1-1.3, P < 0.001) were 
significantly associated with MCER.
CONCLUSIONS: Before surgery, screening the melancholic patients would 
significantly reduce the economic burden, avoid unnecessary suffering, and 
shorten the recovery period.

Republic.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify similar WHO European countries 
in COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate during the first 12 peak weeks of 
pandemic outbreak to find out whether exact coherent parts of Europe were more 
affected than others, and to set relationship between age and higher COVID-19 
mortality rate.
METHODS: COVID-19 cases and deaths from 28 February to 21 May 2020 of 37 WHO 
European countries were aggregated into 12 consecutive weeks. The fuzzy C-means 
clustering was performed to identify similar countries in COVID-19 incidence and 
mortality rate. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and log-log 
linear regression analyses were performed to set up relation between COVID-19 
mortality rate and age. Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test was used to explore 
differences between countries possessing higher mortality rate and age.
RESULTS: Based on the highest value of the coefficient of overall separation 
five clusters of similar countries were identified for incidence rate, mortality 
rate and in total. Analysis according to weeks offered trends where progress of 
COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate was visible. Pearson coefficient (0.69) 
suggested moderately strong connection between mortality rate and age, 
Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test proved statistically significant differences 
between countries experiencing higher mortality rate and age vs. countries 
having both indicators lower (p < 0.001). Log-log linear regression analysis 
defined every increase in life expectancy at birth in total by 1% meant growth 
in mortality rate by 22% (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Spain, Belgium and Ireland, closely followed by Sweden and Great 
Britain were identified as the worst countries in terms of incidence and 
mortality rate in the monitored period. Luxembourg, Belarus and Moldova 
accompanied the group of the worst countries in terms of incidence rate and 
Italy, France and the Netherland in terms of mortality rate. Correlation 
analysis and the Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test proved statistically significant 
positive relationship between mortality rate and age. Log-log linear regression 
analysis proved that higher age accelerated the growth of mortality rate.

BACKGROUND: Total knee replacement (TKR) is often delayed in younger patients in 
an attempt to prolong the longevity of the prosthesis and avoid the risk of 
revision. But delaying a TKR might compromise the quality of life of young 
patients who are otherwise active and healthy.
METHODS: We built a Markov decision model to study the simulated clinical course 
of a 50-year-old patient with severe unilateral knee osteoarthritis who could be 
either treated with conservative therapies or with a TKR at some point in time. 
An Indian healthcare payer perspective model was used, and lifetime costs (in 
Indian rupees), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated.
RESULTS: In the base case scenario, patients who did not receive a TKR had a 
total lifetime cost of ₹216 709 and accumulated 13.59 QALYS in their lifetime. 
Those who received a TKR without delay (at age 50) accumulated 16.71 QALYS in 
their lifetime with an ICER of ₹9789 per QALY. When TKR was delayed, the total 
QALYs decreased, and ICER increased with each year of delay. But the cumulative 
risk of revision decreased from 27.4% when TKR was performed at 50 years to 
10.0% when TKR was done at 70 years.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis found that TKR is a cost-effective procedure when the 
healthcare payer is willing to pay at least ₹9789 ($132) per QALY. The results 
also suggested that an early TKR is preferred to a delayed TKR despite the 
higher incidence of revisions.

Sarcopenia is an age-related loss of skeletal muscle associated with adverse 
outcomes such as falls, fractures, disability, and increased mortality in older 
people and hospitalized patients. About half of older male nursing home 
residents have sarcopenia. The diagnostic criteria by the European Working Group 
on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) and the Asian Working Group for 
Sarcopenia (AWGS) have led to increased interest in sarcopenia. Exercise and 
nutritional management are crucial for the prevention and treatment of 
sarcopenia. Nutritional therapy for sarcopenia that includes 20 g of whey 
protein and 800 IU of vitamin D twice a day improves lower limb strength. 
Exercise therapy for sarcopenia, such as resistance training and 6 months of 
home exercises, improves muscle strength and physical function. Combination 
therapy that includes both nutritional and exercise therapy improves gait speed 
and knee extension strength more than either exercise alone or nutrition therapy 
alone. Excessive bedrest and mismanagement of nutrition in medical facilities 
can lead to iatrogenic sarcopenia. Iatrogenic sarcopenia is sarcopenia caused by 
the activities of health care workers in health care facilities. Appropriate 
nutritional management and exercise programs through rehabilitation nutrition 
are important for prevention and treatment of iatrogenic sarcopenia. Nutritional 
and exercise therapy should be started very early after admission and adjusted 
to the level of inflammation and disease status. Repeated assessment, diagnosis, 
goal setting, interventions, and monitoring using the rehabilitation nutrition 
care process is important to maximize treatment effectiveness and improve 
patients' functional recovery and quality of life.

Brazil.

BACKGROUND: Health equity, although addressed in several publications dealing 
with health efficiency analysis, is not easily translated into the 
operationalization of variables, mainly due to technical difficulties. Some 
studies provide evidence that it does not influence health outcomes; others 
demonstrate that its effect is an indirect one, with the hegemony of material 
living conditions over its social connotation. The aim of this article is to 
evaluate the role of health equity in determining health outcomes, in an 
international comparative analysis of the effectiveness and efficiency of health 
systems.
METHOD: Fixed Effects Model Panel and Data Envelopment Analysis, a dynamic and 
network model, in addition to comparative analysis between methods and health 
impacts. The effect variables considered in the study were life expectancy at 
birth and infant mortality, in 2010 and 2015, according to the sociocultural 
regions of the selected countries. Inequity was assessed both economically and 
socially. The following dimensions were considered: physical and financial 
resources, health production (access, coverage and prevention) and intersectoral 
variables: demographic, socioeconomic, governance and health risks.
RESULTS: Both methods demonstrated that countries with higher inequity levels 
(regarding income, education and health dimensions), associated or not with 
poverty, are the least efficient, not reaching the potential for effective 
health outcomes. The outcome life expectancy at birth exhibited, in the final 
model, the following variables: social inequity and per capita health 
expenditure. The outcome infant mortality comprehended the level of education 
variable, in association with the following healthcare variabels: care seeking 
due to diarrhea in children under five, births attended by skilled health 
professionals and the reduction in the incidence of HIV.
CONCLUSION: The dissociation between the distribution of health outcomes and the 
overall level of health of the population characterizes a devastating political 
choice for society, as it is associated with high levels of segregation, 
disrespect and violence from within. Countries should prioritize health equity, 
adding value to its resources, since health inequties affect society altogether, 
generating mistrust and reduced social cohesion.

BACKGROUND: Research has shown unilateral cochlear implants (CIs) significantly 
improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in adults. However, only 13% of 
eligible Swedish adults currently use a unilateral CI. The objective was to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of unilateral CIs compared to a hearing aid for 
Swedish adults with severe to profound hearing loss.
METHODS: A Markov model with a lifetime horizon and six-month cycle length was 
developed to estimate the benefits and costs of unilateral CIs from the Swedish 
health system perspective. A treatment pathway was developed through 
consultation with clinical experts to estimate resource use and costs. Unit 
costs were derived from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and the 
Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions. Health outcomes were 
reported in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).
RESULTS: Unilateral CIs for Swedish adults with severe to profound hearing loss 
are likely to be deemed cost-effective when compared to a hearing aid (SEK 
140,474 per QALY gained). The results were most sensitive to the age when 
patients are implanted with a CI and the proportion of patients eligible for CIs 
after triage.
CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the prevalence of Swedish adults with severe to 
profound hearing loss is expected as the population ages. Earlier implantation 
of unilateral CIs improves the cost-effectiveness among people eligible for CIs. 
Unilateral CIs are an efficacious and cost-effective option to improve hearing 
and quality of life in Swedish adults with severe to profound hearing loss.

Insomnia comorbid to Parkinson's disease Part II: Therapeutic approaches.

Montpellier, France.

Insomnia is four times more frequent in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) 
than in the general population. In PD, insomnia is associated with a very 
significant decrease in quality of life and has deleterious consequences on both 
patients' and caregivers' health. When insomnia is comorbid to PD, the main 
therapeutic response is the prescription of benzodiazepines or related drugs. As 
in the general population, these sedative-hypnotic molecules have very low 
efficacy in PD and are associated with adverse effects. They are highly 
addictive and are also associated with drowsiness, a risk of falling and 
decreased life expectancy. These side effects may in themselves be symptoms 
associated with PD in the absence of insomnia. In this clinical context, it is 
clear that sedative-hypnotic drugs are likely to potentiate these clinical 
symptoms in PD. We recently documented that insomnia disorder comorbid to PD is 
associated with the classic psychological factors that perpetuate insomnia in 
neurologically disease-free individuals with insomnia. These results enabled us 
to emphasise that target-oriented interventions, such as cognitive-behavioural 
therapy for chronic insomnia (CBT-i), should be considered as a treatment for 
insomnia comorbid to PD. As a reminder, for decades CBT-i has been considered to 
be the most effective first-line treatment for the management of chronic 
insomnia, whether or not it is associated with a comorbidity. In this context,
