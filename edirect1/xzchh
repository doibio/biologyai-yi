RESULTS: The FACIT-Pal 14 has Crohnbach's α of 0.76, which increases to 0.79 if 
2 items are removed. Principal component analysis supports a single latent 
variable underlying the instrument. Significantly lower mean scores were found 
in patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) functional status 3 
to 4 compared with patients with ECOG functional status 1-2 ( P = .007), in 
patients with life expectancy under 6 months compared to those with 6 months or 
greater ( P = .003), and in patients referred to clinic for pain and symptom 
management compared with patients referred for other reasons ( P = .038). 
Instrument scores did not significantly differ between men and women or between 
white and nonwhite patients ( P = .525 and P = .263, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In an outpatient palliative care clinic population, the FACIT-Pal 
14 has good internal consistency, but removal of 2 items would improve 
consistency. One latent variable underlies the instrument and there is evidence 
of construct validity.

Decision Criterion and Value of Information Analysis: Optimal Aspirin Dosage for 
Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events.

BACKGROUND: In value of information (VOI) calculations, such as the expected 
value of perfect information (EVPI), partial perfect information (EVPPI), sample 
information (EVSI) or implementation (EVIM), the maximum expected value 
criterion defines the decision making criterion for the adoption of decisions 
for treatments. However, because decision makers are often risk averse, the 
uncertainty that accompanies a decision problem may influence adoption 
decisions.
METHODS: VOI estimates were studied based on 2 alternate decision making 
criteria: 1) maximum expected value and 2) 95% credible intervals. These 
criteria were applied to a probabilistic minimal lifetime model of incident 
cardiovascular events and mortality among target patients comparing 2 daily 
doses of aspirin (81 mg and 325 mg). Model parameters were based on literature 
reviews and data analyses.
RESULTS: Expected life-years under 81 v. 325 mg of aspirin were estimated to be 
14.86 (SE, 0.10) and 14.72 (0.31) respectively, with a difference of 0.14 
(0.29). The probability that 81 mg was optimal was estimated to be 67%. Under 
Decision Criterion 1, EVIM and EVPI were about 233-thousand and 411-thousand 
years, respectively. Under Criterion 2, EVIM was undefined, as there remains 
ambiguity about what to implement. Consequently, EVPI becomes the entire 
644-thousand years. Also, under Criterion 1, EVSI reaches an asymptote at a 
sample size of 10,000 per arm, with minimal gains in value beyond a 5,000 person 
per arm trial. With Criterion 2, a sample size of 10,000 per arm or higher is 
substantially more valuable than lower sample sizes.
CONCLUSION: Alternative decision criteria for treatment adoption change the VOI. 
Decision criteria should be justified for VOI analyses. If multiple criteria may 
be relevant, analysts should complete VOI estimates using multiple criteria.

BACKGROUND: The aim was to compare health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) and 
cost-effectiveness between cytoreductive surgery with intraperitoneal 
chemotherapy (CRS + IPC) and systemic chemotherapy for patients with colorectal 
peritoneal metastases.
METHODS: Patients included in the Swedish Peritoneal Trial comparing CRS + IPC 
and systemic chemotherapy completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and SF-36 questionnaires 
at baseline, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. HRQOL at 24 months was the primary 
endpoint. EORTC sum score, SF-36 physical and mental component scores at 24 
months were calculated and compared for each arm and then referenced against 
general population values. Two quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) indices were 
applied (EORTC-8D and SF-6D) and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
per QALY gained was calculated. A projected life-time ICER per QALY gained was 
calculated using predicted survival according to Swedish population statistics.
RESULTS: No statistical differences in HRQOL between the arms were noted at 24 
months. Descriptively, survivors in the surgery arm had higher summary scores 
than the general population at 24 months, whereas survivors in the chemotherapy 
arm had lower scores. The projected life-time QALY benefit was 3.8 QALYs in 
favor of the surgery arm (p=0.06) with an ICER per QALY gained at 310,000 SEK 
(EORTC-8D) or 362,000 SEK (SF-6D) corresponding to 26,700-31,200 GBP.
CONCLUSION: The HRQOL in patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases 
undergoing CRS + IPC appear similar to those receiving systemic chemotherapy. 
Two-year survivors in the CRS + IPC arm have comparable HRQOL to a general 
population reference. The treatment is cost-effective according to NICE 
guidelines.

OBJECTIVE: In women with symptomatic endometriosis and no desire for pregnancy, 
hysterectomy with or without bilateral oophorectomy is often presented as a 
definitive solution to their symptoms. Despite this radical treatment, it should 
be known that nearly 15% of these patients will have persistent pain. Thus the 
objective of this review was to determine the interest of total hysterectomy 
with or without bilateral oophorectomy for the treatment of deep endometriosis.
METHOD: The research was conducted from the US National Library of Medicine's 
National Institutes of Health from the following keywords: endometriosis, 
hysterectomy, oophorectomy, ovariectomy, radical treatment. Only articles 
written in English have been selected.
RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Hysterectomy with or without bilateral 
oophorectomy, associated with endometriotic lesions exeresis could decrease the 
rate of recurrence and surgical reoperations compared to resection alone 
endometriosis lesions (NP4). In women with no desire for pregnancy, the 
benefit-risk balance of a hysterectomy, with or without bilateral oophorectomy, 
may be discussed in order to reduce the risk of recurrence of endometriotic 
disease (Expert Agreement). Taking into account the multiple adverse effects of 
early menopause on expectancy and quality of life (NP2), ovarian preservation 
should be discussed with the patient in case of hysterectomy for deep 
endometriosis (Expert Agreement). The use of menopausal hormone therapy (THM) 
does not appear to increase the symptoms of endometriosis after surgical 
castration (NP3). THM is not contraindicated in postmenopausal women with 
endometriosis (grade C).

BACKGROUND: The combination of an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a VEGF pathway 
inhibitor to treat patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma might increase 
the clinical benefit of these drugs compared with their use alone. Here, we 
report preliminary results for the combination of avelumab, an IgG1 monoclonal 
antibody against the programmed cell death protein ligand PD-L1, and axitinib, a 
VEGF receptor inhibitor approved for second-line treatment of advanced 
renal-cell carcinoma, in treatment-naive patients with advanced renal-cell 
carcinoma.
METHODS: The JAVELIN Renal 100 study is an ongoing open-label, multicentre, 
dose-finding, and dose-expansion, phase 1b study, done in 14 centres in the USA, 
UK, and Japan. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (≥20 years in 
Japan) and had histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced renal-cell 
carcinoma with clear-cell component, life expectancy of at least 3 months, an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less, received no 
previous systemic treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma, and had a 
resected primary tumour. Patients enrolled into the dose-finding phase received 
5 mg axitinib orally twice daily for 7 days, followed by combination therapy 
with 10 mg/kg avelumab intravenously every 2 weeks and 5 mg axitinib orally 
twice daily. Based on the pharmacokinetic data from the dose-finding phase, ten 
additional patients were enrolled into the dose-expansion phase and assigned to 
this regimen. The other patients in the dose-expansion phase started taking 
combination therapy directly. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicities 
in the first 4 weeks (two cycles) of treatment with avelumab plus axitinib. 
Safety and antitumour activity analyses were done in all patients who received 
at least one dose of avelumab or axitinib. This trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02493751.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 30, 2015, and Sept 30, 2016, we enrolled six patients into 
the dose-finding phase and 49 into the dose-expansion phase of the study. One 
dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 proteinuria due to axitinib was reported among 
the six patients treated during the dose-finding phase. At the cutoff date 
(April 13, 2017), six (100%, 95% CI 54-100) of six patients in the dose-finding 
phase and 26 (53%, 38-68) of 49 patients in the dose-expansion phase had 
confirmed objective responses (32 [58%, 44-71] of all 55 patients). 32 (58%) of 
55 patients had grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events, the most 
frequent being hypertension in 16 (29%) patients and increased concentrations of 
alanine aminotransferase, amylase, and lipase, and palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome in four (7%) patients each. Six (11%) of 55 
patients died before data cutoff, five (9%) due to disease progression and one 
(2%) due to treatment-related autoimmune myocarditis. At the end of the 
dose-finding phase, the maximum tolerated dose established for the combination 
was avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks and axitinib 5 mg twice daily.
INTERPRETATION: The safety profile of the combination avelumab plus axitinib in 
treatment-naive patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma seemed to be 
manageable and consistent with that of each drug alone, and the preliminary data 
on antitumour activity are encouraging. A phase 3 trial is assessing avelumab 
and axitinib compared with sunitinib monotherapy.

When It's Time to Retire: Notes From the Afterlife.

At the end of the Second World War, the US birth rate peaked at nearly 27 births 
per 1,000 population-a rate unparalleled in the previous 3 decades, and one that 
would not be repeated. That Boomer generation is now retiring. How do those of 
us caught in the wave feel about stepping back? Who will step in to replace us? 
And how will we replace the loss of purpose and fulfillment that comes from a 
career in medicine? A lengthening life expectancy has challenged many of us to 
consider the "second act" to our adult life. This essay describes the emotional 
turbulence of ending one career and contemplating the next.

An analysis of factors related to disability-free life expectancy at 65 years of 
age across Japanese prefectures in 2010.

Compared to the large volume of research focused on mortality differentials 
within Japan, relatively little is known about regional variations in health 
expectancy, particularly among older people. This article has two interrelated 
objectives. The first objective is to estimate prefecture-specific 
disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) at 65 years of age in 2010. DFLE at 65 by 
gender and prefecture was computed using the Sullivan method, which was applied 
to prefecture-specific life tables and prevalence of disability from Kokumin 
Seikatsu Kiso Chosa (Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions) of 2010. The 
second objective is to investigate macro-level factors associated with DFLE at 
65 across 47 Japanese prefectures. Our results indicate regional disparities in 
DFLE at older ages. Importantly, we note close relationships between a 
prefecture's wealth, labor, and welfare characteristics and DFLE at 65. Income 
per capita, the proportion of workers older than 65, and welfare expenditures 
are positively related to DFLE, whereas unemployment and long-term care 
insurance expenditures per-capita are inversely associated with DFLE for both 
genders. The proportion of older adults relying on public assistance is 
negatively related only to women's DFLE. These results suggest that narrowing 
socioeconomic disparities may contribute to the health of Japanese elders. 
Reducing regional health disparities therefore requires policy makers to take 
into account the broader socioeconomic conditions of each prefecture.

This study examined whether economic changes related to the 2008-2009 Recession 
were associated with employment status and job quality indicators among older 
workers in Europe and Israel. Data were derived from 4917 respondents (16,090 
observations both before and after the recession) from 13 countries who 
participated in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. Annual 
data on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, life expectancy, and quarterly 
unemployment rates were assigned to employment assessments from 2004 to 2013. 
Using difference-in-differences models, we assessed the recession's implications 
on individual employment outcomes, while isolating cyclical variation within 
countries and individual changes over time. Among older workers, decreases in 
GDP were associated with an increase in the likelihood of being unemployed and a 
decrease in the likelihood of being retired. An increasing country-level 
unemployment rate had a significant effect on aspects of job quality: lower 
prospects for job advancement, lower job security, and higher job satisfaction. 
Economic recessions are thus negatively associated with employment outcomes for 
older workers. However, malleable policy-related factors such as longer tenure 
and improved general health can limit the negative employment and job quality 
outcomes following a recession.

Subjective remaining lifetime and concreteness of the future as differential 
predictors of preparation for age-related changes.

Demographic changes have been linked to the expectation of cuts in 
government-provided social security services, emphasizing individual 
responsibility to prepare for old age and concomitant challenges and changes. 
Accordingly, the identification of psychological variables predicting 
preparation is a matter of theoretical as well as practical importance. We thus 
consider different aspects of a person's future time as theoretically prominent 
psychological predictors of preparation. The subjectively perceived quantity of 
remaining lifetime, the concreteness of future time, and preparation for life 
domains indicative of an active third age as well as of a more dependent fourth 
age were assessed in a longitudinal study in a core sample of N = 593 
participants (30-80 years old at T1) at two measurement occasions 4 years apart. 
The quantity of subjective remaining lifetime predicted subsequent changes in 
preparation, but this effect was restricted to preparation for the fourth age. 
In contrast, a more open and concrete outlook on ones' personal future predicted 
changes in preparation for an active third age. Our findings highlight the 
importance of distinguishing between different aspects of future time-its 
quantity versus its relation to goals and action plans-when predicting specific 
facets of developmental self-regulation.

Long-Term Costs and Health Consequences of Issuing Shorter Duration 
Prescriptions for Patients with Chronic Health Conditions in the English NHS.

BACKGROUND: The National Health Service (NHS) in England spends over £9 billion 
on prescription medicines dispensed in primary care, of which over two-thirds is 
accounted for by repeat prescriptions. Recently, GPs in England have been urged 
to limit the duration of repeat prescriptions, where clinically appropriate, to 
28 days to reduce wastage and hence contain costs. However, shorter 
prescriptions will increase transaction costs and thus may not be cost saving. 
Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that shorter prescriptions are 
associated with lower adherence, which would be expected to lead to lower 
clinical benefit. The objective of this study is to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of 3-month versus 28-day repeat prescriptions from the 
perspective of the NHS.
METHODS: We adapted three previously developed UK policy-relevant models, 
incorporating transaction (dispensing fees, prescriber time) and drug wastage 
costs associated with 3-month and 28-day prescriptions in three case studies: 
antihypertensive medications for prevention of cardiovascular events; drugs to 
improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes; and treatments for 
depression.
RESULTS: In all cases, 3-month prescriptions were associated with lower costs 
and higher QALYs than 28-day prescriptions. This is driven by assumptions that 
higher adherence leads to improved disease control, lower costs and improved 
QALYs.
CONCLUSION: Longer repeat prescriptions may be cost-effective compared with 
shorter ones. However, the quality of the evidence base on which this modelling 
is based is poor. Any policy rollout should be within the context of a trial 
such as a stepped-wedge cluster design.

BACKGROUND: Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are commonly given to transplant 
recipients of kidneys and other solid organs and to patients with immune 
disorders, such as steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, steroid-dependent 
nephrotic syndrome, and frequent relapse nephrotic syndrome. Although CNIs 
remain the most effective available immunosuppressant agent, there is clinical 
concern regarding possible long-term nephrotoxicity. This concern is especially 
significant in children who have a longer life expectancy and greater growth 
rate.
DATA SOURCES: In this review, we analyzed the literatures to identify original 
articles that examined use of CNIs in children who received organ 
transplantation and nephropathy to assess the available evidence of their 
nephrotoxicity. PubMed, Elsevier, and Tompson ISI Web of Knowledge were searched 
for identifying relevant papers.
RESULTS: Clinical research supports the presence of CNI-related nephrotoxicity. 
However, some researchers have questioned the prevalence and seriousness of 
chronic CNIs nephrotoxicity, especially because the pathological lesions 
typically associated with long-term CNI use are nonspecific. Many researchers 
have focused on early markers of CNI nephrotoxicity, and the methods that may 
help prevent and manage nephrotoxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Future research should focus on investigating early markers of CNI 
nephrotoxicity and strategies for improved immunosuppressant therapy, and 
developing alternative treatments. CNI-mediated nephrotoxicity should always be 
taken seriously in clinic.

describing rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) in adults and children 
in language that can be used in conversations with the lay public, media, 
healthcare providers, and other stakeholders. Based on the literature review, 
several elements were deemed important for inclusion in the description of RMDs. 
First, RMDs encompass many different diseases that can affect individuals at any 
age, including children. Second, there are various pathophysiological pathways 
underlying different RMDs. Third, the impact of RMDs on individuals and society 
should be emphasized. The working group agreed that the language should be 
comprehensible to the lay public. Thus, the following description of RMDs has 
been developed: "Rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) are a diverse 
group of diseases that commonly affect the joints, but can affect any organ of 
the body. There are more than 200 different RMDs, affecting both children and 
adults. They are usually caused by problems of the immune system, inflammation, 
infections, or gradual deterioration of joints, muscles, and bones. Many of 
these diseases are long term and worsen over time. They are typically painful 
and limit function. In severe cases, RMDs can result in significant disability, 
having a major impact on both quality of life and life expectancy." This 
description can be used by rheumatology groups, researchers, and those who work 
in advocacy and education related to RMDs.

BACKGROUND: Self-harm in adolescents is common and repetition rates high. There 
is limited evidence of the effectiveness of interventions to reduce self-harm.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
family therapy (FT) compared with treatment as usual (TAU).
DESIGN: A pragmatic, multicentre, individually randomised controlled trial of FT 
compared with TAU. Participants and therapists were aware of treatment 
allocation; researchers were blind to allocation.
SETTING: Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) across three 
English regions.
PARTICIPANTS: Young people aged 11-17 years who had self-harmed at least twice 
presenting to CAMHS following self-harm.
INTERVENTIONS: Eight hundred and thirty-two participants were randomised to 
manualised FT delivered by trained and supervised family therapists (n = 415) or 
to usual care offered by local CAMHS following self-harm (n = 417).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of repetition of self-harm leading to hospital 
attendance 18 months after randomisation.
RESULTS: Out of 832 young people, 212 (26.6%) experienced a primary outcome 
event: 118 out of 415 (28.4%) randomised to FT and 103 out of 417 (24.7%) 
randomised to TAU. There was no evidence of a statistically significant 
difference in repetition rates between groups (the hazard ratio for FT compared 
with TAU was 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.49; p = 0.3349). FT was not 
found to be cost-effective when compared with TAU in the base case and most 
sensitivity analyses. FT was dominated (less effective and more expensive) in 
the complete case. However, when young people's and caregivers' quality-adjusted 
life-year gains were combined, FT incurred higher costs and resulted in better 
health outcomes than TAU within the National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence cost-effectiveness range. Significant interactions with treatment, 
indicating moderation, were detected for the unemotional subscale on the young 
person-reported Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (p = 0.0104) and the 
affective involvement subscale on the caregiver-reported McMaster Family 
Assessment Device (p = 0.0338). Caregivers and young people in the FT arm 
reported a range of significantly better outcomes on the Strengths and 
Difficulties Questionnaire. Self-reported suicidal ideation was significantly 
lower in the FT arm at 12 months but the same in both groups at 18 months. No 
significant unexpected adverse events or side effects were reported, with 
similar rates of expected adverse events across trial arms.
CONCLUSIONS: For adolescents referred to CAMHS after self-harm, who have 
self-harmed at least once before, FT confers no benefits over TAU in reducing 
self-harm repetition rates. There is some evidence to support the effectiveness 
of FT in reducing self-harm when caregivers reported poor family functioning. 
When the young person themselves reported difficulty expressing emotion, FT did 
not seem as effective as TAU. There was no evidence that FT is cost-effective 
when only the health benefits to participants were considered but there was a 
suggestion that FT may be cost-effective if health benefits to caregivers are 
taken into account. FT had a significant, positive impact on general emotional 
and behavioural problems at 12 and 18 months.
LIMITATIONS: There was significant loss to follow-up for secondary outcomes and 
health economic analyses; the primary outcome misses those who do not attend 
hospital following self-harm; and the numbers receiving formal FT in the TAU arm 
were higher than expected.
FUTURE WORK: Evaluation of interventions targeted at subgroups of those who 
self-harm, longer-term follow-up and methods for evaluating health benefits for 
family groups rather than for individuals.

Dilute lidocaine suppresses ectopic neuropathic discharge in dorsal root ganglia 
without blocking axonal propagation: a new approach to selective pain control.

Ectopic impulse discharge (ectopia) generated in the soma of afferent neurons in 
dorsal root ganglia (DRG) after nerve injury is believed to be a major 
contributor to neuropathic pain. The DRG is thus a prime interventional target. 
The process of electrogenesis (impulse generation) in the DRG is far more 
sensitive to systemically administered Na channel blockers than the process of 
impulse propagation along sensory axons. It should therefore be possible to 
selectively suppress DRG ectopia with local application of membrane-stabilizing 
agents without blocking normal impulse traffic. Results from in vivo 
electrophysiological recordings in rats showed that epidural application of 
lidocaine to the DRG surface within the intervertebral foramen at 0.02% or 0.2% 
substantially suppresses electrogenesis in the DRG with only a modest blocking 
effect on impulse propagation through the foramen. Topically applied opiates and 
gamma aminobutyric acid, by contrast, blocked neither ongoing discharge nor 
spike through-conduction. This suggests that sustained intraforaminal delivery 
of dilute lidocaine, and by extension other membrane-stabilizing agents, is a 
potential new strategy for the control of chronic painful conditions in which 
ectopia in sensory ganglia is implicated as a key pain driver. Such conditions 
include postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, phantom limb pain, complex 
regional pain syndrome, and radicular low back pain.

Prehospital Medicine and the Future Will ECMO Ever Play a Role?

Macku D, Hedvicak P, Quinn JM, Bencko V.

Comment in
    J Spec Oper Med. 2018 Spring;18(1):139-140.

Due to the hybrid warfare currently experienced by multiple NATO coalition and 
NATO partner nations, the tactical combat casualty care (TCCC) paradigm is 
greatly challenged. One of the major challenges to TCCC is the ad hoc extension 
phase in resource-poor environments, referred to as prolonged field care (PFC) 
and forward resuscitative care (FRC). The nuanced clinical skills with limited 
resources required by warfighters and auxiliary health care professionals to 
mitigate death on the battlefield and prevent morbidity and mortality in the PFC 
phase represent a balance that is still under review. The aim of our article is 
to describe the connection between extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or 
the extracorporeal life support (ECLS) treatment and its possible improvement in 
prehospital trauma care, at a Role 1 or 2 facility and, more provocatively, in 
the PFC phase of care in the future through innovative technology and how it 
connects with FRC. We report and describe here the primary components of 
ECMO/ECLS and present the main concept of a human extracorporeal circulation 
cocoon as a transitional living form for the cardiopulmonary stabilization of 
wounded combatants on the battlefield and their transportation to higher 
echelons of care and treatment facilities (to include damage control 
resuscitation [DCR] and damage control surgery [DCS]). As clinical governance, 
these matters would fall within the remit of the Committee on Surgical Combat 
Casualty Care (CoSCCC) and the Committee on Enroute Combat Casualty Care 
(CoERCCC), and it is within this framework that we propose this concept piece of 
ECMO in the prehospital space. We caution that this report is a proposed 
innovation to TCCC but also serves to push the envelope of the PFC and FRC 
paradigm. What we propose will not change the practice this year, but as ECMO 
technology progresses, it may change our practice within the next decade. We 
conclude with proposed novel future research to save life on the battlefield 
with ECMO as a major challenge and one worth the focus of further research. 
Medicine is controversial and constantly changing; for those who work in 
prehospital and battlefield medicine, change is the only constant on which we 
rely, and without provocative discussion that makes our systems and practice 
more robust, we will fail.

INTRODUCTION: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are 
among the most common malignancies in the United States. There are many 
potential management strategies for BCCs and SCCs, and the choice of management 
strategy for an individual patient is not straightforward. We aimed to 
comprehensively collect information on the comparative effectiveness and safety 
of each currently used therapeutic strategy for both BCC and SCC.
DATA SOURCES: We conducted literature searches in MEDLINE®, the Cochrane Central 
Trials Registry and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Embase® up to 
March 2017. We also perused the reference lists of published relevant clinical 
practice guidelines and systematic reviews. We recorded information on 
recurrence, histologic clearance, clinical clearance, patient- or observer-rated 
cosmetic outcomes, adverse effects, quality of life, costs and resources, mental 
health, patient satisfaction, and mortality. We estimated intervention effects 
(differences in outcomes between treatments) and the mean frequency of the 
outcome with each treatment using network meta-analyses.
RESULTS: We identified 58 randomized controlled trials and 51 nonrandomized 
comparative studies comparing 21 interventions in 9 categories. Nearly all 
reported results for recurrence or cure rate outcomes and adverse events, and 
many reported results for cosmetic outcomes. Few studies reported results using 
validated instruments for quality of life, mental health, or patient 
satisfaction with treatment. Data were sparse, especially for analyses at the 
individual-intervention level. For BCCs, surgical interventions and radiation 
were associated with lower recurrence rates than interventions that destroy 
lesions with heat or cold and photodynamic therapy (PDT), and may have lower 
recurrence rates than curettage. Recurrence rates did not differ significantly 
between imiquimod and excision. The data were not sufficient to draw conclusions 
about the comparison of curettage with interventions that destroy lesions with 
heat or cold, or PDT versus other intervention categories. For SCC in situ, 
interventions that destroy the lesions with heat or cold and PDT were associated 
with lower recurrence rates than 5-fluorouracil. Data on the relative effect of 
thermal interventions versus PDT were not precise enough to draw conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on sparse evidence, surgical and radiation treatments have 
lower recurrence rates than other modalities for the treatment of low-risk BCC, 
and PDT appears to have superior cosmetic outcomes. Large gaps remain in the 
literature regarding the comparison of individual interventions and SCC in situ, 
with very little or no information on immunocompromised patients, patients with 
limited life expectancy, and patients with specific lesion categories, including 
high-risk BCCs and invasive SCCs.

BACKGROUND: The diagnosis and treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) 
have increased steadily within the past decade, and research indicates 
clinically significant improvements after treatment of FAI with hip arthroscopy.
PURPOSE: This study examined the societal and economic impact of hip arthroscopy 
by high-volume surgeons for patients with FAI syndrome aged <50 years with 
noncontroversial diagnosis and indications for surgery.
STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of hip arthroscopy versus nonoperative treatment 
was evaluated by calculating direct and indirect treatment costs. Direct cost 
was calculated with Current Procedural Terminology medical codes associated with 
FAI treatment. Indirect cost was measured with the patient-reported data of 102 
patients who underwent arthroscopy and from the reimbursement records of 32,143 
individuals between the ages of 16 and 79 years who had information in a private 
insurance claims data set contained within the PearlDiver Patient Records 
Database. The indirect economic benefits of hip arthroscopy were inferred 
through regression analysis to estimate the statistical relationship between 
functional status and productivity. A simulation-based approach was then used to 
estimate the change in productivity associated with the change in functional 
status observed in the treatment cohort between baseline and follow-up. To 
analyze cost-effectiveness, 1-, 2-, and 3-way sensitivity analyses were 
performed on all variables in the model, and Monte Carlo analysis evaluated the 
impact of uncertainty in the model assumptions.
RESULTS: Analysis of indirect costs identified a statistically significant 
increase of mean aggregate productivity of $8968 after surgery. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis showed a mean cumulative total 10-year societal 
savings of $67,418 per patient from hip arthroscopy versus nonoperative 
treatment. Hip arthroscopy also conferred a gain of 2.03 quality-adjusted life 
years over this period. The mean cost for hip arthroscopy was estimated at 
$23,120 ± $10,279, and the mean cost of nonoperative treatment was estimated at 
$91,602 ± $14,675. In 99% of trials, hip arthroscopy was recognized as the 
preferred cost-effective strategy.
CONCLUSION: FAI syndrome produces a substantial economic burden on society that 
may be reduced through the indirect cost savings and economic benefits from hip 
arthroscopy.

The present study provides an estimate of the U.S. economic impact of child 
sexual abuse (CSA). Costs of CSA were measured from the societal perspective and 
include health care costs, productivity losses, child welfare costs, 
violence/crime costs, special education costs, and suicide death costs. We 
separately estimated quality-adjusted life year (QALY) losses. For each 
category, we used the best available secondary data to develop cost per case 
estimates. All costs were estimated in U.S. dollars and adjusted to the 
reference year 2015. Estimating 20 new cases of fatal and 40,387 new 
substantiated cases of nonfatal CSA that occurred in 2015, the lifetime economic 
burden of CSA is approximately $9.3 billion, the lifetime cost for victims of 
fatal CSA per female and male victim is on average $1,128,334 and $1,482,933, 
respectively, and the average lifetime cost for victims of nonfatal CSA is of 
$282,734 per female victim. For male victims of nonfatal CSA, there was 
insufficient information on productivity losses, contributing to a lower average 
estimated lifetime cost of $74,691 per male victim. If we included QALYs, these 
costs would increase by approximately $40,000 per victim. With the exception of 
male productivity losses, all estimates were based on robust, replicable 
incidence-based costing methods. The availability of accurate, up-to-date 
estimates should contribute to policy analysis, facilitate comparisons with 
other public health problems, and support future economic evaluations of 
CSA-specific policy and practice. In particular, we hope the availability of 
credible and contemporary estimates will support increased attention to primary 
prevention of CSA.

Beneficial and Detrimental Effects of Antiretroviral Therapy on HIV-Associated 
Immunosenescence.

Franzese O, Barbaccia ML, Bonmassar E, Graziani G.

Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy more than 2 
decades ago, HIV-related deaths have dramatically decreased and HIV infection 
has become a chronic disease. Due to the inability of antiretroviral drugs to 
eradicate the virus, treatment of HIV infection requires a systemic lifelong 
therapy. However, even when successfully treated, HIV patients still show 
increased incidence of age-associated co-morbidities compared with uninfected 
individuals. Virus- induced immunosenescence, a process characterized by a 
progressive decline of immune system function, contributes to the premature 
ageing observed in HIV patients. Although antiretroviral therapy has 
significantly improved both the quality and length of patient lives, the life 
expectancy of treated patients is still shorter compared with that of uninfected 
individuals. In particular, while antiretroviral therapy can contrast some 
features of HIV-associated immunosenescence, several anti-HIV agents may 
themselves contribute to other aspects of immune ageing. Moreover, older HIV 
patients tend to have a worse immunological response to the antiviral therapy. 
In this review we will examine the available evidence on the role of 
antiretroviral therapy in the control of the main features regulating 
immunosenescence.

Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi) is a popular medicinal mushroom and has been used in 
oriental medicine because of its promoting effects on health and life 
expectancy. G. lucidum contains various compounds with a high grade of 
biological activty, which increase the immunity and show antitumour, 
antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitory activity. Several of these substances belong to the triterpenoids and 
polysaccharides classes. Proteins, lipids, phenols, sterols, etc. are also 
present. In the present review, an extensive overview of the presence of 
antitumour, antimicrobial, antioxidant and antiacetylcholinesterase compounds in 
G. lucidum extracts will be given, along with an evaluation of their therapeutic 
effects.
