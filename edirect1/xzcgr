BACKGROUND: Extraspinal percutaneous osteoplasties (POPs) are novel techniques 
for the treatment of painful bony metastasis, which is often the cause of both 
persistent and incidental breakthrough pain. This retrospective study explored 
the efficacy and complications of extraspinal POPs.
METHODS: The origin of the cancer metastasis, performed POP sites, necessity of 
adjacent joint injections, pain and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores, 
complications related to the POPs, and life expectancy were evaluated from the 
medical records from 2009 to 2016.
RESULTS: A total of 47 (M/F = 28/19) patients had received 54 POPs, including 
costoplasty, scapuloplasty, ilioplasty, humeroplasty, ischioplasty, 
femoroplasty, sternoplasty, and puboplasty, in order of frequency. The most 
common sites for the origin of the cancer, in order of frequency, were the lung, 
liver, breast, colon, and kidney. All patients receiving POPs including 
scapuloplasty, ilioplasty, humeroplasty, and femoroplasty needed adjacent joint 
injections before or after the POPs. Pain due to metastatic lesions was reduced 
significantly immediately after the POPs and the reduction was sustained until 
the end of their lives. The median KPS was increased from 35.4% to 67.7% 
immediately after the POPs. There were no complications related to the 
procedures. The mean life expectancy after performing the POPs, for 35 patients 
which died afterwards, was 99.3 days, ranging from 1 to 767 days.
CONCLUSION: Even though pain in the isolated POP sites may be difficult to 
measure due to overlapping systemic pain, the POPs provided immediate local pain 
relief, and the patients showed better physical performance without 
procedure-related complications.

As life expectancy increases, the phenomenon of the neglect of elderly persons 
is becoming increasingly relevant in the fields of both medicine and social 
care. This work analyses the cases of two subjects whose deaths initially seemed 
to have been attributable to natural causes. The autopsy findings and the 
analysis of clinical data, however, were able to establish that neglect had 
played a determining role in their deaths. These cases highlight the need for 
healthcare workers to be more alert to the clinical signs of neglect. Finally, 
in cases of death, the forensic pathologist must conduct a meticulous 
post-mortem examination to detect the physical signs of neglect and to establish 
if abuse has been responsible for the death.

INTRODUCTION: HFE-associated haemochromatosis, the most common monogenic 
disorder amongst populations of northern European ancestry, is characterised by 
iron overload. Excess iron is stored in parenchymal tissues, leading to 
morbidity and mortality. Population screening programmes are likely to improve 
early diagnosis, thereby decreasing associated disease. Our aim was to develop 
and validate a health economics model of screening using utilities and costs 
from a haemochromatosis cohort.
METHODS: A state-transition model was developed with Markov states based on 
disease severity. Australian males (aged 30 years) and females (aged 45 years) 
of northern European ancestry were the target populations. The screening 
strategy was the status quo approach in Australia; the model was run over a 
lifetime horizon. Costs were estimated from the government perspective and 
reported in 2015 Australian dollars ($A); costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) were discounted at 5% annually. Model validity was assessed using 
goodness-of-fit analyses. Second-order Monte-Carlo simulation was used to 
account for uncertainty in multiple parameters.
RESULTS: For validity, the model reproduced mortality, life expectancy (LE) and 
prevalence rates in line with published data. LE for C282Y homozygote males and 
females were 49.9 and 40.2 years, respectively, slightly lower than population 
rates. Mean (95% confidence interval) QALYS were 15.7 (7.7-23.7) for males and 
14.4 (6.7-22.1) for females. Mean discounted lifetime costs for C282Y 
homozygotes were $A22,737 (3670-85,793) for males and $A13,840 (1335-67,377) for 
females. Sensitivity analyses revealed discount rates and prevalence had the 
greatest impacts on outcomes.
CONCLUSION: We have developed a transparent, validated health economics model of 
C282Y homozygote haemochromatosis. The model will be useful to decision makers 
to identify cost-effective screening strategies.

OBJECTIVE: As relatively little is known about how socioeconomic position might 
have affected health prior to the Second World War, we aimed to study lifespan 
by occupational class in two cohorts in New Zealand.
METHODS: The first study included men on the electoral rolls in Dunedin in the 
period 1893 to 1902. The second study used an established cohort of male 
military personnel who were recruited for the First World War. Linear regression 
was used to estimate lifespan by occupational class.
RESULTS: The first study of 259 men on the electoral rolls found no substantive 
lifespan differences between the high and low occupational class groups. But the 
second study of 2,406 military personnel found that men in the three highest 
occupational classes lived 3.5 years longer (95%CI: 0.3-6.8 years) than the 
three lowest classes (in the multivariable analysis adjusting for age in 1918 
and rurality of occupation).
CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant lifespan differences in one cohort, but a 
second cohort is the earliest demonstration to our knowledge of substantial 
differences in mortality by socioeconomic position in this country prior to the 
1960s. Implications for public health: This study provides historical context to 
the long-term efforts to address health inequalities in society.

Medicine, Pembroke Place, Liverpool, England.

BACKGROUND: Greater regional devolution can reduce economic inequalities between 
regions; however, the impact on health inequalities is not clear. We 
investigated the association between changes over time in the level of 
devolution in European countries and regional economic and health inequalities.
METHODS: We used the proportion of government expenditure controlled by 
subnational levels of government as our measure of devolution in 14 European 
countries between 1995 and 2011. Fixed effects linear regression models were 
used to analyse trends in the level of devolution, trends in regional economic 
inequalities (Gini-coefficient) and trends in regional health inequalities 
(slope index) in life expectancy.
RESULTS: Each additional percentage of government expenditure managed at 
subnational level reduced the Gini-coefficient of regional GDP by -0.17 points 
(95% CI: -0.33 to -0.01; P = 0.04). However, it increased the slope index of 
regional life expectancy by 23 days (95% CI: -2 to 48; P = 0.07). When trends in 
regional economic inequalities were controlled for, as a potential 
mediator-increased devolution-was significantly associated with an increase in 
health inequalities between regions (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased devolution does not appear to reduce regional health 
inequalities-even when it reduces regional economic inequalities-and it could be 
associated with increased health inequalities.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) often experience debilitating 
skeletal-related events (SREs: pathologic fracture, radiation to bone [RB], 
surgery to bone [SB] or spinal cord compression [SCC]). This is the first 
comprehensive, prospective, observational analysis of healthcare resource 
utilisation (HRU), independently attributed to SREs by investigators, in 
patients with MM.
METHODS: Eligible patients had lytic bone lesions, life expectancy ≥6 months, 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤2 and ≥1 SRE in the 
97 days before enrolment. Data were collected retrospectively for 97 days before 
enrolment and prospectively for 18-21 months.
RESULTS: Altogether, 153 patients were enrolled from Germany, Italy, Spain and 
the United Kingdom. Of the 281 observed SREs, 36.7% required inpatient stays 
(mean duration: 20.6 days per SRE [standard deviation (SD): 22.9]). SB and SCC 
were the SREs most likely to require stays (72.3% and 50.0% of SREs, 
respectively); SCC required the longest mean (SD) stay per event (40.5 [40.8] 
days). Overall, 179 SREs required outpatient visits; this was most likely for RB 
(74.8%) and least likely for non-vertebral fracture (50.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: All SREs were associated with substantial HRU; therefore, 
preventing SREs in MM will reduce the economic and resource burden on healthcare 
systems.

BACKGROUND: Secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively 
neutralizes IL-17A, has been shown to have significant efficacy and a favourable 
safety profile in the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis and psoriatic 
arthritis.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of secukinumab through 5 years of 
treatment in moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
METHODS: In the core SCULPTURE study, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 
75 responders at Week 12 continued receiving subcutaneous secukinumab until Year 
1. Thereafter, patients entered the extension phase and continued treatment as 
per the core trial. Treatment was double-blinded until the end of Year 3 and 
open-label from Year 4. Here, we focus on the 300 mg fixed-interval (every 
4 weeks) treatment, the recommended per label dose. Efficacy data are primarily 
reported as observed, but multiple imputation (MI) and last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) techniques were also undertaken as supportive analyses.
RESULTS: At Year 1, 168 patients entered the extension study and at the end of 
Year 5, 126 patients completed 300 mg (every 4 weeks) treatment. PASI 75/90/100 
responses at Year 1 (88.9%, 68.5% and 43.8%, respectively) were sustained to 
Year 5 (88.5%, 66.4% and 41%). PASI responses were consistent regardless of the 
analysis undertaken (as observed, MI, or LOCF). The average improvement in mean 
PASI was approximately 90% through 5 years compared with core study baseline. 
DLQI (dermatology life quality index) 0/1 response also sustained through 
5 years (72.7% at Year 1 and 65.5% at Year 5). The safety profile of secukinumab 
remained favourable, with no cumulative or unexpected safety concerns 
identified.
CONCLUSION: Secukinumab 300 mg treatment delivered high and sustained levels of 
skin clearance and improved quality of life through 5 years in patients with 
moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Favourable safety established in the secukinumab 
phase 2/3 programme was maintained through 5 years.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy at birth (LE) is a comprehensive measure that 
accounts for age-specific death rates in a population. Shanghai has ranked first 
in LE in China mainland for decades. Understanding the reasons behind its 
sustained gain in LE provides a good reflection of many other cities in China. 
The aim of this study is intended to explore temporal trend in age- and 
cause-specific gains in LE in Shanghai and the probable reasons lay behind.
METHODS: Joinpoint regression was applied to evaluate temporal trend in LE and 
the long time span was then divided accordingly. Contributions to change in LE 
(1973-2015) were decomposed by age and cause at corresponding periods.
RESULTS: LE in Shanghai could be divided into four phases ie., descent 
(1973-1976), recovery (1976-1998), rapid rise (1998-2004) and slow rise 
(2004-2015). The growing LE was mainly attributed to reductions in mortality 
from the elderly populations and chronic diseases such as cerebrovascular 
disease, chronic lower respiratory disease, and gastrointestinal cancers 
(stomach, liver and esophageal cancer).
CONCLUSIONS: The four-decade sustained gain in LE in Shanghai is due to the 
reductions in mortality from the elderly and chronic diseases such as 
cerebrovascular disease, chronic lower respiratory disease, and gastrointestinal 
cancers. Further growth momentum still comes from the elderly population.

Many studies have reported genetic interventions that have an effect on mouse 
life span; however, it is crucial to discriminate between manipulations of aging 
and aging-independent causes of life extension. Here, we used the Gompertz 
equation to determine whether previously reported aging-related mouse genes 
statistically affect the demographic rate of aging. Of 30 genetic manipulations 
previously reported to extend life span, for only two we found evidence of 
retarding demographic aging: Cisd2 and hMTH1 Of 24 genetic manipulations 
reported to shorten life span and induce premature aging features, we found 
evidence of five accelerating demographic aging: Casp2, Fn1, IKK-β, JunD, and 
Stub1 Overall, our reassessment found that only 15% of the genetic manipulations 
analyzed significantly affected the demographic rate of aging as predicted, 
suggesting that a relatively small proportion of interventions affecting 
longevity do so by regulating the rate of aging. By contrast, genetic 
manipulations affecting longevity tend to impact on aging-independent mortality. 
Our meta-analysis of multiple mouse longevity studies also reveals substantial 
variation in the controls used across experiments, suggesting that a short life 
span of controls is a potential source of bias. Overall, the present work leads 
to a reassessment of genes affecting the aging process in mice, with broad 
implications for our understanding of the genetics of mammalian aging and which 
genes may be more promising targets for drug discovery.

Movement of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus occurs through 
the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Karyopherins comprise a family of soluble 
transport factors facilitating the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of proteins 
through the NPC. In this study, we found that karyopherin α6 (KPNA6; also known 
as importin α7) was required for the optimal replication of porcine reproductive 
and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), which are 
positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses replicating in the cytoplasm. The 
KPNA6 protein level in virus-infected cells was much higher than that in 
mock-infected controls, whereas the KPNA6 transcript remains stable. Viral 
infection blocked the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of KPNA6, which led to 
an extension of the KPNA6 half-life and the elevation of the KPNA6 level in 
comparison to mock-infected cells. PRRSV nsp12 protein induced KPNA6 
stabilization. KPNA6 silencing was detrimental to the replication of PRRSV, and 
KPNA6 knockout impaired ZIKV replication. Moreover, KPNA6 knockout blocked the 
nuclear translocation of PRRSV nsp1β but had a minimal effect on two other PRRSV 
proteins with nuclear localization. Exogenous restitution of KPNA6 expression in 
the KPNA6-knockout cells results in restoration of the nuclear translocation of 
PRRSV nsp1β and the replication of ZIKV. These results indicate that KPNA6 is an 
important cellular factor for the replication of PRRSV and ZIKV.IMPORTANCE 
Positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses replicate in the cytoplasm 
of infected cells. The roles of transport factors in the nucleocytoplasmic 
trafficking system for the replication of +ssRNA viruses are not known. In this 
study, we discovered that PRRSV and ZIKV viruses needed karyopherin α6 (KPNA6), 
one of the transport factors, to enhance the virus replication. Our data showed 
that viral infection induced an elevation of the KPNA6 protein level due to an 
extension of the KPNA6 half-life via viral interference of the 
ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of KPNA6. Notably, KPNA6 silencing or knockout 
dramatically reduced the replication of PRRSV and ZIKV. PRRSV nsp1β depended on 
KPNA6 to translocate into the nucleus. In addition, exogenous restitution of 
KPNA6 expression in KPNA6-knockout cells led to the restoration of nsp1β nuclear 
translocation and ZIKV replication. These results reveal a new aspect in the 
virus-cell interaction and may facilitate the development of novel antiviral 
therapeutics.

An emerging paradigm in immunology suggests that metabolic reprogramming and 
immune cell activation and functions are intricately linked. Viral infections, 
such as HIV infection, as well as cancer force immune cells to undergo major 
metabolic challenges. Cells must divert energy resources in order to mount an 
effective immune response. However, the fact that immune cells adopt specific 
metabolic programs to provide host defense against intracellular pathogens and 
how this metabolic shift impacts immune cell functions and the natural course of 
diseases have only recently been appreciated. A clearer insight into how these 
processes are inter-related will affect our understanding of several fundamental 
aspects of HIV persistence. Even in patients with long-term use of 
anti-retroviral therapies, HIV infection persists and continues to cause chronic 
immune activation and inflammation, ongoing and cumulative damage to multiple 
organs systems, and a reduction in life expectancy. HIV-associated fundamental 
changes to the metabolic machinery of the immune system can promote a state of 
"inflammaging", a chronic, low-grade inflammation with specific immune changes 
that characterize aging, and can also contribute to the persistence of HIV in 
its reservoirs. In this commentary, we will bring into focus evolving concepts 
on how HIV modulates the metabolic machinery of immune cells in order to persist 
in reservoirs and how metabolic reprogramming facilitates a chronic state of 
inflammation that underlies the development of age-related comorbidities. We 
will discuss how immunometabolism is facilitating the changing paradigms in HIV 
cure research and outline the novel therapeutic opportunities for preventing 
inflammaging and premature development of age-related conditions in HIV + 
individuals.

This study was designed to estimate the contribution of age- and 
disease-specific mortality, particularly that attributable to chronic 
noncommunicable diseases and at-birth life expectancy (LE) in Suzhou, East 
China, between 2006 and 2015. In total, data on 427 290 deaths were analyzed. 
From 2006 to 2015, the at-birth LE increased from 78.92 years to 82.87 years in 
Suzhou. A decrease in all-cause age-specific death rates contributed to an 
increase of 1.98 years. The decreased death rates attributable to 
noncommunicable diseases including cerebrovascular diseases, cancer, heart 
disease, and respiratory diseases resulted in an increased LE of 1.37 years, 
which was particularly pronounced among people aged 65 years and older. However, 
the prevalence of cancer in those aged 45 to 74 years, particularly gastric, 
liver, and esophageal cancers, contributed the most to the increase in LE. These 
data may be useful for public health communications.

Simulation models are used widely in pharmacology, epidemiology and health 
economics (HEs). However, there have been no attempts to incorporate models from 
these disciplines into a single integrated model. Accordingly, we explored this 
linkage to evaluate the epidemiological and economic impact of oseltamivir dose 
optimisation in supporting pandemic influenza planning in the USA. An HE 
decision analytic model was linked to a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) 
- dynamic transmission model simulating the impact of pandemic influenza with 
low virulence and low transmissibility and, high virulence and high 
transmissibility. The cost-utility analysis was from the payer and societal 
perspectives, comparing oseltamivir 75 and 150 mg twice daily (BID) to no 
treatment over a 1-year time horizon. Model parameters were derived from 
published studies. Outcomes were measured as cost per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the integrated 
model's robustness. Under both pandemic scenarios, compared to no treatment, the 
use of oseltamivir 75 or 150 mg BID led to a significant reduction of influenza 
episodes and influenza-related deaths, translating to substantial savings of 
QALYs. Overall drug costs were offset by the reduction of both direct and 
indirect costs, making these two interventions cost-saving from both 
perspectives. The results were sensitive to the proportion of inpatient 
presentation at the emergency visit and patients' quality of life. Integrating 
PK/PD-EPI/HE models is achievable. Whilst further refinement of this novel 
linkage model to more closely mimic the reality is needed, the current study has 
generated useful insights to support influenza pandemic planning.

[Determination of priority unfavorable environmental factors].

[Article in Russian]

Zaikova ZA, Burdukovskaya AV, Belykh AI.

In the Irkutsk region there are recorded high indices of rates of morbidity, 
disability, mortality rate of the working-age population and low levels of life 
expectancy of the population, that is confirmed by ranking position levels among 
the all subjects of the Russian Federation. According to all mentioned indices 
of health the region is inside the top ten unfavorable regions of Russia. In 
relation to the problem in the state of health of the adult population the 
estimation of the causal relationships between environmental factors and certain 
health indices is actual. The list of studiedfactors included health indices 
that characterize the harmful working conditions of the working population and 
basic socioeconomic indices in the region. Estimation of causal-relationship 
relationships was performed with the use of methods of multivariate analysis - 
correlation and multiple linear regression. In the selection offactors for the 
construction of mathematical models of multiple regression there were used 
methods of the analysis of variables variability, pair correlation coefficients 
matrix and sequential switching covariates to eliminate the problems of 
multicollinearity, pre-standardization of indices for the elevation of the 
numerical stability of regression analysis algorithm. As a result of the 
execution of the analysis there were constructed statistical models for the 
dependence in the system variables “environment - public health”, which allowed 
to identify the most informative regression models for the adult population 
health according to indices of primary disability of the population, the 
mortality rate and life expectancy of the working age population. According to 
results of the analysis there were identified priority factors affecting on the 
health of the adult population of the Irkutsk region. To these factors there are 
referred the proportion of workplaces failing to meet sanitary standards for 
vibration and 8 socio-economic indices of living standards of the population.

Life expectancy is greatly reduced in patients with schizophrenia, and 
cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality. The aim of this 
cross-sectional study was to investigate the prevalence of overweight, obesity, 
and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and to investigate the relationships 
between self-rated health, sense of coherence, CVD risk, and body mass index 
(BMI) among people with severe mental illness (SMI) in psychiatric outpatient 
settings. Nearly 50% of the participants were exposed to moderate/high risk of 
CVD and over 50% were obese. The results showed no statistically relationships 
between the subjective and objective measures (Bayes factor <1) of health. The 
integration of physical health into clinical psychiatric nursing practice is 
vital.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease, a common recessively inherited haemoglobin 
disorder, affects people from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Mediterranean 
basin, Indian subcontinent, Caribbean and South America. It is associated with 
complications and a reduced life expectancy. Phytomedicines (medicine derived 
from plants in their original state) encompass many of the plant remedies from 
traditional healers which the populations most affected would encounter. 
Laboratory research and limited clinical trials have suggested positive effects 
of phytomedicines both in vivo and in vitro. However, there has been little 
systematic appraisal of their benefits. This is an update of a Cochrane Review 
first published in 2004, and updated in 2010, 2013, and 2015.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and risks of phytomedicines in people with 
sickle cell disease of all types, of any age, in any setting.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders 
Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, the International Standard Randomised 
Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN), the Allied and Complimentary Medicine 
Database (AMED), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) 
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).Dates of most recent 
searches: Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Haemoglobinopathies 
Trials Register: 10 April 2017; ISRCTN: 26 July 2017; AMED: 24 August 2017; 
ClinicalTrials.gov: 02 August 2017; and the WHO ICTRP: 27 July 2017.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials with participants of 
all ages with sickle cell disease, in all settings, comparing the administration 
of phytomedicines, by any mode to placebo or conventional treatment, including 
blood transfusion and hydroxyurea.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently assessed trial quality 
and extracted data.
MAIN RESULTS: Two trials (182 participants) and two phytomedicines Niprisan® 
(also known as Nicosan®) and Ciklavit® were included. The Phase IIB (pivotal) 
trial suggests that Niprisan® was effective in reducing episodes of severe 
painful sickle cell disease crisis over a six-month period (low-quality 
evidence). It did not affect the risk of severe complications or the level of 
anaemia (low-quality evidence). No serious adverse effects were reported. The 
single trial of Cajanus cajan (Ciklavit®) reported a possible benefit to 
individuals with painful crises (low-quality evidence), and a possible adverse 
effect (non-significant) on the level of anaemia (low-quality evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: While Niprisan® appeared to be safe and effective in 
reducing severe painful crises over a six-month follow-up period, further trials 
are required to assess its role in the management of people with sickle cell 
disease and the results of its multicentre trials are awaited. Currently no 
conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy of Ciklavit®. Based on the 
published results for Niprisan® and in view of the limitations in data 
collection and analysis of both trials, phytomedicines may have a potential 
beneficial effect in reducing painful crises in sickle cell disease. This needs 
to be further validated in future trials. More trials are required on the safety 
and efficacy of phytomedicines used in managing sickle cell disease.

Reducing tillage and growing cover crops, widely recommended practices for 
boosting soil health, have major impacts on soil communities. Surprisingly 
little is known about their impacts on soil microbial functional diversity, and 
especially so in irrigated Mediterranean ecosystems. In long-term experimental 
plots at the West Side Research and Extension Center in California's Central 
Valley, we characterized soil microbial communities in the presence or absence 
of physical disturbance due to tillage, in the presence or absence of cover 
crops, and at three depths: 0-5, 5-15 and 15-30 cm. This characterization 
included qPCR for bacterial and archaeal abundances, DNA sequencing of the 16S 
rRNA gene, and phylogenetic estimation of two ecologically important microbial 
traits (rRNA gene copy number and genome size). Total (bacterial + archaeal) 
diversity was higher in no-till than standard till; diversity increased with 
depth in no-till but decreased with depth in standard till. Total bacterial 
numbers were higher in cover cropped plots at all depths, while no-till 
treatments showed higher numbers in 0-5 cm but lower numbers at lower depths 
compared to standard tillage. Trait estimates suggested that different farming 
practices and depths favored distinctly different microbial life strategies. 
Tillage in the absence of cover crops shifted microbial communities towards fast 
growing competitors, while no-till shifted them toward slow growing stress 
tolerators. Across all treatment combinations, increasing depth resulted in a 
shift towards stress tolerators. Cover crops shifted the communities towards 
ruderals-organisms with wider metabolic capacities and moderate rates of growth. 
Overall, our results are consistent with decreasing nutrient availability with 
soil depth and under no-till treatments, bursts of nutrient availability and 
niche homogenization under standard tillage, and increases in C supply and 
variety provided by cover crops. Understanding how agricultural practices shift 
microbial abundance, diversity and life strategies, such as presented here, can 
assist with designing farming systems that can support high yields, while 
enhancing C sequestration and increasing resilience to climate change.

An undetected high risk for premature death of cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
among individuals with low-to-moderate risk factor levels is an acknowledged 
obstacle to CVD prevention. In this paper, we present the hypothesis that the 
vasculature's robustness against risk factor load will complement conventional 
risk factor models as a novel stratifier of risk. Figuratively speaking, 
mortality risk prediction without robustness scoring is akin to predicting the 
breaking risk of a lake's ice sheet considering load only while disregarding the 
sheet's bearing strength. Taking the cue from systems biology, which defines 
robustness as the ability to maintain function against internal and external 
challenges, we develop a robustness score from the physical parameters that 
comprehensively quantitate cardiovascular function. We derive the functional 
parameters using a recently introduced novel system, VascAssist 2 (iSYMED GmbH, 
Butzbach, Germany). VascAssist 2 (VA) applies the electronic-hydraulic analogy 
to a digital model of the arterial tree, replicating non-invasively acquired 
pule pressure waves by modulating the electronic equivalents of the physical 
parameters that describe in vivo arterial hemodynamics. As the latter is also 
subject to aging-associated degeneration which (a) progresses at 
inter-individually different rates, and which (b) affects the 
biomarker-mortality association, we express the robustness score as a correction 
factor to calendar age (CA), the dominant risk factor in all CVD risk factor 
models. We then propose a method for the validation of the score against known 
time-to-event data in reference populations. Our conceptualization of robustness 
implies that risk factor-challenged individuals with low robustness scores will 
face preferential elimination from the population resulting in a significant 
robustness-CA correlation in this strata absent in the unchallenged stratum. 
Hence, we also present an outline of a cross-sectional study design suitable to 
test this hypothesis. We finally discuss the objections that may validly be 
raised against our robustness hypothesis, and how available evidence encourages 
us to refute these objections.

Recombinant factor XIII-A2 (rFXIII-A2) was developed for prophylaxis and 
treatment of bleeds in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. 
mentor™2 (NCT00978380), a multinational, open-label, single-arm, multiple-dosing 
extension to the pivotal mentor™1 trial, assessed long-term safety and efficacy 
of rFXIII-A2 prophylaxis in eligible patients (patients with severe [<0.05 
IU/mL] congenital FXIII subunit A deficiency) aged ≥6 years. Patients received 
35 IU/kg rFXIII-A2 (exact dosing) every 28 ± 2 days for ≥52 weeks. Primary 
endpoint was safety (adverse events including immunogenicity); secondary 
endpoints were rate of bleeds requiring FXIII treatment, haemostatic response 
after one 35 IU/kg rFXIII-A2 dose for breakthrough bleeds and withdrawals due to 
lack of rFXIII-A2 efficacy. Steady-state pharmacokinetic variables were also 
summarized. Elective surgery was permitted during the treatment period. Sixty 
patients were exposed to rFXIII-A2; their median age was 26.0 years (range: 
7.0-77.0). rFXIII-A2 was well tolerated without any safety concerns. No 
non-neutralizing or neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against FXIII were 
detected. Mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) was 0.043/patient-year. Mean 
spontaneous ABR was 0.011/patient-year. No patients withdrew due to lack of 
efficacy. Geometric mean FXIII trough level was 0.17 IU/mL. Geometric terminal 
half-life was 13.7 days. rFXIII-A2 prophylaxis provided sufficient haemostatic 
coverage for 12 minor surgeries without the need for additional FXIII therapy; 
eight procedures were performed within 7 days of the patient's last scheduled 
rFXIII-A2 dose, and four were performed 10 to 21 days after the last dose.

BACKGROUND: In the Systolic Heart failure treatment with the If inhibitor Trial 
(SHIFT) randomised placebo-controlled trial, ivabradine was shown to reduce 
hospital admissions for worsening heart failure (HF) and deaths due to HF in 
patients with symptomatic systolic HF and an elevated resting heart rate (HR). 
This analysis evaluates the cost effectiveness of adding ivabradine to optimal 
standard HF treatment in patients with a HR≥77 bpm.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the impact of ivabradine on mean 
survival and quality of life over a patient's lifetime (10 years). The 
hospitalisation and death rates were calculated using patient-level data from 
SHIFT. The reduction in quality of life due to HF hospitalisations was estimated 
directly from EQ-5D data collected in SHIFT. Australian costs were applied to 
the resource use from SHIFT.
RESULTS: The modelled mean increase in survival with ivabradine was 0.115 years. 
The mean increase in quality-adjusted survival was 0.108 years. The average cost 
of ivabradine was A$2,957 and the cost savings associated with a reduction in HF 
hospitalisations was A$1,344. The cost per quality adjusted life year gained 
(QALYG) was A$14,905. The conservative approach to the modelled evaluation, as 
well as results of the sensitivity analysis, demonstrates that ivabradine is
