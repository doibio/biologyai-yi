The challenges facing health professions education in Africa focus on physical 
infrastructure, accreditation systems, student selection and faculty 
recruitment, retention, and development. Higher education in the health 
professions must be closely aligned with community health needs, and with the 
training and support of community health workers. A key ingredient in changing 
institutions in this way is implementation of effective strategies for 
strengthening the faculty. In addition, information systems, and their 
prerequisite stable electric power supply, must be supported by internal public 
resources combined with external aid. These infrastructure investments will 
facilitate better quality education, improved diffusion of information among 
schools, and more useful data for self study by institutions.

Understanding and tackling aging: two fields communicating (a little) at last.

Those who have followed this journal's, and this author's, efforts over recent 
years to stimulate the rational design of interventions to combat aging have 
good reason for bewilderment that the concerted application of our knowledge of 
biology to the defeat of humanity's foremost killer needed to be kick-started by 
a bearded troublemaker whose formal academic training was not even in biology at 
all. Elsewhere in this issue I bemoan the persistent balkanisation of 
traditional gerontology, whereby biologists, clinicians, sociologists and 
psychologists studying the elderly seem almost studiously to avoid each other 
even when participating in the same conference. In this commentary, however, I 
have something more positive to report. A string of recent and forthcoming 
conferences, organized not only by those at the forefront of life-extension 
research but also by highly influential mainstream groups, have publicly 
endorsed the Methuselah Foundation's goal of defeating aging. The field of 
biomedical gerontology-the interface between biogerontology and geriatrics, 
where biological knowledge is focused on developing the geriatrics of 
tomorrow-is not a traditional component of gerontology, having been poorly 
appreciated by biogerontologists and geriatricians alike, but these developments 
show that it is rapidly taking its place at that table.

Russia.

BACKGROUND: We examined mortality among working-age Russian men whose identity 
could not be determined, focusing on where and how they died.
METHODS: Employing micro-data from deaths that occurred in Izhevsk (Ural region) 
between June 2004 and September 2005, we analysed the characteristics of 
decedent men aged 25-54 (n = 2158). Differences between completely identified (n 
= 1699) and unidentified deaths (n = 282) were compared via logistic regression. 
Data on all deaths in Russia in 2002 were used for supplemental comparisons.
RESULTS: We found that relative to identified men, unidentified men were at a 
higher risk of death from exposure to natural cold, violence, alcoholic 
cardiomyopathy, acute respiratory infections and poisonings. Our results also 
revealed that alcohol played an important role in the mortality of unidentified 
men. The places and causes of death among these unidentified men provide 
substantial evidence of their homelessness and social isolation.
CONCLUSION: The increase in deaths among unidentified men of working-age 
indicates the emergence of a health threat associated with homelessness and 
social marginalization. This vulnerable group is exposed to different levels and 
causes of mortality compared with the larger population and represent a new 
challenge that requires serious and immediate scholarly attention and policy 
responses.

BACKGROUND: In accordance with World Health Organization recommendations, many 
European countries have introduced universal hepatitis B vaccination policies. 
The UK and Ireland are exceptions. In this study, we conducted an economic 
evaluation of a universal infant hepatitis B vaccination programme, using a 
six-component vaccine, compared with the current selective strategy of 
vaccinating high-risk infants with a monovalent hepatitis B vaccine.
METHODS: A cost effectiveness analysis was conducted using a Markov model. The 
perspective of the analysis was the Irish Health Service Executive. Unit cost 
and resource utilization data were derived from expert clinical opinion, 
published sources, diagnosis-related group costs for hospital admissions and 
local cost estimates for medical fees and laboratory investigations. A full 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken. Both costs and outcomes were 
modelled over a period of 80 years and discounted at 3.5%.
RESULTS: Assuming an incidence of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in 
Ireland of 8.4 per 100,000 population, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio 
ranged from euro10,992/life years gained (LYG) to euro67 200/LYG, at the lowest 
and highest price estimates for the six-component vaccine, respectively. The 
cost effectiveness of universal versus selective hepatitis B vaccination was 
sensitive to the risk of acute HBV infection, the cost of the universal infant 
vaccination programme and the discount rate.
CONCLUSION: At a cost of euro29.00 per dose of the six-component vaccine, 
universal infant hepatitis B vaccination is cost effective at euro37 018/LYG. 
This compares favourably with other preventive programmes in Ireland.

A poor prognosis: guide or misleading?

Wijnia JW(1), Corstiaensen IJ.

Netherlands. j.wijnia@zorggroeprijnmond.nl

Patients admitted to a palliative care unit have a limited life expectancy. 
Sometimes, however, the accuracy of the prognosis is compromised by atypical 
progress of a disease or incorrect assumptions. If a predicted short life 
expectancy proves to be longer, the increased need of care may result in chronic 
admission and in a significantly reduced quality of life. A given poor prognosis 
may be mistakenly adhered to and might lead to insufficient diagnostic 
procedures or treatment. However, palliative care requires a patient-oriented 
and active approach. To be aware of possible incomplete diagnostics is an 
important step in preventing adverse consequences of a wrong prognosis.

When treating the acute and chronic diseases of nursing home residents, the 
family physician must consider the patient's decreased ability to make decisions 
and shortened life expectancy in each case. Nurses tend the elderly people, help 
them wherever it is necessary, have time to listen to the hardships and worries 
of their charges and are an irreplaceable help to the family physician for 
observing patients and assessing the measures taken based on these observations.

Increased longevity in offspring of mothers with Alzheimer's disease.

Life expectancy is a familial trait. However, the effectiveness of using the age 
at death of a deceased parent to estimate life expectancy in their offspring can 
vary depending on whether death in the parent was due to extrinsic versus 
intrinsic causes, as well as demographic characteristics such as sex. While 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk increases with increased age, mortality for 
individuals with AD is increased in contrast to comparably aged individuals 
without AD. Yet in most cases it is not the defining neuropathology of AD that 
directly terminates life but instead conditions and illnesses extrinsic to AD 
pathology that nevertheless have increased likelihood in its presence. For this 
reason, we hypothesized that offspring of AD mothers would have greater 
longevity than offspring of mothers without AD (insufficient numbers prevented a 
comparable analysis using fathers with AD). The longevity of 345 offspring of 
100 deceased 60+ year old AD mothers was compared with 5,465 offspring in 1,312 
deceased 60+ year old non-AD mothers. We used a proportional hazards model that 
accounted for clustered (nonindependent) observations due to the inclusion of 
several offspring from the same family. In both an unadjusted model and one that 
adjusted for the age at death in the mother, and the sex and birth year in the 
offspring we found evidence for increased longevity in the offspring of AD 
mothers. The results suggest that, in addition to genes that might directly 
affect pathways leading to AD, there may be familial/genetic factors not 
connected to specific pathophysiological processes in AD but instead associated 
with increased longevity that contribute to the familial aggregation observed in 
AD.

Completion angiography for surgically treated cerebral aneurysms: an economic 
analysis.

Pennsylvania 19106, USA. sherman.stein@uphs.upenn.edu

OBJECTIVE: To compare cost-effectiveness of different strategies for completion 
angiography after cerebral aneurysm clipping.
METHODS: A literature search was used to determine the outcome probabilities and 
costs of various strategies. The pooled results were used in a Markov 
cost-effectiveness model to compare quality-adjusted life-years and costs of 
each strategy. Sensitivity (threshold) analyses and Monte Carlo simulation were 
used to test variation in the model.
RESULTS: Routine (for all cases) intraoperative angiography proved to be 
slightly more cost-effective than selective (only for cases deemed "high risk") 
intraoperative angiography, being both less costly and more effective. Routine 
postoperative angiography was the least cost-effective. However, in centers 
whose rates of clip-induced arterial compromise are much lower than the averages 
reported in the literature, selective angiography might be warranted.
CONCLUSION: Routine intraoperative angiography remains the most cost-effective 
form of completion angiography after aneurysm clipping, at least at our present 
state of technology.

Medical consequences of acromegaly: what are the effects of biochemical control?

University of Naples, via S Pansini 5, 80131, Naples, Italy. colao@unina.it

This chapter discusses the effects of biochemical control of acromegaly on 
cardiovascular diseases, metabolic complications, respiratory abnormalities, 
malignancies and bone alterations. Acromegaly is associated with increased 
morbidity and mortality for cardiovascular and respiratory complications, 
whereas neoplasms seem to be a minor cause of increased risk of death. Other 
associated diseases are osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, fatigue, visual 
abnormalities and reproductive disorders. Acromegaly results in premature death 
because of prolonged elevation of GH an IGF-I levels, and a strong biochemical 
control improves well-being and restores life expectancy to normal. The main 
goals of medical treatment of acromegaly include normalization of biochemical 
markers of disease activity, improvement in signs and symptoms of the disease, 
removal or reduction of tumor mass and preservation of pituitary function.

Adult honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) abandon hemocytic, but not 
phenoloxidase-based immunity.

Schmid MR(1), Brockmann A, Pirk CW, Stanley DW, Tautz J.

Author information:

Hemocytes and the (prophenol-) phenoloxidase system constitute the immediate 
innate immune system in insects. These components of insect immunity are present 
at any post-embryonic life stage without previous infection. Differences between 
individuals and species in these immune parameters can reflect differences in 
infection risk, life expectancy, and biological function. In honeybees which 
show an age-related division of labor within the worker caste, previous studies 
demonstrated that foragers show a strongly reduced number of hemoctyes compared 
to the younger nurse bees. This loss of immune competence has been regarded 
advantageous with respect to an already high mortality rate due to foraging and 
to redistribution of energy costs at the colony level. Based on the idea that 
abandoning hemocytes in all adults would be a reasonably direct regulatory 
mechanism, we posed the hypothesis that abandoning hemocytic immunity is not 
restricted to worker honeybees. We tested our hypotheses by performing a 
comprehensive analysis of hemocyte number and phenoloxidase (PO)-activity levels 
in immunologically naive workers, queens, and drones. We found that in all three 
adult phenotypes hemocyte number is dramatically reduced in early adult life. In 
contrast, we found that the dynamics of PO-activity levels have sex and 
caste-specific characteristics. In workers, PO activity reached a plateau within 
the first week of adult life, and in queens enzyme levels continuously increased 
with age and reached levels twice as high as those found in workers. PO-activity 
levels slightly declined with age in drones. These data support our hypothesis, 
from which we infer that the previously reported reduction of hemocyte in 
foragers is not worker specific but represents a general phenomenon occurring in 
all honeybee adult phenotypes.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the costs and health outcomes of C-Leg and 
non-microprocessor-controlled (NMC) knees using a decision-analytic model.
DESIGN: Data on costs, rates and duration of problems, knee survival, and 
health-related quality of life were obtained from interviews with patients and 
prosthetists with experience of both C-Leg and NMC knees. Interview data were 
assessed in a decision-analytic Markov model to estimate cost-effectiveness from 
a health care perspective.
SETTING: Outpatient.
PARTICIPANTS: A population sample of 20 patients currently using the C-Leg and 
prior experience of nonmicroprocessor knees, and 5 prosthetists.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).
RESULTS: The mean incremental cost (in 2006 Euros) and QALYs for the C-Leg was 
7657 euros and 2.38, respectively, yielding a cost per QALY gained of 3218 
euros.
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to provide decision-makers with relevant 
information on costs and health outcomes of different treatment strategies on 
actual decision problems despite limited evidence. The results of the study, 
taking into account both costs and a broadly defined health outcome in terms of 
QALY, show that given existing albeit limited evidence the C-Leg appears to 
yield positive health outcomes at an acceptable cost.

Trastuzumab in early stage breast cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis for 
Belgium.

Belgium. mattias.neyt@kce.fgov.be

OBJECTIVES: Although trastuzumab is traditionally used in metastatic breast 
cancer treatment, studies reported on the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab in 
adjuvant setting for the treatment of early stage breast cancer in HER2+ tumors. 
We estimated the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of reimbursing trastuzumab 
in this indication from a payer's perspective.
METHODS: We constructed a health economic model. Long-term consequences of 
preventing patients to progress to metastatic breast cancer and side effects 
such as congestive heart failure were taken into account. Uncertainty was 
handled applying probabilistic modeling and through probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: In the HERA scenario, applying an arbitrary threshold of euro30000 per 
life-year gained, early stage breast cancer treatment with trastuzumab is 
cost-effective for 9 out of 15 analyzed subgroups (according to age and stage). 
In contrast, treatment according to the FinHer scenario is cost-effective in 14 
subgroups. Furthermore, the FinHer regimen is most of the times cost saving with 
an average incremental cost of euro668, euro-1045, and euro-6869 for 
respectively stages I, II and III breast cancer patients whereas the HERA 
regimen is never cost saving due to the higher initial treatment costs.
CONCLUSIONS: The model shows better cost-effectiveness for the 9-week initial 
treatment (FinHer) compared to no trastuzumab treatment than for the 1-year 
post-chemotherapy treatment (HERA). Both from a medical and an economic point of 
view, the 9-week initial treatment regimen with trastuzumab shows promising 
results and justifies the initiation of a large comparative trial with a 1-year 
regimen.

BACKGROUND: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a generalised autoimmune disease that 
causes morbidity and reduced life expectancy. Recently, evidence has been 
accumulating that immunosuppressive treatment in an early stage of the disease 
could improve survival, enhancing the need for early diagnosis and regular 
evaluation of organ involvement. Among others, a high-resolution computer 
tomography (HRCT) scan of the chest is performed for the assessment of pulmonary 
involvement in SSc. The objective of this study is to evaluate the predictive 
value of oesophageal dilatation on the HRCT scan for the diagnosis of SSc.
METHODS: In total, 105 consecutive patients with scleroderma and 107 consecutive 
controls were included in this study. The first available scan for each patient 
and control was evaluated in random order and blinded for the diagnosis, by two 
independent radiologists, for oesophageal dilatation and interstitial lung 
disease.
RESULTS: The positive predictive value of oesophageal dilatation for the 
diagnosis of SSc was 83%. No significant correlation of oesophageal dilatation 
and interstitial lung disease was found in the patients with scleroderma or 
controls.
CONCLUSION: Oesophageal dilatation as visible on an HRCT scan of the chest may 
alert doctors to look for other signs or symptoms of SSc in these patients, 
enabling early diagnosis and specific treatment.

How many years of life could be saved if malaria were eliminated from a 
hyperendemic area of northern Ghana?

Malaria is endemic in about 90 countries of the world, half of which are in 
Africa. Little is known about the demographic impact of the disease, however. 
This article uses demographic methods to examine the impact of mortality from 
malaria on overall mortality in a hyperendemic rural African setting. Using 
longitudinal demographic surveillance data from northern Ghana and applying 
multiple decrement and associated single-decrement life-table methods, we 
estimate the total number of person-years that would have been saved had malaria 
been eliminated from the population in 1995, given the age- and cause-specific 
mortality conditions of the period and gains in life expectancy that are 
implied. Results suggest that as many as one third of deaths in this population 
are attributable to malaria, depending on the age group under consideration, and 
that life expectancy at birth would likely increase by more than six years if 
malaria were eliminated as a cause of death.

BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to evaluate the long-term survival rates 
of short dental implants in posterior areas and to analyze the influence of 
different factors on implant survival.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study design was used. A total of 293 subjects 
received 532 short implants between 2001 and 2004. All implants were placed by 
two experienced surgeons, and rehabilitations were done by three 
prosthodontists. Each implant failure was analyzed carefully. The potential 
influence of demographic factors, clinical factors, surgery-dependent factors, 
and prosthetic variables on implant survival was studied. Implant survival was 
analyzed using a life-table analysis (Wilcoxon [Gehan] test).
RESULTS: The overall survival rates of short implants were 99.2% and 98.7% for 
the implant- and subject-based analyses, respectively. The mean follow-up period 
was 31 +/- 12.3 months. Two of 532 implants were lost during the observation 
period. None of the variables studied were statistically associated with implant 
failure.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with short implants can be considered safe and predictable 
if used under strict clinical protocols.

PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of treating ocular hypertension (OHT) 
in the United States.
DESIGN: A Markov model was constructed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with OHT.
METHODS: The health states considered were stable OHT and glaucoma. Practice 
patterns for the model were derived from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study 
(OHTS), and transition probabilities were derived from previous literature. 
Specific unit costs used for medications, patient visits, and diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures were obtained from Blue Cross/Blue Shield. The time 
horizon was 5 years. Costs were discounted at 3% per annum.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Long-term cost effectiveness of treating OHT to prevent 
the development of glaucoma.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for all OHT patients to 
prevent 1 case from progressing to primary open-angle glaucoma was $89,072. 
However, the minimally cost-effective ICER level after adjustment for risk 
factors identified by multivariate analysis in the OHTS were: 20 years above the 
average of 56 years, ICER of $45,155; 4 mmHg above the average pressure of 25 
mmHg, ICER of $46,748; 40 microm less than the average central corneal thickness 
of 573 mum, ICER of $36,683; and a vertical cup-to-disc ratio of 0.2 wider than 
the average of 0.4, ICER of $35,633.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results and practice patterns of the OHTS, treating 
all OHT patients seems not to be cost-effective. However, treating selective OHT 
patients with risk factors identified in the OHTS, for example, advancing age, 
higher pressures, thinner central corneal thickness, and wider vertical 
cup-to-disc ratios, does seem to be cost-effective for preventing the onset of 
glaucomatous damage.

Maryland, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.

Previously we reported that the standardized Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 
extended life span and increased stress resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans. In 
this study, pharmacological modulation of age-dependent muscle degeneration, or 
sarcopenia, was determined. Transgenic C. elegans strain (PD4251) expressing 
green fluorescent protein (GFP)-MYO-3, localized in body wall muscles and vulval 
muscle nuclei, were fed with EGb 761 or Wisconsin Ginseng, and muscle integrity 
was analyzed by quantification of GFP fluorescence. Both EGb 761 and Wisconsin 
Ginseng significantly delayed sarcopenia. Ginseng was more effective in worms of 
more advanced age, which is consistent with the ultrastructural changes observed 
by transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, both agents ameliorated 
age-associated decline of locomotive behaviors including locomotion, body bend, 
and pharyngeal pumping. These results suggest that pharmacological extension of 
life span is a consequence of maintaining functional capacity of the tissue, and 
that C. elegans is a valid model system for testing therapeutic intervention for 
delaying the progress of sarcopenia.

Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA. anna.tosteson@dartmouth.edu

BACKGROUND: The DMIST (Digital Mammography Imaging Screening Trial) reported 
improved breast cancer detection with digital mammography compared with film 
mammography in selected population subgroups, but it did not assess the economic 
value of digital relative to film mammography screening.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of digital mammography screening 
for breast cancer.
DESIGN: Validated, discrete-event simulation model.
DATA SOURCES: Data from DMIST and publicly available U.S. data.
TARGET POPULATION: U.S. women age 40 years or older.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Societal and Medicare.
INTERVENTION: All-film mammography screening; all-digital mammography screening; 
and targeted digital mammography screening, which is age-targeted digital 
mammography (for women <50 years of age) and age- and density-targeted digital 
mammography (for women <50 years of age or women > or =50 years of age with 
dense breasts).
OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: All-digital mammography screening cost $331,000 
(95% CI, $268,000 to $403,000) per QALY gained relative to all-film mammography 
screening but was more costly and less effective than targeted digital 
mammography screening. Targeted digital mammography screening resulted in more 
screen-detected cases of cancer and fewer deaths from cancer than either 
all-film or all-digital mammography screening, with cost-effectiveness estimates 
ranging from $26,500 (CI, $21,000 to $33,000) per QALY gained for age-targeted 
digital mammography to $84,500 (CI, $75,000 to $93,000) per QALY gained for age- 
and density-targeted digital mammography. In the Medicare population, the 
cost-effectiveness of density-targeted digital mammography screening varied from 
a base-case estimate of $97,000 (CI, $77,000 to $131,000) to $257,000 per QALY 
gained (CI, $91,000 to $536,000) in the alternative-case analyses, in which the 
sensitivity of film mammography was increased and the sensitivity of digital 
mammography in women with nondense breasts was decreased.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to the cost of digital 
mammography and to the prevalence of dense breasts.
LIMITATIONS: Results were dependent on model assumptions and DMIST findings.
CONCLUSION: Relative to film mammography, screening for breast cancer by using 
all-digital mammography is not cost-effective. Age-targeted screening with 
digital mammography seems cost-effective, whereas density-targeted screening 
strategies are more costly and of uncertain value, particularly among women age 
65 years or older.

We analyze steady state and out-of-steady-state effects of the transition in 
adult longevity on the national saving rate using historical data and 
international panel data. The rise in adult life expectancy has a large and 
statistically significant effect on aggregate saving. The effects have been 
especially pronounced in East Asia because its mortality transition was very 
rapid. Gains in life expectancy are much more important than declines in child 
dependency. Population aging may not lead to lower saving rates in the future if 
life expectancy and the duration of retirement continue to increase.

Quorum sensing is a cell-density-dependent gene regulation system that allows an 
entire population of bacterial cells to communicate in order to regulate the 
expression of certain or specific genes in a coordinated way depending on the 
size of the population. We present a model of the quorum sensing system in 
Vibrio fischeri using a variant of membrane systems called P systems. In this 
framework each bacterium and the environment are represented by membranes, and 
the rules are applied according to an extension of Gillespie's algorithm called 
the multicompartmental Gillespie's algorithm. This algorithm runs on more than 
one compartment and takes into account the disturbance produced when chemical 
substances diffuse from one compartment or region to another one. Our approach 
allows us to examine the individual behavior of each bacterium as an agent as 
well as the emergent behavior of the colony as a whole and the processes of 
swarming and recruitment. Our simulations show that at low cell densities 
bacteria remain dark, while at high cell densities some bacteria start to 
produce light and a recruitment process takes place that makes the whole colony 
of bacteria do so. Our computational modeling of quorum sensing could provide 
insights leading to new applications where multiple agents need to robustly and 
efficiently coordinate their collective behavior based only on very limited 
information about the local environment.

BACKGROUND: Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is one of the main 
complications observed in patients after organ transplantation. The incidence of 
PTDM in transplant recipients is about 9 times higher than in general 
population. The reported incidence of PTDM varied throughout the years due to 
different diagnostic criteria of diabetes mellitus. Nowadays the rate of PTDM 
amounts to 3-19%.
MATERIALS/METHODS: 1270 patients after kidney transplantation, who remained 
under medical care in the outpatient service at the Transplantation Institute in 
Warsaw, were taken into consideration. The investigated group comprised 207 
patients. 133 of them developed DM that constitutes the incidence of PTDM at 
10.5%.
RESULTS: In the present study several risk factors that are important for PTDM 
development were observed: male gender, HLA A3, family history of DM, increased 
body weight (rather than BMI only), tacrolimus--based immunosuppressive regimen, 
early hyperglycemia. Patients with PTDM developed hypertension more frequently, 
had higher serum triglycerides levels in the period before the onset of 
diabetes. The rate of acute rejection episodes in this group was higher compared 
with the nondiabetic transplant controls. The PTDM group presented with worse 
graft function and higher levels of proteinuria in 1-year observation. 
Tacrolimus--based therapy led to higher peripheral insulin resistance and 
hyperinsulinemia in comparison to cyclosporine--based regimen.
CONCLUSIONS: The proper management of the above described risk factors and the 
right treatment of PTDM may considerably influence life expectancy rate and 
quality of life in transplanted patients.

BACKGROUND: Economic assessments that guide policy making on immunizations are 
becoming increasingly important in light of new and anticipated vaccines for 
adolescents. However, important considerations that limit the utility of these 
assessments, such as the diversity of approaches used, are often overlooked and 
should be better understood.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to examine economic studies of adolescent vaccines and 
compare cost-effectiveness outcomes among studies on a particular vaccine, 
across adolescent vaccines, and between new adolescent vaccines versus vaccines 
that are recommended for young children.
METHODS: A systematic review of economic studies on immunizations for 
adolescents was conducted. Studies were identified by searching the Medline, 
Embase, and EconLit databases. Each study was reviewed for appropriateness of 
model design, baseline setup, sensitivity analyses, and input variables (ie, 
epidemiologic, clinical, cost, and quality-of-life impact). For comparison, the 
cost-effectiveness outcomes reported in key studies on vaccines for younger 
children were selected.
RESULTS: Vaccines for healthy adolescents were consistently found to be more 
costly than the health care or societal cost savings they produced and, in 
general, were less cost-effective than vaccines for younger children. Among the 
new vaccines, pertussis and human papillomavirus vaccines were more 
cost-effective than meningococcal vaccines. Including herd-immunity benefits in 
studies significantly improved the cost-effectiveness estimates for new 
vaccines. Differences in measurements or assumptions limited further 
comparisons.
CONCLUSION: Although using the new adolescent vaccines is unlikely to be 
cost-saving, vaccination programs will result in sizable health benefits.

Course of relational and non-relational recognition memory across the adult 
lifespan.

Human recognition memory shows a decline during normal ageing, which is thought 
to be related to age-associated dysfunctions of mediotemporal lobe structures. 
Whether the hippocampus is critical for human general relational memory or for 
spatial relational memory only is still disputed. The human perirhinal cortex is 
thought to be critically involved in non-relational memory, but another view 
postulates hippocampal involvement in both relational and non-relational memory. 
Investigating whether there is a differential impact of ageing on these memory 
processes may shed further light into these issues. Thus, in the present study, 
106 healthy adults performed three recognition memory tasks in a consecutive age 
groups design involving a range from age 20 to 76. This allowed the separate 
assessment of spatial and nonspatial relational memory as well as non-relational 
memory. Both spatial and nonspatial relational memory declined in the 66-76 yr 
group. This pattern is consistent with the presumed course of hippocampal 
changes across normal ageing and points to the hippocampal role in relational 
memory in general. An impairment of non-relational memory commenced earlier in 
the 51-65 yr group. This finding is discussed in relation to 
perceptual/attentional mediation of memory and its potential brain correlates in 
ageing.

Toronto, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To examine long-term outcomes and survival of patients after 
bilateral transtibial amputation (BTTA).
DESIGN: A retrospective chart review and a cross-sectional interview was 
conducted at Amputee Rehabilitation Service, West Park Healthcare Centre, 
Toronto, Canada, with consecutive diabetic or vascular BTTA patients (n = 82) 
admitted for rehabilitation from 1998 to 2003. Main outcome measures included 
the Houghton scale of prosthetic use, SF-12, Frenchay Activities Index, and 
qualitative measurement of activities of daily living (ADL).
RESULTS: Of 82 patients admitted for BTTA rehabilitation, 34 patients were 
interviewed an average of 3.7 yrs after amputation. Another 32 patients had 
died. Life expectancy was 4.2 yrs beyond rehabilitation discharge (Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis). The mean modified Houghton score at telephone follow-up was 
6.3 (maximum score of 9), with a significant improvement from rehabilitation 
discharge to follow-up (P = 0.001). Eighty-five percent were still wearing 
prostheses regularly and were walking. Most remained independent in ADLs.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing rehabilitation for BTTA continue to do well at 
long-term follow-up and to survive, on average, for more than 4 yrs after 
discharge. Therefore, they should be given strong consideration for prosthetic 
fitting.

Rapid increase in human life expectancy: will it soon be limited by the aging of 
elastin?

The postponement of the most frequent age-related diseases stimulated 
speculations of the possibility of "dying of old age". The selective decline of 
individual physiological functions-aging in spare-parts-indicates however the 
potential limitation of the life-span by the rapid decline of some of the vital 
parameters. We explored a possibility of such a limitation of maximal life-span 
by the age-related alteration of elastin, consisting in Ca-accumulation, lipid 
deposition and elastolytic degradation. The quantitative evaluation of these 
processes suggests an approximative upper limit for the elastic properties of 
the cardio-respiratory system of about 100-120 years, at least, as far as 
elastin is involved. This process, age-related alterations of elastic fibers, is 
however not the only one limiting the functional value of the cardiovascular 
system. Crosslinking of collagen fibers by advanced glycation end-products 
certainly contributes also to the age-dependent rigidification of the 
cardiovascular system. Therefore the answer to the initial question, can 
age-dependent alterations of a single matrix macromolecule be limiting such 
vital functions as the cardio-respiratory system-is a cautious yes, with however 
the caveat that other, independent mechanisms, such as the Maillard reaction, 
can also interfere with and limit further the functional value of such vital 
physiological functions.

Radiotherapy and radiosurgery in acromegaly.

Growth-hormone hypersecretion, acromegaly, is associated with reduced life 
expectancy. First line treatment remains surgery, but remission rates vary 
between 50% and 90%. In case of lack of surgical remission or recurrence, 
somatostatin agonists can be proposed. However, about 30% of patients are 
partially or totally resistant to this treatment. The growth hormone receptor 
antagonist pegvisomant currently needs more prolonged follow-up studies. 
Conventional radiotherapy and radiosurgery are two radiation treatment 
modalities that can be proposed to these resistant patients. Reported rates of 
remission for conventional radiotherapy range between 50% and 60% in patients 
with acromegaly, with a time to remission delayed by several years, and adverse 
effects including high rates of hypopituitarism. This treatment could be 
proposed to patients with aggressive adenomas, in whom surgery cannot allow 
biochemical control. In contrast, studies on stereotactic radiosurgery reported 
lower rates of remission, with faster growth hormone hypersecretion decline, and 
a lower risk of adverse effects. However, this latter technique requires a well 
defined target volume, which limits its indications. The high precision of this 
technique makes it possible to be used as an alternative primary treatment to 
surgery. We reviewed major advantages and drawbacks of each of these techniques, 
based on recent studies to try to define their respective indications in the 
therapeutic algorithm of acromegaly.
