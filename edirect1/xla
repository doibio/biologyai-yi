OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnosis of vena caval thrombosis (VCT) in patients 
with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as an independent indicator of prognostic 
importance and when combined with additional tumour characteristics in a 
controlled multivariate analysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical course of 53 patients (41 men and 12 women, 
mean age 60 years, range 35-79) with RCC and VCT was compared with that of a 
control group of 47 patients (37 men and 10 women, mean age 57 years, range 
32-76) with RCC but no neoplastic extension into the vena cava.
RESULTS: With a follow-up of 1-154 months and a mean long-term survival of 32 
and 35 months, respectively, for patients with and without VCT, neither the 
propagation of the tumour into the vena cava (P = 0.391) nor the cranial 
extension of the thrombosis (P = 0.158) were identified as having any prognostic 
value during univariate or multivariate statistical analysis. The presence of 
regional lymph node (P < 0.001) or distant metastases (P = 0.009) was an 
independent prognostic variable for patients with RCC, with a significant 
decrease in long-term survival (13 and 14 months for patients with lymph node 
and distant metastases, respectively).
CONCLUSION: A radical surgical approach is essential as standard therapy for the 
treatment of patients with RCC and neoplastic extension into the vena cava. 
Because they have a significantly decreased life expectancy, asymptomatic 
patients with lymph node or distant metastases should be treated conservatively.

Patient dropout in an assisted reproductive technology program: implications for 
pregnancy rates.

Land JA(1), Courtar DA, Evers JL.

Author information:
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Academisch Ziekenhuis Maastricht, 
The Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE: To study patient dropout and its impact on crude and cumulative 
pregnancy rates (PRs) after assisted reproductive technology (ART).
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: University hospital-based tertiary care fertility clinic.
PATIENT(S): Two hundred two couples applying for their first ART treatment 
cycle.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Drop-out rate and PR per cycle, cumulative drop-out 
rate and cumulative PR.
RESULT(S): After three treatment cycles, the cumulative drop-out rate was 126 of 
202 (62.4%); 13.9% (n = 28) was due to active censoring. Active censoring was 
shown to flatter cumulative PRs by life-table analysis.
CONCLUSION: Dropout from ART is high, even when ART costs are covered by health 
cost insurance. Life-table analysis overestimates cumulative PRs in ART.

METHODS: From January 1980 to December 1993, 52 patients underwent 
surgical-resection for tumors involving the sternum. The series included 20 
primary malignant tumors, 4 desmoid tumors, 2 malignant tumors infiltrating the 
sternum from adjacent organs, 19 local recurrences or metastases of breast 
tumors, and 7 metastases of other tumors. Total sternectomy was performed in 5 
patients, subtotal sternal resection in 19, and partial resection (less than 50% 
of the sternum) in 28. Concurrent en bloc resection included anterior ribs in 37 
patients, clavicle in 11, lung in 12 patients, pericardium in 7, and diaphragm 
in 2. The chest was reconstructed with prosthetic material and a myocutaneous 
flap in 26 patients (50%), prosthetic material only in 12 patients (23%), a 
myocutaneous flap in 5 patients (10%), and other techniques in the remaining 
patients. In 47 patients (90%) the resection was radical, and in the remaining 5 
patients it was palliative.
RESULTS: No perioperative deaths occurred. After a median follow-up of 39 
months, the overall 3-year survival was 58% and the 5-year survival 46%, with a 
median survival of 50 months. In 24 patients with primary tumor the 5-year 
survival after radical resection was 63%, and in 23 patients with secondary 
invasion (direct extension or metastasis) the 5-year survival was 38% (median 35 
months). In recurrent breast cancer the 5-year survival was 48% in patients with 
direct extension to the chest wall and 60% in patients with distant bone 
metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrates that sternal resection is a safe and 
effective treatment, which may improve the patient's quality of life and achieve 
a long-term survival not only in primary tumors but also in selected secondary 
malignant tumors of the sternum.

Immunosuppression for human saphenous vein allograft bypass surgery: a 
prospective randomized trial.

Carpenter JP(1), Tomaszewski JE.

Author information:
(1)Department of Surgery, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, 
Philadelphia 19104, USA.

PURPOSE: Vein allografts are an alternative bypass conduit for patients who lack 
adequate autogenous vein. Animal studies have demonstrated that patency can be 
augmented by low-dose immunosuppression with azathioprine.
METHODS: In a prospective trial, 40 patients (20 men, 20 women) were randomly 
assigned to receive (17) or to not receive (23) azathioprine (1 mg/kg/day) after 
cryopreserved vein allograft bypass grafting. Patients had pain or tissue loss 
that required bypass grafting to pedal or crural outflow and lacked adequate 
autogenous saphenous vein. Anti-HLA antibody screens were obtained before and 
after surgery. Biopsies of allografts were performed at implantation and at all 
subsequent opportunities. Postoperative physical and vascular laboratory 
examinations occurred every 3 months.
RESULTS: During the 31-months follow-up interval (mean, 15.7 months) there were 
10 deaths (none immunosuppression-related). The primary graft patency rate at 12 
months was 13%, and the limb salvage rate was 42%. No significant difference (p 
> 0.05) was noted between immunosuppressed and control groups for mortality 
rate, primary graft patency rate, or limb salvage rate. As a predictor of graft 
failure, positive preoperative anti-HLA antibody screen (8 patients) approached 
significance (p = 0.09). Of 22 explanted grafts, 13 (59%) had histologic 
evidence of rejection (six immunosuppressed, seven control). Seven patients who 
had negative results of preoperative anti-HLA antibody screens converted after 
surgery, and six patients had positive results of preoperative screens that 
became more strongly positive.
CONCLUSION: Vein allograft failure is in part mediated by rejection, which is 
not eliminated by low-dose azathioprine. Both humoral (antibody) and cellular 
responses to vein allografts develop. The poor patency rates of vein allograft 
bypass grafts may be improved by more potent immunosuppression as well as 
improvement in allograft procurement, preservation, and matching.

Duplex imaging findings predict stenosis after carotid endarterectomy.

Golledge J(1), Cuming R, Ellis M, Davies AH, Greenhalgh RM.

Author information:
(1)Department of Surgery, Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, London.

PURPOSE: This study was performed to determine whether early duplex findings 
predicted restenosis after carotid endarterectomy.
METHODS: One hundred ninety-two symptomatic patients who underwent carotid 
endarterectomy were studied with color duplex imaging at 1 day and 1 week after 
surgery to identify minor residual disease (causing < 50% stenosis), arterial 
kinking, and suture stricture, and to measure the external and luminal diameters 
of the carotid bulb and distal internal carotid artery. Patients were then 
observed prospectively with duplex surveillance for a median of 24 months to 
identify > 50% restenosis.
RESULTS: Twenty-five stenoses > 50% of the operated carotid artery (13%) were 
identified, four at 1 day (residual) and 21 at a median follow-up of 6 months 
(restenosis). On multiple logistic regression analysis, > 50% restenosis was 
found to be associated with minor day-1 residual stenosis (p = 0.01) and with 
small luminal diameter of the distal internal carotid artery (p = 0.03) as 
measured 1 week after carotid endarterectomy. Life table analysis showed 
restenosis at 24 months to be more common for patients with below-median than 
patients with above-median carotid bulb external diameter (18% vs 5%, 
respectively; p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Duplex scanning within a week of carotid endarterectomy identifies 
> 50% residual stenosis, in addition to minor residual 25% to 50% stenosis and 
small carotid dimensions, which are good predictors of > 50% restenosis at 6 
months.

Upper extremity central venous obstruction in hemodialysis patients: treatment 
with Wallstents.

Author information:
(1)Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, 
Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.

PURPOSE: To determine the effectiveness of using Wallstents to treat subclavian 
or brachiocephalic venous obstruction after unsuccessful angioplasty, in 
patients undergoing hemodialysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dialysis records, radiology reports, and procedural 
images of 20 hemodialysis patients who underwent Wallstent insertion into a 
subclavian (n = 11) or brachiocephalic (n = 9) vein were reviewed. Technical 
success and primary, assisted primary, and cumulative patency rates were 
calculated.
RESULTS: Twenty-three Wallstents were inserted for stenosis (n = 18) or 
occlusion (n = 2). Technical success was 100%. Eight patients underwent 11 
reinterventions to maintain patency of the Wallstent during the follow-up 
period. Patency rates of the Wallstent were (a) primary at 1 month, 3 months, 6 
months, and 1 year: 90%, 67%, 42%, and 25%; (b) assisted primary at 3 months, 6 
months, and 1 year: 88%, 62%, and 47%; and (c) cumulative at 3 months, 6 months, 
1 year, and 2 years: 89%, 64%, 56%, and 22%. Considerable shortening of the 
stent occurred in five patients. One occurred immediately during the deployment 
procedure, but four were discovered weeks to months later. No other 
complications occurred.
CONCLUSION: After suboptimal angioplasty, treatment of subclavian and 
brachiocephalic vein stenoses with a Wallstent can provide continued use of a 
hemodialysis access. Close clinical surveillance and multiple reinterventions 
are necessary to maintain Wallstent patency.

Silva EG.

Author information:
(1)Department of Gynecologic Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer 
Center, Houston 77030, USA.

OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to determine the molecular profile of advanced-stage 
transitional cell carcinoma in terms of immunostaining for p53, epidermal growth 
factor receptor and HER-2/neu, deoxyribonucleic acid index, and S-phase fraction 
and to analyze the prognostic significance of these markers.
STUDY DESIGN: Archival paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from 29 advanced stage 
transitional cell carcinomas were obtained. Selected sections of the primary 
tumors were immunostained for p53, epidermal growth factor receptor, and 
HER-2/neu; deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy and S-phase fraction were determined 
with use of flow cytometry. Clinical information was abstracted from the medical 
records. Survival times were analyzed according to the life-table methods of 
Kaplan and Meier, and the statistical significance of the various factors was 
tested with the log-rank test. The proportional hazards model of Cox was used to 
identify prognostic factors.
RESULTS: Positive immunostaining was observed for p53 in 13 cases (45%), for 
epidermal growth factor receptor in 14 cases (50%), and for HER-2/neu in 19 
cases (65%). Tumors were diploid in 16 cases (55%) and aneuploid in 13 (45%). 
The S-phase fraction was < or = 15% (mean) in 13 cases (45%) and > 15% in 16 
cases (55%). The median survival for the entire group was 52 months. None of the 
above variables had a significant effect on survival time.
CONCLUSION: Neither immunostaining for p53, epidermal growth factor receptor, 
and HER-2/neu nor deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy nor S-phase fraction allowed us 
to distinguish transitional cell carcinoma from other more common epithelial 
ovarian cancers. In addition, no prognostic significance was associated with 
these biomarkers. A study of larger numbers of cases may be more elucidative.

Ultraviolet radiation revisited.

Bergmanson JP(1), Sheldon TM.

Author information:
(1)Texas Eye Research and Technology, University of Houston College of Optometry 
77204-6052, USA.

PURPOSE AND METHODS: It is likely that we currently receive a greater lifetime 
exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) than earlier generations due to 
increased UVR reaching the earth's surface, our longer life expectancy, and 
increased activities in UV intense environments. This elevated UVR exposure is 
likely to lead to a higher incidence of acute and chronic ocular and skin 
radiation trauma. We reviewed the evidence in the current literature supporting 
these assertions as well as reports of preventive strategies for blocking UVR.
RESULTS: Hawaii is the most UV-intense location on earth as it has the lowest 
ozone thickness values ever recorded outside the Antarctic zone. It is 
anticipated that the overall ozone depletion will continue into the next 
millennium. Significant evidence suggests a correlation between UVR exposure and 
conjunctival pterygium, photokeratitis, climatic droplet keratopathy and 
cataracts. The incidence of skin cancer is also on the rise as a result of the 
increased amount of UVR reaching the earth secondary to the thinning ozone.
CONCLUSIONS: There are compelling reasons to counsel our patients on the adverse 
effects of UVR and to offer them the various options available for UV 
protection. Sunglasses and UV blocking ophthalmic lenses traditionally have been 
the most commonly selected forms of UVR protection. The UV blocking hydrogel 
contact lens, a recent addition to our armamentarium, is a means of blocking 
UVR.

Economic and health state utility determinations for schizophrenic patients 
treated with risperidone or haloperidol.

Chouinard G(1), Albright PS.

Author information:
(1)Department of Psychiatry, University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

The current study uses utility analysis to assess economic and quality-of-life 
benefits of risperidone in patients with chronic schizophrenia. A retrospective 
analysis was performed on Positive and Negative Syndrome Symptoms (PANSS) data 
obtained from the published Canadian multicenter risperidone trial (part of the 
North American trial). Cluster analysis applied to endpoint PANSS scores, 
including all patients (N = 135), identified three clusters representing 130 
patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptomatology. A narrative health 
state profile was written for each cluster, and 100 psychiatric nurses from 
Washington, DC, were asked to assign preference ratings to each one using linear 
analog and standard gamble (SG) methods. Mean utility values (confidence 
interval 95%) obtained from the SG ratings for the three health state profiles 
were 0.61 +/- 0.069 (mild); 0.36 +/- 0.073 (moderate); and 0.29 +/- 0.071 
(severe). The mild health state (including the majority of risperidone 6 
mg-treated patients) was rated by nurses to have a 0.25 +/- 0.0501 greater 
utility than the moderate health state (composed of the majority of 
haloperidol-treated patients). The results of these utility evaluations (SG) by 
the nurses were related to the clinical outcome for three of the six drug 
treatment groups (N = 65) by multiplying the percentage of patients in each of 
the three clusters, both at baseline and end-point, who were receiving 
risperidone 6 mg/day, haloperidol, or placebo, by the utility value for the 
health state assigned to that cluster. The gain in utility for 
risperidone-treated patients was 2.6 times higher (0.125) compared with 
haloperidol-treated patients (0.049), and 7 times higher compared with placebo 
(-0.021). After multiplying the gain in utility of each treatment by the 
remaining expected life span for men and women, it was found that 
risperidone-treated patients obtained more than twice as many quality-adjusted 
years as haloperidol patients. The incremental drug treatment cost divided by 
the incremental benefit of risperidone versus haloperidol was found to yield a 
favorable, generally accepted cost-utility ratio.

Cell cycle response to DNA damage differs in bronchial epithelial cells and lung 
fibroblasts.

Gadbois DM(1), Lehnert BE.

Author information:
(1)Life Sciences Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico 87545, 
USA.

Epithelial cells along the conducting airways can be more or less continuously 
exposed to DNA-damaging agents, which should limit their proliferation by 
inducing cell cycle checkpoints. Yet, paradoxically, airway epithelial cells 
frequently show a hyperplastic response when exposed to such agents. In this in 
vitro study, we assessed the hypothesis that normal human bronchial epithelial 
cells (BECs) are more resistant to the cell cycle-arresting effects of DNA 
damage than are human lung fibroblasts (HLFs), a cell type often investigated in 
the context of cell cycle checkpoints. Using ionizing radiation as a 
DNA-damaging insult, we have found that BECs indeed show less pronounced G1 and 
G2 delays than do fibroblasts. Unlike the HLFs, which ultimately enter a 
condition of apparently terminal arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, BECs 
continue proliferating following their initial, transient G1 and G2 delays. 
Radiation-induced p53 and p21Cip1 increases were greater in HLFs than in BECs, 
whereas preexposure, basal levels of p53 were higher in BECs than in HLFs. The 
results of this investigation indicate that BECs may be less susceptible to the 
cell cycle-arresting effects of DNA-damaging agents, perhaps because of their 
higher basal levels of p53. Extension of these findings to the in vivo condition 
provides a possible explanation for airway epithelial cell hyperplastic 
responses that occur in a background of DNA-damaging stresses. Moreover, the 
attenuated DNA damage-induced, cell cycle checkpoint responses in BECs 
potentially may favor the transmission of DNA lesions to cell progeny.

The improved outcome of acquired aplastic anemia (AA) has revealed later 
complications, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous 
leukemia (AML). We retrospectively analyzed 167 children with severe acquired 
AA. Eleven of 50 children treated with cyclosporin (CSA) and recombinant human 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) developed MDS/AML; 8 of these 
were within 36 months of the diagnosis of AA, much earlier than previous 
reports. Six of the 11 children received rhG-CSF exceeding 10 microg/kg/d, and 9 
received rhG-CSF therapy for over 1 year. Ten children showed monosomy 7 at 
diagnosis of MDS. All of the 11 children were administered both CSA and rhG-CSF. 
There was no development of MDS/AML among 41 children treated with either CSA or 
rhG-CSF or among 48 children who underwent bone marrow transplantation. A 
well-controlled clinical trial is warranted to determine whether therapeutic 
modalities affect the development of MDS/AML in children with severe acquired 
AA.

High levels of Wilms' tumor gene (wt1) mRNA in acute myeloid leukemias are 
associated with a worse long-term outcome.

D.

Germany.

The tumor suppressor gene wt1 (Wilms' tumor gene) encodes for a zinc finger 
DNA-binding protein with predominantly transcription repressing properties. 
Because wt1 has been shown to be expressed in the vast majority of patients with 
acute myeloid leukemias (AML), we investigated the relevance of wt-1 mRNA 
expression regarding prognosis and possible prediction of relapse during 
follow-up. Totally bone marrow-derived blasts of 139 AML patients (129 newly 
diagnosed AML patients, 22 AML patients again in first relapse, and 10 AML 
patients analyzed primarily in first relapse) were studied for wt1 mRNA 
expression. Seventy-seven patients were analyzed for wt1 mRNA expression during 
follow-up. wt1-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
was performed and the amplification product was visually classified as not, 
weakly, moderately, or strongly amplified, as described previously. PCR products 
were quantitated by competitive PCR using a shortened homologous wt1 construct 
standard in representative cases. The expression of wt1 transcripts was 
correlated to age, French-American-British (FAB) subtype, phenotype, karyotype, 
and long-term survival. wt1 mRNA was detectable in 124 of 161 (77%) samples at 
diagnosis and in first relapse. wt1 expression was independent from age, 
antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome or FAB subtype, with the exception of a 
significant difference in M5 leukemias showing wt1 transcripts in only 40% (P = 
.0025). There was no correlation between the level of wt1 mRNA and response to 
treatment or the prognostic groups defined by the karyotype. Concerning 
long-term survival, patients with high levels of wt1 had a significantly worse 
overall survival (OS) than those with not detectable or low levels. The 3-year 
OS for all newly diagnosed AMLs was 13% and 38% (P = .038), respectively, and 
12% and 43% (P = .014) for de novo AMLs. The difference was more distinct in 
patients less than 60 years of age. During follow-up, all patients achieving 
complete remission became wt1 negative. Reoccurrence of wt1 transcripts 
predicted relapse. The data indicate that high expression of wt1 mRNA is 
associated with a worse long-term prognosis.

During the last decades, improvements in the median survival time in patients 
with metastasized carcinoma of the mamma were hardly achieved. There ist still a 
lack of evidence that the increase in the rate of remissions due to conventional 
chemotherapy leads to an improvement in survival time. In 450 female patients 
with metastasized carcinoma of the mamma, the survival time was analyzed with 
the begin of the metastatic spread in relation to the treatment success of the 
first palliative chemotherapy. The survival time of the responder group was not 
significantly different to the group with a stationary tumor (p = 0.5). As 
patients with primary hormone therapy were included, this result changed if 
patients only with prognostically unfavorable characteristics (high-risk group) 
were selected, which received primarily and exclusively a cytostatic 
chemotherapy. The responder only (partial and complete responder) are profitting 
from the chemotherapy with a significant increase in survival time in comparison 
to the group with a stationary tumor (p = 0.02 and p = 0.006). Therefore, a 
stationary tumor in the high risk group is a result as bad as tumor progression.

BACKGROUND: Renal failure requiring dialysis in the setting of hospitalization 
for serious illness is a poor prognostic sign, and dialysis and aggressive care 
are sometimes withheld.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of 
initiating dialysis and continuing aggressive care for seriously ill 
hospitalized patients.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study and cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: Five geographically diverse teaching hospitals.
PATIENTS: 490 patients (median age, 61 years; 58% women) enrolled in the Study 
to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments 
(SUPPORT) in whom dialysis was initiated.
MEASUREMENTS: Survival, functional status, quality of life, and health care 
costs. Life expectancy was estimated by extrapolating survival data (up to 4.4 
years of follow-up) using a declining exponential function. Utilities 
(quality-of-life weights) were estimated by using time-tradeoff questions. Costs 
were based on data from SUPPORT and published Medicare data.
RESULTS: Median duration of survival was 32 days, and only 27% of patients were 
alive after 5 months. Survivors reported a median of one dependency in 
activities of daily living, and 62% rated their quality of life as "good" or 
better. Overall, the estimated cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved by 
initiating dialysis and continuing aggressive care rather than withholding 
dialysis and allowing death to occur was $128,200. For the 103 patients in the 
worst prognostic category, the estimated cost per quality-adjusted life-year was 
$274,100; for the 94 patients in the best prognostic category, the cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year was $61,900.
CONCLUSIONS: For the few patients who survived, clinical outcomes were fairly 
good. With the exception of patients with the best prognoses, however, the 
cost-effectiveness of initiating dialysis and continuing aggressive care far 
exceeded $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, a commonly cited threshold for 
cost-effective care.

During recent years, clinical research on the donor site morbidity after free or 
pedicled transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap surgery has been 
focusing on the reduced flexion capacity of the abdominal wall. However, the 
rectus abdominis muscles have close interactions with their synergists and 
antagonists and collaborate with their neighbouring muscles. The purpose of this 
study was to examine the consequences of partially resecting the rectus 
abdominis muscle on the different muscle groups of the abdominal wall. Twenty 
free TRAM flap patients, 12-61 months (mean 32.1 months) after surgery, were 
clinically examined, evaluated for curl-up performance and underwent isokinetic 
dynamometry for flexion, extension and rotation. The patients were compared with 
20 non-operated controls. Nineteen patients answered a questionnaire. Abdominal 
wall abnormalities occurred in 10 patients: umbilical asymmetry (n = 3), 
abdominal wall asymmetry (n = 4), lower abdominal bulging (n = 2) and hernia (n 
= 1). Curl-up performance was less in the TRAM flap patients (P = 0.001, 
Mann-Whitney). Isokinetic flexion, extension and rotation were also less in the 
TRAM flap patients (Fisher's exact test). This study indicates that what has 
been believed to be 'limited' surgical damage to the abdominal wall leads to an 
important reduction in flexion strength but to an even more important reduction 
of rotation strength due to bilateral displacement and damage of the insertion 
of the oblique muscles. Partial compensation by synergists is variable and 
unpredictable on an individual basis. These functional disorders can potentially 
lead to important changes in activities of daily life.

    Gut. 1998 Jan;42(1):144-5.

BACKGROUND: Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis are not only at high 
risk of developing adenomas in the colorectum but a substantial number of 
patients also develop polyps in the duodenum. Because treatment of duodenal 
polyps is extremely difficult and it is unknown how many patients ultimately 
develop duodenal cancer, the value of surveillance of the upper digestive tract 
is uncertain.
AIMS: (1) To assess the cumulative risk of duodenal cancer in a large series of 
polyposis patients. (2) To develop a decision model to establish whether 
surveillance would lead to increased life expectancy.
METHODS: Risk analysis was performed in 155 Dutch polyposis families including 
601 polyposis patients, and 142 Danish families including 376 patients. 
Observation time was from birth until date of last contact, death, diagnosis of 
duodenal cancer, or closing date of the study.
RESULTS: Seven Dutch and five Danish patients developed duodenal cancer. The 
lifetime risk of developing this cancer by the age of 70 was 4% (95% confidence 
interval 1-7%) in the Dutch series and 3% (95% confidence interval 0-6%) in the 
Danish series. Decision analysis showed that surveillance led to an increase in 
life expectancy by seven months.
CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance of the upper digestive tract led to a moderate gain in 
life expectancy. Future studies should evaluate whether this increase in life 
expectancy outweighs the morbidity of endoscopic examination and proximal 
pancreaticoduodenectomy.

Maintenance treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. A 
placebo-controlled evaluation of 10 milligrams omeprazole once daily in general 
practice.

Coldfield, West Midlands, England.

BACKGROUND: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a frequent cause for 
consultation in general practice and is a chronically relapsing disease.
METHODS: This general practice study was a 6-month randomized, double-blind 
parallel-group placebo-controlled assessment of the efficacy and safety of 
continuous treatment with 10 mg omeprazole every morning after initial symptom 
control in 495 patients with GORD but without erosive oesophagitis.
RESULTS: On the basis of life-table estimates for cumulative relapse rates, 
patients in the placebo group (52%) were almost twice as likely as those in the 
omeprazole group (27%) to discontinue therapy before 24 weeks because of 
inadequate relief of heartburn or for other reasons including adverse events 
(all-patients-treated analysis, log rank test, P = 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that 10 mg omeprazole once daily is an 
effective and well-tolerated treatment strategy in general practice for the 
long-term management of symptoms of GORD in patients without erosive 
oesophagitis.

Thirty-four implantable ports were consecutively implanted in 27 AIDS patients 
(mean CD4 lymphocyte count: 39/mm3) from January 1993 to December 1995. We 
observed 33 complications in these patients. Perioperative complications 
included: one pneumothorax (3%), one haematothorax (3%) and one septic shock 
(3%). Later complications included one venous thrombosis (3%) and 26 infectious 
complications (79%). Fever of unknown origin was observed in three patients 
(9%). A total of 19 bacteremias occurred in 12 patients. The global rate of 
infection for 100 catheter-days was 0.51 for a total of 5,096 catheter-days. The 
following microorganisms were isolated: Staphylococcus (n = 21; 72%), 
Pseudomonas (n = 3; 11%) and others (n = 5; 17%). Thirty-eight percent of the 
ports (n = 13) were removed, after a mean of 89 days. During the study, 21 
patients died. Two patients died from a catheter infection with septic shock 
(8%). It seems to be important to clearly define the indications of implantable 
infusions ports in AIDS patients with respect to their life expectancy.

Ki-67, p53, Er-receptors, ploidy and S-phase as prognostic factors in T1 node 
negative breast cancer.

The prognostic value of Ki-67, p53 and ER immunohistochemical labelling and 
flow-cytometric S-phase fraction and ploidy was evaluated in 212 pT1N0M0 breast 
carcinomas. The mean follow-up time was 8.3 years. Patients with breast 
carcinomas with high Ki-67 expression (> or = 10%) had a less favourable 
disease-free survival than those with low Ki-67 expression (< 10%) (p = 0.008). 
A positive p53 staining and high SPF were associated with a less favourable 
disease-free survival although it did not reach statistical significance. The 
subset of patients with ER negative, Ki-67 > or = 10% and p53 > or = 20% 
tumours, had a shorter disease-free survival compared with that of all the other 
patients (p = 0.03). We conclude that the potential value of Ki-67 labelling for 
prognostic evaluation of T1N0M0 breast carcinoma is good.

State of the art--treatment of peripheral occlusive arterial disease (POAD) with 
drugs vs. vascular reconstruction or amputation.

Haustein KO(1).

Author information:
(1)Klinikum der Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena, Germany.

Peripheral occlusive arterial disease (POAD) is a disease with a progressive 
course in about half of the patients affected. The Fontaine stage II and III 
have been treated not always successfully in the last decades with physical 
exercise, vasoactive substances (pentoxifyllin, naftidrofuryl, buflomedil) and 
with alprostadil. Recently methods of vascular surgery such as PTA, stent 
implantation and bypass operations are introduced in the treatment of Fontaine 
POAD stages III and IV, but these procedures are not recommended in patients 
younger than 50 years in order to delay amputation of a limb. The vasoactive 
substances are seen in a new light, because they improve processes of the 
microcirculation such as decreasing plasma viscosity, the raised plasma 
fibrinogen level and increasing the deformability of red blood cells and 
inhibiting platelet aggregation. According to a number of studies pentoxifylline 
and naftidrofuryl may delay the progression of arteriosclerosis. Therefore, a 
new concept of the treatment of POAD must be evaluated (1) resulting in a 
combination of vascular surgery and intermittent drug therapy with vasoactive 
agents, (2) leading to a decrease in the risk of amputation frequency and (3) 
reducing the treatment costs in spite of a higher frequency of the disease and a 
longer average life expectancy.

Likely gains in life expectancy of patients with coronary artery disease treated 
with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, as predicted by a decision analysis model.

Kellett J(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, Nenagh Hospital, County Tipperary, Ireland.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the likely gains in life expectancy of patients with 
coronary artery disease treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors based on 
published reports and the results of the 4S and the West of Scotland Study.
DESIGN: Decision analysis.
MAIN OUTCOME: Four likely scenarios of the effect of treatment with HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitors on the life expectancy of medically and surgically managed 
coronary artery disease were modelled.
RESULTS: Regardless of the scenario, treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 
was estimated to provide a gain in life expectancy for medically managed 
patients of all ages with coronary artery disease, ranging from 4.6 to 10.1 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for a 40 year old with three vessel disease 
(depending on the scenario assumed), to 0.2 QALYs for a 80 year old with two 
vessel disease. These gains were always greater than those predicted after 
bypass alone. If the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors produces the same 
reduction in cardiac mortality after bypass as it does in medically managed 
patients it will increase the benefits of operation except for patients with two 
vessel disease over 70 years of age. Conversely, if HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 
do not influence the course of coronary artery disease after bypass, the 
benefits of operation over medical treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 
are either reduced or lost completely, ranging from a loss of -5.6 QALYs for a 
40 year old with two vessel disease to a gain of 1.5 QALYs for 55 to 60 year old 
patients with left main stem disease.
CONCLUSION: Although their effect on the progression of coronary artery disease 
after bypass must be defined, it is probable that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 
will produce considerable gains in life expectancy for patients with coronary 
artery disease.

Lidocaine pharmacokinetics and toxicity in newborn pigs.

Satas S(1), Johannessen SI, Hoem NO, Haaland K, Sørensen DR, Thoresen M.

Author information:
(1)The Institute of Surgical Research, the National Hospital, Oslo, Norway.

In newborn infants suffering from perinatal asphyxia seizures, lidocaine (LD) 
has proved to be an effective anticonvulsant. At high concentrations, however, 
LD can itself cause convulsions. The convulsive concentration of LD (LD(conv)) 
varies among species. The aim of this study was to describe LD pharmacokinetics 
and to define the LD(conv) in awake newborn pigs. Eighteen Land race newborn 
pigs aged 12-60 h, weight 1.0-2.5 kg, were enrolled. LD, 2 mg/kg intravenous 
(IV) bolus, (n = 11) was given to estimate pharmacokinetic variables. Continuous 
LD infusion 2 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) IV (n = 5) and repeated bolus doses of 15 
mg/kg (n = 4) were given until electroencephalogram-confirmed seizures appeared. 
After the bolus injection, the elimination half-life for LD was 0.87-5.44 h. 
Increasing plasma concentration (LD(pl)) during infusion resulted in sedation 
after 5-10 min and in shivering, nystagmus, neck extension, tonic-clonic 
seizures at LD(conv) of 40.6 +/- 12.7 mg/L (mean +/- SD). The unbound LD(pl) at 
seizures was 4.4 +/- 2.4 mg/L. Younger animals convulsed at higher LD(conv) (r2 
= 0.85). LD pharmacokinetics in newborn pigs were found to be dose-dependent at 
high plasma concentrations. At lower plasma concentrations, LD pharmacokinetics 
appeared to be linear. The central nervous system is the primary target for the 
toxic effect of LD in awake newborn pigs. LD neurotoxicity is age-dependent, and 
younger pigs convulse at a higher LD(conv).

Treatment of multiple myeloma and acute myelogenous leukemia in the elderly: an 
update.

Aviano, Italy.

The optimal management of hematopoietic malignancies in the elderly requires the 
development of specific therapeutic strategies based on the peculiar 
clinico-biologic features of aged patients. Multiple myeloma arising in elderly 
patients remains at this time an incurable disease, while attention to 
supportive therapy and palliation can make a great impact on the quality of 
life. Fortunately advances have been made in last years in this field. Therapy 
at the time of diagnosis is usually recommended for patients with symptomatic 
disease, or for those who may be asymptomatic, but have evidence of high tumor 
burden of a biologically aggressive disease, and may be expected to progress and 
develop complications over a short period of time. Melphalan combined with 
prednisone remains the standard therapy choice in elderly patients. Radiotherapy 
maintains an important place in the palliation of destructive bone disease in 
poorly controlled myeloma, particularly in elderly patients. In Acute 
Myelogenous Leukemia, age has been concordantly reported as an adverse 
prognostic indicator in affecting both remission rates and survival. The overall 
unsatisfactory therapeutic results appear connected with host-related factors, 
and intrinsic differences in the biology of leukemia. Patients with standard 
risk should be included in collaborative trials aimed at improving the long-term 
results of conventional therapy. Patients with high risk and unfavorable 
prognostic factors, could be enrolled in controlled studies aimed at better 
assessing, in the elderly, the long term results of newer drug combinations. A 
watch and wait strategy, consisting of transfusion support and leukocytosis 
control, should be limited to patients with extremely poor performance status 
(PS), very limited life-expectancy and/or severe comorbidity displaying 
unfavorable biologic factors, including secondary Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.

An ovarian cancer support group.

Sivesind DM(1), Baile WF.

Author information:
(1)Psychiatry Section, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 
USA.

PURPOSE: Because of the low rate of cure and high rate of relapse, the disease 
course of ovarian cancer can be emotionally devastating. Using psychological 
interventions to support patients emotionally and to enhance their quality of 
life should therefore be considered an important complement to medical care.
OVERVIEW: The authors describe a support group for patients with ovarian cancer, 
which was conducted over a 2-year period. The group consisted of patients with 
poor prognoses whose experience ranged from initial medical treatment, 
remission, and relapse to the dying experience. Key themes that arose during the 
sessions are identified, and differences between psychotherapy groups and 
support groups are highlighted. In contrast to psychotherapy groups, existential 
issues stood out as the most important therapeutic factor in this support group.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Because it is widely acknowledged that support groups 
have unique value in the total care of women with ovarian cancer, this 
description of issues related to group process hopefully will assist others who 
may plan to offer this type of psychological intervention for patients. With 
increasing technology and the resulting extension of life for patients with 
ovarian cancer, support groups like this may become an important aspect of care 
to enhance quality of life. The multidisciplinary team, including psychiatry, 
social work, nursing, and chaplaincy, is essential in expanding support groups 
in healthcare settings.

Carcinoid tumors of the lung and family history of cancer.

Center, Houston 77030, USA.

Family history of cancer has been described among patients with lung neoplasms. 
Carcinoid tumors, originally thought to be slow growing and nonmetastatic, have 
not historically been included in these studies. In some instances these tumors 
have demonstrated aggressive metastatic potential. A medical record review of 86 
patients with histopathologically confirmed carcinoid tumors of the lung, 
treated at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1959 and 
1994, was conducted to describe family history of cancer. Family history of 
cancer was recorded in 74 (86%) of the medical records and 32 (43%) reported 
first-degree relatives with cancer. Five-year survival for patients with 
affected relatives was 45% and 73% for patients without affected relatives (p = 
.23). Among 67 patients without metastatic disease at diagnosis, the risk of 
distant metastasis by 5 years was 40% among patients with a positive family 
history of cancer compared to 6% of the patients without affected relatives (p = 
.03), (rate ratio 5.01). These results suggest that genetic susceptibility may 
affect the metastatic potential of some carcinoid tumors.

BMT for severe autoimmune diseases: an idea whose time has come.

Burt RK(1).

Author information:
(1)Northwestern University Chicago, Illinois, USA.

Most patients with autoimmune diseases are thought to have a a normal life 
expectancy, and thus are treated conservatively. However, these diseases have a 
diverse clinical course. A small subset of patients have "severe autoimmune 
diseases," or SADS, which are rapidly progressive and are associated with early 
mortality. If patients with SADS can be identified before they develop 
irreversible organ damage, aggressive intervention would be indicated. 
Consequently, patients with SADS are now being enrolled in experimental 
protocols of immune ablation and hematopoietic stem-cell rescue (ie, bone marrow 
transplantation [BMT] at several US institutions. For various reasons, including 
the high cost of BMT, it will probably be years before the benefits, if any, of 
this procedure are known.

Eighty-five patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) (36 dissection, 49 
non-dissection) underwent surgical intervention in our service from December 
1985 to March 1997. 31 patients aged over 70 (aTAA) were compared with 54 
patients under 69 years of age (non-aTAA) about preoperative condition, surgical 
invasion, and operative morbidity and mortality. No significant differences were 
observed in preoperative associated condition and laboratory data between two
