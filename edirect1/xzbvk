BACKGROUND: Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has drastically increased 
the life expectancy of HIV-infected patients. However, HIV-infected patients 
exhibit increased inflammation and 33-58% exhibit a characteristic fat 
re-distribution termed HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS). Recombinant 
human growth hormone (rhGH) has been tested as treatment of HALS. Low-dose rhGH 
therapy improves thymopoiesis and fat distribution in HIV-infected patients and 
appears to be well tolerated. However, since high-dose rhGH is associated with 
adverse events related to inflammation, we wanted to investigate the impact of 
low-dose rhGH therapy on inflammation in HIV-infected patients.
METHODS: Forty-six cART-treated HIV-infected men were included in the HIV-GH 
low-dose (HIGH/Low) study: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded 
trial. Subjects were randomized 3:2 to 0.7 mg/day rhGH, or placebo for 40 weeks. 
rhGH was self-administered between 1 pm and 3 pm. The primary outcome of this 
substudy was changes in inflammation measured by plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) 
and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR).
RESULTS: Both CRP (-66%, p = 0.002) and suPAR (-9.7%, p = 0.06) decreased in the 
rhGH group compared to placebo; however, only CRP decreased significantly. The 
effect of rhGH on inflammation was not mediated through rhGH-induced changes in 
insulin-like growth factor 1, body composition, or immune parameters.
CONCLUSION: Daily 0.7 mg rhGH treatment for 40 weeks, administered at nadir 
endogenous GH secretion, significantly reduced CRP. The effect does not appear 
to be mediated by other factors. Our findings suggest that low-dose rhGH 
treatment may minimize long-term risks associated with high-dose rhGH therapy.

The Personal Emergency Response System as a Technology Innovation in Primary 
Health Care Services: An Integrative Review.

BACKGROUND: Most western countries are experiencing greater pressure on 
community care services due to increased life expectancy and changes in policy 
toward prioritizing independent living. This has led to a demand for change and 
innovation in caring practices with an expected increased use of technology. 
Despite numerous attempts, it has proven surprisingly difficult to implement and 
adopt technological innovations. The main established technological innovation 
in home care services for older people is the personal emergency response system 
(PERS), which is widely adopted and used throughout most western countries 
aiming to support "aging safely in place."
OBJECTIVE: This integrative review examines how research literature describes 
use of the PERS focusing on the users' perspective, thus exploring how different 
actors experience the technology in use and how it affects the complex 
interactions between multiple actors in caring practices.
METHODS: The review presents an overview of the body of research on this 
well-established telecare solution, indicating what is important for different 
actors in regard to accepting and using this technology in community care 
services. An integrative review, recognized by a systematic search in major 
databases followed by a review process, was conducted.
RESULTS: The search resulted in 33 included studies describing different actors' 
experiences with the PERS in use. The overall focus was on the end users' 
experiences and the consequences of having and using the alarm, and how the 
technology changes caring practices and interactions between the actors.
CONCLUSIONS: The PERS contributes to safety and independent living for users of 
the alarm, but there are also unforeseen consequences and possible improvements 
in the device and the integrated service. This rather simple and 
well-established telecare technology in use interacts with the actors involved, 
creating changes in daily living and even affecting their identities. This 
review argues for an approach to telecare in which the complexity of practice is 
accounted for and shows how the plug-and-play expectations producers tend to 
generate is a simplification of the reality. This calls for a recognition that 
place and actors matter, as does a sensitivity to technology as an integrated 
part of complex caring practices.

Understanding the molecular impact of lifestyle factors has never been so 
important; a period in time where there are so many adults above retirement age 
has been previously unknown. As a species, our life expectancy is increasing yet 
the period of our lives where we enjoy good health is not expanding 
proportionately. Over the next 50 years we will need to almost double the 
percentage of GDP spent on health care, largely due to the increasing incidence 
of obesity related chronic diseases. A greater understanding and implementation 
of an integrated approach to health is required. Research exploring the impact 
of nutritional and exercise intervention on the epigenetically flexible genome 
is up front in terms of addressing healthy aging. Alongside this, we need a 
greater understanding of the interaction with our immune and nervous systems in 
preserving and maintaining health and cognition.

Breast cancer survivors (BCS) exhibit decreased physical function and quality of 
life (QOL) following cancer treatments. Resistance training (RT) may elicit 
positive changes in physical and mental well-being. This study assessed 27 BCS, 
pre-and post-intervention (six months) on the following variables: muscular 
strength (via one repetition maximum (1RM) of chest press and leg extension), 
physical function (via the Continuous Scale-Physical Functional Performance 
test) and QOL (via the Short Form-36 survey). RT consisted of two days/week of 
ten exercises including two sets of 8-12 repetitions at 52%-69% of their 1RM. A 
repeated measures analysis of variance revealed BCS significantly (p < 0.05) 
increased upper (71 ± 22 to 89 ± 22 kg) and lower body (74 ± 18 to 93 ± 24 kg) 
strength, total physical function (65.5 ± 12.1 to 73.6 ± 12.2 units) and the 
subcomponents of physical function: upper body strength (63.5 ± 16.3 to 71.2 ± 
16.8 units), lower body strength (58.5 ± 14.9 to 68.6 ± 16.3 units), balance and 
coordination (66.5 ± 12.2 to 74.6 ± 11.6 units), and endurance (67.2 ± 12.0 to 
75.0 ± 11.6 units). No changes were observed over time for subjective measures 
of physical function and QOL. Results showed RT could be an effective means to 
improve objective physical function in BCS. Further research is needed to 
clarify the effects of RT on subjective physical function and QOL.

Chronic kidney disease is marked by a reduced life expectancy and a high symptom 
burden. For those who reach end-stage renal disease, the prognosis is poor, and 
this combined with the growing prevalence of the disease necessitates supportive 
and palliative care programmes that will address people's psychosocial, cultural 
and spiritual needs. While there is variation between countries, research 
reveals that many renal specialist nurses and doctors are reluctant to address 
spirituality, initiate end-of-life conversations or implement conservative 
treatment plans early. Yet, other studies indicate that the provision of 
palliative care services, which includes the spiritual dimension, can reduce 
symptom burden, assist patients in making advanced directives/plans and improve 
health-related quality of life. This review brings together the current 
literature related to renal supportive care and spirituality under the following 
sections and themes. The introduction and background sections situate 
spirituality in both healthcare generally and chronic kidney disease. Gaps in 
the provision of chronic kidney disease spiritual care are then considered, 
followed by a discussion of the palliative care model related to chronic kidney 
disease and spirituality. Chronic kidney disease spiritual needs and care 
approaches are discussed with reference to advanced care planning, hope, grief 
and relationships. A particular focus on quality of life is developed, with 
spirituality named as a key dimension. Finally, further challenges, such as 
culture, training and limitations, are explicated.

BACKGROUND: Total pancreatectomy is actually considered a viable option in 
selected patients even if large comparative studies between partial versus total 
pancreatectomy are not currently available. Our aim was to evaluate whether 
total pancreatectomy can be considered as feasible, safe, efficacious, and 
cost-effective as pancreaticoduodenectomy.
METHODS: A single center, prospective, observational trial, regarding 
postoperative outcomes, long-term results, and cost-effectiveness, in a tertiary 
referral center was conducted, comparing consecutive patients who underwent 
elective total pancreatectomy and/or pancreaticoduodenectomy.
RESULTS: Seventy-three consecutive elective total pancreatectomies and 184 
pancreaticoduodenectomies were compared. There were no significant differences 
regarding postoperative outcomes and overall survival. The quality of life, 
evaluated in 119 patients according to the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, showed that 
there were no significant differences regarding the five items considered. The 
mean EQ-5D-5L score was similar in the two procedures (total 
pancreatectomy = 0.872, range 0.345-1.000; pancreaticoduodenectomy = 0.832, 
range 0.393-1.000; P = 0.320). The impact of diabetes according to the Problem 
Areas in Diabetes (PAID) questionnaire did not show any significant differences 
except for question 13 (total pancreatectomy = 0.60; 
pancreaticoduodenectomy = 0.19; P = 0.022). The cost-effectiveness analysis 
suggested that the quality-adjusted life year was not significantly different 
between the two procedures (total pancreatectomy = 0.910, range 0.345-1.000; 
pancreaticoduodenectomy = 0.910, range -0.393-1.000; P = 0.320).
CONCLUSIONS: From this study, it seems reasonable to suggest that total 
pancreatectomy can be considered as safe, feasible, and efficacious as PD and 
acceptable in terms of cost-effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation is an alternative 
technique for the treatment of patients with fulminant hepatic failure and 
metabolic liver disease. It provides temporary support of liver function until 
sufficient regeneration of the native liver. Pediatric patients have a long life 
expectancy and are best candidates to benefit from the interruption of 
antirejection treatment.
DESCRIPTION OF CASE: A 4-year-old boy underwent auxiliary partial orthotopic 
liver transplantation for fulminant hepatic failure using a cadaveric left 
lateral segment of liver. One year after auxiliary partial orthotopic liver 
transplantation, the patient's native liver was determined to be completely 
normal and he was doing well. The patient was then gradually weaned from the 
immunosuppression over the course of one year. The graft was undetectable on 
follow-up computerized tomography performed before complete cessation of 
immunosuppression, leading to the diagnosis of "vanishing graft syndrome".
CONCLUSION: Graft atrophy commonly occurs after auxiliary partial orthotopic 
liver transplantation due to cessation of antirejection therapy. But to our 
knowledge, complete graft disappearance is a rare occurrence reported in the 
English literature. Timing for withdrawal of the immunosuppression is an 
important decision to be made in this technique. Hippokratia 2015; 19 (3):

Expansion or compression of long-term care in Germany between 2001 and 2009? A 
small-area decomposition study based on administrative health data.

BACKGROUND: Studies state profound cross-country differences in healthy life 
years and its time trends, suggesting either the health scenario of expansion or 
compression of morbidity. A much-discussed question in public health research is 
whether the health scenarios are heterogeneous or homogeneous on the subnational 
level as well. Furthermore, the question arises whether the morbidity trends or 
the mortality trends are the decisive drivers of the care need-free life years 
(CFLY), the life years with care need (CLY), and, ultimately, the health 
scenarios.
METHODS: This study uses administrative census data of all beneficiaries in 
Germany from the Statutory Long-Term Care Insurance 2001-2009. We compute the 
CFLY and CLY at age 65+ for 412 counties. The CFLY and CLY gains are decomposed 
into the effects of survival and of the prevalence of care need, and we 
investigate their linkages with the health scenarios by applying multinomial 
regression models.
RESULTS: We show an overall increase in CFLY, which is higher for men than for 
women and higher for severe than for any care need. However, spatial variation 
in CFLY and in CLY has increased. In terms of the health scenarios, a majority 
of counties show an expansion of any care need but a compression of severe care 
need. There is high spatial heterogeneity, with expansion-counties surrounding 
compression-counties and vice versa, which is mainly caused by divergent trends 
in the prevalence of care need. We show that mortality is responsible for the 
absolute changes in CFLY and CLY, while morbidity is the decisive driver that 
determines the health scenario of a county.
CONCLUSION: Combining regionalized administrative data and advanced statistical 
methods permits a deeper insight into the complex relationship between health 
and mortality. Our findings demonstrate a compression of life years with severe 
care need, which however, depends on the region of residence. To attenuate 
regional inequalities, more efforts are needed that improve health by medical 
and infrastructural interventions and by the exchange of insights in the 
efficiency of small- and large-area policy measures between the vanguard and the 
rearguard counties. In future research, the underlying latent mechanisms should 
be investigated in more detail.

OBJECTIVE The study aim was to assess the influence of presurgical clinical 
symptom severity and disease duration on outcomes of shunt surgery in patients 
with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). The authors also evaluated 
the cerebrospinal fluid tap test as a predictor of improvements following shunt 
surgery. METHODS Eighty-three patients (45 men and 38 women, mean age 76.4 
years) underwent lumboperitoneal shunt surgery, and outcomes were evaluated 
until 12 months following surgery. Risks for poor quality of life (Score 3 or 4 
on the modified Rankin Scale [mRS]) and severe gait disturbance were evaluated 
at 3 and 12 months following shunt surgery, and the tap test was also conducted. 
Age-adjusted and multivariate relative risks were calculated using Cox 
proportional-hazards regression. RESULTS Of 83 patients with iNPH, 45 (54%) 
improved by 1 point on the mRS and 6 patients (7%) improved by ≥ 2 points at 3 
months following surgery. At 12 months after surgery, 39 patients (47%) improved 
by 1 point on the mRS and 13 patients (16%) improved by ≥ 2 points. On the gait 
domain of the iNPH grading scale (iNPHGS), 36 patients (43%) improved by 1 point 
and 13 patients (16%) improved by ≥ 2 points at 3 months following surgery. 
Additionally, 32 patients (38%) improved by 1 point and 14 patients (17%) by ≥ 2 
points at 12 months following surgery. In contrast, 3 patients (4%) and 2 
patients (2%) had worse symptoms according to the mRS or the gait domain of the 
iNPHGS, respectively, at 3 months following surgery, and 5 patients (6%) and 3 
patients (4%) had worse mRS scores and gait domain scores, respectively, at 12 
months after surgery. Patients with severe preoperative mRS scores had a 4.7 
times higher multivariate relative risk (RR) for severe mRS scores at 12 months 
following surgery. Moreover, patients with severe gait disturbance prior to 
shunt surgery had a 46.5 times greater multivariate RR for severe gait 
disturbance at the 12-month follow-up. Patients without improved gait following 
the tap test had multivariate RRs for unimproved gait disturbance of 7.54 and 
11.2 at 3 and 12 months following surgery, respectively. Disease duration from 
onset to shunt surgery was not significantly associated with postoperative 
symptom severity or unimproved symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Patients with iNPH should 
receive treatment before their symptoms become severe in order to achieve an 
improved quality of life. However, the progression of symptoms varies between 
patients so specific timeframes are not meaningful. The authors also found that 
tap test scores accurately predicted shunt efficacy. Therefore, indications for 
shunt surgery should be carefully assessed in each patient with iNPH, 
considering the relative risks and benefits for that person, including healthy 
life expectancy.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a powerful methodology for the study of health 
impacts and public policies. We performed this study to quantitatively explain 
the potential health impacts on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of corn 
produced in Mexico and imported from the United States of America (U.S.) from 
1984 until 2014. The processes are hybrid and organic corn production. The 
functional unit was defined as 1 ton of corn production. Results indicate a 
total value of 178,431, 244,175, and 283,426 DALYs of three decades: 1984-1993, 
1994-2003, and 2004-2013, of Mexican production; the U.S. production and 
transport were also calculated, showing values of 29,815, 65,837, and 107,729 
for the same three decades. Additionally, DALYs were obtained for the category 
of human health and climate change by functional unit: 802.31 (1984-1993), 
802.67 (1994-2003), and 803.92 (2004-2013), and for imported corn transported to 
Mexico from the U.S., 859.12 (1984-2013). DALYs on human toxicity were obtained: 
99.05 (1984-1993), 99.05 (1994-2003), and 99.04 (2004-2013), and for the corn 
imported and transported to Mexico from the U.S., 116.25 (1984-2013).
CONCLUSIONS: Environmental and health impacts in terms of DALYs are higher when 
corn is imported versus the corn produced in Mexico. Environmental health and 
nominal corn cultivation and transport impacts have increased as a result of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico needs to redefine its public 
policies to suffer less of an environmental burden from corn to ensure global 
environmental health and food security.

Mitochondrial dysfunction underlies numerous age-related pathologies. In an 
effort to uncover how the detrimental effects of mitochondrial dysfunction might 
be alleviated, we examined how the nematode C. elegans not only adapts to 
disruption of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, but in many instances 
responds with extended lifespan. Studies have shown various retrograde responses 
are activated in these animals, including the well-studied ATFS-1-dependent 
mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Such processes fall under the 
greater rubric of cellular surveillance mechanisms. Here we identify a novel p38 
signaling cascade that is required to extend life when the mitochondrial 
electron transport chain is disrupted in worms, and which is blocked by 
disruption of the Mitochondrial-associated Degradation (MAD) pathway. This novel 
cascade is defined by DLK-1 (MAP3K), SEK-3 (MAP2K), PMK-3 (MAPK) and the 
reporter gene Ptbb-6::GFP. Inhibition of known mitochondrial retrograde 
responses does not alter induction of Ptbb-6::GFP, instead induction of this 
reporter often occurs in counterpoint to activation of SKN-1, which we show is 
under the control of ATFS-1. In those mitochondrial bioenergetic mutants which 
activate Ptbb-6::GFP, we find that dlk-1, sek-3 and pmk-3 are all required for 
their life extension.

Expectations about future health and longevity are important determinants of 
individuals' decisions to invest in physical and human capital. Few 
population-level studies have measured subjective expectations and examined how 
they are affected by scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We assessed these 
expectations in communities receiving annual HIV testing and universal ART. 
Longitudinal data on expectations were collected at baseline and one year later 
in 16 intervention communities participating in the Sustainable East Africa 
Research in Community Health (SEARCH) trial of the test and treat strategy in 
Kenya and Uganda (NCT01864603). A random sample of households with and without 
an HIV-positive adult was selected after baseline HIV testing. Individuals' 
expectations about survival to 50, 60, 70, and 80 years of age, as well as 
future health status and economic well-being, were measured using a Likert 
scale. Primary outcomes were binary variables indicating participants who 
reported being very likely or almost certain to survive to advanced ages. 
Logistic regression analyses were used to examine trends in expectations as well 
as associations with HIV status and viral load for HIV-positive individuals. 
Data were obtained from 3126 adults at baseline and 3977 adults in year 1, with 
2926 adults participating in both waves. HIV-negative adults were more likely to 
have favorable expectations about survival to 60 years than HIV-positive adults 
with detectable viral load (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.87, 95% CI 1.53-2.30), 
as were HIV-positive adults with undetectable viral load (AOR 1.41, 95% CI 
1.13-1.77). Favorable expectations about survival to 60 years were more likely 
for all groups in year 1 compared to baseline (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.31-1.77). 
These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that universal ART leads to 
improved population-level expectations about future health and well-being. 
Future research from the SEARCH trial will help determine whether these changes 
are causally driven by the provision of universal ART.

BACKGROUND: There is a marked growth in the number of homebound older adults, 
due mainly to increased life expectancy. Although this group has special 
characteristics and needs, it has not been properly studied. This study thus 
aimed to measure the prevalence of homebound status in a community-dwelling 
population, and its association with both socio-demographic, medical and 
functional characteristics and the use of health care and social services.
METHODS: We used instruments coming under the WHO International Classification 
of Functioning (ICF) framework to carry out a cross-sectional study on 
populations aged 50 years and over in the province of Zaragoza (Spain), covering 
a total of 1622 participants. Persons who reported severe or extreme difficulty 
in getting out of the house in the last 30 days were deemed to be homebound. We 
studied associations between homebound status and several relevant variables in 
a group of 790 subjects who tested positive to the WHODAS-12 disability 
screening tool.
RESULTS: Prevalence of homebound status was 9.8 % (95 % CI: 8.4 to 11.3 %). 
Homebound participants tended to be older, female and display a lower 
educational level, a higher number of diseases, poorer cognition and a higher 
degree of disability. In fully adjusted models including disability as measured 
with the ICF-Checklist, the associated variables (odds ratios and [95 % 
confidence intervals]) were: female gender (3.75 [2.10-6.68]); urban population 
(2.36 [1.30-4.29]); WHODAS-12 disability (6.27 [2.56-15.40]); depressive 
symptoms (2.95 [1.86-4.68]); moderate pain (2.37 [1.30-4.31] and severe pain 
(3.03 [1.31-7.01]), as compared to the group with no/mild pain; hospital 
admissions in the previous 3 months (2.98 [1.25-7.11]); and diabetes (1.87 
[1.03-3.41]). Adjustment for ICF-Checklist disability had a notable impact on 
most associations.
CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that homebound status is a common problem in our 
setting, and that being disabled is its main determinant. Socio-demographic 
characteristics, barriers and chronic diseases can also be assumed to be playing 
a role in the onset of this condition, indicating the need for further research, 
including longitudinal studies on its incidence and associated factors.

PURPOSE: The adoption of active surveillance varies widely across urological 
communities, which suggests a need for more consistency in the counseling of 
patients. To address this need we used the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method to 
develop appropriateness criteria and counseling statements for active 
surveillance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Panelists were recruited from MUSIC urology practices. 
Combinations of parameters thought to influence decision making were used to 
create and score 160 theoretical clinical scenarios for appropriateness of 
active surveillance. Recent rates of active surveillance among real patients 
across the state were assessed using the MUSIC registry.
RESULTS: Low volume Gleason 6 was deemed highly appropriate for active 
surveillance whereas high volume Gleason 6 and low volume Gleason 3+4 were 
deemed appropriate to uncertain. No scenario was deemed inappropriate or highly 
inappropriate. Prostate specific antigen density, race and life expectancy 
impacted scores for intermediate and high volume Gleason 6 and low volume 
Gleason 3+4. The greatest degree of score dispersion (disagreement) occurred in 
scenarios with long life expectancy, high volume Gleason 6 and low volume 
Gleason 3+4. Recent rates of active surveillance use among real patients ranged 
from 0% to 100% at the provider level for low or intermediate biopsy volume 
Gleason 6, demonstrating a clear opportunity for quality improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: By virtue of this work urologists have the opportunity to present 
specific recommendations from the panel to their individual patients. 
Community-wide efforts aimed at increasing rates of active surveillance and 
reducing practice and physician level variation in the choice of active 
surveillance vs treatment are warranted.

Oxidative stress can lead to premature aging symptoms and cause acute mortality 
at higher doses in a range of organisms. Oxidative stress resistance and 
longevity are mechanistically and phenotypically linked; considerable variation 
in oxidative stress resistance exists among and within species and typically 
covaries with life expectancy. However, it is unclear whether stress-resistant, 
long-lived individuals avoid, repair, or tolerate molecular damage to survive 
longer than others. The honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) is an emerging model 
system that is well-suited to address this question. Furthermore, this species 
is the most economically important pollinator, whose health may be compromised 
by pesticide exposure, including oxidative stressors. Here, we develop a 
protocol for inducing oxidative stress in honey bee males (drones) via Paraquat 
injection. After injection, individuals from different colony sources were kept 
in common social conditions to monitor their survival compared to 
saline-injected controls. Oxidative stress was measured in susceptible and 
resistant individuals. Paraquat drastically reduced survival but individuals 
varied in their resistance to treatment within and among colony sources. 
Longer-lived individuals exhibited higher levels of lipid peroxidation than 
individuals dying early. In contrast, the level of protein carbonylation was not 
significantly different between the two groups. This first study of oxidative 
stress in male honey bees suggests that survival of an acute oxidative stressor 
is due to tolerance, not prevention or repair, of oxidative damage to lipids. It 
also demonstrates colony differences in oxidative stress resistance that might 
be useful for breeding stress-resistant honey bees.

Polydiglycosylphosphate Transferase PdtA (SCO2578) of Streptomyces coelicolor 
A3(2) Is Crucial for Proper Sporulation and Apical Tip Extension under Stress 
Conditions.

Although anionic glycopolymers are crucial components of the Gram-positive cell 
envelope, the relevance of anionic glycopolymers for vegetative growth and 
morphological differentiation of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) is unknown. Here, 
we show that the LytR-CpsA-Psr (LCP) protein PdtA (SCO2578), a TagV-like 
glycopolymer transferase, has a dual function in the S. coelicolor A3(2) life 
cycle. Despite the presence of 10 additional LCP homologs, PdtA is crucial for 
proper sporulation. The integrity of the spore envelope was severely affected in 
a pdtA deletion mutant, resulting in 34% nonviable spores. pdtA deletion caused 
a significant reduction in the polydiglycosylphosphate content of the spore 
envelope. Beyond that, apical tip extension and normal branching of vegetative 
mycelium were severely impaired on high-salt medium. This growth defect 
coincided with the mislocalization of peptidoglycan synthesis. Thus, PdtA itself 
or the polydiglycosylphosphate attached to the peptidoglycan by the glycopolymer 
transferase PdtA also has a crucial function in apical tip extension of 
vegetative hyphae under stress conditions.
IMPORTANCE: Anionic glycopolymers are underappreciated components of the 
Gram-positive cell envelope. They provide rigidity to the cell wall and position 
extracellular enzymes involved in peptidoglycan remodeling. Although 
Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), the model organism for bacterial antibiotic 
production, is known to produce two distinct cell wall-linked glycopolymers, 
teichulosonic acid and polydiglycosylphosphate, the role of these glycopolymers 
in the S. coelicolor A3(2) life cycle has not been addressed so far. This study 
reveals a crucial function of the anionic glycopolymer polydiglycosylphosphate 
for the growth and morphological differentiation of S. coelicolor A3(2). 
Polydiglycosylphosphate is attached to the spore wall by the LytR-CpsA-Psr 
protein PdtA (SCO2578), a component of the Streptomyces spore wall-synthesizing 
complex (SSSC), to ensure the integrity of the spore envelope. Surprisingly, 
PdtA also has a crucial role in vegetative growth under stress conditions and is 
required for proper peptidoglycan incorporation during apical tip extension.

In the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), exercise training is now considered 
a cornerstone. However, most clinicians tend to focus on neurologic deficits 
only, and thus prefer to prescribe rehabilitation programs specifically to 
counteract these deficits. However, the present comprehensive review shows that 
patients with MS (pwMS) also experience significant muscular, cardiac, 
ventilatory and metabolic dysfunction, which significantly contribute, next to 
neurologic deficits, to exercise intolerance. In addition, these anomalies also 
might increase the risk for frequent hospitalization and morbidity and can 
reduce life expectancy. Unfortunately, the impact of exercise intervention on 
these anomalies in pwMS are mostly unknown. Therefore, it is suggested that pwMS 
should be screened systematically for muscular, cardiac, ventilatory and 
metabolic function during exercise testing. The detection of such anomalies 
should lead to adaptations and optimisation of exercise training prescription 
and clinical care/medical treatment of pwMS. In addition, future studies should 
focus on the impact of exercise intervention on muscular, cardiac, ventilatory 
and metabolic (dys)function in pwMS, to contribute to improved treatment and 
care.

PURPOSE: The delivery of high quality prostate cancer care is increasingly 
important for health systems, physicians and patients. Integrated delivery 
systems may have the greatest ability to deliver high quality, efficient care. 
We sought to understand the association between health care integration and 
quality of prostate cancer care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used SEER-Medicare data to perform a retrospective 
cohort study of men older than age 65 with prostate cancer diagnosed between 
2007 and 2011. We defined integration within a health care market based on the 
number of discharges from a top 100 integrated delivery system, and compared 
rates of adherence to well accepted prostate cancer quality measures in markets 
with no integration vs full integration (greater than 90% of discharges from an 
integrated system).
RESULTS: The average man treated in a fully integrated market was more likely to 
receive pretreatment counseling by a urologist and radiation oncologist (62.6% 
vs 60.3%, p=0.03), avoid inappropriate imaging (72.2% avoided vs 60.6%, 
p <0.001), avoid treatment when life expectancy was less than 10 years (23.7% vs 
17.3%, p <0.001) and avoid multiple hospitalizations in the last 30 days of life 
(50.2% vs 43.6%, p=0.001) than when treated in markets with no integration. 
Additionally, patients treated in fully integrated markets were more likely to 
have complete adherence to all eligible quality measures (OR 1.38, 95% CI 
1.27-1.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Integrated systems are associated with improved adherence to 
several prostate cancer quality measures. Expansion of the integrated health 
care model may facilitate greater delivery of high quality prostate cancer care.

Product lifetime, energy efficiency and climate change: A case study of air 
conditioners in Japan.

This study proposed a modelling technique for estimating life-cycle CO2 
emissions of durable goods by considering changes in product lifetime and energy 
efficiency. The stock and flow of durable goods was modelled by Weibull lifetime 
distributions and the trend in annual energy efficiency (i.e., annual 
electricity consumption) of an "average" durable good was formulated as a 
reverse logistic curve including a technologically critical value (i.e., limit 
energy efficiency) with respect to time. I found that when the average product 
lifetime is reduced, there is a trade-off between the reduction in emissions 
during product use (use phase), due to the additional purchases of new, more 
energy-efficient air conditioners, and the increase in emissions arising from 
the additional production of new air conditioners stimulated by the reduction of 
the average product lifetime. A scenario analysis focused on residential air 
conditioners in Japan during 1972-2013 showed that for a reduction of average 
lifetime of 1 year, if the air conditioner energy efficiency limit can be 
improved by 1.4% from the estimated current efficiency level, then CO2 emissions 
can be reduced by approximately the same amount as for an extension of average 
product lifetime of 1 year.

Given the increasing life expectancy observed in Western countries, there is a 
marked interest to know more about how aging could influence respiratory health.
