containing avobenzone (BMDBM) based on freestanding poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) 
nanosheets through a spin-coating process. Although monolayered PLLA nanosheets 
did not contain enough BMDBM to protect against UV radiation, the layered 
nanosheets, consisting of five discrete BMDBM nanosheets, showed high UV 
absorbance without lowering the adhesive strength against skin. Inflammatory 
reactions in XPA-deficient mice after UV radiation were completely suppressed by 
the application of BMDBM-layered nanosheets to the skin. Thus, the BMDBM layered 
nanosheet could serve as a potential sunscreen preparation to improve the 
quality of life of patients with XP.

An increase in the world population and its life expectancy, as well as the 
ongoing concern about our physical appearance, have elevated the relevance of 
dental implantology in recent decades. Engineering strategies to improve the 
survival rate of dental implants have been widely investigated, focusing on 
implant material composition, geometry (usually guided to reduce stiffness), and 
interface surrounding tissues. Although efforts to develop different implant 
surface modifications are being applied in commercial dental prostheses today, 
the inclusion of surface coatings has gained special interest, as they can be 
tailored to efficiently enhance osseointegration, as well as to reduce 
bacterial-related infection, minimizing peri-implantitis appearance and its 
associated risks. The use of biomaterials to replace teeth has highlighted the 
need for the development of reliable analytical methods to assess the 
therapeutic benefits of implants. This literature review considers the 
state-of-the-art strategies for surface modification or coating and analytical 
methodologies for increasing the survival rate for teeth restoration.

Wrist velocity is an important risk factor for work-related musculoskeletal 
disorders in the elbow/hand, which is also difficult to assess by observation or 
self-reports. This study aimed to evaluate a new convenient and low-cost 
inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based method using gyroscope signals against an 
electrogoniometer for measuring wrist flexion velocity. Twelve participants 
performed standard wrist movements and simulated work tasks while equipped with 
both systems. Two computational algorithms for the IMU-based system, i.e., 
IMUnorm and IMUflex, were used. For wrist flexion/extension, the mean absolute 
errors (MAEs) of median wrist flexion velocity compared to the goniometer were 
<10.1°/s for IMUnorm and <4.1°/s for IMUflex. During wrist deviation and 
pronation/supination, all methods showed errors, where the IMUnorm method had 
the largest overestimations. For simulated work tasks, the IMUflex method had 
small bias and better accuracy than the IMUnorm method compared to the 
goniometer, with the MAEs of median wrist flexion velocity <5.8°/s. The results 
suggest that the IMU-based method can be considered as a convenient method to 
assess wrist motion for occupational studies or ergonomic evaluations for the 
design of workstations and tools by both researchers and practitioners, and the 
IMUflex method is preferred. Future studies need to examine algorithms to 
further improve the accuracy of the IMU-based method in tasks of larger 
variations, as well as easy calibration procedures.

Drug abuse is a common comorbidity in people infected with HIV. HIV-infected 
individuals who abuse drugs are a key population who frequently experience 
suboptimal outcomes along the HIV continuum of care. A modest proportion of 
HIV-infected individuals develop HIV-associated neurocognitive issues, the 
severity of which further increases with drug abuse. Moreover, the tendency of 
the virus to go into latency in certain cellular reservoirs again complicates 
the elimination of HIV and HIV-associated illnesses. Antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) successfully decreased the overall viral load in infected people, yet it 
does not effectively eliminate the virus from all latent reservoirs. Although 
ART increased the life expectancy of infected individuals, it showed 
inconsistent improvement in CNS functioning, thus decreasing the quality of 
life. Research efforts have been dedicated to identifying common mechanisms 
through which HIV and drug abuse lead to neurotoxicity and CNS dysfunction. 
Therefore, in order to develop an effective treatment regimen to treat 
neurocognitive and related symptoms in HIV-infected patients, it is crucial to 
understand the involved mechanisms of neurotoxicity. Eventually, those 
mechanisms could lead the way to design and develop novel therapeutic strategies 
addressing both CNS HIV reservoir and illicit drug use by HIV patients.

Capsicum is one of the most perishable fruit which undergo rapid loss of 
commercial value during postharvest storage. In this experiment our aim is to 
evaluate the effect of photoactivated TiO2 nano-particle complexed with chitosan 
or TiO2-nanocomposite (TiO2-NC) on extension self-life of Capsicum fruit and its 
effect on related morphological, physiological and molecular attributes at room 
temperature (25 °C). Initially, TiO2-NC coated fruits recorded superior 
maintenance of total soluble solids accumulation along with retention of 
firmness, cellular integrity, hydration, color etc. On the extended period of 
storage, fruit recorded a lower bioaccumulation of TiO2 in comparison to 
metallic silver over the control. On the level of gene expression for ethylene 
biosynthetic and signaling the TiO2-NC had more regulation, however, discretely 
to moderate the ripening. Thus, ACC synthase and oxidase recorded a 
significantly better downregulation as studied from fruit pulp under TiO2-NC 
than silver. On the signaling path, the transcripts for CaETR1 and CaETR2 were 
less abundant in fruit under both the treatment when studied against control for 
7 d. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also correlated to retard the 
oxidative lysis of polyamine oxidation by diamine and polyamine oxidase 
activity. The gene expression for hydrolytic activity as non-specific esterase 
had corroborated the development of essential oil constituents with few of those 
recorded in significant abundance. Therefore, TiO2-NC would be reliable to 
induce those metabolites modulating ripening behavior in favor of delayed 
ripening. From gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis profile of 
all tested essential oil constituents suggesting positive impact of TiO2-NC on 
shelf-life extension of Capsicum fruit. Our results indicated the potentiality 
of TiO2-NC in postharvest storage those may connect ethylene signaling and ROS 
metabolism in suppression of specific ripening attributes.

Guava (Psidium guajava L.) fruit is also known as the apple of tropics, belongs 
to the family of genus Psidium, and is widely cultivated in tropical zones of 
the world. Recently, the importance of guava fruit has increased due to its 
inherent nutritional content, pleasant aroma, excellent flavor, and delicious 
taste. It is considered an excellent source of nutrients and phytochemicals. 
Guava is a climacteric fruit that continues to mature or ripen even after 
harvest, showing an increase in the rate of respiration and metabolic activities 
within a short period, leading to rapid senescence or spoilage of fruit. It has 
limitations in terms of commercialization due to short storage life after 
harvest and sensitivity to diseases and chilling injury during the storage 
period. Many postharvest technologies such as edible packaging, modified 
atmosphere packaging (MAP), composite packaging, controlled atmosphere packaging 
(CAP), antimicrobial/antifungal packaging, and nano packaging have been used to 
retard the chilling injury and enhance the keeping quality of guava fruits 
during the storage period to control respiration rate, reduce weight loss, 
minimize lipid oxidation, and maintain organoleptic properties. However, these 
packaging technologies have varied effects on the internal and external quality 
attributes of guava fruits. This review, therefore, discusses the physiology, 
mechanism of ripening, oxidation, and ethylene production of guava fruits. The 
review also discusses the packaging technologies and their effect on the 
postharvest characteristics of guava fruits during the storage period.

Women of reproductive age (15-49 years) are often considered a vulnerable 
population affected by nutritional deficiencies, impairing their health and that 
of their offspring. We briefly introduced (a) the incidence and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) trends from 2010 to 2019 and (b) the 
correlation between sex differences and income levels and nutritional 
deficiencies of reproductive women firstly. Notably, the burden of overall 
nutritional deficiencies among reproductive women remained generally stable from 
2010 to 2019, whereas the iodine and vitamin A deficiencies as a subcategory 
were associated with increased incidence rates and DALYs, respectively. A 
significant increasing trend occurred in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Turkey 
for incidence, and Western Sub-Saharan Africa and Zimbabwe had a strong increase 
for DALYs. Further analysis of the correlation between nutritional deficiency 
incidence and economic capacity showed that they were not correlated with the 
income of women themselves, as was the result of income difference with men. The 
results of this study will help to identify gaps in nutritional deficiency 
burden among reproductive women and facilitate the development of regional or 
national responses. Compared with economic capital, macroscopic political 
guarantees and social and cultural capital are important measures to remedy the 
nutritional deficiencies of reproductive women.

A number of factors contribute to the complex process of aging, which finally 
define whether someone will or not develop age-associated chronic diseases in 
late life. These determinants comprise genetic susceptibility as well as various 
behavioral, environmental, and dietary factors, all of which have been shown to 
influence specific pathways regulating the aging process and the extension of 
life, which makes longevity a multidimensional phenomenon. Although a 
"miraculous elixir" or a "nutrition pill" are not plausible, researchers agree 
on the notion that nutritional factors have major impact on the risk of 
age-associated chronic non-communicable diseases and mortality. In recent years 
nutrition research in relation to health outcomes has considerably changed from 
focusing exclusively on single nutrients to considering combinations of foods 
rather than nutrients in isolation. Although research on specific nutrients is 
scientifically valid providing crucial evidence on the mechanisms by which 
nutrition impacts health, the recent switch targeting the multifaceted 
synergistic interplay among nutrients, other dietary constituents, and whole 
foods, has promoted emerging interest on the actions of total dietary patterns. 
This narrative review aims to describe some specific dietary patterns with 
evidence of associations with reduction in the incidence of chronic diseases 
allowing older adults to live a long-lasting and healthier life, and confirming 
the powerful impact nutrition can exert on healthy aging.

Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is a popular method for detecting RNA viruses 
in plants. RT-PCR is usually performed in a classical two-step procedure: in the 
first step, cDNA is synthesized by reverse transcriptase (RT), followed by PCR 
amplification by a thermostable polymerase in a separate tube in the second 
step. However, one-step kits containing multiple enzymes optimized for RT and 
PCR amplification in a single tube can also be used. Here, we describe an RT-PCR 
single-enzyme assay based on an RTX DNA polymerase that has both RT and 
polymerase activities. The expression plasmid pET_RTX_(exo-) was transferred to 
various E. coli genotypes that either compensated for codon bias (Rosetta-gami 
2) or contained additional chaperones to promote solubility (BL21 (DE3) with 
plasmids pKJE8 or pTf2). The RTX enzyme was then purified and used for the 
RT-PCR assay. Several purified plant viruses (TMV, PVX, and PVY) were used to 
determine the efficiency of the assay compared to a commercial one-step RT-PCR 
kit. The RT-PCR assay with the RTX enzyme was validated for the detection of 
viruses from different genera using both total RNA and crude sap from infected 
plants. The detection endpoint of RTX-PCR for purified TMV was estimated to be 
approximately 0.01 pg of the whole virus per 25 µL reaction, corresponding to 6 
virus particles/µL. Interestingly, the endpoint for detection of TMV from crude 
sap was also 0.01 pg per reaction in simulated crude plant extracts. The longest 
RNA fragment that could be amplified in a one-tube arrangement was 2379 bp long. 
The longest DNA fragment that could be amplified during a 10s extension was 6899 
bp long. In total, we were able to detect 13 viruses from 11 genera using 
RTX-PCR. For each virus, two to three specific fragments were amplified. The 
RT-PCR assay using the RTX enzyme described here is a very robust, inexpensive, 
rapid, easy to perform, and sensitive single-enzyme assay for the detection of 
plant viruses.

Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no conflict 
of interest. The initial decision to embark on this project began with the 
availability of funding, or more accurately, the lack thereof. Our main funding 
in the early stages of the project required all reagents to be procured through 
public tenders, which is a relatively arduous and time-consuming process. This 
meant that we had to find low cost sources of commonly used reagents and 
laboratory supplies. Apart from this, the funders had no influence on the design 
of this study.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) has become a leading cause of global 
blindness as a microvascular complication of diabetes. Regular screening of 
diabetic retinopathy is strongly recommended for people with diabetes so that 
timely treatment can be provided to reduce the incidence of visual impairment. 
However, DR screening is not well carried out due to lack of eye care 
facilities, especially in the rural areas of China. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
based DR screening has emerged as a novel strategy and show promising diagnostic 
performance in sensitivity and specificity, relieving the pressure of the 
shortage of facilities and ophthalmologists because of its quick and accurate 
diagnosis. In this study, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of AI screening 
for DR in rural China based on Markov model, providing evidence for extending 
use of AI screening for DR.
METHODS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of AI screening and compared it 
with ophthalmologist screening in which fundus images are evaluated by 
ophthalmologists. We developed a Markov model-based hybrid decision tree to 
analyze the costs, effectiveness and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
of AI screening strategies relative to no screening strategies and 
ophthalmologist screening strategies (dominated) over 35 years (mean life 
expectancy of diabetes patients in rural China). The analysis was conducted from 
the health system perspective (included direct medical costs) and societal 
perspective (included medical and nonmedical costs). Effectiveness was analyzed 
with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The robustness of results was 
estimated by performing one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic analysis.
RESULTS: From the health system perspective, AI screening and ophthalmologist 
screening had incremental costs of $180.19 and $215.05 but more quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) compared with no screening. AI screening had an ICER of 
$1,107.63. From the societal perspective which considers all direct and indirect 
costs, AI screening had an ICER of $10,347.12 compared with no screening, below 
the cost-effective threshold (1-3 times per capita GDP of Chinese in 2019).
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrates that AI-based screening is more 
cost-effective compared with conventional ophthalmologist screening and holds 
great promise to be an alternative approach for DR screening in the rural area 
of China.

Rice is a staple food in Senegal, which however imports more than 70% of the 
rice consumed annually to meet its domestic demand. Despite governmental efforts 
to increase rice self-sufficiency, both rice supply and yields remain low. 
Senegalese farmers face challenges related to irrigation infrastructure and 
fertiliser access, besides those derived from climate change. This study applies 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) combined with financial Life Cycle Costing (LCC) to 
evaluate alternative scenarios for rice management in the Senegal River Valley 
and identify sustainability hotspots and potential improvements. Specifically, 
rice cultivation in Ross Béthio (Saint Louis, Senegal) is assessed based on the 
observed agricultural practices during the dry seasons of 2016 and 2017. Two 
scenarios capturing conventional (CONV) and intensive (INT) practices are 
compared to two reference scenarios (SAED scenarios) according to the 
recommendations of the official agricultural advisory service. The INT scenario 
generates the lowest impacts per kg of paddy rice in seven out of thirteen 
impact categories, including climate change, freshwater and marine 
eutrophication, ozone depletion and water scarcity. This is due to the higher 
yields (7.4 t ha-1) relative to CONV (4.8 t ha-1) and the two reference SAED 
scenarios (6.0 t ha-1). The two latter scenarios show the lowest values in the 
remaining categories, although they also generate slightly lower profits than 
INT (138 € t-1 vs. 149 € t-1) due to increased labour costs for additional 
fertilisation treatments. The results from both LCA and LCC underline the 
importance of increasing yields to decrease environmental impacts and production 
costs of rice when estimated per kg of product. Well-designed fertiliser 
application doses and timing and increased mechanisation can deliver further 
environmental benefits. Additional improvements (e.g. in irrigation, crop 
rotations, straw management) could be considered to promote the long-term 
sustainability and profitability of rice production in Senegal. LCA in 
combination with financial LCC is identified as a decision-support tool for 
evaluating the sustainability of alternative crop management practices. Life 
Cycle Thinking can still benefit from experiential learning based on information 
exchange between farmers, researchers and extension agents to contribute to a 
sustainable agriculture and ultimately to food security in Africa.

BACKGROUND: Conflicting data are currently available on the risk of malignancies 
in people affected by multiple sclerosis (pwMS), and the potential relative 
contribution to this risk of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) is still 
debated. Moreover, data on the long-term prognosis of pwMS mostly derive from 
natural history studies and updated observations during the treatment era are 
lacking.
METHODS: Incidence of cancer and mortality were analysed in a pwMS cohort of 
residents of Tuscany over a 17-year period of observation during the treatment 
era and compared with the rates observed in a 1:10 sex- and age-matched control 
population resident in the same geographical area.
RESULTS: Six-hundred and sixty-one pwMS were included; median age 43 years 
(range 19-80); 87% affected by relapsing-remitting MS. Sixty-eight percent of 
the cases were exposed to DMTs over the study period. Age and sex standardized 
incidence of malignancy did not differ between the groups: 3.9 × 1000 (95% 
confidence interval, CI, 3.75-4.15) person-years and 4.1 × 1000 (95% CI 
3.76-4.42) person-years in the MS and control cohorts, respectively. The most 
frequent cancers reported in pwMS were breast, gastrointestinal and 
gynaecological cancers. Standardized mortality rates were 2.0 × 1000 
person-years (95% CI 1.58-2.37) and 2.4 × 1000 (95% CI 2.03-2.78) person-years 
in the MS and control cohorts, respectively, and did not differ between groups, 
also after excluding traumatic cause-of-death (1.6 vs 1.7).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of cancer and mortality did not differ between pwMS 
and the general population residing in the same geographical area, suggesting 
that life expectancy of pwMS has improved over the treatment era.

Explanations for lagging life expectancy in the United States compared to other 
high-income countries have focused largely on "deaths of despair," but attention 
has also shifted to the role of stalling improvements in cardiovascular disease 
and the obesity epidemic. Using harmonized data from the U.S. Health and 
Retirement Study and English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we assess differences 
in self-reported and objective measures of health, among older adults in the 
United States and England and explore whether the differences in body mass index 
(BMI) documented between the United States and England explain the U.S. 
disadvantage. Older adults in the United States have a much higher prevalence of 
diabetes, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high inflammation 
(C-reactive protein) compared to English adults. While the distribution of BMI 
is shifted to the right in the United States with more people falling into 
extreme obesity categories, these differences do not explain the cross-country 
differences in measured biological risk. We conclude by considering how country 
differences in health may have affected the burden of coronavirus disease 2019 
mortality in both countries.

PURPOSE: We aimed to assess the global, regional, and national burdens of low 
back pain (LBP) from 1990 to 2019 by gender, age, and the sociodemographic index 
(SDI) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study.
METHODS: The number of incident cases, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 
age-standardized incidence rates, and age-standardized DALY rates during 
1990-2019 were obtained from the GBD 2019 study. The estimated annual percentage 
changes (EAPCs) in the age-standardized incidence rates and age-standardized 
DALY rates were determined to measure the temporal trends of LBP.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were an estimated 223.5 million cases of LBP and 63.7 
million LBP-related DALYs worldwide. During 1990-2019, the age-standardized 
incidence rate [EAPC =  - 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) - 0.46 to - 0.36] 
and age-standardized DALY rate decreased (EAPC =  - 0.51; 95% CI - 0.56 
to - 0.46) globally. The age-standardized incidence rate of LBP decreased the 
most in low-middle SDI regions. The age-standardized incidence rate of LBP 
decreased the most in South Asia (EAPC, - 1.51), East Asia (EAPC, - 0.68), and 
Australasia (EAPC, - 0.26). The incidence in male subjects was lower than that 
in female subjects. The largest decreases in the age-standardized incidence rate 
and age-standardized DALY rate of LBP were observed in India, and China.
CONCLUSIONS: The global age-standardized incidence rate and age-standardized 
DALY rate of LBP showed a downward trend, especially in East and South Asia. In 
addition, a heavier burden of LBP was observed in older and female populations.

BACKGROUND: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) negatively impacts patients' 
sleep, thereby reducing health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Half of patients 
with inadequately controlled CSU report sleep interference often or every night, 
which can lead to depression, anxiety, social, and work-related problems.
METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b core study 
(NCT02477332) included adult patients ≥18 years with moderate to severe CSU 
inadequately controlled with H1 -antihistamines. The current analysis includes 
patients randomized to receive ligelizumab 72 or 240 mg, omalizumab 300 mg or 
placebo every 4 weeks (q4w) for five injections over 20 weeks with 
treatment-free follow-up for 24 weeks. Patients could enter the open-label 
extension study (NCT02649218) from Week 32 onwards if their weekly urticaria 
activity score was ≥12, which included an open-label treatment (52 weeks of 
ligelizumab 240 mg q4w) and a 48-week post-treatment follow-up. Weekly Sleep 
Interference Scores (SIS7, range 0 [no interference]-21 [substantial 
interference]), Weekly Activity Interference Score (AIS7), Dermatology Life 
Quality Index (DLQI) scores, and Overall Work Impairment were assessed.
RESULTS: Mean baseline SIS7 scores were balanced between the treatment arms for 
ligelizumab 72 mg (n = 84) and 240 mg (n = 85), omalizumab 300 mg (n = 85), and 
placebo (n = 43). By Week 12, patients experienced large improvements in sleep 
interference, with least square mean (standard error) changes from baseline 
(CFB) in SIS7 of -7.84 (0.58), -7.55 (0.61), -6.98 (0.60), and -5.85 (0.81), 
respectively. By Week 12, CFB in AIS7 were -8.25 (0.57), -8.25 (0.59), -7.30 
(0.60), and -5.62 (0.79), DLQI scores were -9.79 (0.77), -9.93 (0.81), -8.35 
(0.79), and -6.99 (1.11), and Overall Work Impairment scores were -28.96 (3.73), 
-30.76 (3.71), -25.74 (3.91), and -20.13 (5.10) for ligelizumab 72 and 240 mg, 
omalizumab 300 mg and placebo, respectively. Improvements in each 
patient-reported outcome were sustained with ligelizumab 240 mg treatment during 
the extension study.
CONCLUSIONS: Ligelizumab showed effective and sustained responses in managing 
sleep interference in patients with CSU, and numerically higher responses than 
with omalizumab and placebo. Treating the symptoms of CSU with ligelizumab 
improved disease burden, HRQoL, and markedly improved sleep quality.

BACKGROUND: Skeletal fluorosis has become a public health issue in recent years 
as its serious impact on patients' life expectancy. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 
(BMP2) plays a key role in promoting osteogenesis. However, the mechanism of 
BMP2-Wnt/β-catenin axis in skeletal fluorosis needs further exploration.
METHODS: The RT-qPCR and western blot assay were carried out to examine the mRNA 
and protein levels. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. A commercial ALP 
assay kit was used to detect ALP activities. Alizarin Red staining was performed 
to measure the formation of mineralized nodules. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) 
was performed to measure the methylation level of BMP2.
RESULTS: Fluoride promoted the expression of osteogenic marker genes (OPN, OCN, 
OSX and RUNX2) and induced the proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 
cells. Fluoride induced hypomethylation and high expression of BMP2. 
Furthermore, knockdown of BMP2 reversed the promoting effect of fluoride on 
osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1. The expression of β-catenin, glycogen 
synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), wingless/integrated 3α (Wnt3α), low-density 
lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) and dishevelled 1 (Dv1) were 
increased in osteoblasts treated with fluoride, however, knockdown of BMP2 
reversed this phenomenon. Simultaneous knockdown of BMP2 and β-catenin 
significantly inhibited the differentiation of osteoblasts induced by fluoride.
CONCLUSION: Fluoride contributed to proliferation and differentiation of 
osteoblasts through BMP2-Wnt/β-catenin axis, providing a feasible theoretical 
basis for the treatment of skeletal fluorosis.

A series of novel non-covalent peptidomimetic proteasome inhibitors possessing 
bulky group at the C-terminus and N-alkylation at the N-terminus were designed 
with the aim to increase metabolic stabilities in vivo. All the target compounds 
were screened for their inhibitory activities against human 20S proteasome, and 
most analogs exhibited notable potency compared with the positive control 
bortezomib with IC50 values lower than 10 nM, which also displayed potent 
cytotoxic activities against multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines and human acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Furthermore, whole blood stability and in vivo 
proteasome inhibitory activity experiments of selected compounds were conducted 
for further evaluation, and the representative compound 43 
(IC50 = 8.39 ± 2.32 nM, RPMI-8226: IC50 = 15.290 ± 2.281 nM, MM-1S: 
IC50 = 9.067 ± 3.103 nM, MV-4-11: IC50 = 2.464 ± 0.713 nM) revealed a half-life 
extension of greater than 9-fold (329.21 min VS 36.79 min) and potent proteasome 
inhibitory activity in vivo. The positive results confirmed the reliability of 
the metabolism guided optimization strategy, and the analogs discovered are 
potential leads for exploring new anti-MM drugs.

OBJECTIVES: New health technologies are often expensive, but may nevertheless 
meet standard thresholds for cost effectiveness, a situation exemplified by 
recent hepatitis C cures. Currently, cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) does not 
supply practical means of weighing trade-offs between cost-effectiveness and 
affordability, particularly when costs and benefits are temporally separated and 
in health systems with multiple payers, such as the United States. We formally 
characterized disagreements in CEA theory and identified how these trade-offs 
are presently addressed in practice.
METHODS: We surveyed 170 health economics researchers.
RESULTS: When presented with a hypothetical cost-effective drug therapy in the 
United States that would require 20% of a state's Medicaid budget over 5 years, 
34% of survey respondents recommended that policy makers fund the drug for all 
patients and 26% for a subset. By contrast, 26% recommended against funding the 
drug. We found additional disagreement regarding whether the willingness-to-pay 
threshold should be based on the budget (42%) or societal preferences (41%) and 
identified 4 approaches to weighing cost-effectiveness and affordability. A 
total of 61% of respondents did not believe that the threshold used in their 
last article (most often 1×-3× per capita gross domestic product) represented 
either the budget or societal willingness-to-pay threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: We use these findings to recommend metrics that can inform 
translation of CEA theory into practice. By contextualizing cost and value, 
researchers can provide more actionable policy recommendations.

OBJECTIVES: Older patients with head and neck cancer often have comorbidity, 
have reduced life-expectancy and await intensive treatment. For the 
decision-making process, knowledge of a patient's health outcome prioritization 
is of paramount importance. We aim to study the health outcome priorities of 
older patients with head and neck cancer, and to evaluate whether general 
health, markers of physical, cognitive, and social functioning, and quality of 
life are associated with health outcome prioritization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients aged ≥70 years with head and neck cancer 
received a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and their priorities were assessed 
using the Outcome Prioritization Tool (OPT). Distribution of first priority, and 
associations with general health, markers of physical, cognitive, and social 
functioning, and quality of life were evaluated using ANOVA or chi-square.
RESULTS: Of the 201 included patients, the OPT was available in 170 patients. 
The majority prioritized maintaining independence (n = 91, 53.3%), followed by 
extending life (n = 58, 34.1%), reducing pain (n = 14, 8.2%), and reducing other 
symptoms (n = 7, 4.1%). Housing situation, Body Mass Index, presence of 
musculoskeletal diseases, and quality of life were significantly related to 
prioritization of health outcomes. Reducing pain or other symptoms was more 
often prioritized by patients who lived alone, had a history of musculoskeletal 
problems, or had poor perceived quality of life. Age, sex, comorbidity, and 
markers of physical and cognitive functioning were not associated with health 
prioritization.
CONCLUSION: Maintaining independence is most often prioritized by older patients 
with head and neck cancer. In addition, we found that health outcome priorities 
of older patients are only limited based on general and specific health 
characteristics. We suggest to systematically discuss patients' priorities in 
order to facilitate complex treatment decisions in older patients with cancer.
