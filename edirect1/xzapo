topics include active surveillance, surgery, radiotherapy, high-intensity 
focalized ultrasound (HIFU). Current hormone treatment modalities as well as 
chemotherapy for hormone-resistant prostate cancer (HRPC) management are also 
reported. Reasonable evidence has supported the safety and feasibility, during a 
period of 5-10 years, of an active surveillance regimen for men with low-risk 
prostate cancer. Radical prostatectomy is an effective form of therapy for 
patients with clinically significant prostate cancer. Outcomes are highly 
sensitive to variations in surgical technique. The risks of perioperative 
complications such as urinary and sexual dysfunction appear to be as great with 
robotic-assisted prostatectomy as with any other technique. External beam 
radiotherapy (EBRT) is an effective noninvasive form of curative therapy with a 
long-term risk of troublesome bowel and sexual and urinary dysfunction. EBRT can 
also be used in adjuvant manner or in combination. Brachytherapy, is a 
convenient effective form of radiotherapy targeted for selected patients with 
clinically confined cancer without evidence of extraprostatic extension on 
imaging. Excellent outcomes require meticulous technique. Acute urinary symptoms 
are frequent; and the long-term risks of proctitis and erectile dysfunction seem 
comparable to the risks associated with external beam radiotherapy. HIFU has 
been used widely in Europe for complete ablation of the prostate, especially in 
the elderly who are unwilling or unable to undergo more invasive radical 
therapy. For low- or intermediate-risk cancer, the short- and intermediate-term 
oncologic results have been acceptable but need confirmation in prospective 
multicenter trials presently underway. HIFU is associated with a risk of acute 
urinary symptoms requiring transurethral resection before or after HIFU. 
Erectile function has not been adequately documented after HIFU. HIFU holds 
promise for focal ablation of prostate cancer and in case of recurrence after 
EBRT. Androgen-deprivation therapy is not recommended for men with localized 
prostate cancer. For locally extensive cancer, androgen-deprivation therapy 
should be used alone only for the relief of local symptoms in men with a life 
expectancy of < 5 years who are not eligible for more aggressive treatment. 
Management of HRPC is actually accepted with docetaxel chemotherapy based 
regimens.

Air pollution consists from a mixture of gases, fluids and solid particles. The 
highest attention receive the fine particulate matter (less than 10 microm in 
diameter), containing thousands of different substances and being able to 
penetrate the bronchial tree. The smaller particles (less than 2.5 microm in 
diameter) penetrate up to the alveoli and the finest ones into the blood stream. 
Within their deposits, particles trigger a cascade of inflammatory reactions and 
an oxidative stress. They initiate many short-term and long-term 
pathophysiological processes. Epidemiologic surveys demonstrate that the higher 
concentration of pollutants is usually related to the higher overall and 
particularly cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Negative effects are 
usually rather small and can be drown with other factors, namely the classical 
risk factors. Because pollution affects many people its effects can be very 
serious. It was confirmed in the US that the long lasting decrease of air 
pollution is accompanied with the prolongation of the average life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: To gain knowledge about the utility of hysterectomy in a real-world 
setting and to relate the utility of the intervention to its costs.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: University referral hospital in Helsinki.
POPULATION: A total of 337 women entering for routine hysterectomy due to a 
benign disease (210 benign uterine or ovarian cause, 20 endometriosis, 51 
uterovaginal prolapse, 56 menorrhagia).
METHODS: Patients filled in the 15D health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
questionnaire before and six months after the operation. Costs were examined 
from the perspective of secondary care provider. Benefits of surgery were 
extrapolated till the end of remaining statistical life expectancy of each woman 
in the prolapse group and until menopause in the other groups.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HRQoL and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained.
RESULTS: Mean [standard deviation (SD)] HRQoL score (on a 0-1 scale) in the 
whole group improved from the preoperative of 0.905 (0.073) to 0.925 (0.077) six 
months after the operation (p < 0.001). The largest mean (SD) improvement was 
seen in patients with endometriosis [0.048 (0.067)] followed by those with 
menorrhagia [0.024 (0.054)], benign uterine or ovarian cause [0.018 (0.071)], 
and prolapse [0.017 (0.055)]. In the whole group, the intervention produced a 
mean (SD) of 0.222 (1.270) QALYs at mean (SD) direct hospital cost of euro3,138 
(2,098). Consequently, the cost per QALY gained in the whole group was 
euro14,135 varying from euro3,720 to 31,570 in the disease groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost per QALY gained for hysterectomy for benign uterine 
disorders is strongly dependent on the indication for surgery.

Impact of chondroitin sulphate on health utility in patients with knee 
osteoarthritis: towards economic analysis.

Liège, CHU Sart-Tilman, Liège, Belgium. olivier.bruyere@ulg.ac.be

OBJECTIVES: The first objective was to assess the effect of the chondroitin 4 
and 6 sulphate (CS) on health-related quality of life using utility values in 
patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) during a 24-month treatment course. The 
second objective was, using these data, to conduct economic analyses.
METHODS: Data from the STOPP study was used. This study was a randomised, 
double-blind, placebo (PL) -controlled trial of 2-year duration. In the STOPP 
study, authors assessed quality of life using the Western Ontario and McMaster 
Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). WOMAC scores were translated into Health Utility 
Index (HUI) scores using a specific formula. Incremental cost effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) was calculated taking into account the cost of CS and its effect on 
HUI scores, compared to PL.
RESULTS: At baseline, the mean (SD) HUI scores were 0.59 (0.17), and 0.59 (0.18) 
for the PL and CS groups, respectively (p=0.31 between the two groups). The mean 
(SD) HUI scores changes from baseline to 6 months were 0.02 (0.02), and 0.05 
(0.01) for the PL and CS groups, respectively (p=0.03). After 24 months of 
follow-up, HUI score increases by 0.04 (0.02) in the PL group and by 0.05 (0.02) 
in the CS group (p=0.37). Using the price bracket of CS in Europe, ICER 
assessment always resulted in a cost below €30,000 per QALY gained, after 6, 12 
and 24 months of treatment.
CONCLUSION: CS treatment increases health utilities in patients with knee OA 
compared to PL over the first 6 months of treatment. Economic evaluation based 
on these data suggests that CS treatment could be considered as cost-effective 
in patients with knee OA up to a period of 24 months. A limitation in this study 
is the absence of direct utility assessment as well as the absence of effective 
treatment as comparator.

INTRODUCTION: Canadian, Inuit, full term infants have the highest rate of 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection globally, which results in 
substantial costs associated hospitalisation.
METHODS: Decision-analytical techniques were used to estimate the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for palivizumab compared to no prophylaxis for 
Inuit infants of all gestational age. The time horizon was that of life-time 
follow-up, and costs and effectiveness were discounted at 5% per year. Costs 
(2007 CAD$) for palivizumab, hospitalisation (including medical evacuation, 
intensive care unit [ICU]), physician visits, and transportation were calculated 
based on the Canadian payer's perspective. Benefits on decreasing RSV 
hospitalisation were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). One-way 
and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted, varying: mortality 
rates, utilities, length of stay in hospital and ICU.
RESULTS: For all of Baffin Island infants (<1 year), the ICER was $39,435/QALY. 
However, when infants were grouped by age and area of residence, those residing 
in Iqaluit (<1 year) had an ICER of $152,145/QALY, while those residing in rural 
areas (outside of Iqaluit) had an ICER of $24,750/QALY. Prophylaxis was a 
dominant strategy (cost saving) for rural infants under 6 months of age, with 
the PSA demonstrating that it was dominant 98% of the time.
CONCLUSIONS: The ICERs suggested that palivizumab is a cost-effective option for 
the prevention of RSV for Inuit infants on Baffin Island compared to no 
prophylaxis. Palivizumab is highly cost effective in Arctic infants <1 year of 
age specifically residing outside of Iqaluit and is a dominant strategy for 
those under 6 months of age in rural areas. However, palivizumab is not cost 
effective compared to no treatment for infants of all ages residing in Iqaluit.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the likely cost-effectiveness of introducing routine HPV 
vaccination in Iceland.
DESIGN: Prospective cost-effectiveness analysis of human papilloma virus (HPV) 
vaccination.
SETTING AND SAMPLE: Population of 12-year-old girls in the Icelandic population.
METHODS: A model was developed, comparing a cohort of all 12-year-old girls 
alive in year 2006, with or without vaccination. The model was based on the 
epidemiology of cervical cancer in Iceland and its premalignant stages as well 
as the costs involved in the treatment of each stage, assuming that the vaccines 
only prevent infections caused by HPV 16/18 at an efficacy of 95% and 
participation rate of 90%, no catch-up vaccination, no vaccination of boys and 
no booster dose needed. All costs were calculated on the basis of the price 
level of mid-year 2006 with a 3% discount rate. Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio calculations were performed and sensitivity analysis was carried out on 
factors most relevant for cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Vaccination costs in excess of savings would be about euro313.000/year. 
Vaccination would reduce the number of women diagnosed with cervical cancer by 
almost 9, prevent the death of 1.7 women and result in 16.9 quality-adjusted 
life years gained annually. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
calculated to be about euro18.500/quality-adjusted life year saved.
CONCLUSION: HPV vaccination seems to be cost-effective in Iceland, but this was 
sensitive to various parameters in the model, mainly the discount rate, the 
price of the vaccines and the need for a booster dose.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize the methodological approaches used in published 
decision-analytic models evaluating interventions for acute stroke treatment, to 
highlight key components of decision-analytic models of stroke treatment, and to 
discuss challenges for developing stroke decision models.
METHODS: A review of the published literature was performed using Medline, to 
identify studies involving mathematical decision models to evaluate 
interventions for acute stroke treatment. Articles were analyzed to determine 
key components of a stroke model and to note areas in which data are lacking.
RESULTS: We identified 13 published models of acute stroke treatment. These 
models typically possessed a short-term treatment module and a long-term 
post-treatment module. The following aspects of economic modeling were found to 
be relevant for developing a stroke model: modeling approach and health state; 
health state transition probabilities; estimation of short-term, long-term, and 
indirect costs; health state utilities; poststroke mortality; time horizon; 
model validation; and estimation of parameter uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS: Data gaps have limited the development of economic models in stroke 
to date. In order to more accurately assess the long-term incremental impact of 
a new treatment of stroke, future research is needed to address these data gaps. 
We recommend that the complexity of models for examining the cost-effectiveness 
of an acute stroke treatment be kept to a minimum such that it can incorporate 
the currently available data without making a large number of assumptions around 
the data.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association between continuous antipsychotic use 
and health-related quality of life (HRQL) 3-year change in the European 
Schizophrenia Outpatients Health Outcomes (EU-SOHO) study.
METHODS: EU-SOHO is an observational study of outcomes associated with 
antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia in an outpatient setting. HRQL was 
assessed at study entry and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months using the 
EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D). UK population time trade-off (TTO) tariffs were applied to 
the self-rated EQ-5D health states to calculate HRQL ratings (0 = death, 1 = 
best). An epoch analysis approach was used as a conceptual framework to analyze 
the longitudinal data. Follow-up was divided into epochs or periods of 
continuous treatment. When a patient changed antipsychotic treatment, he or she 
was considered to have a new observation. Multilevel models were employed to 
evaluate the association of HRQL with medication and other clinical and 
sociodemographic variables for each epoch. A total of 9340 patients were 
analyzed (42.1% women; mean age 40 years).
RESULTS: Mean EQ-5D scores increased over time; the largest improvement occurred 
in the first 6 months (mean increase of 0.19). Longer duration of illness and 
older age at first treatment were associated with worse baseline EQ-5D scores. 
Improvements in EQ-5D scores were greater for more socially active patients or 
those in paid employment. Few significant differences were found between 
antipsychotic medications. Olanzapine and clozapine were associated with higher 
HRQL increases.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous antipsychotic treatment is associated with important 
HRQL benefits at 3 years, most of which occurs during the first 6 months. 
Although some medications are associated with better HRQL outcomes, differences 
are small.

BACKGROUND: Recently published results from a large randomized trial (Canadian 
Cervical Cancer Screening Trial study group) suggest that human papillomavirus 
testing followed by Pap smear-based triage for human papillomavirus positive 
women may be an effective way to screen women for cervical cancer. We determined 
the potential cost-effectiveness of including human papillomavirus tests for 
cervical cancer screening for Canada and three provinces: Alberta, Newfoundland 
and Ontario.
METHODS: We developed four Markov decision models using data from relevant 
Canadian and provincial studies and databases. The models were used to determine 
the number of false positive test results, cancers, lifetime costs and 
life-expectancy for 27 different screening strategies that varied by age to 
begin screening (18 or 25 years), screening interval (one, two, three, or five 
years) and whether the currently recommended strategy (screening every year from 
age 18 until 21 and then every three years afterwards with conventional Paps) 
was conducted prior to age 25. Strategies were compared using incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Screening strategies beginning at age 18 were associated with a 
substantial increase in the number of false-positive test results but only small 
differences in the number of cancers compared to the same strategy conducted 
beginning at age 25. Strategies of human papillomavirus testing first, followed 
by triage with Pap smears were associated with lower costs and greater increases 
in life-expectancy than the currently recommended screening strategy in Canada.
CONCLUSION: A strategy of human papillomavirus testing beginning at age 25, with 
Pap triage for women with positive human papillomavirus results may be more 
effective at reducing cervical cancer at a lower cost than the current 
recommended strategy for screening in Canada.

Author information:

Shirin.Heidari@iasociety.org.

With the success of antiretrovirals and increased access to this lifesaving 
treatment, the life expectancy of people living with HIV has been substantially 
increased and, in many instances, is comparable to that of the general 
population. However, HIV infection, as well as its treatment, can cause 
physical, psychological or social disabilities that prevent people living with 
HIV from full and equal participation in society. At the same time, there is 
evidence that people with disabilities are at greater risk of contracting HIV. 
Although more attention is being paid to these overlapping fields, the field of 
HIV and disability remains largely overlooked.The Journal of the International 
AIDS Society is publishing, for the first time, a thematic section consisting of 
a number of papers on HIV and disability to provide readers with an update of 
developments in the field.

AIM: To construct eukaryotic expression plasmids encoding Sox2 and Sox2 K247R 
and identify their expression and SUMOylation.
METHODS: With gift plasmid encoding Sox2 gene as a template, Sox2 K247R was 
obtained by overlapping extension PCR, followed by construction of pCMV-HA-Sox2 
and pCMV-HA-Sox2 K247R. After enzyme digestion analysis and DNA sequencing, 
these two constructs were transfected or co-transfected with pCMV-Myc-SUMO1 into 
293FT cells by lipofectin method. Western blot was employed to analyze 
expression and SUMO ylation of Sox2.
RESULTS: It was revealed that eukaryotic expression vectors were constructed 
with correct sequence, where in mutant Sox2, the AAG codon was switched to CGG 
codon. Western blot results showed that good expression of both wt and mut Sox2, 
of which the latter could not be modified by SUMO1.
CONCLUSION: Successful construction and expression of Sox2 and Sox2 K247R. Sox2 
could be SUMO lyated in vitro but Sox2 K247R not.

Sciences, Tehran, Iran. v_rahimi@sina.tums.ac.ir

STUDY DESIGN: Investigation of burden of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) 
using disease modeling.
OBJECTIVES: The present paper is intended to estimate the SCI burden for the 
year 2008.
SETTING: Tehran, capital of Iran.
METHODS: Epidemiological data needed to calculate Disability-Adjusted Life-Years 
(DALYs) for SCI, was estimated according to prevalence, duration and relative 
risk of mortality using DISMOD software. For DALY calculation, the years of life 
lost because of premature mortality (YLL) was added to the number of years lost 
because of disability (YLD). To calculate DALYs for SCI, first year DALY 
calculated separately and for the next years, the DALY was assessed for six 
different clinical presentations of traumatic SCI including quadriplegia, 
quadriparesis, paraplegia, paraparesis, hemiplegia and hemiparesis.
RESULTS: In first year following SCI, the DALY was 3772 years, which has 0.5 
DALY per 1000 people and YLL/DALY was 89.3%. Following the first year, the DALY 
was 435 for quadriplegia, 163 for quadriparesis, 868 for paraplegia, 164 for 
paraparesis, 26 for hemiplegia and 14 for hemiparesis. The total YLL for 
traumatic SCI was 4077 years and total YLD was 1364 years (total YLL/DALY was 
74.9%) and total DALY was 5441 years, (M/F=2.0), which has 0.7 DALY per 1000 
people in Tehran in 2008.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high burden for SCI. Identifying the risk 
factors of SCI, and performing cost-effective preventive interventions for 
reducing burden of SCI is recommended.

Author information:
(1)Department of Symptom Control and Palliative Care, Cross Cancer Institute, 
11560 University Avenue, Edmonton, AB, Canada. sonyalow@cancerboard.ab.ca

GOALS OF THE WORK: The purpose of the present study was to examine the physical 
activity interests and preferences of palliative cancer patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty advanced cancer patients aged 18 years or older with 
clinician-estimated life expectancy of less than 12 months and Palliative 
Performance Scale greater than 30% were recruited from an outpatient palliative 
care clinic and a palliative home care program. An interviewer-administered 
survey was used to assess physical activity behavior, interests, and 
preferences.
MAIN RESULTS: The majority of palliative cancer patients in this sample 
indicated that they would be interested and felt able to participate in a 
physical activity program. There were strong preferences for home-based physical 
activity programs that could be completed alone. The majority of participants in 
this sample reported walking as the type of physical activity in which they were 
most interested.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that this sample of palliative cancer 
patients is interested and feel able to participate in a physical activity 
program. Examining these unique physical activity preferences may aid in the 
development of an appropriate physical activity program for palliative cancer 
patients that can be tested in clinical research.

(1)Forschergruppe Diabetes der Technischen Universität München, Munich, Germany.

Infant diet affects health and development. The aim of our study was to 
investigate WHO infant feeding compliance in children who have a first degree 
family history of type 1 diabetes (T1D). One hundred and fifty children who were 
first degree relatives of patients with T1D were intensively followed from birth 
in the BABYDIET intervention study. Infant feeding, infections, and medication 
were recorded daily by participating families. Weight and length of children 
were obtained from paediatric records. Only 5% of the families followed the WHO 
recommendations for infant feeding that include full breastfeeding for at least 
6 months (18.8% of children) and introduction of complementary foods under 
continued breastfeeding thereafter (22.2% of children). Maternal age in the 
first quartile (<29 years; p<0.0001), and maternal smoking (p<0.0001) were 
associated with an earlier introduction of solid food and reduced breastfeeding. 
Full breastfeeding > or =6 months was associated with reduced frequency of 
gastrointestinal infections (12 vs. 38%, p=0.02) and antibiotic treatment (24 
vs. 48%, p=0.04). Our findings indicate that WHO infant feeding recommendations 
were poorly followed by families with a family history of T1D. Action to improve 
levels of infant feeding behaviour is essential, especially among young mothers 
with T1D.

The authors investigated the relationship between the September 11, 2001 
terrorist attacks and suicide risk in New York City from 1990 to 2006. The 
average monthly suicide rate over the study period was 0.56 per 100,000 people. 
The monthly rate after September 2001 was 0.11 per 100,000 people lower as 
compared to the rate in the period before. However, the rate of change in 
suicide was not significantly different before and after the disaster, and 
regression discontinuity analysis indicated no change at this date. There was no 
net change in the suicide rate in New York City attributable to this disaster, 
suggesting that factors other than exposure to traumatic events (e.g., cultural 
norms, availability of lethal methods) may be key drivers of suicide risk in 
this context.

Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and critical limb ischemia are the 
main candidates for limb amputations and have a poor life expectancy. 
Frequently, these patients are not eligible for either surgical or percutaneous 
interventions aimed at mechanical revascularization. Therefore, new strategies 
need to be identified to offer these patients a viable therapeutic option. Gene 
and cell therapy hold great promise for the treatment of peripheral vascular 
diseases because, in animal models, local delivery of growth factors and 
endothelial progenitor cells result in new blood vessel formation and 
regeneration of ischemic tissues. In this article, are reviewed phase I and 
phase II gene, and cell therapy clinical trials in patients with PAD.

Curcumin, resveratrol and flavonoids as anti-inflammatory, cyto- and 
DNA-protective dietary compounds.

Parklands Drive, Southport, QLD 4222, Australia.

Numerous dietary compounds, ubiquitous in fruits, vegetables and spices have 
been isolated and evaluated during recent years for their therapeutic potential. 
These compounds include flavonoid and non-flavonoid polyphenols, which describe 
beneficial effects against a variety of ailments. The notion that these plant 
products have health promoting effects emerged because their intake was related 
to a reduced incidence of cancer, cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, and 
age-related diseases. Exposure of the body to a stressful environment challenges 
cell survival and increases the risk of chronic disease developing. The 
polyphenols afford protection against various stress-induced toxicities through 
modulating intercellular cascades which inhibit inflammatory molecule synthesis, 
the formation of free radicals, nuclear damage and induce antioxidant enzyme 
expression. These responses have the potential to increase life expectancy. The 
present review article focuses on curcumin, resveratrol, and flavonoids and 
seeks to summarize their anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective and DNA-protective 
properties.

Cagliari, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Recent advances in the management of thalassemia have significantly 
improved life expectancy and quality of life of patients with this 
hemoglobinopathy, with a consequent increase in their reproductive potential and 
desire to have children.
DESIGN AND METHODS: We describe the methods of conception and delivery, as well 
as the course and outcome of pregnancy including transfusions, iron overload and 
chelation in 46 women with thalassemia major (58 pregnancies) and in 11 women 
with thalassemia intermedia (17 pregnancies). Conception was achieved after 
gonadotrophin-induced ovulation in 33 of the women with thalassemia major and 
spontaneously in all of those with thalassemia intermedia.
RESULTS: Among the women with thalassemia major, 91% of the pregnancies resulted 
in successful delivery of 45 singleton live-born neonates, five sets of twins 
and one set of triplets. No secondary complications of iron overload developed 
or worsened during pregnancy. When considering only the singleton pregnancies, 
the proportion of babies with intrauterine growth retardation did not differ 
from that reported in the general Italian population. The high prevalence of 
pre-term births (32.7%) was mostly related to multiple pregnancies and 
precautionary reasons. Pregnancy was safe in most women with thalassemia major 
or intermedia. However, women with thalassemia intermedia who had never 
previously been transfused or who had received only minimal transfusion therapy 
were at risk of severe alloimmune anemia if blood transfusions were required 
during pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Provided that a multidisciplinary team is available, pregnancy is 
possible, safe and usually has a favorable outcome in patients with thalassemia. 
In women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, gonadal function is usually intact 
and fertility is usually retrievable.

Rumination fosters indecision in dysphoria.

This study investigated the effects of rumination on indecision, assessed as 
high levels of perceived decision difficulty, low confidence in a decision, and 
decision latency. Dysphoric and nondysphoric participants were assigned to 
either a rumination or a distraction induction. Subsequently, they made four 
decisions with alleged real-life consequences. As predicted, rumination 
exhibited a negative effect on dysphoric participants' decision-making process. 
They experienced the decisions as more difficult and had less confidence in 
their choices. No effects emerged on the measure of decision time. Mediation 
analyses revealed that increased difficulty of the decisions was due to 
self-focused thinking as a cognitive consequence of rumination, while reduced 
confidence in the decisions was partly mediated by negative affect that resulted 
from rumination. The finding that rumination affects the important life domain 
of decision making by fostering indecision in dysphoric individuals is a central 
extension of previous studies on rumination's consequences. In addition, these 
results provide insight into the depressive symptom of indecisiveness by 
revealing its underlying mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) provides dramatic 
health benefits for HIV-infected individuals in Africa, and widespread 
implementation of HAART is proceeding rapidly. Little is known about the cost 
and cost effectiveness of HAART programmes.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the incremental cost effectiveness of a home-based HAART 
programme in rural Uganda.
METHODS: A computer-based, deterministic cost-effectiveness model was used to 
assess a broad range of economic inputs and health outcomes. From the societal 
perspective, the cost effectiveness of HAART and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis was 
compared with cotrimoxazole alone, and with the period before either 
intervention. Data for 24 months were derived from a trial of home-based HAART 
in 1045 patients in the Tororo District in eastern Uganda. Costs and outcomes 
were projected out to 15 years. All costs are in year 2004 values. The main 
outcome measures were HAART programme costs, health benefits accruing to HAART 
recipients, averted HIV infections in adults and children and the resulting 
effects on medical care costs. The first-line HAART regimen consisted of 
standard doses of stavudine, lamivudine, and either nevirapine or, for patients 
with active tuberculosis, efavirenz. Second-line therapy consisted of tenofovir, 
didanosine and lopinavir/ritonavir. For children, first-line HAART consisted of 
zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine syrup; second-line therapy was stavudine, 
didanosine and lopinavir/ritonavir.
RESULTS: The HAART programme, standardized for 1000 patients, cost an 
incremental $US1.39 million in its first 2 years. Compared with cotrimoxazole 
prophylaxis alone, the programme reduced mortality by 87%, and averted 6861 
incremental disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Benefits were accrued from 
reduced mortality in HIV-infected adults (67.5% of all benefits), prevention of 
death in HIV-negative children (20.7%), averted HIV infections in adults (9.1%) 
and children (1.0%), and improved health status (1.7%). The net programme cost, 
including the medical cost implications of these health benefits, was $US4.10 
million. The net cost per DALY averted was $US597 compared with cotrimoxazole 
alone. Many HIV interventions have a cost-effectiveness ratio in the range of 
$US1-150 per DALY averted.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a home-based HAART programme in rural 
Africa may be more cost effective than most previous estimates for 
facility-based HAART programmes, but remains less cost effective than many HIV 
prevention and care interventions, including cotrimoxazole prophylaxis.

Glucocorticoid signaling in the cell. Expanding clinical implications to complex 
human behavioral and somatic disorders.

Glucocorticoids contribute to the maintenance of basal and stress-related 
homeostasis in all higher organisms, and influence a large proportion of the 
expressed human genome, and their effects spare almost no organs or tissues. 
Glucocorticoids regulate many functions of the central nervous system, such as 
arousal, cognition, mood, sleep, the activity and direction of intermediary 
metabolism, the maintenance of a proper cardiovascular tone, the activity and 
quality of the immune and inflammatory reaction, including the manifestations of 
the sickness syndrome, and growth and reproduction. The numerous actions of 
glucocorticoids are mediated by a set of at least 16 glucocorticoid receptor 
(GR) isoforms forming homo- or hetero-dimers. The GRs consist of multifunctional 
domain proteins operating as ligand-dependent transcription factors that 
interact with many other cell signaling systems, including large and small G 
proteins. The presence of multiple GR monomers and homo- or hetero-dimers 
expressed in a cell-specific fashion at different quantities with quantitatively 
and qualitatively different transcriptional activities suggest that the 
glucocorticoid signaling system is highly stochastic. Glucocorticoids are 
heavily involved in human pathophysiology and influence life expectancy. Common 
behavioral and/or somatic complex disorders, such as anxiety, depression, 
insomnia, chronic pain and fatigue syndromes, obesity, the metabolic syndrome, 
essential hypertension, diabetes type 2, atherosclerosis with its cardiovascular 
sequelae, and osteoporosis, as well as autoimmune inflammatory and allergic 
disorders, all appear to have a glucocorticoid-regulated component.

Medicine, London WC1E 7HT. andrew.hutchings@lshtm.ac.uk

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact and cost effectiveness of a programme to 
transform adult critical care throughout England initiated in late 2000.
DESIGN: Evaluation of trends in inputs, processes, and outcomes during 1998-2000 
compared with last quarter of 2000-6.
SETTING: 96 critical care units in England.
PARTICIPANTS: 349,817 admissions to critical care units.
INTERVENTIONS: Adoption of key elements of modernisation and increases in 
capacity. Units were categorised according to when they adopted key elements of 
modernisation and increases in capacity.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Trends in inputs (beds, costs), processes (transfers 
between units, discharge practices, length of stay, readmissions), and outcomes 
(unit and hospital mortality), with adjustment for case mix. Differences in 
annual costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) adjusted for case mix were 
used to calculate net monetary benefits (valuing a QALY gain at pound20,000 
($33,170, euro22 100)). The incremental net monetary benefits were reported as 
the difference in net monetary benefits after versus before 2000.
RESULTS: In the six years after 2000, the risk of unit mortality adjusted for 
case mix fell by 11.3% and hospital mortality by 13.4% compared with the steady 
state in the three preceding years. This was accompanied by substantial 
reductions both in transfers between units and in unplanned night discharges. 
The mean annual net monetary benefit increased significantly after 2000 (from 
pound402 ($667, euro445) to pound1096 ($1810, euro1210)), indicating that the 
changes were relatively cost effective. The relative contribution of the 
different initiatives to these improvements is unclear.
CONCLUSION: Substantial improvements in NHS critical care have occurred in 
England since 2000. While it is unclear which factors were responsible, 
collectively the interventions represented a highly cost effective use of NHS 
resources.

BACKGROUND: Resections for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma have now been 
carried out systematically for over 70 years. However, opinions still differ as 
to the results. Some consider it unresectable, whereas others claim a high 
survival percentage and recommend resections.
METHODS: The literature on this surgery has been scrutinized from the onset, and 
790 studies have been found that deal with resections and reveal survival 
information.
RESULTS: Review reveals that the percentage of survivals is exaggerated with 
life-table methods when there is censoring of the data. Duplication of reporting 
survivors is rampant.
CONCLUSION: After adjusting for calculations and duplications, the total number 
of 5-year survivors can hardly be more than 700-800.

Treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Salgo R(1), Thaçi D.

Author information:
(1)Department of Dermatology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

Psoriasis, a chronic common immune-mediated disease with frequent 
remitting/relapsing courses, has a high negative impact on the quality of life, 
especially in patients moderately or severely affected by the disease. It is 
also associated with various co-morbidities resulting in a decreased life 
expectancy and remarkable socioeconomic costs. At least one third of the 
patients who suffer from it has moderate or severe psoriasis and require 
continuous treatment to control disease activity. The therapeutic approach in 
daily practice is usually determined by the severity of the disease. Whether the 
definition of disease severity is not always clear, there is a considerable 
number of patients requiring systemic treatment to control the symptoms of 
psoriasis. The treatment options available for the management of moderate-severe 
psoriasis have dramatically increased over the past decade, and now range from 
phototherapy to traditional systemic treatments to biologics. Available data 
from clinical trials and growing number of patients treated with biologics shows 
that this new agent are effective and relatively safe to control psoriasis, and 
are coupled with improved tolerability, convenience and improvement in quality 
of life. This review shortly presents the characteristics, safety and efficacy 
profile of the conventional and newer systemic drugs used in moderate-to-severe 
psoriasis.

Massachusetts, USA. Lisa_Kenney@DFCI.harvard.edu

BACKGROUND: Young adult survivors of childhood cancer have an increased risk for 
treatment-related morbidity and mortality. In this study, the authors assessed 
how treatment for childhood cancer affects older-adult health and health 
practices.
METHODS: One hundred seven adults treated for childhood cancer between 1947 and 
1968, known to have survived past age 50 years, were identified from a 
single-institution cohort established in 1975. Updated vital status on eligible 
cases was obtained from public records. Survivors and a control group of their 
age-matched siblings and cousins completed a mailed survey to assess physical 
and social function, healthcare practices, and the prevalence of common adult 
illnesses.
RESULTS: Of the 107 survivors known to be alive at age 50 years, 16 were 
deceased at follow-up; 7 deaths could be associated with prior treatment (second 
malignancy in radiation field [3], small bowel obstruction after abdominal 
radiation [2], and cardiac disease after chest irradiation [2]). The 55 
survivors (median age, 56 years; range, 51-71 years), and 32 family controls 
(median age, 58 years; range, 48-70 years), reported similar health practices, 
health-related quality of life, and social function. However, survivors reported 
more frequent visits to healthcare providers (P < .05), more physical 
impairments (P < .05), fatigue (P = .02), hypertension (P = .001), and coronary 
artery disease (P = .01). An increased risk of hypertension was associated with 
nephrectomy during childhood (odds ratio, 18.9; 95% confidence interval, 
3.0-118.8).
CONCLUSIONS: The oldest adult survivors of childhood cancer continue to be at 
risk for treatment-related complications that potentially decrease their life 
expectancy and compromise their quality of life.
