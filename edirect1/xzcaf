Combined treatment is more effective than single treatment against most forms of 
cancer. In this work, doxorubicin loaded chitosan-W18 O49 nanoparticles combined 
with the photothermal therapy and chemotherapy are fabricated through the 
electrostatic interaction between positively charged chitosan and negatively 
charged W18 O49 nanoparticles. The in vitro and in vivo behaviors of these 
nanoparticles are examined by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron 
microscopy, cytotoxicity, near-infrared fluorescence imaging, and tumor growth 
inhibition experiment. These nanoparticles have a mean size around 110 nm and 
show a pH sensitive drug release behavior. After irradiation by the 980 nm 
laser, these nanoparticles show more pronounced cytotoxicity against HeLa cells 
than that of free doxorubicin or photothermal therapy alone. The in vivo 
experiments confirm that their antitumor ability is significantly improved, 
resulting in superior efficiency in impeding tumor growth and extension of the 
lifetime of mice.

Background Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated substantial clinical 
benefit for thrombectomy in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and proximal 
anterior circulation arterial occlusion. Aim We investigated the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of thrombectomy after thrombolysis versus thrombolysis alone 
using real-world outcome data on need for health care, home help and nursing 
home care. Methods We used real-life resource use and survival data from the 
Swedish Stroke Register and pooled outcomes from five randomised controlled 
trials published in 2015 in a newly constructed Markov cost-effectiveness model 
with a societal perspective. Data were stratified by age (18-64; 65-74; 75-84 
years) and modified Rankin scale at three months for patients with an index 
ischaemic stroke in 2014 fulfilling inclusion criteria NIHSS ≥ 8 before 
treatment and treated with thrombolysis ( n = 710). Univariate sensitivity 
analyses explored robustness of results. A life-time perspective and 3% discount 
rate were applied. Results Thrombectomy increases the health care cost per 
patient (+GBP 9000) mainly because of intervention costs, but the reduced burden 
on the social services (home help services -GBP 13,000; nursing home care -GBP 
26,000) implies overall cost savings. The average patient gain was 1.0 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with higher gains for younger age groups. 
Thrombectomy was a dominant strategy in the base case and all sensitivity 
analyses where social services were considered. Conclusion Thrombectomy has a 
small effect on hospital costs except for the direct intervention cost. However, 
thrombectomy is highly likely to lead to substantial cost savings in the social 
service sector, up to four times the increase in health-care costs.

The time evolution of both dynamic and static structure factors of a charged 
colloidal clay, Laponite, dispersed in both H2O and D2O solvents has been 
investigated through multiangle dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small-angle 
X-ray scattering (SAXS) as a function of weight concentration. The aging 
phenomenology and the formation of arrested states, both gel and glass, are 
preserved in D2O, while the dynamics is slowed down with respect to water. These 
findings are important to understand the role played by the solvent in the 
interparticle interactions and for techniques such as neutron scattering and 
nuclear magnetic resonance that allow for the extension of the accessible 
scattering vectors and time scales.

The unintended impacts of industrial activity on human health and the 
environment have regularly been assessed and monetised (referred to as "external 
costs"). External costs are, however, a rather abstract aggregate so that 
decision makers cannot easily relate them to tangible impacts. At the same time, 
physical health impact indicators have different units that cannot readily be 
compared and communicated in a joint way. To support better informed decisions 
at policy or company level, we propose and demonstrate a way to facilitate 
communication on non-monetized, that is, physical health indicators quantified 
in studies. The concept Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) is chosen as metric 
due to its widespread use. We establish a comprehensive and consistent set of 
six health endpoints caused by particles and ozone, and derive related 
up-to-date DALYs. Further we apply the DALY values to a French smart grid 
demonstration project. Owing to its size, the gains in terms of reduced DALYs 
are however small. In contrast to external cost assessments, in the frame of 
which morbidity endpoints usually contribute to around 10-15%, they are found to 
be insubstantial in the overall DALY score (i.e. below 1%). This is because 
DALYs only consider time losses weighted by severity while external costs also 
factor in further welfare effects, i.e. combining resource, disutility and 
opportunity costs of illness. As a result, methodological limitations, mainly 
existing for the morbidity-related DALY values, appear to be less of concern. 
Overall, using the DALYs with and without morbidity impacts is justifiable. 
Either choice in the communication of health-related physical externalities 
induces the need to explain the limitations in terms of the treatment of 
morbidity endpoints (notably their definition and the disability weights used) 
or their complete disregard.

PURPOSE: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's provisions for 
first-dollar coverage of evidence-based preventive services have reduced an 
important barrier to receipt of preventive care. Safety-net providers, however, 
still serve a substantial uninsured population, and clinician and patient time 
remain limited in all primary care settings. As a consequence, decision makers 
continue to set priorities to help focus their efforts. This report updates 
estimates of relative health impact and cost-effectiveness for evidence-based 
preventive services.
METHODS: We assessed the potential impact of 28 evidence-based clinical 
preventive services in terms of their cost-effectiveness and clinically 
preventable burden, as measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved. 
Each service received 1 to 5 points on each of the 2 measures-cost-effectiveness 
and clinically preventable burden-for a total score ranging from 2 to 10. New 
microsimulation models were used to provide updated estimates of 12 of these 
services. Priorities for improving delivery rates were established by comparing 
the ranking with what is known of current delivery rates nationally.
RESULTS: The 3 highest-ranking services, each with a total score of 10, are 
immunizing children, counseling to prevent tobacco initiation among youth, and 
tobacco-use screening and brief intervention to encourage cessation among 
adults. Greatest population health improvement could be obtained from increasing 
utilization of clinical preventive services that address tobacco use, 
obesity-related behaviors, and alcohol misuse, as well as colorectal cancer 
screening and influenza vaccinations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies high-priority preventive services and should 
help decision makers select which services to emphasize in quality-improvement 
initiatives.

PURPOSE: Our aim was to update estimates of the health and economic impact of 
clinical services recommended for the primary prevention of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) for the comparative rankings of the National Commission on 
Prevention Priorities, and to explore differences in outcomes by sex and 
race/ethnicity.
METHODS: We used a single, integrated, microsimulation model to generate 
comparable results for 3 services recommended by the US Preventive Services Task 
Force: aspirin counseling for the primary prevention of CVD and colorectal 
cancer, screening and treatment for lipid disorders (usually high cholesterol), 
and screening and treatment for hypertension. Analyses compare lifetime outcomes 
from the societal perspective for a US-representative birth cohort of 100,000 
persons with and without access to each clinical preventive service. Primary 
outcomes are health impact, measured by the net difference in lifetime 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness, measured in 
incremental cost per QALY or cost savings per person in 2012 dollars. Results 
are also presented for population subgroups defined by sex and race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: Health impact is highest for hypertension screening and treatment 
(15,600 QALYs), but is closely followed by cholesterol screening and treatment 
(14,300 QALYs). Aspirin counseling has a lower health impact (2,200 QALYs) but 
is found to be cost saving ($31 saved per person). Cost-effectiveness for 
cholesterol and hypertension screening and treatment is $33,800 per QALY and 
$48,500 per QALY, respectively. Findings favor hypertension over cholesterol 
screening and treatment for women, and opportunities to reduce disease burden 
across all services are greatest for the non-Hispanic black population.
CONCLUSIONS: All 3 CVD preventive services continue to rank highly among other 
recommended preventive services for US adults, but individual priorities can be 
tailored in practice by taking a patient's demographic characteristics and 
clinical objectives into account.

PURPOSE: To help clinicians and care systems determine the priority for tobacco 
counseling in busy clinic schedules, we assessed the lifetime health and 
economic value of annually counseling youth to discourage smoking initiation and 
of annually counseling adults to encourage cessation.
METHODS: We conducted a microsimulation analysis to estimate the health impact 
and cost effectiveness of both types of tobacco counseling in a US birth cohort 
of 4,000,000. The model used for the analysis was constructed from nationally 
representative data sets and structured literature reviews.
RESULTS: Compared with no tobacco counseling, the model predicts that annual 
counseling for youth would reduce the average prevalence of smoking cigarettes 
during adult years by 2.0 percentage points, whereas annual counseling for 
adults will reduce prevalence by 3.8 percentage points. Youth counseling would 
prevent 42,686 smoking-attributable fatalities and increase quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) by 756,601 over the lifetime of the cohort. Adult counseling 
would prevent 69,901 smoking-attributable fatalities and increase QALYs by 
1,044,392. Youth and adult counseling would yield net savings of $225 and $580 
per person, respectively. If annual tobacco counseling was provided to the 
cohort during both youth and adult years, then adult smoking prevalence would be 
5.5 percentage points lower compared with no counseling, and there would be 
105,917 fewer smoking-attributable fatalities over their lifetimes. Only 
one-third of the potential health and economic benefits of counseling are being 
realized at current counseling rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Brief tobacco counseling provides substantial health benefits while 
producing cost savings. Both youth and adult intervention are high-priority uses 
of limited clinician time.

INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common solid neoplasm and the 
second leading cause of cancer death in men. After the Partin tables were 
developed, a number of predictive and prognostic tools became available for risk 
stratification. These tools have allowed the urologist to better characterize 
this disease and lead to more confident treatment decisions for patients. The 
purpose of this study is to critically review the decision-making tools 
currently available to the urologist, from the moment when PCa is first 
diagnosed until patients experience metastatic progression and death.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic and critical analysis through Medline, 
EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science databases was carried out in February 2016 as 
per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) statement. The search was conducted using the following key words: 
"prostate cancer," "prediction tools," "nomograms."
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Seventy-two studies were identified in the literature 
search. We summarized the results into six sections: Tools for prediction of 
life expectancy (before treatment), Tools for prediction of pathological stage 
(before treatment), Tools for prediction of survival and cancer-specific 
mortality (before/after treatment), Tools for prediction of biochemical 
recurrence (before/after treatment), Tools for prediction of metastatic 
progression (after treatment) and in the last section biomarkers and genomics.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of PCa patients requires a tailored approach to 
deliver a truly personalized treatment. The currently available tools are of 
great help in helping the urologist in the decision-making process. These tests 
perform very well in high-grade and low-grade disease, while for 
intermediate-grade disease further research is needed. Newly discovered markers, 
genomic tests, and advances in imaging acquisition through mpMRI will help in 
instilling confidence that the appropriate treatments are being offered to 
patients with prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND: The majority of a child's language development occurs in the first 
5 years of life when brain development is most rapid. There are significant 
long-term benefits to supporting all children's language and literacy 
development such as maximizing their developmental potential (i.e., cognitive, 
linguistic, social-emotional), when children are experiencing a critical period 
of development (i.e., early childhood to 9 years of age). A variety of people 
play a significant role in supporting children's language development, including 
parents, guardians, family members, educators, and/or speech-language 
pathologists. Speech-language pathologists and educators are the professionals 
who predominantly support children's language development in order for them to 
become effective communicators and lay the foundation for later developing 
literacy skills (i.e., reading and writing skills). Therefore, these 
professionals need formal and informal assessments that provide them information 
on a child's understanding and/or use of the increasingly complex aspects of 
language in order to identify and support the receptive and expressive language 
learning needs of diverse children during their early learning experiences 
(i.e., aged 1.5 to 9 years). However, evidence on what methods and tools are 
being used is lacking.
METHODS: The authors will carry out a scoping review of the literature to 
identify studies and map the receptive and expressive English language 
assessment methods and tools that have been published and used since 1980. 
Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) six-stage approach to conducting a scoping review 
was drawn upon to design the protocol for this investigation: (1) identifying 
the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) study selection; 
(4) charting the data; (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results; 
and (6) consultation.
DISCUSSION: This information will help these professionals identify and select 
appropriate assessment methods or tools that can be used to support development 
and/or identify areas of delay or difficulty and plan, implement, and monitor 
the progress of interventions supporting the development of receptive and 
expressive language skills in individuals with diverse language needs (e.g., 
typically developing children, children with language delays and disorders, 
children learning English as a second or additional language, Indigenous 
children who may be speaking dialects of English). Researchers plan to evaluate 
the effectiveness of the assessment methods or tools identified in the scoping 
review as an extension of this study.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm resulting from 
the t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation. It is characterized by the presence of the 
BCR-ABL1 fusion gene encoding the BCR-ABL oncoprotein characterized by a 
deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. Targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, or ponatinib 
have profoundly changed the natural history of the disease with a major impact 
on survival. Indeed, most patients diagnosed today can enjoy a near normal life 
expectancy. The efficacy of TKI treatment can be accurately evaluated by a 
molecular monitoring based on the quantification of BCR-ABL1 mRNA transcripts 
and the detection of resistance mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain. 
International recommendations for an optimal management of CML using biological 
parameters are regularly published. They were designed to evaluate the response 
to the treatment and to consider, if necessary, a switch to another TKI. A 
sustained and deep molecular response is obtained in a significant percentage of 
patients. Clinical trials of TKI discontinuation were performed in such a 
population, and half of patients do not relapse. In the remaining patients, a 
rapid appearance of the malignant clone was observed, undoubtedly the 
consequence of the persistence of residual leukemic stem cells (LSCs). How to 
discriminate patients who may safely stop TKI? How to target residual LSCs, and 
do we have to eradicate all these cells? Additional research investigation and 
clinical trials are needed to answer these questions in order to consider a 
potential cure of CML.

OBJECTIVE: To compared the efficacy of drug-coated balloon and common balloon 
for treatment of superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery occlusive 
disease.
METHODS: Forty-six patients were admitted for ipsilateral single or multiple 
superficial femoral artery and/or popliteal artery lesions (between 3 and 15 cm 
stenosis or occlusion), Rutherford grades 2 to 5, with or without other 
accompanying diseases in the Department of Interventional Vascular Therapy of 
the First Hospital of Nanjing between September, 2015 and December, 2016. The 
patients were randomly assigned into drug-coated balloon (DCB) group (n=23) and 
common balloon (CB) group (n=23). None of the patients had stent restenosis, 
aneurysms, acute thrombosis, pregnancy, life expectancy less than 1 year, or 
below-the-knee artery occlusion. The late lumen loss (LLL), improvement of the 
ankle brachial index (ABI), improvement of Rutherford grade, incidence of 
restenosis, thrombosis rate and amputation rate were compared between the two 
groups at 6 months after treatment.
RESULTS: The two groups of patients were comparable for general conditions, risk 
factors, and characteristics of the compromised vessels (P>0.05). Six months 
after treatment, the patients in DCB group showed significantly smaller LLL, 
more obvious improvement of the ABI and Rutherford grade, and lower restenosis 
rate and thrombosis rate than those in CB group (P<0.05). The amputation rates 
were similar between the two groups (P>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: DCB shows obvious advantages over common balloon for treatment of 
superficial artery and popliteal artery arteriosclerosis obliterans in that it 
more effectively reduces LLL, restenosis rate and thrombosis rate and improves 
the ABI and Rutherford grade at 6 months after the treatment.

Coarctation of the aorta (CoA ) is a well-known congenital heart disease (CHD) , 
which is often associated with several other cardiac and vascular anomalies, 
such as bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), ventricular septal defect, patent ductus 
arteriosus and aortic arch hypoplasia. Despite echocardiographic screening, 
prenatal diagnosis of C o A remains difficult. Most patients with CoA present in 
infancy with absent, delayed or reduced femoral pulses, a supine arm-leg blood 
pressure gradient (> 20 mm Hg), or a murmur due to rapid blood flow across the 
CoA or associated lesions (BAV). Transthoracic echocardiography is the primary 
imaging modality for suspected CoA. However, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 
is the preferred advanced imaging modality for non-invasive diagnosis and 
follow-up of CoA. Adequate and timely diagnosis of CoA is crucial for good 
prognosis, as early treatment is associated with lower risks of long-term 
morbidity and mortality. Numerous surgical and transcatheter treatment 
strategies have been reported for CoA. Surgical resection is the treatment of 
choice in neonates, infants and young children. In older children (> 25 kg) and 
adults, transcatheter treatment is the treatment of choice. In the current era, 
patients with CoA continue to have a reduced life expectancy and an increased 
risk of cardiovascular sequelae later in life, despite adequate relief of the 
aortic stenosis. Intensive and adequate follow-up of the left ventricular 
function, valvular function, blood pressure and the anatomy of the heart and the 
aorta are , therefore, critical in the management of CoA. This review provides 
an overview of the current state-of-the-art clinical diagnosis, diagnostic 
imaging algori thms, treatment and follow-up of patients with CoA.

[Pharmacoeconomic aspects of macitentan in the therapy of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension].

[Article in Russian; Abstract available in Russian from the publisher]

AIM: To provide a pharmacoeconomic estimate of macitentan versus bosentan in 
therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
SUBJECT AND METHODS: An analysis was carried out on the basis of a social 
perspective for patients, whose mean age was 50 years. A budget impact analysis 
was performed without discounting; with the time horizon of the study being 5 
years. Assessing the cost- effectiveness of endothelin receptor antagonists used 
a Markov model based on the meta-analysis of clinical trials. The cost of 
bosentan was calculated from the 2016 registered prices with VAT. That of 
macitentan was estimated from the expected price of 170,000 rubles per 10-mg 
dose pack #28 if the drug is included in the List of Essential Medicines with 
VAT. The cost of sildenafil and iloprost was consistent with the 
January-to-November 2016 auctio.
RESULTS: At cost-effectiveness assessment costs and outcomes were both 
discounted at an annual rate of 3,5%.
RESULTS: After 5 years of therapy with macitentan in patients with baseline 
Functional Class (FC) II PAH, the proportion of patients with FC I-II was shown 
to be 2.6% more than that during therapy with bosentan (20.1 and 17.5%, 
respectively), and that of the died patients was 1.5% lower (69.5 and 71%, 
respectively). In baseline FC III PAH following 5 years, the proportion of 
patients with FC III PAH on initial macitentan treatment was 1% more than that 
on bosentan therapy (8.1 and 7.1%, respectively), and that of the died patients 
was 0.5% lower (87.2, and 87.7%, respectively). The cost-effectiveness analysis 
shows that therapy with macitentan versus bosentan not only causes some increase 
in life expectancy in terms of quality of life (by 0.414 and 0.230 QALYs in FC 
II and III PAH, respectively), but also results in a small cost decrease in FC 
II and III PAH (by 11,000 and 16,000 rubles per patient, respectively). Thus, 
macitentan is a dominant alternative versus bosentan. The budget impact analysis 
indicates that when bosentan is replaced with macitentan, the reduction in 
health care costs in the Russian Federation will amount to 1.9 million rubles 
over 5 years, and in all budgetary costs will be 14.7 million rubles.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with macitentan in patients with FC II-III PAH is more 
cost-effective than that with bosentan and does not require an increase in 
budget costs.

Publisher: Цель исследования. Фармакоэкономическая оценка применения мацитентана 
по сравнению с бозентаном при терапии легочной артериальной гипертонии (ЛАГ). 
Материал и методы. Анализ проводили с учетом социальной перспективы для 
пациентов, средний возраст которых составил 50 лет. Анализ влияния на бюджет 
проводили без дисконтирования 5 лет. При оценке эффективности затрат на 
антагонисты рецепторов эндотелина использовали марковскую модель на основе 
метаанализа клинических исследований. Временно`й горизонт исследования 5 лет. 
Затраты на бозентан рассчитывали на основе зарегистрированной цены на 2016 г. с 
учетом НДС. Затраты на мацитентан рассчитывали на основе предполагаемой цены 
регистрации 170 тыс. рублей за упаковку 10 мг №28 в случае включения препарата в 
Перечень ЖНВЛП с учетом НДС. Затраты на силденафил и илопрост соответствовали 
результатам аукционов за январь — ноябрь 2016 г. При оценке эффективности затрат 
продолжительность жизни и затраты дисконтировали на 3,5% в год. Результаты. 
Показано, что по результатам моделирования по истечении 5 лет терапии 
мацитентаном пациентов с исходной ЛАГ II функционального класса (ФК) доля 
пациентов с I—II ФК будет на 2,6% больше, чем при терапии бозентаном (20,1 и 
17,5% соответственно), а доля умерших пациентов — меньше на 1,5% (69,5 и 71% 
соответственно). При исходной ЛАГ III ФК через 5 лет доля пациентов с ЛАГ III ФК 
при начальной терапии мацитентаном будет на 1% больше, чем при терапии 
бозентаном (8,1 и 7,1% соответственно), а доля умерших пациентов ниже на 0,5% 
(87,2 и 87,7% соответственно). Анализ эффективности затрат показал, что терапия 
мацитентаном по сравнению с бозентаном не только приводит к некоторому 
увеличению средней продолжительности жизни с учетом качества (на 0,414 и 0,230 
QALY при ЛАГ II и III ФК соответственно), но и влечет за собой небольшое 
снижение объема затрат при ЛАГ и II, и III ФК (на 11 и 16 тыс. руб./пациента 
соответственно). Таким образом, мацитентан является доминирующей альтернативой 
по сравнению с бозентаном. Анализ влияния на бюджет показывает, что при замене 
бозентана мацитентаном снижение затрат системы здравоохранения Российской 
Федерации составит за 5 лет 1,9 млн руб., а всех бюджетных издержек — 14,7 млн 
руб. Заключение. Лечение мацитентаном пациентов с ЛАГ II—III ФК является 
экономически более эффективным по сравнению с бозентаном и не требует при этом 
увеличения бюджетных затрат.

Health Sciences, Kaunas, Lithuania.

BACKGROUND: High mortality rates from smoking related diseases are a significant 
public health issue in Lithuania. Study aims to estimate the number of smoking 
attributable deaths (SADs) and years of potential life lost in Lithuania in 
2013.
METHODS: Gender, age and disease specific mortality was calculated by applying 
the smoking attributable fractions (SAFs) to prevalence estimates of current and 
former smokers among Lithuanian adults aged ≥35 years that are based on the 2005 
Lithuanian Health Interview Survey. Mortality data were obtained from the 
Institute of Hygiene Health Information Centre. Eight years lag was assumed 
between smoking rates and subsequent mortality. Sensitivity analysis was used to 
calculate SAFs applying smoking impact ratio method.
RESULTS: In 2013, 13.9% of total mortality or 5771 deaths in Lithuania were 
attributable to smoking (5181 men and 590 women). The two leading causes of SADs 
were ischaemic heart disease (2861) and lung cancer (1054) that accounted for 
67.8% of the smoking attributable mortality. In the same year, smoking accounted 
for 39 279 years of potential life lost (34 663 years for men and 4615 years for 
women).
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking causes a considerable mortality burden in Lithuania, 
killing nine times more males than females. Therefore reduction of smoking 
prevalence is an urgent public health need, which calls for implementation of 
effective and comprehensive tobacco control measures consistent with the World 
Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Articles and 
Protocols and The Tobacco Products Directive.

R. China †Cochlear Limited Macquarie University, NSW, Australia.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost utility of cochlear implantation (CI) for 
severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) among children from rural 
settings in P.R. China (China).
RESEARCH DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis (CUA) was undertaken using data 
generated from a single-center substudy of the Cochlear Pediatric Implanted 
Recipient Observational Study (Cochlear P-IROS). The data were projected over a 
20-year time horizon using a decision tree model.
SETTING: The Chinese healthcare payer and patient perspectives were adopted.
INTERVENTION: Unilateral CI of children with a severe-to-profound SNHL compared 
with their preimplantation state of no treatment or amplification with hearing 
aids ("no CI" status).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE/S: Incremental costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) 
gained.
RESULTS: The mean total discounted cost of unilateral CI was CNY 252,506 (37,876 
USD), compared with CNY 29,005 (4,351 USD) for the no CI status from the 
healthcare payer plus patient perspective. A total discounted benefit of 8.9 
QALYs was estimated for CI recipients compared with 6.7 QALYs for the no CI 
status. From the healthcare payer plus patient perspective, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for unilateral CI compared with no CI was CNY 
100,561 (15,084 USD) per QALY. The healthcare payer perspective yielded an ICER 
of CNY 40,929 (6,139 USD) per QALY. Both ICERs fell within one to three times 
China's gross domestic product per capita (GDP, 2011-2015), considered 
"cost-effective" by World Health Organization (WHO) standards.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with unilateral CI is a cost-effective hearing solution 
for children with severe to profound SNHL in rural China. Increased access to 
mainstream education and greater opportunities for employment, are potential 
downstream benefits of CI that may yield further societal and economic benefits. 
CI may be considered favorably for broader inclusion in medical insurance 
schemes across China.

Estimating cost-effectiveness associated with all-oral regimen for chronic 
hepatitis C in China.

Chen H(1), Chen L(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Infectious Diseases Control, Wuxi Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China.

BACKGROUND: All-oral regimens are associated with higher effectiveness and 
shorter treatment duration for chronic hepatitis C. Given its superior effect 
and enormous patients in China, clinicians or patients may be compelled to 
consider delaying treatment for all-oral regimen.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate cost-effectiveness of delaying treatment for all-oral 
regimen in the subsequent years under different assumptions about their price 
and efficacy compared with standard of care in China.
METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime 
costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) and net monetary benefit (NB) were calculated. And sensitivity 
analyses were also performed to assess the impact of uncertainty.
RESULTS: For treatment naive patients with Genotype 1, immediate treatment with 
all-oral regimen under assumed cost and efficacy at present was cost-effective 
compared with peginterferon α-2a (PegIFN) regimen at present with an ICER of 
$12536 per QALY gained and a positive NB of $6832 at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $21209. And it was more than 95% likely to be cost-effective if 
weekly drug cost was less than $1000. Moreover, patients delaying treatment for 
all-oral regimen in the 1st year were associated with increase in QALYs of 0.62 
and increase in cost of $10114 compared with initiating PegIFN regimen at 
present, which resulted in a positive NB of $3115.
CONCLUSION: From a payer perspective, all-oral regimen is associated with good 
long-term health and economic benefit for treatment-naive patients infected with 
HCV genotype 1. Particularly, if all-oral regimen would become available at 
lower price in the future, delaying treatment for all-oral regimen may be a good 
choice for patients in China.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus currently ranks high among indicators used in Global 
Burden of Disease Studies. The current study estimated the burden of disease 
attributable to type 2 diabetes mellitus and its chronic complications in 
Brazil, 2008. We calculated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years of 
life lost (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) stratified by gender, 
age bracket, and major geographic region. Type 2 diabetes mellitus accounted for 
5% of the burden of disease in Brazil, ranking 3rd in women and 6th in men in 
the composition of DALYs. The largest share of DALYs was concentrated in the 
30-59-year age bracket and consisted mainly of YLDs. The highest YLL and YLD 
rates were in the Northeast and South of Brazil, respectively. Chronic 
complications represented 80% of YLDs from type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 
diabetes mellitus ranked as a leading health problem in Brazil in 2008, 
accounting for relevant shares of mortality and morbidity.

CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Diabetic retinopathy is a disease caused by increased 
permeability of retinal vessels. Its incidence and prevalence have been 
increasing due to urbanization, greater life expectancy and the habits of modern 
life. Its onset is insidious and it may lead to blindness in 75% of individuals 
who have been diabetic for more than 20 years. The aim here was to evaluate the 
evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on interventions relating to diabetic 
retinopathy.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Review of systematic reviews, conducted at Cochrane Brazil.
METHODS: We included Cochrane systematic reviews on interventions relating to 
diabetic retinopathy. Two researchers evaluated the inclusion criteria, 
summarized the reviews and presented the results narratively.
RESULTS: Ten reviews met the inclusion criteria. They showed some evidence of 
benefits from: (a) photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy; (b) strict glucose 
and pressure control for postponing the onset of retinopathy; (c) antiangiogenic 
drugs for macular edema (high-quality evidence); (d) anti-vascular endothelial 
growth factor agents for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (very low to 
low-quality evidence); and (e) intravitreal injection or surgical implantation 
for treating persistent or refractory macular edema. However, blood pressure 
control seems to have no benefit after the onset of retinopathy.
CONCLUSION: Only a few options are likely to be effective for treating diabetic 
retinopathy. These include photocoagulation and anti-vascular endothelial growth 
factor agents. Strict glucose and pressure control seem to postpone the onset of 
retinopathy. For macular edema, antiangiogenic drugs, intravitreal injection and 
surgical implantation seem to have some benefit.

CONTEXTO: A retinopatia diabética é uma doença causada pelo aumento da 
permeabilidade dos vasos da retina. Sua incidência e prevalência vêm aumentando 
devido à urbanização, maior expectativa de vida e hábitos de vida modernos. Seu 
início é insidioso e pode levar à cegueira em 75% dos pacientes diabéticos com 
mais de 20 anos de doença. O objetivo foi avaliar a evidência das revisões 
sistemáticas Cochrane sobre intervenções para retinopatia diabética.
TIPO DE ESTUDO E LOCAL: Revisão de revisões sistemáticas conduzida no Centro 
Cochrane do Brasil.
MÉTODOS: Nós incluímos revisões sistemáticas Cochrane sobre intervenções para 
retinopatia diabética. Dois pesquisadores avaliaram os critérios de inclusão, 
resumiram as revisões e apresentaram os resultados narrativamente.
RESULTADOS: Dez revisões preencheram os critérios de inclusão e mostraram 
benefícios com: (a) fotocoagulação para retinopatia diabética; (b) controle 
rigoroso da glicose e da pressão para adiar o início da retinopatia; (c) 
fármacos antiangiogênicos para edema macular (evidência de alta qualidade); (d) 
agentes antifator de crescimento do endotélio vascular para retinopatia 
diabética proliferativa (evidência de qualidade muito baixa a baixa); (e) 
injeção intravítrea ou implante cirúrgico para o tratamento do edema macular 
persistente ou refratário. No entanto, o controle da pressão arterial parece não 
ter benefício após o início da retinopatia.
CONCLUSÃO: Existem poucas opções provavelmente efetivas para o tratamento da 
retinopatia diabética. Estas incluem fotocoagulação e agentes antifator de 
crescimento do endotélio vascular. O controle rigoroso da glicose e da pressão 
parecem adiar o início da retinopatia. Para o edema macular, fármacos 
antiangiogênicos, injeção intravítrea e implante cirúrgico parecem ter algum 
benefício.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-utility of microscopic observation 
drug-susceptibility assay (MODS) and Xpert® MTB/RIF implementation for 
tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis in rural northern Mozambique.
METHODS: Stochastic transmission compartmental TB model from the healthcare 
provider perspective with parameter input from direct measurements, systematic 
literature reviews and expert opinion. MODS and Xpert® MTB/RIF were evaluated as 
replacement test of smear microscopy (SM) or as an add-on test after a negative 
SM. Costs were calculated in 2013 USD, effects in disability-adjusted life years 
(DALY). Willingness to pay threshold (WPT) was established at once the per 
capita Gross National Income of Mozambique.
RESULTS: MODS as an add-on test to negative SM produced an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 5647.89USD/DALY averted. MODS as a substitute 
for SM yielded an ICER of 5374.58USD/DALY averted. Xpert® MTB/RIF as an add-on 
test to negative SM yielded ICER of 345.71USD/DALY averted. Xpert® MTB/RIF as a 
substitute for SM obtained an ICER of 122.13USD/DALY averted. TB prevalence and 
risk of infection were the main factors impacting MODS and Xpert® MTB/RIF ICER 
in the one-way sensitivity analysis. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 
Xpert® MTB/RIF was most likely to have an ICER below the WPT, whereas MODS was 
not.
CONCLUSION: Our cost-utility analysis favours the implementation of Xpert® 
MTB/RIF as a replacement of SM for all TB suspects in this rural high TB/HIV 
prevalence African setting.

Exercise capacity is one of the most powerful predicting factors of life 
expectancy, both in patients with and those without cardiac disease. 
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing provides a global assessment of the integrative
