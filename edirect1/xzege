BACKGROUND: In 1991, Halpern and Coren claimed that left-handed people die nine 
years younger than right-handed people. Most subsequent studies did not find 
support for the difference in age of death or its magnitude, primarily because 
of the realization that there have been historical changes in reported rates of 
left-handedness.
METHODS: We created a model that allowed us to determine whether the historical 
change in left-handedness explains the original finding of a nine-year 
difference in life expectancy. We calculated all deaths in the United States by 
birth year, gender, and handedness for 1989 (the Halpern and Coren study was 
based on data from that year) and contrasted those findings with the modeled age 
of death by reported and counterfactual estimated handedness for each birth 
year, 1900-1989.
RESULTS: In 1989, 2,019,512 individuals died, of which 6.4% were reportedly 
left-handed based on concurrent annual handedness reporting. However, it is 
widely believed that cultural pressures may have caused an underestimation of 
the true rate of left-handedness. Using a simulation that assumed no age of 
death difference between left-handed and right-handed individuals in this cohort 
and adjusting for the reported rates of left-handedness, we found that 
left-handed individuals were expected to die 9.3 years earlier than their 
right-handed counterparts due to changes in the rate of left-handedness over 
time. This difference of 9.3 years was not found to be statistically significant 
compared to the 8.97 years reported by Halpern and Coren. When we assumed no 
change in the rate of left-handedness over time, the survival advantage for 
right-handed individuals was reduced to 0.02 years, solely driven by not 
controlling for gender. When we considered the estimated age of death for each 
birth cohort, we found a mean difference of 0.43 years between left-handed and 
right-handed individuals, also driven by handedness difference by gender.
CONCLUSION: We found that the changing rate of left-handedness reporting over 
the years entirely explains the originally reported observation of nine-year 
difference in life expectancy. In epidemiology, new information on past 
reporting biases could warrant re-exploration of initial findings. The 
simulation modeling approach that we use here might facilitate such analyses.

AIMS: For better understanding of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mortality 
in different countries, we studied the excess mortality from any cause during 
2020 and 2021 in 22 European countries, and its relationship with three 
socioeconomic variables: life expectancy at birth in 2019, per capita income, 
and low education level.
METHODS: Using an ecological design, we analyzed excess mortality data between 
January 2020 and December 2021 in 22 European countries, obtained from the 
EuroMOMO surveillance system. Using weekly Z-score data for each country, we 
estimated the annual average deviation in mortality during 2020 and 2021 for 
each country. We analyzed possible relationships between the excess mortality 
and three independent variables: gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) in 
2020, life expectancy at birth in 2019, and proportion of the population over 
age 18 years with a lower than secondary education level in 2018.
RESULTS: In the 22 European countries analyzed, the total number of excess 
deaths in 2020 and 2021 was 800,011 (11%) more than expected, with deaths among 
those aged 65 years and over accounting for 87.66% of these. Excess mortality 
was higher in 2020, especially in Spain, UK, Italy, and France. In 2021, excess 
mortality was highest in Hungary, the Netherlands, France, and Germany. Excess 
mortality during 2021 was inversely correlated with life expectancy (r =-.489, p 
= .021) and income level (r =-.550, p = .008).
CONCLUSION: Reducing socioeconomic inequalities among countries not only 
improves conditions of most disadvantages but also will help to reduce excess of 
mortality from future pandemics.

Since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, health 
services for breast cancer (BC) have been disrupted. Our scoping review examines 
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on BC services, health outcomes, and 
well-being for women. Additionally, this review identifies social inequalities 
specific to BC during the pandemic. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews guidelines, 
the literature search was conducted using scientific databases starting from 
March 2020 through November 2021. Studies were identified and selected by two 
researchers based on inclusion criteria, and the relevant data were extracted 
and charted to summarize the findings. Ninety-three articles were included in 
this review. Main themes included are as follows: (i) the impact of COVID-19 on 
BC services; (ii) the impact of COVID-19 on health outcomes and well-being in 
women with BC; and (iii) any variation in the impact of COVID-19 on BC by social 
determinants of health. There were apparent disruptions to BC services across 
the cancer continuum, especially screening services. Clinical repercussions were 
a result of such disruptions, and women with BC experienced worsened quality of 
life and psychosocial well-being. Finally, there were social inequalities 
dependent on social determinants of health such as age, race, insurance status, 
and region. Due to the disruption of BC services during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
women were impacted on their health and overall well-being. The variation in 
impact demonstrates how health inequities have been exacerbated during the 
pandemic. This comprehensive review will inform timely health-care changes to 
minimize long-term impacts of the pandemic and improve evidence-based 
multidisciplinary needs.

BACKGROUND: Kidney failure reduces life expectancy by one-third compared with 
the general population, and cardiovascular complications and poor 
cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are the main causes. We aimed to evaluate the 
association between severely low CRF and all-cause mortality risk in HD 
patients.
METHODS: This observational prospective cohort study followed-up patients 
receiving HD from August 2015 until March 2022. Cardiorespiratory fitness was 
evaluated through the cardiopulmonary exercise test, and the peak oxygen uptake 
(VO2peak) value was used to determine severely low CRF (< 15 mL∙kg-1∙min-1). Cox 
regression and univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to evaluate the 
association of severely low CRF with mortality risk and survival rate.
RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were followed-up for a median of 33.0 [14.3 - 
49.3] months. A total of 26 patients had severely low CRF. During the follow-up 
period, 11 patients (22.92%) died from all causes. From these, eight (30.8%) had 
severely low CRF. Even so, severely low CRF was not associated with crude death 
rates for patients stratified by CRF levels (p = 0.189), neither in unadjusted 
(HR 2.18; CI 95% 0.58-8.23) nor in adjusted (HR 1.32; CI 95% 0.31-5.59) Cox 
proportional hazard models. As a continuous variable, VO2peak was not associated 
with mortality risk (HR 1.01; CI 95% 0.84-1.21). Univariate Kaplan-Meier 
analysis showed that patients with severely low CRF did not have significantly 
worse survival rates than those with mild-moderate CRF (p = 0.186).
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that severely low CRF was not associated with 
all-cause mortality in patients on HD. Despite severely low CRF being prevalent, 
larger cohort studies are needed to establish strong conclusions on its 
association with all-cause mortality.

Immune dysfunction and infection - interaction between CLL and treatment A 
reflection on current treatment paradigms and unmet needs.

Gargiulo E, Teglgaard RS, Faitová T, Niemann CU.

Background Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a hematological malignancy 
characterized by immune dysfunction, which significantly contributes to 
increased morbidity and mortality due to infections. Summary Advancement in 
therapeutic strategies based on combination chemoimmunotherapy and targeted 
treatment have increased life expectancy for patients affected by CLL. However, 
mortality and morbidity due to infection showed no improvement over the last 
decades. Although therapy options are highly efficient in targeting leukemic 
cells, several studies highlighted the interactions of different treatments with 
the tumor microenvironment immune components, significantly impacting their 
clinical efficacy and fostering increased risk of infections. Key messages Given 
the profound immune dysfunction caused by CLL itself, treatment can thus 
represent a double-edged sword. Thus, it is essential to increase our 
understanding and awareness on how conventional therapies affect the 
disease-microenvironment-infection axis to ensure the best personalized strategy 
for each patient. This requires careful consideration of the advantages and 
disadvantages of efficient treatments, whether chemoimmunotherapy or targeted 
combinations, leading to risk of infectious complications. To this regard, our 
machine learning based algorithm CLL-TIM, currently implemented into the local 
electronic health record system for Eastern Denmark, aims at early 
identification of patients at high risk of serious infections (PreVent-ACaLL; 
NCT03868722). We here review strategies for management of immune dysfunction and 
infections in CLL.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated the efficacy and safety of silkworm pupae extract 
(SWP) consumption for 12 weeks on muscle mass and strength in middle-aged and 
older individuals with relatively low skeletal muscle mass who do regular 
low-intensity exercise.
DESIGN: A randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial.
PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted with 54 participants with relatively low 
skeletal muscle mass (SMM) (64.4 ± 6.1 years; body mass index, 23.8 ± 2.4 
kg/m2).
INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Participants were randomly assigned to one of two 
groups: 1000 mg of SWP/day plus regular exercise (SWP group, n=27) or placebo 
plus regular exercise (placebo group, n=27). All participants were required to 
engage in 30-60 minutes/day of walking for ≥3 days/week for 12 weeks. The 
primary outcome was knee extension/flexion strength (Nm), measured at the 
velocity of 60°/s. Secondary outcomes included body composition, biomarkers 
(creatine kinase and creatinine), handgrip strength, and quality of life 
questionnaire.
RESULTS: Both the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses 
revealed no significant impact of SWP on knee strength compared to the placebo 
group over 12 weeks. On the other hand, the SWP group had significantly greater 
increases in right-handgrip strength by 1.94 kg (95% CI: 0.08-3.79; p = 0.041) 
and left-handgrip strength by 1.83 kg (0.25-3.41; p = 0.024) compared to the 
placebo group in the ITT population, after 12 weeks. Moreover, in the PP 
population, the SWP group revealed an even greater increase in right-handgrip 
strength by 2.07 kg (0.15-3. 98; p = 0.035) and left-handgrip strength by 2.21 
kg (0.60-3.83; p = 0.008) for the 12-week period. However, this study resulted 
in a failure to detect significant differences in the body composition, 
biomarkers, quality of life questionnaire, physical activity, and caloric intake 
between the groups. None of the participants in the SWP group experienced any 
significant adverse events. In the placebo group, two participants experienced 
urticaria and allergic side effects, leading to their withdrawal from the study 
and two exhibited elevated levels of liver enzyme and increased diastolic blood 
pressure, respectively at 12 weeks.
CONCLUSION: SWP, in addition to low-intensity exercise, may enhance handgrip 
strengths in middle-aged and older adults with relatively lower SMM. Future 
studies need to use a large sample size over longer periods to validate our 
findings. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04994054.

Erratum in
    Clin Transl Oncol. 2023 Nov 29;:

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common tumours worldwide, and 70% of 
CRC patients are over 65 years of age. However, the scientific evidence 
available for these patients is poor, as they are underrepresented in clinical 
trials. Therefore, a group of experts from the Oncogeriatrics Section of the 
Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM), the Spanish Cooperative Group for 
the Treatment of Digestive Tumours, (TTD) and the Multidisciplinary Spanish 
Group of Digestive Cancer (GEMCAD) have reviewed the scientific evidence 
available in older patients with CRC. This group of experts recommends a 
multidisciplinary approach and geriatric assessment (GA) before making a 
therapeutic decision because GA predicts the risk of toxicity and survival and 
helps to individualize treatment. In addition, elderly patients with localized 
CRC should undergo standard cancer resection, preferably laparoscopically. The 
indication for adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) should be considered based on the 
potential benefit, the risk of recurrence, the life expectancy and patient 
comorbidities. When the disease is metastatic, the possibility of radical 
treatment with surgery, radiofrequency (RF) or stereotactic body radiation 
therapy (SBRT) should be considered. The efficacy of palliative CT is similar to 
that seen in younger patients, but elderly patients are at increased risk of 
toxicity. Clinical trials should be conducted with the elderly population and 
include GAs and specific treatment plans.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy for patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer 
(BC) has improved in recent years, especially due to better systemic treatment. 
This has led to an increased incidence of brain metastases (BM), and BC is now 
the leading cause of BM in women. Treatment of BM primarily consists of surgery 
and/or radiotherapy. We aimed to investigate survival time and prognostic 
factors for BC patients treated with radiotherapy for BM.
MATERIAL & METHODS: During the period 1st of January 2015 to 1st of June 2020, 
144 consecutive BC patients treated for BM from one centre were retrospectively 
analyzed. The patients were either diagnosed with BM as the first metastatic 
lesion, or developed BM during palliative therapy for distant non-brain 
metastasis. The study was approved by the Central Denmark Region.
RESULTS: Median age at BM diagnosis was 66 years, and 90% of the patients 
already had extracranial metastatic disease at BM diagnosis. Median overall 
survival after diagnosis of BM was 6.1 months. Short survival was observed for 
patients with poor performance status, leptomeningeal metastasis or more than 
three solid BM. Several of these factors were overrepresented in patients with 
estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumours who had poorer survival than patients 
with different receptor status.
CONCLUSION: The number of metastatic BC patients developing BM is high, and 
survival following local treatment remains poor. Several prognostic factors 
appear to influence survival after radiotherapy. Treatment of BC patients with 
BM should be individualized according to performance status, leptomeningeal 
disease, number of BM, and receptor status of the disease.

Knee rotationplasty (KRP) is a function-preserving surgery that serves as an 
alternative to above-knee amputation in patients diagnosed with malignant bone 
and soft tissue tumors around the knee joint. However, the short-term progress 
of the reconstructed knee in terms of muscle strength is unclear after KRP. This 
case report describes the progress of a 37-year-old man diagnosed with synovial 
sarcoma in the distal femur, 1 year after undergoing KRP. Changes in muscle 
strength of the reconstructed knee and physical function are reported. Physical 
therapy was started on postoperative day 1 after the KRP, and mobilization 
proceeded step-by-step with sitting, wheelchair transfer, and crutch walking. 
Active and passive range-of-motion exercises of the reconstructed knee were 
started on postoperative day 5. The isometric reconstructed knee extension 
strength, 10-m walk test, timed up and go test, Musculoskeletal Tumor Society 
score, Toronto Extremity Salvage Score, and quality of life (QOL) were 
evaluated. One month postoperatively, muscle strength had increased, and at 6 
and 12 months postoperatively, isometric knee extension strength and physical 
function had improved. Furthermore, activities of daily living and QOL gradually 
improved over the course of the 12 months. Our case shows the previously unknown 
course of reconstructed knee muscle strength in the early post-KRP period, with 
corresponding improvements in physical function, activities of daily living, and 
QOL.

Spinal Fixed-point Rotating Reduction for Treatment of Facet Joint Disorders.

Zheng J, Duan C, Ma C.

CONTEXT: Facet joint disorder is a series of clinical syndromes that lumbar 
trauma or degenerative disease can cause, and it can result in lumbar pain and 
restricted movement. Despite use of conventional Western and traditional Chinese 
treatments, patients can still experience many clinical symptoms, with no 
effective improvements in lumbar-spine movement or quality of life.
OBJECTIVE: The study intended to investigate the effects of spinal, fixed-point, 
rotating reduction on the pain levels and daily living abilities of patients 
with facet joint disorders.
DESIGN: The research team performed a prospective, randomized controlled study.
SETTING: The study took place at Wuhan Central Hospital, Affiliated to Tongji 
Medical College, at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, 
China.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 88 patients with facet joint disorders who had 
been admitted to the hospital between June 2021 and August 2022.
INTERVENTION: The research team randomly divided participants into two groups, 
with 44 participants in each group, using the numerical table method: (1) the 
intervention group, who received treatment using the spinal, fixed-point, 
rotating reduction method, and (2) the control group, treated who received 
treatment using conventional tui-na, acupuncture, and traction.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team measured changes: (1) in pain, (2) in lumbar 
mobility, (3) in lumbar-spine function, and (4) in daily living abilities.
RESULTS: In the comparisons between the groups at baseline, no significant 
differences existed: (1) in pain levels (P = .656); (2) in forward flexion (P = 
.982), extension (P = .887), lateral flexion (P = .408), or rotation (P = .888); 
(3) in the scores for clinical symptoms (P = .982), subjective symptoms (P = 
.887), or limitations in daily activities (P = .408); or (4) in the scores for 
daily living abilities (P = .427). In the comparisons between the groups at two 
weeks postintervention, the intervention group's: (1) pain levels were 
significantly lower than those of the control group (P < .001); (2) forward 
flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation were significantly higher than 
those of the control group (all P < .001); (3) scores for clinical symptoms, 
subjective symptoms, and limitations in daily activities were significantly 
better than those of the control group (all P < .001); and (4) scores for daily 
living abilities were subjective higher than those of the control group (P < 
.001).
CONCLUSION: Spinal, fixed-point, rotating reduction can significantly relieve 
the pain of patients with facet joint disorders restore their lumbar spine 
mobility, improve their lumbar spine function, increase their ADL abilities, and 
facilitate patients' recovery. Practitioners can promote it in clinical 
practice.

The present paper revisits and extends the examination of the long-run 
relationship between UK life expectancy and income provided by Tapia Granados 
(2012). Adopting a more detailed form of analysis, a clear break corresponding 
to the 1918-1919 Influenza Pandemic is identified in the long span of data 
examined. This finding of structural change, along with detected uncertainty 
regarding the orders of integration of the series examined, results in the 
application of split-sample analysis employing autoregressive distributed lag 
(ARDL) modelling. The results obtained reverse the 'no long-run relationship' 
conclusion of Tapia Granados (2012) with overwhelming evidence presented in 
support of a negative relationship between life expectancy and income. Our 
findings add to both health-income research and a burgeoning literature on the 
reproduction and replication of previously published empirical research.

Using machine learning to study the association of sociodemographic indicators, 
biomarkers, and oral condition in older adults in Colombia.

BACKGROUND: Chronic health conditions and socioeconomic problems that affect the 
well-being and life expectancy of older adults are common. The objective of this 
cross-sectional study was to analyze the association between sociodemographic 
variables, oral conditions, and general health and the biomarkers of older 
adults using machine learning (ML).
METHODS: A total of 15,068 surveys from the national study of Health, Well-Being 
and Aging (Salud, Bienestar y Envejecimiento) data set were used for this 
secondary analysis. Of these, 3,128 people provided blood samples for the 
analysis of blood biomarkers. Sociodemographic, oral health, and general health 
variables were analyzed using ML and logistic regression.
RESULTS: The results of clustering analysis showed that dyslipidemia was 
associated with poor oral condition, lower socioeconomic status, being female, 
and low education. The self-perception of oral health in older adults was not 
associated with the presence of teeth, blood biomarkers, or socioeconomic 
variables. However, the necessity of replacing a dental prosthesis was 
associated with the lowest self-perception of oral health. Edentulism was 
associated with being female, increased age, and smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic and educational disparities, sex, and smoking are 
important factors for tooth loss and suboptimal blood biomarkers in older 
adults. ML is a powerful tool for identifying potential variables that may aid 
in the prevention of systemic and oral diseases in older adults, which would 
improve geriatric dentistry.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: These findings can help the academic community identify 
critical sociodemographic and clinical factors that influence the process of 
healthy aging and serve as a useful guide to enhance health care policies and 
geriatric oral health care services.

Globally, the lifespan of populations increases but the healthspan is lagging 
behind. Previous research showed that survival into extreme ages (longevity) 
clusters in families as illustrated by the increasing lifespan of study 
participants with each additional long-lived family member. Here we investigate 
whether the healthspan in such families follows a similar quantitative pattern 
using three-generational data from two databases, LLS (Netherlands), and SEDD 
(Sweden). We study healthspan in 2143 families containing index persons with 26 
follow-up years and two ancestral generations, comprising 17,539 persons. Our 
results provide strong evidence that an increasing number of long-lived 
ancestors associates with up to a decade of healthspan extension. Further 
evidence indicates that members of long-lived families have a delayed onset of 
medication use, multimorbidity and, in mid-life, healthier metabolomic profiles 
than their partners. We conclude that both lifespan and healthspan are 
quantitatively linked to ancestral longevity, making family data invaluable to 
identify protective mechanisms of multimorbidity.

Schizophrenia substantially contributes to the burden of mental disorders. 
Schizophrenia's burden and epidemiological estimates in some countries have been 
published, but updated estimates of prevalence, incidence, and 
schizophrenia-related disability at the global level are lacking. Here, we 
present the data from and critically discuss the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study data, focusing on temporal changes in 
schizophrenia's prevalence, incidence, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) globally. From 1990 to 2019, schizophrenia raw prevalence (14.2 to 23.6 
million), incidence (941,000 to 1.3 million), and DALYs (9.1 to 15.1 million) 
increased by over 65%, 37%, and 65% respectively, while age-standardized 
estimates remained stable globally. In countries with high socio-demographic 
index (SDI), both prevalence and DALYs increased, while in those with low SDI, 
the age-standardized incidence decreased and DALYs remained stable. The 
male/female ratio of burden of schizophrenia has remained stable in the overall 
population over the past 30 years (i.e., M/F = 1.1), yet decreasing from younger 
to older age groups (raw prevalence in females higher than males after age 65, 
with males having earlier age of onset, and females longer life expectancy). 
Results of this work suggest that schizophrenia's raw prevalence, incidence, and 
burden have been increasing since 1990. Age-adjusted estimates did not reduce. 
Schizophrenia detection in low SDI countries is suboptimal, and its 
prevention/treatment in high SDI countries should be improved, considering its 
increasing prevalence. Schizophrenia sex ratio inverts throughout the lifespan, 
suggesting different age of onset and survival by sex. However, prevalence and 
burden estimates for schizophrenia are probably underestimated. GBD does not 
account for mortality from schizophrenia (and other mental disorders, apart from 
anorexia nervosa).

Heterochronic parabiosis (HPB) is known for its functional rejuvenation effects 
across several mouse tissues. However, its impact on biological age and 
long-term health is unknown. Here we performed extended (3-month) HPB, followed 
by a 2-month detachment period of anastomosed pairs. Old detached mice exhibited 
improved physiological parameters and lived longer than control isochronic mice. 
HPB drastically reduced the epigenetic age of blood and liver based on several 
clock models using two independent platforms. Remarkably, this rejuvenation 
effect persisted even after 2 months of detachment. Transcriptomic and 
epigenomic profiles of anastomosed mice showed an intermediate phenotype between 
old and young, suggesting a global multi-omic rejuvenation effect. In addition, 
old HPB mice showed gene expression changes opposite to aging but akin to 
several life span-extending interventions. Altogether, we reveal that long-term 
HPB results in lasting epigenetic and transcriptome remodeling, culminating in 
the extension of life span and health span.

BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, a total 
lockdown of universities was implemented by the government in Belgium. 
University staff was required to work at home. The purpose of the study was to 
identify factors associated with poor mental health in university staff during 
mandatory home work.
METHODS: Mental well-being of 702 university employees was assessed by need for 
recovery after work and presence of burnout symptoms. Following factors were 
considered: personal factors (gender, age), professional status, specific home 
work environment factors (quiet place to work, taking care of ill or old people, 
number of children < 12yrs. at home, family member at risk for Covid-19), 
work-private life balance and worries about long- and short-term work situation. 
Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the odds 
ratios for the presence a high need for recovery and burnout symptoms.
RESULTS: The presence of a high need for recovery and the presence of burnout 
symptoms were significantly associated with poor work-private life balance (OR 
5.14 and 2.80, respectively), no quiet place to work (OR 3.23 and 2.00, 
respectively) and being worried about long-term work situation (OR's increasing 
with increasing degree of worries). Being able to discuss the worries with the 
supervisor was only significant with a decreased risk of burnout symptoms for 
the lowest level of discussability with the supervisor. Following factors were 
not associated with both mental health outcomes: professional status, being 
worried about short-term work situation, taking care of ill or old people, 
number of children < 12yrs. at home and having a family member at risk for 
Covid-19.
CONCLUSIONS: When working at home special attention should be paid to 
work-private life balance and the presence of a quiet place to work. 
Additionally, in the case of mandatory home work in university personnel, 
specific worries about long-term work situation should be tackled. Universities 
and/or governments should provide measures to ensure an extension of research 
deadlines and, if applicable, job security.

Health impacts of social determinants and lifestyle behaviours: some evidence 
from Canadian provinces.

This study seeks to identify the impact of social determinants and lifestyle 
factors on life expectancy and self-perceived health as two measures of 
objective and subjective health, respectively, using data from Canadian 
provinces during 2007-21. Through a simple conceptual model, it lays out the 
direct and indirect pathways through which social and lifestyle determinants 
affect health. The conceptual model guides the formulation of empirical models, 
which are used to estimate the effects of social and lifestyle factors on 
health. The study uses 'panel-corrected standard errors' estimation method to 
obtain reliable results. The findings confirm that social determinants 
contribute directly and indirectly (through lifestyle) to life expectancy. For 
self-perceived health, however, the contributions of both social and lifestyle 
determinants are only direct. The latter result may be explained by the 
immediacy of lifestyle and its impact on health in individuals' minds, a notion 
that is constantly reinforced by the mainstream discourse on health promotion. 
Our study indicates that lifestyle factors should be addressed within the 
context of broader social determinants. In other words, an individual agency 
should be understood within the larger enveloping social structure. The study 
recognizes redistributive measures aimed at reducing social gradients in health 
as effective health promotion policies.

Greater stress and trauma mediate race-related differences in epigenetic age 
between Black and White young adults in a community sample.

Black Americans suffer lower life expectancy and show signs of accelerated aging 
compared to other Americans. While previous studies observe these differences in 
children and populations with chronic illness, whether these pathologic 
processes exist or how these pathologic processes progress has yet to be 
explored prior to the onset of significant chronic illness, within a young adult 
population. Therefore, we investigated race-related differences in epigenetic 
age in a cross-sectional sample of young putatively healthy adults and assessed 
whether lifetime stress and/or trauma mediate those differences. Biological and 
psychological data were collected from self-reported healthy adult volunteers 
within the local New Haven area (399 volunteers, 19.8% Black, mean age: 29.28). 
Stress and trauma data was collected using the Cumulative Adversity Inventory 
(CAI) interview, which assessed specific types of stressors, including major 
life events, traumatic events, work, financial, relationship and chronic 
stressors cumulatively over time. GrimAge Acceleration (GAA), determined from 
whole blood collected from participants, measured epigenetic age. In order to 
understand the impact of stress and trauma on GAA, exploratory mediation 
analyses were then used. We found cumulative stressors across all types of 
events (mean difference of 6.9 p = 2.14e-4) and GAA (β = 2.29 years [1.57-3.01, 
p = 9.70e-10] for race, partial η2 = 0.091, model adjusted R2 = 0.242) were 
significantly greater in Black compared to White participants. Critically, CAI 
total score (proportion mediated: 0.185 [0.073-0.34, p = 6e-4]) significantly 
mediated the relationship between race and GAA. Further analysis attributed this 
difference to more traumatic events, particularly assaultive traumas and death 
of loved ones. Our results suggest that, prior to development of significant 
chronic disease, Black individuals have increased epigenetic age compared to 
White participants and that increased cumulative stress and traumatic events may 
contribute significantly to this epigenetic aging difference.

INTRODUCTION: Given the progressive aging of the population, there is an urgent 
need at the health system level to implement effective models to care for older 
people (OP). Healthy aging is imperative to reach the Sustainable Development 
Goals. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed the Integrated Care for 
Older People (ICOPE) strategy to address this challenge. Implementing ICOPE 
requires its adaption to a specific context. We propose a pathway for such 
adaptation through an evaluation of the design of ICOPE; thus, we aim to 
describe the Theory of Change (ToC) of ICOPE and evaluate it for its 
implementation in Mexico City.
METHODS: Based on the WHO and published literature documentation, we drafted an 
initial ToC for ICOPE. Then, we validated the ToC with experts in ICOPE, after 
which we evaluated and refined it by discussing the causal pathway, intervention 
required to activate it, rationale, and assumptions in consecutive workshops 
with 91 stakeholders and healthcare workers, using the nominal group technique 
to reach a consensus.
RESULTS: The resulting ToC has the potential to contribute to healthy aging by 
three expected impacts: (1) prevention, reversal, or delaying of the decline of 
intrinsic capacity (IC) in OP; (2) improvement of the quality of life of OP; and 
(3) increase of disability-free life expectancy. The ICOPE causal pathway had 
ten preconditions, including the availability of resources, identifying at-risk 
individuals, available treatments, and evaluating results.
DISCUSSION: We adapted ICOPE to a specific implementation context by evaluating 
its ToC in a participatory process that allows us to identify challenges and 
address them, at least in terms of the guidelines to operate the strategy. As 
ICOPE is an approach for a primary healthcare system, its adoption in a 
community healthcare program is promising and feasible. Evaluation as a tool 
could contribute to the design of effective interventions. The evaluation of the 
design of ICOPE for its implementation contributes to the strength of its 
potential to improve care for OP. This design for implementing ICOPE has the 
potential to be applied to similar contexts, for example, in other 
lower-middle-income countries.
