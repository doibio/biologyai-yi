The Fontan operation or the total cavopulmonary connection is a palliative 
surgery for single ventricle congenital heart disease where the systemic venous 
return circumvents a pumping chamber and flows directly into the pulmonary 
circuit. With surgical and medical advances, there has been improvement in life 
expectancy of these patients, however, it has also resulted in unique 
complications from the physiology that requires diligent surveillance. A 
critical component relies on optimal imaging for diagnosis and treatment of 
these complications. This article describes the normal anatomy of the Fontan 
circulation, current imaging modalities and techniques, and frequently 
encountered complications seen when imaging the patients who have undergone 
Fontan palliation.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as the 
preferred alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement in elderly patients. 
However, the long-term outcomes of nonagenarians undergoing TAVR are unknown.
METHODS: Octogenarian and nonagenarian patients undergoing TAVR from 2011 to 
2018 were identified from a prospectively maintained institutional database. Cox 
proportional hazards regression was used for baseline-adjusted outcome 
comparison and risk prediction. Survival was compared with age and 
gender-matched population from the Social Security Actuarial Life Table.
RESULTS: A total of 649 (54.4%) octogenarians and 157 (13.2%) nonagenarians 
underwent TAVR. Nonagenarians had a lower body mass index (P < .001), smaller 
BSA (P < .001), and a lower prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(P = .023) but a higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (P < .001). The 
majority of nonagenarians and octogenarians were treated using self-expandable 
valves (60.3% vs 60.9%; P = .888) via transfemoral access (86.0% vs 81.0%; P = 
.148). At 30 days, 1 year, and 4 years, there was no difference in survival 
(95.5%, 80.3%, and 51.2% vs 96.9%, 87.4, and 57.6%, respectively) (adjusted 
hazard ratio [HR], 0.8; P = .205) and hospital readmissions for cardiac causes 
(7.9%, 25.7%, and 53.7% vs 10.3%, 27.9%, and 52.0%, respectively) (adjusted HR, 
0.9; P = .488). Further, nonagenarians had a survival comparable to an 
age-matched and sex-matched U.S. population (P = .540). Post-TAVR paravalvular 
leak (HRs: 3.23 [P = .042] vs 2.66 [P = .032]) and anemia (HRs: 0.64 [P = .002] 
vs 0.80 [P = .004]) were associated with worse outcomes at 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR can be performed safely in nonagenarians, with comparable 
outcomes to younger patients approximating natural life expectancy. This age 
paradox should strengthen the role of TAVR in well selected nonagenarians by the 
heart team.

Trait anxiety refers to the stable tendency to attend to threats and experience 
fears and worries across many situations. According to the widely noticed, 
pioneering investigation by Etkin et al. (2004) trait anxiety is strongly 
associated with reactivity in the right basolateral amygdala to non-conscious 
threat. Although this observation was based on a sample of only 17 individuals, 
no replication effort has been reported yet. We reexamined automatic amygdala 
responsiveness as a function of anxiety in a large sample of 107 participants. 
Besides self-report instruments, we administered an indirect test to assess 
implicit anxiety. To assess early, automatic stages of emotion processing, we 
used a color-decision paradigm presenting brief (33 ms) and backward-masked 
fearful facial expressions. N = 56 participants were unaware of the presence of 
masked faces. In this subset of unaware participants, the relationship between 
trait anxiety and basolateral amygdala activation by fearful faces was 
successfully replicated in region of interest analyses. Additionally, a relation 
of implicit anxiety with masked fear processing in the amygdala and temporal 
gyrus was observed. We provide evidence that implicit measures of affect can be 
valuable predictors of automatic brain responsiveness and may represent useful 
additions to explicit measures. Our findings support a central role of amygdala 
reactivity to non-consciously perceived threat in understanding and predicting 
dispositional anxiety, i.e. the frequency of spontaneously occurring anxiety in 
everyday life.

Brain plasticity potential is a central theme in neuro-oncology and is currently 
receiving increased attention. Advances in treatment have prolonged life 
expectancy in neuro-oncological patients and the long-term preservation of their 
quality of life is, therefore, a new challenge. To this end, a better 
understanding of brain plasticity mechanisms is vital as it can help prevent 
permanent deficits following neurosurgery. Indeed, reorganization processes can 
be fundamental to prevent or recover neurological and cognitive deficits by 
reallocating brain functions outside the lesioned areas. According to more 
recent studies in the literature, brain reorganization taking place following 
neurosurgery is associated with good neurofunctioning at follow-up. 
Interestingly, in the last few years, the number of reports on plasticity has 
notably increased. Aim of the current review was to provide a comprehensive 
overview of pre- and postoperative neuroplasticity patterns. Within this 
framework, we aimed to shed light on some tricky issues, including i) 
involvement of the contralateral healthy hemisphere, ii) role and potential 
changes of white matter and connectivity patterns, and iii) reorganization in 
low- versus high-grade gliomas. We finally discussed the practical implications 
of these aspects and role of additional potentially relevant factors to be 
explored. Final purpose was to provide a guideline helpful in promoting increase 
in the extent of tumor resection while preserving the patients' neurological and 
cognitive functioning.

BACKGROUND: Radioactive iodine (RAI) remnant ablation is recommended in patients 
with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and extrathyroidal extension or central 
lymph node metastasis. However, there exists little evidence about the necessity 
of remnant ablation in PTC patients with low- to intermediate-risk, those have 
been increasing in recent decades.
METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, parallel group clinical 
trial will enroll 310 eligible patients with low- to intermediate-risk of 
thyroid cancer. Inclusion criteria are patients who recently underwent total 
thyroidectomy for PTC with 3 or less tumors of size 1≤ to ≤2 cm with no 
microscopic extension and N0/x, or size ≤2 cm with microscopic extension and/or 
N1a (number of lymph node ≤3, size of tumor foci ≤0.2 cm, and lymph node ratio 
&lt;0.4). Patients choose to undergo RAI ablation (131I, dose 1.1 GBq) or 
diagnostic whole-body scan (DxWBS) (131I or 123I, dose 0.074 to 0.222 GBq), 
followed by subsequent measurement of stimulated thyroglobulin (sTg) within 1 
year. Survey for quality of life (QOL) will be performed at baseline and at 1 
year after follow-up. The total enrollment period is 5 years, and patients will 
be followed up for 1 year. The primary endpoint is the non-inferiority of 
surgery alone to surgery with ablation in terms of biochemical remission (BCR) 
rate (sTg ≤2 ng/mL) without evidence of structural recurrence. The secondary 
endpoint was the difference of QOL.
CONCLUSION: This study will evaluate whether surgery alone achieves similar BCR 
and improved QOL compared to RAI ablation in patients with low- to 
intermediate-risk PTC within 1 year.

BACKGROUND: The 'Prehospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the 
Effectiveness of Drug Administration In Cardiac Arrest' (PARAMEDIC2) trial 
showed that adrenaline improves overall survival, but not neurological outcomes. 
We sought to determine the within-trial and lifetime health and social care 
costs and benefits associated with adrenaline, including secondary benefits from 
organ donation.
METHODS: We estimated the costs, benefits (quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) associated with adrenaline 
during the 6-month trial follow-up. Model-based analyses explored how results 
altered when the time horizon was extended beyond 6 months and the scope 
extended to include recipients of donated organs.
RESULTS: The within-trial (6 months) and lifetime horizon economic evaluations 
focussed on the trial population produced ICERs of £1,693,003 (€1,946,953) and 
£81,070 (€93,231) per QALY gained in 2017 prices, respectively, reflecting 
significantly higher mean costs and only marginally higher mean QALYs in the 
adrenaline group. The probability that adrenaline is cost-effective was less 
than 1% across a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds. Combined direct 
economic effects over the lifetimes of survivors and indirect economic effects 
in organ recipients produced an ICER of £16,086 (€18,499) per QALY gained for 
adrenaline with the probability that adrenaline is cost-effective increasing to 
90% at a £30,000 (€34,500) per QALY cost-effectiveness threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Adrenaline was not cost-effective when only directly related costs 
and consequences are considered. However, incorporating the indirect economic 
effects associated with transplanted organs substantially alters 
cost-effectiveness, suggesting decision-makers should consider the complexity of 
direct and indirect economic impacts of adrenaline.

The estimation of health state utility values in rare diseases: overview of 
existing techniques.

There are several techniques for estimating health state utility values, each of 
which presents pros and cons in the context of rare diseases (RDs). Direct 
approaches (e.g. standard gamble and time trade-off) may be too demanding for 
patients with RDs, since most of them affect young children or cause cognitive 
impairment. The alternatives are using "vignettes" that describe hypothetical 
health states for the general public, which may not reflect the heterogeneous 
manifestations of RDs, or multi-attribute utility instruments (i.e. indirect 
techniques), such as EQ-5D, which may be less sensitive in capturing the 
specificities of RDs. The "rule of rescue" approach is a promising alternative 
in RDs, since it prioritizes identifiable patients with life-threatening or 
disabling conditions. However, it raises measurement challenges and ethical 
issues. Furthermore, the literature reports on relevant implications of choosing 
a technique over others for health technology assessment, which should be 
considered in relation to individual RDs.

Transition milk (TM, defined here as the second through fourth milkings after 
calving) supplies additional fat, protein, and immunoglobulins to the calf 
compared with milk replacer at industry-suggested feeding rates (∼14% solids). 
Our objective was to determine whether 9 feedings of TM on d 2 through 4 of life 
increase the growth rate and overall health of calves. Holstein heifer calves on 
a commercial farm were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 diets (n = 35/diet): milk 
replacer (MR; Purina Warm Front BOV MOS Medicated Milk Replacer, St. Louis, MO), 
TM, or a 50:50 blend of MR and colostrum replacer (MCR; Alta HiCal Colostrum 
Powder Replacer, the Saskatoon Colostrum Company Ltd., Saskatoon, SK, Canada). 
The TM was harvested from Holstein cows on the farm, pooled, and pasteurized at 
71.7°C for 15 s. Nutrient composition on a dry matter basis of TM was 25.9% fat, 
41.8% protein, and 14% solids; MR was 10.3% fat, 27.8% protein, and 14% solids; 
and MCR was 14.6% fat, 38.6% protein, and 15% solids. All calves received 
IgG-enriched colostrum replacer for the first 2 feedings after birth. 
Subsequently, calves were fed 1.9 L of MR, TM, or MCR 3 times per day for 3 d 
(starting on d 2). After initial diets ended, calves were fed and managed 
similarly. Body weights (d 1, 7, 14, 21, and 56), blood samples (d 1, 7, 14, and 
21), and daily health scores (scale of 0 to 3, with 0 representing normal or 
healthy and 3 representing severe symptoms or ill) were collected through 
weaning at 56 d. All except 1 calf achieved successful transfer of passive 
immunity, with serum IgG values greater than 10.0 mg/mL. From birth through 
weaning, calves fed TM and MCR gained 3 kg more total body weight than those fed 
MR (34.3, 34.3, and 31.3 kg, respectively). Increased metabolizable energy 
(using NRC 2001 recommendations) in TM accounts for 0.68 kg of the increased 
gain compared with MR. Treatment did not alter health scores for ears, eyes, or 
feces. Haptoglobin concentrations were lower in TM and MCR than in MR calves 
(4.63, 3.62, and 7.54 µg/mL, respectively), whereas lipopolysaccharide binding 
protein concentrations were not different. In conclusion, compared with MR 
alone, feeding TM or MR with colostrum replacer for 3 d increased growth rate of 
calves throughout the preweaning period.

PURPOSE: The AXEPT trial demonstrated that modified XELIRI (mXELIRI; 
capecitabine + irinotecan) was noninferior to standard treatment with FOLFIRI 
(fluorouracil + leucovorin + irinotecan), both ± bevacizumab, in the treatment 
of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The present study was designed to 
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mXELIRI versus FOLFIRI as a second-line 
treatment of mCRC.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate the costs and health outcomes 
of mXELIRI and FOLFIRI in patients with mCRC from the Chinese payer perspective. 
Survival data, transition probabilities, and health utility values were obtained 
from published studies. The costs of drugs were obtained from the West China 
Hospital. Life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, 
incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) values were regarded as the primary end points. One-way sensitivity 
analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to evaluate the 
impact of uncertainty of parameters in the analysis.
FINDINGS: The effectiveness was found to be 0.48 QALYs (1.14 LYs) in the mXELIRI 
arm and 0.41 QALYs (1.05 LYs) in the FOLFIRI arm, with total costs of 29,896.41 
US dollars (USD) in the mXELIRI arm and 28,894.68 USD in the FOLFIRI arm. The 
ICER and ICUR with mXELIRI versus FOLFIRI were 11,130.33 USD/LY and 14,310.43 
USD/QALY gained, which were less than the willingness-to-pay threshold in China 
(25,840.88 USD/QALY).
IMPLICATIONS: Based on the results of this study, mXELIRI was found to be a 
cost-effective alternative to FOLFIRI as a second-line treatment of mCRC in 
patients in China.

Clozapine is the only antipsychotic compound indicated for 
refractory-schizophrenia. However, it is associated with emergent metabolic 
dysregulation and cardiovascular risk which may lead to mortality. In this study 
we aimed to explore predictors for mortality in a large cohort of schizophrenia 
patients treated with long-term clozapine, using the electronic medical records 
of the largest health care provider in Israel. Among 27,929 patients diagnosed 
with schizophrenia, 1817 were prescribed clozapine during the years 2012-2014. 
We compared patients who survived (n=1705) and patients who died (n=112) during 
the 3-year follow-up period. Socio-demographic background, cardiovascular 
morbidity, medication prescriptions and health-care utilization were compared 
between groups. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the 
association of variables with survival. Chronic hypertension was found to be the 
only metabolic factor associated with significant hazard ratio (HR) for 
mortality (HR: 1.55 95% CI: 1.03-2.34). Moreover, those who died had more 
prevalent ischemic heart disease (14% vs 3%, p<0.005) as well as more frequent 
hospitalizations (0.01±0.02 vs 0.11±0.18 average per month, p<0.005), for longer 
periods (2.22±9.87 vs 20.38±33.76 days per month, p<0.005). Among those who 
died, less patients received prescriptions of statins for hyperlipidemia (13.7% 
vs. 52.9% in survivors, p<0.005) and hypoglycemics for diabetes mellitus (16.3% 
vs. 67.1% in survivors, p<0.005). Inadequate treatment of metabolic syndrome, 
under chronic clozapine treatment, was found to be an independent predictor for 
mortality. Adequate rigorous regimen for diagnosis and treatment of metabolic 
risk factors, especially hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus, might lower 
complications rate and prolong life expectancy among this population.

Oxaliplatin (OXL) therapy often causes side effects including chronic peripheral 
neuropathy. We investigated the pain-relieving effects of recombinant human 
lactoferrin (rhLf) as well as a long-acting IgG-Fc fused rhLf (rhLf-Fc) on 
OXL-induced neuropathic pain. We used the hLf in this study, because the 
homology between mouse Lf and hLf is higher than that of bovine Lf. In addition, 
rhLf-Fc is expected to enhance the analgesic effect due to the life extension 
effect in the body. We administered OXL (2 mg/kg, i.v.) to mice twice weekly for 
4 weeks. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS), rhLf (100 mg/kg, i.p.) or rhLf-Fc (100 
mg/kg, i.p.) was administered once a week from day 15 to 32. We also assessed 
the continuous infusion of same drugs (10 mg/kg/day) into the external jugular 
vein by using an osmotic pump. Both of rhLf and rhLf-Fc significantly reduced 
the hypersensitivity to mechanical stimulation when they were administered 
intraperitoneally. The continuous infusion of rhLf resulted in a more pronounced 
effect. Histopathological analysis of sciatic nerve showed that both rhLf and 
rhLf-Fc tended to reduce nerve fiber damage, but no significant difference was 
observed in nerve fiber cross-sectional area. Therefore, it was suggested that 
rhLf or rhLf-Fc injection could be an option for controlling neuropathic pain, 
which are side effects of OXL.

Difficult situations bring not only challenges but also fruitful opportunities. 
The pandemic of COVID-19 by itself and the related governmental or individual 
level measures have their own challenges and opportunities to the community, 
which even might be directly or indirectly related to the control and prevention 
of the pandemic. The silver linings of the pandemic of COVID-19 should be 
uncovered to encourage the community not only to focus on the black side of the 
disease but also to enjoy the opportunities. This can contribute to facilitate 
the control of the disease and avoid the related panics. In this review, we have 
discussed the challenges of COVID-19 in Ethiopia in terms of health, economy, 
and social life, and the silver linings in terms of research opportunities, 
technological transformation, reading culture, and family discussion. The 
literatures used in this review were published and unpublished articles, 
reports, and working papers from Google Scholar, PubMed, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and 
official websites of national and international organizations.

In recent years, three large populations of Cyperus flavescens were found in 
Poland, the richest occurrence of this species in over 30 years. The goal of 
this research is to determine the habitat factors lead to the mass occurrence of 
C. flavescens and the present situation of that species and its habitat in 
Central Europe. Soil conditions of the three populations were studied. To 
determine the correlation between the occurrence and abundance of species and 
the chemical parameters of the soil, the DCA and CCA methods were used. The DCA 
of environmental Ellenberg values was made for all relevés known from Poland. 
The occurrence of C. flavescens in plant communities in Central Europe was 
studied. The maximum entropy method was used for potential distribution analysis 
of C. flavescens. All analyzed traits are important for this species and none 
has an advantage over another, so the environmental factor affecting the 
occurrence of C. flavescens is different from the tested. Analysis on Ellenberg 
values indicate that the longest gradients are temperature, moisture and 
nutrients. The analysis of vegetation data involving Cyperus flavescens 
available from Central Europe indicates that this species occurs mainly in the 
company of Juncus bufonius and Plantago intermedia, whereas other species of the 
Isoëto-Nanojuncetea class appear rarely. In MaxEnt analysis based on bioclimatic 
variables, the most important variable is BIO1 (Annual Mean Temperature). The 
results of our observation indicate that anthropogenic factors such as grazing 
livestock have a positive effect on the occurrence of the species. It is also 
very likely that the species is promoted by very warm summers with only short 
periods of heavy rains. A map of the potential distribution of C. flavescens in 
Central Europe created according historical and future data show an extension of 
the range of potential habitats to the north and east.

The data described in this article are supplementary to our primary article 
"Platelet factor 4 regulates T cell effector functions in malignant pleural 
effusions". Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common complication of 
advanced lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) associated with a poor life expectancy [1]. 
Several challenges need to be addressed to identify non-invasive molecular 
biomarkers that help to predict the prognosis of LAC patients with MPE [2]. In 
the primary publication, we proposed that platelet-derived factors, especially 
platelet factor 4 (PF4), can negatively regulate T lymphocyte activation and 
granzyme B expression in pleural metastasis and its levels were associated with 
a worse prognosis. Here, we provide data on the influence of other 
platelet-derived factors, including transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), 
vascular endothelial factor (VEGF), and P-selectin on T lymphocyte response in 
MPE and their relevance as prognostic factors in lung cancer patients with 
pleural metastasis. Pleural fluids from 35 lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) and 20 
heart failure (HF) patients were collected by thoracentesis and its 
platelet-derived factors' content was measured by specific enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISAs). Correlations between pleural levels of 
platelet-derived factors and T cell functions were analyzed by Pearson 
coefficients. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the effect of pleural 
concentrations of platelet-derived factors on overall survival of LAC patients 
with pleural metastasis. These analyses showed that the concentration of 
platelet-derived factors was not associated with T cell proliferation and 
cytotoxicity. Furthermore, their levels do not predict the survival of LAC with 
MPE.

BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with 
complex medical comorbidities extending beyond the nervous system requiring the 
attention of health professionals. There is no peer-reviewed, consensus-based 
therapeutic guidance to care in RTT. The objective was to provide consensus on 
guidance of best practice for addressing these concerns.
METHODS: Informed by the literature and using a modified Delphi approach, a 
consensus process was used to develop guidance for care in RTT by health 
professionals.
RESULTS: Typical RTT presents early in childhood in a clinically recognisable 
fashion. Multisystem comorbidities evolve throughout the lifespan requiring 
coordination of care between primary care and often multiple subspecialty 
providers. To assist health professionals and families in seeking best practice, 
a checklist and detailed references for guidance were developed by consensus.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall multisystem issues of RTT require primary care 
providers and other health professionals to manage complex medical comorbidities 
within the context of the whole individual and family. Given the median life 
expectancy well into the sixth decade, guidance is provided to health 
professionals to achieve current best possible outcomes for these special-needs 
individuals.

With increasing life expectancy, the demand for knee replacement is continuously 
rising. Despite the use of antibiotic prophylaxis and improved aseptic surgical 
techniques, periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) still occurs in 1% to 5% of 
patients after primary arthroplasty. An open question is the influence of PJI 
and resulting surgical procedures on the occurrence of long-term complications 
such as aseptic loosening. Patients needing multiple revision surgeries are 
especially at risk for decreases in bone mass and damage to the medullary 
cavity. Thus, we theorized that prior surgeries on the affected knee increase 
the risk of aseptic loosening in patients with PJI.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the cases of 100 patients who underwent 
total knee replacement exchange surgery as a result of PJI. In addition to 
clinical, paraclinical, and radiographic examination, we assessed comorbidities 
and the number of prior surgeries.
RESULTS: Prosthetic survival was drastically decreased after PJI-related 
revision arthroplasty: during the first 7.3 years after reimplantation, 22% and 
16% of all patients had aseptic loosening and recurrent PJI, respectively. The 
prevalence of aseptic loosening was 27.8% for female and 15.2% for male 
patients. A significant association between increasing patients' American 
Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification and prosthetic failure rates 
was found, as was a strong correlation between number of prior surgeries and 
aseptic loosening.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found notable rates of aseptic loosening and 
recurrent PJI following PJI-related revision arthroplasty. The difference in the 
rate of aseptic loosening among male and female patients supports theories of 
the role of bone metabolism in the development of aseptic loosening. The 
economic and clinical burdens of prosthetic failure make it paramount to gain a 
better understanding of bone metabolism in PJI. Additional research should 
address the need to optimize treatment strategies to increase prosthetic 
survival.

Gene Therapy of the Hemoglobinopathies.

Heidelberg, Hopp - Children's Cancer Center Heidelberg (KiTZ), Heidelberg,

Sickle cell disease and the ß-thalassemias are caused by mutations of the 
ß-globin gene and represent the most frequent single gene disorders worldwide. 
Even in European countries with a previous low frequency of these conditions the 
prevalence has substantially increased following large scale migration from 
Africa and the Middle East to Europe. The hemoglobin diseases severely limit 
both, life expectancy and quality of life and require either life-long 
supportive therapy if cure cannot be achieved by allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation. Strategies for ex vivo gene therapy aiming at either 
re-establishing normal ß-globin chain synthesis or at re-activating fetal 
γ-globin chain and HbF expression are currently in clinical development. The 
European Medicine Agency (EMA) conditionally licensed gene addition therapy 
based on lentiviral transduction of hematopoietic stem cells in 2019 for a 
selected group of patients with transfusion dependent non-ß° thalassemia major 
without a suitable stem cell donor. Gene therapy thus offers a relevant chance 
to this group of patients for whom cure has previously not been on the horizon. 
In this review, we discuss the potential and the challenges of gene addition and 
gene editing strategies for the hemoglobin diseases.
