During menopause, women's body composition, sex hormone profile, and metabolic 
profile may change dramatically. In this review, we summarize studies examining 
whether the menopausal transition and physiologic factors characterizing the 
transition are associated with increased risk of diabetes. We review the 
evidence for estrogen therapy and diabetes risk and studies examining the 
relationship between diabetes and menarche, which represents an extension of the 
reproductive life span at the opposite end of the age spectrum. Although studied 
less extensively, the presence of type 1 or type 2 diabetes may increase the 
risk of ovarian failure, and we review this literature. In conclusion, we note 
that the evidence linking menopausal sex hormone changes with increased diabetes 
risk is weak, although rapid changes as observed with oophorectomy may increase 
risk. Further studies should investigate the contradictory effects of estrogen 
therapy upon hepatic and glucose metabolism in mid-life women.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of various mathematical 
modelling methods, while forecasting medical waste generation using Lithuania's 
annual medical waste data. Only recently has a hazardous waste collection system 
that includes medical waste been created and therefore the study access to gain 
large sets of relevant data for its research has been somewhat limited. 
According to data that was managed to be obtained, it was decided to develop 
three short and extra short datasets with 20, 10 and 6 observations. Spearman's 
correlation calculation showed that the influence of independent variables, such 
as visits at hospitals and other medical institutions, number of children in the 
region, number of beds in hospital and other medical institutions, average life 
expectancy and doctor's visits in that region are the most consistent and common 
in all three datasets. Tests on the performance of artificial neural networks, 
multiple linear regression, partial least squares, support vector machines and 
four non-parametric regression methods were conducted on the collected datasets. 
The best and most promising results were demonstrated by generalised additive 
(R(2) = 0.90455) in the regional data case, smoothing splines models 
(R(2) = 0.98584) in the long annual data case and multilayer feedforward 
artificial neural networks in the short annual data case (R(2) = 0.61103).

BACKGROUND: In each society, the health of women in different periods may be 
endangered by an unequal distribution of resources, facilities, and gender 
prejudices. The present study evaluated the time trend of Iranian women's health 
between 1990 and 2013.
METHODS: This narrative review includes an integration and descriptive summary 
of the existing evidence on trends and criteria of different aspects of women's 
health from social determinant point of view. The evidence was drawn from 
peer-reviewed, cross-national or large-scale studies, official sources of the 
Ministry of Health, reviews, and online scientific databases published between 
1990 and 2013.
RESULTS: The average life expectancy of Iranian women has increased from 44.15 
years in 1960 to 75.75 years in 2012; in most deprived provinces of Iran, 
however, this criterion is about 67.3 years, and in the capital it is 75.8 
years. In 2011, 43.37 % of DALYS, 36.21 % of YLL, and 1.92 % of YLD were 
dedicated to women; these figures were 3.63 % lower than they were in 2003. 
Although a significant reduction has occurred in maternal mortality rate, which 
dropped from 83 to 23 per 100,000 between 1990 and 2013, there is no equal 
distribution in maternal mortality across the country as manifested by the 
unfavorable conditions of border provinces (SD = 19.2). The prevalence of 
HIV/AIDS is an alarming health problem among Iranian females, increasing 
approximately 546 % between 2007 and 2015. As for mental health, depression in 
women was ranked first among diseases in 2011 compared to a second place ranking 
in 2003. As regards social health, the delinquency of women has increased in 
recent years compared to men with women committing more crimes related to drugs 
and actions against virtue. The annual report of the United Nations for the 
gender gap index in 2013 ranked Iran as 130 among 136 countries (from 0.622 in 
2000 to 0.584 in 2013).
CONCLUSION: Generally, over the last three decades, the health indices of 
Iranian women have grown in aspects of physical, mental, and social health. 
Remarkable differences can be seen among female health indices based on 
geographic location and in comparison with men. To promote an improved health 
status for Iranian women, the root causes of the discrepancies must be 
identified and a comprehensive national plan must be established.

BACKGROUND: The International Carotid Stenting Study was a multicenter 
randomized trial in which patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis were 
randomly allocated to treatment by carotid stenting or endarterectomy. Economic 
evidence comparing these treatments is limited and inconsistent.
AIMS: We compared the cost-effectiveness of stenting versus endarterectomy using 
International Carotid Stenting Study data.
METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis estimating mean costs and 
quality-adjusted life years per patient for both treatments over a five-year 
time horizon based on resource use data and utility values collected in the 
trial. Costs of managing stroke events were estimated using individual patient 
data from a UK population-based study (Oxford Vascular Study).
RESULTS: Mean costs per patient (95% CI) were US$10,477 ($9669 to $11,285) in 
the stenting group (N = 853) and $9669 ($8835 to $10,504) in the endarterectomy 
group (N = 857). There were no differences in mean quality-adjusted life years 
per patient (3.247 (3.160 to 3.333) and 3.228 (3.150 to 3.306), respectively). 
There were no differences in adjusted costs between groups (mean incremental 
costs for stenting versus endarterectomy $736 (95% CI -$353 to $1826)) or 
adjusted outcomes (mean quality-adjusted life years gained -0.010 (95% CI -0.117 
to 0.097)). The incremental net monetary benefit for stenting versus 
endarterectomy was not significantly different from zero at the maximum 
willingness to pay for a quality-adjusted life year commonly used in the UK. 
Sensitivity analyses showed little uncertainty in these findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Economic considerations should not affect whether patients with 
symptomatic carotid stenosis undergo stenting or endarterectomy.

Primary cilia protrude from the surface of quiescent cells and disassemble at 
cell cycle reentry. We previously showed that ciliary reassembly is suppressed 
by trichoplein-mediated Aurora A activation pathway in growing cells. Here, we 
report that Ndel1, a well-known modulator of dynein activity, localizes at the 
subdistal appendage of the mother centriole, which nucleates a primary cilium. 
In the presence of serum, Ndel1 depletion reduces trichoplein at the mother 
centriole and induces unscheduled primary cilia formation, which is reverted by 
forced trichoplein expression or coknockdown of KCTD17 (an E3 ligase component 
protein for trichoplein). Serum starvation induced transient Ndel1 degradation, 
subsequent to the disappearance of trichoplein at the mother centriole. Forced 
expression of Ndel1 suppressed trichoplein degradation and axonemal microtubule 
extension during ciliogenesis, similar to trichoplein induction or KCTD17 
knockdown. Most importantly, the proportion of ciliated and quiescent cells was 
increased in the kidney tubular epithelia of newborn Ndel1-hypomorphic mice. 
Thus, Ndel1 acts as a novel upstream regulator of the trichoplein-Aurora A 
pathway to inhibit primary cilia assembly.

BACKGROUND: Further increases in life expectancy in high-income countries depend 
to a large extent on advances in old-age survival. We aimed to characterise the 
spatial distribution of old-age survival across small areas of Europe, and to 
identify areas with significantly high or low survivorship.
METHODS: This study incorporated 4404 small areas from 18 European countries. We 
used a 10-year survival rate to express the proportion of population aged 
75-84 years who reached 85-94 years of age (beyond average life expectancy). 
This metric was calculated for each gender using decennial census data (1991, 
2001 and 2011) at small geographical areas. To address problems associated with 
small areas, rates were smoothed using a Bayesian spatial model. Excursion sets 
were defined to identify areas with significantly high (>95th centile) and low 
(<5th) survival.
RESULTS: In 2011, on average, 47.1% (range: 22.5-71.5) of the female population 
aged 75-84 years had reached 85-94 years of age, compared to 34.2% (16.4-49.6) 
of the males. These figures, however, hide important and time-persistent spatial 
inequalities. Higher survival rates were concentrated in northern Spain, Andorra 
and northeastern Italy, and in the south and west of France. Lower survival was 
found in parts of the UK, Scandinavia and the Netherlands, and in some areas of 
southern Europe. Within these regions, we detected areas with significantly high 
and low old-age survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Clear and persistent spatial inequalities in old-age survival 
exist, suggesting that European social unity is still to be accomplished. These 
inequalities could arise from a myriad of population health determinants (eg, 
poverty, unhealthy lifestyles), which merit further study.

BACKGROUND: Substance misuse and excessive alcohol consumption are major public 
health issues. Internet-based interventions for substance use disorders (SUDs) 
are a relatively new method for addressing barriers to access and supplementing 
existing care. This study examines cost-effectiveness in a multisite, randomized 
trial of an internet-based version of the community reinforcement approach (CRA) 
with contingency management (CM) known as the Therapeutic Education System 
(TES).
METHODS: Economic evaluation of the 12-week trial with follow-up at 24 and 36 
weeks. 507 individuals who were seeking therapy for alcohol or other substance 
use disorders at 10 outpatient community-based treatment programs were recruited 
and randomized to either treatment as usual (TAU) or TES+TAU. Sub-analyses were 
completed on participants with a poorer prognosis (i.e., those not abstinent at 
study entry).
RESULTS: From the provider's perspective, TES+TAU as it was implemented in this 
study costs $278 (SE=87) more than TAU alone after 12 weeks. The 
quality-adjusted life years gained by TES+TAU and TAU were similar; however, 
TES+TAU has at least a 95% chance of being considered cost-effective for 
providers and payers with willingness-to-pay thresholds as low as $20,000 per 
abstinent year. Findings for the subgroup not abstinent at study entry are 
slightly more favorable.
CONCLUSIONS: With regard to the clinical outcome of abstinence, our 
cost-effectiveness findings of TES+TAU compare favorably to those found 
elsewhere in the CM literature. The analyses performed here serve as an initial 
economic framework for future studies integrating technology into SUD therapy.

Elderly people as "apocalyptic demography"? A study of the life stories of older 
people in Hong Kong born in the 1930s.

In Hong Kong, the general view still follows the biomedical discourse to define 
aging. The government and leading gerontologists follow the prevailing 
representation of elderly and describe growing old as a process of becoming 
"frail, infirm, and vulnerable" (Fealy et al., 2012: 91). Discussions of 
demographic trends often focus on the drastic effects of an aging society on 
economic development. Our research indicates that Hong Kong's construction of 
aging is a product of its market-driven economy. Drawing from the life stories 
of eight participants born in the 1930s, we examine the meaning of aging and the 
formation of character in a specific historical context, adopting the 
life-course perspective. We wish to understand how larger movements in the 
social and political world shaped the experiences of the participants and the 
strategies they developed to maintain agency and control in life. The 
participants in our study struggled for survival through unprecedented political 
disasters and social turmoil in their youth. When they reached maturity in the 
1960s and 1970s, they devoted themselves to bettering their lives and 
contributed to the economic boom of the city. We maintain that the biomedical 
model offers a reductive and unjust means of viewing the people in this cohort, 
who are often seen as a problem and a burden. Challenging the prevailing ageist 
attitude, we set the life stories of the participants against the dominant 
biomedical model of aging. Our work aims to establish a just description of the 
life experiences of Hong Kong people.

Nanotrastuzumab in combination with radioimmunotherapy: Can it be a viable 
treatment option for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with brain 
metastasis?

Brain metastasis of primary breast cancer (BCBM) has been rising during the last 
couple of decades. Approximately 25% of the patients with BCBM have a hormone 
receptor-negative, HER2-positive disease. Given the short life expectancy in 
patients with BCBM, researchers have tried many new approaches, including 
cesium-131(131Cs) brachytherapy, radretumab radioimmunotherapy and 
nanoparticles. Novel biological drug delivery techniques have successfully 
delivered nanobioconjugates across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, 
nanobioconjugates have significant toxicities and other drawbacks that prevent 
therapeutic concentrations of the active drug from being delivered to the brain 
lesions. Radretumab radioimmunotherapy combined with nanotrastruzumab can 
theoretically overcome this challenge. Radiotherapy can increase the BBB 
permeability, which can promote the transport and effect of nanotrastuzumab, 
reduce radretumab radioimmunotherapy dose and target patients with HER2-positive 
BCBM lesions more specifically. In this article, we propose that nanotrastuzumab 
in combination with radioimmunotherapy could be a viable treatment option for 
patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with brain metastasis.

Cost-effectiveness of risk-based screening for cervical length to prevent 
preterm birth.

BACKGROUND: Despite much debate, there is no consensus on whether women without 
a history of prior spontaneous preterm birth should receive universal cervical 
length screening. Risk-based screening has been proposed as an alternative to 
universal cervical length measurement and may represent a more cost-effective 
approach to preterm birth prevention.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of risk-based screening 
compared to universal cervical length screening or no screening for preterm 
birth prevention in low-risk women.
STUDY DESIGN: A decision analytic model compared the cost and effectiveness of 3 
cervical length screening strategies in a population of women with no prior 
preterm birth. Risk-based screening, universal screening, and no screening were 
compared using cost, probability, and utility estimates derived from the 
existing literature and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for each 
strategy were calculated.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, risk-based screening and universal screening 
were more effective and less costly than no screening. In comparison to the 
risk-based strategy, universal screening of the United States population of 
women without a prior preterm birth (N = 3.5 million annually) would result in 
2.19 million more transvaginal ultrasounds, 11,027 more women treated with 
vaginal progesterone, 913 fewer preterm births <35 weeks gestational age, and 63 
fewer neonatal deaths at an additional cost of $51,936,699 annually. Despite 
costing more, the additional health benefits of universal screening resulted in 
that strategy being more cost-effective than risk-based screening, with an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $21,144 per quality-adjusted life-year.
CONCLUSION: In women without a prior spontaneous preterm birth, universal 
cervical length screening is cost-effective in comparison to both risk-based 
screening and no screening.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, 
and the number of elderly patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has 
risen with increasing life-expectancy.
AIMS: To evaluate safety and efficacy of thoracoscopic lobectomy for NSCLC 
patients above 75 years old.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the data of 795 consecutive patients with 
NSCLC, who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy from January 2006 to 
December 2013. Patients were divided into two groups: The elderly group aged at 
least 75 years old (n = 54), the contrast group aged <75 years old (n = 741). 
The general characteristic, comorbidity, intraoperative observations, 
complications, operative mortality and long-term survival were compared between 
the two groups.
RESULTS: The elderly group had a higher incidence of squamous cell carcinoma 
(40.74% vs. 29.69%) and a lower incidence of adenocarcinoma (37.04% vs. 52.63%) 
than the contrast group (P = 0.083). The ratio of smoking (61.11% vs. 41.97%), 
preoperative comorbidities (62.96% vs. 38.06%), perioperative blood transfusion 
(25.93% vs. 13.50%) and thoracic intubation indwelling time (10.3 vs. 8.2 days) 
in the elderly group were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference 
in duration of surgery (222.9 vs. 226.6 min), intraoperative blood loss (299.8 
vs. 253.5 min), hospital stay (18.2 vs. 15.8 days) or postoperative hospital 
stay (10.3 vs. 8.4 days) between the two groups. Postoperative morbidities 
occurred more frequently in the elderly group than the contrast group (24.07% 
vs. 12.01%, P = 0.018). Thirty-day mortality rate of two groups showed no 
significant difference (1.85% vs. 0.40%, P = 0.246). The overall survival and 
recurrence-free survival in the elderly group were comparable with the contrast 
group (P = 0.114 and 0.092, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy is a safe and reliable 
approach with acceptable short- and long-term outcome in the elderly.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Klotho is required for the inhibitory effect of FGF23 on 
1,25(OH)2D3 formation and Klotho-hypomorphic mice (kl/kl) suffer from severe 
tissue calcification due to excessive 1,25(OH)2D3 formation with subsequent 
increase of Ca2+ and phosphate concentrations and stimulation of osteogenic 
signaling. The excessive tissue calcification dramatically accelerates aging and 
leads to premature death of the animals. Osteogenic signaling in those mice is 
disrupted by treatment with NH4Cl, which prevents tissue calcification and early 
death of kl/kl mice. The present study explored whether the beneficial effects 
of NH4Cl treatment could be mimicked by NH4NO3 treatment.
METHODS: The kl/kl mice had free access to tap water either without or with 
addition of NH4NO3 (0.28 M) starting with the mating of the parental generation. 
Calcification of trachea, lung, kidney, stomach, heart and vessels was 
visualized by histology with von Kossa staining. Plasma phosphate concentration 
was determined utilizing photometry, blood gas and electrolytes utilizing a 
blood Gas and Chemistry Analysis System and plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 concentration 
with ELISA.
RESULTS: In untreated kl/kl mice plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 and phosphate concentrations 
were elevated, and the mice suffered from marked calcification of all tissues 
analyzed. Untreated kl/kl mice further suffered from respiratory acidosis due to 
marked lung emphysema. NH4NO3-treatment decreased both, blood pCO2 and HCO3-, 
decreased calcification of trachea, lung, kidney, stomach, heart and vessels and 
increased the life span of kl/kl mice more than 1.7-fold (♂) or 1.6-fold (♀) 
without significantly affecting extracellular pH or plasma concentrations of 
1,25(OH)2D3, Ca2+, phosphate, Na+, and K+.
CONCLUSIONS: NH4NO3-treatment turns respiratory acidosis into metabolic acidosis 
and mitigates calcification thus leading to a substantial extension of kl/kl 
mice survival.

BACKGROUND: The cause of primary immunodeficiency has expanded to nearly 200 
distinct disorders. An improved understanding of these disorders has resulted in 
decreased morbidity and mortality with reciprocal improved life expectancy. 
Obstetricians should have knowledge of primary immunodeficiency, as more women 
with these disorders will reach reproductive age.
CASE: 21-year-old G1P0 with purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency 
delivered a viable infant vaginally at 37 weeks. Although the patient's 
diagnosis and pregnancy placed her at increased risk for infection, she remained 
asymptomatic and infection-free throughout pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: The management of pregnancy complicated by PNP deficiency requires 
strict immune surveillance and regimented immunoglobulin replacement.

Objective Ranibizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor designed for 
ocular use, has been deemed cost-effective in multiple indications by several 
Health Technology Assessment bodies. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness 
of ranibizumab monotherapy or combination therapy (ranibizumab plus laser 
photocoagulation) compared with laser monotherapy for the treatment of visual 
impairment due to diabetic macular edema (DME). Methods A Markov model was 
developed in which patients moved between health states defined by 
best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) intervals and an absorbing 'death' state. 
The population of interest was patients with DME due to type 1 or type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Baseline characteristics were based on those of participants 
in the RESTORE study. Main outputs were costs (in 2013 CA$) and health outcomes 
(in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) and the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) was calculated. This cost-utility analysis was conducted from 
healthcare system and societal perspectives in Quebec. Results From a healthcare 
system perspective, the ICERs for ranibizumab monotherapy and combination 
therapy vs laser monotherapy were CA$24 494 and CA$36 414 per QALY gained, 
respectively. The incremental costs per year without legal blindness for 
ranibizumab monotherapy and combination therapy vs laser monotherapy were CA$15 
822 and CA$20 616, respectively. Based on the generally accepted Canadian ICER 
threshold of CA$50 000 per QALY gained, ranibizumab monotherapy and combination 
therapy were found to be cost-effective compared with laser monotherapy. From a 
societal perspective, ranibizumab monotherapy and combination therapy provided 
greater benefits at lower costs than laser monotherapy (ranibizumab therapy 
dominated laser therapy). Conclusions Ranibizumab monotherapy and combination 
therapy resulted in increased quality-adjusted survival and time without legal 
blindness and lower costs from a societal perspective compared with laser 
monotherapy.

Objective To compare the cost-utility of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
agonist albiglutide with those of insulin lispro (both in combination with 
insulin glargine), insulin glargine, and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor 
sitagliptin, representing treatments along the type 2 diabetes treatment 
continuum. Methods The Centre for Outcomes Research and Effectiveness (CORE) 
Diabetes Model was used for the cost-utility analysis. Data from three Phase 3 
clinical trials (HARMONY 6, HARMONY 4, and HARMONY 3) evaluating albiglutide for 
the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes were used for the baseline 
characteristics and treatment effects. Utilities and costs were derived from 
published sources. Results Albiglutide treatment was associated with an 
improvement in mean quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.099, 0.033, and 0.101 
years when compared with insulin lispro, insulin glargine, and sitagliptin, 
respectively. Over the 50-year time horizon, mean total costs in the albiglutide 
arm were $4332, $2597, and $2223 more than in the other respective treatments. 
These costs resulted in an incremental cost-utility ratio of $43,541, $79,166, 
and $22,094 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for albiglutide vs 
insulin lispro, insulin glargine, and sitagliptin, respectively. At a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained, there was a 53.0%, 
41.5%, and 67.5% probability of albiglutide being cost-effective compared with 
the other respective treatments. Limitations This analysis was an extrapolation 
over a 50-year time horizon based on relatively short-term data obtained during 
clinical trials. It does not take into account potential differences between the 
respective treatments in adherence and persistence that can influence both 
effects and costs. Conclusions Albiglutide represents a reasonable treatment 
option for patients with type 2 diabetes based on its cost-utility, relative to 
insulin lispro, insulin glargine, and sitagliptin.

BACKGROUND: French clinical recommendations suggest prescribing long-acting 
injectable (LAI) antipsychotics to patients with a maintenance treatment 
indication in schizophrenia. Despite this, and due to their relatively high 
acquisition and administration costs, LAIs are still underused in clinical 
practice in France, thus highlighting the need for pharmacoeconomic evaluations.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the cost effectiveness of paliperidone 
LAI (or paliperidone palmitate), a once-monthly second-generation LAI 
antipsychotic, compared with the most common antipsychotic medications for the 
maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in France.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the progression of a cohort of 
schizophrenic patients through four health states (stable treated, stable 
non-treated, relapse and death) and to consider up to three lines of treatment 
to account for changes in treatment management. Paliperidone LAI was compared 
with risperidone LAI, aripiprazole LAI, olanzapine LAI, haloperidol LAI (or 
haloperidol decanoate) and oral olanzapine. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) and number of relapses were assessed over 5 years based on 3-month 
cycles with a discount rate of 4% and from a French health insurance 
perspective. Patients were considered to be stabilised after a schizophrenic 
episode and would enter the model at an initiation phase, followed by a 
prevention of relapse phase if successful. Data (e.g. relapse or discontinuation 
rates) for the initiation phase came from randomised clinical trials, whereas 
relapse rates in the prevention phase were derived from hospitalisation risks 
based on real-life French data to capture adherence effects. Safety and utility 
data were derived from international publications. Additionally, costs were 
retrieved from French health insurance databases and publications. Finally, 
expert opinion was used for validation purposes or in case of gaps in data. The 
robustness of results was assessed through deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: All LAI antipsychotics were found to have similar costs over 5 years: 
approximatively €55,000, except for paliperidone LAI which had a discounted cost 
of €50,880. Oral olanzapine was less costly than LAIs (i.e. €50,379 after 5 
years) but was associated with fewer QALYs gained and relapses avoided. 
Paliperidone LAI dominated aripiprazole LAI, olanzapine LAI and haloperidol LAI 
in terms of costs per QALY, and it was associated with slightly fewer QALYs when 
compared with risperidone LAI (i.e. 3.763 vs 3.764). This resulted in a high 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (i.e. €4,770,018 per QALY gained) 
for risperidone LAI compared with paliperidone LAI. Paliperidone LAI was more 
costly than olanzapine oral but associated with more QALYs (i.e. ICER of €2411 
per QALY gained for paliperidone LAI compared with oral olanzapine). 
Paliperidone LAI had a probability of being the optimal strategy in more than 
50% of cases for a willingness-to-pay threshold of €8000 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: This analysis, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its 
kind to assess the cost effectiveness of antipsychotics based on French 
observational data. Paliperidone LAI appeared to be a cost-effective option in 
the treatment of schizophrenia from the French health insurance perspective.

BACKGROUND: For physicians dealing with patients with a limited life expectancy, 
knowing the time to benefit (TTB) of preventive medication is essential to 
support treatment decisions.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of 
statistical process control (SPC) for determining the TTB in relation to 
fracture risk with alendronate versus placebo in postmenopausal women.
METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of the Fracture Intervention Trial 
(FIT), a randomized, controlled trial that investigated the effect of 
alendronate versus placebo on fracture risk in postmenopausal women. We used 
SPC, a statistical method used for monitoring processes for quality control, to 
determine if and when the intervention group benefited significantly more than 
the control group. SPC discriminated between the normal variations over time in 
the numbers of fractures in both groups and the variations that were 
attributable to alendronate. The TTB was defined as the time point from which 
the cumulative difference in the number of clinical fractures remained greater 
than the upper control limit on the SPC chart.
RESULTS: For the total group, the TTB was defined as 11 months. For patients 
aged ≥70 years, the TTB was 8 months [absolute risk reduction (ARR) = 1.4%]; for 
patients aged <70 years, it was 19 months (ARR = 0.7%).
CONCLUSION: SPC is a clear and understandable graphical method to determine the 
TTB. Its main advantage is that there is no need to define a prespecified time 
point, as is the case in traditional survival analyses. Prescribing alendronate 
to patients who are aged ≥70 years is useful because the TTB shows that they 
will benefit after 8 months. Investigators should report the TTB to simplify 
clinical decision making.

The goal of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and diagnostic value 
of both serum p53-antibodies (Abs) and preoperative fine needle aspiration 
cytology (FNAC) for BRAF mutation in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma 
(PTC). A total of 312 patients, including thyroid adenoma (85) and PTC (227) 
were enrolled in this study. Two types of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays 
(ELISA), phage-ELISA and p53-ELISA, were used to measure serum p53-Ab levels. 
Sanger sequencing was used to determine BRAF gene mutation in FNA samples. 
Phage-ELISA was more efficient than conventional p53-ELISA in measuring serum 
p53-Abs in PTC patients. BRAF mutation analysis with FNAC significantly improved 
PTC diagnostic sensitivity from 80.18% to 93.83% (P=0.001) and accuracy from 
82.31% to 92.37% (P=0.005). Bothp53-Abs and BRAF mutation were positively 
associated with lymphatic metastasis and advanced TNM stages. Particularly, 
serum p53-Abs positively associated with multifocality (P=0.02), while BRAF 
mutation associated with extrathyoidal extension (P=0.01). Furthermore, PTC 
patients with both elevated serum p53-Abs and BRAF mutation had a higher 
prevalence of extrathyoidal extension (P=0.003), lymphnode metastasis (P=0.00), 
multifocality (P=0.04), and advanced TNM stages (P=0.004). Our results indicate 
that serum p53-Abs alone might not be a reliable biomarker for PTC diagnosis, 
but the combined analysis of serum p53-Abs and BRAF mutation in FNAC may be 
useful for optimizing surgical treatment and prognostic prediction of 
unfavorable clinicopathologic outcomes.

Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is associated with significant morbidity and 
mortality, as a result of progression towards advanced natural course stages 
including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. On the other hand, the SVR 
following successful therapy is generally associated with resolution of liver 
disease in patients without cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis remain at risk of 
life-threatening complications despite the fact that hepatic fibrosis may 
regress and the risk of complications such as hepatic failure and portal 
hypertension is reduced. Furthermore, recent data suggest that the risk of HCC 
and all-cause mortality is significantly reduced, but not eliminated, in 
cirrhotic patients who clear HCV compared to untreated patients and nonsustained 
virological responders. Data derived from studies have demonstrated a strong 
link between HCV infection and the atherogenic process. Subsequently HCV seems 
to represent a strong, independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, 
carotid atherosclerosis, stroke, and, ultimately, CVD related mortality. The 
advent of new direct acting antiviral therapy has dramatically increased the 
sustained virological response rates of hepatitis C infection. In this scenario, 
the cardiovascular risk has emerged and represents a major concern after the 
eradication of the virus which may influence the life expectancy and the quality 
of patients' life.

Long-Term Exposure to Ozone and Life Expectancy in the United States, 2002 to 
2008.

Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA (YH).

Long-term exposure to ground-level ozone is associated with increased risk of 
morbidity and mortality. The association remains uncertain between long-term 
exposure to ozone and life expectancy. We assessed the associations between 
seasonal mean daily 8-hour maximum (8-hr max) ozone concentrations measured 
during the ozone monitoring seasons and life expectancy at birth in 3109 
counties of the conterminous U.S. during 2002 to 2008. We used latent class 
growth analysis to identify latent classes of counties that had distinct mean 
levels and rates of change in ozone concentrations over the 7-year period and 
used linear regression analysis to determine differences in life expectancy by 
ozone levels. We identified 3 classes of counties with distinct seasonal mean 
daily 8-hr max ozone concentrations and rates of change. When compared with the 
counties with the lowest ozone concentrations, the counties with the highest 
ozone concentrations had 1.7- and 1.4-year lower mean life expectancy in males 
and females (both P < 0.0001), respectively. The associations remained 
statistically significant after controlling for potential confounding effects of 
seasonal mean PM2.5 concentrations and other selected environmental, 
demographic, socio-economic, and health-related factors (both P < 0.0001). A 5 
ppb higher ozone concentration was associated with 0.25 year lower life 
expectancy in males (95% CI: -0.30 to -0.19) and 0.21 year in females (95% CI: 
-0.25 to -0.17). We identified 3 classes of counties with distinct mean levels 
and rates of change in ozone concentrations. Our findings suggest that long-term 
exposure to a higher ozone concentration may be associated with a lower life 
expectancy.
