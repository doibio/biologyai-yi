proportion of older persons in their populations. Unfortunately, several studies 
have shown that the same tools which have contributed to this increase cannot be 
reliably extrapolated for use in older generations. Recent work has allowed 
recalibration of existing models for use in older populations but these modified 
tools still require external validation before they can be confidently applied 
in clinical practice. Another complication is emerging evidence that aggressive 
risk factor modification in older adults, particularly more frail individuals, 
may actually be harmful. This review looks at currently available cardiovascular 
risk prediction models and the specific challenges faced with their use in older 
adults, followed by analysis of recent attempts at recalibration for this 
cohort. We discuss the issue of frailty, looking at our evolving understanding 
of its constituent features and various tools for its assessment. We also review 
work to date on the impact of frailty on cardiovascular risk modification and 
outline its potentially central role in determining the most sensible approach 
in older patients. We summarise the most promising novel markers of 
cardiovascular risk which may be of use in improving risk prediction in older 
adults in the future. These include markers of vascular compliance (such as 
aortic pulse wave velocity and pulse wave analysis), of endothelial function 
(such as flow mediated dilation, carotid intima-media thickness and coronary 
artery calcium scores), and also biochemical and circulating cellular markers.

The decision to offer radiotherapy in patients with connective tissue diseases 
continues to be challenging. Radiotherapy might trigger the onset of connective 
tissue diseases by increasing the expression of self-antigens, diminishing 
regulatory T-cell activity, and activating effectors of innate immunity 
(dendritic cells) through Toll-like receptor-dependent mechanisms, all of which 
could potentially lead to breaks of immune tolerance. This potential risk has 
raised some debate among radiation oncologists about whether patients with 
connective tissue diseases can tolerate radiation as well as people without 
connective tissue diseases. Because the number of patients with cancer and 
connective tissue diseases needing radiotherapy will probably increase due to 
improvements in medical treatment and longer life expectancy, the issue of 
interactions between radiotherapy and connective tissue diseases needs to be 
clearer. In this Review, we discuss available data and evidence for patients 
with connective tissue diseases treated with radiotherapy.

PURPOSE: To estimate health utility values, explore predictors of utility 
values, and estimate the quality-adjusted life years (Q.A.L.Y.s) gained by 
treatment in multicentric Castleman's disease (M.C.D.).
METHODS: The SF-36 was administered to 79 patients enrolled in a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national study to determine the safety 
and efficacy of siltuximab plus best supportive care (B.S.C.) compared with 
B.S.C., in subjects with symptomatic M.C.D. Utility (SF-6D) scores were derived 
from the SF-36. Sensitivity analyses using utilities obtained by mapping the 
SF-36 to the EQ-5D were also conducted. Repeated measures, mixed effects models 
were conducted to estimate effects of treatment, responder status and ≥ Grade 3 
adverse events (A.E.s) on changes in utility values over time, controlling for 
baseline utility value. Additionally, differential Q.A.L.Y. gain was assessed in 
the trial using multiple regression.
RESULTS: Patients on siltuximab and those who experienced a complete or partial 
response had higher mean utility values over time than those on placebo or those 
with stable disease. After an initial response to treatment, the mean utility 
remained relatively stable for patients on siltuximab and those who experienced 
a complete or partial response during the period when most patients were on 
study. A significantly different Q.A.L.Y. gain was found for patients on 
siltuximab (versus placebo) as calculated by SF-6D (0.070 Q.A.L.Y.s, p < .05) 
scores at 6 months (EQ-5D 0.096 Q.A.L.Y.s, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Siltuximab demonstrated improved, durable health utility gains in 
this rare disease over B.S.C. The main SF-6D results were supported by EQ-5D 
sensitivity analysis. These findings are limited by the small study sample size 
and substantial missing data caused predominantly by crossover. A longitudinal, 
multisite international observational study capturing clinical, safety and 
health-related quality of life (H.R.Q.L.) endpoints are needed to confirm these 
findings.

Sugarcane streak mosaic virus (SCSMV), an economically important causal agent of 
mosaic disease of sugarcane, is a member of the newly created genus Poacevirus 
in the family Potyviridae. In this study, we report the molecular 
characterization of three new SCSMV isolates from China (YN-YZ211 and HN-YZ49) 
and Myanmar (MYA-Formosa) and their genetic variation and phylogenetic 
relationship to SCSMV isolates from Asia and the type members of the family 
Potyviridae. The complete genome of each of the three isolates was determined to 
be 9781 nucleotides (nt) in size, excluding the 3' poly(A) tail. Phylogenetic 
analysis of the complete polyprotein amino acid (aa) sequences (3130 aa) 
revealed that all SCSMV isolates clustered into a phylogroup specific to the 
genus Poacevirus and formed two distinct clades designated as group I and group 
II. Isolates YN-YZ211, HN-YZ49 and MYA-Formosa clustered into group I, sharing 
96.8-99.5 % and 98.9-99.6 % nt (at the complete genomic level) and aa (at the 
polyprotein level) identity, respectively, among themselves and 81.2-98.8 % and 
94.0-99.6 % nt (at the complete genomic level) and aa (at the polyprotein level) 
identity, respectively, with the corresponding sequences of seven Asian SCSMV 
isolates. Population genetic analysis revealed greater between-group 
(0.190 ± 0.004) than within-group (group I = 0.025 ± 0.001 and group 
II = 0.071 ± 0.003) evolutionary divergence values, further supporting the 
results of the phylogenetic analysis. Further analysis indicated that natural 
selection might have contributed to the evolution of isolates belonging to the 
two identified SCSMV clades, with infrequent genetic exchanges occurring between 
them over time. These findings provide a comprehensive analysis of the 
population genetic structure and driving forces for the evolution of SCSMV with 
implications for global exchange of sugarcane germplasm.

We simultaneously investigated the genetic landscape of ankylosing spondylitis, 
Crohn's disease, psoriasis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative 
colitis to investigate pleiotropy and the relationship between these clinically 
related diseases. Using high-density genotype data from more than 86,000 
individuals of European ancestry, we identified 244 independent multidisease 
signals, including 27 new genome-wide significant susceptibility loci and 3 
unreported shared risk loci. Complex pleiotropy was supported when contrasting 
multidisease signals with expression data sets from human, rat and mouse 
together with epigenetic and expressed enhancer profiles. The comorbidities 
among the five immune diseases were best explained by biological pleiotropy 
rather than heterogeneity (a subgroup of cases genetically identical to those 
with another disease, possibly owing to diagnostic misclassification, molecular 
subtypes or excessive comorbidity). In particular, the strong comorbidity 
between primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease is likely 
the result of a unique disease, which is genetically distinct from classical 
inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes.

HIV infection has shifted from what was once a disease directly impacting 
short-term mortality to what is now a chronic illness controllable in the era of 
effective combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). In this setting, life 
expectancy for HIV-infected individual is nearly comparable to that of 
individuals without HIV. Subsequent to this increase in life expectancy, there 
has been recognition of increased multimorbidity among HIV-infected persons, 
with prevalence of comorbid chronic illnesses now approaching 65%. Obstructive 
lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 
asthma, are prevalent conditions associated with substantial morbidity and 
mortality in the United States. There is overlap in risk factors for HIV 
acquisition and chronic lung diseases, including lower socioeconomic status and 
the use of tobacco and illicit drugs. Objectives of this review are to (1) 
summarize the current state of knowledge regarding COPD and asthma among 
HIV-infected persons, (2) highlight implications for clinicians caring for 
patients with these combined comorbidities, and (3) identify key research 
initiatives to reduce the burden of obstructive lung diseases among HIV-infected 
persons.

Haemochromatosis is now known to be an iron-storage disease with genetic 
heterogeneity but with a final common metabolic pathway resulting in 
inappropriately low production of the hormone hepcidin. This leads to increase 
in intestinal absorption and deposition of excessive amounts of iron in 
parenchymal cells which in turn results in eventual tissue damage and organ 
failure. A clinical enigma has been the variable clinical expression with some 
patients presenting with hepatic cirrhosis at a young age and others almost 
asymptomatic for life. Research is unravelling this puzzle by identifying 
environmental factors-especially alcohol consumption-and associated modifying 
genes that modulate phenotypic expression. A high index of suspicion is required 
for early diagnosis but this can lead to presymptomatic therapy and a normal 
life expectancy. Venesection (phlebotomy) therapy remains the mainstay of 
therapy, but alternative therapies are the subject of current research.

BACKGROUND: Many guideline-eligible heart failure (HF) patients do not receive a 
survival benefit from implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Improved 
risk stratification may help to reduce costs and improve the cost effectiveness 
of ICDs.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential outcomes, costs, and cost effectiveness of 
using iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (I-mIBG) to screen HF patients 
eligible for an ICD.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to compare screening with 
I-mIBG imaging and no screening over 2-year and 10-year time horizons from a US 
payer perspective. Data on I-mIBG imaging and risk stratification were obtained 
from the ADMIRE-HF/HFX (AdreView Myocardial Imaging for Risk Evaluation in Heart 
Failure) trial. Data on ICD effectiveness for prevention of sudden cardiac death 
(SCD) were obtained from a meta-analysis. Costs of ICDs and costs of generator 
and lead procedures were obtained from the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality National Inpatient Sample. Age-specific mortality was modeled using US 
life tables and data from the ACT (Advancements in ICD Therapy) Registry on 
risks of SCD and non-SCD mortality. Sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: In the analysis, screening with I-mIBG imaging was associated with a 
reduction in ICD utilization of 21 %, resulting in a number needed to screen to 
prevent 1 ICD implantation of 5. Screening reduced the costs per patient by 
US$5500 and US$13,431 (in 2013 dollars) over 2 and 10 years, respectively, in 
comparison with no screening and resulted in losses of 0.001 and 0.040 
life-years, respectively, over 2 and 10 years. Screening was decrementally cost 
effective, with savings of US$5,248,404 and US$513,036 per quality-adjusted 
life-year lost over 2 and 10 years, respectively. In subgroup analyses, cost 
savings were greater for patients with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25-35 % than 
for those with an EF <25 %.
CONCLUSIONS: According to the model, screening of guideline-eligible patients 
selected for ICDs with I-mIBG imaging may be cost effective and may help reduce 
costs associated with implantation of ICDs, with a minimal impact on survival.

Human Tau (hTau) is a highly soluble and natively unfolded protein that binds to 
microtubules within neurons. Its dysfunction and aggregation into insoluble 
paired helical filaments is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), constituting, together with accumulated β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, a 
hallmark of the disease. Deciphering both the loss-of-function and toxic 
gain-of-function of hTau proteins is crucial to further understand the 
mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration in AD. As the fruit fly Drosophila 
melanogaster expresses Tau proteins (dTau) that are homologous to hTau, we aimed 
to better comprehend dTau functions by generating a specific tau knock-out (KO) 
fly line using homologous recombination. We observed that the specific removal 
of endogenous dTau proteins did not lead to overt, macroscopic phenotypes in 
flies. Indeed, survival, climbing ability and neuronal function were unchanged 
in tau KO flies. In addition, we did not find any overt positive or negative 
effect of dTau removal on human Aβ-induced toxicity. Altogether, our results 
indicate that the absence of dTau proteins has no major functional impact on 
flies, and suggests that our tau KO strain is a relevant model to further 
investigate the role of dTau proteins in vivo, thereby giving additional 
insights into hTau functions.

OBJECTIVE: Prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) disease is increasing worldwide. 
We aim to test correlation of T1D prevalence to the reduced natural selection 
measured by Biological State Index (Ibs).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Country-speciﬁc estimates of T1D prevalence, life 
expectancy, obesity prevalence rate, urbanization rates, per capita sugars 
consumption and per capita gross domestic product (GDP) were obtained. Ibs and 
country-specific longevity (e50) increase for each country were self-calculated. 
These data were then matched to T1D prevalence by country for our ecological 
study among 118 countries. Countries were also grouped to study the associations 
in different regions. SPSS V.22 was used for correlation analysis.
RESULTS: Worldwide, both Ibs and life expectancy at birth (Ibs proxy) were 
significantly correlated to T1D prevalence in Pearson r (r=0.713, p<0.001 and 
r=0.722, p<0.001, respectively) and Spearman's r (r=0.724, p<0.001 and r=0.689, 
p<0.001, respectively). T1D prevalence was not correlated to longevity increase 
measured as life expectancy at 50 years old. T1D prevalence was significantly 
associated with I bs (r=0.307, p<0.001) and newborn life expectancy (r=0.349, 
p<0.001) independent of per capita total sugar consumption, per capita GDP, 
urbanization and obesity prevalence in partial correlation. Globally, both life 
expectancy at birth and Ibs exponentially correlated to T1D prevalence. Pearson 
correlations generally existed in different country categorizations by 
geographic region, culture background and economic status.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced natural selection may have contributed to the increasing 
T1D prevalence worldwide. T1D epidemiology study in total population may be the 
practical solution to identify the causes of increasing T1D prevalence.

Oncology Dispensary, Simferopol, Russia.

AIM: To analyze immediate and remote results of surgical treatment of 480 
patients with gastric cancer who underwent total gastrectomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group included 371 patients who had 
spleen-preserving D2 lymphodissection during gastrectomy and control group 
consisted of 109 patients after D2 lymphodissection with splenectomy. Duration 
of surgery was 183.7±33.8 and 184.1±30.9 min in study and control groups 
respectively (p=0.72), blood loss - 330.2±33.7 and 351.8±28.8 ml (p=0.0001), 
incidence of postoperative complications - 6.7% (25 cases) and 4.6% (5 cases) 
respectively (p=0.5), mortality rate - 2.7% and 0.9% respectively (p=0.46). 
Number of excised regional lymph nodes of groups 10 and 11 was in most patients 
of the study group - 5.8 and 5.5 (p=0.92). Metastases in splenic hilus lymph 
nodes were diagnosed in 28 (7.5%) and 9 (8.2%) patients of the study and control 
groups respectively (p=0.30), metastases in lymph nodes along splenic vessels - 
in 24 (6.5%) and 7 (6.4%) patients respectively (p=0.90).
RESULTS: 5-year survival in the study group was 40.3±3.0%, average life 
expectancy - 3.4±3.3 years, in the control groups - 33.1±5.6% and 2.7±2.5 years 
respectively. It was concluded that spleen-preserving D2 lymphodissection 
decreases incidence of postoperative complications and has similar drastic 
nature as standard lymphodissection with splenectomy.

произведена спленосохранная лимфодиссекция в объеме D2, в контрольную - 109 
больных, у которых лимфодиссекция D2 предусматривала выполнение спленэктомии. 
Продолжительность хирургического вмешательства в основной группе составила 
183,7±33,8 мин, в контрольной - 184,1±30,9 мин (р=0,72), объем кровопотери - 
330,2±33,7 и 351,8±28,8 мл соответственно (р=0,0001), послеоперационные 
осложнения наблюдались у 25 (6,7%) и 5 (4,6%) больных (р=0,50), летальность 
составила 2,7 и 0,9% (р=0,46). Количество удаленных регионарных лимфоузлов 10-й 
и 11-й групп было у большего числа больных основной группы - 5,8 и 5,5 (р=0,92). 
Метастазы в лимфоузлы ворот селезенки диагностированы у 28 (7,5%) больных 
основной и у 9 (8,2%) больных контрольной группы (р=0,30), метастазы в лимфоузлы 
вдоль селезеночных сосудов - у 24 (6,5%) и 7 (6,4%) больных соответственно 
(р=0,90). Результаты. Пятилетняя выживаемость в основной группе составила 
40,3±3,0%, средняя продолжительность жизни - 3,4±3,3 года, в контрольной - 
33,1±5,6% и 2,7±2,5 года соответственно. Установлено, что спленосохранная 
лимфодиссекция D2 позволяет снизить риск развития послеоперационных осложнений и 
не уступает в радикальности стандартной лимфодиссекции, предусматривающей 
выполнение спленэктомии.

BACKGROUND: China accounted for 87% (9.8 million/11.3 million) of all hand, 
foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) cases reported to WHO during 2010-2014. 
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is responsible for most of the severe HFMD cases. Three 
EV71 vaccines recently demonstrated good efficacy in children aged 6-71 mo. Here 
we assessed the cost-effectiveness of routine pediatric EV71 vaccination in 
China.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We characterized the economic and health burden of 
EV71-associated HFMD (EV71-HFMD) in China using (i) the national surveillance 
database, (ii) virological surveillance records from all provinces, and (iii) a 
caregiver survey on the household costs and health utility loss for 1,787 
laboratory-confirmed pediatric cases. Using a static model parameterized with 
these data, we estimated the effective vaccine cost (EVC, defined as 
cost/efficacy or simply the cost of a 100% efficacious vaccine) below which 
routine pediatric vaccination would be considered cost-effective. We performed 
the base-case analysis from the societal perspective with a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of one times the gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc) and an 
annual discount rate of 3%. We performed uncertainty analysis by (i) accounting 
for the uncertainty in the risk of EV71-HFMD due to missing laboratory data in 
the national database, (ii) excluding productivity loss of parents and 
caregivers, (iii) increasing the willingness-to-pay threshold to three times 
GDPpc, (iv) increasing the discount rate to 6%, and (v) accounting for the 
proportion of EV71-HFMD cases not registered by national surveillance. In each 
of these scenarios, we performed probabilistic sensitivity analysis to account 
for parametric uncertainty in our estimates of the risk of EV71-HFMD and the 
expected costs and health utility loss due to EV71-HFMD. Routine pediatric EV71 
vaccination would be cost-saving if the all-inclusive EVC is below US$10.6 (95% 
CI US$9.7-US$11.5) and would remain cost-effective if EVC is below US$17.9 (95% 
CI US$16.9-US$18.8) in the base case, but these ceilings could be up to 66% 
higher if all the test-negative cases with missing laboratory data are 
EV71-HFMD. The EVC ceiling is (i) 10%-14% lower if productivity loss of 
parents/caregivers is excluded, (ii) 58%-84% higher if the willingness-to-pay 
threshold is increased to three times GDPpc, (iii) 14%-19% lower if the discount 
rate is increased to 6%, and (iv) 36% (95% CI 23%-50%) higher if the proportion 
of EV71-HFMD registered by national surveillance is the same as that observed in 
the three EV71 vaccine phase III trials. The validity of our results relies on 
the following assumptions: (i) self-reported hospital charges are a good proxy 
for the opportunity cost of care, (ii) the cost and health utility loss 
estimates based on laboratory-confirmed EV71-HFMD cases are representative of 
all EV71-HFMD cases, and (iii) the long-term average risk of EV71-HFMD in the 
future is similar to that registered by national surveillance during 2010-2013.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to no vaccination, routine pediatric EV71 vaccination 
would be very cost-effective in China if the cost of immunization (including all 
logistical, procurement, and administration costs needed to confer 5 y of 
vaccine protection) is below US$12.0-US$18.3, depending on the choice of vaccine 
among the three candidates. Given that the annual number of births in China has 
been around 16 million in recent years, the annual costs for routine pediatric 
EV71 vaccination at this cost range should not exceed US$192-US$293 million. Our 
results can be used to determine the optimal vaccine when the prices of the 
three vaccines are known.

Sutureless Aortic Valve: Early and Mid-Term Results at a Single Center.

Shalabi A, Raanani E, Shinfeld A, Kuperstein R, Kogan A, Lipey A, Nachum E, 
Spiegelstein D.

Background: Prolonged life expectancy has increased the number of elderly high 
risk patients referred for surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). These 
referred high risk patients may benefit from sutureless bioprosthesis procedures 
which reduce mortality and morbidity.
OBJECTIVES: To present our initial experience with sutureless aortic 
bioprotheses, including clinical and echocardiographic results, in elderly high 
risk patients referred for AVR.
METHODS: Forty patients (15 males, mean age 78 ± 7 years) with symptomatic 
severe aortic stenosis underwent AVR with the 3F Enable or Perceval sutureless 
bioprosthesis during the period December 2012 to May 2014. Mean logistic 
EuroScore was 10 ± 3%. Echocardiography was performed preoperatively, 
intraoperatively, at discharge and at follow-up.
RESULTS: There was no in-hospital mortality. Nine patients (22%) underwent 
minimally invasive AVR via a right anterior mini-thoracotomy and one patient via 
a J-incision. Four patients underwent concomitant coronary aortic bypass graft, 
two needed intraoperative repositioning of the valve, one underwent valve 
exchange due to inappropriate sizing, three (7.5%) had a perioperative stroke 
with complete resolution of neurologic symptoms, and one patient (2.5%) required 
permanent pacemaker implantation due to complete atrioventricular block. Mean 
preoperative and postoperative gradients were 44 ± 14 and 13 ± 5 mmHg, 
respectively. At follow-up, 82% of patients were in New York Heart Association 
functional class I and II.
CONCLUSIONS: Sutureless AVR can be used safely in elderly high risk patients 
with relatively low morbidity and mortality. The device can be safely implanted 
via a minimally invasive incision. Mid-term hemodynamic results are 
satisfactory, demonstrating significant clinical improvement.

[IRON OVERLOAD: BETTER UNDERSTANDING, BETTER CARE].

[Article in French]

Brissot P.

Chronic iron overload, either of genetic (hemochromatoses) or acquired 
(transfusions) origin, leads to frequent disorders, affecting both the quality 
of life and life expectancy. Major recent advances in the knowledge of iron 
metabolism, together with advances in biology, imaging and drug design have 
already significantly improved the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. These 
conceptual and technological ameliorations should, in the near future, continue 
to benefit the clinical management of iron overloaded patients.

Within the scenario of an increasing life expectancy worldwide it is mandatory 
to identify determinants of healthy aging. Centenarian offspring (CO) is one of 
the most informative model to identify trajectories of healthy aging and their 
determinants (genetic and environmental), being representative of elderly in 
their 70th whose lifestyle can be still modified to attain a better health. This 
study is the first comprehensive investigation of the health status of 267 CO 
(mean age: 70.2 years) and adopts the innovative approach of comparing CO with 
107 age-matched offspring of non-long-lived parents (hereafter indicated as NCO 
controls), recruited according to strict inclusion demographic criteria of 
Italian population. We adopted a multidimensional approach which integrates 
functional and cognitive assessment together with epidemiological and clinical 
data, including pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines, lipid 
profile, and insulin resistance. CO have a lower prevalence of stroke, cerebral 
thrombosis-hemorrhage, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and other minor 
diseases, lower BMI and waist circumference, a better functional and cognitive 
status and lower plasma level of FT4 compared to NCO controls. We conclude that 
a multidimensional approach is a reliable strategy to identify the health status 
of elderly at an age when interventions to modify their health trajectory are 
feasible.

Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a growing clinical problem which can result in 
breathlessness or respiratory failure and has an average life expectancy of 3 
years from diagnosis. Therapeutic options for PF are limited and there is 
therefore a significant unmet clinical need. The recent resurgent interest in 
macrophage biology has led to a new understanding of lung macrophage origins, 
biology, and phenotypes. In this review we discuss fibrotic mechanisms and focus 
on the role of macrophages during fibrotic lung disease. Data from both human 
and murine studies are reviewed, highlighting novel macrophage-orientated 
biomarkers for disease diagnosis and potential targets for future anti-fibrotic 
therapies.

The power of the kashrut: older but shorter. The impact of religious nutritional 
and hygienic rules on stature and life expectancy of Jewish conscripts in the 
early 19th century.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: We test the impact of several demographic, economic and 
social factors on stature in an early nineteenth century environment.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: We use a database of conscripts from the period 1818-1860 of a 
rural province in The Netherlands (Drenthe). This area had a rather high 
biological standard of living. This database of 413 conscripts contains 
information about family structure, family rank order, height, tax income, 
occupation and age of death. Conscripts came from two communities: one from a 
particular village (Oosterhesselen) and the other was Jewish conscripts that 
came from the countryside of the province.
RESULTS: Our statistical analysis shows a positive significant relationship 
between family size and height, which confirms the resource dilution theory. 
Remarkably, the sign of the relation between family size and life expectancy is 
inverse. Other factors such as the potato crisis and income had the expected 
effect on conscript heights. The community effect was strong. Jewish conscripts 
were much shorter than their counterparts. Access to nutrition, the specific 
food laws and other factors can explain this difference.
CONCLUSIONS: An increasing sibship size had a negative impact on body height but 
positive effects on life expectancy when adulthood was reached. Specifically for 
the Jewish community was the positive effect of the death of the father on 
conscript height. The mechanisms behind this phenomenon are unclear and open for 
further research.

This document of the European Society of Human Genetics contains recommendations 
regarding responsible implementation of expanded carrier screening. Carrier 
screening is defined here as the detection of carrier status of recessive 
diseases in couples or persons who do not have an a priori increased risk of 
being a carrier based on their or their partners' personal or family history. 
Expanded carrier screening offers carrier screening for multiple autosomal and 
X-linked recessive disorders, facilitated by new genetic testing technologies, 
and allows testing of individuals regardless of ancestry or geographic origin. 
Carrier screening aims to identify couples who have an increased risk of having 
an affected child in order to facilitate informed reproductive decision making. 
In previous decades, carrier screening was typically performed for one or few 
relatively common recessive disorders associated with significant morbidity, 
reduced life-expectancy and often because of a considerable higher carrier 
frequency in a specific population for certain diseases. New genetic testing 
technologies enable the expansion of screening to multiple conditions, genes or 
sequence variants. Expanded carrier screening panels that have been introduced 
to date have been advertised and offered to health care professionals and the 
public on a commercial basis. This document discusses the challenges that 
expanded carrier screening might pose in the context of the lessons learnt from 
decades of population-based carrier screening and in the context of existing 
screening criteria. It aims to contribute to the public and professional 
discussion and to arrive at better clinical and laboratory practice guidelines.

Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a life-threatening Mendelian 
disorder with a mean life expectancy of 33 years despite maximally tolerated 
standard lipid-lowering therapies. This disease is an ideal candidate for gene
