and of the governmental actions regarding environment protection, on citizens 
life, namely on their life expectancy. In order to evaluate, as accurately as 
possible, the quality of the environment we propose and elaborate upon an 
environmental sustainability index based on 17 proxies for environment issues, 
whose values reveal several similarities between some of the analyzed countries. 
Secondly, using this index and also several categories of public expenses as 
proxies for the government actions towards environment protection, we analyze 
their impact on the life expectancy of the citizens during the sample period and 
draw some specific conclusions on the actions to be taken forward by 
governments.

Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane inhibiting the entry of 
antibiotics. Porins, found within the outer membrane, are involved in regulating 
the permeability of β-lactam antibiotics. β-lactamases are enzymes that are able 
to inactivate the antibacterial properties of β-lactam antibiotics. 
Interestingly, porins and β-lactamase are found in outer membrane vesicles 
(OMVs) of β-lactam-resistant Escherichia coli and may be involved in the 
survival of susceptible strains of E. coli in the presence of antibiotics, 
through the hydrolysis of the β-lactam antibiotic. In this study, OMVs isolated 
from β-lactam-resistant E. coli and from mutants, lacking porin or β-lactamase, 
were evaluated to establish if the porins or β-lactamase in OMVs were involved 
in the degradation of β-lactam antibiotics. OMVs isolated from E. coli deficient 
in β-lactamase did not show any degradation ability against β-lactam 
antibiotics, while OMVs lacking OmpC or OmpF showed significantly lower levels 
of hydrolyzing activity than OMVs from parent E. coli. These data reveal an 
important role of OMVs in bacterial defense mechanisms demonstrating that the 
OmpC and OmpF proteins allow permeation of β-lactam antibiotics into the lumen 
of OMVs, and antibiotics that enter the OMVs can be degraded by β-lactamase.

Industrial development, along with the rapid growth of the economy, has greatly 
improved the quality of life in humans. Moreover, advancements in medical 
technology have increased life expectancy. Small particles increase airway 
inflammation when they penetrate the alveoli. We observed that GHX02 decreased 
the frequency and delayed the onset time of citric acid-induced coughing in 
guinea pigs. A phenol red secretion assay indicated that the GHX02 extract 
exhibits potent expectorant activity. The GHX02 extract also greatly reduced 
leukocyte levels. Our results indicate that GHX02 inhibits airway inflammation, 
reduces sputum production, and relieves cough. The GHX02 extract suppressed 
histamine release from mast cells resulting from compound 48/80-induced 
degranulation. The extract exhibited antimicrobial activity against 
Streptococcus pneumoniae and significantly inhibited the formation of LTC4. At 
high concentrations, the GHX02 extract suppressed the formation of PGE2 
(prostaglandin E2). Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 levels decreased with an 
increasing dosage of GHX02. Oral administration of the GHX02 extract suppressed 
PM10D-induced inflammatory symptoms in the lung, including increased alveolar 
wall thickness, accumulation of collagen fibers, and cytokine release. Treatment 
with the GHX02 extract also resulted in lower levels of inflammatory cells, in 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue. Our results indicate that GHX02 
may be a useful therapeutic agent for treatment of respiratory diseases.

BACKGROUND: Cabozantinib was approved by the European Medicines Agency and the 
Federal Drug Administration as an option for sorafenib-resistant advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma, increasing overall survival and progression-free 
survival compared with placebo. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 
cabozantinib in the second-line setting for patients with an advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma from the German statutory health insurance perspective 
compared with an US scenario using US prices.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of 
cabozantinib with best supportive care in the second-line treatment of advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma over a lifetime horizon. Health outcomes were measured 
in discounted life years and discounted quality-adjusted life years. Survival 
probabilities were estimated using parametric survival distributions based on 
CELESTIAL trial data. Utilities were derived from the literature. Costs 
contained drugs, monitoring and adverse events measured in US Dollars. Model 
robustness was addressed in univariable, scenario and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses.
RESULTS: Cabozantinib generated a gain of 0.18 life years (0.15 quality-adjusted 
life years) compared with best supportive care. The total mean cost per patient 
was $56,621 for cabozantinib and $2064 for best supportive care in the German 
model resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for cabozantinib of 
$306,778/life year and $375,470/quality-adjusted life year. Using US prices 
generated costs of $177,496 for cabozantinib and $4630 for best supportive care 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $972,049/life year and 
$1,189,706/quality-adjusted life year.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis established that assuming a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $163,371/life year (quality-adjusted life year) for the German 
model and $188,559/life year (quality-adjusted life year) for the US model, 
cabozantinib is not cost-effective compared with best supportive care. 
Sensitivity analyses showed that cabozantinib was not cost-effective in almost 
all our scenarios.

BACKGROUND: The association between dental status and mortality in 
community-dwelling older adults has been documented by several studies. The aim 
of this study was to analyze the contribution of self-assessed chewing ability, 
number of remaining teeth and serum albumin levels to mortality and the 
interactions between the three factors.
METHODS: A 20-year follow-up study was conducted with 666 subjects aged 80 years 
(from 1996 to 2017) who resided in the 8 areas served by one health center in 
Iwate Prefecture. Health check-ups including physical fitness measurements were 
conducted at a meeting place or gymnasium. Medical interview and blood sampling 
were conducted by physician. Oral examination was examined by dentist. The 
number of remaining teeth, serum albumin levels, and self-assessed chewing 
ability were used as predictors of mortality.
RESULTS: Among the 608 subjects (233 men and 375 women) included in this study, 
only 12 subjects (1.97%) survived after 20 years of follow-up. For men, dental 
status and serum levels of albumin were significantly associated with mortality. 
The hazard ratios of self-assessed chewing ability calculated by item response 
theory analysis and the inability to chew at least one food adjusted for serum 
albumin and tooth conditions were statistically significant in men. When 
adjusted by health status evaluated by blood tests, self-assessed chewing 
ability was statistically significant in men. According to path analysis, 
self-assessed chewing ability and serum albumin independently affected mortality 
in men.
CONCLUSION: Masticatory dysfunction may be an important risk factor for 
mortality in men, even though it was self-assessed. Retaining chewing ability 
might be a useful predictor of longevity in older male adults.

Actomyosin supracellular networks emerge during development and tissue repair. 
These cytoskeletal structures are able to generate large scale forces that can 
extensively remodel epithelia driving tissue buckling, closure and extension. 
How supracellular networks emerge, are controlled and mechanically work still 
remain elusive. During Drosophila oogenesis, the egg chamber elongates along the 
anterior-posterior axis. Here we show that a dorsal-ventral polarized 
supracellular F-actin network, running around the egg chamber on the basal side 
of follicle cells, emerges from polarized intercellular filopodia that radiate 
from basal stress fibers and extend penetrating neighboring cell cortexes. 
Filopodia can be mechanosensitive and function as cell-cell anchoring sites. The 
small GTPase Cdc42 governs the formation and distribution of intercellular 
filopodia and stress fibers in follicle cells. Finally, our study shows that a 
Cdc42-dependent supracellular cytoskeletal network provides a scaffold 
integrating local oscillatory actomyosin contractions at the tissue scale to 
drive global polarized forces and tissue elongation.

Disease comorbidity is a result of complex epigenetic interplay. A disease is 
rarely a consequence of an abnormality in a single gene; complex pathways to 
disease patterns emerge from gene-gene interactions and gene-environment 
interactions. Understanding these mechanisms of disease and comorbidity 
development, breaking down them into clusters and disentangling the epigenetic - 
actionable - components, is of utter importance from a public health 
perspective. With the increase in the average life expectancy, healthy aging 
becomes a primary objective, from both an individual (i.e. quality of life) and 
a societal (i.e. healthcare costs) standpoint. Many studies have analyzed 
disease networks based on common altered genes, on protein-protein interactions, 
or on shared disease comorbidites, i.e. phenotypic disease networks. In this 
work we aim at studying the relations between genotypic and phenotypic disease 
networks, using a large statewide cohort of individuals (100, 000+ from 
California, USA) with linked clinical and genotypic information, the Genetic 
Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA). By comparing their 
phenotypic and genotypic networks, we try to disentangle the epigenetic 
component of disease comorbidity.

Immunosuppressants are used clinically to lower rejection rates in transplant 
patients. Unfortunately, the adverse side effects of these immunosuppressants 
can be severe, which is one of the rationales that life expectancy of 
individuals after transplant still significantly falls short of that of the 
general population. The current experimental setup was designed to analyze the 
tacrolimus-induced hepatic iron overload in Wistar rats. Four experimental 
groups were orally given 1 ml of aqueous suspension of tacrolimus (12 mg/kg) 
through oral gavage, and rats were sacrificed after 6, 12, 24, and 48 h of 
tacrolimus dose. Hepatic hepcidin expression was found to be significantly 
augmented along with the upregulation of Tf and TfR1, Ferritin-L, Ferritin-H, 
TNF-α, and HO-1 gene expression at 6 and 12 h, and downregulation of Fpn-1, Hjv, 
and Heph at 6 h was detected. Significant downregulation of IL-6, IFN-α, IFN-β, 
and IFN-γ at all study time points was also observed. Serum iron level was 
decreased while serum hepcidin level was found to be significantly increased. 
Iron staining showed blue-stained hemosiderin granules within the hepatocytes, 
sinusoidal spaces, and portal areas at 12 and 24 h time points and remarkable 
fall of iron contents in the splenic red pulp. These results suggest that the 
use of tacrolimus leads to the onset of an intrahepatic acute-phase 
response-like reaction and causes iron overload in hepatic cells by altering the 
expression of key proteins involved in iron metabolism.

INTRODUCTION: Hysterectomy as kind of surgery in which the uterus is removed, is 
carried out in a very high number around the world. Uterus is important because 
of its impact on feminism and fertility, so the exit of this important organ can 
lead to many physical and mental disorders. These mental disorders can affect 
the quality of life of patients and ultimately lead to a reduction in the hope 
of their lives.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was cross sectional on 50 women under 
hysterectomy referred to the Semnan Amir-Al-Momenin hospital in 2017, in which 
patients were evaluated in terms of effective subsets of life expectancy that 
were determined from the angle of view of miller questionnaire, and finally the 
data were analyzed by SPSS v. 19.
RESULTS: The results showed that there is no significant difference between hope 
to life before and after hysterectomy in those who underwent hysterectomy. The 
results of our study showed that age, occupation, and education factors in 
patients who participated in this study did not have any meaningful relation 
with life expectancy after hysterectomy surgery and there was also a 
statistically significant correlation between the scores of hope for life before 
hysterectomy with the rate of education in individuals.
CONCLUSION: Hysterectomy does not affect the patients' quality of live and don't 
reduce the hope of living in people who underwent surgery.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that treatment decisions (treatment with a 
PCSK9-mAb versus no treatment) are both more effective and more cost-effective 
when based on estimated lifetime benefit than when based on estimated risk 
reduction over 10 years.
METHODS: A microsimulation model was constructed for 10,000 patients with stable 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) due 
to recurrent cardiovascular events and (non)vascular death were estimated for 
lifetime benefit-based compared to 10-year risk-based treatment, with PCSK9 
inhibition as an illustration example. Lifetime benefit in months gained and 
10-year absolute risk reduction were estimated using the SMART-REACH model, 
including an individualized treatment effect of PCSK9 inhibitors based on 
baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. For the different numbers of 
patients treated (i.e. the 5%, 10%, and 20% of patients with the highest 
estimated benefit of both strategies), cost-effectiveness was assessed using the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), indicating additional costs per 
QALY gain.
RESULTS: Lifetime benefit-based treatment of 5%, 10%, and 20% of patients with 
the highest estimated benefit resulted in an ICER of €36,440/QALY, €39,650/QALY, 
or €41,426/QALY. Ten-year risk-based treatment decisions of 5%, 10%, and 20% of 
patients with the highest estimated risk reduction resulted in an ICER of 
€48,187/QALY, €53,368/QALY, or €52,390/QALY.
CONCLUSION: Treatment decisions (treatment with a PCSK9-mAb versus no treatment) 
are both more effective and more cost-effective when based on estimated lifetime 
benefit than when based on estimated risk reduction over 10 years.

Quality of life is not affected by thyroid surgery in nontoxic benign goitre in 
long-term surveillance-A prospective observational study.

Oldenburg Pius-Hospital Oldenburg Germany.

OBJECTIVE: Quality of life (QoL) has so far seldom been taken into account by 
default in decision-making for surgical indication in thyroid surgery. 
Therefore, we compared pre- and postoperative QoL of patients using the 
EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire. The influence of certain socio-economic 
factors on QoL as a second end-point was considered.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
PATIENTS: About 153 patients with euthyroid symptomatic benign goitre after 
hemi- and total thyroidectomy (follow-up 83.6%) have been included.
MEASUREMENTS: The EQ-5D questionnaire was used prior to and 1 year after 
surgery. In addition, a questionnaire for assessment of socio-economic status 
was collected.
RESULTS: For n = 90 (n = 67 female, n = 23 male), total thyroidectomy (TT) and, 
for n = 63 (n = 45 female, n = 18 male), hemithyroidectomy (HT) were performed. 
None permanent dysfunction of the vocal cord was recorded. Transient symptomatic 
hypocalcaemia was detected in 9% of the thyroidectomy group (8/90 patients). At 
follow-up, 86% of patients showed either no change or improved QoL. About 14% of 
patients complained of deteriorated QoL, regardless of the extent of surgery. 
Socio-economic factors did not influence postoperative QoL.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that in pre-operative consultation of patients 
with benign goitre, the improvement of QoL should be taken into account for 
decision-making in cases of ambiguous surgical indication. Contrary to current 
discussions that too much thyroid surgery is performed in Germany, we can 
recommend presenting surgery as an equivalent option to watchful waiting as QoL 
is at least preserved or improved. The extension of the resection should, 
however, be decided individually.

OBJECTIVE: The optimal management of patients with ureteric obstruction in 
advanced malignancy is unclear. How quality of life is affected by a nephrostomy 
and how many of these patients undergo further oncological treatment remains 
uncertain. The objective of this retrospective multicentre study was to look at 
the outcomes of patients who had percutaneous nephrostomy insertion for 
malignancy.
METHODS: We identified patients who had a nephrostomy inserted for ureteric 
obstruction due to malignancy at our institution from January 2015 to December 
2018. We obtained data retrospectively from our electronic patient record 
system. Patients who had nephrostomy insertion for other causes such as ureteric 
calculi or injury were excluded from the study.
RESULTS: 105 patients underwent nephrostomy insertion during this time interval. 
51.42% patients (n = 54) had urological malignancies (bladder and/or prostate 
cancer). The median LOS was 14 days (range 1-104 days) post-procedure and 39.04% 
(n = 41) had at least one 30-day readmission to hospital. The average starting 
creatinine level was 348 mmol/L (range 49-1133) and the average creatinine at 
discharge was 170 mmol/L (range 44-651). Although the average change in the 
creatinine (190 mmol/L) is statistically significant (p < 0.001), it did not 
seem to prolong life of the patients. Only 26 (24.76%) patients were alive 
(all-cause mortality) at the end of the 4-year period with an average life 
expectancy of 139 days following nephrostomy. Only 30.47% (n = 32) patients 
underwent further oncological treatment.
CONCLUSION: In our series, most patients who had nephrostomy insertion for 
ureteric obstruction due to malignancy had no further oncological treatment 
following insertion. Percutaneous nephrostomy is a procedure not without 
associated morbidity and does not always prolong survival. Due to the poor 
prognosis in cases of advanced malignancy, we advocate multi-disciplinary 
decision-making prior to nephrostomy insertion.

AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a specialist smoking cessation 
package for people with severe mental illness DESIGN: Incremental 
cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken from the UK National Health Service 
and Personal Social Services perspective over a 12-month time horizon. Total 
costs, including smoking cessation, health-care and social services costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), derived from the five-level EuroQol 
5-dimension (EQ-5D-5 L), collected from a randomized controlled trial, were used 
as outcome measures. The bootstrap technique was employed to assess the 
uncertainty.
SETTING: Sixteen primary care and 21 secondary care mental health sites in 
England.
PARTICIPANTS: Adult smokers with bipolar affective disorder, schizoaffective 
disorder or schizophrenia and related illnesses (n = 526).
INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: A bespoke smoking cessation (BSC) package for 
people with severe mental illness offered up to 12 individual sessions with a 
mental health smoking cessation practitioner versus usual care (UC). Of the 
participants who were randomized, 261 were in UC group and 265 were in BSC 
group.
MEASUREMENTS: BSC intervention cost was estimated from the treatment log. Costs 
of UC, health-care and social services and EQ-5D-5 L were collected at baseline, 
6- and 12-month follow-ups. Incremental costs and incremental QLAYs were 
estimated using regression adjusting for respective baseline values and other 
baseline covariates.
FINDINGS: The mean total cost in the BSC group was £270 [95% confidence interval 
(CI) = -£1690 to £1424] lower than in the UC group, while the mean QALYs were 
0.013 (95% CI = -0.008 to 0.045) higher, leading to BSC dominating UC (76% 
probability of cost-effective at £20 000/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: A bespoke smoking cessation package for people with severe mental 
illness is likely to be cost-effective over 12 months compared with usual care 
provided by the UK's National Health Service and personal social services.

The aim of this study was to evaluate trends of potential years of life lost 
(PYLL) rates in the Slovak population and analyze the average annual percent 
change (AAPC) of PYLL rates regarding the most common causes of death between 
2004 and 2013. National mortality and demographic data were obtained from the 
Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, and 378,535 causes of death within 
the period were analyzed. The PYLL values in both genders and each disease 
category were added up across all age groups to form annual values. For the 
trend analysis, the AAPC indicator was proposed. The PYLL rate is 
age-standardized and expressed as a sum of all deaths per 100,000. In the period 
2004-2013, the highest mean PYLL rates were observed in neoplasms in the whole 
population (2,103 per 100,000), as well as in females (2,088 per 100,000), with 
a permanent high significant increase of AAPC of PYLL in both genders. The 
second highest mean PYLL rate in the ten-year period was related to circulatory 
system diseases in total (1,922 per 100,000) as well as in females (1,449 per 
100,000). In males, circulatory system diseases had the highest PYLL rate (2,397 
per 100,000). The PYLL rates trend regarding external causes of morbidity and 
mortality showed the most notable decrease in the assessed period and the AAPC 
of PYLL showed significant negative values both in males (-2.5%; p < 0.001) and 
females (-4%; p < 0.001). Our results should contribute in developing 
intervention programs aimed at reducing the burden of premature mortality since 
the main causes of premature death are associated to well-known and preventable 
risk factors.

Willingness to pay for new medicines: a step towards narrowing the gap between 
NICE and IQWiG.

BACKGROUND: The question of how to set the cost-effectiveness threshold for new, 
innovative medicines is a matter of ongoing controversy. One prominent proposal 
suggests that the cost-effectiveness threshold adopted by the U.K. National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) should represent the opportunity 
cost for the U.K. National Health Service resulting from the adoption of new 
medicines. The purpose of this article is to compare this proposal for the U.K. 
with the approach chosen by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health 
Care (IQWiG) in Germany, which relies on indication-specific cost-effectiveness 
thresholds.
MAIN TEXT: The 'ideal' NICE and IQWiG surprisingly share the fundamental 
principle of inferring the willingness to pay from existing care. For this and 
other reasons, indication-specific thresholds based on IQWiG's methodology do 
not lead to more inefficiency at the health system's level than a generic 
threshold based on the 'ideal' NICE (keeping other conditions the same). Also, 
applying either decision rule to one country will yield a similar long-term 
growth in population spending. Assuming that everything else is equal, both 
decision rules are predicted to decrease long-term expenditure growth. 
Convergence of the two decision rules would require, among others, ruling out 
waste in the 'ideal' NICE's approach and, for IQWiG's approach, using the same 
relative weights for life expectancy and health-related quality of life as the 
quality-adjusted-life-year model.
CONCLUSION: This article shows that both decision rules have notable 
commonalities in terms of inferring the willingness to pay from existing care 
and the projected impact on long-term growth in population spending.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effects of nationwide replacement of discretionary 
salt (used at table or during cooking) with potassium enriched salt substitute 
on morbidity and death from cardiovascular disease in China.
DESIGN: Modelling study.
SETTING: China.
POPULATION: Adult population in China, and specifically individuals with chronic 
kidney disease (about 17 million people).
INTERVENTIONS: Comparative risk assessment models were used to estimate the 
effects of a nationwide intervention to replace discretionary dietary salt with 
potassium enriched salt substitutes (20-30% potassium chloride). The models 
incorporated existing data and corresponding uncertainties from randomised 
trials, the China National Survey of Chronic Kidney Disease, the Global Burden 
of Disease Study, and the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Averted deaths from cardiovascular disease, non-fatal 
events, and disability adjusted life years from a reduction in blood pressure 
were estimated after implementation of potassium enriched salt substitution. In 
individuals with chronic kidney disease, additional deaths from cardiovascular 
disease related to hyperkalaemia from increased intake of potassium were 
calculated. The net effects on deaths from cardiovascular disease were estimated 
as the difference and ratio of averted and additional deaths from cardiovascular 
disease.
RESULTS: Nationwide implementation of potassium enriched salt substitution could 
prevent about 461 000 (95% uncertainty interval 196 339 to 704 438) deaths 
annually from cardiovascular disease, corresponding to 11.0% (4.7% to 16.8%) of 
annual deaths from cardiovascular disease in China; 743 000 (305 803 to 
1 273 098) non-fatal cardiovascular events annually; and 7.9 (3.3 to 12.9) 
million disability adjusted life years related to cardiovascular disease 
annually. The intervention could potentially produce an estimated 11 000 (6422 
to 16 562) additional deaths related to hyperkalaemia in individuals with 
chronic kidney disease. The net effect would be about 450 000 (183 699 to 
697 084) fewer deaths annually from cardiovascular disease in the overall 
population and 21 000 (1928 to 42 926) fewer deaths in individuals with chronic 
kidney disease. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, with changes to key model 
inputs and assumptions, net benefits were consistent in the total population and 
in individuals with chronic kidney disease, with averted deaths outweighing 
additional deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Nationwide potassium enriched salt substitution in China was 
estimated to result in a substantial net benefit, preventing around one in nine 
deaths from cardiovascular disease overall. Taking account of the risks of 
hyperkalaemia, a substantial net benefit was also estimated for individuals with 
chronic kidney disease.

INTRODUCTION: Subclavian artery injury secondary to blunt trauma is rare and 
only a few cases have been documented in the literature. Subclavian arteries are 
protected by the clavicles, ribs, and chest wall. Clinical management and 
surgical approach vary depending on the specific injury. We present the case of 
a 50 year old male with blunt right subclavian transection.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old male presented after being struck by a train. 
On exam, the patient had open injuries to the right upper chest/extremity. CTA 
showed a transection of the mid right subclavian artery along with a long 
traumatic occlusion distal to the defect. The patient was taken to the operating 
room where median sternotomy with supraclavicular extension was used to expose 
the transected ends of the subclavian artery and successfully perform a bypass 
graft. After a long hospital stay, he had a near-full functional recovery.
DISCUSSION: Blunt subclavian injury is rare and carries a high mortality. 
Adequate intervention requires prompt identification and proper surgical 
approach for repair. Median sternotomy offers the best approach to visualize the 
proximal right subclavian artery. Extension with a supraclavicular incision can 
be necessary for distal control. This approach offered timely intervention, 
which ultimately saved his life and allowed for return of pre-trauma functional 
status.
CONCLUSION: Prompt identification of subclavian artery injury is paramount as 
such injuries carry a high mortality. Median sternotomy with supraclavicular 
extension is an appropriate open surgical approach to successfully manage 
proximal right subclavian artery injuries.

Influence of Cost of Care and Adherence in Glaucoma Management: An Update.

The costs for glaucoma care are rising worldwide. The main reason is the 
increase of life expectancy and the increasing variety of diagnostic tests and 
therapeutically options by implants and devices. How can we influence the 
increase in costs? Does a relationship exist between the rising costs and the 
behavior of patients especially in regard to adherence of patients to the 
prescribed therapy? Are there ways to improve adherence? The costs of a disease 
can be estimated by adding the direct costs and the indirect costs deriving from 
the disease. Many studies have been looking at the direct costs, for example, 
the costs of diagnostic tests and treatment modalities. Unfortunately, not many 
studies investigated the indirect costs, i.e., costs related to the need of a 
person to accompany the patient during his or her outpatient visits or the costs 
deriving from loss of work capacity because of the disease itself or the 
outpatient visits. Adherence or the synonym compliance has been discussed since 
many years, and it seems that it remains a major problem in the management of 
many chronic diseases. Despite all efforts to improve adherence, the adherence 
rate in chronic diseases such as glaucoma or arterial hypertension remains 
considerably low. One of the main factors in improving adherence is raising 
patient's awareness of the disease by providing general understanding of their 
disease. Other important factors are simplified therapeutic regimens, e.g., 
fixed combination drops, sustained drug release techniques, or new glaucoma 
surgical procedures with a more favorable risk profile.

Integrated environmental analysis using life cycle assessment for different fuel 
blends used in a single-cylinder diesel engine was performed to select the most 
eco-friendly fuel blend. More specifically, the inventory data in support of the 
integrated environmental analysis of water-emulsified 5% biodiesel/diesel blends 
(B5) containing different levels of carbon nanoparticles (i.e., 38, 75, and 
150 µM) as a novel fuel nanoadditives at a fixed engine speed of 1000 rpm and 
four different engine loads (i.e., 25, 50, 75, and 100%) are presented. Neat 
diesel, B5, and B5 containing water (3 wt.%) were used as controls. Raw data 
related to the production and combustion of fuel blends were experimentally 
collected. Industrial (i.e., experiments at large scale) and laboratory (i.e., 
experiments at small scale) data were used for fuel blends production while 
experimental data obtained by engine tests were used for the combustion stage. 
Then raw data were processed with the IMPACT 2002+ methods by using the SimaPro 
software and EcoInvent database and were then converted into environmental 
impacts. Accordingly, six supplementary files including the inventory data on 
integrated environmental analysis of the different fuel blends are presented 
(Supplementary Files 1-6). The data could be applied for integrated 
environmental analysis in order to avoid subjective weighting of combustion 
parameters for selecting the most eco-friendly fuel blend for use in diesel 
engines. More specifically, by developing a single score indicator obtained 
through conducting integrated combustion analysis, comparison of various fuel 
blends is largely facilitated.

Medical advancements have extended human life expectancy, which is not always 
accompanied by an improved quality of life or healthspan. A decline in muscle 
mass and function is a consequence of ageing and can result in a loss of 
independence in elderly individuals while increasing their risk of falls. 
Multiple cellular pathways have been implicated in age-related muscle atrophy, 
including the contribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disrupted redox 
signalling. Aberrant levels of ROS disrupts the redox environment in older 
muscle, potentially disrupting cellular signalling and in some cases blunting 
the adaptive response to exercise. Age-related muscle atrophy is associated with 
disrupted mitochondrial content and function, one of the hallmarks of 
age-related diseases. There is a critical link between abnormal ROS generation 
and dysfunctional mitochondrial dynamics including mitochondrial biogenesis, 
fusion and fission. In order to develop effective treatments or preventative 
strategies, it is important to gain a comprehensive understanding of the 
mechanistic pathways implicated in age associated loss of muscle.
