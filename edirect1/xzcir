OBJECTIVES: To evaluate cost-effectiveness of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine in the routine immunization program for children younger than 5 years in 
Brazil by a postintroduction study.
METHODS: Ecological study of prevaccine (2006-2009) versus postvaccine 
(2011-2014) period related the changes in mortality rate and hospitalization 
rate to direct cost of pneumonia treatment from the payer's perspective to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness regarding lives saved, life-years gained, and 
disability-adjusted life-year for children younger than 5 years in the southern 
Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. All-cause pneumonia (ICD-10 J12-J18) deaths, 
hospital admissions, and associated costs were retrieved from the Brazilian 
Ministry of Health official Web site. Life expectancy at birth, population, 
ambulatory costs, cost savings, and plausible range of these parameters were 
used from published sources. Computer simulations with sensitivity analysis were 
performed to obtain the cost-effectiveness estimates.
RESULTS: About 27 lives were saved and 2573 hospitalizations averted by the 
10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine vaccination in the 2011 to 2014 period 
at the cost of US $24,348 per life-year gained and US $27,748 per 
disability-adjusted life-year. The latter cost is 81% of Brazilian gross 
domestic product per capita over the same period.
CONCLUSIONS: The vaccine was very cost-effective according to the World Health 
Organization criterion.

BACKGROUND: The recent surge of asylum seekers in the European Union (EU) is 
raising questions about the EU's ability to integrate newcomers into the economy 
and into society; particularly those who need specialized services for the 
treatment of severe trauma. This study investigated whether rehabilitating 
traumatised refugees represents 'value-for-money' (VfM) in terms of intervention 
cost per health gain and in a long-term and societal perspective.
METHODS: The economic evaluation comprised a cost-utility analysis (CUA) and a 
partial cost-benefit analysis (CBA). The CUA incorporated data on Quality 
Adjusted Life Years (QALY) for 45 patients who were treated at the 
Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims, Copenhagen, Denmark, in 
2001-2004 and followed for up to 2 years, to determine the incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio (ICER). For the CBA, data was collected for 44 patients who 
completed treatment between 2001 and 2004 and 44 matched controls on the waiting 
list, for the patients' primary health care utilisation, and personal and family 
labour income from 2001 to 2014. This was analysed to evaluate the Net Social 
Benefit (NSB) of the programme.
RESULTS: The average cost of treatment was found to be about 32,000 USD per 
patient (2016 prices) with an average gain in QALY of 0.82. The treatment was 
cost effective according to the ICER threshold suggested by the National 
Institute of Health and Care Excellence (UK). At the individual level, the NSB 
remained negative throughout the study period. However, at the family income 
level the intervention proved to have been beneficial after 3 years.
CONCLUSION: The implication of the study is, that providing rehabilitation to 
severely traumatised refugee families can be an economically viable strategy, 
considering the economic effects observed at the family level.

BACKGROUND: The controlled temperature chain (CTC) strategy allows vaccines to 
be kept outside the cold chain for a short period of time. In remote rural 
areas, the CTC strategy for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) birth dose vaccination 
could improve its geographical coverage and timeliness of delivery, but with 
additional outreach costs. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the CTC 
strategy for the HBV birth dose across six world regions and 72 countries 
according to their HBV prevalence, delivery costs, and birth dose coverage and 
timing.
METHODS: By use of a mathematical model of perinatal HBV transmission and 
disease progression, we calculated per 1000 births the total HBV-related 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and costs, including vaccine delivery 
costs and costs associated with HBV-related disease, with and without the CTC 
strategy.
FINDINGS: A CTC strategy produced health benefits in all regions and was 
cost-saving in the regions of east Asia and Pacific, Latin America and 
Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, and north Africa and Middle East. The CTC 
strategy cost US$0·15 (IQR -7·11 to 4·75) per DALY averted in the central and 
eastern Europe and central Asia region and $79·72 (66·47 to 94·47) in the south 
Asia region. Within individual countries, more savings were achieved and more 
DALYs averted in areas with above average HBV prevalence, below average birth 
dose coverage, or later than average birth dose delivery.
INTERPRETATION: A CTC outreach strategy that improves the timing and coverage of 
the HBV birth dose vaccination is likely to be cost-saving and reduce the burden 
of HBV infection associated with perinatal transmission.

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project provides longitudinal analysis of the 
global burden of otolaryngologic diseases by measuring the all-cause mortality, 
years of life lost, the years of life lived with disability, and 
disability-adjusted life years. Hearing loss burden is assessed overall and as 
sequelae of other diseases, such as otitis media or meningitis. Using these 
measures, we can appreciate the high prevalence and disability related to 
hearing loss globally. Other otolaryngologic diseases that contribute to the GBD 
include otitis media, cleft lip and palate, head and neck cancer, facial trauma, 
and oral disorders.

Telomerase counteracts telomere shortening and cellular senescence in germ, 
stem, and cancer cells by adding repetitive DNA sequences to the ends of 
chromosomes. Telomeres are susceptible to damage by reactive oxygen species 
(ROS), but the consequences of oxidation of telomeres on telomere length and the 
mechanisms that protect from ROS-mediated telomere damage are not well 
understood. In particular, 8-oxoguanine nucleotides at 3' ends of telomeric 
substrates inhibit telomerase in vitro, whereas, at internal positions, they 
suppress G-quadruplex formation and were therefore proposed to promote 
telomerase activity. Here, we disrupt the peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) and 
7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine triphosphatase (MTH1) genes in cancer cells and 
demonstrate that PRDX1 and MTH1 cooperate to prevent accumulation of oxidized 
guanine in the genome. Concomitant disruption of PRDX1 and MTH1 leads to ROS 
concentration-dependent continuous shortening of telomeres, which is due to 
efficient inhibition of telomere extension by telomerase. Our results identify 
antioxidant systems that are required to protect telomeres from oxidation and 
are necessary to allow telomere maintenance by telomerase conferring immortality 
to cancer cells.

Despite the high costs of hip fracture, many governments provide limited support 
for osteoporosis screening. We demonstrated that osteoporosis screening by 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with or without pre-screening by Fracture 
Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) or calcaneal ultrasound are more cost-effective than 
no screening in Chinese people aged 65 or over in Hong Kong.
INTRODUCTION: To examine the cost-effective potential osteoporosis screening 
strategies for hip fracture prevention in Hong Kong.
METHODS: Decision tree models were constructed to evaluate the cost per 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the different osteoporosis screening 
strategies followed by subsequent 5-year treatment with alendronate compared to 
no screening (but treat if a hip fracture occurs). The multiple osteoporosis 
screening strategies were composed of alternative tests and initiation age 
groups were evaluated with a 10-year horizon, and treatment were assigned if 
central dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) T-score (at either the hip or 
spine) is - 2.5 or less. Strategies included DXA for all people and 
pre-screening with the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) at specific 
thresholds or by calcaneal quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) before taking DXA 
examination. All the model inputs were based on the Mr. OS and Ms. OS Hong Kong 
cohort; data are obtained from the Social Welfare Department or the published 
literature.
RESULTS: All of the screening strategies, including the universal screening with 
DXA and the pre-screening with FRAX or QUS before DXA, were consistently more 
cost-effective than no screening for people aged 65 years old or over. One-way 
sensitivity analysis with a more optimistic assumption on treatment adherence or 
inclusion of other major osteoporotic fractures did not change the results 
materially. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed a dominant role of 
pre-screening with FRAX followed by subsequent osteoporosis drug treatment in 
people aged 70 years old or over in Hong Kong.
CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis screening strategies based on DXA with or without 
pre-screening are more cost-effective compared to no screening for Chinese 
people aged 65 or over in Hong Kong.

AIMS: As there are no published articles on country-level diabetes-related 
mortality in Romania, we aimed to investigate this aspect for the 1998-2015 
period.
METHODS: Anonymized demographic and diabetes-related mortality data (underlying 
or first secondary cause of death) were retrospectively obtained from the 
National Institute of Statistics/Eurostat microdata. Age-standardized mortality 
rates (ASMR) and their annual percentage change (APC) were analysed.
RESULTS: During 1998-2015, 4,567,899 persons died in Romania, among whom, 
diabetes was responsible for 168,854 cases. The ASMR for diabetes was 39.34 per 
100,000 person-years (p-y) (95% CI 39.32-39.35). There was an increase in ASMR 
from 27.10 per 100,000 p-y (95% CI 27.01-27.19) in women and 30.88 per 100,000 
p-y (95% CI 30.77-30.99) in men in 1998 to 35.42 per 100,000 p-y (95% CI 
35.34-35.51) in women and 48.41 per 100,000 p-y (95% CI 48.29-48.52) in men, in 
2015. The mean APC in women was 3.8% per year (95% CI 3.5-4.0, p < 0.001) during 
1998-2010 and - 1.9% per year (95% CI - 2.7 to - 1.1, p < 0.001) during 
2010-2015. The mean APC in men was 5.3% per year (95% CI 5.0-5.5, p < 0.001) 
during 1998-2010 and - 1.5% per year (95% CI - 2.2 to - 0.8, p < 0.001) during 
2010-2015. Diabetes-related mortality rates increased with age, with men 
experiencing higher mortality rates than women for most age groups and calendar 
years.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes-related mortality rates increased significantly in Romania 
during 1998-2010, followed by a steady decline during 2010-2015.

BACKGROUND: Malignancy is associated with an increased risk of venous 
thromboembolism. Inferior vena cava filters are a viable alternative when 
anticoagulation is infeasible because of the risk of bleeding. Although the 
current guidelines recommend that all patients with a vena cava filter be 
treated with anticoagulation treatment when the risk of bleeding is reduced, 
studies concerning the role of concomitant anticoagulation after vena cava 
filter insertion in high-risk patients are scarce. Since many cancer patients 
suffer from a high risk of hemorrhagic complications, we aimed to determine the 
effect of post-filter anticoagulation on mortality in patients with a malignant 
solid tumor.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with pulmonary embolism was 
performed between January 2010 and May 2016. Patients with a solid tumor and 
vena cava filter inserted because of pulmonary embolism were included. Using Cox 
proportional hazards model, the prognostic effect of clinical variables was 
analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 180 patients were analyzed, with 143 patients receiving and 
37 patients not receiving post-filter anticoagulation treatment. Mortality was 
not significantly different between the two groups. The presence of metastatic 
cancer and that of pancreatobiliary cancer were significant risk factors for 
mortality. However, post-filter anticoagulation did not show significant effect 
on mortality regardless of the stage of cancer.
CONCLUSION: In patients with cancer-associated pulmonary embolism, the effect of 
post-filter anticoagulation on mortality may not be critical, especially in 
patients with a short life expectancy.

OBJECTIVEThis study aimed to verify the effect of proactive Gamma Knife surgery 
(GKS) in the treatment of asymptomatic meningioma compared with the natural 
course without any therapeutic intervention.METHODSFrom January 2006 to May 
2017, 354 patients newly diagnosed with asymptomatic meningioma were reviewed 
and categorized into GKS (n = 153) and observation (n = 201) groups. Clinical 
and radiological progression rates were examined, and changes in volume were 
analyzed.RESULTSClinical progression (i.e., clinician-judged progression), 
combining symptomatic progression (n = 43) and clinician-judged increase in size 
using images routinely acquired (n = 34), occurred in 4 patients (2.6%) and 73 
patients (36.3%) in the GKS and observation groups, respectively (p < 0.001). 
The clinical progression-free survival (PFS) rates in the GKS and observation 
groups were 98.7% and 64.6%, respectively, at 5 years (p < 0.001), and 92.9% and 
42.7%, respectively, at 10 years (p < 0.001). The radiological tumor control 
rate was 94.1% in the GKS group, and radiological progression was noted in 141 
patients (70.1%) in the observation group. The radiological PFS rates in the GKS 
and observation groups were 94.4% and 38.5%, respectively, at 5 years (p < 
0.001), and 88.5% and 7.9%, respectively, at 10 years (p < 0.001). Young age, 
absence of calcification, peritumoral edema, and high T2 signal intensity were 
correlated with clinical progression in the observation group. Volumetric 
analysis showed that untreated tumors gradually increased in size. However, 
GKS-treated tumors shrank gradually, although transient volume expansion was 
observed in the first 6 months. Adverse events developed in 26 of the 195 
GKS-treated patients (13.3%), including 1 (0.5%) major event requiring 
microsurgery due to severe edema after GKS. Peritumoral edema was related to the 
development of adverse events (p = 0.004).CONCLUSIONSAsymptomatic meningioma is 
a benign disease; however, nearly two-thirds of patients experience tumor growth 
and one-third of untreated patients eventually require neurosurgical 
interventions during watchful waiting. GKS can control tumors clinically and 
radiologically with high probability. Although the risk of transient adverse 
events exists, proactive GKS may be a reasonable treatment option when there are 
no comorbidities limiting life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: Approximately 5%-10% of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) 
develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which affects life expectancy and 
quality of life. Arrhythmias are common among these patients, but their 
incidence and impact on outcome remains uncertain.
METHODS: All adult patients with PAH associated with CHD (PAH-CHD) seen in a 
tertiary centre between 2007 and 2015 were followed for new-onset atrial or 
ventricular arrhythmia. Clinical variables associated with arrhythmia and their 
relation to mortality were assessed using Cox analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 310 patients (mean age 34.9±12.3 years, 36.8% male) were 
enrolled. The majority had Eisenmenger syndrome (58.4%), 15.2% had a prior 
defect repair and a third had Down syndrome. At baseline, 14.2% had a prior 
history of arrhythmia, mostly supraventricular arrhythmia (86.4%). During a 
median follow-up of 6.1 years, 64 patients developed at least one new arrhythmic 
episode (incidence 3.47% per year), mostly supraventricular tachycardia or 
atrial fibrillation (78.1% of patients). Arrhythmia was associated with symptoms 
in 75.0% of cases. The type of PAH-CHD, markers of disease severity and prior 
arrhythmia were associated with arrhythmia during follow-up. Arrhythmia was a 
strong predictor of death, even after adjusting for demographic and clinical 
variables (HR 3.41, 95% CI 2.10 to 5.53, p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Arrhythmia is common in PAH-CHD and is associated with an adverse 
long-term outcome, even when managed in a specialist centre.

Pollen tubes are used as models in studies on the type of tip-growth in plants. 
They are an example of polarised and rapid growth because pollen tubes are able 
to quickly invade the flower pistil in order to accomplish fertilisation. How 
different ionic fluxes are perceived, processed or generated in the pollen tube 
is still not satisfactorily understood. In order to measure the H+, K+, Ca2+ and 
Cl- fluxes of a single pollen tube, we developed an Electrical Lab on a 
Photovoltaic-Chip (ELoPvC) on which the evolving cell was immersed in an 
electrolyte of a germination medium. Pollen from Hyacinthus orientalis L. was 
investigated ex vivo. We observed that the growing cell changed the (redox) 
potential in the medium in a periodic manner. This subtle measurement was 
feasible due to the effects that were taking place at the semiconductor-liquid 
interface. The experiment confirmed the existence of the ionic oscillations that 
accompany the periodic extension of pollen tubes, thereby providing - in a 
single run - the complete discrete frequency spectrum and phase relationships of 
the ion gradients and fluxes, while all of the metabolic and enzymatic functions 
of the cell life cycle were preserved. Furthermore, the global 1/fα 
characteristic of the power spectral density, which corresponds to the membrane 
channel noise, was found.

The objective of this study was to review available health economic evaluations 
of PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors. These drugs 
reduce low-density lipid cholesterol levels and cardiovascular risk, but their 
cost effectiveness has been questioned. We searched Medline and Embase for 
economic evaluations in any language at any time. Studies were included if they 
analysed any PCSK9 inhibitor compared with either statin alone or in combination 
with ezetimibe or any other therapy considered standard prior to the 
introduction of PCSK9 inhibitors. We found ten full health economic evaluations 
of PCSK9 inhibitors, two from Europe and eight from the United States (US). Six 
of the eight from the US were from two different consortia that analysed PCSK9 
inhibitors at different stages through the development of evidence. All studies 
generally reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios above suggested 
thresholds for cost effectiveness, except one study from Spain. The results of 
this review indicate that PCSK9 inhibitors in general are not cost effective at 
the current prices, but lower prices may change the results.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review is focused on cardiovascular risk factors in 
HIV-infected people.
RECENT FINDINGS: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly increased the 
life expectancy of HIV-infected people. Thus, this population has experienced 
non-HIV-related diseases, mainly cardiovascular diseases. Thus, in our review, 
we intend to understand the cardiovascular risk factors that trigger this 
situation. We have demonstrated that both ART and traditional cardiovascular 
risk factors contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease in 
HIV-infected people. Thus, it becomes important to stratify the risk factors to 
reduce this scenario.

OBJECTIVES: The goals of treating recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer 
are palliative, aimed at reducing symptoms and improving progression free 
survival. A prospective trial was conducted to determine the prevalence and 
severity of symptoms, and associated care needs.
METHODS: Eligible women included those with persistent or recurrent 
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer with an estimated life expectancy of at least 
6 months. The Needs at the End-of-Life Screening Tool (NEST), FACIT-Fatigue 
(FACIT-F), NCCN-FACT Ovarian Symptom Index [NFOSI-18]; Disease Related Symptoms 
(DRS), Treatment Side Effects (TSE), and Function/Well Being (F/WB) were 
collected at study entry, 3 and 6 months.
RESULTS: We enrolled 102 evaluable patients. Initiation of Do Not Resuscitate 
(DNR) discussions increased over time from 28% at study entry to 37% at 
6 months. At study entry, the most common disease-related symptoms were fatigue 
(92%), worry (89%), and trouble sleeping (76%); 73% reported being "bothered by 
treatment side effects", which included nausea (41%) and hair loss (51%) neither 
of which changed over time. The most common NEST unmet needs were in the symptom 
dimension. The social dimension was associated with F/WB (p = 0.002) and FACIT-F 
(p = 0.006); symptoms were associated with DRS (p = 0.04), TSE (p = 0.03), and 
FACIT-F (p = 0.04); existential was not associated with any of the 
patient-reported symptoms; therapeutic was associated with F/WB (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients nearing the end of life, there are significant 
associations between disease and treatment related symptoms and unmet patient 
needs, which do not change substantially over time. Careful exploration of 
specific end-of-life care needs can improve patient-centered care and QOL.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: There are marked racial and ethnic differences in non-cardia 
gastric cancer prevalence within the United States. Although gastric cancer 
screening is recommended in some regions of high prevalence, screening is not 
routinely performed in the United States. Our objective was to determine whether 
selected non-cardia gastric cancer screening for high-risk races and ethnicities 
within the United States is cost effective.
METHODS: We developed a decision analytic Markov model with the base case of a 
50-year-old person of non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or Asian 
race or ethnicity. The cost effectiveness of a no-screening strategy (current 
standard) for non-cardia gastric cancer was compared with that of 2 endoscopic 
screening modalities initiated at the time of screening colonoscopy for 
colorectal cancer: upper esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy examinations and 
continued surveillance only if intestinal metaplasia or more severe pathology is 
identified or esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy examinations continued 
every 2 years even in the absence of identified pathology. We used prevalence 
rates, transition probabilities, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
from publications and public data sources. Outcome measures were reported in 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000/QALY.
RESULTS: Compared with biennial and no screening, screening 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy with continued surveillance only when indicated was 
cost effective for non-Hispanic blacks ($80,278/QALY), Hispanics ($76,070/QALY), 
and Asians ($71,451/QALY), but not for non-Hispanic whites ($122,428/QALY). The 
model was sensitive to intestinal metaplasia prevalence, transition rates 
from intestinal metaplasia to dysplasia to local and regional cancer, cost of 
endoscopy, and cost of resection (endoscopic or surgical).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on a decision analytic Markov model, endoscopic non-cardia 
gastric cancer screening for high-risk races and ethnicities could be cost 
effective in the United States.

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has recently provided invaluable experimental 
data about the full-length cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR) 3D structure. However, this experimental information deals with inactive 
states of the channel, either in an apo, quiescent conformation, in which 
nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) are widely separated or in an ATP-bound, yet 
closed conformation. Here, we show that 3D structure models of the open and 
closed forms of the channel, now further supported by metadynamics simulations 
and by comparison with the cryo-EM data, could be used to gain some insights 
into critical features of the conformational transition toward active CFTR 
forms. These critical elements lie within membrane-spanning domains but also 
within NBD1 and the N-terminal extension, in which conformational plasticity is 
predicted to occur to help the interaction with filamin, one of the CFTR 
cellular partners.

Enzyme-Free Replication with Two or Four Bases.

Hänle E(1), Richert C(1).

Germany.

All known forms of life encode their genetic information in a sequence of bases 
of a genetic polymer and produce copies through replication. How this process 
started before polymerase enzymes had evolved is unclear. Enzyme-free copying of 
short stretches of DNA or RNA has been demonstrated using activated nucleotides, 
but not replication. We have developed a method for enzyme-free replication. It 
involves extension with reversible termination, enzyme-free ligation, and strand 
capture. We monitored nucleotide incorporation for a full helical turn of DNA, 
during both a first and a second round of copying, by using mass spectrometry. 
With all four bases (A/C/G/T), an "error catastrophe" occurred, with the correct 
sequence being "overwhelmed" by incorrect ones. When only C and G were used, 
approximately half of the daughter strands had the mass of the correct sequence 
after 20 copying steps. We conclude that enzyme-free replication is more likely 
to be successful with just the two strongly pairing bases than with all four 
bases of the genetic alphabet.

OBJECTIVES: Constipation is a common complaint in older adults. The rise in life 
expectancy may amplify the problem and increase social expenditure. We 
investigated the major risk factors associated with constipation in a large 
sample of elderly.
METHODS: Outpatients from Northern Sardinia attending a Geriatric Unit between 
2001 and 2014 were enrolled. Demographic and anthropometric data, income, 
education and self-reported bowel function were collected. The presence of 
constipation was adjusted for cognitive status, assessed by the Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) test; single and cumulative illness rating scale 
(CIRS); current or past symptomatic depression and anxiety measured by the 
Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS); nutritional status, evaluated using the 
Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA); type and number of different medications 
used.
RESULTS: 1328 elderly patients (mean age 77.7 ± 7.2 years) were enrolled. 
Constipation was present in 32.1%, more commonly in women (35.4% vs 28.3%) and 
increased with age. The multivariate analysis showed a significantly greater 
risk of constipation in patients with a risk of malnutrition (OR = 1.745, 95% 
CI: 1.043-2.022; p = .034), female gender (OR = 1.735, 95% CI: 1.068-2.820; 
p = .026) and depression (OR = 1.079, 95% CI: 1.022-1.140; p = .006). Other 
potential predisposing factors assessed such as MMSE, CIRS, body mass index, 
marital status, smoking habit, education, income and number of taken drugs did 
not show a statistically significant association. Aging was a risk for 
constipation also in patients free of medications.
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of risk factors associated with bowel alterations in 
elderly individuals may provide important clues for caregivers to prevent or 
reduce constipation.

In the United States, approximately 17,500 cases of traumatic spinal cord injury 
(SCI) occur each year, with an estimated 245,000 to 345,000 individuals living 
with chronic SCI. Acute management of respiratory dysfunction has resulted in 
improvement in early survival, but life expectancy remains less than that of the 
general population, and pulmonary complications are a leading cause of 
mortality. The global changes in pulmonary function, underlying pathophysiology, 
and the management options to improve respiratory muscle weakness and pulmonary 
clearance in persons with SCI are discussed. Given its high prevalence among 
subjects with cervical SCI, sleep disordered breathing is also discussed.

Greater life expectancy with advancements in technology and medicine has led to 
an increasing interest in facial rejuvenation. Facial aging is an inevitable 
process that largely results from soft tissue descent and volumetric deflation. 
However, a comprehensive knowledge of the aging process and precise assessment 
of the exact pathologies yielding the patient's senescent appearance is 
essential to produce the best cosmetic outcome. The surgeon must evaluate each 
region independently and the aging face as a whole to ensure a pleasing, natural 
appearance.

The number of Americans over the age of 65 has been growing much faster than the 
overall population's growth rate. These changes can be largely attributed to the 
improvement in life expectancy. This demographic shift yields a unique and 
exciting opportunity to provide both expedient and cost-efficient care to a 
growing patient population.
