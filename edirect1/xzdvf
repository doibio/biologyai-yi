BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, neurodegenerative 
disease that can lead to significant functional disability. Improving treatment 
regimens have extended life expectancy and led to an increase in the number of 
elective spine surgeries for degenerative conditions in the MS population. 
Recent literature has reported mixed results regarding the efficacy of elective 
spine surgery for patients with MS. There is also a paucity of literature 
comparing postoperative patient reported outcomes (PROs) and reoperation rates 
between patients with and without MS.
PURPOSE: To determine if patients with MS have worse PROs and higher 
complication, readmission and reoperation rates after elective spine surgery 
compared with patients without neurodegenerative conditions when adjusting for 
baseline covariates through propensity matching.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective review of prospectively collected data from 
the Quality Outcomes Database (QOD), a national, longitudinal, multicenter spine 
outcomes registry.
PATIENT SAMPLE: For the lumbar cohort, 312 patients with MS and 46,738 patients 
without MS were included. The cervical myelopathy cohort included 91 patients 
with MS and 6,426 patients without MS. The cervical radiculopathy cohort 
consisted of 103 patients with MS and 13,751 patients without MS.
OUTCOME MEASURES: 1) complication rates, 2) readmission rates, 3) reoperation 
rates, and 4) PROs at 3- and 12-months including ODI/NDI, NRS back/neck/arm/leg 
pain, mJOA scores and patient satisfaction ratings.
METHODS: Data from the QOD was queried for patients with surgeries occurring 
between 04/2013-01/2019. Three surgical groups were included: 1) Elective lumbar 
surgery, 2) Elective cervical surgery for myelopathy, 3) Elective cervical 
surgery for radiculopathy. Patients with any neurodegenerative condition other 
than MS were excluded. Patients without MS were propensity matched against 
patients with MS in a 5 to 1 ratio without replacement based on ASA grade, 
arthrodesis, surgical approach, number of operated levels, age, and baseline 
ODI/NDI, NRS leg/arm pain, NRS back/neck pain, and EQ-5D. Multivariable 
regressions with cluster-robust standard errors were used to estimate average 
effect of how the outcome would change if the MS patient didn't have the 
disease. The mean difference was used for continuous outcomes and the risk 
difference was used for binary outcomes.
RESULTS: For the lumbar cohort, no differences were found between the 2 groups 
at 3 or 12 months in any of the outcome measures. For the myelopathy cohort, 
patients with MS patients had a lower rate of reoperation at 12 months (risk 
difference=-0.036, p=.007) and worse 3-month mJOA scores (mean 
difference=-1.044, p=.004) compared with patients without MS. For the 
radiculopathy cohort, patients with MS had a lower rate of reoperation at 3 
months (risk difference=-0.019, p=.018) and 12 months (risk difference=-0.029, 
p=.007) compared with those without MS.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS had similar PROs compared with patients without MS 
when adjusting for baseline covariates through propensity matching, except for 
3-month mJOA scores in the myelopathy cohort. Reoperation rates were found to be 
lower in patients with MS undergoing elective cervical surgery for both 
myelopathy and radiculopathy. These results suggest that when analyzed 
independently, a diagnosis of MS does not significantly impact complication, 
readmission and reoperation rates or PROs, and therefore should not represent a 
major contraindication to elective spine surgery. Surgical decisions in this 
patient population should be made based on careful consideration of patient 
factors including other comorbidities as well as baseline patient functional 
status.

Aiming to accommodate the unmet need for easily accessible biomarkers with a 
focus on biological differences between haematological diseases, the diagnostic 
value of plasma proteins in acute leukaemias and lymphomas was investigated. A 
multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA) was used to analyze 183 proteins in 
diagnostic plasma samples from 251 acute leukaemia and lymphoma patients and 
compared with samples from 60 healthy controls. Multivariate modelling using 
partial least square discriminant analysis revealed highly significant 
differences between distinct disease subgroups and controls. The model allowed 
explicit distinction between leukaemia and lymphoma, with few patients 
misclassified. Acute leukaemia samples had higher levels of proteins associated 
with haemostasis, inflammation, cell differentiation and cell-matrix 
integration, whereas lymphoma samples demonstrated higher levels of proteins 
known to be associated with tumour microenvironment and lymphoma dissemination. 
PEA technology can be used to screen for large number of plasma protein 
biomarkers in low µL sample volumes, enabling the distinction between controls, 
acute leukaemias and lymphomas. Plasma protein profiling could help gain 
insights into the pathophysiology of acute leukaemia and lymphoma and the 
technique may be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of these diseases.

The quest of defeating cancer and improving prognosis in survivors has generated 
remarkable strides forward in research and have advanced the development of new 
antineoplastic therapies. These achievements, combined with rapid screening and 
early detection, have considerably extended the life expectancy of patients 
surviving multiple types of malignancies. Consequently, chemotherapy-related 
toxicity in several organ systems, especially the cardiovascular system, has 
surfaced as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among cancer 
survivors. Recent evidence classifies chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity as the 
second-leading cause of morbidity and mortality, closely comparing with 
secondary cancer malignancies. While a certain degree of cardiotoxicity has been 
reported to accompany most chemotherapies, including anthracyclines, 
anti-metabolites, and alkylating agents, even the latest targeted cancer 
therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
have been associated with acute and chronic cardiac sequelae. In this chapter, 
we focus on describing the principal mechanism(s) for each class of 
chemotherapeutic agents that lead to cardiotoxicity and the innovative 
translational research approaches that are currently being explored to prevent 
or treat cancer therapy-induced cardiotoxicity and related cardiac 
complications.

Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are heterogeneous neurological disorders 
characterized by a progressive loss of selected neuronal populations. A 
significant risk factor for most NDs is aging. Considering the constant increase 
in life expectancy, NDs represent a global public health burden. Axonal 
transport (AT) is a central cellular process underlying the generation and 
maintenance of neuronal architecture and connectivity. Deficits in AT appear to 
be a common thread for most, if not all, NDs. Neuroinflammation has been 
notoriously difficult to define in relation to NDs. Inflammation is a complex 
multifactorial process in the CNS, which varies depending on the disease stage. 
Several lines of evidence suggest that AT defect, axonopathy and 
neuroinflammation are tightly interlaced. However, whether these impairments 
play a causative role in NDs or are merely a downstream effect of neuronal 
degeneration remains unsettled. We still lack reliable information on the 
temporal relationship between these pathogenic mechanisms, although several 
findings suggest that they may occur early during ND pathophysiology. This 
article will review the latest evidence emerging on whether the interplay 
between AT perturbations and some aspects of CNS inflammation can participate in 
ND etiology, analyze their potential as therapeutic targets, and the urge to 
identify early surrogate biomarkers.

BACKGROUND: Drug use disorders (DUDs) have been a public health crisis which 
strongly impacted community health and socio-economic development. However, 
there are few studies based on the latest global data to show changes in the 
disease burden due to DUDs, specifically investigating associations between the 
country-level socio-economic factors and the burden of DUDs.
METHODS: Data of DUDs were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 
2019 database to explore the trends of the disease burden due to DUDs from 1990 
to 2019. Univariate linear regression and stepwise multiple linear regression 
analysis were performed to analyze the correlations between burden due to DUDs 
and country-level socio-economic factors.
RESULTS: Globally, the number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused 
by DUDs approximately increased by 2.6% yearly from 1990 to 2019, though the 
age-standardized DALY rate has not changed significantly in the past 30 years. 
The age-standardized DALY rate of opioid use disorders showed an upward trend 
during the past 30 years and was highest among 5 types of DUDs in 2019. 
Inequality-adjusted human development index (β = 15.9, 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 12.9-18.9, P < 0.001) was identified as the key risk factor associated 
with square-root transformed age-standardized DALY rate of DUDs.
CONCLUSIONS: Global burden due to DUDs has increased significantly over the past 
30 years. More effective targeted public health policies should be formulated to 
manage the public health challenge of DUDs, especially in developed countries 
and territories.

BACKGROUND: Multiple stakeholders have advocated for minimum volume standards 
for complex surgical procedures. The Leapfrog Group recommends that patients 
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receive surgical resection at hospitals 
that perform at least 40 lung resections annually. However, the 
cost-effectiveness of this paradigm is unknown.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed on 90-day and 5-year 
horizons for patients with clinical stage I NSCLC undergoing surgical resection 
at hospitals stratified by Leapfrog standard. Model inputs were derived from 
either the literature or a propensity score-matched cohort using the National 
Cancer Database. For the 5-year horizon, we simulated using a Markov model with 
1-year cycle. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to 
evaluate cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: For the 90-day horizon, resection at a Leapfrog hospital was more 
costly ($25 567 vs $25 530) but had greater utility (0.185 vs 0.181 
quality-adjusted life-years), resulting in an ICER of 10 506. Similarly, for the 
5-year horizon, resection at a Leapfrog hospital was more costly ($26 600 vs 
$26 495) but more effective (3.216 vs 3.122 quality-adjusted life-years), 
resulting in an ICER of 1108. When the costs for long-distance travel, lodging, 
and loss of productivity for caregivers were factored in, the ICER was 20 499 
during the 5-year horizon for resection at Leapfrog hospitals. Using a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000, resection at a Leapfrog hospital 
remained cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Receiving surgery for clinical stage I NSCLC at hospitals that meet 
Leapfrog volume standards is cost-effective. Payers and policymakers should 
consider supporting patient and caregiver travel to higher volume institutions 
for lung cancer surgery.

OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization declared the global SARS-CoV-2 
infection a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The objective of this paper is to 
present its impact in terms of physical and mental health 22 months later.
METHOD: We have reviewed results from published meta-analysis and systematic 
reviews, and some individual articles on specific aspects of special interest. 
National information on infection comes for the Red Nacional de Vigilancia 
Epidemiológica (RENAVE).
RESULTS: Up to the end of October, more than 250 million infections and 5 
million deaths had been reported globally. In Spain, 4.7 million infections have 
been documented although the real figure might be above 7 million. The pandemic 
has reduced life expectancy, and its effects have been especially dramatic in 
people with comorbidities and the elderly. There is a worsening of mental health 
in the general population. It is foreseeable that some groups, such as health 
professionals, mostly women, and front-line workers, may have a greater risk of 
developing mental health pathologies. The pandemic and the control measures have 
had other undesirable consequences such as a decrease in healthcare utilization, 
an increase in sedentary lifestyle or an increase in gender violence. In 
addition to its immediate effect on morbidity and mortality, the control 
measures have damaged the overall health status of the global population.
CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal studies are necessary to determine the mid and long 
consequences of the pandemic and the control measures, and to identify and 
evaluate effective health interventions.

OBJETIVO: Presentar, a los 22 meses de que la Organización Mundial de la Salud 
declarara como pandemia la infección global por SARS-CoV-2 el 11 de marzo de 
2020, el impacto hasta el momento de la pandemia en términos de salud física y 
mental.
MÉTODO: Se han revisado resultados procedentes de metaanálisis y revisiones 
sistemáticas, citándose para algún aspecto específico de interés artículos 
individuales. La información nacional procede de la Red Nacional de Vigilancia 
Epidemiológica (RENAVE).
RESULTADOS: Hasta finales de octubre se habían producido más de 250 millones de 
infecciones y 5 millones de muertes. En España se han notificado 4,7 millones de 
infecciones, aunque la cifra real es superior a los 7 millones. Se ha reducido 
la esperanza de vida, con efectos especialmente dramáticos en grupos de 
población con comorbilidad y de edad avanzada. Se constata un empeoramiento de 
la salud mental general. Es previsible que algunos colectivos, como los/las 
profesionales sanitarios/as, en su mayoría mujeres, y trabajadores/as de primera 
línea, tengan un mayor riesgo de desarrollar patologías de salud mental en el 
futuro. La pandemia y las medidas de control han tenido otras consecuencias 
indeseables, como la disminución de la actividad asistencial, el aumento del 
sedentarismo y el aumento de la violencia de género.
CONCLUSIONES: Son necesarios estudios longitudinales para determinar la magnitud 
de las consecuencias de la propia infección y de las medidas de control y las 
actuaciones necesarias.

OBJECTIVE: In 2022, the KEYNOTE-775 (NCT03517449) study showed that 
pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib (PL) has more benefits than traditional 
chemotherapy as a first-line regimen to treat patients with mismatch 
repair-proficient (pMMR) advanced endometrial cancer (aEC). However, given the 
high cost of immuno-targeted therapy, the widespread use among patients remains 
uncertain. Therefore, we conducted a cost-effectiveness comparison between PL 
and chemotherapy.
METHODS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PL versus chemotherapy over 7 
years by developing a comprehensive Markov model, included 697 patients, that 
calculated total cost, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
threshold of $150,000 per QALY. The robustness of the model was evaluated by 
one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In addition, we also 
performed subgroup analyses.
RESULTS: Chemotherapy yielded a mean survival of 0.705 QALYs (0.901 LYs) per 
patient and was associated with a mean cost of $163,777. PL was associated with 
an incremental cost of $38,582 and an additional 0.349 QALYs, leading to an ICER 
of $110,401 per QALY as compared to chemotherapy. The cost of pembrolizumab had 
a significant impact on ICER. At the assumed WTP threshold of $150,000 per QALY, 
approximately 79.2% of simulations show cost-effectiveness occurs in PL. Results 
of the subgroup analysis showed that PL was the most cost-effective regimen for 
patients who had previously received 1-line of therapy.
CONCLUSION: For patients with pMMR aEC, the PL strategy may be the most 
cost-effective strategy at a WTP of $150,000 from the economic perspective of 
the United States.

Fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, possesses eight hexose transporters, 
Ght1~8. In order to clarify the role of each hexose transporter on glucose 
uptake, a glucose uptake assay system was established and the actual glucose 
uptake activity of each hexose transporter-deletion mutant was measured. Under 
normal growth condition containing 2% glucose, ∆ght5 and ∆ght2 mutants showed 
large and small decrease in glucose uptake activity, respectively. On the other 
hand, the other deletion mutants did not show any decrease in glucose uptake 
activity indicating that, in the presence of Ght5 and Ght2, the other hexose 
transporters do not play a significant role in glucose uptake. To understand the 
relevance between glucose uptake and lifespan regulation, we measured the 
chronological lifespan of each hexose transporter deletion mutant, and found 
that only ∆ght5 mutant showed a significant lifespan extension. Based on these 
results we showed that Ght5 is mainly involved in the glucose uptake in 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and suggested that the ∆ght5 mutant has prolonged 
lifespan due to physiological changes similar to calorie restriction.

BACKGROUND: Extra-articular distal radius fractures are often treated by 
circular casting. A functional brace, however, may equally support the fracture 
zone but allows early mobilization of the radiocarpal joint. Since the amount of 
fracture movement for different types of fixation is currently unknown, a study 
was initiated to investigate the degree of bone displacement in extra-articular 
distal radius fractures fixated by regular circular casting, functional bracing, 
or no-fixation.
METHODS: In four cadaveric arms, an extra-articular distal radius fracture was 
simulated and immobilized by the three ways of fixation. After creating an 
extra-articular distal radius fracture, the fracture was reduced anatomically 
and the cadaveric arm was strapped in a test frame. Hereafter, flexion, 
extension and deviation of the hand were then induced by a static moment of 
force of one newton meter. Subsequently CT scans of the wrist were performed and 
bone displacement was quantified.
RESULTS: Immobilization of an extra-articular distal radius fracture by 
functional bracing provides comparable fixation compared to circular casting and 
no fixation, and shows significantly less extension-rotation displacement of the 
distal bone segment for the wrist in flexion and palmodorsal translation and 
extension-rotation for the wrist in extension.
CONCLUSION: Functional bracing of extra articular distal radius fractures in 
cadaveric arms provides significant less extension-rotation displacement in 
flexion and palmodorsal translation and extension-rotation in extension compared 
to circular casting and no fixation.

BACKGROUND: Recent research has shown that chitosan has good moisture-absorbing 
properties at the micro and nanoscale, and seems to be a good candidate for the 
production of biodegradable moisture-absorbing films.
AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the properties and antibacterial 
activity of starch-based microchitosan (MCH) films impregnated with two 
essential oils (EOs).
METHODS: MCH films with varying thicknesses were made from cornstarch (6%), 
microchitosan (1%), glycerol (2.25%), and/or EOs (2%), and their 
characteristics, including swelling degree (SD), tensile strength (TS), and 
elongation at break (EB%), were examined. The film structures were confirmed by 
X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force 
microscopy (AFM). To determine the antibacterial activity against Escherichia 
coli and Staphylococcus aureus, two EOs of Shirazi thyme, garlic, and a mixture 
of them were used in the experimentation.
RESULTS: The EB% and TS had a linear relationship with the thickness of samples 
and improved by increasing the thickness of films. The XRD pattern showed that 
the MCH films had an amorphous structure. SEM of the films showed a homogeneous 
dispersion of MCH in the starch matrix without any porosity. The AFM images 
showed a simultaneous increase in the thickness of the MCH films and surface 
roughness. The film was able to absorb water up to 15.78 times its weight in 48 
h. The inhibition zone of films containing 2% thyme EO was 42.0 mm for S. aureus 
and 12.3 mm for E. coli (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: MCH film containing Shirazi thyme can be described as a 
moisture-absorbing antibacterial pad and is a new idea for active food packaging 
to increase the shelf life of foods with fully degradable properties.

Human lifespan and life expectancy have increased worldwide, but the number of 
years that we spend free of chronic or debilitating disorders, known as 
healthspan, has not shifted along with increased lifespan. This unfavourable 
trend presents a tremendous global social-economical problem. We propose a model 
of promoting optimal human health with proactive, holistic interventions across 
the lifespan, which require multi-disciplinary, innovative approaches to 
research and care. We contend that this is the only hope that we have to face 
the challenges of population growth and aging, as well as the upward trend in 
non-communicable disease prevalence.

The use of available treatments for Fabry disease (FD) (including enzyme 
replacement therapy [ERT]) may be restricted by their limited symptom 
improvement and mode of administration. Lucerastat is currently being 
investigated in the MODIFY study as oral substrate reduction therapy for the 
treatment of FD. By reducing the net globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) load in 
tissues, lucerastat has disease-modifying potential to improve symptoms and 
delay disease progression. MODIFY is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 3 study (ClinicalTrial.gov: 
NCT03425539); here we present the rationale and design of this study. Eligible 
adults with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of FD and FD-specific neuropathic 
pain entered screening. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either oral 
lucerastat twice daily or placebo for 6 months; treatment allocation was 
stratified according to sex and ERT treatment status. The main objectives of 
MODIFY are to assess the effects of lucerastat on neuropathic pain, 
gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, FD biomarkers, and determine its safety and 
tolerability. Neuropathic pain and GI symptoms are key features of FD that have 
a significant impact on quality of life. Despite various tools available to 
assess pain and GI symptoms, there are currently limited tools available to 
assess neuropathic and GI symptoms in FD, validated according to health 
authority guidelines. Based on FDA recommendations, we undertook a 
patient-reported outcome (PRO) validation study, using a novel eDiary-based PRO 
tool to assess the validity of evaluating neuropathic pain as a primary efficacy 
endpoint in MODIFY. Results from the PRO validation study are included. To date, 
MODIFY is the largest Phase 3 clinical study conducted in patients with FD. 
Enrollment to MODIFY is now complete, with 118 patients randomized. Results will 
be presented in a separate publication. Long-term effects of lucerastat are 
being assessed in the ongoing open-label extension study (NCT03737214).

High intensity resistance training (HI-RT) is a treatment option for Knee 
Osteoarthritis (KOA). Isotonic machines (leg press, leg extension) are utilized 
for standardization and reproducibility reasons, but the load used during the 
protocol is often low, considering that elder people usually have low strength 
levels, training so with high intensities calculated on low loads. The 
physiological response of an elder woman trained with high loads on a free 
weight exercise, the regular barbell deadlift, with a 1 Repetition Maximum (1RM) 
of 100 kg, can be appreciated in this report, so that for the first time we can 
see the effect of a one year of high intensity resistance training program on a 
powerlifting exercise on a 72 year-old woman with KOA. A Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire was administered 
before starting the training program (T0) and after 1 year of training, as long 
as a control RX, to evaluate the effect of HI-RT on joint functionality and 
quality of life.

Understanding Differences in Health Care Spending: A Comparative Study of Prices 
and Volumes Across OECD Countries.

Variations across OECD countries in the prices of health care and hospital 
services can be vast. These price differences mean that comparisons of such 
services should be adjusted to reflect the 'real' volumes consumed. Purchasing 
power parities (PPPs) can be used to make such comparisons more accurately, 
going beyond simple GDP-based comparisons, by aggregating the prices of actual 
individual consumption of health items. These health and hospital PPPs 
demonstrate that GDP PPPs are a weak substitute, as price structures vary 
widely. Moreover, there is tentative evidence that higher relative prices for 
health care tend to bloat health expenditure and are associated with lower life 
expectancy.

Case Report: Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) and Candida 
auris Fungemia in Post-acute COVID-19 Syndrome: A Clinical Challenge.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes a 
disease (COVID-19) with multisystem involvement. The world is now entering a 
phase of post-COVID-19 manifestations in this pandemic. Secondary hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory event 
triggered by viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Both Multisystem 
Inflammatory Syndrome-Adults (MIS-A) and Cytokine Storm Syndrome (CSS) are 
considered close differentials of sHLH and add to the spectrum of Post-acute 
COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). In this report, we presented the case of a middle-aged 
Asian man who was initially discharged upon recovery from severe COVID-19 
infection after 17 days of hospitalization to a private institute and later came 
to our hospital 13 days post-discharge. Here, he was diagnosed with sHLH, 
occurring as an extension of CSS, with delayed presentation falling within the 
spectrum of PACS. The diagnosis of sHLH was made holistically with the HLH-2004 
criteria. Our patient initially responded to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 
and dexamethasone, later complicated by disseminated Candida auris infection and 
had a fatal outcome. Though many cases of HLH during active COVID-19 and a few 
cases post COVID-19 recovery have been reported, based on H-score, which has 
limitations as a diagnostic tool. We report the first case report of 
post-COVID-19 sHLH using the HLH-2004 criteria, complicated by disseminated 
Candidemia, emphasizing that the care of patients with COVID-19 does not 
conclude at the time of hospital discharge. We highlight the importance of 
surveillance in the post-COVID phase for early detection of sHLH which may 
predispose to fatal opportunistic infections (OIs).

Isolated brachial muscle injuries are relatively rare injuries and reportedly 
occur during forced elbow extension. Though commonly conservative treatment 
approach is adopted, the treatment criteria remain unclear. Here, we report the 
case of a patient who experienced functional recovery after conservative 
treatment for an isolated brachial muscle injury. The patient was an 8-year-old 
boy whose chief complaint was left elbow pain. The injury occurred when the 
patient fell while playing on gymnastics bars and bruised the palmar side of his 
left elbow on the bar. Owing to the pain in the left elbow, the patient came to 
our institution. There were no clear signs of deformities or swelling in the 
left elbow and no obvious tenderness. X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging 
examinations revealed no signs of a fracture or dislocation, and the patient was 
diagnosed with left brachialis muscle rupture based on magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). Although the brachialis muscle was complete ruptured, a healing 
tendency was seen on body surface ultrasound examinations over time, and the 
patient was treated conservatively. After 3 weeks of cast immobilization, the 
patient underwent range of motion exercises. Two months after the injury, there 
were no issues with elbow joint function in daily life activities and no 
limitations in range of motion. Here, MRI was used to diagnose brachialis muscle 
rupture, and ultrasound examinations were utilized to make treatment decisions.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Life expectancy (LE) is a hypothetical measure to predict 
life longevity and the indicator of society's overall health. Tooth loss is a 
worldwide enigma; however, the LE for tooth (LET) are obscure. LET and the 
burden of tooth loss in Taiwan were estimated using the scheme of National 
Health Insurance (NHI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using NHI data, mortality rate, age-specific mortality 
rate, tooth-extraction rate, and age-specific tooth-extraction rate (ASTER) of 
Taiwanese in 2004 and 2013 were estimated. ASTER for the individual tooth 
(ASTER-T) was analyzed for each of 28 permanent teeth according to ID code and 
tooth location. LET and years lived with disability for tooth loss (YLDs-T) of 
each permanent tooth were estimated following Global Burden Disease study.
RESULTS: In 2004, 1,741,228 teeth extracted from 1,078,254 patients among 
22,646,835 Taiwanese, whereas 2,012,907 teeth extracted from 1,254,746 patients 
among 23,344,670 in 2013. In both years, the ASTERs presented an increasing 
trend as age increased. However, the ASTER-Ts presented varied according to 
tooth types. The LET and YLDs-T were also varied. The maximum values of YLDs-T 
were noticed for the first molars.
CONCLUSION: Our findings of this national survey highlight the need for public 
health policy, particular the early loss of first molars, aiming to increase 
awareness regarding oral health.

INTRODUCTION: As an important pathogen causing diarrheal diseases, the burden 
and change in the death rate of norovirus-associated diseases (NADs) globally 
are still unknown.
METHODS: Based on global disease burden data from 1990 to 2019, we analyzed the 
age-standardized death rate (ASDR) of NADs by age, region, country, and 
Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) level. The discrete Poisson model was applied in 
the analysis of NADs' spatiotemporal aggregation, the Joinpoint regression model 
to analyze the trend of death burden of NADs over 30 years, and a generalized 
linear model to identify the risk factors for the death rate from NADs.
RESULTS: The ASDR of NADs significantly decreased by a factor of approximately 
2.7 times, from 5.02 (95% CI: 1.1, 11.34) in 1990 to 1.86 (95% CI: 0.36, 4.16) 
in 2019 [average annual percent change (AAPC) = -3.43, 95% CI: -3.56, -3.29]. 
The death burden of NADs in 2019 was still highest in African regions despite a 
great decline in recent decades. However, the ASDR in high SDI countries 
presented an uptrend [0.12 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.26) in 1990 and 0.24 (95% CI: 0.03, 
0.53) in 2019, AAPC = 2.52, 95% CI: 2.02-3.03], mainly observed in the elderly 
over 70 years old. Compared to children under 5 years old, the 2019 death rate 
of elderly individuals over 80 years old was much higher in high SDI countries. 
The generalized linear model showed that factors of the number of physicians (RR 
= 0.67), the proportions of children under 14 years old (RR = 1.21), elderly 
individuals over 65 years old (RR = 1.13), educational level (RR = 1.03) and 
urbanization proportion (RR = 1.01) influenced the ASDR of NADs.
CONCLUSIONS: The death burden of NADs has remained high in developing regions 
over the last three decades and has increased among the elderly in countries 
with high SDI levels, even though the global trend in NAD-associated deaths has 
decreased significantly in the past three decades. More effective public health 
policies against NADs need to be implemented in high SDI regions and for the 
elderly.

OBJECTIVES: Occupational exposure to carcinogens is associated with trachea, 
bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer. The objective of this study was to provide 
global and regional estimates of the burden of TBL cancer associated with 
occupational carcinogens (OCs) between 1990 and 2019.
METHODS: Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) and age-standardized 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates (ASDR) of TBL cancer related to 
exposure to OCs at the global and regional levels were extracted for 1990-2019 
from the Global Burden of Disease 2019. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze 
trends in the ASMR and ASDR of TBL cancer burden related to OCs, and the annual 
percent change and the average annual percent change (AAPC) were recorded.
RESULTS: The mortality from TBL cancer related to exposure to OCs increased 
globally. The ASMR and ASDR decreased in both sexes and in men between 1990 and 
2019. The AAPC of ASMR and ASDR decreased in men between 1990 and 2019, but 
increased in women. Asbestos accounted for the highest death number and 
beryllium accounted for the lowest; diesel engine exhaust caused the largest 
percentage change in death number (145.3%), in ASDR (14.9%), and in all ages 
DALY rates (57.6%). Asbestos accounted for the largest death number in high 
social development index (SDI) countries, whereas low-middle SDI countries had 
the largest percent change (321.4%). Asbestos was associated with decreased ASDR 
in high SDI countries and increased ASDR in low-middle SDI countries, and 
similar changes were observed for other OCs.
