20.9% patients had ≥2 18F-FDG PET/CT exams in any single year. Thirty nine 
percent patients in the cohort were below 60 years age. The median dose for 
18F-FDG PET/CT examination was 25.1 mSv and maximum value reaching 1.7 to 2.9 
times the median value. Cumulative effective dose (CED) was≥100 mSv in 12-13% of 
the patients. The cumulative dose for both years combined demonstrated the 25th 
percentile, 50th percentile and 75th percentile as well as the mean to be over 
100 mSv, with the 25th percentile being 109 mSv. The dominant primary 
malignancies contributing to serial 18F-FDG PET/CTs in decreasing frequency were 
melanoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), gastrointestinal cancer, breast cancer 
and Hodgkin's lymphoma.
CONCLUSIONS: A sizeable number of patients undergo≥2 18F-FDG PET/CT exams with 
one out of every eight patients receiving cumulative dose≥100 mSv and that 
includes patients with long-life expectancy.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The study found that one of five patients had≥2 18F-FDG 
PET/CT exams in a calendar year, one of four patients in two years and one of 
eight patients received cumulative dose≥100 mSv. Top malignancies associated 
with serial imaging in decreasing order of frequency included melanoma, 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), gastrointestinal cancer, breast cancer and 
Hodgkin's lymphoma.

In response to high-salt conditions, haloarchaea export most secretory proteins 
through the Tat pathway in folded states; however, it is unclear why some 
haloarchaeal proteins are still routed to the Sec pathway. SptE is an 
extracellular subtilase of Natrinema sp. strain J7-2. Here, we found that SptE 
precursor comprises a Sec signal peptide, an N-terminal propeptide, a catalytic 
domain, and a long C-terminal extension (CTE) containing seven domains (C1 to 
C7). SptE is produced extracellularly as a mature form (M180) in strain J7-2 and 
a proform (ΔS) in the ΔsptA mutant strain, indicating that halolysin SptA 
mediates the conversion of the secreted proform into M180. The proper folding of 
ΔS is more efficient in the presence of NaCl than KCl. ΔS requires SptA for 
cleavage of the N-terminal propeptide and C-terminal C6 and C7 domains to 
generate M180, accompanied by the appearance of autoprocessing product M120 
lacking C5. At lower salinities or elevated temperatures, M180 and M120 could be 
autoprocessed into M90, which comprises the catalytic and C1 domains and has a 
higher activity than M180. When produced in Haloferax volcanii, SptE could be 
secreted as a properly folded proform, but its variant (TSptE) with a Tat signal 
peptide does not fold properly and suffers from severe proteolysis 
extracellularly; meanwhile, TSptE is more inclined to aggregate intracellularly 
than SptE. Systematic domain deletion analysis reveals that the long CTE is an 
important determinant for secretion of SptE via the Sec rather than Tat pathway 
to prevent enzyme aggregation before secretion. IMPORTANCE While Tat-dependent 
haloarchaeal subtilases (halolysins) have been extensively studied, the 
information about Sec-dependent subtilases of haloarchaea is limited. Our 
results demonstrate that proper maturation of Sec-dependent subtilase SptE of 
Natrinema sp. strain J7-2 depends on the action of halolysin SptA from the same 
strain, yielding multiple hetero- and autocatalytic mature forms. Moreover, we 
found that the different extra- and intracellular salt types (NaCl versus KCl) 
of haloarchaea and the long CTE are extrinsic and intrinsic factors crucial for 
routing SptE to the Sec rather than Tat pathway. This study provides new clues 
about the secretion and adaptation mechanisms of Sec substrates in haloarchaea.

This study estimated the efficiency of implementing the EmERGE Pathway of Care 
for people living with medically stable HIV in Brighton, UK; an App enables 
individuals to communicate with caregivers via their smart-phone. Individual 
data on the use of HIV outpatient services were collected one-year pre- and 
post-implementation of EmERGE. Unit costs of HIV outpatient services were 
calculated and linked with mean use of services per patient year. Primary 
outcomes were CD4 count and viral load; patient activation and quality-of-life 
measures were secondary outcomes. 565 participants were followed up April 2017 - 
October 2018: 93% men, mean age at recruitment 47.0 years (95%CI:46.2-47.8). 
Outpatient visits decreased by 9% from 5.6 (95%CI:5.4-5.8) to 5.1 
(95%CI:4.9-5.3). Face-to-face visits decreased and virtual visits increased. 
Annual costs decreased by 9% from £751 (95%CI: £722-£780) to £678 (95%CI: 
£653-£705). Including anti-retroviral drugs, total annual cost decreased from 
£7,343 (95%CI: £7,314-7,372) to £7,270 (95%CI: £7,245-7,297): ARVs costs 
comprised 90%. EmERGE was a cost-saving intervention, patients remained engaged 
and clinically stable. Annual costs were reduced, but ARVs continue to dominate 
costs. Extension of EmERGE to other people with chronic conditions, could 
produce greater efficiencies but these needs to be evaluated and monitored over 
time.

Phylogenomic analyses were performed on the nine species of the genus 
Meiothermus and four species of the genus Calidithermus. Phylogenetic analysis, 
low values of genomic relatedness indices and functional diversity analysis 
indicated that Meiothermus silvanus should not be classified within the clades 
for Meiothermus and Calidithermus but instead be reclassified as a new genus, 
for which we propose the name Allomeiothermus gen. nov., with Allomeiothermus 
silvanus comb. nov. as type species. In addition, the species Meiothermus 
cateniformans Zhang et al. (Int J Syst Evol Microbial 60:840-844, 2010) should 
also be reclassified as a later heterotypic synonym of Meiothermus taiwanensis 
Chen et al. (Int J Syst Evol Microbiol 52:1647-1654, 2002) emend. Raposo et al. 
(2019). This reclassification is based on the high genomic relatedness indices 
(98.8% ANI; 90.2% dDDH; 99% AAI) that are above the threshold values necessary 
for defining a new species, as well as on the observation of overlapping 
functions on Principal Coordinate Analysis plot generated from Clusters of 
Orthologous Genes.

Update in
    Elife. 2022 Oct 27;11:

Phage Immunoprecipitation-Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) allows for unbiased, 
proteome-wide autoantibody discovery across a variety of disease settings, with 
identification of disease-specific autoantigens providing new insight into 
previously poorly understood forms of immune dysregulation. Despite several 
successful implementations of PhIP-Seq for autoantigen discovery, including our 
previous work (Vazquez et al. 2020), current protocols are inherently difficult 
to scale to accommodate large cohorts of cases and importantly, healthy 
controls. Here, we develop and validate a high throughput extension of PhIP-seq 
in various etiologies of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including APS1, 
IPEX, RAG1/2 deficiency, Kawasaki Disease (KD), Multisystem Inflammatory 
Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), and finally, mild and severe forms of COVID19. We 
demonstrate that these scaled datasets enable machine-learning approaches that 
result in robust prediction of disease status, as well as the ability to detect 
both known and novel autoantigens, such as PDYN in APS1 patients, and 
intestinally expressed proteins BEST4 and BTNL8 in IPEX patients. Remarkably, 
BEST4 antibodies were also found in 2 patients with RAG1/2 deficiency, one of 
whom had very early onset IBD. Scaled PhIP-Seq examination of both MIS-C and KD 
demonstrated rare, overlapping antigens, including CGNL1, as well as several 
strongly enriched putative pneumonia-associated antigens in severe COVID19, 
including the endosomal protein EEA1. Together, scaled PhIP-Seq provides a 
valuable tool for broadly assessing both rare and common autoantigen overlap 
between autoimmune diseases of varying origins and etiologies.

Dental implants represent an illustrative example of successful medical devices 
used in increasing numbers to aid (partly) edentulous patients. Particularly in 
spite of the percutaneous nature of dental implant systems, their clinical 
success is remarkable. This clinical success is at least partly related to the 
effective surface treatment of the artificial dental root, providing appropriate 
physicochemical properties to achieve osseointegration. The demographic changes 
in the world, however, with a rapidly increasing life expectancy and an increase 
in patients suffering from comorbidities that affect wound healing and bone 
metabolism, make that the performance of dental implants requires continuous 
improvement. An additional factor endangering the clinical success of dental 
implants is peri-implantitis, which affects both the soft and hard tissue 
interactions with dental implants. In this study, we shed light on the 
optimization of dental implant surfaces through surface engineering. Depending 
on the region along the artificial dental root, different properties of the 
surface are required to optimize prevailing tissue response to facilitate 
osseointegration, improve soft tissue attachment, and exert antibacterial 
efficacy. As such, surface engineering represents an important tool for assuring 
the continued future success of dental implants. Impact Statement Dental 
implants represent a common treatment modality nowadays for the replacement of 
lost teeth or fixation of prosthetic devices. This review provides a detailed 
overview of the role of surface engineering for dental implants and their 
components to optimize tissue responses at the different regions along the 
artificial dental root. The surface properties steering immunomodulatory 
processes, facilitating osseointegration, and rendering antibacterial efficacy 
(at both artificial root and abutment region) are described. The review finally 
concludes that surface engineering provides a tool to warrant that dental 
implants will remain future proof in more challenging applications, including an 
aging patient population and comorbidities that affect bone metabolism and wound 
healing.

Introduction: Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis is an increasing reason for liver 
transplantation in the western world. Knowledge of recipient life expectancy may 
assist in prudent allocation of a relatively scarce supply of donor livers. 
Research Questions: We calculated life expectancies for Non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) patients both at time of transplant and one year later, 
stratified by key risk factors, and examined whether survival has improved in 
recent years. Design: Data on 6635 NASH patients who underwent liver 
transplantation in the MELD era (2002-2018) from the United States OPTN database 
were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model and life table 
methods. Results: Factors related to survival were age, presence of diabetes or 
hepatic encephalopathy (HE), and whether the patient required dialysis in the 
week prior to transplant. Other important factors were whether the patient was 
working, hospitalization prior to transplant, ventilator support, and length of 
hospital stay (LOS). Survival improved over the study period at roughly 4.5% per 
calendar year during the first year posttransplant, though no improvement was 
observed in those who had survived one year. Conclusion: Life expectancy in NASH 
transplant patients was much reduced from normal, and varied according to age, 
medical factors, status at transplant, and post transplant course. Over the 
17-year study period, patient survival improved markedly during the first year 
posttransplant, though not thereafter. The results given here may prove helpful 
in medical decision-making regarding treatment for both liver disease and other 
medical conditions, as they provide both clinicians and their patients with 
evidence-based information on prognosis.

Economic evaluation of a JAK inhibitor compared to a monoclonal antibody for 
treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis from a UK perspective.

AIM: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder 
characterized by severe itching, erythema and scaling, causing pain, 
stigmatization and social isolation. Despite the growing availability of 
treatment options, unmet care needs remain. This research aimed to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of a novel JAK inhibitor (JAKi) compared to a monoclonal 
antibody and to identify key drivers of cost-effectiveness.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A de novo economic model was developed to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of a novel JAKi compared to an established monoclonal 
antibody for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD patients from a UK 
perspective. A targeted literature review was conducted to inform the 
development of the economic model with an advanced model structure. Various 
scenario and sensitivity analyses were performed to account for parameter- and 
structural uncertainty and to identify key drivers of cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: The JAKi was not cost-effective compared to the monoclonal antibody 
(£219,733.88 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained) at selected price 
levels when applying the UK willingness-to-pay threshold of £30,000 per QALY 
gained. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness were utility values, intervention 
efficacy and drug acquisition costs. A decrease in JAKi's dose costs, as well as 
a lower dose, lead to cost-effectiveness.
LIMITATIONS: Assumptions regarding parameter inputs were necessary, therefore a 
considerable level of uncertainty regarding efficacy and cost data is to be 
accounted for in the interpretation of the results. In particular, the efficacy 
data were based on single clinical studies.
CONCLUSIONS: This research revealed the cost-effectiveness of a JAKi compared to 
a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD to be highly 
sensitive to the costs and effectiveness inputs and identified further 
cost-effectiveness drivers. It demonstrated that the JAKi could be 
cost-effective compared to an established monoclonal antibody with a lower dose 
or a reduced price.

Immortal time bias for life-long conditions in retrospective observational 
studies using electronic health records.

Leicester, Leicester, UK.

BACKGROUND: Immortal time bias is common in observational studies but is 
typically described for pharmacoepidemiology studies where there is a delay 
between cohort entry and treatment initiation.
METHODS: This study used the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and 
linked national mortality data in England from 2000 to 2019 to investigate 
immortal time bias for a specific life-long condition, intellectual disability. 
Life expectancy (Chiang's abridged life table approach) was compared for 33,867 
exposed and 980,586 unexposed individuals aged 10+ years using five methods: (1) 
treating immortal time as observation time; (2) excluding time before date of 
first exposure diagnosis; (3) matching cohort entry to first exposure diagnosis; 
(4) excluding time before proxy date of inputting first exposure diagnosis (by 
the physician); and (5) treating exposure as a time-dependent measure.
RESULTS: When not considered in the design or analysis (Method 1), immortal time 
bias led to disproportionately high life expectancy for the exposed population 
during the first calendar period (additional years expected to live: 2000-2004: 
65.6 [95% CI: 63.6,67.6]) compared to the later calendar periods (2005-2009: 
59.9 [58.8,60.9]; 2010-2014: 58.0 [57.1,58.9]; 2015-2019: 58.2 [56.8,59.7]). 
Date of entry of diagnosis (Method 4) was unreliable in this CPRD cohort. The 
final methods (Method 2, 3 and 5) appeared to solve the main theoretical problem 
but residual bias may have remained.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that immortal time bias is a significant issue for 
studies of life-long conditions that use electronic health record data and 
requires careful consideration of how clinical diagnoses are entered onto

OBJECTIVE: Summarize the current evidence on efficacy and tolerability of vagus 
nerve stimulation (VNS), responsive neurostimulation (RNS), and deep brain 
stimulation (DBS) through a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and 
Meta-Analyses reporting standards and searched Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, and 
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We included published 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and their corresponding open-label extension 
studies, as well as prospective case series, with ≥20 participants (excluding 
studies limited to children). Our primary outcome was the mean (or median, when 
unavailable) percentage decrease in frequency, as compared to baseline, of all 
epileptic seizures at last follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the proportion 
of treatment responders and proportion with seizure freedom.
RESULTS: We identified 30 eligible studies, six of which were RCTs. At long-term 
follow-up (mean 1.3 years), five observational studies for VNS reported a pooled 
mean percentage decrease in seizure frequency of 34.7% (95% confidence interval 
[CI]: -5.1, 74.5). In the open-label extension studies for RNS, the median 
seizure reduction was 53%, 66%, and 75% at 2, 5, and 9 years of follow-up, 
respectively. For DBS, the median reduction was 56%, 65%, and 75% at 2, 5, and 7 
years, respectively. The proportion of individuals with seizure freedom at last 
follow-up increased significantly over time for DBS and RNS, whereas a positive 
trend was observed for VNS. Quality of life was improved in all modalities. The 
most common complications included hoarseness, and cough and throat pain for VNS 
and implant site pain, headache, and dysesthesia for DBS and RNS.
SIGNIFICANCE: Neurostimulation modalities are an effective treatment option for 
drug-resistant epilepsy, with improving outcomes over time and few major 
complications. Seizure-reduction rates among the three therapies were similar 
during the initial blinded phase. Recent long-term follow-up studies are 
encouraging for RNS and DBS but are lacking for VNS.

Oligonucleotides are increasingly being used as a programmable connection 
material to assemble molecules and proteins in well-defined structures. For the 
application of such assemblies for in vivo diagnostics or therapeutics it is 
crucial that the oligonucleotides form highly stable, non-toxic, and 
non-immunogenic structures. Only few oligonucleotide derivatives fulfil all of 
these requirements. Here we report on the application of acyclic l-threoninol 
nucleic acid (aTNA) to form a four-way junction (4WJ) that is highly stable and 
enables facile assembly of components for in vivo treatment and imaging. The 
aTNA 4WJ is serum-stable, shows no non-targeted uptake or cytotoxicity, and 
invokes no innate immune response. As a proof of concept, we modify the 4WJ with 
a cancer-targeting and a serum half-life extension moiety and show the effect of 
these functionalized 4WJs in vitro and in vivo, respectively.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is prevalent and costly; cost-effective 
nonpharmacological approaches that reduce pain and improve patient functioning 
are needed.
OBJECTIVE: Report the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), compared with 
usual care, of cognitive behavioral therapy aimed at improving functioning and 
pain among patients with chronic pain on long-term opioid treatment.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation conducted alongside a pragmatic cluster randomized 
trial.
SUBJECTS: Adults with chronic pain on long-term opioid treatment (N=814).
INTERVENTION: A cognitive behavioral therapy intervention teaching pain 
self-management skills in 12 weekly, 90-minute groups delivered by an 
interdisciplinary team (behaviorists, nurses) with additional support from 
physical therapists, and pharmacists.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and cost 
per additional responder (≥30% improvement on standard scale assessment of Pain, 
Enjoyment, General Activity, and Sleep). Costs were estimated as-delivered, and 
replication.
RESULTS: Per patient intervention replication costs were $2145 ($2574 
as-delivered). Those costs were completely offset by lower medical care costs; 
inclusive of the intervention, total medical care over follow-up was $1841 lower 
for intervention patients. Intervention group patients also had greater QALY and 
responder gains than did controls. Supplemental analyses using pain-related 
medical care costs revealed ICERs of $35,000, and $53,000 per QALY (for 
replication, and as-delivered intervention costs, respectively); the ICER when 
excluding patients with outlier follow-up costs was $106,000.
LIMITATIONS: Limited to 1-year follow-up; identification of pain-related 
utilization potentially incomplete.
CONCLUSION: The intervention was the optimal choice at commonly accepted levels 
of willingness-to-pay for QALY gains; this finding was robust to sensitivity 
analyses.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between frailty and medication-related 
harm requiring healthcare utilisation.
DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study.
SETTING: Six primary and five secondary care sites across South East England, 
September 2013-November 2015.
PARTICIPANTS: One thousand and two hundred and eighty participants, ≥65 years 
old, who were due for discharge from general medicine and older persons' wards 
following an acute episode of care. Exclusion criteria were limited life 
expectancy, transfer to another hospital and consent not gained.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Medication-related harm requiring healthcare utilisation 
(including primary, secondary or tertiary care consultations related to MRH), 
including adverse drug reactions, non-adherence and medication error determined 
via the review of data from three sources: patient/carer reports gathered 
through a structured telephone interview; primary care medical record review; 
and prospective consultant-led review of readmission to recruiting hospital. 
Frailty was measured using a Frailty Index, developed using a standardised 
approach. Marginal estimates were obtained from logistic regression models to 
examine how probabilities of healthcare service use due to medication-related 
harm were associated with increasing number of medicines and frailty.
RESULTS: Healthcare utilisation due to medication-related harm was significantly 
associated with frailty (OR = 10.06, 95% CI 2.06-49.26, P = 0.004), independent 
of age, gender, and number of medicines. With increasing frailty, the need for 
healthcare use as a result of MRH increases from a probability of around 
0.2-0.4. This is also the case for the number of medicines.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is associated with MRH, independent of polypharmacy. 
Reducing the burden of frailty through an integrated health and social care 
approach, alongside strategies to reduce inappropriate polypharmacy, may reduce 
MRH related healthcare utilisation.

IMPORTANCE: Premature mortality has been observed among people with mental 
disorders. Comorbid general medical conditions contribute substantially to this 
reduction in life expectancy.
OBJECTIVE: To provide an analysis of mortality associated with comorbidity 
between a broad range of mental disorders and general medical conditions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study of 5 946 800 
individuals born in Denmark from 1900 to 2015 and residing in the country at the 
start of follow-up (January 1, 2000, or their date of birth, whichever occurred 
later).
EXPOSURES: Danish health registers were used to identify people with mental 
disorders and general medical conditions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Considering pairs of mental disorders and general 
medical conditions, we calculated mortality rate ratios (MRRs) and differences 
in life expectancy (ie, life-years lost) to assess the association of mortality 
with both disorders of interest compared with the mental disorder of interest, 
the general medical condition of interest, and neither disorder of interest.
RESULTS: The study population comprised 2 961 397 males and 2 985 403 females, 
with a median (IQR) age of 32.0 years (7.3-52.9) at start of follow-up and 48.9 
years (42.5-68.8) at the end. Based on all pairs of comorbid mental disorders 
and general medical conditions, the mean MRR compared with people without these 
conditions was 5.90 (median, 4.94; IQR, 3.80-7.30), and the mean reduction of 
life expectancy compared with the general population was 11.35 years (median, 
11.08; range, 5.27-23.53; IQR, 8.22-13.72). The association with general medical 
condition comorbidity in those with mental disorders varied by general medical 
condition; for example, the addition of a neurological condition for each of the 
mental disorders was associated with a mean MRR of 1.22, whereas for cancer, the 
mean MRR for all mental disorders was 4.07.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, shorter life expectancy was associated 
with comorbid mental disorders and general medical conditions compared with the 
entire population and also when compared with patients who had either mental 
disorders only or general medical conditions only. Prevention and early 
detection of comorbidities could reduce premature mortality in patients with 
mental disorders.

The echinostomatid Drepanocephalus spathans (syn. Drepanocephalus auritus) 
parasitizes the double-crested cormorant Phalacrocorax auritus. In North 
America, the marsh rams-horn snail Planorbella trivolvis and ghost rams-horn 
snail Biomphalaria havanensis serve as snail intermediate hosts, both of which 
inhabit catfish aquaculture ponds in the southeastern United States. Studies 
have demonstrated D. spathans exposure can be lethal to juvenile channel catfish 
Ictalurus punctatus. Two studies were undertaken to elucidate the life cycle of 
D. spathans to establish a developmental time line. In both studies, D. spathans 
cercariae collected from naturally infected P. trivolvis individuals were used 
to infect channel catfish fingerlings, which were then fed to double-crested 
cormorants (DCCOs) that had been pharmaceutically dewormed. In study 1, 
laboratory-reared P. trivolvis and B. havanensis individuals were placed in 
aviary ponds with experimentally infected DCCO and examined bi-weekly for 
release of cercariae. Trematode eggs were observed in the feces of exposed birds 
3 days post-infection. Birds were sacrificed 18 days post-exposure (dpe), and 
gravid adults morphologically and molecularly consistent with D. spathans were 
recovered. Snails from the aviary pond were observed shedding D. spathans 
cercariae 18-54 dpe. In study 2, trematode eggs were observed in the feces of 
exposed DCCOs beginning 8 dpe. Once eggs were observed, birds were allowed to 
defecate into clean tanks containing naïve laboratory-reared P. trivolvis 
individuals. Additionally, eggs from experimental DCCO feces were recovered by 
sedimentation and placed in an aquarium housing laboratory-reared P. trivolvis 
individuals. Birds in study 2 were sacrificed after 60 days, and gravid D. 
spathans specimens were recovered. Snails from the experimental DCCO tanks shed 
D. spathans cercariae 89-97 dpe. Lastly, trematode eggs were isolated and 
observed for the hatching of miracidia, which emerged on average after 16 days 
at ambient temperatures. No D. spathans adults were observed in control birds 
fed non-parasitized fish. This is the first experimental confirmation of the D. 
spathans life cycle, resolving previously unknown developmental time lines. In 
addition, the effects of fixation on adult trematode morphology were assessed, 
clarifying reports of pronounced morphological plasticity for D. spathans.

Topical Cannabadiol in Pain Management: A Call for Formal Clinical Evaluation.

Salamone JD.

As a medical specialty, pain management is characterized by numerous safety and 
efficacy issues and many unmet needs. A report by Allied Market Research 
estimated the 2019 global market for pain relief at $71 billion, with a 
projected growth rate of nearly 4% per year1 through 2027. The segment of this 
market most relevant to this discussion, topical pain relief, comprised almost 
13% of this market, with a value of $8.9 billion. Higher life expectancy, an 
aging population and a more comprehensive understanding of pain management are 
the principal drivers of market growth.

Highly active antiretroviral therapy currently used for HIV/AIDS has 
significantly increased the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals. It has 
also improved the quality of life, reduced mortality, and decreased the 
incidence of AIDS and HIV-related conditions. Currently, however, affected 
individuals are typically on a lifetime course of several therapeutic drugs, all 
with the potential for associated toxicity and emergence of resistance. This 
calls for development of novel, potent, and broad anti-HIV agents able to stop 
the spread of HIV/AIDS. Significant progress has been made toward identification 
of anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). However, antibody-based 
drugs are costly to produce and store. Administration (by injection only) and 
other obstacles limit clinical use. In recent years, several highly promising 
small-molecule HIV-1 entry inhibitors targeting the epitopes of bNAbs have been 
developed. These newly developed compounds are the focus of the present article.

BACKGROUND: Frequent truncation mutations of the histone lysine 
N-methyltransferase KMT2C have been detected by whole exome sequencing studies 
in various cancers, including malignancies of the prostate. However, the 
biological consequences of these alterations in prostate cancer have not yet 
been elucidated.
METHODS: To investigate the functional effects of these mutations, we deleted 
the C-terminal catalytic core motif of Kmt2c specifically in mouse prostate 
epithelium. We analysed the effect of Kmt2c SET domain deletion in a 
Pten-deficient PCa mouse model in vivo and of truncation mutations of KMT2C in a 
large number of prostate cancer patients.
RESULTS: We show here for the first time that impaired KMT2C methyltransferase 
activity drives proliferation and PIN formation and, when combined with loss of 
the tumour suppressor PTEN, triggers loss of senescence, metastatic 
dissemination and dramatically reduces life expectancy. In Kmt2c-mutated tumours 
we show enrichment of proliferative MYC gene signatures and loss of expression 
of the cell cycle repressor p16INK4A. In addition, we observe a striking 
reduction in disease-free survival of patients with KMT2C-mutated prostate 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified truncating events of KMT2C as drivers of 
proliferation and PIN formation. Loss of PTEN and KMT2C in prostate cancer 
results in loss of senescence, metastatic dissemination and reduced life 
expectancy. Our data demonstrate the prognostic significance of KMT2C mutation 
status in prostate cancer patients. Inhibition of the MYC signalling axis may be 
a viable treatment option for patients with KMT2C truncations and therefore poor 
prognosis.
