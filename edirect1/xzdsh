The aim of this study was to analyze the cardiac autonomic function at rest, at 
maximum exercise, and in recovery after exercise and to determine sex-specific 
and age-specific values for resting heart rate (RHR), hear rate (HR)-peak, HR 
recovery (HRR), and HR variability at rest in master runners. Fifty endurance 
runners (21 women) participated in this study (43.28 ± 5.25 years). The subjects 
came from different athletic clubs in Andalusia (Spain), and the testing 
protocol was performed in-season. A 3-km running test was performed and the 
cardiovascular response was monitored. Regarding sex, no significant differences 
were found regarding cardiovascular autonomic function at rest, during exercise, 
and following maximal exercise, only at rest, the standard deviation of all R-R 
intervals and low frequency values displayed significantly (p < 0.05) lower 
scores in women. 46% of athletes showed an RHR < 60 bpm. Additionally, HR-peak 
showed a significant correlation with age (r = −0.369; p = 0.009) and HRR5min (r 
= 0.476, p = 0.001). Also, endurance performance was inversely associated with 
obesity traits and cardiometabolic risk factors. In summary, age, sex, fitness, 
or anthropometrics characteristics did not show a relevant influence on 
cardiovascular autonomic modulation in master runners. However, the 3-km 
performance displayed a significant negative association with several factors of 
cardiometabolic risk.

Whether the COVID-19 pandemic may have modified the clinical planning and course 
in bronchiectasis patients remains to be fully elucidated. We hypothesized that 
the COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced the management and clinical outcomes 
of bronchiectasis patients who were followed up for 12 months. In bronchiectasis 
patients (n = 30, 23 females, 66 years), lung function testing, disease severity 
[FEV1, age, colonization, radiological extension, dyspnea (FACED), exacerbation 
(EFACED)] and dyspnea scores, exacerbation numbers and hospitalizations, body 
composition, sputum microbiology, and blood analytical biomarkers were 
determined at baseline and after a one-year follow-up. Compared to baseline (n = 
27, three patients dropped out), in bronchiectasis patients, a significant 
increase in FACED and EFACED scores, number of exacerbations, and erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR) was observed, while FEV1, ceruloplasmin, IgE, IgG, IgG 
aspergillus, IgM, and IgA significantly decreased. Patients presenting 
colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) remained unchanged (27%) during 
follow-up. In bronchiectasis patients, FEV1 declined only after a one-year 
follow-up along with increased exacerbation numbers and disease severity scores, 
but not hospitalizations. However, a significant decrease in acute 
phase-reactants and immunoglobulins was observed at the one-year follow-up 
compared to baseline. Despite the relatively small cohort, the reported findings 
suggest that lung function impairment may not rely entirely on the patients' 
inflammatory status.

In recent years the blood proteome has been increasingly researched for 
biomarkers for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). Blood samples from 
screening studies are often subject to preanalytical variability and repeated 
freeze−thaw cycles. We aimed to assess the correlation of repeat measurements of 
27 candidate protein markers for CRC screening taken three years and multiple 
freeze−thaw cycles apart. The concentrations of 27 protein markers were measured 
in plasma samples of 39 newly detected CRC cases from a cohort of 9245 
participants of screening colonoscopies. The proteins were measured using 
proximity extension assays (PEA) carried out on the same set of samples twice, 
three years apart, with an average of three freeze−thaw cycles in between the 
two measurements. Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficients were 
calculated. Correlation coefficients ranged from +0.43 to +0.97, with a median 
of 0.67 and an interquartile range of +0.58 to +0.84, with all p-values of 
correlation being <0.01 (<0.0005 for 22 proteins, <0.001 for 4 proteins). Repeat 
measurements of the 27 protein biomarkers for CRC screening performed three 
years later, and on average three freeze−thaw cycles apart, showed moderate to 
high levels of correlation. Apart from the effects of freeze−thaw cycles, 
slightly different preprocessing performed on the data may have contributed to 
recorded differences between measurements.

The concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere has been 
increasing since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Nitrous oxide (N2O) 
is one of the mightiest GHGs, and agriculture is one of the main sources of N2O 
emissions. In this paper, we reviewed the mechanisms triggering N2O emissions 
and the role of agricultural practices in their mitigation. The amount of N2O 
produced from the soil through the combined processes of nitrification and 
denitrification is profoundly influenced by temperature, moisture, carbon, 
nitrogen and oxygen contents. These factors can be manipulated to a significant 
extent through field management practices, influencing N2O emission. The 
relationships between N2O occurrence and factors regulating it are an important 
premise for devising mitigation strategies. Here, we evaluated various options 
in the literature and found that N2O emissions can be effectively reduced by 
intervening on time and through the method of N supply (30-40%, with peaks up to 
80%), tillage and irrigation practices (both in non-univocal way), use of 
amendments, such as biochar and lime (up to 80%), use of slow-release 
fertilizers and/or nitrification inhibitors (up to 50%), plant treatment with 
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (up to 75%), appropriate crop rotations and schemes 
(up to 50%), and integrated nutrient management (in a non-univocal way). In 
conclusion, acting on N supply (fertilizer type, dose, time, method, etc.) is 
the most straightforward way to achieve significant N2O reductions without 
compromising crop yields. However, tuning the rest of crop management (tillage, 
irrigation, rotation, etc.) to principles of good agricultural practices is also 
advisable, as it can fetch significant N2O abatement vs. the risk of unexpected 
rise, which can be incurred by unwary management.

INTRODUCTION: Deep sternal wound infections (DSWI) after cardiac surgery pose a 
significant challenge in reconstructive surgery. In this context, free flaps 
represent well-established options. The objective of this study was to 
investigate the clinical outcome after free myocutaneous tensor fasciae latae 
(TFL) flap reconstruction of sternal defects, with a special focus on surgical 
complications and donor-site morbidity.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review focused on patient demographics, operative 
details, and postoperative complications. Follow-up reexaminations included 
assessments of the range of motion and muscle strength at the donor-site. 
Patients completed the Quality of Life 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) 
as well as the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) questionnaire and 
evaluated aesthetic and functional outcomes on a 6-point Likert scale. The 
Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scales 
(POSAS) were used to rate scar appearance.
RESULTS: A total of 46 patients (mean age: 67 ± 11 years) underwent sternal 
defect reconstruction with free TFL flaps between January 2010 and March 2021. 
The mean defect size was 194 ± 43 cm2. The mean operation time was 387 ± 120 min 
with a flap ischemia time of 63 ± 16 min. Acute microvascular complications due 
to flap pedicle thromboses occurred in three patients (7%). All flaps could be 
salvaged without complete flap loss. Partial flap loss of the distal TFL portion 
was observed in three patients (7%). All three patients required additional 
reconstruction with pedicled or local flaps. Upon follow-up, the range of motion 
(hip joint extension/flexion (p = 0.73), abduction/adduction (p = 0.29), and 
internal/external rotation (p = 0.07)) and muscle strength at the donor-sites 
did not differ from the contralateral sides (p = 0.25). Patient assessments of 
aesthetic and functional outcomes, as well as the median SF-36 (physical 
component summary (44, range of 33 to 57)) and LEFS (54, range if 35 to 65), 
showed good results with respect to patient comorbidities. The median VSS (3, 
range of 2 to 7) and POSAS (24, range of 18 to 34) showed satisfactory scar 
quality and scar appearance.
CONCLUSION: The free TFL flap is a reliable, effective, and, therefore, valuable 
option for the reconstruction of extensive sternal defects in critically ill 
patients suffering from DSWIs. In addition, the TFL flap shows satisfactory 
functional and aesthetic results at the donor-site.

AIMS: There are substantial differences in remaining life expectancy at higher 
ages between occupational groups. These differences may be the effect of 
work-related exposures, lifestyle factors of workers in specific occupations, 
socioeconomic position or a combination of this. The scope of this paper is the 
extent to which occupational differences in remaining life expectancy persist 
after retirement, which would suggest that occupational exposures alone are not 
likely to explain all the difference.
METHODS: All individuals born between 1925 and 1939 who reported occupational 
information in the Census 1985 and were residents in Sweden to the end of 2020 
or who died were included and followed for death until 2020. The Nordic 
Classification of Occupations was used to create nine occupational groups. 
Partial life expectancy and age-specific death rates were applied to examine 
mortality differentials.
RESULTS: This study showed substantial differences in partial life expectancy 
across the occupational cohorts with the biggest difference being about 2 years. 
The mortality differences persisted with increasing age, both when measured as 
absolute numbers as well as relative numbers.
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of convergence in mortality at high ages suggests that 
factors associated with lifestyle may play a larger role than occupational 
factors for the mortality differences between occupational groups at high ages. 
However, it cannot be ruled out that long-lasting effects of earlier 
occupational exposures also contribute. Regardless of the exact mechanism, we 
conclude that there is room for further reduction in mortality at high ages and, 
thus, for further improvement in life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Archaea form a third domain of life that is distinct from Bacteria 
and Eukarya. So far, many scholars have elucidated considerable details about 
the typical promoter architectures of the three domains of life. However, a 
functional promoter from the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum has never been 
studied in Escherichia coli.
RESULTS: This paper found that the promoter of Halobacterium salinarum showed a 
promoter function in Escherichia coli. This Escherichia coli promoter structure 
contains - 10 box, -10 box extension and - 29 elements, however, no -35 box. The 
- 29 element is exercised by the TATA box in archaea. And we isolated the RM10 
fragment that possessed the fusion characteristics of bacteria and archaea, 
which was overlapped with functionality of TATA box and - 29 elements.
CONCLUSIONS: The - 29 element reflects the evolutionary relationship between the 
archaeal promoter and the bacterial promoter. The result possibly indicated that 
there may be a certain internal connection between archaea and bacteria. We 
hypothesized that it provided a new viewpoint of the evolutionary relationship 
of archaea and other organisms.

BACKGROUND: Advanced medical technologies can prolong life of stroke survivors. 
Dynamic change of health outcomes provides essential information to manage 
stroke. Mathematical models, to extrapolate health status over a lifetime from 
cross-sectional data, can be used to investigate long term health outcomes among 
stroke survivors. This study aimed to estimate the health outcomes of ischemic 
stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at each survival time point.
METHODS: The cohort of 5391 patients with IS and ICH stroke, registered at 
Ramathibodi Hospital from 2005 to 2013, were followed up regarding survival 
status until 2016 with the National Mortality Registry. Survival functions were 
extrapolated over 50 years to age- and sex-matched referents simulated from the 
national data of the Thailand National Health Statistic Office. From July to 
December 2016, the EuroQoL 5-dimension questionnaire was used to measure quality 
of life (QoL) among 400 consecutive, cross-sectional subsamples. The survival 
functions were then adjusted by the utility values of QoL for the stroke cohort 
to estimate quality adjusted life expectancy (QALE).
RESULTS: The average health utility values were lower in the initial months, 
then slowly increased to stable levels. However, male stroke survivors presented 
higher health utility than females. Throughout lifetime estimation, patients 
with IS stroke exhibit better health outcomes than those with ICH [10.2 vs. 7.5 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)]. Patients with ICH presented a 
significantly decreased QoL than patients with IS (16.3 and 8.5 QALYs).
CONCLUSION: Preventing stroke can save people from reduced years and QoL, which 
can be quantified by loss-of-QALE in QALY units to compare health benefits from 
prevention, clinical diagnosis and direct treatment.

BACKGROUND: Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of lysosomal storage 
disorders caused by defects in genes coding for different lysosomal enzymes 
which degrade glycosaminoglycans. Impaired lysosomal degradation causes cell 
dysfunction leading to progressive multiorgan involvement, disabling 
consequences and poor life expectancy. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is now 
available for most MPS types, offering beneficial effects on disease progression 
and improving quality of life of patients. The landscape of MPS in Europe is not 
completely described and studies on availability of treatment show that ERT is 
not adequately implemented, particularly in Southern and Eastern Europe. In this 
study we performed a survey analysis in main specialist centers in Southern and 
Eastern European countries, to outline the picture of disease management in the 
region and understand ERT implementation. Since the considerable number of MPS 
IVA patients in the region, particularly adults, the study mainly focused on MPS 
IVA management and treatment.
RESULTS: 19 experts from 14 Southern and Eastern European countries in total 
responded to the survey. Results outlined a picture of MPS management in the 
region, with a high number of MPS patients managed in the centers and a high 
level of care. MPS II was the most prevalent followed by MPS IVA, with a 
particular high number of adult patients. The study particularly focused on 
management and treatment of MPS IVA patients. Adherence to current European 
Guidelines for follow-up of MPS IVA patients is generally adequate, although 
some important assessments are reported as difficult due to the lack of MPS 
skilled specialists. Availability of ERT in Southern and Eastern European 
countries is generally in line with other European regions, even though 
regulatory, organizational and reimbursement constrains are demanding.
CONCLUSIONS: The landscape of MPS in Southern and Eastern European countries is 
generally comparable to that of other European regions, regarding epidemiology, 
treatment accessibility and follow up difficulties. However, issues limiting ERT 
availability and reimbursement should be simplified, to start treatment as early 
as possible and make it available for more patients. Besides, educational 
programs dedicated to specialists should be implemented, particularly for 
pediatricians, clinical geneticists, surgeons, anesthesiologists and 
neurologists.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most frequent life-limiting autosomal recessive 
disease in Caucasians, affecting the respiratory tract, but also the pancreas, 
gut, and hepatobiliary tract. CF is caused by variants in the Cystic Fibrosis 
Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. Prognosis of CF has markedly 
improved over the last 20 years because of the management in CF centers and 
recent introduction of CFTR modulators, aimed at correcting the defective CFTR 
protein. There are nowadays more CF adults than children, with a predicted 
median survival age of around 50 years in high-income countries. Around 85% of 
CF patients have pancreatic insufficiency present at birth. Gastroesophageal 
reflux disease (GERD) is more frequent in CF patients, but its role on decline 
in lung health is controversial. Distal small bowel obstruction syndrome (DIOS) 
caused by meconium-like stool plugs occurs at any age after the neonatal period, 
affecting up to 15-20% of CF patients. Because of increased life expectancy, 
most CF patients are expected to live to their fifties or beyond, when cancer is 
more frequent. In addition, CF is associated with a higher risk for GI 
malignancy as compared with the general population. Colorectal cancer represents 
the most significant risk, and colonoscopy-based screening is recommended from 
40 years of age onwards. Other digestive outcomes in CF reviewed in this paper 
include meconium ileus, Clostridium difficile infection, intussusception, acute 
appendicitis, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, appendiceal mucocele and 
rectal prolapse. Every CF Center should comprise a gastroenterologist with 
expertise in the care of CF patients.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The updated guidelines of the European Society for Clinical 
Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) and for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) 
on nutrition in intensively treated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients 
recommend enteral nutrition (EN) instead of parenteral nutrition (PN) as the 
first-choice medical nutrition therapy. Despite this, PN remains the preferred 
route of nutrition administration in daily practice. The aim of this qualitative 
study was to gain insight into the patients' and hematology nurses' experiences 
and perceptions regarding nutritional problems and nutritional support and the 
reasons for the low adherence to the ESPEN/EBMT guidelines.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 23 patients from various 
Dutch hospitals who had completed intensive AML treatment. Interviews with 22 
patients were audio-recorded and transcribed, one interview was summarized. The 
transcripts and summary were thematically analyzed using Atlas.ti. From each of 
the 22 Dutch hospitals providing intensive AML treatment, one hematology nurse 
participated in a telephone questionnaire survey. The results of this survey are 
presented in a descriptive way.
RESULTS: Nutritional problems were a major source of distress in most 
participating patients. Nutritional support often led to peace of mind and less 
concerns, provided that there were no conflicting nutritional support practices 
among treating hospitals. Patients perceived PN and EN as a life-line and 
necessary for the prevention of or recovery from physical decline, but they also 
experienced loss of independence, limited mobility, fear of unwanted body weight 
gain and problems related to the feeding equipment. Both patients and hematology 
nurses regarded PN as an easy method of nutrition administration, while EN was 
often seen as a necessary evil or was even refused by patients, owing to 
tube-related physical discomfort and EN intolerance. Both patients' and 
hematology nurses' reluctance to administer EN proved to be barriers to the 
ESPEN/EBMT nutritional guideline adherence. Among the surveyed hematology 
nurses, barriers to adherence included personal factors related to their 
knowledge (lack of awareness) and attitudes (negative outcome expectancy and 
lack of agreement), guideline-related factors (lack of evidence) and external 
factors (lack of collaboration).
CONCLUSION: Individualized nutritional support, including EN and PN, may reduce 
nutrition-related distress in intensively treated AML patients, provided that 
conflicting nutritional support practices among hospitals are avoided or 
explained. The barriers to adherence to the ESPEN/EBMT guidelines on EN and PN 
in this patient group may be reduced by enhancing hematology nurses' awareness 
and knowledge of the guidelines, incorporating the guidelines into 
multidisciplinary clinical pathways, improving outcome of EN by proper triage of 
patients eligible for EN and increasing the level of evidence of the guidelines.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is emerging as an 
appealing management strategy for patients with severe aortic stenosis at 
intermediate, high or exceedingly high risk, but its risk-benefit profile in 
younger patients is less certain. We aimed to explore the outlook of patients 
aged 70 years or less and undergoing TAVI at 2 high-volume Italian institutions.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected baseline, imaging, procedural and outcome 
features of patients with age ≤70 years in whom TAVI was attempted at 
participating centers between 2012 and 2021. Non-parametric tests and bootstrap 
resampling were used for inferential purposes.
RESULTS: A total of 39 patients were included, out of >3000 screened with heart 
team involvement and >1500 receiving TAVI. Most common or relevant indications 
for TAVI reduced life expectancy (e.g. cardiogenic shock or severe left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, morbid 
obesity, active or recent extra-cardiac cancer, porcelain aorta, neurologic 
disability, cirrhosis, or prior surgical aortic valve replacement, as well as 
extreme cachexia, and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria. At least two contemporary 
high-risk features were present in most cases. Transapical access was used in 5 
(12.8%) cases, and a sheathless approach in 15 (38.5%). A variety of devices 
were used, including both balloon- and self-expandable devices. Clinical 
outcomes were satisfactory, despite the high-risk profile, at both short- and 
mid-term, with no in-hospital death, and 5.1% (95% confidence interval 0-12.8%) 
mortality at a median follow-up of 15 months (minimum 1; maximum 85). Notably, 
no case of significant valve deterioration requiring reintervention occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: In carefully selected patients with 70 years or less of age and 
prohibitive risk for surgery or reduced life expectancy, TAVI represents a safe 
option with a favorable mid-term survival and low rate of adverse events.

Principles and processes of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) are 
increasingly being applied to subspecialties and subspecialty conditions, 
including cardiovascular patients (i.e., infective endocarditis; considerations 
of surgery or transcatheter aortic valve replacement, TAVR, for patients with 
aortic stenosis; vascular surgery) and postoperative mortality risk. In 
cardiovascular field CGA has mainly the aim to define ideal management according 
to the different typology of older adult patients (e.g., robust versus 
intermediate versus physical and cognitively disabled versus end-stage or 
dying), allowing physicians to select different therapeutic goals according to 
life expectancy; Aspect to be valued are by CGA are global health status and 
patient's decision-making capacity: CGA allows the individualized treatment 
definition and optimize the preprocedure condition.

Life expectancy has dramatically increased over the past 200 years, but modern 
life factors such as environmental exposure, antibiotic overuse, C-section 
deliveries, limited breast-feeding, and diets poor in fibers and microbes could 
be associated with the rise of noncommunicable diseases such as overweight, 
obesity, diabetes, food allergies, and colorectal cancer as well as other 
conditions such as mental disorders. Microbial interventions that range from 
transplanting a whole undefined microbial community from a healthy gut to an ill 
one, e.g., so-called fecal microbiota transplantation or vaginal seeding, to the 
administration of selected well-characterized microbes, either live (probiotics) 
or not (postbiotics), with efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials, may be 
effective tools to treat or prevent acute and chronic diseases that humans still 
face, enhancing the quality of life.

Background: End-stage liver disease (ESLD) is associated with high morbidity and 
mortality, with liver transplantation as the only existing cure. Despite reduced 
quality of life and limited life expectancy, referral to palliative care (PC) 
rarely occurs. Moreover, there is scarcity of data on the appropriate timing and 
type of PC intervention needed. Aim: To evaluate PC utilization and 
documentation in ESLD patients declined or delisted for transplant at a tertiary 
care medical center with a large liver transplantation program. Methods: We 
performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients discussed in Liver 
Transplant Committee (LTC) at our academic medical center between August 2018 
and May 2020 in the United States. Patients declined or delisted for liver 
transplantation were included. Baseline demographics, model for end-stage liver 
disease (MELD) score, decompensation events, and reason for transplant 
ineligibility were recorded. The primary outcome was PC referral. Secondary 
outcomes included survival from LTC decision, time from LTC decision to PC 
referral, and code status in relation to PC referral. Results: Of 769 patients 
discussed at LTC, 135 were declined for transplantation. Thirty-seven (27%) 
received referral to PC. When adjusting for body mass index and age, MELD score 
of 21-30 had odds ratio (OR) of 4.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-12.3) and 
MELD score >30 had OR of 12.8 (95% CI: 3.9-47.7) for PC referral when compared 
with MELD score <20. When adjusting for MELD score, presence of ascites had OR 
of 4.6 (95% CI: 1.1-19.1) and presence of multiple complications had OR of 2.2 
(95% CI: 2.2-3.8). Conclusions: Only 37 (27%) patients delisted or declined for 
liver transplantation were referred to PC. MELD score and degree of 
decompensation were important factors associated with referral. Continued 
exploration of these data could help guide future studies and help determine 
timing and criteria for PC referral.

Guava processing industries generate peel and seeds as primary waste fractions. 
Guava seeds obtained after fruit processing possess untapped potential in the 
field of food science due to the presence of a diversity of nutritional and 
bioactive compounds. Along with offering a detailed understanding of the 
nutritional attributes of guava seeds, the present review comprehensively 
elaborates on the therapeutic activities of their bioactive compounds, their 
techno-functional properties, and their other edible and nonedible applications. 
The limited molecular and biochemical mechanistic studies outlining the 
antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anticancer, antimicrobial, neuroprotective and 
antidiabetic activities of guava seeds available in the literature are also 
extensively discussed in this review. The use of guava seed constituents as food 
additives and food functional and structural modulators, primarily as fat 
reducers, emulsifiers, water and oil holding agents, is also conceptually 
explained. Additional human intervention and molecular mechanistic studies 
deciphering the effects of guava seeds on various diseases and human health are 
warranted.

The magnitude and prospect of rewards can have strong modulatory effects on 
response preparation and execution. Importantly, reward-seeking behavior in real 
life happens under an environment characterized by uncertainty and dynamic 
changes. The current study investigated how the brain's motor and cognitive 
control system adapts to the dynamic changes in the environment in pursuit of 
rewards. To this end, we tested the effect of reward and expectancy on the 
hallmark neural signals that reflect activity in motor and prefrontal systems, 
the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) and the mediofrontal (mPFC) theta 
oscillations, while participants performed an expected and unexpected actions to 
retrieve rewards. To better capture the dynamic changes in neural processes 
represented in the LRP waveform, we decomposed the LRP into the preparation 
(LRPprep) and execution (LRPexec) components. In the comparison of LRP magnitude 
across task conditions, we found a greater LRPprep when large rewards were more 
likely, reflecting a greater motor preparation to obtain larger rewards. We also 
found a greater LRPexec when large rewards were presented unexpectedly, 
suggesting a greater motor effort placed for executing a correct movement when 
presented with large rewards. In the analysis of mPFC theta, we found a greater 
theta power prior to performing an unexpected than expected response, indicating 
its contribution in response conflict resolution. Collectively, these results 
demonstrate an optimized motor and cognitive control to maximize rewards under 
the dynamic changes of real-life environment.

School, Okayama 701-0192, Japan.

Background and Objectives: There have been numerous advances in spine surgery 
for metastatic spinal tumors, and minimally invasive spine stabilization (MISt) 
is becoming increasingly popular in Japan. MISt is a minimally invasive fixation 
procedure that temporarily stabilizes the spine, thereby reducing pain, 
preventing pathological fractures, and improving activities of daily living at 
an early stage. MISt may be useful given the recent shift toward outpatient 
cancer treatment. Materials and Methods: This study enrolled 51 patients with 
metastatic spinal tumors who underwent surgery using MISt between December 2013 
and October 2020. The Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score, an assessment of 
spinal instability, was used to determine the indication for surgery, and the 
Epidural Spinal Cord Compression scale was used for additional decompression. 
Results: The patients comprised 34 men and 17 women, and the mean age at surgery 
was 68.9 years. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 20.8 months, and 35 
of 51 patients (67%) had died by the last survey. The mean operative time was 
159.8 min, mean blood loss was 115.7 mL, and mean time to ambulation was 3.2 
days. No perioperative complications were observed, although two patients 
required refixation surgery. Preoperatively, 37 patients (72.5%) were classified 
as Frankel grade E. There were no cases of postoperative exacerbation, and six 
patients showed improvement of one or more Frankel grades after surgery. The 
median duration of patient survival was about 22.0 months. Patients with breast, 
prostate, renal, and thyroid cancers had a good prognosis, whereas those with 
gastrointestinal and head and neck cancers had a poor prognosis. Conclusions: 
MISt can benefit patients who are ineligible for conventional, highly invasive 
surgery and is also suitable because cancer treatment is increasingly performed 
on an outpatient basis. Furthermore, choosing the right surgery for the right 
patient at the right time can significantly affect life expectancy.
