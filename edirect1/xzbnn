chronological age (Bayesian information criterion [BIC](DtD) = 22,964.8 vs. 
BIC(age) = 23,322.6). Optimism was a significant correlate of both linear 
(estimate(DtD) = -0.01, SE(DtD) = 0.005; ρ = 0.004) and quadratic (estimate(DtD) 
= -0.006, SE(DtD) = 0.002; ρ = 0.004) terminal decline in global QOL so that 
death-related decline in global QOL was steeper among those with a high level of 
optimism than those with a low level of optimism. We found that dispositional 
optimism helps to maintain positive psychological perspective in the face of 
age-related decline. Optimists maintain higher QOL compared with pessimists when 
death-related trajectories were considered; however, the gap between those with 
high optimism and those with low optimism progressively attenuated with closer 
proximity to death, to the point that is became nonsignificant at the time of 
death.

Trends in U.S. life expectancy gradients: the role of changing educational 
composition.

Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. hendias@sas.upenn.edu.

BACKGROUND: I examined age patterns and the role of shifting educational 
distributions in driving trends in educational gradients in life expectancy 
among non-Hispanic Whites between 1991 and 2005.
METHODS: Data were from the 1986-2004 National Health Interview Survey with 
mortality follow-up through 2006. Life expectancies were computed by sex, period 
and education. Age decompositions of life expectancy gradients and 
composition-adjusted life expectancies were computed to account for age patterns 
and shifting educational distributions.
RESULTS: Life expectancy at age 25 among White men increased for all education 
groups, decreased among the least-educated White women and increased among White 
women with college degrees. Much of the decline in measured life expectancy for 
White women with less than a high school education comes from the 85+ age group. 
Educational gradients in life expectancy widened for White men and women. 
One-third of the gradient is due to ages below 50. Approximately 26% (0.7 years) 
and 87% (0.8 years) of the widening of the gradient in life expectancy between 
ages 25 and 85 for White women and men is attributable to shifting education 
distributions. Over half of the decline in temporary life expectancy among the 
least-educated White women is due to compositional change.
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy has increased among White men for all education 
groups and has decreased among White women with less than a high school 
education, though not to the extent reported in previous studies. The fact that 
a large proportion of the change in education-specific life expectancy among 
women is due to the 85+ age group suggests changes in institutionalization may 
be affecting estimates. Much of the change in education-specific life expectancy 
and the growth in the educational gradient in life expectancy is due to the 
shifting distribution of individuals across education categories.

BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by hyperkinetic movements, psychiatric (e.g. depression 
and psychosis) and cognitive symptoms (frontal lobe dementia). In Germany 
approximately 8000 patients suffer from HD.
OBJECTIVES: The paper reviews the clinical course, epidemiology, genetics, 
differential diagnoses, pathophysiology, symptomatics and causal treatment 
options.
METHODS: Publications on animal and human HD studies and trials and reviews 
available in Medline have been taken into account.
RESULTS: Only genetic testing allows diagnostic certainty. The CAG repeat length 
influences age of onset, disease course and life expectancy. The mechanism by 
which mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) causes HD is complex and poorly 
understood but leads to cell death, in particular in striatal neurons. In 
clinical trials antioxidants (e.g. coenzyme Q10), selisistat, PBT2, cysteamine, 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonists and tyrosine kinase B receptor 
agonists have been studied in HD.
CONCLUSION: No disease-modifying therapy is currently available for HD; however, 
gene silencing, e.g. through RNA interference, is a promising technique which 
could lead to effective therapies in due course.

The interaction between curcumin and pepsin was investigated by fluorescence, 
synchronous fluorescence, UV-vis absorption, circular dichroism (CD), and 
molecular docking. Under physiological pH value in stomach, the fluorescence of 
pepsin can be quenched effectively by curcumin via a combined quenching process. 
Binding constant (Ka) and binding site number (n) of curcumin to pepsin were 
obtained. According to the theory of Förster's non-radiation energy transfer, 
the distance r between pepsin and curcumin was found to be 2.45 nm within the 
curcumin-pepsin complex, which implies that the energy transfer occurs between 
curcumin and pepsin, leading to the quenching of pepsin fluorescence. 
Fluorescence experiments also suggest that curcumin is located more closely to 
tryptophan residues than tyrosine residues. CD spectra together with UV-vis 
absorbance studies show that binding of curcumin to pepsin results in the 
extension of peptide strands of pepsin with loss of some β-sheet structures. 
Thermodynamic parameters calculated from the binding constants at different 
temperatures reveal that hydrophobic force plays a major role in stabilizing the 
curcumin-pepsin complex. In addition, docking results support the above 
experimental findings and suggest the possible hydrogen bonds of curcumin with 
Thr-77, Thr-218, and Glu-287 of pepsin, which help further stabilize the 
curcumin-pepsin complex.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
panels for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and polyposis (CRCP) syndromes in 
patients referred to cancer genetics clinics.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We developed a decision model to evaluate NGS panel 
testing compared with current standard of care in patients referred to a cancer 
genetics clinic. We obtained data on the prevalence of genetic variants from a 
large academic laboratory and calculated the costs and health benefits of 
identifying relatives with a pathogenic variant, in life-years and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We classified the CRCP syndromes according 
to their type of inheritance and penetrance of colorectal cancer. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty.
RESULTS: Evaluation with an NGS panel that included Lynch syndrome genes and 
other genes associated with highly penetrant CRCP syndromes led to an average 
increase of 0.151 year of life, 0.128 QALY, and $4,650 per patient, resulting in 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $36,500 per QALY compared with 
standard care and a 99% probability that this panel was cost effective at a 
threshold of $100,000 per QALY. When compared with this panel, the addition of 
genes with low colorectal cancer penetrance resulted in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $77,300 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: The use of an NGS panel that includes genes associated with highly 
penetrant CRCP syndromes in addition to Lynch syndrome genes as a first-line 
test is likely to provide meaningful clinical benefits in a cost-effective 
manner at a $100,000 per QALY threshold.

The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, known as PCORI, was 
established by Congress as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to promote 
evidence-based treatment. Provisions of the ACA prohibit the use of a 
cost-effectiveness analysis threshold and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in 
PCORI comparative effectiveness studies, which has been understood as a 
prohibition on support for PCORI's conducting conventional cost-effectiveness 
analyses. This constraint complicates evidence-based choices where incremental 
improvements in outcomes are achieved at increased costs of care. How frequently 
this limitation inhibits efficient cost containment, also a goal of the ACA, 
depends on how often more effective treatment is not cost-effective relative to 
less effective treatment. We examined the largest database of studies of 
comparisons of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness to see how often there is 
disagreement between the more effective treatment and the cost-effective 
treatment, for various thresholds that may define good value. We found that 
under the benchmark assumption, disagreement between the two types of analyses 
occurs in 19 percent of cases. Disagreement is more likely to occur if a 
treatment intervention is musculoskeletal and less likely to occur if it is 
surgical or involves secondary prevention, or if the study was funded by a 
pharmaceutical company.

The use of Intravenous Laser Blood Irradiation (ILBI) at 630-640 nm to prevent 
vascular diseases and to increase life expectancy.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The mortality rate from vascular diseases is one of the 
highest. The use of Intravenous Laser Blood Irradiation (ILBI) within the last 
30 years has demonstrated high efficacy in the treatment of vascular, cardiac 
and other systemic diseases.
RATIONALE: Laser energy at 630-640 nanometers is arguably the most effective for 
irradiation of blood and the vascular wall. Photons at this wavelength are 
absorbed by oxygen, improve microcirculation, can change the viscosity of the 
blood and affect vascular endothelium.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, more than 25 years of experience of using laser energy 
at 630-640 nm has shown that this waveband directly influences the parameters of 
all cells in the blood, blood plasma, the coagulation process and all the 
structural components of the vascular wall. Additionally, ILBI directly or 
indirectly affects the cells of the immune system, hormones, and exchange 
processes in an organism, thereby not only improving the function of the 
vascular system, but also the other systems of an organism. It can finally lead 
to lower the incidence and number of vascular diseases, and indirectly to the 
reduction of the number of diseases in other organs and even systemically, thus 
helping to prolong the lifespan.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has a wide presence in children and has a high 
mortality rates. The disease, if left unmanaged, poses various challenges to the 
patient and healthcare providers, including development of diabetic 
complications and thus decreasing the life expectancy of the affected child. The 
challenges of T1DM include awareness of the disease that is very poor among the 
general public and also in parents of T1DM children along with the health care 
professionals. The challenge of lack of awareness of T1DM can be met by 
increasing public awareness programs, conducting workshops for diabetes 
educators regarding T1DM in children, newsletters, CMEs, online courses, and by 
structured teaching modules for diabetes educators. Diagnosis of T1DM was a 
challenge a few decades ago but the situation has improved today with diagnostic 
tests and facilities, made available even in villages. Investigation facilities 
and infrastructure, however, are very poor at the primary care level, especially 
in rural areas. Insulin availability, acceptability, and affordability are also 
major problems, compounded by the various types of insulin that are available in 
the market with a varied price range. But effective use of insulin remains a 
matter of utmost importance.

OBJECTIVE: Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) using SIR-Spheres(®) 
(90)Y-labeled resin microspheres has been shown to be a well-tolerated, 
effective treatment in patients with inoperable liver-dominant 
chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This study 
estimated the cost-effectiveness of (90)Y-resin microspheres compared to best 
supportive care (BSC) from a UK perspective.
METHODS: Survival data from a comparative retrospective cohort study was 
analyzed and used in a state-transition cost-effectiveness model, using 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained as the measure of effectiveness. The 
model incorporated costs for the SIRT procedure, monitoring, further treatment, 
adverse events, and death. Utility values, reflecting patient quality-of-life, 
were taken from a published source.
RESULTS: SIRT using (90)Y-resin microspheres compared to BSC improved overall 
survival by a mean of 1.12 life years and resulted in a cost per QALY gained of 
£28,216. In sensitivity analysis, this varied between £25,015-£28,817.
CONCLUSION: In an area of large unmet need, treatment with (90)Y-resin 
microspheres offers a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment option.

OBJECTIVE: Estimate the Years of Life Lost (YLL) for overall and avoidable 
causes of death (CoD) in Colombia for the period 1998-2011.
METHODS: From the reported deaths to the Colombian mortality database during 
1998-2011, we classified deaths from avoidable causes. With the reference life 
table of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study, we estimated the overall 
YLL and YLL due to avoidable causes. Calculations were performed with the 
difference between life expectancy and the age of death. Results are reported by 
group of cause of death, events, sex, year and department. Comparative analysis 
between number of deaths and YLL was carried out.
RESULTS: A total of 83,856,080 YLL were calculated in Colombia during period 
1998-2011, 75.9% of them due to avoidable CoD. The year 2000 reported the 
highest number of missed YLL by both overall and avoidable CoD. The departments 
with the highest YLL rates were Caquetá, Guaviare, Arauca, Meta, and Risaralda. 
In men, intentional injuries and cardiovascular and circulatory diseases had the 
higher losses, while in women YLL were mainly due to cardiovascular and 
circulatory diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: The public health priorities should focus on preventing the loss of 
YLL due to premature death and differentiated interventions by sex.

BACKGROUND: Poor outcomes and high resource-use are observed for frail older 
people discharged from acute medical units. A specialist geriatric medical 
intervention, to facilitate Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, was developed to 
reduce the incidence of adverse outcomes and associated high resource-use in 
this group in the post-discharge period.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the costs and cost-effectiveness of a specialist geriatric 
medical intervention for frail older people in the 90 days following discharge 
from an acute medical unit, compared with standard care.
METHODS: Economic evaluation was conducted alongside a two-centre randomised 
controlled trial (AMIGOS). 433 patients (aged 70 or over) at risk of future 
health problems, discharged from acute medical units within 72 hours of 
attending hospital, were recruited in two general hospitals in Nottingham and 
Leicester, UK. Participants were randomised to the intervention, comprising 
geriatrician assessment in acute units and further specialist management, or to 
control where patients received no additional intervention over and above 
standard care. Primary outcome was incremental cost per quality adjusted life 
year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: We undertook cost-effectiveness analysis for 417 patients 
(intervention: 205). The difference in mean adjusted QALYs gained between groups 
at 3 months was -0.001 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.009, 0.007). Total 
adjusted secondary and social care costs, including direct costs of the 
intervention, at 3 months were £4412 (€5624, $6878) and £4110 (€5239, $6408) for 
the intervention and standard care groups, the incremental cost was £302 (95% 
CI: 193, 410) [€385, $471]. The intervention was dominated by standard care with 
probability of 62%, and with 0% probability of cost-effectiveness (at 
£20,000/QALY threshold).
CONCLUSIONS: The specialist geriatric medical intervention for frail older 
people discharged from acute medical unit was not cost-effective. Further

BACKGROUND: Screening for donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) using 
bead-based multiplex assays to determine transplant suitability is standard 
practice in many countries. We compared the health benefits and costs of 
screening preformed DSA using bead-based assay as an add-on test to 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) crossmatch with CDC crossmatch alone, 
and determined the optimal threshold to determine transplant suitability.
METHODS: Three probabilistic Markov models were developed to compare bead-based 
assay with CDC and CDC alone. The model assumed a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 
patients who received only a single kidney transplant and terminated when all 
patients were deceased.
RESULTS: Assuming transplantation was permitted for recipients with no DSA or 
with a DSA mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) value of 500 or less, screening by 
bead-based assay and CDC saved 6.5 grafts and U.S. $1,192,303 per 100 
transplants compared with CDC alone. If the thresholds were increased to an MFI 
of 2000 or less and 5000 or less, an extra 6.4 and 6.1 grafts would be saved, 
with cost savings of U.S. $867,203 and U.S. $830,664 per 100 transplants 
compared with CDC alone. The total number of kidney transplants performed would 
have increased by 8 and 9, respectively, but at the expense of an extra 0.1 and 
0.4 graft lost per 100 transplants after 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening using bead-based assay is cost-saving and improves graft 
outcomes. The greatest benefits and cost-savings are achieved if transplantation 
occurs at a threshold of MFI of 500 or less or in those without preformed DSA. 
Increasing the threshold to an MFI of 2000 or less may provide an acceptable 
balance for improving transplant eligibility without compromising longer-term 
outcomes.

Eye Hospital, London, UK.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of immediate treatment with 
ranibizumab in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) 
with good (better than 6/12) starting visual acuity compared with current UK 
clinical guidance of waiting until vision falls below 6/12 to begin treatment, 
using real-world outcomes data.
DESIGN: A patient-level health economic state transition model based on levels 
of visual acuity in the better seeing eye was constructed to simulate the costs 
and consequences of treating patients with nAMD with ranibizumab.
SETTING: The model took the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS).
PARTICIPANTS: The model was populated with real-world outcomes and resource use 
from a prospective multicentre national nAMD database study containing 92,976 
ranibizumab treatment episodes.
INTERVENTIONS: Two treatment approaches were compared: immediate intervention 
with 0.5 mg ranibizumab pro re nata, PRN (on detection of nAMD) or delayed 
intervention (waiting until vision fell to 6/12 before beginning treatment).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for health states and 
healthcare costs were accrued for each strategy, and an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were employed to test the uncertainty of the model.
RESULTS: Over a 2-year time horizon, based on 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, 
the early treatment arm accumulated 1.59 QALYs and £8469.79 cost. The delayed 
treatment arm accumulated 1.35 QALYs and £7460.21 cost. The central ICER 
estimate was £4251.60.
CONCLUSIONS: A model based on real-world data is likely to be a realistic 
reflection of the health gains and resource use of ranibizumab for nAMD in the 
UK NHS. Initiating treatment immediately with ranibizumab PRN regimen is a 
cost-effective strategy compared with current guidance of initiating treatment 
at a level of 6/12 or worse vision.

On aging and aged care in Serbia.

Serbia is a demographically old nation, with 17.4 % of its residents being aged 
65 years and older in 2011. The previous two decades of turbulent history have 
significantly affected the demographic picture of this country, and their 
ramifications remain visible in Serbia's economic, political, cultural, and 
health spheres. Major demographic forces behind population aging in Serbia can 
be attributed to lower fertility rates, migrations, and declining mortality 
(reflecting improvements in overall health leading to a longer life expectancy). 
In Serbia, low fertility and migrations appear to play major roles, although the 
relative contribution of recent migrations cannot be measured with accuracy. 
Patterns of demographic aging vary considerably across different geographic, 
socioeconomic, and cultural settings. The common denominator throughout present 
day Serbia is extensive political and economic transition. One would expect 
that, given sufficient time, this process will result in improved population 
health, and yet, at this stage outcomes of major health care reform in Serbia 
are somewhat perplexing. For the second consecutive year, Serbia's health care 
system has been ranked at the very bottom of the scale among 34 European 
countries. It is then no surprise that the elderly represent particularly 
vulnerable population segment. This paper discusses some of the issues relevant 
to these demographic patterns of aging and aged care in contemporary Serbia, 
focusing on the period after 2000.

A Health Economic Evaluation of Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation: 
Guideline Adherence Versus the Observed Treatment Strategy Prior to 2012 in 
Denmark.

BACKGROUND: In 2012 the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published new 
guidelines on pharmacological stroke prophylaxis in non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation (AF). The health economics of adhering to these guidelines in 
clinical practice remains to be elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: This paper offers a health economic evaluation of two 
stroke-prophylactic treatment strategies: complete national adherence to the ESC 
guidelines on stroke prophylaxis in AF versus stroke-prophylactic treatment 
prior to 2012 in Denmark.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed to compare two treatment 
strategies. The first strategy reflected national guideline adherence with the 
use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (i.e. dabigatran etexilate), 
warfarin, and no treatment. The second strategy reflected observed stroke 
prophylaxis prior to 2012 with the utilization of warfarin, acetylsalicylic 
acid, and no treatment. A Danish health sector perspective was adopted. A Markov 
model was designed and populated with information on input parameters from the 
literature and local cost data reflecting 2014 values. A modeled patient cohort 
was constructed with a risk profile intended to reflect that of the Danish 
patient population with AF. The applied outcome was quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs).
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio amounted to <euro>3557 per 
QALY for the guideline-adherent treatment strategy (GTS) compared with the 
pre-2012 treatment strategy. This ratio is below a threshold of <euro>25,000 
(£20,000) per QALY. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the result was largely 
robust to changes in input parameters. All analyses found the GTS to be cost 
effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Guideline adherence is a cost-effective treatment strategy compared 
with the strategy employed prior to 2012 for pharmacological stroke prophylaxis 
in AF.

INTRODUCTION: We examined the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation integrated 
with treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
METHODS: Smoking veterans receiving care for PTSD (N = 943) were randomized to 
care integrated with smoking cessation versus referral to a smoking cessation 
clinic. Smoking cessation services, health care cost and utilization, quality of 
life, and biochemically-verified abstinence from cigarettes were assessed over 
18-months of follow-up. Clinical outcomes were combined with literature on 
changes in smoking status and the effect of smoking on health care cost, 
mortality, and quality of life in a Markov model of cost-effectiveness over a 
lifetime horizon. We discounted cost and outcomes at 3% per year and report 
costs in 2010 US dollars.
RESULTS: The mean of smoking cessation services cost was $1286 in those 
randomized to integrated care and $551 in those receiving standard care (P < 
.001). There were no significant differences in the cost of mental health 
services or other care. After 12 months, prolonged biochemically verified 
abstinence was observed in 8.9% of those randomized to integrated care and 4.5% 
of those randomized to standard care (P = .004). The model projected that 
Integrated Care added $836 in lifetime cost and generated 0.0259 quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs), an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $32 257 
per QALY. It was 86.0% likely to be cost-effective compared to a threshold of 
$100 000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking cessation integrated with treatment for PTSD was 
cost-effective, within a broad confidence region, but less cost-effective than 
most other smoking cessation programs reported in the literature.

A comparison of European and US guidelines for familial hypercholesterolaemia.

Centre Zagreb, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To compare the European and US guidelines for familial 
hypercholesterolaemia, but also all the European and US position/consensus 
papers on heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia published 
recently.
RECENT FINDINGS: It has been established that the prevalence of familial 
hypercholesterolaemia was previously markedly underestimated. The disease is 
characterized by a lifelong significant increase in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) 
levels and therefore premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 
Recommendations on familial hypercholesterolaemia have been included as a 
special chapter in the recent European (European Society of Cardiology/European 
Atherosclerosis Society) guidelines on dyslipidaemia, whereas in the new US 
(American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association) lipid guidelines 
they have been included only generally and these guidelines avoid mentioning 
familial hypercholesterolaemia explicitly. Both of these guidelines recommend 
statins in high doses as the treatment option. However, in the American College 
of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, there is no requirement to 
attain a specific LDL-C target which is different from the European Society of 
Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines. Although these two 
guidelines differ markedly in a number of aspects, they both stress the need to 
diagnose familial hypercholesterolaemia patients as early as possible and to 
treat them with intensive LDL-C-lowering therapy.
SUMMARY: All the guidelines and consensus papers stress that earlier diagnosis 
and effective treatment can markedly improve life expectancy among familial 
hypercholesterolaemia patients.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Allergic rhinitis has a high prevalence and negatively 
impacts quality of life. Patients commonly use complementary and integrative 
modalities to help alleviate their symptoms of allergic rhinitis, with 
approximately one in five receiving acupuncture. This article reviews the 
evidence base on the efficacy/effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of 
acupuncture for allergic rhinitis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Our review of the medical literature from January 2013 through 
December 2014 revealed that there is research demonstrating efficacy and 
effectiveness for acupuncture in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, as well as 
improvement of quality of life and quality-adjusted life-years.
SUMMARY: There are high-quality randomized controlled trials that demonstrate 
efficacy and effectiveness for acupuncture in the treatment of both seasonal and 
perennial allergic rhinitis. Smaller head-to-head studies also show some 
preliminary benefit of acupuncture when compared with antihistamines, but these 
had a variety of methodological limitations. Further studies of higher quality 
are needed, particularly with a focus on comparative effectiveness research.

Cryptosporidiosis has been reported to be associated with HIV/acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome, which greatly reduces the quality of life and shortens the 
life expectancy of HIV-infected patients. In order to properly treat the 
infected patients, accurate and automatic diagnostic tools need to be developed. 
In this study, a novel microfluidic immunochip system was presented for the 
surveillance and the rapid detection of Cryptosporidium infection in 190 
HIV-infected patients from Guangxi, China, using the P23 antigen of 
Cryptosporidium. The procedure of detection can be completed within 10 min with 
2 μl sample consumption. The system also was evaluated using the standard ELISA 
method. Among 190 HIV-infected individuals, the rate of P23 positivity was 
13.7%. Seropositivity in HIV-infected individuals was higher in female patients. 
The seropositivity to P23 was higher in HIV-infected individuals with high viral 
load, although the difference was statistically insignificant. Significantly 
higher Cryptosporidium seropositivity was observed in HIV-infected individuals 
with a CD4(+) T-cell count of <200 cells/μl than in those with ≥200 cells/μl. 
Our results also demonstrate that a lower CD4(+) T-cell count may reflect an 
increased accumulated risk for cryptosporidiosis. The detection system was 
further validated using the standard ELISA method and good correlation between 
the two methods was found (r = 0.80). Under the same sensitivity, this new 
microfluidic chip device had a specificity of 98.2%. This developed system may 
provide a powerful platform for the fast screening of Cryptospordium infection 
in HIV-infected patients.

Introduction Four-corner arthrodesis with excision of the scaphoid is an 
accepted salvage procedure for scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) and 
scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse (SNAC) and has been performed in our unit 
for over 20 years. We have undertaken a retrospective review of 116 of these 
procedures performed in 110 patients between 1992 and 2009. Fifty-eight patients 
attended for a clinical evaluation, and 29 responded by postal questionnaire. 
Methods The surgical technique undertaken was standard. That is, through a 
dorsal approach the scaphoid and tip of the radial styloid were excised. The 
capitate, lunate, triquetrum, and hamate articular surfaces were then prepared 
down to bleeding bone. Bone grafts from the scaphoid and radial styloid were 
then inserted and fixation undertaken. For the latter, various methods were 
used, including Kirschner (K-)wires, staples, bone screws, but predominantly the 
Spider plate (Integra Life Sciences, USA). Thereafter the wrist was immobilized 
for a minimum period of 2 weeks prior to rehabilitation. Results Follow-up was 
done at a mean of 9 years and 4 months (range 3-19 years). All patients reported 
a significant improvement in pain relief and ∼50% of flexion extension, although 
only 40% of radioulnar deviation. Grip strength was again ∼50% of the 
contralateral side. Most patients reported a significant improvement in function 
with 87% returning to work. In addition, radiologic evaluation identified 28 
patients (31%) who demonstrated ongoing signs of nonunion, particularly around 
the triquetrum. Fourteen of these (15%) underwent a further procedure, generally 
with success. Finally, none of the patients demonstrated any arthritic changes 
in the lunate fossa on follow-up X-ray, and all secondary procedures were 
undertaken within 2 years of the primary. Discussion This research has 
demonstrated that four-corner fusion fixed with a circular plate can result in a 
satisfactory outcome with a reduction in pain, a functional range of motion, and 
a satisfactory functional outcome. The bulk of the complications appear to occur 
in the first 2 years after surgery. Thereafter, analysis shows long-term 
satisfaction with little deterioration. Nonunion, particularly around the 
triquetrum, continues to be a problem, but it may be that this bone should be 
excised along with the scaphoid, resulting in a three-part fusion only. 
Alternatively, a simple capitolunate fusion may be satisfactory.

The changing effect of economic development on the consumption-based carbon 
intensity of well-being, 1990-2008.

Recent sustainability science research focuses on tradeoffs between human 
well-being and stress placed on the environment from fossil fuel consumption, a 
relationship known as the carbon intensity of well-being (CIWB). In this study 
we assess how the effect of economic development on consumption-based CIWB--a 
ratio of consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions to average life 
expectancy--changed from 1990 to 2008 for 69 nations throughout the world. We 
examine the effect of development on consumption-based CIWB for the overall 
sample as well as for smaller samples restricted to mostly high-income OECD 
nations, Non-OECD nations, and more nuanced regional samples of Non-OECD nations 
in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We find that the effect of economic 
development on CIWB increased through time for the overall sample. However, 
analyses of the Non-OECD and OECD samples indicate that while the effect of 
development on CIWB increased from null to a moderate level for the Non-OECD 
nations, the effect of economic development was much larger, relatively stable 
through time, and more unsustainable for the OECD nations. Additional findings 
reveal important regional differences for Non-OECD nations. In the early 1990s, 
increased development led to a reduction in CIWB for Non-OECD nations in Africa, 
but in more recent years the relationship changed, becoming less sustainable. 
For the samples of Non-OECD nations in Asia and Latin America, we find that 
economic development increased consumption-based CIWB, and increasingly so 
throughout the 19 year period of study.
