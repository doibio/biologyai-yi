16 years. Our best estimate of the IRR from MSD-related research was 7%, which 
is similar to the 9% for CVD and 10% for cancer research.
CONCLUSIONS: Our estimate of the IRR from the net health gain to public and 
charitable funding of MSD-related research in the United Kingdom is substantial, 
and justifies the research investments made between 1978 and 1997. We also 
demonstrated the applicability of the approach previously used in assessing the 
returns from cardiovascular and cancer research. Inevitably, with a study of 
this kind, there are a number of important assumptions and caveats that we 
highlight, and these can inform future research.

BACKGROUND: Ontologies are commonly used to annotate and help process life 
sciences data. Although their original goal is to facilitate integration and 
interoperability among heterogeneous data sources, when these sources are 
annotated with distinct ontologies, bridging this gap can be challenging. In the 
last decade, ontology matching systems have been evolving and are now capable of 
producing high-quality mappings for life sciences ontologies, usually limited to 
the equivalence between two ontologies. However, life sciences research is 
becoming increasingly transdisciplinary and integrative, fostering the need to 
develop matching strategies that are able to handle multiple ontologies and more 
complex relations between their concepts.
RESULTS: We have developed ontology matching algorithms that are able to find 
compound mappings between multiple biomedical ontologies, in the form of ternary 
mappings, finding for instance that "aortic valve stenosis"(HP:0001650) is 
equivalent to the intersection between "aortic valve"(FMA:7236) and 
"constricted" (PATO:0001847). The algorithms take advantage of search space 
filtering based on partial mappings between ontology pairs, to be able to handle 
the increased computational demands. The evaluation of the algorithms has shown 
that they are able to produce meaningful results, with precision in the range of 
60-92% for new mappings. The algorithms were also applied to the potential 
extension of logical definitions of the OBO and the matching of several 
plant-related ontologies.
CONCLUSIONS: This work is a first step towards finding more complex relations 
between multiple ontologies. The evaluation shows that the results produced are 
significant and that the algorithms could satisfy specific integration needs.

INTRODUCTION: The STRoke Interactive Virtual thErapy (STRIVE) intervention 
provides community-dwelling stroke survivors access to individualised, remotely 
supervised progressive exercise training via an online platform. This trial aims 
to determine the clinical efficacy of the STRIVE intervention and its effect on 
brain activity in community-dwelling stroke survivors.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a multisite, assessor-blinded randomised controlled 
trial, 60 stroke survivors >3 months poststroke with mild-to-moderate upper 
extremity impairment will be recruited and equally randomised by location 
(Melbourne, Victoria or Launceston, Tasmania) to receive 8 weeks of virtual 
therapy (VT) at a local exercise training facility or usual care. Participants 
allocated to VT will perform 3-5 upper limb exercises individualised to their 
impairment severity and preference, while participants allocated to usual care 
will be asked to maintain their usual daily activities. The primary outcome 
measures will be upper limb motor function and impairment, which will be 
assessed using the Action Research Arm Test and Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer, 
respectively. Secondary outcome measures include upper extremity function and 
spasticity, as measured by the box and block test and Modified AshworthScale, 
respectively, and task-related changes in bilateral sensorimotor cortex 
haemodynamics during hand reaching and wrist extension movements as measured by 
functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Quality of life will be measured using 
the Euro-Quality of Life-5 Dimension-5 Level Scale, and the Motor Activity 
Log-28 will be used to measure use of the hemiparetic arm. All measures will be 
assessed at baseline and immediately postintervention.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Deakin University Human 
Research Ethics Committee in May 2017 (No. 2017-087). The results will be 
disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at major international 
stroke meetings.

Parafunctional behaviors, especially bruxism, are not uncommon among patient 
visiting dentists' clinics daily and they constitute a major dental issue for 
almost all dentists. Many researchers have focused on the definition, 
pathophysiology, and treatment of these behaviors. These parafunctional 
behaviors have a considerable negative impact on teeth and dental prothesis. In 
this review, we focused on the impact of parafunctional behaviors on dental 
bridges. We summarized the definitions, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and 
consequences of parafunctional behaviors. In addition, we reviewed previous 
dental literature studies that demonstrated the effect of bruxism or other 
parafunctional behaviors on dental bridges and dental prothesis. In conclusion, 
parafunctional behaviors are common involuntary movements involving the 
masticatory system. They are more prevalent among children. These behaviors have 
deleterious effects on dental structures. Causes of parafunctional behaviors 
include anxiety, depression, smoking, caffeine intake, sleep disorders, or 
central neurotransmitter dysfunction. Bruxism and other similar masticatory 
system activity cause dental fracture, loss, and weardown of enamel or teeth. 
They can also affect different types of dental protheses both fixed and 
removable types. Parafunctional behaviors shorten the life expectancy of these 
protheses, and damage residual dentition and denture-bearing tissues.

STEMI Due to Big Ostial Left Main Thrombus Extending Into Aorta: Challenging 
Situation With No Clear Guidelines.

Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.

Extensive left main (LM) coronary artery thrombus is a rare and life-threatening 
angiographic finding with usual dramatic clinical presentation including 
hemodynamic instability and sudden cardiac death. The proper management of a big 
LM thrombus extending into aorta remains a challenging issue with no clear 
guidelines. In the following case report we present a 45-year-old patient with 
no apparent risk factors for coronary artery disease who presented with acute 
infero-lateral ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The examination was 
performed using a right transfemoral approach and it revealed the presence of a 
large mobile, hazy mass within the left main coronary artery (LMCA) extending 
into the aorta. To confirm the extension of that structure we performed 
intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) which revealed a circumferential mass in the 
LMCA extending with its two-thirds into the aorta with no evidence of 
atherosclerotic plaques. After a long discussion within our Heart team we 
decided to transfer the patient for urgent surgical removal. Such decision was 
made with regard to the large size of the mass and in order to avoid systemic or 
distal embolization into coronary arteries. Perioperative transesophageal 
echocardiography (TEE) confirmed diagnosis and excluded presence of patent 
foramen ovale (PFO). Surgical removal was done successfully with complete 
resolution of ST-segment elevation and rapid fall of cardiac enzymes to normal 
levels. Postoperative course was uneventful. The mass was defined as a thrombus 
by pathophysiology examination. Patient was discharged well from our hospital 
after 1 week.

Heart failure (HF) is a common health problem worldwide, including in Japan. 
Unfortunately, patient outcomes remain poor, with a 5-year survival rate of 
approximately 50%. Therefore, we need to assess the precise conditions, 
including cardiac function, in patients with HF, particularly in the elderly. We 
performed a multifaceted assessment in an elderly patient with HF on admission 
and at discharge using eight different evaluations (the mean life expectancy 
using the Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM), the severity of dementia, 
nutrition, medication adherence, biomarker (the level of brain natriuretic 
peptide in blood), sociality, performance and comorbidity). Each parameter was 
scored on a 5-point scale (excellent = 5 points; good = 4 points; fair (average) 
= 3 points; poor = 2 points; failure = 1 point; maximum total points of 40) 
(Fukuoka University Heart Failure Scoring System, FUFS). An 86-year-old male 
patient who complained of dyspnea and lower-leg edema was admitted to our 
university hospital due to acute decompensated HF. After treatment, his symptoms 
improved, as did his cardiothoracic ratio, plural effusion and pulmonary 
congestion, and he exhibited compensated HF. His total score improved from 28 to 
32 points, and his mean life expectancy using SHFM increased from 4.9 to 5.4 
years. We evaluated the precise conditions using a multifaceted assessment 
strategy in an elderly patient with HF. The strategy was useful for evaluate the 
patient's condition in this case.

Poly-de-prescribing to treat polypharmacy: efficacy and safety.

Garfinkel D(1).

Author information:

Homecare hospice, Israel Cancer Association, Israel.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of 
poly-de-prescribing (PDP) based on the Garfinkel method in older people with 
polypharmacy.
METHODS: A longitudinal, prospective, nonrandomized study in Israel was carried 
out between 2009 and 2016. Comprehensive geriatric assessments were performed at 
home in people age ⩾66 years consuming ⩾6 prescription drugs. Exclusion criteria 
were life expectancy <6 months and a seeming unwillingness to cooperate (poor 
compliance). PDP of ⩾3 prescription drugs was recommended. Follow up was at ⩾3 
years. Between April 2015 and April 2016 Likert scale questionnaires were filled 
by all participants/families to evaluate overall satisfaction and clinical 
outcomes. The outcome measures were change in functional, mental and cognitive 
status, sleep quality, appetite, continence; major complication, 
hospitalizations, mortality, and family doctor's cooperation.
RESULTS: Poly-de-prescribing of ⩾3 drugs was eventually achieved by 122 
participants (PDP group); ⩽2 drugs stopped by 55 'nonresponders' (NR group). The 
average age was 83.4 ± 5.3 in the PDP group, and 80.8 ± 6.3 in the NR group (p = 
0.0045). Follow up was 43.6 ± 14 months (PDP) and 39.5 ± 16.6 months (NR) (p = 
0.09). The prevalence of most diseases/symptoms was comparable except for a 
higher prevalence for dementia, incontinence and functional decline in the PDP 
group. The main barrier to de-prescribing was the family doctor's unwillingness 
to adopt PDP recommendations (p < 0.0001). The baseline median number of 
medications taken by both groups was 10 (IQR 8 to 12) (p = 0.55). On the last 
follow up, the drug count was 11 (IQR 8 to 12) in the NR group and 4 (IQR 2 to 
5) in the PDP group (p =0.0001). The PDP group showed significantly less 
deterioration (sometimes improvement) in general satisfaction, functional, 
mental and cognitive status, sleep quality, appetite, sphincter control, and the 
number of major complications was significantly reduced (p < 0.002 in all). The 
rate of hospitalizations and mortality was comparable. Health improvement 
occurred within 3 months after de-prescribing in 83%, and persisted for ⩾2 years 
in 68%.
CONCLUSIONS: This self-selected sample longitudinal research strongly suggests 
that the negative, usually invisible effects of polypharmacy are reversible. PDP 
is well tolerated and associated with improved clinical outcomes, in comparison 
with outcomes of older people who adhere to all clinical guidelines and take all 
medications conventionally. Future double-blind studies will probably prove 
beneficial economic outcomes as well.

The prevalence of obesity has grown steadily in recent years, making it almost 
an epidemic. Obesity is a chronic condition whose prognosis is burdened by 
severe comorbidities. Both the quality of life and the life expectancy are 
affected. The medical management of morbid obesity is still the rule, but 
surgical practices are developing rapidly. While bariatric surgery in adults is 
common and gives excellent results, in adolescents, its practice is less 
prevalent. Beyond issues specific to this developmental period, this question 
raises ethical issues. In this context, the pluridiscplinary team faces diverse 
determinants and challenges and the child and adolescent psychiatrist (CAP) is, 
the psychiatrist is summoned for psychopathological aspects but also for 
embarrassing questions. In this work, we are going to specify the role of the 
CAP in the practice of bariatric surgery.

Publisher: L’obésité dont la prévalence n’a cessé de croître ces dernières 
années, est en passe de devenir une véritable épidémie. Affection chronique, le 
pronostic de l’obésité morbide est grevé de co- morbidités sévères altérant la 
qualité de vie des patients et amputant leur espérance de vie. Les prises en 
charge diététique et médicale restent les plus répandues. Cependant, les 
pratiques chirurgicales n’ont cessé de se développer. Alors que la chirurgie 
bariatrique chez l’adulte est devenue courante, sa pratique chez l’adolescent 
est moins fréquente et se prête moins à la banalisation. Au-delà des enjeux 
développe- mentaux spécifiques à la période particulière qu’est l’adolescence, 
cette question soulève des considérations éthiques et suscite des 
positionnements extrêmes. Dans ce contexte aux déterminants flous et aux enjeux 
tant sociétaux que médicaux, le pédopsychiatre peut être convoqué, au-delà de la 
question psycho- pathologique, pour statuer sur des questions relevant plus de 
la morale que de la science. Nous nous attèlerons donc, au long de ce travail, à 
définir les différents objets de soins somatiques ou psychiques qui rassemblent 
les praticiens de différents bords au chevet de l’obésité et à expliciter la 
fonction psy dans ces prises en charge.

BACKGROUND: Caesarean section is associated with blood loss and maternal 
morbidity. Excessive blood loss requires transfusion of donor (allogeneic) 
blood, which is a finite resource. Cell salvage returns blood lost during 
surgery to the mother. It may avoid the need for donor blood transfusion, but 
reliable evidence of its effects is lacking.
OBJECTIVES: To determine if routine use of cell salvage during caesarean section 
in mothers at risk of haemorrhage reduces the rates of blood transfusion and 
postpartum maternal morbidity, and is cost-effective, in comparison with 
standard practice without routine salvage use.
DESIGN: Individually randomised controlled, multicentre trial with 
cost-effectiveness analysis. Treatment was not blinded.
SETTING: A total of 26 UK obstetric units.
PARTICIPANTS: Out of 3054 women recruited between June 2013 and April 2016, we 
randomly assigned 3028 women at risk of haemorrhage to cell salvage or routine 
care. Randomisation was stratified using random permuted blocks of variable 
sizes. Of these, 1672 had emergency and 1356 had elective caesareans. We 
excluded women for whom cell salvage or donor blood transfusion was 
contraindicated.
INTERVENTIONS: Cell salvage (intervention) versus routine care without salvage 
(control). In the intervention group, salvage was set up in 95.6% of the women 
and, of these, 50.8% had salvaged blood returned. In the control group, 3.9% had 
salvage deployed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary - donor blood transfusion. Secondary - units of 
donor blood transfused, time to mobilisation, length of hospitalisation, mean 
fall in haemoglobin, fetomaternal haemorrhage (FMH) measured by Kleihauer-Betke 
test, and maternal fatigue. Analyses were adjusted for stratification factors 
and other factors that were believed to be prognostic a priori. 
Cost-effectiveness outcomes - costs of resources and service provision taking 
the UK NHS perspective.
RESULTS: We analysed 1498 and 1492 participants in the intervention and control 
groups, respectively. Overall, the transfusion rate was 2.5% in the intervention 
group and 3.5% in the control group [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.65, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 1.01; p = 0.056]. In a planned subgroup 
analysis, the transfusion rate was 3.0% in the intervention group and 4.6% in 
the control group among emergency caesareans (adjusted OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.34 to 
0.99), whereas it was 1.8% in the intervention group and 2.2% in the control 
group among elective caesareans (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.83) 
(interaction p = 0.46, suggesting that the difference in effect between 
subgroups was not statistically significant). Secondary outcomes did not differ 
between groups, except for FMH, which was higher under salvage in rhesus D 
(RhD)-negative women with RhD-positive babies (25.6% vs. 10.5%, adjusted OR 
5.63, 95% CI 1.43 to 22.14; p = 0.013). No case of amniotic fluid embolism was 
observed. The additional cost of routine cell salvage during caesarean was 
estimated, on average, at £8110 per donor blood transfusion avoided.
CONCLUSIONS: The modest evidence for an effect of routine use of cell salvage 
during caesarean section on rates of donor blood transfusion was associated with 
increased FMH, which emphasises the need for adherence to guidance on anti-D 
prophylaxis. We are unable to comment on long-term antibody sensitisation 
effects. Based on the findings of this trial, cell salvage is unlikely to be 
considered cost-effective.
FUTURE WORK: Research into risk of alloimmunisation among women exposed to cell 
salvage is needed.

When, how often and for how long organisms mate can have strong consequences for 
individual fitness and are crucial aspects of evolutionary ecology. Such 
determinants are likely to be of even greater importance in monandrous species 
and species with short adult life stages. Previous work suggests that mobility, 
a key dispersal-related trait, may affect the dynamics of copulations, but few 
studies have investigated the impact of individual mobility on mating latency, 
copulation duration and oviposition latency simultaneously. In this paper, we 
monitored the copulation dynamics of 40 males and 40 females, as well as the 
oviposition dynamics of the females of the Large White butterfly Pieris 
brassicae, a facultative long-distance disperser butterfly. Individuals from a 
breeding were selected to create a uniform distribution of mobility and we 
recorded the timing, number and duration of all copulations in a 
semiexperimental system. We showed that mobility, measured as the time spent in 
flight under stressful conditions (a proxy of dispersal tendency), correlates 
with all aspects of copulation dynamics: mobile males and females mated earlier 
and for shorter periods than less mobile individuals. In turn, late mating 
females increased the time between copulation and oviposition. These results 
feed the previously described mobility syndrome of P. brassicae, involving 
morphological and physiological characters, with life-history traits. We suggest 
that the reduction of mating latency and copulation duration has an adaptive 
value in dispersing individuals, as their life expectancy might be shorter than 
that of sedentary individuals.

462. Costs and Benefits from Replacing Thrombolysis with Percutaneous Coronary 
Intervention (PCI) [Internet].

Halvorsen S, Kristiansen IS, Linnestad K, Myhre KI, Selmer R, Wisløff T.

Oslo, Norway: Knowledge Centre for the Health Services at The Norwegian 
Institute of Public Health (NIPH); 2004. Report from Norwegian Knowledge Centre 
for the Health Services (NOKC) No. 03-2004.
NIPH Systematic Reviews: Executive Summaries.

Background Previous studies have shown that Percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI) is a better treatment than thrombolysis for patients with acute myocardial 
infarction admitted to an invasive centre. However, the economic consequences of 
PCI as the primary strategy has not yet been assessed. One should also consider 
different strategies when there is a long distance from local hospital to the 
centre offering PCI. The aim of the study was to explore the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of PCI. Methods Based on a systematic review of clinical 
trials, we developed a state-transition model that follows patients from when 
they develop an acute ST-elevation infarction until they die. The model 
encompassed events (re-infarction, stroke, medical interventions, etc.) and 
health states (sequalae stroke, heart failure, angina, well, and death). 
Transition probabilities and utilisation of health care were taken from the 
systematic review, population statistics, and expert judgement. Unit costs were 
based on market prices, DRG charges, and reimbursement schedules. One-way 
sensitivity analyses and Monte-Carlo-simulations were undertaken to explore 
uncertainty. Results For a 65-year old man living close to a PCI unit, life 
expectancy was 8.3 years with PCI and 7.6 with thrombolysis, while lifetime 
costs were 162 000 NOK and 234 000 NOK., respectively. For patients who would 
need helicopter ambulance to get to a PCI unit, the expected costs were NOK 192 
000 for PCI (all costs undiscounted). In sensitivity analyses PCI entailed lower 
costs and greater health benefits for any realistic change in the parameters. 
Conclusion PCI seems to entail greater health benefits at lower costs than 
thrombolysis whether the patients live close to PCI hospital or not. The 
conclusion is unchanged after sensitivity analysis. However, a change to primary 
PCI as a strategy will have consequences for personnel and organisation of the 
health care system. These secondary consequences have not been considered in 
these analyses. In clinical practice combined strategies are actual, that is 
thrombolysis in ambulance or in local hospital before sending the patient to an 
invasive centre for PCI. For the present, the clinical data supporting an 
analysis of combined strategies are still too weak to be analysed by our model. 
When more robust data are available, it is possible to modify the model to 
include combinations.

463. Effect of Long-Term Mechanical Ventilation (LTMV) Part 1 – Neuromuscular
Disease  or Central Respiratory Failure [Internet].

Brurberg KG, Landmark B, Kirkehei I, Reinar LM.

Oslo, Norway: Knowledge Centre for the Health Services at The Norwegian 
Institute of Public Health (NIPH); 2012 Dec. Report from Norwegian Knowledge 
Centre for the Health Services (NOKC) No. 13-2012.
NIPH Systematic Reviews: Executive Summaries.

Patients who fail to maintain adequate respiration may need long-term mechanical 
ventilation (LTMV) in shorter or longer periods. Patients using LTMV constitute 
a heterogeneous group with respect to age, diagnoses and disease progression. 
Norwegian data suggests considerable regional differences in the use of LTMV. 
Commission The Norwegian Directorate of Health recently prepared new guidelines 
for the use of LTMV outside hospitals. The Norwegian Knowledge Centre for Health 
Services was commissioned to prepare a systematic review on the efficacy of 
LTMV. This is the first of three reviews, and here we summarize evidence on the 
effectiveness of LTMV for patients with neuromuscular disorders and for patients 
with central respiratory failure. Main results: LTMV may be associated with some 
degree of life extension and improved quality of life for patients with 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, at least for patients with good bulbar function. 
The quality of evidence is low, and it is not possible to draw firm conclusions 
about the real effect. LTMV can be associated with life extension among 
hypoventilated patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but the quality of 
evidence is low, and it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the real 
effect. Across patients with various neuromuscular diagnoses, it seems that LTMV 
may be associated with fewer hospital admissions, and that invasive LTMV is 
associated with greater risk of complications and hospitalization than 
non-invasive LTMV. The quality of evidence is low, and we can not draw firm 
conclusions about the real effect. For some diagnoses, for example central 
respiratory failure, we were not able to identify any research fulfilling our 
inclusion criteria.

464. Intravenous Thrombolytic Treatment After Acute Stroke and Secondary 
Antithrombotic Prevention Treatment (Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Treatment) 
After Stroke [Internet].

Wisløff T, Hamidi V, Ringerike T, Harboe I, Klemp M.

Institute of Public Health (NIPH); 2010 Dec. Report from Norwegian Knowledge 
Centre for the Health Services (NOKC) No. 22-2010.
NIPH Systematic Reviews: Executive Summaries.

Background Stroke is the third most common cause of death, a major cause of 
severe disability and accounts for considerable consumption of healthcare 
resources. Which medication should be chosen for the treatment of stroke depends 
on several factors, including efficiency and price. Task requirement The 
Norwegian Directorate of Health’s development groups for the preparation of 
national clinical guideline for stroke have commissioned the Norwegian Knowledge 
Centre for the Health Services to conduct economic evaluations of some central 
recommendations in the stroke guideline. We evaluated the clinical efficacy and 
conducted health economic evaluation of: 1. Intravenous thrombolytic treatment 
of patients with acute stroke (within 3 hours and between 3 to 5 hours after 
symptom onset) in addition to standard treatment compared to treatment without 
thrombolysis 2. Pharmacological secondary prevention of stroke: Antiplatelet 
therapy: acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) combined with slow-release dipyridamole 
compared with ASA monotherapy. Antiplatelet therapy: ASA combined with 
slow-release dipyridamole compared with clopidogrel monotherapy. Anticoagulation 
therapy with warfarin compared with ASA for prophylaxis of stroke in patients 
with atrial fibrillation. Main Results: Thrombolytic treatment within 3 hours 
after stoke reduces lifetime costs and adds quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
compared with standard treatment without thrombolysis for selected stroke 
patients. Thrombolysis given between 3 and 5 hours after stroke is 
cost-effective compared to no thrombolytic treatment. However, the choice of 
thrombolysis in this time interval should also be carefully considered from an 
ethical perspective, because it leads to shorter life expectancy relative to no 
thrombolytic treatment. The combination of ASA and extended-release dipyridamole 
increases QALYs and reduces lifetime costs compared with ASA monotherapy in 
secondary prevention of stroke. The use of ASA combined with slow-release 
dipyridamole for patients of 70 years reduces lifetime costs and adds QALYs 
compared to clopidogrel for secondary prevention of stroke. Anticoagulation 
therapy with warfarin has lower expected costs and higher expected QALYs 
compared with ASA therapy for stroke patients with atrial fibrillation.

A wide range of rheumatic and peripheral nervous system disorders may develop in 
patients with HIV infection, leading to pain, sensory symptoms, and muscle 
weakness. Over the past three decades, the progress in management of HIV disease 
with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in increased life expectancy for 
people living with HIV disease. With this new chronicity of the disease has a 
constellation of chronic musculoskeletal, orthopaedic and rheumatic 
manifestations has emerged, as potential complications of the disease itself 
and/or the results of ART treatment regimen and/or because of expected 
age-related symptoms/manifestations. The incidence of CTS in the general 
population is around 3.8% with clinical examination and, when 
electroneuromyography is used, it is 2.7%. In the HIV-positive population, the 
incidence is very close to that of the general population. The aim of this study 
was to evaluate the incidence of CTS and to identify factors influencing the 
development of CTS in HIV-infected patients attending our clinic. This syndrome 
has been associated with advanced HIV disease and the use of ART possibly due to 
an increased inflammatory state and the presence of concurrent HCV infection.

Health technology assessment provides a common framework for evaluating the 
costs and benefits of new health technologies to inform decisions on the public 
funding of new pharmaceuticals and other health technologies. In Australia and 
England, empirical analyses of the opportunity costs of government spending on 
new health technologies suggest more quality adjusted life years are being 
forgone than are being gained by a non-trivial proportion of funded health 
technologies. This essay considers the relevance of available empirical 
estimates of opportunity costs and explores the relationship between the public 
funding of health technologies and broader political and economic factors. We 
conclude that the benefits of a general reduction in the prices paid by 
governments for new technologies outweigh the costs, but evidence of informed 
public acceptance of reduced access to new health technologies may be required 
to shift the current approach to assessing the value of new health technologies.

AIMS: This paper evaluates the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Ireland, and 
estimates the associated direct, indirect, and intangible costs to society based 
on a large nationally representative sample.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was developed to capture the 
demographics, disease characteristics, healthcare use, informal care, 
employment, and wellbeing. Referencing international studies, standardized 
survey instruments were included (e.g. CSRI, MFIS-5, EQ-5D) or adapted (EDSS) 
for inclusion in an online survey platform. Recruitment was directed at people 
with MS via the MS Society mailing list and social media platforms, as well as 
in traditional media. The economic costing was primarily conducted using a 
'bottom-up' methodology, and national estimates were achieved using 
'prevalence-based' extrapolation.
RESULTS: A total of 594 people completed the survey in full. The sample had 
geographic, disease, and demographic characteristics indicating good 
representativeness. At an individual level, average societal cost was estimated 
at €47,683; the average annual costs for those with mild, moderate, and severe 
MS were calculated as €34,942, €57,857, and €100,554, respectively. For a total 
Irish MS population of 9,000, the total societal costs of MS amounted to €429m. 
Direct costs accounted for just 30% of the total societal costs, indirect costs 
amounted to 50% of the total, and intangible or QoL costs represented 20%. The 
societal cost associated with a relapse in the sample is estimated as €2,438.
LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight that up to 70% of the total 
costs associated with MS are not routinely counted. These "hidden" costs are 
higher in Ireland than the rest of Europe, due in part to significantly lower 
levels of workforce participation, a higher likelihood of permanent workforce 
withdrawal, and higher levels of informal care needs. The relationship between 
disease progression and costs emphasize the societal importance of managing and 
slowing the progression of the illness.

Comment in
    BMJ Evid Based Med. 2018 Dec;23(6):235-236.

BACKGROUND: The use of cardiovascular medication for the primary prevention of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) is potentially inappropriate when potential risks 
outweigh the potential benefits. It is unknown whether deprescribing preventive 
cardiovascular medication in patients without a strict indication for such 
medication is safe and cost-effective in general practice.
METHODS: In this pragmatic cluster randomised controlled non-inferiority trial, 
we recruited 46 general practices in the Netherlands. Patients aged 40-70 years 
who were using antihypertensive and/or lipid-lowering drugs without CVD and with 
low risk of future CVD were followed for 2 years. The intervention was an 
attempt to deprescribe preventive cardiovascular medication. The primary outcome 
was the difference in the increase in predicted (10-year) CVD risk in the 
per-protocol (PP) population with a non-inferiority margin of 2.5 percentage 
points. An economic evaluation was performed in the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
population. We used multilevel (generalised) linear regression with multiple 
imputation of missing data.
RESULTS: Of 1067 participants recruited between 7 November 2012 and 18 February 
2014, 72% were female. Overall, their mean age was 55 years and their mean 
predicted CVD risk at baseline was 5%. Of 492 participants in the ITT 
intervention group, 319 (65%) quit the medication (PP intervention group); 135 
(27%) of those participants were still not taking medication after 2 years. The 
predicted CVD risk increased by 2.0 percentage points in the PP intervention 
group compared to 1.9 percentage points in the usual care group. The difference 
of 0.1 (95% CI -0.3 to 0.6) fell within the non-inferiority margin. After 2 
years, compared to the usual care group, for the PP intervention group, systolic 
blood pressure was 6 mmHg higher, diastolic blood pressure was 4 mmHg higher and 
total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were both 7 
mg/dl higher (all P < 0.05). Cost and quality-adjusted life years did not differ 
between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the ECSTATIC study show that an attempt to 
deprescribe preventive cardiovascular medication in low-CVD-risk patients is 
safe in the short term when blood pressure and cholesterol levels are monitored 
after stopping. An attempt to deprescribe medication can be considered, taking 
patient preferences into consideration.

Aging impacts diseases and lifespan. With current knowledge of stem cells, it is 
feasible to design and test interventions that delay aging and improve both 
health and lifespan. Stem cells, together with anti-aging genes such as Klotho, 
play a crucial role in delaying the aging process. Stem cells in combination 
with anti-aging genes make a complex and protective shield, which stand against 
the eroding effects of aging. Increased wear and tear of the stem cells, as well 
as Klotho deficiency, is expected to heavily increase cellular damage and 
accelerate the process of aging. Stem cells in conjugation with anti-aging genes 
probably receive and neutralize most of the devastating signaling effects which 
are known to cause premature aging. The shield of stem cells combined with 
anti-aging genes is a primary target for absorbing the shock of aging. If this 
shield neutralizes the shocks, it could lead to a youthful state, but if not it 
will accelerate the aging journey. In this review, we concisely discuss the 
neutralizing ability, operated and regulated by stem cells and other 
life-extension factors. We suggest that stem cell interventions that increase 
rejuvenation and keep in balance the expression of anti-aging genes could delay 
the aging phenotypes and result in prolonged lifespan.

Against proportional shortfall as a priority-setting principle.

Altmann S.

As the demand for healthcare rises, so does the need for priority setting in 
healthcare. In this paper, I consider a prominent priority-setting principle: 
proportional shortfall. My purpose is to argue that proportional shortfall, as a 
principle, should not be adopted. My key criticism is that proportional 
shortfall fails to consider past health.Proportional shortfall is justified as 
it supposedly balances concern for prospective health while still accounting for 
lifetime health, even though past health is deemed irrelevant. Accounting for 
this lifetime perspective means that the principle may indirectly consider past 
health by accounting for how far an individual is from achieving a complete, 
healthy life. I argue that proportional shortfall does not account for this 
lifetime perspective as it fails to incorporate the fair innings argument as 
originally claimed, undermining its purported justification.I go on to 
demonstrate that the case for ignoring past health is weak, and argue that past 
health is at least sometimes relevant for priority-setting decisions. 
Specifically, when an individual's past health has a direct impact on current or 
future health, and when one individual has enjoyed significantly more healthy 
life years than another.Finally, I demonstrate that by ignoring past illnesses, 
even those entirely unrelated to their current illness, proportional shortfall 
can lead to instances of double jeopardy, a highly problematic implication. 
These arguments give us reason to reject proportional shortfall.

A new arena in cardiac surgery: Pediatric coronary artery bypass surgery.

Kitamura S(1).

Author information:
(1)National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center.

Prior to the 1970s, pediatric coronary artery bypass surgery (PCABS) was 
seldomly performed due to the lack of compelling surgical indications. The 
advent of coronary sequelae secondary to Kawasaki disease (KD) and the 
occurrence of coronary artery complications due to newly developed procedures, 
such as the arterial switch operation and early repair for intrinsic congenital 
coronary malformations, necessitated the development of PCABS. Because children 
grow rapidly and their life expectancy is very long, with increasing exercise 
capability requirements, the strategy for PCABS should differ from that for 
bypass surgery in adults. PCABS utilizing unilateral and bilateral internal 
thoracic arteries (ITA) has become the most reliable surgical method for 
children because of the distinct structure of ITAs being resistant to KD, growth 
potential according to the child's somatic growth and long-term patency without 
wall degeneration. This operation utilizing ITA grafts is now being performed 
worldwide and is referred to as the "Kitamura operation" for KD coronary 
sequelae. Notably, the use of vein grafts should be avoided in children. 
Likewise, this operation can now be successfully performed in infants using a 
surgical microscope, for congenital coronary disorders. Currently, PCABS with 
ITAs has been established as a new arena in cardiac surgery, following our 
initial attempts.
