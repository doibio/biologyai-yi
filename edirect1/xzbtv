BACKGROUND: For liver transplant recipients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, recurrence after LT is 
associated with a higher risk of graft loss than for HCV mono-infected patients. 
Prior HCV treatment options were limited by side effects and drug-drug 
interactions.
AIM: To evaluate treatment outcomes with sofosbuvir (SOF)-based therapy among 
HIV/HCV coinfected liver transplant recipients.
METHODS: Access to SOF and ribavirin (RBV) prior to regulatory approval was 
attained via an international compassionate access program for transplant 
recipients with a life expectancy of 1 year or less in the absence of HCV 
treatment. This report focuses on the short and longer term outcomes in HCV-HIV 
co-infected liver transplant recipients.
RESULTS: Twenty patients were treated, nine with early severe recurrence and 11 
with cirrhosis. Eleven patients received SOF and RBV, one SOF, RBV and 
Peg-interferon, three SOF, RBV and simeprevir and five SOF, RBV and daclatasvir. 
Of the 18 patients who completed treatment, 16 (89%) achieved sustained 
virological response 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). Liver function 
tests (including bilirubin and albumin) improved significantly over time. 
Nineteen serious adverse events occurred in eight (40%) patients, none of them 
related to SOF. Two patients died during treatment and another, 1 year after the 
end of therapy, due to progressive end-stage liver disease. Importantly, HIV 
suppression was not compromised. No significant drug-drug interactions were 
reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Sofosbuvir-based regimens are safe, well-tolerated and provide high 
rates of SVR in HCV-HIV co-infected patients with severe recurrence after-liver 
transplant.

Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) is a rare but serious group of diseases that 
require critical decision-making for curative treatment. Over the past decade, 
scientific discovery has revealed dozens of prognostic gene mutations for AML 
while sequencing costs have plummeted. In this study, we compared the 
cost-effectiveness of multigene integrative analysis (genomic analysis) with the 
standard molecular testing currently used for diagnosis of intermediate-risk 
AML. We used a decision analytic model with data for costs and outcomes from 
British Columbia, Canada, to assess the long-term (10-year) economic impacts. 
Our results suggest that genomic analysis would result in a 26% increase in the 
use of first-remission allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The resulting 
treatment decisions and downstream effects would come at an additional cost of 
$12 556 [2013 Canadian dollars (CAD)] per person and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio would be $49 493 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. 
Cost-effectiveness was dependent on quality of life during the long-term (5-10) 
years of survival, relapse rates following first-remission chemotherapy and the 
upfront cost of transplantation. Non-relapse mortality rates, short-term quality 
of life and the cost of genomic sequencing had only minor impacts. Further 
research on post-remission outcomes can lead to improvements in the 
cost-effectiveness of curative treatments for AML.

Palliative Therapy for Gastric Outlet Obstruction Caused by Unresectable Gastric 
Cancer: A Meta-analysis Comparison of Gastrojejunostomy with Endoscopic 
Stenting.

Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.

BACKGROUND: Gastrojejunostomy (GJJ) and endoscopic stenting (ES) are palliative 
treatments for gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) caused by gastric cancer. We 
compared the outcomes of GJJ with ES by performing a meta-analysis.
METHODS: Clinical trials that compared GJJ with ES for the treatment of GOO in 
gastric cancer were included in the meta-analysis. Procedure time, time to 
resumption of oral intake, duration of hospital stay, patency duration, and 
overall survival days were compared using weighted mean differences (WMDs). 
Technical success, clinical success, procedure-related mortality, complications, 
the rate of re-obstruction, postoperative chemotherapy, and reintervention were 
compared using odds ratios (OR s).
RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the analysis. Technical success and 
clinical success were not significantly different between the ES and GJJ groups. 
The ES group had a shorter procedure time (WMD = -80.89 min, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = -93.99 to -67.78,P < 0.001), faster resumption of oral intake 
(WMD = -3.45 days, 95% CI = -5.25 to -1.65,P < 0.001), and shorter duration of 
hospital stay (WMD = -7.67 days, 95% CI = -11.02 to -4.33,P < 0.001). The rate 
of minor complications was significantly higher in the GJJ group (OR = 0.13, 95% 
CI = 0.04-0.40,P < 0.001). However, the rates of major complications (OR = 6.91, 
95% CI = 3.90-12.25,P < 0.001), re-obstruction (OR= 7.75, 95% CI = 4.06-14.78,P 
< 0.001), and reintervention (OR= 6.27, 95% CI = 3.36-11.68,P < 0.001) were 
significantly lower in the GJJ group than that in the ES group. Moreover, GJJ 
was significantly associated with a longer patency duration (WMD = -167.16 days, 
95% CI = -254.01 to -89.31,P < 0.001) and overall survival (WMD = -103.20 days, 
95% CI = -161.49 to -44.91, P= 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Both GJJ and ES are effective procedures for the treatment of GOO 
caused by gastric cancer. ES is associated with better short-term outcomes. GJJ 
is preferable to ES in terms of its lower rate of stent-related complications, 
re-obstruction, and reintervention. GJJ should be considered a treatment option 
for patients with a long life expectancy and good performance status.

Minimal Residual Disease Evaluation in Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: 
An Economic Analysis.

Health Quality Ontario.

Collaborators: Gajic-Veljanoski O, Pham B, Pechlivanoglou P, Krahn M, Higgins C, 
Bielecki J.

BACKGROUND: Minimal residual disease (MRD) testing by higher performance 
techniques such as flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be 
used to detect the proportion of remaining leukemic cells in bone marrow or 
peripheral blood during and after the first phases of chemotherapy in children 
with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The results of MRD testing are used to 
reclassify these patients and guide changes in treatment according to their 
future risk of relapse. We conducted a systematic review of the economic 
literature, cost-effectiveness analysis, and budget-impact analysis to ascertain 
the cost-effectiveness and economic impact of MRD testing by flow cytometry for 
management of childhood precursor B-cell ALL in Ontario.
METHODS: A systematic literature search (1998-2014) identified studies that 
examined the incremental cost-effectiveness of MRD testing by either flow 
cytometry or PCR. We developed a lifetime state-transition (Markov) 
microsimulation model to quantify the cost-effectiveness of MRD testing followed 
by risk-directed therapy to no MRD testing and to estimate its marginal effect 
on health outcomes and on costs. Model input parameters were based on the 
literature, expert opinion, and data from the Pediatric Oncology Group of 
Ontario Networked Information System. Using predictions from our Markov model, 
we estimated the 1-year cost burden of MRD testing versus no testing and 
forecasted its economic impact over 3 and 5 years.
RESULTS: In a base-case cost-effectiveness analysis, compared with no testing, 
MRD testing by flow cytometry at the end of induction and consolidation was 
associated with an increased discounted survival of 0.0958 quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and increased discounted costs of $4,180, yielding an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $43,613/QALY gained. After 
accounting for parameter uncertainty, incremental cost-effectiveness of MRD 
testing was associated with an ICER of $50,249/QALY gained. In the budget-impact 
analysis, the 1-year cost expenditure for MRD testing by flow cytometry in newly 
diagnosed patients with precursor B-cell ALL was estimated at $340,760. We 
forecasted that the province would have to pay approximately $1.3 million over 3 
years and $2.4 million over 5 years for MRD testing by flow cytometry in this 
population.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with no testing, MRD testing by flow cytometry in newly 
diagnosed patients with precursor B-cell ALL represents good value for money at 
commonly used willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY.

Nathalal Parekh Marg, Matunga, Mumbai-400019, India.

BACKGROUND: There has been limited research on extending the shelf-life of 
sapota (Manilkara zapota L. var. Kalipatti) fruit. An edible coating made up of 
methyl cellulose (MC) and palm oil (PO) was applied to study the extension in 
shelf-life. Changes in physical and chemical properties of fruit were studied 
along with peroxidase (POD), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and pectin methylesterase 
(PME) activities during post-harvest ripening of sapota.
RESULTS: The fruits coated with 15 g L-1 MC and 11.25 g L-1 PO showed 
significant (P < 0.05) delay in physiological weight loss, decrease in fruit 
firmness losses as well as slower fruit darkening. The coating on the fruits 
resulted in better retention of ascorbic acid, delayed the loss of total 
phenolic content, and delayed the increase in total soluble solids and total 
reducing sugars as compared to control fruits. The coating either delayed or 
reduced the enzyme activities of POD, PPO and PME of the fruit.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that edible coating made up of MC-PO has 
potential to maintain the quality of sapota fruit. The edible coating extended 
the shelf-life of sapota fruit by 3 days preserving fruit quality up to 7 days 
at 24 ± 1 °C and 65 ± 5 %RH. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Classical Multidimensional Scaling Unveil New 
Metastable States in the Conformational Landscape of CDK2.

Protein kinases are key regulatory nodes in cellular networks and their function 
has been shown to be intimately coupled with their structural flexibility. 
However, understanding the key structural mechanisms of large conformational 
transitions remains a difficult task. CDK2 is a crucial regulator of cell cycle. 
Its activity is finely tuned by Cyclin E/A and the catalytic segment 
phosphorylation, whereas its deregulation occurs in many types of cancer. ATP 
competitive inhibitors have failed to be approved for clinical use due to 
toxicity issues raised by a lack of selectivity. However, in the last few years 
type III allosteric inhibitors have emerged as an alternative strategy to 
selectively modulate CDK2 activity. In this study we have investigated the 
conformational variability of CDK2. A low dimensional conformational landscape 
of CDK2 was modeled using classical multidimensional scaling on a set of 255 
crystal structures. Microsecond-scale plain and accelerated MD simulations were 
used to populate this landscape by using an out-of-sample extension of 
multidimensional scaling. CDK2 was simulated in the apo-form and in complex with 
the allosteric inhibitor 8-anilino-1-napthalenesulfonic acid (ANS). The apo-CDK2 
landscape analysis showed a conformational equilibrium between an Src-like 
inactive conformation and an active-like form. These two states are separated by 
different metastable states that share hybrid structural features with both 
forms of the kinase. In contrast, the CDK2/ANS complex landscape is compatible 
with a conformational selection picture where the binding of ANS in proximity of 
the αC helix causes a population shift toward the inactive conformation. 
Interestingly, the new metastable states could enlarge the pool of candidate 
structures for the development of selective allosteric CDK2 inhibitors. The 
method here presented should not be limited to the CDK2 case but could be used 
to systematically unmask similar mechanisms throughout the human kinome.

We hypothesized that negatively valenced expectancy violations about the quality 
of 1's life would predict negative emotionality. We tested this hypothesis in a 
4-wave longitudinal study of breast cancer survivors. The findings showed that 
higher levels of negatively valenced expectancy violation, at earlier time 
points, were associated with greater negative emotionality, at later time 
points. Implications of the findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record

Side effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment vary in children and 
adults with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). As children have a much longer 
life expectancy than adults, TKI therapy may continue for decades and with 
long-term consequences that differ from adults. Children may develop 
endocrinopathies related to "off-target" effects of TKIs, such as delayed 
growth, changes in bone metabolism, thyroid abnormalities, and effects on 
puberty and fertility. These endocrinopathies present additional challenges for 
pediatric patients with CML. This review critically evaluates the literature on 
long-term endocrine side effects of TKIs in the pediatric CML population and 
provides suggested recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Costly biologicals in palliative oncology are emerging at a rapid 
pace. For example, in patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
addition of cetuximab to a palliative chemotherapy regimen appears to improve 
survival. However, it simultaneously results in higher costs. We aimed to 
determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of adding cetuximab to 
first-line chemotherapeutic treatment of patients with advanced esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma, based on data from a randomized controlled phase II 
trial.
METHODS: A cost effectiveness analysis model was applied based on individual 
patient data. It included only direct medical costs from the health-care 
perspective. Quality-adjusted life-years and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios were calculated. Sensitivity analysis was performed by a Monte Carlo 
analysis.
RESULTS: Adding cetuximab to a cisplatin-5-fluorouracil first-line regimen for 
advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma resulted in an the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of €252,203 per quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity 
analysis shows that there is a chance of less than 0.001 that the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio will be less than a maximum willingness to pay 
threshold of €40,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, which is representative for 
the threshold used in The Netherlands and other developed countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Addition of cetuximab to a cisplatin-5-fluorouracil first-line 
regimen for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is not cost-effective 
when appraised according to currently accepted criteria. Cost-effectiveness 
analyses using outcome data from early clinical trials (i.c. a phase II trial) 
enable pharmaceutical companies and policy makers to gain early insight into 
whether a new drug meets the current eligibility standards for reimbursement and 
thereby potential admittance for use in regular clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: Effective treatment for functional disability caused by essential 
tremor is a significant unmet need faced by many clinicians today. Current 
literature regarding focal therapy by botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injections 
uses fixed dosing regimens, which cannot be individualized, provides only 
limited functional benefit and unacceptable muscle weakness commonly occurs. 
This 38-week open label study, the longest to-date, demonstrates how kinematic 
technology addressed all these issues by guiding muscle selection.
METHOD: Participants (n = 24) were assessed at weeks 0, 6, 16, 22, 32, and 38 
and injected with incobotulinumtoxinA at weeks 0, 16, and 32. Clinical 
assessments including UPDRS tremor items, Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) tremor rating 
scale assessing tremor severity, writing and functional ability, quality of life 
questionnaire (QUEST) and objective kinematic assessments were completed at 
every visit. Participants performed two postural and two weight-bearing scripted 
tasks with motion sensors placed over the wrist, elbow and shoulder joints. 
These sensors captured angular tremor amplitude (RMS units) and acceleration 
joint motion that was segmented into directional components: flexion-extension 
(F/E), pronation-supination and radial-ulnar at the wrist, F/E at the elbow, and 
F/E and adduction-abduction at the shoulder. Injection parameters were 
determined using kinematics, followed by the clinician's determination of which 
muscles would contribute to the specific upper limb tremor biomechanics and 
dosing per participant.
RESULTS: Multi-joint biomechanical recordings allowed individualized muscle 
selection and showed significant improvement in whole-arm function, FTM parts 
A-C scores, at week 6 which continued throughout the study. By week 38, the 
total FTM score statistically significantly reduced from 16.2±4.6 at week 0 to 
9.5±6.3 (p<0.0005). UPDRS item 21 score rating action tremor was significantly 
reduced from 2.6±0.5 at week 0 to 1.6±1.1 (p = 0.01) at week 32. Quality of life 
(QUEST) significantly improved from 40.3±15.8 at week 0 to 31.1±15.3 (p = 0.035) 
at week 32 and to 27.8±15.3 (p = 0.028) at week 38. Kinematics provided an 
objective, secondary outcome measure, which showed a significant decrease in 
tremor amplitude in the wrist and shoulder joints (p<0.05). Eight participants 
(40%) self-reported mild weakness in injected muscles but had no interference in 
arm function.
CONCLUSION: Kinematic tremor assessments provide the injector unique insight to 
objectively individualize and personalize injection parameters demonstrating 
BoNT-A effectively alleviates functional disability caused by essential tremor. 
Kinematic technology is a promising method for standardizing assessments and for 
focal upper limb tremor treatment.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to establish a magnetic resonance 
imaging-based classification system for canine hyperadrenocorticism according to 
pituitary gland extension, determine indications for trans-sphenoidal 
hypophysectomy, and clarify the prognosis for each disease grade.
METHODS: A 5-point classification system (Grades 1 to 5) was developed based on 
tumour extension in dorsal and cranio-caudal directions. Cases were then 
classified as Type A: no arterial circle of Willis or cavernous sinus 
involvement and Type B: cases in which these blood vessels were involved.
RESULTS: Medical records and magnetic resonance imaging data of 37 cases with 
hyperadrenocorticism were reviewed. Thirty-three cases underwent surgery; 4 
Grade 5 cases did not have appropriate indications for surgery, and other 
therapies were used. Complete resection was achieved for 3, 3, 22 and 1 Grade 
1A, 2A, 3A and 3B cases, respectively. Resection was incomplete in 1, 1 and 2 
Grade 3A, 3B and 4B cases, respectively. Remission was achieved in 29 cases. 
Recurrence occurred in 4 cases, all of which were classified as Grade 3.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dogs with Type A, Grade 1 to 3 hyperadrenocorticism had a 
good prognosis following trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy. Grade 3B, 4 and 5 
cases may not be suitable for this surgery.

The infant mortality rate (IMR) of 6.0 per 1000 live births in the United States 
in 2013 is nearly the highest among developed countries. Moreover, the IMR among 
blacks is >twice that among whites-11.11 versus 5.06 deaths per 1000 live 
births.This higher IMR and racial disparity in IMR is due to a higher preterm 
birth rate (11.4% of live births in 2013) and higher IMR among term infants. The 
United States also ranks near the bottom for maternal mortality and life 
expectancy among the developed nations-despite ranking highest in the proportion 
of gross national product spent on health care. This suggests that factors other 
than health care contribute to the higher IMR and racial disparity in IMR. One 
factor is disadvantaged socioeconomic status. All of the actionable determinates 
that negatively impact health-personal behavior, social factors, heath-care 
access and quality and the environment-disproportionately affect the poor. 
Addressing disadvantaged socioeconomic status by improving access to quality 
health care and increasing social expenditures would have the greatest impact on 
the USA's IMR and racial disparity in IMR.

Sildenafil and tadalafil are efficacious and well tolerated in Chinese men with 
erectile dysfunction (ED). Recent study results indicate that men with ED in 
China who were naïve to phosphodiesterase inhibitor type 5 (PDE5) therapy prefer 
tadalafil 20-mg (on-demand) versus sildenafil 100-mg (on-demand). Differences in 
psychosocial outcomes may help to explain treatment preference in favor of 
tadalafil. This open-label, randomized, crossover study compared psychosocial 
outcomes and drug attribute choices between tadalafil and sildenafil in Chinese 
men with ED naïve to PDE5 inhibitor therapy. Eligible patients were randomized 
to sequential 20-mg tadalafil/100-mg sildenafil (n = 190) or 100-mg 
sildenafil/20-mg tadalafil (n = 193) for 8 weeks each and were asked which 
treatment they preferred to take for the 8-week extension phase. Psychosocial 
outcomes were assessed using the Psychological and Interpersonal Relationship 
Scale (PAIRS), Drug Attributes Questionnaire (DRAQ), and Sexual Life Quality 
Questionnaire (SLQQ). When taking tadalafil versus sildenafil, men had a higher 
mean endpoint score on the PAIRS Spontaneity Domain (tadalafil = 2.86 vs 
sildenafil = 2.72; P < 0.001), and a lower mean endpoint score on the Time 
Concerns Domain (tadalafil = 2.41 vs sildenafil = 2.55; P < 0.001). A numerical 
increase in the Sexual Self-Confidence Domain was observed when taking tadalafil 
versus sildenafil (tadalafil = 2.76 vs sildenafil = 2.72; P = 0.102). The most 
frequently chosen drug attributes explaining treatment preference were able to 
get an erection long after having drug, and ability to get an erection every 
time. SLQQ results were comparable between treatment groups. These psychosocial 
outcomes may explain why more Chinese men preferred tadalafil versus sildenafil 
for the treatment of ED in this clinical trial.

BACKGROUND: Cluster headache (CH) is a debilitating condition that is generally 
associated with substantial health care costs. Few therapies are approved for 
abortive or prophylactic treatment. Results from the prospective, randomised, 
open-label PREVA study suggested that adjunctive treatment with a novel 
non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) device led to decreased attack 
frequency and abortive medication use in patients with chronic CH (cCH). Herein, 
we evaluate whether nVNS is cost-effective compared with the current standard of 
care (SoC) for cCH.
METHODS: A pharmacoeconomic model from the German statutory health insurance 
perspective was developed to estimate the 1-year cost-effectiveness of 
nVNS + SoC (versus SoC alone) using data from PREVA. Short-term treatment 
response data were taken from the clinical trial; longer-term response was 
modelled under scenarios of response maintenance, constant rate of response 
loss, and diminishing rate of response loss. Health-related quality of life was 
estimated by modelling EQ-5D™ data from PREVA; benefits were defined as 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). Abortive medication use data from PREVA, 
along with costs for the nVNS device and abortive therapies (i.e. intranasal 
zolmitriptan, subcutaneous sumatriptan, and inhaled oxygen), were used to assess 
health care costs in the German setting.
RESULTS: The analysis resulted in mean expected yearly costs of €7096.69 for 
nVNS + SoC and €7511.35 for SoC alone and mean QALY of 0.607 for nVNS + SoC and 
0.522 for SoC alone, suggesting that nVNS generates greater health benefits for 
lower overall cost. Abortive medication costs were 23 % lower with nVNS + SoC 
than with SoC alone. In the alternative scenarios (i.e. constant rate of 
response loss and diminishing rate of response loss), nVNS + SoC was more 
effective and cost saving than SoC alone.
CONCLUSIONS: In all scenarios modelled from a German perspective, nVNS was 
cost-effective compared with current SoC, which suggests that adjunctive nVNS 
therapy provides economic benefits in the treatment of cCH. Notably, the current 
analysis included only costs associated with abortive treatments. Treatment with 
nVNS will likely promote further economic benefit when other potential sources 
of cost savings (e.g. reduced frequency of clinic visits) are considered.

BACKGROUND: Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal 
dominant disease associated with epistaxis, arteriovenous malformations and 
telangiectasias. Disease complications may result in premature death.
METHOD: We investigated life-expectancies of parents of HHT patients compared 
with their non-HHT partners using self- or telephone-administered questionnaires 
sent to their children. Patients were extracted from the databases of 2 
participating HHT Centres: the Toronto HHT Database (Toronto, Canada) and the 
St. Antonius Hospital HHT Database (Nieuwegein, The Netherlands).
RESULTS: Two hundred twenty five/407 (55%) of respondents were included creating 
HHT- (n = 225) and control groups (n = 225) of equal size. Two hundred 
thirteen/225 (95%) of the HHT group had not been screened for organ involvement 
of the disease prior to death. The life expectancy in parents with HHT was 
slightly lower compared to parents without (median age at death 73.3 years in 
patients versus 76.6 years in controls, p0.018). Parents with ACVRL 1 mutations 
had normal life expectancies, whereas parents with Endoglin mutations died 7.1 
years earlier than controls (p = 0.024). Women with Endoglin mutations lived a 
median of 9.3 years shorter than those without (p = 0.04). Seven/123 (5%) of 
deaths were HHT related with a median age at death of 61.5 years (IQ range 
54.4-67.7 years).
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the life expectancy of largely unscreened HHT 
patients was lower than people without HHT. Female patients with Endoglin 
mutations were most strikingly at risk of premature death from complications. 
These results emphasize the importance of referring patients with HHT for 
screening of organ involvement and timely intervention to prevent complications.

BACKGROUND: Shortened life expectancy of people with mental illness is now 
widely known and the focus of research and policy activity. To date, research 
has primarily reflected perspectives of health professionals with limited 
attention to the views and opinions of those most closely affected. The voice of 
carers is particularly minimal, despite policy stipulating carer participation 
is required for mental health services.
AIM: To present views and opinions of carers regarding physical health of the 
people they care for.
METHODS: Qualitative exploratory. Two focus groups and one individual interview 
were conducted with 13 people identifying as carers of a person with mental 
illness. Research was conducted in the Australian Capital Territory. Data 
analysis was based on the thematic framework of Braun and Clarke.
RESULTS: Two main themes were interaction between physical and mental health; 
and, carers' own physical and mental health. Participants described the impact 
of mental illness and its treatments on physical health, including their own.
CONCLUSIONS: Carers are acknowledged as crucial for the delivery of high quality 
mental health services. Therefore they have an important role to play in 
addressing the poor physical health of people with mental illness. Hearing their 
views and opinions is essential.

INTRODUCTION: Team-based interventions for hypertension care have been widely 
studied and shown effective in improving hypertension outcomes. Few studies have 
evaluated long-term effects of these interventions; none have assessed 
broad-scale implementation. This study estimates the prospective health, 
economic, and budgetary impact of universal adoption of a team-based care 
intervention model that targets people with treated but uncontrolled 
hypertension in the U.S.
METHODS: Analysis was conducted in 2014-2015 using a microsimulation model, 
constructed with various data sources from 1948 to 2014, designed to evaluate 
prospective cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related interventions in the U.S.
POPULATION: Ten-year primary outcomes included prevalence of uncontrolled 
hypertension; incident myocardial infarction, stroke, CVD events, and 
CVD-related mortality; intervention and net medical costs by payer; 
productivity; and quality-adjusted life years.
RESULTS: About 4.7 million (13%) fewer people with uncontrolled hypertension and 
638,000 prevented cardiovascular events would be expected over 10 years. 
Assuming $525 per enrollee, implementation would cost payers $22.9 billion, but 
$25.3 billion would be saved in averted medical costs. Estimated net cost 
savings for Medicare approached $5.8 billion. Net costs were especially 
sensitive to intervention costs, with break-even thresholds of $300 (private), 
$450 (Medicaid), and $750 (Medicare).
CONCLUSIONS: Nationwide adoption of team-based care for uncontrolled 
hypertension could have sizable effects in reducing CVD burden. Based on the 
study's assumptions, the policy would be cost saving from the perspective of 
Medicare and may prove to be cost effective from other payers' perspectives. 
Expected net cost savings for Medicare would more than offset expected net costs 
for all other insurers.

Although the U.S. spends more on medical care than any country in the world, 
Americans live shorter lives than the citizens of other high-income countries. 
Many important opportunities to improve this record lie outside the health 
sector and involve improving the conditions in which Americans live and work: 
safe design and maintenance of roads, bridges, train tracks, and airports; 
control of environmental pollutants; occupational safety; healthy buildings; a 
safe and healthy food supply; safe manufacture of consumer products; a healthy 
social environment; and others. Faced with the overwhelming array of 
possibilities, U.S. decision makers need help identifying those that can 
contribute the most to health. Cost-effectiveness analysis is designed to serve 
that purpose, but has mainly been used to assess interventions within the health 
sector. This paper briefly reviews the objective of cost-effectiveness analysis 
and its methodologic evolution and discusses the issues that arise when it is 
used to evaluate interventions that fall outside the health sector under three 
headings: structuring the analysis, quantifying/measuring benefits and costs, 
and valuing benefits and costs.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objective of the study is to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of oral anticoagulants among atrial fibrillation patients at 
an increased stroke risk.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to project the lifetime costs and 
quality-adjusted survival (QALYs) of oral anticoagulants using a private payer's 
perspective. The distribution of stroke risk (CHADS2 score: congestive heart 
failure, hypertension, advanced age, diabetes mellitus, stroke) and age of the 
modeled population was derived from a cohort of commercially insured patients 
with new-onset atrial fibrillation. Probabilities of treatment specific events 
were derived from published clinical trials. Event and downstream costs were 
determined from the cost of illness studies. Drug costs were obtained from 2015 
National Average Drug Acquisition Cost data.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, warfarin was the least costly ($46 241; 95% 
CI, 44 499-47 874) and apixaban had the highest QALYs (9.38; 95% CI, 9.24-9.48 
QALYs). Apixaban was found to be a cost-effective strategy over warfarin 
(incremental cost-effectiveness ratio=$25 816) and dominated other 
anticoagulants. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that apixaban had at 
least a 61% chance of being the most cost-effective strategy at willingness to 
pay value of $100 000 per QALY. Among patients with CHADS2 ≥3, dabigatran was 
the dominant strategy. The model was sensitive to efficacy estimates of 
apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban and the cost of these drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: All the newer oral anticoagulants compared were more effective than 
adjusted dosed warfarin. Our model showed that apixaban was the most effective 
anticoagulant in a general atrial fibrillation population and has an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio <$50 000/QALY. For those with higher stroke risk 
(CHADS2≥3), dabigatran was the most cost-effective treatment option.

One of the great achievements of the twentieth century was a dramatic increase 
in life expectancy. In fact, during the period of 1900/1902 to 2011, life 
expectancy increased from 48 to 76 years in white males and from 51 to 81 years 
for white females in developed countries such as the USA, whereas the total 
deaths per 1,000 population decreased from 17.2 to 8.0 during the same period 
(http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005140.html). Although this may tell us that we 
are on the road to immortality, the resulting economic impact on society of this 
rise in life expectancy can not be underestimated, not only for the increased 
government spending in the time of pension, but also for the alarming rise in 
cost and, consequently, increased spending on health care.

BACKGROUND: Burkholderia contaminans is an emerging pathogen in the cystic 
fibrosis (CF) setting. Included in the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), B. 
contaminans is a Gram negative, motile, obligate aerobe previously classified as 
a pseudomonad. Previous reports have described B. contaminans isolation from 
patients in Portugal, Switzerland, Spain, Argentina and the USA. This, however, 
is the first report relating to B. contaminans affecting Irish patients with CF, 
initially detected in a paediatric setting.
CASE PRESENTATION: Burkholderia contaminans was identified in the routine 
analysis of sputum from a fourteen year old boy, at his annual review and 
subsequently from the sputum from his 19 year old brother. RecA gene sequencing 
and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were unable to distinguish between 
the isolates, which demonstrated with susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, 
cotrimoxazole, meropenem, pipercillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. Both isolates 
were resistant to aztreonam, with reduced susceptibility to tobramycin. 
Following treatment with intravenous meropenem and ceftazidime, oral 
ciprofloxacin and nebulised tobramycin for 6 weeks, sputum specimens from both 
patients were negative for B. contaminans. No other member of the local CF 
cohort proved positive.
CONCLUSIONS: Bcc bacteria are associated with poor prognosis in CF and decreased 
life expectancy, specifically leading to a more rapid decline in lung function 
and, in some cases, to a fatal necrotizing pneumonia known as the "cepacia 
syndrome". Some species exhibit innate resistance to multiple antimicrobial 
agents and their transmission rate can be high in susceptible patients. In that 
context, we describe the first incidence of CF-related B. contaminans in Ireland 
and its successful eradication from two patients, one paediatric, using an 
aggressive antimicrobial regimen.

BACKGROUND: Increases in life expectancy are hypothesised to be associated with 
shorter proportional time spent with morbidity (compression of morbidity). We 
assessed whether this has occurred among older adults in the USA during the 
1990s and 2000s.
METHODS: We used data from the Health and Retirement Study to estimate a 
morbidity score based on eight chronic conditions and compare it (1) 
prospectively between two age-matched cohorts in 1992 and 2004 over a 6-year 
follow-up, and (2) retrospectively in the three waves prior to death among 
respondents who die in (1998-2004) and (2004-2010).
RESULTS: Prospective assessment shows significantly higher prevalence in 6 of 
eight chronic conditions in the 2000s, with 37% higher diabetes prevalence. A 
retrospective evaluation shows significantly higher prevalence in 7 of eight 
chronic conditions in the three waves prior to death for (2004-2010) versus 
(1998-2004), with 41% higher prevalence of arthritis. Importantly, the farther 
away from time of death, the higher the average number of chronic conditions in 
(2004-2010).
CONCLUSIONS: Using the largest longitudinal ageing study in the USA, we found no 
clear evidence of compression of morbidity as measured by self-reported chronic 
disease. Older adults in the USA may be experiencing greater disease burden in 
recent times.
