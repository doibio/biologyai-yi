The analysis of the available databases related to HIV/AIDS confirms a paradigm 
shift in the patient's life expectancy: now HIV has become a chronic disease, so 
patients are aging. However, this advance is accompanied by a negative 
counterpart: due to the increase in the number of years of life gained, there is 
a prevalence of comorbidities greater than the general population and at an 
earlier age. Reducing the risk associated with all the comorbidities that the 
ageing patient with HIV/AIDS may develop, must now be a health objective; it 
must be added to the traditional objectives that until now were part of the 
strategy to reduce the impact of the HIV infection. In the specific case of 
women, it is also necessary to train peri and postmenopausal women to increase 
their skills and motivation to care for their health; It is also very important 
to examine the role that hormone replacement therapy can play in reducing their 
symptoms.

Publisher: El análisis de las bases de datos disponibles relacionadas con 
VIH/SIDA confirma un cambio de paradigma en la esperanza de vida del paciente: 
ahora el VIH se ha convertido en una enfermedad crónica, con la que los 
pacientes están envejeciendo. No obstante, este avance se acompaña de una 
contraparte negativa: debido al incremento en el número de años de vida ganados, 
se da una prevalencia de comorbilidades mayor a la de la población general y a 
una edad más temprana. Reducir el riesgo asociado a todas las comorbilidades que 
puede desarrollar el paciente con VIH/SIDA mientras envejece debe ser hoy en día 
un objetivo de salud, que se suma a los objetivos tradicionales que hasta ahora 
formaban parte de la estrategia para reducir el impacto de la infección por el 
VIH. En el caso específico de la mujer, además es necesario formar a las mujeres 
peri y postmenopáusicas para incrementar sus habilidades y su motivación para el 
cuidado de su salud; también es muy importante que se examine el rol que puede 
tener la terapia de reemplazo hormonal en la reducción de sus síntomas.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of death in pregnancy and 
post partum, but the symptoms of PE are common in normal pregnancy. Simple 
diagnostic tests are needed to select women for diagnostic imaging.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the accuracy, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
clinical features, decision rules and biomarkers for selecting pregnant or 
postpartum women with a suspected PE for imaging.
DESIGN: An expert consensus study to develop new clinical decision rules, a 
case-control study of women with a diagnosed PE or a suspected PE, a biomarker 
study of women with a suspected PE or diagnosed deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and 
decision-analysis modelling.
SETTING: Emergency departments and consultant-led maternity units.
PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant/postpartum women with a diagnosed PE from any hospital 
reporting to the UK Obstetric Surveillance System research platform and 
pregnant/postpartum women with a suspected PE or diagnosed DVT at 11 
prospectively recruiting sites.
INTERVENTIONS: Clinical features, decision rules and biomarkers.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, area under receiver operating 
characteristic (AUROC) curve, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and 
health-care costs.
RESULTS: The primary analysis involved 181 women with PE and 259 women without 
PE in the case-control study and 18 women with DVT, 18 with PE and 247 women 
without either in the biomarker study. Most clinical features showed no 
association with PE. The AUROC curves for the clinical decision rules were as 
follows: primary consensus, 0.626; sensitive consensus, 0.620; specific 
consensus, 0.589; PE rule-out criteria, 0.621; simplified Geneva score, 0.579; 
Wells's PE criteria (permissive), 0.577; and Wells's PE criteria (strict), 
0.732. The sensitivities and specificities of the D-dimer measurement were 88.4% 
and 8.8%, respectively, using a standard threshold, and 69.8% and 32.8%, 
respectively, using a pregnancy-specific threshold. Previous venous 
thromboembolism, long-haul travel, multiple pregnancy, oxygen saturation, recent 
surgery, temperature and PE-related chest radiograph abnormality were predictors 
of PE on multivariable analysis. We were unable to derive a rule through 
multivariable analysis or recursive partitioning with adequate accuracy. The 
AUROC curves for the biomarkers were as follows: activated partial 
thromboplastin time - 0.669, B-type natriuretic peptide - 0.549, C-reactive 
protein - 0.542, Clauss fibrinogen - 0.589, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
D-dimer - 0.668, Innovance D-dimer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products 
GmbH, distributed by Sysmex UK Ltd, Milton Keynes, UK) - 0.651, mid-regional 
pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MRproANP) - 0.524, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 - 
0.562, plasmin-antiplasmin - 0.639, Prothombin time - 0.613, thrombin generation 
lag time - 0.702, thrombin generation endogenous potential - 0.559, thrombin 
generation peak - 0.596, thrombin generation time to peak - 0.655, tissue factor 
- 0.531 and troponin - 0.597. The repeat analysis excluding women who had 
received anticoagulation was limited by the small number of women with PE 
(n = 4). The health economic analysis showed that a strategy of scanning all 
women with a suspected PE accrued more QALYs and incurred fewer costs than any 
selective strategy based on a clinical decision rule and was therefore the 
dominant strategy.
LIMITATIONS: The findings apply specifically to the diagnostic assessment of 
women with a suspected PE in secondary care.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical features, decision rules and biomarkers do not accurately, 
effectively or cost-effectively select pregnant or postpartum women with a 
suspected PE for diagnostic imaging.
FUTURE WORK: New diagnostic technologies need to be developed to detect PE in 
pregnancy.

The historical narrative on diversity, race, and health would predict that 
California's population change from 22 percent racial/ethnic minority in 1970 to 
62 percent in 2016 would lead to a massive health crisis with high mortality 
rates, low life expectancy, and high infant mortality rates-particularly given 
the state's high rates of negative social determinants of health: poverty, high 
school incompletion, and uninsurance. We present data that suggest an 
alternative narrative: In spite of these negative factors, California has very 
low rates of mortality and infant mortality and long life expectancy. This 
alternative implies that racial diversity may offer opportunities for good 
health outcomes and that community agency may be a positive determinant. Using 
national-level mortality data on racial/ethnic groups, we suggest that new 
theoretical models and methods be developed to assist the US in achieving 
high-level wellness as it too becomes "majority minority."

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness and value of additional information about a 
health technology or program may change over time because of trends affecting 
patient cohorts and/or the intervention. Delaying information collection even 
for parameters that do not change over time may be optimal.
METHODS: We present a stochastic dynamic programming approach to simultaneously 
identify the optimal intervention and information collection policies. We use 
our framework to evaluate birth cohort hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening. We 
focus on how the presence of a time-varying parameter (HCV prevalence) affects 
the optimal information collection policy for a parameter assumed constant 
across birth cohorts: liver fibrosis stage distribution for screen-detected 
diagnosis at age 50.
RESULTS: We prove that it may be optimal to delay information collection until a 
time when the information more immediately affects decision making. For the 
example of HCV screening, given initial beliefs, the optimal policy (at 2010) 
was to continue screening and collect information about the distribution of 
liver fibrosis at screen-detected diagnosis in 12 years, increasing the expected 
incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) by $169.5 million compared to current 
guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: The option to delay information collection until the information is 
sufficiently likely to influence decisions can increase efficiency. A dynamic 
programming framework enables an assessment of the marginal value of information 
and determines the optimal policy, including when and how much information to 
collect.

BACKGROUND: Daily exposure to ambient particulate matter with aerodynamic 
diameter <2.5 μm (PM2.5) increases deaths and is an important contributor to 
burden of disease in population. To better understand the disease burden 
associated with PM2.5, we examined the effects of PM2.5 on daily years of life 
lost (YLL) in Guangzhou, China.
METHODS: Using Guangzhou death registry, air pollution and meteorological 
database, we applied generalized additive models (GAM) to the relationships 
between YLL and PM2.5. We then adjusted the models for age, gender, seasonality 
and meteorological variables. We also conducted within-data prediction of YLL 
while setting 2012-2014 as baseline.
RESULTS: Over 2 million YLLs (800,137 YLLs for females and 1,212,040 YLLs for 
males) were observed during 2012-2016. YLL was higher for the elderly people. 
Mean daily average PM2.5 concentration was 47.3 μg/m3. In model comparisons, the 
GAM with six meteorological variables (sunshine hours, relative humidity, 
precipitation, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, evaporation) outperformed the 
others. The R2 and total deviance were 0.542 and 53.0%, respectively. Non-linear 
trends were observed for PM2.5 and meteorological variables. Fitted daily YLL 
increased to the highest level, when PM2.5 concentration reached 134.3 μg/m3 and 
atmospheric pressure reached 99.4 kPa. Within-data prediction supported the 
fitted GAM, where low mean absolute percentage errors were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Daily PM2.5 exposure has a nonlinear effect on YLL and increased 
levels of PM2.5 may lead to increased YLL. This study highlights the urge to 
reduce ambient PM2.5 pollution in Guangzhou, in order to promote environmental 
health.

Auditory sensitivity, spatial dynamics, and amplitude of courtship song in 
Drosophila melanogaster.

Acoustic communication is an important component of courtship in Drosophila 
melanogaster. It takes the form of courtship song produced by males through the 
unilateral extension and vibration of a wing. Following the paradigm of 
sender-receiver matching, song content is assumed to match tuning in the 
auditory system, however, D. melanogaster audition is nonlinear and tuning 
dependent upon signal amplitude. At low stimulus amplitudes or in the absence of 
sound the antenna is tuned into song frequency, but as amplitude increases the 
antenna's resonance is shifted up by hundreds of Hertz. Accurate measurements of 
song amplitude have been elusive because of the strong dependency of amplitude 
upon the spatial geometry between sender and receiver. Here, D. melanogaster 
auditory directional sensitivity and the geometric position between the courting 
flies are quantified. It is shown that singing occurs primarily from positions 
resulting in direct stimulation of the female antenna. Using this information, 
it is established that the majority of song is louder than theoretically 
predicted and at these sound levels the female antenna should not amplify or be 
tuned into song. The study implies that Drosophila hearing, and, in particular, 
its active mechanisms, could function in a broader context than previously 
surmised.

OBJECTIVE: Individuals with type 1 diabetes have experienced an increase in life 
expectancy, yet it is unknown what level of glycemic control is ideal for 
maintaining late-life brain health. We investigated the association of long-term 
glycemic control with dementia in older individuals with type 1 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We followed 3,433 members of a health care system 
with type 1 diabetes, aged ≥50 years, from 1996 to 2015. Repeated measurements 
of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), dementia diagnoses, and comorbidities were 
ascertained from health records. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to 
evaluate the association of time-varying glycemic exposure with dementia, with 
adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline health conditions, and 
frequency of HbA1c measurement.
RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 6.3 years, 155 individuals (4.5%) were 
diagnosed with dementia. Patients with ≥50% of HbA1c measurements at 8-8.9% 
(64-74 mmol/mol) and ≥9% (≥75 mmol/mol) had 65% and 79% higher risk of dementia, 
respectively, compared with those with <50% of measurements exposed (HbA1c 
8-8.9% adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.65 [95% CI 1.06, 2.57] and HbA1c ≥9% aHR 
1.79 [95% CI 1.11, 2.90]). By contrast, patients with ≥50% of HbA1c measurements 
at 6-6.9% (42-52 mmol/mol) and 7-7.9% (53-63 mmol/mol) had a 45% lower risk of 
dementia (HbA1c 6-6.9% aHR 0.55 [95% CI 0.34, 0.88] and HbA1c 7-7.9% aHR 0.55 
[95% CI 0.37, 0.82]).
CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients with type 1 diabetes, those with majority 
exposure to HbA1c 8-8.9% and ≥9% had increased dementia risk, while those with 
majority exposure to HbA1c 6-6.9% and 7-7.9% had reduced risk. Currently 
recommended glycemic targets for older patients with type 1 diabetes are 
consistent with healthy brain aging.

Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine administration of 
single-dose zoledronic acid for nursing home residents with osteoporosis in the 
USA.
DESIGN: Markov cohort simulation model based on published literature from a 
healthcare sector perspective over a lifetime horizon.
SETTING: Nursing homes.
PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of nursing home residents aged 85 years with 
osteoporosis.
INTERVENTIONS: Two strategies were compared: (1) a single intravenous dose of 
zoledronic acid 5 mg and (2) usual care (supplementation of calcium and vitamin 
D only).
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER), as measured by cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Compared with usual care, zoledronic acid had an ICER of $207 400 per 
QALY gained and was not cost-effective at a conventional willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $100 000 per QALY gained. The results were robust to a reasonable 
range of assumptions about incidence, mortality, quality-of-life effects and the 
cost of hip fracture and the cost of zoledronic acid. Zoledronic acid had a 
potential to become cost-effective if a fracture risk reduction with zoledronic 
acid was higher than 23% or if 6-month mortality in nursing home residents was 
lower than 16%. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the zoledronic 
acid would be cost-effective in 14%, 27% and 44% of simulations at 
willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50 000, $100 000 or $200 000 per QALY gained, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine administration of single-dose zoledronic acid in nursing 
home residents with osteoporosis is not a cost-effective use of resources in the 
USA but could be justifiable in those with a favourable life expectancy.

PURPOSE: Distinguishing aggressive prostate cancer from indolent disease 
improves personalized treatment. Although only few genetic variants are known to 
predispose to aggressive prostate cancer, synergistic interactions of HOXB13 
G84E high-risk prostate cancer susceptibility mutation with other genetic loci 
remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the interplay of HOXB13 
rs138213197 (G84E) and CIP2A rs2278911 (R229Q) germline variants on prostate 
cancer risk.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Genotyping was done in Finnish discovery cohort (n = 2,738) 
and validated in Swedish (n = 3,132) and independent Finnish (n = 1,155) 
prostate cancer cohorts. Expression pattern analysis was followed by functional 
studies in prostate cancer cell models.
RESULTS: Interplay of HOXB13 (G84E) and CIP2A (R229Q) variants results in 
highest observed inherited prostate cancer risk (OR, 21.1; P = 0.000024). In 
addition, this synergism indicates a significant association of HOXB13 T and 
CIP2A T dual carriers with elevated risk for high Gleason score (OR, 2.3; P = 
0.025) and worse prostate cancer-specific life expectancy (HR, 3.9; P = 0.048), 
and it is linked with high PSA at diagnosis (OR, 3.30; P = 0.028). Furthermore, 
combined high expression of HOXB13-CIP2A correlates with earlier biochemical 
recurrence. Finally, functional experiments showed that ectopic expression of 
variants stimulates prostate cancer cell growth and migration. In addition, we 
observed strong chromatin binding of HOXB13 at CIP2A locus and revealed that 
HOXB13 functionally promotes CIP2A transcription. The study is limited to 
retrospective Nordic cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous presence of HOXB13 T and CIP2A T alleles confers for 
high prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness of disease, earlier biochemical 
relapse, and lower disease-specific life expectancy. HOXB13 protein binds to 
CIP2A gene and functionally promotes CIP2A transcription.

Management of Primary Ovarian Insufficiency Symptoms in Survivors of Childhood 
and Adolescent Cancer.

Gargus E, Deans R, Anazodo A, Woodruff TK.

Cancer treatments can damage the ovaries, causing primary ovarian insufficiency 
(POI), a condition associated with numerous sequelae that impact long-term 
quality of life. This article systematically reviews the literature on the 
prevalence, surveillance, and treatment of POI in survivors of pediatric and 
adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancers. A systematic review of the literature 
was conducted in January 2018 through a search of Medline, Embase, Web of 
Science, and SCOPUS, alongside the screening of relevant reference lists. An 
initial search identified 746 potentially relevant studies. A total of 36 
studies were included in the final review. Studies were categorized into one of 
the following categories: incidence/prevalence of POI, measurement of ovarian 
reserve, and other. Depending on patient characteristics, cancer diagnosis, and 
treatment, the prevalence of POI ranged from 2.1% to 82.2%. Risk factors for POI 
included exposure to alkylating agents and abdominal/pelvic radiation. POI may 
be associated with a number of complications, including low bone mineral density 
and poor cardiovascular health. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are known to cause 
gonadal damage in female survivors of pediatric and AYA cancers. Acute or 
chronic effects depend on the dose of treatment, age of the individual, 
radiotherapy field, and ovarian reserve of the individual. Some women experience 
short-term loss of reproductive function and then may resume menstrual cycles, 
months or even years later. Although protecting fertility through banking of 
mature eggs, embryos, and tissue samples has become standard of care, additional 
steps need to be taken to ensure that patients have adequate hormone levels to 
maintain whole-body health, including life expectancy, bone health, 
cardiovascular health, quality of life, sexual and genitourinary function, and 
neurologic function. Surveillance and management of each of these comorbidities 
is critically important to survivor health.

Genus Mentha, a member of Lamiaceae family, encompasses a series of species used 
on an industrial scale and with a well-described and developed culture process. 
Extracts of this genus are traditionally used as foods and are highly valued due 
to the presence of significant amounts of antioxidant phenolic compounds. Many 
essential oil chemotypes show distinct aromatic flavor conferred by different 
terpene proportions. Mint extracts and their derived essential oils exert 
notable effects against a broad spectrum of bacteria, fungi or yeasts, tested 
both in vitro or in various food matrices. Their chemical compositions are 
well-known, which suggest and even prompt their safe use. In this review, genus 
Mentha plant cultivation, phytochemical analysis and even antimicrobial activity 
are carefully described. Also, in consideration of its natural origin, 
antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, a special emphasis was given to 
mint-derived products as an interesting alternative to artificial preservatives 
towards establishing a wide range of applications for shelf-life extension of 
food ingredients and even foodstuffs. Mentha cultivation techniques markedly 
influence its phytochemical composition. Both extracts and essential oils 
display a broad spectrum of activity, closely related to its phytochemical 
composition. Therefore, industrial implementation of genus Mentha depends on its 
efficacy, safety and neutral taste.

Science, Ajou University Dental Hospital, Ajou University School of Medicine, 
Suwon, Korea.

The number of geriatric patients seeking dental service is ever-rising because 
of increased life expectancy, also with problem of increased chronic medical 
conditions. One of them are patients on anti-thrombotic medication. Bleeding 
complication after minor oral surgery by anti-thrombotic agents is of concerns 
to dentists on dental management of these patients. Risk and benefit of the 
anti-thrombotic agents must be weighed before initiating dental procedures, 
which should be established as a treatment guideline. Purpose of the paper is to 
optimize the management of the dental patients on anti-thrombotic medication via 
standardization of treatment protocol of such a patient.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains one of the most aggressive tumors 
with low life expectancy worldwide. The existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) 
contributes to the failure of cancer treatment resulted from drug resistance. 
Altered microRNA expression has been observed in human tumors due to its role in 
tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. Hence, the aim of our present study 
was to investigate the effects of miR-485 on the CSC-like traits in NSCLC 
A549-cisplatin resistant cells and concentrate on the underlying molecular 
mechanism. It was found that CSC-like phenotypes were much more enriched in 
A549/cisplatin (A549/CDDP) cells compared to A549-parental cells. In addition, 
we observed that miR-485 was greatly decreased in A549/CDDP cells and miR-485 
overexpression was able to decrease the stemness of A549/DDP cells. Meanwhile, 
epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a green tea polyphenol which has been 
identified as an effective anticancer compound was able to increase miR-485 
expression dose-dependently in A549/CDDP cells. Inhibitors of miR-485 remarkably 
increased CSC-like phenotypes, which could be reversed by indicated doses of 
EGCG. Moreover, CD44 was predicted as downstream target of miR-485 and the 
correlation between them was validated by performing dual-luciferase reporter 
assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Subsequently, in vivo experiments 
were employed to confirm that EGCG restrained CSC-like characteristics by 
increasing miR-485 and decreasing CD44 expression. Taken together, it was 
implied that stemness features and CSC population were suppressed by 
EGCG-modulated miR-485/CD44 axis in A549/CDDP cells.

A new extracorporeal circuit for hemodialysis was designed with the goal of 
improving the middle and high molecular weight toxins removal. A recirculation 
pathway was added to the hemodialysis circuit and relevant pressure regulation 
was performed along the circuit in order to keep the ultrafiltration rate as 
zero. The influence of increasing the recirculation to dialysate flow rate ratio 
on the removal of urea, vitamin B12, and hemoglobin was investigated. This 
removal was also modeled by an analytical method and solved by MATLAB software. 
A significant increase in removal of vitamin B12 (34%) and especially hemoglobin 
(228%) was achieved using the recirculation flow in an adjusted hemodialysis 
circuit. The model showed an acceptable agreement with the experimental results 
which shows its applicability for prediction of different toxin removal in this 
circuit.

This is a case report of a 96 year old woman with pain and functional impotence 
in her left hip after fall. X rays were performed and loosening of the 
acetabular component was appreciated. After discussion of treatment options, it 
was decided to cement an acetabular component for a double mobility head. There 
was a high rate of medical and surgical complications in revision of hip 
arthroplasty in elderly patients. However, it can also offer important benefits 
in terms of independence and quality of life and even increase life expectancy 
in patients with less comorbidity. In our case after six months of follow-up the 
patient was able to walk alone using a walker. In the literature review, age 
does not appear as a limit for the surgical indication. Preoperative medical 
optimization of the patient as well as shorter operative time and blood loss, 
are important factors for good results of these cases.

Publisher: Se presenta el caso clínico de una paciente de 96 años con dolor e 
impotencia funcional en cadera izquierda tras caída. En las radiografías se 
aprecia un aflojamiento del componente acetabular. Tras la discusión de las 
opciones de tratamiento se decide intervenirla colocando un cotilo cementado 
para cabeza de doble movilidad. La revisión de artroplastía en pacientes 
ancianos tiene un riesgo considerable. No obstante, también puede ofrecer 
importantes beneficios en términos de independencia y calidad de vida e incluso 
aumentar la esperanza de vida en aquellos pacientes con menos comorbilidad. En 
nuestro caso tras seis meses de seguimiento la paciente es capaz de deambular de 
forma autónoma con andador. En la revisión bibliográfica la edad no figura como 
límite para la indicación quirúrgica. Una adecuada optimización preoperatoria 
del paciente así como una cirugía con el menor tiempo quirúrgico y sangrado son 
factores destacados para la buena evolución de estos casos.

Retroperitoneal Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy.

Onaca M, Nita G, Manu M, Adou L, Tie G, Copaescu C.

Introduction: Retroperitoneal Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy (RLRP) has been 
introduced in our department as the first line treatment for patients with 
localized prostatic cancer and life expectancy over 10 years. At the time, the 
surgical team had already extensive experience in minimally invasive urologic 
surgery. Our aim is to describe the laparoscopic technique we currently use and 
to analyze our oncologic and functional results. Patients and Methods: All the 
patients who underwent RLRP in our institution (PONDERAS ACADEMIC HOSPITAL) from 
January 2015 to March 2017 were included into a prospective study. The standard 
preoperative protocol included blood tests, prostate biopsy, pelvis MRI and bone 
scintigraphy, while the particular therapy was discussed and approved by the 
Institutional Multidisciplinary Tumor Board. In all the 45 cases, RLRP was 
indicated for localized prostate cancer. Results: The average 
patientÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs age was 68 years (range 45 ÃÂ¢ÃÂ" 74 years), mean 
preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSAi) level was 8 ng/mL (range 
3ÃÂ¢ÃÂ"15 ng/mL) and prostatic volume between 26 and 52 cc. The laparoscopic 
approach was completed in all 45 cases ÃÂ¢ÃÂ" no conversions to open surgery. 
Bilateral nerve sparing was performed in 7 cases (16%) and unilateral in 23 
cases (51%). The mean operative time was 165 minutes (range 120 - 240 min), 
while the average blood loss was 255 mL (range 20ÃÂ¢ÃÂ"800) and two patients 
received blood transfusions. The mean catheterization time was 10 days (range 
7ÃÂ¢ÃÂ"14 days). Positive surgical margins were observed in 8 cases (17.7%). 
Overall, 86% and respectively, 93% of the patients were continent during the 
following 3 and 6 months. 51% of the patients had erectile disfunction 6 month 
after the intervention. Four complications were encountered: intraoperatively - 
rectal injury (1 case) and postoperatively - bleeding (2 cases) and stenosis at 
the vesicourethral anastomosis (1 case). No mortality or late morbidity 
encountered. Conclusions: The radical laparoscopic prostatectomy is a safe and 
efficient procedure for localized prostate cancer with minimal complications and 
short hospitalization time, but it requires an experienced team of laparoscopic 
surgeons. The functional and oncological outcomes of LRP are expected to be 
improved as the medical team experience is extended.

OBJECTIVES: Taxes are the most effective measure to reduce tobacco consumption, 
although this remains a controversial matter. This study presents a method to 
determine and justify taxation based on the monetary value of the years of 
potential life lost due to tobacco consumption.
METHODS: A literature review allowed estimating the average reduction of life 
expectancy in smokers. The value used in cost-effectiveness studies -three times 
the GDP per capita (COP 16 613 951 for 2015, equivalent to USD 6 056, applying 
an exchange rate of USD 1=COP 2743) - was applied to each year lost. Considering 
the average years of tobacco consumption and the number of packs consumed during 
that period, the tax that each pack should have was estimated in such a way 
that, by the time the smoker dies, he or she will have paid for the years lost 
with an annual interest rate of 3 %.
RESULTS: Given an average reduction of life expectancy of 6 years, each smoker 
should contribute to the health system with COP 299 051 115 (USD 109 008). With 
an annual average consumption of 166 cigarette packs for 50 years, a smoker 
should pay each year COP 2 659 648 (USD 969), which means that each cigarette 
pack should have a tax of COP 16 022 (USD 5.84).
CONCLUSIONS: If it is accepted that the health system has to pay up to three 
times the GDP per capita for each year of life in health interventions that add 
years, it is reasonable to think that those interventions that take away years 
of life should also make an equivalent contribution.

Publisher: OBJETIVOS: Determinar y justificar la carga impositiva de los 
cigarrillos, con base en los años de vida que se pierden por su consumo.
MÉTODOS: Mediante revisión de literatura se estimó la reducción promedio de la 
expectativa de vida de un fumador. Se aplicó a cada año perdido el valor 
empleado en estudios de costo-efectividad, de tres veces el PIB per cápita (COP 
16 613.951 de 2015, equivalentes a USD 6 056, aplicando tasa de 1 USD=2 743 
COP). A partir de los años de consumo promedio, y de los paquetes que consume en 
ese lapso, se estimó el impuesto que debería tener cada paquete para que, con un 
interés de 3 % anual, el fumador al fallecer reuniera el valor correspondiente a 
los años que pierde.
RESULTADOS: Dada una reducción promedio de esperanza de vida de seis años, cada 
fumador debería contribuirle al sistema de salud COP 299 051 115 (USD 109 008). 
Si en promedio consume 166 paquetes de cigarrillos anuales, durante 50 años, 
debería reunir COP 2.659 648 (USD 969) cada año, y cada paquete debería tener un 
impuesto de COP 16 022 (USD 5,84).
CONCLUSIONES: Si se acepta que el sistema de salud pague hasta tres PIB per 
cápita por cada año de vida por intervenciones en salud que aporten años, es 
razonable que aquellas intervenciones que quitan años de vida hagan también un 
aporte equivalente.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of risk-stratification tests for 
the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in pediatric patients.
METHODS: A decision-tree model was built using Life Years Gained as a measure of 
effectiveness. Costs were estimated considering the perspective of the Colombian 
health system. Stratification costs included treatment costs based on said 
stratification. Drug prices were taken from SISMED (Drug Price Information 
System) 2008 and the monetary value of the procedures was extracted from the ISS 
2001 rate manual, plus 30%. All costs were expressed in Colombian pesos for 2010 
and the gross domestic product per capita of the same year was used as a 
cost-effective threshold. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyzes were 
performed.
RESULTS: Risk stratification tests have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
of COP 8,559,944. These results are sensitive to changes in probabilities of 
relapse, transplant survival and side effects.
CONCLUSION: Risk stratification tests for AML treatment in pediatric patients 
are cost-effective in the context of the Colombian health care system.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Estimar la razón de costo-efectividad de las pruebas para 
estratificación del riesgo en pacientes pediátricos con Leucemia Mieloide Aguda 
(LMA).
MÉTODOS: Se construyó un árbol de decisión con años de vida ganados como medida 
de efectividad. Los costos fueron estimados desde la perspectiva del sistema de 
salud colombiano. En los costos de la estratificación se incluyeron los costos 
del tratamiento consecuente con ella. Los precios de medicamentos fueron tomados 
del SISMED 2008 y el valor monetario de los procedimientos se extrajo del manual 
tarifario del ISS 2001 adicionando el 30 %. Todos los costos se expresaron en 
pesos colombianos del 2010 y el producto interno per-cápita de ese año fue 
empleado como umbral de costo efectividad. Se condujeron análisis de 
sensibilidad univariados y probabilísticos.
RESULTADOS: La razón de costo-efectividad incremental de las pruebas de 
estratificación a todos los pacientes, fue de $8 559 944. Los resultados son 
sensibles a las probabilidades de recaída, supervivencia al trasplante y efectos 
secundarios.
CONCLUSIÓN: Las pruebas para estratificación del riesgo en LMA son 
costo-efectivas dentro del sistema de salud colombiano.

OBJECTIVE: To test whether anchoring (a cognitive bias) occurs during 
face-to-face interviews to value health states by Time-Trade-Off.
METHODS: 147 Colombian subjects (111 males, 36 females) valued five EQ-5D health 
states better than death during a face-to-face interview. Subjects were randomly 
assigned to two different starting points.
RESULTS: Shapiro-Wilk test discarded normality, while non-parametric tests, 
including Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, showed that anchoring 
was significant in four out of five health states. A higher starting point 
increased the elicited value by 15 %-188 %. The size of the anchoring effect was 
not uniform among health states.
CONCLUSION: Anchoring effects may bias face-to-face Time Trade-Off valuations. 
The size of the anchoring effect is relevant enough for health policy.
