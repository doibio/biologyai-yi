In humans and other long-lived species, harsh conditions in early life often 
lead to profound differences in adult life expectancy. In response, natural 
selection is expected to accelerate the timing and pace of reproduction in 
individuals who experience some forms of early-life adversity. However, the 
adaptive benefits of reproductive acceleration following early adversity remain 
untested. Here, we test a recent version of this theory, the internal predictive 
adaptive response (iPAR) model, by assessing whether accelerating reproduction 
following early-life adversity leads to higher lifetime reproductive success. We 
do so by leveraging 48 y of continuous, individual-based data from wild female 
baboons in the Amboseli ecosystem in Kenya, including prospective, longitudinal 
data on multiple sources of nutritional and psychosocial adversity in early 
life; reproductive pace; and lifetime reproductive success. We find that while 
early-life adversity led to dramatically shorter lifespans, individuals who 
experienced early adversity did not accelerate their reproduction compared with 
those who did not experience early adversity. Further, while accelerated 
reproduction predicted increased lifetime reproductive success overall, these 
benefits were not specific to females who experienced early-life adversity. 
Instead, females only benefited from reproductive acceleration if they also led 
long lives. Our results call into question the theory that accelerated 
reproduction is an adaptive response to both nutritional and psychosocial 
sources of early-life adversity in baboons and other long-lived species.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between provincial government health 
and social spending and population health outcomes in Canada, separately for men 
and women, and account for the potential role of income inequality in modifying 
the association.
METHODS: We used data for nine Canadian provinces, 1981 to 2017. Health outcomes 
and demographic data are from Statistics Canada; provincial spending data are 
from provincial public accounts. We model the ratio of social-to-health spending 
("the ratio") on potentially avoidable mortality (PAM), life expectancy (LE), 
potential years of life lost (PYLL), infant mortality, and low birth weight baby 
incidence. We interact the ratio with the Gini coefficient to allow for income 
inequality modification.
RESULTS: When the Gini coefficient is equal to its average (0.294), the ratio is 
associated with desirable health outcomes for adult men and women. For example, 
among women, a 1% increase in the ratio is associated with a 0.04% decrease in 
PAM, a 0.05% decrease in PYLL, and a 0.002% increase in LE. When the Gini 
coefficient is 0.02 higher than average, the relationship between the ratio and 
outcomes is twice as strong as when the Gini is at its average, other than for 
PAM for women. Infant-related outcomes do not have a statistically significant 
association with the ratio.
CONCLUSION: Overall, outcomes for men and women have similar associations with 
the ratio. Inequality increases the return to social spending, implying that 
those who benefit the most from social spending reap higher benefits during 
periods of higher inequality.

Publisher: RéSUMé: OBJECTIFS: Déterminer l’association entre les dépenses 
sociales et de santé du gouvernement provincial et les conditions de santé de la 
population du Canada, séparément pour hommes et femmes, et expliquer le role que 
l’inégalité salariale pourrait jouer dans la modification de cette association. 
MéTHODES: Nous avons utilisé les données pour neuf provinces canadiennes, de 
1981 à 2017. Les conditions de santé et les données démographiques parviennent 
de Statistiques Canada, les données sur les dépenses provinciales parviennent de 
comptes publiques provinciaux. Nous avons modélisé le rapport de dépenses 
social-à-santé (« le rapport ») sur la mortalité potentiellement évitable (MPE), 
l’espérance de vie (EV), les années de vie potentielles perdues (AVPP), 
la mortalité d’enfant et l’incidence d’un poids à la naissance faible. Nous 
interagissons le rapport avec le coefficient de Gini pour permettre la 
modification d’inégalité salariale. RéSULTATS: Quand le coefficient de Gini est 
égal à sa moyenne (0,294), le rapport est associé avec des conditions de santé 
désirables pour hommes et femmes adultes. Par example, en femmes, une 
augmentation de 1 % dans le rapport est associé avec une réduction de 0,04 % en 
MPE, une réduction de 0,05 % en AVPP, et une augmentation de 0,002 % en EV. 
Quand le coefficient de Gini est 0,02 plus haut que la moyenne, la relation 
entre le rapport et les résultats est deux fois plus fort que quand le Gini est 
à sa moyenne, à part la MPE en femmes. Les résultats liés aux nouveau-nés n’ont 
pas une association statistique significative avec le rapport. CONCLUSION: 
Globalement, les résultats pour hommes et femmes ont des associations semblables 
avec le rapport. L’inégalité augmente le retour aux dépenses sociales, insinuant 
que ceux et celles qui profitent le plus de dépenses sociales récoltent plus de 
bénéfices pendant des périodes de plus grande inégalité.

BACKGROUND: Patients with ischemic stroke are often treated with clopidogrel 
monotherapy as part of secondary stroke prevention. The prevalence of loss of 
function (LOF) mutations in the CYP2C19 gene is higher in Asians than in Western 
populations. Patients with loss of function (LOF) mutations are at risk for 
poorer secondary outcomes when prescribed clopidogrel.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the cost effectiveness of genotype-guided 
antiplatelet therapy in an Asian population with the aim of prescribing 
ticagrelor as an alternative to patients with LOF mutations.
METHODS: Markov models were developed to look at the cost effectiveness of 
genetic testing of CYP2C19, with patients who screened positive for LOF alleles 
being switched to ticagrelor compared to universal clopidogrel treatment. Effect 
ratios were obtained from the literature and incidence rates and costs were 
obtained from the national data published by the Singapore Ministry of Health. 
Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated. The 
primary endpoints were the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: The prevalence of the LOF mutations was 61% in the population, with 65% 
of ethnic Chinese, 60% of ethnic Indian, and 53% of ethnic Malay patients having 
LOF mutations. Based on this prevalence, the overall ICER of genetic testing was 
S$33,839/QALY with ICERS of S$30,755/QALY, S$33,177/QALY, and S$41,470/QALY for 
Chinese, Indians, and Malays, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that it is cost effective to screen for LOF 
mutations in the CYP2C19 gene in ischemic stroke populations, with ticagrelor as 
a substitute for clopidogrel in those with LOF mutations.

OBJECTIVES: Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a highly heritable psychiatric disorder 
whose genetic complexity and pathogenetic mechanisms are still being unraveled. 
The main goal of this work was to characterize BPD risk-gene candidates 
(identified by Nurnberger et al., JAMA Psychiatry 71:657, 2014, and Stahl et 
al., Nat. Genet. 51:793, 2019) with respect to their evolutionary conservation, 
associated phenotypes, and extent of gene-gene interactions.
METHODS: Database searches and BLAST were used to identify homologous 
counterparts of human BPD risk genes in C. elegans, zebrafish, and Drosophila. 
Phenotypes associated with the C. elegans genes were annotated and searched. 
With GeneMANIA, we characterized and quantified gene-gene interactions among 
members of the BPD gene set in comparison to randomly chosen gene sets of the 
same size.
RESULTS: BPD risk genes are highly conserved across species and are enriched for 
essential genes and genes associated with lethality and altered life span. They 
are significantly more interactive with each other in comparison to random 
genes. We identified syntenic blocks of risk genes, which provided potential 
insights into molecular pathways and co-morbidities associated with BPD 
including coronary disease, obesity, and decreased life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: BPD risk genes appear to be special in terms of their degree of 
conservation, interconnectedness, and pleiotropic effects that extend beyond a 
role in brain function. Key hub genes or pleiotropic regulatory components may 
represent attractive targets for future drug discovery.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of the UK population aged 55 to 75 years have 
evidence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD affects quality of life and 
life expectancy if not appropriately diagnosed and managed. At risk patients 
require accurate diagnosis to ensure optimal treatment to slow disease 
progression and minimize adverse outcomes.
AIM: To assess the accuracy of general practice (GP) registration of the 
diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
DESIGN AND SETTING: An observational analytic case-control study. As part of a 
National Institute for Health Research-funded (ISRCTN13301188) project assessing 
novel diagnostic methods set in GP practice.
METHODS: A total of 125 patients registered as having PAD and 125 age- and 
sex-matched controls were recruited from 15 general practices across North East 
England. The register was then assessed for accuracy of diagnosis. Duplex 
vascular ultrasound scanning (DUS) undertaken by vascular scientists was used as 
the gold standard reference for PAD.
RESULTS: The PAD register had a sensitivity of 86% (95% CI 77%-92%) and 
specificity of 74% (95% CI 67%-81%) when compared with DUS. The positive 
predictive value, however, was 69.6% (95% CI 63%-75%) and negative predictive 
value 88.8% (95% CI 82%-92%). The overall diagnostic effectiveness of the PAD 
register was 79.2% (95% CI 73%-84%).
CONCLUSION: This analysis indicates that while PAD is detected with reasonable 
sensitivity in primary care, many patients registered with a diagnosis of PAD 
lacked DUS-proven disease. Improved approaches to the objective diagnosis of PAD 
may improve diagnosis and management of PAD in primary care.

Dislocation After Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty.

    JBJS Rev. 2020 Dec 21;8(12):e20.00028ER.

Dislocation after total hip arthroplasty (THA) is the leading cause of revision 
surgery. Dual mobility (DM) implants have been utilized over the past 40 years 
as a means of addressing and preventing this morbid and expensive complication. 
Recently, there has been renewed investigation into the role that DM implants 
may play in reducing instability in high-risk patients. Hemiarthroplasty or 
traditional THA remain the mainstays of treatment for older patients with 
displaced femoral neck fractures. Longer-term higher-quality studies are 
necessary to investigate whether DM THA outcomes may be superior to traditional 
THA in the physiologically young patient with high physical demands and a 
longer-than-average life expectancy. The use of DM implants in preventing 
dislocation in patients with fixed spinopelvic alignment, neuromuscular 
disorders, and failed fixation of previously sustained proximal femoral 
fractures has shown success in studies with low levels of evidence. More robust 
prospective data are necessary before more widespread adoption of DM 
arthroplasty is recommended in these clinical scenarios. Knowledge of the 
pertinent literature with regard to the use of DM implants in patients who are 
at high risk for instability will allow orthopaedic surgeons to make informed 
decisions as to whether or not their patients may benefit from primary THA 
utilizing DM implants.

Patient Perspectives on Treatment Options for Older Women With Hormone 
Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: A Qualitative Study.

IMPORTANCE: Women aged 70 years or older with hormone receptor-positive breast 
cancer have an excellent prognosis, but because of their age and comorbidities, 
they are at higher risk for treatment-related adverse events. Despite studies 
demonstrating the safety of omitting previously routine therapies, including 
sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and postlumpectomy radiotherapy, these 
treatments continue to be used at high rates. Physicians cite patient preference 
as one factor associated with overuse. However, little is known about how women 
view potential de-escalation of therapies.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate older women's preferences for SLNB and radiotherapy in 
the setting of guidelines recommending them or allowing for their omission.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study was performed from 
October 2019 to January 2020. Midwestern women aged 70 years and older who had 
never received a diagnosis of breast cancer were recruited online and 
interviewed. Guided by an interpretive description approach, interviews were 
analyzed to produce a thematic description. Data analysis was performed from 
January to March 2020.
EXPOSURES: Participants were presented with hypothetical scenarios in which they 
received a diagnosis of low-risk, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and 
were given treatment options in accordance with current guidelines.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The interviews elicited perspectives on breast 
cancer treatment, including surgery, SLNB, chemotherapy, and postlumpectomy 
radiotherapy.
RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) age of the 30 participants was 72.0 
(71.0-76.5) years. Most of the women were White (26 participants [87%]), lived 
in metropolitan areas (29 participants [97%]), and were college educated (20 
participants [67%] had a 4-year degree or higher). Overall, women expressed the 
belief that age-based guidelines were appropriate on the basis of decreased 
recurrence risk and increased frailty in older patients. However, many 
participants stated that these guidelines should not apply to healthy older 
women with a long life expectancy. Some participants struggled to understand 
that the basis for treatment de-escalation in older patients is a favorable, not 
poor, prognosis. Women who said they would undergo SLNB (12 participants [40%]) 
perceived the procedure as low risk and providing peace of mind. Most 
participants (22 participants [73%]) expressed a preference for omitting 
postlumpectomy radiotherapy because of the perceived risks, lack of benefit, and 
inconvenience.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Positive reframing of the excellent prognosis driving 
national recommendations for de-escalation may reduce breast cancer 
overtreatment in older women. Strategies for reducing SLNB use will likely 
require education on the risks vs benefits and addressing patient preferences 
for peace of mind. In contrast, efforts to reduce radiotherapy use may need to 
address clinician or organizational factors.

All men, almost, suffer from prostatic disorders in average life expectancy. In 
the year of 1950s, the first autopsy of prostate gland discovered the link 
between Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and Prostate Cancer (PCa). After 
that, many histology, biochemistry, epidemiology studies explained the 
association and associated risk factor for the same. From the various scientific 
evidence, it is proved that both diseases share some common transcription 
factors and signalling pathways. Still, BPH cannot be considered as the first 
step of PCa progression. To define, the relationship between both of the 
diseases, a well-defined large epidemiological study is needed. Along with 
androgen signalling, imbalanced apoptosis, oxidative stress, and microbial 
infection also crucial factors that significantly affect the pathogenesis of 
BPH. Various signalling pathways are involved in the progression of BPH. 
Androgen signalling is the driving force for the progress of PCa. In PCa 
androgen signalling is upregulated as compared to a healthy prostate. Some 
dominant Androgen-regulated genes and their functions have been discussed in 
this work.

BACKGROUND: Whether a healthy lifestyle impacts longevity in the presence of 
multimorbidity is unclear. We investigated the associations between healthy 
lifestyle and life expectancy in people with and without multimorbidity.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 480,940 middle-aged adults (median age of 58 
years [range 38-73], 46% male, 95% white) were analysed in the UK Biobank; this 
longitudinal study collected data between 2006 and 2010, and participants were 
followed up until 2016. We extracted 36 chronic conditions and defined 
multimorbidity as 2 or more conditions. Four lifestyle factors, based on 
national guidelines, were used: leisure-time physical activity, smoking, diet, 
and alcohol consumption. A combined weighted score was developed and grouped 
participants into 4 categories: very unhealthy, unhealthy, healthy, and very 
healthy. Survival models were applied to predict life expectancy, adjusting for 
ethnicity, working status, deprivation, body mass index, and sedentary time. A 
total of 93,746 (19.5%) participants had multimorbidity. During a mean follow-up 
of 7 (range 2-9) years, 11,006 deaths occurred. At 45 years, in men with 
multimorbidity an unhealthy score was associated with a gain of 1.5 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] -0.3 to 3.3; P = 0.102) additional life years compared 
to very unhealthy score, though the association was not significant, whilst a 
healthy score was significantly associated with a gain of 4.5 (3.3 to 5.7; P < 
0.001) life years and a very healthy score with 6.3 (5.0 to 7.7; P < 0.001) 
years. Corresponding estimates in women were 3.5 (95% CI 0.7 to 6.3; P = 0.016), 
6.4 (4.8 to 7.9; P < 0.001), and 7.6 (6.0 to 9.2; P < 0.001) years. Results were 
consistent in those without multimorbidity and in several sensitivity analyses. 
For individual lifestyle factors, no current smoking was associated with the 
largest survival benefit. The main limitations were that we could not explore 
the consistency of our results using a more restrictive definition of 
multimorbidity including only cardiometabolic conditions, and participants were 
not representative of the UK as a whole.
CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of data from the UK Biobank, we found that 
regardless of the presence of multimorbidity, engaging in a healthier lifestyle 
was associated with up to 6.3 years longer life for men and 7.6 years for women; 
however, not all lifestyle risk factors equally correlated with life expectancy, 
with smoking being significantly worse than others.

INTRODUCTION: Biological rhythms, such as Light/Dark (LD) cycles, are an 
integral component of virtually all aspects of life. These rhythms are 
controlled in large part by circadian clocks, allowing the organism to adapt its 
internal rhythmic metabolism to changes in the external environment created by 
daily fluctuations in the LD cycle. Therefore, changes in the daily duration of 
the lighting could lead to adverse health consequences. The aim of the study was 
to investigate, in a nocturnal desert rodent, Gerbillus tarabuli, the effects of 
the LD cycle disruption on the structure of the hepatic tissue and the content 
of carbohydrate and lipid parameters as indicators of metabolic state.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study was conducted on two gerbil groups: 
control group was exposed to a standard lighting cycle (LD: 12:12), and the 
shifted group was subjected to a chronic disrupted LD cycle, alternating a 
standard cycle (LD: 12:12) with a modified cycle (LD: 20:4), i.e., the light 
phase of 24-h cycle was prolonged by 8 h on every second day during a period of 
12 weeks. We used: (i) routine histology and histochemical staining for tissue 
analysis; (ii) immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MPO detection; (iii) biochemical 
methods for hepatic glycogen and lipids extraction and quantification. Blood 
metabolic parameters were assessed by enzymatic methods.
RESULTS: Our structural results indicate in the shifted group an alteration of 
tissue architecture, showing widely scattered inflammatory foci with many 
dilated sinusoids and prominent leukocyte infiltration with connective fibrotic 
extension. IHC revealed also increased hepatic myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression 
confirming neutrophils' presence. In parallel, the histochemical study revealed 
a strong depletion of hepatocytic glycogen and lipid inclusions; these 
observations were also supported by the measurements of glycogen and total 
lipids in extracted tissue indicating a reduction in liver content. These 
results were accompanied by a decrease in body weight relative to the reduction 
of food intake, as well as hyperglycemia and some alterations in serum lipid 
parameters (triglycerides and cholesterol) suggesting a metabolic disturbance.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that a phase difference between the endogenous activity 
rhythm of the species and the daily cycle of illumination has a strong impact on 
the liver morphology as well as on the metabolic activity of liver cells.

Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) is a key pathogen 
involved in the development and progression of acne inflammation. The numerous 
bioactive properties of wild bitter melon (WBM) leaf extract and their medicinal 
applications have been recognized for many years. In this study, we examined the 
suppressive effect of a methanolic extract (ME) of WBM leaf and fractionated 
components thereof on live C. acnes-induced in vitro and in vivo inflammation. 
Following methanol extraction of WBM leaves, we confirmed anti-inflammatory 
properties of ME in C. acnes-treated human THP-1 monocyte and mouse ear edema 
models. Using a bioassay-monitored isolation approach and a combination of 
liquid-liquid extraction and column chromatography, the ME was then separated 
into n-hexane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and water-soluble fractions. The hexane 
fraction exerted the most potent anti-inflammatory effect, suppressing C. 
acnes-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by 36%. The ethanol-soluble 
fraction (ESF), which was separated from the n-hexane fraction, significantly 
inhibited C. acnes-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK)-mediated cellular IL-8 production. Similarly, the ESF protected against 
C. acnes-stimulated mouse ear swelling, as measured by ear thickness (20%) and 
biopsy weight (23%). Twenty-four compounds in the ESF were identified using gas 
chromatograph-mass spectrum (GC/MS) analysis. Using co-cultures of C. acnes and 
THP-1 cells, β-ionone, a compound of the ESF, reduced the production of IL-1β 
and IL-8 up to 40% and 18%, respectively. β-ionone also reduced epidermal 
microabscess, neutrophilic infiltration and IL-1β expression in mouse ear. We 
also found evidence of the presence of anti-inflammatory substances in an 
unfractionated phenolic extract of WBM leaf, and demonstrated that the ESF is a 
potential anti-inflammatory agent for modulating in vitro and in vivo C. 
acnes-induced inflammatory responses.

Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is complex and not well understood, 
especially among Japanese people. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate 
the relationships of subjective and objective mental and physical function with 
SCD among older community-dwelling Japanese adults. SCD was evaluated using the 
Kihon Checklist: Cognitive Function. Other parameters were evaluated using the 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the five-item version of the Geriatric 
Depression Scale (GDS-5), for an objective mental function other than SCD. A 
timed up-and-go test (TUG) and knee extension strength were used to test 
objective physical function, and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) and Physical 
Component Summary (PCS) in the Health-Related Quality of Life survey eight-item 
short form (SF-8) were used for subjective mental and physical functions. The 
results of the MMSE, GDS-5, TUG, knee extension strength, and MCS were 
significantly worse in the SCD group. In addition, logistic regression analysis 
showed that GDS-5 and MCS were associated with SCD onset. Depressive symptoms 
and decreased subjective mental function contribute to SCD among 
community-dwelling Japanese adults. These findings will be useful for planning 
dementia prevention and intervention programs for older Japanese adults.

Meningioma is one of the most common intracranial tumors. It is benign and slow 
growing in the majority of cases. Given the increase in life expectancy and the 
number of radiological tests performed, the incidence in the elderly population 
(≥65 years) is continuously increasing. The surgical outcomes and prognostic 
factors in this age group are unclear. A retrospective analysis of all the 
patients treated for intracranial meningiomas in two different Italian 
institutions was performed. The clinical, radiological, surgical and follow-up 
data were retrospectively reviewed. Statistical analyses were performed to 
identify relationships between factors and outcomes. We also carried out an 
economic analysis. We analyzed 321 patients with intracranial meningioma. The 
mean age was 72.6 years (range, 65-90), with a female predominance (F/M, 1.41). 
Pre-operative deficits, cognitive impairment and seizures (p < 0.001) were 
associated with a worse post-operative Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) score 
(<80). A high pre-operative KPS score was associated with a good clinical and 
neurological outcome (p < 0.001). Being aged between 65 and 74 years, low 
surgical timing and Simpson removal grades of I and II were associated with a 
good outcome (p < 0.001). The length of hospitalization was significantly 
related to the outcome (p < 0.001). The complication rate was 14.3%. At 6-month 
follow-up, the mortality rate was 2.5%. The average cost was higher in patients 
with a pre-operative KPS score lower than 80. The outcome of 
intracranial-meningioma resection in elderly individuals is favorable when the 
pre-operative KPS score is >80. Treatment should be patient-specific, and 
additional factors should be considered. Patients with poor pre-operative 
clinical conditions might benefit from a combined strategy with partial 
resection and radiosurgery in order to reduce surgical timing and the 
complication rate.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy increases, the number of octogenarians requiring 
primary and revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is increasing. Recently, 
primary TKA has become a common treatment option in octogenarians. However, 
surgeons may still be hesitant about performing revision TKA on octogenarians 
because of concern about risk and cost benefit. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate clinical outcomes, postoperative complications, and mid-term 
lifetime survival in octogenarians after primary and revision TKA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 231 primary TKAs and 41 
revision TKAs performed on octogenarians between 2000 and 2016. The mean age of 
patients undergoing primary TKA was 81.9 years and that of patients undergoing 
revision TKA was 82.3 years (p = 0.310). The age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity 
index was higher in revision TKA (4.4 vs. 4.8, p = 0.003). The Western Ontario 
and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and range of motion (ROM) 
were evaluated. The incidence of postoperative complications (TKA-related, 
specific or systemic) and lifetime survival rate (endpoint death determined by 
telephone or mail communication with patient or family) were investigated.
RESULTS: The WOMAC and ROM improved significantly after primary and revision 
TKA, although postoperative results were worse in the revision group (33.1 vs. 
47.2; 128.9° vs. 113.6°; p < 0.001, respectively). There were no cases of 
aseptic or septic component failure in either group. One case of periprosthetic 
fracture was observed in the revision group (0% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.151), and three 
cases of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) (one case of 
DVT and two cases of PTE) were observed in the primary group (1.3% vs. 0%, 
p = 1.000). The most common systemic complication in both groups was delirium 
(7.4% vs. 14.6%, p = 0.131). There were no differences between the two groups in 
the other systemic complication rates. The 5-year and 10-year lifetime survival 
rates were 87.2% and 62.9%, respectively, in primary TKA and 82.1% and 42.2%, 
respectively, in revision TKA (p = 0.017).
CONCLUSIONS: Both primary and revision TKA are viable options for octogenarians, 
based on the satisfactory clinical outcomes, TKA-related complication rates, and 
mid-term lifetime survival. Delirium needs to be managed appropriately as the 
most common systemic complication in both primary and revision TKA in 
octogenarians.

BACKGROUND: The newer cancer treatment technologies hold the potential of 
providing improved health outcomes at an additional cost. So it becomes 
obligatory to assess the costs and benefits of a new technology, before defining 
its clinical value. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of intensity-modulated 
radiotherapy (IMRT) as compared to 2-dimensional radiotherapy (2-DRT) and 
3-dimensional radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for treating head and neck cancers (HNC) in 
India. The cost-effectiveness of 3-DCRT as compared to 2-DRT was also estimated.
METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was designed. Using a disaggregated 
societal perspective, lifetime study horizon and 3 percent discount rate, future 
costs and health outcomes were compared for a cohort of 1000 patients treated 
with any of the three radiation techniques. Data on health system cost, out of 
pocket expenditure, and quality of life was assessed through primary data 
collected from a large tertiary care public sector hospital in India. Data on 
xerostomia rates following each of the radiation techniques was extracted from 
the existing randomized controlled trials.
RESULTS: IMRT incurs an incremental cost of $7,072 (2,932-13,258) and $5,164 
(463-10,954) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to 2-DRT and 
3D-CRT, respectively. Further, 3D-CRT as compared to 2-DRT requires an 
incremental cost of $8,946 (1,996-19,313) per QALY gained.
CONCLUSION: Both IMRT and 3D-CRT are not cost-effective at 1 times GDP per 
capita for treating HNC in India. The costs and benefits of using IMRT for other 
potential indications (e.g. prostate, lung) require to be assessed before 
considering its introduction in India.

Staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen causing life-threatening diseases. The 
increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant S. aureus infections is a global 
health concern, requiring development of novel therapeutic options. 
Peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes (peptidoglycan hydrolases, PGHs) have emerged as 
a highly effective class of antimicrobial proteins against S. aureus and other 
pathogens. When applied to Gram-positive bacteria, PGHs hydrolyze bonds within 
the peptidoglycan layer, leading to rapid bacterial death by lysis. This 
activity is highly specific and independent of the metabolic activity of the 
cell or its antibiotic resistance patterns. However, systemic application of 
PGHs is limited by their often low activity in vivo and by an insufficient serum 
circulation half-life. To address this problem, we aimed to extend the half-life 
of PGHs selected for high activity against S. aureus in human serum. Half-life 
extension and increased serum circulation were achieved through fusion of PGHs 
to an albumin-binding domain (ABD), resulting in high-affinity recruitment of 
human serum albumin and formation of large protein complexes. Importantly, the 
ABD-fused PGHs maintained high killing activity against multiple drug-resistant 
S. aureus strains, as determined by ex vivo testing in human blood. The top 
candidate, termed ABD_M23, was tested in vivo to treat S. aureus-induced murine 
bacteremia. Our findings demonstrate a significantly higher efficacy of ABD_M23 
than of the parental M23 enzyme. We conclude that fusion with ABD represents a 
powerful approach for half-life extension of PGHs, expanding the therapeutic 
potential of these enzybiotics for treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial 
infections.IMPORTANCE Life-threatening infections with Staphylococcus aureus are 
often difficult to treat due to the increasing prevalence of 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their ability to persist in protected niches 
in the body. Bacteriolytic enzymes are promising new antimicrobials because they 
rapidly kill bacteria, including drug-resistant and persisting cells, by 
destroying their cell wall. However, when injected into the bloodstream, these 
enzymes are not retained long enough to clear an infection. Here, we describe a 
modification to increase blood circulation time of the enzymes and enhance 
treatment efficacy against S. aureus-induced bloodstream infections. This was 
achieved by preselecting enzyme candidates for high activity in human blood and 
coupling them to serum albumin, thereby preventing their elimination by kidney 
filtration and blood vessel cells.

BACKGROUND: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening can reduce lung cancer 
mortality in people at high risk; adding a smoking cessation intervention to 
screening could further improve screening program outcomes. This study aimed to 
assess the impact of adding a smoking cessation intervention to lung cancer 
screening on clinical outcomes, costs and cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: Using the OncoSim-Lung mathematical microsimulation model, we compared 
the projected lifetime impact of a smoking cessation intervention (nicotine 
replacement therapy, varenicline and 12 wk of counselling) in the context of 
annual low-dose CT screening for lung cancer in people at high risk to lung 
cancer screening without a cessation intervention in Canada. The simulated 
population consisted of Canadians born in 1940-1974; lung cancer screening was 
offered to eligible people in 2020. In the base-case scenario, we assumed that 
the intervention would be offered to smokers up to 10 times; each intervention 
would achieve a 2.5% permanent quit rate. Sensitivity analyses varied key model 
inputs. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios with a lifetime 
horizon from the health system's perspective, discounted at 1.5% per year. Costs 
are in 2019 Canadian dollars.
RESULTS: Offering a smoking cessation intervention in the context of lung cancer 
screening could lead to an additional 13% of smokers quitting smoking. It could 
potentially prevent 12 more lung cancers and save 200 more life-years for every 
1000 smokers screened, at a cost of $22 000 per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained. The results were most sensitive to quit rate. The intervention 
would cost over $50 000 per QALY gained with a permanent quit rate of less than 
1.25% per attempt.
INTERPRETATION: Adding a smoking cessation intervention to lung cancer screening 
is likely cost-effective. To optimize the benefits of lung cancer screening, 
health care providers should encourage participants who still smoke to quit 
smoking.

INTRODUCTION: With the lowest life expectancy in the Balkans, underlying causes 
of morbidity in Kosovo remain unclear due to limited epidemiological evidence. 
The goal of this cohort is to contribute epidemiological evidence for the 
prevention and control of non-communicable diseases such as depression, 
hypertension, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease in Kosovo as the basis 
for policy and decision-making, with a spotlight on the relationships between 
non-experimental primary healthcare (PHC) interventions and lifestyle changes as 
well as between depression and the course of blood pressure.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PHC users aged 40 years and above were recruited 
consecutively between March and October 2019 from 12 main family medicine 
centres across Kosovo. The data collected through interviews and health 
examinations included: sociodemographic characteristics, social and 
environmental factors, comorbidities, health system, lifestyle, psychological 
factors and clinical attributes (blood pressure, height, weight, waist/hip/neck 
circumferences, peak expiratory flow and HbA1c measurements). Cohort data were 
collected annually in two phases, approximately 6 months apart, with an expected 
total follow-up time of 5 years.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approvals were obtained from the Ethics 
Committee Northwest and Central Switzerland (Ref. 2018-00994) and the Kosovo 
Doctors Chamber (Ref. 11/2019). Cohort results will provide novel 
epidemiological evidence on non-communicable diseases in Kosovo, which will be 
published in scientific journals. The study will also examine the health needs 
of the people of Kosovo and provide evidence for health sector decision-makers 
to improve service responsiveness, which will be shared with stakeholders 
through reports and presentations.
