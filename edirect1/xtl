We examine the dynamics of an age-structured population model in which the life 
expectancy of an offspring may be mutated with respect to that of the parent. 
While the total population of the system always reaches a steady state, the 
fitness and age characteristics exhibit counter-intuitive behavior as a function 
of the mutational bias. By analytical and numerical study of the underlying rate 
equations, we show that if deleterious mutations are favored, the average 
fitness of the population reaches a steady state, while the average population 
age is a decreasing function of the average fitness. When advantageous mutations 
are favored, the average population fitness grows linearly with time t, while 
the average age is independent of the average fitness. For no mutational bias, 
the average fitness grows as t2/3.

Nonchemotherapy drug-induced agranulocytosis: experience of the Strasbourg 
teaching hospital (1985-2000) and review of the literature.

Agranulocytosis is a life-threatening disorder that frequently occurs as an 
adverse reaction to drugs. The overall incidence of nonchemotherapy drug-induced 
agranulocytosis (DIA) ranges from 2.6 to 10 cases per million patients exposed 
to drugs per year. Although patients experiencing DIA may initially be 
asymptomatic, the severity of the neutropenia usually leads to severe sepsis, 
requiring intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In this setting, old 
age, septicaemia, shock, and the metabolic complications of infection, such as 
renal failure, are poor prognostic variables. The severity of neutropenia (< 0.1 
x 10(9))/l) and its duration (> 10 days) may also impact negatively on the 
outcome. With appropriate management using pre-established procedures, the 
mortality rate is now around 5%. Haematopoietic growth factors have been shown 
to shorten the duration of neutropenia in DIA. However, it has yet to be 
determined whether their use translates into a better outcome in DIA patients 
experiencing sepsis. DIA still remains a rare event. However, given the 
increased life expectancy and subsequent longer exposure to drugs, as well as 
the development of new agents, physicians should be aware of this complication 
and its management.

OBJECTIVE: The availability of antiinflammatory asthma medications for infants 
and young children has been limited. The objective of this study was to compare 
effects of nebulized budesonide inhalation suspension and cromolyn sodium 
nebulizer solution on asthma-related health outcomes in young children with 
asthma.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, parallel-group, 52-week, open-label study in 
36 US clinical sites. Patients included 335 children who were 2 to 6 years of 
age and had persistent asthma that had been treated with at least 1 long-term 
control medication; 287 children (86%) completed the study. Patients received 
budesonide inhalation suspension, 0.5 mg daily (n = 168), or cromolyn sodium 
nebulizer solution, 20 mg 4 times daily (n = 167), for 8 weeks, followed by dose 
titration at the investigator's discretion. The main outcome measure was the 
rate of asthma exacerbations over 52 weeks. Secondary measures included times to 
first asthma exacerbation and first use of additional asthma therapy, asthma 
symptom scores, rescue medication use, and health care resource use.
RESULTS: The budesonide group had a mean (median) asthma exacerbation rate of 
1.23 (0.99) per year compared with 2.41 (1.85) for the cromolyn group, 
significantly longer times to first exacerbation and first use of additional 
long-term asthma medication, greater improvements in asthma symptom scores, 
reduced use of rescue medication, and fewer urgent care visits. Both treatments 
were well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide inhalation suspension was more effective than nebulized 
cromolyn sodium in young children with persistent asthma. Both treatments were 
well tolerated with similar adverse event profiles.

Diuretics in the treatment of patients who present congestive heart failure and 
hypertension.

Reyes AJ(1).

ajreyes@internet.com.uy

The main operational objective of diuretic therapy in patients who present 
congestive heart failure and hypertension is to reduce or to suppress excess 
bodily fluid. Effective diuretic therapy decreases cardiac size when the heart 
is dilated, and it reduces lung congestion and excess water. Consequently, 
external respiratory work diminishes and cardiac output would be redistributed 
in favour of systemic vascular beds other than that of the respiratory muscles; 
dyspnoea decreases markedly and there is a slight reduction in fatigue. This 
clinical improvement and the fall in body weight caused by diuretics entail an 
increase in effort capacity. Subsequent exercise training ameliorates the 
abnormal ventilatory response to physical effort and the skeletal muscle 
myopathy that occur in heart failure, and thereby it attenuates dyspnoea and 
decreases fatigue further. Loop and/or thiazide-type diuretics may be used to 
augment natriuresis in patients with congestive heart failure and hypertension. 
The state of renal function, the existence of certain co-morbid conditions, 
potential untoward drug actions, and possible interactions of diuretics with 
nutrients and with other drugs are some of the factors that must be considered 
at the time of deciding on the diuretic drug(s) and dose(s) to be prescribed. 
Spironolactone has been found to increase life expectancy and to reduce 
hospitalisation frequency when added to the conventional therapeutic regimen of 
patients with advanced congestive heart failure and systolic dysfunction. 
Therefore, spironolactone should be the drug of choice to oppose the kaliuretic 
effect of a loop or of a thiazide-type diuretic.

IA-2 autoantibodies restricted to the IgG4 subclass are associated with 
protection from type 1 diabetes.

The tyrosine phosphatase-like protein IA-2 is a major target antigen for 
autoantibodies in the preclinical period of type 1 diabetes. In this study, we 
examined whether immunoglobulin isotypes and IgG subclass specific 
autoantibodies directed at IA-2 discriminate between children at risk of type 1 
diabetes who progressed to diabetes vs. those who remained diabetes-free. 
IgG1-4, IgA and the IgE-specific IA-2 antibody (IA-2A) were measured by 
radioligand assays in 50 patients with type 1 diabetes and 41 ICA-positive 
siblings of patients with type 1 diabetes who were followed for diabetes 
development. Of 41 siblings, 32 were positive for IA-2A; of these, 59 % had IA-2 
IgG1, 59 % IgG4, 16 % IgG3, 9 % IgG2, 16 % IgA and 13 % IgE antibodies. IA-2 
IgG1 was the dominant isotype in prediabetic children (n = 14, 86 % positive) 
and patients with type 1 diabetes (98 % positive) whereas only 7 of 18 (39 %) 
non-progressors had antibodies of this isotype. In subjects that remained 
diabetes-free, a significantly higher frequency of IA-2 IgG4 in the absence of 
IgG1 was observed (50 %) compared to progressors (7 %) and patients with type 1 
diabetes (0 %). Life-table analysis revealed that IA-2A restricted to IgG4 
correlated with protection from type 1 diabetes (p < 0.003). In contrast, IA-2 
IgG2, IgG3, IgE and IgA did not differ significantly between study groups. Our 
findings suggest that the measurement of IA-2 IgG1 and IgG4 subclass antibodies 
can serve as surrogate marker to discriminate between antibody positive subjects 
at high or low risk for rapid development of diabetes.

Cost-utility analysis of interferon beta-1B in secondary progressive multiple 
sclerosis using natural history disease data.

Kobelt G(1), Jönsson L, Miltenburger C, Jönsson B.

(1)Stockholm School of Economics.

OBJECTIVES: Different cost-effectiveness analyses have been presented for 
interferon beta-1b (IFNB) in the treatment of secondary progressive multiple 
sclerosis (SPMS). All studies have used modeling techniques since any effect on 
progression of disability achieved during a clinical trial will last beyond the 
trial. Different approaches to extrapolation have been taken, but generally they 
have been based on disease progression and relapse rates in clinical trials. The 
problem with this approach is that the population in clinical trials is a 
selected group of patients, which has the potential to bias results. A better 
method for extrapolation is to use epidemiologic data. The objective of this 
study is to incorporate natural history data for MS into a previously presented 
cost-utility model and to compare the two methods of extrapolation.
METHODS: Clinical trial data were used to model disease progression during the 
first 3 years in the model. To extrapolate beyond the trial (10 years), data on 
progression of disability were available from a geographically based 
epidemiologic study of the natural history of MS in Canada. There were 568 
patients who had converted to SPMS during the follow-up that were included in 
the data set. Mean costs and utilities for each Markov state were calculated 
from a population-based cross-sectional study in Sweden.
RESULTS: The extrapolation using clinical trial data appears to have 
underestimated the progression of disability in the long term and thus also the 
potential benefit of treatment. Using the epidemiologic data, the incremental 
cost per QALY is SEK 257,000 (US $25,700; US $1 = SEK 10; November 2000) when 
all costs (direct, informal care, and indirect) are included (discounted 3%). 
This compares to SEK 342,000 in the previous model. The lower cost-effectiveness 
ratio is mostly due to a larger QALY gain with treatment than in the previous 
model (0.217 compared with 0.162).
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis in SPMS requires that the effect of 
treatment beyond clinical trials be included. The method of extrapolation 
clearly affects the results, and when available, epidemiologic data should be 
used. Using the longitudinal data from Canada, the cost-utility ratios for 
IFNB-1b in the treatment of SPMS appear well within the acceptable range.

The economic burden of informal care.

Andersson A(1), Levin LA, Emtinger BG.

Author information:
(1)Linköping University.

OBJECTIVES: The great interest focused on home care technologies during the last 
decade resulted from its potential to cut costs. However, the reallocation of 
costs between healthcare providers and social welfare providers, and the 
indirect costs of informal care, are not as frequent topics of discussion. The 
aim of this paper is to discuss different models for estimating the costs of 
informal care in the home care setting in economic appraisals.
METHODS: The outcome of using different models for estimating indirect costs was 
illustrated using empirical data regarding the time spent by informal caregivers 
in providing care in a group of home care patients (n = 59). The models used 
comprise different interpretations of the traditional human capital approach and 
the friction cost model.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Informal care is an important component in home care. 
The inclusion of indirect costs of informal care in economic appraisals will 
have implications for the cost-effectiveness of home care, since it will raise 
costs depending on the model used for estimating indirect costs. In this study 
we have shown that indirect costs estimated by the friction cost model only 
amount to 18% to 44% of the cost when the human capital approach is used. The 
results indicate that, regardless of the method used to estimate indirect costs, 
the cost of informal care in evaluations of home care programs is often 
underestimated due to the exclusion of indirect costs.

Cost and effectiveness of hip protectors among the elderly.

Author information:
(1)Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the net cost and quality of life effects associated 
with hip protector use among the elderly relative to no intervention.
METHODS: We developed two deterministic hypothetical cohorts of 500,000 
65-year-old women or men and followed them over the remainder of their 
lifetimes. Data inputs were collected from secondary sources. Net costs are 
expressed in 1999 U.S. dollars, whereas net effectiveness is expressed in lives 
saved and in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: Hip protector use results in net cost savings for both elderly women 
and men. Women over age 65 and men over age 85 also gain QALYs through hip 
protector use.
CONCLUSION: Using the estimates available in the literature, our analysis 
indicates that use of hip protectors among women is associated with large cost 
savings and QALY gains even when accounting for the inconvenience of using the 
protectors. Among men, hip protectors are also associated with cost savings 
(although of smaller magnitude), but there are net losses of QALYs because of 
the inconveniences associated with the protectors.

To reuse or not to reuse? An economic evaluation of hemodialyzer reuse versus 
conventional single-use hemodialysis for chronic hemodialysis patients.

Manns BJ(1), Taub K, Richardson RM, Donaldson C.

Author information:
(1)University of Calgary.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of reusing hemodialyzers for 
patients with kidney failure on dialysis employing either a heated citric acid 
or formaldehyde sterilization method, in comparison to the standard practice of 
single-use dialysis.
METHODS: A meta-analysis of all relevant studies was performed to determine 
whether hemodialyzer reuse was associated with an increased relative risk of 
mortality or hospitalization. A decision tree was constructed to model the 
effect of three different dialysis strategies (single-use dialysis, heated 
citric acid, and formaldehyde dialyzer reuse) on the costs and quality-adjusted 
life expectancy of "typical" hemodialysis patients. The cost of heated citric 
acid reuse was estimated from a center experienced with the technique. The cost 
of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) care, survival data, and patient utilities 
were estimated from published sources.
RESULTS: There was evidence of a higher relative risk of hospitalization (but 
not mortality) for hemodialyzer reuse compared with single-use dialysis. 
Depending on the assumptions used, the cost savings that could be expected by 
switching from single-use dialysis to heated citric acid reuse were small, 
ranging from CAN $0-739 per patient per year.
CONCLUSIONS: ESRD programs can incorporate the results of this study based on 
their individual situations to determine whether hemodialyzer reuse is 
appropriate in their setting.

Renal transplants have experienced a spectacular development in recent years, 
significantly improving the quality of life and life expectancy of patients. 
However, mortality due to cardiovascular disease in recent years has become the 
first cause of death in renal transplant patients, ahead of infections and 
neoplasic disorders. The causes of this increase are due to the following 
reasons: 1) Important changes in the characteristics of the donor and the renal 
receptor. 2) A significant decrease in the immediate post-transplant mortality 
rates, and 3) increase in the incidence of cardiovascular risk factors in 
transplant patients.

    JAMA. 2002 May 8;287(18):2428-9.

CONTEXT: Despite quality assurance standards, Papanicolaou (Pap) test 
characteristics remain less than optimal.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the societal costs and benefits of human papillomavirus 
(HPV) testing, Pap testing, and their combination to screen for cervical cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: A simulation model of neoplasia natural history 
was used to estimate the societal costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy 
associated with 18 different general population screening strategies: Pap plus 
HPV testing, Pap testing alone, and HPV testing alone every 2 or 3 years among 
hypothetical longitudinal cohorts of US women beginning at age 20 years and 
continuing to 65 years, 75 years, or death.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Discounted costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
saved of each screening strategy.
RESULTS: Maximal savings in lives were achieved by screening every 2 years until 
death with combined HPV and Pap testing at an incremental cost of $76 183 per 
QALY compared with Pap testing alone every 2 years. Stopping biennial screening 
with HPV and Pap testing at age 75 years captures 97.8% of the benefits of 
lifetime screening at a cost of $70 347 per QALY. Combined biennial HPV and Pap 
testing to age 65 years captures 86.6% of the benefits achievable by continuing 
to screen until age 75 years. Human papillomavirus screening alone was equally 
effective as Pap testing alone at any given screening interval or age of 
screening cessation but was more costly and therefore was dominated. In 
sensitivity analyses, HPV testing would be more effective and less costly than 
Pap testing at a cost threshold of $5 for an HPV test.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening with HPV plus Pap tests every 2 years appears to save 
additional years of life at reasonable costs compared with Pap testing alone. 
Applying age limits to screening is a viable option to maintain benefits while 
reducing costs.

Cost-effectiveness of alternative triage strategies for atypical squamous cells 
of undetermined significance.

Comment in
    JAMA. 2002 May 8;287(18):2428-9.

CONTEXT: Every year approximately 2 million US women are diagnosed as having a 
cervical cytological result of atypical squamous cells of undetermined 
significance (ASC-US).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the most efficient and cost-effective management 
strategy for women in the United States diagnosed as having ASC-US.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Cost-effectiveness analysis of data from clinical trials, 
prospective studies, and other published literature. A computer-based model was 
used to compare 4 management strategies for a cytological result of ASC-US: 
immediate colposcopy; human papillomavirus (HPV) triage, which includes 
colposcopy if high-risk HPV types are detected; repeat cytology, which includes 
follow-up cytology at 6 and 12 months and referral for colposcopy if a repeat 
abnormal result occurs; and reclassifying ASC-US as normal in which a 
cytological result of ASC-US is ignored. Reflex HPV DNA testing uses either 
residual liquid-based cytological specimens or samples co-collected at the time 
of the initial screening for conventional cytology. Another method, referred to 
as the 2-visit HPV DNA triage, requires a woman with an ASC-US result to return 
within 1 month to provide another speciman sample.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Years of life saved (YLS), quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: The least costly strategy for biennial screening was to reclassify 
ASC-US as normal, resulting in a reduction in total cancer incidence of 75% for 
conventional cytology and 84% for liquid-based cytology compared with no 
screening. The next least costly strategy was HPV DNA testing resulting in a 
reduction in total cancer incidence of 86% for conventional cytology and 90% for 
liquid-based cytology, followed by immediate colposcopy with a reduction of 87% 
and 91%, respectively. Compared with reflex HPV DNA testing, a strategy of 
repeat cervical cytology or delayed HPV testing costs more but is less 
effective. When all strategies were compared simultaneously, varying frequency 
and type of cytological test, biennial (vs every 3 years) liquid-based cytology 
with reflex HPV testing had a cost of $174 200 per YLS. In a similar comparison, 
liquid-based cytology with reflex HPV testing conducted every 3 years (vs every 
5 years) had a cost of $59 600 per YLS and was more effective and less costly 
than a strategy of conventional cytology incorporating repeat cytology or 
immediate colposcopy conducted biennially.
CONCLUSION: Reflex HPV DNA testing provides the same or greater life expectancy 
benefits and is more cost-effective than other management strategies for women 
diagnosed as having ASC-US.

In an accompanying commentary, Colgrove indicates that McKeown's thesis-that 
dramatic reductions in mortality over the past 2 centuries were due to improved 
socioeconomic conditions rather than to medical or public health 
interventions-has been "overturned" and his theory "discredited." McKeown sought 
to explain a very prominent trend in population health and did so with a strong 
emphasis on the importance of basic social and economic conditions. If Colgrove 
is right about the McKeown thesis, social epidemiology is left with a gaping 
hole in its explanatory repertoire and a challenge to a cherished principle 
about the importance of social factors in health. We return to the trend McKeown 
focused upon-post-McKeown and post-Colgrove-to indicate how and why social 
conditions must continue to be seen as fundamental causes of disease.

of Tokyo, Komaba Tokyo, Japan. CYM06016@nifty.ne.jp

The effects of resistance exercise combined with vascular occlusion on muscle 
function were investigated in highly trained athletes. Elite rugby players (n = 
17) took part in an 8 week study of exercise training of the knee extensor 
muscles, in which low-intensity [about 50% of one repetition maximum] exercise 
combined with an occlusion pressure of about 200 mmHg (LIO, n = 6), 
low-intensity exercise without the occlusion (LI, n = 6), and no exercise 
training (untrained control, n = 5) were included. The exercise in the LI group 
was of the same intensity and amount as in the LIO group. The LIO group showed a 
significantly larger increase in isokinetic knee extension torque than that in 
the other two groups (P < 0.05) at all the velocities studied. On the other 
hand, no significant difference was seen between LI and the control group. In 
the LIO group, the cross-sectional area of knee extensors increased 
significantly (P < 0.01), suggesting that the increase in knee extension 
strength was mainly caused by muscle hypertrophy. The dynamic endurance of knee 
extensors estimated from the decreases in mechanical work production and peak 
force after 50 repeated concentric contractions was also improved after LIO, 
whereas no significant change was observed in the LI and control groups. The 
results indicated that low-intensity resistance exercise causes, in almost fully 
trained athletes, increases in muscle size, strength and endurance, when 
combined with vascular occlusion.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of 25% diet restriction on life span of dogs 
and on markers of aging.
DESIGN: Paired feeding study.
ANIMALS: 48 Labrador Retrievers.
PROCEDURES: Dogs were paired, and 1 dog in each pair was fed 25% less food than 
its pair-mate from 8 weeks of age until death. Serum biochemical analyses were 
performed, body condition was scored, and body composition was measured annually 
until 12 years of age. Age at onset of chronic disease and median (age when 50% 
of the dogs were deceased) and maximum (age when 90% of the dogs were deceased) 
life spans were evaluated.
RESULTS: Compared with control dogs, food-restricted dogs weighed less and had 
lower body fat content and lower serum triglycerides, triiodothyronine, insulin, 
and glucose concentrations. Median life span was significantly longer for dogs 
in which food was restricted. The onset of clinical signs of chronic disease 
generally was delayed for food-restricted dogs.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that 25% restriction in food 
intake increased median life span and delayed the onset of signs of chronic 
disease in these dogs.

A 38-year-old woman was found to have a squamous cell carcinoma in a urethral 
diverticulum after a simple diverticulectomy. The aggressiveness of this 
histologic subtype of carcinoma, along with this patient's long life expectancy, 
supported the choice of aggressive therapy. Only nine other cases have been 
reported. A brief review of the published reports on the presentation, 
diagnosis, options for treatment, and outcomes is included.

University, Ankara, Turkey. akisa@baskent.edu.tr

Lately, Turkey is struggling to recover from the economic effects of the 
economic crisis so that the government officials are trying to impose budget 
cuts in health and education sectors. After the United States, the country's 
national defense expenditures are the highest among the NATO countries. 
Therefore, Turkey allocates only 3-4% of the gross domestic product for health 
care expenses. Overall, the health status in Turkey is the lowest among the 
European Union countries; infant mortality rate is about 45 per 1000 live 
births, which is the highest on the European continent, and per capita health 
care expenditure is $120. Although 75% of the people are covered by some type of 
public insurance, 25% of the Turkish people do not have any insurance coverage. 
The national system is funded by taxes (43%), out of pocket payments (32%), and 
social and private insurance premiums (25%). This study examines whether Turkey 
is ready to be a part of the European Union in terms of the health sector of its 
economy and health status of its people.

In this paper we compare random and nonrandom mixing patterns for network 
epidemic models. Several of studies have examined the impact of different mixing 
patterns using compartmental epidemic models. We extend the work on 
compartmental models to the case of network epidemic models. We define two 
nonrandom mixing patterns for a network epidemic model and investigate the 
impact that these mixing patterns have on a number of epidemic outcomes when 
compared to random mixing. We find that different mixing assumptions lead to 
small but statistically significant differences in disease prevalence, 
cumulative number of new infections, final population size, and network 
structure. Significant differences in outcomes were more likely to be observed 
for larger populations and longer time horizons. Sensitivity analysis revealed 
that greater differences in outcomes between random and nonrandom mixing were 
associated with a larger incremental mortality rate among infected individuals, 
a larger average number of partners, and a greater probability of forming new 
partnerships. When adjusted for the initial population size, differences between 
random and nonrandom mixing models were approximately constant across all 
population sizes considered. We also considered the impact that differences 
between mixing models might have on the cost effectiveness ratio for epidemic 
control interventions.

Intracerebral transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells into acid 
sphingomyelinase-deficient mice delays the onset of neurological abnormalities 
and extends their life span.

York 1029, USA.

Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) are lysosomal storage disorders 
resulting from loss of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activity. We have used a 
knockout mouse model of NPD (ASMKO mice) to evaluate the effects of direct 
intracerebral transplantation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs) on the progression of neurological disease in this disorder. MSCs were 
transduced with a retroviral vector to overexpress ASM and were injected into 
the hippocampus and cerebellum of 3-week-old ASMKO pups. Transplanted cells 
migrated away from the injection sites and survived at least 6 months after 
transplantation. Seven of 8 treated mice, but none of the untreated controls, 
survived for > or = 7 months after transplant. Survival times were greater in 
sex-matched than in sex-mismatched transplants. Transplantation significantly 
delayed the Purkinje cell loss that is characteristic of NPD, although the 
protective effect declined with distance from the injection site. Overall ASM 
activity in brain homogenates was low, but surviving Purkinje cells contained 
the retrovirally expressed human enzyme, and transplanted animals showed a 
reduction in cerebral sphingomyelin. These results reveal the potential of 
treating neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders by intracerebral 
transplantation of bone marrow-derived MSCs.

Complications of coarctation repair.

Serfontein SJ(1), Kron IL.

Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908, USA.

Surgery's role in the treatment of coarctation has been established, and the 
benefit to life expectancy and quality of life is undeniable. Three postaortic 
coarctation repair complications are discussed, with review of existing 
literature: recurrent or residual aortic coarctation, postrepair aneurysm 
formation, and spinal cord ischemia. Incidence, potential causative factors, and 
outcome of surgical or transcatheter treatment for recurrent and residual aortic 
coarctation are reviewed. A literature review of postrepair aneurysm formation 
focuses on etiologic factors such as use of patch aortoplasty repair techniques, 
aortic arch hypoplasia, congenital abnormality of the aortic wall, and 
persistent hypertension after repair. The spectrum, onset, incidence, and 
potential risk factors for postcoarctation repair spinal cord ischemia are 
reviewed. Use of adenosine receptor agonists to achieve a state of ischemic 
resistance is under investigation to address this potential hazard of 
coarctation repair. Complications after surgery do occur in certain subsets of 
patients, but the risk of subsequent intervention is still lower than the 
hazards associated with the natural course of the defect.

Prevalence of, and risk factors for, physical ill-health in people with 
Prader-Willi syndrome: a population-based study.

The medical findings from a population-based study of Prader-Willi syndrome 
(PWS) are discussed (in which birth incidence of PWS was estimated at 1:22,000 
and death rate at over 3% per annum). In this study the prevalence of specific 
medical disorders that might account for a shortened life expectancy were 
investigated. Of all people with a possible diagnosis of PWS, only those meeting 
clinical criteria and/or with a confirmed genetic diagnosis were included in the 
study. Sixty-six individuals, 40 males and 26 females with a mean age of 19 
years (range of 0 to 46 years) agreed to participate in the population-based 
study group. A prevalence rate of 25% for non-insulin dependent diabetes 
mellitus (NIDDM) was found in adults. Mean age at onset was 20 years. Those with 
NIDDM had a higher past maximum body weight and a greater likelihood of positive 
family history. Nearly 50% across the age groups reported a history of recurrent 
respiratory infections. High rates of fractures (29%), leg ulceration (22% in 
adults), sleep disorders (20%), and severe scoliosis (15% in childhood) were 
also reported. It is postulated that hypotonia is a possible contributory factor 
to the risk of strabismus, scoliosis, and respiratory infections. Other causes 
of morbidity, in particular the high rates of NIDDM, may be due to a failure to 
manage over-eating resulting in severe obesity. Early diagnosis and clear 
guidance to families about these risks and how they might be prevented is 
recommended. It is hypothesized that the high pain threshold may result in the 
presence of some illness not being apparent.

Persistent and aggressive bacteria in the lungs of cystic fibrosis children.

Hart CA(1), Winstanley C.

Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.

There have been enormous improvements in life expectancy of patients with cystic 
fibrosis, especially with improved nutrition and better understanding of the 
basic cellular defects. However, infection in particular with Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, has the greatest effect in decreasing life 
expectancy. Although infections can be prevented by rigorous infection control 
procedures, early aggressive antimicrobial chemotherapy and established 
infection managed by antibiotics, they are not completely effective. A greater 
understanding of how the bacteria evade the host defences and produce infection 
is needed.

[Emergency endovascular treatment of acute aortic diseases].

[Article in German]

PURPOSE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of emergency treatment of acute 
aortic diseases with endovascular stent grafts.
METHODS: In 11 patients (median age 55 years, range 18 - 85) with acute 
complications of descending aortic diseases endovascular emergency treatment was 
performed: traumatic aortic rupture (n = 4), penetrating ulcer with 
aortobronchial fistula or hematothorax (n = 4), acute type B dissection (n = 2, 
one with penetration, one with subacute mesenteric ischemia), and symptomatic 
aneurysm of the thoracic aorta (n = 1) with pain and diameter progression. 15 
stent grafts were implanted (Talent n = 11, Vanguard/Stentor n = 4). Stent 
extension was necessary in 4 cases. In 2 cases graft extension was done during 
the first procedure (due to distal migration and due to the total length of the 
aortic aneurysm). In 2 cases graft extension was performed 5 days (due to a new 
aortic ulcer at the proximal stent struts) and 5 months after the initial 
procedure (recurrent aortobronchial fistula due to aneurysm progression). 14 of 
15 implantations required general anesthesia, one symptomatic thoracic aneurysm 
was performed in local anesthesia and sedation.
RESULTS: 14 of 15 graft procedures were performed using the femoral or iliac 
approach. One procedure required aortofemoral bypass grafting due to extensive 
arteriosclerotic stenosis and the stent graft was inserted via the bypass graft. 
The orifice of the subclavian artery was crossed with bare stent struts in 4 
cases without neurological complications. Median follow-up is 27 months (range 6 
to 72 months). In traumatic aortic ruptures, immediate sealing of bleeding was 
achieved and follow-up is inconspicuous at a maximum of 72 months. In cases of 
aortobronchial fistulas, follow-up is satisfactory (maximum 72 months) despite 
the necessity for reintervention and graft extension. In one acute type B 
dissection retrograde dissection of the aortic arch occurred during stent 
release with stable disease during follow-up without neurological complications. 
In one type B dissection with mesenteric ischemia the mesenteric blood flow was 
restored. A second look operation confirmed pulsatile flow in the mesenteric 
trunk but a total necrosis of the small intestine and the patient consequently 
died.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment is safe and effective for emergency treatment 
of life-threatening complications in selected acute aortic syndromes. Mid-term 
results are encouraging, however, regular follow-up is mandatory to recognize 
late complications of the stent graft.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the (i) benefits, (ii) harms and (iii) costs of continuing 
mammographic screening for women 70 years and over.
DATA SOURCES AND SYNTHESIS: (i) We conducted a MEDLINE search (1966 - July 2000) 
for decision-analytic models estimating life-expectancy gains from screening in 
older women. The five studies meeting the inclusion criteria were critically 
appraised using standard criteria. We estimated relative benefit from each 
model's estimate of effectiveness of screening in older women relative to that 
in women aged 50-69 years using the same model. (ii) With data from BreastScreen 
Queensland, we constructed balance sheets of the consequences of screening for 
women in 10-year age groups (40-49 to 80-89 years), and (iii) we used a 
validated model to estimate the marginal cost-effectiveness of extending 
screening to women 70 years and over.
RESULTS: For women aged 70-79 years, the relative benefit was estimated as 
40%-72%, and 18%-62% with adjustment for the impact of screening on quality of 
life. For women over 80 years the relative benefit was about a third, and with 
quality-of-life adjustment only 14%, that in women aged 50-69 years. (ii) Of 
10,000 Australian women participating in ongoing screening, about 400 are 
recalled for further testing, and, depending on age, about 70-112 undergo biopsy 
and about 19-80 cancers are detected. (iii) Cost-effectiveness estimates for 
extending the upper age limit for mammographic screening from 69 to 79 years 
range from $8119 to $27 751 per quality-adjusted life-year saved, which compares
