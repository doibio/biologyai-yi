Roasting is crucial for the distinct flavor of Wuyi rock tea (WRT). This study 
applied untargeted metabolomics to investigate the effects of roasting on 139 
WRT samples roasted at light fire (LF) or moderate fire (MF) intensities. 
Compared to LF, MF roasting led to a decrease in the cis/trans flavanol ratio by 
56% and theanine by 85%, while increasing the levels of 
N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidione-substituted flavanols (EPSFs), flavonol aglycones and 
flavone C-glycosides. Two new roast markers, 3-p-coumaroyl 1,5-lactone and 
4-p-coumaroyl 1,5-lactone, were identified in WRT and their formation increased 
with roasting temperature. MF roasting facilitated the formation of diverse 
heterocycles (e.g., pyrazines) and aldehydes (e.g., (Z)-4-heptenal and 
(E,E)-2.4-decadienal) that contributed to the augmented roasted and fatty odors 
in WRT. Additionally, the Maillard product furfuryl methyl ether was solely 
detected in MF samples. These findings provide novel insights into roast markers 
in WRT with implications for improving quality control measures during tea 
roasting.

The Healthy People 2030 goal is for 80% of all adolescents to complete their HPV 
vaccination series. Per the 2021, National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen), 
61.7% of adolescents have completed the series, and Indiana lags below the 
national average (55.2%). The present study estimated the 2-dose HPV vaccine 
series completion rates across Indiana counties among individuals aged 
9-14 years who received their first dose of vaccine and determined what factors 
were associated with series completion at the county level. The association of 
county-level sociodemographic and health measures with series completion was 
also examined. Data were extracted from the Indiana Immunization Information 
System (IIS), administered by the Indiana Department of Health. All vaccine 
providers are required to report all immunizations to the system for any patient 
under age 19 years. All Indiana children ages 9-14 years at the time of first 
dose who had initiated HPV vaccination in 2017 or 2018 were included. Two-dose 
series completion was evaluated through October of 2020, allowing a minimum gap 
of 22 months from first dose administration. All statistical analyses were 
conducted at the county-level. The Indiana HPV vaccination series completion 
rate among individuals that received the first dose was on average 73% across 
counties, ranging from 55.7% to 90.4%. Higher series completion was positively 
associated with primary care providers per capita, participation in mammography 
screening among Medicare enrollees, median household income, life expectancy, 
percentage of residents with some college, percentage of adults up-to-date with 
colonoscopy screening, and percentage of adults with flu vaccine. There was wide 
variability in series completion across Indiana counties. HPV series completion 
was associated with county-level sociodemographic and health measures, 
particularly variables reflecting difficulties with access to care and lack of 
financial resources.

INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative multisystemic 
disorder that affects approximately 2% of the population over 65 years old. This 
disorder is characterized by motor symptoms which are frequently accompanied by 
non-motor symptoms such as cognitive disorders. Current drug therapies aim to 
reduce the symptoms and increase the patient's life expectancy. Nevertheless, 
there is heterogeneity in therapy response in terms of efficacy and adverse 
effects. This wide range in response may be linked to genetic variability. Thus, 
it has been suggested that pharmacogenomics may help to tailor and personalize 
drug therapy for Parkinson's disease.
AREAS COVERED: This review describes and updates the clinical impact of genetic 
factors associated with the efficacy and adverse drug reactions related to 
common medications used to treat Parkinson's disease. Additionally, we highlight 
current informative recommendations for the drug treatment of Parkinson's 
disease.
EXPERT OPINION: The pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles of 
Parkinson's disease drugs do not favor the development of pharmacogenetic tests 
with a high probability of success. The chances of obtaining ground-breaking 
pharmacogenetics biomarkers for Parkinson's disease therapy are limited. 
Nevertheless, additional information on the metabolism of certain drugs, and an 
analysis of the potential of pharmacogenetics in novel drugs could be of 
interest.

Accumulated ethylene in fruit storage/transportation causes rapid senescence 
resulting in reduced shelf-life and postharvest losses. The aim of this study 
was to investigate the application of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photolysis 
modular reactor for fruit storage. The first experiment compared the 
effectiveness of VUV photolysis reactor with the standard fruit industry 
adsorbent (potassium permanganate, KMnO4) on the removal of ethylene from 
mixed-fruit loading of apples, banana, and pears stored at ambient temperature 
(16 °C) for 6 days. Second study evaluated the impact of direct VUV radiation on 
quality attributes of apples stored at 10 °C for 21 days. Results showed that 
ethylene produced in mixed-fruit loading storage significantly (p < 0.05) 
reduced by 86.9% in the storage chamber connected to VUV modular reactor 
compared to 25.4% for storage under potassium permanganate. Direct exposure of 
apples to VUV radiation successfully reduced both ethylene and respiration rate 
but damaged the skin of the apples. Hue angle and lightness (L*) for apples 
exposed to VUV radiation declined significantly (p < 0.05) from 60.7 ± 1.09 to 
33.5 ± 9.51 and 58.1 ± 3.60 to 50.4 ± 1.13, respectively. This study showed the 
potential of VUV photolysis as an innovative technique for removing ethylene 
from storage facility.

Activated PI3Kδ syndrome (APDS) is a rare inborn error of immunity (IEI) 
characterized primarily by frequent infections, lymphoproliferation and 
autoimmunity. Since its initial description in 2013, APDS has become part of the 
growing group of nearly 500 IEIs affecting various components of the immune 
system. The two subtypes of APDS - APDS1 and APDS2 - are caused by variants in 
the PIK3CD and PIK3R1 genes, respectively. Due to the rarity of the disease and 
the heterogeneous clinical picture, many patients are not diagnosed until years 
after symptom onset. Another challenge is the large number of PIK3CD and PIK3R1 
variants whose functional significance for developing APDS is inconclusive. 
Treatment of APDS has so far been mostly symptom-oriented with immunoglobulin 
replacement therapy, immunosuppressive therapies and antibiotic or antiviral 
prophylaxes. Additionally, allogeneic stem cell transplantation as well as new 
targeted therapies are options targeting the root cause that may improve 
patients' quality of life and life expectancy. However, the clinical course of 
the disease is difficult to predict which complicates the choice of appropriate 
therapies. This review article discusses diagnostic procedures and current and 
future treatment options, and highlights the difficulties that physicians, 
patients and their caretakers face in managing this complex disease. This 
article is based on cohort studies, the German and US guidelines on the 
management of primary immunodeficiencies as well as on published experience with 
diagnosis and compiled treatment experience for APDS.

Life-expectancy changes during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2019-2021: estimates 
from Japan, a country with low pandemic impact.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic had a low impact on Japan in 2020, but the 
size of the epidemic increased considerably there in 2021. This study made a 
statistical analysis of life expectancy changes up to the end of 2021 in Japan.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate changes in life expectancy from 2019 to 2021 
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. To do so, we decomposed the life 
expectancy changes from 2020-2021 into age-specific and cause of death-specific 
contributions.
METHODS: We used the absolute number of deaths by age and prefecture in Japan to 
calculate life expectancy from 2019-21 at both national and prefectural levels, 
and also examined the correlation between life expectancy gap and annual number 
of COVID-19 cases, total person-days spent in intensive care, and documented 
deaths due to COVID-19. We used the Arriaga decomposition method to decompose 
national life expectancy changes from 2020 to 2021 into age and cause of death 
components.
RESULTS: From 2019-2020, Japan's national level life expectancy across the 
entire population was extended by 0.24 years. From 2020-2021, it shortened by 
0.15 years. The life expectancy shortened more among women (0.15 years) than men 
(0.12 years). There was significant heterogeneity in life expectancy changes 
from 2020-2021 by prefecture. It ranged from the maximum shortening of 0.57 
years in Tottori prefecture to the maximum extension of 0.23 years in Fukui. The 
regression analysis revealed the negative correlation between the life 
expectancy change and burden of COVID-19 at prefectural level. The decomposition 
of life expectancy changes at birth from 2020-2021 showed that losses in life 
expectancy were largely attributable to the mortality of the population over 70 
years old. Changes in life expectancy among infants and working-age adults 
mostly contributed to lengthening overall life expectancy. Among leading major 
causes of death, deaths due to neoplastic tumor and cardiovascular diseases 
contributed to shortening life expectancy, whereas respiratory diseases did not.
CONCLUSION: The decades-long increasing trend in life expectancy was suspended 
by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, life expectancy changes from 2019-2020 and 
2020-2021 were small in Japan. This may be attributable to the small 
epidemiological impact of COVID-19 during this time period, but nonetheless, the 
negative impact of COVID-19 on life expectancy was indicated in the present 
study. The chance of death accelerated in older people in 2021, but a smaller 
number of deaths than usual among infants and working age adults contributed to 
extended life expectancy, and the change in the cause of death structure under 
the COVID-19 pandemic also significantly contributed to shortening life 
expectancy.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) mutant strains have been reported to extend the life 
span of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). However, the specific mechanisms 
through which the genes and pathways affect aging are not yet clear. In this 
study, we fed Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) various E. coli single-gene 
knockout strains to screen mutant strains with an extended lifespan. The results 
showed that D. melanogaster fed with E. coli purE had the longest mean lifespan, 
which was verified by C. elegans. We conducted RNA-sequencing and analysis of C. 
elegans fed with E. coli purE (a single-gene knockout mutant) to further explore 
the underlying molecular mechanism. We used differential gene expression (DGE) 
analysis, enrichment analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to screen 
vital genes and modules with significant changes in overall expression. Our 
results suggest that E. coli mutant strains may affect the host lifespan by 
regulating the protein synthesis rate (cfz-2) and ATP level (catp-4). To 
conclude, our study could provide new insights into the genetic influences of 
the microbiota on the life span of a host and a basis for developing anti-aging 
probiotics and drugs.

BACKGROUND: Apple disease, exaggerated by Botryosphaeria dothidea, is a foremost 
intimidating problem for extending the apple fruit shelf-life and producing 
substantial economic losses for cultivators and distributors. Alternate sources 
are urgently needed to prevent or inhibit the ring rot infection of apple fruit 
instigated by Botryosphaeria dothidea.
OBJECTIVE: In this current study, we premeditated to make novel organic 
nanoparticles as of Pouteria caimito fruit extract and calcium chloride (PCNP), 
which were used to evaluate the preventive outcome of Botryosphaeria 
dothidea-caused apple disease on postharvest apple fruits.
RESULTS: Our findings corroborated that the fruit derived nanoparticle had been 
confirmed for quality and size by altered estimations such as fourier transform 
infrared (FTIR), UV-vis spectroscopic analysis, scanning electron microscope and 
energy dispersive X-ray (SEM and EDX) estimation, and dynamic light scattering 
(DLS) analysis. In addition, we have investigated the excellent inhibitory 
action of the pathogen infection in apples initiated by Botryosphaeria dothidea. 
The protective enzymes function was pointedly improved in nanoparticle-treated 
apple fruits once equated with those of control apple fruits. The catalase (CAT) 
and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were pointedly improved in 
nanoparticle-treated fruits when compared to those of control fruits. The 
shelf-life extension studies were conducted for 7 days with a fresh-cut apple. 
The total soluble solid, pH, weight loss, and sensory studies were analyzed, and 
they proved the extension of sliced apple shelf life up to 7 days.
CONCLUSIONS: The discoveries of this study provided a well-organized, harmless, 
and environment-friendly substitute to control the apple disease as well as the 
durability postponement of sliced apples 7 days or may longer.

BACKGROUND: In a demonstration project, long-acting, injectable 
cabotegravir-rilpivirine (CAB-RPV) achieved viral suppression in a high 
proportion of people with HIV (PWH) who were virologically nonsuppressed with 
adherence barriers. We projected the long-term impact of CAB-RPV for 
nonsuppressed PWH experiencing adherence barriers.
METHODS: Using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC) 
model, we compared 3 strategies: (1) standard of care oral integrase 
inhibitor-based ART (INSTI); (2) INSTI-based ART with supportive social services 
("wraparound services" [WS]) (INSTI/WS); and (3) CAB-RPV with WS (CAB-RPV/WS). 
Model outcomes included viral suppression (%) and engagement in care (%) at 3 
years, and life expectancy (life-years [LYs]). Base case cohort characteristics 
included mean age of 47y (standard deviation [SD], 10y), 90% male at birth, and 
baseline mean CD4 count 150/µL (SD, 75/µL). Viral suppression at 3 months was 
13% (INSTI), 28% (INSTI/WS), and 60% (CAB-RPV/WS). Mean loss to follow-up was 
28/100 person-years (PY) (SD, 2/100 PY) without WS and 16/100 PY (SD, 1/100 PY) 
with WS.
RESULTS: Projected viral suppression at 3 years would vary widely: 16% (INSTI), 
38% (INSTI/WS), and 44% (CAB-RPV/WS). Life expectancy would be 7.4 LY (INSTI), 
9.0 LY (INSTI/WS), and 9.4 LY (CAB-RPV/WS). Projected benefits over oral ART 
would be greater for PWH initiating CAB-RPV/WS at lower CD4 counts. Across 
plausible key parameter ranges, CAB-RPV/WS would improve viral suppression and 
life expectancy compared with oral INSTI strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: These model-based results support that long-acting injectable 
CAB-RPV with extensive support services for nonsuppressed PWH experiencing 
adherence barriers is likely to increase viral suppression and improve survival. 
A prospective study to provide further evidence is needed.

Sire selection for beef on dairy crosses plays an important role in livestock 
systems as it may affect future performance and carcass traits of growing and 
finishing crossbred cattle. The phenotypic variation found in beef on dairy 
crosses has raised concerns from meat packers due to animals with dairy-type 
carcass characteristics. The use of morphometric measurements may help to 
understand the phenotypic structures of sire progeny for selecting animals with 
greater performance. In addition, due to the relationship with growth, these 
measurements could be used to early predict the performance until the transition 
from dairy farms to sales. The objectives of this study were 1) to evaluate the 
effect of different beef sires and breeds on the morphometric measurements of 
crossbred calves including cannon bone (CB), forearm (FA), hip height (HH), face 
length (FL), face width (FW) and growth performance; and (2) to predict the 
weight gain from birth to transition from dairy farms to sale (WG) and the body 
weight at sale (BW) using such morphometric measurements obtained at first days 
of animals' life. CB, FA, HH, FL, FW, and weight at 7 ± 5 d (BW7) (Table 1) were 
measured on 206 calves, from four different sire breeds [Angus (AN), SimAngus 
(SA), Simmental (SI), and Limousin (LI)], from five farms. To evaluate the 
morphometric measurements at the transition from dairy farms to sale and animal 
performance 91 out of 206 calves sourced from four farms, and offspring of two 
different sires (AN and SA) were used. To predict the WG and BW, 97 calves, and 
offspring of three different sires (AN, SA, and LI) were used. The data were 
analyzed using a mixed model, considering farm and sire as random effects. To 
predict WG and BW, two linear models (including or not the morphometric 
measurements) were used, and a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy was used 
to evaluate their predictive quality. The HH and BW7 were 7.67% and 10.7% higher 
(P < 0.05) in SA crossbred calves compared to AN, respectively. However, the ADG 
and adjusted body weight to 120 d were 14.3% and 9.46% greater (P < 0.05) in AN 
compared to SA. The morphometric measurements improved the model's predictive 
performance for WG and BW. In conclusion, morphometric measurements at the first 
days of calves' life can be used to predict animals' performance in beef on 
dairy. Such a strategy could lead to optimized management decisions and greater 
profitability in dairy farms.

Giant cell tumours (GCTs) of the bone often arise in the long bones while 
occurrence in smaller bones of the hand and feet is very rare. We report a case 
of GCT in the talus of a 17-year-old male who presented with a six-month history 
of worsening pain in his left ankle and loss of function, reducing his ability 
to walk and participate in sports. Radiographs of the ankle showed bony 
overgrowth on the head and neck of the talus with cortical breaching. MRI 
revealed possible extension into soft tissue and bone marrow oedema. CT scan 
also revealed an aggressive lytic lesion at the head and neck of the talus. He 
was managed with intralesional curettage and autologous bone grafting with bone 
harvested from the left knee. There was no evidence of recurrence at the 
six-month follow-up and the patient was able to walk freely. In conclusion, GCTs 
of the talus tend to occur in younger and healthier patients and have disastrous 
consequences if they persist, recur, or metastasize. Given the severe negative 
impact that GCTs have on a patient's quality of life, they must be ruled out 
when investigating any ankle pain or reduced mobility. Current treatment options 
have produced consistently positive results while novel therapies that enable a 
faster return to weight bearing and reduce recurrence appear promising.

Artificial intelligence (AI) today is very successful at standard 
pattern-recognition tasks due to the availability of large amounts of data and 
advances in statistical data-driven machine learning. However, there is still a 
large gap between AI pattern recognition and human-level concept learning. 
Humans can learn amazingly well even under uncertainty from just a few examples 
and are capable of generalizing these concepts to solve new conceptual problems. 
The growing interest in explainable machine intelligence requires experimental 
environments and diagnostic/benchmark datasets to analyze existing approaches 
and drive progress in pattern analysis and machine intelligence. In this paper, 
we provide an overview of current AI solutions for benchmarking concept 
learning, reasoning, and generalization; discuss the state-of-the-art of 
existing diagnostic/benchmark datasets (such as CLEVR, CLEVRER, CLOSURE, CURI, 
Bongard-LOGO, V-PROM, RAVEN, Kandinsky Patterns, CLEVR-Humans, CLEVRER-Humans, 
and their extension containing human language); and provide an outlook of some 
future research directions in this exciting research domain.

DNA nanotechnology has shown great promise for biosensing and molecular 
recognition. However, the practical application of conventional DNA biosensors 
is constrained by inadequate target stimuli, intricate design schemes, 
multicomponent systems, and susceptibility to nuclease degradation. To overcome 
these limitations, we present a class of starlike branched and multiplex 
embedded system (SBES) with an integrated functional design and cascade 
exponential amplification for serum microRNA (miRNA) detection. The DNA arms can 
be integrated into an all-in-one system by surrounding a branch point, with each 
arm endowed with specific functionalities by embedding different DNA fragments. 
These fragments include a segment complementary to the target miRNA for the 
recognition element, palindromic tails for self-primed polymerization, and a 
region with the same sequences as the target serving as the target analogue. 
Upon exposure to a target miRNA, the DNA arms unwind in a stepwise manner 
through palindrome-mediated dimerization and polymerization. This enables target 
recycling for subsequent reactions while releasing the target analogue to 
generate a secondary response in a feedback manner. A comparative analysis 
illustrates that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a full SBES with a feedback 
strategy is approximately 250% higher than the system without a feedback design. 
We demonstrate that the four-arm 4pSBES has the benefits of multifunctional 
integration, enhanced sensitivity, and low false-positive signals, which makes 
this approach ideally suited for clinical diagnosis. Moreover, an upgraded SBES 
with additional DNA arms (e.g., 6pSBES) can be constructed to allow 
multifunctional extension, offering unprecedented opportunities to build 
versatile DNA nanostructures for biosensing.

Sciences, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, South Africa.

Exposure to air pollution is a fundamental obstacle that makes it complex to 
realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 3) for good health and 
wellbeing. It is for this reason that air pollution has been characterized as 
the global environmental health risk facing the current generation. The risks of 
air pollution on morbidity, and life expectancy are well documented. This feeds 
directly to the substantial body of the literature that exists regarding the 
burden of diseases associated with ambient air pollution. However, the bulk of 
this literature originates from developed countries. Whilst most of the 
sub-Saharan African studies extrapolate literature from developed countries to 
contextualize the risks of elevated air pollution exposure levels associated 
with the burden of disease. However, extrapolation of epidemiological evidence 
from developed countries is problematic given that it disregards the social 
vulnerability. Therefore, given this observation, it is ideal to evaluate if the 
monitoring executions of hazardous particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide do 
take into consideration the concerted necessary efforts to associate monitored 
air pollution exposure levels with the burden of disease. Therefore, based on 
this background, the current meta-analysis evaluated air quality monitoring 
associated with the burden of disease across sub-Saharan Africa. To this extent, 
the current meta-analysis strictly included peer-reviewed published journal 
articles from the sub-Saharan African regions to gain insight on air quality 
monitoring associated with the burden of disease. The collected meta-analysis 
data was captured and subsequently analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2019. This 
program facilitated the presentation of the meta-analysis data in the form of 
graphs and numerical techniques. Generally, the results indicate that the 
sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by a substantial gap in the number of 
regional studies that evaluate the burden of disease in relation with exposure 
to air quality.Implications: The work presented here is an original contribution 
and provides a comprehensive yet succinct overview of the monitoring associated 
with the burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa. The author explores if the 
monitoring executions of hazardous particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide do 
take into considerations the concerted necessary efforts to associate monitored 
air pollution exposure levels with the burden of disease. The manuscript 
includes the most relevant and current literature in a field of study that has 
not received a deserving degree of research attention in recent years. This is 
especially true in sub-Saharan Africa, characterized by insufficient monitoring 
of air quality exposure concentrations.

Granulosa cells (GCs), as the basic components of ovarian tissue, play an 
indispensable role in maintaining normal ovarian functions such as hormone 
synthesis and ovulation. The abnormality of GCs often leads to ovarian endocrine 
disorders, which exert a negative effect on life quality and life expectancy. 
However, the pathogenesis and treatment of diseases are still poorly understood. 
Exosomes contain regulatory molecules and can transmit biological information in 
cell interaction. The role of exosomes in GCs has been studied extensively. This 
review summarizes the regulatory function of exosomes in GCs, as well as their 
participation in etiopathogenesis and their promising application in treatment 
when it comes to ovarian endocrine diseases, which can help us better understand 
ovarian diseases from the perspective of GCs.

BACKGROUND: Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a very rare, severe 
genetic disorder triggered by a gain-of-function mutation in the ACVR1 gene that 
codes for the type I bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor ACVR1 
(activin A receptor-type 1), also known as ALK2 (activin receptor-like 
kinase-2). It leads to the onset and progression of heterotopic ossification 
(HO) in soft and connective tissue. HO is often preceded by episodes of soft 
tissue swelling or flare-ups. Flare-ups, characteristic of FOP, may be induced 
by trauma, infection, vaccination, or other medications, as well as surgical 
procedures or may occur spontaneously. As patients age, they develop severe 
mobility limitations due to progressive HO formation, including immobility, 
causing a shortened life expectancy. FOP's first characteristic clinical sign is 
the congenital malformation of one or both big toes with valgus axis deviation, 
which is present in almost all patients. To confirm the diagnosis, molecular 
genetic analysis of the ACVR1 gene is possible.
AIM OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS: This white paper aims to provide an overview of the 
necessary prerequisites and conditions for the care of patients with FOP and 
positively contribute to patients with FOP by improving the overall availability 
of knowledge. To achieve this, relevant aspects of the care of the very rare 
disease FOP are presented, from the initial diagnosis to the care in regular 
care based on the authors' knowledge (German FOP network) and the international 
FOP Treatment Guidelines. The recommendations presented here are addressed to 
all actors and decision-makers in the health care system and are also intended 
to inform patients and the public.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Bei der Fibrodysplasia ossificans 
progressiva (FOP) handelt es sich um eine sehr seltene, genetisch bedingte 
Erkrankung, ausgelöst durch eine „Gain-of-function“-Mutation im ACVR1-Gen, 
welches den Typ-I-Bone-Morphogenetic-Protein(BMP)-Rezeptor ACVR1 
(„activin A receptor type 1“) – auch bekannt als ALK2 („activin receptor-like 
kinase 2“) kodiert. Diese Mutation führt zum Auftreten und Fortschreiten 
heterotoper Ossifikationen (HO) im Weich- und Bindegewebe. Der HO gehen oft 
Episoden von Weichteilschwellungen, sogenannte Flare-ups voraus. Die für FOP 
charakteristischen Flare-ups können durch Traumata, Infektionen, Impfungen oder 
andere medizinische sowie chirurgische Eingriffe induziert werden oder spontan 
auftreten. Mit fortschreitendem Alter der Patient:innen kommt es bei den 
Betroffenen aufgrund zunehmender HO zu schwerwiegenden Bewegungseinschränkungen 
bis hin zur Bewegungsunfähigkeit, die mit einer verkürzten Lebenserwartung 
einhergeht. Ein erstes charakteristisches klinisches Anzeichen für FOP ist die 
angeborene Fehlbildung der Großzehen [25] mit valgischer Achsabweichung, die bei 
fast allen Patient:innen auftritt. Um die Diagnose zu sichern, ist eine 
molekulargenetische Analyse des ACVR1-Gens möglich.
ZIEL DER EMPFEHLUNGEN: Ziel der vorliegenden Handlungsempfehlungen ist es, einen 
Überblick über die notwendigen Voraussetzungen und Bedingungen für die 
Versorgung von Patient:innen mit FOP zu geben und durch eine bessere 
Verfügbarkeit von Wissen insgesamt einen positiven Beitrag für Patient:innen mit 
FOP zu leisten. Um dies zu erreichen, werden relevante Aspekte bei der 
Versorgung der sehr seltenen Erkrankung FOP vorgestellt, von der initialen 
Diagnose bis zur Betreuung in der Regelversorgung, basierend auf dem Wissen der 
Autor:innen (deutsches FOP-Netzwerk) und den internationalen FOP Treatment 
Guidelines. Die hier vorgestellten Empfehlungen richten sich an alle 
Akteur:innen und Entscheidungsträger:innen im Gesundheitswesen und sollen 
darüber hinaus der Information von Betroffenen und der Öffentlichkeit dienen.

Our understanding of prehistoric societal organization at the family level is 
still limited. Here, we generated genome data from 32 individuals from an 
approximately 3,800-y-old burial mound attributed to the Bronze Age 
Srubnaya-Alakul cultural tradition at the site of Nepluyevsky, located in the 
Southern Ural region of Central Eurasia. We found that life expectancy was 
generally very low, with adult males living on average 8 y longer than females. 
A total of 35 first-degree, 40 second-degree, and 48 third-degree biological 
relationships connected 23 of the studied individuals, allowing us to propose a 
family tree spanning three generations with six brothers at its center. The 
oldest of these brothers had eight children with two women and the most children 
overall, whereas the other relationships were monogamous. Notably, related 
female children above the age of five were completely absent from the site, and 
adult females were more genetically diverse than males. These results suggest 
that biological relationships between male siblings played a structural role in 
society and that descent group membership was based on patrilineality. Women 
originated from a larger mating network and moved to join the men, with whom 
they were buried. Finally, the oldest brother likely held a higher social 
position, which was expressed in terms of fertility.

INTRODUCTION: Polypharmacy is common in older adults with cancer and is 
associated with drug related problems (DRPs) and potentially inappropriate 
medication (PIM). We introduced a medication optimization care pathway for older 
adults with advanced cancer and a limited life expectancy and studied the 
prevalence of DRPs and PIMs as well as the adherence to medication-related 
recommendations and the patient satisfaction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A medication review was performed in patients aged 
≥65 years with polypharmacy and a life expectancy of <24 months. Recommendations 
on adjustments of medication were discussed in a multidisciplinary team 
including a pharmacist, an oncologist, and a geriatrician. Implementation of the 
recommendations was left to the discretion of the oncologist. Four weeks after 
the implementation, the patient filled a questionnaire to assess satisfaction.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty patients were included. The mean age was 75 years 
and 39% were female. A mean of 12 medications was used. The median number of DRP 
was 6.0 per patient and median number of PIMs was 3.0 per patient. Overtreatment 
accounted for 26% of DRP and the most frequently involved drug classes were 
antihypertensive medication (22%), non-opioid analgesics (22%), and antilipemics 
(12%). The multidisciplinary team accepted 78% of the recommendations of the 
pharmacist and the oncologist implemented 54% of the recommendations. Overall, 
patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the intervention.
DISCUSSION: DRPs and PIMs are highly prevalent in this population and can be 
reduced by a multidisciplinary medication optimization intervention. Patients 
appreciate the medication optimization intervention and are satisfied with the 
intervention.
