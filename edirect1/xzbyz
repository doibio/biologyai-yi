BACKGROUND: Cervical Cancer (CC) has become a public health concern of alarming 
proportions in many developing countries such as Mexico, particularly in low 
income sectors and marginalized regions. As such, an early detection is a key 
medical factor in improving not only their population's quality of life but also 
its life expectancy. Interestingly, there has been an increase in the number of 
reports describing successful attempts at detecting cancer cells in human 
tissues or fluids using trained (sniffer) dogs. The great odor detection 
threshold exhibited by dogs is not unheard of. However, this represented a 
potential opportunity to develop an affordable, accessible, and non-invasive 
method for detection of CC.
METHODS: Using clicker training, a male beagle was trained to recognize CC odor. 
During training, fresh CC biopsies were used as a reference point. Other samples 
used included cervical smears on glass slides and medical surgical bandages used 
as intimate sanitary pads by CC patients. A double-blind procedure was exercised 
when testing the beagle's ability to discriminate CC from control samples.
RESULTS: The beagle was proven able to detect CC-specific volatile organic 
compounds (VOC) contained in both fresh cervical smear samples and adsorbent 
material samples. Beagle's success rate at detecting and discriminating CC and 
non-CC odors, as indicated by specificity and sensitivity values recorded during 
the experiment, stood at an overall high (>90%). CC-related VOC in adsorbent 
materials were detectable after only eight hours of use by CC patients.
CONCLUSION: Present data suggests different applications for VOC from the 
uterine cervix to be used in the detection and diagnosis of CC. Furthermore, 
data supports the use of trained dogs as a viable, affordable, non-invasive and, 
therefore, highly relevant alternative method for detection of CC lesions. 
Additional benefits of this method include its quick turnaround time and ease of 
use while remaining highly accurate and robust.

BACKGROUND: Screening is the main preventive method for cervical cancer in 
developing countries, but each type of screening has advantages and 
disadvantages. To investigate the most suitable method for low-income areas in 
China, we conducted a health economic analysis comparing three methods: visual 
inspection with acetic acid and Lugol's iodine (VIA/VILI), ThinPrep cytology 
test (TCT), and human papillomavirus (HPV) test.
METHODS: We recruited 3086 women aged 35-65 years using cluster random sampling. 
Each participant was randomly assigned to one of three cervical cancer screening 
groups: VIA/VILI, TCT, or HPV test. In order to calculate the number of 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted by each screening method, we used 
Markov models to estimate the natural development of cervical cancer over a 
15-year period to estimate the age of onset and duration of each disease stage. 
The cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), net present values (NPVs), benefit-cost 
ratios (BCRs), and cost-utility ratios (CURs) were used as outcomes in the 
health economic analysis.
RESULTS: The positive detection rate in the VIA/VILI group was 1.39%, which was 
4.6 and 2.0 times higher than the rates in the TCT and HPV test groups, 
respectively. The positive predictive value of VIA/VILI (10.53%) was highest 
while the rate of referral for colposcopy was lowest for those in the HPV + TCT 
group (0.60%). VIA/VILI performed the best in terms of health economic 
evaluation results, as the cost of per positive case detected was 8467.9 RMB, 
which was 24503.0 RMB lower than that for TCT and 5755.9 RMB lower than that for 
the HPV test. In addition, the NPV and BCR values were 258011.5 RMB and 3.18 
(the highest), and the CUR was 2341.8 RMB (the lowest). The TCT performed the 
worst, since its NPV was <0 and the BCR was <1, indicative of being poorly 
cost-beneficial.
CONCLUSIONS: With the best economic evaluation results and requiring minimum 
medical resources, VIA/VILI is recommended for cervical cancer screening in 
poverty-stricken areas in China with high incidence of cervical cancer and lack 
of medical resources.

BACKGROUND: Less than one-third of patients who are estimated to be infected 
with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) receive MDR-TB treatment 
regimens, and only 48% of those who received treatment have successful outcomes. 
Despite current regimens, newer, more effective and cost-effective approaches to 
treatment are needed. The aim of the study was to project health outcomes and 
impact on healthcare resources of adding bedaquiline to the treatment regimen of 
MDR-TB in selected high burden countries: Estonia, Russia, South Africa, Peru, 
China, the Philippines, and India.
METHODS: This study adapted an existing Markov model to estimate the health 
outcomes and impact on total healthcare costs of adding bedaquiline to current 
MDR-TB treatment regimens. A price threshold analysis was conducted to determine 
the price range at which bedaquiline would be cost-effective.
RESULTS: Adding bedaquiline to the background regimen (BR) resulted in increased 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, and reduced total healthcare 
costs (excluding treatment acquisition costs) compared with BR alone in all 
countries analyzed. Addition of bedaquiline to BR resulted in savings to 
healthcare costs compared with BR alone in all countries analyzed, with the 
highest impact expected in Russia (US$194 million) and South Africa (US$43 
million). The price per regimen at which bedaquiline would be cost-effective 
ranged between US$23,904-US$203,492 in Estonia, Russia, Peru, South Africa, and 
China (high and upper middle-income countries) and between US$6,996-US$20,323 in 
the Philippines and India (lower middle-income countries); however, these 
cost-effective prices do not necessarily address concerns about affordability.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding bedaquiline to BR provides improvements in health outcomes 
and reductions in healthcare costs in high MDR-TB burden countries. The range of 
prices per regimen for which bedaquiline would be cost-effective varied between 
countries.

BACKGROUND: Behavioural counselling with intensive follow-up for obesity is 
effective, but in resource-constrained primary care settings briefer approaches 
are needed.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an 
internet-based behavioural intervention with regular face-to-face or remote 
support in primary care, compared with brief advice.
DESIGN: Individually randomised three-arm parallel trial with health economic 
evaluation and nested qualitative interviews.
SETTING: Primary care general practices in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a body mass index of ≥ 30 kg/m2 (or ≥ 28 kg/m2 with 
risk factors) identified from general practice records, recruited by postal 
invitation.
INTERVENTIONS: Positive Online Weight Reduction (POWeR+) is a 24-session, 
web-based weight management intervention completed over 6 months. Following 
online registration, the website randomly allocated participants using 
computer-generated random numbers to (1) the control intervention (n = 279), 
which had previously been demonstrated to be clinically effective (brief 
web-based information that minimised pressure to cut down foods, instead 
encouraging swaps to healthier choices and increasing fruit and vegetables, plus 
6-monthly nurse weighing); (2) POWeR+F (n = 269), POWeR+ supplemented by 
face-to-face nurse support (up to seven contacts); or (3) POWeR+R (n = 270), 
POWeR+ supplemented by remote nurse support (up to five e-mails or brief 
telephone calls).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a modelled estimate of average 
weight reduction over 12 months, assessed blind to group where possible, using 
multiple imputation for missing data. The secondary outcome was the number of 
participants maintaining a 5% weight reduction at 12 months.
RESULTS: A total of 818 eligible individuals were randomised using 
computer-generated random numbers. Weight change, averaged over 12 months, was 
documented in 666 out of 818 participants (81%; control, n = 227; POWeR+F, 
n = 221; POWeR+R, n = 218). The control group maintained nearly 3 kg of weight 
loss per person (mean weight per person: baseline, 104.4 kg; 6 months, 101.9 kg; 
12 months, 101.7 kg). Compared with the control group, the estimated additional 
weight reduction with POWeR+F was 1.5 kg [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6 to 
2.4 kg; p = 0.001] and with POWeR+R was 1.3 kg (95% CI 0.34 to 2.2 kg; 
p = 0.007). By 12 months the mean weight loss was not statistically 
significantly different between groups, but 20.8% of control participants, 29.2% 
of POWeR+F participants (risk ratio 1.56, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.51; p = 0.070) and 
32.4% of POWeR+R participants (risk ratio 1.82, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.74; p = 0.004) 
maintained a clinically significant 5% weight reduction. The POWeR+R group had 
fewer individuals who reported doing another activity to help lose weight 
[control, 47.1% (64/136); POWeR+F, 37.2% (51/137); POWeR+R, 26.7% (40/150)]. The 
incremental cost to the health service per kilogram weight lost, compared with 
the control group, was £18 (95% CI -£129 to £195) for POWeR+F and -£25 (95% CI 
-£268 to £157) for POWeR+R. The probability of being cost-effective at a 
threshold of £100 per kilogram was 88% and 98% for POWeR+F and POWeR+R, 
respectively. POWeR+R was dominant compared with the control group. No harms 
were reported and participants using POWeR+ felt more enabled in managing their 
weight. The qualitative studies documented that POWeR+ was viewed positively by 
patients and that health-care professionals generally enjoyed supporting 
patients using POWeR+.
STUDY LIMITATIONS: Maintenance of weight loss after 1 year is unknown.
FUTURE WORK: Identifying strategies for longer-term engagement, impact in 
community settings and increasing physical activity.
CONCLUSION: Clinically valuable weight loss (> 5%) is maintained in 20% of 
individuals using novel written materials with brief follow-up. A web-based 
behavioural programme and brief support results in greater mean weight loss and 
10% more participants maintain valuable weight loss; it achieves greater 
enablement and fewer participants undertaking other weight-loss activities; and 
it is likely to be cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy has increased overall, health-related quality of 
life is now more important than ever. This is especially relevant in countries 
such as South Korea that are concerned about unmet healthcare needs and 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Thus, we investigated the relationship 
between unmet healthcare needs and HRQoL in the general population.
METHODS: We used data from the 2011 to 2013 Korea Health Panel Survey, which 
included data from 8150 baseline participants of 19 years of age or older. We 
measured HRQoL using the EQ-5D and EQ-VAS indices. In addition, we used 
generalized estimating equations to perform a longitudinal regression analysis.
RESULTS: Approximately 13.1% of the participants (n = 1068) experienced unmet 
healthcare needs. Individuals with unmet healthcare needs due to economic 
hardship tended to have lower values than those without unmet healthcare needs 
for EQ-5D and EQ-VAS indices (EQ-5D: -2.688, P < 0.0001; EQ-VAS: -5.256, P < 
0.0001). Additionally, when stratified by gender, both male and female subjects 
who had unmet healthcare needs and low economic status had a drastic decrease in 
HRQoL regardless of the reasons for their unmet healthcare needs.
CONCLUSIONS: Unmet healthcare needs influences HRQoL, which was more pronounced 
in economically vulnerable groups. Thus, interventions to address HRQoL problems 
should focus on implementing a guarantee of healthcare services for economically 
vulnerable groups.

Osteoporosis could contribute to increase other chronic diseases such as 
cardiovascular events, resulting in higher mortality in these patients. 
Antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphonates has been reported to reduce not 
only the number of fragile fracture but also all causes mortality. These agents 
are also expected to improve quality of life and activity of daily life with 
longer life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) increases life expectancy in 
patients with COPD and severe hypoxemia. Smoking is the main cause of burn 
injury during LTOT. Policy regarding smoking while on LTOT varies between 
countries. In this study, we compare the incidence of burn injury that required 
contact with a health care specialist, between Sweden (a country with a strict 
policy regarding smoking while on LTOT) and Denmark (a country with less strict 
smoking policy).
METHODS: This was a population-based, cohort study of patients initiating LTOT 
due to any cause in Sweden and Denmark. Data on diagnoses, external causes, and 
procedures were obtained from the Swedish and Danish National Patient Registers 
for inpatient and outpatient care. Patients were followed from January 1, 2000, 
until the first of the following: LTOT withdrawal, death, or study end (December 
31, 2009). The primary end point was burn injury during LTOT.
RESULTS: A total of 23,741 patients received LTOT in Denmark and 7,754 patients 
in Sweden. Most patients started LTOT due to COPD, both in Sweden (74%) and in 
Denmark (62%). The rate of burn injury while on LTOT was higher in Denmark than 
in Sweden; 170 (95% confidence interval [CI], 126-225) vs 85 (95% CI, 44-148) 
per 100,000 person-years; rate ratio 2.0 (95% CI, 1.0-4.1). The risk remained 
higher after adjustment for gender, age, and diagnosis in multivariate Cox 
regression, hazard ratio 1.8 (95% CI, 1.0-3.5). Thirty-day mortality after burn 
injury was 8% in both countries.
CONCLUSION: Compared to Sweden, the rate of burn injury was twice as high in 
Denmark where smoking is not a contraindication for prescribing LTOT.

Heart disease-related deaths are the highest in most societies and congenital 
heart diseases account for approximately 40% of prenatal deaths and over 20% of 
mortality in the first few months after birth. Congenital heart disease affects 
approximately 1% of all newborns and is the causative factor for more deaths 
within the first year of life as compared to all other genetic defects. Advances 
in treatment approaches increased life expectancy and led to an expansion of 
adult population with clinical manifestation of congenital heart defects in up 
to 90% of the children born with congenital heart diseases. Regulation of 
cardiac gene expression involves multiple independent enhancers that play a 
critical role in maintaining a restricted and specific pattern of gene 
expression in the heart. Cardiac transcriptional pathways are intimately 
regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small, regulatory RNAs, approximately 
22 nucleotides in length, also coded by specific genes. These miRNAs act as 
suppressors of gene expression by inhibiting translation and/or promoting 
degradation of target protein-coding mRNAs. There are several miRNAs involved in 
the development of heart and dysregulation of specific miRNAs is associated with 
congenital and other cardiac defects. Stress responsive cardiac hypertrophy is 
orchestrated among other factors, by specific miRNAs. miRNAs such as miR-499 are 
considered useful as biomarkers of a given heart disease. Therapeutic 
application of miRNAs is also envisaged considering the small size and specific 
effects of these molecules. In this review, we addressed different roles of 
miRNAs in the development and diseases of the heart.

Population aging is rapidly accelerating worldwide; however, longer life 
expectancy is not the only public health goal. Indeed, extended lifetime 
involves maintaining function and the capacity of living independently. 
Sarcopenia and physical frailty are both highly relevant entities with regards 
to functionality and autonomy of older adults. The concepts and definitions of 
frailty and sarcopenia have largely been revised over the years. Sarcopenia is 
an age-related progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and 
strength. On the other hand, frailty is a state of increased vulnerability to 
stressors, responsible for exposing the older person to enhanced risk of adverse 
outcomes. Physical frailty and sarcopenia substantially overlap and several 
adverse outcomes of frailty are likely mediated by sarcopenia. Indeed, the 
concepts of sarcopenia and physical frailty can be perceived as related to the 
same target organ (i.e., skeletal muscle) and it may be possible to combine them 
into a unique definition. The biological background of such a close relationship 
needs to be explored and clarified as it can potentially provide novel and 
pivotal insights for the assessment and treatment of these conditions in old 
age. The aim of this paper is to indicate and discuss possible biological 
markers to be considered in the framing of physical frailty and sarcopenia.

AIMS: To compare the cost-effectiveness of 2 glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
receptor agonists, liraglutide 1.8 mg and lixisenatide 20 µg, in the UK setting 
based on the LIRA-LIXI trial (NCT01973231).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Projections of costs (in 2015 pounds sterling [£]) and 
clinical outcomes were made over patient lifetimes using the IMS CORE Diabetes 
Model (IMS Health, Basel, Switzerland). The baseline cohort and treatment 
effects applied after initiation of GLP-1 receptor agonists were taken from the 
LIRA-LIXI trial. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3.5% 
annually.
RESULTS: Liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with improved discounted 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (8.87 vs 8.76 quality-adjusted life years 
[QALYs]) vs lixisenatide 20 µg. A greater reduction in glycated haemoglobin with 
liraglutide 1.8 mg led to fewer diabetes-related complications and delayed their 
time of onset. Liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with increased total costs 
(£37 153 vs £36 174), driven by higher acquisition costs, but this was partially 
offset by savings from diabetes-related complications avoided (£26 969 vs 
£27 912). Liraglutide 1.8 mg was associated with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of £8901 per QALY gained vs lixisenatide 20 µg.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term projections suggest that treatment of patients with type 
2 diabetes with liraglutide 1.8 mg is likely to be considered highly 
cost-effective compared with lixisenatide 20 µg treatment in the UK setting.

pleural catheters (IPCs) in patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE).
METHODS: We prospectively collected data from patients with MPE undergoing IPC 
placement between January of 2014 and July of 2015. All patients submitted to 
IPC placement had a life expectancy > 30 days, in accordance with the MPE 
treatment guidelines established by the British Thoracic Society. The data 
collected included gender, age, body mass index, primary cancer site, duration 
of IPC drainage, IPC-related complications, length of hospital stay, pleural 
effusion recurrence, and occurrence of spontaneous pleurodesis.
RESULTS: A total of 19 patients underwent IPC placement during the study period. 
Median overall survival after IPC insertion was 145 days. The median follow-up 
among the surviving patients was 125 days (range, 53-485 days), and the median 
time between catheter insertion and removal was 31 days (range, 2-126 days). 
There were IPC-related complications in 5 patients (26.2%), and spontaneous 
pleurodesis was achieved in 8 (42.0%). Among those 8 patients, the IPC was 
removed between days 30 and 126 in 4, and spontaneous pleurodesis occurred 
within the first 30 days in 4.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of IPCs seems to be feasible and safe in patients with MPE.
OBJETIVO: Avaliar a segurança e a viabilidade do uso de cateter pleural de longa 
permanência (CPLP) em pacientes com derrame pleural neoplásico (DPN).
MÉTODOS: Dados referentes a pacientes com DPN que receberam CPLP entre janeiro 
de 2014 e julho de 2015 foram colhidos prospectivamente. Todos os pacientes que 
receberam CPLP tinham expectativa de vida > 30 dias, em conformidade com as 
diretrizes de tratamento de DPN da Sociedade Torácica Britânica. Foram colhidos 
dados sobre sexo, idade, índice de massa corporal, local do câncer primário, 
tempo de drenagem com o CPLP, complicações relacionadas com o CPLP, tempo de 
internação hospitalar, recidiva do derrame pleural e ocorrência de pleurodese 
espontânea.
RESULTADOS: Dezenove pacientes receberam CPLP durante o período de estudo. A 
mediana de sobrevida global após a inserção do CPLP foi de 145 dias. A mediana 
de tempo de acompanhamento dos pacientes sobreviventes foi de 125 dias 
(variação: 53-485 dias), e a mediana de tempo decorrido entre a inserção e a 
remoção do cateter foi de 31 dias (variação: 2-126 dias). Houve complicações 
relacionadas com o CPLP em 5 pacientes (26,2%) e pleurodese espontânea em 8 
(42,0%). Nesses 8 pacientes, o CPLP foi retirado entre os dias 30 e 126 em 4, e 
a pleurodese espontânea ocorreu nos primeiros 30 dias em 4.
CONCLUSÕES: O uso de CPLP parece ser viável e seguro em pacientes com DPN.

The development of packaging materials with new functionalities and lower 
environmental impact is now an urgent need of our society. On one hand, the 
shelf-life extension of packaged products can be an answer to the exponential 
increase of worldwide demand for food. On the other hand, uncertainty of crude 
oil prices and reserves has imposed the necessity to find raw materials to 
replace oil-derived polymers. Additionally, consumers' awareness toward 
environmental issues increasingly pushes industries to look with renewed 
interest to "green" solutions. In response to these issues, numerous polymers 
have been exploited to develop biodegradable food packaging materials. Although 
the use of biopolymers has been limited due to their poor mechanical and barrier 
properties, these can be enhanced by adding reinforcing nanosized components to 
form nanocomposites. Cellulose is probably the most used and well-known 
renewable and sustainable raw material. The mechanical properties, reinforcing 
capabilities, abundance, low density, and biodegradability of nanosized 
cellulose make it an ideal candidate for polymer nanocomposites processing. Here 
we review the potential applications of cellulose based nanocomposites in food 
packaging materials, highlighting the several types of biopolymers with 
nanocellulose fillers that have been used to form bio-nanocomposite materials. 
The trends in nanocellulose packaging applications are also addressed.

BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials have shown that pembrolizumab significantly 
prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival compared with 
ipilimumab in ipilimumab-naïve patients with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma. However, there has been no published evidence on the 
cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for this indication.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus 
ipilimumab in ipilimumab-naïve patients with unresectable or meta-static 
melanoma from a U.S. integrated health system perspective.
METHODS: A partitioned-survival model was developed, which divided overall 
survival time into progression-free survival and postprogression survival. The 
model used Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival and overall 
survival from a recent randomized phase 3 study (KEYNOTE-006) that compared 
pembrolizumab and ipilimumab. Extrapolation of progression-free survival and 
overall survival beyond the clinical trial was based on parametric functions and 
literature data. The base-case time horizon was 20 years, and costs and health 
outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. Clinical data-including 
progression-free survival and overall survival data spanning a median follow-up 
time of 15 months, as well as quality of life and adverse event data from the 
ongoing KEYNOTE-006 trial-and cost data from public sources were used to 
populate the model. Costs included those of drug acquisition, treatment 
administration, adverse event management, and disease management of advanced 
melanoma. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost 
difference per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was the main outcome, 
and a series of sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of 
the results.
RESULTS: In the base case, pembrolizumab was projected to increase the life 
expectancy of U.S. patients with advanced melanoma by 1.14 years, corresponding 
to a gain of 0.79 discounted QALYs over ipilimumab. The model also projected an 
average increase of $63,680 in discounted perpatient costs of treatment with 
pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab. The corresponding ICER was $81,091 per QALY 
($68,712 per life-year) over a 20-year time horizon. With $100,000 per QALY as 
the threshold, when input parameters were varied in deterministic one-way 
sensitivity analyses, the use of pembrolizumab was cost-effective relative to 
ipilimumab in most ranges. Further, in a comprehensive probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis, the ICER was cost-effective in 83% of the simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with ipilimumab, pembrolizumab had higher expected QALYs 
and was cost-effective for the treatment of patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma from a U.S. integrated health system perspective.

PURPOSE: To explore, in a dose-escalation study, the feasibility of hyperbaric 
oxygen (HBO) treatments immediately before intensity modulated radiation therapy 
in conjunction with cisplatinum chemotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck (SCCHN).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients presented with SCCHN (stage III-IV 
[M0]), life expectancy >6 months, and Karnofsky performance status ≥70. 
Enrollees received intensity modulated radiation therapy, 70 Gy in 35 fractions 
over 7 weeks with weekly cisplatinum. Patients received HBO-100% oxygen, 
2.4 atmospheres absolute (ATA) for 30 minutes-twice per week initially. 
Subsequent patients were escalated to 3 and then 5 times per week. Intensity 
modulated radiation therapy began within 15 minutes after HBO. Patients were 
followed for 2 years after RT with quality-of-life questionnaires (Performance 
Status Scale-Head and Neck Cancer and the Functional Assessment of Cancer 
Therapy-Head and Neck Cancer) and for 5+ years for local recurrence, distant 
metastases, disease-specific survival, and overall survival.
RESULTS: Twelve subjects enrolled from 3 centers. Two withdrew during radiation 
therapy and 1 within 14 weeks after radiation therapy. The remaining 9 had 
primary oropharyngeal disease and were stage IVA (7) or IVB (2). No 
dose-limiting toxicities were observed with daily HBO. Two patients (22%) 
required pressure equalization tubes. The average time between HBO and radiation 
therapy was 8.5 minutes, with 2 of 231 administrations delivered beyond 
15 minutes (0.5%). Per-protocol analysis showed a clinical complete response in 
7 and a pathologic complete response without tumor in salvage neck dissections 
in 2. With minimum follow-up of 61 months, per-protocol 5-year overall survival 
was 100%, local recurrence 0%, and distant metastases 11%. Patient-reported 
outcomes for quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and 
Neck Cancer) were comparable to published results for chemoradiotherapy without 
HBO.
CONCLUSIONS: While acknowledging the study's small size and early attrition of 3 
patients, our in-depth review of the acquired data indicates the feasibility of 
combining HBO with chemoradiation.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate fludeoxyglucose F 18 
positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18FDG-PET/CT) parameters as 
predictive of response after stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for lung 
oligometastases.
METHODS: The inclusion criteria of the current retrospective study were as 
follows: (1) lung oligometastases treated by SABR, (2) presence of 18FDG-PET/CT 
before and after SABR for at least two subsequent evaluations, (3) Karnofsky 
performance status higher than 80, and (4) life expectancy longer than 6 months. 
All patients were treated with a biologically equivalent dose of at least 100 Gy 
with an alpha/beta ratio of 10. The following metabolic parameters were 
semiquantitatively defined: maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), mean 
standardized uptake value (SUVmean), metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion 
glycolysis.
RESULTS: A total of 50 patients met the inclusion criteria, for a total of 70 
lung metastases. The pre-SABR median SUVmax was 6.5 (range 4-17), the median 
SUVmean was 3.7 (range 2.5-6.5), and the median metabolic tumor volume was 2.3 
cm3 (0.2-31 cm3). The following metabolic parameters were significantly related 
to complete response at 6 months: SUVmax less than 5 (p < 0.001) and SUVmean 
less than 3.5 (p = 0.03). ΔSUVmax at 3 to 6 months was +126% for lesions with 
in-field progression versus -26% for the remaining lesions (p = 0.002). ΔSUVmean 
at 3 to 6 months was +15% for lesions with in-field progression versus -26% for 
the remaining metastases (p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: In the current analysis, complete response from lung metastasis at 
6 months after stereotactic body radiation therapy was significantly associated 
with both the maximum and mean values of pre-SABR 18FDG-PET/CT SUV. Longer-term 
trials are strongly advocated to improve the personalization of the monitoring 
of tumor response in patients with lung oligometastases and, consequently, 
monitoring of the cost-effectiveness of the health care.

Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
ataxia, telangiectasia, and immunodeficiency. An increased risk of malignancies 
and respiratory diseases dramatically reduce life expectancy. To better counsel 
families, develop individual follow-up programs, and select patients for 
therapeutic trials, more knowledge is needed on factors influencing survival. 
This retrospective cohort study of 61 AT patients shows that classical AT 
patients had a shorter survival than variant patients (HR 5.9, 95%CI 2.0-17.7), 
especially once a malignancy was diagnosed (HR 2.5, 95%CI 1.1-5.5, compared to 
classical AT patients without malignancy). Patients with the hyper IgM phenotype 
with hypogammaglobulinemia (AT-HIGM) and patients with an IgG2 deficiency showed 
decreased survival compared to patients with normal IgG (HR 9.2, 95%CI 3.2-26.5) 
and patients with normal IgG2 levels (HR 7.8, 95%CI 1.7-36.2), respectively. If 
high risk treatment trials will become available for AT, those patients with 
factors indicating the poorest prognosis might be considered for inclusion 
first.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (hoFH) is a rare 
genetic disorder with potential severe atherosclerosis in the pediatric age.
METHODS: We report on 9 patients with hoFH, who had been diagnosed within the 
last 30 years and who were consequently treated with apheresis and drugs.
RESULTS: Two deaths occurred: one at age 36 years and the other at age four and 
a half years before effective treatment was commenced. All other patients are 
still in good clinical condition today, although four of them have proven aortic 
stenosis or arterial plaques.
CONCLUSIONS: Our case report highlights that adequate treatment should start as 
early as possible to delay the onset of clinical manifestations of 
atherosclerosis. It can be assumed that the introduction of new drugs can 
improve the outcome and possibly lengthen the life expectancy of patients 
affected by hoFH.

Spinal deformities can affect quality of life (QOL) and risk of falling, but no 
studies have explored the relationships of spinal mobility and sagittal 
alignment of spine and the lower extremities simultaneously. Purpose of this 
study is to clarify the relationship of those postural parameters to QOL and 
risk of falling. The study evaluated 110 subjects (41 men, 69 women; mean age, 
73 years). Upright and flexion and extension angles for thoracic kyphosis, 
lumbar lordosis, and spinal inclination were evaluated with SpinalMouse®. 
Total-body inclination and hip and knee flexion angles in upright position were 
measured from lateral photographs. Subjects were divided into Fallers (n=23, 
21%) and Non-fallers (n=87, 79%) based on past history of falls. QOL was 
assessed using the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36®). Age, total-body 
inclination, spinal inclination upright and in extension, thoracic kyphosis in 
flexion, lumbar lordosis upright and in extension, and knee flexion correlated 
significantly with the SF-36. Multiple regression analysis revealed total-body 
inclination and knee flexion to have the most significant relationships with the 
SF-36. SF-36, total-body inclination, spinal inclination in extension, thoracic 
kyphosis in flexion, lumbar lordosis upright and in extension, and hip and knee 
flexion angles differed significantly between Fallers and Non-fallers (P<0.05 
for all). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed lumbar lordosis in 
extension to be a significant predictor of falling (P=0.038). Forward-stooped 
posture and knee-flexion deformity could be important indicator of lower QOL. 
Moreover, limited extension in the lumbar spine could be a useful screening 
examination for fall prevention in the elderly.
