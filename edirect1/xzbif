This paper contextualizes the chronic kidney disease epidemic and related burden 
of disease affecting Central American farming communities. It summarizes the two 
main causal hypotheses (heat stress and agrochemicals), draws attention to the 
consequences of dichotomous reasoning concerning causality, and warns of 
potential conflicts of interest and their role in "manufacturing doubt." It 
describes some methodological errors that compromise past study findings and 
cautions against delaying public health actions until a conclusive understanding 
is reached about the epidemic's causes and underlying mechanisms. It makes the 
case for a comprehensive approach to the historical, social and epidemiological 
facts of the epidemic, for critically assessing existing studies and for 
enhanced rigor in new research.

BACKGROUND: Mortality in acromegaly strictly depends on optimal control of GH 
and IGF1 levels. Modern medical therapy with somatostatin analogs (SSAs) and GH 
receptor antagonists (GHRAs) is not available in many countries due to funding 
restrictions. This retrospective, comparative, cohort study investigated the 
impact of different treatment modalities on disease control (GH and IGF1) and 
mortality in acromegaly patients.
METHODS: Two cohorts of patients with acromegaly from Bulgaria (n=407) and 
Campania, Italy (n=220), were compared, and mortality rates were evaluated 
during a 10-year period (1999-2008).
RESULTS: The major difference in treatment approach between cohorts was the 
higher utilization of SSAs and GHRAs in Italy, leading to a decreased 
requirement for radiotherapy. Significantly more Italian than Bulgarian patients 
had achieved disease control (50.1 vs 39.1%, P=0.005) at the last follow-up. 
Compared with the general population, the Bulgarian cohort had a decreased life 
expectancy with a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 2.0 (95% CI 1.54-2.47) 
that was restored to normal in patients with disease control - SMR 1.25 (95% CI 
0.68-1.81). Irradiated patients had a higher cerebrovascular mortality - SMR 
7.15 (95% CI 2.92-11.37). Internal analysis revealed an independent role of age 
at diagnosis and last GH value on all-cause mortality and radiotherapy on 
cerebrovascular mortality. Normal survival rates were observed in the Italian 
cohort: SMR 0.66 (95% CI 0.27-1.36).
CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal biochemical control was associated with a higher 
mortality in the Bulgarian cohort. Modern treatment options that induce a strict 
biochemical control and reduce the necessity of radiotherapy might influence the 
life expectancy. Other factors, possibly management of comorbidities, could 
contribute to survival rates.

Public policy requires public support, which in turn implies a need to enable 
the public not just to understand policy but also to be engaged in its 
development. Where complex science and technology issues are involved in policy 
making, this takes time, so it is important to identify emerging issues of this 
type and prepare engagement plans. In our horizon scanning exercise, we used a 
modified Delphi technique. A wide group of people with interests in the science 
and policy interface (drawn from policy makers, policy adviser, practitioners, 
the private sector and academics) elicited a long list of emergent policy issues 
in which science and technology would feature strongly and which would also 
necessitate public engagement as policies are developed. This was then refined 
to a short list of top priorities for policy makers. Thirty issues were 
identified within broad areas of business and technology; energy and 
environment; government, politics and education; health, healthcare, population 
and aging; information, communication, infrastructure and transport; and public 
safety and national security.

Cell polarization is a theme in biology conserved from bacteria to man. One of 
the most extremely polarized cells in nature is the hyphae of filamentous fungi. 
A continuous flow of secretion vesicles from the hyphal cell body to the tip is 
essential for cell wall and membrane extension. Microtubules (MTs) and actin, 
along with their corresponding motor proteins, are involved in the secretion 
process. Therefore, the arrangement of the cytoskeleton is a crucial step to 
establish and maintain polarity. Here we review recent findings unraveling the 
mechanism of polarized growth with special emphasis on the role of the actin and 
MT cytoskeletons and cell end markers linking the two cytoskeletons. We will 
mainly focus on Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus nidulans as model organisms.

It is acknowledged that the world is ageing at both the individual and 
population level. Life expectancies at birth have increased for males and 
females in the more developed economies across the 20th century. The 21st 
century is expected to see this development continue with life expectancies 
moving towards 100 years. This paper looks at the evidence for future increases 
in life expectancy and for the longest-lived to live even longer.

Life expectancy following orbital exenteration.

Orbital exenteration is a physically debilitating procedure that may be a 
necessity in the management of orbital malignancy. It requires a sensitive 
multidisciplinary approach, both preoperatively and postoperatively. Providing 
life expectancy information for patients during preoperative counselling is 
pertinent to informed consent and in addressing patients' expectations. A 
retrospective review from one tertiary care centre was undertaken for a cohort 
of patients who were exenterated for orbital malignancy between 1998 and 2010. 
The cases were identified using an International Classification of Diseases 10th 
Revision (ICD-10)-derived database and were analysed using Prism statistical 
software (V.5.04). Cause of death was ascertained by liaising with the general 
practitioner and the National Registrar Office for Births, Deaths, and 
Marriages, Southport, UK. In total, 41 men and 32 women were identified. Mean 
age was 72 years with 47 cases living and 26 deceased at the time of review. The 
overall 5-year survival rate in this study was 64%. Kaplan-Meier analysis for 
basal cell carcinoma (BCC) against non-BCC returned a p value of 0.0199, with an 
HR of 0.3927 (CI 0.1788 to 0.8626). Kaplan-Meier analysis for cleared against 
non-cleared margins returned a p value of 0.2890, with an HR of 0.6571(CI 0.3024 
to 1.428). Our results represent the highest 5-year survival data to date. 
However, the overall prognosis for patients who undergo orbital exenteration for 
malignancy remains poor. We hypothesise that the causes are multi-factorial. We 
recommend a multidisciplinary approach to the care of these patients, involving 
head and neck teams, oncology and other appropriate specialties, to optimise 
outcomes for this vulnerable patient group.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of neck dissection and radiation 
treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC) with subsequent shoulder range of 
motion (ROM) and quality of life (QOL) in 5-year survivors.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional convenience sample.
SETTING: Otolaryngology clinics at tertiary care hospital and Veterans Affairs 
medical center.
PATIENTS: Five-year, disease-free survivors of HNC.
METHODS: Demographic and cancer treatment information was collected, including 
type of neck dissection (none, spinal accessory "nerve sparing," and "nerve 
sacrificing") and radiation. QOL questionnaires were administered, and shoulder 
ROM was measured.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: University of Washington Quality of Life (UWQOL), 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Head and Neck, and Performance 
Status Scale for Head and Neck. Shoulder ROM measurements included abduction, 
adduction, flexion, extension, internal and external rotation.
RESULTS: One hundred and five survivors completed QOL surveys; 85 survivors 
underwent additional shoulder ROM evaluations. The nerve sacrifice group 
exhibited significantly poorer scores for UWQOL measures of disfigurement, level 
of activity, recreation and/or entertainment, speech and shoulder disability, 
and willingness to eat in public, FACT functional well-being, and FACT Head and 
Neck (P < .05). Shoulder ROM for flexion and abduction was poorest in the nerve 
sacrifice group (P < .05). Radiation was associated with significantly worse 
UWQOL swallowing (P < .05), but no other differences were found for QOL or ROM 
measurements. Decreased QOL scores were associated with decreased shoulder 
flexion and abduction (P < .05). Survivors with decreased shoulder abduction had 
significantly (P < .05) worse scores in disfigurement, recreation and/or 
entertainment, employment, shoulder disability, and FACT emotional well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: Sparing the spinal accessory nerve during neck dissection is 
associated with significantly less long-term shoulder disability in 5-year 
survivors of HNC. QOL measures demonstrated the highest level of function in the 
no dissection group, an intermediate level of functioning with nerve sparing, 
and poorest function when the nerve is sacrificed. Decreased shoulder flexion 
and abduction is associated with reduced QOL in long-term survivors of HNC.

Using surveys to calculate disability-adjusted life-years.

Wiedermann W, Frick U.

Mapping a certain disease into a system of disabling attributes allows 
researchers to compare diseases within a common framework. To quantify the total 
burden of morbidity (e.g., morbidity attributable to alcohol use), so-called 
disability weights (DWs) must be generated. General-population surveys can be 
used to derive DWs from health valuation tasks. This article describes the 
application of three psychometric methods (i.e., pairwise comparisons, ranking 
tasks, and visual analog scales) in general-population surveys and outlines 
their strengths and weaknesses. A recently proposed health valuation framework 
also is presented, which highlights the underlying cognitive processes from a 
social-judgment perspective and presents a structured data-collection procedure 
that seems promising in deriving DWs from general-population surveys.

BACKGROUND: In previous work, RAF theory has been developed as a tool for making 
theoretical progress on the origin of life question, providing insight into the 
structure and occurrence of self-sustaining and collectively autocatalytic sets 
within catalytic polymer networks. We present here an extension in which there 
are two "independent" polymer sets, where catalysis occurs within and between 
the sets, but there are no reactions combining polymers from both sets. Such an 
extension reflects the interaction between nucleic acids and peptides observed 
in modern cells and proposed forms of early life.
RESULTS: We present theoretical work and simulations which suggest that the 
occurrence of autocatalytic sets is robust to the partitioned structure of the 
network. We also show that autocatalytic sets remain likely even when the 
molecules in the system are not polymers, and a low level of inhibition is 
present. Finally, we present a kinetic extension which assigns a rate to each 
reaction in the system, and show that identifying autocatalytic sets within such 
a system is an NP-complete problem.
CONCLUSIONS: Recent experimental work has challenged the necessity of an RNA 
world by suggesting that peptide-nucleic acid interactions occurred early in 
chemical evolution. The present work indicates that such a peptide-RNA world 
could support the spontaneous development of autocatalytic sets and is thus a 
feasible alternative worthy of investigation.

BACKGROUND: Infantile Pompe disease is a rare metabolic disease. Patients 
generally do not survive the first year of life. Enzyme replacement therapy 
(ERT) has proven to have substantial effects on survival in infantile Pompe 
disease. However, the costs of therapy are very high. In this paper, we assess 
the cost-effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy in infantile Pompe disease.
METHODS: A patient simulation model was used to compare costs and effects of ERT 
with costs of effects of supportive therapy (ST). The model was filled with data 
on survival, quality of life and costs. For both arms of the model, data on 
survival were obtained from international literature. In addition, survival as 
observed among 20 classic-infantile Dutch patients, who all received ERT, was 
used. Quality of life was measured using the EQ-5D and assumed to be the same in 
both treatment groups. Costs included the costs of ERT (which depend on a 
child's weight), infusions, costs of other health care utilization, and informal 
care. A lifetime time horizon was used, with 6-month time cycles.
RESULTS: Life expectancy was significantly longer in the ERT group than in the 
ST group. On average, ST receiving patients were modelled not to survive the 
first half year of life; whereas the life expectancy in the ERT patients was 
modelled to be almost 14 years. Lifetime incremental QALYs were 6.8. Incremental 
costs were estimated to be € 7.0 million, which primarily consisted of treatment 
costs (95%). The incremental costs per QALY were estimated to be € 1.0 million 
(range sensitivity analyses: € 0.3 million - € 1.3 million). The incremental 
cost per life year gained was estimated to be € 0.5 million.
CONCLUSIONS: The incremental costs per QALY ratio is far above the conventional 
threshold values. Results from univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
showed the robustness of the results.

BACKGROUND: Intervention and treatment in Alzheimer's disease dementia 
(AD-dementia) can be cost effective but the majority of patients are not 
diagnosed in a timely manner. Technology is now available that can enable the 
earlier detection of cognitive loss associated with incipient dementia, offering 
the potential for earlier intervention in the UK health care system. This study 
aimed to determine to what extent the timing of an intervention affects its 
cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: Using published data describing cognitive decline in the years prior to 
an AD diagnosis, we modelled the effects on healthcare costs and 
quality-adjusted life years of hypothetical symptomatic and disease-modifying 
interventions. Early and standard interventions were assumed to have equal 
clinical effects, but the early intervention could be applied up to eight years 
prior to standard diagnosis.
RESULTS: A symptomatic treatment which immediately improved cognition by one 
MMSE point and reduced in efficacy over three years, would produce a maximum net 
benefit when applied at the earliest timepoint considered, i.e. eight years 
prior to standard diagnosis. In this scenario, the net benefit was reduced by 
around 17% for every year that intervention was delayed. In contrast, for a 
disease-modifying intervention which halted cognitive decline for one year, 
economic benefits would peak when treatment effects were applied two years prior 
to standard diagnosis. In these models, the maximum net benefit of the disease 
modifying intervention was fifteen times larger than that of the symptomatic 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: Timeliness of intervention is likely to have an important impact on 
the cost-effectiveness of both current and future treatments. Healthcare policy 
should aim to optimise the timing of AD-dementia diagnosis, which is likely to 
necessitate detecting and treating patients several years prior to current 
clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Hip fractures frequently occur in older persons and severely 
decrease life expectancy and independence. Several care pathways have been 
developed to lower the risk of negative outcomes but most pathways are limited 
to only one aspect of care. The aim of this study was therefore to develop a 
comprehensive care pathway for older persons with a hip fracture and to conduct 
a preliminary analysis of its effect.
METHODS: A comprehensive multidisciplinary care pathway for patients aged 60 
years or older with a hip fracture was developed by a multidisciplinary team. 
The new care pathway was evaluated in a clinical trial with historical controls. 
The data of the intervention group were collected prospectively. The 
intervention group included all patients with a hip fracture who were admitted 
to University Medical Center Groningen between 1 July 2009 and 1 July 2011. The 
data of the control group were collected retrospectively. The control group 
comprised all patients with a hip fracture who were admitted between 1 January 
2006 and 1 January 2008. The groups were compared with the independent sample 
t-test, the Mann-Whitney U-test or the Chi-squared test (Phi test). The effect 
of the intervention on fasting time and length of stay was adjusted by linear 
regression analysis for differences between the intervention and control group.
RESULTS: The intervention group included 256 persons (women, 68%; mean age (SD), 
78 (9) years) and the control group 145 persons (women, 72%; mean age (SD), 80 
(10) years). Median preoperative fasting time and median length of hospital stay 
were significantly lower in the intervention group: 9 vs. 17 hours (p < 0.001), 
and 7 vs. 11 days (p < 0.001), respectively. A similar result was found after 
adjustment for age, gender, living condition and American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification. In-hospital mortality was also lower in 
the intervention group: 2% vs. 6% (p < 0.05). There were no statistically 
significant differences in other outcome measures.
CONCLUSIONS: The new comprehensive care pathway was associated with a 
significant decrease in preoperative fasting time and length of hospital stay.

BACKGROUND: Providing additional Saturday rehabilitation can improve functional 
independence and health related quality of life at discharge and it may reduce 
patient length of stay, yet the economic implications are not known. The aim of 
this study was to determine from a health service perspective if the provision 
of rehabilitation to inpatients on a Saturday in addition to Monday to Friday 
was cost effective compared to Monday to Friday rehabilitation alone.
METHODS: Cost utility and cost effectiveness analyses were undertaken alongside 
a multi-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial with a 30-day follow up 
after discharge. Participants were adults admitted for inpatient rehabilitation 
in two publicly funded metropolitan rehabilitation facilities. The control group 
received usual care rehabilitation services from Monday to Friday and the 
intervention group received usual care plus an additional rehabilitation service 
on Saturday. Incremental cost utility ratio was reported as cost per quality 
adjusted life year (QALY) gained and an incremental cost effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) was reported as cost for a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) 
in functional independence.
RESULTS: 996 patients (mean age 74 (standard deviation 13) years) were randomly 
assigned to the intervention (n = 496) or the control group (n = 500). Mean 
difference in cost of AUD$1,673 (95% confidence interval (CI) -271 to 3,618) was 
a saving in favor of the intervention group. The incremental cost utility ratio 
found a saving of AUD$41,825 (95% CI -2,817 to 74,620) per QALY gained for the 
intervention group. The ICER found a saving of AUD$16,003 (95% CI -3,074 to 
87,361) in achieving a MCID in functional independence for the intervention 
group. If the willingness to pay per QALY gained or for a MCID in functional 
independence was zero dollars the probability of the intervention being cost 
effective was 96% and 95%, respectively. A sensitivity analysis removing 
Saturday penalty rates did not significantly alter the outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: From a health service perspective, the provision of rehabilitation 
to inpatients on a Saturday in addition to Monday to Friday, compared to Monday 
to Friday rehabilitation alone, is likely to be cost saving per QALY gained and 
for a MCID in functional independence.

Box-1560, Ethiopia. antepharma@yahoo.com.

BACKGROUND: Cheating on examinations in academic institutions is a worldwide 
issue. When cheating occurs in medical schools, it has serious consequences for 
human life, social values, and the economy. This study was conducted to 
determine the prevalence of cheating and identify factors that influence 
cheating among students of Hawassa University College of medicine and health 
science.
METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted from May through June 2013. A 
pre-tested self-administered, structured questionnaire was used to collect 
self-reported data regarding cheating. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS 
version 20. Descriptive statistics were used for data summarization and 
presentation. Degree of association was measured by Chi Square test, with 
significance level set at p = 0.05. Bivariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses were used to assess associations.
RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported cheating was found to be 19.8% (95% 
CI = 17.4-21.9). About 12.1% (95% CI = 10.2-13.9) of students disclosed cheating 
on the entrance examination. The majority of students (80.1% (95% 
CI = 77.9-82.3) disclosed that they would not report cheating to invigilators 
even if they had witnessed cheating. Analysis by multiple regression models 
showed that students who cheated in high school were more likely to cheat 
(adjusted OR = 1. 80, 95% CI = 1. 01-3.19) and that cheating was less likely 
among students who didn't cheat on entrance examinations (adjusted OR = 0. 25, 
95% CI = 0. 14-0.45). Dining outside the university cafeteria and receiving 
pocket money of Birr 300 or more were strongly associated with cheating 
(adjusted OR = 3.08, 95% CI = 1.54-6.16 and adjusted OR = 1.69 (95% 
CI = 1.05-2.72), respectively. The odds of cheating among students were 
significantly higher for those who went to private high school, were substance 
users, and didn't attend lectures than for those who attended government 
schools, were not substance abusers, and attended lectures.
CONCLUSION: Our findings have important implications for development of an 
institution's policies on academic integrity. By extension, they affect the 
policies of high schools. Increased levels of supervision during entrance 
examination, mandated attendance at lectures, and reduction of substance use are 
likely to reduce cheating. No significant association was found with background, 
level of parental education, grade point average, and interest in field of 
study.

depressed informal carers of stroke survivors (CEDArS): study protocol for a 
feasibility randomized controlled trial.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy has resulted in a greater provision of 
informal care within the community for patients with chronic physical health 
conditions. Informal carers are at greater risk of poor mental health, with one 
in three informal carers of stroke survivors experiencing depression. However, 
currently no psychological treatments tailored to the unique needs of depressed 
informal carers of stroke survivors exist. Furthermore, informal carers of 
stroke survivors experience a number of barriers to attending traditional 
face-to-face psychological services, such as lack of time and the demands of the 
caring role. The increased flexibility associated with supported cognitive 
behavioral therapy self-help (CBTsh), such as the ability for support to be 
provided by telephone, email, or face-to-face, alongside shorter support 
sessions, may help overcome such barriers to access. CBTsh, tailored to 
depressed informal carers of stroke survivors may represent an effective and 
acceptable solution.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a Phase II (feasibility) randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) following guidance in the MRC Complex Interventions Research Methods 
Framework. We will randomize a sample of depressed informal carers of stroke 
survivors to receive CBT self-help supported by mental health paraprofessionals, 
or treatment-as-usual. Consistent with the objectives of assessing the 
feasibility of trial design and procedures for a potential larger scale trial we 
will measure the following outcomes: a) feasibility of patient recruitment 
(recruitment and refusal rates); (b) feasibility and acceptability of data 
collection procedures; (c) levels of attrition; (d) likely intervention effect 
size; (e) variability in number, length and frequency of support sessions 
estimated to bring about recovery; and (f) acceptability of the intervention. 
Additionally, we will collect data on the diagnosis of depression, symptoms of 
depression and anxiety, functional impairment, carer burden, quality of life, 
and stroke survivor mobility skill, self-care and functional ability, measured 
at four and six months post-randomization.
DISCUSSION: This study will provide important information for the feasibility 
and design of a Phase III (effectiveness) trial in the future. If the 
intervention is identified to be feasible, effective, and acceptable, a written 
CBTsh intervention for informal carers of stroke survivors, supported by mental 
health paraprofessionals, could represent a cost-effective model of care.

BACKGROUND: Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of 
multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness at 1-year 
follow-up of a manualised group-based programme ('FACETS') for managing 
MS-fatigue.
METHODS: One-year follow-up of a pragmatic multi-centre randomised controlled 
trial. People with MS and significant fatigue were randomised to FACETS plus 
current local practice (FACETS) or current local practice alone (CLP), using 
concealed computer-generated randomisation. Participant blinding was not 
possible. Primary outcome measures were fatigue severity (Global Fatigue 
Severity subscale of the Fatigue Assessment Instrument), self-efficacy 
(MS-Fatigue Self-Efficacy) and disease-specific quality of life (MS Impact 
Scale).
RESULTS: Between May 2008 and November 2009, 164 participants were randomised. 
Primary outcome data were available at 1 year for 131 (80%). The benefits 
demonstrated at 4-months in the FACETS arm for fatigue severity and 
self-efficacy largely persisted, with a slight reduction in standardised effect 
sizes (SES) (-0.29, p = 0.06 and 0.34, p = 0.09, respectively). There was a 
significant difference on the MS Impact Scale favouring FACETS that had not been 
present at 4-months (SES -0.24, p = 0.046). No adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in fatigue severity and self-efficacy at 4-months 
follow-up following attendance of FACETS were mostly sustained at 1 year with 
additional improvements in MS impact. The FACETS programme provides modest 
long-term benefits to people with MS-fatigue.

BACKGROUND: Severe borderline personality disorder is associated with a very 
high psychosocial and economic burden. Current treatment guidelines suggest that 
several manualized treatments, including day hospital Mentalization-Based 
Treatment (MBT-DH), are effective in these patients. However, only two 
randomized controlled trials have compared manualized MBT-DH with treatment as 
usual. Given the relative paucity of data supporting the efficacy and 
cost-effectiveness of MBT-DH, the possible influence of researcher allegiance in 
one of the trials, and potential problems with the generalization of findings to 
mental health systems in other countries, this multi-site randomized trial aims 
to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of manualized MBT-DH compared 
to manualized specialist treatment as usual in The Netherlands.
METHODS/DESIGN: The trial is being conducted at two sites in The Netherlands. 
Patients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and a 
score of ≥ 20 on the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index were 
randomly allocated to MBT-DH or treatment as usual. The MBT-DH program consists 
of a maximum of 18 months' intensive treatment, followed by a maximum of 
18 months of maintenance therapy. Specialist treatment as usual is provided by 
the City Crisis Service in Amsterdam, a service that specializes in treating 
patients with personality disorders, offering manualized, non-MBT interventions 
including family interventions, Linehan training, social skills training, and 
pharmacotherapy, without a maximum time limit. Patients are assessed at baseline 
and subsequently every 6 months up to 36 months after the start of treatment. 
The primary outcome measure is the frequency and severity of manifestations of 
borderline personality disorder as assessed by the Borderline Personality 
Disorder Severity Index. Secondary outcome measures include parasuicidal 
behaviour, symptomatic distress, social and interpersonal functioning, 
personality functioning, attachment, capacity for mentalizing and quality of 
life. Cost-effectiveness is assessed in terms of the cost per quality-adjusted 
life year. Outcomes will be analyzed using multilevel analyses based on 
intention-to-treat principles.
DISCUSSION: Severe borderline personality disorder is a serious psychological 
disorder that is associated with high burden. This multi-site randomized trial 
will provide further data concerning the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of 
MBT-DH for these patients.

Kong, SAR, China. smilelby@hku.hk.

BACKGROUND: The relative performance of ART sealant and fluoride-releasing resin 
sealant in preventing fissure caries in permanent molars was compared in a 
randomized clinical trial conducted in southern China (ClinicalTrials.gov 
NCT01829334).
METHODS: After obtaining ethical approval, healthy schoolchildren who had 
permanent first molars with occlusal fissures which were sound but deep or 
presented with only incipient caries were recruited for the study. Included 
molars were randomly allocated into one of four parallel study groups in units 
of left/right teeth per mouth. Two of the four groups adopted the methods of ART 
or fluoride-releasing resin sealant placement while the other two groups adopted 
the topical fluoride application methods. Fissure status of the molars in each 
group was evaluated every 6 months. Development of dentine caries and sealant 
retention over 24 months in the molars in the two sealant-using groups was 
compared in this report. Outcome on cost-effectiveness of all four groups over 
36 months will be reported elsewhere.
RESULTS: At baseline, a total of 280 children (383 molars) with mean age 7.8 
years were involved for the two sealant groups. After 24 months, 261 children 
(357 molars) were followed. Proportions of molars with dentine caries were 7.3% 
and 3.9% in the ART sealant and fluoride-releasing resin sealant groups, 
respectively (chi-square test, p = 0.171). Life-table survival analysis showed 
that sealant retention (full and partial) rate over 24 months for the resin 
sealant (73%) was significantly higher than that (50%) for the ART sealant 
(p < 0.001). Molar survival (no development of dentine caries) rates in the ART 
sealant (93%) and fluoride-releasing resin sealant (96%) groups were not 
significantly different (p = 0.169). Multilevel logistic regression (GEE 
modeling) accounting for the effects of data clustering and confounding factors 
confirmed this finding.
CONCLUSIONS: Though the retention of fluoride-releasing resin sealant was better 
than that of the ART sealant, their effectiveness in preventing fissure caries 
in permanent molars did not differ significantly over 24 months. ART sealants 
could be a good alternative when and where resources for resin sealant placement 
are not readily available.

BACKGROUND: Hong Kong has one of the highest life expectancy rankings in the 
world. The number of centenarians and near-centenarians has been increasing 
locally and internationally. The relative growth of this population is a topic 
of immense importance for population and health policy makers. Living long and 
living well are two overlapping but distinct research topics. We previously 
conducted a quantitative study on 153 near-centenarians and centenarians to 
explore a wide range of biopsychosocial correlates of health and "living long". 
This paper reports a follow-up qualitative study examining the potential 
correlates of "living well" among near-centenarians and centenarians in Hong 
Kong.
METHODS: Six cognitively, physically, and psychologically sound 
community-dwelling elders were purposively recruited from a previous 
quantitative study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted.
RESULTS: Four major themes related to living long and well emerged from the 
responses of the participants: (a) Positive relations with others, (b) Positive 
events and happiness, (c) Hope for the future, and (d) Positive life attitude. 
Specifically, we found that having good interpersonal relationships, possessing 
a collection of positive life events, and maintaining salutary attitudes towards 
life are considered as important to psychological well-being by long-lived 
adults in Hong Kong. Most participants perceived their working life as most 
important to their life history and retired at very old ages.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings also shed light on the relationships between health, 
work, and old age.

The effect of continuous passive motion and sling exercise training on clinical 
and functional outcomes following total knee arthroplasty: a randomized 
active-controlled clinical study.

BACKGROUND: The parallel-group randomized active-controlled clinical study was 
conducted to compare the effectiveness of two in-hospital range of motion (ROM) 
exercise programs following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Continuous passive 
motion (CPM) is frequently used to increase ROM and improve postoperative 
recovery despite little conclusive scientific evidence. In contrast, a new 
active sling-based ROM therapy requires the activation of the knee joint muscles 
and dynamic joint stabilization. It was hypothesized that higher demands on 
muscle strength and muscle coordination during sling exercise training (ST) 
might be advantageous for early recovery following TKA.
METHODS: A total of 125 patients undergoing primary TKA were assessed for 
eligibility. Thirty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive ST or CPM 
(control intervention) during hospital stay. Patients were assessed before TKA 
for baseline measurement (pretest), 1 day before discharge (posttest) and 
3 months after TKA (follow-up). The passive knee flexion range of motion (pFL) 
was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included active knee 
flexion range of motion, active and passive knee extension ROM, static postural 
control, physical activity, pain, length of hospital stay as well as clinical, 
functional and quality-of-life outcomes (SF-36, HSS and WOMAC scores). Data were 
analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Differences between the 
groups were tested for significance by the unpaired Student's t test or an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for baseline, weight, sex, age, pain 
and physical activity.
RESULTS: A between-group difference could be determined at posttest. The pFL was 
significantly higher by 6.0° (95% CI 0.9 to 11.2°; P = 0.022) in the ST group. 
No difference between groups in pFL was documented at follow-up. Furthermore, no 
significant differences could be observed for any secondary outcome measure at 
posttest and follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: ST seems to have a clinically relevant beneficial short-term effect 
on pFL compared to CPM. The results support the implementation of ST in 
rehabilitation programs following TKA.

INTRODUCTION: Frailty is considered as an early stage of disability which, 
differently from disability, is still amenable for preventive interventions and 
is reversible. In 2011, the "Geriatric Frailty Clinic (G.F.C) for Assessment of 
Frailty and Prevention of Disability" was created in Toulouse, France, in 
association with the University Department of General Medicine and the 
Midi-Pyrénées Regional Health Authority. This structure aims to support the
