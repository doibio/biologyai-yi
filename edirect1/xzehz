OBJECTIVES: Improving the lifestyle of occupational workers is essential for 
extending healthy life expectancy. We investigated various lifestyle-related 
items in a rural Japanese population and compared them between agricultural and 
non-agricultural workers.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted as a part of the "Iwaki Health 
Promotion Project." Lifestyle-related items such as sleep, work hours, 
nutrition, health-related quality of life, and proportion of time spent 
performing each daily activity were compared between agricultural and 
non-agricultural workers in the ≥60 years (n = 251) and <60 years (n = 560) age 
groups.
RESULTS: Agricultural workers had significantly lower Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index total scores than non-agricultural workers in the <60 years group. The 
proportion of participants with more than 5 weekly working days was high among 
agricultural workers in both groups. Additionally, the proportion of people who 
worked more than 8 h per day was high among agricultural workers in both age 
groups. Energy intake per day was high among agricultural workers in the <60 
years group. In both age groups, agricultural workers slept and woke up 
approximately 40 min earlier than did non-agricultural workers.
CONCLUSIONS: Agricultural workers have better sleep habits but work longer than 
non-agricultural workers, with some differences in energy intake and proportion 
of time spent on each daily activity. These differences should be considered 
when planning lifestyle intervention programs for agricultural workers.

A rapidly aging society and longer life expectancy are causing osteoporosis to 
become a global epidemic. Over the last five decades, a number of drugs aimed at 
reducing bone resorption or restoring bone mass have been developed, but their 
efficacy and safety are limited. Icaritin (ICT) is a natural compound extracted 
from anti-osteoporosis herb Epimedium spp. and has been shown to inhibit 
osteoclast differentiation. However, the molecular mechanism by which ICT weaken 
RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation has not been completely investigated. 
Here, we evaluated the anti-osteoclastogenic effect of ICT in vitro and the 
potential drug candidate for treating osteoporosis in vivo. In vitro study, ICT 
was found to inhibit osteoclast formation and bone resorption function via 
downregulating transcription factors activated T cell cytoplasm 1 (NFATc1) and 
c-fos, which further downregulate osteoclastogenesis-specific gene. In addition, 
the enhanced mitochondrial mass and function required for osteoclast 
differentiation was mitigated by ICT. The histomorphological results from an in 
vivo study showed that ICT attenuated the bone loss associated with ovariectomy 
(OVX). Based on these results, we propose ICT as a promising new drug strategy 
for osteoporosis that inhibits osteoclast differentiation.

Despite its significant decline in the general population, smoking remains 
endemic and highly prevalent among people with mental disorders. The impact of 
smoking-attributable morbidity on life expectancy is significant since, in 
comparison to the general population, people with severe mental disorders have a 
15-20-year reduction in life expectancy. A cross-sectional study was conducted 
among 1015 people with mental disorders through personal interviews. The 
questionnaire was designed to examine these patients' knowledge, perceptions, 
and attitudes towards smoking. Individuals were recruited from the mental health 
residential community services, the outpatient department, and the inpatient 
facilities of the Psychiatric Hospital of Attica. Statistical analysis was 
performed using SPSS 26.0. In the sample analyzed, the current-smoking 
prevalence stood at 68.4% (n=643), while 12.3% reported being former smokers. A 
staggering 86.3% smoked their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, 
indicating a high level of dependence. Most of the former smokers (83.6%) 
reported that their main reason for quitting smoking was to improve their 
health, and the overwhelming majority (97.4%) had done so using no smoking 
cessation aid. Although slightly over half of the participants (53.7%) believed 
that health professionals adequately inform smokers about the harmful health 
effects of tobacco products, the information provided by health professionals on 
smoking cessation programs and tobacco harm reduction alternatives was 
considered sufficient by a mere 11.2%. Multiple logistic regression analysis 
demonstrated that outpatients tended to have a greater likelihood of being 
current smokers as compared to inpatients (OR=1.45), while users of mental 
health residential community services showed a significantly lower likelihood of 
being current smokers in comparison to inpatients (OR=0.49). Additionally, it 
was found that women had a lower likelihood of being current smokers compared to 
men (OR=0.51), while divorced/ widowed participants had a greater likelihood of 
being current smokers compared to single ones (OR=1.93). Finally, multiple 
regression analysis indicated that participants with psychotic disorders 
displayed a 2.39 times greater likelihood of being current smokers compared to 
those with mood disorders (OR=2.39). Understanding the knowledge, beliefs, and 
attitudes of people with mental disorders towards tobacco is an essential first 
step to confronting this neglected epidemic.

OBJECTIVE: Cancer has been proposed as the primary cause of death in type 2 
diabetes (T2D). The life expectancy is reduced after a diabetic foot ulcer. We 
investigated whether Diabetic Foot Disease related to an increased risk of 
developing a new cancer.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis on a cohort 
of patients hospitalized for T2D between 2009 and 2017, stratified for the risk 
of diabetic foot ulcer (International Working Group on Diabetic Foot 
classification). We highlighted new cancers in their medical records until 
December 2020. The relationship between Diabetic Foot Disease and later cancers 
was analyzed by multivariable Cox regression and survival curves were compared.
RESULTS: Among 519 patients, 27% had a Diabetic Foot Disease, and 159 were 
classified as grades 1 or 2 (at risk). As compared to the 218 patients graded 0 
according to the IWGDF, they were more men, older, with a longer duration of 
diabetes, more vascular complications, a greater incidence of insulin use, and a 
higher skin autofluorescence. During the 54 months of follow-up, 63 (12.1%) new 
cancers were diagnosed. Baseline Diabetic Foot Disease was significantly 
associated with a higher risk of cancer (multivariable adjusted Hazard ratio: 
2.08, 95%CI: 1.02-4.25), whereas the relation was not significant for subjects 
at risk of DFU (HR: 1.65, 95%CI:0.81-3.35) CONCLUSION: The risk of cancer was 
increased twofold in T2D with Diabetic Foot Disease.

BACKGROUND: The greatest change in the treatment of people living with type 1 
diabetes in the last decade has been the explosion of technology assisting in 
all aspects of diabetes therapy, from glucose monitoring to insulin delivery and 
decision making. As such, the aim of our systematic review was to assess the 
utility of these technologies as well as identify any precision 
medicine-directed findings to personalize care.
METHODS: Screening of 835 peer-reviewed articles was followed by systematic 
review of 70 of them (focusing on randomized trials and extension studies with 
≥50 participants from the past 10 years).
RESULTS: We find that novel technologies, ranging from continuous glucose 
monitoring systems, insulin pumps and decision support tools to the most 
advanced hybrid closed loop systems, improve important measures like HbA1c, time 
in range, and glycemic variability, while reducing hypoglycemia risk. Several 
studies included person-reported outcomes, allowing assessment of the burden or 
benefit of the technology in the lives of those with type 1 diabetes, 
demonstrating positive results or, at a minimum, no increase in self-care burden 
compared with standard care. Important limitations of the trials to date are 
their small size, the scarcity of pre-planned or powered analyses in 
sub-populations such as children, racial/ethnic minorities, people with advanced 
complications, and variations in baseline glycemic levels. In addition, 
confounders including education with device initiation, concomitant behavioral 
modifications, and frequent contact with the healthcare team are rarely 
described in enough detail to assess their impact.
CONCLUSIONS: Our review highlights the potential of technology in the treatment 
of people living with type 1 diabetes and provides suggestions for optimization 
of outcomes and areas of further study for precision medicine-directed 
technology use in type 1 diabetes.

Plain Language Summary: In the last decade, there have been significant advances 
in how technology is used in the treatment of people living with type 1 
diabetes. These technologies primarily aim to help manage blood sugar levels. 
Here, we reviewed research published over the last decade to evaluate the impact 
of such technologies on type 1 diabetes treatment. We find that various types of 
novel technologies, such as devices to monitor blood sugar levels continuously 
or deliver insulin, improve important diabetes-related measures and can reduce 
the risk of having low blood sugar levels. Importantly, several studies showed a 
positive impact of technologies on quality of life in people living with 
diabetes. Our findings highlight the benefits of novel technologies in the 
treatment of type 1 diabetes and identify areas for further research to optimize 
and personalize diabetes care.

PURPOSE: To analyze the 3-month life expectancy rate in pancreatic cancer (PC) 
patients treated within prospective trials from the German AIO study group.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A pooled analysis was conducted for patients with advanced 
PC that were treated within five phase II/III studies conducted between 1997 and 
2017 (Gem/Cis, Ro96, RC57, ACCEPT, RASH). The primary goal for the current 
report was to identify the actual 3-month survival rate, a standard inclusion 
criterion in oncology trials.
RESULTS: Overall, 912 patients were included, 83% had metastatic and 17% locally 
advanced PC; the estimated median overall survival (OS) was 7.1 months. 
Twenty-one percent of the participants survived < 3 months, with a range from 
26% in RC57 to 15% in RASH. Significant predictors for not reaching 3-month OS 
were > 1 previous treatment line (p < 0.001) and performance status (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the definition of a life expectancy of > 3 months as a 
standard inclusion criterion in clinical trials for advanced PC, a significant 
proportion of study patients does not survive > 3 months.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological trends of lower respiratory infections (LRIs) 
attributable to secondhand smoke (SHS) among children under 5 years since 
smoking bans have been increasingly applied globally remain unclear. Here, we 
aimed to estimate the spatiotemporal trends of the global, regional, and 
national burden of LRIs attributable to SHS among children under 5 years old 
between 2010 and 2019.
METHODS: Data on the deaths, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) of the 
disease burden was retrieved from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 for 
204 countries and territories between 2010 and 2019. The rates per 100,000 
population, along with 95% uncertainty intervals, as well as 
population-attributable fraction (PAF) was presented for each estimate.
RESULTS: In 2019, an estimated 6.94% (3.80-10.12%) of under-5 LRIs deaths were 
attributable to SHS globally, with an under-5 mortality rate of 7.02 per 
100,000, a decrease of 5.77% since 2010. Similarly, 6.95% (3.81-10.13%) of LRIs 
DALYs were due to SHS among children under 5 years, with a rate in under-5s of 
619.36 DALYs per 100,000, and also a 5.77% decrease since 2010. Azerbaijan, 
Turkmenistan, and Papua New Guinea showed the highest under-5 mortality and 
DALYs burden rates of LRIs attributable to SHS in 2019. In contrast, the PAF was 
stagnant over the past ten years and there is even a year-on-year upward trend 
in South Asia. Nationally, in 2019, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Armenia, and 
Montenegro showed the highest PAFSHS of LRIs burden among children under 5 years 
of age. In addition, the burden was heavier in children under 1 year of age and 
was significantly negatively associated with sociodemographic index.
CONCLUSIONS: SHS remains a risk factor that cannot be ignored for LRIs burden 
worldwide. Hence, governments and health systems should continue to take steps 
to reduce SHS pollution among young children to mitigate this burden.

Impact of positive-to-total lymph node ratio on prognosis in stage 3 colorectal 
cancer. A multicenter study.

Yirgin H, Sibic O, Aziret M, Tatlidil Y, Devecioglu EG, Bozkurt MA, Ercan M.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer remains a health problem despite advances in 
diagnostic and treatment methods. This study aimed to determine the impact of 
positive-to-total lymph node ratio on survival in colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Patients with stage 3 colorectal cancer were included. Patients age; 
sex; operation type (emergency or elective); tumor size, grade, and location; 
TNM stage; vascular and perineural invasions; numbers of lymph nodes examined 
and negative lymph nodes, positive-to-total lymph node ratio, and administration 
of postoperative chemotherapy were examined.
RESULTS: Median follow-up period was 34.7 months. Most patients were in stage 3b 
(67.9%), and the median number of dissected lymph nodes was 15. The number of 
metastatic lymph nodes, positive lymph node ratio, and negativeto- positive 
lymph node ratio were 3, 16.7, 11, and 5, respectively. The overall survival 
rate was 48.6%. Mean life expectancy was 51.5 months. Multivariate Cox 
regression analysis revealed positive-to-total lymph node ratio >23.3%, age, and 
absence of postoperative chemotherapy as risk factors for overall survival 
(p<0.05). Positive-to-total lymph node ratio >23.3% was associated with poor 
overall survival and 3.726-fold poorer survival.
DISCUSSION: Positive-to-total lymph node ratio >23.3% is a risk factor affecting 
overall survival in stage 3 colorectal cancer. Increased positive-to-total lymph 
node ratio (>23.3%) is associated with poor overall survival.
KEY WORDS: Colorectal Cancer, Overall Survival, Positive Lymph Node Ratio, Stage 
3 Cancer.

Publisher: Il cancro del colon-retto rimane un problema di salute nonostante i 
progressi nei metodi diagnostici e terapeutici. Questo studio mirava a 
determinare l’impatto del rapporto linfonodi positivi sul totale sulla 
sopravvivenza nel cancro del colon-retto. Sono stati inclusi nello studio 
pazienti con cancro del colon-retto al III stadio, analizzando età dei pazienti, 
sesso, tempistica dell’intervento (di emergenza o di elezione), dimensioni, 
grado e posizione del tumore, stadio TNM, invasioni vascolari e perineurali. 
Infine sono stati esaminati il numero di linfonodi isolati, quelli negativi ed 
il rapporto tra linfonodi positivi e il totale, e la somministrazione o meno 
della chemioterapia postoperatoria. RISULTATI: Il periodo mediano di follow-up è 
stato di 34,7 mesi. La maggior parte dei pazienti era allo stadio 3b (67,9%) e 
il numero mediano di linfonodi sezionati era 15. Il numero di linfonodi 
metastatici, il rapporto linfonodale positivo e il rapporto linfonodale 
negativopositivo erano 3, 16,7, 11, e 5, rispettivamente. Il tasso di 
sopravvivenza globale è stato del 48,6%. L’aspettativa di vita media era di 51,5 
mesi. L’analisi di regressione multivariata di Cox ha rivelato un rapporto 
linfonodi positivi/totali >23,3%, l’età e l’assenza di chemioterapia 
postoperatoria come fattori di rischio per la sopravvivenza globale (p <0,05). 
Il rapporto linfonodi positivi/totali >23,3% è stato associato a una 
sopravvivenza globale scarsa e a una sopravvivenza inferiore di 3,726 volte. 
DISCUSSIONE: il rapporto linfonodi positivi/totali >23,3% è un fattore di 
rischio che influenza la sopravvivenza globale nel cancro del colon-retto in 
stadio 3. L’aumento del rapporto linfonodi positivi/totali (> 23,3%) è associato 
a una scarsa sopravvivenza globale.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer treatment is determined based on several factors, 
namely tumor grading, staging, co-morbidity, patient preferences, life 
expectancy at diagnosis. Today, taxanes are commonly prescribed to treat several 
types of cancer and have been shown to have antitumor effects in many cancers. 
This research has never been done in prostate cancer patients but similar 
studies have been done before in breast cancer patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research design was observational analytic where this 
type of research was a prospective cohort where data was collected to record 
prostate cancer patients who received docetaxel chemotherapy which were then 
examined for thyroid function in cancer patients at the Adam Malik Hospital, 
Medan, Indonesia.
RESULT: In this study, data were collected regarding the thyroid function of the 
study sample in the form of free thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone 
(TSH) levels before chemotherapy with the docetaxel regimen. The mean of fT4 in 
all research subjects was 1.05 with a standard deviation of 0.26. The mean TSH 
in all study subjects was 1.52 with a standard deviation of 1.21. Thyroid 
function was examined after 3 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy. The mean of fT4 
in all research subjects was 0.91 with a standard deviation of 0.23. The mean 
TSH in all study subjects was 1.69 with a standard deviation of 1.09.
CONCLUSION: There are traces of the use of docetaxel chemotherapy in prostate 
cancer patients on decreased thyroid function at the Adam Malik Hospital in the 
form of decreased fT4 levels and increased TSH.

INTRODUCTION: Better health improves human capital and is a driver to economic 
growth. The allocation of resources to national health systems should be 
prioritized as investment and not expense/cost.
AREAS COVERED: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of 
Underinvestment on Medicines and Health in the Southern and Central Eastern 
European Countries. Two main databases were used for the purpose of this paper. 
Time series macro data covering the period 1960-2021, and micro data from SHARE 
survey for 322,724 individuals aged 50 and over from the European Countries.
EXPERT OPINION: Evidence across the Southern and Central Eastern Èuropean Member 
States reveals the significant underinvestment in health and medicines and the 
need for policy intervention to improve access and health outcomes. Further 
reductions in healthcare budgets would increase unmet needs the prevalence of 
multimorbidity and the out-of-pocket burden on households leading to 
catastrophic payments for medicines and health-care services. Public health 
actions should be undertaken by the International Organizations and National 
Governments to bridge the gap in health investment, by improving access, 
tackling health inequalities, and reducing the burden of catastrophic payments.

Parasites with complex life cycles often manipulate the phenotype of their 
intermediate hosts to increase the probability of transmission to their 
definitive hosts. Infection with Anomotaenia brevis, a cestode that uses 
Temnothorax nylanderi ants as intermediate hosts, leads to a multiple-fold 
extension of host lifespan and to changes in behaviour, morphology and 
colouration. The mechanisms behind these changes are unknown, as is whether the 
increased longevity is achieved through parasite manipulation. Here, we 
demonstrate that the parasite releases proteins into its host with functions 
that might explain the observed changes. These parasitic proteins make up a 
substantial portion of the proteome of the hosts' haemolymph, and thioredoxin 
peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, two antioxidants, exhibited the highest 
abundances among them. The largest part of the secreted proteins could not be 
annotated, indicating they are either novel or severely altered during recent 
coevolution to function in host manipulation. We also detected shifts in the 
hosts' proteome with infection, in particular an overabundance of 
vitellogenin-like A in infected ants, a protein that regulates division of 
labour in Temnothorax ants, which could explain the observed behavioural 
changes. Our results thus suggest two different strategies that might be 
employed by this parasite to manipulate its host: secreting proteins with 
immediate influence on the host's phenotype and altering the host's 
translational activity. Our findings highlight the intricate molecular interplay 
required to influence the phenotype of a host and point to potential signalling 
pathways and genes involved in parasite-host communication.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common neurological disease among young people of 
working age, which tends to increase the number of cases registered in the world 
and in the Russian Federation. However, with improved diagnostics and the 
emergence of new drugs that change the course of MS (disease-modifying therapy), 
people's life expectancy increases and the percentage of patients in the older 
age group increases as well. In this article, we consider the possibility of 
developing MS among people over 50 years of age, features of the course, 
diagnosis and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing massive tumor resection and total femur 
replacement (TFR) face a substantial risk of hip dislocation and infection, 
often resulting in multiple implant revisions or hip disarticulation. These 
complications can impact their independence and prognosis. Additionally, their 
shorter life expectancy is influenced by challenges in achieving local radical 
resection and controlling metastases. Identifying suitable candidates for TFR is 
vital, necessitating investigations into dislocation, infection, implant failure 
rates, local recurrence, overall survival, and associated factors.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the postsurgical complication (hip dislocation 
and infection) rate and factors associated with postsurgical complications in 
patients who underwent TFR after tumor resection? (2) What is the local 
recurrence rate, implant failure rate, overall survival rate, and factors 
associated with local recurrence and implant failure?
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 42 patients (median [range] age 47 years 
[10 to 79 years]) who underwent TFR and tumor resection at the time of the same 
surgical procedure between 1990 and 2020 at 12 registered institutions that 
specialized in tumor treatment in Japan. A total of 55% (23) of the patients 
were men, and 79% (33) had bone sarcoma. The median (range) follow-up period was 
36.5 months (2 to 327 months). Of the 42 patients, 12% (5) were lost to 
follow-up before 2 years without meeting a study endpoint (postsurgical 
complications, revision, or amputation), and another 19% (8) died before 2 years 
with implants intact, leaving 69% (29) of the original group who had either 
follow-up of at least 2 years or met a study endpoint before the minimum 
surveillance duration. Another 10% (4) had a minimum of 2 years of follow-up but 
had not been seen in the past 5 years. Infection was defined as deep-seated 
infection involving soft tissues, bones, joints, and the area around the 
implant. We did not consider superficial infections. Implant failure was defined 
when a patient underwent reimplantation or amputation. The complication and 
implant failure rates were assessed by the cumulative incidence function method, 
considering competing events. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the 
overall survival rate.
RESULTS: The 1-month, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year dislocation rates were 5%, 
12%, 14%, and 14%, respectively. The 1-month, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year 
infection rates were 5%, 7%, 10%, and 15%, respectively. Multivariable analyses 
for hip dislocation and infection revealed that resection of the abductor 
muscles and large tumor size were positively associated with hip dislocation. 
The 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year local recurrence rates were 5%, 15%, and 15%, 
respectively. The 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year implant failure rates were 
5% (95% confidence interval 1% to 15%), 7% (95% CI 2% to 18%), 16% (95% CI 6% to 
29%), and 16% (95% CI 6% to 29%), respectively. Multivariable analyses of local 
recurrence and implant failure that led to reimplantation or amputation revealed 
that a positive surgical margin was positively associated with local recurrence. 
The 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year overall patient survival rates were 95% (95% CI 
87% to 102%), 77% (95% CI 64% to 91%), and 64% (95% CI 48% to 81%), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Hip dislocation, infection, and local recurrence were frequently 
observed in patients who received massive tumor resection and TFR in our study, 
eventually leading to reimplantation or amputation. Preserving the abductor 
muscles and resecting the tumor with a wide margin can prevent postoperative 
dislocation and local recurrence. Future research should focus on patient 
selection criteria, prevention of hip dislocation, and innovative treatments.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the spatiotemporal trends in pancreatic cancer (PC) 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and mortality attributable to high 
body-mass index (BMI) by age, gender, and countries from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 
results. We presented the annual number of PC DALYs and mortality, and 
corresponding age-standardized rates (ASDR and ASMR), which were further 
stratified by age, gender, and countries. The estimated annual percentage change 
(EAPC) was computed to assess the longitudinal trends in ASRs.
RESULTS: In 2019, 0.7 million DALYs and 31.9 thousand deaths worldwide were 
caused by PC attributable to high BMI, with the largest amount reported in 
high-income North America, Western Europe, and East Asia. The corresponding ASDR 
and ASMR were highest in females and in high SDI regions, while quite varied 
across countries. The global EAPC in ASDR and ASMR was 1.45 (95% uncertainty 
interval [UI]: 1.40, 1.50) and 1.44 (95% UI: 1.39, 1.49), respectively. Almost 
all involved countries demonstrated significant uptrends in ASRs from 1990 to 
2019.
CONCLUSIONS: More productive efforts to reduce the impact of modifiable risk 
factors, such as overweight, should be undertaken, and thus effectively curb the 
rise of PC burden.

BACKGROUND: Rapid population aging is expected to become one of the major 
demographic transitions in the twenty-first century due to the continued decline 
in fertility and rise in life expectancy. Such a rise in the aged population is 
associated with increasing non-communicable diseases. India has suffered from 
obesity epidemic, with morbid obesity affecting 5% of the population and 
continuing an upward trend in other developing countries. This study estimates 
the prevalence of excess weight among older adults in India, and examines the 
socio-demographic and behavioral factors and its health consequences.
METHODS: The study used data from the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) 
wave 1 (2017-18). A total sample of 25,952 older adults (≥ 60 years) was 
selected for the study. Descriptive statistics, bivariate Chi-Square test, and 
logistic regression models were applied to accomplish the study objectives. Body 
mass index (BMI) has been computed for the study according to the classification 
of the World Health Organization, and "excess weight" refers to a score of BMI ≥ 
25.0 kg/m2.
RESULTS: Overall, 23% of older adults (≥ 60 years) were estimated with excess 
weight in India, which was higher among women irrespective of socioeconomic and 
health conditions. The higher levels of excess weight (than the national average 
of ≥22.7%) were observed among older adults in states like Haryana, Tamil Nadu, 
Telangana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Manipur, Goa, Kerala, Karnataka, Himachal 
Pradesh, Punjab, Sikkim and some other states. After adjusting for selected 
covariates, the odds of excess weight were higher among females than males [OR: 
2.21, 95% CI: 1.89, 2.60]. Similarly, the likelihood of excess weight was 2.18 
times higher among older adults who were living in urban areas compared to their 
rural counterparts [OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.90, 2.49]. Higher level of education is 
significantly positively correlated with excess weight. Similarly, higher 
household wealth index was significantly positively correlated with excess 
weight [OR: 1.98, CI: 1.62, 2.41]. Having hypertension, diabetes and heart 
diseases were associated with excess weight among older adults. Regional 
variations were also observed in the prevalence of excess weight among older 
adults.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that introducing measures that help to reduce 
the risk of non-communicable diseases, and campaigns to encourage physical 
activity, and community awareness may help reduce the high burden of excess 
weight and obesity among older Indians. The findings are important for 
identifying the at-risk sub-populations and for the better functioning of any 
public health programme and suitable intervention techniques to lower the 
prevalence and risk factors for excess weight in later life.

Continuous lithium (Li) depletion shadows the increase in energy density and 
safety properties promised by zero-excess lithium metal batteries (ZELMBs). 
Guiding the Li deposits toward more homogeneous and denser lithium morphology 
results in improved electrochemical performance. Herein, a lithium nitrate 
(LiNO3 ) enriched separator that improves the morphology of the Li deposits and 
facilitates the formation of an inorganic-rich solid-electrolyte interphase 
(SEI) resulting in an extended cycle life in Li||Li-cells as well as an increase 
of the Coulombic efficiency in Cu||Li-cells is reported. Using a LiNi0.6 Co0.2 
Mn0.2 O2 positive electrode in NCM622||Cu-cells, a carbonate-based electrolyte, 
and a LiNO3 enriched separator, an extension of the cycle life by more than 50 
cycles with a moderate capacity fading compared to the unmodified separator is 
obtained. The relative constant level of LiNO3 in the electrolyte, maintained by 
the LiNO3 enriched separator throughout the cycling process stems at the origin 
of the improved performance. Ion chromatography measurements carried out at 
different cycles support the proposed mechanism of a slow and constant release 
of LiNO3 from the separator. The results indicate that the strategy of using a 
LiNO3 enriched separator instead of LiNO3 as a sacrificial electrolyte additive 
can improve the performance of ZELMBs further by maintaining a compact and thus 
stable SEI layer on Li deposits.

Cardiac tissue growth and remodelling (G & R) occur in response to the changing 
physiological demands of the heart after birth. The early shift to pulmonary 
circulation produces an immediate increase in ventricular workload, causing 
microstructural and biomechanical changes that serve to maintain overall 
physiological homoeostasis. Such cardiac G & R continues throughout life. 
Quantifying the tissue's mechanical and microstructural changes because of G & R 
is of increasing interest, dovetailing with the emerging fields of personalised 
and precision solutions. This study aimed to determine equibiaxial, and 
non-equibiaxial extension, stress-relaxation, and the underlying microstructure 
of the passive porcine ventricles tissue at four time points spanning from 
neonatal to adulthood. The three-dimensional microstructure was investigated via 
two-photon excited fluorescence and second-harmonic generation microscopy on 
optically cleared tissues, describing the 3D orientation, rotation and 
dispersion of the cardiomyocytes and collagen fibrils. The results revealed that 
during biomechanical testing, myocardial ventricular tissue possessed 
non-linear, anisotropic, and viscoelastic behaviour. An increase in stiffness 
and viscoelasticity was noted for the left and right ventricular free walls from 
neonatal to adulthood. Microstructural analyses revealed concomitant increases 
in cardiomyocyte rotation and dispersion. This study provides baseline data, 
describing the biomechanical and microstructural changes in the left and right 
ventricular myocardial tissue during G & R, which should prove valuable to 
researchers in developing age-specific, constitutive models for more accurate 
computational simulations. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: There is a dearth of 
experimental data describing the growth and remodelling of left and right 
ventricular tissue. The published literature is fragmented, with data reported 
via different experimental techniques using tissues harvested from a variety of 
animals, with different gender and ages. This prevents developing a continuum of 
data spanning birth to death, so limiting the potential that can be leveraged to 
aid computational modelling and simulations. In this study, equibiaxial, 
non-equibiaxial, and stress-relaxation data are presented, describing 
directional-dependent material responses. The biomechanical data is consolidated
