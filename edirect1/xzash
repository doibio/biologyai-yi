enhancements useful for the patient and for the medical staff are discussed in 
this study.
METHODS: Twenty patients (11F/9M) with a mean age of 40 years (range 8-61), who 
were considered unsuitable candidates for resective surgery, were implanted with 
a VNS Therapy Demipulse Model 103. Mean monthly seizure frequency reduction and 
side effects were evaluated 1 year after implantation.
RESULTS: Mean monthly seizure frequency decreased significantly from 54 
seizures/month (SEM 30; range 1-555) before treatment to 33 (SEM 24, range 
0-445) following 12 months of treatment (p<0.05). Seven patients (39%) were 
considered responders with a reduction in seizure frequency of more than 50%. 
One of those seven patients became seizure free. Side effects were 
stimulation-related tingling sensation in the throat and/or hoarseness, a 
painful sensation in the left neck or ear region and a lead breakage In 
addition; one case of SUDEP was reported.
CONCLUSION: Patients treated with VNS Therapy Demipulse generators proved to 
have a significant decrease in seizure frequency. In this patient group, VNS was 
well tolerated. The main technical advances are the decrease in size and 
improved options for battery life follow-up.

At present it is estimated that 25% of the population older than 85 years have 
significant cognitive impairment. The global prevalence of cognitive impairment 
and dementia including Alzheimer's disease is expected to rise significantly in 
proportion to increased life expectancy. Deterioration of memory function and 
ultimately establishment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) severely debilitates the 
affected individual, uncompromisingly decreasing the quality of life of both 
affected patients and their care givers. Moreover, the cost of providing 
adequate care to patients with AD is a significant burden to both family and the 
health care providers. Therefore, various attempts have been made to identify 
means of either delaying the onset of cognitive impairment or improving memory 
function in patients affected by AD. Among a number of participants, importance 
of dietary fatty acids in particular omega-3 based fatty acids have gained 
significant momentum. This article aims to review published evidences for the 
role of omega-3 in memory function.

BACKGROUND: Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a 
major medical challenge.
METHODS: Selective literature review, including the current German/Austrian, 
European, and American guidelines on the treatment of HIV infection in adults.
RESULTS: In Germany, 3000 persons become infected with HIV each year; in 2009, 
67,000 persons in Germany were living with HIV. When highly active 
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is initiated in time, patients can achieve a 
nearly normal life expectancy. Nonetheless, in Germany as elsewhere, 30% of 
patients receive the diagnosis of HIV infection only when they have reached the 
AIDS stage of the disease or are suffering from advanced immunodeficiency. HAART 
should be started, at the latest, when the CD4-positive helper cell count drops 
below 350/microL. Primary drug resistances, accompanying illnesses, and the 
patient's living circumstances must all be taken into account in the selection 
of antiretroviral drugs. The goal of treatment is lasting suppression of HIV-RNA 
to below 50 copies per milliliter of plasma.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV testing should be offered to all patients at high risk for HIV 
infection and all persons newly diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease. 
As persons with HIV grow older, their treatment is complicated by increasing 
comorbidity and requires increased vigilance for possible drug interactions.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate clinical effects of 
low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in patients with acute neck pain with 
radiculopathy.
DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
SETTING: The study was carried out between January 2005 and September 2007 at 
the Clinic for Rehabilitation at the Medical School, University of Belgrade, 
Serbia.
PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: Sixty subjects received a course of 15 treatments 
over 3 weeks with active or an inactivated laser as a placebo procedure. LLLT 
was applied to the skin projection at the anatomical site of the spinal segment 
involved with the following parameters: wavelength 905 nm, frequency 5,000 Hz, 
power density of 12 mW/cm(2), and dose of 2 J/cm(2), treatment time 120 seconds, 
at whole doses 12 J/cm(2).
OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was pain intensity as measured by 
a visual analog scale. Secondary outcome measures were neck movement, neck 
disability index, and quality of life. Measurements were taken before treatment 
and at the end of the 3-week treatment period.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences between groups were found for 
intensity of arm pain (P = 0.003, with high effect size d = 0.92) and for neck 
extension (P = 0.003 with high effect size d = 0.94).
CONCLUSION: LLLT gave more effective short-term relief of arm pain and increased 
range of neck extension in patients with acute neck pain with radiculopathy in 
comparison to the placebo procedure.

Extract: The trend in the life expectancy of humans during the past thousand 
years has been generally characterized by a slow, steady increase -- though this 
pattern is frequently punctuated by volatility in death rates caused by epidemic 
and pandemic infectious diseases, famines, and war. This volatility was 
dramatically curtailed in the mid-19th century as infectious agents swiftly 
succumbed to improved living conditions, advances in public health, and medical 
interventions. During the past 30 years in the United States, the rise in life 
expectancy at birth has decelerated relative to this historic pattern, and gains 
in life expectancy at older ages are now much smaller than they were in previous 
decades. How much higher can life expectancy rise? This is not just an academic 
question. The answer formulated today will have substantial influence on the 
rate at which taxes are levied and the potential solvency of age-entitlement 
programs. Some researchers predict that life expectancy will rise dramatically 
in this century, leading public policy makers to raise their estimates of how 
long Americans will live. It is predicted that historical trends in rising life 
expectancy will continue throughout this century, fueled primarily by 
anticipated but yet-to-exist advances in biomedical technology. Some have even 
predicted that aging itself will soon be mastered by science, enabling people to 
live well beyond 100 years.

Extract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that 
results initially in memory dysfunction, and is subsequently followed by a more 
general decline in intellectual function. In western societies, it accounts for 
the majority (60-70%) of all cases of dementia. Currently, Alzheimer's disease 
affects over 4 million adults in the United States. With the increase in life 
expectancy of the general population, more individuals are living longer, 
exposing them to the increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. If 
current population projections hold true, it is estimated that by 2050 the 
number of cases of Alzheimer's disease will have quadrupled, and that 
Alzheimer's disease will begin to rival heart disease, cancer, and stroke as a 
leading cause of death. This has caused many to observe that Alzheimer's disease 
represents a new epidemic in medicine. The implications for society, in terms of 
both human suffering and monetary cost, are far reaching and underscore the 
urgency in finding effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of the 
disease.

Increasing age and carrying an APOE ε4 allele are well established risk factors 
for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The earlier age of onset of AD observed in 
ε4-carriers may reflect an accelerated aging process. We recently reported that 
APOE genotype modulates brain function decades before the appearance of any 
cognitive or clinical symptoms. Here we test the hypothesis that APOE influences 
brain aging by comparing healthy ε4-carriers and non-carriers, using the same 
imaging protocol in distinct groups of younger and older healthy volunteers. A 
cross-sectional factorial design was used to examine the effects of age and APOE 
genotype, and their interaction, on fMRI activation during an encoding memory 
task. The younger (N=36; age range 20-35; 18 ε4-carriers) and older (35 
middle-age/elderly; age range 50-78 years; 15 ε4-carriers) healthy volunteers 
taking part in the study were cognitively normal. We found a significant 
interaction between age and ε4-status in the hippocampi, frontal pole, 
subcortical nuclei, middle temporal gyri and cerebellum, such that aging was 
associated with decreased activity in e4-carriers and increased activity in 
non-carriers. Reduced cerebral blood flow was found in the older ε4-carriers 
relative to older non-carriers despite preserved grey matter volume. 
Overactivity of brain function in young ε4-carriers is disproportionately 
reduced with advancing age even before the onset of measurable memory 
impairment. The APOE genotype determines age-related changes in brain function 
that may reflect the increased vulnerability of ε4-carriers to late-life 
pathology or cognitive decline.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common benign adenoma in men, 
affecting nearly all of them. BPH represents a clinically significant cause of 
bladder outflow obstruction in up to 40% of men. The growing frequency of 
diagnosis is due to increasing life expectancy and a trend toward seeking 
medical advice at earlier stages of the disease. The last decade has witnessed a 
significant shift in emphasis in the management of BPH, with medical therapies 
and, to a lesser extent, minimally invasive therapies becoming the predominant 
active therapy choices. The development of effective therapies such as 
alpha-adrenergic blockers and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and the possibility 
of their combined use represent the most significant advance in the treatment of 
BPH.

Cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid plus endocrine therapy in premenopausal 
women with hormone-responsive early breast cancer.

Delea TE(1), Taneja C, Sofrygin O, Kaura S, Gnant M.

(1)Policy Analysis Inc, Brookline, MA 02445, USA. tdelea@pai2.com

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding 
zoledronic acid 4 mg intravenously every 6 months to endocrine therapy in 
premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer from a US 
health care system perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to predict disease 
progression, mortality, and costs of breast cancer care for premenopausal women 
with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer receiving up to 3 years of 
(1) endocrine therapy (goserelin plus tamoxifen or anastrozole); or (2) 
endocrine therapy plus zoledronic acid. Model parameters were obtained from 
ABCSG-12 (Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group Trial-12) and the 
literature. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained 
with zoledronic acid was calculated under 2 scenarios: (1) benefits of 
zoledronic acid persist to maximum (7 years) follow-up in ABCSG-12 ("trial 
benefits") or (2) benefits persist until death ("lifetime benefits").
RESULTS: Adding zoledronic acid to endocrine therapy was projected to yield a 
gain of 0.41 life years (LYs) and 0.43 QALYs assuming trial benefits and 1.34 
LYs and 1.41 QALYs assuming lifetime benefits. Assuming trial benefits, the 
incremental cost per QALY gained with zoledronic acid was $9300. Assuming 
lifetime benefits, zoledronic acid was estimated to increase QALYs and reduce 
costs. Cost per QALY gained was <or= $56,000 in all deterministic sensitivity 
analyses and was <or= $50,000 in 94% and 97% of probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses for trial and lifetime benefits scenarios, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Adding zoledronic acid to endocrine therapy in premenopausal women 
with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer is cost-effective from a US 
health care system perspective.

Individual cancer risk as a function of current age and risk profile.

Behavioural changes are an important partner in the fight against cancer 
(primary prevention or the choice to participate in secondary prevention). To 
make such behavioural changes, people need to have a correct assessment of their 
own risk, which is often underestimated or overestimated. These risk estimates 
depend, among others, on the calculation method that is used. Currently, the 
method that is used most often is 'indirect cumulative risk' (ICR). We discuss 
several drawbacks of using ICR in individual counselling and therefore use an 
alternative method. In this alternative (life table method) we calculated 
10-year risks for a whole range of cancers as a function of the current age and 
risk profile, while taking into account other causes of death. These estimates 
can easily be used to give an individualized assessment of the risk of cancer. 
Regardless of the risk estimation method used, the risk needs to be broken down 
for 'risk factors'. If only the risk for an average person of the population is 
given, this means a small overestimation for the non-risk group, but a 
significant underestimation for the at-risk group. When we compare the life 
table risk as a function of risk factors to the more commonly used ICR, large 
differences are found, especially in prostate, breast and lung carcinomas. The 
life table method, although it has certain limitations, has advantages over the 
ICR method for individual counselling. To our knowledge this is the first 
overview in which 10-year risks as a function of the current risk profile are 
given for multiple cancers. The calculated risks are primarily intended to 
better inform people who are considering preventive measures. For example, for a 
40-year-old woman without familial risk who is considering the pros and cons of 
breast cancer mammographic screening, it is more interesting to know that she 
has a 0.7% chance of getting breast cancer in the next 5 years, rather than 
being told that 11% of women get breast cancer during their lives (ICR 0-74). 
Current smokers can now be given absolute risk reduction estimates of smoking 
cessation. To keep the life table risk estimates up to date, they must be 
repeated every couple of years, using up-to-date incidence and mortality data.

Increased range of motion and function in an individual with breast cancer and 
necrotizing fasciitis-manual therapy and pulsed short-wave diathermy treatment.

Johnson W(1), Draper DO.

Author information:

Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe soft tissue infection of the subcutaneous 
tissue and fascia affecting those predisposed to immune system compromise. It is 
a life threatening condition; mortality can be reduced by rapid diagnosis, 
adequate early surgical debridement and antibiotic ointment. In this case report 
we present the use of manual therapy (MT) techniques, joint and soft tissue 
mobilization, following a regimen of pulsed short wave diathermy (PSWD) in the 
treatment of a woman 3 years post necrotizing fasciitis developed during 
chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer. During her course of chemotherapy, she 
developed necrotizing fasciitis which was treated with extensive surgical 
debridement (8 linear feet of incisions) followed by debridement to both hips 
and the pelvis area. When we started working with her, we put her on a course of 
PSWD/MT. After six weeks of following this regimen, she gained 25 degrees of 
external rotation in both her left and right hips, 15 degrees of left hip 
flexion and 17 degrees of right hip flexion. The patient gained 10 degrees of 
right hip extension, yet there was no improvement in left hip extension. The 
treatments led to a dramatic reduction in pain and scarring from previous 
surgeries. The patient also returned to running.

BACKGROUND: The role of unicompartmental arthroplasty in managing osteoarthritis 
of the knee remains controversial. The Oxford medial unicompartmental 
arthroplasty employs a fully congruent mobile bearing intended to reduce wear 
and increase the lifespan of the implant. Long-term second decade results are 
required to establish if the design aim can be met.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We report the (1) 20-year survivorship for the Oxford mobile 
bearing medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty; (2) reasons for the 
revisions; and (3) time to revision.
METHODS: We reviewed a series of 543 patients who underwent 682 medial Oxford 
meniscal bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasties performed between 1983 and 
January 2005. The mean age at implantation was 69.7 years (range, 48-94 years). 
The median followup was 5.9 years (range, 0.5 to 22 years). One hundred and 
forty-one patients (172 knees) died. None were lost to followup. The primary 
outcome was 20-year survival, a key variable in assessing the longevity of 
arthroplasty.
RESULTS: The 16-year all cause revision cumulative survival rate was 91.0% (CI 
6.4, 71 at risk) and survival was maintained to 20 years (91.0%, CI 36.2, 14 at 
risk). There had been 29 revision procedures: 10 for lateral arthrosis, nine for 
component loosening, five for infection, two bearing dislocations, and three for 
unexplained pain. In addition, five patients had undergone bearing exchange, 
four for dislocation and one for bearing fracture. The mean time to revision was 
3.3 years (range, 0.3-8.9 years).
CONCLUSIONS: Mobile bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty is durable during 
the second decade after implantation.

Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of an oral formulation of the 
histone deacetylase inhibitor Belinostat (PXD101).

0YN, United Kingdom. nicola.steele@ggc.scot.nhs.uk

PURPOSE: The primary objective of this sub-study, undertaken as an extension to 
the previously reported phase-I study, was to explore the feasibility, 
tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of belinostat when administered by the 
oral route. Preliminary pharmacodynamic (PD) studies were also performed to 
enable comparison of the biological effects of the oral and intravenous 
formulations.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Oral belinostat was administered in a range of doses and 
schedules (once, twice or thrice daily), on either day 1 or days 1-5, of the 
second or a subsequent treatment cycle in 15 patients who were included in the 
phase-I trial of intravenous belinostat. Serial blood samples were collected for 
PK and PD (histone acetylation) analyses, and the results compared with 
corresponding analyses following intravenous administration.
RESULTS: A total mean daily AUC of 2,767 ± 1,453 ng h/ml (8.7 ± 4.6 μM h) 
resulted from a dose of 1,000 mg/m(2) once daily (qd). There was no clear 
evidence of drug accumulation on twice daily dosing (bid); however, a trend 
towards accumulation was apparent when belinostat was given three times daily 
(tid). Mean half-life (T½) of a single dose of 1,000 mg/m(2) was 1.5 h (± 0.3 h) 
and peak levels were reached in an average of 1.9 h (± 0.3 h). The half-life was 
found to be independent of dose, but a trend towards increasing half-life 
following multiple dosing was observed. Histone H4 hyperacetylation in PBMCs 
estimated after oral dosing was comparable to that achieved after intravenous 
administration.
CONCLUSIONS: High doses of oral belinostat, up to 1,000 mg/m(2) bid for 5 
consecutive days, have been tolerated in this small study. An oral formulation 
could lead to enhanced drug exposure and, more importantly, prolonged effects on 
the intended drug target. Future trials are required to establish the optimal 
dose and schedule of oral administration of belinostat.

Health economic evaluation of a vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster 
(shingles) and post-herpetic neuralgia in adults in Belgium.

Author information:
(1)Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against herpes 
zoster (HZ) and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in individuals aged 60 years and 
older in Belgium.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of 
vaccination with that of a policy of no vaccination. The model estimated the 
lifetime incidence and consequences of HZ and PHN using inputs derived from 
Belgian data, literature sources, and expert opinion. Cost-effectiveness was 
measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Vaccination in individuals aged 60 years and older resulted in ICERs of 
€6,799 (third party payer perspective), €7,168 (healthcare perspective), and 
€7,137 (societal perspective). The number needed to vaccinate to prevent one 
case was 12 for HZ, and 35 or 36 for PHN depending on the definition used. 
Univariate sensitivity analyses produced ICERs of €4,959-19,052/QALY; duration 
of vaccine efficacy had the greatest impact on cost-effectiveness. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis showed at least a 94% probability of ICERs remaining below 
the unofficial €30,000 threshold.
DISCUSSION: Key strengths of the model are the combination of efficacy data from 
a pivotal clinical trial with country-specific epidemiological data and complete 
sensitivity analysis performed. Main limitations are the use of non 
country-specific PHN proportion and non Belgian disease-specific utilities. 
Results are comparable with those recently published.
CONCLUSIONS: HZ vaccination in individuals aged 60 years and older would

OBJECTIVE: • To evaluate the safety and efficacy of once-daily trospium chloride 
extended release (ER) in overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) in subjects aged ≥ 75 
years.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: • The analysis included subjects ≥ 75 years of age with 
OAB. • A subgroup analysis of pooled data was performed for subjects aged ≥ 75 
years from two randomized, double-blind, multicenter studies of subjects with 
OAB receiving once-daily trospium 60 mg extended release (ER) or placebo for 12 
weeks, followed by 9-month open-label extension periods during which all 
subjects received trospium ER. A total of 143 of the 1165 subjects from two 
phase III registration trials who were aged ≥ 75 years (85 trospium ER, 58 
placebo; mean age 79 years and ranging up to 90 years; 73% female) were 
evaluated. • Dual primary efficacy variables were the changes from baseline in 
the average number of toilet voids per day and urge urinary incontinence 
episodes per day.
RESULTS: • At week 12 of the double-blind period, trospium ER produced greater 
improvements from baseline than placebo in voiding diary parameters, OAB Patient 
Global Assessment, and quality of life. • Efficacy and tolerability persisted 
among subjects receiving open-label trospium ER for up to 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: • Once-daily trospium chloride 60 mg ER demonstrated efficacy vs 
placebo and was tolerated in subjects aged ≥ 75 years with OAB. • For subjects 
who continued into the open-label treatment period, efficacy and tolerability 
were observed for up to 1 year.

BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster (HZ) is a painful disease affecting a considerable 
part of the elderly. Programmatic HZ vaccination of elderly people may 
considerably reduce HZ morbidity and its related costs, but the extent of these 
effects is unknown. In this article, the potential effects and 
cost-effectiveness of programmatic HZ vaccination of elderly in the Netherlands 
have been assessed according to a framework that was developed to support 
evidence-based decision making regarding inclusion of new vaccines in the Dutch 
National Immunization Program.
METHODS: An analytical framework was used combining a checklist, which 
structured relevant data on the vaccine, pathogen and disease, and a 
cost-effectiveness analysis. The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from 
a societal perspective, using a Markov-cohort-model. Simultaneous vaccination 
with influenza was assumed.
RESULTS: Due to the combination of waning immunity after vaccination and a 
reduced efficacy of vaccination at high ages, the most optimal 
cost-effectiveness ratio (21716 euro per QALY) for HZ vaccination in the 
Netherlands was found for 70-year olds. This estimated ratio is just above the 
socially accepted threshold in the Netherlands of 20000 euro per QALY. If 
additional reduction of postherpetic neuralgia was included, the 
cost-effectiveness ratio improved (approximately 10000 euro per QALY) but 
uncertainty for this scenario is high.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination against HZ at the age of 70 years seems marginally 
cost-effective in the Netherlands. Due to limited vaccine efficacy a 
considerable part of the disease burden caused by HZ will remain, even with 
optimal acceptance of programmatic vaccination.

BACKGROUND: The Kato-Katz technique is widely used for the diagnosis of 
soil-transmitted helminthiasis in epidemiological surveys and is believed to be 
an inexpensive method. The FLOTAC technique shows a higher sensitivity for the 
diagnosis of light-intensity soil-transmitted helminth infections but is 
reported to be more complex and expensive. We assessed the costs related to the 
collection, processing and microscopic examination of stool samples using the 
Kato-Katz and FLOTAC techniques in an epidemiological survey carried out in 
Zanzibar, Tanzania.
METHODS: We measured the time for the collection of a single stool specimen in 
the field, transfer to a laboratory, preparation and microscopic examination 
using standard protocols for the Kato-Katz and FLOTAC techniques. Salaries of 
health workers, life expectancy and asset costs of materials, and infrastructure 
costs were determined. The average cost for a single or duplicate Kato-Katz 
thick smears and the FLOTAC dual or double technique were calculated.
RESULTS: The average time needed to collect a stool specimen and perform a 
single or duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears or the FLOTAC dual or double 
technique was 20 min and 34 sec (20:34 min), 27:21 min, 28:14 min and 36:44 min, 
respectively. The total costs for a single and duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears 
were US$ 1.73 and US$ 2.06, respectively, and for the FLOTAC double and dual 
technique US$ 2.35 and US$ 2.83, respectively. Salaries impacted most on the 
total costs of either method.
CONCLUSIONS: The time and cost for soil-transmitted helminth diagnosis using 
either the Kato-Katz or FLOTAC method in epidemiological surveys are 
considerable. Our results can help to guide healthcare decision makers and 
scientists in budget planning and funding for epidemiological surveys, 
anthelminthic drug efficacy trials and monitoring of control interventions.

Bupropion as the treatment of choice in depression associated with Parkinson's 
disease and it's various treatments.

Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.

Parkinson disease (PD) is a chronic progressive degenerative disorder that 
affects over 6 million people worldwide. It is manifested by motor and 
psychiatric signs. The latter inflicts up to 88% of PD patients. With the 
prolongation of life expectancy, it is presumed that the prevalence of PD will 
further rise, together with comorbid depression. As a result, the need for an 
adequate therapeutic answer for compounded PD with depression is called for 
urgently. Several theories try to explain the trigger of depression in PD 
patients by impaired activity in dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin systems. 
Various treatment to combat depressive symptoms in PD patients were proposed and 
are in use, with ambiguous results and disturbing side effects. These 
anti-depressive modalities include SSRI's, SNRI, TCA, NRI and ECT. Dopamine 
agonists showed some anti-depressant activity in several studies in depressive 
PD, but may cause side effects such as dizziness, somnolence, confusion and even 
hallucinations. The role of dopamine agonists in the treatment of depression is 
still being explored because of no sufficient number of controlled studies in 
this area. Our hypothesis is to suggest NDRI - Bupropion - as the first line of 
treatment in PD patients with depression, in PD induced depression and/or in 
depression triggered by one of the treatments given for PD. Dual norepinephrine 
and dopamine reuptake inhibition is associated with unique clinical profile that 
compounds together anti-depressant efficacy without serotonin associated side 
effects such as weight gain, sedation, sexual dysfunction. Bupropion, as mainly 
dopaminergic and noradrenergic anti-depressant can alleviate therapeutically 
depressive symptoms associated with PD. Clinical controlled studies on Bupropion 
use in PD depressed patients are required to support this hypothesis.

Radiation oncology in brain tumors: current approaches and clinical trials in 
progress.

Radiation therapy remains a critical therapeutic modality in the treatment of 
adult brain tumors. However, its use continues to evolve depending on the 
histologic findings of the brain tumor. In high-grade gliomas, current trials 
focus on the addition of systemic agents and optimization of target delineation 
to improve the therapeutic ratio of radiotherapy. In low-grade gliomas, the life 
expectancy is much greater, and the possibility of late effects of radiotherapy 
have shaped contemporary trials to attempt to identify groups that benefit from 
radiotherapy versus the ones that may defer radiotherapy until tumor 
progression. With primary central nervous system lymphoma, the advent of 
high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy and the risk of severe early 
neurocognitive toxicity have brought the role of radiotherapy into question. 
With meningioma, the use of normal tissue-sparing techniques such as 
radiosurgery has allowed for the successful treatment of patients who are 
eminently curable and with a life expectancy that is generally no different than 
that of the general population. Particular attention in this review is paid to 
current approaches, contemporary trials, and modern therapeutic dilemmas.

The Extension Family Lifestyle Intervention Project (E-FLIP for Kids): design 
and methods.

The Extension Family Lifestyle Intervention Project (E-FLIP for Kids) is a 
three-arm, randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of two 
behavioral weight management interventions in an important and at-risk 
population, overweight and obese children and their parents in rural counties. 
Participants will include 240 parent-child dyads from nine rural counties in 
north central Florida. Dyads will be randomized to one of three conditions: (a) 
a Family-Based Behavioral Group Intervention, (b) a Parent-Only Behavioral Group 
Intervention, and (c) an Education Control Condition. Child and parent 
participants will be assessed at baseline (month 0), post-treatment (month 12) 
and follow-up (month 24). Assessment and intervention sessions will be held at 
Cooperative Extension Service offices within each participating county. The 
primary outcome measure is change in child BMI z-score. Additional key outcome 
measures include child body fat, waist circumference, dietary intake, physical 
activity, blood lipids, blood glucose, blood pressure, physical fitness, quality 
of life, and program and participants costs. Parent BMI, dietary intake, and 
physical activity also will be assessed. Randomized controlled trials testing 
the effectiveness of childhood obesity interventions in real-world 
community-based settings are extremely valuable, but much too rare. The E-FLIP 
for Kids trial will evaluate the impact of a community-based intervention 
delivered to families in rural settings utilizing the existing Cooperative 
Extension Service network on long-term child behavior, weight status and 
biological markers of diabetes and early cardiovascular disease. If successful, 
a Parent-Only intervention program may provide a cost-effective and practical 
intervention for families in underserved rural communities.

Nursing, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA. hj2198@columbia.edu

BACKGROUND: Although trends in the prevalence of obesity and 
obesity-attributable deaths have been examined, little is known about the 
resultant burden of disease associated with obesity.
PURPOSE: This study examined trends in the burden of obesity by estimating the 
obesity-related quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost-defined as the sum of 
QALYs lost due to morbidity and future QALYs lost in expected life years due to 
premature deaths-among U.S. adults along with differences by gender, 
race/ethnicity, and state.
METHODS: Health-related quality-of-life data were taken from the 1993-2008 
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to calculate QALYs lost due to 
morbidity. Age-specific mortality data were used to calculate QALYs lost due to 
mortality.
RESULTS: QALYs lost due to obesity in U.S. adults have more than doubled from 
1993 to 2008. Black women had the most QALYs lost due to obesity, at 0.0676 per 
person in 2008. This number was 31% higher than the QALYs lost in black men and 
about 50% higher than the QALYs lost in white women and white men. A strong and 
positive relationship between obesity-related QALYs lost and the percentage of 
the population reporting no leisure-time physical activity at the state level 
(r=0.71) also was found.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis enables the overall impact of obesity on both 
morbidity and mortality to be examined using a single value. The overall health 
burden of obesity has increased since 1993 and such increases were observed in 
all gender-by-race subgroups and in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Topotecan for relapsed small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and economic 
evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Topotecan is a relatively new drug for use as a second-line 
treatment in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We performed 
a systematic review and economic evaluation of topotecan, and consider it here 
in relation to the NICE end of life criteria.
METHODS: Seventeen bibliographic databases (including Cochrane library, Medline 
and Embase) were searched from 1990 to February 2009, and experts and 
manufacturers were consulted, to identify relevant randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) which were selected according to prospectively defined criteria. An 
economic evaluation was undertaken to assess cost effectiveness compared with 
best supportive care (BSC) in the UK.
RESULTS: Five RCTs were included. The clinical evidence indicates a 
statistically significant benefit of oral topotecan plus BSC compared to BSC 
alone for overall survival. Intravenous topotecan was similar in efficacy to 
both oral topotecan and CAV (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine). In 
the survival model, oral topotecan plus BSC was associated with an average gain 
in life expectancy of approximately 4 months, resulting in a gain of 0.183 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). At an incremental cost of approximately 
£6200 the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) is £33,851 per QALY 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with BSC alone, oral topotecan for patients with relapsed 
SCLC was associated with improved health outcomes but at increased cost. The 
ICER is at the upper extreme of the range conventionally regarded as cost 
effective from an NHS decision making perspective. However, this treatment may 
fall under supplementary guidance for life extending, end of life treatments.

Hospital, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey. denizaltincaba@yahoo.com

STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of 
gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and gestational impaired glucose tolerance 
(GIGT) in adolescent pregnancies, associated risk factors, and pregnancy 
complications.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTINGS: Community-based teaching hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: Results of 1653 pregnant women age ≤ 19 years in 2005-2007 were 
reviewed.
INTERVENTION: All pregnant women screened with 50-g glucose challenge test (GCT) 
and patients with a GCT result ≥ 140 mg/dl underwent a 3-hour 100-g oral glucose 
tolerance test (OGTT).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: GDM was diagnosed with at least two abnormal results and 
GIGT was diagnosed with one abnormal result. GDM and GIGT cases were evaluated 
for the presence of any associated risk factors and effects of presence of risk 
factors on pregnancy outcomes.
RESULTS: The prevalence of GDM was 0.85% (95% CI, 0.41-1.29), GIGT was 0.5% (95% 
CI, 0.15-0.81) and GDM+GIGT was 1.35% (95% CI, 0.78-1.88) by Carpenter and 
Coustan criteria. 68% of patients had at least one of the risk factors including 
body mass index ≥ 25, family history of diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome 
(PCOS). Only 9.1% (n = 2) of them required insulin for glucose regulation during 
pregnancy with 9.1% (n = 2) macrosomia rate. All patients were primiparous and 
cesarean delivery rate was 27.3% (n = 6). We could not find any effect of 
presence of risk factors on pregnancy outcomes in GDM and GIGT cases.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that GDM and GIGT are strongly associated with high 
BMI before pregnancy, PCOS, and family history of diabetes. Since GDM is a state 
of prediabetes, it is important to diagnose in adolescent pregnancies 
considering their life expectancy to take preventive measures to avoid diabetes 
mellitus.

USA. cbloss@scripps.edu

Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process influenced by a number of 
genetic and non-genetic factors. This article first reviews genetic strategies 
for human aging research and considers the advantages and disadvantages of each. 
We then discuss the issue of phenotypic definition for genetic studies of aging, 
including longevity/life span, as well as disease-free survival and other 
endophenotypes. Finally, we argue that extensions of this area of research, 
including incorporation of gene×environment interactions, multivariate 
phenotypes, integration of functional genomic annotations, and exploitation of 
orthology - many of which are already initiated and ongoing - are critical to 
advancing this field.

BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of initial strategies in managing Canadian 
patients with uninvestigated upper gastrointestinalsymptoms remains 
controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of six management approaches to 
uninvestigated upper gastrointestinal symptoms in the Canadian setting.
METHODS: The present study analyzed data from four randomized trials assessing 
homogeneous and complementary populations of Canadian patients with 
uninvestigated upper gastrointestinal symptoms with comparable outcomes. 
Symptom-free months, qualityadjusted life-years (QALYs) and direct costs in 
Canadian dollars of two management approaches based on the Canadian Dyspepsia 
Working Group (CanDys) Clinical Management Tool, and four additional strategies 
(two empirical antisecretory agents, and two prompt endoscopy) were examined and 
compared. Prevalence data, probabilities, utilities and costs were included in a 
Markov model, while sensitivity analysis used Monte Carlo simulations. 
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability 
curves were determined.
RESULTS: Empirical omeprazole cost $226 per QALY ($49 per symptom-free month) 
per patient. CanDys omeprazole and endoscopy approaches were more effective than 
empirical omeprazole, but more costly. Alternatives using H2-receptor 
antagonists were less effective than those using a proton pump inhibitor. No 
significant differences were found for most incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios. As willingness to pay (WTP) thresholds rose from $226 to $24,000 per 
QALY, empirical antisecretory approaches were less likely to be the most 
costeffective choice, with CanDys omeprazole progressively becoming a more 
likely option. For WTP values ranging from $24,000 to $70,000 per QALY, the most 
clinically relevant range, CanDys omeprazole was the most cost-effective 
strategy (32% to 46% of the time), with prompt endoscopy-proton pump inhibitor 
favoured at higher WTP values.
CONCLUSIONS: Although no strategy was the indisputable cost effective option, 
CanDys omeprazole may be the strategy of choiceover a clinically relevant range 
of WTP assumptions in the initial management of Canadian patients with 
uninvestigated dyspepsia.<p>
