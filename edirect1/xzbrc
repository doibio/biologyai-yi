The sophisticated DNA-uptake machinery used during natural transformation is 
still poorly characterized, especially in Gram-negative bacteria where the 
transforming DNA has to cross two membranes as well as the peptidoglycan layer 
before entering the cytoplasm. The DNA-uptake machinery was hypothesized to take 
the form of a pseudopilus, which, upon repeated cycles of extension and 
retraction, would pull external DNA towards the cell surface or into the 
periplasmic space, followed by translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane. In 
this review, we summarize recent advances on the DNA-uptake machinery of V. 
cholerae, highlighting the presence of an extended competence-induced pilus and 
the contribution of a conserved DNA-binding protein that acts as a ratchet and 
reels DNA into the periplasm.

BACKGROUND: A prognostic test was developed to guide adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) 
decisions in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinomas. The 
objective of this study was to compare the cost-utility of the prognostic test 
to the current standard of care (SoC) in patients with early-stage NSCLC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lifetime costs (2014 U.S. dollars) and effectiveness 
(quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) of ACT treatment decisions were examined 
using a Markov microsimulation model from a U.S. third-party payer perspective. 
Cancer stage distribution and probability of receiving ACT with the SoC were 
based on data from an academic cancer center. The probability of receiving ACT 
with the prognostic test was estimated from a physician survey. Risk 
classification was based on the 5-year predicted NSCLC-related mortality. 
Treatment benefit with ACT was based on the prognostic score. Discounting at a 
3% annual rate was applied to costs and QALYs. Deterministic one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses examined parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: Lifetime costs and effectiveness were $137,403 and 5.45 QALYs with the 
prognostic test and $127,359 and 5.17 QALYs with the SoC. The resulting 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the prognostic test versus the SoC was 
$35,867/QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated the model was most 
sensitive to the utility of patients without recurrence after ACT and the ACT 
treatment benefit. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated the prognostic 
test was cost-effective in 65.5% of simulations at a willingness to pay of 
$50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: The study suggests using a prognostic test to guide ACT decisions in 
early-stage NSCLC is potentially cost-effective compared with using the SoC 
based on globally accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Providing prognostic information to decision makers 
may help some patients with high-risk early stage non-small cell lung cancer 
receive appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy while avoiding the associated 
toxicities and costs in patients with low-risk disease. This study used an 
economic model to assess the effectiveness and costs associated with using a 
prognostic test to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions compared with the 
current standard of care in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. When 
compared with current standard care, the prognostic test was potentially cost 
effective at commonly accepted thresholds in the U.S. This study can be used to 
help inform decision makers who are considering using prognostic tests.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare medical condition that 
significantly shortens life expectancy. The lack of understanding and complexity 
of treatments frequently lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment of patients. 
This is worsened by the gap in medical education related to the rarity of 
disease and the subspecialty nature of management. Advancements in diagnostics 
and treatment in recent years makes a review of this nature important and 
timely. Understanding the specialty nature of drug therapy, the complexities of 
managing prostacyclin analogs, and treatment algorithms are essential for 
pharmacists caring for these patients in both acute and ambulatory settings. 
This review article will provide an overview of published guidelines as well as 
discuss new therapies, clinical controversies, and the pharmacist's role in the 
management of these patients.

The impact of localized prostate cancer in the elderly depends on disease 
aggressiveness and life expectancy. In men with localized prostate cancer, those 
with low-risk disease or a shorter life expectancy should be managed 
expectantly, whereas those with long life expectancy or more aggressive disease 
may benefit from curative treatment. Comorbidity and quality-of-life concerns 
are key considerations during the selection of therapeutic modalities in the 
elderly in localized and metastatic settings. A variety of new agents have 
changed the therapeutic landscape in castrate-resistant prostate cancer, but 
their benefits need to be considered alongside their side effects and cost.

Breast cancer is the mostly commonly diagnosed cancer in women both in the 
United States and worldwide. Although advanced age at diagnosis is associated 
with more favorable tumor biology, mortality rates are comparatively higher in 
older adults, possibly attributed to advanced stage at presentation. There are 
minimal specific treatment-based guidelines in elderly patients with cancer, 
mostly attributable to their limited inclusion on clinical trials. In addition 
to the existing evidence from clinical trials and retrospective studies, 
practitioners need to take into consideration functional status, social support, 
patient preference, presence of comorbidities, and life expectancy when 
selecting optimal treatment.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are hematologic 
diseases that frequently affect older adults. Treatment is challenging. 
Management of older adults with MDS and AML needs to be individualized, 
accounting for both the heterogeneity of disease biology and patient 
characteristics, which can influence life expectancy and treatment tolerance. 
Clinical trials accounting for the heterogeneity of tumor biology and 
physiologic changes of aging are needed to define optimal standards of care. 
This article highlights key evidence related to the management of older adults 
with MDS and AML and highlights future directions for research.

Since its discovery in 1923 and further characterization in 1958, hairy cell 
leukemia (HCL) has undergone enormous advances in the understanding of the 
biology and treatment of the disease. Initially a uniformly fatal disease, new 
therapies in rapid succession transformed HCL into a chronic disease with a 
normal life expectancy in many cases. More recently, the identification of 
BRAFV600E mutations in the majority of patients with classic HCL have enabled 
targeted therapies as a therapeutic option. Additional discoveries into the 
biology of the disease have identified new subtypes of HCL. Modern approaches to 
the evaluation and treatment of HCL include detailed molecular analysis which 
informs therapeutic options, which may consist of traditional therapies such as 
purine nucleoside analogs, or targeted therapies with antibodies, BTK 
inhibitors, or BRAF inhibitors, or combination therapy. Because HCL is a rare 
disease, continued progress depends on patients being enrolled on clinical 
trials whenever possible.

Congenital cardiovascular structural abnormalities, hypertension, low birth 
weight, increased prevalence of obesity, frequent glucose intolerance and 
dyslipidemia are risk factors of premature mortality for cardiovascular events 
in Turner syndrome (TS). The life expectancy in TS is reduced by at least 10 
years and the risk of premature death is increased 3-fold compared to general 
female population. Hormonal therapy in TS, both estrogens in different 
algorithms and growth hormone in supraphysiological dose, may additionally 
modify these factors. In this review we summarize cardiometabolic markers 
potentially present in girls and women with TS.

The Effects of Life Domains, Constraints, and Motivations on Academic 
Dishonesty: A Partial Test and Extension of Agnew's General Theory.

Cochran JK(1).

Author information:
(1)1 University of South Florida, Tampa, USA.

Recently, Robert Agnew introduced a new general theory of crime and delinquency 
in which he attempted to corral the vast array of theoretical "causes" of 
criminal conduct into a more parsimonious statement organized into one of five 
life domains: self, family, peers, school, and work as well as constraints 
against crime and motivation for it. These domains are depicted as the source of 
constraints and motivations and whose effects are, in part, mediated by these 
constraints and motivations. Based on self-report data on academic dishonesty 
from a sample of college students, the present study attempts to test this 
general theory. While several of the life domain variables had significant 
effects of cheating in the baseline model, all of these effects were fully 
mediated by constraints and motivations. In the final model, academic dishonesty 
was observed to be most significantly affected by the perceived severity of 
formal sanction threats, the number of credit hours enrolled, the frequency of 
skipping classes, and pressure from friends.

Selection of effective herbicides to control weeds has been one of the major 
objectives of scientists. This study determines the differential tolerance or 
susceptibility of crickweed (Malachium aquaticum L.) to various concentration 
combinations of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (1, 10 and 100mg/L) and propyl 
4-(2-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yloxy)benzylamino)benzoate (ZJ0273) (100, 200, 
and 500mg/L). ALA was applied as pre- and post-treatment alone or in combination 
with ZJ0273. Results showed that ZJ0273 stress alone imposed negative effects on 
M. aquaticum seedling's growth, net photosynthetic rates and SPAD values, and 
the rate of decline was consistently increased with the increase in ZJ0273 
concentration. The ZJ0273 treatment showed a gradual decrease in the activities 
of antioxidant enzymes peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and 
ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and increase in the accumulation of malondialdehyde 
(MDA). Changes in chloroplast swelling, increased number of plastoglobuli, 
disruption of thylakoid, disintegrated mitochondria and turbid nucleoplasm were 
noticed. Moreover, SDS-PAGE analysis of total proteins revealed that herbicide 
stress in the leaves was associated with the decrease or disappearance of some 
protein bands. Further, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) results 
showed that proteins in different spots were classified into three types for M. 
aquaticum. These results indicate that the combined treatment of ALA and ZJ0273 
synergizes the herbicide toxicity which is different from its independent 
effects on M. aquaticum and thus, could improve weed control efficacy.

A novel multiplex PCR assay using non-homologous oligonucleotides with locked 
nucleic acid (LNA) modifications as universal primers was developed and 
validated for the simultaneous detection of five swine viruses. The assay 
utilizes five virus-specific primer pairs modified at the 5' end through the 
addition of the universal primer sequence. In the reaction, small amounts of 
target templates with the 5' tail were generated and subsequently amplified 
through the extension of a LNA universal primer set. To validate the specificity 
of this assay, 27 viral target strains and 12 non-target pathogens were tested. 
The lower limit of detection of viral nucleic acids was 1.1-1.9 pg per reaction 
or 11-32 pg in a five-plex viral nucleic acid mixture. The LNA mPCR assay 
displayed higher analytical sensitivity and efficiency for the detection of 
plasmid standards compared with the conventional assay, which uses standard 
primers without the 5' tail. A total of 207 field samples were tested using both 
assays. The LNA mPCR assay provided numerically higher detection rates for all 
pathogens in independent samples. Moreover, the LNA mPCR assay had significantly 
higher detection rates in independent samples compared with the conventional 
assay.

The demographic structure of populations in both more developed and less 
developed countries is changing: increases in life expectancy and declining 
fertility have led to older populations and smaller households. The implications 
of these demographic changes for the spread and control of infectious diseases 
are not fully understood. Here we use an individual based model with realistic 
and dynamic age and household structure to demonstrate the marked effect that 
demographic change has on disease transmission at the population and household 
level. The decline in fertility is associated with a decrease in disease 
incidence and an increase in the age of first infection, even in the absence of 
vaccination or other control measures. Although large households become rarer as 
fertility decreases, we show that there is a proportionate increase in incidence 
of disease in these households as the accumulation of susceptible clusters 
increases the potential for explosive outbreaks. By modelling vaccination, we 
provide a direct comparison of the relative importance of demographic change and 
vaccination on incidence of disease. We highlight the increased risks associated 
with unvaccinated households in a low fertility setting if vaccine behaviour is 
correlated with household membership. We suggest that models that do not account 
for future demographic change, and especially its effect on household structure, 
may potentially overestimate the impact of vaccination.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Supervised injection facilities (legally sanctioned spaces 
for supervised consumption of illicitly obtained drugs) are controversial public 
health interventions. We determined the optimal number of facilities in two 
Canadian cities using health economic methods.
DESIGN: Dynamic compartmental model of HIV and hepatitis C transmission through 
sexual contact and sharing of drug use equipment.
SETTING: Toronto and Ottawa, Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: Simulated population of each city.
INTERVENTIONS: Zero to five supervised injection facilities.
MEASUREMENTS: Direct health-care costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
over 20 years, discounted at 5% per year; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
FINDINGS: In Toronto, one facility cost $4.1 million and resulted in a gain of 
385 QALYs over 20 years, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
$10,763 per QALY [95% credible interval (95CrI): cost-saving to $278,311]. 
Establishing one facility in Ottawa had an ICER of $6127 per QALY (95CrI: 
cost-saving to $179,272). At a $50,000 per QALY threshold, three facilities 
would be cost-effective in Toronto and two in Ottawa. The probability that 
establishing three, four, or five facilities in Toronto was cost-effective was 
17, 21, and 41%, respectively. Establishing one, two, or three facilities in 
Ottawa was cost-effective with 13, 35, and 41% probability, respectively. 
Establishing no facility was unlikely to be the most cost-effective option (14% 
in Toronto and 10% in Ottawa). In both cities, results were robust if the 
reduction in needle-sharing among clients of the facilities was at least 50% and 
fixed operating costs were less than $2.0 million.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-years threshold for 
cost-effectiveness, it is likely to be cost-effective to establish at least 
three legally sanctioned spaces for supervised injection of illicitly obtained 
drugs in Toronto, Canada and two in Ottawa, Canada.

Therapeutic fusion proteins (TFPs) are designed to improve the therapeutic 
profile of an endogenous protein or protein fragment with a limited dose 
frequency providing the desired pharmacological activity in vivo. Fusion of a 
therapeutic protein to a half-life extension or targeting domain can improve the 
disposition of the molecule or introduce a novel mechanism of action. Prolonged 
exposure and altered biodistribution of an endogenous protein through fusion 
technology increases the potential for local protein unfolding during 
circulation increasing the chance for partial proteolysis of the therapeutic 
domain. Characterizing the proteolytic liabilities of a TFP can guide 
engineering efforts to inhibit or hinder partial proteolysis. This review 
focuses on considerations and techniques for evaluating the stability of a TFP 
both in vivo and in vitro.

OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into the cost-effectiveness of the ketogenic (KD) 
diet compared with care as usual (CAU) in children and adolescents with 
intractable epilepsy, we conducted an economic evaluation from a societal 
perspective, alongside a randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: Participants from a tertiary epilepsy center were randomized into KD 
(intervention) group or CAU (control) group. Seizure frequency, quality adjusted 
life years (QALYs), health care costs, production losses of parents and patient, 
and family costs were assessed at baseline and during a 4-month study period and 
compared between the intervention and control groups. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (i.e., cost per QALY and cost per responder), 
and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were calculated and 
presented.
RESULTS: In total, 48 children were included in the analyses of this study (26 
KD group). At 4 months, 50% of the participants in the KD group had a seizure 
reduction ≥50% from baseline, compared with 18.2 of the participants in the CAU 
group. The mean costs per patient in the CAU group were €15,245 compared to 
€20,986 per patient in the KD group, resulting in an ICER of €18,044 per 
responder. We failed, however, to measure any benefits in terms of QALYs and 
therefore, the cost per QALY rise high above any acceptable ceiling ratio. It 
might be that the quality of life instruments used in this study were not 
sufficiently sensitive to detect changes, or it might be that being a clinical 
responder is not sufficient to improve a patient's quality of life. Univariate 
and multivariate sensitivity analyses and nonparametric bootstrapping were 
performed and demonstrated the robustness of our results.
SIGNIFICANCE: The results show that the KD reduces seizure frequency. The study 
did not find any improvements in quality of life and, therefore, unfavorable 
cost per QALY ratio's resulted.

Medical advances have led to a welcome increase in life expectancy. However, 
accompanying longevity introduces new challenges: increases in age-related 
diseases and associated reductions in quality of life. The loss of skeletal 
tissue that can accompany trauma, injury, disease or advancing years can result 
in significant morbidity and significant socio-economic cost and emphasise the 
need for new, more reliable skeletal regeneration strategies. To address the 
unmet need for bone augmentation, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine 
have come to the fore in recent years with new approaches for de novo skeletal 
tissue formation. Typically, these approaches seek to harness stem cells, 
innovative scaffolds and biological factors that promise enhanced and more 
reliable bone formation strategies to improve the quality of life for many. This 
review provides an overview of recent developments in bone tissue engineering 
focusing on skeletal stem cells, vascular development, bone formation and the 
translation from preclinical in vivo models to clinical delivery.

BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) occurs primarily in the elderly, 
and the majority of deaths attributable to CLL occur in persons 65 years of age 
or older. The greater number of comorbidities and reduced functionality 
associated with aging have also made successful treatment of CLL in the elderly 
more difficult.
METHODS: The authors reviewed current epidemiology and guidelines for treatment 
of CLL, as well as recently approved therapies and studies of physiological 
aging.
RESULTS: Determination of physiological age and performance of a thorough 
geriatric assessment play critical roles in the selection of optimal therapeutic 
approaches for older patients diagnosed with CLL.
CONCLUSION: Older age, expressed via a frailty index, is a prognostic factor for 
poorer outcome in patients with CLL. However, several novel treatment options 
may result in reduced mortality and lessened treatment-related toxicity in older 
CLL patients.

This study modelled the cost-effectiveness of 11 oral antipsychotics for relapse 
prevention among patients with remitted schizophrenia in Singapore. A network 
meta-analysis determined the relative efficacy and tolerability of 11 oral 
antipsychotics (amisulpride, aripiprazole, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, 
olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, sulpiride, trifluoperazine 
and ziprasidone). The clinical estimates were applied in a Markov model to 
estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years gained. Quality-of-life 
data were obtained from published literature. Resource utilization and cost data 
were retrieved from local hospital databases. The annual direct cost of 
healthcare services for a patient experiencing a relapse episode was three-fold 
that of a patient not in relapse of schizophrenia. The most favourable 
pharmacological treatment for relapse prevention was olanzapine with an annual 
probability of relapse of 0.24 (0.13-0.38) with placebo as a reference of 0.75 
(0.73-0.78). Olanzapine emerged as the dominant treatment with the highest 
quality-adjusted life-years gained and lowest lifetime costs. Ziprasidone, 
aripiprazole and paliperidone incurred higher lifetime costs compared with no 
treatment. Probability and cost of relapse were key drivers of 
cost-effectiveness in sensitivity analyses. The data can help prescribers in 
choosing appropriate treatment and payers in allocating resources for the 
clinical management of this serious psychiatric disorder.

The management of metastatic melanoma has been revolutionized in recent years 
with the development of both targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Although 
potentially extending the life expectancy for patients, these therapies also 
significantly increase the healthcare expenditure. In this paper, we review the 
monthly costs for drugs approved by the FDA since 2011. Additionally, factors 
that affect the cost, such as dosing strategies, biomarkers, combination 
therapies, and political/legislative issues, will be discussed.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease 
with a median life expectancy of 4-5 years after initial diagnosis. Early 
diagnosis and accurate monitoring of IPF are limited by a lack of sensitive 
imaging techniques that are able to visualize early fibrotic changes at the 
epithelial-mesenchymal interface. Here, we report a new x-ray imaging approach 
that directly visualizes the air-tissue interfaces in mice in vivo. This imaging 
method is based on the detection of small-angle x-ray scattering that occurs at 
the air-tissue interfaces in the lung. Small-angle scattering is detected with a 
Talbot-Lau interferometer, which provides the so-called x-ray dark-field signal. 
Using this imaging modality, we demonstrate-for the first time-the 
quantification of early pathogenic changes and their correlation with 
histological changes, as assessed by stereological morphometry. The presented 
radiography method is significantly more sensitive in detecting morphological 
changes compared with conventional x-ray imaging, and exhibits a significantly 
lower radiation dose than conventional x-ray CT. As a result of the improved 
imaging sensitivity, this new imaging modality could be used in future to reduce 
the number of animals required for pulmonary research studies.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term results after one-, two-, and three-level 
anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with stand-alone empty 
polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cages.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of a consecutive patient cohort 
that underwent ACDF with stand-alone empty PEEK cages between 2007 and 2010 with 
a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Radiographic follow-up included static and 
flexion/extension radiographs. Changes in the operated segments were measured 
and compared to radiographs directly after surgery. Clinical outcome was 
evaluated by a physical examination, pain visual analog scale (VAS), and 
health-related quality of life (HRQL) using the EuroQOL questionnaire (EQ-5D). 
Analysis of associations between fusion, subsidence, cervical alignment, and 
clinical outcome parameters were performed.
RESULTS: Of 407 consecutive cases, 318 met all inclusion criteria. Follow-up 
data were obtained from 265 (83 %) cases. The mean age at presentation was 55 
years and 139 patients were male (52 %). In the sample, 127, 125, and 13 
patients had one-, two-, and three-level surgeries, respectively; 132 (49 %) 
presented with spondylotic cervical myelopathy and 133 (50 %) with cervical 
radiculopathy. Fusion was achieved in 85, 95, and 94 % of segments in one-, 
two-, and three-level surgeries, respectively. Non-fusion was associated with 
higher VAS pain levels. Radiographic adjacent segment disease (ASD) was observed 
in 20, 29, and 15 % in one-, two-, and three-level surgeries, respectively. ASD 
was associated with lower HRQL. Subsidence was observed in 25, 27, and 15 % of 
segments in one-, two-, and three-level surgeries, respectively. However, this 
had no influence on clinical outcome. Follow-up operations for symptomatic 
adjacent disc disease and implant failure at index level were needed in 16 (6 %) 
and four (1.5 %) cases, respectively. Younger age was associated with better 
clinical outcome. Multilevel surgery favored better myelopathy outcomes and 
fusion reduced overall pain. ASD worsened EuroQOL-Index values. Worsening of the 
cervical alignment induced arm pain.
CONCLUSIONS: One- and two-level ACDF with stand-alone empty PEEK cages achieved 
very high fusion rates and a low rate of follow-up operations. The rate of good 
clinical outcome is highly satisfactory. Younger age was the single most 
influential factor associated with better clinical outcome.

OBJECT The health care landscape is rapidly shifting to incentivize quality of 
care rather than quantity of care. Quality and outcomes registry platforms lie 
at the center of all emerging evidence-driven reform models and will be used to 
inform decision makers in health care delivery. Obtaining real-world registry 
outcomes data from patients 12 months after spine surgery remains a challenge. 
The authors set out to determine whether 3-month patient-reported outcomes 
accurately predict 12-month outcomes and, hence, whether 3-month measurement 
systems suffice to identify effective versus noneffective spine care. METHODS 
All patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery for degenerative disease at a 
single medical institution over a 2-year period were enrolled in a prospective 
longitudinal registry. Patient-reported outcome instruments (numeric rating 
scale [NRS], Oswestry Disability Index [ODI], 12-Item Short Form Health Survey 
[SF-12], EQ-5D, and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale) were recorded 
prospectively at baseline and at 3 months and 12 months after surgery. Linear 
regression was performed to determine the independent association of 3- and 
12-month outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was 
performed to determine whether improvement in general health state (EQ-5D) and 
disability (ODI) at 3 months accurately predicted improvement and achievement of 
minimum clinical important difference (MCID) at 12 months. RESULTS A total of 
593 patients undergoing elective lumbar surgery were included in the study. 
There was a significant correlation between 3-month and 12-month EQ-5D (r = 
0.71; p < 0.0001) and ODI (r = 0.70; p < 0.0001); however, the authors observed 
a sizable discrepancy in achievement of a clinically significant improvement 
(MCID) threshold at 3 versus 12 months on an individual patient level. For 
postoperative disability (ODI), 11.5% of patients who achieved an MCID threshold 
at 3 months dropped below this threshold at 12 months; 10.5% of patients who did 
not meet the MCID threshold at 3 months continued to improve and ultimately 
surpassed the MCID threshold at 12 months. For ODI, achieving MCID at 3 months 
accurately predicted 12-month MCID with only 62.6% specificity and 86.8% 
sensitivity. For postoperative health utility (EQ-5D), 8.5% of patients lost an 
MCID threshold improvement from 3 months to 12 months, while 4.0% gained the 
MCID threshold between 3 and 12 months postoperatively. For EQ-5D 
(quality-adjusted life years), achieving MCID at 3 months accurately predicted 
12-month MCID with only 87.7% specificity and 87.2% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS In 
a prospective registry, patient-reported measures of treatment effectiveness 
obtained at 3 months correlated with 12-month measures overall in aggregate, but 
did not reliably predict 12-month outcome at the patient level. Many patients 
who do not benefit from surgery by 3 months do so by 12 months, and, conversely, 
many patients reporting meaningful improvement by 3 months report loss of 
benefit at 12 months. Prospective longitudinal spine outcomes registries need to 
span at least 12 months to identify effective versus noneffective patient care.

Understanding the implant-bone interaction is of prime interest for the 
development of novel biodegrading implants. Magnesium is a very promising 
material in the class of biodegrading metallic implants, owing to its mechanical 
properties and excellent immunologic response during healing. However, the 
influence of degrading Mg implants on the bone nanostructure is still an open 
question of crucial importance for the design of novel Mg implant alloys. This 
study investigates the changes in the nanostructure of bone following the 
application of a degrading WZ21 Mg implant (2wt% Y, 1wt% Zn, 0.25wt% Ca and 
0.15wt% Mn) in a murine model system over the course of 15months by small angle 
X-ray scattering. Our investigations showed a direct response of the bone 
nanostructure after as little as 1month with a realignment of nano-sized bone 
mineral platelets along the bone-implant interface. The growth of new bone 
tissue after implant resorption is characterized by zones of lower mineral 
platelet thickness and slightly decreased order in the stacking of the 
platelets. The preferential orientation of the mineral platelets strongly 
deviates from the normal orientation along the shaft and still roughly follows 
the implant direction after 15months. We explain our findings by considering 
geometrical, mechanical and chemical factors during the process of implant 
resorption.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The advancement of surgical techniques and the 
increased life expectancy have caused a growing demand for improved bone 
implants. Ideally, they should be bio-resorbable, support bone as long as 
necessary and then be replaced by healthy bone tissue. Magnesium is a promising 
candidate for this purpose. Various studies have demonstrated its excellent 
mechanical performance, degradation behaviour and immunologic properties. The 
structural response of bone, however, is not well known. On the nanometer scale, 
the arrangement of collagen fibers and calcium mineral platelets is an important 
indicator of structural integrity. The present study provides insight into 
nanostructural changes in rat bone at different times after implant placement 
and different implant degradation states. The results are useful for further 
improved magnesium alloys.
