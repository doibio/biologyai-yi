DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using data from the Health and Retirement 
Study (HRS) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) for 2008-2016, a 
pooled cross-sectional analysis of comparably measured health outcomes, with 
adjustment for demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status, was 
conducted. The analysis sample included community-dwelling adults aged 55 to 64 
years from the HRS and ELSA, resulting in 46 887 person-years of observations. 
Data analysis was conducted from September 17, 2019, to May 12, 2020.
EXPOSURES: Residence in the US or England and yearly income.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sixteen health outcomes were compared, including 5 
self-assessed outcomes, 3 directly measured outcomes, and 8 self-reported 
physician-diagnosed health conditions.
RESULTS: This cross-sectional study included 12 879 individuals and 31 928 
person-years from HRS (mean [SD] age, 59.2 [2.8] years; 51.9% women) and 5693 
individuals and 14 959 person-years from ELSA (mean [SD] age, 59.3 [2.9] years; 
51.0% women). After adjusting for individual-level demographic characteristics 
and socioeconomic status, a substantial health gap between lower-income and 
higher-income adults was found in both countries, but the health gap between the 
bottom 20% and the top 20% of the income distribution was significantly greater 
in the US than England on 13 of 16 measures. The adjusted US-England difference 
in the prevalence gap between the bottom 20% and the top 20% ranged from 3.6 
percentage points (95% CI, 2.0-5.2 percentage points) in stroke to 9.7 
percentage points (95% CI, 5.4-13.9 percentage points) for functional 
limitation. Among individuals in the lowest income group in each country, those 
in the US group vs the England group had significantly worse outcomes on many 
health measures (10 of 16 outcomes in the bottom income decile); the significant 
differences in adjusted prevalence of health problems in the US vs England for 
the bottom income decile ranged from 7.6% (95% CI, 6.0%-9.3%) vs 3.8% (95% CI, 
2.6%-4.9%) for stroke to 75.7% (95% CI, 72.7%-78.8%) vs 59.5% (95% CI, 
56.3%-62.7%) for functional limitation. Among individuals in the highest income 
group, those in the US group vs England group had worse outcomes on fewer health 
measures (4 of 16 outcomes in the top income decile); the significant 
differences in adjusted prevalence of health problems in the US vs England for 
the top income decile ranged from 36.9% (95% CI, 33.4%-40.4%) vs 30.0% (95% CI, 
27.2%-32.7%) for hypertension to 35.4% (95% CI, 32.0%-38.7%) vs 22.5% (95% CI, 
19.9%-25.1%) for arthritis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For most health outcomes examined in this 
cross-sectional study, the health gap between adults with low vs high income 
appeared to be larger in the US than in England, and the health disadvantages in 
the US compared with England are apparently more pronounced among individuals 
with low income. Public policy and public health interventions aimed at 
improving the health of adults with lower income should be a priority in the US.

Life expectancy in the US increased 3.3 years between 1990 and 2015, but the 
drivers of this increase are not well understood. We used vital statistics data 
and cause-deletion analysis to identify the conditions most responsible for 
changing life expectancy and quantified how public health, pharmaceuticals, 
other (nonpharmaceutical) medical care, and other/unknown factors contributed to 
the improvement. We found that twelve conditions most responsible for changing 
life expectancy explained 2.9 years of net improvement (85 percent of the 
total). Ischemic heart disease was the largest positive contributor to life 
expectancy, and accidental poisoning or drug overdose was the largest negative 
contributor. Forty-four percent of improved life expectancy was attributable to 
public health, 35 percent was attributable to pharmaceuticals, 13 percent was 
attributable to other medical care, and -7 percent was attributable to 
other/unknown factors. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of public health 
advances, as well as pharmaceutical innovation, in explaining improving life 
expectancy.

BACKGROUND: In developed countries, the extension of human life is increasingly 
accompanied by a progressive increase in neurodegenerative diseases, most of 
which do not yet have effective therapy but only symptomatic treatments. In 
recent years, plant polyphenols have aroused considerable interest in the 
scientific community. The mechanisms currently hypothesized for the pathogenesis 
of Parkinson's disease (PD) are neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and 
apoptosis. Hydroxytyrosol (HT), the main component of Hidrox® (HD), has been 
shown to have some of the highest free radical evacuation and anti-inflammatory 
activities. Here we wanted to study the role of HD on the neurobiological and 
behavioral alterations induced by rotenone.
METHODS: A study was conducted in which mice received HD (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 
concomitantly with rotenone (5 mg/kg, o.s.) for 28 days.
RESULTS: Locomotor activity, catalepsy, histological damage and several 
characteristic markers of the PD, such as the dopamine transporter (DAT) 
content, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and accumulation of α-synuclein, have been 
evaluated. Moreover, we observed the effects of HD on oxidative stress, 
neuroinflammation, apoptosis and inflammasomes. Taken together, the results 
obtained highlight HD's ability to reduce the loss of dopaminergic neurons and 
the damage associated with it by counteracting the three main mechanisms of PD 
pathogenesis.
CONCLUSION: HD is subject to fewer regulations than traditional drugs to improve 
patients' brain health and could represent a promising nutraceutical choice to 
prevent PD.

Diagnosing and treating acute coronary syndromes consumes a significant fraction 
of the healthcare budget worldwide. The pressure on resources is expected to 
increase with the continuing rise of cardiovascular disease, other chronic 
diseases and extended life expectancy, while expenditure is constrained. The 
objective of this review is to assess if home-based solutions for measuring 
chemical cardiac biomarkers can mitigate or reduce the continued rise in the 
costs of ACS treatment. A systematic review was performed considering published 
literature in several relevant public databases (i.e., PUBMED, Cochrane, Embase 
and Scopus) focusing on current biomarker practices in high-risk patients, their 
cost-effectiveness and the clinical evidence and feasibility of implementation. 
Out of 26,000 references screened, 86 met the inclusion criteria after 
independent full-text review. Current clinical evidence highlights that 
home-based solutions implemented in primary and secondary prevention reduce 
health care costs by earlier diagnosis, improved patient outcomes and quality of 
life, as well as by avoidance of unnecessary use of resources. Economical 
evidence suggests their potential to reduce health care costs if the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio or the willingness-to-pay does not surpass £20,000/QALY 
or €50,000 limit per 20,000 patients, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of 
these solutions increases when applied to high-risk patients.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the 
central nervous system (CNS) which is associated with lower life expectancy and 
disability. The experimental antigen-induced encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice is 
a useful animal model of MS, which allows exploring the etiopathogenetic 
mechanisms and testing novel potential therapeutic drugs. A new therapeutic 
paradigm for the treatment of MS was introduced in 2010 through the sphingosine 
1-phosphate (S1P) analogue fingolimod (FTY720, Gilenya®), which acts as a 
functional S1P1 antagonist on T lymphocytes to deplete these cells from the 
blood. In this study, we synthesized two novel structures, ST-1893 and ST-1894, 
which are derived from fingolimod and chemically feature a morpholine ring in 
the polar head group. These compounds showed a selective S1P1 activation profile 
and a sustained S1P1 internalization in cultures of S1P1-overexpressing Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells, consistent with a functional antagonism. In vivo, 
both compounds induced a profound lymphopenia in mice. Finally, these substances 
showed efficacy in the EAE model, where they reduced clinical symptoms of the 
disease, and, on the molecular level, they reduced the T-cell infiltration and 
several inflammatory mediators in the brain and spinal cord. In summary, these 
data suggest that S1P1-selective compounds may have an advantage over fingolimod 
and siponimod, not only in MS but also in other autoimmune diseases.

Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is a chronic and potentially fatal disease. The 
prognosis of CanL depends on the severity of the clinical signs and 
clinicopathological abnormalities presented by the dog at the time of diagnosis. 
This study aims to estimate the survival time of dogs with CanL, determining the 
prognostic value of different clinical and clinicopathological parameters. 
Medical records of 99 dogs diagnosed with CanL in five veterinary centers of the 
Alentejo region (Portugal) were examined retrospectively. The majority of dogs 
presented hyperproteinemia, moderate normocytic normochromic anemia, normal 
blood urea and creatinine levels and were classified as stage 1 according to the 
International Interest Society (IRIS) guidelines at the time of diagnosis. The 
severity of anemia, presence of concomitant infectious diseases at the time of 
diagnosis and the anti-Leishmania therapy were correlated with the survival 
time. The influence of renal dysfunction was evaluated by Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) curve and survival analysis. Survival analysis demonstrated 
that patients classified as IRIS 1 at the time of diagnosis survived more than 
four years, in contrast with dogs classified as IRIS 2 that survived around two 
and half years and dogs classified as IRIS 3-4 that survived around one month. 
IRIS stage deteriorated during the course of CanL in one third of the dogs and 
was the principal cause of death or euthanasia in a high proportion of animals. 
In some cases, dogs did not receive anti-Leishmania treatment or abandoned the 
veterinary follow-ups, which may have considerable repercussions for animal 
wellbeing and public health. This study reinforces the value of blood urea and 
creatinine levels as prognostic factors in CanL.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hydrocortisone is a cost-effective treatment for 
patients with septic shock.
DESIGN: Data linkage-based cost-effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: New South Wales and Queensland intensive care units.
PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: Patients with septic shock randomly assigned to 
treatment with hydrocortisone or placebo in the Adjunctive Glucocorticoid 
Therapy in Patients with Septic Shock (ADRENAL) trial.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health-related quality of life at 6 months using the 
EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level questionnaire. Data on hospital resource use and 
costs were obtained by linking the ADRENAL dataset to government administrative 
health databases. Clinical outcomes included mortality, health-related quality 
of life, and quality-adjusted life-years gained; economic outcomes included 
hospital resource use, costs and cost-effectiveness from the health care payer 
perspective. We also assessed cost-effectiveness by sex. To increase the 
precision of cost-effectiveness estimates, we conducted unrestricted 
bootstrapping.
RESULTS: Of 3800 patients in the ADRENAL trial, 1772 (46.6%) were eligible and 
1513 (85.4% of those eligible) were included. There was no difference between 
hydrocortisone or placebo groups in regards to mortality (218/742 [29.4%] v 
227/759 [29.9%]; HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78-1.12; P = 0.47), mean number of QALYs 
gained (0.10 ± 0.09 v 0.10 ± 0.09; P = 0.52), or total hospital costs (A$73 515 
± 61 376 v A$69 748 ± 61 793; mean difference, A$3767; 95% CI, -A$2891 to A$10 
425; P = 0.27). The incremental cost of hydrocortisone was A$1 254 078 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained. In females, hydrocortisone was cost-effective 
in 46.2% of bootstrapped replications and in males it was cost-effective in 2.7% 
of bootstrapped replications.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive hydrocortisone did not significantly affect longer term 
mortality, health-related quality of life, health care resource use or costs, 
and is unlikely to be cost-effective.

Diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of mortality and reduced life expectancy. 
We aim to estimate the burden of diabetes by type, year, regions, and 
socioeconomic status in 195 countries and territories over the past 28 years, 
which provide information to achieve the goal of World Health Organization 
Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases in 
2025. Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017. Overall, 
the global burden of diabetes had increased significantly since 1990. Both the 
trend and magnitude of diabetes related diseases burden varied substantially 
across regions and countries. In 2017, global incidence, prevalence, death, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with diabetes were 22.9 
million, 476.0 million, 1.37 million, and 67.9 million, with a projection to 
26.6 million, 570.9 million, 1.59 million, and 79.3 million in 2025, 
respectively. The trend of global type 2 diabetes burden was similar to that of 
total diabetes (including type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes), while global 
age-standardized rate of mortality and DALYs for type 1 diabetes declined. 
Globally, metabolic risks (high BMI) and behavioral factors (inappropriate diet, 
smoking, and low physical activity) contributed the most attributable death and 
DALYs of diabetes. These estimations could be useful in policy-making, priority 
setting, and resource allocation in diabetes prevention and treatment.

PURPOSE: Due to an increased human life expectancy, the need to replace 
arthritic or dysfunctional joints by prosthetics is higher than ever before. 
Prosthetic joints are unfortunately inherently susceptible to bacterial 
infection accompanied by biofilm formation. Accurate and rapid diagnosis is 
vital to increase therapeutic success. Yet, established diagnostic modalities 
cannot directly detect bacterial biofilms on prostheses. Therefore, the present 
study was aimed at investigating whether arthroscopic optical imaging can 
accurately detect bacterial biofilms on prosthetic joints.
METHODS: Here, we applied a conjugate of the antibiotic vancomycin and the 
near-infrared fluorophore IRDye800CW, in short vanco-800CW, in combination with 
arthroscopic optical imaging to target and visualize biofilms on infected 
prostheses.
RESULTS: We show in a human post-mortem prosthetic knee infection model that a 
staphylococcal biofilm is accurately detected in real time and distinguished 
from sterile sections in high resolution. In addition, we demonstrate that 
biofilms associated with the clinically most relevant bacterial species can be 
detected using vanco-800CW.
CONCLUSION: The presented image-guided arthroscopic approach provides direct 
visual diagnostic information and facilitates immediate appropriate treatment 
selection.

BACKGROUND: In a typical single-payer setting that uses an explicit 
cost-effectiveness (CE) threshold in its decision-making, the payer aims to 
maximize the net-monetary-benefit (NMB) given the CE threshold, whilst the 
manufacturer aims to maximize the expected discounted-cash-flow (DCF) resulting 
from the sales of that technology. Managed entry agreements (MEAs) are tools 
that are used to improve access to expensive technologies that would otherwise 
not be deemed to be cost-effective to payers. While simple discount on the list 
price is the most commonly applied MEA type, there are different forms, each 
having a different impact on the cost-effectiveness of the technology, on the 
lifetime DCF-per-patient and on the decision uncertainty. We aim to analyze the 
sequential decision-making (SDM) of different MEAs (i.e. simple discount, free 
treatment initiation, lifetime treatment acquisition cost-capping [LTTACC], 
performance-based money-back guarantee [MBG]) at the manufacturer and at the 
payer level, respectively.
METHODS: We first model the SDM of the manufacturer and the payer as a 
sequential game and explain the challenges to find an equilibrium analytically. 
Then we propose a heuristic computational method to follow for each of the MEA 
types, based on practice. To demonstrate this SDM on a case study, a UK-based 
cost-utility analysis using a three-state, partitioned-survival-model was 
constructed to determine the cost-effectiveness of regorafenib versus 
best-supportive-care for the second-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
The optimal agreement terms that would maximise the lifetime DCF-per-patient for 
each MEA, whilst remaining below the CE-threshold (£50,000/QALY gained) were 
obtained in the deterministic base-case. Robustness for each optimized MEA was 
then assessed using probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses, the value 
of information (VoI), and HTA-risk analyses.
RESULTS: As expected, the introduction of all MEAs improved the probabilistic 
ICER and NMB values to (almost) acceptable levels, compared to the "no-MEA" case 
(ICER ~ £78,000/QALY-gained). The expected DCFs across the explored MEAs were 
all similar, whilst the payer strategy & uncertainty burden (PSUB) for 
regorafenib decreased in all MEAs explored. VoI analyses revealed that 
regorafenib mean-dose-intensity and time-on-treatment (ToT) parameters 
attributed most to the decision uncertainty. LTTACC provided the smallest PSUB 
and the most robust NMB estimates under parametric uncertainty. For scenarios 
assuming increased regorafenib ToT or mean-dose-intensity, LTACC again provided 
acceptable cost-effectiveness outcomes, whereas for scenarios assuming decreased 
regorafenib progression-free/overall survival effectiveness, only MBG resulted 
in plausible ICER values. In scenarios, where the source of uncertainty was not 
targeted by MEA parameters (e.g. the scenario assuming higher progressed disease 
resource utilization), all investigated MEA types resulted in unacceptable 
cost-effectiveness outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Each MEA type has a different implication. The impact of different 
MEAs on the NMB is more noteworthy than on the DCF, in relative terms, hence 
payers will benefit from the early participation of the MEA design rather than 
leaving this up to the prerogative of the manufacturer. While simple discount 
might be practical for implementation purposes, other MEAs can provide 
additional benefits to the payer in terms of increased NMB, reduced decision 
risk and reduced uncertainty. MEA performance should be investigated not only 
under parametric uncertainty, but also under-identified structural uncertainty, 
and the barriers of implementation should be considered thoroughly before 
choosing the most appropriate MEA type.

Rubber is a fascinating material in both industry and daily life. The 
development of elastomeric material in nanotechnology is imperative due to its 
economic and technological potential. By virtue of their distinctive 
physicochemical properties, nucleic acids have been extensively explored in 
material science. The Phi29 DNA packaging motor contains a 3WJ with three angles 
of 97°, 125°, and 138°. Here, the rubber-like property of RNA architectures was 
investigated using optical tweezers and in vivo imaging technologies. The 3WJ 
97° interior angle was contracted or stretched to 60°, 90°, and 108° at will to 
build elegant RNA triangles, squares, pentagons, cubes, tetrahedrons, 
dendrimers, and prisms. RNA nanoarchitecture was stretchable and shrinkable by 
optical tweezer with multiple extension and relaxation repeats like a rubber. 
Comparing to gold and iron nanoparticles with the same size, RNA nanoparticles 
display stronger cancer-targeting outcomes, while less accumulation in healthy 
organs. Generally, the upper limit of renal excretion is 5.5 nm; however, the 5, 
10, and 20 nm RNA nanoparticles passed the renal filtration and resumed their 
original structure identified in urine. These findings solve two previous 
mysteries: (1) Why RNA nanoparticles have an unusually high tumor targeting 
efficiency since their rubber or amoeba-like deformation property enables them 
to squeeze out of the leaky vasculature to improve the EPR effect; and (2) why 
RNA nanoparticles remain non-toxic since they can be rapidly cleared from the 
body via renal excretion into urine with little accumulation in the body. 
Considering its controllable shape and size plus its rubber-like property, RNA 
holds great promises for industrial and biomedical applications especially in 
cancer therapeutics delivery.

INTRODUCTION: Asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy 
affect approximately 20% of the global population. Few studies describe the 
burden of the totality of these diseases and only a handful studies provide a 
comprehensive overview of the socioeconomic impact of these diseases.
AREAS COVERED: For this narrative review, we searched Pubmed using selected 
keywords and inspected relevant references using a snowballing process. We 
provide an overview of the socioeconomic burden of allergic diseases (in 
particular, asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy). The 
focus of this review is on their epidemiology (incidence, prevalence), burden 
(disability-adjusted life years, quality of life), and direct and indirect costs 
(absenteeism and presenteeism). We have put special emphasis on differences 
between countries.
EXPERT COMMENTARY: Both the prevalence and the burden of allergic diseases are 
considerable with prevalence varying between 1% and 20%. We identified a 
plethora of studies on asthma, but studies were generally difficult to compare 
due to the heterogeneity in measures used. There were only few studies on the 
burden of food allergy; therefore, more studies on this allergy are required. 
For future studies, we recommend standardizing epidemiologic, socioeconomic 
impact, and quality of life measures of allergic diseases.

BACKGROUND: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men may indicate bladder 
outlet obstruction (BOO) or weakness, known as detrusor underactivity (DU). 
Severe bothersome LUTS are a common indication for surgery. The diagnostic tests 
may include urodynamics (UDS) to confirm whether BOO or DU is the cause, 
potentially reducing the number of people receiving (inappropriate) surgery.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine whether a care pathway 
including UDS is no worse for symptom outcome than one in which it is omitted, 
at 18 months after randomisation. Rates of surgery was the key secondary 
outcome.
DESIGN: This was a pragmatic, multicentre, two-arm (unblinded) randomised 
controlled trial, incorporating a health economic analysis and qualitative 
research.
SETTING: Urology departments of 26 NHS hospitals in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Men (aged ≥ 18 years) seeking further treatment, potentially 
including surgery, for bothersome LUTS. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 
unable to pass urine without a catheter, having a relevant neurological disease, 
currently undergoing treatment for prostate or bladder cancer, previously had 
prostate surgery, not medically fit for surgery and/or unwilling to be 
randomised.
INTERVENTIONS: Men were randomised to a care pathway based on non-invasive 
routine tests (control) or routine care plus invasive UDS (intervention arm).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was International Prostate Symptom 
Score (IPSS) at 18 months after randomisation and the key secondary outcome was 
rates of surgery. Additional secondary outcomes included adverse events (AEs), 
quality of life, urinary and sexual symptoms, UDS satisfaction, maximum urinary 
flow rate and cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: A total of 820 men were randomised (UDS, 427; routine care, 393). 
Sixty-seven men withdrew before 18 months and 11 died (unrelated to trial 
procedures). UDS was non-inferior to routine care for IPSS 18 months after 
randomisation, with a confidence interval (CI) within the margin of 1 point 
(-0.33, 95% CI -1.47 to 0.80). A lower surgery rate in the UDS arm was not found 
(38% and 36% for UDS and routine care, respectively), with overall rates lower 
than expected. AEs were similar between the arms at 43-44%. There were more 
cases of acute urinary retention in the routine care arm. Patient-reported 
outcomes for LUTS improved in both arms and satisfaction with UDS was high in 
men who received it. UDS was more expensive than routine care. From a secondary 
care perspective, UDS cost an additional £216 over an 18-month time horizon. 
Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were similar, with a QALY difference of 
0.006 in favour of UDS over 18 months. It was established that UDS was 
acceptable to patients, and valued by both patients and clinicians for its 
perceived additional insight into the cause and probable best treatment of LUTS.
LIMITATIONS: The trial met its predefined recruitment target, but surgery rates 
were lower than anticipated.
CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of UDS in the diagnostic tests results in a symptom 
outcome that is non-inferior to a routine care pathway, but does not affect 
surgical rates for treating BOO. Results do not support the routine use of UDS 
in men undergoing investigation of LUTS.
FUTURE WORK: Focus should be placed on indications for selective utilisation of 
UDS in individual cases and long-term outcomes of diagnosis and therapy.

Plain Language Summary: After hospital referral, men with bothersome lower 
urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are assessed with standard tests. These include 
measurement of urine flow rate, bladder diaries and questionnaires, including 
the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). UPSTREAM (Urodynamics for 
Prostate Surgery Trial; Randomised Evaluation of Assessment Methods) researched 
whether or not including an extra test, urodynamics (UDS), helps when 
considering treatment options. UDS is a more invasive test and measures pressure 
in the bladder to check whether or not the prostate is causing obstruction. It 
was presumed that, if there is no obstruction, surgery would not be offered, so 
that using UDS would reduce the number of prostate operations. Each man 
participating (820 in total) was assessed with the standard tests. Around half 
of them had no extra tests (the ‘routine care’ arm of the trial); the rest had 
the UDS tests (the ‘UDS’ arm). Men then went on to have treatment, which they 
chose having discussed their test results with a urologist. IPSS and other 
symptom scores were examined for each man 18 months after joining the trial. At 
18 months, surgery outcomes were known for 792 men and IPSS was known for 669 
men. We investigated if the two trial arms showed similar changes in the IPSS 
and if there were fewer operations done in the UDS arm. We identified similar 
reductions in the IPSS in both arms. However, UDS tests did not reduce the 
number of operations. Analysing all the costs, it was found that a pathway 
including UDS costs more than routine care. Interviews were conducted that 
showed that men found UDS acceptable, and that the additional information helped 
both the men and their doctors consider which treatment would be most 
appropriate. These results do not support the routine use of UDS in the 
assessment of every man considering prostate surgery for LUTS. Further 
exploration of the data may identify circumstances in which UDS could be 
helpful.

Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To examine how lifestyles and leisure activities are associated with 
cognitive health expectancy among older adults.
RESULTS: For young-old (aged 65), an absolute increase in life years without 
cognitive impairment was found among those with a healthy diet, engaging in 
mental activities and in social activities. For old-old (aged 85), an absolute 
increase was found for men engaging in physical activities besides those. 
Compared with counterparts in a high risk group, the young-old in a medium-low 
risk group had a smaller proportion of years without cognitive impairment. 
Old-old in a low risk group had a greater proportion.
CONCLUSION: Extra years of life gained by a healthy dietary pattern, mental 
activities, and social activities are free of cognitive impairment for both 
sexes across ages. The beneficial impact of individual and combined modifiable 
factors on cognitive health is most prominent in old-old.
METHODS: Data come from The Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, a 
population-based cohort study of 27,193 participants aged 65+ conducted between 
2002 and 2014. Smoking status, alcohol consumption, dietary pattern, marital 
status, physical, mental, social, and productive activities were assessed at 
baseline. Cognitive status was measured using the Chinese version of the MMSE.

Interleukin 15 Pharmacokinetics and Consumption by a Dynamic Cytokine Sink.

Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is crucial for the proliferation and survival of NK and 
CD8+ T memory cells, and of significant interest in immuno-oncology. Immune cell 
expansion requires continuous IL-15 exposure above a threshold concentration for 
an extended period. However, the short t1/2 of IL-15 makes this impossible to 
achieve after a single injection without a high Cmax and toxicities. The most 
effective way to deliver IL-15 is continuous intra-venous infusion, but this 
administration mode is impractical. Efforts have been devoted to developing 
IL-15 agonists which after a single injection maintain the cytokine in a narrow 
therapeutic window for a long period. Enigmatically, although the half-life 
extension technologies used often extend the half-life of a protein to 1 or more 
weeks, the modified IL-15 agonists studied usually have systemic elimination 
half-lives of only a few hours and rarely much longer than 1 day. These short 
half-lives-common to all circulating IL-15 agonists thus far reported-can be 
explained by a dynamic increase in clearance of the agonists that accompanies 
target immune cell proliferation. What is needed is an IL-15 agonist that is as 
effective as continuous intravenous infusion, but with the convenience and 
acceptance of single injections at 1-week or longer intervals.

Assessing the potential impacts of different land management practices helps to 
identify and implement sustainable watershed management measures. This study 
aims to assess a change in soil erosion rate under different land management 
practices in the Gilgel Abay watershed of the upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. 
The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model that was adapted to the 
Ethiopian highlands context was employed to estimate the rate of soil erosion. 
The impact of land management practices on soil erosion was estimated for three 
scenarios, which were baseline, intensive cultivation, and extensive cultivation 
scenarios. At the baseline scenario, the mean annual soil erosion was estimated 
at ~32.8 t ha-1yr-1, which is equivalent to a loss of ~13.66 Mt yr-1 from the 
entire watershed. While the rate of soil erosion reduced to ~11.3 t ha-1yr-1 
during the implementation of intensive cultivation management practice, which 
reduced the total soil loss in the watershed by 65%. On the other hand, under 
the extensive cultivation scenario, the mean annual soil erosion rate increased 
to ~34.4 t ha-1yr-1. The findings suggest that implementing agricultural 
intensification management practices can significantly reduce soil erosion in 
the watershed.

This paper investigated the relationships between the best-practice and the 
greatest possible life expectancies by means of gaps, lags and decomposition 
analyses, from 1950-1955 up to 2095-2100. The data were gathered from the United 
Nations' World Population Prospects (2017), containing abridged period life 
tables, for both sexes combined, for 201 countries or areas, which allowed the 
identification of low-mortality regions that are sometimes omitted in previous 
studies. It was observed that both best-practice and greatest possible life 
expectancies rose and are expected to continue to rise linearly in a very 
similar way. Moreover, the average gap between the best-practice and the 
greatest possible life expectancies was of about 1.14 years and the average lag 
was 7.59 years. Finally, it was found that major contributions to the gap are 
typically due to age groups beyond 65 years.

The current health pandemic that has plagued the global of which the global 
south-Nigeria is not insulated from is the premise for this empirical 
investigation. The present study relies on recent annual time-series data to 
conceptualize the hypothesized claim via Pesaran's Autoregressive distributed 
lag techniques. Empirical findings from the bounds test traces the long-run 
relationship between public health expenditure and economic growth over the 
study span. However, unlike previous studies, we introduce life expectancy and 
death rates in the model framework. Although health expenditure is not 
significant, empirical results show that a 1% increase in life expectancy and 
death rate increases and decreases economic growth by 3.85 and 1.84%, 
respectively. This suggests the need for Health Policymakers in Nigeria to 
implement active strategies that reduce the death rate, which is a blueprint for 
active engagement in the face of a global pandemic such as COVID-19.
