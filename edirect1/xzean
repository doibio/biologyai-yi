INTRODUCTION: Improved life expectancy and prenatal screening have changed the 
demographics of spina bifida (spinal dysraphism) which has presently become a 
disease of adulthood. Urinary disorders affect almost all patients with spinal 
dysraphism and are still the leading cause of mortality in these patients. The 
aim of this work was to establish recommendations for urological management that 
take into account the specificities of the spina bifida population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: National Diagnosis and Management Guidelines (PNDS) were 
drafted within the framework of the French Rare Diseases Plan at the initiative 
of the Centre de Référence Maladies Rares Spina Bifida - Dysraphismes of Rennes 
University Hospital. It is a collaborative work involving experts from different 
specialties, mainly urologists and rehabilitation physicians. We conducted a 
systematic search of the literature in French and English in the various fields 
covered by these recommendations in the MEDLINE database. In accordance with the 
methodology recommended by the authorities (Guide_methodologique_pnds.pdf, 
2006), proposed recommendations were drafted on the basis of this literature 
review and then submitted to a review group until a consensus was reached.
RESULTS: Bladder dysfunctions induced by spinal dysraphism are multiple and 
varied and evolve over time. Management must be individually adapted and take 
into account all the patient's problems, and is therefore necessarily 
multi-disciplinary. Self-catheterisation is the appropriate micturition method 
for more than half of the patients and must sometimes be combined with 
treatments aimed at suppressing any neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) or 
compliance alteration (anticholinergics, intra-detrusor botulinum toxin). Resort 
to surgery is sometimes necessary either after failure of non-invasive 
treatments (e.g. bladder augmentation in case of NDO resistant to 
pharmacological treatment), or as a first line treatment in the absence of other 
non-invasive alternatives (e.g. aponeurotic suburethral tape or artificial 
urinary sphincter for sphincter insufficiency; urinary diversion by ileal 
conduit if self-catheterisation is impossible).
CONCLUSION: Spinal dysraphism is a complex pathology with multiple neurological, 
orthopedic, gastrointestinal and urological involvement. The management of 
bladder and bowel dysfunctions must continue throughout the life of these 
patients and must be integrated into a multidisciplinary context.

BACKGROUND: Distal femoral resection knee arthroplasty is a limb salvage 
procedure. The impact of distal femoral resection arthroplasty on patient 
function and health status is unknown. The aim of this study was to report knee 
function, quality of life, knee pain, and living conditions after distal femoral 
resection knee arthroplasty for non-tumor indications.
METHODS: Of 52 patients (52 knees) undergoing distal femoral resection knee 
arthroplasty in a single institution between 2012 and 2021, 22 were excluded as 
3 patients had ≤90 days follow-up, 6 had died, and 13 declined or were unable to 
participate for unrelated reasons. Thus, 30 patients were included and 
interviewed by telephone in March 2021 (mean follow-up 3.5 years after surgery). 
Patient completed the Oxford Knee Score (0-48, 48 best), EQ-5D-5L, and the 
Copenhagen Knee ROM, and information on pain and living conditions was obtained.
RESULTS: The mean age was 67.9 years (SD 13.6), and 21 (70%) were female. Mean 
total Oxford Knee Score was 29.9 (SD 10.5), mean Copenhagen Knee ROM flexion was 
116° (SD 21.6), and mean extension was - 2° (SD10.1). Mobility aids were used by 
18 (60%) patients, i.e. a cane (30%), walker (26.7%) or wheelchair (3.3%). Mean 
EQ-5Dindex score was 0.70 (SD 0.22) and mean EQ-5D VAS score was 55.4 (SD 23.9). 
Nine (30%) patients used paracetamol or NSAID and 2 (6.7%) used opioids for knee 
pain. Mean VAS knee pain score was 1.30 (SD 2.2) at rest and 2.8 (SD 3.1) when 
walking. Most (90%) patients lived in their own home, with only 3 patients in 
nursing homes. Two-thirds (66.7%) required no home care, 5 (16.6%) received home 
care 1-2 times over 2 weeks, and 5 (16.6%) every day.
CONCLUSION: Distal femoral resection knee arthroplasty appears to be a viable 
treatment option for non-tumor indications. Acceptable patient outcomes were 
achieved in terms of functional status and quality of life, especially 
considering treatment alternatives such as femoral amputation.

Hip fractures are associated with significant healthcare costs. In frail 
institutionalized patients, the costs of nonoperative management are less than 
operative management with comparable short-term quality of life. Nonoperative 
management of hip fractures in patients at the end of life should be openly 
discussed with SDM.
PURPOSE: The aim was to describe healthcare use with associated costs and to 
determine cost-utility of nonoperative management (NOM) versus operative 
management (OM) of frail institutionalized older patients with a proximal 
femoral fracture.
METHODS: This study included institutionalized patients with a limited life 
expectancy aged ≥ 70 years who sustained a proximal femoral fracture in the 
Netherlands. Costs of hospital- and nursing home care were calculated. Quality 
adjusted life years (QALY) were calculated based on EuroQol-5D-5L utility scores 
at day 7, 14, and 30 and at 3 and 6 months. The incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) was calculated from a societal perspective.
RESULTS: Of the 172 enrolled patients, 88 (51%) patients opted for NOM and 84 
(49%) for OM. NOM was associated with lower healthcare costs at 6 months (NOM; 
€2425 (SD 1.030), OM; €9325 (SD 4242), p < 0.001). The main cost driver was 
hospital stay (NOM; €738 (SD 841) and OM; €3140 (SD 2636)). The ICER per QALY 
gained in the OM versus NOM was €76,912 and exceeded the threshold of €20,000 
per QALY. The gained QALY were minimal in the OM group in patients who died 
within 14- and 30-day post-injury, but OM resulted in more than triple the 
costs.
CONCLUSION: OM results in significant higher healthcare costs, mainly due to the 
length of hospital stay. For frail patients at the end of life, NOM of proximal 
femoral fractures should be openly discussed in SDM conversations due to the 
limited gain in QoL.

OBJECTIVE: Over the past 20 years, immunotherapy and targeted therapy (TT) have 
been extending the life expectancy and providing hope for a growing number of 
patients with advanced and metastatic cancer. However, the efficacy, side 
effects, and overall prognosis of these treatments are highly unpredictable. 
Recent research suggests that these patients may be experiencing significant 
uncertainty which impacts their functioning. This study reviewed the literature 
on the experiences of uncertainty for individuals with advanced or metastatic 
cancer patients who are receiving immunotherapy or TT.
METHOD: A systematic literature review was conducted. Data was extracted from 
studies by pairs of reviewers. Literature quality was appraised using the 
Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist. Following data extraction, thematic 
synthesis was used to summarize findings across studies and generate overarching 
themes.
RESULTS: Fifteen qualitative studies were included. Findings highlighted impacts 
of various sources of uncertainty (financial, emotional, social), unmet needs 
related to uncertainty (practical, informational, communication), and 
recommendations for the management of uncertainty. Clinical implications and 
study limitations were indicated.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings were situated within Mishel's Uncertainty in Illness 
Theory and the literature on supportive care for advanced cancer populations. 
Recommendations related to improving healthcare provider communication and 
balancing hope and expectations for treatment outcomes were highlighted. Further 
research is needed to investigate experiences of uncertainty in this population. 
Tailored interventions for uncertainty may be warranted.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is an inflammatory disease that may be 
complicated by abdominal pain, pancreatic dysfunction, nutritional deficiencies, 
and diminished bone density. Importantly, it is also associated with a 
substantially impaired quality of life and reduced life expectancy. This may 
partly be explained by suboptimal treatment, in particular the long-term 
management of this chronic condition, despite several national and international 
guidelines. Standardization of care through a structured implementation of 
guideline recommendations may improve the level of care and lower the 
complication rate of these patients. Therefore, the aim of the present study is 
to evaluate to what extent patient education and standardization of care, 
through the implementation of an evidence-based integrated management algorithm, 
improve quality of life and reduce pain severity in patients with CP.
METHODS: The COMBO trial is a nationwide stepped-wedge cluster-randomized 
controlled trial. In a stepwise manner, 26 centers, clustered in 6 health 
regions, cross-over from current practice to care according to an evidence-based 
integrated management algorithm. During the current practice phase, study 
participants are recruited and followed longitudinally through questionnaires. 
Individual patients contribute data to both study periods. Co-primary study 
endpoints consist of quality of life (assessed by the PANQOLI score) and level 
of pain (assessed by the Izbicki questionnaire). Secondary outcomes include 
process measure outcomes, clinical outcomes (e.g., pancreatic function, 
nutritional status, bone health, interventions, medication use), utilization of 
healthcare resources, (in) direct costs, and the level of social participation. 
Standard follow-up is 35 months from the start of the trial.
DISCUSSION: This is the first stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial 
to investigate whether an evidence-based integrated therapeutic approach 
improves quality of life and pain severity in patients with CP as compared with 
current practice.

Transitions Between Mild Cognitive Impairment, Dementia, and Mortality: The 
Importance of Olfaction.

BACKGROUND: The existing literature suggests that impaired olfaction may be an 
early marker for cognitive decline. Tracking the earliest stages of the 
progression to dementia is paramount, and yet the importance of olfactory 
ability throughout cognitive states and death remains unclear.
METHODS: Drawing data from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (N = 1 501; 74% 
female), olfactory ability was assessed using the Brief Smell Identification 
Test (range = 0-16), while cognitive states (unimpaired, mild cognitive 
impairment [MCI], and dementia) were determined using a 3-step 
neuropsychological diagnostic protocol at up to 15 annual occasions. Multistate 
survival models simultaneously estimated the association of olfactory ability on 
transitions through cognitive states and death, while multinomial regression 
models estimated cognitively unimpaired and total life expectancies.
RESULTS: Higher olfactory scores were associated with a reduced risk of 
transitioning from unimpaired cognition to MCI (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 0.82-0.88) and from MCI to dementia (HR = 0.89, 95% 
CI = 0.86-0.93), indicating that 1-unit increase in olfactory scores was 
associated with an approximate 14% and 11% reduction in risk, respectively. 
Additionally, higher olfactory scores were associated with a greater likelihood 
of transitioning backward from MCI to unimpaired cognition (HR = 1.07, 95% 
CI = 1.02-1.12). Furthermore, higher baseline olfactory scores were associated 
with more years of longevity without cognitive impairment. However, olfaction 
was not associated with the transition to death when accounting for transitions 
through cognitive states.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that higher olfactory identification scores are 
associated with a decreased risk of transitioning to impaired cognitive states 
and that associations between olfaction and mortality may occur primarily 
through the pathway of neurodegeneration.

The research, which was designed as a "pre- and post-single group" study, 
included patients with lower-limb amputation and aimed to evaluate the 
effectiveness of self-directed physical-strength training and cardiovascular 
exercise using a novel digital healthcare management service three times a week 
for 12 weeks. Muscle strength, thigh circumference, lipid profile and glycated 
hemoglobin levels, pulmonary function, quality of life, and physical activity 
level were evaluated before and after the intervention, while satisfaction was 
measured after the study. Among the 14 included patients, the proportion of 
adherence to the physical-strength training and physical-strengthening activity 
were 85.2% and 75.8%, respectively. The level of satisfaction with the digital 
healthcare management system was high. Significant changes were observed in the 
muscle-strength tests (dominant grip power and muscle strength of knee flexion 
and extension of the intact side), thigh circumference, and glycated hemoglobin 
levels. Further, the quality-of-life score showed improvement, although without 
significant differences. Individualized exercise management using the novel 
digital healthcare management system for lower-limb amputees could induce 
interest in self-care and promote physical activity and healthy behavior. 
Through this effect, we can expect a reduction in the incidence of 
cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and severe injuries 
from falling.

With the recent advances in medicine, human life expectancy is increasing; 
however, the extra years of life are not necessarily spent in good health or 
free from disability, resulting in a significantly higher incidence of 
age-associated pathologies. Among these disorders, neurodegenerative diseases 
have a significant impact. To this end, the presence of the protective 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents a formidable obstacle to the delivery of 
therapeutics. Thus, this makes it imperative to define strategies to bypass the 
BBB in order to successfully target the brain with the appropriate drugs. It has 
been demonstrated that targeting the BBB by ultrasound (US) can transiently make 
this anatomical barrier permeable and in so doing, allow the delivery of 
therapeutics. Thus, our aim was to carry out an in depth in vitro molecular and 
morphological study on the effects of US treatment on the BBB. The rat brain 
endothelial (RBE4) cell line was challenged with exposure to 12 MHz diagnostic 
US treatment for 10, 20, and 30 min. Cell viability assays, Western blotting 
analysis on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and oxidative stress marker 
evaluation were then performed, along with cytological and immunofluorescence 
staining, in order to evaluate the effects of US on the intercellular spaces and 
tight junction distribution of the brain endothelial cells. We observed that the 
US treatment exerted no toxic effects on either RBE4 cell viability or the 
upregulation/dislocation of the ER and oxidative stress marker (GRP78 and 
cytochrome C, respectively). Further, we observed that the application of US 
induced an increase in the intercellular spaces, as shown by Papanicolaou 
staining, mainly due to the altered distribution of the tight junction protein 
zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). This latter US-dependent effect was transient and 
disappeared 20 min after the removal of the stimulus. In conclusion, our results 
show that US induces a transient alteration of the BBB, without altering the 
intracellular signaling pathways such as the ER and oxidative stress that could 
potentially be toxic for endothelial cells. These results suggested that US

Approximately 20% of breast cancers (BC) overexpress human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2). This subtype of BC is a clinically and biologically 
heterogeneous disease that was associated with an increased risk for the 
development of systemic and brain metastases and poor overall survival before 
anti-HER2 therapies were developed. The standard of care was dual blockade with 
trastuzumab and pertuzumab as first-line followed by TDM-1 as second-line. 
However, with the advent of new HER2-targeted monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors and antibody- drug conjugates, the clinical outcomes of 
patients with HER2-positive BC have changed dramatically in recent years, 
leading to a paradigm shift in the treatment of the disease. Notably, the 
development of new-generation ADCs has led to unprecedented results compared 
with T-DM1, currently establishing trastuzumab deruxtecan as a new standard of 
care in second-line. Despite the widespread availability of HER2-targeted 
therapies, patients with HER2-positive BC continue to face the challenges of 
disease progression, treatment resistance, and brain metastases. Response rate 
and overall life expectancy decrease with each additional line of treatment, and 
tumor heterogeneity remains an issue. In this review, we update the new-targeted 
therapeutic options for HER2-positive BC and highlight the future perspectives 
of treatment in this setting.

In this review, we summarize up-to-date reports with five-year observation after 
colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Five-year cause-specific 
survival rates ranged from 98.6 to 100%. The local recurrence rates ranged from 
1.1 to 2.2% in complete resection and 7.5 to 25.0% in incomplete resection. 
Incomplete resection was a risk factor for local recurrence. In non-curative 
ESD, five-year cause-specific survival rates ranged from 93.8 to 100% with 
additional surgery, and 92.7 to 99.1% without surgery. The choice of additional 
surgery should be based on the individual patient's age, concomitant diseases, 
wishes, life expectancy, and the risk of lymph node metastasis. The metachronous 
cancer rates ranged from 0.22 to 1.1%. Both local recurrence and metachronous 
tumors should be checked with a follow-up colonoscopy after ESD.

People with severe mental illness (SMI) are often in poor physical health, 
resulting in higher mortality and reduced life expectancy compared to the 
general population. Although eating habits are one of the main predictors of 
physical health, few studies assess the nutritional status and eating behavior 
of people with SMI. The aim of this study was to examine the nutritional status 
and risk of malnutrition in people with SMI who were in need of intensive 
psychiatric treatment. The cross-sectional study included 65 inpatients and 67 
outpatients with psychotic or depressive disorders from the Psychiatric Hospital 
of the University of Zurich. Patients' assessments at admission included 
anthropometric measurements, such as weight and height, and interview data 
including severity of symptoms and functioning (SCL-K-9, PHQ-D, CGI, m-GAF), 
personal and medical data, nutrition risk screening tools (adapted NRS, MNA-SF), 
and laboratory values. The results showed that 32% of the inpatients and 34% of 
the outpatients were at risk of malnutrition, which was associated with higher 
levels of psychiatric symptoms and lower levels of functioning. Regardless, the 
body mass index (BMI) was overweight in both groups (mean BMIinpatients = 25.3, 
mean BMIoutpatients = 27.9). These results indicate that a substantial 
proportion of psychiatric patients seems to be at risk of malnutrition, despite 
most being overweight, and hence they might benefit from nutritional support 
during their psychiatric treatment. Moreover, nutritional risk screening tools 
specifically developed for the mental healthcare setting are needed.

Life expectancy in Spain has increased and older people need more health care to 
improve their quality of life. The high demands of the population sometimes 
collapse health services, making them insufficient to cover their needs, which 
leads to the development of “non-professional caregivers”. These caregivers have 
suffered musculoskeletal injuries of the cervical spine and shoulders and should 
be guided and assessed on ergonomics, biomechanics, or kinesiotherapy. However, 
there are no interventions to help them care for themselves. This study presents 
the application of a physical exercise programme to prevent these disorders in 
women caregivers of dependent patients. It consists of a randomised controlled 
clinical trial with two groups: both received a family caregiver care programme, 
and the intervention group also received a physical therapeutic exercise 
programme for 12 weeks. A total of 62 caregivers completed the study, who were 
mostly daughters or wives of dependents. Of these, 70.97% presented a “moderate” 
pain intensity and a cervical disability of 13.72 ± 7.64 points in the NDI 
questionnaire in the initial evaluation. In the intervention group of 
caregivers, there was a significant decrease in the pain intensity and a 
significant increase (p < 0.05) in all cervical joint amplitude movements. 
Caregivers present a high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders. The physical 
exercise programme was effective in reducing the intensity of pain, lumbar 
disability, and cervical disability of the family caregivers.

Health system decision-makers need to understand the value of new technology to 
make "value for money" decisions. Typically, narrow definitions of value are 
used. This paper reports on a Canadian Citizens' Jury which was convened to 
elicit those aspects of value that are important to the public. The criteria 
used by the public to determine value included those related to the patient, 
those directly related to caregivers and those directly created for society. 
Their choices were not binary (e.g., cost vs. health gained), but rather 
involved multiple factors (e.g., with respect to patient factors: disease 
severity, health gained with the drug, existence of alternatives, life 
expectancy, patient age and affordability). Overall, Jurors prioritized funding 
treatments for ultra-rare disease populations when the treatment offered 
significant improvements in health and quality of life, and when the 
pre-treatment health state was considered extremely poor. The prevalence of the 
disease by itself was not a factor in the choices. Some of the findings differ 
from previous work, which use survey methods. In our Citizens' Jury, Jurors were 
able to become more familiar with the question at hand and were exposed to a 
broad and balanced collection of viewpoints before and throughout engaging in 
the exercises. This deliberative approach allows for a more nuanced approach to 
understanding value.

BACKGROUND: People with a severe mental illness (pSMI) often have comorbid 
physical health problems, resulting in a lower life expectancy compared to the 
global population. In Belgium, it remains unclear how to approach health 
disparities in pSMI in a community setting. This study explores the perspectives 
of both care professionals and patients on physical healthcare in Belgian 
community mental services, aiming to identify good practices, barriers and 
points of improvement.
METHODS: An exploratory qualitative design that used a semi-structured focus 
group interview with physicians combined with individual face-to-face interviews 
with physicians, mental health professionals and patients.
RESULTS: We identified care professional-, patient-related and organizational 
factors, as well as points of improvement. The identified themes linked to care 
professionals were communication, task distribution, knowledge, time and 
stigmatization. The co-location of services was the main theme on an 
organizational level.
CONCLUSIONS: As community-based mental health services in Belgium emerged in the 
past decade, addressing physical health in pSMI is still challenging. Our 
findings suggest that there is a need for improvement in the current healthcare 
provision. Multidisciplinary guidelines, shared patient records, enlarging 
nurses' tasks, providing financial incentives and a structural integration of 
primary and psychiatric care were perceived as major points of improvement to 
the current Belgian healthcare organization.

Small therapeutic proteins are receiving increased interest as therapeutic 
drugs; however, their clinical success has been limited due to their rapid 
elimination. Here, we report a half-life extension strategy via strategy via red 
blood cell red blood cell (RBC) hitch-hiking. This manuscript details the 
development and characterization of novel anti-RBC single-domain antibodies 
(sdAbs), their genetic fusion to therapeutic antibody fragments (TAF) as 
bispecific fusion constructs, and their influence on TAF pharmacokinetics and 
biodistribution. Several sdAbs specific to the band 3 antigen were generated via 
phage-display technology. Binding affinity to RBCs was assessed via flow 
cytometry. Affinity maturation via random mutagenesis was carried out to improve 
the binding affinity of the sdAbs. Bi-specific constructs were generated by 
fusing the anti-RBC sdAbs with anti-tissue necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) TAF via 
the use of a glycine-serine flexible linker, and assessments for binding were 
performed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry. 
Pharmacokinetics of anti-RBC sdAbs and fusion constructs were evaluated 
following intravenous bolus dosing in mice at a 1 mg/kg dose. Two RBC-binding 
sdAbs, RB12 and RE8, were developed. These two clones showed high binding 
affinity to human RBC with an estimated KD of 17.7 nM and 23.6 nM and low 
binding affinity to mouse RBC with an estimated KD of 335 nM and 528 nM for RB12 
and RE8, respectively. Two derivative sdAbs, RMA1, and RMC1, with higher 
affinities against mouse RBC, were generated via affinity maturation (KD of 66.9 
nM and 30.3 nM, respectively). Pharmacokinetic investigations in mice 
demonstrated prolonged circulation half-life of an anti-RBC-TNF-α bispecific 
construct (75 h) compared to a non-RBC binding control (1.3 h). In summary, the 
developed anti-RBC sdAbs and fusion constructs have demonstrated high affinity 
in vitro, and sufficient half-life extension in vivo.

Edible films and coatings are a current and future food packaging trend. In the 
food and envi-ronmental sectors, there is a growing need to understand the role 
of edible packaging and sus-tainability. Gums are polysaccharides of natural 
origin that are frequently utilized as thickeners, clarifying agents, gelling 
agents, emulsifiers, and stabilizers in the food sector. Gums come in a variety 
of forms, including seed gums, mucilage gums, exudate gums, and so on. As a 
biodegradable and sustainable alternative to petrochemical-based film and 
coatings, gums could be a promising option. Natural plant gum-based edible 
packaging helps to ensure extension of shelf-life of fresh and processed foods 
while also reducing microbiological alteration and/or oxidation processes. In 
this review, the possible applications of gum-based polymers and their 
functional properties in development of edible films and coatings, were 
comprehensively dis-cussed. In the future, technology for developing natural 
gum-based edible films and coatings might be applied commercially to improve 
shelf life and preserve the quality of foods.

The sirtuin system consists of seven highly conserved regulatory enzymes 
responsible for metabolism, antioxidant protection, and cell cycle regulation. 
The great interest in sirtuins is associated with the potential impact on life 
extension. This article summarizes the latest research on the activity of 
sirtuins and their role in the aging process. The effects of compounds that 
modulate the activity of sirtuins were discussed, and in numerous studies, their 
effectiveness was demonstrated. Attention was paid to the role of a caloric 
restriction and the risks associated with the influence of careless sirtuin 
modulation on the organism. It has been shown that low modulators' 
bioavailability/retention time is a crucial problem for optimal regulation of 
the studied pathways. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the modulator 
structure and potential reactivity with sirtuins in silico studies should 
precede in vitro and in vivo experiments. The latest achievements in 
nanobiotechnology make it possible to create promising molecules, but many of 
them remain in the sphere of plans and concepts. It seems that solving the 
mystery of longevity will have to wait for new scientific discoveries.

Republic of Korea.

This study aimed to analyze the survival and functional outcome after surgery in 
spinal metastasis patients with a short life expectancy and to compare the 
baseline characteristics based on 3-month survival. A total of 492 surgical 
treatment cases with a preoperative revised Tokuhashi score ≤ 8were reviewed. 
Median survival was calculated and Kaplan−Meier analysis was used to analyze the 
survival rates at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. The surgical 
period was divided into three time frames to examine the time trends. For the 
functional outcome, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 
(ECOG-PS) was analyzed. This study categorized subjects based on 3-month 
survival and compared the baseline characteristics. The median overall survival 
was 10.6 months. The 2013−2020 period showed a significantly better median 
survival than the other two periods (p < 0.001). Lung and kidney cancers showed 
a significant survival improvement in 2013−2020 (p < 0.001). Patients with 
ECOG-PS ≤ 2 increased from 37.4% preoperatively to 63.7% postoperatively (p < 
0.001). There were significantly more cases of preoperative favorable 
performance status, slow and moderate growth cancers, and chemotherapy after 
surgery in the survival ≥3 months group. Depending on the type of primary 
cancer, surgery can be considered even in spinal metastasis patients with a 
short life expectancy, particularly those with a good performance status.

Mobocertinib, an oral, first-in-class epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor selective for EGFR exon 20 insertions (ex20ins), 
achieved durable responses in adults with previously treated EGFR ex20ins+ 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) in the EXCLAIM extension cohort 
of a phase 1/2 study (N = 96; NCT02716116). We assessed patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs) with mobocertinib 160 mg once daily (28-day cycles) in EXCLAIM 
(N = 90) with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Core Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) v3.0, lung cancer module 
(QLQ-LC13), EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, and selected 
PRO Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) 
questionnaire. Median treatment duration was 6.8 (range, 0.0-18.8) months 
(median follow-up: 13.0 [0.7-18.8] months; data cutoff: 1 November 2020). 
Clinically meaningful improvements in lung cancer symptoms measured by EORTC 
QLQ-LC13 were observed for dyspnea (54.4% of patients), cough (46.7%), and chest 
pain (38.9%), evident at cycle 2 and throughout treatment (least-squares mean 
[LSM] changes from baseline: dyspnea, -3.2 [p = 0.019]; cough, -9.3 [p < 0.001]; 
chest pain, -8.2 [p < 0.001]). EORTC QLQ-C30 results indicated no statistically 
significant changes in global health status/quality of life (LSM change from 
baseline: -1.8 [p = 0.235]). On symptom scores, significant worsening from 
baseline was observed for diarrhea (LSM change from baseline: +34.1; p < 0.001) 
and appetite loss (+6.6; p = 0.004), while improvements were observed for 
dyspnea (LSM change from baseline: -5.1 [p = 0.002]), insomnia (-6.5 [p = 
0.001]), and constipation (-5.7 [p < 0.001]). EQ-5D-5L health status was 
maintained. Common PRO-CTCAE symptoms were diarrhea, dry skin, rash, and 
decreased appetite (mostly low grade); in the first 24 weeks of treatment, 64.4% 
of patients had worsening diarrhea frequency and 67.8% had worsening dry skin
