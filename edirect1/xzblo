information regulator 2 (Sir2) and its mammalian orthologue, Sirt1, in survival 
and life extension during energy deprivation, we hypothesised that enhancing its 
activity may reduce the insensible energy loss engendered by hyperglycaemia and 
glycosuria.
METHODS: At 8 weeks of age, db/db and db/m mice were randomised to receive the 
SIRT1 activator SRT3025 milled in chow (3.18 g/kg) or regular chow and followed 
for a further 12 weeks.
RESULTS: When compared with vehicle, SIRT1 activation greatly improved glycaemic 
control, augmented plasma insulin concentrations, increased pancreatic islet 
beta cell mass and elevated hepatic expression of the beta cell growth factor, 
betatrophin in db/db mice. Despite the dramatic reduction in hyperglycaemia, 
db/db mice displayed worsening insulin resistance, diminished physical activity 
and further weight gain. These findings along with reduced food intake and 
reduction in body temperature resembled torpor and hibernation. By contrast, 
SIRT1 activation conferred only minimal changes in non-diabetic db/m mice.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: While reducing hyperglycaemia and promoting beta 
cell expansion, enhancing the activity of SIRT1 facilitates a phenotypic change 
in a db/db mouse model of diabetes to one that more closely resembles the 
physiological state of torpor or hibernation.

BACKGROUND: Deprivation-specific life tables have been in use for some time, but 
health outcomes are also known to vary by ethnicity over and above deprivation. 
The mortality experiences of ethnic groups are little studied in the UK, 
however, because ethnicity is not captured on death certificates.
METHODS: Population data for all Output Areas (OAs) in England and Wales were 
stratified by age-group, sex and ethnic proportion, and matched to the deaths 
counts in that OA from 2000 to 2002. We modelled the relationship between 
mortality, age, deprivation and ethnic proportion. We predicted mortality rates 
for an area that contained the maximum proportion of each ethnic group reported 
in any area in England and Wales, using a generalised linear model with a 
Poisson distribution adjusted for deprivation.
RESULTS: After adjustment, Asian and White life expectancies between 1 and 
80 years were very similar. Black men and women had lower life expectancies: men 
by 4 years and women by around 1.5 years. The Asian population had the lowest 
mortality of all groups over age 45 in women and over 50 in men, whereas the 
Black population had the highest rates throughout, except in girls under 15.
CONCLUSIONS: We adopted a novel ecological method of constructing 
ethnic-majority life tables, adjusted for deprivation. There is still diversity 
within these three broad ethnic groups, but our data show important residual 
differences in mortality for Black men and women. These ethnic life tables can 
be used to inform public health planning and correctly account for background 
mortality in ethnic subgroups of the population.

Background Despite inherent differences between the cytoskeletal networks of 
malignant and normal cells, and the clinical antineoplastic activity of 
microtubule-directed agents, there has yet to be a microfilament-directed agent 
approved for clinical use. One of the most studied microfilament-directed agents 
has been cytochalasin B, a mycogenic toxin known to disrupt the formation of 
actin polymers. Therefore, this study sought to expand on our previous work with 
the microfilament-directed agent, along with other less studied cytochalasin 
congeners. Materials and Methods We determined whether cytochalasin B exerted 
significant cytotoxic effects in vitro on adherent M109 lung carcinoma and 
B16BL6 and B16F10 murine melanomas, or on suspension P388/ADR murine leukemia 
cells. We also examined whether cytochalasin B, its reduced congener 21, 
22-dihydrocytochalasin B (DiHCB), or cytochalasin D could synergize with 
doxorubicin (ADR) against ADR-resistant P388/ADR leukemia cells, and produce 
significant cytotoxicity in vitro. For in vivo characterization, cytochalasins B 
and D were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to Balb/c mice challenged with 
drug sensitive P388-S or multidrug resistant P388/ADR leukemias. Results 
Cytochalasin B demonstrated higher cytotoxicity against adherent lung carcinoma 
and melanoma cells than against suspension P388/ADR leukemia cells, as assessed 
by comparative effects on cell growth, and IC₅₀ and IC₈₀ values. Isobolographic 
analysis indicated that both cytochalasin B and DiHCB demonstrate considerable 
drug synergy with ADR against ADR-resistant P388/ADR leukemia, while 
cytochalasin D exhibits only additivity with ADR against the same cell line. In 
vivo, cytochalasins B and D substantially increased the life expectancy of mice 
challenged with P388/S and P388/ADR leukemias, and in some cases, produced 
long-term survival. Conclusion Taken together, it appears that cytochalasins 
have unique antineoplastic activity that could potentiate a novel class of 
chemotherapeutic agents.

An accumulated activity effective index for promoting physical activity: a 
design and development study in a mobile and pervasive health context.

Liu CT(1), Chan CT.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biomedical Engineering, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, 
Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: Increased physical activity has become a principal personal health 
goal worldwide because sufficient physical activity can reduce the risk of many 
adverse conditions. Motivating individuals to increase their levels of physical 
activity can increase life expectancy and contribute to a healthy life. Sharing 
and comparison of physical activity information by using the Internet, with 
fewer privacy concerns, might also help encourage people to promote and maintain 
sufficient physical activity. To promote and manage physical activity, an 
accumulated activity effective index (AAEI) is proposed in this paper.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the AAEI design is to maintain and promote physical 
activity. The public can easily accept a clear indicator that reveals the 
current status of physical activity. The AAEI is not only an assessment and 
tracking tool for personal physical activity, but is also useful for goal 
setting and for sharing content with the Internet community.
METHODS: The AAEI is derived from input in the form of accumulated physical 
activity, and evaluates the status of physical activities and days spent 
exercising. The term AAEI(t1,t2) is an index of the accumulated physical 
activity in the time interval (t1,t2), where the base unit of time is the day. 
The AAEI is determined according to accumulated physical activity and is 
adjusted using the previous status of physical activity. The previous status of 
physical activity is estimated according to the number of days spent exercising 
and the accumulated physical activity that has been performed. An analysis of 
the AAEI performance was conducted using a simulation model and a real-world 
trial with 2 participants.
RESULTS: The AAEI increased as the physical activity and days spent exercising 
accumulated. Conversely, the AAEI decreased with lack of physical activity and 
increased resting days. In simulation, the shape of the AAEI line indicated 
different types of exercise. The moving average AAEI represented long-term 
exercise. In the real-world trial, the AAEI confirmed that the simulation 
results were comparable to actual conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: The AAEI proposed in this paper is a method that can be used to 
evaluate the status of a person's physical activity. The AAEI is a simple 
numeric indication that is estimated by analyzing accumulated physical activity 
and the average number of days spent exercising. The AAEI is suitable for 
tracking personal physical activity, reminding the user of achievement goals, 
and allows data sharing by using the Internet. The results have demonstrated 
that the AAEI is a useful tool for physical activity management.

Strain DCY56(T) was isolated from a soil sample taken from a ginseng field. The 
strain was Gram-reaction positive, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative, aerobic 
and non-motile. Phylogenetic analysis, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, 
indicated that strain DCY56(T) belonged to the genus Microbacterium. The closest 
relatives were Microbacterium azadirachtae AI-S262(T), Microbacterium aerolatum 
V-73(T) and Microbacterium phyllosphaerae DSM 13468(T) (98.0 %, 98.0 % and 
97.5 % gene sequence similarity, respectively). The G+C content of the genomic 
DNA of strain DCY56(T) was 68.5 mol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness values between 
strain DCY56(T) and the most closely related type strains were lower than 36 %. 
The major polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and an 
unidentified glycolipid. The predominant fatty acids contained iso-C16 : 0, 
anteiso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C17 : 0. The menaquinones were MK-12 and MK-13. The 
diagnostic diamino acid of strain DCY56(T) was ornithine. The dominant 
whole-cell sugars were glucose, rhamnose and ribose. The results of the 
genotypic analysis, in combination with chemotaxonomic and physiological data, 
demonstrate that strain DCY56(T) represents a novel species within the genus 
Microbacterium, for which the name Microbacterium panaciterrae sp. nov. is 
proposed. The type strain is DCY56(T) ( = KCTC 19884(T) = JCM 17839(T)).

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of low to 
moderate temperatures on gluten functionality and gluten protein composition. 
Four spring wheat cultivars were grown in climate chambers with three 
temperature regimes (day/night temperatures of 13/10, 18/15 and 23/20 °C) during 
grain filling.
RESULTS: The temperature strongly influenced grain weight and protein content. 
Gluten quality measured by maximum resistance to extension (Rmax ) was highest 
in three cultivars grown at 13 °C. Rmax was positively correlated with the 
proportion of sodium dodecyl sulfate-unextractable polymeric proteins (%UPP). 
The proportions of ω-gliadins and D-type low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits 
(LMW-GS) increased and the proportions of α- and γ-gliadins and B-type LMW-GS 
decreased with higher temperature, while the proportion of high-molecular-weight 
glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) was constant between temperatures. The cultivar 
Berserk had strong and constant Rmax between the different temperatures.
CONCLUSION: Constant low temperature, even as low as 13 °C, had no negative 
effects on gluten quality. The observed variation in Rmax related to temperature 
could be explained more by %UPP than by changes in the proportions of HMW-GS or 
other gluten proteins. The four cultivars responded differently to temperature, 
as gluten from Berserk was stronger and more stable over a wide range of 
temperatures.

Hemophilia A (HA) is the most frequent inheritable defect of the coagulation 
proteins. The current standard of care for patients with HA is prophylactic 
factor infusion, which is comprised of regular (2-3 times per week) intravenous 
infusions of recombinant or plasma-derived FVIII to maintain hemostasis. While 
this treatment has greatly increased the quality of life and lengthened the life 
expectancy for many HA patients, its high cost, the need for lifelong infusions, 
and the fact that it is unavailable to roughly 75% of the world's HA patients 
make this type of treatment far from ideal. In addition, this lifesaving therapy 
suffers from a high risk of treatment failure due to immune response to the 
infused FVIII. There is thus a need for novel treatments, such as those using 
stem cells and/or gene therapy, which have the potential to mediate long-term 
correction or permanent cure following a single intervention. In the present 
review, we discuss the clinical feasibility and unique advantages that an in 
utero approach to treating HA could offer, placing special emphasis on a new 
sheep model of HA we have developed and on the use of mesenchymal stromal cells 
(MSC) as cellular vehicles for delivering the FVIII gene.

deficiencies - the effect of processing conditions on product safety and 
efficacy.

Early preparations of immunoglobulin (Ig) manufactured from human plasma by 
ethanol (Cohn) fractionation were limited in their usefulness for substitution 
therapy in patients with primary antibody deficiencies (PAD), as Ig aggregates 
formed during manufacture resulted in severe systemic reactions in patients when 
given intravenously. Developments in manufacturing technology obviated this 
problem through the capacity to produce concentrated solutions of intact 
monomeric Ig, revolutionizing PAD treatment and improving patient life 
expectancy and quality of life. As the need for Ig has grown, manufacturers have 
refined further manufacturing technologies to improve yield from plasma and 
produce therapies, which are easier and less expensive to deliver. This has led 
to the substitution, partly or wholly, of ethanol precipitation by other 
techniques such as chromatography, and has also stimulated the production of 
highly concentrated solutions capable of rapid infusion. Ig products have been 
associated, since their inception, with certain adverse events, including 
infectious disease transmission, hemolysis, and thromboembolism. The 
introduction of standardized manufacturing processes and dedicated pathogen 
elimination steps has removed the risk of infectious disease, and the focus of 
attention has shifted to other problems, which appear to have increased over the 
past 5 years. These include hemolysis and thromboembolism, both the cause for 
substantial concern and the subject of recent regulatory scrutiny and actions. 
We review the development of manufacturing technology and the emerging evidence 
that changes for the optimization of yield and convenience has contributed to 
the recent incidents in certain adverse events. Industry measures under 
development will be discussed in terms of their potential to improve safety and 
optimize care for patients with PAD.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incremental cost effectiveness of two dose human 
papillomavirus vaccination and of additionally giving a third dose.
DESIGN: Cost effectiveness study based on a transmission dynamic model of human 
papillomavirus vaccination. Two dose schedules for bivalent or quadrivalent 
human papillomavirus vaccines were assumed to provide 10, 20, or 30 years' 
vaccine type protection and cross protection or lifelong vaccine type protection 
without cross protection. Three dose schedules were assumed to give lifelong 
vaccine type and cross protection.
SETTING: United Kingdom.
POPULATION: Males and females aged 12-74 years.
INTERVENTIONS: No, two, or three doses of human papillomavirus vaccine given 
routinely to 12 year old girls, with an initial catch-up campaign to 18 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Costs (from the healthcare provider's perspective), health 
related utilities, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: Giving at least two doses of vaccine seems to be highly cost effective 
across the entire range of scenarios considered at the quadrivalent vaccine list 
price of £86.50 (€109.23; $136.00) per dose. If two doses give only 10 years' 
protection but adding a third dose extends this to lifetime protection, then the 
third dose also seems to be cost effective at £86.50 per dose (median 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio £17,000, interquartile range 
£11,700-£25,800). If two doses protect for more than 20 years, then the third 
dose will have to be priced substantially lower (median threshold price £31, 
interquartile range £28-£35) to be cost effective. Results are similar for a 
bivalent vaccine priced at £80.50 per dose and when the same scenarios are 
explored by parameterising a Canadian model (HPV-ADVISE) with economic data from 
the United Kingdom.
CONCLUSIONS: Two dose human papillomavirus vaccine schedules are likely to be 
the most cost effective option provided protection lasts for at least 20 years. 
As the precise duration of two dose schedules may not be known for decades, 
cohorts given two doses should be closely monitored.

BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy has led to an increase in diagnoses of 
chronic illness in people with an intellectual disability; despite this 
increase, research about the psychological impact is rare. This review explored 
the psychosocial experiences of chronic illness in adults with an intellectual 
disability, revealing potential predictors and moderators of these experiences.
METHODS: Online databases were systematically searched to identify relevant 
literature, using predefined inclusion criteria. Of the 25,058 titles initially 
identified, 4 were included, that is, those collecting data on people with an 
intellectual disability and diagnosed with cancer (n = 2), chronic pain (n = 1) 
and diabetes (n = 1).
RESULTS: Narrative synthesis of the data identified six themes, namely, (1) 
delayed diagnosis, (2) information, communication and understanding, (3) 
negative psychological consequences, (4) negative physical consequences, (5) 
social perception and (6) social support.
CONCLUSIONS: There are unmet needs within this population, including a lack of 
assistance in understanding their illness. A substantial gap in the literature 
should be addressed through further empirical work.

BACKGROUND: To describe the treatment of prostate cancer patients according to 
life expectancy, risk and comorbidity, to examine the degree to which Clinical 
Practice Guidelines (CPG) are followed, and to register secondary effects after 
one year.
METHODS: Retrospective study of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in a 
hospital in 2011. Socio-demographic variables, as well as comorbidity (Charlson 
index), tumor characteristics, treatments and secondary effects were collected. 
A bivariate analysis was performed using the Chi square test.
RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen patients were identified. Life expectancy was 
higher than 10 years in 92.1%; 50% had low comorbidity, 36% medium and 14% high. 
Surgery was performed in 56.2%, more often in patients with intermediate-risk 
and low comorbidity; radiotherapy in 13.2%, more often in patients with 
high-risk and low comorbidity; hormonal therapy in 21.9%, more often in patients 
with medium comorbidity, and deferred treatment in 12.3%. CPG recommendations 
were not followed in 38.6%, especially in high-risk patients, 58.1%. Regarding 
adverse effects, 70% of patients treated with surgery presented urinary 
incontinence, and 48.3% erectile dysfunction. On the other hand, 17.15% of 
patients treated with hormonal therapy presented a cardiovascular disease, and 
32.5% worsening of a cardiovascular risk factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of prostate cancer takes into account risk and 
comorbidity, but there could be improvement in following CPG guidelines, 
especially in elderly patients. It is advisable to develop preventive strategies 
to avoid cardiovascular effects in patients with hormonal therapy.

The CD40/CD154 co-stimulatory pathway is crucial in alloimmune response. We 
developed a novel small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery system with a poly-dA 
extension at the 5'-end of the siRNA sense strand that was stably incorporated 
into 1,3-β-glucan (schizophyllan, SPG). This was captured and incorporated into 
dendritic cells (DCs) through its receptor, Dectin-1, specifically silencing 
CD40 genes (siCD40) to exert immunoregulatory activity. siCD40/SPG-treated CBA 
mice permanently accepted B10 fully mismatched cardiac allografts. Consistent 
with graft survival, the infiltration of CD4(+), CD8(+) T cells into the graft 
was lower, and that the numbers of CD40(low)CD11c(+) DCs cells and 
CD4(+)Foxp3(+)cells were increased in both the graft and in the recipient 
spleen. In addition, naive CBA recipients given an adoptive transfer of 
splenocytes from the primary recipients with siCD40/SPG accepted a heart graft 
from donor-type B10, but not third-party Balb/c mice. In conclusion, the 
treatment with siCD40/SPG targeting DCs could generate antigen-specific Tregs, 
resulting in the permanent acceptance of mouse cardiac allografts. These 
findings have important implications for clarifying the mechanism underlying the 
induction of tolerance in DCs, and also highlight the potential of 
immunomodulation and the feasibility of siRNA-based clinical therapy in the 
transplantation field.

This study aimed to document and validate a new cost-effectiveness model of 
osteoporosis screening and treatment strategies. The state-transition 
microsimulation model demonstrates strong internal and external validity. It is 
an important tool for researchers and policy makers to test the 
cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis screening and treatment strategies.
INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to document and validate a new 
cost-effectiveness model of screening for and treatment of osteoporosis.
METHODS: A state-transition microsimulation model using a lifetime horizon was 
constructed with seven Markov states (no history of fractures, hip fracture, 
vertebral fracture, wrist fracture, other fracture, postfracture state, and 
death) describing the most important clinical outcomes of osteoporotic 
fractures. Tracker variables were used to record patients' history, such as 
fracture events, duration of treatment, and time since last screening. The model 
was validated for Chinese postmenopausal women receiving screening and treatment 
versus no screening. Goodness-of-fit analyses were performed for internal and 
external validation. External validity was tested by comparing life expectancy, 
osteoporosis prevalence rate, and lifetime and 10-year fracture risks with 
published data not used in the model.
RESULTS: The model represents major clinical facets of osteoporosis-related 
conditions. Age-specific hip, vertebral, and wrist fracture incidence rates were 
accurately reproduced (the regression line slope was 0.996, R(2) = 0.99). The 
changes in costs, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness were consistent with 
changes in both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The model 
predicted life expectancy and 10-year any major osteoporotic fracture risk at 
the age of 65 of 19.01 years and 13.7%, respectively. The lifetime hip, clinical 
vertebral, and wrist fracture risks at age 50 were 7.9, 29.8, and 18.7% 
respectively, all consistent with reported data.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model demonstrated good internal and external validity, 
ensuring it can be confidently applied in economic evaluations of osteoporosis 
screening and treatment strategies.

Experimental results in epigenetics and related fields of biological research 
show that the Modern Synthesis (neo-Darwinist) theory of evolution requires 
either extension or replacement. This article examines the conceptual framework 
of neo-Darwinism, including the concepts of 'gene', 'selfish', 'code', 
'program', 'blueprint', 'book of life', 'replicator' and 'vehicle'. This form of 
representation is a barrier to extending or replacing existing theory as it 
confuses conceptual and empirical matters. These need to be clearly 
distinguished. In the case of the central concept of 'gene', the definition has 
moved all the way from describing a necessary cause (defined in terms of the 
inheritable phenotype itself) to an empirically testable hypothesis (in terms of 
causation by DNA sequences). Neo-Darwinism also privileges 'genes' in causation, 
whereas in multi-way networks of interactions there can be no privileged cause. 
An alternative conceptual framework is proposed that avoids these problems, and 
which is more favourable to an integrated systems view of evolution.

Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, UK. Competing interests: none 
declared.

The disease burden related to diabetes is high and rising in every country, 
fuelled by the global rise in the prevalence of obesity and unhealthy 
lifestyles. The latest estimates show a global prevalence of 382 million people 
with diabetes in 2013, expected to rise to 592 million by 2035. The aetiological 
classification of diabetes has now been widely accepted. Type 1 and type 2 
diabetes are the two main types, with type 2 diabetes accounting for the 
majority (>85%) of total diabetes prevalence. Both forms of diabetes can lead to 
multisystem complications of microvascular endpoints, including retinopathy, 
nephropathy and neuropathy, and macrovascular endpoints including ischaemic 
heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. The premature morbidity, 
mortality, reduced life expectancy and financial and other costs of diabetes 
make it an important public health condition.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of opportunistic 
salpingectomy (elective salpingectomy at hysterectomy or instead of tubal 
ligation).
METHODS: A Markov Monte Carlo simulation model estimated the costs and benefits 
of opportunistic salpingectomy in a hypothetical cohort of women undergoing 
hysterectomy for benign gynecologic conditions or surgical sterilization. The 
primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. 
Effectiveness was measured in terms of life expectancy gain. Sensitivity 
analyses accounted for uncertainty around various parameters. Monte Carlo 
simulation estimated the number of ovarian cancer cases associated with each 
strategy in the Canadian population.
RESULTS: Salpingectomy with hysterectomy was less costly ($11,044.32 ± $1.56) 
than hysterectomy alone ($11,206.52 ± $29.81) or with bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy ($12,626.84 ± $13.11) but more effective at 21.12 ± 0.02 
years compared with 21.10 ± 0.03 and 20.94 ± 0.03 years, representing average 
gains of 1 week and 2 months, respectively. For surgical sterilization, 
salpingectomy was more costly ($9,719.52 ± $3.74) than tubal ligation ($9,339.48 
± $26.74) but more effective at 22.45 ± 0.02 years compared with 22.43 ± 0.02 
years (average gain of 1 week) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
$27,278 per year of life gained. Our results were stable over a wide range of 
costs and risk estimates. Monte Carlo simulation predicted that salpingectomy 
would reduce ovarian cancer risk by 38.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 
36.5-41.3%) and 29.2% (95% CI 28.0-31.4%) compared with hysterectomy alone or 
tubal ligation, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Salpingectomy with hysterectomy for benign conditions will reduce 
ovarian cancer risk at acceptable cost and is a cost-effective alternative to 
tubal ligation for sterilization. Opportunistic salpingectomy should be 
considered for all women undergoing these surgical procedures.

Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: Laiwu District is recognized as a hyper-endemic region for scrub 
typhus in Shandong Province, but the seriousness of this problem has been 
neglected in public health circles.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) 
approach was adopted to measure the burden of scrub typhus in Laiwu, China 
during the period 2006 to 2012. A multiple seasonal autoregressive integrated 
moving average model (SARIMA) was used to identify the most suitable forecasting 
model for scrub typhus in Laiwu. Results showed that the disease burden of scrub 
typhus is increasing yearly in Laiwu, and which is higher in females than males. 
For both females and males, DALY rates were highest for the 60-69 age group. Of 
all the SARIMA models tested, the SARIMA(2,1,0)(0,1,0)12 model was the best fit 
for scrub typhus cases in Laiwu. Human infections occurred mainly in autumn with 
peaks in October.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Females, especially those of 60 to 69 years of age, 
were at highest risk of developing scrub typhus in Laiwu, China. The SARIMA 
(2,1,0)(0,1,0)12 model was the best fit forecasting model for scrub typhus in 
Laiwu, China. These data are useful for developing public health education and 
intervention programs to reduce disease.

BACKGROUND: Snakebite envenoming is a major public health problem throughout the 
rural tropics. Antivenom is effective in reducing mortality and remains the 
mainstay of therapy. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
using effective antivenoms for Snakebite envenoming in Nigeria.
METHODOLOGY: Economic analysis was conducted from a public healthcare system 
perspective. Estimates of model inputs were obtained from the literature. 
Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) were quantified as deaths and 
Disability-Adjusted-Life-Years (DALY) averted from antivenom therapy. A decision 
analytic model was developed and analyzed with the following model base-case 
parameter estimates: type of snakes causing bites, antivenom effectiveness to 
prevent death, untreated mortality, risk of Early Adverse Reactions (EAR), 
mortality risk from EAR, mean age at bite and remaining life expectancy, and 
disability risk (amputation). End-user costs applied included: costs of 
diagnosing and monitoring envenoming, antivenom drug cost, supportive care, 
shipping/freezing antivenom, transportation to-and-from hospital and feeding 
costs while on admission, management of antivenom EAR and free alternative 
snakebite care for ineffective antivenom.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We calculated a cost/death averted of ($2330.16) and 
cost/DALY averted of $99.61 discounted and $56.88 undiscounted. Varying 
antivenom effectiveness through the 95% confidence interval from 55% to 86% 
yield a cost/DALY averted of $137.02 to $86.61 respectively. Similarly, varying 
the prevalence of envenoming caused by carpet viper from 0% to 96% yield a 
cost/DALY averted of $254.18 to $78.25 respectively. More effective antivenoms 
and carpet viper envenoming rather than non-carpet viper envenoming were 
associated with lower cost/DALY averted.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Treatment of snakebite envenoming in Nigeria is 
cost-effective with a cost/death averted of $2330.16 and cost/DALY averted of 
$99.61 discounted, lower than the country's gross domestic product per capita of 
$1555 (2013). Expanding access to effective antivenoms to larger segments of the 
Nigerian population should be a considered a priority.

Sirolimus and tacrolimus are the major immunosuppressants for renal 
transplantation. Several studies have compared these 2 drugs, but the outcomes 
were not consistent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, 
and pharmacoeconomics of sirolimus and tacrolimus in the treatment of renal 
transplantation and provide evidence for the selection of essential drugs. 
Trials were identified through a computerized literature search of PubMed, 
EMBASE, Cochrane controlled trials register, Cochrane Renal Group Specialized 
Register of randomized controlled trials, and Chinese Biomedical database. Two 
independent reviewers assessed trials for eligibility and quality and then 
extracted data. Data were extracted for patient and graft mortality, acute 
rejection (AR), and adverse events. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as 
relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. A decision tree model was populated 
with data from a literature review and used to estimate costs and QALYs gained 
and incremental cost-effectiveness. Altogether, 1189 patients from 8 randomized 
controlled trials were included. The results of our analysis were that 
tacrolimus reduced the risks after renal transplantation of AR and patient 
withdrawn. Nevertheless, tacrolimus increased the risk of infection. 
Pharmacoeconomic analysis showed that tacrolimus represented a more 
cost-effective treatment than does cyclosporine for the prevention of adverse 
events after renal transplant. Tacrolimus is an effective and safe 
immunosuppressive agent, and it may be more cost-effective than cyclosporine for 
the primary prevention of AR in renal transplant recipients. However, it should 
be noted that such superiority was reversal when the cost of sirolimus and 
tacrolimus changed.

Increased shoulder abduction loads decreases volitional finger extension in 
individuals with chronic stroke: Preliminary findings.

Yiyun Lan, Jun Yao, Dewald J.

The ability to open the paretic hand is greatly affected after a stroke. The 
loss of especially finger extension has been previously reported during isolated 
finger movements. However, activities of daily life require the combination of 
reaching and grasping which will require shoulder abduction. Shoulder abductor 
activity will result in concurrent elbow, wrist and finger flexion which is also 
referred to as the flexion synergy. Therefore as part of this study the effect 
of of shoulder abduction (SABD) loading on volitional finger extension in 
individuals with chronic stroke is investigated. We expect to observe that 
shoulder abduction loading will further decrease the already impaired volitional 
finger extension in individuals with chronic stroke. A total of four moderately 
impaired individuals with chronic stroke and three age-matched able-bodied 
subjects participated in this study. Finger extension was recorded during hand 
open while subjects kept their arm extended at the end of a reach. The 
preliminary data showed that the maximal volitional finger extension was 
significantly decreased by increasing the SABD loads in individuals with chronic 
stroke, but not in age-matched able-bodied subjects.

In this study, we determined the cost-effectiveness of hip protector use 
compared with no hip protector on a geriatric ward in Germany. From both the 
societal and the statutory health insurance (SHI) perspectives, the 
cost-effectiveness ratios for the provision of hip protectors were below 
<euro>12,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) even if unrelated costs in added 
life years were included.
INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
the provision of hip protectors compared with no hip protectors on a geriatric 
ward in Germany.
METHODS: A lifetime decision-analytic Markov model was developed. Costs were 
measured from the societal and from the statutory health insurance (SHI) 
perspectives and comprised direct medical, non-medical and unrelated costs in 
additional life years gained. Health outcomes were measured in terms of 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). To reflect several levels of uncertainty, 
first- and second-order Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) approaches were applied.
RESULTS: Hip protector use compared with no hip protector results in savings 
(costs, -5.1/QALYs, 0.003) for the societal perspective. For the SHI 
perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was <euro>4416 <euro>/QALY 
(costs, +13.4). If unrelated costs in life years gained were included, the 
cost-effectiveness ratio increases to <euro>9794/QALY for the societal 
perspective and to <euro>11,426/QALY for the SHI perspective. In the MCS, for 
the societal perspective without unrelated costs, 47 % of simulations indicated 
hip protectors to be cost saving (i.e. lower costs and higher effects).
CONCLUSION: Although the gain in QALYs due to the provision of providing hip 
protectors to patients on geriatric wards is small, all scenarios showed 
acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios or even savings.

CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in the pathogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): a 
possible therapeutic target.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the commonest childhood malignancy, 
accounting for approximately 80 % of leukemia in the pediatric group, and its 
etiology is unknown. This neoplasia is characterized by male predominance, 
high-risk features and poor outcome, mainly in recurrence patients and adults. 
In recent years, advances in the success of childhood ALL treatment were 
verified, and the rate of cure is over 80 % of individuals. However, there is a 
considerable scope for improving therapeutic outcome in this neoplasia. 
Improvements in ALL therapy might readily be achieved by developing additional 
biomarkers that can predict and refine prognosis in patients with ALL. In normal 
hematopoietic cells, cytokines provide the stimulus for proliferation, survival, 
self-renewal, differentiation and functional activation. Abnormalities of 
cytokines are characteristic in all forms of leukemia, including ALL. The 
stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12) is a member of the CXC chemokine 
family that binds to CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis 
appears to play a role in dissemination of solid tumors and hematopoietic 
diseases. Understanding the mechanisms by which ALL cells are disseminated will 
provide additional information to expand therapeutic approach. Therefore, this 
review summarizes information relating to ALL cell biology, focusing 
specifically in a cytokine receptor important axis, CXCL12/CXCR4, that may have
