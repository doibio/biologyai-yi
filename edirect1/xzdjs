BACKGROUND: Over the last decades aggressive interventions have been successful 
to improve nutritional outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). As a 
result, with improvement of life expectancy and new CFTR modulators, overweight 
and obesity are progressively becoming a source of concern for adult population 
and in developed countries.
METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study of 321 
adults with CF at three large CF centers in Italy. Patients were divided into 
three groups according to BMI classes, overweight and obesity (OW) group 
including patients with BMI ≥25 kg/m2, normal weight (NW) group with BMI 
18.6-24.9 kg/m2 and underweight (UW) group with BMI ≤18.5 kg/m2.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that prevalence of OW in adults with CF in Italy is 
22%. OW status is independently associated with male sex (OR 3.520, P = 0.001), 
pancreatic sufficiency (OR 2.873, P = 0.014) and older age at diagnosis (1.015, 
P = 0.042). BMI correlated with ppFEV1 (r = 0.337; P<0.0001) with median ppFEV1 
significantly higher in patients with OW than comparisons. We also reported 
preliminary data on unfavorable cardiovascular risk factors in a subgroup of 
patients, where median blood levels [IQR] of cholesterol and systemic 
hypertension [%] were significantly higher in the OW group than in the NW and 
UW.
CONCLUSIONS: People with CF and OW is a relevant patient group that might 
deserve better definition and proper clinical management.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Physical and therapeutic strategies to maintain and 
rehabilitate skeletal muscle mass, strength, and postural balance are clinically 
relevant to improve the health, well-being, and quality of life of older adults. 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of photobiomodulation 
(PBM)/laser therapy combined with a resistance training (RT) program on 
quadriceps hypertrophy and strength, and postural balance in older women.
METHODS: In a randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled design, twenty-two 
older women (age 66.6 ± 5.2 years) were engaged in a supervised 10-wk RT program 
(2 times per week) involving unilateral leg extension exercise, in which each 
leg of the same participant was randomly assigned to receive active (λ = 808 nm, 
optical output = 100 mW, total energy = 42 J) or placebo laser PBM immediately 
before the RT sessions. Maximal dynamic strength by unilateral knee extension 
1-repetition maximum (1RM), muscle hypertrophy by vastus lateralis muscle 
thickness, and postural balance by one-legged stance test on a force platform 
were assessed before and after the training program.
RESULTS: Significance statistical analysis revealed a similar improvement (time 
P = .003) from pre- to posttraining for muscle hypertrophy and strength, and 
postural balance between active and placebo laser conditions. However, clinical 
interpretation for muscle hypertrophy showed a moderate effect (effect size [ES] 
= 0.58) for the active laser and a small effect (ES = 0.38) for the placebo 
laser. Clinical difference was not noticed between conditions for other analyzed 
variables.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that RT alone can be clinically important 
for counteracting the deleterious effects of aging on muscle size, strength, and 
balance, and that applying laser PBM therapy before the RT sessions may further 
improve gains in muscle hypertrophy.

Several studies focused on the role of vitamin D (vitD) in pain chronification. 
This study focused on vitD level and pain chronification and extension in 
headache disorders. Eighty patients with primary headache underwent neurological 
examination, laboratory exams, including serum calcifediol 25(OH)D, and headache 
features assessment along with three questionnaires investigating depression, 
anxiety, and allodynia. The 86.8% of the population had migraine (48% episodic 
and 52% chronic). The 44.1% of patients had extracranial pain, and 47.6% 
suffered from allodynia. A vitD deficit, namely a serum 25(OH)D level <20 ng/ml, 
was detectable in 46.1% of the patients, and it occurred more frequently (p = 
0.009) in patients suffering from chronic migraine (CM)-medication overuse 
migraine (MOH) (62.9%) than in episodic migraine (EM, 25.7%) or tension-type 
headache (TTH, 11.4%). The occurrence of extracranial pain and allodynia was 
higher in the CM-MOH than in the EM and in the TTH groups but was not related to 
the co-occurrence of vitD deficiency (Fisher's exact test p = 0.11 and p = 0.32, 
respectively). Our findings show that 25(OH)D deficit is also related to chronic 
headache, probably because of vitD anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic properties, 
reinforcing the idea of a neuroinflammatory mechanism underpinning migraine 
chronification.

The application of Tarkhineh texture to protect probiotics in potato chips has 
been investigated as the main goal in this paper. In this study, the probiotic 
assessments, morphological characteristics, sensory evaluation, and survival 
rates of the covered probiotic cells with Tarkhineh in potato chips during 
storage time were assessed. Based on results, T34 isolated from traditional 
Tarkhineh as a safe strain had a high tolerance to low pH and bile salt 
conditions, displayed acceptable anti-pathogenic activities, and also showed 
desirable antibiotic susceptibility. Two types of Tarkhineh formulations (plain 
Tarkhineh and turmeric Tarkhineh) were applied using a simple spraying method 
for covering T34 cells in potato chips. All formulations showed elliptical to 
spherical (480-770 μm) shape probiotic drops. Storage stability results revealed 
that T34 cells mixed with turmeric and plain Tarkhineh during 4 months of 
storage at 4°C displayed excellent protection abilities with about 3.70 and 2.85 
log decreases in CFU/g respectively. Additionally, probiotic potato chips 
compared to non-probiotic and commercial potato chips, exhibited probiotic 
product criteria such as excellent quality and superior sensory properties 
during storage time. In conclusion, Tarkhineh showed high potential as a 
protective matrix for probiotic cells in potato chips.

Open Reduction and Suture Fixation of Acute Sternoclavicular 
Fracture-Dislocations in Children.

BACKGROUND: Acute sternoclavicular fracture-dislocation is associated with 
high-energy trauma and is being increasingly recognized in children1. These 
injuries are associated with compression of mediastinal structures and can be 
life-threatening1. The management of acute sternoclavicular fracture-dislocation 
includes closed reduction or open surgical stabilization; however, limited 
success is reported with closed reduction2,3. To our knowledge, there are no 
detailed descriptions of open reduction and suture fixation of acute 
sternoclavicular fracture-dislocation in children.
DESCRIPTION: Following diagnosis of acute sternoclavicular fracture-dislocation, 
the timing of surgical treatment is determined according to several patient and 
surgical factors. Among patients with hemodynamic instability, respiratory 
compromise, or evidence of asymmetric perfusion, surgical treatment is needed on 
an emergency basis. In the absence of these factors, surgical treatment can be 
performed on an urgent basis. It is important to communicate with vascular or 
thoracic surgeons prior to proceeding to the operating room because of the rare 
case in which advanced surgical access or vascular repair is required. In the 
operating room, general anesthesia and large-bore intravenous access are 
required. Patients are positioned supine on a radiolucent table, and a small 
bump is placed between the scapulae to elevate the medial aspect of the 
clavicle. The contralateral sternoclavicular joint and medial aspect of the 
clavicle should be prepared into the sterile field, as well as both sides of the 
groin in case vascular access is needed. A 6 to 8-cm incision is centered on the 
medial aspect of the clavicle, extending to the manubrium. Standard dissection 
to the clavicle is performed, and care is taken to maintain the integrity of the 
sternoclavicular ligament complex. Circumferential dissection of the medial 
clavicular metaphysis is usually required in order to mobilize the dislocated 
fragment. Reduction of the physeal fracture usually requires axial traction and 
extension of the ipsilateral shoulder with the aid of a reduction clamp on the 
medial clavicular metaphysis. In some cases, a Freer elevator can be placed 
between the metaphysis and epiphysis to shoehorn the clavicle from posterior to 
anterior. Once reduced, the fracture-dislocation is usually stable; however, the 
reduction is augmented with suture fixation. The sternoclavicular joint capsule 
should be repaired if disrupted, and the incision should be closed in layers. 
Postoperatively, the arm is placed in a sling, and range of motion is commenced 
at 4 weeks.
ALTERNATIVES: Alternative management of acute sternoclavicular 
fracture-dislocation includes closed reduction, plate fixation4, and ligament 
reconstruction5.
RATIONALE: In our experience, closed reduction is often unsuccessful, which is 
consistent with the experiences reported by other authors2,3. In addition, 
suture fixation is sufficient and plate fixation is not required because this 
injury is relatively stable following reduction. Lastly, ligament reconstruction 
with use of autograft or allograft may be indicated but is more relevant in 
chronic cases with injury or attenuation of the sternoclavicular ligament 
complex. Open reduction allows for direct visualization of the fracture 
reduction, and suture fixation allows for increased stability without the need 
for hardware or secondary surgical procedures.
EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We expect patients to achieve full range of motion and 
strength without any joint instability as reported by Waters et al.3.
IMPORTANT TIPS: There is an inherent risk of vascular injury with open reduction 
and suture fixation. This risk is mitigated with perioperative planning and 
consultation with vascular or thoracic surgeons. General surgeons should always 
be available when these procedures are performed in case of vascular issues or 
emergencies.It is sometimes difficult to reduce the dislocation, but additional 
maneuvers allow for controlled reduction of the displaced clavicle, such as 
using a Freer elevator and serrated clamp.Assessing fracture reduction can be 
difficult intraoperatively. Including the contralateral sternoclavicular joint 
in the sterile surgical field can be helpful in assessing fracture reduction and 
osseous contour.

OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to investigate the changes in clinical and 
psychosocial outcomes in patients with Dupuytren's disease after initial 
treatment with collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection.
METHODS: This study involved 14 patients with Dupuytren's disease who underwent 
treatment with CCH injection. The range of motion of each phalangeal joint was 
measured before treatment and at 6 months posttreatment. The following 
assessments were also carried out pre- and posttreatment: the Geriatric 
Depression Scale Short - Japanese version (GDS-J) to evaluate depressive status, 
Hand 10 to assess hand health status, and EuroQol-5-dimension-3-level Japanese 
version to evaluate health-related quality of life.
RESULTS: Significant improvements were found in metacarpophalangeal joint 
extension and proximal interphalangeal joint extension. Significant differences 
were also found between values before the initiation of CCH injection and those 
at 6 months posttreatment for the EuroQol index score and the EuroQol Visual 
Analog Scale (VAS). Significant positive correlations were found between the 
pre- to posttreatment change in GDS-J scores and for the change in Hand 10 
scores. Moreover, a significant negative correlation was found between the 
change in GDS-J scores and change in EuroQol index scores/EuroQol VAS scores 
before and at 6 months after CCH injection.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with Dupuytren's disease, CCH therapy directly 
improved the health-related quality of life. The degree of improvement of 
depressive status was associated with the degree of improvement of hand health 
status and health-related quality of life.

Dementia and cancer occur commonly in older adults. Yet, little is known about 
the effect of dementia on cancer treatment and outcomes in patients diagnosed 
with cancer, and no guidelines exist. We performed a mixed studies review to 
assess the current knowledge and gaps on the impact of dementia on cancer 
treatment decision-making, cancer treatment, and mortality. A search in PubMed, 
Medline, and PsycINFO identified 55 studies on older adults with a dementia 
diagnosis before a cancer diagnosis and/or comorbid cancer and dementia 
published in English from January 2004 to February 2020. We described 
variability using range in quantitative estimates, ie, odds ratios (ORs), hazard 
ratios (HRs), and risk ratios (RR) when appropriate and performed narrative 
review of qualitative data. Patients with dementia were more likely to receive 
no curative treatment (including hospice or palliative care) (OR, HR, and RR 
range = 0.40-4.4, n = 8), while less likely to receive chemotherapy (OR and HR 
range = 0.11-0.68, n = 8), radiation (OR range = 0.24-0.56, n = 2), and surgery 
(OR range = 0.30-1.3, n = 4). Older adults with cancer and dementia had higher 
mortality than those with cancer alone (HR and OR range = 0.92-5.8, n = 33). 
Summarized findings from qualitative studies consistently revealed that 
clinicians, caregivers, and patients tended to prefer less aggressive care and 
gave higher priority to quality of life over life expectancy for those with 
dementia. Current practices in treatment-decision making for patients with both 
cancer and dementia are inconsistent. There is an urgent need for treatment 
guidelines for this growing patient population that considers patient and 
caregiver perspectives.

BACKGROUND: Estimates in the research literature on the health-related quality 
of life (QOL) associated with pneumococcal disease exhibit variation. It 
complicates the selection of estimates in modeling projects that evaluate the 
health impact and economic value of the prevention and treatment. This study 
reviewed the literature and developed pooled QOL estimates associated with 
pneumococcal disease states.
METHODS: We searched peer-reviewed literature for studies that reported 
pneumococcal disease-related QOL estimates. For each study, we extracted QOL 
estimates and categorized by age group and disease state. QOL estimates were 
converted to quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Pooled QALY estimates were 
calculated using simple average, sample-size weighting and inverse-variance 
weighting.
RESULTS: From 18 studies, we organized QOL estimates into 20 groups based on age 
and disease state. We observed the largest within-disease state variations of 
QALY estimates in meningitis-related disease states compared to other disease 
states. Across all age-disease state categories, the pooled QALY estimates 
ranged from 0.39 for meningitis with long-term sequelae among 0- to 
18-year-olds, to 1.00 for non-inpatient pneumonia among 0- to 18-year-olds.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated disparities in QOL estimates associated with 
pneumococcal disease from the literature. Pooled estimates provided a source of 
consistency that can be used in future modeling efforts.

INTRODUCTION: Stroke and dementia share a number of modifiable risk factors and 
are the leading cause of neurological disability and death worldwide.
METHODS: We report the 2019 estimations for global disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs) and death numbers and rates related to stroke and dementia, as 
well as their risk attributed DALYs and deaths and their changes between 2010 
and 2019.
RESULTS: Stroke accounted for 69.8%, dementia for 17.3%, and combined 
contributed to 87.2% (8.2 million) of neurological deaths and 61.7% (168.5 
million) of neurological DALYs in 2019. For stroke, 86.4% of DALYs and for 
dementias 32.8% of DALYs are attributable to risk factors. Globally, 
hypertension (54.8%) and unhealthy diet (30.0%) pose the greatest risk for 
stroke DALYs, and smoking (15.1%) and obesity (12.5%) for dementia DALYs.
DISCUSSION: Worldwide, stroke and dementia cases are increasing in number, but 
their age-standardized rates are falling. Finding out why offers the possibility 
of their joint delay, mitigation, or prevention.

INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has placed intensive care 
units (ICU) triage at the center of bioethical discussions. National and 
international triage guidelines emerged from professional and governmental 
bodies and have led to controversial discussions about which criteria-e.g. 
medical prognosis, age, life-expectancy or quality of life-are ethically 
acceptable. The paper presents the main points of agreement and disagreement in 
triage protocols and reviews the ethical debate surrounding them.
SOURCES OF DATA: Published articles, news articles, book chapters, ICU triage 
guidelines set out by professional societies and health authorities.
AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Points of agreement in the guidelines that are widely 
supported by ethical arguments are (i) to avoid using a first come, first served 
policy or quality-adjusted life-years and (ii) to rely on medical prognosis, 
maximizing lives saved, justice as fairness and non-discrimination.
AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Points of disagreement in existing guidelines and the 
ethics literature more broadly regard the use of exclusion criteria, the role of 
life expectancy, the prioritization of healthcare workers and the reassessment 
of triage decisions.
GROWING POINTS: Improve outcome predictions, possibly aided by Artificial 
intelligence (AI); develop participatory approaches to drafting, assessing and 
revising triaging protocols; learn from experiences with implementation of 
guidelines with a view to continuously improve decision-making.
AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Examine the universality vs. 
context-dependence of triaging principles and criteria; empirically test the 
appropriateness of triaging guidelines, including impact on vulnerable groups

PURPOSE: The prolonged life expectancy and increase in aging of the population 
have led surgeons to propose hepatectomy in the elderly population. In this 
study, we evaluate the surgical outcome of octogenarians in a single French 
center.
METHODS: Between 2000 and 2020, 78 patients over 80 years old were 
retrospectively analyzed. The risk factors of major complications (Clavien-Dindo 
≥ grade IIIa) and patient performance after surgery by using textbook outcome 
(TO) (no surgical complications, no prolonged hospital stay (≤ 15 days), no 
readmission ≤90 days after discharge, and no mortality ≤90 days after surgery) 
were studied.
RESULTS: The main surgical indication was for malignancy (96%), including mainly 
colorectal liver metastases (n = 41; 53%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 22; 
28%), and major hepatectomy was performed in 28 patients (36%). There were 6 
(8%) postoperative mortalities. The most frequent complications were pulmonary 
(n = 22; 32%), followed by renal insufficiency (n = 22; 28%) and delirium (n = 
16; 21%). Major complications occurred in 19 (24%) patients. On multivariate 
analysis, the main risk factors for major complications were the median vascular 
clamping time (0 vs 35; P = 0.04) and male sex (P = 0.046). TO was ultimately 
achieved in 30 patients (38%), and there was no prognostic factor for 
achievement of TO.
CONCLUSIONS: Hepatectomy in octogenarians is associated with acceptable 
morbidity and mortality. Meanwhile, prolonged hepatic pedicle clamping should be 
avoided especially if hepatectomy is planned in a male patient.

BACKGROUND: Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery and aortic valve replacement 
surgery are essential treatment options for people suffering from angina 
pectoris or aortic valve disease. Surgery aims to prolong life expectancy, 
improve quality of life, and facilitate participation in society for the 
individuals afflicted. The aim of this review was to explore the literature on 
work participation in patients following coronary artery bypass grafting or 
aortic valve replacement surgery, and to identify demographic and clinical 
characteristics associated with returning to work.
METHODS: A scoping review framework of Arksey and O'Malley was chosen. Four 
electronic databases: Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched 
for studies in English, Swedish, Danish or Norwegian between January 1988 and 
January 2020. A blinded selection of articles was performed. The data were then 
charted and summarized by descriptive numerical analyses and categorized into 
themes.
RESULTS: Forty-five out of 432 articles were included in the final full-text 
analysis. Absence from work following coronary artery bypass graft grafting or 
aortic valve replacement surgery lasted on average 30 weeks, whereas 34% of the 
patients never returned to work. Being female, suffering from pre-existing 
depression, having limited secondary education, or low income were associated 
with decreased return to work rates. Previous employment was a decisive factor 
for returning to work after surgery. Data on return to work after aortic valve 
replacement were scarce.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of patients never return to work following 
coronary artery bypass grafting or aortic valve surgery, and the time interval 
until work return is longer than expected. Failure to resume work represents a 
threat to the patients' finances and quality of life. Nurses are in a unique 
position to assess work-related issues and have an active part in the 
multi-disciplinary facilitation of tailored occupational counselling after 
cardiac surgery.

462. WHO guideline on health workforce development, attraction, recruitment and 
retention in rural and remote areas [Internet].

Geneva: World Health Organization; 2021.
WHO Guidelines Approved by the Guidelines Review Committee.

With nearly half of the world’s population living in a rural or remote area, 
meeting the health needs of rural populations, where over 80% of the world’s 
extremely poor live, is imperative in achieving universal health coverage. 
Leaving no one behind means ensuring that health workers are available in rural 
and remote areas. Health, social and economic inequities remain cross-cutting 
challenges for rural populations. Rural populations tend to be poorer, have 
worse health outcomes, and experience higher rates of unemployment, 
underemployment and informal employment. It is estimated that about 51–67% of 
rural populations are without adequate access to essential health services , 
translating to about 2 billion people being left behind. In some countries, 
rural populations have access to numbers of health workers that are 10 times 
less than the numbers available to urban populations. The deficiency in numbers 
and mix of trained motivated health workers to provide the needed health 
services is a critical health system issue. This inequitable access to health 
workers and health services impacts health outcomes and increases socioeconomic 
disadvantages. Higher under-5, maternal and preventable mortality rates, 
increased morbidity, decreased life expectancy, and more costs to access distant 
care are seen across rural areas.

the Australian Burden of Disease Study 2015 and the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2017.

BACKGROUND: Estimates of burden of disease are important for monitoring 
population health, informing policy and service planning. Burden estimates for 
the same population can be reported differently by national studies [e.g. the 
Australian Burden of Disease Study (ABDS) and the Global Burden of Disease Study 
(GBDS)].
METHODS: Australian ABDS 2015 and GBDS 2017 burden estimates and methods for 
2015 were compared. Years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD) 
and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) measures were compared for overall 
burden and 'top 50' causes. Disease-category definitions (based on ICD-10), 
redistribution algorithms, data sources, disability weights, modelling methods 
and assumptions were reviewed.
RESULTS: GBDS 2017 estimated higher totals than ABDS 2015 for YLL, YLD and DALY 
for Australia. YLL differences were mainly driven by differences in the 
allocation of deaths to disease categories and the redistribution of implausible 
causes of death. For YLD, the main drivers were data sources, severity 
distributions and modelling strategies. Most top-50 diseases for DALY had a 
similar YLL:YLD composition reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the ABDS and GBDS estimates reflect the different 
purposes of local and international studies and differences in data and 
modelling strategies. The GBDS uses all available evidence and is useful for 
international comparisons. National studies such as the ABDS have the 
flexibility to meet local needs and often the advantage of access to unpublished 
data. It is important that all data sources, inputs and models be assessed for 
quality and appropriateness. As studies evolve, differences should be accounted 
for through increased transparency of data and methods.

Geographic patterns of poor health and mortality risk are found in most 
countries. Important health effects at the neighborhood level are mortality, 
general health, illness and disabilities, mental health, and healthcare 
utilization. Awareness of the influence of social class on health has been 
growing during the last decades. Studies show that individuals with lower 
socioeconomic status (SES) have a shorter life expectancy than do their 
'well-off' counterparts. Yet SES-related health inequalities cannot be fully 
explained by individual characteristics, and environmental qualities should be 
taken into account. Many aspects of local areas that might be related to health 
or access to opportunities to live healthily are systematically poorer in 
socially disadvantaged areas. Such factors have the potential to explain health 
differences between deprived and prosperous neighborhoods. Investigating health 
differences at the neighborhood level implies conceptual as well as 
methodological issues pertaining to selection, accumulation, multiple level 
measurement, objective features versus perceptions, and time dynamic aspects. 
This article reviews such issues and evaluates several exemplary theoretical 
approaches from the fields of public health and environmental health in their 
ability to overcome such problems.

BACKGROUND: Historically, published guidelines for care after molar pregnancy 
recommended monitoring human chorionic gonadotropin levels for the development 
of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia until normal and then for 6 months after 
the first normal human chorionic gonadotropin. However, there are little data 
underlying such recommendations, and recent evidence has demonstrated that 
gestational trophoblastic neoplasia diagnosis after human chorionic gonadotropin 
normalization is rare.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of alternative 
strategies for surveillance for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia after human 
chorionic gonadotropin normalization after complete and partial molar pregnancy.
STUDY DESIGN: A Markov-based cost-effectiveness model, using monthly cycles and 
terminating after 36 months/cycles, was constructed to compare alternative 
strategies for asymptomatic human chorionic gonadotropin surveillance after the 
first normal (none; monthly testing for 1, 3, 6, and 12 months; or every 3-month 
testing for 3, 6, and 12 months) for both complete and partial molar pregnancy. 
The risk of reduced surveillance was modeled by increasing the probability of 
high-risk disease at diagnosis. Probabilities, costs, and utilities were 
estimated from peer-reviewed literature, with all cost data applicable to the 
United States and adjusted to 2020 US dollars. The primary outcome was cost per 
quality-adjusted life year ($/quality-adjusted life year) with a 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life year willingness-to-pay threshold.
RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, we found no further surveillance after the 
first normal human chorionic gonadotropin to be the dominant strategy from both 
the healthcare system and societal perspectives, for both complete and partial 
molar pregnancy. After complete mole, this strategy had the lowest average cost 
(healthcare system, $144 vs maximum $283; societal, $152 vs maximum $443) and 
highest effectiveness (2.711 vs minimum 2.682 quality-adjusted life years). This 
strategy led to a slightly higher rate of death from gestational trophoblastic 
neoplasia (0.013% vs minimum 0.009%), although with high costs per gestational 
trophoblastic neoplasia death avoided (range, $214,000 to >$4 million). Societal 
perspective costs of lost wages had a greater impact on frequent surveillance 
costs than rare gestational trophoblastic neoplasia treatment costs, and no 
further surveillance was more favorable from this perspective in otherwise 
identical analyses. No further surveillance remained dominant or preferred with 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of <$100,000 in all analyses for partial 
mole, and most sensitivity analyses for complete mole. Under the assumption of 
no disutility from surveillance, surveillance strategies were more effective (by 
quality-adjusted life year) than no further surveillance, and a single human 
chorionic gonadotropin test at 3 months was found to be cost-effective after 
complete mole with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $53,261 from the 
healthcare perspective, but not from the societal perspective (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio, $288,783).
CONCLUSION: Largely owing to the rare incidence of gestational trophoblastic 
neoplasia after human chorionic gonadotropin normalization after molar 
pregnancy, prolonged surveillance is not cost-effective under most assumptions. 
It would be reasonable to reduce, and potentially eliminate, current 
recommendations for surveillance after human chorionic gonadotropin 
normalization after molar pregnancy, particularly among partial moles. With any 
reduction in surveillance, patients should be counseled on symptoms of 
gestational trophoblastic neoplasia and established in routine gynecologic care.

BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetically determined systemic 
connective tissue disorder, caused by a mutation in the FBN1 gene. In MFS mainly 
the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and ocular systems are affected. The most 
dangerous manifestation of MFS is aortic dissection, which needs to be prevented 
by a prophylactic aortic root replacement.
MAIN BODY: The indication criteria for the prophylactic procedure is currently 
based on aortic diameter, however aortic dissections below the threshold defined 
in the guidelines have been reported, highlighting the need for a more accurate 
risk stratification system to predict the occurrence of aortic complications. 
The aim of this review is to present the current knowledge on the possible 
predictors of severe cardiovascular manifestations in MFS patients, 
demonstrating the wide range of molecular and radiological differences between 
people with MFS and healthy individuals, and more importantly between MFS 
patients with and without advanced aortic manifestations. These differences 
originating from the underlying common molecular pathological processes can be 
assessed by laboratory (e.g. genetic testing) and imaging techniques to serve as 
biomarkers of severe aortic involvement. In this review we paid special 
attention to the rapidly expanding field of genotype-phenotype correlations for 
aortic features as by collecting and presenting the ever growing number of 
correlations, future perspectives for risk stratification can be outlined.
CONCLUSIONS: Data on promising biomarkers of severe aortic complications of MFS 
have been accumulating steadily. However, more unifying studies are required to 
further evaluate the applicability of the discussed predictors with the aim of 
improving the risk stratification and therefore the life expectancy and quality 
of life of MFS patients.

BACKGROUND: People with serious mental illnesses (SMI) such as schizophrenia 
often also have physical health illnesses and interventions are needed to 
address the resultant multimorbidity and reduced life expectancy. Research has 
shown that volunteers can support people with SMI. This protocol describes a 
feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a novel intervention involving 
volunteer 'Health Champions' supporting people with SMI to manage and improve 
their physical health.
METHODS: This is a feasibility hybrid II randomised effectiveness-implementation 
controlled trial. The intervention involves training volunteers to be 'Health 
Champions' to support individual people with SMI using mental health services. 
This face-to-face or remote support will take place weekly and last for up to 9 
months following initial introduction. This study will recruit 120 participants 
to compare Health Champions to treatment as usual for people with SMI using 
secondary community mental health services in South London, UK. We will measure 
the clinical and cost effectiveness including quality of life. We will measure 
the implementation outcomes of acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, 
fidelity, barriers and enablers, unintended consequences, adoption and 
sustainability.
DISCUSSION: There is a need for interventions to support people with SMI with 
their physical health. If this feasibility trial is successful, a definitive 
trial will follow to fully evaluate the clinical, cost and implementation 
effectiveness of Health Champions supporting people with SMI.

OBJECTIVES: The appropriateness of moderate aortic regurgitation treatment 
during mitral valve (MV) surgery remains unclear. The goal of this study was to 
evaluate the immediate and long-term outcomes of patients with moderate aortic 
regurgitation at the time of MV surgery.
METHODS: We included 183 patients admitted to our institution for elective 
treatment of MV disease between 2004 and 2018, in whom moderate aortic 
regurgitation was diagnosed during preoperative evaluation. One hundred and 
twenty-two patients underwent isolated MV surgery (study group) whereas 61
