median survival from infection to death in the HIV-infected was 11.8 years; that 
from infection to establishment of AIDS was 11.6 years; the life expectancy 
following its diagnosis was 1.9 months. Patient age was a main factor 
influencing the course of HIV infection: in persons who had been infected with 
HIV at an age of over 35 years, lower CD4 lymphocyte counts and clinical 
progression occurred more rapidly than in those infected at a younger age. Less 
than 50% of the patients needed ART 5 years after HIV infection.
CONCLUSION: An HIV-infected patient without ART survives almost twice less. It 
is necessary to detect HIV infection as early as possible and to regularly 
follow up patients regardless of the duration of infection in order to timely 
initiate its treatment.

Recent research has shown a widening gap in life expectancy at age 50 between 
the United States and Europe as well as large differences in the prevalence of 
diseases at older ages. Little is known about the processes determining 
international differences in the prevalence of chronic diseases. Higher 
prevalence of disease could result from either higher incidence or longer 
disease-specific survival. This article uses comparable longitudinal data from 
2004 and 2006 for populations aged 50 to 79 from the United States and from a 
selected group of European countries to examine age-specific differences in 
prevalence and incidence of heart disease, stroke, lung disease, diabetes, 
hypertension, and cancer as well as mortality associated with each disease. Not 
surprisingly, we find that Americans have higher disease prevalence. For heart 
disease, diabetes, and cancer, incidence is lower in Europe when we control for 
sociodemographic and health behavior differences in risk, and these differences 
explain much of the prevalence gap at older ages. On the other hand, incidence 
is higher in Europe for lung disease and not different between Europe and the 
United States for hypertension and stroke. Our findings do not suggest a 
survival advantage conditional on disease in Europe compared with the United 
States. Therefore, the origin of the higher disease prevalence at older ages in 
the United States is to be found in higher prevalence earlier in the life course 
and, for some conditions, higher incidence between ages 50 and 79.

It was reported that the parasporal crystal from Bacillus thuringiensis 
contained DNA fragments. To investigate the distribution of protoxin and DNA in 
B. thuringiensis cells at different growth stages, a cry1Ac-gfp fusion gene was 
constructed and expressed in an acrystalliferous B. thuringiensis strain, in 
which the localization of DNA and protoxin were indicated by DNA-specific dye 
and green fluorescent protein, respectively. When the recombinant cells were at 
the vegetative growth stage, the Cry1Ac-GFP fusion protein was not expressed and 
the DNA fluorescent signal was evenly distributed throughout the cell. At the 
initial stage of sporulation, the Cry1Ac-GFP fusion protein was expressed and 
accumulated as inclusion body, while two condensed DNA signals existed at each 
pole of the cell. With the extension of culture time, it seemed that the DNA 
fluorescence from the region of spore development gradually became faint or 
vanishing, while the DNA signal was still present in the other pole or the 
remaining area of the mother cell. Interestingly and unexpectedly, there was no 
DNA fluorescence signal in the region of the growing and mature inclusion body 
of Cry1Ac-GFP in B. thuringiensis cell, which might indicate that the DNA 
embodied in the inclusion body was not accessible to the DNA-specific dye. This 
was the first investigation devoted exclusively to the in vivo distribution of 
protoxin and DNA in B. thuringiensis at different growth stages. These data shed 
light on deeply understanding the process of sporulation and parasporal crystal 
formation as well as further exploring the interaction of DNA and protoxin in B. 
thuringiensis.

Probabilistic Markov Model Estimating Cost Effectiveness of Methylphenidate 
Osmotic-Release Oral System Versus Immediate-Release Methylphenidate in Children 
and Adolescents: Which Information is Needed?

BACKGROUND: Incidence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 
children and adolescents has been increasing. The disorder results in high 
societal costs. Policymakers increasingly use health economic evaluations to 
inform decisions on competing treatments of ADHD. Yet, health economic 
evaluations of first-choice medication of ADHD in children and adolescents are 
scarce and generally do not include broader societal effects.
OBJECTIVES: This study presents a probabilistic model and analysis of 
methylphenidate osmotic-release oral system (OROS) versus methylphenidate 
immediate-release (IR). We investigate and include relevant societal aspects in 
the analysis so as to provide cost-effectiveness estimates based on a broad 
societal perspective.
METHODS: We enhanced an existing Markov model and determined the cost 
effectiveness of OROS versus IR for children and adolescents responding 
suboptimally to treatment with IR. Enhancements included screening of a broad 
literature base, updated utility values, inclusion of costs and effects on 
caregivers and a change of the model type from deterministic to probabilistic.
RESULTS: The base case scenario resulted in lower incremental costs (€-5815) of 
OROS compared with IR and higher incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
gains (0.22). Scenario analyses were performed to determine sensitivity to 
changes in transition rates, utility of caregivers, medical costs of caregivers 
and daily medication dose.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that, for children responding suboptimally to 
treatment with IR, the beneficial effect of OROS on compliance may be worth the 
additional costs of medication. The presented model adds to the health economic 
information available for policymakers and to considerations on a broader 
perspective in cost-effectiveness analyses.

How many cancer deaths could New Zealand avoid if five-year relative survival 
ratios were the same as in Australia?

Zealand.

AIM: To determine how many Māori and non-Māori deaths might have been avoidable 
if cancer survival in New Zealand were as high as in Australia.
METHODS: Age-sex-tumour specific five-year relative survival ratios were 
calculated for cancer patients diagnosed with 27 tumour sites (representing 
about 92% of all cancers) in 2006-10. These were used to estimate the number of 
Māori, non-Māori and total deaths (and proportion of excess deaths) that would 
have been avoidable within five years of diagnosis had New Zealand's relative 
survival been equivalent to Australia's.
RESULTS: A total of 3,631 cancer deaths (726/year; 13.4% of excess deaths) could 
have been avoidable. Among 25 tumours where ethnic-specific results were 
estimated, there were 851 potentially avoidable deaths in Māori (24.9%) and 
2,758 in non-Māori (11.8%). Breast, bowel, lung and prostate tumours made up 64% 
of avoidable deaths. Those with the highest proportions of avoidable deaths were 
thyroid (44.7%), prostate (35.5%), breast (30.0%) and uterus (23.5%). More than 
50% of Māori melanoma, prostate, testis and thyroid cancer deaths were 
avoidable.
CONCLUSION: A significant number of cancer deaths could be avoidable if New 
Zealand achieved Australia's relative survival ratios. The proportion is much 
higher for Māori than for non-Māori.
IMPLICATIONS: There is considerable scope to improve cancer outcomes in New 
Zealand.

UK DRAFFT: a randomised controlled trial of percutaneous fixation with Kirschner 
wires versus volar locking-plate fixation in the treatment of adult patients 
with a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius.

BACKGROUND: In high-income countries, 6% of all women will have sustained a 
fracture of the wrist (distal radius) by the age of 80 years and 9% by the age 
of 90 years. Advances in orthopaedic surgery have improved the outcome for 
patients: many such fractures can be treated in a plaster cast alone, but others 
require surgical fixation to hold the bone in place while they heal. The 
existing evidence suggests that modern locking-plate fixation provides improved 
functional outcomes, but costs more than traditional wire fixation.
METHODS: In this multicentre trial, we randomly assigned 461 adult patients 
having surgery for an acute dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius to 
either percutaneous Kirschner-wire fixation or locking-plate fixation. The 
primary outcome measure was the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation© (PRWE) 
questionnaire at 12 months after the fracture. In this surgical trial, neither 
the patients nor the surgeons could be blind to the intervention. We also 
collected information on complications and combined costs and quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) to assess cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of the two groups were well balanced and 
over 90% of patients completed follow-up. Both groups of patients recovered 
wrist function by 12 months. There was no clinically relevant difference in the 
PRWE questionnaire score at 3 months, 6 months or 12 months [difference at 12 
months: -1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.5 to 1.8; p=0.398]. There was no 
difference in the number of complications in each group and small differences in 
QALY gains (0.008; 95% CI -0.001 to 0.018); Kirschner-wire fixation represents a 
cost-saving intervention (-£727; 95% CI -£588 to -£865), particularly in younger 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the existing literature, and against the increasing use 
of locking-plate fixation, this trial shows that there is no difference between 
Kirschner wires and volar locking plates for patients with dorsally displaced 
fractures of the distal radius. A Kirschner-wire fixation is less expensive and 
quicker to perform.

INTRODUCTION: Depression and psychosis are two of the most severe 
neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both NPS have negative effects on cognitive 
performance and life expectancy. The current study aimed to investigate and 
compare monoaminergic etiologies between both neurodegenerative conditions, 
given the lack of an efficient pharmacological treatment until present.
METHODS: Eleven behaviorally relevant brain regions of the left frozen 
hemisphere of 10 neuropathologically confirmed AD patients with/without 
depression (AD + D/-D; 5 were psychotic within AD + D), 10 confirmed DLB 
patients, all of whom were depressed (DLB + D; 5 psychotic patients), and, 
finally, 10 confirmed control subjects were regionally dissected. All patients 
were retrospectively assessed before death using the Behavioral Pathology in 
Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (Behave-AD) and Cornell Scale for Depression in 
Dementia amongst others. The concentrations of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), 
(nor)adrenaline and respective metabolites, i.e. 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid 
(DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxy-3-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), 
and, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), were determined using 
reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical 
detection.
RESULTS: DLB subjects had the overall lowest monoamine and metabolite 
concentrations regarding 33 out of 41 significant monoaminergic group 
alterations. Moreover, MHPG levels were significantly decreased in almost 8 out 
of 11 brain regions of DLB- compared to AD patients. We also observed the lowest 
5-HT and 5-HIAA levels, and 5-HIAA/5-HT turnover ratios in DLB + D compared to 
AD + D subjects. Additionally, a 4- and 7-fold increase of DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA 
turnover ratios, and, a 10-fold decrease of thalamic DA levels in DLB + D 
compared to AD + D patients and control subjects was noticed. Regarding 
psychosis, hippocampal DA levels in the overall DLB group significantly 
correlated with Behave-AD AB scores. In the total AD group, DA levels and HVA/DA 
ratios in the amygdala significantly correlated with Behave-AD AB scores 
instead.
CONCLUSIONS: Monoaminergic neurotransmitter alterations contribute differently 
to the pathophysiology of depression and psychosis in DLB as opposed to AD, with 
a severely decreased serotonergic neurotransmission as the main monoaminergic 
etiology of depression in DLB. Similarly, psychosis in DLB might, in part, be 
etiologically explained by dopaminergic alterations in the hippocampus, whereas 
in AD, the amygdala might be involved.

Evaluation of the effectiveness of computed tomography in the diagnosis of 
orbital tumours in ibadan, southwest Nigeria.

Akinmoladun J, Adeyinka A, Uchendu O, Vi A.

BACKGROUND: The orbit is a bony cavity within the skull that is composed of many 
structures which may undergo neoplastic transformation. Failure to diagnose the 
tumour and determine its extent may lead to high morbidity and mortality. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate the role of computed tomography in the 
diagnosis of orbital tumours in our centre.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed Tomography images acquired from a multi-sliced 
CT machine, tissue diagnoses obtained from histopathology reports and patients' 
clinical records were reviewed. The data were analyzed and presented using 
frequency tables, percentages and charts as appropriate.
RESULTS: Sixty six patients made up of 34 (51.6%) males and 32 (48.4%) females 
were studied. The ages ranged between 1 and 80 years with a mean of 35 years. 
Majority (50%) of the patients were in their 4th - 6th decades of life. While 
secondary orbital tumours were seen in 42 (63.6%) patients, primary tumours 
occurred in 23 (34.8%) cases. Metastatic deposit was seen in 1 (1.6%) patient. 
Bone was the most commonly affected orbital tissue. The CT diagnoses of benign 
and malignant tumours were accurate when compared with histopathological 
diagnoses in 80.6% and 96.7 % of the cases respectively.
CONCLUSION: Computed Tomography is useful in characterizing the nature, precise 
location of a lesion within the orbit and to demonstrate the extension of the 
orbital lesion into contiguous structures. This study showed that Computed 
tomography is also a useful imaging technique in the diagnosis of orbital 
tumours with high concordance rate when compared with histological diagnoses.

This study shows that lack of ovarian activity has a negative impact on the life 
span of female mice. The extent to which this phenomenon could be associated 
with the anti-inflammatory effect of estrogens was analyzed in metabolic organs 
and aorta, by quantitative analysis of mRNAs encoding proteins in the 
inflammatory cascade. We demonstrate that the TNFα, IL-1β, MCP-1, MIP-2 and IL-6 
mRNA contents are increased in the liver, adipose tissue and aorta 7 months 
after ovariectomy (ovx) and this increased basal inflammation is maintained as 
the mice aged. In contrast, the extent of inflammatory gene expression is 
directly proportional to age in sham-operated mice. As a consequence, at 22 
months, most of the inflammatory parameters examined were higher in the 
sham-operated group compared with the ovx group. These observations led us to 
propose that the decreased longevity of ovx mice may be due to an acceleration 
of the basal state of inflammation in metabolic organs, which is likely driven 
by the combination of a lack of estrogen-mediated anti-inflammatory activity and 
the loss of gonadal control of energy metabolism.

Iceland: health system review.

This analysis of the Icelandic health system reviews the developments in its 
organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health 
reforms and health system performance. Life expectancy at birth is high and 
Icelandic men and women enjoy longer life in good health than the average 
European. However, Icelanders are putting on weight, more than half of adult 
Icelanders were overweight or obese in 2004, and total consumption of alcohol 
has increased considerably since 1970. The health care system is a small, state 
centred, publicly funded system with universal coverage, and an integrated 
purchaser provider relationship in which the state as payer is also the owner of 
most organizations providing health care services. The country's centre of 
clinical excellence is the University Hospital, Landspitali, in the capital 
Reykjavik, which alone accounts for 70 percent of the total national budget for 
general hospital services. However, since 1990, the health system has become 
increasingly characterized by a mixed economy of care and service provision, in 
which the number and scope of private non profit and private for profit 
providers has increased. While Iceland's health outcomes are some of the best 
among OECD countries, the health care system faces challenges involving the 
financial sustainability of the current system in the context of an ageing 
population, new public health challenges, such as obesity, and the continued 
impact of the country's financial collapse in 2008. The most important challenge 
is to change the pattern of health care utilization to steer it away from the 
most expensive end of the health services spectrum towards more cost efficient 
and effective alternatives. To a large degree, this will involve renewed 
attempts to prioritize primary care as the first port of call for patients, and 
possibly to introduce a gatekeeping function for GPs in order to moderate the 
use of specialist services.

How sex and age affect immune responses, susceptibility to infections, and 
response to vaccination.

Do men die young and sick, or do women live long and healthy? By trying to 
explain the sexual dimorphism in life expectancy, both biological and 
environmental aspects are presently being addressed. Besides age-related 
changes, both the immune and the endocrine system exhibit significant 
sex-specific differences. This review deals with the aging immune system and its 
interplay with sex steroid hormones. Together, they impact on the etiopathology 
of many infectious diseases, which are still the major causes of morbidity and 
mortality in people at old age. Among men, susceptibilities toward many 
infectious diseases and the corresponding mortality rates are higher. Responses 
to various types of vaccination are often higher among women thereby also 
mounting stronger humoral responses. Women appear immune-privileged. The major 
sex steroid hormones exhibit opposing effects on cells of both the adaptive and 
the innate immune system: estradiol being mainly enhancing, testosterone by and 
large suppressive. However, levels of sex hormones change with age. At menopause 
transition, dropping estradiol potentially enhances immunosenescence effects 
posing postmenopausal women at additional, yet specific risks. Conclusively 
during aging, interventions, which distinctively consider the changing level of 
individual hormones, shall provide potent options in maintaining optimal immune 
functions.

OBJECTIVE: To critically appraise the quality of sub-Saharan African cancer 
registration systems that submitted data to GLOBOCAN 2008 with respect to 
population coverage using publicly available information and to show the use of 
GLOBOCAN statistics in determining global health priorities.
DESIGN: Sources of cancer registration data for twenty-six sub-Saharan African 
cancer registries were identified from GLOBOCAN 2008 factsheets. Additional 
information was extracted from International Agency for Research on Cancer 
publications. A literature search was conducted to identify studies that 
reported additional information on data collection methods and provided 27 
studies. The websites of the 10 largest funders of development assistance for 
health were searched for GLOBOCAN citations.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six sub-Saharan African cancer registration 
systems submitting data to GLOBOCAN 2008 in relation to 21 countries.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Information on 15 quality variables were extracted and 
compared with the international gold standard for cancer registration systems.
RESULTS: Population coverage of the cancer registries ranged from from 2.3% of 
the population in Kenya to 100% in The Gambia, with a heavy urban bias in all 
countries. However, 20 countries (300 million people) had no cancer registration 
systems. Nineteen of the 26 registries failed to meet more than five of the 15 
quality criteria and only one country met more than 10. Seven of the 10 largest 
funders of development assistance for health cite GLOBOCAN statistics in support 
of policy priorities.
CONCLUSIONS: GLOBOCAN 2008 estimates are based on data drawn from poor quality 
cancer registration systems, with limited or no population registry coverage. It 
is essential the GLOBOCAN 2012 estimates should provide information on the 
quality of the data collection and explain the limitations of the estimates. 
Development organisations and the World Health Organization need to take a more 
cautious approach when using these data to determine priorities and allocating 
resources.

PURPOSE: Each year in France, varicella and zoster affect large numbers of 
children and adults, resulting in medical visits, hospitalizations for 
varicella- and zoster-related complications, and societal costs. Disease 
prevention by varicella vaccination is feasible, wherein a plausible option 
involves replacing the combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine with 
the combined MMR and varicella (MMRV) vaccine. This study aimed to: (1) assess 
the cost-effectiveness of adding routine varicella vaccination through MMRV, 
using different vaccination strategies in France; and (2) address key 
uncertainties, such as the economic consequences of breakthrough varicella 
cases, the waning of vaccine-conferred protection, vaccination coverage, and 
indirect costs.
METHODS: Based on the outputs of a dynamic transmission model that used data on 
epidemiology and costs from France, a cost-effectiveness model was built. A 
conservative approach was taken regarding the impact of varicella vaccination on 
zoster incidence by assuming the validity of the hypothesis of an age-specific 
boosting of immunity against varicella.
FINDINGS: The model determined that routine MMRV vaccination is expected to be a 
cost-effective option, considering a cost-effectiveness threshold of €20,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year saved; routine vaccination was cost-saving from the 
societal perspective. Results were driven by a large decrease in varicella 
incidence despite a temporary initial increase in the number of zoster cases due 
to the assumption of exogenous boosting. In the scenario analyses, despite 
moderate changes in assumptions about incidence and costs, varicella vaccination 
remained a cost-effective option for France.
IMPLICATIONS: Routine vaccination with MMRV was associated with high gains in 
quality-adjusted life-years, substantial reduction in the occurrences of 
varicella- and zoster-related complications, and few deaths due to varicella. 
Routine MMRV vaccination is also expected to provide reductions in costs related 
to hospitalizations, medication use, and general-practitioner visits, as well as 
indirect costs, and it is expected to be a cost-effective intervention in France 
(GSK study identifier: HO-12-6924).

AIM: Initiating antipsychotic medication frequently induces rapid, clinically 
significant weight gain. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a lifestyle 
and life skills intervention, delivered within 4 weeks of antipsychotic 
medication initiation, in attenuating weight gain in youth aged 14-25 years with 
first-episode psychosis (FEP).
METHODS: We undertook a prospective, controlled study in two early psychosis 
community services. Intervention participants (n = 16) received a 12-week 
individualized intervention delivered by specialist clinical staff (nurse, 
dietician and exercise physiologist) and youth peer wellness coaches, in 
addition to standard care. A comparison group was recruited from a similar 
service and received standard care (n = 12).
RESULTS: The intervention group experienced significantly less weight gain at 12 
weeks compared to standard care (1.8 kg, 95% CI -0.4 to 2.8 vs. 7.8 kg, 
4.8-10.7, P < 0.001). Thirteen per cent (2/16) of the intervention group 
experienced clinically significant weight gain (greater than 7% of baseline 
weight), while 75% (9/12) of the standard care group experienced this level of 
weight gain. Similar positive effects of the intervention were observed for 
waist circumference.
CONCLUSIONS: A lifestyle and life skills intervention delivered as part of 
standard care attenuated antipsychotic-induced weight gain in young people with 
FEP. The intervention was acceptable to the young people referred to the 
service. Such interventions may prevent the seeding of future disease risk and 
in the long-term help reduce the life expectancy gap for people living with 
serious mental illness.

BACKGROUND: Ischaemic stroke (IS), brain haemorrhage and cerebral venous 
thrombosis can occur as an early and late complication of cancer in the clinical 
course. Cancer patients are at increased risk for stroke from direct and 
indirect effects of their malignancy.
AIMS: The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between neoplastic 
disease and the long-term outcome, mortality and the presence of haemorrhagic 
complications in patients with acute IS treated with i.v. thrombolysis.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the demographic and clinical data of 495 
Caucasian patients with acute IS and 40 patients with IS and concomitant 
neoplastic disease who were consecutively treated from 2006 to 2013 in two 
experienced stroke centres.
RESULTS: In analysed group, there were 7.8% of patients with cancer [50.0% male, 
mean age 72.3 ± 9.3; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale - 13 (range 
9.5-17)]. Cancer was diagnosed before i.v.-thrombolysis in 28 (70.0%) patients. 
After 3 months of follow up, 60% of patients were independent (mRS 0-2) compared 
with the group of patients without cancer - 55% (p = 0.54), 17.5% died (18.4%; p 
= 0.89), 12.4% suffered haemorrhagic transformation (HT) (17.6%; p = 0.41) and 
2.5% experienced SICH (4.4%; p = 0.56, respectively). Other clinical 
complications were not found. A multivariate analysis showed no impact of 
neoplastic disease on unfavourable outcomes [modified Rankin scale 3-6)] after 3 
months (p = 0.15).
CONCLUSION: Intravenous thrombolysis performed in Caucasian stroke patients with 
past or current neoplastic diseases, but not in the course of chemo- and 
radiotherapy, can be a safe and effective method of treatment. In making 
decision on the thrombolytic treatment, the risk of bleeding complications and 
the life expectancy should be assessed.

BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common complication associated with kidney failure and 
is marked by poor health and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. There 
are ongoing concerns with the use of Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents (ESAs) to 
treat anemia in patients with kidney failure on dialysis. Questions as to their 
benefits, harms and overall effect on quality of life are still relevant today. 
Our objective was to systematically review studies evaluating the 
cost-effectiveness of ESAs in patients with kidney failure on dialysis.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of studies determining the 
cost-effectiveness of ESAs in adult patients on dialysis. Databases, including 
PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, were searched from 
their establishment until June 2013. Studies that reported an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of hemoglobin correction strategies based on ESA 
treatments in comparison to red blood cell transfusions, lower hemoglobin 
targets, or no ESA treatment were included.
RESULTS: Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Reported cost/quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) ratios ranged from USD 931-677,749/QALY across five studies 
comparing ESAs to red blood cell transfusions. There was heterogeneity in 
results when considering higher hemoglobin targets, with studies finding higher 
targets to be both dominant and dominated. Mortality, hospitalization, and 
utility estimates were major drivers.
CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variability in the estimates of the 
cost-effectiveness of using ESAs in the dialysis population. New models 
incorporating recent meta-analyses for estimates of utility, mortality, and 
hospitalization changes would allow for a more comprehensive answer to this 
question.

Twitching motility depends on the adhesion of type IV pili (T4P) to a substrate, 
with cell movement driven by extension and retraction of the pili. The mechanism 
of twitching motility, and the events that lead to a reversal of direction, are 
best understood in rod-shaped bacteria such as Myxococcus xanthus. In M. 
xanthus, the direction of movement depends on the unipolar localization of the 
pilus extension and retraction motors PilB and PilT to opposite cell poles. 
Reversal of direction results from relocalization of PilB and PilT. Some 
cyanobacteria utilize twitching motility for phototaxis. Here, we examine 
twitching motility in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which has a 
spherical cell shape without obvious polarity. We use a motile Synechocystis sp. 
PCC 6803 strain expressing a functional GFP-tagged PilB1 protein to show that 
PilB1 tends to localize in 'crescents' adjacent to a specific region of the 
cytoplasmic membrane. Crescents are more prevalent under the low-light 
conditions that favour phototactic motility, and the direction of motility 
strongly correlates with the orientation of the crescent. We conclude that the 
direction of twitching motility in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is controlled by 
the localization of the T4P apparatus, as it is in M. xanthus. The PilB1 
crescents in the spherical cells of Synechocystis can be regarded as being 
equivalent to the leading pole in the rod-shaped cells.

Recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is utilized for on-demand treatment of bleeding 
episodes in hemophilia patients with neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) 
against Factor VIII or Factor IX, but a short half-life in the circulation 
(~2.5hrs) limits its use in a prophylactic setting. Recombinant FVIIa variants 
with improved pharmacokinetic properties may enable improved treatment and 
prevention of bleeding episodes in the inhibitor population. In this study we 
describe recombinant FVIIaFc (rFVIIaFc), a recombinant Fc-fusion protein 
generated to utilize the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated recycling pathway 
that protects immunoglobulin G from catabolism. On the basis of activity, 
rFVIIaFc exhibited a 5.5-fold extension in terminal half-life in hemophilia A 
mice compared to rFVIIa. The potency of rFVIIaFc was comparable to that of 
rFVIIa in thrombin generation assay and ROTEM. In agreement with these data, 
rFVIIaFc and rFVIIa showed similar acute efficacy at comparable molar doses in 
the tail clip bleeding model in hemophilia A mice. Taken together, these studies 
demonstrate enhanced pharmacokinetics and similar hemostatic properties for 
rFVIIaFc compared to rFVIIa.

AIM: To update and improve estimates of morbidity and mortality due to alcohol 
consumption in New Zealand.
METHOD: We applied the comparative risk assessment methods of the Global Burden 
of Disease Study at country level, and separately for Maori and non-Maori where 
possible. Analysis was restricted to 0-79 year olds.
RESULTS: We estimated 5.4% of all deaths under 80 years old were attributable to 
alcohol in 2007 (802 deaths) and these represented 13,769 years of life lost 
(YLLs). Injuries accounted for 43%, cancer for 30% and other diseases for 27% of 
deaths. We also calculated 351 deaths were averted by alcohol use, but only 3095 
YLLs, resulting in a net annual loss of more than 10,000 years of life. Sex and 
ethnic disparities were marked, with twice as many deaths in men as women for 
both Maori and non- Maori, and the age-standardised death rate for Maori two and 
a half times the rate for non-Maori. Injury was the biggest cause of 
alcohol-related deaths and YLLs in the young and overall, but the leading cause 
of alcohol-related death in both Maori and non-Maori women was breast cancer. We 
estimated 6.5% of all healthy life lost among 0-79 year olds in 2004 was 
attributable to alcohol (28,403 DALYs lost), and 6538 DALYs were prevented. The 
sex disparity in DALYs lost mirrored the mortality analysis, but no 
disaggregation by ethnicity was possible.
CONCLUSION: Alcohol consumption results in substantial loss of good health 
across the life course in New Zealand. It makes an important contribution to 
Maori/non-Maori and male/female health disparities. High average consumption and 
heavy drinking occasions confer the greatest risk of harm to the drinker and 
others. At a population level there are no documented health benefits of 
drinking before middle-age and benefits in later life are increasingly 
uncertain.

The maintenance of high social competence despite stress was examined in a 
6-month prospective study of 138 inner-city ninth-grade students. The purpose 
was to provide a replication and extension of findings derived from previous 
cross-sectional research involving a comparable sample of children. 
Specifically, goals were to examine the extent to which high-stress children 
with superior functioning on one or more aspects of school-based social 
competence could evade significant difficulties in (a) other spheres of 
competence at school and (b) emotional adjustment. Measurements of stress were 
based on uncontrollable negative life events. Competence was assessed via 
behavioral indices including school grades, teacher ratings, and peer ratings, 
and emotional distress was measured via self-reports. Results indicated that 
high-stress children who showed impressive behavioral competence were highly 
vulnerable to emotional distress over time. Furthermore, almost 85% of the 
high-stress children who seemed resilient based on at least one domain of social 
competence at Time 1 had significant difficulties in one or more domains 
examined when assessed at both Time 1 and Time 2. Findings are discussed in 
terms of conceptual and empirical issues in resilience research.

OBJECT Spinal metastasis is common in patients with cancer. About 70% of 
symptomatic lesions are found in the thoracic region of the spine, and cord 
compression presents as the initial symptom in 5%-10% of patients. Minimally 
invasive spine surgery (MISS) has recently been advocated as a useful approach 
for spinal metastases, with the aim of decreasing the morbidity associated with 
more traditional open spine surgery; furthermore, the recovery time is reduced 
after MISS, such that postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy can begin 
sooner. METHODS Two series of oncological patients, who presented with acute 
myelopathy due to vertebral thoracic metastases, were compared in this study. 
Patients with complete paraplegia for more than 24 hours and with a modified 
Bauer score greater than 2 were excluded from the study. The first group (n = 
23) comprised patients who were prospectively enrolled from May 2010 to 
September 2013, and who were treated with minimally invasive 
laminotomy/laminectomy and percutaneous stabilization. The second group (n = 19) 
comprised patients from whom data were retrospectively collected before May 
2010, and who had been treated with laminectomy and stabilization with 
traditional open surgery. Patient groups were similar regarding general 
characteristics and neurological impairment. Results were analyzed in terms of 
neurological recovery (American Spinal Injury Association grade), complications, 
pain relief (visual analog scale), and quality of life (European Organisation 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BM22 scales) 
at the 30-day follow-up. Operation time, postoperative duration of bed rest, 
duration of hospitalization, intraoperative blood loss, and the need and length 
of postoperative opioid administration were also evaluated. RESULTS There were 
no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of neurological 
recovery and complications. Nevertheless, the MISS group showed a clear and 
significant improvement in terms of blood loss, operation time, and bed rest 
length, which is associated with a more rapid functional recovery and discharge 
from the hospital. Postoperative pain and the need for opioid administration 
were also significantly less pronounced in the MISS group. Results from the 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BM22 scales showed a more pronounced improvement in 
quality of life at follow-up in the MISS group. CONCLUSIONS In the authors' 
opinion, MISS techniques should be considered the first choice for the treatment 
for patients with spinal metastasis and myelopathy. MISS is as safe and 
effective for spinal cord decompression and spine fixation as traditional 
surgery, and it also reduces the impact of surgery in critical patients. 
However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a highly morbid 
disorder. The most severe form of CKD is end-stage renal disease (ESRD), in 
which the patient requires some form of renal replacement therapy to survive. 
The increasing incidence, prevalence, and costs of ESRD are major national 
healthcare concerns. The objective of this study was to determine the cost 
effectiveness of two innovative therapies, paricalcitol versus cinacalcet + 
calcitriol (oral) in patients with CKD stage 5 (CKD 5) in the healthcare setting 
in Italy in 2013.
METHODS: A Markov process model was developed employing data sources from the 
published literature, paricalcitol clinical trials, official Italian 
price/tariff lists, and national population statistics. The analysis is based on 
a comparison of treatment with paricalcitol versus cinacalcet + calcitriol 
(oral) in CKD 5. The perspective of the study was that of the payer [Italian 
National Health Service (INHS)]. The primary efficacy outcomes in the 
paricalcitol and cinacalcet + calcitriol (oral) clinical trials (reduction of 
secondary hyperparathyroidism, complications, and mortality) were extrapolated 
to effectiveness outcomes: number of life-years gained (LYG) and number of 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Clinical and economic outcomes were 
discounted at 3 %.
RESULTS: The base-case analysis is based on a 5-year time horizon. From the INHS 
perspective, the use of paricalcitol leads to a cost saving of €1,853 and an 
increase in LYG (0.136) and a gain in QALYs (0.089). Consequently, the use of 
paricalcitol is dominant over the use of combination cinacalcet + calcitriol 
(oral paricalcitol leads to cost savings and a higher effectiveness). 
Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that the favorable clinical benefit of 
paricalcitol results in positive health economic benefits. This study suggests 
that the use of paricalcitol in patients with ESRD may be cost effective from 
the perspective of the INHS.
