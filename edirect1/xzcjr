BACKGROUND: Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) has been shown to be a valuable 
tool for the anatomoelectroclinical definition of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) in 
patients with medically refractory epilepsy considered for surgery (RES 
patients). In Spain, many of those patients are not offered this diagnostic 
procedure.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of SEEG 
to define the EZ in RES patients compared to no SEEG intervention, ie, remaining 
with further antiepileptic drugs.
METHODS: We undertook a systematic review with meta-analyses on the 
effectiveness and safety of SEEG. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted 
using a Markov model, which simulates the costs and health outcomes of 
individuals for a lifetime horizon from the perspective of the Spanish National 
Health Service. The effectiveness measure was quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs). We ran extensive sensitivity analyses, including a probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: The EZ was found in 92% of patients who underwent SEEG (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.87-0.96); 72% were eligible for epilepsy surgery (95% CI: 
0.66-0.78) and 33% were free of seizures after surgery (95% CI: 0.27-0.42). Of 
the patients who underwent surgery, 47% were free of seizures after surgery (95% 
CI: 0.37-0.58). Complications related to implantation and monitoring of SEEG and 
the subsequent intervention occurred in 1.3% of patients (95% CI: 0.01-0.02). In 
the base case analysis, SEEG led to higher QALYs and healthcare costs with an 
estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 10 368 EUR per QALY (95% CI: 
dominant-113 911), making the probability of cost-effectiveness between 75% and 
88%. Further sensitivity analyses showed that the results of the study were 
robust.
CONCLUSION: SEEG is a cost-effective technology in RES patients when compared to 
no SEEG intervention.

PURPOSE: Patients over the age of 80 years when diagnosed with an unruptured 
intracranial aneurysm (UIA) pose unique decision-making challenges due to 
shortened life-expectancy and increased risk of treatment. Thus, we investigated 
the risk of rupture and survival of a consecutive series of patients who were 
diagnosed with an UIA after the age of 80 years.
METHODS: Data of consecutive patients with an UIA were reviewed, and patients 
were included in our study if they were first evaluated for a UIA by the senior 
author during their ninth decade of life. Outcomes were aneurysm rupture and 
overall survival after diagnosis. Survival was estimated from a Kaplan-Meier 
survival curve. Incidence of risk factors was compared to a population of 
patients less than 65 years who were seen by the senior author over the same 
time period.
RESULTS: Eighty-three patients who were over 80 years when diagnosed with a UIA 
were included in this study. In our population, there is a risk of rupture of 
3.2% per patient-year. One-, three-, and five-year survival rates for our 
population were estimated to be 92, 64, and 35%, respectively. When compared to 
patients under 65 years diagnosed with a UIA, "over 80" patients had a 
significantly higher incidence of hypertension, and a significantly lower 
incidence of smoking history and familial aneurysm history.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study population, UIAs greater than 7 mm carry a 
non-negligible risk of rupture of 3.2% per patient-year, and further studies 
investigating the risk-to-benefit ratio of treatment in this population are 
warranted.

PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate clinical outcomes including progression-free 
survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), partial response, and complete response 
in patients who underwent radiation therapy (RT) for mycosis fungoides (MF). 
Also, we sought to find prognostic factors for clinical outcomes. Materials and.
METHODS: Total 19 patients confirmed with MF between 1999-2015 were 
retrospectively reviewed. Clinical and treatment characteristics, clinical 
outcomes, and and toxicities were analyzed.
RESULTS: Eleven patients were treated with total skin electron beam radiotherapy 
(TSEBT) and 8 patients with involved field radiation therapy (IFRT) with median 
dose of 30 Gy, respectively. The median time interval from diagnosis to RT was 
2.6 months (range, 0.4 to 87.3 months). The overall response rate was 100%; 11 
patients (57.9%) had a complete response and 8 patients (42.1%) a partial 
response. The presence of positive lymph node at the time of consultation of RT 
was associated with lower OS (p = 0.043). In multivariate analysis, PFS was 
significantly lower for patients with increased previous therapies experienced 
following RT (p = 0.019) and for patients showing PR during RT (p = 0.044). 
There were no reported grade 3 or more skin toxicities related with RT.
CONCLUSION: Both IFRT and TSEBT are effective treatment for MF patients. 
Patients with short disease course before RT or complete response during RT are 
expected to have longer PFS. Positive lymph node status at the initiation of RT 
was associated woth poor OS, suggesting other treatment modalities such as 
low-dose RT for patients with low life-expectancy.

Schizophrenia is a severe chronic mental disorder that mainly manifests by 
positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized behavior and thought and 
cognitive impairments. Taken together, these symptoms have substantial impact on 
quality of life, well-being and functional outcome. Patients with schizophrenia 
have dramatically higher levels of cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity than 
the general population due to poor physical fitness and to sedentary lifestyle. 
They have a reduced life expectancy, and an excess mortality being two or three 
times more than that in the general population. Moreover, despite major 
therapeutic advances in the overall management of these patients, some 
symptomatic dimensions, and more specifically the negative and cognitive ones, 
remain to be resistant to the usual pharmacological approaches. Moreover, 
antipsychotics can also reinforce the global cardiovascular risk due to side 
effects and low neurometabolic tolerance. The benefits of physical activity on 
health are now well described in the general population and in many medical 
diseases. More recently, physical activity has also found its place as an 
adjuvant therapy in severe mental illnesses, particularly in schizophrenia. In 
the literature physical activity programs, in addition to pharmacological 
treatments, appear to be feasible in patients and improve both physical and 
mental health as well as functional outcome. Clinical benefits of physical 
activity would be underpinned by biological and cerebral mechanisms, which 
remain unclear. In this review, we propose to present a state of the art and to 
present an update of the interests of physical activity in the management of 
patients with schizophrenia. We emphasize the clinical benefits of physical 
activity regarding the different symptomatic dimensions and its impact 
specifically on cognitive deficits. Finally, we describe the various underlying 
pathophysiological mechanisms in particular in the neurobiological, cerebral and 
physiological fields. We then discuss the barriers, facilitators and motivating 
factors towards physical activity to enhance health promotion initiatives, to 
optimize resource allocation when delivering physical activity programs in 
clinical practice, and to maximize physical activity participation. Physical 
activity appears to be an original and novel adjunctive therapeutic approach in 
the management of patients with schizophrenia and would both reduce 
schizophrenic symptoms and act like pro-cognitive therapy, improve quality of 
life and long-term functioning in daily life and reduce cardiovascular 
comorbidities. However, efforts are still needed to increase the motivating 
factors and adherence towards physical activity participation for people with 
schizophrenia.

Early temporary reimbursement (ETR) schemes for new interventions targeting high 
unmet needs are increasingly applied in pharmaceutical policy. Crucial for these 
schemes is the assessment of unmet healthcare needs of patients and society. 
This study develops and tests a multi-criteria decision approach (MCDA) for 
assessing therapeutic and societal needs. The Belgian unmet needs commission, 
responsible for creating a list of unmet needs for the ETR programme, has tested 
this methodology to assess the needs in eight health conditions. For therapeutic 
need, three criteria were included (impact of the condition on quality of life 
and on life expectancy and inconvenience of current treatment); for societal 
need two criteria (condition-related healthcare expenditures per patient, 
prevalence). The results show that the proposed MCDA is feasible and acceptable 
for the unmet needs commission. Clear definitions of the criteria and regular 
repetition of these is needed to avoid variable interpretation of the criteria 
by the commission members. Quality assessment of the evidence is desired. 
Rankings resulting from the application have face validity. Considering 
therapeutic need separately from societal need is considered appropriate. Policy 
makers should consider the use of MCDA in assessing healthcare needs. MCDA 
improves the transparency and accountability of the decision making processes 
and is practical and feasible.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite evidence of the benefits of radiotherapy (RT) in 
the treatment of cancer patients, its underutilisation has been reported for 
various tumour sites. The aim of this study was to estimate survival shortfall, 
'years of potential life lost' (YPLL) and 'disability-adjusted life years lost' 
(DALY) to demonstrate the impact of radiotherapy underutilisation in Australia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Optimal and actual RT utilisation (RTU) was compared to 
assess RT underutilisation to estimate 5-year overall survival shortfall using 
2006 data from New South Wales (NSW) for 26 common tumour sites. 5-year overall 
survival shortfall is defined as number of people not surviving for 5-years due 
to RT underutilisation [=benefit proportion × shortfall [(optimal-actual 
RTU)/optimal RTU] proportion × No. of new cases]. YPLL = survival 
shortfall × estimated years of life lost per person (overall life 
expectancy - median age at death for specific cancer). DALY = (Years lived with 
disability + Years of life lost) × survival shortfall.
RESULTS: The total number of new cases with cancer in 2006 in NSW was 20,741. 
Optimal RTU was 48% while actual RTU was 26%, resulting in estimated of 411 
deaths due to underutilisation. Each death resulted in an average of 10.4 YPLL 
and 17.5 DALY. It was estimated RT underutilisation resulted in a total of 4,289 
YPLL and 7,192 DALY overall.
CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the value of considering different mortality 
statistics, which include measures of the burden of cancer deaths on both the 
population and patients.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the effectiveness and 
costs of the occupation-based practice for community dwelling frail elderly.
DESIGN: Pilot pre-post design without a control group.
SETTING: A care management center involving 37 local elderly.
SUBJECT: The final analysis included 26 frail elderly in a community dwelling 
center.
INTERVENTION: The intervention was occupation-based practice involving setting 
of client-centered goals, observation of real living situations, and provision 
of advice on the individual problem of real occupation.
OUTCOME: The outcome was the Frenchay Activities Index (FAI), which is used to 
evaluate the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Additionally, the 
frequency, duration, and cost of the intervention were calculated.
RESULTS: Regarding the FAI score before and after the interventions, there were 
significant improvements in all items except work (P<0.05, effect size [r]: 
0.67-0.93). A total of 15 people out of 26 (57.7%) showed improvement in 
activities of daily living. The frequency of interventions was 3.7 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 2.83-4.48), and the duration was 7.4 weeks (95% CI: 
5.27-9.42). The average intervention cost was $258 (95% CI: 200.4-317.4).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that occupation-based practice has 
a potential to improve IADL in frail elderly, with low frequency of 
intervention, within a short-term, and direct cost reduction. We believe that 
this pilot study will contribute to future clinical studies for frail elderly, 
and the findings can be easily applied to daily clinical intervention. A 
well-designed prospective randomized-controlled trial is necessary to verify 
these results.

BACKGROUND: Red ginseng is a popularly used traditional medicine with antiaging 
effects in Asian countries. The present study aimed to explore the changes in 
protein expression underlying the mechanisms of life span extension and 
antiaging caused by red ginseng extract (RGE) in Drosophila melanogaster.
METHODS: A proteomic approach of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to identify the differential abundance of 
possible target proteins of RGE in D. melanogaster. The reliability of the 2-DE 
results was confirmed via Western blotting to measure the expression levels of 
selected proteins. Proteins altered at the expression level after RGE treatment 
(1 mg/mL) were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of 
flight tandem mass spectrometry and by searching against the National Center for 
Biotechnology nonredundant and Uniprot protein databases. The differentially 
expressed proteins were analyzed using bioinformatics methods.
RESULTS: The average survival life span of D. melanogaster was significantly 
extended by 12.60% with RGE treatment (1 mg/mL) compared to untreated flies. 
This followed increased superoxide dismutase level and decreased methane 
dicarboxylic aldehyde content. Based on the searching strategy, 23 
differentially expressed proteins were identified (16 up-regulated and 7 
down-regulated) in the RGE-treated D. melanogaster. Transduction pathways were 
identified using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database, and 
included the hippo and oxidative phosphorylation pathways that play important 
roles in life span extension and antiaging process of D. melanogaster.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with RGE in D. melanogaster demonstrated that mechanisms 
of life span extension and antiaging are regulated by multiple factors and 
complicated signal pathways.

University for Health Sciences, College of Medicine, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

INTRODUCTION: Vici syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, was first 
described in 1988 by Vici et al. Only 78 cases have been reported to date. The 
syndrome is characterised by agenesis of the corpus callosum, hypopigmentation, 
cardiomyopathy, progressive failure to thrive, dysmorphic features, 
immunodeficiency and cataracts. Mutations in the gene epg5 have been identified 
as the cause of Vici syndrome.
CASE DESCRIPTION: The parents are a consanguineous Saudi couple with two other 
children diagnosed with Gaucher disease. The patient was born at term and in the 
first 5 months had many hospital admissions for a recurrent chest infection. 
Physical examination, investigations and imaging studies revealed that the 
patient had agenesis of the corpus callosum, cataracts, psychomotor delay, 
immunodeficiency and hypopigmentation. The initial echocardiogram was normal. At 
7 months, genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of Vici syndrome with a 
c.3693G>Ap (Gln1231Gln) mutation in the gene EPG5. The patient developed a chest 
infection and was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. An 
echocardiogram was repeated and showed significant left ventricular dilation 
with a Z-score of 3.1, moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and 
depressed ventricular function with a fractional shortening of 17% and ejection 
fraction 37%. The patient's condition deteriorated, and he died aged 8 months.
CONCLUSION: The symptoms of extensive system involvement in Vici syndrome have 
been present in the majority of reported cases and should prompt careful 
evaluation of this syndrome when such symptoms are present in an infant. In 
confirmed cases, close monitoring of the immune status and cardiac function, the 
two main causes of death among Vici syndrome patients, is vital to prevent rapid 
deterioration and improve life expectancy.

The effect of ice coverage comprised of Reshgak extract and Reshgak essential 
oil on shelf-life extension of chilled whole rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) 
was evaluated. Chemical (peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acids (TBA), total 
volatile nitrogen base (TVB-N), and free fatty acids (FFA)), microbiological 
(total viable count (TVC) and psychrotrophic viable count (PVC)), and sensory 
evaluations (texture, color, flavor, and general acceptance) were investigated 
every 4 days during a 20-day storage period. Results revealed that the effect of 
both icing systems led to considerably lower bacterial counts and chemical 
indices in comparison with the traditional ice coverage without such phytogenic. 
According to sensory analyses, fish stored in ice containing Reshgak essential 
oil had a longer shelf-life (>16 days) and those stored in ice medium included 
with Reshgak extract possessed a shelf-life of 16 days, whereas lot stored in 
traditional ice showed a shorter shelf-life of 12 days.

Polynucleotide phosphorylase is a highly conserved protein found in bacteria and 
fungi that can regulate the transcription of related enzymes involved in amino 
acid metabolism, organic acid metabolism, and cell biosynthesis. We studied the 
effect of polynucleotide phosphorylase on Saccharopolyspora pogona (S. pogona) 
growth and the synthesis of secondary metabolites. First, we generated the 
overexpression vector pOJ260-PermE-pnp via overlap extension PCR. The vector 
pOJ260-PermE-pnp was then introduced into S. pogona by conjugal transfer, 
thereby generating the recombination strain S. pogona-Pnp. Results showed that 
engineering strains possessed higher biomass than those of the wild-type 
strains. Moreover, the ability of these strains to produce spores on solid 
medium was stronger than that of the wild-type strains. HPLC results revealed 
that the butenyl-spinosyn yield in S. pogona-Pnp increased by 1.92-fold compared 
with that of S. pogona alone. These findings revealed that overexpression of 
polynucleotide phosphorylase effectively promoted butenyl-spinosyn biosynthesis 
in S. pogona. This result may be extended to other Streptomyces for strain 
improvement.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a disorder with variable expression caused by 
framedisrupting mutations in the dystrophin gene. It is characterized by 
progressive muscle weakness and dilated cardiomyopathy. In-frame dystrophin 
mutations cause a clinically moderate disorder named Becker muscular dystrophy. 
Our aim was to study the clinical and genetic characteristics of a family with 
inherited cardiomyopathy and Becker muscular dystrophy. The index case was 
diagnosed with psychomotor retardation at 5 years of age. Asymmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy and a long QT interval were evidenced at the age of 12. 
Mild muscular weakness was developed subsequently. Three genetic variants were 
identified in the index case: p.Arg891Alafs*160 in the MYBPC3 gene, p.Thr263Met 
in the KCNJ5 gene, and p.Ser2437_Ile2554delinsPhe in the DMD gene. The latter 
was expected to generate an in-frame deletion of exons 51 and 52 of the 
dystrophin gene. A family study revealed that the father and 3 uncles were 
carriers of the MYBPC3 mutation. The mother and a maternal grandfather were 
carriers of the other 2 variants. The 80-year-old grandfather, who had the 
dystrophin mutation, showed no sign of cardiomyopathy or muscular weakness. The 
deletion of exons 51 and 52 in the DMD gene, which has been proposed as one of 
the therapeutic strategies for Duchenne, is consistent with a normal life 
expectancy and the absence of myopathic symptoms in hemizygous males.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have concluded 
that eliminating the public health problem of chronic hepatitis B is feasible. 
We examined the economic and public health impact of reaching the World Health 
Organization targets of having 90 percent of chronic hepatitis B cases diagnosed 
and 80 percent being treated by 2030 in the United States with an annual 
incremental increase in screening and treatment rates. To reach the targets by 
2030 would require screening approximately 14.5 million adults in at-risk 
populations to diagnose an estimated 870,000 undiagnosed cases and would result 
in substantial health gains: an increase of 16.5 million quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), and reductions in liver-related deaths of 37 percent and in 
cases of compensated cirrhosis of 24 percent, decompensated liver cirrhosis of 
51 percent, and liver cancer of 35 percent. Achieving the targets by 2030 would 
be highly cost-effective at $103 per QALY and would be cost-saving if the 
antiviral drug price were no more than $114 per month. Achieving them by 2025 
would be cost-saving and would reduce liver-related deaths by 47 percent.

The corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is only 
moderately susceptible to most toxins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis 
(Bt) expressed in transgenic corn. To better understand the impact of Bt corn on 
the life cycle of H. zea, we collected pupae of H. zea during 2014-2016 in North 
Carolina, South Carolina, and Mississippi from corn hybrids expressing Cry1Ab, 
Cry1F, Cry1F + Cry1Ab, Cry1F + Cry1Ab + Vip3Aa20, Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2, and 
Cry1A.105 + Cry2Ab2 + Cry1F, as well as from non-Bt near-isolines. We 
investigated the effect of Bt corn on pupal weight, fecundity, and egg viability 
of H. zea. Pupal weights were significantly reduced for males and females from 
all Bt hybrids compared with non-Bt near-isolines. Female pupae from the hybrid 
expressing Cry1F + Cry1Ab were also significantly lighter relative to those from 
the near-isolines expressing only Cry1F. Reductions in pupal weight did not 
result in any detectable effects on fecundity or egg viability. The reduction in 
pupal weight in the hybrids expressing Cry1F and Cry1F + Cry1Ab significantly 
declined over time in South Carolina, possibly indicating developing resistance 
to these Bt toxins. These data can be incorporated into insect resistance 
management models used to improve risk management decisions regarding H. zea in 
Bt crops in the complex landscapes of the southern United States.

    Kidney Int. 2019 Sep;96(3):535-537.

BACKGROUND: Direct-acting antiviral agents are now available to treat chronic 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD).
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether it is more cost-effective to transplant 
HCV-infected or HCV-uninfected kidneys into HCV-infected patients.
DESIGN: Markov state-transition decision model.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE searches and bibliographies from relevant English-language 
articles.
TARGET POPULATION: HCV-infected patients with ESRD receiving hemodialysis in the 
United States.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care system.
INTERVENTION: Transplant of an HCV-infected kidney followed by HCV treatment 
versus transplant of an HCV-uninfected kidney preceded by HCV treatment.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Effectiveness, measured in quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs), and costs, measured in 2017 U.S. dollars.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Transplant of an HCV-infected kidney followed by 
HCV treatment was more effective and less costly than transplant of an 
HCV-uninfected kidney preceded by HCV treatment, largely because of longer wait 
times for uninfected kidneys. A typical 57.8-year-old patient receiving 
hemodialysis would gain an average of 0.50 QALY at a lifetime cost savings of 
$41 591.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Transplant of an HCV-infected kidney followed 
by HCV treatment continued to be preferred in sensitivity analyses of many model 
parameters. Transplant of an HCV-uninfected kidney preceded by HCV treatment was 
not preferred unless the additional wait time for an uninfected kidney was less 
than 161 days.
LIMITATION: The study did not consider the benefit of decreased HCV transmission 
from treating HCV-infected patients.
CONCLUSION: Transplanting HCV-infected kidneys into HCV-infected patients 
increased quality-adjusted life expectancy and reduced costs compared with 
transplanting HCV-uninfected kidneys into HCV-infected patients.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate how innovation is defined 
with respect to new medicines.
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and EconLit databases were searched for articles 
published between January 1, 2010 and May 25, 2016 that described a relevant 
definition of innovation. Identified definitions were analyzed by mapping the 
concepts described onto a set of ten dimensions of innovation.
RESULTS: In total, thirty-six articles were included, and described a total of 
twenty-five different definitions of innovation. The most commonly occurring 
dimension was therapeutic benefit, with novelty and the availability of existing 
treatments the second and third most common dimensions. Overall, there was 
little agreement in the published literature on what characteristics of new 
medicines constitute rewardable innovation.
CONCLUSIONS: Alignment across countries and among regulators, health technology 
assessment bodies and payers would help manufacturers define research policies 
that can drive innovation, but may be challenging, as judgements about what 
aspects of innovation should be rewarded vary among stakeholders, and depend on 
political and societal factors.

BACKGROUND: In 2005, the European Union (EU) started to use a disability-free 
life expectancy, known as Healthy Life Years (HLY), to monitor progress in the 
strategic European policies such as the 2000 Lisbon strategy. HLY are based on 
the underlying measure: the Global Activity Limitation Indicator (GALI). Twelve 
years after its implementation, this study aims to assess its current use in EU 
Member States and the European Commission.
METHODS: In March 2017, a questionnaire was sent to 28 Member states and the 
European Commission. The questionnaire inquired how the GALI and HLY are used to 
set policy targets, in which surveys the GALI has been introduced since 2005, 
how the GALI and HLY are presented, and what the capacity in each country is to 
investigate the GALI and HLY.
RESULTS: The survey was answered by 22 Member States and by the Commission. HLY 
are often used to set targets and develop strategies in health such as national 
health plans. Analysis of HLY has even led to policy change. In some countries, 
HLY have become the main indicator for health, gaining more importance than life 
expectancy. More recently, the GALI and HLY have also been used for policy 
targets outside the health sector such as in the area of pension and retirement 
age or in the context of sustainable development. Regarding surveys, the GALI is 
mostly obtained from the EU-SILC, SHARE and EHIS, but is also increasingly 
introduced in national surveys. National health reporting systems usually 
present HLY on their national statistics websites. Most countries have up to 
three specialists working on the GALI and HLY, which has been consistent through 
time. Others have increased their capacity over various institutions.
CONCLUSION: HLY is an indicator that is systematically used to monitor health 
developments in most EU countries. The SHARE, EU-SILC and EHIS are commonly used 
to assess HLY through the GALI. The results are then described in reports and 
presented on national statistics websites and used in different policy settings. 
Expertise to analyse the GALI and HLY is available in most countries.

The ensuing upward shift in demographic distribution due to the increase in life 
expectancy has resulted in a rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
heavy public burden of AD, along with the urgent to prevent and treat the 
disease before the irreversible damage to the brain, calls for a sensitive and 
specific screening technology to identify high-risk individuals before cognitive 
symptoms arise. Even though current modalities, such as positron emission 
tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker, showed their potential 
clinical uses in early detection of AD, the high cost, narrow isotope 
availability of PET probes and invasive characteristics of CSF biomarker limited 
their broad utility. Therefore, additional tools for detection of AD are needed. 
As a projection of the central nervous system (CNS), the retina has been 
described as a "window to the brain" and a novel marker for AD. Low cost, easy 
accessibility and non-invasive features make retina tests suitable for 
large-scale population screening and investigations of preclinical AD. 
Furthermore, a number of novel approaches in retina imaging, such as optical 
coherence tomography (OCT), have been developed and made it possible to 
visualize changes in the retina at a very fine resolution. In this review, we 
outline the background for AD to accelerate the adoption of retina imaging for 
the diagnosis and management of AD in clinical practice. Then, we focus on 
recent findings on the application of retina imaging to investigate AD and 
provide suggestions for future research directions.

Successful Endovascular Management of a Case of Aorto-oesophageal Fistula 
Presenting as Life Threatening Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed.

Health System, Singapore.

INTRODUCTION: Aorto-oesophageal fistula is a rare but life threatening cause of 
upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Severity of presentation and complexity of 
subsequent management depends on the size of the defect on both the aortic side 
and oesophagus.
REPORT: The patient was a 67 year old Chinese man, who presented initially with 
a Stanford type A dissection with caudal extension to the right common iliac 
artery. The patient underwent replacement of the ascending aorta and proximal 
arch with debranching of the right innominate artery and aortic valve 
replacement. A follow up computed tomography (CT) aortogram done in the 
post-operative period showed a stable appearance of the caudal extension of the 
aortic dissection. The patient was discharged with a plan for future stenting of 
the thoracic aorta. Three weeks later the patient re-presented with an upper 
gastrointestinal bleed from an aorto-oesophageal fistula. The patient underwent 
endovascular stenting of the descending aorta for management of the fistula. 
Repeat oesophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a small erosion 35 cm from the 
incisors where the previous bleeding site had been. No further bleeding was 
seen.
DISCUSSION: The patient recovered uneventfully after the procedure. Follow up CT 
aortogram done at 6 weeks demonstrated thrombosis of the false lumen of the 
descending thoracic aorta. Aorto-oesophageal fistula related to chronic type B 
aortic dissection is an extremely rare clinical entity and presents a challenge 
to the treating surgeon. This case demonstrates that selected cases can be 
judiciously managed by thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair alone.

Blindness caused by the disconnection between photoreceptor cells and the brain 
can be cured by restoring this connection through the transplantation of retinal 
precursor neurons. However, even after transplanting these cells, it is still 
unclear how to guide the axons over the long distance from the retina to the 
brain. To establish a method of guiding the axons of transplanted neurons, we 
used the Drosophila visual system. By testing different conditions, including 
the dissociation and preincubation length, we have successfully established a 
method to transplant photoreceptor precursor cells isolated from the developing 
eye discs of third-instar larvae into the adult retina. Moreover, we 
overexpressed N-cadherin (CadN) in the transplant, since it is known to be 
broadly expressed in the optic lobe well after developmental stages, continuing 
through adult stages. We found that promoting the cell adhesive properties using 
CadN enhances the axonal length of the grafted photoreceptor neurons and 
therefore is useful for future transplantation. We tested the overexpression of 
a CadN::Frazzled chimeric receptor and found that there was no difference in 
axonal length from our wild-type transplants, suggesting that the intracellular 
domain of CadN is necessary for axonal elongation. Altogether, using the 
Drosophila visual system, we have established an excellent platform for 
exploring the molecules required for proper axon extension of transplanted 
neuronal cells. Future studies building from this platform will be useful for 
regenerative therapy of the human nervous system based on transplantation.

422. Alternating Electric Fields (“Tumour-Treating Fields”) for the Treatment of 
Glioblastoma.

Glioblastoma is the most common type of primary brain cancer in adults. Despite 
advances in treatment, life expectancy for patients with glioblastoma is 
typically less than two years. Optune is a wearable technology intended for use 
in addition to standard therapies ― surgical resection, radiation therapy, and 
chemotherapy ― in adults with either newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma. 
It has also been trialled as a single therapy for adult patients with recurrent 
glioblastoma. Optune delivers alternating electric fields, or “tumour-treating 
fields,” to the brain to disrupt cancer cell division. The evidence suggests 
that some patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with Optune may 
live longer, although which patients are most likely to benefit is not yet 
entirely clear. The cost of therapy with the Optune system is about US$21,000 
per patient, per month.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Monitoring Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) 
in the Management of Asthma.

Brooks EA(1), Massanari M(2).

Author information:

PURPOSE: Current asthma guidelines combine treatment, follow-up, and 
reevaluation to manage asthma control, reduce impairment, and decrease risk of 
morbidity in patients. Clinical use of biomarkers, such as fractional exhaled 
nitric oxide (FeNO), along with standard management can provide clinicians with 
improved ability to recognize airway inflammation, optimize drug therapy, and 
potentially increase asthma control. Our objective is to examine the impact of 
FeNO monitoring on the cost effectiveness of asthma management compared with 
management without FeNO. Sensitivity analyses further examine the impact of FeNO 
monitoring on patients with varying levels of severity and exacerbations.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A decision-tree analysis of estimated outcomes and costs 
associated with annual management of asthma was utilized to simulate asthma 
management and treatment cost scenarios, comparing estimated 12-month costs and 
outcomes using the following treatment alternatives: (1) current standard of 
care (SOC) or (2) FeNO utilized in conjunction with the current SOC. Costs were 
estimated from the perspective of the health care payer; cost effectiveness was 
estimated as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).
RESULTS: FeNO in conjunction with SOC guidelines has decreased expected 
per-patient annual expenditure ($2,228) and increased expected per-patient
