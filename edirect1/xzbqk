BACKGROUND: Genetic association studies of transplantation outcomes have been 
hampered by small samples and highly complex multifactorial phenotypes, 
hindering investigations of the genetic architecture of a range of comorbidities 
which significantly impact graft and recipient life expectancy. We describe here 
the rationale and design of the International Genetics & Translational Research 
in Transplantation Network. The network comprises 22 studies to date, including 
16494 transplant recipients and 11669 donors, of whom more than 5000 are of 
non-European ancestry, all of whom have existing genomewide genotype data sets.
METHODS: We describe the rich genetic and phenotypic information available in 
this consortium comprising heart, kidney, liver, and lung transplant cohorts.
RESULTS: We demonstrate significant power in International Genetics & 
Translational Research in Transplantation Network to detect main effect 
association signals across regions such as the MHC region as well as genomewide 
for transplant outcomes that span all solid organs, such as graft survival, 
acute rejection, new onset of diabetes after transplantation, and for delayed 
graft function in kidney only.
CONCLUSIONS: This consortium is designed and statistically powered to deliver 
pioneering insights into the genetic architecture of transplant-related outcomes 
across a range of different solid-organ transplant studies. The study design 
allows a spectrum of analyses to be performed including recipient-only analyses, 
donor-recipient HLA mismatches with focus on loss-of-function variants and 
nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms.

This study was undertaken to assess the antifungal performance of three 
different Lactobacillus species.Experiments were conducted in vitro and in situ 
to extend the shelf life of wheat bread. Standard sourdough analyses were 
performed characterising acidity and carbohydrate levels. Overall, the strains 
showed good inhibition in vitro against the indicator mould Fusarium culmorum 
TMW4.2043. Sourdough bread fermented with Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM19280 
performed best in the in situ shelf life experiment. An average shelf life 
extension of six more mould-free days was reached when compared to the 
non-acidified control bread. A range of antifungal-active acids like 
3-phenyllactic acid, 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid and 2-hydroxyisocaproic acid in 
quantities between 0.1 and 360 mg/kg were present in the freeze-dried 
sourdoughs. Their concentration differed greatly amongst the species.However, a 
higher concentration of these compounds could not completely justify the growth 
inhibition of environmental moulds. In particular, although Lb. reuteri R29 
produced the highest total concentration of these active compounds in the 
sourdough, its addition to bread did not result in a longest shelf life. 
Nevertheless, when the artificial compounds were spiked into a chemically 
acidified dough, it succeeded in a longer shelf life (+25 %) than achieved only 
by acidifying the dough. This provides evidence of their contribution to the 
antifungal activity and their synergy in concentration levels far below their 
single minimal inhibition concentrations under acidic conditions.

Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is regarded as a disorder with adult 
onset between third and fifth decade of life. However, there is increasing 
evidence that SBMA may start already before adulthood. The present study 
investigated the following: (1) Which clinical manifestations have been 
described so far in the literature as initial manifestations? (2) Which was the 
age at onset of these manifestations? and (3) Is age at onset dependent on the 
CAG-repeat length if non-motor manifestations are additionally considered? Data 
for this review were identified by searches of MEDLINE using appropriate search 
terms. Onset manifestations in SBMA can be classified as frequent, rare, motor, 
non-motor, or questionable. Frequent are muscle weakness, cramps, 
fasciculations/twitching, tremor, dysarthria, dysphagia, or gynecomastia. Rare 
are myalgia, easy fatigability, exercise intolerance, polyneuropathy, 
hyper-CKemia, under-masculinized genitalia, scrotal hypospadias, microphallus, 
laryngospasm, or oligospermia. Questionable manifestations include sensory 
disturbances, cognitive impairment, increased pituitary volume, diabetes, 
reduced tongue pressure, elevated creatine-kinase, or low androgens/high 
estrogens. Age at onset is highly variable ranging from 4-76 years. Non-motor 
manifestations develop usually before motor manifestations. Age at onset depends 
on what is considered as an onset manifestation. Considering non-motor onset 
manifestations, age at onset is independent of the CAG-repeat size. In 
conclusion, age at onset of SBMA depends on what is regarded as onset 
manifestation. If non-motor manifestations are additionally considered, age at 
onset is independent of the CAG-repeat length. Since life expectancy is hardly 
reduced in SBMA, re-investigation of patients from published studies with regard 
to their initial disease profiles is recommended.

BACKGROUND: Many patients with Gleason 3 + 3 and 3 + 4 early stage prostate 
cancer receive invasive treatment but likely derive little or no benefit. A 
novel 8-protein prognostic assay generates a risk score at time of biopsy that 
is predictive of prostate cancer aggressiveness and can inform treatment 
decisions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
using the assay to inform treatment decisions compared with usual care.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We developed a simulation model to estimate 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and cost outcomes for the 8-protein assay and 
usual care strategies. Risk classification outcomes, treatment distributions, 
costs, health state utilities, and mortality rates were derived from the assay's 
validation study and the peer-reviewed literature. Outcomes included incremental 
QALYs, costs, and cost-effectiveness ratios. We conducted one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate the most influential inputs and 
to explore joint uncertainty in outcomes, respectively.
RESULTS: The 8-protein assay strategy resulted in 0.04 more QALY and $700 less 
in costs compared with usual care (and thus was "dominant"). The 
cost-effectiveness of the assay strategy was most sensitive to the assay cost, 
the active surveillance health state utility, and the proportion of low-risk 
patients receiving active surveillance (vs. treatment) in usual care. In the 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the assay strategy decreased cost and 
increased QALYs in 86.9% and 58.3% of simulations, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Assuming that ongoing prospective studies support the results of 
retrospective validation studies, the 8-protein prognostic assay strategy for 
prostate cancer is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to usual 
guideline-based care in biopsy Gleason 3 + 3 and 3 + 4 early stage prostate 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality and is 
associated with degenerative hip disease. Because of the recent increase in life 
expectancy for patients with this syndrome, orthopaedic surgeons are likely to 
see an increasing number of these patients who are candidates for total hip 
arthroplasty (THA).
METHODS: Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) data from 1998 to 2010, we 
compared the short-term adverse outcomes of THA among 241 patients with Down 
syndrome and a matched 723-patient cohort. Specifically, we assessed: (1) 
incidence of THA; (2) perioperative medical and surgical complications during 
the primary hospitalization; (3) length of stay; and (4) hospital charges.
RESULTS: The annual mean number of patients with Down syndrome undergoing THA 
was 19. Compared to matched controls, Down syndrome patients had an increased 
risk of perioperative (OR, 4.33; P<.001), medical (OR, 4.59; P<.001) and 
surgical (OR, 3.51; P<.001) complications during the primary hospitalization. 
Down syndrome patients had significantly higher incidence rates of pneumonia 
(P=.001), urinary tract infection (P<.001), and wound hemorrhage (P=.027). The 
mean lengths of stay for Down syndrome patients were 26% longer (P<.001), but 
there were no differences in hospital charges (P=.599).
CONCLUSION: During the initial evaluation and pre-operative consultation for a 
patient with Down syndrome who is a candidate for THA, orthopaedic surgeons 
should educate the patient, family and their clinical decision makers about the 
increased risk of medical complications (pneumonia and urinary tract 
infections), surgical complications (wound hemorrhage), and lengths of stay 
compared to the general population.

The cost-effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX(®)) 100 U + best supportive 
care (BSC) was compared with BSC alone in the management of idiopathic 
overactive bladder in adult patients who are not adequately managed with 
anticholinergics. BSC included incontinence pads and, for a proportion of 
patients, anticholinergics and/or occasional clean intermittent catheterisation. 
A five-state Markov model was used to estimate total costs and outcomes over a 
10-year period. The cohort was based on data from two placebo-controlled trials 
and a long-term extension study of onabotulinumtoxinA. After discontinuation of 
initial treatment, a proportion of patients progressed to downstream sacral 
nerve stimulation (SNS). Cost and resource use was estimated from a National 
Health Service perspective in England and Wales using relevant reference sources 
for 2012 or 2013. Results showed that onabotulinumtoxinA was associated with 
lower costs and greater health benefits than BSC in the base case, with 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicating an 89 % probability that the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio would fall below £20,000. 
OnabotulinumtoxinA remained dominant over BSC in all but two scenarios tested; 
it was also economically dominant when compared directly with SNS therapy. In 
conclusion, onabotulinumtoxinA appears to be a cost-effective treatment for 
overactive bladder compared with BSC alone.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of salvage cryotherapy (SC) in 
men with radiation recurrent prostate cancer (RRPC).
DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using decision analytic modelling by a Markov 
model.
SETTING AND METHODS: Compared SC and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in a 
cohort of patients with RRPC (biopsy proven local recurrence, no evidence of 
metastatic disease). A literature review captured published data to inform the 
decision model, and resource use data were from the Scottish Prostate 
Cryotherapy Service. The model was run in monthly cycles for RRPC men, mean age 
of 70 years. The model was run over the patient lifetime, to assess changes in 
patient health states and the associated quality of life, survival and cost 
impacts. Results are reported in terms of the discounted incremental costs and 
discounted incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained between the 2 
alternative interventions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis used a 10,000 
iteration Monte Carlo simulation.
RESULTS: SC has a high upfront treatment cost, but delays the ongoing monthly 
cost of ADT. SC is the dominant strategy over the patient lifetime; it is more 
effective with an incremental 0.56 QALY gain (95% CI 0.28 to 0.87), and less 
costly with a reduced lifetime cost of £29,719 (€37,619) (95% CI -51,985 to 
-9243). For a ceiling ratio of £30,000, SC has a 100% probability to be 
cost-effective. The cost neutral point was at 3.5 years, when the upfront cost 
of SC (plus any subsequent cumulative cost of side effects and ADT) equates the 
cumulative cost in the ADT arm. Limitations of our model may arise from its 
insensitivity to parameter or structural uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS: The platform for SC versus ADT cost-effective analysis can be 
employed to evaluate other treatment modalities or strategies in RRPC. SC is the 
dominant strategy, costing less over a patient's lifetime with improvements in 
QALYs.
TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This economic analysis was undertaken as part of the 
CROP RCT study
ISRCTN: 72677390; it was a pre-trial economic model developed and analysed 
during the pre-results stage of the RCT.

Chronic nutrient overload accelerates the onset of several aging-related 
diseases reducing life expectancy. Although the mechanisms by which 
overnutrition affects metabolic processes in many tissues are known, its role on 
BAT physiology is still unclear. Herein, we investigated the mitochondrial 
responses in BAT of female mice exposed to high fat diet (HFD) at different 
steps of life. Although adult mice showed an unchanged mitochondrial amount, 
both respiration and OxPHOS subunits were strongly affected. Differently, 
offspring pups exposed to HFD during pregnancy and lactation displayed reduced 
mitochondrial mass but high oxidative efficiency that, however, resulted in 
increased bioenergetics state of BAT rather than augmented uncoupling 
respiration. Interestingly, the metabolic responses triggered by HFD were 
accompanied by changes in mitochondrial dynamics characterized by decreased 
content of the fragmentation marker Drp1 both in mothers and offspring pups. 
HFD-induced inactivation of the FoxO1 transcription factor seemed to be the 
up-stream modulator of Drp1 levels in brown fat cells. Furthermore, HFD 
offspring pups weaned with normal diet only partially reverted the mitochondrial 
dysfunctions caused by HFD. Finally these mice failed in activating the 
thermogenic program upon cold exposure. Collectively our findings suggest that 
maternal dietary fat overload irreversibly commits BAT unresponsiveness to 
physiological stimuli such as cool temperature and this dysfunction in the early 
stage of life might negatively modulate health and lifespan.

With increases life expectancy, the incidence of undesirable manifestations of 
menopause has increased as well. The effects of lost ovarian function include 
progressive decrease in estradiol secretion, trophic changes in the breast, 
vasomotor symptoms, anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. Insomnia, which 
has physiological consequences and can result in a loss of quality of life, is 
prevalent in women after menopause. Hormone therapy has been widely used to 
reduce menopausal symptoms, but its use in recent years has been questioned 
because of the reported risks of cardiovascular events and increased incidence 
of tumors. This controversy has generated significant interest in non-hormonal 
treatments among both physicians and patients. Our previous research has shown a 
positive effect of massage therapy on menopausal symptoms. We explored the 
hypothesis that massage therapy would produce beneficial effects in 
postmenopausal women through inflammatory and immunological changes. Recent 
results from self-report questionnaires have shown improvements in sleep pattern 
and quality of life following massage therapy. These findings demonstrate the 
effectiveness of massage therapy for the treatment of postmenopausal symptoms, 
particularly insomnia, and indicate that it is a promising line of research.

Drought is one of the limiting environmental factors that affect crop 
production. Understanding the molecular basis of how plants respond to this 
water deficit stress is key to developing drought tolerant crops. In this study 
we generated time course-based transcriptome profiles of tobacco plants under 
water deficit conditions using microarray technology. In this paper, we describe 
in detail the experimental procedures and analyses performed in our study. The 
data set we generated (available in the NCBI/GEO database under GSE67434) has 
been analysed to identify genes that are involved in the regulation of tobacco's 
responses to drought.

Drought being a major challenge for crop productivity and yield affects 
multigenic and quantitative traits. It is also well documented that water stress 
shows a cross talk with other abiotic stresses such as high temperature and high 
light intensities (Tripathi et al., 2013) [1]. In this report, we documented the 
details of the methods and quality controls used and considered in our time 
course-based transcriptome profile of soybean plants under water deficit 
conditions using microarray technology. The findings of this study are recently 
published by the Rushton lab in BMC Genomics for a comparative study of tobacco 
and Soybean (Rabara et al., 2015) [2]. The raw microarray data set is deposited 
in GEO database with accession number GSE49537.

BACKGROUND: High fractions of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in the breath of 
patients with symptoms of asthma are correlated with high levels of eosinophils 
and indicate that a patient is likely to respond to inhaled corticosteroids. 
This may have a role in the diagnosis and management of asthma.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic accuracy, clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of the hand-held electrochemical devices NIOX MINO(®) 
(Aerocrine, Solna, Sweden), NIOX VERO(®) (Aerocrine) and NObreath(®) (Bedfont 
Scientific, Maidstone, UK) for the diagnosis and management of asthma.
DATA SOURCES: Systematic searches were carried out between March 2013 and April 
2013 from database inception. Databases searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, the 
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of 
Effects, Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation 
Index - Science. Trial registers such as ClinicalTrials.gov and the metaRegister 
of Controlled Trials were also searched in March 2013. All searches were updated 
in September 2013.
REVIEW METHODS: A rapid review was conducted to assess the equivalence of 
hand-held and chemiluminescent FeNO monitors. Systematic reviews of diagnostic 
accuracy and management efficacy were conducted. A systematic review of economic 
analyses was also conducted and two de novo health economic models were 
developed. All three reviews were undertaken according to robust high-quality 
methodology.
RESULTS: The rapid review (27 studies) found varying levels of agreement between 
monitors (Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement up to ±10 parts per billion), 
with better agreement at lower FeNO values. Correlation was good (generally 
r > 0.9). The diagnostic accuracy review identified 22 studies in adults (all 
ages) and four in children. No studies used NObreath or NIOX VERO and seven used 
NIOX MINO. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy varied widely. FeNO used in 
combination with another test altered diagnostic accuracy only slightly. High 
levels of heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Limited observations included 
that FeNO may be more reliable and useful as a rule-in than as a rule-out test; 
lower cut-off values in children and in smokers may be appropriate; and FeNO may 
be less reliable in the elderly. The management review identified five 
randomised controlled trials in adults, one in pregnant asthmatics and seven in 
children. Despite clinical heterogeneity, exacerbation rates were lower in all 
studies but not generally statistically significantly so. Effects on inhaled 
corticosteroid (ICS) use were inconsistent, possibly because of differences in 
management protocols, differential effectiveness in adults and children and 
differences in population severity. One UK diagnostic model and one management 
model were identified. Aerocrine also submitted diagnostic and management 
models. All had significant limitations including short time horizons and the 
selective use of efficacy evidence. The de novo diagnostic model suggested that 
the expected difference in quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains between 
diagnostic options is likely to be very small. Airway hyper-responsiveness by 
methacholine challenge test is expected to produce the greatest QALY gain but 
with an expected incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared with FeNO 
(NObreath) in combination with bronchodilator reversibility of £1.125M per QALY 
gained. All remaining options are expected to be dominated. The de novo 
management model indicates that the ICER of guidelines plus FeNO monitoring 
using NObreath compared with guidelines alone in children is expected to be 
approximately £45,200 per QALY gained. Within the adult subgroup, FeNO 
monitoring using NObreath compared with guidelines alone is expected to have an 
ICER of approximately £2100 per QALY gained. The results are particularly 
sensitive to assumptions regarding changes in ICS use over time, the number of 
nurse visits for FeNO monitoring and duration of effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Limitations of the evidence base impose considerable uncertainty on 
all analyses. Equivalence of devices was assumed but not assured. Evidence for 
diagnosis is difficult to interpret in the context of inserting FeNO monitoring 
into a diagnostic pathway. Evidence for management is also inconclusive, but 
largely consistent with FeNO monitoring resulting in fewer exacerbations, with a 
small or zero reduction in ICS use in adults and a possible increased ICS use in 
children or patients with more severe asthma. It is unclear which specific 
management protocol is likely to be most effective. The economic analysis 
indicates that FeNO monitoring could have value in diagnostic and management 
settings. The diagnostic model indicates that FeNO monitoring plus 
bronchodilator reversibility dominates many other diagnostic tests. FeNO-guided 
management has the potential to be cost-effective, although this is largely 
dependent on the duration of effect. The conclusions drawn from both models 
require strong technical value judgements with respect to several aspects of the 
decision problem in which little or no empirical evidence exists. There are many 
potential directions for further work, including investigations into which 
management protocol is best and long-term follow-up in both diagnosis and 
management studies.

Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.

OBJECTIVE: Health utility value (HUV) is an outcome measure used to calculate 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and to determine cost-effectiveness of 
medical treatments. Herein, we measure HUV in patients with superior canal 
dehiscence syndrome (SCDS) before and after surgical repair. Health utility 
values of patients with SCDS are compared to normative data of the general 
United States population.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospectively collected data.
PATIENTS: Adult patients with SCDS.
SETTING: Tertiary referral center.
INTERVENTIONS: SCD repair via middle fossa craniotomy or transmastoid 
approaches.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: change in HUV, as measured by the Short-Form 6-Dimension 
questionnaire.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: autophony index (AI), dizziness handicap inventory (DHI), 
and hearing handicap inventory (HHI).
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with SCDS were enrolled, 23 underwent surgical 
repair. Mean HUV in patients with SCDS is significantly lower than the general 
U.S.
POPULATION: 0.68 (SD = 0.13) versus 0.80 (0.29), p < 0.01, respectively. 
Patients electing to undergo surgical repair had similar values relative to 
nonoperated patients: 0.65 (0.13) versus 0.71 (0.14), p = 0.20, respectively. At 
mean follow-up of 12 months (range 3-39), postoperative HUV improved to 0.79 
(0.12), p < 0.01. AI decreased (improved) after repair: 32.7 (28.0) to 4.8 
(8.3), p < 0.001. DHI and HHI did not change significantly after surgery, 
p > 0.14. Nonoperated patients had no significant change in HUV during a mean 
follow-up period of 21 months (range 9-39), p = 0.33.
CONCLUSIONS: SCDS patients have significantly lower HUV compared with the 
general U.S.
POPULATION: HUV demonstrated improvement after surgery. Nonoperated patients 
have ongoing impaired quality of life.

Management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms: A decision analysis.

Auger RG, Wiebers DO.

Decision analysis was carried out to gain insight into the optimal management of 
patients aged 20-80 years with unruptured intracranial aneurysms between 10 and 
25 mm in diameter. Baseline probabilities for outcomes resulting from either 
elective repair of the aneurysm or nonintervention were obtained from studies of 
patients with intracranial aneurysms seen at the Mayo Clinic. The utility of 
each outcome was based on the mean life expectancy for otherwise normal people 
of the same age and sex, with an adjustment made for quality of life. If these 
baseline probabilities and utilities are used in the calculations, elective 
surgical repair of unruptured aneurysms of this size is preferable to 
nonintervention in men under age 69 and in women under age 75 if they are 
otherwise in good health.

Efficacy of antiviral chemotherapy for retrovirus-infected cats: What does the 
current literature tell us?

GLOBAL IMPORTANCE: The two feline retroviruses, feline immunodeficiency virus 
(FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), are global and widespread, but differ 
in their potential to cause disease.
VIRAL INFECTION - FIV: FIV, a lentivirus that shares many properties with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can cause an acquired immune deficiency syndrome, 
which predisposes cats to other infections, stomatitis, neurological disorders 
and tumours. Although secondary infections are common, specific opportunistic 
infections or acquired immunodeficiency virus-defining infections, such as those 
that occur with HIV, are not commonly reported in FIV-infected cats. In most 
naturally infected cats, FIV does not cause a severe clinical syndrome; with 
appropriate care, FIV-infected cats can live many years before succumbing to 
conditions unrelated to their FIV infection. Thus, overall survival time is not 
necessarily shorter than in uninfected cats, and quality of life is usually high 
over many years or lifelong.
VIRAL INFECTION - FELV: FeLV, an oncornavirus, is more pathogenic than FIV. 
Historically, it was considered to account for more disease-related deaths and 
clinical syndromes in cats than any other infectious agent. Recently, the 
prevalence and importance of FeLV have been decreasing, mainly because of 
testing and eradication programmes and the use of FeLV vaccines. Progressive 
FeLV infection can cause tumours, bone marrow suppression and immunosuppression, 
as well as neurological and other disorders, and leads to a decrease in life 
expectancy. However, with appropriate care, many FeLV-infected cats can also 
live several years with a good quality of life.
PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: A decision regarding treatment or euthanasia should never 
be based solely on the presence or absence of a retrovirus infection. Antiviral 
chemotherapy is of increasing interest in veterinary medicine, but is still not 
used commonly.
EVIDENCE BASE: This article reviews the current literature on antiviral 
chemotherapy in retrovirus-infected cats, focusing on drugs that are currently 
available on the market and, thus, could potentially be used in cats.

BACKGROUND: Survival trend analyses examine mortality outcomes over time. The 
impact of conducting survival trend analyses without accounting for improved 
population survival has not been systematically studied.
METHODS: The 1-year risk of death in the 100 most common hospital admissions for 
Ontario adults in 1994, 1999, 2004, and 2009 was determined. Generalized linear 
models were used to determine if adjusted death risk changed significantly over 
time with and without accounting for population survival.
RESULTS: The statistical significance of temporal trends in survival changed 
after accounting for population life expectancy in 16 diagnoses (16 percent) (in 
13 of 55 diagnoses, statistically significant decreasing mortality trends became 
insignificant; in 3 of 15 diagnoses, insignificant trends changed to a 
significant increase in mortality risk over time).
CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the importance of accounting for population 
life-expectancy changes in survival trend analyses.

BACKGROUND: Improved life expectancy means that more adults with intellectual 
disabilities are now living with ageing parents. This study explored older 
families' perceptions of the future.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine older parents and 
three adults with intellectual disabilities and analysed to produce an 
explanatory thematic framework.
RESULTS: 'Tolerating uncertainty' was the major theme in participants' attempts 
to manage anxieties about the future, encompassing sub-themes of 'accepting the 
parenting role', 'facing challenges', 'being supported/isolated', 'positive 
meaning making', 're-evaluating as time moves on' and 'managing future 
thinking'. Some participants expressed preferences for their future which were 
in contrast to their parents' views, and provide a unique perspective that has 
often been neglected in prior research.
CONCLUSIONS: This research has found commonalities in how families tolerate the 
uncertainty of the future, but also unique differences that require tailored 
interventions and prospective action by services.

Understanding Democracy and Development Traps Using a Data-Driven Approach.

Methods from machine learning and data science are becoming increasingly 
important in the social sciences, providing powerful new ways of identifying 
statistical relationships in large data sets. However, these relationships do 
not necessarily offer an understanding of the processes underlying the data. To 
address this problem, we have developed a method for fitting nonlinear dynamical 
systems models to data related to social change. Here, we use this method to 
investigate how countries become trapped at low levels of socioeconomic 
development. We identify two types of traps. The first is a democracy trap, 
where countries with low levels of economic growth and/or citizen education fail 
to develop democracy. The second trap is in terms of cultural values, where 
countries with low levels of democracy and/or life expectancy fail to develop 
emancipative values. We show that many key developing countries, including India 
and Egypt, lie near the border of these development traps, and we investigate 
the time taken for these nations to transition toward higher democracy and 
socioeconomic well-being.

Recently, the evidence-based guideline 'Spinal metastasis' produced by the Dutch 
National Working Group on Neuro-Oncology appeared. This guideline applies to 
patients with spinal metastases and spinal localizations of haematological 
malignancies, with or without epidural extension. Timely diagnosis and treatment 
of spinal metastases is essential in order to reduce pain and neurological 
deficit in particular. An important aim of this guideline is to reduce both 
patient and doctor delay by providing information to high-risk patients and 
their general practitioners and to give clear advice on the organization of 
care. In this case report we describe two patients with spinal metastases in 
order to illustrate the difficulties in providing a timely diagnosis and optimal 
treatment for symptomatic spinal metastases. Furthermore, we provide advice to 
all health care professionals involved to secure the highest possible quality of 
life for patients with spinal metastases.

CONTEXT: Testosterone (T) levels have been associated with mortality, but 
controversy exists.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate associations between serum levels of 
total T, SHBG, free T, estradiol, LH and FSH, and subsequent mortality with up 
to 30 years of follow-up.
DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study consisting of men participating in 
four independent population-based surveys (MONICA I-III and Inter99) from 1982 
to 2001 and followed until December 2012 with complete registry follow-up.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5350 randomly selected men from the general 
population aged 30, 40, 50, 60, or 70 years at baseline participated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
mortality, and cancer mortality were the main outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 1533 men died during the follow-up period; 428 from CVD and 
480 from cancer. Cox proportional hazard models revealed that men in highest LH 
quartile had an increased all-cause mortality compared to lowest quartile 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-1.53). Likewise, 
increased quartiles of LH/T and estradiol increased the risk of all-cause 
mortality (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06-1.43; HR, 1.23; 95% CI 1.06-1.43). No 
association to T levels was found. Higher LH levels were associated with 
increased cancer mortality (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.10-1.84) independently of 
smoking status. Lower CVD mortality was seen for men with T in the highest 
quartile compared to lowest (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53-0.98). Furthermore, negative 
trends were seen for SHBG and free T in relation to CVD mortality, however 
insignificant.
CONCLUSION: The observed positive association of LH and LH/T, but not T, with 
all-cause mortality suggests that a compensated impaired Leydig cell function 
may be a risk factor for death by all causes in men. Our findings underpin the 
clinical importance of including LH measurement in the diagnostic work-up of 
male patients seeking help for possible androgen insufficiency.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
belimumab, a new biological treatment specifically developed for the treatment 
of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), in the Italian setting. SLE is a chronic 
non-organ specific autoimmune disease characterized by a disregulation of the 
immune system that involves many organs and systems.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness micro-simulation model with a lifetime horizon 
originally developed for the UK was adapted to the Italian setting. The analysis 
compared Standard of Care (SoC) alone vs belimumab plus SoC from a National 
Healthcare Service (NHS) and societal perspective. Health-economic consequences 
of treatments and organ damage progression were calculated. When available, 
Italian data were used, otherwise UK costs were converted using Purchasing Power 
Parities (PPPs). Utility values were based on the EQ-5D™ assessments in the 
belimumab clinical trials (BLISS 52 and 76). Results were discounted with 3% for 
costs and effects. A maximum belimumab treatment duration of 6 years was assumed 
and wastage costs were considered.
RESULTS: Cost per life year gained (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio, ICER) 
and cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) (Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio, 
ICUR) were €22,990 and €32,859, respectively. These values reduced to €20,119 
and €28,754, respectively, when indirect costs were included.
CONCLUSIONS: It may be concluded that in the Italian setting and according to 
the guidelines of the Italian Association of Health Economics (IAHE), belimumab 
was shown to be cost-effective, in terms of both ICER and ICUR, 
(€25-40,000/QALY).

Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) numbers are beginning to recover across 
most of the western distinct population segment following catastrophic declines 
that began in the 1970s and ended around the turn of the century. This study 
makes use of contemporary vital rate estimates from a trend-site rookery in the 
eastern Gulf of Alaska (a sub-region of the western population) in a matrix 
population model to estimate the trend and strength of the recovery across this 
region between 2003 and 2013. The modeled population trend was projected into 
the future based on observed variation in vital rates and a prospective 
elasticity analysis was conducted to determine future trends and which vital 
rates pose the greatest threats to recovery. The modeled population grew at a 
mean rate of 3.5% per yr between 2003 and 2013 and was correlated with census 
count data from the local rookery and throughout the eastern Gulf of Alaska. If 
recent vital rate estimates continue with little change, the eastern Gulf of 
Alaska population could be fully recovered to pre-decline levels within 23 
years. With density dependent growth, the population would need another 45 years 
to fully recover. Elasticity analysis showed that, as expected, population 
growth rate (λ) was most sensitive to changes in adult survival, less sensitive
