Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a routine procedure for 
patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who are deemed inoperable or 
high-risk surgical candidates. The aim of this study was to examine real-world 
data on death and readmission rates in patients following the procedure. 
Electronic health records for patients who underwent TAVI between April 2015 and 
November 2018 were reviewed. Details of the procedure, complications, length of 
initial hospital stay and outcomes of interest (subsequent admissions and 
mortality) were recorded. In our cohort of 124 patients, the mean age was 80.8 
years and 43% were male. Cardiac comorbidities were common, more than 30% had 
myocardial infarction (MI) and 15% had a previous coronary artery bypass graft 
(CABG). One in five suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
with similar prevalence of diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). 
In-hospital mortality was low at 3.3%, however, 30-day readmission rates were 
high at 14.6%; 44.4% were readmitted to hospital within one year. TAVI is a 
successful procedure in Scotland with good outcome data. The potential benefit 
of the procedure in many patients is limited by comorbidities, which shorten 
life-expectancy and lead to hospital readmission. These data highlight the 
importance of effective multi-disciplinary discussion in a time of realistic 
medicine.

Our previous study showed that an exchange of blood between heterochronic 
parabionts for 3 months did not rejuvenate the immune system of the old 
partners. Moreover, the young immune system became more aged and began to 
function according to the "old" principle. Does this forced aging affect all 
systems of the organism in this model? We checked the levels of corticosterone, 
testosterone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin, and thyroxine in 
the blood of heterochronic parabionts, but did not find significant changes 
compared with age-related controls. Since numerous data support the possibility 
of rejuvenation of the brain, muscles, and other tissues using the model of 
heterochronic parabiosis, as well as opposite data, we planned to assess the 
overall effect of this long-term blood exchange on the rate of organism aging. 
We measured the life span of animals whose blood was exchanged for 3 months and 
then were disconnected. Median and maximum life expectancy decreased in young 
heterochronic parabionts compared with the isochronic control. Old heterochronic 
parabionts showed only a small trend toward an increase in the median life span, 
but it was not statistically significant, and the maximum life span did not 
change compared with the isochronic parabionts. These data support our 
assumption that old blood contains factors capable of inducing aging in young 
animals. The mechanism of selective suppression of aging factor production in 
the organism could be a key research field for life extension.

OBJECTIVE: The primary aim was assessing the cost-effectiveness of an 
internet-based self-help program, expert-patient support, and the combination of 
both compared to a care-as-usual condition.
METHOD: An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was conducted 
alongside a randomized controlled trial. Participants aged 16 or older with at 
least mild eating disorder symptoms were randomly assigned to four conditions: 
(1) Featback, an online unguided self-help program, (2) chat or e-mail support 
from a recovered expert patient, (3) Featback with expert-patient support, and 
(4) care-as-usual. After a baseline assessment and intervention period of 
8 weeks, five online assessments were conducted over 12 months of follow-up. The 
main result constituted cost-utility acceptability curves with quality-of-life 
adjusted life years (QALYs) and societal costs over the entire study duration.
RESULTS: No significant differences between the conditions were found regarding 
QALYs, health care costs and societal costs. Nonsignificant differences in QALYs 
were in favor of the Featback conditions and the lowest societal costs per 
participant were observed in the Featback only condition (€16,741) while the 
highest costs were seen in the care-as-usual condition (€28,479). The Featback 
only condition had the highest probability of being efficient compared to the 
alternatives for all acceptable willingness-to-pay values.
DISCUSSION: Featback, an internet-based unguided self-help intervention, was 
likely to be efficient compared to Featback with guidance from an expert 
patient, guidance alone and a care-as-usual condition. Results suggest that 
scalable interventions such as Featback may reduce health care costs and help 
individuals with eating disorders that are currently not reached by other forms 
of treatment.
PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Internet-based interventions for eating disorders 
might reach individuals in society who currently do not receive appropriate 
treatment at low costs. Featback, an online automated self-help program for 
eating disorders, was found to improve quality of life slightly while reducing 
costs for society, compared to a do-nothing approach. Consequently, implementing 
internet-based interventions such as Featback likely benefits both individuals 
suffering from an eating disorder and society as a whole.

AIMS: Contemporary long-term survival following a heart failure (HF) 
hospitalization is uncertain. We evaluated survival up to 10 years after a HF 
hospitalization using national data from Australia and New Zealand, identified 
predictors of survival, and estimated the attributable loss in life expectancy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of HF from 
2008-2017 were identified and all-cause mortality assessed by linking with Death 
Registries. Flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate survival, 
predictors of survival and loss in life expectancy. A total of 283 048 patients 
with HF were included (mean age 78.2 ± 12.3 years, 50.8% male). Of these, 48.3% 
(48.1-48.5) were surviving by 3 years, 34.1% (33.9-34.3) by 5 years and 17.1% 
(16.8-17.4) by 10 years (median survival 2.8 years). Survival declined with age 
with 53.4% of patients aged 18-54 years and 6.2% aged ≥85 years alive by 
10 years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] for mortality 4.84, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 4.65-5.04 for ≥85 years vs. 18-54 years) and was worse in male 
patients (aHR 1.14, 95% CI 1.13-1.15). Prior HF (aHR 1.20, 95% CI 1.18-1.22), 
valvular and rheumatic heart disease (aHR 1.11, 95% CI 1.10-1.13) and vascular 
disease (aHR 1.07, 95% CI 1.04-1.09) were cardiovascular comorbidities most 
strongly associated with long-term death. Non-cardiovascular comorbidities and 
geriatric syndromes were common and associated with higher mortality. Compared 
with the general population, HF was associated with a loss of 7.3 years in life 
expectancy (or 56.6% of the expected life expectancy) and reached 20.5 years for 
those aged 18-54 years.
CONCLUSION: Less than one in five patients hospitalized for HF were surviving by 
10 years with patients experiencing almost 60% loss in life expectancy compared 
with the general population, highlighting the considerable persisting societal 
burden of HF. Concerted multidisciplinary efforts are needed to improve 
post-hospitalization outcomes of HF.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
durvalumab compared with Best supportive care (BSC) after chemoradiotherapy in 
patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer from healthcare system 
perspective in China.
METHODS: A dynamic state transition model was adopted to simulate life time, 
direct medical costs and QALYs. In the base case scenario, for patients with 
unresectable, stage Ⅲ non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has not 
progressed after platinum-based chemoradiation therapy, the treatment group 
would use durvalumab whereas the control group would use BSC. Clinical data and 
health utility were derived from the patient-level data of Asian ethnicity in 
the PACIFIC trial. Cost of drug acquisition, follow-up, medical service, 
inspection, terminal care and adverse event treatment were considered in this 
model. The cost of durvalumab was calculated based on retail prices and Patient 
Assistance Program.
RESULTS: In the base case, the durvalumab group yielded an additional 2.60 LYs 
and 2.37QALYs (discounted), causing an additional cost of 0.459 million RMB and 
0.109 million RMB without and with PAP, so the ICER was 193,898 RMB/QALY and 
46,093.12 RMB/QALY respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that durvalumab can improve the survival of 
patients with unresectable, stage Ⅲ non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has 
not progressed after platinum-based chemoradiation therapy and would be a 
cost-effective option compared with BSC at a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold 
of 212676 RMB (three times GDP per capita of China in 2019).

Antibiotic resistance is a global issue that threatens our progress in 
healthcare and life expectancy. In recent years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 
have been considered as promising alternatives to the classic antibiotics. AMPs 
are potentially superior due to their lower rate of resistance development, 
since they primarily target the bacterial membrane ('Achilles' heel' of the 
bacteria). However, bacteria have developed mechanisms of AMP resistance, 
including the removal of AMPs to the extracellular space by efflux pumps such as 
the MtrCDE or AcrAB-TolC systems, and the internalization of AMPs to the 
cytoplasm by the Sap transporter, followed by proteolytic digestion. In this 
review, we focus on AMP transport as a resistance mechanism compiling all the 
experimental evidence for the involvement of efflux in AMP resistance in 
Gram-negative bacteria and combine this information with the analysis of the 
structures of the efflux systems involved. Finally, we expose some open 
questions with the aim of arousing the interest of the scientific community 
towards the AMPs-efflux pumps interactions. All the collected information 
broadens our understanding of AMP removal by efflux pumps and gives some clues 
to assist the rational design of AMP-derivatives as inhibitors of the efflux 
pumps.

The discoloration of spiced beef during storage is a severe problem that limits 
the shelf life of products. This study explored the associations between 
discoloration and pH, water, lipid oxidation, and protein oxidation. Electron 
paramagnetic resonance and UV-Vis spectroscopy illustrated that the pigment of 
spiced beef was a pentacoordinate mononitrosylheme compound and its conjugated 
structure changed during storage. The low-field NMR and magnetic resonance 
imaging results showed that the mobility of water increased, and the water 
content decreased with the extension of storage time. Multivariate analysis 
showed that color attributes were negatively correlated with oxidation. The 
oxidation of nitrosohemachrome was the primary reason for the lightness (L*) and 
redness (a*) decline in spiced beef. In addition, water loss exerted a promotion 
function in the oxidation process. This study provides valuable information on 
maintaining the quality of spiced beef during storage.

Loss of life expectancy from PM(2.5) in Brazil: A national study from 2010 to 
2018.

BACKGROUND: Long-term exposure to PM2.5 is proved to be linked with mortality. 
However, limited studies have estimated the PM2.5 related loss of life 
expectancy (LLE) and its changing trends. How much life expectancy would be 
improved if PM2.5 pollution is reduced to the new WHO air quality guideline 
(AQG) level is unclear.
METHODS: Data on deaths from all-causes, cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory 
diseases were collected from 5,565 Brazilian municipalities during 2010-2018. A 
difference-in-differences approach with quasi-Poisson regression was applied to 
examine the PM2.5-years of life lost (YLL) associations and PM2.5 associated 
LLE.
RESULTS: The annual PM2.5 concentration in each municipality from 2010 to 2018 
was 7.7 µg/m3 in Brazil. Nationally, with each 10 μg/m3 increase in 
five-year-average (current and previous four years) concentrations of PM2.5, the 
relative risks (RRs) were 1.18 (95% CI: 1.15-1.21) for YLL from all-causes, 1.22 
(1.16-1.28) from cancer, 1.12 (1.08-1.17) from cardiovascular and 1.17 
(1.10-1.25) from respiratory diseases. Life expectancy could be improved by 1.09 
(95% CI: 0.92-1.25) years by limiting PM2.5 concentration to the national lowest 
level (2.9 µg/m3), specifically, 0.20 (0.15-0.24) years for cancer, 0.16 
(0.11-0.22) years for cardiovascular and 0.09 (0.05-0.13) years for respiratory 
diseases, with significant disparities across regions and municipalities. Life 
expectancy would be improved by 0.78 (0.66-0.90) years by setting the new WHO 
AQG PM2.5 concentration level of 5 μg/m3 as an acceptable threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Using nationwide death records in Brazil, we found that long-term 
exposure to PM2.5 was associated with reduced life expectancy from all-causes, 
cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases with regional inequalities and 
different trends. PM2.5 pollution abatement to below the WHO AQG level would 
improve this loss of life expectancy in Brazil.

BACKGROUND: 'Vegetative' and 'generative' tomato rootstock types have been 
proposed based on their different effects on tomato scion growth performance; 
however, their impacts on fruit quality have not been characterized. No study 
has been conducted in which the effects of rootstock on grape tomato quality 
attributes were assessed using sensory and instrumental methods of evaluation. 
Here, we conducted two experiments to examine the influence of 'DR0141TX', 
'Estamino', and 'Multifort' rootstocks (vegetative, generative, and 
uncharacterized, respectively) on fruit quality properties of determinate and 
indeterminate grape tomato scions under organic production in high tunnels, 
including color, size, firmness, dry matter content, soluble solids content 
(SSC), titratable acidity (TA), pH, and consumer sensory attributes.
RESULTS: In both experiments, grafting 'Sweet Hearts' indeterminate grape tomato 
onto 'DR0141TX', 'Estamino', or 'Multifort' increased fruit size and led to 
negligible effects on sensory attributes and instrumental measurements of fruit 
quality attributes. For 'BHN 1022' determinate grape tomato, rootstocks did not 
exhibit any major impact on fruit quality attributes in Experiment 1. However, 
fruit quality was compromised by grafting per se and rootstocks, especially 
'Multifort', in Experiment 2, as reflected by reduced SSC, TA, and SSC/TA and 
lower scores for overall appearance, overall acceptability, tomato flavor, 
overall texture, and sweetness.
CONCLUSION: In general, 'vegetative' and 'generative' rootstocks showed 
comparable effects on sensory evaluations and instrumental measurements of grape 
tomato quality attributes for both indeterminate and determinate scions. More 
research is needed to better characterize rootstock effects on fruit quality, 
including the flavor-related compounds under different growing conditions. ©

BACKGROUND: Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is an uncommon yet potentially 
life-threatening manifestation of venous thromboembolism. The aim of this study 
was to present a retrospective analysis of a cohort of Western Australian 
patients diagnosed with SVT on imaging study, and a review of the literature 
surrounding the aetiology, location, anticoagulation treatment and outcomes of 
SVT.
METHODS: All patients diagnosed with SVT over a five-year period from 2015 to 
2020 in three tertiary hospitals in Western Australia were identified by using 
an electronic search engine of imaging reports. Collected data included patient 
demographics and co-morbidity, presentation data, location of thrombus, 
aetiology of thrombus, treatment with anti-coagulation, length of stay and 
outcome data including mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 164 patients met inclusion criteria. The 90-day mortality 
was 20.1%; 64% of whom were those with portal vein thrombosis. Aetiology was 
grouped into haematological conditions (4 patients), non-haematological 
conditions (130 patients), a combination of factors (17 patients) and idiopathic 
(13 patients). The majority of deaths were due to malignancy, severe 
pancreatitis or decompensated liver cirrhosis.
CONCLUSION: Whilst the prevalence of SVT is rising with the increase in 
accessibility to radiological studies, it remains a diagnostic and therapeutic 
challenge for clinicians. With no consensus guidelines available to direct 
treatment, the management of patients with SVT should be individualized and 
considered carefully. The potential complications of venous thrombosis, SVT 
recurrence or extension and the risk of bleeding need to be evaluated before the 
commencement of anticoagulation therapy.

BACKGROUND: First-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have elevated PDAC risk, partially due to germline genetic 
variants. We evaluated the potential effectiveness of genetic testing to target 
MRI-based screening among FDRs.
METHODS: We used a microsimulation model of PDAC, calibrated to Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, to estimate the potential life 
expectancy (LE) gain of screening for each of the following groups of FDRs: 
individuals who test positive for each of eight variants associated with 
elevated PDAC risk (e.g., BRCA2, CDKN2A); individuals who test negative; and 
individuals who do not test. Screening was assumed to take place if LE gains 
were achievable. We simulated multiple screening approaches, defined by starting 
age and frequency. Sensitivity analysis evaluated changes in results given 
varying model assumptions.
RESULTS: For women, 92% of mutation carriers had projected LE gains from 
screening for PDAC, if screening strategies (start age, frequency) were 
optimized. Among carriers, LE gains ranged from 0.1 days (ATM+ women screened 
once at age 70) to 510 days (STK11+ women screened annually from age 40). For 
men, LE gains were projected for all mutation carriers, ranging from 0.2 days 
(BRCA1+ men screened once at age 70) to 620 days (STK11+ men screened annually 
from age 40). For men and women who did not undergo genetic testing, or for whom 
testing showed no variant, screening yielded small LE benefit (0-2.1 days).
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing of FDRs can inform targeted PDAC screening by 
identifying which FDRs may benefit.

The psychosocial impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on human life is 
well-known. Although vaccine protection represents an effective way to control 
the spread of the virus, vaccination hesitancy may decrease individuals' 
willingness to get vaccinated, including among cancer patients. Therefore, the 
objective of the current study was to examine the predictors of cancer patients' 
intentions to receive COVID-19 vaccinations and vaccine uptake, using and 
integrating the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the health belief model 
(HBM). A sample of 276 Italian cancer patients (54% female and 46% male) ranging 
from 19 to 85 years (M = 49.64, SD = 11.53) was recruited by administering an 
online questionnaire. The current study results showed that cancer patients with 
higher trust in health authorities tended to have vaccine-positive subjective 
norms, perceived that vaccination was under their control, and viewed COVID-19 
vaccines positively. On the other hand, the perceived risk of COVID-19 was 
related to subjective norms but not to perceived behavioural control or 
attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. The current study reveals that TPB 
variables can function effectively as mediators between perceived risk, trust, 
and intention to vaccinate but at different levels. Together, these findings 
suggest that effective interventions (both public health messaging and personal 
medical communications) should focus on enhancing trust in health authorities, 
while at the same time endeavouring to highlight subjective norms that are 
vaccine-positive.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Advances in hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) therapies have improved morbidity and mortality, but global disparities in 
viral hepatitis outcomes remain. We evaluate global trends in the impact of HBV 
and HCV on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
METHODS: Using data from the 2010-2019 Global Burden of Diseases Study (GBD), 
overall all-cause DALYs for patients with acute HBV or HCV, HBV- or HCV-related 
cirrhosis, and HBV- or HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was calculated 
as the sum of years of life lost because of premature death and years lived with 
disability. DALYs were presented as age-standardized rates per 100 000 
population stratified by age and sex.
RESULTS: From 2010 to 2019, the overall global impact of HBV on DALYs per 
100 000 decreased from 27.6 to 20.9 for acute HBV and 168.6 to 129.8 for 
HBV-related cirrhosis but remained stable for HBV-related HCC. The impact of HCV 
on DALYs per 100 000 decreased from 5.23 to 3.3 for acute HCV, 159.2 to 146.2 
for HCV-related cirrhosis, and 37.5 to 34.9 for HCV-related HCC. We observed 
significant differences in the impact of HBV and HCV on DALYs when stratified by 
world regions.
CONCLUSION: Decreases in HBV and HCV DALYs from 2010 to 2019 were observed. 
Disparities in DALY improvements across world regions suggest unequal access to 
viral hepatitis care and treatment. Achieving goals of viral hepatitis 
elimination will require enhanced prevention efforts and funding for high-burden 
regions and regions that have not had substantial reductions in DALYs because of 
HBV and HCV.

OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic that emerged in December 2019 brought human 
life to a standstill. With over 2-year since the pandemic originated from Wuhan, 
SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 6 million deaths worldwide. With the emergence 
of mutant strains and COVID-19 surge waves, it becomes critically important to 
conduct epidemiological studies that allow us to understand the role of various 
environmental factors on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Our earlier study reported a 
strong negative correlation between temperature and COVID-19 incidence. This 
research is an extension of our previous study with an attempt to understand the 
global analysis of COVID-19 in northern hemisphere countries.
STUDY DESIGN: This research aims at achieving a better understanding of the 
correlation of environmental factors such as temperature, sunlight, and humidity 
with new cases of COVID-19 in northern hemisphere from March 2020 to February 
2022.
METHODS: To understand the relationship between the different environmental 
variants and COVID-19, a statistical approach was employed using Pearson, 
Spearman and Kendall analysis.
RESULTS: Month-wise univariate analysis indicated a strong negative correlation 
of temperature and sunlight with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, whereas inconsistencies 
were observed in correlation analysis in the case of humidity in winter months. 
Moreover, a strong negative correlation between average temperature of winter 
months and COVID-19 cases exists as evidenced by Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall 
analyses. In addition, correlation pattern between monthly temperature and 
COVID-19 cases of a country mimics to that of sunlight of a country.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study proposes that low temperatures and low sunlight 
might be additional risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, mostly in northern 
hemisphere countries.

Evaluating side effects of new neonicotinoids in terms of sublethal doses and 
transcriptome expression is a crucial but challenging part of integrated pest 
management (IPM) approaches. To this end, a study of lethal and sublethal 
effects on Coccinella septempunctata larvae was conducted, and an age-stage, 
two-sex life table procedure was performed to investigate life-table parameters. 
Cycloxaprid (CYC) was shown to have adverse effects on survival, development, 
total longevity, reproductive capacity, and predation ability in C. 
septempunctata. In addition, demographic growth parameters of the F1 generation 
such as net reproductive rate, and the intrinsic and finite rates of increase 
were significantly decreased under sublethal dosage LR30 (1.91 g ai/hm2). These 
results demonstrated that the population growth of C. septempunctata was 
impacted by a sublethal dosage of CYC. For transcriptome expression, 544 up- and 
338 down-regulated significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs), were 
observed between LR30 treatment and control groups. Moreover, pathways related 
to metabolism of retinol, carcinogenesis, biosynthesis of steroid hormone, P450 
metabolism, and metabolism of xenobiotics were identified in KEGG pathway 
analysis. Ten DEGs were chosen and confirmed with quantitative real-time PCR 
analysis. Based on these findings, CYC should be considered as a component of 
IPM strategies in the field.

BACKGROUND: The Longevity Improvement & Fair Evidence (LIFE) Study, which was 
launched in 2019, is a multi-region community-based database project that aims 
to generate evidence toward extending healthy life expectancy and reducing 
health disparities in Japan. Herein, we describe the LIFE Study's design and 
baseline participant profile.
METHODS: Municipalities participating in the LIFE Study provide data from 
government-administered health insurance enrollees and public assistance 
recipients. These participants cover all disease types and age groups. Centered 
on healthcare claims data, the project also collects long-term care claims data, 
health checkup data, vaccination records, residence-related information, and 
income-related information. The different data types are converted into a common 
data model containing five modules (health care, long-term care, health checkup, 
socioeconomic status, and health services). We calculated the descriptive 
statistics of participants at baseline in 2018.
RESULTS: The LIFE Study currently stores data from 1,420,437 residents of 18 
municipalities. The health care module contains 1,280,756 participants (mean 
age: 65.2 years), the long-term care module contains 189,069 participants (mean 
age: 84.3 years), and the health checkup module contains 274,375 participants 
(mean age: 69.0 years). Although coverage and follow-up rates were lower among 
younger persons, the health care module includes 74,151 children (0-19 years), 
273,157 working-age adults (20-59 years), and 933,448 older persons (≥60 years).
CONCLUSION: The LIFE Study provides data from over 1 million participants and 
can facilitate a wide variety of life-course research and cohort studies. This 
project is expected to be a useful platform for generating real-world evidence 
from Japan.

BACKGROUND: Considering the world's rapidly increasing life expectancy, with 
people working and maintaining active lifestyles longer than ever before, 
addressing the effects of aging on cognition is of utmost importance. A greater 
understanding of cognitive aging may also be critical in distinguishing natural 
cognitive aging from pre-clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease and related 
cognitive disorders.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically examine the association between aging and cognitive 
performance in a cognitively and otherwise healthy probability population-based 
sample using a computer-based method.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 673 cognitively and otherwise 
healthy participants aged 25-89 years (mean age 52.3±14.2 years, 52.5% of whom 
were female) from the Kardiovize study cohort. Mild cognitive impairment and 
dementia cases were excluded, followed by measurement of cognitive performance 
with the computer-administered Cogstate Brief Battery. We used ANCOVA and 
Modified Signed-Likelihood Ratio tests to examine patterns of cognition across 
age groups.
RESULTS: We found a gradual decrease in cognitive performance across the 
lifespan, which required two decades to demonstrate significant changes. In 
contrast to attention and learning, psychomotor speed and working memory showed 
the most significant age-related decrease and variability in performance. The 
established pattern of cognitive aging was not altered by sex or education.
CONCLUSION: These findings corroborate, validate, and extend the current 
understanding of natural cognitive aging and pinpoint specific cognitive domains 
with the most extensive age-related interindividual differences. This will 
contribute to the development of strategies to preserve cognition with aging and 
may also serve to improve early diagnostics of cognitive disorders using 
computer-based methods.

Studies suggest that telomere lengths, a biomarker of aging, could also capture 
the physiological weathering attributable to poor health behaviors and adverse 
experiences, particularly those experienced in early life. For these reasons, we 
propose that telomere lengths may be a pivotal biomarker for measuring the 
heightened susceptibility to illness resulting from the cumulative exposure to 
acculturation to the US culture. This binational study used an Actor-Partner 
Interdependence Model to test if maternal acculturation to the US moderates the 
cross-sectional associations of telomere lengths with percentage of body fat 
(PBF) among Mexican women, among their children, and the intergenerational 
associations of mother and children telomere lengths with each other's PBF. Low 
income Mexican child-mother dyads (n ​= ​108 dyads) were recruited to 
participate in this cross-sectional study in Mexico and the US. The pooled 
dataset included measurements of maternal acculturation to the US, mother and 
children's salivary telomere lengths, PBF measured through bioelectrical 
impedance, and demographic characteristics. Results showed that the influences 
of maternal acculturation in the associations of telomere lengths with PBF were 
different for mothers and their children: Among mothers with higher maternal 
acculturation to the US, longer salivary telomere lengths were associated with 
lower PBF. In contrast, among mothers with lower maternal acculturation to the 
US, salivary telomere lengths were not associated with PBF. There were no 
significant associations between children's salivary telomere lengths and PBF, 
and the null associations did not vary across different levels of maternal 
acculturation to the US. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine 
whether acculturation to the US (experienced through immigration or remotely) 
influences the association of telomere length attrition with obesity risks among 
immigrant and non-immigrant Mexican children and adults.

Alkannin, shikonin (A/S) and their derivatives are naturally occurring 
hydroxynaphthoquinones biosynthesized in some species of the Boraginaceae 
family. These natural compounds have been extensively investigated for their 
biological properties over the last 40 years, demonstrating a plethora of 
activities, such as wound healing, regenerative, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, 
antimicrobial and antioxidant. This study aims to extend the current knowledge 
by investigating the effects of various A/S compounds on two model systems, 
namely on 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The 
former constitutes an established in vitro model for investigating anti-obesity 
and insulin-mimetic properties, while the latter has been widely used as a model 
organism for studying fat accumulation, lifespan and the anthelmintic potential. 
A set of chemically well-defined A/S derivatives were screened for their effect 
on pre-adipocytes to assess cell toxicity, cell morphology, and cell 
differentiation. The differentiation of pre-adipocytes into mature adipocytes 
was examined upon treatment with A/S compounds in the presence/absence of 
insulin, aiming to establish a structure-activity relationship. The majority of 
A/S compounds induced cell proliferation at sub-micromolar concentrations. The 
ester derivatives exhibited higher IC50 values, and thus, proved to be less 
toxic to 3T3-L1 cells. The parent molecules, A and S tested at 1 μM resulted in 
a truncated differentiation with a reduced number of forming lipids, whereas 
compounds lacking the side chain hydroxyl group projected higher populations of 
mature adipocytes. In C. elegans mutant strain SS104, A/S enriched extracts were 
not able to inhibit the fat accumulation but resulted in a drastic shortage of 
survival. Thus, the set of A/S compounds were tested at 15 and 60 μg/ml in the 
wild-type strain N2 for their nematocidal activity, which is of relevance for 
the discovery of anthelmintic drugs. The most pronounced nematocidal activity 
was observed for naphthazarin and β,β-dimethyl-acryl-shikonin, followed by 
isovaleryl-shikonin. The latter 2 A/S esters were identified as the most 
abundant constituents in the mixture of A/S derivatives isolated from Alkanna 
tinctoria (L.) Tausch. Taken together, the findings show that the structural 
variations in the moiety of A/S compounds significantly impact the modulation of 
their biological activities in both model systems investigated in this study.
