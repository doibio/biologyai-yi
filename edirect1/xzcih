OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sorafenib treatment in 
combination with other therapies versus sorafenib monotherapy among patients 
with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are enrolled in Taiwan's 
National Health Insurance.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate treatment outcomes and 
direct medical costs of sorafenib combination therapy and monotherapy from the 
perspective of the healthcare payer in Taiwan. Both life-years (LYs) and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were used to measure treatment outcomes, and 
all costs were expressed in 2014 New Taiwan dollars (NT$). Model parameters were 
acquired primarily using data from population-based administrative databases: 
the Cancer Registry, National Health Insurance Research Database, and the Death 
Registry. Willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at three times the per 
capita gross domestic product at NT$2,133,930. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: For advanced HCC patients, sorafenib combined with other treatments 
might not be a cost-effective option when compared with sorafenib therapy alone. 
In the base-case analysis, combination treatment with sorafenib was estimated to 
increase costs by NT$434,788 compared with monotherapy, with a gain of 0.1595 
QALYs. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
NT$2,725,943 per QALY gained. Results were sensitive to health utility values 
and monthly costs accrued in the progression-free survival state of the 
combination therapy group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence from Taiwan demonstrated that while sorafenib in 
combination with other therapeutic approaches might improve treatment outcome 
when compared with sorafenib monotherapy, its ICER exceeded the WTP threshold 
and was considered not cost-effective.

We estimated age-sex specific and cause-specific mortality, years of life lost 
due to premature mortality (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs) and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to 17 individual 
occupational risks in Iran at the national and subnational levels in 1990-2015 
based on the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015). The burden of 
disease attributable to occupational risk factors was calculated using the 
comparative risk assessment methodology based on 10 outcomes and 21 risk-outcome 
pairs. The temporal changes in the attributable burden of disease were 
decomposed into the contribution of population growth, population ageing, 
risk-deleted DALY rate, and risk exposure. National DALYs attributable to 
occupational risks at the national level in 1990, 2005, and 2015 were 138,210 
(95% uncertainty interval 64,429-223,028), 193,243 (91,645-310,281), and 228,310 
(106,782-371,709), respectively indicating a total increase of 65% (65-67) 
during the study period. Between 1990 and 2015, the share of the attributable 
DALYs for women rose by 55% (51-58) from 13% (12-14) to 20% (19-21). The 
proportion of YLLs in national DALYs attributable to occupational risks during 
the study period slightly decreased from 24% in 1990 to 23% in 2015. The five 
occupational risks with the highest contributions in the national attributable 
DALYs in 2015 were ergonomic factors (107,490), noise (52,122), exposure to 
particulate matter, gases, and fumes (26,847), asthmagens (19,347), and exposure 
to asbestos (7842). From 1990 to 2015, the increase in total DALYs attributable 
to occupational carcinogens (112%) was higher than that for other occupational 
risks. During the study period, changes in risk deleted DALY rate and risk 
exposure led to decreases in total DALYs attributable to occupational risks by 
14% and 30%, respectively. Based on the Gini coefficient, spatial inequality in 
DALY rate attributable to occupational risks at the provincial level decreased 
during 1990-2015. A comprehensive plan for management of exposure to 
occupational risks, especially occupational carcinogens can cause an important 
effect for control of the increasing trend of occupational health losses.

OBJECTIVES: To undertake an economic analysis assessing the cost-effectiveness 
of a single dose of oral dexamethasone compared with placebo for the relief of 
sore throat.
DESIGN: A UK-based, multicentre, two arm, individually randomised, double blind 
trial.
SETTING AND POPULATION: Adults (≥18 years) with acute sore throat and painful 
swallowing judged to be infective in origin, recruited and randomised in primary 
care.
INTERVENTION: a single dose of 10 mg oral dexamethasone compared with placebo 
given at primary care visit.
MAIN OUTCOME: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), cost per 
quality-adjusted symptom resolution using the EuroQol-five dimensions-five 
levels instrument, were estimated as part of a cost-utility analysis performed 
on an intention-to-treat cohort adopting a health payers perspective.
RESULTS: Differences in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) over 7 days from 
baseline and at 24 hours in the dexamethasone compared with the placebo group 
(2.9% and 2.5% higher, respectively) were observed. After controlling for the 
baseline HRQoL imbalances, the economic impact of the intervention was not 
statistically significant: the quality-adjusted life year difference was 
-0.00005 (95% CI -0.0002 to 0.00011) equivalent to a loss in HRQoL of a half 
hour in the dexamethasone group. The average cost per patient associated in the 
dexamethasone and placebo groups in the basecase analysis was £73 and £69, 
respectively. In the basecase probabilistic analysis, the mean ICER was -£6440 
(95% CI -£132 151 to £126 335) and the median ICER was -£304 (IQR-£5816 to 
£3877); suggesting considerable uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The economic burden associated with sore throat is 
substantial and was estimated at £2.35 billion to the healthcare services payer 
based on reported resource use and 2015 UK unit costs. There is considerable 
uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness of a single dose of oral 
dexamethasone as a treatment strategy and therefore insufficient evidence to 
support its use in clinical practice.

Mammalian two-pore channels (TPCs) are activated by the low-abundance membrane 
lipid phosphatidyl-(3,5)-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) present in the endo-lysosomal 
system. Malfunction of human TPC1 or TPC2 (hTPC) results in severe organellar 
storage diseases and membrane trafficking defects. Here, we compared the 
lipid-binding characteristics of hTPC2 and of the PI(3,5)P2-insensitive TPC1 
from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Combination of simulations with 
functional analysis of channel mutants revealed the presence of an 
hTPC2-specific lipid-binding pocket mutually formed by two channel regions 
exposed to the cytosolic side of the membrane. We showed that PI(3,5)P2 is 
simultaneously stabilized by positively charged amino acids (K203, K204, and 
K207) in the linker between transmembrane helices S4 and S5 and by S322 in the 
cytosolic extension of S6. We suggest that PI(3,5)P2 cross links two parts of 
the channel, enabling their coordinated movement during channel gating.

PURPOSE: To assess early and late-term outcomes of patients who had undergone 
pelvic exenteration and simultaneous fecal and urinary diversion with plain wet 
colostomy (PWC) or double-barrelled wet colostomy (DBWC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of all patients who had undergone 
pelvic exenteration and urinary diversion between 2006 and 2017 at our hospital 
were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: In total, 15 patients with a mean age of 56 ± 13 years were included in 
the study. Simultaneous urinary and fecal diversions were carried out as PWC (n 
= 8), or DBWC (n = 7). No significant differences were found between PWC and 
DBWC groups in terms of operation time (373.7 ± 66.5 versus 394.2 ± 133.2 min, P 
= .955), estimated blood loss (862.8 ± 462.4 versus 726.2 ± 489.4 mL, P = .613), 
length of hospital stay (13.2 ± 9.1 versus 14.1 ±6.9 days), early complications 
(25% versus 28.6%, P = 1.0) and late term complications (37.5% versus 42.9%, P = 
1.0). The rate of recurrent pyelonephritis in PWC group was higher than DBWC 
group but not statistically significant (37.5% versus 14.3%, P = .569). Overall 
survival (OS) of the patients was 385 ± 91 days. There was no difference between 
OS of patients with PWC and DBWC (414 ± 165 versus 352 ± 70 days, P = .618).
CONCLUSION: PWC and DBWC are valid options for creating simultaneous urinary and 
fecal diversion after extensive pelvic surgery in patients with short life 
expectancy. DBWC might be superior to PWC in terms of decreased risk of 
recurrent pyelonephritis.

OBJECTIVES: In China, both human urinary kallindinogenase (HUK) and 
3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) are recommended for clinical use to improve cerebral 
blood circulation during an acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The objective was to 
evaluate the economic value of HUK vs NBP for patients with AIS from a Chinese 
payer's perspective.
METHODS: An economic evaluation based on data of patients who have been treated 
with either HUK (n = 488) or NBP (n = 885) from a prospective, phase IV, 
multi-center, clinical registry study (Chinese Acute Ischemic Stroke Treatment 
Outcome Registry, CASTOR) was conducted to analyze the cost and effectiveness of 
HUK vs NBP for AIS in China. Before the analysis, the patients were matched 
using propensity score. Both a cost-minimization analysis and a 
cost-effectiveness analysis were conducted to compare the matched pairs. A 
bootstrapping exercise was conducted for the matched arms to demonstrate the 
probability of one intervention being cost-effective over another for a given 
willingness-to-pay for an extra quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).
RESULTS: After propensity score matching, 463 pairs were matched. The overall 
medical cost in the HUK arm is USD 2,701.20, while the NBP arm is USD 3,436.83, 
indicating HUK is preferred with cost-minimization analysis. Although the QALY 
gained in the HUK arm (0.77176) compared with the NBP arm (0.76831) is 
statistically insignificant (p = .4862), the cost-effectiveness analysis as 
exploratory analysis found that, compared with NBP, HUK is a cost-saving 
strategy with the lower costs of USD 735.63 and greater QALYs gained of 0.00345. 
Among the 5,000 bootstrapping replications, 100% indicates that HUK is 
cost-effective compared with NBP under a 1-time-GDP threshold; and 97.12% 
indicates the same under a 3-time-GDP threshold.
CONCLUSION: This economic evaluation study indicates that administrating HUK is 
a cost-saving therapy compared with NBP for managing blood flow during AIS in 
the Chinese setting.

Chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases leading to target tissue destruction 
and disability are not only causing increase in patients' suffering but also 
contribute to huge economic burden for the society. General increase in life 
expectancy and high prevalence of these diseases both in elderly and younger 
population emphasize the importance of developing safe and effective vaccines. 
In this review, at first the possible mechanisms and risk factors associated 
with chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and type 1 
diabetes (T1D) are discussed. Current advances in the development of vaccines 
for such autoimmune diseases, particularly those based on DNA, altered peptide 
ligands and peptide loaded MHC II complexes are discussed in detail. Finally, 
strategies for improving the efficacy of potential vaccines are explored.

Ricotta fresca is a whey cheese susceptible of secondary contamination, mainly 
from Pseudomonas spp. The extension of the shelf life of refrigerated ricotta 
fresca could be obtained using protective cultures inhibiting the growth of this 
spoilage microorganism. A commercial biopreservative, Lyofast CNBAL, comprising 
Carnobacterium spp was tested against Pseudomonas spp. The surface of ricotta 
fresca samples were inoculated either with Pseudomonas spp or Pseudomonas and 
Carnobacterium spp. Samples were MAP packed, stored at 4 °C and analyzed the day 
of the inoculum and 7, 14 and 21 days after the contamination. Microbiological 
analyses included total bacterial count, mesophilic lactic acid bacteria, 
Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp, Listeria monocytogenes, moulds and yeasts. 
Pseudomonas mean initial contamination level was comparable in blank and 
artificially inoculated samples, respectively with values of 2.15 ± 0.21 and 
2.34 ± 0.26 log cfu g-1. Carnobacterium spp. significantly reduced the growth of 
Pseudomonas spp respectively of 1.28 log and 0.83 log after 14 and 21 days of 
refrigerated storage. Intrinsic properties and physico-chemical composition were 
also investigated. Limited variation of pH was observed in samples inoculated 
with the protective cultures, indicating low acidification properties of 
Carnobacterium spp. Instead, no significant differences were observed for aW, 
moisture, fat and proteins during storage and between inoculated and control 
samples.

BACKGROUND: The management and life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis 
have improved substantially in the past three decades, which has resulted in an 
increased number of these patients being diagnosed with malignancies. Our aim 
was to assess the risk of gastrointestinal cancers in patients with cystic 
fibrosis.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, 
MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane databases with no language 
restrictions for studies published from inception of the databases to Aug 1, 
2017, assessing the risk of gastrointestinal cancers in patients with cystic 
fibrosis. We also searched abstracts from scientific meetings and the 
bibliographies of identified articles for additional references. Studies were 
included if they reported the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) or incidence 
ratio per person-years. No exclusion criteria with regard to patient 
characteristics (age, sex, comorbidities, cystic fibrosis mutation type), study 
setting (location and time period), or method of reporting cancer diagnoses were 
applied. The primary outcome was risk of gastrointestinal cancer and 
site-specific gastrointestinal cancers in patients with cystic fibrosis compared 
with the general population. Pooled summary estimates were calculated using a 
random-effects model, and subgroup analyses were done to establish whether risk 
of gastrointestinal cancer varied according to patient lung transplant status. 
The study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017075396.
FINDINGS: Our search identified 95 681 records, of which six cohort studies 
including 99 925 patients (544 695 person-years) were eligible for the 
meta-analysis. The overall risk of gastrointestinal cancer was significantly 
higher in patients with cystic fibrosis than in the general population (pooled 
SIR 8·13, 95% CI 6·48-10·21; p<0·0001; log SIR 2·10, 95% CI 1·87-2·32; p<0·0001, 
I2=93·93%). Subgroup analyses showed that the risk of gastrointestinal cancer 
among patients with cystic fibrosis who had a lung transplant was increased 
compared with that of patients who did not receive a transplant (pooled SIR 
21·13, 95% CI 14·82-30·14; p<0·0001; log SIR 3·05, 95% CI 2·70-3·41; p<0·0001, 
I2=28·52% vs pooled SIR 4·18, 3·10-5·62; p<0·0001; log SIR 1·43, 1·13-1·73; 
p<0·0001, I2=22·66%). The risk for the following site-specific cancers was also 
significantly increased in patients with cystic fibrosis compared with the 
general population: small bowel cancer (pooled SIR 18·94, 95% CI 9·37-38·27; 
p<0·0001; log SIR 2·94, 95% CI 2·24-3·64; p<0·0001, I2=38·61%), colon cancer 
(10·91, 8·42-14·11; p<0·0001; log SIR 2·39, 2·13-2·65; p<0·0001, I2=88·09%), 
biliary tract cancer (17·87, 8·55-37·36; p<0·0001; log SIR 2·88, 2·15-3·62; 
p<0·0001, I2=10·16%), and pancreatic cancer (6·18, 1·31-29·27; p=0·022; log SIR 
1·82, 0·27-3·38; p<0·0001, I2=62·57%).
INTERPRETATION: Our study suggests that patients with cystic fibrosis had a 
significantly increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer compared with the 
general population, including small bowel, colon, biliary tract, and pancreatic 
cancers. These findings highlight the need to develop individualised screening 
strategies for site-specific gastrointestinal cancers in patients with cystic 
fibrosis.

AIMS: We imaged the sub-mm distribution of labile P and pH in the rhizosphere of 
three plant species to localize zones and hot spots of P depletion and 
accumulation along individual root axes and to relate our findings to nutrient 
acquisition / root exudation strategies in P-limited conditions at different 
soil pH, and to mobilization pattern of other elements (Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, Mn) in 
the rhizosphere.
METHODS: Sub-mm distributions of labile elemental patterns were sampled using 
diffusive gradients in thin films and analysed using laser ablation inductively 
coupled plasma mass spectrometry. pH images were taken using planar optodes.
RESULTS: We found distinct patterns of highly localized labile P depletion and 
accumulation reflecting the complex interaction of plant P acquisition 
strategies with soil pH, fertilizer treatment, root age, and elements (Al, Fe, 
Ca) that are involved in P biogeochemistry in soil. We show that the plants 
respond to P deficiency either by acidification or alkalization, depending on 
initial bulk soil pH and other factors of P solubility.
CONCLUSIONS: P solubilization activities of roots are highly localized, 
typically around root apices, but may also extend towards the extension / root 
hair zone.

The life expectancy of patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia on 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy now approaches that of the general population. 
Approximately 60% of patients treated with second generation tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors achieve a deep molecular response, the prerequisite for a trial of 
treatment-free remission. Those patients unlikely to achieve deep molecular 
response may benefit from more intensive therapy up front. To identify 
biomarkers predicting deep molecular response we performed transcriptional 
profiling on CD34+ progenitor cells from newly diagnosed chronic phase chronic 
myeloid leukemia patients treated with nilotinib on a prospective clinical 
trial. Using unsupervised and targeted analytical strategies, we show that gene 
expression profiles are similar in patients with and without subsequent deep 
molecular response. This result is in contrast to the distinct expression 
signature of CD34+ chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients failing to 
achieve a cytogenetic response on imatinib and suggests that deep molecular 
response to second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors is governed by the 
biology of more primitive chronic myeloid leukemia cells or extrinsic factors.

BACKGROUND: Exemestane (EXE), exemestane + everolimus (EXE + EVE), toremifene 
(TOR), and fulvestrant (FUL) are second-line endocrine therapies for 
postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive (HR +)/human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2-negative (HER2 -) metastatic breast cancer (mBC) in Japan. Although 
the efficacy of these therapies has been shown in recent studies, 
cost-effectiveness has not yet been determined in Japan.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of second-line 
endocrine therapies for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR + and 
HER2 - mBC.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the 
therapies over a 15-year time horizon from a public healthcare payer's 
perspective. The efficacy and utility parameters were determined via a 
systematic search of the literature. Direct medical care costs were used. A 
discount rate of 2% was applied for costs and outcomes. Subgroup analysis was 
performed for non-visceral metastasis. A series of sensitivity analyses, 
including probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and threshold analysis were 
performed.
RESULTS: Base-case analyses estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) of 3 million and 6 million Japanese yen (JPY)/quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained for TOR and FUL 500 mg relative to EXE, respectively. FUL 250 mg 
and EXE + EVE were dominated. The overall survival (OS) highly influenced the 
ICER. With a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 5 million JPY/QALY, the 
probability of TOR being cost-effective was the highest. Subgroup analysis in 
non-visceral metastasis revealed 0.4 and 10% reduction in ICER from the 
base-case results of FUL5 500 mg versus EXE and TOR versus EXE, respectively, 
while threshold analysis indicated EVE and FUL prices should be reduced 73 and 
30%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: As a second-line therapy for postmenopausal women with 
HR +/HER2 - mBC, TOR may be cost-effective relative to other alternatives and 
seems to be the most favorable choice, based on a WTP threshold of 5 million 
JPY/QALY. FUL 250 mg is expected to be as costly and effective as EXE. The 
cost-effectiveness of EXE + EVE and FUL 500 mg could be improved by a large 
price reduction. However, the results are highly sensitive to the hazard ratio 
of OS. Policy makers should carefully interpret and utilize these findings.

OBJECTIVES: A previous epidemiological study of Parkinson's disease (PD) in the 
county of Tartu, Estonia, found an adjusted prevalence rate of 152/100 000 
persons. We aimed to determine PD prevalence almost 20 years later, as well as 
evaluate any dynamic changes in disease frequency compared to the first study.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, community-based study was conducted over 2010-2016 
in the county of Tartu, Estonia. Multiple case-finding sources, including 
information from neurologists, family doctors, the local PD Society, nursing 
institutions, and the database of the Estonian Health Insurance Fund were used 
to identify patients with PD of all ages.
RESULTS: Total crude PD prevalence was 283 and age-adjusted prevalence 
(standardized to the 2014 age structure of the Estonian population) 314/100 000. 
No significant differences in age-adjusted prevalence rates were found between 
men and women, nor people living in urban and rural areas. After adjustment to 
the same standard population used in the previous prevalence study, the overall 
age-adjusted prevalence rate was 197/100 000. Patients in the current study were 
older and often had a more severe form of PD and a longer disease duration, 
compared to those reported in the first epidemiological study 20 years ago.
CONCLUSIONS: The age-specific crude rates in oldest age-groups have risen 
substantially, and the age-adjusted prevalence has moderately increased compared 
to 20 years ago in Estonia. We hypothesize that the increased life expectancy of 
the Estonian population and improved diagnosis of PD contributed most to the 
increase in disease frequency.

A major advantage of analyses on the food group level is that the results are 
better interpretable compared with nutrients or complex dietary patterns. Such 
results are also easier to transfer into recommendations on primary prevention 
of non-communicable diseases. As a consequence, food-based dietary guidelines 
(FBDG) are now the preferred approach to guide the population regarding their 
dietary habits. However, such guidelines should be based on a high grade of 
evidence as requested in many other areas of public health practice. The most 
straightforward approach to generate evidence is meta-analysing published data 
based on a careful definition of the research question. Explicit definitions of 
study questions should include participants, interventions/exposure, 
comparisons, outcomes and study design. Such type of meta-analyses should not 
only focus on categorical comparisons, but also on linear and non-linear 
dose-response associations. Risk of bias of the individual studies of the 
meta-analysis should be assessed, rated and the overall credibility of the 
results scored (e.g. using NutriGrade). Tools such as a measurement tool to 
assess systematic reviews or ROBIS are available to evaluate the methodological 
quality/risk of bias of meta-analyses. To further evaluate the complete picture 
of evidence, we propose conducting network meta-analyses (NMA) of intervention 
trials, mostly on intermediate disease markers. To rank food groups according to 
their impact, disability-adjusted life years can be used for the various 
clinical outcomes and the overall results can be compared across the food 
groups. For future FBDG, we recommend to implement evidence from pairwise and 
NMA and to quantify the health impact of diet-disease relationships.

The development of husbandry practices in non-model laboratory fish used for 
experimental purposes has greatly benefited from the establishment of reference 
fish model systems, such as zebrafish and medaka. In recent years, an emerging 
fish - the turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) - has been adopted by a 
growing number of research groups in the fields of biology of aging and ecology. 
With a captive life span of 4 - 8 months, this species is the shortest-lived 
vertebrate raised in captivity and allows the scientific community to test - in 
a short time - experimental interventions that can lead to alterations of the 
aging rate and life expectancy. Given the unique biology of this species, 
characterized by embryonic diapause, explosive sexual maturation, marked 
morphological and behavioral sexual dimorphism - and their relatively short 
adult life span - ad hoc husbandry practices are in urgent demand. This protocol 
reports a set of key husbandry measures that allow optimal turquoise killifish 
laboratory care, enabling the scientific community to adopt this species as a 
powerful laboratory animal model.

Seasonal influenza is caused by two subtypes of influenza A and two lineages of 
influenza B. Although trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) contain both 
circulating A strains, they contain only a single B-lineage strain. This can 
lead to mismatches between the vaccine and predominant circulating B lineages, a 
concern especially for at-risk populations. Quadrivalent influenza vaccines 
(QIVs) containing a strain from both B lineages have been developed to improve 
protection against influenza. Here, we used a cost-utility model to examine 
whether switching from TIV to QIV would be cost-effective for the at-risk 
population in Italy. Costs were estimated from the payer and societal 
perspectives. The discount rate for outcomes was 3.0%. Univariate and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the effects of 
variations in parameters. Switching from TIV to QIV in Italy was estimated to 
increase quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and produce cost savings, including 
€1.6 million for hospitalization and approximately €2 million in productivity. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €23,426 per QALY from a payer 
perspective and €21,096 per QALY from a societal perspective. Switching to QIV 
was most cost-effective for individuals ≥ 65 years of age (€19,170 per QALY). 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the switching from TIV to QIV 
would be cost-effective for > 91% of simulation at a maximum willingness-to-pay 
threshold of €40,000 per QALY gained. Although the model did not take herd 
protection into account, it predicted that the switch from TIV to QIV would be 
cost-effective for the at-risk population in Italy.

Optimal management of cancer patients with acute coronary syndrome.

Banasiak W, Zymliński R, Undas A.

Cancer at various stages and therapy is observed in about 15% of patients with 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Current guidelines for invasive and conservative 
treatment of ACS cannot be applied to all patients with cancer. The choice of 
antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs should be individualized with clopidogrel 
as a key P2Y12 inhibitor in this population. Major challenges of therapy in 
patients with ACS and cancer include limitations for the use of the recommended 
antithrombotic therapy (particularly in case of cancer-related thrombocytopenia 
or when anticoagulation is needed due to concomitant atrial fibrillation or 
venous thromboembolism), the management of bleeding complications, eligibility 
criteria for cancer surgery, and reinitiation of chemotherapy or radiotherapy 
after ACS. This review summarizes the current evidence and our own experience in 
the treatment of ACS in cancer patients. Since prognosis has considerably 
improved in many cancer patients in the last decade, optimal therapy of ACS may 
increase the life expectancy and reduce the risk of adverse coronary events 
after ACS in this high-risk population.

AIM: This study aims at investigating the nomological validity of the Copenhagen 
Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ II) by using an extension of the Job 
Demands-Resources (JD-R) model with aspects of work ability as outcome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study design is cross-sectional. All staff working at 
public dental organizations in four regions of Sweden were invited to complete 
an electronic questionnaire (75% response rate, n = 1345). The questionnaire was 
based on COPSOQ II scales, the Utrecht Work Engagement scale, and the one-item 
Work Ability Score in combination with a proprietary item. The data was analysed 
by Structural Equation Modelling.
RESULTS: This study contributed to the literature by showing that: A) The scale 
characteristics were satisfactory and the construct validity of COPSOQ 
instrument could be integrated in the JD-R framework; B) Job resources arising 
from leadership may be a driver of the two processes included in the JD-R model; 
and C) Both the health impairment and motivational processes were associated 
with WA, and the results suggested that leadership may impact WA, in 
particularly by securing task resources.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the nomological validity of COPSOQ was supported as 
the JD-R model-can be operationalized by the instrument. This may be helpful for 
transferral of complex survey results and work life theories to practitioners in 
the field.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome of patients with epidural spinal cord 
compression from different solid tumors treated with a combined approach, 
surgery plus radiotherapy (RT), with a follow-up longer than 10 years.
METHODS: Ninety-seven patients treated between 2002 and 2009 were included. 
Surgical treatment was performed in patients with good performance status, 
limited metastatic disease, life expectancy longer than 3 months, and 
progressive neurologic deficit and/or intractable pain. RT was performed 
delivering a median total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Clinical outcome was 
evaluated using the modified visual analog scale for pain, the Frankel scale for 
neurologic deficit, and magnetic resonance imaging before treatment, after 
treatment, and every 3 months thereafter.
RESULTS: Palliative decompression was performed in 27% of patients, tumor 
curettage (debulking) was performed in 51%, and total vertebrectomy was 
performed in 22%, followed by RT in 78% of cases. Pain remission was obtained in 
98% of patients, and recovery of neurologic function was obtained in 51%. The 
median follow-up time was 135 months (range, 96-209 months). The 5- and 10-year 
local control rates were 82.8% and 82.8%, respectively. The median and 5- and 
10-year progression-free survival rates were 12 months, 16.9%, and 11.3%, 
respectively; the median and 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 18 
months, 21.3%, and 12%, respectively. On univariate and multivariate analysis, 
factors recorded as conditioning survival were the performance status and the 
presence of other metastases at the time of vertebral treatment (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our update confirmed that surgery plus RT is a safe and feasible 
treatment with limited morbidity. In selected patients with favorable prognostic 
factors, the combined treatment may significantly impact on survival.

PC12D cells, a subline of rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, extend 
neurites rapidly in response to differentiation stimuli and are used to 
investigate the molecular mechanisms of neurite extension. In the present study, 
we found significant tolerance of PC12D cells against Parkinson's 
disease-related stimuli such as dopamine and 6-hydroxydopamine; this tolerance 
was significantly decreased by a change in the medium. Conditioned medium from 
PC12D cells induced tolerance against oxidative stress, which suggests that 
cytoprotective factor may be released by PC12D cells into the culture medium. 
Conditioned medium-induced tolerance was not found for PC12 cells or human 
neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. A cytoprotective factor generated by PC12D cells 
exhibited hydrogen peroxide-reducing activity. Chemical characterization showed 
that this cytoprotective factor is water soluble and has a molecular weight 
about 1000 Da, and that its activity is inhibited by sodium cyanide. Release of 
this cytoprotective factor was increased by differentiation stimuli and 
oxidative stress. Taken together, these results suggest that release of a 
hydrogen peroxide-reducing factor by PC12D cells increases cell tolerance 
against oxidative stress. This study provides new insights into the 
antioxidative properties of factors in extracellular fluid.
