for breathing by the patient can hardly be relieved by assisted ventilation 
alone. The relief is always guaranteed by a total passive mechanical ventilation 
below the apnea threshold so that the patient does not need to independently 
breathe. A high tidal volume, an adequately high respiratory rate and 
a prolonged inspiration time are necessary in order to reduce the pCO2 to below 
the normal range and to induce passive ventilation. No lung damage has been 
observed with this treatment strategy in a large number of patients.

Während Erkrankungen der Lunge ursächlich zu einem Sauerstoffmangel, einer 
Hypoxämie, führen mit der Indikation, Sauerstoff zu geben, ist die Überlastung 
der Atempumpe Ursache für Hyperkapnie und Luftnot, die durch Beatmung zu 
behandeln sind. Frühzeitige Diagnostik ermöglicht eine rechtzeitige 
nichtinvasive Beatmungstherapie und kann ein Atemversagen und eine akute 
invasive Beatmung vermeiden. Dafür stehen diagnostische Maßnahmen zur Verfügung, 
sodass das Risiko für ein zukünftiges Atemversagen frühzeitig erfassbar ist. 
Auch die Therapie der Atempumpinsuffizienz, der ventilatorischen Insuffizienz, 
ist etabliert: die Entlastung der Atempumpe durch intermittierende Beatmung. 
Tausende Patienten mit ventilatorischer Insuffizienz nutzen eine 
intermittierende oder kontinuierliche Beatmung jeden Tag, um ihre Atemmuskulatur 
zu entlasten. Mehrere Studien haben eine Verlängerung der Lebenserwartung und 
eine Steigerung der Lebensqualität belegt, wenn diese Entlastung zusammen mit 
einer Erniedrigung des pCO2 (Kohlendioxidpartialdruck) sowohl unter Beatmung als 
auch unter Spontanatmung erreicht wird. Wird dieses Ziel der pCO2-Erniedrigung 
nicht erreicht, so kann ein Effekt der Beatmung nicht nachgewiesen werden. Je 
schwerer die Erkrankung, desto schwerer ist es, Entlastung zu erreichen, weil 
die erheblichen Atemanstrengungen des Betroffenen durch nur unterstützende 
Beatmung kaum entlastet werden können. Eine vollständig passive 
Hyperventilation, sodass der Patient unterhalb der Apnoeschwelle nicht selbst 
atmen muss, garantiert die Entlastung. Dazu sind ein hohes Atemzugvolumen, eine 
ausreichende Atemfrequenz und eine ausreichend lange Inspirationszeit notwendig, 
um den pCO2 unter den Normbereich abzusenken und die passive Beatmung 
herbeizuführen. Lungenschäden sind bei dieser an einer Vielzahl von Patienten 
eingesetzten Therapie nicht beobachtet worden.

BACKGROUND: The pursuit of a clearer understanding of the pathogenesis of atrial 
fibrillation (AFib) and the development of new technology has resulted in a 
surge of interest in the surgical ablation for AFib. Here, we report our 8-year 
experience in the surgical treatment and management of AFib alongside, 
evaluating the cost-effectiveness in southern Mainland China over a 1-year 
follow-up.
METHODS: Data of 3,068 patients from March 2011 through June 2019 was 
retrospectively extracted from The Provincial National Cardiac Database of 
Xiangya Second Hospital. The activities considered (and costs calculated) were 
outpatient consultations, hospital admissions, and drug treatment. Quality of 
life (QoL) questionnaires were also carried out to assess whether concomitant 
AFib correction procedures increase risk in patients, or improve patient's QoL.
RESULTS: A total of 3,068 patients completed the questionnaires at a minimum of 
one time-point during the follow-up. The total cost was combined to obtain 
incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The total costs of 
the AFib catheter ablation group were remarkably higher compared to surgery as 
usual group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $76,513,227 
(¥542,287,667) per QALY, with an acceptability line graph for cost at 43%.
CONCLUSIONS: AFib is an extraordinarily costly and worrisome public health 
problem. Precision medicine is vital as it provides a platform for the clinical 
translation of targeted interventions that are designed to help treat and 
prevent AFib. Thus, to improve the QoL expectancy outcome(s), both therapeutic 
and surgical interventions should be aimed at addressing the underlying heart 
disease rather than restoring sinus rhythm.

OBJECT: Low-field intraoperative magnetic resonance (LF-iMR) has demonstrated a 
slight increase in the extent of resection of intra-axial tumors while 
preserving patient`s neurological outcomes. However, whether this improvement is 
cost-effective or not is still matter of controversy. In this clinical 
investigation we sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the implementation 
of a LF-iMR in glioma surgery.
METHODS: Patients undergoing LF-iMR guided glioma surgery with gross total 
resection (GTR) intention were prospectively collected and compared to an 
historical cohort operated without this technology. Socio-demographic and 
clinical variables (pre and postoperative KPS; histopathological classification; 
Extent of resection; postoperative complications; need of re-intervention within 
the first year and 1-year postoperative survival) were collected and analyzed. 
Effectiveness variables were assessed in both groups: Postoperative Karnofsky 
performance status scale (pKPS); overall survival (OS); Progression-free 
survival (PFS); and a variable accounting for the number of patients with a 
greater than subtotal resection and same or higher postoperative KPS (R-KPS). 
All preoperative, procedural and postoperative costs linked to the treatment 
were considered for the cost-effectiveness analysis (diagnostic procedures, 
prosthesis, operating time, hospitalization, consumables, LF-iMR device, etc). 
Deterministic and probabilistic simulations were conducted to evaluate the 
consistency of our analysis.
RESULTS: 50 patients were operated with LF-iMR assistance, while 146 belonged to 
the control group. GTR rate, pKPS, R-KPS, PFS, and 1-year OS were respectively 
13,8% (not significative), 7 points (p < 0.05), 17% (p < 0.05), 38 days (p < 
0.05), and 3.7% (not significative) higher in the intervention group. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis showed a mean incremental cost per patient of 789 € 
in the intervention group. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 111 € per 
additional point of pKPS, 21 € per additional day free of progression, and 46 € 
per additional percentage point of R-KPS.
CONCLUSION: Glioma patients operated under LF-iMR guidance experience a better 
functional outcome, higher resection rates, less complications, better PFS rates 
but similar life expectancy compared to conventional techniques. In terms of 
efficiency, LF-iMR is very close to be a dominant technology in terms of R-KPS, 
PFS and pKPS.

Long-Term Non-invasive Ventilation in Children: Current Use, Indications, and 
Contraindications.

Praud JP(1).

Canada.

This review focuses on the delivery of non-invasive ventilation-i.e., 
intermittent positive-pressure ventilation-in children lasting more than 3 
months. Several recent reviews have brought to light a dramatic escalation in 
the use of long-term non-invasive ventilation in children over the last 30 
years. This is due both to the growing number of children receiving care for 
complex and severe diseases necessitating respiratory support and to the 
availability of LT-NIV equipment that can be used at home. While significant 
gaps in availability persist for smaller children and especially infants, home 
LT-NIV for children with chronic respiratory insufficiency has improved their 
quality of life and decreased the overall cost of care. While long-term NIV is 
usually delivered during sleep, it can also be delivered 24 h a day in selected 
patients. Close collaboration between the hospital complex-care team, the home 
LT-NIV program, and family caregivers is of the utmost importance for successful 
home LT-NIV. Long-term NIV is indicated for respiratory disorders responsible 
for chronic alveolar hypoventilation, with the aim to increase life expectancy 
and maximize quality of life. LT-NIV is considered for conditions that affect 
respiratory-muscle performance (alterations in central respiratory drive or 
neuromuscular function) and/or impose an excessive respiratory load (airway 
obstruction, lung disease, or chest-wall anomalies). Relative contraindications 
for LT-NIV include the inability of the local medical infrastructure to support 
home LT-NIV and poor motivation or inability of the patient/caregivers to 
cooperate or understand recommendations. Anatomic abnormalities that interfere 
with interface fitting, inability to protect the lower airways due to excessive 
airway secretions and/or severely impaired swallowing, or failure of LT-NIV to 
support respiration can lead to considering invasive ventilation via 
tracheostomy. Of note, providing home LT-NIV during the COVID 19 pandemic has 
become more challenging. This is due both to the disruption of medical systems 
and the fear of contaminating care providers and family with aerosols generated 
by a patient positive for SARS-CoV-2 during NIV. Delay in initiating LT-NIV, 
decreased frequency of home visits by the home ventilation program, and 
decreased availability of polysomnography and oximetry/transcutaneous PCO2 
monitoring are observed. Teleconsultations and telemonitoring are being 
developed to mitigate these challenges.

With sustained growth of diabetes numbers, sustained patient engagement is 
essential. Using nationally available data, we have shown that the higher 
mortality associated with a diagnosis of T1DM/T2DM could produces loss of 6.4 
million future life years in the current UK population. In the model, the 
'average' person with T1DM (age 42.8 years) has a life expectancy from now of 
32.6 years, compared to 40.2 years in the equivalent age non diabetes mellitus 
population, corresponding to lost life years (LLYs) of 7.6 years/average person. 
The 'average' person with T2DM (age 65.4 years) has a life expectancy from now 
of 18.6 years compared to the 20.3 years for the equivalent non diabetes 
mellitus population, corresponding to LLY of 1.7 years/average person. We 
estimate that for both T1DM and T2DM, one year with HbA1c >58 mmol/mol loses 
around 100 life days. Linking glycaemic control to mortality has the potential 
to focus minds on effective engagement with therapy and lifestyle recommendation 
adherence.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to estimate the lifetime risk of diabetes and 
diabetes-free life expectancy in metropolitan cities in India among the 
population aged 20 years or more, and their variation by sex, age and BMI.
METHODS: A Markov simulation model was adopted to estimate age-, sex- and 
BMI-specific lifetime risk of developing diabetes and diabetes-free life 
expectancy. The main data inputs used were as follows: age-, sex- and 
BMI-specific incidence rates of diabetes in urban India taken from the Centre 
for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (2010-2018); age-, sex- and 
urban-specific rates of mortality from period lifetables reported by the 
Government of India (2014); and prevalence of diabetes from the Indian Council 
for Medical Research INdia DIABetes study (2008-2015).
RESULTS: Lifetime risk (95% CI) of diabetes in 20-year-old men and women was 
55.5 (51.6, 59.7)% and 64.6 (60.0, 69.5)%, respectively. Women generally had a 
higher lifetime risk across the lifespan. Remaining lifetime risk (95% CI) 
declined with age to 37.7 (30.1, 46.7)% at age 60 years among women and 27.5 
(23.1, 32.4)% in men. Lifetime risk (95% CI) was highest among obese Indians: 
86.0 (76.6, 91.5)% among 20-year-old women and 86.9 (75.4, 93.8)% among men. We 
identified considerably higher diabetes-free life expectancy at lower levels of 
BMI.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Lifetime risk of diabetes in metropolitan cities in 
India is alarming across the spectrum of weight and rises dramatically with 
higher BMI. Prevention of diabetes among metropolitan Indians of all ages is an 
urgent national priority, particularly given the rapid increase in urban 
obesogenic environments across the country. Graphical abstract.

This review is centered on the linear conjugated polyenes, which encompasses 
chromatic biomolecules, such as carotenoids, polyunsaturated aldehydes and 
polyolefinic fatty acids. The linear extension of the conjugated double bonds in 
these molecules is the main feature that determines the spectroscopic properties 
as light-absorbing. These classes of compounds are responsible for the yellow, 
orange, red and purple colors which are observed in their parent flora and fauna 
in nature. Raman spectroscopy has been used as analytical tool for the 
characterization of these molecules, mainly due to the strong light scattering 
produced by the delocalized pi electrons in the carbon chain. In addition, 
conjugated polyenes are one of the main target molecular species for 
astrobiology, and we also present a brief discussion of the use of Raman 
spectroscopy as one of the main analytical tools for the detection of polyenes 
extra-terrestrially.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate long-term safety and tolerability of anifrolumab, a 
human monoclonal antibody to the type I interferon (IFN) receptor subunit 1, in 
patients with moderate-to-severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
METHODS: This 3-year, multinational, open-label extension study included adult 
patients who completed treatment (48 weeks of anifrolumab or placebo; 12-week 
follow-up) in the MUSE phase IIb randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients 
initially received 1,000 mg of anifrolumab intravenously every 4 weeks, which 
was reduced to 300 mg every 4 weeks based on the benefit/risk profile 
established in the MUSE trial. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed monthly. 
Exploratory end points included the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K), 
Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of 
Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI), pharmacodynamics, and health-related quality of 
life (HRQoL).
RESULTS: Of the 246 patients who completed the RCT, 218 (88.6%) enrolled in the 
open-label extension study, of which 139 (63.8%) completed 3 years of treatment. 
Approximately 69.7% of patients reported ≥1 AE during the first year of 
open-label extension treatment. Frequency and patterns of serious AEs and AEs of 
special interest over 3 years were consistent with those reported for 1 year of 
treatment in the RCT. Few patients (6.9%) discontinued treatment due to AEs. No 
new safety signals were identified. Improvement in the SLEDAI-2K was sustained 
over 3 years. SDI and Short Form 36 health survey scores remained stable. 
Neutralization of type I IFN gene signatures was maintained in the IFN-high 
population, and C3, C4, and anti-double-stranded DNA showed trends toward 
sustained improvement.
CONCLUSION: Long-term anifrolumab treatment demonstrates an acceptable safety 
profile with sustained improvement in SLE disease activity, HRQoL, and serologic 
measures.

Cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban versus warfarin in non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation patients with chronic kidney disease in China.

Affiliated Hospital, Hangzhou, China.

WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: In non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients 
with chronic kidney disease (CKD), rivaroxaban was not inferior to warfarin in 
preventing stroke and systemic embolism. However, a comparative evaluation of 
the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban and warfarin therapies for NVAF patients 
at different renal function levels has not yet been reported, and this study 
aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin 
in Chinese NVAF patients with CKD.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) and lifetime costs associated with the use of rivaroxaban relative to 
warfarin in patients with NVAF at different estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) levels as follows: 30 to <50, 50 to <80 and ≥80 mL/min. Input parameters 
were sourced from the clinical literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were performed to assess model uncertainty.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The incrementalQALYs with rivaroxaban was slightly 
increased by approximately 0.3 QALY as compared with that with warfarin in all 
the subgroups, resulting in an ICER of $9,736/QALY (eGFR, 30 to <50 mL/min), 
$9,758/QALY (50 to <80 mL/min) and $9,969/QALY (≥80 mL/min). The probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis suggested a chance of >80% that the ICER would be lower 
than the willingness-to-pay threshold of three times the GDP of China in 2019 in 
all the subgroups. Results were consistent even under the assumption of 
anticoagulant discontinuation after major bleeding events. The model was most 
sensitive to event-free-related utility and survival rates.
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The existing evidence supports the 
cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban therapy as an alternative anticoagulant to 
warfarin for patients with NVAF at different renal function levels.

IMPORTANCE: The neoadjuvant treatment options for ERBB2-positive (also known as 
HER2-positive) breast cancer are associated with different rates of pathologic 
complete response (pCR). The KATHERINE trial showed that adjuvant trastuzumab 
emtansine (T-DM1) can reduce recurrence in patients with residual disease 
compared with patients treated with trastuzumab; however, T-DM1 and other 
ERBB2-targeted agents are costly, and understanding the costs and health 
consequences of various combinations of neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant 
treatments in the United States is needed.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the costs and disease outcomes associated with selection 
of various neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant treatment strategies for patients 
with ERBB2-positive breast cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this economic evaluation, a 
decision-analytic model was developed to evaluate various neoadjuvant followed 
by adjuvant treatment strategies for women with ERBB2-positive breast cancer 
from a health care payer perspective in the United States. The model was 
informed by the KATHERINE trial, other clinical trials with different regimens 
from the KATHERINE trial, the Flatiron Health Database, McKesson Corporation 
data, and other evidence in the published literature. Starting trial median age 
for KATHERINE patients was 49 years (range, 24-79 years in T-DM1 arm and 23-80 
years in trastuzumab arm). The model simulated patients receiving 5 different 
neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant treatment strategies. Data analyses were 
performed from March 2019 to August 2020.
EXPOSURE: There were 4 neoadjuvant regimens: (1) HP: trastuzumab (H) plus 
pertuzumab (P), (2) THP: paclitaxel (T) plus H plus P, (3) DDAC-THP: dose-dense 
anthracycline/cyclophosphamide (DDAC) plus THP, (4) TCHP: docetaxel (T) plus 
carboplatin (C) plus HP. All patients with pCR, regardless of neoadjuvant 
regimen, received adjuvant H. Patients with residual disease received different 
adjuvant therapies depending on the neoadjuvant regimen according to the 5 
following strategies: (1) neoadjuvant DDAC-THP followed by adjuvant H, (2) 
neoadjuvant DDAC-THP followed by adjuvant T-DM1, (3) neoadjuvant THP followed by 
adjuvant DDAC plus T-DM1, (4) neoadjuvant HP followed by adjuvant DDAC/THP plus 
T-DM1, or (5) neoadjuvant TCHP followed by adjuvant T-DM1.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime costs in 2020 US dollars and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated for each treatment strategy, 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated. A strategy was 
classified as dominated if it was associated with fewer QALYs at higher costs 
than the alternative.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, costs ranged from $415 833 (strategy 3) to 
$518 859 (strategy 4), and QALYs ranged from 9.67 (strategy 1) to 10.73 
(strategy 3). Strategy 3 was associated with the highest health benefits (10.73 
QALYs) and lowest costs ($415 833) and dominated all other strategies. 
Probabilistic analysis confirmed that this strategy had the highest probability 
of cost-effectiveness (>70% at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $0-200,000/QALY) 
and was associated with the highest net benefit.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest that neoadjuvant THP followed 
by adjuvant H for patients with pCR or followed by adjuvant DDAC plus T-DM1 for 
patients with residual disease was associated with the highest health benefits 
and lowest costs for women with ERBB2-positive breast cancer compared with other 
treatment strategies considered.

Time to Deprescribe: A Time-Centric Model for Deprescribing at End of Life.

(UIC) College of Pharmacy, Rockford, Illinois, USA.

In end-of-life care, deprescribing practices may vary considerably from one 
practitioner to the next, although most published frameworks for evaluating 
medication appropriateness in advanced illness consider three key principles (1) 
patient and caregiver goals, (2) remaining life expectancy (LE), and (3) 
medication time to benefit (TTB). The objective of this article is to provide 
clinicians with a structured, consistent approach for deprescribing that does 
not replace clinical judgment or the preferences of patients and their families 
but enhances it through clinical data. The emphasis will be on the time 
component of published models, including how to estimate remaining LE and 
medication TTB. Through case examples of two new hospice admissions, LE and TTB 
will be estimated and applied to deprescribing decisions. This time-centric 
approach may satisfy the palliative and hospice clinicians' desire for clear 
clinical justification for medication discontinuation while at the same time 
providing a strategy for communicating deprescribing rationale to patients and 
families.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) not only leads to disability due to joint changes, but 
also significantly shortens the life expectancy of patients, mainly due to more 
frequent occurrence of heart attacks and strokes. Accelerated atherosclerosis in 
these patients is caused, among other factors, by high homocysteine (HCY) 
concentration in blood. Numerous studies have shown that treatment with vitamin 
B significantly reduces the concentration of HCY in blood, but does not reduce 
the risk of heart diseases. Recent studies have shown, however, that folic acid 
(FA) administration reduces the risk of stroke by 10-20%. Due to the fact that 
in patients with RA strokes are more frequent than in the general population and 
hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) is often found, determination of HCY concentration 
in blood is advisable, and in persons with HHCY it is recommended to use FA in 
primary and secondary stroke prevention.

Little information from clinical and modelled studies are available on cost 
effectiveness of OnabotulinumtoxinA and SNM for the treatment of idiopathic 
overactive bladder. We aimed to summarize the evidence in this regard from 
different healthcare systems. Seven studies from 5 countries were reviewed. Some 
modelled studies with a 10-year time frame showed that sacral neuromodulation 
became dominant long-term; others suggested OnabotulinumtoxinA was more cost 
effective at <5 years. There was considerable heterogeneity in the base 
case/sensitivity analysis and statistical modelling among the studies. Clinical 
studies with longer term follow-up will help determine cost effectiveness more 
accurately.

BACKGROUND: Proprioception is the awareness of body parts and includes joint 
position sense, kinesthesia, and sense of force. Cervical spine is one of the 
major affected areas in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), and is an essential 
region for proprioceptive receptors.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cervical joint proprioceptive accuracy by using 
cervical joint positioning error (JPE) method in patients with axSpA and healthy 
controls.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: JPE was calculated for cervical motions in the directions of flexion, 
extension, rotations, and lateral flexions. Time since diagnosis, symptom 
duration, spinal mobility, functional status, quality of life, disease activity, 
and pain were evaluated in axSpA patients. Cervical JPE of axSpA patients was 
also compared according to radiographic status, biologic use, and existence of 
cervical syndesmophytes.
RESULTS: Eighty-two axSpA patients (52 males) and 71 healthy subjects (53 males) 
were evaluated. Cervical JPE was higher in patients with axSpA compared to 
healthy subjects (p < 0.001), except left lateral flexion (p = 0.10). Cervical 
proprioceptive accuracy for extension and left rotation was better in 
biologics+ subgroup compared to biologic- subgroup (p < 0.05). No other 
differences were detected related to radiographic status nor existence of 
cervical syndesmophytes (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Cervical proprioception accuracy is impaired in patients with axSpA. 
It seems that controlling disease activity by using appropriate medication may 
have a positive effect on cervical proprioception accuracy.

Studies show conflicting results on whether exercise interventions to improve 
outcomes for women with breast cancer are cost-effective. We modelled the 
long-term cost-effectiveness of the Exercise for Health intervention compared 
with usual care. A lifetime Markov cohort model for women with early breast 
cancer was constructed taking a societal perspective. Data were obtained from 
trial, epidemiological, quality of life, and healthcare cost reports. Outcomes 
were calculated from 5000 Monte Carlo simulations, and one-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses. Over the cohort's remaining life, the incremental cost for 
the exercise versus usual care groups were $7409 and quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) gained were 0.35 resulting in an incremental cost per QALY ratio of 
AU$21,247 (95% Uncertainty Interval (UI): Dominant, AU$31,398). The likelihood 
that the exercise intervention was cost-effective at acceptable levels was 
93.0%. The incremental cost per life year gained was AU$8894 (95% UI Dominant, 
AU$11,769) with a 99.4% probability of being cost effective. Findings were most 
sensitive to the probability of recurrence in the exercise and usual care 
groups, followed by the costs of out-of-pocket expenses and the model starting 
age. This exercise intervention for women after early-stage breast cancer is 
cost-effective and would be a sound investment of healthcare resources.

Spain.

BACKGROUND: There has been a widespread debate about the overall impact of 
globalization on population, not just economically, but also in terms of health 
status. Moreover, the current health crisis is going to force governments to 
review the structure of the public budget to most effectively alleviate the 
negative economic and health effects on the population.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to analyze the relative importance of 
globalization and the public budget composition-specifically the participation 
of public expenditure on healthcare, social services and environment in gross 
domestic product (GDP)-on life expectancy at birth in European countries during 
the period 1995-2017.
METHODS: The Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) methodology was 
applied to analyze the socioeconomic determinants of life expectancy at birth.
RESULTS: Our findings show that globalization has no relative importance as an 
explanatory variable of life expectancy in European countries, while government 
expenditure on social protection is the most relevant followed by public 
expenditure on health, gross national income per capita, education level of the 
population and public expenditure on environmental protection.
CONCLUSION: European strategies intended to impact on health outcome should 
spend more attention to the composition of public budget.

BACKGROUND: Men who suffer recurrence of bulbar urethral stricture have to 
decide between endoscopic urethrotomy and open urethroplasty to manage their 
urinary symptoms. Evidence of relative clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness is lacking.
OBJECTIVES: To assess benefit, harms and cost-effectiveness of open 
urethroplasty compared with endoscopic urethrotomy as treatment for recurrent 
urethral stricture in men.
DESIGN: Parallel-group, open-label, patient-randomised trial of allocated 
intervention with 6-monthly follow-ups over 24 months. Target sample size was 
210 participants providing outcome data. Participants, clinicians and local 
research staff could not be blinded to allocation. Central trial staff were 
blinded when needed.
SETTING: UK NHS with recruitment from 38 hospital sites.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 222 men requiring operative treatment for recurrence of 
bulbar urethral stricture who had received at least one previous intervention 
for stricture.
INTERVENTIONS: A centralised randomisation system using random blocks allocated 
participants 1 : 1 to open urethroplasty (experimental group) or endoscopic 
urethrotomy (control group).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary clinical outcome was control of urinary 
symptoms. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by cost per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained over 24 months. The main secondary outcome was the need for 
reintervention for stricture recurrence.
RESULTS: The mean difference in the area under the curve of repeated measurement 
of voiding symptoms scored from 0 (no symptoms) to 24 (severe symptoms) between 
the two groups was -0.36 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.78 to 1.02; p = 0.6]. 
Mean voiding symptom scores improved between baseline and 24 months after 
randomisation from 13.4 [standard deviation (SD) 4.5] to 6 (SD 5.5) for 
urethroplasty group and from 13.2 (SD 4.7) to 6.4 (SD 5.3) for urethrotomy. 
Reintervention was less frequent and occurred earlier in the urethroplasty group 
(hazard ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.89; p = 0.02). There were two postoperative 
complications requiring reinterventions in the group that received urethroplasty 
and five, including one death from pulmonary embolism, in the group that 
received urethrotomy. Over 24 months, urethroplasty cost on average more than 
urethrotomy (cost difference £2148, 95% CI £689 to £3606) and resulted in a 
similar number of QALYs (QALY difference -0.01, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.14). 
Therefore, based on current evidence, urethrotomy is considered to be 
cost-effective.
LIMITATIONS: We were able to include only 69 (63%) of the 109 men allocated to 
urethroplasty and 90 (80%) of the 113 men allocated to urethrotomy in the 
primary complete-case intention-to-treat analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The similar magnitude of symptom improvement seen for the two 
procedures over 24 months of follow-up shows that both provide effective symptom 
control. The lower likelihood of further intervention favours urethroplasty, but 
this had a higher cost over the 24 months of follow-up and was unlikely to be 
considered cost-effective.
FUTURE WORK: Formulate methods to incorporate short-term disutility data into 
cost-effectiveness analysis. Survey pathways of care for men with urethral 
stricture, including the use of enhanced recovery after urethroplasty. Establish 
a pragmatic follow-up schedule to allow national audit of outcomes following 
urethral surgery with linkage to NHS Hospital Episode Statistics.

Plain Language Summary: The urethra carries urine from the bladder to the tip of 
the penis. Men can develop a condition called urethral stricture when part of 
the urethra narrows due to scarring. This can lead to difficulties in passing 
urine and can recur. There are two operations for urethral stricture. The 
standard approach is endoscopic urethrotomy. The alternative is open 
urethroplasty. This study wanted to find out which operation was preferable in 
terms of symptom control, time before further surgery and which operation was 
best value for the NHS. All aspects of the study were informed by patients. Two 
hundred and twenty-two men who had received at least one previous operation for 
stricture took part. The choice of operation was decided by chance 
(randomisation). Of these men, 113 were randomised to urethrotomy and 109 were 
randomised to urethroplasty. Following their operation, the men filled in 
questionnaires every 3–6 months for 2 years about their symptoms and if any 
further surgery was needed. The two groups were then compared. Of the 222 men 
who took part, 159 provided enough information for inclusion in the comparison 
(90 were in the urethrotomy group and 69 were in the urethroplasty group). The 
improvement over time in urinary symptoms was similar for the two groups. Men in 
the urethrotomy group were twice as likely to need a further operation over the 
2-year study period. Very few men experienced serious complications. This study 
showed that both operations led to symptom improvement for men with recurrent 
urethral stricture. Urethroplasty, however, appears unlikely to offer good value 
for money for the NHS. Men needing treatment for recurrent urethral stricture 
can use this information to weigh up the pros and cons of each operation to 
decide with their clinical team which one to undergo.

OBJECTIVE: Recurrent pericarditis (RP) incurs significant morbidity. Rilonacept 
inhibits both interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α) and IL-1β; these cytokines are thought 
to play a major role in RP. This phase II study evaluated rilonacept efficacy 
and safety in RP.
METHODS: This multicentre, open-label study enrolled adult patients with 
idiopathic or postpericardiotomy RP, symptomatic (≥2 pericarditis recurrences) 
or corticosteroid (CS) dependent (≥2 recurrences prior).Patients received 
rilonacept 320 mg SC load/160 mg SC weekly maintenance in a 6-week base 
treatment period (TP) followed by an optional 18-week on-treatment extension 
period (EP) (option to wean background therapy).
RESULTS: Outcomes: pericarditis pain (numeric rating scale (NRS)) and 
inflammation (C reactive protein (CRP)) for symptomatic patients; disease 
activity after CS taper for CS-dependent patients.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: health-related quality of life (HRQOL), pericarditis 
manifestations and additional medications. 25 unique patients enrolled, while 23 
completed the EP (seven colchicine failures and five CS failures). In 
symptomatic patients, NRS and CRP decreased; response was observed after first 
rilonacept dose. NRS decreased from 4.5 at baseline to 0.7, and CRP decreased 
from 4.62 mg/dL at baseline to 0.38 mg/dL at end of TP. Median time to CRP 
normalisation: 9 days. Pericarditis manifestations resolved. 13 patients on CS 
at baseline completed the EP; 11 (84.6%) discontinued CS, and 2 tapered; CRP and 
NRS remained low without recurrence. Mean HRQOL scores improved in symptomatic 
patients. One serious adverse event (SAE) resulted in discontinuation of 
rilonacept.
CONCLUSIONS: Rilonacept led to rapid and sustained improvement in pain, 
inflammation (CRP and pericarditis manifestations) and HRQOL. CSs were 
successfully tapered or discontinued; safety was consistent with known 
rilonacept safety profile.
