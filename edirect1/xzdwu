BACKGROUND: Increased life expectancy and improved perioperative management have 
resulted in increased utilization of hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) among elderly patients. However, individualized model for predicting the 
surgical safety and efficacy is lacking. The present study aimed to develop a 
safety and efficacy-associated risk calculator for HCC in the elderly after 
resection (SEARCHER).
METHODS: From an international multicenter database, elderly patients who 
underwent curative-intent hepatectomy for HCC were stratified by patient age: 
65-69 years, 70-74 years, 75-79 years, and ≥80 years. Short- and long-term 
outcomes among the 4 groups were compared. Univariate and multivariate analyses 
of risk factors of postoperative major morbidity, cancer-specific survival (CSS) 
and overall survival (OS) were performed in the training cohort. A 
nomogram-based online calculator was then constructed and validated in the 
validation cohort.
RESULTS: With increasing age, the risk of postoperative major morbidity and 
worse OS increased (P = 0.001 and 0.020), but not postoperative mortality and 
CSS (P = 0.577 and 0.890) among patients across the 4 groups. Based on three 
nomograms to predict major morbidity, CSS and OS, the SEARCHER model was 
constructed and made available at https://elderlyhcc.shinyapps.io/SEARCHER. The 
model demonstrated excellent calibration and optimal performance in both the 
training and validation cohorts, and performed better than the several 
commonly-used conventional scoring and staging systems of HCC.
CONCLUSIONS: With higher potential postoperative major morbidity and worse OS as 
patients age, the decision of whether to perform a hepatectomy for HCC needs to 
be comprehensively considered in the elderly. The proposed SEARCHER model 
demonstrated good performance to individually predict safety and efficacy of 
hepatectomy in elderly patients with HCC.

BACKGROUND: Identification of modifiable risk factors that may impact chronic 
disease risk is critical to public health. Our study objective was to conduct a 
theoretical population attributable risk analysis to estimate the burden of 
disease from low dairy intake and to estimate the impact of increased dairy 
intake on United States (US)-based disability adjusted life years (DALYs).
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify 
statistically significant summary relative risk estimates (SRREs) from recent 
meta-analyses of dairy consumption and key chronic disease outcomes. The SRREs 
were applied to preventive fractions using a range of categories (low to high) 
for population consumption of dairy products. The preventive fraction estimates 
were then applied to the number of DALYs for each health outcome in the US based 
on 2019 WHO estimates. The population attributable risk proportion estimates 
were calculated using the inverse of the SRRE from each meta-analysis using the 
same range of categories of consumption. These values were subsequently applied 
to the DALYs estimates to estimate the theoretical burden of disease 
attributable to low dairy intake.
RESULTS: Statistically significant SRREs were identified in recent meta-analyses 
of total dairy consumption in relation to breast cancer, colorectal cancer, 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), stroke, and hypertension. 
In this theoretical analysis, nearly 850,000 DALYs (or 5.0% of estimated years 
of healthy life lost) due to CVD and 200,000 DALYs (4.5%) due to T2D may be 
prevented by increased dairy consumption. Approximately 100,000 DALYs due to 
breast cancer (7.5%) and approximately 120,000 DALYs (8.5%) due to colorectal 
cancer may be prevented by high dairy intake. The numbers of DALYs for stroke 
and hypertension that may be prevented by increased dairy consumption were 
approximately 210,000 (6.0%) and 74,000 (5.5%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of dairy products has been associated with decreased 
risk of multiple chronic diseases of significant public health importance. The 
burden of disease that may potentially be prevented by increasing dairy 
consumption is substantial, and population-wide improvement in meeting 
recommended daily dairy intake goals could have a notable public health impact. 
However, this analysis is theoretical, and thus additional studies providing 
empirical evidence are needed to further clarify potential relationships between 
dairy intake and various health outcomes.

AIMS: Although life expectancy in adults with congenital heart diseases (CHD) 
has increased dramatically over the past five decades, still a substantial 
number of patients dies prematurely. To gain understanding in the trajectories 
of dying in adults with CHD, the last year of life warrants further 
investigation. Therefore, our study aimed to (i) define the causes of death and 
(ii) describe the patterns of healthcare utilization in the last year of life of 
adults with CHD.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective mortality follow-back study used 
healthcare claims and clinical data from BELCODAC, which includes patients with 
CHD from Belgium. Healthcare utilization comprises cardiovascular procedures, 
CHD physician contacts, general practitioner visits, hospitalizations, emergency 
department (ED) visits, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and specialist 
palliative care, and was identified using nomenclature codes. Of the 390 
included patients, almost half of the study population (45%) died from a 
cardiovascular cause. In the last year of life, 87% of patients were 
hospitalized, 78% of patients had an ED visit, and 19% of patients had an ICU 
admission. Specialist palliative care was provided to 17% of patients, and to 
only 4% when looking at the patients with cardiovascular causes of death.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a high use of intensive and potentially avoidable care at 
the end of life. This may imply that end-of-life care provision can be improved. 
Future studies should further examine end-of-life care provision in the light of 
patient's needs and preferences, and how the healthcare system can adequately 
respond.

PURPOSE: We performed an economic evaluation, from a societal perspective, to 
examine the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of a wearable multimodal seizure 
detection device: NightWatch.
METHODS: We collected data between November 2018 and June 2020 from the PROMISE 
trial (NCT03909984), including children aged 4-16 years with refractory epilepsy 
living at home. Caregivers completed questionnaires on stress, quality of life, 
health care consumption and productivity costs after two-month baseline and 
two-month intervention with NightWatch. We used costs, stress levels and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs). Missing items were handled by mean imputation. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the results including 
bootstrap sampling.
RESULTS: We included 41 children (44% female; mean age 9.8 years, standard 
deviation (SD) 3.7 years). Total societal costs of the baseline period (T1) were 
on average €3,238 per patient, whereas after intervention (T2) this reduced to 
2,463 (saving €775). The QALYs were similar between both periods (mean QALY 0.90 
per participant, SD at T1 0.10, SD at T2 0.13). At a ceiling ratio of €50.000, 
NightWatch showed a 72% cost-effective probability. Univariate sensitivity 
analyses, on the perspective and imputation method, demonstrated result 
robustness.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that NightWatch might be a cost-effective 
addition to current standard care for children with refractory epilepsy living 
at home. Further research with an additional target group for a large timeframe 
may support the findings of this research.

Brain tumors are the most frequently occurring and severe type of cancer, with a 
life expectancy of only a few months in most advanced stages. As a result, 
planning the best course of therapy is critical to improve a patient's ability 
to fight cancer and their quality of life. Various imaging modalities, such as 
computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound 
imaging, are commonly employed to assess a brain tumor. This research proposes a 
novel technique for extracting and classifying tumor features in 3D brain slice 
images. After input images are processed for noise removal, resizing, and 
smoothening, features of brain tumor are extracted using Volume of Interest 
(VOI). The extracted features are then classified using the Deformable 
Hierarchical Heuristic Model-Deep Deconvolutional Residual Network (DHHM-DDRN) 
based on surfaces, curves, and geometric patterns. Experimental results show 
that proposed approach obtained an accuracy of 95%, DSC of 83%, precision of 
80%, recall of 85%, and F1 score of 55% for classifying brain cancer features.

BACKGROUND: This study compared the incidence of Meniere's disease (MD) in the 
elderly aged >65 years between the first (2001-2010) and second (2011-2020) 
decades to investigate the evolution of geriatric MD.
METHODS: Totally, 1605 and 2550 patients with definite MD were experienced at 
the neurotological clinic during the first and the second decades, respectively. 
All patients were divided into three groups by 30-year age band, namely elderly 
(aged 65-94 years), adult (aged 35-64 years) and young (aged 5-34 years) groups, 
and underwent an inner ear test battery. Factors relating to the incidence of MD 
during the past two decades were analyzed.
RESULTS: The elderly MD group comprised 198 (12.4%) of 1605 MD cases during the 
first decade, and 463 (18.2%) of 2550 MD cases during the second decade, showing 
a significantly increased incidence of elderly MD. Correlation between annual 
life expectancy (x) in Taiwan and annual prevalence (y) of the elderly MD in 
relation to total MD cases revealed y = 0.023x - 1.660 via linear regression 
analysis. In contrast, the adult MD group significantly differed in terms of age 
and gender ratio, but not incidence, between the two decades. Conversely, the 
young MD group exhibited significantly decreased incidence from the first decade 
(22.3%) to the second decade (13.8%).
CONCLUSION: Evolution of geriatric MD during the past two decades reveals an 
increased incidence of the elderly MD patients, likely due to increased life 
expectancy coupled with altered life style.

BACKGROUND: Increasing demographic healthcare challenges, such as increased life 
expectancy coupled with increased use of medicines for complex morbidities, 
point to the need for globally applicable transformative policies in health 
workforce development. The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) has 
established a set of 21 Global Development Goals (FIP DGs) to strengthen 
pharmacy workforce and benchmark professional developmental needs.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify policy directions and factors affecting 
pharmacy workforce development across the Commonwealth, and to examine country 
progress made towards implementing workforce oriented FIP DGs.
METHODS: The study involved a literature review and a global survey of 
commonwealth countries professional leadership bodies. The literature database 
search included PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, Scopus and PsychINFO databases as well 
as the websites of the respective national pharmacy organisations of 
Commonwealth countries. A global survey was also conducted to assess 
country-level alignment with the workforce component of FIP DGs.
RESULTS: Thirty-one articles representing 21 Commonwealth countries were 
included in the literature overview. The development needs identified were 
workforce shortages and inequitable distribution across practice areas and 
geographical regions, low workforce supply capacity, workforce feminisation, 
lack of professional recognition, limited training opportunities, low job 
satisfaction, high workload and attrition. The survey showed disparities in 
country-level progress and alignment with the FIP DGs. High-income countries in 
the survey sample reported alignment with most of the FIP DGs, while the 
low-income countries reported alignment with fewer DGs. More than two-thirds of 
the countries showed alignment with the FIP DGs related to academic capacity, 
early career training, quality assurance and advancing integrated services. 
About half reported alignment with the FIP DGs related to competency and 
leadership development, respectively, while only a third aligned with the equity 
and equality DG.
CONCLUSION: This study identified realistic pharmacy workforce developmental 
needs across a range of Commonwealth countries. Addressing these needs through 
appropriate policy interventions will be essential for increasing the pharmacy 
workforce capacity and assuring the delivery of high-quality pharmaceutical care 
and medicines expertise in these countries.

Obesity is a complex, chronic disease and global public health challenge. 
Characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the body, obesity sharply 
increases the risk of several diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and is linked to lower life 
expectancy. Although lifestyle intervention (diet and exercise) has remarkable 
effects on weight management, achieving long-term success at weight loss is 
extremely challenging, and the prevalence of obesity continues to rise 
worldwide. Over the past decades, the pathophysiology of obesity has been 
extensively investigated, and an increasing number of signal transduction 
pathways have been implicated in obesity, making it possible to fight obesity in 
a more effective and precise way. In this review, we summarize recent advances 
in the pathogenesis of obesity from both experimental and clinical studies, 
focusing on signaling pathways and their roles in the regulation of food intake, 
glucose homeostasis, adipogenesis, thermogenesis, and chronic inflammation. We 
also discuss the current anti-obesity drugs, as well as weight loss compounds in 
clinical trials, that target these signals. The evolving knowledge of signaling 
transduction may shed light on the future direction of obesity research, as we 
move into a new era of precision medicine.

BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading cause of cancer death and an 
important barrier to increasing life expectancy in China. Early detection of GC 
can significantly reduce its mortality rate.
METHODS: A new plasma-based multiplex DNA methylation assay combining 
simultaneous detection of three biomarkers (KCNQ5, C9orf50 and CLIP4) and one 
control gene (ACTB) was developed. It was used to examine 12 paired tissue 
samples and a training cohort of 151 plasma samples. Its performance was 
subsequently confirmed in validation cohort 1 (n = 105) and validation cohort 2 
(n = 139).
RESULTS: Three methylation markers showed significantly higher methylation 
levels in GC tissues than in paired adjacent tissues. The assay showed a 
sensitivity of 67.9 % with a specificity of 86.6 % for GC detection in the 
training cohort, and the AUC was 0.786 (95 % CI: 0.701-0.855). The methylation 
levels in GC patients were significantly higher than those in benign gastric 
tumors and in control group. Meanwhile, the assay achieved a sensitivity of 
65.5 % with a specificity of 90.0 % in the validation cohort 1, and the AUC was 
0.805 (95 % CI: 0.716-0.876). In the validation cohort 2, its sensitivity and 
specificity were 73.7 % and 84.1 %, respectively, and the AUC was 0.851 (95 % 
CI: 0.776-0.909).
CONCLUSION: The plasma-based multiplex DNA methylation assay was highly specific 
for GC early detection. It has the potential to become an alternative approach 
to improve diagnosis of GC in the clinics.

and Aquila optimization classifier.

Recently genetic disorders are the most common reason for human fatality. Sickle 
Cell anemia is a monogenic disorder caused by A-to-T point mutations in the 
β-globin gene which produces abnormal hemoglobin S (Hgb S) that polymerizes at 
the state of deoxygenation thus resulting in the physical deformation or 
erythrocytes sickling. This shortens the expectancy of human life. Thus, the 
early diagnosis and identification of sickle cell will aid the people in 
recognizing signs and to take treatments. The manual identification is a time 
consuming one and might outcome in the misclassification of count as there is 
millions of red blood cells in one spell. So as to overcome this, data mining 
approaches like Quantum graph theory model and classifier is effective in 
detecting sickle cell anemia with high precision rate. The proposed work aims at 
presenting a mathematical modeling using Quantum graph theory to extract 
elasticity properties and to distinguish them as normal cells and sickle cell 
anemia (SCA) in red blood cells. Initially, input DNA sequence is taken and the 
elasticity property features are extracted by using Quantum graph theory model 
at which the formation of spanning tree is made followed by graph construction 
and Hemoglobin quantization. After which, the extracted properties are optimized 
using Aquila optimization and classified using cascaded Long Short-Term memory 
(LSTM) to attain the classified outcome of sickle cell and normal cells. 
Finally, the performance assessment is made and the outcomes attained in terms 
of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC are compared with 
existing classifier to validate the proposed system effectiveness.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic inflammatory disease affecting 
primarily peripheral joints, which is only partially controlled with current 
treatments. RA leads to pain, disability, deformities, and life expectancy 
shortening. Its pathogenesis is complex involving multiple cell types and 
signaling pathways that we incompletely understand. One of the pathways we have 
elucidated starts with WNT5A signaling and contributes to the aggressive 
phenotype of the RA synoviocytes through RYK-RhoA/ROCK signaling. Now, we have 
explored the contribution of ROCK to arthritis in vivo, using the K/BxN 
serum-transfer arthritis model; and to osteoclastogenesis, using the arthritis 
model and cells from patients with inflammatory arthritis. The mice and cells 
were treated with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 that caused a significant 
improvement of arthritis and reduction of osteoclastogenesis. The improvement in 
mouse arthritis was observed in the clinical evaluation and, histologically, in 
synovial inflammation, cartilage damage, bone erosion, and the abundance of 
multinucleated TRAP+ cells. Expression of inflammatory mediators in the 
arthritic joints, as assessed by real-time PCR, was also significantly reduced. 
The effect on bone was confirmed with in vitro assays using bone marrow 
precursors of arthritic mice and peripheral blood monocytes of patients with 
inflammatory arthritis. These assays showed dramatically reduced 
osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Overall, our findings suggest that ROCK 
inhibition could be part of a therapeutic strategy for RA by its dual action on 
inflammation and bone erosion.

different genders: Evidence from Hangzhou, China.

In China, it is critical to help older adults cope with depression due to the 
emerging impacts of factors such as increased life expectancy and the 
"one-child" family planning policy. Meanwhile, differences in retirement age 
have different effects on health in older adults of different gender. The 
relationship of gender differences in social capital and depression across the 
elderly population was unclear. Focusing on this demographic, this study 
conducted a telephone survey to explore the relationship between social capital 
and depression. Referring to electronic medical records, we randomly selected 
1,042 elderly respondents (426 men, 616 women) from four areas in Hangzhou. We 
used social capital measurements and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) to 
assess social capital and depression, respectively, then employed a multivariate 
logistic regression and structural equation modeling to examine the associations 
between factors, along with a consideration of gender. This study was discovered 
that differences in both income and morbidity contributed to differences in 
social capital and depression. In our sample of elderly respondents, we also 
found gender-based differences in cognitive and structural social capital. 
Compared to men, women were more likely to attain higher social capital and less 
likely to develop depression. At the same time, social networking and social 
engagement had negative impacts on depression in women, which was not the case 
for men. We found that lower reciprocity (men and women), social work (men), and 
trust (women) indicated higher risks of depression. Reciprocity and social 
networks were significantly and negatively correlated with depression among male 
respondents; in the male model, factors of trust, reciprocity, and social 
participation had positive effects on reducing the risk of depression, while 
social networks had a negative effect. For elderly persons, these findings 
suggest that mental health is affected by differences in social capital caused 
by policy differences and cultural differences caused by gender differences.

OBJECTIVE: Current guidelines recommend the gastric cancer risk score scale 
(GCRSS) for screening in gastric cancer (GC) high-risk populations in China. 
This study aimed to estimate the clinical benefits, harms, cost, and 
cost-effectiveness of the GCRSS screening strategy from a Chinese healthcare 
system perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a microsimulation model, we evaluated 7 screening 
scenarios of the GCRSS with varying starting ages. We simulated 100,000 
individuals from the age of 20 for each screening scenario. The main outcomes 
included GC incidence reduction, number of cause-specific deaths, costs, 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), 
and benefit-to-harm ratio. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
were done to explore the robustness of model findings.
RESULTS: Screening with the GCRSS strategy at the age of 40 years (40-GCRSS) 
provided the greatest reduction of GC incidence by 70.6%, with 7,374 GC deaths 
averted per 100,000 individuals and the lowest benefit-to-harm ratio of 0.392. 
Compared with no screening or previous less costly strategy, at a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $37,655 per QALY, the 40-GCRSS strategy 
was cost-effective, with ICERs of $12,586 and $29,115 per QALY, respectively. 
Results were robust across univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. 
The 40-GCRSS strategy showed a 0.856 probability of being cost-effective at a 
$37,655 per QALY WTP threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the GCRSS strategy is effective and 
cost-effective in reducing the GC disease burden in China from a Chinese 
healthcare system perspective. Screening from the age of 40 would be the optimal 
strategy.

In this study, an oomycete strain FQ01 of Phytophthora nicotianae, which could 
cause destructive postharvest disease, was isolated. At present, chemical 
fungicides are the main reagents used for controlling Phytophthora diseases. It 
is necessary to find new control techniques that are environmentally friendly. 
The biocontrol activity of Hanseniaspora uvarum MP1861 against P. nicotianae 
FQ01 was therefore investigated. Our results revealed that the volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs) released by the yeast strain MP1861 could inhibit the 
development of P. nicotianae FQ01. The major component of the VOCs produced by 
the yeast strain MP1861 was identified to be ethyl acetate (70.8%). Biocontrol 
experiments showed that Phytophthora disease in tomato fruit could be reduced by 
95.8% after the yeast VOCs treatment. Furthermore, ethyl acetate inhibited the 
mycelial growth of the oomycete strain FQ01, and damaged the pathogen cell 
membrane. This paper describes the pioneering utilization of the yeast strain 
MP1861 for biocontrol of postharvest fruit rot in tomato caused by P. 
nicotianae.

We describe a rare life-saving case of penetrating subclavian vessel injury that 
was managed successfully at King Saud Medical City, a major trauma center in 
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The patient was a healthy 21-year-old Saudi male who was 
presented initially at Al-Aflaj Hospital, 300 km away from King Saud Medical 
City, following a stab with a knife to the left side of his lower neck. He was 
transferred to King Saud Medical City for definitive surgical management after 
having temporary bleeding control at Al-Aflaj Hospital. The patient was 
successfully managed with a median sternotomy, left supraclavicular extension, 
and clavicular division. Hemostasis was achieved by ligating the injured 
subclavian vessels in a situation of extremes to save a life. His postoperative 
course was uneventful. He was discharged on the eleventh postoperative day with 
an intact neurovascular condition of the left upper limb.

Comprehensive visual electrophysiological measurements discover crucial changes 
caused by alcohol addiction in humans: Clinical values in early prevention of 
alcoholic vision decline.

Alcohol addiction often compromises vision by impairing the visual pathway, 
particularly the retina and optic nerve. Vision decline in alcoholics consists 
of a sequential transition from reversible functional deterioration of the 
visual pathway to irreversible clinical vision degeneration or vision loss. 
Thus, the control of alcoholic vision decline should focus on prevention before 
permanent damage occurs. Visual electrophysiology is a promising method for 
early detection of retinal dysfunction and optic neuropathy, including 
full-field electroretinography (ffERG) and pattern-reversal visual evoked 
potential (PR-VEP). So far, however, research studying the electrophysiological 
characteristics in the preclinical stage of vision decline caused by alcohol 
addiction is still lacking. Here we conducted a retrospective study with 11 
alcoholics and 14 matched control individuals to address this need. We had 
performed comprehensive visual electrophysiological tests, including ffERG and 
PR-VEP. We next analyzed all electrophysiological parameters using multivariate 
statistical analyses and discovered some highly sensitive alterations to alcohol 
addiction. We found severely reduced amplitudes in scotopic ffERG oscillatory 
potentials (OPs) in alcohol addicts. These changes indicate the alcohol-induced 
disturbances of amacrine cells and retinal circulation. In subjects with alcohol 
addiction, the amplitudes of b-waves diminish significantly in scotopic but not 
photopic ffERG, implying the impaired function of the retinal rod system and the 
dysfunction of the inner retina. PR-VEPs elicited by checkerboard stimuli with 
large 1 degree (°) checks mainly reflect the state of the optic nerve and 
ganglion cells, and PR-VEPs provoked by small 0.25° checks mainly reflect the 
function of the macular. We performed both measurements and observed a robust 
amplitude reduction in all three peaks (N75-P100, P100-N135) and a significant 
peak time extension in P100. Our research provides an affordable and 
non-invasive tool to accurately evaluate visual pathway conditions in alcohol 
addicts and help clinicians take targeted treatment.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease in Europe and 
North America requiring a surgical or interventional treatment. Due to 
demographic changes with an aging population the burden of valvular heart 
diseases and especially the importance of aortic stenosis (AS) will be growing 
in future. As the onset of symptoms is associated with a decrease in life 
expectancy appropriate and early diagnosis are of utmost importance. However, 
insights of clinical practice underline diagnostic challenges which may lead to 
a delayed initiation of treatment with an adverse effect on the prognosis. The 
aim of this review is to display different diagnostic approaches that may be 
helpful in detecting patients with aortic valve stenosis. This review will focus 
on both non-invasive and invasive diagnostic approaches that can be implemented 
in clinical routine. Further-more, we will especially highlight recommendations 
of the 2021 European guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease.
METHODS: For this review a selective literature research on the databases PubMed 
and Google Scholar was conducted. Original articles, reviews and meta-analyses 
were included when meeting our search criteria. Following terms were used in 
different combinations: Aortic valve stenosis; Aortic stenosis; diagnosis of 
aortic stenosis; ESC Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease.

Alterations in the components of the immune system occur with aging. The 
introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically 
improved life expectancy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected 
individuals by suppressing viral replication and increasing CD4+ T-cell counts. 
Immunosenescence-like changes, including the expansion of memory CD8+ T cells 
with senescent features, are reported in young HIV-infected individuals who do 
not have clinically detectable viremia on ART. However, it is less known whether 
HIV infection affects the immunosenescent status in older HIV-infected 
individuals. Here, we addressed this question in older HIV-infected, 
HIV-uninfected, and frail individuals (all groups age ≥65 years) by examining a 
set of aging-associated genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as 
well as by analyzing subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in depth using 
high-dimensional CyTOF analysis. Older HIV-infected individuals had increased 
expression of aging-associated genes such as CX3CR1 in PBMCs which are related 
to IL-7 receptor low effector memory (IL-7Rαlow EM) CD8+ T cells, a cell 
population known to expand with age. The subsets of IL-7Rαlow EM CD8+ T cells 
expressing senescent, cytotoxic, and inflammatory molecules, including CD57, 
perforin, and CX3CR1, as well as memory CD4+ T cells expressing CD161 and CXCR3, 
molecules associated with replication-competent HIV-1 harboring cells, were 
increased in older HIV-infected individuals. Overall, older HIV-infected 
individuals without detectable viremia on ART had augmented levels of 
age-associated immune alterations in PBMCs, suggesting that HIV infection has a 
persistent impact on senescence in older HIV-infected individuals despite the 
clinically controlled viremia.
