with an incremental cost of US$71,884.42, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$64,338.19, which is beyond the 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of China. According to sensitivity analyses, 
the ICERs were most sensitive to the utility of progressive disease and the cost 
of pembrolizumab. However, those parameters had no significant impact on the 
model's outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of pembrolizumab to various therapy combinations 
chemotherapy is exorbitant and may not be cost-effective for patients with 
recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer in China.

AIM: Screening for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is key in identifying 
patients with undiagnosed disease who may be eligible for anticoagulation 
therapy. Understanding the economic value of screening is necessary to assess 
optimal strategies for payers and healthcare systems. We evaluated the cost 
effectiveness of opportunistic screening with handheld digital devices and pulse 
palpation, as well as targeted screening predictive algorithms for UK patients 
≥75 years of age.
METHODS: A previously developed Markov cohort model was adapted to evaluate 
clinical and economic outcomes of opportunistic screening including pulse 
palpation, Zenicor (extended 14 days), KardiaMobile (extended), and two 
algorithms compared to no screening. Key model inputs including epidemiology 
estimates, screening effectiveness, and risks for medical events were derived 
from the STROKESTOP, ARISTOTLE studies, and published literature, and cost 
inputs were obtained from a UK national cost database. Health and cost outcomes, 
annually discounted at 3.5%, were reported for a cohort of 10,000 patients vs. 
no screening over a time horizon equivalent to a patient's lifetime, Analyses 
were performed from a UK National Health Services and personal social services 
perspective.
RESULTS: Zenicor, pulse palpation, and KardiaMobile were dominant (providing 
better health outcomes at lower costs) vs. no screening; both algorithms were 
cost-effective vs. no screening, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of £1,040 and £1,166. Zenicor, pulse 
palpation, and KardiaMobile remained dominant options vs. no screening in all 
scenarios explored. Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated long-term 
stroke care costs, prevalence of undiagnosed NVAF in patients 75-79 years of 
age, and clinical efficacy of anticoagulant on stroke prevention were the main 
drivers of the cost-effectiveness results.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening for NVAF at ≥75 years of age could result in fewer 
NVAF-related strokes. NVAF screening is cost-effective and may be cost-saving 
depending on the program chosen.

OBJECTIVES: Many adults older than 65 spend time in a nursing home (NH) at the 
end of life where specialist palliative care is limited. However, telehealth may 
improve access to palliative care services. A review of the literature was 
conducted to synthesize the evidence for telehealth palliative care in NHs to 
provide recommendations for practice, research, and policy.
DESIGN: Joanna Briggs Institute guidance for scoping reviews, and Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping 
Reviews frameworks were used to guide this literature review.
SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Reviewed articles focused on residents in NHs with 
telehealth palliative care interventionists operating remotely. Participants 
included NH residents, care partner(s), and NH staff/clinicians.
METHODS: We searched Medline (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane Library 
(WileyOnline), Scopus (Elsevier), CINHAL (EBSCOhost), Trip PRO, and 
Dissertations & Theses Global (ProQuest) in June 2021, with an update in January 
2022. We included observational and qualitative studies, clinical trials, 
quality improvement projects, and case and clinical reports that self-identified 
as telehealth palliative care for NH residents.
RESULTS: The review yielded 11 eligible articles published in the United States 
and internationally from 2008 to 2020. Articles described live video as the 
preferred telehealth delivery modality with goals of care and physical aspects 
of care being most commonly addressed. Findings in the articles focused on 5 
patient and family-centered outcomes: symptom management, quality of life, 
advance care planning, health care use, and evaluation of care. Consistent 
benefits of telehealth palliative care included increased documentation of goals 
of care and decrease in acute care use. Disadvantages included technological 
difficulties and increased NH financial burden.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Although limited in scope and quality, the current 
evidence for telehealth palliative care interventions shows promise for 
improving quality and outcomes of serious illness care in NHs. Future empirical 
studies should focus on intervention effectiveness, implementation outcomes (eg, 
managing technology), stakeholders' experience, and costs.

PURPOSE: To provide estimates for regional and national burdens of blindness and 
vision loss among children and adolescents between 1990 and 2019 by disease, 
age, and sociodemographic index (SDI).
DESIGN: This was a retrospective demographic analysis based on aggregated data.
METHODS: This was a population-based study using 1990-2019 data on the burden of 
vision loss and blindness from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study (GBD) 2019. The burden of vision loss and blindness was evaluated 
in terms of case numbers, rates per 100 000 population, and average annual 
percentage changes (AAPCs) in prevalence rates and years lived with disability 
(YLDs).
RESULTS: Globally, the rates of blindness and vision loss per 100 000 population 
decreased in all age groups between 1990 and 2019, with prevalence rates 
decreasing from 1091.4 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 895.2-1326.1) to 1036.9 
(95% UI, 847.8-1265.9, AAPC, -0.2) and YLDs decreasing from 44.5 (95% UI, 
28.1-66.5) to 40.2 (95% UI, 25.1-60.7, AAPC, -0.4). Most of these reductions in 
prevalence rates (AAPC, -0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.2 to -0.1) and 
YLDs (AAPC, -0.2, 95% CI, -0.3 to -0.2) were due to decreases in refractive 
disorder. Notably, near-vision loss prevalence (AAPC, 0.3, 95% CI, 0.2-0.4) and 
YLDs (AAPC, 0.3, 95% CI, 0.2-0.4) substantially increased in all age groups. 
Children and adolescents in low- and low-middle SDI countries exhibited 
substantial decreases in the prevalence rates and YLDs of blindness and vision 
loss, but their counterparts in high- and middle-high SDI countries experienced 
a substantial increase in prevalence.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, efforts in the past 3 decades have substantially 
decreased the burdens of blindness and vision loss among children and 
adolescents. However, there is extensive variation according to the kind of 
impairment, age group, and country SDI.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a disease leading to 
spontaneous abortions and stillbirths in sows and lowered life quality and 
expectancy in growing pigs. PRRS is prevalent worldwide and has significant 
economic impacts to swine industries around the globe. Co-expression of the two 
most abundant proteins in the viral envelope, the matrix protein (M) and 
glycosylated protein 5 (GP5), can produce a neutralizing immune response for the 
virus providing a potentially effective subunit vaccine against the disease, but 
these proteins are difficult to express. The goal of this research was to 
display antigenic portions of the M and GP5 proteins on the surface of tobacco 
mosaic virus-like particles. A modified tobacco mosaic virus coat protein (TMVc) 
was transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and targeted to three 
subcellular compartments along the secretory pathway to introduce glycosylation 
patterns important for M-GP5 epitope immunogenicity. We found that accumulation 
levels in the apoplast were similar to the ER and the vacuole. Because glycans 
present on plant apoplastic proteins are closest to those present on PRRSV 
proteins, a TMVc-M-GP5 fusion construct was targeted to the apoplast and 
accumulated at over 0.5 mg/g of plant fresh weight. TMVc virus-like particles 
self-assembled in plant cells and surface-displayed the M-GP5 epitope, as 
visualized by transmission electron microscopy and immunogold localization. 
These promising findings lay the foundation for immunogenicity and 
protective-immunity studies in animals to examine the efficacy of this vaccine 
candidate as a measure to control PRRS.

The genus Nublapamea gen. nov. is described (type species: Tracheaaltivolans 
Schaus), here determined to belong to the primarily temperate Holarctic tribe 
Apameini (Noctuidae: Noctuinae). Currently known only from mid- to upper 
elevation montane forests of Costa Rica, Nublapamea is a disjunct southern 
extension of a largely northern hemisphere temperate region fauna. The life 
history of Nublapameaaltivolans is unknown; it may be associated with chusquea 
bamboo (Chusquea Kunth), as most Apameini are dietary specialists on graminoids.

Cross-Country Analysis of the Association of Cultural Dimensions with 
Prescription Opioid Consumption and Implications for Health Education.

Batova T(1), Ruediger S(1).

Author information:
(1)University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.

Background and Purpose: Over 247,000 people died in the U.S. from overdoses 
related to prescription opioids in 1999-2019, leading the WHO to deem the 
situation an epidemic. The purpose of this study is to examine whether culture 
is related to perceptions and behaviors around opioid consumption because 
culture has been shown, for example, to influence decision-making strategies, 
risk-taking, and responses to self-congruent communications. Methods: Scores for 
country-wide dimensions of culture from Hofstede and opioid consumption data 
from the International Narcotics Control Board were used to study a possible 
relationship. The relationship was tested by including a set of economic and 
socio-economic indicators from the World Bank, the United Nations, and 
PROSPERED. Results: The scores for the cultural dimension of individualism are 
correlated with opioid consumption on a country level, with higher levels of 
individualism connected to higher consumption. This correlation is robust to the 
inclusion of economic and socio-economic variables (GDP per capita, inflation, 
income inequality, unemployment, education, life expectancy, median age, and 
sick leave coverage). Conclusions and Importance: Because messages that 
reinforce a group's cultural value are more meaningful and effective in 
motivating action, educational health messages about opioid consumption in the 
U.S. need to be designed with culture in mind to disrupt decisions to take 
opioid analgesics unless medically justified or to limit their use. More 
research is needed on how to design self-congruent individualistic versus 
collectivistic persuasive appeals.

BACKGROUND: In the long-term extension study of the ERASURE and FIXTURE trials, 
the efficacy of secukinumab (a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal 
antibody) was demonstrated to have been maintained through to year 3 of 
treatment in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of secukinumab through to year 5 
of treatment in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
METHODS: Responders with ≥ 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
(PASI 75) from two core trials - ERASURE and FIXTURE - were randomized 2 : 1 at 
year 1 (end of core trials) to either the same dose (300 or 150 mg, continuous 
treatment) or placebo (treatment withdrawal) every 4 weeks, until year 3 or 
relapse (> 50% reduction in maximal PASI from core study baseline). Partial 
responders (achieving PASI 50 but not PASI 75) at year 1 continued at the same 
dose as in the core trials. At year 3, all patients received open-label 
secukinumab treatment, with those on secukinumab 300 mg continuing on their 
dose, while those on secukinumab 150 mg or placebo received secukinumab 150 or 
300 mg based on the physician's discretion. The study is registered on 
ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT01544595.
RESULTS: Most patients randomized to placebo at year 1 relapsed, but the 
response was rapidly recaptured upon reinitiation of treatment. PASI responses 
were sustained with secukinumab through to year 5. The PASI responses for the 
300 mg responders + partial responders group at year 1 (PASI 75/90/100: 
86.8%/72.8%/45.9%) trended downwards until year 3 (PASI 75/90/100: 
82.3%/58.4%/32.7%) and then remained stable through year 4 (PASI 75/90/100: 
83.3%/60.1%/32.2%) until year 5 (PASI 75/90/100: 81.1%/62.8%/35.1%). Dermatology 
Life Quality Index showed sustained benefit up to year 5. Absolute PASI 
responses were maintained throughout the study. The most common adverse events 
(AEs) were infections and infestations, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory 
tract infections (URTIs). The overall exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR; 
with 95% confidence interval) for all AEs was 139.9 (130.3-149.9). EAIRs for 
Crohn's disease and neutropenia were 0.1 (0.0-0.3) and 0.5 (0.3-0.8), 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The 4-year extension of two pivotal phase III trials demonstrated 
that secukinumab treatment was effective through to year 5 and improved quality 
of life in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The most common 
AEs were infections and infestations, nasopharyngitis, and URTIs. The safety 
profile was consistent with that in the secukinumab phase II/III clinical 
development programme.

BACKGROUND: Keratinocyte cancers (KCs) are the most common type of cancer in the 
White population worldwide, with associated high healthcare costs. Understanding 
the epidemiological trends for KCs, namely basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and 
cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), is required to assess burden of 
disease, project future trends and identify strategies for addressing this 
pressing global health issue.
OBJECTIVES: To report trends in BCC and SCC incidence, and SCC mortality and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).
METHODS: An observational study of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database 
between 1990 and 2017 was performed. European Union countries and other selected 
high-income countries, including the UK and the USA, classified as having 
high-quality mortality data, were included. Annual age-standardized incidence 
rates (ASIRs), age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) and DALYs for each country 
were obtained from the GBD database. Trends were described using joinpoint 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 33 countries were included. For both BCC and SCC in 2015-2017, 
the highest ASIRs were observed in the USA and Australia. Males had higher ASIRs 
than females at the end of the observation period in all countries for SCC, and 
in all countries but two for BCC. In contrast, the highest ASDRs for SCC were 
observed in Australia and Latvia for males, and in Romania and Croatia for 
females. The highest DALYs for SCC for both sexes were seen in Australia and 
Romania. Over the observation period, there were more countries demonstrating 
decreasing trends in mortality than in incidence, and disparities were observed 
between which countries had comparatively high mortality rates and which had 
high incidence rates. Overall reductions in SCC DALYs were observed in 24 of 33 
countries for males, and 25 countries for females.
CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 27 years, although trends in SCC incidence have risen 
in most countries, there is evidence that mortality rates have been decreasing. 
Burden of disease as assessed using DALYs has decreased in the majority of 
countries. Future work will explore potential explanatory factors for the 
observed disparity in trends in SCC incidence and mortality.

Wolfram-like syndrome (WFLS) is a recently described autosomal dominant disorder 
with phenotypic similarities to autosomal recessive Wolfram syndrome (WS), 
including optic atrophy, hearing impairment, and diabetes mellitus. We summarize 
current literature, define the clinical characteristics, and investigate 
potential genotype phenotype correlations. A systematic literature search was 
conducted in electronic databases Pubmed/MEDLINE, EMBACE, and Cochrane Library. 
We included studies reporting patients with a clinical picture consisting at 
least 2 typical clinical manifestations of WSF1 disorders and heterozygous 
mutations in WFS1. In total, 86 patients from 35 studies were included. The most 
common phenotype consisted of the combination of optic atrophy (87%) and hearing 
impairment (94%). Diabetes mellitus was seen in 44% of the patients. Nineteen 
percent developed cataract. Patients with missense mutations in WFS1 had a lower 
number of clinical manifestations, less chance of developing diabetes insipidus, 
but a younger age at onset of hearing impairment compared to patients with 
nonsense mutations or deletions causing frameshift. There were no studies 
reporting decreased life expectancy. This review shows that, within the spectrum 
of WFS1-associated disorders or "wolframinopathies," autosomal dominantly 
inherited WFLS has a relatively mild phenotype compared to autosomal recessive 
WS. The clinical manifestations and their age at onset are associated with the 
specific underlying mutations in the WFS1 gene.

OBJECTIVE: Metastasis to the pituitary gland is uncommon. With life expectancy 
after cancer diagnosis improving, we sought to understand the effects of 
treating pituitary metastasis in the modern era of advanced cancer treatment.
METHODS: Patients who had been diagnosed with, and treated for, pituitary 
metastasis from 2000 to 2021 were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 48 patients were identified, of whom 23 (48%) were women. 
The most common primary cancer was the lung (n = 23; 48%), followed by the 
breast (n = 9; 19%). Of the 48 patients, 29 (60%) had had hypopituitarism and 12 
(25%), visual field deficits. Twenty-seven patients (56%) had had solitary 
pituitary metastasis, with no evidence of other intracranial metastatic lesions. 
Of the 48 patients, 14 (29%) had undergone surgery and 20 (42%) had undergone 
standalone radiation therapy (preceded by biopsy for 3). After surgery and/or 
radiation therapy, the visual field deficits had improved in 6 patients, 
hypopituitarism had improved in 4 patients, and hypopituitarism had occurred in 
3 patients. The median overall survival (OS) was 12 months (interquartile range, 
3.0-28 months). Multivariate analysis showed nonsolitary pituitary metastasis 
(hazard ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-5.5; P = 0.0021) and no surgery 
or radiation therapy (hazard ratio, 2.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-4.15; 
P = 0.038) were associated with OS. For those with solitary pituitary 
metastasis, the patients who had undergone surgery and/or radiation therapy had 
had better 1-year OS than patients who had not received either (P = 0.03). In 
contrast, for patients with nonsolitary pituitary metastasis, those who had 
undergone standalone radiation therapy had had better 1-year OS than the 
patients who had not received either (P = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: In the selected population, metastasis-directed therapy was 
associated with improved OS. Either correct patient selection for additional 
therapy or surgery and/or radiation therapy directly benefited patients' OS.

BACKGROUND: As worldwide life expectancy increases, the Swedish Ambulance 
Service is likely to be affected by the demographic shift towards a larger 
proportion of older persons. An older population tends to increase the demand 
for ambulances, indicating a need to illuminate older patients' perspective. 
Thus, the aim of this study was to explore older patients' perceptions of the 
Swedish Ambulance Service.
METHODS: This interview study employed a descriptive qualitative design with a 
phenomenographic approach in accordance with Dahlgren and Fallsberg.
RESULTS: Three main descriptive categories emerged to describe the underlying 
conceptions in the interviews; A double-edged encounter, Trust is created by 
perceived competence, and Safety through accessibility in vulnerable situations.
CONCLUSION: Older patients described trust in ambulance clinicians as a 
prerequisite for feeling safe enough to share their feelings and allow a bodily 
examination. However, they also criticized the care provided because they 
questioned the need for certain actions.

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death and the most important impediments 
to the efforts to increase life expectancy worldwide. Currently, chemotherapy is 
the main treatment for cancer, but it is often accompanied by side effects that 
affect normal tissues and organs. The search for new alternatives to 
chemotherapy has been a hot research topic in the field of antineoplastic 
medicine. Drugs targeting diseased tissues or cells can significantly improve 
the efficacy of drugs. Therefore, organelle-targeted antitumor drugs are being 
explored, such as mitochondria-targeted antitumor drugs. Mitochondria is the 
central site of cellular energy production and plays an important role in cell 
survival and death. Moreover, a large number of studies have shown a close 
association between mitochondrial metabolism and tumorigenesis and progression, 
making mitochondria a promising new target for cancer therapy. Combining 
mitochondrial targeting agents with drug molecules is an effective way of 
mitochondrial targeting. In addition, hyperpolarized tumor cell membranes and 
mitochondrial membrane potentially allow selective accumulation of 
mitochondria-targeted drugs. This enhances the direct killing of tumor cells by 
drug molecules while minimizing the potential toxicity to normal cells. In this 
review, we discuss the common pro-mitochondrial agents, the advantages of 
triphenylphosphine (TPP) in mitochondrial-targeted cancer therapy and 
systematically summarize various TPP-based mitochondria-targeting anticancer 
drugs.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with a poor 
prognosis and significant symptom burden. This prospective observational study 
aimed to evaluate expectations and priorities of patients with advanced PDAC and 
their clinicians through a study survey and two quality of life (QoL) 
questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and PAN26) at three time-points: baseline (T1), before 
(T2) and after (T3) their 1st on-treatment CT scan. Over a 1-year period, 106 
patients were approached, 71 patients and 12 clinicians were recruited. Choosing 
between treatment options, patients prioritised: 54% overall survival (OS), 26% 
balance between side-effects and OS, 15% could not choose and 5% favoured 
symptom control. These were significantly different from the clinician's answers 
(p < 0.001). Patients who prioritised OS had higher symptom burden (p = 0.03) 
and shorter OS compared to those who prioritised balance (p = 0.01). Most (86%) 
patients had personal goals they wanted to reach; clinicians knew of these in 
12% of instances. Patient and clinicians' views regarding survival improvement 
from chemotherapy were significantly different: 81% of clinicians and 12% of 
patients thought 1-2 or 3-6 months extension, 58% of patients and 0% physicians 
thought 1-5 or >5 years (p < 0.001). At T1, patients had low QoL and worst 
symptoms were: 'Future worries', 'planning of activities', fatigue and pain. 
Patients were willing to accept significantly higher amounts of side-effects as 
a trade-off for extra time, than clinicians thought (p < 0.001). Overall, there 
are significant discrepancies between patient and clinicians' views about the 
aims, priorities and expected extension of life.

The advancement of HIV treatment has led to increased life expectancy. However, 
people living with HIV (PLWH) are at a higher risk of developing colorectal 
cancers. Chronic inflammation has a key role in oncogenesis, affecting the 
initiation, promotion, transformation, and advancement of the disease. PLWH are 
prone to opportunistic infections that trigger inflammation. It has been 
documented that 15-20% of cancers are triggered by infections, and this 
percentage is expected to be increased in HIV co-infections. The incidence of 
parasitic infections such as helminths, with Ascariasis being the most common, 
is higher in HIV-infected individuals. Cancer cells and opportunistic infections 
drive a cascade of inflammatory responses which assist in evading immune 
surveillance, making them survive longer in the affected individuals. Their 
survival leads to a chronic inflammatory state which further increases the 
probability of oncogenesis. This review discusses the key inflammatory signaling 
pathways involved in disease pathogenesis in HIV-positive patients with 
colorectal cancers. The possibility of the involvement of co-infections in the 
advancement of the disease, along with highlights on signaling mechanisms that 
can potentially be utilized as therapeutic strategies to prevent oncogenesis or 
halt cancer progression, are addressed.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy, 
accounting for approximately 1% of all cancers. Despite the initial poor 
prognosis for MM patients, their life expectancy has improved significantly with 
the development of novel agents. Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) are widely used 
in MM therapy. Their implementation has been a milestone in improving the 
clinical outcomes of patients. The first molecule belonging to the IMiDs was 
thalidomide. Subsequently, its novel derivatives, lenalidomide (LEN) and 
pomalidomide (POM), were implemented. Almost all MM patients are exposed to LEN, 
which is the most commonly used IMiD. Despite the potent anti-MM activity of 
LEN, some patients eventually relapse and become LEN-resistant. Drug resistance 
is one of the greatest challenges of modern oncology and has become the main 
cause of cancer treatment failures. The number of patients receiving LEN is 
increasing, hence the problem of LEN resistance has become a great obstacle for 
hematologists worldwide. In this review, we intended to shed more light on the 
pathophysiology of LEN resistance in MM, with particular emphasis on the 
molecular background. Moreover, we have briefly summarized strategies to 
overcome LEN resistance and we have outlined future directions.

Active packaging with CO2-emitters (pads) has recently been used for shelf-life 
extension of fresh fish. The aim of this study was to identify consumer 
attitudes towards fresh fish packaging, to examine whether Greek consumers 
prefer active packaging with pad over active packaging without pad, to 
investigate any perceived differences in the sensory freshness of the fish, and 
to relate consumer perception to volatile composition of fish fillets. In total, 
274 consumers participated in the study which included freshness sensory 
evaluation of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and seabass 
(Dicentrarchuslabrax), whole-gutted and filleted, raw and cooked, at high 
quality and at the end of high-quality shelf-life. Samples were packed under 
modified atmosphere either with a pad or without. Results showed that consumers 
preferred packages with pads, especially at the end of high quality shelf-life. 
They perceived raw samples packed with a pad to be fresher and closer to the 
ideal product, and also had a higher purchase intention towards them. Cooked 
samples were not perceived differently. Consumers' perception was in accordance 
with the GC-MS findings in the volatile compounds that function as freshness or 
spoilage indicators. Most participants were positive towards fresh fish 
packaging although they usually buy unpacked fresh fish. Our results suggest 
that active packaging with CO2 emitters contribute to freshness preservation and 
that it has a positive potential in the Greek market.

The high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) process has been studied for several 
applications in food technology and has been commercially implemented in several 
countries, mainly for non-thermal pasteurization and shelf-life extension of 
food products. HHP processing has been demonstrated to accelerate proteolytic 
hydrolysis at a specific combination of pressure and pressure-holding time for a 
given protein source and enzyme. The enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins is a 
well-known alternative to producing biologically active peptides, with 
antioxidant and antihypertensive capacity, from different food protein sources. 
However, some of these protein sources contain allergenic epitopes which are 
often not degraded by traditional hydrolysis. Moreover, the peptide profile and 
related biological activity of a hydrolysate depend on the protein source, the 
enzymes used, the parameters of the proteolysis process (pH, temperature, time 
of hydrolysis), and the use of other technologies such as HHP. The present 
review aims to provide an update on the use of HHP for improving enzymatic 
hydrolysis, with a particular focus on studies which evaluated hydrolysate 
antihypertensive and antioxidant capacity, as well as residual allergenicity. 
Overall, HHP has been shown to improve the biological properties of 
hydrolysates. While protein allergenicity can be reduced with traditional 
hydrolysis, HHP can further reduce the allergenicity. Compared with traditional 
hydrolysis methods, HHP-assisted protein hydrolysis offers a greater opportunity 
to add value to protein-rich products through conversion into high-end 
hydrolysate products with enhanced nutritional and functional properties.

Despite therapeutic advancements, stroke remains a leading cause of death and 
long-term disability. The quality of current stroke prognostic models varies 
considerably, whereas prediction models of post-stroke disability and mortality 
are restricted by the sample size, the range of clinical and risk factors and 
the clinical applicability in general. Accurate prognostication can ease 
post-stroke discharge planning and help healthcare practitioners individualize 
aggressive treatment or palliative care, based on projected life expectancy and 
clinical course. In this study, we aimed to develop an explainable machine 
learning methodology to predict functional outcomes of stroke patients at 
discharge, using the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) as a binary classification 
problem. We identified 35 parameters from the admission, the first 72 h, as well 
as the medical history of stroke patients, and used them to train the model. We 
divided the patients into two classes in two approaches: "Independent" vs. 
"Non-Independent" and "Non-Disability" vs. "Disability". Using various 
classifiers, we found that the best models in both approaches had an upward 
trend, with respect to the selected biomarkers, and achieved a maximum accuracy 
of 88.57% and 89.29%, respectively. The common features in both approaches 
included: age, hemispheric stroke localization, stroke localization based on 
blood supply, development of respiratory infection, National Institutes of 
Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) upon admission and systolic blood pressure levels 
upon admission. Intubation and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels upon admission 
are additional features for the first approach and Erythrocyte Sedimentation 
Rate (ESR) levels upon admission for the second. Our results suggest that the 
said factors may be important predictors of functional outcomes in stroke 
patients.

Poor supervision, impaired exercise adherence, and low compliance with exercise 
regimens result in inconsistent effects regarding exercise interventions. A 
supervised-walk training regimen (9 km/week) may have a positive effect on 
functional recovery in female total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study aimed to 
evaluate the effect of a supervised walking regimen on lower limb muscle 
strength, functional fitness, and patient-reported outcomes in female TKA. 
Twenty-eight female TKA were allocated into a control (CON) (n = 14) or walk 
training (WT) (n = 14) group. WT on treadmills was initiated 12 weeks after TKA. 
All patients were examined for lower muscle strength (including extension and 
flexion of hip and knee), physical function (including a 6-min walk test, 8-foot 
up-and-go test, and 30-s chair stand test), and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis 
Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire. Knee flexor (WT: CON; 64.4 ± 4.1 nm/kg: 
43.7±3.3 nm/kg; p = 0.001; effect size: 5.62) and extensor strengths (WT: CON; 
73.1 ± 7.5 nm/kg: 48.2 ± 2.4 nm/kg; p = 0.001; effect size: 4.47) statistically 
increased in the WT group compared to the CON group. The 6-min walk test (from 
341.3 ± 20.5 m to 405.5 ± 30.7 m; p = 0.001; effect size: 2.46) and 8-foot 
up-and-go test (from 9.5 ± 0.7 s to 8.3 ± 0.7 s; p = 0.002; effect size: 1.71) 
tests also showed significant improvements in the WT group in the follow-up 
compared to the baseline. An increase in quality of life score according to the 
KOOS questionnaire (WT: CON; 91.0 ± 2.8: 68.1 ± 5.8; p = 0.001; effect size: 
5.02) was noted in the WT group compared to the CON group in the follow-up. WT 
facilitated improvements in knee muscle strength and functional outcomes in TKA 
patients.
