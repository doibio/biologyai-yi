The Rotterdam Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study that started in 1990 
in the city of Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The study aims to unravel etiology, 
preclinical course, natural history and potential targets for intervention for 
chronic diseases in mid-life and late-life. The study focuses on cardiovascular, 
endocrine, hepatic, neurological, ophthalmic, psychiatric, dermatological, 
otolaryngological, locomotor, and respiratory diseases. As of 2008, 14,926 
subjects aged 45 years or over comprise the Rotterdam Study cohort. Since 2016, 
the cohort is being expanded by persons aged 40 years and over. The findings of 
the Rotterdam Study have been presented in over 1700 research articles and 
reports. This article provides an update on the rationale and design of the 
study. It also presents a summary of the major findings from the preceding 
3 years and outlines developments for the coming period.

BACKGROUND: As one of the most frequent risk factors for cardiovascular disease, 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the largest causes of death. However, 
an acute cardiac presentation is not uncommon in diabetic patients, and the 
current investigative approach remains often inadequate. The aim of our study 
was to retrospectively stratify the risk of asymptomatic T2DM patients using 
low-dose 640-slice coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CCTA examinations of 62 patients (mean age, 65 years) 
with previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and without cardiac symptoms were 
analyzed. Image acquisition was performed using a 640-slice CT. Per-patient, 
per-vessel and per-plaque analyses were performed. Stratification risk was 
evaluated according to the ESC guidelines. The patients were followed up after 
2.21 ± 0.56 years from CCTA examination.
RESULTS: Coronary artery disease (CAD) was found in 58 patients (93.55%) 
presenting 290 plaques. Analysis of all samples showed severe-to-occlusive 
atherosclerosis in 24 patients (38.7% of cases). However, over the degree of 
stenosis, 23 patients were evaluated at high risk considering the extension of 
CAD. Good agreement was shown by the correlation of CAD extension/risk 
estimation and MACE incidence, according to a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (p 
value = 0.001), with a 7.25-fold increased risk (HR 7.25 CI 2.13-24.7; p 
value = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the high capability of CCTA to properly stratify 
the CV risk of asymptomatic T2DM patients. Its use could be recommended if we 
consider how current investigative strategies to correctly assess these patients 
often seem inadequate.

OBJECTIVE: To generate an operational definition to adequately reflect the 
construct 'Minimal Disease Activity (MDA)' in psoriasis.
METHODS: A systematic review of domains included in clinical trials of psoriasis 
was presented to a panel of dermatologists and patients. Further domains were 
elicited by panel discussions. Domains (and instruments measuring these) were 
items of two consecutive Delphi rounds targeting dermatologists from the 
Psoriasis Group of the Spanish Academy of Dermatology and Venereology and 
patients from the Acción Psoriasis association. The instruments selected were 
used to generate 388 patient vignettes. The expert group then classified these 
vignettes as 'No MDA/MDA/Unclassifiable'. The items were further reduced by 
factorial analysis. Using the classification variable as gold standard, several 
operational constructions were tested in regression models and ROC curves and 
accuracy was evaluated with area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: The following domains were included: itching, scaling, erythema and 
visibility by 0-10 scales, extension by BSA, impact on quality of life by DLQI, 
special location and presence of arthritis as yes/no. The definition with the 
highest AUC and best balance between sensitivity and specificity was the one 
including no presence of arthritis plus at least three others below the upper 
limit of the 95% confidence interval (AUC, 0.897; sensitivity, 95.2%, 
specificity, 84.1%).
CONCLUSION: This study provides, for the very first time, the construct of 
'Minimal Disease Activity' in psoriasis as agreed by dermatologists and 
patients. MDA is defined as absence of active arthritis plus 3 out of 6: 
itching ≤ 1/10; scaling ≤ 2/10; redness ≤ 2/10; visibility ≤ 2/10; BSA ≤ 2; 
DLQI ≤ 2; and no lesions in special locations. By design, domains are 
representative of disease impact. This MDA definition may be used as a measure 
of adequate management and replace other subjective or restrictive tools.

Biological aging is the gradual, progressive decline in system integrity that 
occurs with advancing chronological age, causing morbidity and disability. 
Measurements of the pace of aging are needed as surrogate endpoints in trials of 
therapies designed to prevent disease by slowing biological aging. We report a 
blood-DNA-methylation measure that is sensitive to variation in pace of 
biological aging among individuals born the same year. We first modeled 
change-over-time in 18 biomarkers tracking organ-system integrity across 12 
years of follow-up in n = 954 members of the Dunedin Study born in 1972-1973. 
Rates of change in each biomarker over ages 26-38 years were composited to form 
a measure of aging-related decline, termed Pace-of-Aging. Elastic-net regression 
was used to develop a DNA-methylation predictor of Pace-of-Aging, called 
DunedinPoAm for Dunedin(P)ace(o)f(A)ging(m)ethylation. Validation analysis in 
cohort studies and the CALERIE trial provide proof-of-principle for DunedinPoAm 
as a single-time-point measure of a person's pace of biological aging.

Plain Language Summary: People’s bodies age at different rates. Age-related 
biological changes that increase the risk of disease and disability progress 
rapidly in some people. In others, these processes occur at a slower pace, 
allowing those individuals to live longer, healthier lives. This observation has 
led scientists to try to develop therapies that slow aging. The hope is that 
such treatments could prevent or delay diseases like heart disease or dementia, 
for which older age is the leading risk factor. Studies in animals have 
identified treatments that extend the creatures’ lives and slow age-related 
disease. But testing these treatments in humans is challenging. Our lives are 
much longer than the worms, flies or mice used in the experiments. Scientists 
would have to follow human study participants for decades to detect delays in 
disease onset or an extension of their lives. An alternative approach is to try 
to develop a test that measures the pace of aging, or essentially “a speedometer 
for aging”. This would allow scientists to more quickly determine if treatments 
slow the aging process. Now, Belsky et al. show a blood test designed to measure 
the pace of aging predicts which people are at increased risk of poor health, 
chronic disease and an earlier death. First, data about chemical changes to an 
individual’s DNA, called DNA methylation, were analyzed from white blood cell 
samples collected from 954 people in a long-term health study known as “The 
Dunedin Study”. Using the data, Belsky et al. then developed an algorithm – 
named “DunedinPoAm” – that identified people with an accelerated or slowed pace 
of aging based on a single blood test. Next, they used the algorithm on samples 
from participants in three other long-term studies. This verified that those 
people the algorithm identified as aging faster had a greater risk of poor 
health, developing chronic diseases or dying earlier. Similarly, those 
identified as aging more slowly performed better on tests of balance, strength, 
walking speed and mental ability, and they also looked younger to trained 
raters. Additionally, Belsky et al. used the test on participants in a 
randomized trial testing whether restricting calories had potential to extend 
healthy lifespan. The results suggested that the calorie restriction could 
counter the effects of an accelerated pace of aging. The test developed by 
Belsky et al. may provide an alternate way of measuring whether age-slowing 
treatments work. This would allow faster testing of treatments that can extend 
the healthy lifespan of humans. The test may also help identify individuals with 
accelerated aging. This might help public health officials test whether policies 
or programs can help people lead longer, healthier lives.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The present study investigated the influence of liver tumor 
structure on life expectancy in dogs. Diseases of the liver comprise 5-25% of 
all non-communicable diseases in dogs, and primary hepatic tumors account for 
0.6-1.3% of tumors. This research aimed to study the post-operative life span of 
animals with primary or metastatic tumors of the liver.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the study period, 7124 oncological operations were 
performed in our clinic. In total, 128 liver tumors were detected in live 
animals, while 323 were detected posthumously. Forty animals underwent surgery 
for various liver tumors. In dogs with primary liver tumors, the average age was 
11.9 years and the average body weight was 15.5 kg, while in dogs with liver 
metastases, the mean age was 11.4 years and the average body weight was 24 kg.
RESULTS: The ratio of males to females among dogs with primary liver tumors was 
about 1:1 (ten females and nine males), while that among dogs with metastatic 
liver damage was clearly predominantly female (14 females and two males) because 
females often undergo surgery for cancerous mammary glands or ovaries.
CONCLUSION: The size of tumors and the number of affected lobes had a 
significant effect on the post-operative life span. With a tumor size of <5 cm 
and a lesion covering less than two lobes of the liver, life expectancy was 
significantly longer and the prognosis was more favorable. In cases of large 
tumors or those affecting more than two lobes, life expectancy was significantly 
reduced and the prognosis was cautious to unfavorable.

Background  Asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI) in people living with 
HIV (PLWH) can lower quality of life, reduce drug compliance, increase 
unemployment, and reduce life expectancy. Objective  This study was aimed to 
identify risk factors of ANI in PLWH in an Indian cohort and explore the 
usefulness of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment Score (MoCA) as screening tools. Methods  PLWH under follow-up at an 
antiretroviral treatment center who were 18 to 60 years were included in this 
study. Patients were excluded if they had any cognitive symptoms, previous 
history of any central nervous system (CNS) pathology, or any systemic illness. 
Included patients were subjected to domain wise standardized neuropsychological 
battery. Six domains were screened including language, attention, speed, memory, 
sensory motor skills, and executive. Abnormal dysfunctional scores in at least 
two domains were taken as suggestive of ANI. The two groups thus created, ANI 
and normal cognition, were evaluated for differences. Variables evaluated as 
risk factors included age, sex, handedness, education, presence of at least one 
vascular risk factor, duration of disease, biochemical profile, cluster of 
differentiation 4 (CD4) count (both current and nadir) HIV viral load, and use 
of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and its CNS penetration effectiveness (CPE). 
MMSE and MoCA were also done in all patients. Statistical Analysis  Regression 
analysis was used to find out significant variables. MMSE and MoCA scores were 
correlated using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Sensitivity, specificity, 
positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were also 
determined Results  Three hundred and eighty-four patients were included out of 
which 185 (48%) had ANI. In the multivariate regression analysis, female sex 
with odds Ratio (OR) of 1.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21-2.79, p < 
0.01), education below 10 years with OR = 2.43 (95% CI: 1.56-3.80, p < 0.01) and 
presence of at least one vascular risk factor with OR = 2.52 (95% CI: 1.67-3.80, 
p < 0.01) were found to be significant. Both MMSE and MoCA had a high PPV (0.99 
and 0.97, respectively) but poor NPV (0.64 and 0.75) below a score of 25 with 
MoCA scoring slightly better. Both, MMSE and MoCA correlated well with each 
other. Conclusion  Nearly half of our patients had ANI, despite being on ART. 
Majority of patients were on ART with CPE > 7 and had relatively preserved 
immune status. Female HIV patients with at least one vascular risk factor and 
less than 10 years of formal education were found to be at risk for ANI. MMSE 
and MoCA are not good screening tools to identify this condition.

Glioblastoma (GB) is a grade IV astrocytoma that maintains a poor prognosis with 
respect to current treatment options. Despite major advancements in the fields 
of surgery and chemoradiotherapy over the last few decades, the life expectancy 
for someone with glioblastoma remains virtually unchanged and warrants a new 
approach for treatment. Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers are a type of 
nanomolecule that ranges in size (between 1 and 100 nm) and shape and can offer 
a new viable solution for the treatment of intracranial tumors, including 
glioblastoma. Their ability to deliver a variety of therapeutic cargo and 
penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB), while preserving low cytotoxicity, make 
them a favorable candidate for further investigation into the treatment of 
glioblastoma. Here, we present a systematic review of the current advancements 
in PAMAM dendrimer technology, including the wide spectrum of dendrimer 
generations formulated, surface modifications, core modifications, and 
conjugations developed thus far to enhance tumor specificity and tumor 
penetration for treatment of glioblastoma. Furthermore, we highlight the 
extensive variety of therapeutics capable of delivery by PAMAM dendrimers for 
the treatment of glioblastoma, including cytokines, peptides, drugs, siRNAs, 
miRNAs, and organic polyphenols. While there have been prolific results stemming 
from aggressive research into the field of dendrimer technology, there remains a 
nearly inexhaustible amount of questions that remain unanswered. Nevertheless, 
this technology is rapidly developing and is nearing the cusp of use for 
aggressive tumor treatment. To that end, we further highlight future prospects 
in focus as researchers continue developing more optimal vehicles for the 
delivery of therapeutic cargo.

BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetic cutaneous ulcers experience financial burden 
and a lower quality of life and life expectancy. Endothelial progenitor cell 
(EPC)-derived exosomes facilitate skin wound healing by positively modulating 
vascular endothelial cell function. Exosomes play their important regulatory 
role through microRNA (miRNA). We explored the potential role and molecular 
mechanisms of miRNA in EPC-derived exosome healing of diabetic skin wounds.
METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from the media of EPCs derived from mice bone 
marrow. High-throughput sequencing was used to detect the expression of exosome 
miRNA, and miRNA target genes were predicted using online databases. A diabetic 
mouse skin wound model was established, and wounds were treated with exosomes, 
miRNA-221-3p, or phosphate-buffered saline.
RESULTS: Exosomes from EPCs accelerated skin wound healing in both control and 
diabetic mice. High-throughput sequencing showed that miRNA-221-3p was highly 
expressed in EPC-derived exosomes. Skin wound healing in control and diabetic 
mice was significantly enhanced by EPC-derived exosomes and miRNA-221-3p 
administration. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that EPC-derived exosomes 
and miRNA-221-3p increased protein expression levels of the angiogenesis-related 
factors VEGF, CD31 and cell proliferation marker Ki67. Bioinformatics analyses 
indicated that miRNA-221-3p may be involved in the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in 
diabetic complications, cell cycle, and the p53 signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that miRNA-221-3p is one of the high-expressed miRNAs 
in EPC-derived exosomes and promoted skin wound healing in diabetic mice. The 
finding uncovers the molecular mechanism of EPC-derived exosomes and provides a 
potential novel approach to the clinical treatment of diabetic skin wounds.

flexion in children with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, allowing 
independent function for activities of daily living, such as feeding and 
self-care of the face and hair.
DESCRIPTION: The posterior aspect of the distal end of the humerus and the 
olecranon are identified by palpation and exposed via a curvilinear incision 
over the posterior aspect of the elbow. Identifying the osseous landmarks can be 
challenging in some patients. The ulnar nerve is identified and protected. The 
triceps tendon is isolated, and z-lengthening is performed. Next, the posterior 
elbow capsule is incised proximal to the tip of the olecranon to expose the 
joint surface, and the arthrotomy is continued incrementally along the medial 
and lateral capsule until elbow flexion increases by ≥40°, or past 90° (maximum, 
120°), with contact between the lengthened ends of the triceps tendon for 
repair. The triceps tendon is then repaired in the elongated position. After the 
wound is closed, the elbow is placed in flexion and immobilized in a cast.
ALTERNATIVES: Alternative treatments include passive stretching exercises to 
increase elbow flexion.
RATIONALE: Elbow extension contractures result in substantial limitations in the 
activities of daily living for children with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. 
Those who fail to attain at least 90° of elbow flexion with passive stretching 
in the first year of life benefit from posterior elbow release and triceps 
lengthening. In addition, children with <30° of passive elbow flexion are at 
risk of developing valgus instability of the elbow from passive flexion 
exercises because the axis of rotation of the elbow is difficult to detect. Once 
passive elbow flexion is attained, such children may be candidates for tendon 
transfers allowing active elbow flexion.

The obesity and the associated non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are globally 
increasing in their prevalence. While the modern-day lifestyle required less 
ventilation of metabolic energy through muscular activities, this lifestyle 
transition also provided the unlimited accession to foods around the clock, 
which prolong the daily eating period of foods that contained high calorie and 
high glycemic load. These situations promote the high continuous flux of carbon 
substrate availability in mitochondria and induce the indecisive bioenergetic 
switches. The disrupted bioenergetic milieu increases the uncoupling respiration 
due to the excess flow of the substrate-derived reducing equivalents and reduces 
ubiquinones into the respiratory chain. The diversion of the uncoupling proton 
gradient through adipocyte thermogenesis will then alleviate the damaging 
effects of free radicals to mitochondria and other organelles. The adaptive 
induction of white adipose tissues (WAT) to beige adipose tissues (beAT) has 
shown beneficial effects on glucose oxidation, ROS protection and mitochondrial 
function preservation through the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-independent 
thermogenesis of beAT. However, the maladaptive stage can eventually initiate 
with the persistent unhealthy lifestyles. Under this metabolic gridlock, the low 
oxygen and pro-inflammatory environments promote the adipose breakdown with 
sequential metabolic dysregulation, including insulin resistance, systemic 
inflammation and clinical NCDs progression. It is unlikely that a single 
intervention can reverse all these complex interactions. A comprehensive 
protocol that includes dietary, nutritional and all modifiable lifestyle 
interventions, can be the preferable choice to decelerate, stop, or reverse the 
NCDs pathophysiologic processes.

BACKGROUND: People with aphasia may improve their communication with speech and 
language therapy many months/years after stroke. However, NHS speech and 
language therapy reduces in availability over time post stroke.
OBJECTIVE: This trial evaluated the clinical effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of self-managed computerised speech and language therapy to 
provide additional therapy.
DESIGN: A pragmatic, superiority, single-blind, parallel-group, individually 
randomised (stratified block randomisation, stratified by word-finding severity 
and site) adjunct trial.
SETTING: Twenty-one UK NHS speech and language therapy departments.
PARTICIPANTS: People with post-stroke aphasia (diagnosed by a speech and 
language therapist) with long-standing (> 4 months) word-finding difficulties.
INTERVENTIONS: The groups were (1) usual care; (2) daily self-managed 
computerised word-finding therapy tailored by speech and language therapists and 
supported by volunteers/speech and language therapy assistants for 6 months plus 
usual care (computerised speech and language therapy); and (3) 
activity/attention control (completion of puzzles and receipt of telephone calls 
from a researcher for 6 months) plus usual care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Co-primary outcomes - change in ability to find treated 
words of personal relevance in a bespoke naming test (impairment) and change in 
functional communication in conversation rated on the activity scale of the 
Therapy Outcome Measures (activity) 6 months after randomisation. A key 
secondary outcome was participant-rated perception of communication and quality 
of life using the Communication Outcomes After Stroke questionnaire at 6 months. 
Outcomes were assessed by speech and language therapists using standardised 
procedures. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using treatment costs and an 
accessible EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version, measuring quality-adjusted 
life-years.
RESULTS: A total of 818 patients were assessed for eligibility and 278 
participants were randomised between October 2014 and August 2016. A total of 
240 participants (86 usual care, 83 computerised speech and language therapy, 71 
attention control) contributed to modified intention-to-treat analysis at 6 
months. The mean improvements in word-finding were 1.1% (standard deviation 
11.2%) for usual care, 16.4% (standard deviation 15.3%) for computerised speech 
and language therapy and 2.4% (standard deviation 8.8%) for attention control. 
Computerised speech and language therapy improved word-finding 16.2% more than 
usual care did (95% confidence interval 12.7% to 19.6%; p < 0.0001) and 14.4% 
more than attention control did (95% confidence interval 10.8% to 18.1%). Most 
of this effect was maintained at 12 months (n = 219); the mean differences in 
change in word-finding score were 12.7% (95% confidence interval 8.7% to 16.7%) 
higher in the computerised speech and language therapy group (n = 74) than in 
the usual-care group (n = 84) and 9.3% (95% confidence interval 4.8% to 13.7%) 
higher in the computerised speech and language therapy group than in the 
attention control group (n = 61). Computerised speech and language therapy did 
not show significant improvements on the Therapy Outcome Measures or 
Communication Outcomes After Stroke scale compared with usual care or attention 
control. Primary cost-effectiveness analysis estimated an incremental cost per 
participant of £732.73 (95% credible interval £674.23 to £798.05). The 
incremental quality-adjusted life-year gain was 0.017 for computerised speech 
and language therapy compared with usual care, but its direction was uncertain 
(95% credible interval -0.05 to 0.10), resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of £42,686 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. For 
mild and moderate word-finding difficulty subgroups, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios were £22,371 and £28,898 per quality-adjusted 
life-year gained, respectively, for computerised speech and language therapy 
compared with usual care.
LIMITATIONS: This trial excluded non-English-language speakers, the accessible 
EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version, was not validated and the measurement 
of attention control fidelity was limited.
CONCLUSIONS: Computerised speech and language therapy enabled additional 
self-managed speech and language therapy, contributing to significant 
improvement in finding personally relevant words (as specifically targeted by 
computerised speech and language therapy) long term post stroke. Gains did not 
lead to improvements in conversation or quality of life. Cost-effectiveness is 
uncertain owing to uncertainty around the quality-adjusted life-year gain, but 
computerised speech and language therapy may be more cost-effective for 
participants with mild and moderate word-finding difficulties. Exploring ways of 
helping people with aphasia to use new words in functional communication 
contexts is a priority.

FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research 
(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in 
Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 24, No. 19. See the NIHR Journals Library 
website for further project information. The Tavistock Trust for Aphasia 
provided additional support to enable people in the control groups to experience 
the intervention after the trial had ended.

Plain Language Summary: Aphasia is a communication disorder that can be caused 
by a stroke. It affects a person’s understanding of spoken words and their 
talking, reading and writing abilities. Communication may improve months, or 
years, after a stroke with speech and language therapy. Many patients want more 
speech and language therapy than the NHS can provide. The Big CACTUS (clinical 
and cost-effectiveness of aphasia computer treatment versus usual stimulation or 
attention control long term post-stroke) trial evaluated the use of speech and 
language therapy software for people with aphasia to practise finding words 
independently at home on their own computer or one loaned by the NHS. People 
with aphasia who had had a stroke at least 4 months previously were randomly 
allocated to one of three groups: usual speech and language therapy caredaily 
use of computerised speech and language therapy for 6 months, tailored by a 
speech and language therapist and supported by a volunteer or speech and 
language therapy assistantdaily completion of puzzles and supportive telephone 
calls from a researcher to mimic the activity/attention the computerised speech 
and language therapy group received. All groups received usual speech and 
language therapy. A total of 278 people with aphasia took part in this trial, 
from 21 UK NHS speech and language therapy departments. They had their strokes 
between 4 months and 36 years previously. Computerised speech and language 
therapy enabled more practice (28 hours on average) than usual speech and 
language therapy (3.8 hours). The computerised speech and language therapy group 
significantly improved their ability to say words they chose to practise 
compared with those in the usual speech and language therapy or puzzle book 
groups. Although computerised speech and language therapy can help people with 
aphasia to learn new words for years after stroke, no improvements in 
conversation or quality of life were seen. The cost-effectiveness for the NHS is 
still uncertain. However, our best estimate is that it is unlikely to be 
cost-effective for everyone with aphasia, but it may be cost-effective for 
people with mild and moderate word-finding difficulties. Next steps will focus 
on how to encourage use of new words in conversation to have an impact on 
quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Telehealth is increasingly being used in home care and could be one 
measure to support the needs of home-based patients receiving palliative care. 
However, no previous scoping review has mapped existing studies on the use of 
telehealth for patients in palliative home care.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to map and assess published studies on the 
use of telehealth for patients in palliative home care.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using the methodological framework of 
Arksey and O'Malley. Reporting was guided by Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. A systematic 
and comprehensive search of Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System 
Online, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health was 
performed for studies published between January 2000 and October 2018. Two 
authors independently assessed eligibility and extracted data.
RESULTS: The review included 22 papers from 19 studies. Four thematic groupings 
were identified among the included papers: easy and effortless use of telehealth 
regardless of the current health condition, visual features that enhance 
communication and care via telehealth, symptom management and self-management 
promotion by telehealth, and perceptions of improved palliative care at home.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of telehealth in palliative home care seems to be feasible, 
improving access to health care professionals at home and enhancing feelings of 
security and safety. The visual features of telehealth seem to allow a genuine 
relationship with health care professionals. However, there are contradicting 
results on whether the use of telehealth improves burdensome symptoms and 
quality of life. Future research should investigate the experiences of using 
telehealth among patients with life-limiting illness other than cancer and 
patients aged 85 years or older. More research is needed to increase the body of 
knowledge regarding the effectiveness of telehealth on symptoms and quality of 
life.

BACKGROUND: Late-stage medial compartment knee osteoarthritis can be treated 
using total knee replacement or partial (unicompartmental) knee replacement. 
There is high variation in treatment choice and insufficient evidence to guide 
selection.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
partial knee replacement compared with total knee replacement in patients with 
medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. The findings are intended to guide 
surgical decision-making for patients, surgeons and health-care providers.
DESIGN: This was a randomised, multicentre, pragmatic comparative effectiveness 
trial that included an expertise component. The target sample size was 500 
patients. A web-based randomisation system was used to allocate treatments.
SETTING: Twenty-seven NHS hospitals (68 surgeons).
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis.
INTERVENTIONS: The trial compared the overall management strategy of partial 
knee replacement treatment with total knee replacement treatment. No specified 
brand or subtype of implant was investigated.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Oxford Knee Score at 5 years was the primary end 
point. Secondary outcomes included activity scores, global health measures, 
transition items, patient satisfaction (Lund Score) and complications (including 
reoperation, revision and composite 'failure' - defined by minimal Oxford Knee 
Score improvement and/or reoperation). Cost-effectiveness was also assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 528 patients were randomised (partial knee replacement, 
n = 264; total knee replacement, n = 264). The follow-up primary outcome 
response rate at 5 years was 88% and both operations had good outcomes. There 
was no significant difference between groups in mean Oxford Knee Score at 5 
years (difference 1.04, 95% confidence interval -0.42 to 2.50). An area under 
the curve analysis of the Oxford Knee Score at 5 years showed benefit in favour 
of partial knee replacement over total knee replacement, but the difference was 
within the minimal clinically important difference [mean 36.6 (standard 
deviation 8.3) (n = 233), mean 35.1 (standard deviation 9.1) (n = 231), 
respectively]. Secondary outcome measures showed consistent patterns of benefit 
in the direction of partial knee replacement compared with total knee 
replacement although most differences were small and non-significant. 
Patient-reported improvement (transition) and reflection (would you have the 
operation again?) showed statistically significant superiority for partial knee 
replacement only, but both of these variables could be influenced by the lack of 
blinding. The frequency of reoperation (including revision) by treatment 
received was similar for both groups: 22 out of 245 for partial knee replacement 
and 28 out of 269 for total knee replacement patients. Revision rates at 5 years 
were 10 out of 245 for partial knee replacement and 8 out of 269 for total knee 
replacement. There were 28 'failures' of partial knee replacement and 38 
'failures' of total knee replacement (as defined by composite outcome). Beyond 1 
year, partial knee replacement was cost-effective compared with total knee 
replacement, being associated with greater health benefits (measured using 
quality-adjusted life-years) and lower health-care costs, reflecting lower costs 
of the index surgery and subsequent health-care use.
LIMITATIONS: It was not possible to blind patients in this study and there was 
some non-compliance with the allocated treatment interventions. Surgeons 
providing partial knee replacement were relatively experienced with the 
procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: Both total knee replacement and partial knee replacement are 
effective, offer similar clinical outcomes and have similar reoperation and 
complication rates. Some patient-reported measures of treatment approval were 
significantly higher for partial knee replacement than for total knee 
replacement. Partial knee replacement was more cost-effective (more effective 
and cost saving) than total knee replacement at 5 years.
FUTURE WORK: Further (10-year) follow-up is in progress to assess the 
longer-term stability of these findings.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN03013488 and 
ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01352247.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research 
(NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in

website for further project information.

Plain Language Summary: WHAT WAS THE QUESTION? Two types of knee replacement are 
available for patients with arthritis of the inner part of their knee: a partial 
knee replacement or a total knee replacement. It is not known which replacement 
offers most benefit for the patient or for the health-care system.
WHAT DID WE DO? We performed a large study involving 528 patients at 27 
hospitals with 68 experienced surgeons, in which half of the patients underwent 
partial knee replacement and the other half underwent total knee replacement. We 
took yearly scores and measures, including pain, function, whether or not the 
operation was successful, and the costs of each patient for 5 years. Comparison 
between treatments was assessed at 5 years post operation.
WHAT DID WE FIND? Good outcomes and relatively few complications were observed 
after both operations. The measurements taken to assess the clinical benefit 
were largely very similar between the two groups. Where differences did occur at 
5 years, there were only small differences between the two knee replacements and 
partial knee replacement was generally favoured. Some measurements, however, did 
show a larger difference between the two groups, including whether or not the 
operation addressed the patients’ problems and whether or not the patient would 
have the operation again. These measurements were also in favour of partial knee 
replacement, but caution is required not to overstate importance, as patients in 
the study knew which device they had had implanted. The number of patients 
requiring further operations or revision surgery was similar in the two groups. 
This last finding contrasts with information from previously obtained, mainly 
non-randomised, studies and is of high relevance. The cost of each operation in 
relation to the benefit obtained was clearly in favour of partial knee 
replacement.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? Both operations are effective for use in the NHS. There 
appear to be some modest clinical advantages for patients to undergo partial 
knee replacement over total knee replacement but, importantly, the study casts 
doubt over previous concerns on high reoperation rates for partial knee 
replacement. The study has shown that reoperation rates recorded from different 
sources (cohort or trials) can be conflicting.

The National Diabetes Stakeholders Covid-19 Response Group was formed in early 
April 2020 as a rapid action by the Joint British Diabetes Societies for 
Inpatient Care, Diabetes UK, the Association of British Clinical Diabetologists, 
and Diabetes Frail to address and support the special needs of residents with 
diabetes in UK care homes during Covid-19. It was obvious that the care home 
sector was becoming a second wave of Covid-19 infection and that those with 
diabetes residing in care homes were at increased risk not only of 
susceptibility to infection but also to poorer outcomes. Its key purposes 
included minimising the morbidity and mortality associated with Covid-19 and 
assisting care staff to identify those residents with diabetes at highest risk 
of Covid-19 infection. The guidance was particularly created for care home 
managers, other care home staff, and specialist and non-specialist community 
nursing teams. The guidance covers the management of hyperglycaemia by 
discussion of various clinical scenarios that could arise, the management of 
hypoglycaemia, foot care and end of life care. In addition, it outlines the 
conditions where hospital admission is required. The guidance should be regarded 
as interim and will be updated as further medical and scientific evidence 
becomes available.
