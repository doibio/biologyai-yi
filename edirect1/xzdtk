OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of fibrosis-based 
direct-acting antiviral treatment policies for patients with chronic hepatitis C 
virus at the Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States health system.
METHODS: We used a Markov model to compare the lifetime costs and effects of 
treating patients with chronic hepatitis C virus at different stages of disease 
severity, or all stages simultaneously, based on a fibrosis score from the US 
healthcare sector perspective and societal perspective. The initial distribution 
of patients across fibrosis scores, the effectiveness of direct-acting antiviral 
therapy, and follow-up and monitoring protocols were specific to the Kaiser 
Permanente Mid-Atlantic States health system. Direct and indirect costs, 
transition probabilities, and utilities were derived from the literature. 
Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess 
the robustness of our results.
RESULTS: The "Treat All" option was dominant from both the societal and 
healthcare sector perspectives. The conclusion was robust in deterministic 
sensitivity analysis. The range of incremental costs between the less 
restrictive policies was small-the difference between the "Treat F1+" and the 
"Treat All" option was only $111 per person. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses 
showed, at both the $100 000/quality-adjusted life-year and 
$150 000/quality-adjusted life-year thresholds, there was a 70% chance that the 
"Treat All" option was more cost-effective than the "Treat F1+" option.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that expanded treatment access is cost-effective and, in 
many cases, cost saving. Although our results are primarily applicable to a 
regional integrated healthcare system, it offers some direction to any 
healthcare setting faced with resource constraints in the face of highly priced 
drugs.

A life table is a tabulated expression of life expectancy and mortality-related 
information at specified ages in a given population. This study utilised 
VetCompass data to develop life tables for the UK companion dog population and 
broken down by sex, Kennel Club breed group, and common breeds. Among 30,563 
dogs that died between 1st January 2016 and 31st July 2020, life expectancy at 
age 0 was 11.23 [95% confidence interval (CI): 11.19-11.27] years. Female dogs 
(11.41 years; 95% CI: 11.35-11.47) had a greater life expectancy than males 
(11.07 years; 95% CI: 11.01-11.13) at age 0. Life tables varied widely between 
breeds. Jack Russell Terrier (12.72 years; 95% CI: 12.53-12.90) and French 
Bulldog (4.53 years; 95% CI: 4.14-5.01) had the longest and shortest life 
expectancy at age 0, respectively. Life tables generated by the current study 
allow a deeper understanding of the varied life trajectory across many types of 
dogs and offer novel insights and applications to improve canine health and 
welfare. The current study helps promote further understanding of life 
expectancy, which will benefit pet owners and the veterinary profession, along 
with many other sectors.

Small and large deformation tests were performed on polysaccharide-based gels 
containing konjac glucomannan, locust bean gum and κ-carrageenan. Low pH 
degradation of κ-carrageenan during heating led to lower gel strength. When 
κ-carrageenan degradation was avoided, the linear-regime rheology was dominated 
by the κ-carrageenan content, and the storage Young's modulus (E') was found to 
decrease with decreasing κ-carrageenan concentration. The large deformation 
behavior, however, was dominated by the konjac glucomannan concentration, and 
the rupture strain increased strongly with increasing konjac concentration. 
These two opposing trends led to a maximum in rupture stress in extension tests. 
No rupture was observed in compression of the gels at the polysaccharide 
concentrations tested. The compression force of konjac-rich gels was lower than 
that observed for gels without konjac at low-compression degrees, but it was 
similar to or higher at high-compression degrees, above 60-80%, indicating the 
higher degree of strain hardening of konjac-rich gels. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: 
Mixing of different polysaccharides has been used for widening the texture 
range, and it was shown in this report that the mixture of konjac glucomannan, 
locust bean gum and κ-carrageenan in the presence of sucrose and acid can 
produce jellies with various textures.

[Health promotion in psychiatry and mental health: The example of metabolic 
syndrome and nursing practices].

[Article in French]

[No authors listed]

Introduction : Life expectancy in psychiatric patients is reduced by 15 to 20 
years due to the presence of comorbidities and the lifestyle of these patients. 
Metabolic syndrome, also a side effect of antipsychotic drugs, is an aggravating 
factor of this phenomenon, which is why health promotion is essential. The 
objective of this study is to describe the knowledge, attitudes, and practices 
of psychiatric nurses with regard to metabolic syndrome, using N. Pender's 
health promotion model as a framework.Methodology : A multicenter descriptive 
study using a « knowledge, attitude, practice » survey was conducted in 16 
psychiatric departments in the Ile-de-France region. 70 nurses were interviewed 
via online questionnaires.Results : The results show partial knowledge. A gap 
exists between attitudes and nursing practices. The nurses' actions mainly 
involve counseling. The type of nursing knowledge is discussed, as well as the 
need for reflection on the nurse-patient relationship. Nursing interventions 
need to be further developed to better manage metabolic syndrome.Conclusion : 
Training is needed to carry out preventive measures and promote health more 
effectively.

Currently, life expectancy is increasing every year, and with it the diseases 
that are characteristic of the elderly. Dementia is one such condition. 
According to statistics, there are 9 people with dementia per 100 healthy people 
aged 60 and over. However, it is important to understand that dementia can also 
be viewed in a historical context. Over time, ideas about this condition, 
approaches to its management, as well as the attitude of society towards 
patients with dementia have changed. The article describes the history of the 
study of dementia, which went along with the development of medicine, anatomy, 
neurology and psychiatry. In different historical periods, people's 
understanding of the mechanisms of development, etiology and pathogenesis of 
this condition has changed. Ethics and deontology gradually developed, which 
undoubtedly played an important role in improving the life of not only patients 
with dementia, but also the relationship between the doctor and the patient as a 
whole. The main stages in the study of dementia have become the basis for the 
modern understanding of this condition.

Publisher: В настоящее время продолжительность жизни увеличивается с каждым 
годом, но вместе с ней растет и число заболеваний, характерных для пожилых 
людей. Деменция — одно из таких состояний. Согласно статистическим данным, на 
100 здоровых человек в возрасте 60 лет и старше приходятся 9 лиц, имеющих 
деменцию разной степени тяжести. Вопросы деменции можно рассматривать и в 
историческом контексте. С течением времени менялись представления об этом 
состоянии, подходы к его лечению, а также отношение общества к больным 
деменцией. В статье описывается история изучения деменции, которая шла 
параллельно с развитием анатомии, неврологии и психиатрии. В разных исторических 
промежутках менялось понимание механизмов развития, этиологии и патогенеза 
данного состояния. Постепенно развивались этика и деонтология, что несомненно 
сыграло важную роль не только для улучшения жизни пациентов с деменцией, но и 
отношений врача и пациента. Основные этапы изучения деменции стали основой для 
современного представления о данном состоянии.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: There is a substantial gap in life expectancy between 
patients with severe mental illness (SMI) and the general population and it is 
important to understand which factors contribute to this difference. Research 
suggests an association between tardive dyskinesia (TD) and mortality; however, 
results are inconclusive. In addition, studies investigating associations 
between parkinsonism or akathisia and mortality are rare. We hypothesized that 
TD would be a risk factor for mortality in patients with SMI.
STUDY DESIGN: We studied a cohort of 157 patients diagnosed predominantly with 
schizophrenia on the former Netherlands Antilles. TD, parkinsonism, and 
akathisia were assessed with rating scales on eight occasions over a period of 
18 years. Twenty-four years after baseline, survival status and if applicable 
date of death were determined. Associations between movement disorders and 
survival were analyzed using Cox regression. Sex, age, antipsychotics, 
antidepressants and benzodiazepines at each measurement occasion were tested as 
covariates.
STUDY RESULTS: Parkinsonism was a significant risk factor with an HR of 1.02 per 
point on the motor subscale of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale 
(range 0-56). TD and akathisia were not significantly associated with mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Parkinsonism may be an important risk factor for mortality in SMI 
patients. This finding calls for more follow-up and intervention studies to 
confirm this finding and to explore whether treatment or prevention of 
parkinsonism can reduce excess mortality.

In this article, we discuss the strategy designed by a private oncology group to 
offer patients access to new technologies and treatments via a recently created 
research program, and we describe how the patient journey was the motivation for 
developing standard assistance flows and processes to integrate areas of care. 
The increase in Brazilians' life expectancy has raised the incidence of cancer, 
and it is now the second leading cause of death. Because it is a multifactorial 
disease, cancer treatment has several challenges. We elected to approach cancer 
research using a strategic program to obtain national attention and visibility. 
Starting in 2007, the initial project included three phases: phase I, diagnosis 
of units in major metropolitan areas; phase II, project design, with a 
central-office operation model; and phase III, implementation, with launch and 
integration of research activities at selected units. The foundation of the 
program was the construction of departmental and interdepartmental flows, 
standard operating processes, and guidelines (regulatory, ethical, legal, and 
financial). Recruitment of qualified professionals was another critical, 
successful determinant. The benefits of an additional central office include 
improved research-project distribution. Another advantage of the program is 
attracting and retaining trained professionals with alternative direct or 
indirect sources of revenue. We increased our corporate and academic 
partnerships, adhered to deadlines and noted an improvement in turnaround times, 
and we increased clinical staff engagement and motivation. Some barriers 
continue to challenge the program's continued expansion, including Brazilian 
regulatory authority approval, tax inefficiency, and a growing demand for 
qualified professionals. Research sites offering high-quality care are a reality 
in Brazil; they offer multiple lines of treatment in the public and private 
sectors.

Amino Acid Availability Is Not Essential for Life-Span Extension by Dietary 
Restriction in the Fly.

Gautrey SL(1), Simons MJP(1).

Author information:
(1)School of Biosciences, University of Sheffield, Western Bank, Sheffield, UK.

Dietary restriction (DR) is one of the most potent ways to extend health and 
life span. Key progress in understanding the mechanisms of DR, and aging more 
generally, was made when dietary protein, and more specifically essential amino 
acids (EAA), were identified as the dietary component to restrict to obtain DR's 
health and life-span benefits. This role of dietary amino acids has influenced 
work on aging mechanisms, especially in nutrient sensing, for example, Target of 
Rapamycin and insulin(-like) signaling networks. Experimental biology in 
Drosophila melanogaster has been instrumental in generating and confirming the 
hypothesis that EAA availability is important in aging. Here, we expand on 
previous work testing the involvement of EAA in DR through large-scale (N = 6 
238) supplementation experiments across 4 diets and 2 genotypes in female flies. 
Surprisingly, we find that EAA are not essential to DR's life-span benefits. 
Importantly, we do identify the fecundity benefits of EAA supplementation 
suggesting the supplemented EAA were bioavailable. Furthermore, we find that the 
effects of amino acids on life span vary by diet and genetic line studied and 
that at our most restricted diet fecundity is constrained by other nutrients 
than EAA. We suggest that DR for optimal health is a concert of nutritional 
effects, orchestrated by genetic, dietary, and other environmental interactions. 
Our results question the universal importance of amino acid availability in the 
biology of aging and DR.

BACKGROUND: Dementia and frailty often accompany one another in older age, 
requiring complex care and resources. Available projections provide little 
information on their joint impact on future health-care need from different 
segments of society and the associated costs. Using a newly developed 
microsimulation model, we forecast this situation in Japan as its population 
ages and decreases in size.
METHODS: In this microsimulation modelling study, we built a model that 
simulates an individual's status transition across 11 chronic diseases 
(including diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke) as well as depression, 
functional status, and self-reported health, by age, sex, and educational strata 
(less than high school, high school, and college and higher), on the basis of 
nationally representative health surveys and existing cohort studies. Using the 
simulation results, we projected the prevalence of dementia and frailty, life 
expectancy with these conditions, and the economic cost for formal and informal 
care over the period 2016-43 in the population of Japan aged 60 years and older.
FINDINGS: Between 2016 and 2043, life expectancy at age 65 years will increase 
from 23·7 years to 24·9 years in women and from 18·7 years to 19·9 years in men. 
Years spent with dementia will decrease from 4·7 to 3·9 years in women and 2·2 
to 1·4 years in men. By contrast, years spent with frailty will increase from 
3·7 to 4·0 years for women and 1·9 to 2·1 for men, and across all educational 
groups. By 2043, approximately 29% of women aged 75 years and older with a less 
than high school education are estimated to have both dementia and frailty, and 
so will require complex care. The expected need for health care and formal 
long-term care is anticipated to reach costs of US$125 billion for dementia and 
$97 billion for frailty per annum in 2043 for the country.
INTERPRETATION: Japan's Government and policy makers should consider the 
potential social challenges in caring for a sizable population of older people 
with frailty and dementia, and a widening disparity in the burden of those 
conditions by sex and by educational status. The future burden of dementia and 
frailty should be countered not only by curative and preventive technology 
innovation, but also by social policies to mitigate the health gap.

AIMS: This report from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Atlas Project 
updates and expands upon the widely cited 2019 report in presenting 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) statistics for the 57 ESC member countries.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Statistics pertaining to 2019, or the latest available 
year, are presented. Data sources include the World Health Organization, the 
Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the World Bank, and novel ESC 
sponsored data on human and capital infrastructure and cardiovascular healthcare 
delivery. New material in this report includes sociodemographic and 
environmental determinants of CVD, rheumatic heart disease, out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest, leftsided valvular heart disease, the advocacy potential of 
these CVD statistics, and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) 2025 
targets for non-communicable diseases. Salient observations in this report: (i) 
Females born in ESC member countries in 2018 are expected to live 80.8 years and 
males 74.8 years. Life expectancy is longer in high income (81.6 years) compared 
with middle-income (74.2 years) countries. (ii) In 2018, high-income countries 
spent, on average, four times more on healthcare than middle-income countries. 
(iii) The median PM2.5 concentrations in 2019 were over twice as high in 
middle-income ESC member countries compared with high-income countries and 
exceeded the EU air quality standard in 14 countries, all middle-income. (iv) In 
2016, more than one in five adults across the ESC member countries were obese 
with similar prevalence in high and low-income countries. The prevalence of 
obesity has more than doubled over the past 35 years. (v) The burden of CVD 
falls hardest on middle-income ESC member countries where estimated incidence 
rates are ∼30% higher compared with high-income countries. This is reflected in 
disability-adjusted life years due to CVD which are nearly four times as high in 
middle-income compared with high-income countries. (vi) The incidence of 
calcific aortic valve disease has increased seven-fold during the last 30 years, 
with age-standardized rates four times as high in high-income compared with 
middle-income countries. (vii) Although the total number of CVD deaths across 
all countries far exceeds the number of cancer deaths for both sexes, there are 
15 ESC member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in 
males and five-member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than 
CVD in females. (viii) The under-resourced status of middle-income countries is 
associated with a severe procedural deficit compared with high-income countries 
in terms of coronary intervention, ablation procedures, device implantation, and 
cardiac surgical procedures.
CONCLUSION: Risk factors and unhealthy behaviours are potentially reversible, 
and this provides a huge opportunity to address the health inequalities across 
ESC member countries that are highlighted in this report. It seems clear, 
however, that efforts to seize this opportunity are falling short and present 
evidence suggests that most of the WHO NCD targets for 2025 are unlikely to be 
met across ESC member countries.

Acute Limb Ischemia in Cogan Syndrome.

Mohseni MM(1).

BACKGROUND Cogan syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder associated most 
frequently with ocular, vestibular, and auditory involvement from presumed small 
vessel vasculitis. Cogan syndrome, in a significant proportion of patients, can 
progress to systemic symptoms, including gastrointestinal, neurologic, and 
musculoskeletal manifestations. Large-vessel involvement has also been described 
in some cases (eg, aortitis), but acute limb ischemia in the setting of this 
illness has been infrequently reported. CASE REPORT We present a rare case of 
Cogan syndrome complicated by acute vascular ischemia of the left upper 
extremity. A 50-year-old man presented with symptoms of severe acute pain and 
weakness of the left arm. The patient endorsed a diagnosis of Cogan syndrome 4 
years prior in the setting of unilateral left-sided hearing loss and bilateral 
uveitis. A physical examination revealed pallor of the left forearm and 
pulselessness at the wrist. Computed tomography angiography was suggestive of 
vasculitis and concerns for embolic occlusion of several arterial structures of 
the left upper limb. After consultation with various specialists, the patient 
was treated with high-dose steroids, anticoagulants, and topical nitroglycerin 
and experienced significant clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of Cogan 
syndrome with severe systemic manifestations depends on the organ involvement 
and degree of extension. Our patient's presentation serves as an impressive 
example of systemic vasculitis with subsequent acute ischemia in the setting of 
this rare autoimmune disorder. In such a case, given the potential for life- or 
limb-threatening systemic vascular catastrophes, emergent interventions 
(including imaging, anticoagulation, and specialist involvement) are required to 
prevent untoward outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Noninvoluting congenital hemangiomas (NICH) are rare and poorly 
understood vascular tumors that are present at birth, characterized by lack of 
growth after birth and lack of involution. We report uncharacteristic cases of 
NICH hypertrophy occurring later in life.
METHODS: This is a case series describing the clinical presentation, management, 
and histologic characteristics of two cases of NICH hypertrophy.
RESULTS: Two patients with a NICH of the scalp experienced lesion hypertrophy in 
teenage or early adult life. Case 1 is a 14-year-old female who presented with a 
flat left parietal scalp lesion that at first grew slowly with the patient; 
however, over the span of months grew substantially resulting in an exophytic 
lesion. The patient had the lesion surgically excised. Case 2 is a 26-year-old 
female with NICH of left occipital scalp and posterior neck who noted new 
nodules on the inferior border of the lesion. MRA/MRI showed extension into the 
occipital calvarium, level V of the neck, and paraspinal musculature. The 
patient elected to observe given the extent of the lesion and her minimal 
symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Although postnatal growth of NICH have been described, cases usually 
occur during the pre-adolescent period where growth is usually proportional to 
overall growth of the patient. This study describes two cases of rapid onset 
NICH hypertrophy occurring later in life. Knowledge of the potential for delayed 
hypertrophy may lead families to seek earlier intervention or opt for more 
definitive interventions. Additionally, recognition of these variable 
distinctions will contribute to a better understanding of CH and its various 
subtypes.

OBJECTIVES: To examine pathological evidence present in a sample of 19th 
-century settlers to South Australia in the context of an early industrial 
society.
MATERIALS: Skeletal remains of 20 adults and 45 nonadults from the government 
funded burial site (free ground) of St Mary's Anglican Church Cemetery, 
gravestones of privately funded burials and local parish records.
METHODS: Investigation of pathological manifestations of skeletal remains, 
church records and historic literature. Comparison with similar samples from 
Britain and from New South Wales.
RESULTS: Joint disease seen in 35% of adults. Porosity in bone cortices 
indicative of vitamin C deficiency seen in 32% of the total sample and porous 
lesions in the orbit (cribra orbitalia) in 7% of nonadults. Traumatic fractures 
identified in two adult males. Gastrointestinal conditions were the leading 
cause of death for nonadults, most adults died of pulmonary conditions. Life 
expectancy of people buried at the expense of the government was 23.8-42.6 
years, those in private burials 57.1 years.
CONCLUSION: Health of migrant settlers from the St Mary's free ground did not 
differ much from that of a similar population in Britain nor of settlers in New 
South Wales. Thus, it is characteristic for lower socioeconomic groups in early 
industrialised societies.
SIGNIFICANCE: St Mary's sample is a rarity due scarcity of similar Australian 
skeletal samples.
LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and lack of similar samples for comparison.
SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: Comprehensive investigation of dentitions in 
St Mary's sample and studies of more skeletal samples of early settlers in other 
Australian locations.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC), bacterial infections are one of the greatest threats to 
global health, food production, and life expectancy. In this sense, the 
development of innovative formulations aiming at greater therapeutic efficacy, 
safety, and shorter treatment duration compared to conventional products is 
urgently needed. Lipid-based nanocarriers (LBNs) have demonstrated the potential 
to enhance the effectiveness of available antibiotics. Among them, liposome, 
nanoemulsion, solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN), and nanostructured lipid carrier 
(NLC) are the most promising due to their solid technical background for 
laboratory and industrial production. This review describes recent advances in 
developing antibiotic-loaded LBNs against susceptible and resistant bacterial 
strains and biofilm. LBNs revealed to be a promising alternative to deliver 
antibiotics due to their superior characteristics compared to conventional 
preparations, including their modified drug release, improved bioavailability, 
drug protection against chemical or enzymatic degradation, greater drug loading 
capacity, and biocompatibility. Antibiotic-loaded LBNs can improve current 
clinical drug therapy, bring innovative products and rescue discarded 
antibiotics. Thus, antibiotic-loaded LBNs have potential to open a window of 
opportunities to continue saving millions of lives and prevent the devastating 
impact of bacterial infection.

OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates time-sensitive policy and 
implementation decisions regarding new therapies in the face of uncertainty. 
This study aimed to quantify consequences of approving therapies or pursuing 
further research: immediate approval, use only in research, approval with 
research (eg, emergency use authorization), or reject.
METHODS: Using a cohort state-transition model for hospitalized patients with 
COVID-19, we estimated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs associated 
with the following interventions: hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, 
casirivimab-imdevimab, dexamethasone, baricitinib-remdesivir, tocilizumab, 
lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon beta-1a, and usual care. We used the model 
outcomes to conduct cost-effectiveness and value of information analyses from a 
US healthcare perspective and a lifetime horizon.
RESULTS: Assuming a $100 000-per-QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, only 
remdesivir, casirivimab-imdevimab, dexamethasone, baricitinib-remdesivir, and 
tocilizumab were (cost-) effective (incremental net health benefit 0.252, 0.164, 
0.545, 0.668, and 0.524 QALYs and incremental net monetary benefit $25 249, $16 
375, $54 526, $66 826, and $52 378). Our value of information analyses suggest 
that most value can be obtained if these 5 therapies are approved for immediate 
use rather than requiring additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (net 
value $20.6 billion, $13.4 billion, $7.4 billion, $54.6 billion, and $7.1 
billion), hydroxychloroquine (net value $198 million) is only used in further 
RCTs if seeking to demonstrate decremental cost-effectiveness and otherwise 
rejected, and interferon beta-1a and lopinavir-ritonavir are rejected (ie, 
neither approved nor additional RCTs).
CONCLUSIONS: Estimating the real-time value of collecting additional evidence 
during the pandemic can inform policy makers and clinicians about the optimal 
moment to implement therapies and whether to perform further research.

A retrospective observational study on cases of anaplastic brain tumors treated 
with the Di Bella Method: A rationale and effectiveness.

Despite all the new developments in cancer therapy, the life expectancy of 
patients with malignant anaplastic brain tumors and glioblastoma multiform (GBM) 
remains short. Since the establishment of the Di Bella Method (DBM) in cancer 
therapy, DBM was able to increase the survival rate and life quality, without 
overt toxicity, in comparison to what is described in the literature related to 
the analogous brain tumors, with the same immunohistochemical, histologic and 
clinical features. Therefore, we treated seven patients with malignant 
anaplastic brain tumors using the DBM protocol. DBM therapy consists of 
somatostatin and analogous (octreotide) all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), 
β-Carotene, axerophthol dissolved in vitamin E, vitamin D, vitamin C, melatonin 
(MLT), proteoglycans-glycosaminoglycans, valproic acid, acetazolamide, 
diethyldithiocarbamate, hydroxyurea, and temozolomide. These molecules have 
either antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, cytostatic, antioxidant, 
antimetastatic (differentiative), and immunomodulating features. Moreover, the 
inclusion of ATRA, MLT, and glucosamine with sodium valproate, 
diethyldithiocarbamate and acetazolamide has reinforced antitumor properties of 
the therapy by extending them to cancer stem cells. Furthermore, the 
non-cytolytic and non-cytotoxic metronomic dosage of hydroxyurea and 
temozolomide had increased the DBM therapy outcome by strengthening anti-tumor 
capability. The results of such treatment revealed that all seven patients were 
still alive after 5 to 8 years of starting DBM. In conclusion, the 
multi-strategic objectives of DBM are inhibiting the proliferative-invasiveness 
and neoplastic angiogenesis, silencing the survival system of cancer stem cells, 
enhancing the immunomodulatory and antioxidant activities, improving vitality 
and efficiency of normal cells, and depressing the efficiency and vitality 
of neoplastic ones.

OBJETIVES: The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a 13-week COVID-19 
lockdown on health-related parameters in women aged 60-70 years.
STUDY DESIGN: Thirty women participated in this longitudinal study. All the 
assessments were performed before and 13 weeks after the initial phase of the 
COVID-19 pandemic in Spain (March to June 2020).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A sociodemographic questionnaire was provided, and tests 
were performed to assess muscle strength, anthropometric measurements, 
densitometry, blood pressure, blood parameters, Mediterranean diet adherence, 
and physical activity levels.
RESULTS: After the lockdown, both healthy and unhealthy lifestyle groups showed 
a significant worsening of HDL, cholesterol/HDL lipids, and isometric knee 
extension strength parameters. However, individuals with an unhealthy lifestyle 
also showed a significant worsening in LDL lipids, Non-HDL lipids, bone mineral 
density of the femoral neck, fat mass/height (%), truncal fat mass (absolute and 
percentage), total fat mass (absolute and percentage) and handgrip strength.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the overall health 
status of Spanish older women, potentially increasing their susceptibility to 
comorbidities, such as lipid cholesterol, body fat, and decreased muscle 
strength.

PURPOSE: To assess the cost effectiveness of microwave ablation (MWA) and 
stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for patients with inoperable stage I 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE with broad 
search clusters. A decision-analytic model was constructed over a 5-year period. 
The model incorporated treatment-related complications and long-term recurrence. 
All clinical parameters were derived from the literature with preference to 
long-term prospective trials. A healthcare payers' perspective was adopted. 
Outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) extracted from 
prior studies and U.S. dollars from Medicare reimbursements and prior studies. 
Base case calculations, probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10,000 Monte 
Carlo simulations, and multiple 1- and 2-way sensitivity analyses were 
performed.
RESULTS: MWA yielded a health benefit of 2.31 QALYs at a cost of $195,331, 
whereas SBRT yielded a health benefit of 2.33 QALYs at a cost of $225,271. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $1,480,597/QALY, indicating that MWA is 
the more cost-effective strategy. The conclusion remains unchanged in 
probabilistic sensitivity analysis with MWA being the optimal cost strategy in 
99.84% simulations. One-way sensitivity analyses revealed that MWA remains cost 
effective when its annual recurrence risk is <18.4% averaged over 5 years, when 
the SBRT annual recurrence risk is >1.44% averaged over 5 years, or when MWA is 
at least $7,500 cheaper than SBRT.
CONCLUSIONS: MWA appears to be more cost effective than SBRT for patients with 
inoperable stage I NSCLC.
