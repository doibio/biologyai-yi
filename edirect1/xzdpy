collectors were not blinded; however, the staff who processed the accelerometer 
data were blinded to allocation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was accelerometer-measured ambulatory 
activity (steps per day) at 48 months. Other objective and self-reported 
measures of physical activity were also assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 1366 individuals were randomised (median age 61 years, 
median body mass index 28.4 kg/m2, median ambulatory activity 6638 steps per 
day, women 49%, black and minority ethnicity 28%). Accelerometer data were 
available for 1017 (74%) and 993 (73%) individuals at 12 and 48 months, 
respectively. The primary outcome assessment at 48 months found no differences 
in ambulatory activity compared with control in either group (Walking Away Plus: 
121 steps per day, 97.5% confidence interval -290 to 532 steps per day; Walking 
Away: 91 steps per day, 97.5% confidence interval -282 to 463). This was 
consistent across ethnic groups. At the intermediate 12-month assessment, the 
Walking Away Plus group had increased their ambulatory activity by 547 (97.5% 
confidence interval 211 to 882) steps per day compared with control and were 
1.61 (97.5% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.45) times more likely to achieve 150 
minutes per week of objectively assessed unbouted moderate to vigorous physical 
activity. In the Walking Away group, there were no differences compared with 
control at 12 months. Secondary anthropometric, biomechanical and mental health 
outcomes were unaltered in either intervention study arm compared with control 
at 12 or 48 months, with the exception of small, but sustained, reductions in 
body weight in the Walking Away study arm (≈ 1 kg) at the 12- and 48-month 
follow-ups. Lifetime cost-effectiveness modelling suggested that usual care had 
the highest probability of being cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000 per 
quality-adjusted life-year. Of 50 serious adverse events, only one (myocardial 
infarction) was deemed possibly related to the intervention and led to the 
withdrawal of the participant from the study.
LIMITATIONS: Loss to follow-up, although the results were unaltered when missing 
data were replaced using multiple imputation.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining a physical activity intervention with text messaging and 
telephone support resulted in modest, but clinically meaningful, changes in 
physical activity at 12 months, but the changes were not sustained at 48 months.
FUTURE WORK: Future research is needed to investigate which intervention types, 
components and features can help to maintain physical activity behaviour change 
over the longer term.

Plain Language Summary: When someone has type 2 diabetes, it means that their 
body no longer does a good job of controlling the sugar in their blood. This 
gives them a higher risk of other health problems. Fortunately, people can avoid 
getting type 2 diabetes if they can change their lifestyle. We wanted to know 
whether or not an education programme could help people at high risk of getting 
diabetes to become more physically active and, if so, whether or not they were 
still more active and healthier 4 years later. We also wanted to know whether it 
made a difference if we used text messages and telephone calls to support them 
and whether it worked better for some ethnic groups than others. We put 1366 
people into one of three groups at random. The first group received an advice 
leaflet. The second group attended (in groups of up to 10 participants) a 3-hour 
education programme called ‘Walking Away from Type 2 Diabetes’ to help them to 
change their behaviour and then attended a group-based refresher session every 
year. The third group received the same education programme and the refresher 
sessions, but also received text messages and telephone calls to give them extra 
support. We measured how active the participants were at the start of the study, 
after 1 year and again 3 years after that (i.e. 4 years after the start). Then 
we looked at whether or not the Walking Away programme, with and without the 
extra support of text messages and telephone calls, did a better job of 
encouraging people to be more active than just giving them the advice leaflet. 
We found out that the Walking Away programme, when combined with text messages 
and telephone calls for support, did help participants to take over 500 more 
steps per day during the first year; however, when we checked again at 4 years, 
we found that the effects had worn off. Neither option proved to be good value 
for money.

BACKGROUND: Never smokers in Asia have a higher incidence of lung cancer than in 
Europe and North America. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of lung 
cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for never smokers in 
Japan and the United States.
METHODS: We developed a state-transition model for three strategies: LDCT, chest 
X-ray (CXR), and no screening, using a healthcare payer perspective over a 
lifetime horizon. Sensitivity analyses were also performed. Main outcomes were 
costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life expectancy life-years (LYs), 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and deaths from lung cancer. The 
willingness-to-pay level was US$100,000 per QALY gained.
RESULTS: LDCT yielded the greatest benefits with the lowest cost in Japan, but 
the ICERs of LDCT compared with CXR were US$3,001,304 per QALY gained for 
American men and US$2,097,969 per QALY gained for American women. 
Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to the incidence of lung cancer. Probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses demonstrated that LDCT was cost-effective 99.3-99.7% for 
Japanese, no screening was cost-effective 77.7% for American men, and CXR was 
cost-effective 93.2% for American women. Compared with CXR, LDCT has the 
cumulative lifetime potential for 60-year-old Japanese to save US$117 billion, 
increase 2,339,349 QALYs and 3,020,102 LYs, and reduce 224,749 deaths, and the 
potential for 60-year-old Americans to cost US$120 billion, increase 48,651 
QALYs and 67,988 LYs, and reduce 2,309 deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: This modelling study suggests that LDCT screening for never smokers 
has the greatest benefits and cost savings in Japan, but is not cost-effective 
in the United States. Assessing the risk of lung cancer in never smokers is 
important for introducing population-based LDCT screening.

BACKGROUND: Type II germ cell tumors (GCT) are the most common solid cancers in 
males of age 15 to 35 years. Treatment of these tumors includes cisplatin-based 
therapy achieving high cure rates, but also leading to late toxicities. As 
mainly young men are suffering from GCTs, late toxicities play a major role 
regarding life expectancy, and the development of therapy resistance emphasizes 
the need for alternative therapeutic options. GCTs are highly susceptible to 
interference with the epigenetic landscape; therefore, this study focuses on 
screening of drugs against epigenetic factors as a treatment option for GCTs.
RESULTS: We present seven different epigenetic inhibitors efficiently decreasing 
cell viability in GCT cell lines including cisplatin-resistant subclones at low 
concentrations by targeting epigenetic modifiers and interactors, like histone 
deacetylases (Quisinostat), histone demethylases (JIB-04), histone 
methyltransferases (Chaetocin), epigenetic readers (MZ-1, LP99) and 
polycomb-repressive complexes (PRT4165, GSK343). Mass spectrometry-based 
analyses of the histone modification landscape revealed effects beyond the 
expected mode-of-action of each drug, suggesting a wider spectrum of 
activity than initially assumed. Moreover, we characterized the effects of each 
drug on the transcriptome of GCT cells by RNA sequencing and found common 
deregulations in gene expression of ion transporters and DNA-binding factors. A 
kinase array revealed deregulations of signaling pathways, like cAMP, JAK-STAT 
and WNT.
CONCLUSION: Our study identified seven drugs against epigenetic modifiers to 
treat cisplatin-resistant GCTs. Further, we extensively analyzed off-target 
effects and modes-of-action, which are important for risk assessment of the 
individual drugs.

BACKGROUND: Education attainment can improve life expectancy and guide healthy 
behaviours throughout an entire lifetime. A nationwide longitudinal study of the 
association of education status with the risk of hypertension and its control in 
China is lacking.
METHODS: The China Cardiometabolic Disease and Cancer Cohort Study is a 
multicentre, population-based, prospective cohort study. We performed the 
baseline survey from 2011 to 2012. A follow-up visit was conducted during 
2014-2016. 101 959 subjects were included in the final data analyses. Cox 
proportional hazards regression was used to examine the associations of 
education levels with the risk of hypertension and uncontrolled hypertension.
RESULTS: During follow-up, 11 189 (19.9%) participants had developed 
hypertension among subjects without hypertension at baseline. Among the 
participants with hypertension at baseline, only 40.6% had controlled 
hypertension. Compared with the participants' education level at elementary 
school and below, the multivariable-adjusted HR for incident hypertension was 
0.76 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.80) in those with a middle school education level and 
0.67 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.70) in those with a high school degree or above. 
Correspondingly, multivariable-adjusted HRs associated with uncontrolled 
hypertension were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87 to 0.92) in participants with a middle 
school education level and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.88) in participants with a 
high school degree or above level.
CONCLUSION: Participants with education attainment at elementary school and 
below exhibited excess risks of newly diagnosed hypertension and worse blood 
pressure control compared with individuals with education attainment at middle 
school or above.

OBJECTIVES: Chromosome 3-linked frontotemporal dementia (FTD-3) is caused by a 
c.532-1G > C mutation in the CHMP2B gene. It is extensively studied in a Danish 
family comprising one of the largest families with an autosomal dominantly 
inherited frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This retrospective cohort study 
utilizes demographics to identify risk factors for onset, progression, life 
expectancy, and death in CHMP2B-mediated FTD. The pedigree of 528 individuals in 
six generations is provided, and clinical descriptions are presented. Choices of 
genetic testing are evaluated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic and lifestyle factors were assessed in 
survival analysis in all identified CHMP2B mutation carriers (44 clinically 
affected FTD-3 patients and 16 presymptomatic CHMP2B mutation carriers). 
Predictors of onset and progression included sex, parental disease course, 
education, and vascular risk factors. Life expectancy was established by 
matching CHMP2B mutation carriers with average life expectancies in Denmark.
RESULTS: Disease course was not correlated to parental disease course and seemed 
unmodified by lifestyle factors. Diagnosis was recognized at an earlier age in 
members with higher levels of education, probably reflecting an early 
dysexecutive syndrome, unmasked earlier in people with higher work-related 
requirements. Carriers of the CHMP2B mutation had a significant reduction in 
life expectancy of 13 years. Predictive genetic testing was chosen by 20% of 
at-risk family members.
CONCLUSIONS: CHMP2B-mediated FTD is substantiated as an autosomal dominantly 
inherited disease of complete penetrance. The clinical phenotype is a behavioral 
variant FTD. The disease course is unpredictable, and life expectancy is 
reduced. The findings may be applicable to other genetic FTD subtypes.

The analysis presented in the review of publications shows that extract of 
Portulaca oleracea L. or its individual components (polysaccharides, oleracea, 
alkaloids tetrahydroisoquinoline operatein E) is able to increase the lifespan 
of laboratory animals to activate telomerase and increase telomere length, and 
provide antioxidant and antistaatiline impact. Various neuroprotective effects 
(improvement of memory and learning ability, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, 
protection of dopaminergic neurons, improvement of motor functions, etc.) are of 
interest for the prevention of syndromes associated with age - related 
degradation of the nervous system - Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In 
addition, regular consumption of vegetable portulaca in food leads to a decrease 
in the percentage of cancer and cardiovascular diseases, which also directly 
affects the increase in the average life expectancy of the population.

Publisher: Анализ представленных в обзоре публикаций свидетельствует о том, что 
экстракт Portulaca oleracea L., а также отдельные его компоненты (полисахариды, 
олераконы, алкалоид тетрагидроизохинолина — олерацеин Е) способны увеличивать 
продолжительность жизни лабораторных животных, активировать теломеразу и 
увеличивать длину теломер, оказывать антиоксидантное и антиостеокластогенное 
воздействие. Различные нейропротекторные эффекты (улучшение памяти и способности 
к обучению, ингибирование ацетилхолинэстеразы, защита дофаминергических 
нейронов, улучшение двигательных функций и другие) представляют интерес для 
профилактики синдромов, связанных с возрастной деградацией нервной системы — 
болезней Альцгеймера и Паркинсона. Кроме того, регулярное употребление портулака 
огородного в пищу приводит к снижению онкологической и сердечно-сосудистой 
заболеваемости, что также напрямую влияет на увеличение средней 
продолжительности жизни населения.

In recent years, more and more works have appeared that with age, classic risk 
factors that negatively affect the prognosis (cardiovascular diseases) lose 
their influence on life expectancy. The study aimed to assess the influence of 
cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors and structural and functional 
characteristics of the heart on three-year survival in people 95 years and 
older. The study involved 69 patients 95 years and older (98±1,9 years), 61 
(88,4%) were women. After 36 months, data were obtained on the participants' 
status of life: 25 (36,2%) were alive, and 44 (63,8%) died. Based on the 
regression analysis results, it was determined that risk factors and history of 
cardiovascular diseases were not associated with 3-year survival. With a 3-year 
follow-up, the risk of death increases three times with a decrease in diastolic 
blood pressure less than 75 mm/Hg, 7,8 times with a decrease in left ventricular 
ejection fraction below 62%, and 4,9 times with an increase in the end-diastolic 
size of the right ventricle by more than 2,9 cm.

возрастом. Целью исследования была оценка влияния сердечно-сосудистых 
заболеваний, их факторов риска и структурно-функциональных характеристик сердца 
на трехлетнюю выживаемость у лиц 95 лет и старше. В исследовании участвовали 69 
пациентов 95 лет и старше (98±1,9 года), из них 61 (88,4%) женщина и 8 (11,6%) 
мужчин. Через 3 года были получены данные о статусе жизни участников: 25 (36,2%) 
были живы и 44 (63,8%) умерли. По результатам проведенного однофакторного 
регрессионного анализа было определено, что факторы риска и анамнез 
сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний не ассоциированы с трехлетней выживаемостью. 
Однако в трехлетнем периоде риск смерти увеличивался в 3 раза при снижении ДАД

увеличении конечного диастолического размера правого желудочка >2,9 см.

The purpose of this work is to establish the age-related indicators' 
characteristics of the effectiveness of the balance function and the postural 
balance sensory organization in women 85-95 years old. We examined 68 women aged 
85-95 years [mean age (M±SD) 89,3±3 years]. The first age group included 37 
women whose calendar age ranged from 85 to 89 years (mean age 86,9±1,6 years). 
The second age group included 31 women of 90-95 years (mean age: 92,1±1,4). To 
assess the components of the postural balance, a computer-based dynamic 
posturographic complex «Smart Equitest Balance Manager» was used. The Sensory 
Organization Test (SOT) was performed. Comparative assessment of the Equilibrium 
Score indicators in all SOT functional tests, including the Composite of all 
equilibrium scores, did not reveal statistically significant differences between 
the examined groups of women. The sensory analysis did not reveal age-related 
changes in somatosensory, visual and vestibular information in the control over 
balance, either. At the same time, the indicator of sensory preference (Ratio 
for sensory analysis-patient Preference) was higher in women 90-95 years old 
(p=0,007). In women after 89 years of age, there are no age-related changes in 
the sensory organization of postural control or the effectiveness of maintaining 
static and static-dynamic balance. No decrease in overall balance performance, 
as well as the adaptive capabilities of their balance function, was noticed. At 
the same time, long-lived women retain the effectiveness of the sensory 
integration process to maintain postural balance and a sense of spatial 
orientation, which can be considered a predictor of active longevity. In 
addition, centenarians retain the ability of spatial and temporal organization 
of postural equilibrium control, as well as the degree and order of the muscles 
involved to reduce the imbalance recruitment. The results obtained made it 
possible to designate SOT parameters that can be taken into account when 
predicting postural changes and life expectancy in women in old age.

92,1±1,4 года). Для оценки компонентов постурального баланса использовали 
компьютерный динамический постурографический (стабилометрический) комплекс 
«Smart Equitest Balance Manager». Проводили Sensory Organization Test (SOT). 
Сравнительная оценка показателей Equilibrium Score во всех функциональных пробах 
SOT, включая показатель Composite of all Equilibrium Scores, не выявила 
статистически значимых различий между группами обследованных женщин. Сенсорный 
анализ также не выявил возрастных изменений соматосенсорной, зрительной и 
вестибулярной информации в контроле над балансом. При этом показатель сенсорного 
предпочтения (Ratio for Sensory Analysis-Patient Preference) был выше у женщин 
90–95 лет (p=0,007). У женщин после 89 лет не наблюдали возрастных изменений 
сенсорной организации постурального контроля, эффективности подержания 
статического и статодинамического баланса, включая снижение общей 
производительности баланса, а также адаптационных возможностей их функции 
равновесия. При этом у женщин-долгожителей сохраняется эффективность процесса 
сенсорной интеграции для поддержания постурального баланса и чувства 
пространственной ориентации, что можно рассматривать как предиктор активного 
долголетия. Кроме этого, у женщин-долгожителей сохраняется способность 
пространственной и временной организации контроля постурального равновесия, а 
также степени и порядка набора задействованных мышц для снижения дисбаланса. 
Полученные результаты позволили обозначить параметры SOT, которые можно 
учитывать при прогнозировании постуральных изменений и продолжительности жизни у 
женщин в старческом возрасте.

Many zoos in North America feature walk-through exhibits that allow members of 
the public to interact with psittacine species, as these exhibits are popular 
with guests and can generate additional revenue. There is limited research 
available on the life expectancy and common causes of mortality of psittacines 
when group-housed in aviaries. This study compiled data on 496 budgerigar 
(Melopsittacus undulatus) mortalities at a walk-through aviary at a North 
American zoo from March 2009 to March 2019, including histopathology on 62 
tissue sets collected post mortem, and gross necropsy data for 163 birds 
deceased from March 2015 to March 2019. The mean age at death or euthanasia of 
all fledged birds from 2015 to 2019 was 3.57 ± 1.58 yr. The most common causes 
of death or euthanasia found on gross necropsy were granulomatous disease 
(39.2%), trauma (16.0%), and Macrorhabdus ornithogaster (13.5%). The most common 
histologic finding was M. ornithogaster, described as the primary pathologic 
finding in 31.7% of submitted tissue sets, and recorded as a secondary 
pathologic finding in 53.2% of submitted tissue sets. Mycobacterial disease was 
the primary pathologic finding in 25.3% of submitted tissue sets, and was 
recorded as an additional pathologic finding in 35.4% of submitted tissue sets.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Nurses perception and attitude towards an older patient can 
positively or negatively influence the quality rendered. As students under 
training, the views of this population needs to be sought and shaped to improve 
the quality of care the older patients receive. This is because life expectancy 
is on the rise. The study aimed to explore students' perception of ageing and 
their attitude towards care of the older adults.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: An exploratory descriptive design was used. Data form 
containing the sociodemographic attributes of the students and a semi-structured 
interview form developed by the researchers in line with the literature. The 
participants interviewed were student nurses who had been in clinical practice 
for at least one semester. Four focus group discussions (FGD) were held.
RESULTS: Average age of the participants was 22.30 years. An equal number of 
males and females (15 each) were recruited to have a balance in gender. Students 
expressed that they saw the older adults as their grandparents so they try to 
accord them respect and care. However, older adults are perceived not receptive 
to nurses in training. The students stated that registered nurses neglected the 
basic care of older adults such as diaper changes, bathing, and feeding, and 
would rather beckon student nurses to attend to the older adults.
CONCLUSION: Gerontology as a stand-alone course is necessary for early years of 
training to give an in-depth education to nursing students and instil a positive 
attitude towards older adult patients.

This study investigated the removal of selected per- and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances (PFAS) from water via two green sorption media (IFGEM-7 and AGEM-2). 
Both selected green sorption media recipes contain sand (85-91%) and clay 
(3-4%), in addition to recycled iron (Fe) (5-7.5%) or aluminum (Al) (4.5% in 
AGEM-2 only). Batch and column studies were integrated and performed using the 
prescribed green sorption media recipes to determine their efficiencies in 
removing two most targeted PFAS, including perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) 
and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). In the batch test, while the removal 
efficiencies of PFOS ranged from 27 to 46% and 23 to 42%, those for PFOA ranged 
from 6 to 16% and 5 to 18% when using IFGEM-7 and AGEM-2, respectively. The 
higher removal of PFOS than PFOA observed in both IFGEM-7 and AGEM-2 batch tests 
could be attributed to higher media affinity for sulfonate groups of PFOS when 
compared to the carboxylate groups of PFOA. In the column study, the initial 
removal (within 1 h) by IFGEM-7 was greater than 99% for PFOS and 28% for PFOA. 
When comparing different dynamic adsorption models, it appears that the 
non-linear equations could better describe the trend of experimental data 
compared to the linear forms of the Modified Dose Response model. Life 
expectancy calculations, performed for demonstration purposes of field 
applications, suggested that if IFGEM-7 were to be applied in a downflow filter 
box to treat a hypothetical volume of 60,000 L of water during an emergency 
response, and it may last for 1506 h (62.8 d) and 4.2 h for a target removal of 
80% of PFOS and PFOA, respectively.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease with unknown 
etiological factors that can progress to other dangerous diseases like lung 
cancer. Environmental and genetic predisposition are the two major etiological 
or risk factors involved in the pathology of the IPF. Among the environmental 
risk factors, smoking is one of the major causes for the development of IPF. 
Epigenetic pathways like nucleosomes remodeling, DNA methylation, histone 
modifications and miRNA mediated genes play a crucial role in development of 
IPF. Mutations in the genes make the epigenetic factors as important drug 
targets in IPF. Transcriptional changes due to environmental factors are also 
involved in the progression of IPF. The mutations in human telomerase reverse 
transcriptase (hTERT) have shown decreased life expectancy in IPF patients. The 
TERT-gene is highly expressed in chronic smokers and makes the role of 
epigenetics evident. Drug like nintedanib acts through vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptors (VEGFR), while drug pirfenidone acts through 
transforming growth factor (TGF), which is useful in IPF. Gefitinib, a tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor of EGFR, is useful as an anti-fibrosis agent in preclinical 
models. Newer drugs such as Celgene-CC90001 and FibroGen-FG-3019 are currently 
under investigations acts through the modulating epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, 
the study on epigenetics opens a wide window for the discovery of newer drugs. 
This study provides an elementary analysis of multiple regulators of epigenetics 
and their roles associated with the pathology of IPF. Further, this review also 
includes epigenetic drugs under development in preclinical and clinical stages.

Összefoglaló. A malignus daganatok és a stroke együttesen gyakran fordulnak elő 
a stroke tradicionális rizikófaktoraival (magas vérnyomás, hyperlipidaemia, 
cukorbetegség, elhízás, dohányzás) rendelkező betegekben. Az elmúlt évtized 
kutatási eredményei alátámasztották, hogy a rosszindulatú daganatban szenvedő 
betegekben szignifikánsan nagyobb a stroke kockázata. A malignus daganatokhoz 
társuló stroke a leggyakrabban a malignus daganat diagnózisát követő fél-egy év 
során jelentkezik. A kapcsolat a másik irányban is létezik: stroke-betegek 
követése során malignus daganat szignifikánsan gyakrabban jelent meg, mint a 
stroke-mentes kontrollcsoportban. A daganatot a leginkább a stroke utáni első 
hat hónapban diagnosztizálják. A korábban nem ismert rosszindulatú daganat 
időnként az akut stroke kezelése során derül ki. Ismeretlen eredetű stroke 
(cryptogen stroke) hátterében rosszindulatú tumorhoz társuló hiperkoagulabilitás 
is feltételezhető. A háttérben a leggyakrabban tüdőrák áll, ezt az emlőcarcinoma 
és a melanoma követi. Jelenleg nincs ajánlás a felismert malignus daganatok 
esetében a stroke primer prevenciójára. A malignus tumor mellett jelentkező akut 
ischaemiás stroke kezelésére a rekombináns szöveti plazminogénaktivátorral 
történő intravénás thrombolysis alkalmazható a várható túlélés és a 
vérzésveszély mérlegelésével; a mechanikus thrombectomia alkalmazásáról kevés az 
adat, irányelvszintű ajánlások még nincsenek. A másodlagos stroke-prevencióra a 
kis molekulasúlyú heparinnal történő antikoagulálást javasolják. Jelenleg még 
nem ismerjük pontos részleteiben a daganat által okozott hiperkoaguláció 
mechanizmusát, ezért még nem ismert, hogy mi a legjobb módszer tumoros 
betegeknél a stroke megelőzésére. Nincsenek jól definiált ajánlások arra sem, 
hogy milyen esetekben lenne indokolt tumorkeresés cryptogen stroke-os 
betegekben. Orv Hetil. 2022; 163(2): 43-51. Summary. Cancer and stroke occur in 
similar patient populations, and they have similar traditional risk factors 
(hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes, and smoking), therefore, it is 
beneficial to study the relationship between cancer and stroke. Patients 
diagnosed with cancer have an increased incidence of acute ischemic cerebral 
events within the first 6 months up to a year post diagnosis. The reverse 
relationship is also true for patients diagnosed with stroke and then cancer. 
Interestingly, patients may have a stroke as their first indication to an 
underlying developing cancer and will most often be diagnosed with cancer 
sometime within six months to a year after the cerebral incident. When cancer is 
diagnosed immediately after a cryptogenic stroke (unknown etiology), the stroke 
may be a result of cancer-associated hypercoagulability. The most common 
malignancies observed in the cancer-stroke patients are lung, breast and 
melanoma. Currently, there are no pharmacologic recommendations for primary 
stroke prevention in cancer patients. For acute ischemic stroke, life expectancy 
and the potential for hemorrhagic complications should be considered when 
deciding on thrombolytic treatment. Only a few case series have been reported on 
mechanical thrombectomy in malignancies, and there are no guideline 
recommendations yet. Secondary prevention is advised through low molecular 
weight heparin. Understanding cancer-associated hypercoagulability and the ways 
we can prevent the combined effects of cancer and stroke is a crucial gap that 
requires further studies. Additionally, guides to aid in the recognition of 
underlying malignancy in patients suffering from cryptogenic stroke need to be 
established. Orv Hetil. 2022; 163(2): 43-51.

BACKGROUND: The US rural disadvantage in life expectancy (LE) relative to urban 
areas has grown over time. We measured the contribution of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD), drug-overdose deaths (DODs) and other major causes of death to LE 
trends in rural and urban counties and the rural-urban LE gap.
METHODS: Counterfactual life tables and cause-of-death decompositions were 
constructed using data on all US deaths in 1999-2019 (N = 51 998 560) from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
RESULTS: During 1999-2009, rural and urban counties experienced robust LE gains, 
but urban LE increased by 1.19 years more in women and 0.86 years more in men 
compared with rural LE. During 2010-2019, rural counties experienced absolute 
declines in LE (women -0.20, men -0.30 years), whereas urban counties 
experienced modest increases (women 0.55, men 0.29 years). Counterfactual 
analysis showed that slowed CVD-mortality declines, particularly in ages 
65+ years, were the main reason why rural LE stopped increasing after 2010. 
However, slow progress in CVD-mortality influenced LE trends more in urban 
areas. If CVD-mortality had continued to decline at its pre-2010 pace, the 
rural-urban LE gap would have grown even more post 2010. DODs and other causes 
of death also contributed to the LE trends and differences in each period, but 
their impact in comparison to that of CVD was relatively small.
CONCLUSIONS: Rural disadvantage in LE continues to grow, but at a slower pace 
than pre 2010. This slowdown is more attributable to adverse trends in CVD and 
DOD mortality in urban areas than improvements in rural areas.

Significant advances in supportive care for patients with transfusion-dependent 
thalassemia major (TDT) have improved patients' life expectancy. However, 
transfusion-associated iron overload remains a significant barrier to long-term 
survival with good quality of life. Today, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT) is the current curative standard of care. Alongside 
selection of the best available donor, an optimized conditioning regimen is 
crucial to maximize outcomes for patients with TDT undergoing HSCT. The aim of 
this retrospective analysis was to investigate the role of 
busulfan-fludarabine-based and treosulfan-fludarabine-based conditioning in TDT 
patients undergoing HSCT. We included 772 patients registered in the European 
Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) database who underwent first 
HSCT between 2010 and 2018. Four hundred ten patients received 
busulfan-fludarabine-based conditioning (median age 8.6 years) and 362 patients 
received treosulfan-fludarabine-based conditioning (median age 5.7 years). 
Patient outcomes were retrospectively compared by conditioning regimen. Two-year 
overall survival was 92.7% (95% confidence interval: 89.3-95.1%) after 
busulfan-fludarabine-based conditioning and 94.7% (95% confidence interval: 
91.7-96.6%) after treosulfan-fludarabine-based conditioning. There was a very 
low incidence of second HSCT overall. The main causes of death were infections, 
graft-versus-host disease, and rejection. In conclusion, use of busulfan or 
treosulfan as the backbone of myeloablative conditioning for patients with TDT 
undergoing HSCT resulted in comparably high cure rates. Long-term follow-up 
studies are warranted to address the important issues of organ toxicities and 
gonadal function.

The needs of the aging populations are putting increasing burden on healthcare 
particularly in the Western Pacific Region (WPR), which is the home of aging 
economies such as Hong Kong and Japan alongside rapid increases in older people 
in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, little is known about the 
associations between sociodemographic factors, disease burden, and life 
expectancy in WPR. The current study conducted secondary analysis on the Global 
Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates of populations aged 70 years and older in WPR 
countries between 1995 and 2019. Correlation tests, linear mixed regressions and 
generalized additive mixture models were run to examine the associations of 
interest. Unsupervised machine learning was conducted to segment the data 
automatically, at cluster analysis. The sociodemographic development index was 
found an important factor to the disease burden in terms of Years Lived with 
Disability (YLD) rate and mortality rate among older adults. YLD rate and 
mortality rate of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) attributable to different 
risk groups were significant contributors to higher expectation of Lost Healthy 
Years (LHE) and shorter life expectancy respectively in the context of rising 
YLD rate, particularly in LMICs. Three clusters of countries with similar 
characteristics were identified. NCDs were the most significant contributors to 
shorter life expectancy within which the time living in poor health did not 
improve. Better management of NCDs in aging populations should be emphasized in 
all countries. The country clusters may help in a more regional strategic 
planning.

Bacillus species isolated from honeybee Apis mellifera gut, honey and bee bread 
samples were characterized for their in vitro probiotic and safety attributes. 
Alpha and γ haemolytic cultures were tested for their antibiotic resistance, 
antibacterial spectrum, acid and bile tolerance, adhesion ability 
(auto-aggregation, co-aggregation and hydrophobicity) and phenol tolerance. 
Safety criteria included evaluation of virulence genes and cytotoxicity 
percentages. Bacillus isolates inhibited both Gram-positive and Gram-negative 
pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus 
faecalis and Streptococcus mutans, while none could inhibit Listeria 
monocytogenes. Among the isolates, Bacillus subtilis ZH05, ZB03 and ZG025 showed 
resistance to most of the tested antibiotics and were considered unsafe. B. 
subtilis (4) and B. licheniformis (1) tolerated acidic pH and bile conditions, 
never the less were more tolerant in simulated intestinal conditions vis-a-vis 
gastric conditions. In 0·5% phenol concentrations, B. licheniformis ZH02 showed 
highest growth, while, B. subtilis ZG029 demonstrated highest auto-aggregation 
(65 ± 4·6) and hydrophobicity (23 ± 3·6) percentages (P < 0·05). The isolates 
lacked virulence genes (hblA, hblC, hblD, nhe, cytK and ces), and their 
cytotoxic percentage on Caco-2 cell lines was ˂15%. Overall, honeybees appear to 
be a good source of Bacillus species exhibiting typical in vitro probiotic 
properties, which could be of commercial interest.

As life expectancy grows, brain health is increasingly seen as central to what 
we mean by successful aging-and vascular brain health as central to overall 
brain health. Cerebrovascular pathologies are highly prevalent independent 
contributors to age-related cognitive impairment and at least partly modifiable 
with available treatments. The current Focused Update addresses vascular brain 
health from multiple angles, ranging from pathophysiologic mechanisms and
