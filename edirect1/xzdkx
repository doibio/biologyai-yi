BACKGROUND: The use of single rooms for patient isolation often forms part of a 
wider bundle to prevent certain healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in 
hospitals. Demand for single rooms often exceeds what is available and the use 
of temporary isolation rooms may help resolve this. Changes to infection 
prevention practice should be supported by evidence showing that 
cost-effectiveness is plausible and likely.
AIM: To perform a cost-effectiveness evaluation of adopting temporary single 
rooms into UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of a decision to adopt a temporary, 
single-patient, isolation room to the current infection prevention efforts of an 
NHS hospital was modelled. Primary outcomes are the expected change to total 
costs and life-years from an NHS perspective.
FINDINGS: The mean expected incremental cost per life-year gained (LYG) is 
£5,829. The probability that adoption is cost-effective against a £20,000 
threshold per additional LYG is 93%, and for a £13,000 threshold the probability 
is 87%. The conclusions are robust to scenarios for key model parameters. If a 
temporary single-patient isolation room reduces risks of HAI by 16.5% then an 
adoption decision is more likely to be cost-effective than not. Our estimate of 
the effectiveness reflects guidelines and reasonable assumptions and the 
theoretical rationale is strong.
CONCLUSION: Despite uncertainties about the effectiveness of temporary isolation 
rooms for reducing risks of HAI, there is some evidence that an adoption 
decision is likely to be cost-effective for the NHS setting. Prospective studies 
will be useful to reduce this source of uncertainty.

The role that genetic background may play in the responsiveness of organisms to 
interventions such as caloric restriction (CR) is underappreciated but 
potentially important. We investigated the impact of genetic background on a 
suite of metabolic parameters in female recombinant inbred ILSXISS mouse strains 
previously reported to show divergent lifespan responses to 40% CR 
(TejJ89-lifespan extension; TejJ48-lifespan unaffected; TejJ114-lifespan 
shortening). Body mass was reduced across all strains following 10 months of 40% 
CR, although this loss (relative to ad libitum controls) was greater in TejJ114 
relative to the other strains. Gonadal white adipose tissue (gWAT) mass was 
similarly reduced across all strains following 40% CR, but brown adipose tissue 
(BAT) mass increased only in strains TejJ89 and TejJ48. Surprisingly, glucose 
tolerance was improved most notably by CR in TejJ114, while both strains TejJ89 
and TejJ114 were hyperinsulinemic following CR relative to their AL controls. We 
subsequently undertook an unbiased metabolomic approach in gWAT and BAT tissue 
derived from strains TejJ89 and TejJ114 mice under AL and 40% CR. In gWAT from 
TejJ89 a significant reduction in several long chain unsaturated fatty acids was 
observed following 40% CR, but gWAT from TejJ114 appeared relatively 
unresponsive to CR with far fewer metabolites changing. 
Phosphatidylethanoloamine lipids within the BAT were typically elevated in 
TejJ89 following CR, while some phosphatidylglycerol lipids were decreased. 
However, BAT from strain TejJ114 again appeared unresponsive to CR. These data 
highlight strain-specific metabolic differences exist in ILSXISS mice following 
40% CR. We suggest that precisely how different fat depots respond dynamically 
to CR may be an important factor in the variable longevity under 40% CR reported 
in these mice.

cutaneous melanoma.

Approximately half of metastatic cutaneous melanomas (CM) harbor a mutation in 
the BRAF protooncogene, upregulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK)-pathway. The development of inhibitors targeting the MAPK pathway 
(MAPKi), i.e., BRAF- and MEK-inhibitors (BRAFi and MEKi), have substantially 
improved the survival in BRAFV600E/K-mutated stage IV metastatic CM. However, 
most patients develop resistance to treatment and no predictive biomarkers exist 
in practice. This study aimed at discovering plasma proteome changes during 
treatment MAPKi in patients with metastatic (stage IV) CM. Matched plasma 
samples before (pre) and during treatment (trm) from 23 patients with stage IV 
CM, treated with BRAF-inhibitors (BRAFi) alone or BRAF- and MEK- inhibitors 
combined (BRAFi and MEKi), were collected and analyzed with targeted proteomics 
by proximity extension assays. Additionally, plasma from 9 patients treated with 
BRAFi and MEKi was analyzed with in-depth high-resolution isoelectric focusing 
liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry proteomics. Alterations of plasma 
proteins involved in granzyme and interferon gamma pathways were detected in 
patients treated with BRAFi, and cell adhesion-, neutrophil degranulation-, and 
proteolysis pathways in patients treated with BRAFi and MEKi. Several proteins 
were associated with progression-free survival after MAPKi treatment. We show 
that the majority of the altered plasma proteins were traceable to 
BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic CM tissue at mRNA level in 154 patients from the 
TCGA, further strengthening their involvement in tumoral response to treatment. 
This wide screen of plasma proteins unravels proteins that may serve as 
predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers of MAPKi treatment, opening a window of 
opportunity for plasma biomarker discovery in MAPKi-treatment of BRAFV600-mutant 
metastatic CM.

The species Leuconostoc citreum is often isolated from grain and vegetable 
fermentations such as sourdough, sauerkraut and kimchi. Lc. citreum has seen an 
increase in its use as a starter culture for various fermentations and food 
applications. The strain Lc. citreum TR116 has been applied previously in this 
laboratory aimed at sugar depletion through metabolism resulting in the 
reduction of fructose to mannitol, a polyol considered as a sweet carbohydrate. 
Besides reducing sugar, TR116 showed flavour modulating characteristics and 
contributes to the extension of microbial shelf life. In order to obtain a 
better understanding of this strain and to fully use its set of abilities, the 
genome of Lc. citreum TR116 was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq, assembly 
with SPAdes and annotated by the Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline. 
Metabolic reconstruction was employed to elucidate carbohydrate, organic acid 
and amino acid metabolism in the strain. Of particular interest was the gene 
expression analysis ascertained the influence of fructose on the genes mdh and 
manX involved in the uptake of fructose and its conversion to mannitol. This 
investigation, the first in Lc. citreum, illustrates the metabolic processes 
involved in fermentation used by this strain and demonstrates that in the 
presence of fructose, expression of the genes mdh and manX is increased. The 
resulting transparency of the skill set of TR116 contributes highly to future 
functionalisation of food systems and food ingredients.

A range of anthropogenic factors are causing unprecedented bee declines. Among 
these drivers the usage of pesticides is believed to be crucial. While the use 
of key bee-harming insecticides, such as the neonicotinoids, has been reduced by 
regulatory authorities, novel, less studied substances have occupied their 
market niche. Understanding the threat of these chemicals to bees is, therefore, 
crucial to their conservation. Here we focus on sulfoxaflor, a novel 
insecticide, targeting the same neural receptor as the neonicotinoids. In stark 
contrast to the growing concerns around its negative impacts on bee health, a 
recent assessment has resulted in the extension of its authorisations across the 
USA. However, such assessments may underestimate risks by overlooking 
interactive impacts of multiple stressors. Here we investigated co-occurring, 
lethal and sublethal risks of sulfoxaflor and a dietary stress for bumblebees 
(Bombus terrestris), a key pollinator. Specifically, we employed a novel 
microcolony design, where, for the first time in bees, pesticide exposure 
mimicked natural degradation. We orally exposed workers to sulfoxaflor and a 
sugar-deficient diet in a fully factorial design. Field realistic, worst-case 
sulfoxaflor exposure caused a sharp increase in bee mortality. At sublethal 
concentrations, sulfoxaflor negatively affected bee fecundity, but not survival. 
Nutritional stress reduced bee fecundity and synergistically or additively 
aggravated impacts of sulfoxaflor on bee survival, egg laying and larval 
production. Our data show that non-mitigated label uses of sulfoxaflor may have 
major, yet severely neglected effects on bumblebee health, which may be 
exacerbated by nutritional stress. By unravelling mechanistic interactions of 
synergistic risks, our study highlights the need to overcome inherent 
limitations of Environmental Risk Assessment schemes, which, being based on a 
"single stressor paradigm", may fail to inform policymakers of the real risks of 
pesticide use.

Demographic studies on translocated primate groups provide a unique opportunity 
to study population dynamics, social strategies, and reproductive parameters of 
a species adapting to new environments. In 1996, 38 Japanese macaques (Macaca 
fuscata) of the Minoo-H group (Osaka Prefecture, Japan) were translocated to 
Affenberg Landskron, a four-hectare naturally forested park in southern Austria. 
By January 2020, the population had increased to 160 individuals, and a total of 
223 births were recorded. Births peaked in late April to late May, and the 
timing was influenced by neither offspring sex nor parity status of the mother. 
Infant mortality was low (8.97%), mostly involving primiparous females, and the 
average interbirth intervals were shorter following the death of an infant (1.10 
years) than a surviving infant (1.77 years). Females rarely had offspring with 
the same males repeatedly, and the reproductive success among males declined 
with increasing years of presence in the group. The main aspects of 
reproduction, mortality, and mate choice are consistent with published data on 
natural and provisioned populations in Japan and those translocated to other 
countries. The life expectancy for females, however, was relatively high (11.72% 
chance of reaching the age of 20), whereas birth control prevented them from 
using their lifetime reproductive potential. By January 2020, the number of old 
individuals (> 18 years; 17.5%) was close to that of juveniles (< 4 years; 
22.5%). The specific group composition, along with the inability of males to 
emigrate out of their natal group, may affect the social dynamics of the 
population, which merits further attention in future studies.

The rise of life expectancy of the human population is accompanied by the 
drastic increases of age-associated diseases, in particular Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), and underscores the need to understand how aging influences AD 
development. The Forkhead box O transcription factor 3 (FoxO3) is known to 
mediate aging and longevity downstream of insulin/insulin-like growth factor 
signaling across species. However, its function in the adult brain under 
physiological and pathological conditions is less understood. Here, we report a 
region and cell-type-specific regulation of FoxO3 in the central nervous system 
(CNS). We found that FoxO3 protein levels were reduced in the cortex, but not 
hippocampus, of aged mice. FoxO3 was responsive to insulin/AKT signaling in 
astrocytes, but not neurons. Using CNS Foxo3-deficient mice, we reveal that loss 
of FoxO3 led to cortical astrogliosis and altered lipid metabolism. This is 
associated with impaired metabolic homoeostasis and β-amyloid (Aβ) uptake in 
primary astrocyte cultures. These phenotypes can be reversed by expressing a 
constitutively active FOXO3 but not a FOXO3 mutant lacking the transactivation 
domain. Loss of FoxO3 in 5xFAD mice led to exacerbated Aβ pathology and synapse 
loss and altered local response of astrocytes and microglia in the vicinity of 
Aβ plaques. Astrocyte-specific overexpression of FOXO3 displayed opposite 
effects, suggesting that FoxO3 functions cell autonomously to mediate astrocyte 
activity and also interacts with microglia to address Aβ pathology. Our studies 
support a protective role of astroglial FoxO3 against brain aging and AD.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the management of patients with 
cancer. The increasing use of these agents has brought up a new set of adverse 
events which are widely heterogenous and potentially life-threatening. Rare 
immune-related adverse events associated with nervous system have not been 
described thoroughly, but their early recognition and management may be crucial. 
Immune-related autonomic neuropathy may be presented with a constellation of 
symptoms ranging from gastrointestinal and urinary complaints, to sweating and 
hypotension. Intestinal pseudo-obstruction as consequence of immune-related 
myenteric autonomic neuropathy is an under-recognized, not-well described and 
potentially fatal adverse event. We herein, present a unique case of enteric 
plexus neuropathy induced by PD-L1 blockade in a patient with small-cell lung 
cancer.

Plain Language Summary: Lay abstract Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors has improved the life expectancy in many cancer patients. However, 
the stimulation of immune system to fight cancer may also affect healthy 
tissues, bringing about the risk of adverse events. These adverse events may 
affect almost every organ system of the body and may vary from mild to 
life-threatening. Immunotherapy-related damage to nervous plexuses, which supply 
the guts with nerves, has been reported only in a small number of cases. The 
symptoms usually mimic those of gut inflammation, including diarrhea, 
constipation, abdominal distension, and vomiting. Upon these symptoms, enteric 
nervous system toxicity should be considered. Early recognition and management 
are crucial to stop further neurological damage. We present a rare case of 
enteric nerve damage in a patient with small-cell lung cancer treated with 
immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia causes significant morbidity and mortality in 
advanced lung cancer patients. Clinical benefit of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, 
arginine, and glutamine (HMB/Arg/Gln) was assessed in newly diagnosed patients.
METHODS: NOURISH, a prospective, two-arm, open-label, multi-centre, randomised 
controlled phase II trial compared cachexia in patients who received HMB/Arg/Gln 
with those who did not. All patients received structured nutritional, exercise 
and symptom control via a Macmillan Durham Cachexia Pack. Conducted in five UK 
centres, patients aged > 18 years, with newly diagnosed advanced small cell lung 
cancer (SCLC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who were able to take oral 
nutrition, with a performance status of 0-to-2 and a life expectancy > 4 months 
were eligible for trial entry. Patients suitable for treatment with curative 
intent were ineligible. The trial was designed as a signal-seeking pilot study 
with target recruitment of 96 patients. One-to-one randomisation was stratified 
by diagnosis (SCLC or NSCLC), stage of disease (locally advanced or metastatic) 
and performance status. The primary outcome measure was treatment success 
defined as a patient being alive without significant loss of lean body mass (not 
> 5%) by 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included quality of life.
RESULTS: Between February-2012 and February-2013, 38 patients were recruited, 19 
to each arm. Baseline characteristics were balanced. The trial was halted due to 
slow accrual and partial adherence. Trial data demonstrated no evidence of 
treatment benefit. No serious adverse events were reported during the trial.
CONCLUSIONS: Further evaluation of HMB/Arg/Gln in this setting could not be 
recommended on the basis of this trial.

INTRODUCTION: Over the last few decades, the quality of care and the quality of 
life of nursing home (NH) residents have significantly improved, but 
insufficient physical activity and social involvement still represent 
substantial challenges in modern nursing facilities. The main aim of this 
research was to assess the influence of physical exercises with dance movement 
therapy (DMT) elements on strength and other fitness components of the upper 
limbs and the overall functional performance of NH residents in wheelchairs 
compared to standard exercise programmes and usual care.
METHOD: The study participants were persons aged 68-85 who lived in NH and used 
manual wheelchairs as a primary means of mobility. Individuals meeting the 
inclusion criteria were assigned to one of the three groups: Group 1, basic 
exercise/BE group (n = 55); group 2, physical exercises with elements of dance 
movement therapy/PED group (n = 55); and group 3, control group, usual care/CO 
group (n = 55). The intervention for both exercising groups consisted of a 
30-min session, two times a week, for 12 weeks in total. Outcome assessments 
were performed at baseline, 12 weeks after baseline (immediately after the 
intervention) and 24 weeks after baseline (12 weeks after the intervention). The 
main outcome was observed for hand grip strength (HGS), while secondary outcomes 
for box and block test (BBT), arm curl test (ACT), back scratch test (BS), chair 
sit-and-reach (CSR), peak expiratory flow (PEF), Barthel Index (BI), Berg 
Balance Scale (BBS) and the range of motion of the shoulder.
RESULTS: Prior to the start of the exercise programmes, all the tested groups 
were homogeneous. After 12 weeks the PED group presented higher statistically 
significant scores in HGSL, BBT, ACT, BS, CSR, BI, BBS: p < 0.001 and HGSR: 
p = 0.01, compared to the BE group. After 24 weeks from the beginning of the 
intervention the comparison between the PED group and the BE group showed 
statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) in favour of PED group in 
almost all areas: HGSR, HGSL, BBT: ACT, PEF, BS, CSR, BI. After 12 and 24 weeks 
both intervention groups performed better than the CO in all measures except for 
Katz ADL and shoulder extension.
CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of physical exercises had beneficial effects on the 
strength and fitness of the upper limbs and overall functional performance in 
both exercise groups. This study demonstrated that group performing physical 
exercises with elements of DMT obtained statistically better scores in the 
majority of analysed domains than other groups.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the education of children around the world, 
forcing a large proportion of teaching to be carried out remotely. The 
implications of this disruption have yet to be fully elucidated, but initial 
assessments suggest that COVID-19-related school closures and reliance on 
virtual learning may have a long-term negative impact on educational attainment 
and future earnings as well as life expectancy of children in the United States. 
Among children with neurodegenerative disorders, such as neuronopathic 
mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS disorders), the effects of the pandemic are likely to 
be even greater. We aim to shine a spotlight on the impact of COVID-19 on the 
education, treatment and general wellbeing of children and families affected by 
MPS disorders by highlighting the important role that educators and therapists 
play in supporting the neurocognitive function and quality of life of children 
with neuronopathic MPS disorders. This article will serve as a resource that 
caregivers, educators, clinicians and therapists can use when considering how 
best to advocate for children with neuronopathic MPS disorders in circumstances 
where in-school teaching or in-clinic treatment is compromised or not possible. 
Given that the current pandemic is likely to have a prolonged course and impact 
and that similar epidemics and pandemics are a near certainty in the future, it 
is essential that steps are taken to support the learning and care of children 
with neuronopathic MPS disorders. We must prioritize strategies to safely resume 
this fragile community's access to in-person education and supportive care, and 
to address gaps that have emerged during prolonged pauses in access, whenever 
possible.

Cow's milk protein allergy is an urgent problem in young children. Early 
diagnostics and formation of therapeutic tactics are the basic priorities in 
allergy treatment among young children. Oral provocation tests, which can be 
performed only in medical establishments, are a golden standard for diagnosing 
food allergy. Active search continues for optimal scheme of diagnosing cow's 
milk protein allergy in children in the first year of life. The aim of our 
research was to create the algorithm of diagnosing cow's milk protein allergy in 
children younger than one year of age, which will optimize obtaining reliable 
data on a patient's condition and decrease a load of laboratory examinations on 
young children using elimination and provocation food test. To complete the set 
goal, a record of allergological anamnesis, examination, assessment of physical 
condition and determination of specific IgE to cow's milk proteins were 
conducted to diagnose cow's milk protein allergy. Then, based on the obtained 
results, elimination and provocation food test was performed in two phases - 
elimination phase and provocation phase. Diagnostic in vitro is needed to choose 
the level of medical establishment for conduction of oral provocation tests: in 
case a specific IgE index is over 0.7 kU/L, testing is performed in an intensive 
care unit, if IgE is less than 0.7 kU/L - in a specialized inpatient department. 
Three clinical cases involving different methods have been presented for 
diagnosing cow's milk protein allergy - elimination and provocation test, oral 
provocation test and administration of individual diet based on the obtained 
results. A complex diagnostic approach, in particular, study of anamnesis, 
record of nutrition diary, elimination diet, enables to optimize diagnostics of 
food allergy, and diagnostic addition of a product - to assess tolerance 
clinically during extension of diet. An elaborated method of diagnosing cow's 
milk protein allergy in children younger than one year of age can be recommended 
for wide use in a clinical practice.

Stroke survivors can be affected by motor deficits in the hand. Robotic 
equipment associated with brain-machine interfaces (BMI) may aid the motor 
rehabilitation of these patients. BMIs involving orthotic control by motor 
imagery practices have been successful in restoring stroke patients' movements. 
However, there is still little acceptance of the robotic devices available, 
either by patients and clinicians, mainly because of the high costs involved. 
Motivated by this context, this work aims to design and construct the Hand 
Exoskeleton for Rehabilitation Objectives (HERO) to recover extension and 
flexion movements of the fingers. A three-dimensional (3D) printing technique in 
association with textiles was used to produce a lightweight and wearable device. 
3D-printed actuators have also been designed to reduce equipment costs. The 
actuator transforms the torque of DC motors into linear force transmitted by 
Bowden cables to move the fingers passively. The exoskeleton was controlled by 
neuroelectric signal-electroencephalography (EEG). Concept tests were performed 
to evaluate control performance. A healthy volunteer was submitted to a training 
session with the exoskeleton, according to the Graz-BCI protocol. Ergonomy was 
evaluated with a two-dimensional (2D) tracking software and correlation 
analysis. HERO can be compared to ordinary clothing. The weight over the hand 
was around 102 g. The participant was able to control the exoskeleton with a 
classification accuracy of 91.5%. HERO project resulted in a lightweight, 
simple, portable, ergonomic, and low-cost device. Its use is not restricted to a 
clinical setting. Thus, users will be able to execute motor training with the 
HERO at hospitals, rehabilitation clinics, and at home, increasing the 
rehabilitation intervention time. This may support motor rehabilitation and 
improve stroke survivors life quality.

PURPOSE: Although subjective knowledge about the prognosis of an advanced 
disease is extremely important for coping and treatment planning, the concept of 
prognostic awareness (PA) remains inconsistently defined. The aims of the 
scoping review were to synthesize a definition of PA from the most recent 
literature, describe preconditions, correlates and consequences, and suggest a 
conceptual model.
METHODS: By using scoping review methodology, we searched the Web of Science and 
PubMed databases, and included publications, reviews, meta-analyses or 
guidelines on all physical diagnoses, as well as publications offering a 
conceptual or an operational definition of PA. The data were analyzed by means 
of content analysis techniques.
RESULTS: Of the 24 included publications, 21 referred exclusively to cancer, one 
to patients with hip fractures and two to palliative care in general. The 
deduced definition of PA comprised the following facets: adequate estimation of 
chances for recovery, knowledge of limited time to live, adequate estimation of 
life expectancy, knowledge of therapy goals, and knowledge of the course of the 
disease. Further content analysis results were mapped graphically and in a 
detailed table.
CONCLUSION: There appears to be a lack of theoretical embedding of PA that in 
turn influences the methods used for empirical investigation. Drawing on a clear 
conceptual definition, longitudinal or experimental studies would be desirable.

Humorous Coping With Unrequited Love: Is Perspective Change Important?

A large number of studies suggest that humor is associated with mental 
well-being and effective as a means of coping. However, it is less 
well-understood which mechanisms are effective for this particular function of 
humor. The present study examines whether processes of change of perspective, 
which are often regarded as constitutive for humor, could be an effective 
coping-factor when facing unrequited love as a specific psychological burden. In 
a questionnaire study, N = 148 persons aged 18-65 years (w = 96) with actual or 
past experiences of unrequited love reported on their subjective burden due to 
this experience, their self-esteem and satisfaction with life, two scales for 
humor (Multidimensional Sense of Humor Scale: MSHS, and a self-constructed 
scale: Humorous Change of Perspective, HCOP) and a coping scale which measure 
change of perspective in the confrontation with goal blockages (Flexible Goal 
Adjustment, FGA). Results indicated that the burden of unrequited love 
[operationalized objectively as actuality of experience (dichotomous) or 
subjectively as burden experienced] and both indicators of well-being were 
negatively associated. Multiple regression analyses showed that humor was a 
significant moderator of this relationship in nearly all combinations of 
operationalizations of humor and indicators of well-being: Higher levels of 
humor are associated with better well-being even when the perceived burden was 
high. In addition, the study examined whether the coping effect of humor can be 
partly or mainly attributed to the individual's capacity to perspective change 
as captured by FGA. When including this scale as a covariate in the regression 
models, the moderation effect for MSHS did not persist; however, for HCOP the 
moderation effect remained unchanged: the moderator effect of humorous change of 
perspective proved to be independent of FGA. Taken together the results suggest 
that perspective-changing skills play a significant role in the coping effect of 
humor in dealing with psychological burdens. However, depending on which humor 
facet is measured, the entailed perspective change may or may not appear to go 
beyond what the individual's FGA can account for. This suggests that the coping 
effect caused by humorous change of perspective includes aspects that are also 
discussed for other coping resources as well as its own, humor-specific aspects. 
Potential avenues for future studies are discussed both with respect to the 
necessity for replication and extension of the present study and to the 
determination of other potential alleviativing effects of other facets of humor.

INTRODUCTION: Novel clade 2.3.4.4 H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus 
(HPAIV) outbreaks have occurred since early 2015 in Taiwan and impacted the 
island economically, like they have many countries. This research investigates 
the immunogenicity of two HPAIV-like particles to assess their promise as 
vaccine candidates.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The haemagglutinin (HA) gene derived from clade 2.3.4.4 H5 
HPAIV and matrix protein 1 (M1) gene were cloned into the pFastBac Dual 
baculovirus vector. The resulting recombinant viruses were expressed in 
Spodoptera frugiperda moth (Sf)21 cells and silkworm pupae to generate Sf21 
virus-like particles (VLP) and silkworm pupa VLP. Two-week-old specific 
pathogen-free chickens were immunised and their humoral and cellular immune 
responses were analysed.
RESULTS: The silkworm pupa VLP had higher haemagglutination competence. Both VLP 
types elicited haemagglutination inhibition antibodies, anti-HA antibodies, 
splenic interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) mRNA expression, and 
CD4+/CD8+ ratio elevation. However, chickens receiving silkworm pupa VLP 
exhibited a significantly higher anti-HA antibody titre in ELISA after 
vaccination. Although Sf21 VLP recipients expressed more IFN-γ and IL-4, the 
increase in IFN-γ did not significantly raise the CD4+/CD8+ ratio and the 
increase in IL-4 did not promote anti-HA antibodies.
CONCLUSION: Both VLP systems possess desirable immunogenicity in vivo. However, 
in respect of immunogenic efficacy and the production cost, pupa VLP may be the 
superior vaccine candidate against clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAIV infection.

University Qingdao China.

Vascular senescence is one of the hotspots in current research. With global 
average life expectancy increasing, delaying or reducing aging and age-related 
diseases has become a pressing issue for improving quality of life. Vascular 
senescence is an independent risk factor for age-related cardiovascular diseases 
(CVD) and results in the deterioration of CVD. Nevertheless, the underlying 
mechanisms of the vascular senescence have not been expressly illustrated. In 
this review, we attempt to summarize the recent literature in the field and 
discuss the major mechanisms involved in vascular senescence. We also underline 
key molecular aspects of aging-associated vascular dysfunction in the attempt to 
highlight potential innovative therapeutic targets to delay the onset of 
age-related diseases.

BACKGROUND: A recently conducted matching-adjusted indirect comparison 
demonstrated that bosutinib improved progression-free survival, and delayed 
progression to advanced disease compared with dasatinib and nilotinib in 
patients with second line (2L) chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML). 
However, the long-term clinical and economic impact of using bosutinib versus 
dasatinib and nilotinib has not been evaluated. The objective was to determine 
the cost-effectiveness of bosutinib compared with dasatinib and bosutinib 
compared with nilotinib from a US payer perspective.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed using partition survival 
methods and three health states: progression-free, progression, and death. Trial 
data (individual patient-level and aggregate-level data) informed the 
progression-free and overall survival estimates. Costs included drugs and 
medical resource use. Utility values were obtained from literature. Sensitivity 
analyses (SAs) included one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs).
RESULTS: Comparing bosutinib versus dasatinib resulted in a gain of 0.4 
discounted life years, 1.5 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental 
costs of $28,459 (values in 2020 US dollars), for an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $19,811/QALY gained. Comparing bosutinib 
versus nilotinib resulted in a gain of 0.8 discounted life-years, 1.8 QALYs, and 
incremental costs of $76,563, for an ICER of $41,932/QALY gained. Drug costs and 
extrapolation distribution type were the main drivers of the model in the 
one-way SAs. In the PSAs, bosutinib had >90% and >80% probabilities of being 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY versus 
dasatinib and nilotinib, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that compared with dasatinib and nilotinib, 
bosutinib may represent good value for money for treating 2L CP-CML patients.

BACKGROUND: Prone hip extension (PHE) has been investigated to strengthen the 
hip joint and back extensor muscles. However, it has not been compared with 
various PHE exercises in individuals with iliopsoas shortness.
OBJECTIVE: This study compared pelvic compensation and hip and back extensor 
muscle activities in individuals with iliopsoas shortness during prone hip 
extension (PHE) using the abdominal drawing-in maneuver alone (PHEA) and after 
iliopsoas stretching (PHEAS).
METHODS: Twenty-five individuals with iliopsoas shortness were included in the 
study. Electromyography was used to investigate bilateral erector spinae (ES) 
and ipsilateral gluteus maximus (GM), biceps femoris (BF), and semitendinosus 
(ST) muscles during PHE, PHEA, and PHEAS. Pelvic anterior tilting and rotation 
angles were measured during each PHE exercise via electromagnetic motion 
tracking. A modified Thomas test was used to examine the hip extension angle 
before and after iliopsoas stretching. One-way repeated-measures analysis of 
variance was used to investigate differences in pelvic anterior tilting and 
rotation angle and in hip and back extensor muscle activities among PHE, PHEA, 
and PHEAS. The level of statistical significance was set at α= 0.01.
RESULTS: GM muscle activity was significantly greater with PHEAS, compared to 
PHE and PHEA (p< 0.01). Bilateral ES and ipsilateral BF and ST muscle activities 
were significantly reduced with PHEAS, compared to PHE and PHEA (p< 0.01). 
Anterior pelvic tilting and rotation angles were significantly reduced with 
PHEAS, compared to PHE and PHEA (p< 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: PHEAS is recommended to selectively strengthen GM muscles with 
minimal BF and ST muscle activities and pelvic compensation in individuals with 
iliopsoas shortness. The abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM) after iliopsoas 
stretching is more efficient than ADIM alone during PHE, especially in 
individuals with iliopsoas shortness.
