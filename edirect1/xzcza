BACKGROUND: Few real-world series on the efficacy and safety of anti-programmed 
cell death protein-1(PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1(PD-L1)-based therapy are 
available in molecularly unselected patients with poor performance status (PS) 
and specific types of advanced cancers, because such populations are typically 
excluded from clinical trials due to poor life expectancy and risk of toxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multicenter retrospective case series included 
patients with microsatellite instability (MSI)-high metastatic cancers with 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of 2 or 3 not related to 
comorbidities receiving anti-PD-1 with or without anti-CTLA-4 therapy after 
failure of at least one prior treatment line.
RESULTS: We included 27 patients with six diverse tumor types: colorectal (n 
= 18), gastric (n = 5), biliary tract, pancreatic, small bowel, and endometrial 
cancers (n = 1 each). Baseline ECOG PS was 2 (74%) or 3 (26%). Overall response 
rate was 33%, with six partial and three complete responses. Median time to 
response was 3.1, months and median duration of response was 16.9 months. Median 
progression-free survival was 3.4 months (95% CI: 2.3 to not evaluable), and 
18-month overall survival was 50.8% (95% confidence interval, 32.7-78.8). 
Baseline variables were not associated with survival outcomes. ECOG PS 1 was 
reached by 52% of patients in a median time of 6 weeks, and ECOG PS 0 was 
reached by 30% of patients in a median time of 10 weeks.
CONCLUSION: In a high proportion of patients with MSI-high cancers and poor 
performance status related to end-stage disease, salvage immunotherapy can 
induce potentially long-lasting "Lazarus responses". Immunotherapy decisions 
near the end-of-life should be carefully integrated with predictive biomarkers 
and with palliative care measures in the real-world setting.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In this retrospective cohort study of 27 pretreated 
patients with microsatellite instability (MSI)-high cancers and Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or 3 not related to 
comorbidities, PD-1/PD-L1-based therapy induced a RECIST response in 33% of 
patients, with a median duration of 16.9 months, and an improvement of 
performance status in 52% of patients. MSI-high status can be used in clinical 
practice as a tumor-agnostic predictive biomarker to select critically ill 
patients with end-stage cancers for salvage immunotherapy.

Long-term safety and efficacy data of extended half-life factor IX (FIX) 
prophylaxis in children with hemophilia B (HB) are sparse. paradigm 5 is a 
multinational, open-label, single-arm, phase III trial assessing once-weekly 
(40 IU/kg) prophylactic nonacog beta pegol (N9-GP) in previously treated 
patients (PTPs) aged ≤ 12 years with HB (FIX activity ≤ 2%). Primary endpoint: 
incidence of anti-FIX inhibitory antibodies (≥ 0.6 Bethesda Units). We present a 
5-year analysis (N = 25, including remaining patients with ≥ 5 years' follow-up) 
and compare with a 1-year analysis (≥ 52 weeks' exposure). The main phase 
enrolled 25 children; 22 entered the extension phase; 17 remained in trial at 
data cutoff. Median treatment period: 5.6 years/patient; median total number of 
N9-GP exposure days: 290.0/patient. No patients developed anti-FIX inhibitory 
antibodies. No other safety concerns, including thromboembolic events, were 
reported. Neurological examinations have not revealed any new abnormal findings. 
Sixteen (64.0%) patients remained free from spontaneous bleeds; all bleeds were 
mild/moderate in severity; 93.0% were controlled with 1 to 2 N9-GP injections. 
No intracranial hemorrhages were reported. Annualized bleeding rates (ABRs) were 
very low at 5 years (median/Poisson-estimated mean overall ABR: 0.66/0.99), 
having decreased from the 1-year analysis (1.00/1.44). Median/Poisson-estimated 
mean spontaneous ABRs for the 1- and 5-year analyses: 0.00/0.45 and 0.00/0.33. 
Mean FIX trough activity at 5 years: 17.9%. Mean polyethylene glycol plasma 
concentration reached steady state at 6 months, increasing slightly over time, 
in line with increased FIX trough activity. N9-GP administered for ≥ 5 years 
shows favorable long-term safety and efficacy in PTPs with HB (FIX activity ≤ 
2%).

Processing tomato is the second most important worldwide cash crop, generally 
produced in high-input systems. However, fruit yield and quality are affected by 
agronomic management, particularly nitrogen (N) fertilization, whose application 
to indeterminate growth genotypes for canning has yet to be investigated in 
depth. Hence, the objective of this work was to assess the effects of different 
N rates (0, 50, 125, 200, 275, and 350 kg ha-1) on fruit yield and quality 
characteristics of processing tomato 'San Marzano' landrace. The results of our 
study showed that 125 and 200 kg of N ha-1 are the most appropriate rates in 
soil with high fertility, ensuring the highest values of marketable yield and 
brix yield. However, plants fertilized with 125 kg of N ha-1 attained higher 
values of N efficiency and fruit K and P concentrations than plants fertilized 
with 200 kg of N ha-1. Our results suggest that overdoses of N supplies 
negatively affected fruit yield and quality of San Marzano landrace grown in 
high soil fertility conditions, also reducing the agricultural sustainability. 
Hence, specific agronomic protocol and extension services are required to 
optimally manage tomato crop systems.

Evidence shows that ageism negatively impacts the health of older adults. 
However, estimates of its prevalence are lacking. This study aimed to estimate 
the global prevalence of ageism towards older adults and to explore possible 
explanatory factors. Data were included from 57 countries that took part in Wave 
6 of the World Values Survey. Multilevel Latent Class Analysis was performed to 
identify distinct classes of individuals and countries. Individuals were 
classified as having high, moderate or low ageist attitudes; and countries as 
being highly, moderately or minimally ageist, by aggregating individual 
responses. Individual-level (age, sex, education and wealth) and 
contextual-level factors (healthy life expectancy, population health status and 
proportion of the population aged over 60 years) were examined as potential 
explanatory factors in multinomial logistic regression. From the 83,034 
participants included, 44%, 32% and 24% were classified as having low, moderate 
and high ageist attitudes, respectively. From the 57 countries, 34 were 
classified as moderately or highly ageist. The likelihood of an individual or a 
country being ageist was significantly reduced by increases in healthy life 
expectancy and the proportion of older people within a country. Certain personal 
characteristics-younger age, being male and having lower education-were 
significantly associated with an increased probability of an individual having 
high ageist attitudes. At least one in every two people included in this study 
had moderate or high ageist attitudes. Despite the issue's magnitude and 
negative health impacts, ageism remains a neglected global health issue.

New Edible Packaging Material with Function in Shelf Life Extension: 
Applications for the Meat and Cheese Industries.

Nowadays, biopolymer films have gained notoriety among the packaging materials. 
Some studies clearly test their effectiveness for certain periods of time, with 
applicability in the food industry. This research has been carried out in two 
directions. Firstly, the development and testing of the new edible material: 
general appearance, thickness, retraction ratio, color, transmittance, 
microstructure, roughness, and porosity, as well as mechanical and solubility 
tests. Secondly, testing of the packaged products-slices of cheese and 
prosciutto-in the new material and their maintenance at refrigeration conditions 
for 5 months; thus, the peroxide index, color, and water activity index were 
evaluated for the packaged products. The results emphasize that the packaging is 
a lipophilic one and does not allow wetting or any changes in the food moisture. 
The results indicate the stability of the parameters within three months and 
present the changes occurring within the fourth and fifth months. 
Microbiological tests indicated an initial microbial growth, both for cheese 
slices and ham slices. Time testing indicated a small increase in the total 
count number over the 5-month period: 23 cfu/g were found of fresh slices of 
prosciutto and 27 cfu/g in the case of the packaged ones; for slices of cheese, 
the total count of microorganisms indicated 7 cfu/g in the initial stage and 11 
cfu/g after 5 months. The results indicate that the film did not facilitate the 
growth of the existing microorganisms, and highlight the need to purchase food 
from safe places, especially in the case of raw-dried products that have not 
undergone heat treatment, which may endanger the health of the consumer. The new 
material tested represents a promising substitute for commercial and 
unsustainable plastic packaging.

Several minimally invasive surgical procedures have been recently developed to 
treat hemorrhoids without any excision. About 25 years ago, a non-excisional 
procedure providing doppler- guided ligation of the hemorrhoidal arteries has 
been proposed - named "hemorrhoidal dearterialization". The original technique 
has been modified over the years, and indications were expanded. In particular, 
a plication of the redundant and prolapsing mucosa/submucosa of the rectum 
(named "mucopexy") has been introduced to treat hemorrhoidal prolapse, without 
excision of the hemorrhoidal piles. At present, the THD® Doppler procedure is 
one of the most used techniques to treat hemorrhoids. Aim of this technique is 
to realize a target dearterialization, using a Doppler probe with the final 
purpose to reduce the arterial overflow to the hemorrhoidal piles. In the case 
of associated hemorrhoidal prolapse, a mucopexy is performed together with 
Doppler-guided dearterialization. The entity and circumferential extension of 
the hemorrhoidal prolapse guide the mucopexy, which can be considered tailored 
to a single patient; the dearterialization should be considered mandatory. 
Advantages of this surgical technique are the absence of serious and 
life-threatening postoperative events, chronic complications, and limited 
recurrence risks. The impact of the procedure on the anorectal physiology is 
negligible. However, careful postoperative management is mandatory to avoid 
complications and to guarantee an improved long-term outcome. Therefore, regular 
physiologic bowel movements, excessive strain at the defecation and strong 
physical activity are advisable.

Disability-free life expectancy at old ages in Egypt.

Metwally S(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Demography and Biostatistics, Faculty of Graduate Studies for 
Statistical Research#, Cairo University, Egypt.

This study aimed to estimate among the older population in Egypt (aged 60 years 
and over): 1) disability prevalence rates, their levels of severity and the 
common types and 2) disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) by sex, age and 
disability type. Data were from the nationally representative 2016 Household 
Observatory Survey (HOS-2016), with 4658 persons aged 60+ constituting the study 
sample population. To identify individuals with disabilities, the HOS asked 
respondents a short set of questions on functional difficulties, as suggested by 
the United Nations Washington Group on Disability Statistics. The DFLE was 
estimated using the Sullivan method. Older (60+) women reported a higher 
prevalence of disability than older men. Women had longer DFLEs and longer 
disabled life expectancies (DLEs) than men but had lower proportions of DFLE to 
their total lifetime. The findings suggest that, at age 60, around 30% of life 
expectancy in Egypt can be expected to be with limitations in mobility and 
vision. Men, although they live for fewer years than women, can expect to have a 
greater proportion of their life expectancy free of disability. The findings of 
the study suggest that the contextual differences in how the process of ageing 
is experienced need to be considered by decision-makers when designing 
gender-responsive health policies.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the last 3 years and for the first time in 60 years, 
life expectancy in the United States has declined across all racial groups 
primarily because of drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, and suicide. A public health 
response to the opioid crisis must expand its focus to more broadly include 
children, adolescents, and young adults while increasing efforts toward 
preventing new cases of opioid addiction, early identification of individuals 
with opioid-abuse disorder, and ensuring access to effective opioid addiction 
treatment, while simultaneously continuing to safely meet the needs of patients 
experiencing pain.
RECENT FINDINGS: Although a multimodal approach to pain management is 
fundamental in current practice, opioids remain an essential building block in 
the management of acute and chronic pain and have been for over 5000 years as 
they work. Left over, unconsumed opioids that were appropriately prescribed for 
pain have become the gateway for the development of opioid use disorder, 
particularly in the vulnerable adolescents and young adult patient populations. 
How to reduce the amount of opioids dispensed, improve methods of disposal in an 
environmentally safe way, and proactively make naloxone, particularly nasal 
spray, readily available to patients (and their families) receiving prescription 
opioids or who are at risk of opioid use disorder are highlighted in this 
review.
SUMMARY: We describe the historical use of opioids and the scope of the current 
opioid crisis, review the differences between dependence and addiction, and the 
private and public sectors response to pain management and highlight the issue 
of adolescent vulnerability. We conclude with a proposal for future directions 
that address both public and patient health needs.

BACKGROUND: Although HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) increase the 
risk for hypertension in people living with HIV (PLHIV), the global and regional 
burden of hypertension in PLHIV is not well characterized.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched multiple 
databases for studies reporting on hypertension in PLHIV and conducted between 
2007 and 2018. Meta-analysis through random-effect models served to obtain the 
pooled prevalence estimates. Heterogeneity was assessed via the χ test on 
Cochran's Q statistic.
RESULTS: We included 194 studies (396 776 PLHIV from 61 countries). The global 
prevalence of hypertension was 23.6% [95% confidence interval (95% CI: 
21.6-25.5)] with substantial heterogeneity. The regional distribution was 
Western and Central Europe and North America [28.1% (95% CI: 24.5-31.9)], West 
and Central Africa [23.5% (16.6-31.0)], Latin America and the Caribbean [22.0% 
(17.8-26.5)], Eastern and Southern Africa [19.9% (17.2-22.8)], and Asia and 
Pacific [16.5% (12.5-21.0)]; P = 0.0007. No study originated from the Middle 
East and North Africa, and Eastern Europe and Central Asia regions. The 
prevalence was higher in high-income countries than others (P = 0.0003) and 
higher in PLHIV taking ART than those ART-naive (P = 0.0003). The prevalence 
increased over time (mainly driven by Eastern and Southern Africa) and with age. 
There was no difference between men and women. We estimated that in 2018, there 
were 8.9 (95% CI: 8.3-9.6) million cases of hypertension in PLHIV globally, 
among whom 59.2% were living in Sub-Saharan Africa.
CONCLUSION: Cost-effective strategies to curb the dreadful burden of 
hypertension among PLHIV are needed.

Chapitre 9. Oncofertilité et jeunes filles prépubères : Un « droit à un avenir 
ouvert » ?

[Article in French]

Affdal AO, Ravitsky V.

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have increased the life expectancy of cancer 
patients but may cause premature ovarian failure and irreversible loss of 
fertility. In the context of childhood cancers, it is now acknowledged that 
possible negative effects of treatment on future reproductive autonomy are a 
major concern. While a few options are open to patients post-puberty, the only 
option currently open to prepubescent girls is cryopreservation of ovarian 
tissue and subsequent transplantation. Yet, this procedure raises ethical 
concerns related to its experimental nature and to risks involved in surgery and 
general anesthesia. In addition, the risk of malignant cells being reintroduced 
in the future following autologous transplantation of the ovarian tissue is 
still poorly evaluated. A number of ethical issues arise surrounding this 
procedure. While the girl's future reproductive autonomy is at stake, it is 
important to also consider risks associated with the procedure. Fertility 
preservation through cryopreservation of ovarian tissue thus raises a conflict 
between the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence. We argue that the 
ethical complexity surrounding fertility preservation for prepubescent girls 
should be resolved by applying the principle of "the child's right to an open 
future". We propose to consider 'beneficence' through the lens of the 
reproductive autonomy and her potentialin becoming a genetic parent.

To identify the optimal cost-effective strategy for cervical cancer screening 
program in Thailand by comparing the different algorithms which based on the use 
of primary human papilloma virus (HPV) assay. We use a Microsoft Excel-based 
spreadsheet to calculate the accumulated cases of preinvasive and invasive 
cervical cancer and the budget impact of each screening program. The model was 
developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of 3 screening strategies: pooled 
HPV test with reflex liquid-based cytology triage, HPV genotyping with reflex 
p16/ki67 dual stain cytology, and pooled HPV test with dual stain. The main 
outcomes were the total cost, incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Strategy entailing primary 
HPV genotyping and reflex dual stain cytology is the least costly strategy 
(total cost US$37 893 407) and provides the similar QALY gained compared to 
pooled high-risk HPV testing with reflex dual stain (Average QALY 24.03). Pooled 
HPV test with reflex dual staining is more costly compared to strategy without 
reflex dual staining. The ICER was US$353.40 per QALY gained. One-way 
sensitivity analysis showed that the model is sensitive to the cost of dual 
stain and the cost of cancer treatment. Decreasing the incidence of cervical 
cancer case and increasing the QALYs can be successful by using dual stain 
cytology as the triage test for pooled HPV test or HPV genotyping. The result of 
our analysis favors the use of HPV genotyping with the reflex dual stain as it 
offers the most QALY at the lowest cost.

BACKGROUND: Across international contexts, people with serious mental illnesses 
(SMI) experience marked reductions in life expectancy at birth. The intersection 
of ethnicity and social deprivation on life expectancy in SMI is unclear. The 
aim of this study was to assess the impact of ethnicity and area-level 
deprivation on life expectancy at birth in SMI, defined as 
schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, bipolar disorders and depression, using data 
from London, UK.
METHODS: Abridged life tables to calculate life expectancy at birth, in a cohort 
with clinician-ascribed ICD-10 schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, bipolar 
disorders or depression, managed in secondary mental healthcare. Life expectancy 
in the study population with SMI was compared with life expectancy in the 
general population and with those residing in the most deprived areas in 
England.
RESULTS: Irrespective of ethnicity, people with SMI experienced marked 
reductions in life expectancy at birth compared with the general population; 
from 14.5 years loss in men with schizophrenia-spectrum and bipolar disorders, 
to 13.2 years in women. Similar reductions were noted for people with 
depression. Across all diagnoses, life expectancy at birth in people with SMI 
was lower than the general population residing in the most deprived areas in 
England.
CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of ethnicity, reductions in life expectancy at birth 
among people with SMI are worse than the general population residing in the most 
deprived areas in England. This trend in people with SMI is similar to groups 
who experience extreme social exclusion and marginalisation. Evidence-based 
interventions to tackle this mortality gap need to take this into account.

Tafenoquine has been licensed for the single-dose radical cure of Plasmodium 
vivax in adults; however, it is only recommended in patients with > 70% of 
normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity. Because this may 
hinder widespread use, we investigated sex-based treatment strategies in which 
all adult patients are tested with a qualitative G6PD rapid diagnostic test 
(RDT). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase normal males are prescribed tafenoquine 
in all three strategies, whereas G6PD normal females are prescribed either a 
low-dose 14-day primaquine regimen (PQ14, total dose 3.5 mg/kg) or a high-dose 
7-day primaquine regimen (PQ7, total dose 7 mg/kg), or referred to a healthcare 
facility for quantitative G6PD testing before prescribing tafenoquine. Patients 
testing G6PD deficient are prescribed a weekly course of primaquine for 8 weeks. 
We compared the cost-effectiveness of these three strategies to usual care in 
four countries using a decision tree model. Usual care in Ethiopia does not 
include radical cure, whereas Afghanistan, Indonesia, and Vietnam prescribe PQ14 
without G6PD screening. The cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) 
averted was expressed through incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). 
Compared with usual care, the ICERs for a sex-based treatment strategy with PQ7 
for females from a healthcare provider perspective were $127 per DALY averted in 
Vietnam, $466 in Ethiopia, $1,089 in Afghanistan, and $4,443 in Indonesia. The 
PQ14 and referral options cost more while averting fewer DALYs than PQ7. This 
study provides an alternative cost-effective mode of rolling out tafenoquine in 
areas where initial testing with only a G6PD RDT is feasible.

In the present study, arginine deaminase (ADI) was purified from Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa PS2 which showed relative molecular mass of 70 ± 3 kDa on native-PAGE 
and 36 ± 0.5 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Purified ADI exhibited optimum activity at pH 6.5 
and temperature 40 ºC. Metal ions, K+ and Mg2+ had positive, while Mn2+, Cr2+, 
Co2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Cd2+ and Hg2+ had negative effects on catalytic activity 
of ADI. Purified enzyme showed high substrate specificity towards natural 
substrate L-arginine and did not hydrolyse its structural analogues. In-vitro 
serum half-life of purified ADI was 40 h, whereas proteolytic half-life was 28, 
27, and 32 min against trypsin, elastase-I and proteinase-K, respectively. 
Anticancer activity of ADI has been evaluated against panel of human cancer cell 
lines (LS-180, HCT-116, MCF-7, BT-549, T47D, HL-60, MOLT-4, K-562, and PC-3) but 
lowest IC50 1.2 IU ml-1 was recorded with MCF-7 cells. Colony forming assay, 
wound-healing migration assay, phase contrast microscopy, DAPI staining, cell 
cycle analysis and DNA laddering assay revealed that ADI treatment induced 
apoptotic cell death in dose dependent manner. Increased level of MMP loss, ROS 
generation and decreased level of SOD, CAT, GPx and GSH displayed ADI treatment 
induced mitochondrial dysfunctioning. Furthermore, purified ADI had no 
substantial toxicity against human normal cell lines and blood erythrocytes. 
These findings suggesting that purified ADI could be developed as an anticancer 
agent but more in depth studies are warranted.

Cachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome that determines a severe body weight 
loss characterized by a marked reduction in muscle mass. About 80% of patients 
with advanced cancer develop cachexia due to both the tumor itself and cancer 
treatment (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy), which is associated to a worse 
prognosis. Despite its clinical relevance, this syndrome is still 
under-diagnosed and it lacks effective treatments. Radio-chemotherapy treatment 
is essential in patients with advanced head and neck cancers (HNSCC). Although 
this treatment has improved patients' life expectancy, it has also dramatically 
increased their need for assistance and support. The management of adverse 
symptoms, including cachexia, is of great importance in order to avoid delays in 
therapy, reduction of dosages and hospitalizations. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small 
non-coding RNA molecules, which have emerged as powerful biomarkers in 
stratifying human cancers. Due to their high stability in body fluids, miRNAs 
might be excellent non-invasive biomarkers for the early detection and follow-up 
of cancer patients. Here, we will summarize the current knowledge and debate the 
strong need to identify circulating biomarkers for the early diagnosis of 
cachexia. We will propose circulating non-coding RNAs as biomarkers for 
detecting early cachexia and implementing specific treatment. We will also 
discuss the potential use of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers of cachexia in 
HNSCC patients' blood samples collected before and after radio-chemotherapy 
treatment. Our intent is to pave the way to the identification of specific 
circulating miRNAs associated to cachexia occurrence and to the design of 
specific interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of cancer 
patients.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to impact older adults 
disproportionately, from severe illness and hospitalization to increased 
mortality risk. Concurrently, concerns about potential shortages of healthcare 
professionals and health supplies to address these needs have focused attention 
on how resources are ultimately allocated and used. Some strategies misguidedly 
use age as an arbitrary criterion, inappropriately disfavoring older adults. 
This statement represents the official policy position of the American 
Geriatrics Society (AGS). It is intended to inform stakeholders including 
hospitals, health systems, and policymakers about ethical considerations to 
consider when developing strategies for allocating scarce resources during an 
emergency involving older adults. Members of the AGS Ethics Committee 
collaborated with interprofessional experts in ethics, law, nursing, and 
medicine (including geriatrics, palliative care, emergency medicine, and 
pulmonology/critical care) to conduct a structured literature review and examine 
relevant reports. The resulting recommendations defend a particular view of 
distributive justice that maximizes relevant clinical factors and deemphasizes 
or eliminates factors placing arbitrary, disproportionate weight on advanced 
age. The AGS positions include (1) avoiding age per se as a means for excluding 
anyone from care; (2) assessing comorbidities and considering the disparate 
impact of social determinants of health; (3) encouraging decision makers to 
focus primarily on potential short-term (not long-term) outcomes; (4) avoiding 
ancillary criteria such as "life-years saved" and "long-term predicted life 
expectancy" that might disadvantage older people; (5) forming and staffing 
triage committees tasked with allocating scarce resources; (6) developing 
institutional resource allocation strategies that are transparent and applied 
uniformly; and (7) facilitating appropriate advance care planning. The statement 
includes recommendations that should be immediately implemented to address 
resource allocation strategies during COVID-19, aligning with AGS positions. The 
statement also includes recommendations for post-pandemic review. Such review 
would support revised strategies to ensure that governments and institutions 
have equitable emergency resource allocation strategies, avoid future 
discriminatory language and practice, and have appropriate guidance to develop 
national frameworks for emergent resource allocation decisions. J Am Geriatr Soc

PURPOSE: Patients with advanced cancer often have a poor understanding of cancer 
incurability, which correlates with more aggressive treatment near the end of 
life (EOL). We sought to determine whether training oncologists to elicit 
patient values for goals-of-care (GoC) discussions will increase and improve 
these discussions. We explored its impact on use of aggressive care at EOL.
METHODS: We enrolled and used block randomization to assign 92% of solid tumor 
oncologists to 2-hour communication skills training and four coaching sessions. 
We surveyed 265 patient with newly diagnosed advanced cancer with < 2-year life 
expectancy at baseline and 6 months. We assessed prevalence and quality of GoC 
communication, change in communication skills, and use of aggressive care in the 
last month of life.
RESULTS: Intervention (INT) oncologists' (n = 11) skill to elicit patient values 
increased (27%-55%), while usual care (UC) oncologists' (n = 11) skill did not 
(9%-0%; P = .01). Forty-eight percent (n = 74) INT v 51% (n = 56) UC patients 
reported a GoC discussion (P = .61). There was no difference in the prevalence 
or quality of GoC communication between groups (global odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 
0.57 to 1.23). Within 6 months, there was no difference in deaths (18 INT v 16 
UC; P = .51), mean hospitalizations (0.47 INT v 0.42 UC; P = .63), intensive 
care unit admissions (5% INT v 9% UC; P = .65), or chemotherapy (26% INT v 16% 
UC; P = .39).
CONCLUSION: Use of a coaching model focused on teaching oncologists to elicit 
patient values improved that skill but did not increase prevalence or quality of 
GoC discussions among patients with advanced cancer. There was no impact on high 
care utilization at EOL.

A novel mechanism for extending the circulatory half-life of coagulation factor 
VIII (FVIII) has been established and evaluated preclinically. The FVIII binding 
domain of von Willebrand factor (D'D3) fused to human albumin (rD'D3-FP) dose 
dependently improved pharmacokinetics parameters of coadministered FVIII in all 
animal species tested, from mouse to cynomolgus monkey, after IV injection. At 
higher doses, the half-life of recombinant FVIII (rVIII-SingleChain) was 
calculated to be increased 2.6-fold to fivefold compared with rVIII-SingleChain 
administered alone in rats, rabbits, and cynomolgus monkeys, and it was 
increased 3.1-fold to 9.1-fold in mice. Sustained pharmacodynamics effects were 
observed (ie, activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin generation 
measured ex vivo). No increased risk of thrombosis was observed with 
coadministration of rVIII-SingleChain and rD'D3-FP compared with 
rVIII-SingleChain alone. At concentrations beyond the anticipated therapeutic 
range, rD'D3-FP reduced the hemostatic efficacy of coadministered 
rVIII-SingleChain. This finding might be due to scavenging of activated FVIII by 
the excessive amount of rD'D3-FP which, in turn, might result in a reduced 
probability of the formation of the tenase complex. This observation underlines 
the importance of a fine-tuned balance between FVIII and its binding partner, 
von Willebrand factor, for hemostasis in general.

Increased life expectancy exposes a great number of elderly people to serious 
accidents, thus increasing the amount of major geriatric trauma cases. The aim 
of our study was to determine the profile of elderly patients undergoing major 
trauma, and the contributing factors predicting mortality in this specific 
patient group, compared to the younger population. Retrospective analysis of 
1051 patients with major trauma admitted over ten years in a Level-1 trauma 
center was performed. Data collected were: history, nature and type of trauma; 
age and sex; vital signs on admission; injury severity score; shock index; 
comorbidities; coagulation diathesis; injury patterns; emergency measures taken; 
main diagnosis; mortality; and length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) 
stay. Geriatric patients admitted for major trauma have a mortality rate almost 
four times greater (47%) than their younger counterparts (14%) with the same 
ISS. According to statistical regression analysis, anti-platelet therapy (OR 
3.21), NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) score (OR 2.23), GCS 
(OR 0.83), ISS (OR 1.07) and age (OR 1.06) are the main factors predicting 
mortality. Conclusion: Geriatric major trauma patients admitted to our trauma 
resuscitation area have a high mortality rate. Age, GCS, ISS and NACA scores as 
well as anti-platelet therapy are the main factors predicting mortality.

Employed persons caring simultaneously for children and care-dependent relatives

higher life expectancy, later childbirth, and an increasing number of working
