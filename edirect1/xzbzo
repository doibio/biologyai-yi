OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the cost effectiveness of early cardiac 
resynchronization therapy (CRT) implantation among patients with mild heart 
failure (HF). The differential cost effectiveness between CRT using a 
defibrillator (CRT-Ds) and CRT using a pacemaker (CRT-P) was also assessed.
BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization has been shown to be cost effective in New 
York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes III/IV but is less studied in 
class II HF. The incremental costs of early CRT implementation in mild 
HF compared with the costs potentially avoided because of delaying disease 
progression to advanced HF are also unknown. Finally, combined biventricular 
pacing and defibrillator (CRT-D) devices are more expensive than biventricular 
pacemakers (CRT-P), but the relative cost effectiveness is controversial.
METHODS: Data from the 5-year follow-up phase of REVERSE (REsynchronization 
reVErses Remodeling in Systolic Left vEntricular Dysfunction) were used. The 
economics were evaluated from the U.S. Medicare perspective based on published 
clinical projections.
RESULTS: Probabilistic estimates yielded $8,840/quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained (95% confidence interval [CI]: $6,705 to $10,804/QALY gained) for 
CRT-ON versus CRT-OFF (i.e., programmed "ON" or "OFF" at pre-specified 
post-implantation timings) and $43,678/QALY gained for CRT-D versus CRT-P (95% 
CI: $35,164 to $53,589/QALY gained) over the patient's lifetime. Results were 
robust to choice of patient subgroup and alterations of ±10% to key model 
parameters. An "early" CRT-D class II strategy totaled $95,292 compared with 
$91,511 for a "late" implantation. An "early" implant offered on average 1.00 
year of additional survival for $3,781, resulting in an ICER of $3,795/LY 
gained.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates CRT cost effectiveness in mild HF. The 
incremental CRT-D costs are justified by the anticipated benefits, despite 
increased procurement costs and shorter generator longevities. "Early" CRT-D 
implants have essential cost parity with "late" implants while increasing the 
patient's survival. (REsynchronization reVErses Remodeling in Systolic Left 
vEntricular Dysfunction [REVERSE]; NCT00271154).

Polymer-clay based nanocomposites are among the attractive materials to be 
applied for various applications, including biomedical. The incorporation of the 
nano sized clay (nanoclay) into polymer matrices can result in their remarkable 
improvement in mechanical, thermal and barrier properties as long as the 
nanofillers are well exfoliated and dispersed throughout the matrix. In this 
work, exfoliation strategy through pre-dispersing process of the organically 
modified montmorillonite (organo-MMT) nanofiller was done to obtain ethyl vinyl 
acetate (EVA) nanocomposite with improved flexibility, toughness, thermal 
stability and biostability. Our results indicated that the degree of organo-MMT 
exfoliation affects its cytotoxicity level and the properties of the resulting 
EVA nanocomposite. The pre-dispersed organo-MMT by ultrasonication in water 
possesses higher degree of exfoliation as compared to its origin condition and 
significantly performed reduced cytotoxicity level. Beneficially, this 
nanofiller also enhanced the EVA flexibility, thermal stability and biostability 
upon the in vitro exposure. We postulated that these were due to plasticizing 
effect and enhanced EVA-nanofiller interactions contributing to more stable 
chemical bonds in the main copolymer chains. Improvement in copolymer 
flexibility is beneficial for close contact with human soft tissue, while 
enhancement in toughness and biostability is crucial to extend its life 
expectancy as insulation material for implantable device.

BACKGROUND: Advancements in research and clinical care have considerably 
extended the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, with 
this extended survival come comorbidities. One of the leading co-morbidities is 
CF-related bone disease (CFBD), which progresses with disease severity and 
places patients at high risk for fractures, particularly of the ribs and 
vertebrae. Evidence that CF patients with vertebral fractures had higher bone 
mineral density (BMD) than the nonfracture group led us to postulate that bone 
quality is impaired in these patients. We therefore examined rib specimens 
resected at the time of lung transplant in CF patients to measure parameters of 
bone quantity and quality.
METHODS: In this exploratory study, we analysed 19 end-stage CF and 13 control 
rib specimens resected from otherwise healthy lung donors. BMD, bone 
microarchitecture, static parameters of bone formation and resorption and 
microcrack density of rib specimens were quantified by imaging, 
histomorphometric and histological methods. Variables reflecting the 
mineralization of ribs were assessed by digitized microradiography. The degree 
of bone mineralization (g/cm3) and the heterogeneity index of the mineralization 
(g/cm3) were calculated for trabecular and cortical bone.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, CF ribs exhibited lower areal and trabecular 
volumetric BMD, decreased trabecular thickness and osteoid parameters, and 
increased microcrack density, that was particularly pronounced in specimens from 
patients with CF-related diabetes. Static parameters of bone resorption were 
similar in both groups. Degree of mineralization of total bone, but not 
heterogeneity index, was increased in CF specimens.
CONCLUSION: The combination of reduced bone mass, altered microarchitecture, 
imbalanced bone remodeling (maintained bone resorption but decreased formation), 
increased microdamage and a small increase of the degree of mineralization, may 
lead to decreased bone strength, which, when coupled with chronic coughing and 
chest physical therapy, may provide an explanation for the increased incidence 
of rib fractures previously reported in this population.

BACKGROUND: Total hip replacement (THR) is the gold standard treatment for 
severe hip osteoarthritis. Effectiveness of physical rehabilitation for THR 
patients following discharge from hospital is supported by evidence; however, 
barriers such as geographical location and transport can limit access to 
appropriate health care. One solution to this issue is using an alternative 
model of care using telerehabilitation technology to deliver rehabilitation 
programs directly into patients' homes. A telerehabilitation model may also have 
potential health care cost savings for health care providers.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine if a telerehabilitation model of care 
delivered remotely is as effective as face-to-face rehabilitation in the THR 
population and cost effective for health care providers and patients.
METHODS: A total of 70 people undergoing THR will be recruited to participate in 
a randomized, single-blind, controlled noninferiority clinical trial. The trial 
will compare a technology-based THR rehabilitation program to in-person care. On 
discharge from hospital, participants randomized to the in-person group will 
receive usual care, defined as a paper home exercise program (HEP) targeting 
strengthening exercises for quadriceps, hip abductors, extensors, and flexors; 
they will be advised to perform their HEP 3 times per day. At 2, 4, and 6 weeks 
postoperatively, they will receive a 30-minute in-person physiotherapy session 
with a focus on gait retraining and reviewing and progressing their HEP. The 
telerehabilitation protocol will involve a program similar in content to the 
in-person rehabilitation program, except delivery will be directly into the 
homes of the participants via telerehabilitation technology on an iPad. Outcomes 
will be evaluated preoperatively, day of discharge from in-patient 
physiotherapy, 6 weeks and 6 months postoperatively. The primary outcome will be 
the quality of life subscale of the hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome 
score, measured at 6 weeks. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses as 
recommended in the extension of the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials 
(CONSORT) guideline for noninferiority trials will be performed.
RESULTS: Recruitment commenced in September 2015 and is expected to be completed 
by June 2017. Data collection will be completed by December 2017. It is 
anticipated the results from this trial will be published by July 2018.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous research investigating telerehabilitation in postoperative 
orthopedic conditions has yielded promising results. If shown to be as effective 
as in-person care, telerehabilitation after THR could be helpful in addressing 
access issues in this population. Furthermore, it may help reduce the cost of 
health care provision by enabling patients to take a more independent approach 
to their rehabilitation.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains a leading cause of 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in children and young adults in 
disadvantaged populations. The emergence of echocardiographic screening provides 
the opportunity for early disease detection and intervention. Using our own 
multistate model of RHD progression derived from Australian RHD register data, 
we performed a cost-utility analysis of echocardiographic screening in 
indigenous Australian children, with the dual aims of informing policy decisions 
in Australia and providing a model that could be adapted in other countries.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We simulated the outcomes of 2 screening strategies, 
assuming that RHD could be detected 1, 2, or 3 years earlier by screening. 
Outcomes included reductions in heart failure, surgery, mortality, 
disability-adjusted life-years, and corresponding costs. Only a strategy of 
screening all indigenous 5- to 12-year-olds in half of their communities in 
alternate years was found to be cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio less than AU$50 000 per disability-adjusted life-year averted), assuming 
that RHD can be detected at least 2 years earlier by screening; however, this 
result was sensitive to a number of assumptions. Additional modeling of improved 
adherence to secondary prophylaxis alone resulted in dramatic reductions in 
heart failure, surgery, and death; these outcomes improved even further when 
combined with screening.
CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiographic screening for RHD is cost-effective in our 
context, assuming that RHD can be detected ≥2 years earlier by screening. Our 
model can be adapted to any other setting but will require local data or 
acceptable assumptions for model parameters.

OBJECTIVE: Black men are more prone to harbor prostate cancer. They are more 
likely to succumb to this tumor than their White counterparts and may benefit 
from early detection and treatment. In this study, we assess the nationwide and 
regional disparity in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate 
cancer between Black men and non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs).
METHODS: A total of 247,079 (weighted 55,185,102) men, aged 40 to 99 years, who 
responded to the 2012 and 2014 behavioral risk factor surveillance system 
surveys were used for our analysis. End points consisted of self-reported PSA 
screening and self-reported nonrecommended PSA screening within 12 months of the 
interview. The latter was defined as screening in men with <10-year life 
expectancy. Available sociodemographic variables were used to predict these end 
points. The independent predictors from multivariate models were used to 
calculate the adjusted prevalence of PSA screening and nonrecommended PSA 
screening on a nationwide and regional level. These numbers were calculated for 
Blacks and NHWs separately and were compared between the 2 groups.
RESULTS: Prevalence of PSA screening was 30.7% in NHWs vs. 28.1% in Blacks 
(P<0.001). On a region-based analysis, New England, Middle Atlantic, South 
Atlantic, East North Central, East South Central, West South Central, and 
Mountain showed a significantly higher rate of PSA screening in NHWs as compared 
to Blacks (all P<0.001). Middle Atlantic had a significantly higher prevalence 
of nonrecommended screening in NHWs as compared to Blacks, whereas South 
Atlantic, West South Central, and Pacific had a significantly higher prevalence 
of nonrecommended screening in Blacks as compared to NHWs (all P<0.001). 
Overall, 43 states performed screening more frequently to NHWs, whereas only 8 
states performed it more frequently to Black men. The nonrecommended screening 
was performed more frequently to NHWs in 19 states, whereas 24 states performed 
it more frequently to Black men.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that on a regional-level (and state-level), 
there are significant racial differences in overall and nonrecommended PSA 
screening across the United States. Further research is necessary to identify 
the reasons for the differences and help overcoming it.

The risk and clinical significance of cardiac iron overload due to chronic 
transfusion varies with the underlying disease. Cardiac iron overload shortens 
the life expectancy of patients with thalassemia, whereas its effect is unclear 
in those with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In patients with sickle cell 
anemia (SCA), iron does not seem to deposit quickly in the heart. Our primary 
objective was to assess through a multicentric study the prevalence of cardiac 
iron overload, defined as a cardiovascular magnetic resonance T2*<20 ms, in 
patients with thalassemia, SCA, or MDS. Patient inclusion criteria were an 
accurate record of erythrocyte concentrates (ECs) received, a transfusion 
history >8 ECs in the past year, and age older than 6 years. We included from 9 
centers 20 patients with thalassemia, 41 with SCA, and 25 with MDS in 2012-2014. 
Erythrocytapharesis did not consistently prevent iron overload in patients with 
SCA. Cardiac iron overload was found in 3 (15%) patients with thalassemia, none 
with SCA, and 4 (16%) with MDS. The liver iron content (LIC) ranged from 10.4 to 
15.2 mg/g dry weight, with no significant differences across groups (P = 0.29). 
Abnormal T2* was not significantly associated with any of the measures of 
transfusion or chelation. Ferritin levels showed a strong association with LIC. 
Non-transferrin-bound iron was high in the thalassemia and MDS groups but low in 
the SCA group (P<0.001). Hepcidin was low in thalassemia, normal in SCA, and 
markedly elevated in MDS (P<0.001). Two mechanisms may explain that iron 
deposition largely spares the heart in SCA: the high level of erythropoiesis 
recycles the iron and the chronic inflammation retains iron within the 
macrophages. Thalassemia, in contrast, is characterized by inefficient 
erythropoiesis, unable to handle free iron. Iron accumulation varies widely in 
MDS syndromes due to the competing influences of abnormal erythropoiesis, excess 
iron supply, and inflammation.

INTRODUCTION: Warfarin anticoagulation of oncologic patients with DVT may 
paradoxically progress to phlegmasia cerulea dolens and limb gangrene, due to 
cancer-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation. This case report, 
written in line with the SCARE criteria, endorses venous thrombectomy in 
selected patients to attempt limb salvage. A young woman's warfarin associated 
acute ileofemoral phlegmasia that developed over cervical cancer radiation 
therapy induced DVT, was successfully resolved by clot removal. Extracting 
venous thrombus at the onset, while still as unorganized masses, preserves 
ambulation and prevents post-thrombotic syndrome development, an improvement of 
quality of life especially significant for oncologic patients with limited 
life-expectancy.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 34 years old female, with history of stage 3 cervical 
cancer following radiation therapy, was admitted in regards to left lower limb 
painful pitting oedema with cramps. Doppler scan revealed a left ileofemoral 
DVT. She was set on LMWH, but on fourth day of warfarin co-administration, 
phlegmasia cerulea dolens developed. An emergency venous thrombectomy with 
fasciotomy was performed. Postoperatively, dry foot gangrene developed, which 
dictated transmetatarsal amputation. The patient was discharged after 2 months 
of inpatient treatment, preserving ambulation.
DISCUSSION: Venous thrombectomy (with fasciotomy) in oncologic phlegmasia, 
±serial debridement, becomes an attractive opportunity for limb salvage when 
feasible at acute presentation, available in a limited resource setting.
CONCLUSION: Due to severe procoagulant/anticoagulant balance disturbances in 
cancer patients' warfarin-bridged for DVT, phlegmasia onset should not defer 
surgical approach, unless a rapid response to conservative treatment.

BACKGROUND: American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for acute otitis media 
(AOM) allow for children meeting certain criteria to undergo watchful waiting 
(WW). The cost-effectiveness of this policy has not been evaluated in the United 
States.
METHODS: A retrospective review of a random selection of 250 patients ≤18 years 
old with AOM in the emergency department of a tertiary care children's hospital 
was used to characterize current practice of AOM management. These data were 
incorporated into a decision-analytic cost-utility model comparing the 
cost-effectiveness of implementing WW to current practice. The primary outcome 
was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed in 2015 USD per 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted from a societal perspective. 
Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: From this cohort, chart review confirmed 247 actually had AOM on 
physical examination. Of these, 231 (93.5%) were prescribed antibiotics, 7 
(2.8%) underwent WW, and 9 (3.6%) were sent home without an antibiotic 
prescription. When American Academy of Pediatrics criteria for WW were applied 
to this population, 104 patients (42.1%) met conditions for immediate antibiotic 
prescription, and 143 patients (57.9%) qualified for WW. In our modeled 
scenario, for every 1000 patients with AOM, implementing WW yielded 514 fewer 
immediate antibiotic prescriptions and 205 fewer antibiotic prescriptions used, 
averting 14.3 DALYs, and saving $5573. The preferability of WW over current 
practice proved highly robust to sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: WW for AOM management is cost-effective. Implementing WW may 
improve outcomes and reduce health care expenditures.

Center Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.

Hypopituitarism is defined as one or more pituitary hormone deficits due to a 
lesion in the hypothalamic-pituitary region. By far, the most common cause of 
hypopituitarism associated with a sellar mass is a pituitary adenoma. A high 
index of suspicion is required for diagnosing hypopituitarism in several other 
conditions such as other massess in the sellar and parasellar region, brain 
damage caused by radiation and by traumatic brain injury, vascular lesions, 
infiltrative/immunological/inflammatory diseases (lymphocytic hypophysitis, 
sarcoidosis and hemochromatosis), infectious diseases and genetic disorders. 
Hypopituitarism may be permanent and progressive with sequential pattern of 
hormone deficiencies (radiation-induced hypopituitarism) or transient after 
traumatic brain injury with possible recovery occurring years from the initial 
event. In recent years, there is increased reporting of less common and less 
reported causes of hypopituitarism with its delayed diagnosis. The aim of this 
review is to summarize the published data and to allow earlier identification of 
populations at risk of hypopituitarism as optimal hormonal replacement may 
significantly improve their quality of life and life expectancy.

Beyond QALYs: Multi-criteria based estimation of maximum willingness to pay for 
health technologies.

Nord E(1).

Norway. erik.nord@fhi.no.

The QALY is a useful outcome measure in cost-effectiveness analysis. But in 
determining the overall value of and societal willingness to pay for health 
technologies, gains in quality of life and length of life are prima facie 
separate criteria that need not be put together in a single concept. A focus on 
costs per QALY can also be counterproductive. One reason is that the QALY does 
not capture well the value of interventions in patients with reduced potentials 
for health and thus different reference points. Another reason is a need to 
separate losses of length of life and losses of quality of life when it comes to 
judging the strength of moral claims on resources in patients of different ages. 
An alternative to the cost-per-QALY approach is outlined, consisting in the 
development of two bivariate value tables that may be used in combination to 
estimate maximum cost acceptance for given units of treatment-for instance a 
surgical procedure, or 1 year of medication-rather than for 'obtaining one 
QALY.' The approach is a follow-up of earlier work on 'cost value analysis.' It 
draws on work in the QALY field insofar as it uses health state values 
established in that field. But it does not use these values to weight life years 
and thus avoids devaluing gained life years in people with chronic illness or 
disability. Real tables of the kind proposed could be developed in deliberative 
processes among policy makers and serve as guidance for decision makers involved 
in health technology assessment and appraisal.

PURPOSE: Gender-related differences in life expectancy, prevalence of chronic 
conditions and level of disability in the process of ageing have been broadly 
described. Less is known about social determinants, which may have different 
impacts on quality of life in men and women. The investigation aims to reveal 
gender-related differences in social determinants on quality of life assessed by 
a multi-pathway model including health, social, demographic and living place 
characteristics.
METHODS: The study group consisted of 5099 participants aged 50+ representing 
general populations of three different European regions (Finland, Poland, Spain) 
who participated in COURAGE in EUROPE Project. Standardized tools were used to 
measure quality of life (WHOQOL-AGE) and social determinants (COURAGE Social 
Network Index, OSLO-3 Social Support Scale, UCLA Loneliness Scale, participation 
scale and trust). A multipath model considering exogenous predictors 
(demographic, economic), mediators (social) and endogenous outcome (QOL) was 
created to reveal the role of determinants. Gender-related differences were 
investigated across three age categories: 50-64; 65-79 and 80+.
RESULTS: The model (RMSEA = 0.058; CFI = 0.939) showed the effects of all of the 
investigated determinants. Gender-related differences in the association between 
social constructs and QOL were observed for social networks in the group of 80+, 
for social support in the group of 50-64 and 65-79 years, and for social 
participation in the group of 65-79 years. Males benefited more (in QOL) from 
social networks and social support, and women from social participation.
CONCLUSIONS: The research provides valuable knowledge about the role of social 
determinants in QOL considering complex relations between different social 
constructs. Additionally, the results showed gender-related differences in the 
associations between social networks, social support, social participation and 
QOL, suggesting that men might benefit more from the interventions in the first 
two. Although our research did not investigate the effects of interventions, the 
results show directions for future investigations, how to shape social 
interventions at the population level to improve quality of life of older 
adults, and thus help achieve successful ageing.

Physical activity can affect 'need' for healthcare both by reducing the 
incidence rate of some diseases and by increasing longevity (increasing the time 
lived at older ages when disease incidence is higher). However, it is common to 
consider only the first effect, which may overestimate any reduction in need for 
healthcare. We developed a hybrid micro-simulation lifetable model, which made 
allowance for both changes in longevity and risk of disease incidence, to 
estimate the effects of increases in physical activity (all adults meeting 
guidelines) on measures of healthcare need for diseases for which physical 
activity is protective. These were compared with estimates made using 
comparative risk assessment (CRA) methods, which assumed that longevity was 
fixed. Using the lifetable model, life expectancy increased by 95 days (95% 
uncertainty intervals: 68-126 days). Estimates of the healthcare need tended to 
decrease, but the magnitude of the decreases were noticeably smaller than those 
estimated using CRA methods (e.g. dementia: change in person-years, -0.6%, 95% 
uncertainty interval -3.7% to +1.6%; change in incident cases, -0.4%, -3.6% to 
+1.9%; change in person-years (CRA methods), -4.0%, -7.4% to -1.6%). The pattern 
of results persisted under different scenarios and sensitivity analyses. For 
most diseases for which physical activity is protective, increases in physical 
activity are associated with decreases in indices of healthcare need. However, 
disease onset may be delayed or time lived with disease may increase, such that 
the decreases in need may be relatively small and less than is sometimes 
expected.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is one of the most common genetic causes of male 
infertility. This condition is associated with much comorbidity and with a lower 
life expectancy. The aim of this review is to explore more in depth 
cardiovascular and metabolic disorders associated to KS. KS patients have an 
increased risk of cerebrovascular disease (standardized mortality ratio, SMR, 
2.2; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.6-3.0), but it is not clear whether the 
cause of the death is of thrombotic or hemorrhagic nature. Cardiovascular 
congenital anomalies (SMR, 7.3; 95% CI, 2.4-17.1) and the development of 
thrombosis or leg ulcers (SMR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.9-17.2) are also more frequent in 
these subjects. Moreover, cardiovascular abnormalities may be at least partially 
reversed by testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). KS patients have also an 
increased probability of endocrine and/or metabolic disease, especially obesity, 
metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The effects of TRT on these 
abnormalities are not entirely clear.

Ambient air pollution ranks high among the risk factors that increase the global 
burden of disease. Previous studies focused on assessing mortality risk and were 
sparsely performed in populous developing countries with deteriorating 
environments. We conducted a time-series study to evaluate the air 
pollution-associated years of life lost (YLL) and mortality risk and to identify 
potential modifiers relating to the season and demographic characteristics. 
Using linear (for YLL) and Poisson (for mortality) regression models and 
controlling for time-varying factors, we found that an interquartile range (IQR) 
increase in a three-day average cumulative (lag 0-2 day) concentrations of 
PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and SO2 corresponded to increases in YLL of 12.09 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 2.98-21.20), 13.69 (95% CI: 3.32-24.07), 26.95 (95% 
CI: 13.99-39.91) and 24.39 (95% CI: 8.62-40.15) years, respectively, and to 
percent increases in mortality of 1.34% (95% CI: 0.67-2.01%), 1.56% (95% CI: 
0.80-2.33%), 3.36% (95% CI: 2.39-4.33%) and 2.39% (95% CI: 1.24-3.55%), 
respectively. Among the specific causes of death, cardiovascular and respiratory 
diseases were positively associated with gaseous pollutants (NO2 and SO2), and 
diabetes was positively correlated with NO2 (in terms of the mortality risk). 
The effects of air pollutants were more pronounced in the cool season than in 
the warm season. The elderly (>65 years) and females were more vulnerable to air 
pollution. Studying effect estimates and their modifications by using YLL to 
detect premature death should support implementing health risk assessments, 
identifying susceptible groups and guiding policy-making and resource allocation 
according to specific local conditions.

BACKGROUND: Burden of disease (BoD) as measured by Disability-Adjusted Life 
Years (DALYs) is one of the criteria for priority-setting in health care 
resource allocation. DALYs incorporate disability weights (DWs), which are 
currently expert-derived estimates or non-existent for most pediatric surgical 
conditions. The objective of this study is to establish DWs for a subset of key 
pediatric congenital anomalies using a range of health valuation metrics with 
caregivers in both high- and low-resource settings.
METHOD: We described 15 health states to health professionals (physicians, 
nurses, social workers, and therapists) and community caregivers in Kenya and 
Canada. The health states summaries were expert- and community-derived, 
consisting of a narrated description of the disease and a functional profile 
described in EQ-5D-5 L style. DWs for each health state were elicited using four 
health valuation exercises (preference ranking, visual analogue scale (VAS), 
paired comparison (PC), and time trade-off (TTO)). The PC data were anchored 
internally to the TTO and externally to existing data to yield DWs for each 
health state on a scale from 0 (health) to 1 (dead). Any differences in DWs 
between the two countries were analyzed.
RESULTS: In total, 154 participants, matched by profession, were recruited from 
Kijabe, Kenya (n = 78) and Hamilton, Canada (n = 76). Overall calculated DWs for 
15 health states ranged from 0.13 to 0.77, with little difference between 
countries (intra-class coefficient 0.97). However, DWs generated in Kenya for 
severe hypospadias and undescended testes were higher than Canadian-derived DWs 
(p = 0.04 and p < 0.003, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: We have derived country-specific DWs for pediatric congenital 
anomalies using several low-cost methods and inter-professional and community 
caregivers. The TTO-anchored PC method appears best suited for future use. The 
majority of DWs do not appear to differ significantly between the two cultural 
contexts and could be used to inform further work of estimating the burden of 
global pediatric surgical disease. Care should be taken in comparing the DWs 
obtained in the current study to the existent list of DWs because methodological 
differences may impact on their compatibility.

Since the publication of the last US national burden of skin disease report in 
2006, there have been substantial changes in the practice of dermatology and the 
US health care system. These include the development of new treatment 
modalities, marked increases in the cost of medications, increasingly complex 
payer rules and regulations, and an aging of the US population. Recognizing the 
need for up-to-date data to inform researchers, policy makers, public 
stakeholders, and health care providers about the impact of skin disease on 
patients and US society, the American Academy of Dermatology produced a new 
national burden of skin disease report. Using 2013 claims data from private and 
governmental insurance providers, this report analyzed the prevalence, cost, and 
mortality attributable to 24 skin disease categories in the US population. In 
this first of 3 articles, the presented data demonstrate that nearly 85 million 
Americans were seen by a physician for at least 1 skin disease in 2013. This led 
to an estimated direct health care cost of $75 billion and an indirect lost 
opportunity cost of $11 billion. Further, mortality was noted in half of the 24 
skin disease categories.
