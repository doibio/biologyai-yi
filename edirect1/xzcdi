METHODS: This is a prospective, single arm, cohort study. Twenty-two patients 
with inoperable malignant biliary strictures in the distal common bile duct 
(Bismuth I-II) and life expectancy more than 6 months were included in the 
study. The combination of a fully covered biliary stent and a bare proximal and 
distal extension was used in all cases. All patients were followed-up until 
death. Primary patency, survival, complication rates and dysfunction cause were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Mean survival was 263.7 days (median 255, SD: 77.6). Mean patency was 
240 days (median: 237, SD: 87). The primary patency rate at 3, 6 and 12 months 
was 90%, 86% and 86% respectively. Tumour inor overgrowth did not occur in any 
of the patients. Dysfunction due to sludge formation occurred in three cases; 
all three were treated with bilioplasty.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of a covered biliary stent and a bare extension 
appears to be a very effective tool in the palliation of malignant biliary 
disease, offering long-term patency for patients with inoperable malignant 
distal common bile duct strictures and increasing the quality of life of such 
patients.

 Some patients do not inform healthcare professionals of adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) because they fear termination of aggressive medication therapies. 
Preferences for aggressive medication therapies may differ between patients and 
pharmacists. The goal of this study was to estimate whether pharmacists were 
able to accurately assess patient preference for aggressive medication therapies 
with potentially stronger ADRs. A cross-sectional study was conducted of 
hospitalized patients (35 to 74 years of age) receiving oral medications for a 
chronic disease or systemic chemotherapy at three hospitals in Japan. We 
estimated the extent of agreement between patient responses and pharmacist 
predictions using a scenario-based investigation (1) to examine the choice 
between an aggressive medication therapy and the standard therapy, and (2) to 
assess increased life expectancy as a result of aggressive medication therapy. 
The extent of agreement was estimated using the kappa statistic. Of 113 
patients, 43 (38.1%) chose the aggressive medication therapy. Pharmacists 
correctly predicted the choice of 25 (58.1%) of these patients [kappa 0.32 (95% 
confidence interval 0.15-0.50)]. Of 111 patients, 42 (37.8%) expected one 
additional life expectancy year. However, pharmacists predicted that as many as 
36 (85.7%) of these patients would require more years of added life expectancy 
before choosing an aggressive medication therapy [kappa 0.24 (0.08-0.40)]. 
Agreement between patients and pharmacists on the choice of aggressive 
medication therapy was generally poor. Pharmacists should make an effort to 
identify patients who might prefer more aggressive medication therapies with 
potentially stronger ADRs in order to minimize ADR risk.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the economic impact likely to be achieved by efforts to 
vaccinate against 10 vaccine-preventable diseases between 2001 and 2020 in 73 
low- and middle-income countries largely supported by Gavi, the Vaccine 
Alliance.
METHODS: We used health impact models to estimate the economic impact of 
achieving forecasted coverages for vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae 
type b, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus, Japanese encephalitis, measles, 
Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A, rotavirus, rubella, Streptococcus pneumoniae 
and yellow fever. In comparison with no vaccination, we modelled the costs - 
expressed in 2010 United States dollars (US$) - of averted treatment, 
transportation costs, productivity losses of caregivers and productivity losses 
due to disability and death. We used the value-of-a-life-year method to estimate 
the broader economic and social value of living longer, in better health, as a 
result of immunization.
FINDINGS: We estimated that, in the 73 countries, vaccinations given between 
2001 and 2020 will avert over 20 million deaths and save US$ 350 billion in cost 
of illness. The deaths and disability prevented by vaccinations given during the 
two decades will result in estimated lifelong productivity gains totalling 
US$ 330 billion and US$ 9 billion, respectively. Over the lifetimes of the 
vaccinated cohorts, the same vaccinations will save an estimated US$ 5 billion 
in treatment costs. The broader economic and social value of these vaccinations 
is estimated at US$ 820 billion.
CONCLUSION: By preventing significant costs and potentially increasing economic 
productivity among some of the world's poorest countries, the impact of 
immunization goes well beyond health.

Publisher: OBJECTIF: Estimer l'impact économique qui pourrait découler des 
efforts de vaccination contre 10 maladies à prévention vaccinale déployés 
entre 2001 et 2020 dans 73 pays à revenu faible et intermédiaire, et largement 
soutenus par Gavi, l'Alliance du Vaccin.
MÉTHODES: Nous avons utilisé des modèles d'évaluation de l'impact sur la santé 
pour estimer l'impact économique qui découlerait, si le taux de couverture prévu 
est atteint, des vaccinations contre Haemophilus influenzae type B, 
l'hépatite B, le papillomavirus humain, l'encéphalite japonaise, la rougeole, 
Neisseria meningitidis sérogroupe A, le rotavirus, la rubéole, Streptococcus 
pneumoniae et la fièvre jaune. Pour établir une comparaison avec l'absence de 
vaccination, nous avons modélisé les coûts – exprimés en dollars des 
États-Unis 2010 (USD) – des traitements évités, les coûts de transport, les 
pertes de productivité des soignants non professionnels et les pertes de 
productivité pour cause d'invalidité ou de décès. Nous avons utilisé une méthode 
permettant d'évaluer la valeur d'une année de vie pour estimer la valeur 
économique et sociale au sens large d'une vie plus longue et en meilleure santé 
grâce à la vaccination.
RÉSULTATS: D'après nos estimations, les vaccinations pratiquées entre 2001 
et 2020 dans les 73 pays permettront d'éviter plus de 20 millions de décès et 
d'économiser 350 milliards de dollars des États-Unis en coûts sanitaires. Les 
cas de décès et d'invalidité évités grâce à la vaccination pratiquée au cours de 
ces deux décennies entraîneront des gains de productivité permanents 
respectivement estimés à 330 milliards de dollars des États-Unis et 9 milliards 
de dollars des États-Unis. On estime qu'au cours de la vie des cohortes 
vaccinées, les mêmes vaccinations permettront d'économiser 5 milliards de 
dollars des États-Unis en coûts de traitement. La valeur économique et sociale 
au sens large de ces vaccinations est estimée à 820 milliards de dollars des 
États-Unis.
CONCLUSION: L'impact de la vaccination dépasse le domaine de la santé, car il 
permet d'éviter d'importants coûts et une augmentation potentielle de la 
productivité économique de certains des pays les plus pauvres du monde.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Estimar el impacto económico que probablemente se logaría 
con los esfuerzos de vacunar frente a 10 enfermedades evitables mediante la 
vacunación entre 2001 y 2020 en 73 países con ingresos bajos y medios 
ampliamente respaldados por la Gavi, la Vaccine Alliance.
MÉTODOS: Se utilizaron modelos de impacto sanitario para estimar el impacto 
económico de lograr las coberturas previstas de vacunación frente a Haemophilus 
influenzae tipo b, hepatitis B, virus del papiloma humano, encefalitis japonesa, 
sarampión, Neisseria meningitidis serogrupo A, rotavirus, rubéola, Streptococcus 
pneumoniae y fiebre amarilla. En comparación con la no vacunación, se modelaron 
los costes (expresados en dólares estadounidenses, USD, de 2010) de los 
tratamientos evitados, los costes de transporte, las pérdidas de productividad 
de los proveedores de salud y las pérdidas de productividad debido a la 
discapacidad y la muerte. Se utilizó el método de valor de vida anual para 
estimar de forma más amplia el valor económico y social del hecho de vivir más, 
con una mejor salud, como resultado de la inmunización.
RESULTADOS: Se estimó que, en los 73 países, las vacunas suministradas entre 
2001 y 2020 evitarán más de 20 millones de muertes y ahorrarán 350 000 millones 
de USD en costes de enfermedades. Las muertes y las discapacidades evitadas 
gracias a las vacunas suministradas durante las dos décadas tendrán como 
resultado unas ganancias permanentes estimadas en la productividad de un total 
de 330 000 millones de USD y 9 000 millones de USD, respectivamente. Durante la 
vida de las cohortes vacunadas, se estima que las mismas vacunaciones ahorrarán 
5 000 millones de USD en costes de tratamientos. El valor económico y social más 
amplio de estas vacunas se estima en 820 000 millones de USD.
CONCLUSIÓN: El impacto de las vacunas es positivo más allá de la salud, ya que 
se evitan costes significativos y se aumenta potencialmente la productividad 
económica entre algunos de los países más pobres.

Publisher: 目的: 
评估 2001 到 2020 年间 73 个中低收入国家通过针对 10 种疫苗可预防疾病进行疫苗接种可能实现的经济影响。评估主要由全球疫苗联盟 (Gavi) 提供支持。.
方法: 
我们使用健康影响模型评估了实现预期的乙型流感嗜血杆菌、乙型肝炎、人乳头瘤病毒、乙型脑炎、麻疹、A 群脑膜炎奈瑟菌、轮状病毒、风疹、肺炎双球菌和黄热病疫苗接种覆盖率的经济影响。 
与不进行疫苗接种相比,我们以 2010 年的美元 (US$) 为单位建立了成本模型——包括避免治疗节省的成本、运输成本、护理人员的生产力损失和因残疾和死亡造成的生产力损失。 
我们使用“年生命值”方法估算了因免疫接种而延长生命和保持更健康的生活的更广泛经济和社会价值。.
结果: 我们估计 2001 年到 2020 年间,73 个国家的疫苗接种将避免超过 2000 万人的死亡数和节省 3500 亿美元的疾病成本。 
二十年间通过疫苗接种避免的死亡和残疾数预计将分别带来总额为 3300 亿美元和 90 亿美元的终身生产力收益。 
在接种疫苗人群的一生中接种同种疫苗预计会节省 50 亿的治疗成本。 预计此类疫苗接种的更广泛经济和社会价值达 8200 亿美元。.
结论: 通过减少世界上一些最贫穷国家的重大开支和提高潜在的经济生产力,免疫接种的影响远不止在卫生领域。.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ: Оценить экономические последствия, которые могут быть 
достигнуты благодаря усилиям в области вакцинации против 10 предупреждаемых 
вакцинацией болезней, в период с 2001 по 2020 г. в 73 странах с низким и средним 
уровнем дохода, которые в значительной степени поддерживаются ГАВИ (Глобальным 
альянсом по вакцинам и иммунизации).
МЕТОДЫ: Мы использовали модели воздействия на здоровье для оценки экономических 
последствий достижения прогнозируемых покрытий вакцинацией против таких 
возбудителей инфекций, как Haemophilus influenzae типа b, вирус гепатита B, 
вирус папилломы человека, вирус японского энцефалита, вирус кори, Neisseria 
meningitidis серогруппы A, ротавирус, вирус краснухи, Streptococcus pneumoniae и 
вирус желтой лихорадки. При сравнении с отсутствием вакцинации мы моделировали 
затраты, выраженные в долларах США (US $) по курсу 2010 года: предотвращение 
расходов на лечение, транспортных расходов, нетрудоспособности лиц, ухаживающих 
за детьми, и нетрудоспособности из-за инвалидности и смерти. Мы использовали 
метод, основанный на ценности одного года жизни, чтобы оценить более широкую 
экономическую и социальную ценность более долгой жизни и лучшего состояния 
здоровья, достигнутых в результате иммунизации.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Мы подсчитали, что в 73 странах вакцинации, проведенные в период с 
2001 по 2020 г., предотвратят более 20 миллионов смертей и позволят сэкономить 
350 миллиардов долларов США на затратах, связанных с болезнями. Смертность и 
инвалидность, предотвращенные с помощью вакцинации, проведенной в течение двух 
десятилетий, приведут к ожидаемому росту производительности труда на протяжении 
всей жизни на общую сумму 330 миллиардов долларов США и 9 миллиардов долларов 
США соответственно. В течение жизни вакцинированных когорт те же вакцинации 
позволят сэкономить приблизительно 5 миллиардов долларов США на расходах на 
лечение. Более широкая экономическая и социальная ценность этих вакцинаций 
оценивается в 820 миллиардов долларов США.
ВЫВОД: Предотвращая значительные издержки и потенциально увеличивая 
экономическую производительность среди некоторых беднейших стран мира, влияние 
иммунизации выходит далеко за пределы здоровья.

Update on pharmacological treatment of acute coronary syndrome without 
persistent ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in the elderly.

The increase in cardiovascular disease prevalence with ageing has been 
attributed to several age-related changes such as changes in the vascular wall 
elasticity, the coagulation and haemostatic system and endothelial dysfunction, 
among other causes. There is a 50% increased mortality risk per 10-year increase 
in age starting at 65 years old. Here, we aimed to discuss pharmacological 
treatment in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without persistent ST segment 
elevation myocardial infarction in the elderly. The main aim of ACS treatment in 
elderly people is at preventing ischemia, myocardial damage and complications. A 
meta-analysis suggests that invasive revascularization therapy is probably most 
useful in older patients. Dual antiplatelet therapy is currently the standard of 
care post-ACS. Platelet P2Y12 inhibitors are among the most commonly used 
medications worldwide, due to their established benefits in the treatment and 
prevention of arterial thrombosis. The main recommendation is to tailor 
antithrombotic treatment, considering body weight, renal function (Class I, 
level C) and careful evaluation of life expectancy, comorbidities, risk/benefit 
profile, quality of life and frailty when invasive strategies are considered 
(Class IIa, level A) on top of the different recommendations given for a general 
non ST elevation ACS population. It is obvious that potent P2Y12 inhibitors will 
continue to play an important role in pharmacological treatment for elderly ACS 
patients in the future.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of disposable, hydrophilic-coated 
catheters in Japan.
METHODS: A Markov decision model previously applied in a European study was used 
to evaluate the cost effectiveness of intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) 
with hydrophilic-coated catheters in Japanese spinal cord injury (SCI) patients 
suffering from chronic urinary retention from a lifetime perspective. To adjust 
the model to a Japanese setting, relevant Japanese data regarding the baseline 
risk of urinary tract infection (UTI), the average age at onset of SCI, costs, 
and general mortality were extracted from published literature, national 
statistics, or the opinions of Japanese experts. The direct medical costs, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life years gained (LYG) were calculated 
from the payers' perspective. An annual discount rate of 2% was applied to both 
the costs and the effects.
RESULTS: The incremental cost of hydrophilic-coated catheters was 1 279 886 yen 
(US$ 10 578 at an exchange rate of US$ 1 = 121 yen) per SCI patient, but they 
yielded an additional 0.334 QALYs and 0.781 LYG compared with uncoated 
catheters. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of hydrophilic-coated 
catheters vs. uncoated catheters was 3 826 351 yen/QALY (US$ 31 623/QALY) gained 
and 1 639 562 yen/LYG (US$ 13 550/LYG).
CONCLUSIONS: The ICER of 3.8 million yen (US$ 31 405) falls well within the 
Japanese societal willingness to pay per QALY gained; therefore, 
hydrophilic-coated catheters can be considered highly cost-effective in Japan 
compared with uncoated catheters. However, because of the lack of relevant 
studies, a number of key parameters could not be based on Japanese data, and 
further research among people with SCI in Japan is recommended.

BACKGROUND: When treatment-refractory schizophrenia shows an insufficient 
response to a trial of clozapine, clinicians commonly add a second 
antipsychotic, despite the lack of robust evidence to justify this practice.
OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of the study were to establish the clinical 
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of augmentation of clozapine medication 
with a second antipsychotic, amisulpride, for the management of 
treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
DESIGN: The study was a multicentre, double-blind, individually randomised, 
placebo-controlled trial with follow-up at 12 weeks.
SETTINGS: The study was set in NHS multidisciplinary teams in adult psychiatry.
PARTICIPANTS: Eligible participants were people aged 18-65 years with 
treatment-resistant schizophrenia unresponsive, at a criterion level of 
persistent symptom severity and impaired social function, to an adequate trial 
of clozapine monotherapy.
INTERVENTIONS: Interventions comprised clozapine augmentation over 12 weeks with 
amisulpride or placebo. Participants received 400 mg of amisulpride or two 
matching placebo capsules for the first 4 weeks, after which there was a 
clinical option to titrate the dosage of amisulpride up to 800 mg or four 
matching placebo capsules for the remaining 8 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of 
'responders', using a criterion response threshold of a 20% reduction in total 
score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.
RESULTS: A total of 68 participants were randomised. Compared with the 
participants assigned to placebo, those receiving amisulpride had a greater 
chance of being a responder by the 12-week follow-up (odds ratio 1.17, 95% 
confidence interval 0.40 to 3.42) and a greater improvement in negative 
symptoms, although neither finding had been present at 6-week follow-up and 
neither was statistically significant. Amisulpride was associated with a greater 
side effect burden, including cardiac side effects. Economic analyses indicated 
that amisulpride augmentation has the potential to be cost-effective in the 
short term [net saving of between £329 and £2011; no difference in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] and possibly in the longer term.
LIMITATIONS: The trial under-recruited and, therefore, the power of statistical 
analysis to detect significant differences between the active and placebo groups 
was limited. The economic analyses indicated high uncertainty because of the 
short duration and relatively small number of participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk-benefit of amisulpride augmentation of clozapine for 
schizophrenia that has shown an insufficient response to a trial of clozapine 
monotherapy is worthy of further investigation in larger studies. The size and 
extent of the side effect burden identified for the amisulpride-clozapine 
combination may partly reflect the comprehensive assessment of side effects in 
this study. The design of future trials of such a treatment strategy should take 
into account that a clinical response may be not be evident within the 4- to 
6-week follow-up period usually considered adequate in studies of antipsychotic 
treatment of acute psychotic episodes. Economic evaluation indicated the need 
for larger, longer-term studies to address uncertainty about the extent of 
savings because of amisulpride and impact on QALYs. The extent and nature of the 
side effect burden identified for the amisulpride-clozapine combination has 
implications for the nature and frequency of safety and tolerability monitoring

INTRODUCTION: Bariatric surgery offers effective obesity treatment. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery in 
Denmark from a third-party payer perspective in the mid- (ten years) and 
long-term (lifetime).
METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was developed in which patients may 
experience surgery, post-surgery complications, diabetes mellitus type 2, 
cardiovascular diseases or die. Transition probabilities, costs and utilities 
were informed by the literature. Three types of surgery were included: gastric 
bypass, sleeve gastrectomy and adjustable gastric banding. The impact of 
different surgical methods on BMI level was informed by the Danish Obesity 
Surgery Registry (Dansk Fedmekirurgiregister).
RESULTS: In the ten-year base-case analysis, bariatric surgery led to a cost 
increment of 19,332 DKK and generated an additional 1.1 quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs). In the course of a lifetime, surgery leads to savings of 36,403 
DKK, an additional 0.7 life years and 2.9 QALYs. Bariatric surgery was 
cost-effective at ten years with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
17,818 DKK per QALY and was dominant over conservative management in the course 
of a lifetime. Up to three years of delay in the provision of surgery resulted 
in a reduction of life years, a lower QALY gain and a minor decrease in 
healthcare costs.
CONCLUSIONS: In Denmark, bariatric surgery is cost-effective at ten years and 
may produce a significant reduction in healthcare costs over the course of a 
lifetime in persons with severe obesity.

BACKGROUND: Ablative therapies (AT) in kidney cancer are rising. It's important 
to evaluate the situation of this therapy. The aim of this study is to identify 
the best indications for AT treatment for kidney cancer.
METHODS: Review of literature using Medline and Embase databases. Study were 
selected based on scientific relevance. Clinical keys centered on the best 
requirements to indicate ablative therapies.
RESULTS: AT is indicated according to specific tumor and patients criteria. A 
good initial evaluation is essential (imaging, pathology, renal function and 
general condition of the patient). AT gets the best results when applied to the 
following tumor criteria: solid tumor, length<3cm, exophytic localization, RENAL 
score<8. In few cases, AT could be discussed as an alternative to the reference 
treatment, sparing surgery: life expectancy evaluated between 3 and 7 years, 
chronic renal failure or single kidney, transplanted kidney, familial tumors. AT 
can be used in first line, post-surgery after local recurrence or for distant 
metastasis. Like every other innovative technic, indications of AT would be 
adjust with learning curve and cost-effectiveness.
CONCLUSION: AT have to be included as a valid treatment for kidney cancer<4cm. 
The respect of actual indications and collection of results of AT compared to 
surveillance and surgery, would determinate the evolution of AT indications in 
the future.

BACKGROUND: TargomiRs are minicells (EnGeneIC Dream Vectors) loaded with 
miR-16-based mimic microRNA (miRNA) and targeted to EGFR that are designed to 
counteract the loss of the miR-15 and miR-16 family miRNAs, which is associated 
with unsuppressed tumour growth in preclinical models of malignant pleural 
mesothelioma. We aimed to assess the safety, optimal dosing, and activity of 
TargomiRs in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.
METHODS: In this first-in-man, open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 trial at 
three major cancer centres in Sydney (NSW, Australia), we recruited adults (aged 
≥18 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma, 
measurable disease, radiological signs of progression after previous 
chemotherapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, 
life expectancy of 3 months or more, immunohistochemical evidence of tumour EGFR 
expression, and adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function. Patients were 
given TargomiRs via 20 min intravenous infusion either once or twice a week (3 
days apart) in a traditional 3 + 3 dose-escalation design in five dose cohorts. 
The dose-escalation steps planned were 5 × 109, 7 × 109, and 9 × 109 TargomiRs 
either once or twice weekly, but after analysis of data from the first eight 
patients, all subsequent patients started protocol treatment at 1 × 109 
TargomiRs. The primary endpoints were to establish the maximum tolerated dose of 
TargomiRs as measured by dose-limiting toxicity, define the optimal frequency of 
administration, and objective response (defined as the percentage of assessable 
patients with a complete or partial response), duration of response (defined as 
time from the first evidence of response to disease progression in patients who 
achieved a response), time to response (ie, time from start of treatment to the 
first evidence of response) and overall survival (defined as time from treatment 
allocation to death from any cause). Analyses were based on the full analysis 
set principle, including every patient who received at least one dose of 
TargomiRs. The study was closed for patient entry on Jan 3, 2017, and registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02369198, and the Australian Registry of 
Clinical Trials, number ACTRN12614001248651.
FINDINGS: Between Sept 29, 2014, and Nov 24, 2016, we enrolled 27 patients, 26 
of whom received at least one TargomiR dose (one patient died before beginning 
treatment). Overall, five dose-limiting toxicities were noted: infusion-related 
inflammatory symptoms and coronary ischaemia, respectively, in two patients 
given 5 × 109 TargomiRs twice weekly; anaphylaxis and cardiomyopathy, 
respectively, in two patients given 5 × 109 TargomiRs once weekly but who 
received reduced dexamethasone prophylaxis; and non-cardiac pain in one patient 
who received 5 × 109 TargomiRs once weekly. We established that 5 × 109 
TargomiRs once weekly was the maximum tolerated dose. TargomiR infusions were 
accompanied by transient lymphopenia (25 [96%] of 26 patients), temporal 
hypophosphataemia (17 [65%] of 26 patients), increased aspartate 
aminotransferase or alanine aminotranferase (six [23%] of 26 patients), and 
increased alkaline phosphatase blood concentrations (two [8%]). Cardiac events 
occurred in five patients: three patients had electrocardiographic changes, one 
patient had ischaemia, and one patient had Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Of the 22 
patients who were assessed for response by CT, one (5%) had a partial response, 
15 (68%) had stable disease, and six (27%) had progressive disease. The 
proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was therefore one (5%) 
of 22, and the duration of the objective response in that patient was 32 weeks. 
Median overall survival was 200 days (95% CI 94-358). During the trial, 21 
deaths occurred, of which 20 were related to tumour progression and one was due 
to bowel perforation.
INTERPRETATION: The acceptable safety profile and early signs of activity of 
TargomiRs in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma support additional 
studies of TargomiRs in combination with chemotherapy or immune checkpoint 
inhibitors.

Due to dramatic improvements in life expectancy we are seeing a rapidly growing 
population of older people. Increasing frailty and susceptibility to fragility 
fractures are becoming pressing issues for both the individuals that suffer them 
as well as society, through pressures on health and social care budgets. The 
success of fracture liaison services, co-ordinated programmes enhancing the 
management of the fracture, osteoporosis, frailty and falls risk, is undisputed. 
To achieve optimal outcomes, however, it is important to have a standardisation 
of design, scope and structure of the service. Experience has taught us that by 
delegating responsibility for the holistic care of the patient to a trained and 
adequately resourced professional/team (fracture prevention practitioner) with 
clear standards against which benchmarking occurs, is the optimal model of 
delivery. Future challenges include how best to measure the success of services 
in imparting a reduction in fractures at a local population level as well as how 
to detect those patients with unmet need who do not uniformly present to health 
care services, such as those with vertebral fractures. The implementation of 
fracture liaison services however, is a clear demonstration of how collaboration 
between health care, social care and charity organisations, among others, has 
materially improved the health and well-being of the population.

INTRODUCTION: In nursing home (NH) residents with a very short life expectancy, 
the benefits of preventive cardiovascular medication maintenance are 
questionable.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of 4 classes of preventive cardiovascular 
medication (PCM) in NH residents, and to explore differences of prevalence 
across length of stay, mortality risk, cognitive impairment, functional 
disability, and across countries.
METHODS: A 12-month prospective cohort study was conducted in 57 NHs in 8 
countries (Czech Republic, England, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, The 
Netherlands, and Israel). We assessed the prevalence at first measurement of 4 
classes of PCM: oral anticoagulants (OAC), platelet aggregation inhibitor (PAI), 
antihypertensive (AHT), and lipid-modifying agent (LMA), in older (60+ years) 
residents with valid medication assessments. The PCM prevalence was compared 
across the length of stay (short <60 days, mid, long >12 months), health 
instability as defined by Changes in Health, End-Stage Disease, Signs, and 
Symptoms Scale (CHESS) > 3, cognitive impairment by Cognitive Performance Scale 
(CPS) > 2, and functional disability was measured using the Activities of Daily 
Living Hierarchy Scale (ADLH) ≥5.
RESULTS: Of the 3759 eligible residents, 2175 (57.9%) used at least 1 PCM. The 
prevalence of the 4 groups of PCM: OAC, PAI, AHT and LMA were 5.6%, 34.9%, 
35.7%, and 10.4%, respectively. PCM use was lower in long-stay residents versus 
mid-stay: 56.0% vs. 62.7%, in cognitively impaired residents (47.1% vs. 67%), in 
residents with a high mortality risk (47.4% vs. 58.6%), and in residents with a 
high ADLH score (48.6% vs 64.0%).
CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of PCM use was lower in long-stay, 
cognitively impaired residents, persons with a high mortality risk, and 
residents with more functional disabilities, there seems to be room for 
deprescribing.

BACKGROUND: In Taiwan, the current life expectancy of an 80-year-old man is 88.4 
years and that of an 80-year-old is woman is 89.8 years. Surgical candidates 
older than 80 years usually ask surgeons whether it would be safe for them to 
undergo surgery.
PURPOSE: The objectives of this study were to report the surgical outcomes of 
patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis who were older than 80 years and 
underwent instrumented surgeries and to compare these data with the outcomes of 
patients aged 65-79 years.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a retrospective study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: The study included 76 patients.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The preoperative medical condition was reviewed using the 
weighted Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the American Society of 
Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification. Clinical outcomes were 
evaluated according to the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the visual analog 
scale (VAS) for leg and back pain. Plain radiographs were used to assess the 
fusion status, implant-related complications, and the prevalence of osteoporotic 
compression fractures (OVFx).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study comprised patients older than 80 years, and the 
control group comprised patients aged 65-79 years. The two cohorts were matched 
for gender, main diagnosis, and surgical method.
RESULTS: In total, 76 patients were included in the study. The study group had 
38 patients with a mean age of 82.4 years (80-93 years); the control group also 
had 38 patients with a mean age of 70.8 years (65-79 years). The study group had 
a significantly higher ASA classification (2.94 vs. 2.76, p=.040) and CCI score 
(1.84 vs. 1.13, p=.012). The study group had a higher prevalence of preoperative 
OVFx (10.5% vs. 2.6%, p=.116) and incidence of new-onset OVFx (13.2% vs. 2.6%, 
p=.089). The study group had longer operative times (204.6 vs. 179.1 minutes, 
p=.052) with more blood loss (606.5 vs. 525.8 mL, p=.512), but this finding was 
not statistically significant. The mean ODI and VAS scores were similar between 
the two groups. The bone union rate was superior in the control group (81.6% vs. 
89.5%, p=.328).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients older than 80 years have a higher osteoporotic status and 
comorbidities, which may lead to longer operative times and greater blood loss, 
with poorer radiographic outcomes. However, the clinical results were not 
affected. With appropriate patient selection, the age of >80 years is not a 
negative predictive factor for instrumented surgery for degenerative 
spondylolisthesis.

Mental disorders contribute substantially to the loss of quality of life and 
life expectancy in old age. Life expectancy is reduced especially by the 
bidirectional interaction with heart diseases, diabetes mellitus as well as the 
depression-specific risk of suicide. Depression in old age is a strong risk 
factor for nursing home placement, which is usually an undesired outcome for 
older people. Utilization of mental health services is hindered by 
self-stigmatization and prejudice; however, according to recent surveys older 
people increasingly value psychotherapeutic services. Shortcomings in the 
diagnostics and therapy in the primary treatment of old age depression have 
stimulated research in low-threshold options in primary care and collaborative 
multiprofessional outpatient interventions in many countries. The core features 
of collaborative care approaches are improved diagnostics, stepped-care 
protocols, continuous disease monitoring, and access to psychiatric and 
psychotherapeutic supervision or services. Collaborative multiprofessional 
outpatient approaches have been shown to be superior for the treatment of old 
age depression compared to treatment as usual.

INTRODUCTION: In Sweden an estimated 10,000 people with type 1 diabetes use 
continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Sensor-augmented pump therapy 
(SAP) is associated with higher acquisition costs but provides additional 
clinical benefits (e.g. reduced rate of hypoglycemic events) over and above that 
of CSII alone. The aim of the analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 
SAP with automated insulin suspension relative to CSII alone in two different 
groups of patients with type 1 diabetes in Sweden.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analyses were performed using the QuintilesIMS CORE 
Diabetes Model, with clinical and economic input data derived from published 
literature. Separate analyses were performed for patients at increased risk of 
hypoglycemia and for patients with uncontrolled glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at 
baseline. Analyses were performed from a societal perspective over a lifetime 
time horizon. Future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3% per 
annum.
RESULTS: SAP with automated insulin suspension was associated with an 
incremental gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy versus the CSII of 1.88 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in patients at high risk of hypoglycemia and 
of 1.07 QALYs in patients with uncontrolled HbA1c at baseline. Higher lifetime 
costs for SAP with automated insulin suspension resulted in projected 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the SAP with automated insulin 
suspension versus CSII of Swedish Krona (SEK) 139,795 [euros (EUR) 14,648] per 
QALY gained for patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia and SEK 251,896 
(EUR 26,395) per QALY gained for patients with uncontrolled HbA1c. In both 
groups, SAP with automated insulin suspension also reduced the incidence of 
diabetes-related complications relative to CSII.
CONCLUSIONS: In Sweden, SAP with automated insulin suspension likely represents 
a cost-effective treatment option relative to CSII for the management of 
patients with type 1 diabetes with a history of severe hypoglycemic events or 
patients who struggle to achieve good glycemic control despite the use of CSII.

Pulmonary hypertension in diffuse parenchymal lung diseases - is there any 
benefit of PAH-specific therapy?

Szturmowicz M(1), Kacprzak A, Kuś J.

Research Institute, Warsaw, Poland. monika.szturmowicz@gmail.com.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is diagnosed in 40-50% of the patients with 
end-stage diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLD), and it is associated with 
significant worsening of life expectancy. Latest ERS/ESC guidelines recommend 
best available treatment of DPLD, and long-term oxygen therapy in the patients 
with PaO2 less than 60 mm Hg. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-targeted 
drugs are not recommended in PH-DPLD patients, due to the risk of increasing the 
ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and consequently worsening of hypoxaemia. 
Nevertheless, PAH-oriented treatment may be beneficial to selected groups of 
patients. The authors try to find the answer to several important questions: is 
there any benefit of PAH-specific therapy in PH-DPLD, who should be the 
candidate for PAH-specific therapy, what class of drugs is most promising, and 
what outcome measures should be employed?

OBJECTIVES: The Priorities and Evaluation Committee (PEC) funding 
recommendations for new cancer drugs in British Columbia, Canada have been based 
on both clinical and economic evidence. The British Columbia Ministry of Health 
makes funding decisions. We assessed the association between cost-effectiveness 
of cancer drugs considered from 1998 to 2008 and the subsequent funding 
decisions.
METHODS: All proposals submitted to the PEC between 1998 and 2008 were reviewed, 
and the association between cost-effectiveness and funding decisions was 
examined by (i) using logistic regression to test the hypothesis that 
interventions with higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) have a 
lower probability of receiving a positive funding decision and (ii) using 
parametric and nonparametric tests to determine if a statistically significant 
difference exists between the mean cost-effectiveness of funded versus not 
funded proposals. A sub-analysis was conducted to determine if the findings 
varied across different outcome measures.
RESULTS: Of the 149 proposals reviewed, 78 reported cost-effectiveness using 
various outcome measures. In the proposals that used life-years gained as the 
outcome (n = 22), a statistically significant difference of nearly $115,000 was 
observed between the mean ICERs for funded proposals ($42,006) and for unfunded
