Two decades ago, the genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda led to the deaths of 
1 million people, and the displacement of millions more. Injury and trauma were 
followed by the effects of a devastated health system and economy. In the years 
that followed, a new course set by a new government set into motion 
equity-oriented national policies focusing on social cohesion and people-centred 
development. Premature mortality rates have fallen precipitously in recent 
years, and life expectancy has doubled since the mid-1990s. Here we reflect on 
the lessons learned in rebuilding Rwanda's health sector during the past two 
decades, as the country now prepares itself to take on new challenges in 
health-care delivery.

BACKGROUND: Nonagenarians are typically considered poor operative candidates for 
major aortic intervention because of shorter life expectancy, multiple 
comorbidities, and increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. Endovascular 
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) has clearly been associated with a lower 
perioperative morbidity and mortality in most anatomically suitable patients. 
There have been many reports of the technical success of EVAR in octogenarians, 
but few documenting EVAR in nonagenarians. In this study, we sought to review 
our experience with elective EVAR in nonagenarians to determine outcomes, 
complications, and long-term survival after repair.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our prospectively maintained aneurysm 
database from 2000 to 2010 at an academic referral center. Fifteen patients ≥90 
years old underwent elective EVAR. No symptomatic or ruptured abdominal aortic 
aneurysm patients >90 years old were treated. Comorbidities, preoperative and 
postoperative functional status, aneurysm size, and technical success rate were 
all recorded in accordance with Society for Vascular Surgery reporting 
guidelines. Follow-up was performed within 30 days, 6 months, and annually 
thereafter unless more frequent follow-up was indicated.
RESULTS: Of the 749 EVAR procedures performed in the decade-long experience, 15 
nonagenarians underwent repair (14 male, 93%; mean age, 90.3 ± 0.6 years). Mean 
aneurysm diameter was 6.4 ± 1.45 cm with a median diameter of 5.8 cm (range 
4.5-8.8 cm). All patients were offered repair because of having good to 
excellent preoperative functional status with an average number of comorbidities 
per patient of 2.7. Immediate technical success rate was 100%. Median intensive 
care unit stay was 1 day (range 1-17 days). Mean length of stay was 4.6 ± 5.3 
days with a median of 3.5 days. Thirty-day mortality was 0%. Mean follow-up was 
35 months. Mean survival was 56 months. Overall survival estimated annually 
extending out to 5 years was 91.7%, 83.3%, 71.4%, 57.1%, and 38.1%, 
respectively. Thirty-day rate of any complication was 40%, with a 20% 
readmission rate, with many of the issues being related to wound complications. 
On follow-up imaging there were noted to be 4 (27%) type I, 9 (60%) type II, and 
no type III or type IV endoleaks identified. Overall reintervention rate was 
27%. No ruptures were noted in the postoperative period or long-term follow-up, 
and there were no conversions to open surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a median survival of 56.2 months in this carefully 
selected cohort of EVAR in nonagenarians. As techniques and technology improve 
and evolve, and particularly as devices become lower profile, there is the 
potential to apply EVAR to the increasingly older population. If perioperative 
morbidity can be minimized and the patient has good functional status, EVAR can 
be a safe procedure and provide rupture-free survival.

Australia's oldest old are potentially being harmed by the under- and over- use 
of statins. Variations in prescription of statins are in part due to the vacuum 
of clinical research trial evidence and paucity of contemporary guidelines that 
are needed to address the use of lipid lowering therapy in the oldest old. There 
are a few randomised placebo-controlled trials that recruited an older 
population. Therefore evidence of statins efficacy in the oldest old is based on 
an extrapolation of results from those studies. The extensive exclusion criteria 
of those studies, the relative youth of the study participants, the low levels 
of comorbidity and functional impairment limit the external validity and the 
generalisability of the findings. Current guidelines are silent or generally 
non-specific about statin therapy for the oldest old deferring decisions to 
individual medical practitioners. Life expectancy, time to benefit, functional 
status and medication related adverse events, polypharmacy, adherence to 
treatment are factors that need to be considered when forming appropriate 
guidelines for statin prescription in the very old. Well-designed clinical 
trials that account for the heterogeneity of this population are needed. While 
waiting for this research evidence better clinical guidelines are needed to 
address this issue.

OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of using 
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to manage obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) from the perspective of the U.K.'s 
National Health Service (NHS).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a case-control design, 150 CPAP-treated 
patients with OSA and T2D were randomly selected from The Health Improvement 
Network (THIN) database (a nationally representative database of patients 
registered with general practitioners in the U.K.) and matched with 150 OSA and 
T2D patients from the same database who were not treated with CPAP. The total 
NHS cost and outcomes of patient management in both groups over 5 years and the 
cost-effectiveness of CPAP compared with no CPAP treatment were estimated.
RESULTS: Using CPAP was associated with significantly lower blood pressure at 5 
years and increasingly lower HbA1c levels over 5 consecutive years compared with 
untreated OSA patients. At 5 years, the HbA1c level in the CPAP-treated group 
was 8.2% (66.0 mmol/mol) vs. 12.1% (108.4 mmol/mol) in the control group (P < 
0.03). Use of CPAP significantly increased patients' health status by 0.27 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient over 5 years (P < 0.001) and NHS 
management costs by £4,141 per patient over 5 years; the cost per QALY gained 
with CPAP was £15,337.
CONCLUSIONS: Initiating treatment with CPAP in OSA patients with T2D leads to 
significantly lower blood pressure and better controlled diabetes and affords a 
cost-effective use of NHS resources. These observations have the potential for 
treatment modification if confirmed in a prospective study.

PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of (99m)Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile 
(MIBI) thyroid scintigraphy and the Afirma gene expression classifier for the 
assessment of cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules.
METHODS: A decision tree model was used. Costs were calculated from the 
perspective of the German health insurance system. The robustness of the results 
was assessed with probabilistic sensitivity analyses using a Monte Carlo 
simulation.
RESULTS: Life expectancy was 34.3 years (estimated costs per patient €1,459 - 
€2,224) for the MIBI scan and 34.1 years (estimated costs €3,560 - €4,071) for 
the molecular test. These results were confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulation.
CONCLUSION: MIBI thyroid scintigraphy is more cost-effective than the gene 
expression classifier.

Estimated cause-specific survival continues to improve over time in patients 
with chondrosarcoma.

BACKGROUND: Conditional survival measures change in the risk of mortality given 
that a patient has survived a defined period of time. This has yet to be 
reported for chondrosarcoma of bone. This information should be of interest to 
the clinician and helpful in counseling patients with chondrosarcoma.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Our questions include the following: (1) Does the 
conditional survival of patients with local/regional chondrosarcoma improve with 
each additional year of survival? (2) Does the conditional survival of patients 
with metastatic chondrosarcoma improve with each additional year of survival? 
(3) Does tumor location, use of radiation, or patient age affect conditional 
survival? (4) Can chondrosarcoma ever be considered cured?
METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program 
database maintained by the National Cancer Institute to identify 2138 patients 
with chondrosarcoma of bone from 1973 to 2009. We used an actuarial life table 
analysis to explore differences in 5-year cause-specific survival estimates 
conditional on 1 to 5 years of survival. The cohort was stratified by grade, 
location (axial versus extremity), use of radiation, and age. Finally, we 
expanded the analysis to include survival estimates 20 years after diagnosis 
conditional on survival for 5 and 10 years.
RESULTS: The estimated survival for all grades of local/regional chondrosarcoma 
improved from baseline with each year of survival after diagnosis. At 5 years 
after diagnosis, local/regional Grade 1 chondrosarcoma displayed higher 
conditional survival than Grade 2 and 3 local/regional chondrosarcoma (97.2% 
[95% confidence interval {CI}, 95.2%-98.4%] versus 92.8% [95% CI, 89.5%-95.0%], 
p = 0.006 and 83.8% [95% CI, 69.9%-91.7%], p = 0.012). Estimated survival 
improved from baseline with each year of survival for all grades of metastatic 
chondrosarcoma. Conditional survival estimates for Grade 3 axial tumors failed 
to improve from baseline to 5 years after diagnosis (52.9% versus 70.2%, p > 
0.05) compared with Grade 3 extremity tumors at baseline and 5 years after 
diagnosis (58.1% versus 95.8%, p < 0.0001) The 20-year conditional survival 
estimates reveal that a cancer-specific risk of mortality exists even 10 years 
after diagnosis, suggesting that although the conditional survival increases 
considerably over time, it cannot be considered cured.
CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year conditional survival estimate for patients with 
chondrosarcoma improved with each additional year of survival regardless of 
grade, site, age, or use of radiation. At 10 years after diagnosis, deaths 
attributable to cancer were still present, and patients should be aware of this 
small long-term risk.

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants harvest sunlight to produce sugars 
from carbon dioxide and water. It is the primary source of energy for all life 
on Earth; hence it is important to understand how this process responds to 
climate change and human impact. However, model-based estimates of gross primary 
production (GPP, output from photosynthesis) are highly uncertain, in particular 
over heavily managed agricultural areas. Recent advances in spectroscopy enable 
the space-based monitoring of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from 
terrestrial plants. Here we demonstrate that spaceborne SIF retrievals provide a 
direct measure of the GPP of cropland and grassland ecosystems. Such a strong 
link with crop photosynthesis is not evident for traditional remotely sensed 
vegetation indices, nor for more complex carbon cycle models. We use SIF 
observations to provide a global perspective on agricultural productivity. Our 
SIF-based crop GPP estimates are 50-75% higher than results from 
state-of-the-art carbon cycle models over, for example, the US Corn Belt and the 
Indo-Gangetic Plain, implying that current models severely underestimate the 
role of management. Our results indicate that SIF data can help us improve our 
global models for more accurate projections of agricultural productivity and 
climate impact on crop yields. Extension of our approach to other ecosystems, 
along with increased observational capabilities for SIF in the near future, 
holds the prospect of reducing uncertainties in the modeling of the current and 
future carbon cycle.

The process by which excitatory neurons are generated and mature during the 
development of the cerebral cortex occurs in a stereotyped manner; coordinated 
neuronal birth, migration, and differentiation during embryonic and early 
postnatal life are prerequisites for selective synaptic connections that mediate 
meaningful neurotransmission in maturity. Normal cortical function depends upon 
the proper elaboration of neurons, including the initial extension of cellular 
processes that lead to the formation of axons and dendrites and the subsequent 
maturation of synapses. Here, we examine the role of cell-based signaling via 
the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA7 in guiding the extension and maturation of 
cortical dendrites. EphA7, localized to dendritic shafts and spines of pyramidal 
cells, is uniquely expressed during cortical neuronal development. On patterned 
substrates, EphA7 signaling restricts dendritic extent, with Src and Tsc1 
serving as downstream mediators. Perturbation of EphA7 signaling in vitro and in 
vivo alters dendritic elaboration: Dendrites are longer and more complex when 
EphA7 is absent and are shorter and simpler when EphA7 is ectopically expressed. 
Later in neuronal maturation, EphA7 influences protrusions from dendritic shafts 
and the assembling of synaptic components. Indeed, synaptic function relies on 
EphA7; the electrophysiological maturation of pyramidal neurons is delayed in 
cultures lacking EphA7, indicating that EphA7 enhances synaptic function. These 
results provide evidence of roles for Eph signaling, first in limiting the 
elaboration of cortical neuronal dendrites and then in coordinating the 
maturation and function of synapses.

Life expectancy in police officers: a comparison with the U.S. general 
population.

Violanti JM, Fekedulegn D, Hartley TA, Andrew ME, Gu JK, Burchfiel CM.

Previous epidemiological research indicates that police officers have an 
elevated risk of death relative to the general population overall and for 
several specific causes. Despite the increased risk for mortality found in 
previous research, controversy still exists over the life expectancy of police 
officers. The goal of the present study was to compare life expectancy of male 
police officers from Buffalo New York with the U.S. general male population 
utilizing an abridged life table method. On average, the life expectancy of 
Buffalo police officers in our sample was significantly lower than the U.S. 
population (mean difference in life expectancy = 21.9 years; 95% CI: 14.5-29.3; 
p < 0.0001). Life expectancy of police officers was shorter and differences were 
more pronounced in younger age categories. Additionally, police officers had a 
significantly higher average probability of death than did males in the general 
population (mean difference = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.26-0.54; p < 0.0001). The years of 
potential life lost (YPLL) for police officers was 21 times larger than that of 
the general population (Buffalo male officers vs. U.S. males = 21.7, 95% CI: 
5.8-37.7). Possible reasons for shorter life expectancy among police are 
discussed, including stress, shift work, obesity, and hazardous environmental 
work exposures.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vildagliptin plus metformin vs 
generic sulphonylurea plus metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
not controlled with metformin, from a Portuguese healthcare system perspective.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was constructed using risk equations from 
the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model with a 10,000-patient cohort 
and a lifetime horizon. The model predicted microvascular and macrovascular 
complications and mortality in yearly cycles. Patients entered the model as 
metformin monotherapy failures and switched to alternative treatments (metformin 
plus basal-bolus insulin and subsequently metformin plus intensive insulin) when 
glycated hemoglobin A1c >7.5% was reached. Baseline patient characteristics and 
clinical variables were derived from a Portuguese epidemiological study. Cost 
estimates were based on direct medical costs only. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model.
RESULTS: There were fewer non-fatal diabetes-related adverse events (AEs) in 
patients treated with metformin plus vildagliptin compared with patients treated 
with metformin plus sulphonylurea (6752 vs 6815). Addition of vildagliptin 
compared with sulphonylurea led to increased drug acquisition costs but reduced 
costs of AEs, managing morbidities, and monitoring patients. Treatment with 
metformin plus vildagliptin yielded a mean per-patient gain of 0.1279 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and a mean per-patient increase in total 
cost of €1161, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €9072 
per QALY. Univariate analyses showed that ICER values were robust and ranged 
from €4195 to €16,052 per QALY when different parameters were varied.
LIMITATIONS: The model excluded several diabetes-related morbidities, such as 
peripheral neuropathy and ulceration, and did not model second events. Patients 
were presumed to enter the model with no diabetes-related complications.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with metformin plus vildagliptin compared with metformin 
plus sulphonylurea is expected to result in a lower incidence of 
diabetes-related AEs and to be a cost-effective treatment strategy.

BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking, adiposity, unhealthy diet, heavy alcohol drinking 
and physical inactivity together are associated with about half of premature 
deaths in Western populations. The aim of this study was to estimate their 
individual and combined impacts on residual life expectancy (RLE).
METHODS: Lifestyle and mortality data from the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort, 
comprising 22,469 German adults ≥40 years and free of diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease and cancer at recruitment (1994-1998), were analyzed with multivariable 
Gompertz proportional hazards models to predict lifetime survival probabilities 
given specific baseline status of lifestyle risk factors. The life table method 
was then used to estimate the RLEs.
RESULTS: For 40-year-old adults, the most significant loss of RLE was associated 
with smoking (9.4 [95% confidence interval: 8.3, 10.6] years for male and 7.3 
[6.0, 8.9] years for female heavy smokers [>10 cigarettes/day]; 5.3 [3.6, 7.1] 
years for men and 5.0 [3.2, 6.6] years for women smoking ≤10 cigarettes/day). 
Other lifestyle risk factors associated with major losses of RLE were low body 
mass index (BMI <22.5 kg/m(2), 3.5 [1.8, 5.1] years for men; 2.1 [0.5, 3.6] 
years for women), obesity (BMI ≥30, 3.1 [1.9, 4.4] years for men; 3.2 [1.8, 5.1] 
years for women), heavy alcohol drinking (>4 drinks/day, 3.1 [1.9, 4.0] years 
for men), and high processed/red meat consumption (≥120 g/day, 2.4 [1.0, 3.9] 
years for women). The obesity-associated loss of RLE was stronger in male never 
smokers, while the loss of RLE associated with low BMI was stronger in current 
smokers. The loss of RLE associated with low leisure time physical activity was 
moderate for women (1.1 [0.05, 2.1] years) and negligible for men (0.4 [-0.3, 
1.2] years). The combined loss of RLE for heavy smoking, obesity, heavy alcohol 
drinking and high processed/red meat consumption, versus never smoking, optimal 
BMI (22.5 to 24.9), no/light alcohol drinking and low processed/red meat 
consumption, was 17.0 years for men and 13.9 years for women.
CONCLUSIONS: Promoting healthy lifestyles, particularly no cigarette smoking and 
maintaining healthy body weight, should be the core component of public health 
approaches to reducing premature deaths in Germany and similar affluent 
societies.

University, Beijing Institute of Heart, Lung and Blood Vessel Diseases, Beijing

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to analyze the impact of cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths 
on life expectancy (LE) in Chinese population and estimate the percentage 
reduction in CVD mortality needed to increase LE by 1 year from the current 
level, a national target of health improvement.
METHODS: We used life tables, cause-elimination life tables, and age 
decomposition of LE with corrected mortality data from the National Disease 
Surveillance System in 2010.
RESULTS: LE at birth of Chinese people was 73.24 years in 2010. Women had a 
longer LE than men, and urban population had a longer LE than rural population. 
CVD deaths resulted in a 4.79-year LE loss and premature deaths in people aged 
25 to 64 years were responsible for a substantial part of LE loss from CVD. 
Death from ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular diseases accounted for 
69.2% of LE loss from CVD deaths and death from cerebrovascular diseases was the 
largest contributor. In rural men, 51.1% LE loss from CVD deaths was caused by 
cerebrovascular diseases. If there were no changes in mortality rates for all 
other diseases, a 27.4% reduction in CVD mortality would increase LE by 1 year 
in Chinese population.
CONCLUSION: There is a considerable impact of CVD deaths on LE. A 1-year LE 
increase in the future requires at least a 27.4% reduction in CVD mortality from 
the current level. Targeting the rural population and tackling cerebrovascular 
diseases are important for reaching the national goal of health improvement.

Author information:

University, Beijing Institute of Heart, Lung and Blood Vessel Diseases, Beijing 
100029, China.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of cerebrovascular disease mortality on life 
expectancy (LE) in China in 2010 compared with 2005, and to identify the 
high-risk population (age, sex, and region) where cerebrovascular disease 
mortality has had a major impact on LE.
METHODS: LE and cause-eliminated LE were calculated by using standard life 
tables which used adjusted mortality data from the Death Surveillance Data Sets 
in 2005 and 2010 from the National Disease Surveillance System. Decomposition 
was used to quantitate the impact of cerebrovascular disease in different age 
groups.
RESULTS: LE in China was 73.24 years in 2010, which was higher in women and 
urban residents compared with men and rural residents. The loss of LE caused by 
cerebrovascular disease mortality was 2.26 years, which was higher in men and 
rural residents compared with women and urban residents. More than 30% of the 
loss of LE were attributed to premature death from cerebrovascular disease in 
people aged <65 years. Compared with 2005, LE in 2010 increased by 0.92 years. 
The reduction of cerebrovascular disease mortality in urban residents 
contributed 0.45 years to the increase of LE, but the increase of 
cerebrovascular disease mortality caused a 0.12-year loss of LE in rural 
residents.
CONCLUSION: Cerebrovascular disease mortality had a major impact on LE in China, 
with a significant difference between urban and rural residents. LE is likely to 
be further increased by reducing cerebrovascular disease mortality, and special 
attention should be paid to reducing premature deaths in people aged <65 years.

Life expectancy is assumed to rise continuously and consequently global burden 
of age-associated diseases is expected to increase. All vital organs begin to 
lose some function during aging with different rates, and the same happens on 
the lung. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory 
disease of the lungs, which progresses very slowly and the majority of patients 
are therefore elderly. COPD is a major and increasing global health problem with 
enormous amount of expenditure of indirect/direct health care costs, and 
therefore, there is urgent need to clarify the molecular mechanism of COPD and 
develop novel treatments. We here hypothesize that environmental gases, such as 
cigarette smoke and kitchen pollutants, may accelerate the aging of lung or 
worsen aging-related events in the lung, leading to defective resolution of 
inflammation, reduced anti-oxidant capacity and defective disposal of abnormal 
proteins, and this consequently induces progression of COPD. Recent studies 
identified some anti-aging small molecules (geroprotectors) that may open up new 
avenues for the treatment of COPD.

CONTEXT: The Palliative Prognostic Index (PPI) is among the most popular scores 
used to predict life expectancy in terminally ill patients worldwide. PPI 
assessed on the first day of palliative care might be inappropriate because the 
contribution from subsequent changes in a patient's condition are not taken into 
account.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine the utility of sequential PPI 
assessments as a better prognostic tool for patients with terminal cancer.
METHODS: In total, 2392 terminally ill cancer patients with initial and one-week 
PPI assessments under the palliative care consultation service between January 
2006 and December 2011 at a single medical center in Taiwan were selected. 
Patients were categorized into initial PPI, Week 1 PPI, score change (initial 
PPI - Week 1 PPI; Δscore), and combined initial PPI and Δscore subgroups for 
survival analysis.
RESULTS: Overall median survival was 32 days (range eight to 180 days), and 2183 
patients (91.3%) died within 180 days of palliative care consultation service 
care. A significant difference in survival was observed among patient subgroups 
(P < 0.001). Subgroup survival analysis showed significant difference in 
patients with Δscores >0, 0, and <0 in each prognostic group categorized by 
initial PPI. The c-statistic for predicting life expectancy <30 days was 
significantly higher with the combined initial PPI and Δscore (c-statistic, 
0.71; 95% CI, 0.694-0.731) than with the initial PPI (c-statistic, 0.63; 95% CI, 
0.61-0.65), Week 1 PPI (c-statistic, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.652-0.690), or Δscore 
(c-statistic, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.62-0.66).
CONCLUSION: Combination of initial PPI and score change is more useful than 
initial PPI for identifying patients with poor outcomes in good prognostic 
groups and patients with better outcomes in poor prognostic groups.

Cost-effectiveness of a 14-gene risk score assay to target adjuvant chemotherapy 
in early stage non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

Life Technologies has developed a 14-gene molecular assay that provides 
information about the risk of death in early stage non-squamous non-small cell 
lung cancer patients after surgery. The assay can be used to identify patients 
at highest risk of mortality, informing subsequent treatments. The objective of 
this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this novel assay. Patients 
and Methods. We developed a Markov model to estimate life expectancy, 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs for testing versus standard care. 
Risk-group classification was based on assay-validation studies, and 
chemotherapy uptake was based on pre- and post-testing recommendations from a 
study of 58 physicians. We evaluated three chemotherapy-benefit scenarios: 
moderately predictive (base case), nonpredictive (i.e., the same benefit for 
each risk group), and strongly predictive. We calculated the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and performed one-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses. Results. In the base case, testing and standard-care 
strategies resulted in 6.81 and 6.66 life years, 3.76 and 3.68 QALYs, and 
$122,400 and $118,800 in costs, respectively. The ICER was $23,200 per QALY 
(stage I: $29,200 per QALY; stage II: $12,200 per QALY). The ICER ranged from 
"dominant" to $92,100 per QALY in the strongly predictive and nonpredictive 
scenarios. The model was most sensitive to the proportion of high-risk patients 
receiving chemotherapy and the high-risk hazard ratio. The 14-gene risk score 
assay strategy was cost-effective in 68% of simulations. Conclusion. Our results 
suggest that the 14-gene risk score assay may be a cost-effective alternative to 
standard guideline-based adjuvant chemotherapy decision making in early stage 
non-small cell lung cancer.

Modern treatment strategies have increased life expectancy in multiple myeloma, 
but little is known about the endocrine, metabolic and nutritional status of 
long-term survivors. We performed endocrine, metabolic, bone, body composition 
and nutritional evaluations in 32 patients with intensively-treated, advanced 
but stable, myeloma a median duration of 6 years from diagnosis and three lines 
of intensive treatment, including at least one haematopoietic SCT procedure. All 
patients were off active treatment. There was a high prevalence of endocrine 
dysfunction: hypothyroidism (9%), hypogonadism (65% males) and elevated 
prolactin (19%). Adrenocortical function was preserved despite large cumulative 
corticosteroid pretreatment. Biochemical markers were consistent with 
postmenopausal status in all females and infertility in males. Nutritionally, 
59% were vitamin D insufficient/deficient, reduced serum folate in 25% and 
vitamin B12 in 6%. Total body DEXA scanning confirmed 'sarcopenic-obesity' in 
65%, but reduced bone density was seen in a minority. We conclude that 
potentially correctable endocrine, metabolic and nutritional abnormalities are 
prevalent in heavily-treated patients with stable multiple myeloma. Preservation 
of bone supports the efficacy of bisphosphonate treatment from diagnosis, but 
sarcopenic-obesity may contribute to frailty. Ultimately, multi-system screening 
and appropriate interventions may optimise quality of long-term survival and 
further studies are warranted.

Bisphosphonates (BPs), potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, 
play a major role in the management of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). 
However, in the case of dental infections, they can lead to bisphosphonate 
related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). This process can be worsened by 
concomitant antineoplastic therapy. Herein, we present a case of a 
life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis (NF) as a rare and severe complication of 
BRONJ after three cycles of lenalidomide and dexamethasone in an MM patient 
treated with corticosteroid therapy and Ibandronate for 5 years. The patient 
presented swelling on the right part of the neck, difficulty in swallowing and 
acute pain, so a magnetic resonance of the head and neck region was performed. 
It revealed the presence of an NF with a massive extension. Due to the large 
necrotic area and a rapid progression of the infection, the necrotic tissue had 
to be removed surgically. Furthermore, a specific antimicrobial treatment as 
well as 12 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy were needed to cure the 
patient. Herein, we highlight the potential serious adverse events associated 
with the use of bisphosphonates and antiangiogenetic drugs in patients with MM. 
Future studies are needed to evaluate the potential synergistic effects of BPs, 
corticosteroids and antiangiogenetic drugs.

Soft tissue sarcomas are rare, reaching some 1.5% of all malignant tumors. While 
formerly the surgical management of sarcomas almost exclusively consisted of 
amputation, in the recent years limb saving surgery has become the first choice 
of therapy. Negative factors affecting the survival rate are: histologically 
high-grade tumor, size and localization of the tumor, vascular invasion, 
extensive tumor necrosis, certain subgroups, local recurrence and oncologically 
positive surgical margin at the resection. Many modern reconstruction 
possibilities are essential for the safe limb saving surgery with wide surgical 
margins, such as bone allograft implantation, tumor endoprostheses 
reconstruction, vascular grafting and plastic surgery. There should always be an 
attempt to perform limb saving surgery, however life quality, life expectancy 
and survival are more important considerations influencing essentially the 
surgical method of choice. In our follow-up study no significant difference in 
recurrence rate was found between the group of patients with sarcomas requiring 
a complex reconstruction procedure and the group of those treated by only 
resection methods (32% versus 47%).

[A study of "sudden death" in end-stage cancer patients receiving home care].

[Article in Japanese]

Suzuki M, Ishimaki S, Yamazaki F.

We retrospectively examined the actual status and management of sudden changes 
in end-stage cancer patients receiving home care. We defined "sudden death" as 
an incident in which patients who had been ambulatory suddenly experienced a 
change in condition and died within a day. As per this definition, 32 of 130 
end-stage cancer patients (24.6%) who died at home during a period of 2 years 
experienced "sudden death". The reasons for sudden changes included liver 
rupture, liver failure, hematemesis/melena, and renal failure. It was presumed 
that 87.5% of patients who experienced "sudden death" had a life expectancy of 
days or weeks. Those who experienced sudden change in the presence of their 
family and died immediately thereafter or were found in a state of respiratory 
arrest accounted for 43.8% of cases. At the time of sudden change, sedation was 
performed in 34.3% of cases. Patient families were generally able to take action 
in a calm manner. Healthcare professionals and patient families should always be 
aware of the possibility of sudden changes in end-stage cancer patients. In 
addition, it is important for healthcare professionals to confirm how patients 
and their families perceive the disease condition, provide pain relief, and 
support families who are upset and anxious at the time of sudden changes.

[Barriers to providing assistance and making arrangements for being discharged 
from the hospital or changing hospitals while undergoing cancer therapy for 
patients in a state of depression--perspective of a psycho-oncologist (Part 4)].

[Article in Japanese]

Takayanagi H, Hanawa K, Kimura T.

In the treatment of cancer, living at home for as long as possible is an 
important aspect. During home care, many patients experience symptoms of 
dementia, depression, adjustment disorder, and mental disorder. There are 3 
critical stages: the initial announcement of the diagnosis of cancer, the 
announcement of the occurrence of relapse, and the announcement regarding the 
lack of effective treatment. Listening carefully to complaints of patients 
during all stages will be helpful. With regard to how palliative care for cancer 
patients is perceived, we encountered a case of a patient who showed adjustment 
disorders when his life expectancy was deemed too short. By paying attention to 
what the patient was saying, we were able to help the patient overcome the 
critical state and continue receiving home care. During the treatment of cancer, 
patients receive bad news several times. It is difficult to maintain mental 
stability at such times. As seen in this case, resolution of adjustment disorder 
in 10 days is very rare. However, the patient confessed that, during the course 
of treatment, psychological care was not given appropriately. The best 
treatments for cancer were provided. However, the patient did not know how to 
deal with anxiety. This is an example that elicits sympathy.

[Total knee arthroplasty. Prognosis after restoring the joint line].

[Article in Spanish]

Vera-Avilés FA, Jiménez-Aquino JM.

BACKGROUND: The overall increase in the population's life expectancy resulting 
from technologic development and health advances, among other things, has led to 
an increased demand for primary total knee arthroplasty in recent decades. The 
patient's preoperative clinical status should be assessed and preoperative 
planning should be performed. The importance of the knee joint line has been 
underestimated in the patient's clinical course; restoring it is vital for the 
survival of a recently placed prosthesis. The purpose of this study is to 
clinically and radiographically correlate the importance of restoring the joint 
line in total knee arthroplasties performed at Hospital Regional "Lic. Adolfo 
López Mateos".
METHODS: A prospective study was conducted of patients who underwent total knee 
arthroplasty at Hospital Regional "Lic. Adolfo López Mateos" from January to 
July 2010. Patients underwent X-rays preoperatively and 6 months after surgery 
to determine whether the joint line had been restored using Hoffman's method. 
Restoration was considered as acceptable when a +/- 4mm balance was obtained.
RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were studied, 17 males and 15 females; in 18 the 
postoperative alignment was considered as normal (+/- 4 mm), group 1, and in 14 
the alignment was outside of this range, group 2. One patient had a -4 mm 
postoperative alignment and 13 were within the +4 mm range. The joint line is an 
indispensable parameter in the clinical course of patients who underwent total 
knee arthroplasty, as this allows for an appropriate range of motion, better 
collateral ligament stability, better weight bearing of loading surfaces and, as 
a result of this, a longer duration of the primary knee prosthesis.

Surgical treatment in familial adenomatous polyposis.

Tudyka VN(1), Clark SK(1).

Author information:
(1)The Polyposis Registry, St. Mark's Hospital, Harrow, UK.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a dominantly inherited condition caused 
by germline mutation of the APC gene resulting in formation of numerous large 
bowel adenomas in late childhood or adolescence. Unless these are removed, 
colorectal cancer inevitably develops. Prophylactic surgical treatment is 
required to prevent this. In surgical decision making, considerations should 
include genotype-phenotype correlation, perioperative morbidity and risk of 
impaired sexual and reproductive function in young patients after major pelvic 
surgery. Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis remains an appropriate 
prophylactic procedure in many patients. However, in those with high-density 
polyposis or a genotype predictive of aggressive disease, restorative 
proctocolectomy is preferable. There is a range of other features, as FAP is
