life-threatening manifestations are aortic aneurysms leading to dissection and 
rupture. Other cardiovascular complications, including mitral valve prolapse, 
primary cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia, also occur more frequently in patients 
with MFS. The standard medical care relies on cardiovascular imaging at regular 
intervals, along with pharmacological treatment with β-adrenergic receptor 
blockers aimed at reducing the aortic growth rate. When aortic dilatation 
reaches a threshold associated with increased risk of dissection, prophylactic 
surgical aortic replacement is performed. Although current clinical management 
has significantly improved the life expectancy of patients with MFS, no cure is 
available and fatal complications still occur, underscoring the need for new 
treatment options. In recent years, preclinical studies have identified a number 
of potentially promising therapeutic targets. Nevertheless, the translation of 
these results into clinical practice has remained challenging. In this review, 
we present an overview of the currently available knowledge regarding the 
underlying pathophysiological processes associated with MFS cardiovascular 
pathology. We then summarize the treatment options that have been developed 
based on this knowledge and are currently in different stages of preclinical or 
clinical development, provide a critical review of the limitations of current 
studies and highlight potential opportunities for future research.

To improve the life quality of forearm amputees, prosthetic hands with high 
accuracy, and robustness are necessary. The application of surface 
electromyography (sEMG) signals to control a prosthetic hand is challenging. In 
this study, we proposed a time-domain CNN model for the regression prediction of 
joint angles in three degrees of freedom (3-DOFs, include two wrist joint motion 
and one finger joint motion), and five-fold cross validation was used to 
evaluate the correlation coefficient (CC). The CC value results of wrist 
flexion/extension motion obtained from 10 participants was 0.87-0.92, 
pronation/supination motion was 0.72-0.95, and hand grip/open motion was 
0.75-0.94. We backtracked the fully connected layer weights to create a geometry 
plot for analyzing the motion pattern to investigate the learning of the 
proposed model. In order to discuss the daily updateability of the model by 
transfer learning, we performed a second experiment on five of the participants 
in another day and conducted transfer learning based on smaller amount of 
dataset. The CC results improved (wrist flexion/extension was 0.90-0.97, 
pronation/supination was 0.84-0.96, hand grip/open was 0.85-0.92), suggesting 
the effectiveness of the transfer learning by incorporating the small amounts of 
sEMG data acquired in different days. We compared our CNN-based model with four 
conventional regression models, the result illustrates that proposed model 
significantly outperforms the four conventional models with and without transfer 
learning. The offline result suggests the reliability of the proposed model in 
real-time control in different days, it can be applied for real-time prosthetic 
control in the future.

BACKGROUND: Decisions on funding new healthcare technologies assume that all 
health improvements are valued equally. However, public reaction to health 
technology assessment (HTA) decisions suggests there are health attributes that 
matter deeply to them but are not currently accounted for in the assessment 
process. We aimed to determine the relative importance of attributes of illness 
that influence the value placed on alleviating that illness.
METHOD: We conducted a discrete choice experiment survey that presented general 
public respondents with 15 funding decisions between hypothetical health 
conditions. The conditions were defined by five attributes that characterise 
serious illnesses, plus the health gain from treatment. Respondent preferences 
were modelled using conditional logistic regression and latent class analysis.
RESULTS: 905 members of the UK public completed the survey in November 2017. 
Respondents generally preferred to provide treatments for conditions with 
'better' characteristics. The exception was treatment availability, where 
respondents preferred to provide treatments for conditions where there is no 
current treatment, and were prepared to accept lower overall health gain to do 
so. A subgroup of respondents preferred to prioritise 'worse' health states.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests a preference among the UK public for treating an 
unmet need; however, it does not suggest a preference for prioritising other 
distressing aspects of health conditions, such as limited life expectancy, or 
where patients are reliant on care. Our results are not consistent with the 
features currently prioritised in UK HTA processes, and the preference 
heterogeneity we identify presents a major challenge for developing broadly 
acceptable policy.

anxiety disorders, depression and co-morbid unhealthy lifestyle behaviours: a 
randomised controlled pilot trial.

BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of patients receiving cognitive behavioural 
therapy (CBT) do not achieve remission, and drop-out is considerable. 
Motivational interviewing (MI) may influence non-response and drop-out. Previous 
research shows that MI as a pre-treatment to CBT produces moderate effects 
compared with CBT alone. Studies integrating MI with CBT (MI-CBT) are scarce.
AIMS: To test the feasibility of MI-CBT in terms of therapist competence in MI 
and various participant measures, including recruitment and retention. In 
addition, separate preliminary evaluations were conducted, exploring the effects 
of CBT alone for anxiety disorders and depression, and of MI-CBT for anxiety 
disorders, depression and unhealthy lifestyle behaviours.
METHOD: Using a randomised controlled parallel trial design, participants were 
recruited in routine psychiatric care and allocated to CBT alone or MI-CBT. 
Means in feasibility measures and within-condition Hedges' g effect sizes in 
treatment outcome measures were calculated. Authors were not blind to treatment 
allocation, while independent raters were blind.
RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were assessed for eligibility, and 49 were 
included. Participant perceptions of treatment credibility, expectancy for 
improvement, and working alliance were similar for both conditions. Overall, 
effect sizes were large across outcome measures for both conditions, including 
anxiety and depressive symptoms and functional impairment. However, therapists 
did not acquire sufficient competence in MI and the drop-out rate was high.
CONCLUSIONS: MI-CBT proved feasible in some respects, but the present study did 
not support the progression to a randomised controlled trial designed to assess 
the effectiveness of MI-CBT. Additional pilot studies are needed.

The SARS-CoV-2 S protein on the membrane of infected cells can promote 
receptor-dependent syncytia formation, relating to extensive tissue damage and 
lymphocyte elimination. In this case, it is challenging to obtain neutralizing 
antibodies and prevent them through antibodies effectively. Considering that, in 
the current study, structural domain search methods are adopted to analyze the 
SARS-CoV-2 S protein to find the fusion mechanism. The results show that after 
the EF-hand domain of S protein bound to calcium ions, S2 protein had CaMKII 
protein activities. Besides, the CaMKII_AD domain of S2 changed S2 conformation, 
facilitating the formation of HR1-HR2 six-helix bundles. Apart from that, the 
Ca2+-ATPase of S2 pumped calcium ions from the virus cytoplasm to help membrane 
fusion, while motor structures of S drove the CaATP_NAI and CaMKII_AD domains to 
extend to the outside and combined the viral membrane and the cell membrane, 
thus forming a calcium bridge. Furthermore, the phospholipid-flipping-ATPase 
released water, triggering lipid mixing and fusion and generating fusion pores. 
Then, motor structures promoted fusion pore extension, followed by the 
cytoplasmic contents of the virus being discharged into the cell cytoplasm. 
After that, the membrane of the virus slid onto the cell membrane along the 
flowing membrane on the gap of the three CaATP_NAI. At last, the HR1-HR2 hexamer 
would fall into the cytoplasm or stay on the cell membrane. Therefore, the 
CaMKII_like system of S protein facilitated membrane fusion for further inducing 
syncytial multinucleated giant cells.

The actual standard treatment for mild-to-moderately severe Alzheimer's disease 
only attacks its symptoms. Masitinib is a potent and selective 
phenylaminothiazole-type tyrosine kinase inhibitor which is currently in Phase 
III studies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with the aim of 
modifying its evolution and with multiple pharmacological targets such as 
inhibition of mast cells activity, inhibition of microglia activation, 
modulation of Aβ and Tau protein signaling pathway and prevention of synaptic 
damage. Here, we review the preclinical and clinical studies that investigated 
the administration of masitinib treatment in monotherapy in AD. All research 
studies revealed positive effects concerning the cognitive functions in AD and 
generally with good safety and tolerability.

Plain Language Summary: Lay abstract In the 21st century, life expectancy has 
increased a lot in developed countries but so has the number of people who are 
diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD causes a decline in brain function 
over time and is the main cause of death and disability in elderly people. 
Current treatments only improve the symptoms of the disease but do not cure or 
stop the disease getting worse. For this reason, new treatments are being 
developed including the drug masitinib which is in Phase III in clinical trials. 
Masitinib protects specific brain and nervous system cells from being damaged by 
the disease. Results from current research into masitinib suggest that it can 
improve cognitive processes in AD patients. This article summarizes results from 
masitinib clinical and preclinical studies.

The objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of staging PET/CT in 
early-stage follicular lymphoma (FL) from the Canadian health-care system 
perspective. Methods: The study population was FL patients staged as early-stage 
using conventional CT imaging and planned for curative-intent radiation therapy 
(RT). A decision analytic model simulated the management after adding staging 
PET/CT versus using staging CT alone. In the no-PET/CT strategy, all patients 
proceeded to curative-intent RT as planned. In the PET/CT strategy, PET/CT 
information could result in an increased RT volume, switching to a noncurative 
approach, or no change in RT treatment as planned. The subsequent disease course 
was described using a state-transition cohort model over a 30-y time horizon. 
Diagnostic characteristics, probabilities, utilities, and costs were derived 
from the literature. Baseline analysis was performed using quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs), costs (2019 Canadian dollars), and the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted, 
evaluating net monetary benefit at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 10,000 simulations was 
performed. Costs and QALYs were discounted at a rate of 1.5%. Results: In the 
reference case scenario, staging PET/CT was the dominant strategy, resulting in 
an average lifetime cost saving of $3,165 and a gain of 0.32 QALYs. In 
deterministic sensitivity analyses, the PET/CT strategy remained the preferred 
strategy for all scenarios supported by available data. In probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis, the PET/CT strategy was strongly dominant in 77% of 
simulations (i.e., reduced cost and increased QALYs) and was cost-effective in 
89% of simulations (i.e., either saved costs or had an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio below $100,000/QALY). Conclusion: Our analysis showed 
that the use of PET/CT to stage early-stage FL patients reduces cost and 
improves QALYs. Patients with early-stage FL should undergo PET/CT before 
curative-intent RT.

PURPOSE: Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use for the prevention of 
thromboembolic complications in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation 
(AF) has increased steadily in Finland. DOACs have been shown to be 
cost-effective in comparison to warfarin, but published evidence of relative 
cost-effectiveness between DOACs is still scarce and mostly based on indirect 
comparisons of clinical trial evidence. The aim of this study was to compare the 
cost-effectiveness of apixaban to dabigatran, rivaroxaban and warfarin in a 
Finnish setting using real-life evidence where available.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A lifetime Markov simulation model used previously in a 
published Finnish assessment comparing apixaban and warfarin was modified and 
updated with the relative effectiveness and safety data available from the 
real-world NAXOS-study and representative Finnish input data for patient 
characteristics, event risks, mortality, resource use, costs, and quality of 
life. Apixaban's cost-effectiveness was assessed from health care payer 
perspective (using 3% per year discount rate) based on incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, cost per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] 
gained), probability of cost-effectiveness (at willingness-to-pay [WTP] of 
35,000 euros/QALY), and net monetary benefit (NMB).
RESULTS: Apixaban increased the average modelled quality-adjusted 
life-expectancy and reduced the average total health care costs of AF patients 
when compared to warfarin (+0.14 QALYs, -3691 euros), dabigatran (+0.11 QALYs, 
-404 euros), and rivaroxaban (+0.03 QALYs, -43 euros). The resulting NMB of 
apixaban versus warfarin, dabigatran and rivaroxaban was 8723, 4168, and 1129 
euros, respectively. The respective probabilities of apixaban being 
cost-effective against each comparator were 100%, 92.7%, and 64.0%.
CONCLUSION: In this modelling study, apixaban dominated other anticoagulants in 
the Finnish real-life setting.

The multilayer perceptron (MLP) topology of an artificial neural network (ANN) 
was applied to create two predictor models in Agrobacterium-mediated gene 
transformation of tobacco. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation parameters, 
including Agrobacterium strain, Agrobacterium cell density, acetosyringone 
concentration, and inoculation duration, were assigned as inputs for ANN-MLP, 
and their effects on the percentage of putative and PCR-verified transgenic 
plants were investigated. The best ANN models for predicting the percentage of 
putative and PCR-verified transgenic plants were selected based on basic network 
quality statistics. Ex-post error calculations of the relative approximation 
error (RAE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the root mean square error (RMS), 
and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) demonstrated the prediction 
quality of the developed models when compared to stepwise multiple regression. 
Moreover, significant correlations between the ANN-predicted and the actual 
values of the percentage of putative transgenes (R 2 = 0.956) and the percentage 
of PCR-verified transgenic plants (R 2 = 0.671) indicate the superiority of the 
established ANN models over the classical stepwise multiple regression in 
predicting the percentage of putative (R 2 = 0.313) and PCR-verified (R 2= 
0.213) transgenic plants. The best combination of the multiple inputs analyzed 
in this investigation, to achieve maximum actual and predicted transgenic 
plants, was at OD 600 = 0.8 for the LB4404 strain of Agrobacterium × 300 μmol/L 
acetosyringone × 20 min immersion time. According to the sensitivity analysis of 
ANN models, the Agrobacterium strain was the most important influential 
parameter in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of tobacco. The prediction 
efficiency of the developed model was confirmed by the data series of 
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of an important medicinal plant with low 
transformation efficiency. The results of this study are pivotal to model and 
predict the transformation of other important Agrobacterium-recalcitrant plant 
genotypes and to increase the transformation efficiency by identifying critical 
parameters. This approach can substantially reduce the time and cost required to 
optimize multi-factorial Agrobacterium-mediated transformation strategies.

PARTICIPANTS: Adults (n = 400) discharged to community, non-institutional living 
following acute stroke.
INTERVENTIONS: The Take Charge intervention, a strengths based, self-directed 
rehabilitation intervention, in two doses (one or two sessions), and a control 
intervention (no Take Charge sessions).
MEASURES: The cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved for the period 
between randomisation (always post hospital discharge) and 12 months following 
acute stroke. QALYs were calculated from the EuroQol-5D-5L. Costs of 
stroke-related and non-health care were obtained by questionnaire, hospital 
records and the New Zealand Ministry of Health.
RESULTS: One-year post hospital discharge cost of care was mean (95% CI) $US4706 
(3758-6014) for the Take Charge intervention group and $6118 (4350-8005) for 
control, mean (95% CI) difference $ -1412 (-3553 to +729). Health utility scores 
were mean (95% CI) 0.75 (0.73-0.77) for Take Charge and 0.71 (0.67-0.75) for 
control, mean (95% CI) difference 0.04 (0.0-0.08). Cost per QALY gained for the 
Take Charge intervention was $US -35,296 (=£ -25,524, € -30,019). Sensitivity 
analyses confirm Take Charge is cost-effective, even at a very low 
willingness-to-pay threshold. With a threshold of $US5000 per QALY, the 
probability that Take Charge is cost-effective is 99%.
CONCLUSION: Take Charge is cost-effective and probably cost saving.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a unique tumor that has a distinct clinical 
behavior and dismal prognosis. If untreated, it can become aggressively 
malignant, and life expectancy could be limited to weeks. Spontaneous regression 
of lung cancer has rarely been reported, and among them SCLC is even rarer. The 
underlying mechanisms of spontaneous regression are poorly understood. Here, we 
report a case of complete spontaneous SCLC remission in an elderly patient.

and Environment, The University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, USA.

BACKGROUND: Culinary medicine (CM) or culinary nutrition (CN) education provided 
to professionals with the capacity to influence behaviour change is an emerging 
strategy to promote diet quality and reduce the burden of diet related chronic 
disease in adults. The purpose of this scoping review was to synthesise current 
research describing CM/CN education provided to or by health, education and 
culinary professionals, or students of these disciplines.
METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis 
extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was used. Eleven electronic databases 
were searched in March 2019. Included studies were: (i) nutrition, health or 
lifestyle programs with a CM/CN component; (ii) study participants or programs 
facilitated by people working or training in health, community and/or adult 
education, or culinary roles where facilitator training was described; (iii) 
reported in the English language; and (iv) published from 2003.
RESULTS: In total, 33 studies were included. Nineteen studies delivered programs 
to general population groups and were facilitated by health professionals and/or 
health university students. Fourteen studies delivered CM/CN training to health 
professionals or students. Studies reported changes in participants' culinary 
skill and nutrition knowledge (n = 18), changes in dietary intake (n = 13), 
attitudes and behaviour change in healthy eating and cooking (n = 4), and 
competency in nutrition counselling and knowledge (n = 7).
CONCLUSIONS: Further research examining the effectiveness of CM/CN programs, and 
that describes optimal content, format and timing of the programs, is needed. 
Research evaluating the impact of training in CM/CN to education and culinary 
professionals on healthy cooking behaviours of their patients/clients is 
warranted.

BACKGROUND: Routine use of adjunct intraprocedural fresh frozen biopsy (FFP) or 
point-of-care (POC) cytology at the time of image-guided biopsy can improve 
diagnostic tissue yields for musculoskeletal neoplasms, but these are associated 
with increased costs.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to ascertain the most cost-effective adjunctive test 
for image-guided biopsies of musculoskeletal neoplasms.
METHODS: This expected value cost-effectiveness microsimulation compared the 
payoffs of cost (2020 United States dollars) and effectiveness (quality-adjusted 
life, in days) on each of the competing strategies. A literature review and 
institutional data were used to ascertain probabilities, diagnostic yields, 
utility values, and direct medical costs associated with each strategy. Payer 
and societal perspectives are presented. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses 
evaluated model uncertainties.
RESULTS: The total cost and effectiveness for each of the strategies were 
$1248.98, $1414.09, $1980.53, and 80.31, 79.74, 79.69 days for the use of FFP, 
permanent pathology only, and POC cytology, respectively. The use of FFP 
dominated the competing strategies. Sensitivity analyses revealed FFP as the 
most cost-effective across all clinically plausible values.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjunct FFP is most cost-effective in improving the diagnostic 
yield of image-guided biopsies for musculoskeletal neoplasms. These findings are 
robust to sensitivity analyses using clinically plausible probabilities.

BACKGROUND: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown activity in osteosarcoma and 
might enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy. We aimed to determine the 
recommended phase 2 dose and antitumour activity of lenvatinib with etoposide 
plus ifosfamide in patients with refractory or relapsed osteosarcoma.
METHODS: This multicentre, open-label, multicohort, phase 1/2 trial was done at 
17 hospitals in six countries. Eligible patients were aged 2-25 years, had 
relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma, measurable or evaluable disease per 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, Lansky 
play-performance score or Karnofsky performance score of 50% or higher, up to 
one previous VEGF or VEGF receptor-targeted therapy, and a life expectancy of at 
least 3 months. This study includes a combination dose-finding phase 1 part 
(cohort 3A) and a phase 2 combination expansion in patients with osteosarcoma 
(cohort 3B). Lenvatinib was administered orally at a starting dose of 11 mg/m2 
per day, capped at 24 mg per day, and etoposide (100 mg/m2 per day) plus 
ifosfamide (3000 mg/m2 per day) were administered intravenously on days 1-3 of 
each 21-day cycle for a maximum of five cycles. Lenvatinib monotherapy continued 
after these five cycles until disease progression, toxic effects, or patient 
choice to discontinue. The phase 1 primary endpoint was to determine the 
recommended phase 2 dose by evaluating dose-limiting toxicity and the phase 2 
primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 4 months. Progression-free 
survival was measured in the full analysis set, which included all patients 
enrolled for efficacy outcomes; safety was assessed in all patients who received 
any study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02432274.
FINDINGS: 30 patients were screened for enrolment into cohort 3A between May 9, 
2016, and June 3, 2019, and 22 patients for enrolment into cohort 3B between 
Sept 13, 2018, and July 18, 2019. Eight patients from cohort 3A and two from 
cohort 3B were ineligible for enrolment in the study. In phase 1, dose-limiting 
toxicities were observed in three patients (one in the lenvatinib 11 mg/m2 
combination group and two in the 14 mg/m2 combination group) and the recommended 
phase 2 dose was determined as lenvatinib 14 mg/m2 per day (with daily dose cap 
of 24 mg) and etoposide 100 mg/m2 per day plus ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2 per day 
administered intravenously on days 1-3 of each 21-day cycle for a maximum of 
five cycles. 35 patients from phase 1 (cohort 3A; n=15) and phase 2 (cohort 3B; 
n=20) were treated at the recommended phase 2 dose and their results were 
pooled. Progression-free survival at 4 months was 51% (95% CI 34-69) in 18 of 35 
patients per the binomial estimate. The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent 
adverse events were neutropenia (27 [77%] of 35), thrombocytopenia (25 [71%]), 
anaemia (19 [54%]), and decreased white blood cell count (19 [54%]). 26 [74%] of 
35 patients had serious treatment-emergent adverse events and no 
treatment-related deaths occurred.
INTERPRETATION: Lenvatinib with etoposide plus ifosfamide shows promising 
antitumour activity with no new safety signals in patients with refractory and 
relapsed osteosarcoma. These findings warrant further investigation in an 
ongoing randomised phase 2 study (NCT04154189).

BACKGROUND: Sustainable Development Goal 3.2 has targeted elimination of 
preventable child mortality, reduction of neonatal death to less than 12 per 
1000 livebirths, and reduction of death of children younger than 5 years to less 
than 25 per 1000 livebirths, for each country by 2030. To understand current 
rates, recent trends, and potential trajectories of child mortality for the next 
decade, we present the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study (GBD) 2019 findings for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality 
in children younger than 5 years of age, with multiple scenarios for child 
mortality in 2030 that include the consideration of potential effects of 
COVID-19, and a novel framework for quantifying optimal child survival.
METHODS: We completed all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality analyses 
from 204 countries and territories for detailed age groups separately, with 
aggregated mortality probabilities per 1000 livebirths computed for neonatal 
mortality rate (NMR) and under-5 mortality rate (U5MR). Scenarios for 2030 
represent different potential trajectories, notably including potential effects 
of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential impact of improvements preferentially 
targeting neonatal survival. Optimal child survival metrics were developed by 
age, sex, and cause of death across all GBD location-years. The first metric is 
a global optimum and is based on the lowest observed mortality, and the second 
is a survival potential frontier that is based on stochastic frontier analysis 
of observed mortality and Healthcare Access and Quality Index.
FINDINGS: Global U5MR decreased from 71·2 deaths per 1000 livebirths (95% 
uncertainty interval [UI] 68·3-74·0) in 2000 to 37·1 (33·2-41·7) in 2019 while 
global NMR correspondingly declined more slowly from 28·0 deaths per 1000 live 
births (26·8-29·5) in 2000 to 17·9 (16·3-19·8) in 2019. In 2019, 136 (67%) of 
204 countries had a U5MR at or below the SDG 3.2 threshold and 133 (65%) had an 
NMR at or below the SDG 3.2 threshold, and the reference scenario suggests that 
by 2030, 154 (75%) of all countries could meet the U5MR targets, and 139 (68%) 
could meet the NMR targets. Deaths of children younger than 5 years totalled 
9·65 million (95% UI 9·05-10·30) in 2000 and 5·05 million (4·27-6·02) in 2019, 
with the neonatal fraction of these deaths increasing from 39% (3·76 million 
[95% UI 3·53-4·02]) in 2000 to 48% (2·42 million; 2·06-2·86) in 2019. NMR and 
U5MR were generally higher in males than in females, although there was no 
statistically significant difference at the global level. Neonatal disorders 
remained the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years in 2019, 
followed by lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, congenital birth 
defects, and malaria. The global optimum analysis suggests NMR could be reduced 
to as low as 0·80 (95% UI 0·71-0·86) deaths per 1000 livebirths and U5MR to 1·44 
(95% UI 1·27-1·58) deaths per 1000 livebirths, and in 2019, there were as many 
as 1·87 million (95% UI 1·35-2·58; 37% [95% UI 32-43]) of 5·05 million more 
deaths of children younger than 5 years than the survival potential frontier.
INTERPRETATION: Global child mortality declined by almost half between 2000 and 
2019, but progress remains slower in neonates and 65 (32%) of 204 countries, 
mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, are not on track to meet either SDG 
3.2 target by 2030. Focused improvements in perinatal and newborn care, 
continued and expanded delivery of essential interventions such as vaccination 
and infection prevention, an enhanced focus on equity, continued focus on 
poverty reduction and education, and investment in strengthening health systems 
across the development spectrum have the potential to substantially improve 
U5MR. Given the widespread effects of COVID-19, considerable effort will be 
required to maintain and accelerate progress.
