The evolution towards a green economy integrating social, economic, and 
environmental concerns has opened a new window to pursue the sustainable 
development goals (SDGs), especially for emerging nations. Nonetheless, despite 
being a pressing concern on a global scale, empirical research into the 
potential for green economy development in the context of Bangladesh has 
remained notably inadequate. To fill this void, this study is an attempt to 
evaluate the connection among economic growth, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, 
education, life expectancy, and technology to conclude the ecological and 
socio-economic repercussions of a green economy in Bangladesh's framework of 
achieving SDGs. Considering the statistical features of the annual data from 
1990 to 2019, the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method has been employed 
to analyze the connections between the chosen variables. The empirical outcomes 
show that an upsurge in CO2 is accompanied by a 3.66% increase in GDP over the 
long term, suggesting a positive and statistically significant relationship 
between the two variables. In addition, GDP increases by about 4.2% for every 1% 
increase in life expectancy. However, the relationship between technological 
innovation and education found an insignificant positive linkage with GDP. The 
most important takeaway from these findings is that the growth of Bangladesh's 
economy is occurring at the expense of the environment. Hence, this research 
recommends that, as a developing nation, Bangladesh should concentrate on 
environment-friendly alternatives, which can be done through the introduction of 
a green economy to achieve a sustainably developed economy.

Glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD1a) is caused by a congenital deficiency of 
glucose-6-phosphatase-alpha (G6Pase-α, encoded by G6PC), primarily associated 
with life-threatening hypoglycemia. Although strict dietary management 
substantially improves the life expectancy, patients still suffer from 
intermittent hypoglycemia and develop hepatic complications. Emerging therapies 
utilizing new modalities such as adeno-associated virus and mRNA with lipid 
nanoparticles are under development for GSD1a, but potentially require 
complicated glycemic management throughout life. Here, we present a 
oligonucleotide-based therapy to produce intact G6Pase-α from a pathogenic human 
variant, G6PC c.648G>T, the most prevalent variant in East Asia causing aberrant 
splicing of G6PC. DS-4108b, a splice-switching oligonucleotide, was designed to 
correct this aberrant splicing, especially in liver. A generated mouse strain 
with homozygous knock-in of this variant well reflected the pathophysiology of 
GSD1a patients. DS-4108b recovered hepatic G6Pase activity through splicing 
correction and prevented hypoglycemia and various hepatic abnormalities in the 
mice. Moreover, DS-4108b exhibited long-lasting efficacy for more than 12 weeks 
in the mice with a single dose and favorable pharmacokinetics and tolerability 
in mice and monkeys. Taking these findings together, this oligonucleotide-based 
therapy could provide a sustainable and curative therapeutic option under easy 
disease management for GSD1a patients with G6PC c.648G>T.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the quality of care by age and 
gender in oesophageal cancer using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database.
METHODS: Patients aged 20 and over with oesophageal cancer were included in this 
longitudinal study using GBD 1990-2019 data. We used the Socio-Demographic Index 
(SDI) to classify the regions. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method 
to calculate the Quality of Care Index (QCI). The QCI was rescaled into a 0-100 
single index, demonstrating that the higher the score, the better the QC.
RESULTS: The age-standardized QCI for oesophageal cancer dramatically increased 
from 23.5 in 1990 to 41.1 in 2019 for both sexes, globally. The high SDI regions 
showed higher QCI than the rest of the regions (45.1 in 1990 and 65.7 in 2019) 
whereas the low SDI regions had the lowest QCI, which showed a 4.5% decrease 
through the years (from 13.3 in 1990 to 12.7 in 2019). Globally, in 2019, the 
QCI showed the highest scores for patients aged 80-84, reported 48.2, and the 
lowest score for patients aged 25-29 reported 31.5, for both sexes. Globally, in 
2019, age-standardized Gender Disparity Ratio (GDR) was 1.2, showing higher QCI 
in females than males.
CONCLUSION: There were fundamental differences in the QCI both globally and 
regionally between different age groups as well as between males and females. To 
achieve the goal of providing high-quality services equally to people in need in 
all over the world, health systems need to invest in effective diagnostic 
services, treatments, facilities, and equipment and to plan for screening and 
surveillance of high-risk individuals.

BACKGROUND: The effects of oral health on mortality have been reported; however, 
the association between mortality and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life 
(OHQOL) is unknown. We investigated the effect of OHQOL on total mortality in a 
cohort consisting of dentists.
METHODS: In this cohort study, we analyzed data from the Longitudinal Evaluation 
of Multi-phasic, Odonatological and Nutritional Associations in Dentists study. 
We conducted a baseline survey of general and oral health factors. We called for 
31,178 participants and collected responses from 10,256 participants. We 
followed up with 10,114 participants (mean age ± standard deviation, 
52.4 ± 12.1 years; females, 8.9%) for 7.7 years, until March 2014, to determine 
the average total mortality. OHQOL was assessed using the General Oral Health 
Assessment Index (GOHAI). The total score was divided into quartiles (Q1 ≤ 51.6, 
Q2 = 51.7-56.7, Q3 = 56.8-59.9, and Q4 = 60.0), with higher GOHAI scores 
indicating better OHQOL (score range, 12-60). The association between OHQOL and 
total mortality was analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: We documented 460 deaths. Males with low GOHAI scores possessed a 
remarkably high risk of total mortality. The multivariate adjusted-hazard ratios 
(aHRs), were 1.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07 - 3.48) for Q1, 1.69 (95% 
CI, 0.90 - 3.17) for Q2, and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.29 - 1.46) for Q3, relative to Q4 
(trend p = 0.001). The aHRs in the multivariate model with all background 
variables were 1.69 (95% CI, 1.15-2.46) for Q1, 1.53 (95% CI, 1.04-2.27) for Q2, 
and 1.09 (95% CI, 0.71-1.70) for Q3, relative to Q4 (trend p = 0.001). In 
females, there was no significant association between the quartiles, in both the 
multivariate-adjusted model (trend p = 0.52) and multivariate-adjusted model 
with all background variables (trend p = 0.79).
CONCLUSIONS: A lower OHQOL indicated an increased risk of total mortality in 
dentists. OHQOL may be used as an indicator for selecting treatment plans and 
personalized care interventions, thus contributing to increased healthy life 
expectancy.

Duodenal perforation most commonly presents with life-threatening symptoms of 
acute abdomen. However, in rare cases, a perforation may have an indolent course 
due to subclinical progression, and the patient may present with complications 
at the first visit. We present a case of an anterior abdominal abscess as the 
initial presentation of a duodenal perforation in a 65-year-old female with no 
pre-morbidities. The patient presented with a painful mass in the right upper 
quadrant associated with fever. Physical examination revealed a tender, 
erythematous swelling in the right hypochondrium and lumbar regions with no 
signs of peritonitis. Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) of the abdomen showed a 
subcapsular hepatic abscess with parietal extension, but no signs of hollow 
viscus perforation were visible. Empirical antibiotics were given, and incision 
and drainage (I&D) were performed to drain around 100 mL of pus. However, drain 
on postop day one demonstrated bile suggesting a hollow viscus perforation, 
which was confirmed by a Gastrografin study.

Abstract.
BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for many infections in humans 
and animals from skin and soft tissue infections to life-threatening diseases. 
In this study to explore the origin of S. aureus infections in humans, the 
antibiotic resistance profile and the variety of virulence factors in S. aureus 
isolates were examined in three groups: a healthy human population, cheese, and 
the milk of sheep with mastitis.
AIMS: The examination of some virulence factors in S. aureus isolates obtained 
from the healthy human population, sheep mastitis, and cheese.
METHODS: A total of 400 nasal swab samples from healthy students, 30 cheese 
samples, and 122 sheep milk samples were collected for the detection of S. 
aureus isolates from January 1, 2018, to March 1, 2018. The frequency of hla, 
hlb, Acme/arcA, pvl, and tsst-1 virulence genes and mecA gene was determined in 
each group by PCR assay.
RESULTS: There was a direct relationship between the antibiotic susceptibility 
profile of the isolates from a healthy population and those from mastitis milk 
samples. Of 400 nasal samples, 15% (60/400) were positive for S. aureus, of 
which 60% (36/60) were positive for mecA. While 50% (15/30) of cheese samples 
were positive for S. aureus. of which 7 cases (46.66%, 7/15) were positive for 
mecA. The prevalence of S. aureus among students was dependent on gender 
(P=0.025). Also, 47.5% (58/122) of milk samples from sheep mastitis were 
positive for S. aureus, and 41.37% (24/58) were positive for the mecA gene. 
Based on PCR results, the highest rate of hla (68.33%, 41/60), hlb (53.33%, 
32/60), and Acme/arcA (46.66%, 28/60) genes were related to a healthy 
population, and the highest frequency of pvl (41.38%, 24/58), and tsst-1 
(27.59%, 16/58) was related to milk samples (P<0.05). A significant correlation 
was observed between the presence of the arginine catabolic mobile element 
(ACME)-arcA gene and resistance to methicillin (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The high rate of virulence factors in the S. aureus isolates 
obtained from mastitis and dairy products is an alert point, because they could 
be source of the spreading of S. aureus to humans. There is an essential need 
for continuous monitoring to control staphylococcal food poisoning.

Dynamin 1 (Dyn1) has two major splice variants, xA and xB, with unique 
C-terminal extensions of 20 and 7 amino acids, respectively. Of these, only 
Dyn1xA is enriched at endocytic zones and accelerates vesicle fission during 
ultrafast endocytosis. Here, we report that the long tail variant, Dyn1xA, 
achieves this localization by preferentially binding to Endophilin A through a 
newly defined Class II binding site overlapping with its extension, at a site 
spanning the splice boundary. Endophilin binds this site at higher affinity than 
the previously reported site, and this affinity is determined by amino acids 
outside the binding sites acting as long distance elements within the xA tail. 
Their interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation state of two serine 
residues specific to the xA variant. Dyn1xA and Endophilin colocalize in patches 
near the active zone of synapses. Mutations selectively disrupting Endophilin 
binding to the long extension cause Dyn1xA mislocalization along axons. In these 
mutants, endocytic pits are stalled on the plasma membrane during ultrafast 
endocytosis. These data suggest that the specificity for ultrafast endocytosis 
is defined by the phospho-regulated interaction of Endophilin A through a newly 
identified site of Dyn1xA's long tail.

BACKGROUND: Due to the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) related social 
distancing measures and health service suspension, physical activity has 
declined, leading to increased falling risk and disability, and consequently, 
compromising the older adult health. How to improve the quality of older adult 
life has become a crucial social issue.
OBJECTIVE: In traditional rehabilitation, manual and repetitive muscle training 
cannot identify the patient's rehabilitation effect, and increasing the 
willingness to use it is not easy. Therefore, based on the usability 
perspective, this study aims to develop a novel smart somatosensory wearable 
assistive device (called SSWAD) combined with wireless surface electromyography 
(sEMG) and exergame software and hardware technology. The older adult can do 
knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion, and ankle plantar flexion rehabilitation 
exercises at home. Meanwhile, sEMG values can be digitally recorded to assist 
physicians (or professionals) in judgment, treatment, or diagnosis.
METHODS: To explore whether the novel SSWAD could improve the older adult 
willingness to use and motivation for home rehabilitation, 25 frail older adult 
(12 males and 13 females with an average age of 69.3) perform the rehabilitation 
program with the SSWAD, followed by completing the system usability scale (SUS) 
questionnaire and the semi-structured interview for the quantitative and 
qualitative analyses. In addition, we further investigate whether the factor of 
gender or prior rehabilitation experience would affect the home rehabilitation 
willingness or not.
RESULTS: According to the overall SUS score, the novel SSWAD has good overall 
usability performance (77.70), meaning that the SSWAD makes older adult feel 
interested and improves their willingness for continuous rehabilitation at home. 
In addition, the individual item scores of SUS are shown that female older adult 
with prior rehabilitation experience perform better in "Learnability" (t = 2.35, 
p = 0.03) and "Confidence" (t = -3.24, p = 0.01). On the contrary, male older 
adult without rehabilitation experience are more willing to adopt new 
technologies (t = -2.73, p = 0.02), and perform better in "Learnability" (t 
= 2.18, p = 0.04) and "Confidence" (t = -3.75, p < 0.001) with the SSWAD. In 
addition, the result of the semi-structured interview shows that the operation 
of the SSWAD is highly flexible, thus reducing older adult burden during the 
rehabilitation exercise and using them long-term.
CONCLUSION: This novel SSWAD receives consistently positive feedback regardless 
of the gender or prior rehabilitation experience of elders. The SSWAD could be 
used as a novel way of home rehabilitation for elders, especially during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Older adult can do rehabilitation exercises at home, and 
physicians could make proper judgments or adjust suitable treatments online 
according to the sEMG data, which older adult can know their rehabilitation 
progress at the same time. Most importantly, older adult do not have to go to 
the hospital every time for rehabilitation, which significantly reduces time and 
the risk of infection.

Diabetes mellitus and its complications pose a major threat to global health and 
affect the quality of life and life expectancy of patients. Currently, the 
application of traditional therapeutic drugs for diabetes mellitus has great 
limitations and can only temporarily control blood glucose but not fundamentally 
cure it. Mesenchymal stem cells, as pluripotent stromal cells, have 
multidirectional differentiation potential, high self-renewal, immune 
regulation, and low immunogenicity, which provide a new idea and possible 
development direction for diabetes mellitus treatment. Regenerative medicine 
with mesenchymal stem cells treatment as the core treatment will become another 
treatment option for diabetes mellitus after traditional treatment. Recently, 
human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells have been widely used in basic and 
clinical research on diabetes mellitus and its complications because of their 
abundance, low ethical controversy, low risk of infection, and high 
proliferation and differentiation ability. This paper reviews the therapeutic 
role and mechanism of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in diabetes 
mellitus and its complications and highlights the challenges faced by the 
clinical application of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells to provide a 
more theoretical basis for the application of human umbilical cord mesenchymal

BACKGROUND: Palliative care is an integral part of care for patients with 
life-limited diseases that focuses on reducing symptoms and maintaining and 
increasing the quality of life (QoL) for patients and their families. Geriatric 
patients were more likely to receive palliative care and had unique needs 
compared to the general population. To improve the quality of palliative care, 
especially for geriatric patients, it is necessary to have a better 
understanding of methods and outcomes for geriatric patients when delivering 
palliative care.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the methods and outcomes of palliative 
care in geriatric patients across the globe.
METHODS: This scoping review was guided by Arksey and 'O Malley's framework and 
utilized the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews 
(PRISMA-ScR) checklist for providing transparent reporting to the readers. 
EBSCO, PubMed, and Scopus databases were used to search the relevant articles 
with a publication range of 2013-2023. Thematic analysis was used to identify 
and summarize palliative care methods and outcomes for geriatric patients in 
this review.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in this review, and it was found that 
there were many types of methods for delivering palliative care to geriatric 
patients. In both acute care settings and community settings, a wide range of 
methods for delivering palliative care to geriatric patients were identified. 
Outcomes of palliative care in geriatric patients in hospitals and community 
settings, were reduced pain, depressive symptoms and anxiety, edema, 
constipation, odds of in-hospital death, and increased spiritual well-being, QoL 
and well-being, being comfortable, patient readiness, place of death, sleep 
quality, and quality of dying.
CONCLUSION: Geriatric patients had a variety of methods and outcomes in 
palliative care. This study suggests that outcomes should be evaluated 
continuously after implementing methods for delivering palliative care to 
geriatric patients.

Bony mallet finger injuries, commonly seen as isolated incidents, typically 
occur in active individuals. We report a rare case of simultaneous avulsion 
fractures at the distal phalangeal bases of the second, third, and fourth 
fingers on the right hand of a 14-year-old boy following a forced passive 
flexion injury during a football game. The patient initially received 
conservative management with a finger extension splint for the distal 
interphalangeal (DIP) joints. However, one week after the injury, we performed 
surgical fixation on all affected digits using the K-wire extension block method 
due to multiple fractures and the patient's intolerance for the mallet finger 
splint. After six weeks, all K-wires were removed, and physiotherapy sessions 
began. Three months post-injury, the second and fourth DIP joints demonstrated 
an "Excellent" outcome, and the third DIP joint demonstrated a "Good" outcome 
based on Crawford's criteria for outcome assessment of mallet finger injury 
after management. This case highlights the importance of early detection and 
appropriate management of concomitant mallet finger injuries in pediatric 
patients to prevent potential complications that could impair hand function and 
quality of life.

BACKGROUND: The importance of D-dimers (DD) assessment in the diagnostic 
algorithm of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease is well known. Increase of DD 
concentration may be also associated with neoplastic disease. Many studies 
documented that high concentration of DD before solid tumour surgery indicates 
more advanced disease and poor life expectancy. The prognostic value of the DD 
concentration variability in the perioperative period, in women undergoing 
breast cancer surgery, has not been analysed so far. Thus, the aim of the 
present prospective study was to assess whether the trend of DD concentration 
changes in the perioperative period may predict cancer recurrence in women 
undergoing breast cancer surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 189 consecutive women with histopathological diagnosis of 
breast cancer (BC) referred for surgical treatment were included. DD 
concentration was measured twice in each patient: at the time of admission to 
hospital and at the time of discharge home. Enoxaparin in standard dose of 40 mg 
daily s. c. was used as primary VTE prophylaxis in all of the patients.
RESULTS: The recurrence of BC, within 1 year observation time, occurred in 13 
patients (6.8%), in 11 (5.8%) patients with DD increase after surgery and only 
in 2 (1.1%) without an increase in DD, P = .0179. Increase in DD concentration 
after BC surgery was an independent positive predictor of disease relapse (OR 
8.600, LCI 1.451, UCI 96.80, P = .0371) together with the lack of postoperative 
radiotherapy (OR 6.009, LCI 1.305, UCI 31.95, P = .0245), whereas the lack of 
postoperative chemotherapy predicted no BC relapse (OR .07355, LCI .0056, UCI 
.58, P = .0245).
CONCLUSIONS: Increase of DD in the early postoperative period may be considered 
as additional independent predictor of recurrence of BC within 1 year.

To assess the long-term survival of patients with enterococcal bloodstream 
infections (BSI), encompassing various species and resistance patterns compared 
to Escherichia coli (E. coli) BSI. Between 2010-2019, 3,290 enterococcal and 
3,415 E. coli BSI were retrospectively screened in seven hospitals in Munich, 
Germany. All vancomycin-resistant (VRE), vancomycin/linezolid-resistant (LVRE), 
and linezolid-resistant (LRE) Enterococcus faecium (ECFM) BSI were included. 
Enterococcus faecalis (ECFA), vancomycin/linezolid-susceptible ECFM, and E. coli 
BSI were randomly assigned. Cox regression analysis was used to assess survival 
as the primary endpoint and was adjusted for limiting prognostic factors, which 
were measured for their importance using a random forest model (RFM). We 
analyzed 952 patients with 916 episodes of enterococcal BSI and 193 episodes of 
E. coli BSI. RFM identified multimorbidity and markers for disease severity as 
most indicative of low survival in enterococcal BSI. The 5-year survival was 
significantly lower for enterococcal BSI than for E. coli BSI (23.9% vs 42.3%; P 
< 0.001). This difference remained significant in the Cox regression analysis 
after adjusting for 17 prognostic factors and excluding patients with limited 
life expectancy (metastatic tumor disease, Charlson-Comorbidity-Index ≥5). 
Adjusted 5-year survival was similar for E. coli and ECFA but significantly 
different between ECFA and ECFM (29.2% vs 21.7%; P = 0.002). The analysis 
conducted on monomicrobial ECFM and VRE BSI indicated that their respective 
5-year survival was similar (19.6% vs. 21.2%; P = 0.753). ECFM BSI seems to be 
an independent risk factor for poor long-term survival. However, additional 
vancomycin resistance does not appear to be a contributing factor. IMPORTANCE 
The present study provides a substantial contribution to literature, showing 
that patients with enterococcal bloodstream infections (BSI) have a lower 
survival rate than those with Escherichia coli (E. coli) bloodstream infections 
after adjusting for 17 limiting prognostic factors and excluding patients with a 
limited life expectancy [metastatic tumor disease, Charlson Comorbidity Index 
(CCI) (greater than or equal to) 5]. This difference in the 5-year long-term 
survival was mainly driven by Enterococcus faecium (ECFM) bloodstream 
infections, with vancomycin resistance not being a significant contributing 
factor. Our findings imply that E. faecium bloodstream infections seem to be an 
independent risk factor for poor long-term outcomes. As such, future research 
should confirm this relationship and prioritize investigating its causality 
through prospective studies.

PURPOSE: Life history theory posits that multigenerational exposure to adversity 
and deprivation influences childhood growth and development, including pubertal 
maturation. We applied this ecological, evolutionary theory to examine the 
contributions of distal and proximal adversity on early puberty, a potentially 
important marker for population health.
METHODS: Baseline data from 5,645 girls in the adolescent brain cognitive 
development study were included. Early puberty was defined as midlate/post 
pubertal development by age 9-11 years. The contributions of multigenerational 
Black/Indigenous (Black, Indigenous and People of Color [BIPOC]) or Hispanic 
identities, intergenerational mental health, economic deprivation, personal 
trauma exposure and mental health, and proximal biological factors of premature 
birth and body mass index on early puberty were examined with hierarchical 
modeling.
RESULTS: 1,225 girls (21.7%) had early puberty. BIPOC/Hispanic identity, 
familial adversity, economic deprivation, personal trauma, depression, and a 
higher body mass index contributed significantly toward early puberty. The 
effect of multigenerational adversity remained significant across models, but 
the likelihood of early puberty decreased sequentially for BIPOC and Hispanic 
youth as proximal adversities were added (e.g., OR decreased from 2.93 to 2.38 
for BIPOC youth), supporting a synergistic effect of layered adversity on early 
puberty.
DISCUSSION: This analysis supports life history theory as a coherent framework 
to understand early puberty among girls. Findings suggest monitoring pubertal 
timing as a population health indictor, like birth weight, prematurity, or life 
expectancy. Addressing early puberty may require policy and social changes to 
mitigate the negative impact of multiple layers of adversity including 
racial/ethnic disadvantage, family, and individual mental health and trauma, as 
well as economic insecurity.

Environmental pollution and life expectancy in Somalia: do renewable energy, 
urbanization, and economic growth matter?

Ensuring good quality of health and longevity became a topical for policymakers 
and academicians. Various determinants, including socio-economic factors, have 
been discussed in the literature. Nevertheless, the empirical studies on this 
issue are scanty in least-developed countries like Somalia where the health 
indicators are poor. In this regard, this undertaking examines the impacts of 
renewable energy, urbanization, environmental pollution, and economic growth on 
life expectancy in Somalia for the period straddling 1990-2016. The study uses a 
novelty machine learning method - Kernel regularized least square (KRLS) method. 
The empirical results indicated that renewable energy, economic growth, and 
urbanization are statistically significant; whereas, environmental pollution is 
statistically insignificant. Renewable energy, economic growth, and urbanization 
exert positive effects on life expectancy in Somalia and have increasing 
marginal effects. Besides, bidirectional causality between renewable energy and 
life expectancy, life expectancy and economic growth, and environmental 
pollution and life expectancy are established. Moreover, unidirectional 
causality from urbanization to life expectancy is also observed. The study 
suggests that a budgetary revision be made to sort out health-related concerns 
resulting from a lack of healthcare services and poor sanitation for improving 
the longevity of the people. Additionally, investments in clean energy are 
necessary as will improve health outcomes without compromising economic growth 
and life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: We explored the monetary value of the end-of-life (EoL) health gains, 
that is, the value of a life-year (VOLY) gained at the end of a patient's life 
in Croatia. We tested whether the nature of the illness under valuation (cancer 
and/or rare disease) is a factor in the valuation of EoL-VOLYs. The aim was for 
our results to contribute to the health and longevity valuation literature and 
more particularly to the debate on the appropriate cost-effectiveness threshold 
for EoL treatments as well as to provide input into the debate on the 
justifiability of a cancer and/or a rare disease premium when evaluating 
therapies.
METHODS: A contingent valuation was conducted in an online survey using a 
representative sample of the Croatian population (n = 1500) to calculate the 
willingness to pay for gains in the remaining life expectancy at the EoL, from 
the social-inclusive-individual perspective, using payment scales and an 
open-ended payment vehicle. Our approach mimics the actual decision-making 
problem of deciding whether to reimburse therapies targeting EoL conditions such 
as metastatic cancer whose main purpose is to extend life (and not add quality 
to life).
RESULTS: Average EoL-VOLY across all scenarios was estimated at €67,000 (median 
€40,000). In scenarios that offered respondents 1 full year of life extension, 
EoL-VOLY was estimated at €33,000 (median €22,000). Our results show that the 
type of illness is irrelevant for EoL-VOLY evaluations.
CONCLUSIONS: The pressure to reimburse expensive therapies targeting EoL 
conditions will continue to increase. Delivering "value for money" in 
healthcare, both in countries with relatively higher and lower budget 
restrictions, requires the valuation of different types of health gains, which 
should, in turn, affect our ability to evaluate their cost effectiveness.

Aging varies greatly within a single genus: A demographic study of Rhododendron 
spp. in botanic gardens.

PREMISE: There is mounting evidence that age matters in plant demography, but 
also indications that relationships between age and demographic rates may vary 
significantly among species. Age-based plant demographic data, however, are 
time-consuming to collect and still lacking for most species, and little is 
known about general patterns across species or what may drive differences.
METHODS: We used individual birth and death records for 12 Rhododendron species 
from botanic gardens and conducted Bayesian survival trajectory analyses to 
assess how mortality changed with age. We calculated the demographic measures of 
aging rate, life-span equality, and life expectancy for each species, and 
assessed their relationships with the climatic conditions at species' sites of 
ancestral origin and with taxonomic group (subgenus).
RESULTS: We found substantial among-species variation in survival trajectories, 
with mortality increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant with advancing age. 
Moreover, we found no relationships between demographic measures and ancestral 
climatic conditions but there were statistically significant differences among 
taxonomic groups in the rate of change in mortality with age (aging rate).
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that demographic consequences of aging can differ 
qualitatively, even among species in the same genus. In addition, taxonomic 
trends in aging rates indicate they may be genetically determined, though 
evolutionary drivers are still unclear. Furthermore, we suggest there is 
untapped potential in using botanic garden records in future studies on plant 
life history.

Both lymph node metastases (LNMs) and tumour deposits (TDs) are included in 
colorectal cancer (CRC) staging, although knowledge regarding their biological 
background is lacking. This study aimed to compare the biology of these 
prognostic features, which is essential for a better understanding of their role 
in CRC spread. Spatially resolved transcriptomic analysis using digital spatial 
profiling was performed on TDs and LNMs from 10 CRC patients using 1,388 RNA 
targets, for the tumour cells and tumour microenvironment. Shotgun proteomics 
identified 5,578 proteins in 12 different patients. Differences in RNA and 
protein expression were analysed, and spatial deconvolution was performed. 
Image-based consensus molecular subtype (imCMS) analysis was performed on all 
TDs and LNMs included in the study. Transcriptome and proteome profiles 
identified distinct clusters for TDs and LNMs in both the tumour and tumour 
microenvironment segment, with upregulation of matrix remodelling, cell 
adhesion/motility, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in TDs (all 
p < 0.05). Spatial deconvolution showed a significantly increased abundance of 
fibroblasts, macrophages, and regulatory T-cells (p < 0.05) in TDs. Consistent 
with a higher fibroblast and EMT component, imCMS classified 62% of TDs as poor 
prognosis subtype CMS4 compared to 36% of LNMs (p < 0.05). Compared to LNMs, TDs 
have a more invasive state involving a distinct tumour microenvironment and 
upregulation of EMT, which are reflected in a more frequent histological 
classification of TDs as CMS4. These results emphasise the heterogeneity of 
locoregional spread and the fact that TDs should merit more attention both in 
future research and during staging. © 2023 The Authors. The Journal of Pathology
