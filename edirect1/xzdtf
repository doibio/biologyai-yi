Microbial metabolites have proven effects to inhibit food spoilage microbiota, 
without any development of antimicrobial resistance. This review provides a 
recent literature update on the preservative action of metabolites derived from 
microorganisms on seafood. Fish and fishery products are regarded as a myriad of 
nutrition, while being highly prone to spoilage. Several proven controversies 
(antimicrobial resistance and health issues) related to the use of synthetic 
preservatives have caused an imminent problem. The demand for minimally 
processed and naturally preserved clean-label fish and fishery products is on 
rise. Metabolites derived from microorganisms have exhibited diverse 
preservation capacities on fish and fishery products' spoilage. Inclusions with 
other preservation techniques, such as hurdle technology, for the shelf-life 
extension of fish and fishery products are also summarized.

People living with mental health conditions experience a reduced life expectancy 
largely due to a higher prevalence of chronic diseases. Addressing health risk 
behaviours, including tobacco smoking, inadequate nutrition, harmful alcohol 
consumption, and physical inactivity (SNAP), through the provision of preventive 
care, is recommended to reduce this burden. Community Managed Organisations 
(CMOs) may play an important role in providing preventive care to consumers with 
mental health conditions, however, few studies have examined preventive care 
provision in CMO settings; and no studies have comprehensively assessed barriers 
to the provision of this care using a tool such as the Theoretical Domains 
Framework (TDF). To fill this research gap, we conducted an online survey among 
staff (N = 190) from one CMO in Australia to (1) identify barriers to preventive 
care provision (ask, advise, assist, connect) to address SNAP behaviours among 
consumers; and (2) explore associations between barriers and preventive care 
provision. Results demonstrate that while staff reported knowing how to provide 
preventive care and believed it would positively impact consumers; barriers 
including confidence in providing this care and consumer uptake of referrals, 
were identified. Further research among multiple CMOs is needed to identify care 
provision and associated barriers in the sector more widely.

One of the common traits found in cancer patients is malnutrition and cachexia, 
which affects between 25% to 60% of the patients, depending on the type of 
cancer, diagnosis, and treatment. Given the lack of current effective 
pharmacological solutions for low muscle mass and sarcopenia, holistic 
interventions are essential to patient care, as well as exercise and nutrition. 
Thus, the present narrative review aimed to analyze the nutritional, 
pharmacological, ergonutritional, and physical exercise strategies in 
cancer-related cachexia. The integration of multidisciplinary interventions 
could help to improve the final intervention in patients, improving their 
prognosis, quality of life, and life expectancy. To reach these aims, an 
extensive narrative review was conducted. The databases used were MedLine 
(PubMed), Cochrane (Wiley), Embase, PsychINFO, and CinAhl. Cancer-related 
cachexia is a complex multifactorial phenomenon in which systemic inflammation 
plays a key role in the development and maintenance of the symptomatology. 
Pharmacological interventions seem to produce a positive effect on inflammatory 
state and cachexia. Nutritional interventions are focused on a high-energy diet 
with high-density foods and the supplementation with antioxidants, while 
physical activity is focused on strength-based training. The implementation of 
multidisciplinary non-pharmacological interventions in cancer-related cachexia 
could be an important tool to improve traditional treatments and improve 
patients' quality of life.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of female athlete triad risk 
factors among female international volunteers based on the development and 
income status of their country of service. A total of 2164 past volunteers 
completed a retrospective survey. Countries' income and development statuses 
were coded using the respective annual United Nations World Economic Situations 
and Prospects reports. Independent t-tests, ANOVAs, and Pearson's Chi-Squared 
tests were used to assess group differences; corresponding odds ratios were 
calculated. Volunteers in nondeveloped (OR = 2.25, CI = 1.85-2.75) and 
non-high-income (OR = 2.17, CI = 1.75-2.70) countries had over twice the odds of 
experiencing secondary amenorrhea. More volunteers who served in nondeveloped 
countries reported an increase in exercise while serving (p = 0.005). Those who 
served in a nondeveloped (OR = 1.52, CI = 1.16-1.98) or non-high-income (OR = 
1.45, CI = 1.08-1.94) country had higher odds of weight loss. However, 
volunteers serving in nondeveloped (OR = 0.52, CI = 0.44-0.63) and 
non-high-income (OR = 0.50, CI = 0.4-0.61) countries were less likely to report 
food insecurity compared to those in developed and high-income countries. Bone 
mineral density was within the expected range regardless of income and 
development status. Female volunteers who served in nondeveloped and 
non-high-income countries experienced higher odds of secondary amenorrhea, which 
was likely influenced by an increase in exercise and higher odds of weight loss.

Cancers currently represent a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and 
precisely estimating their burden is crucial for evidence-based decision-making. 
This study aimed at understanding the average costs of cancer-related 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and highlighting possible differences in 
economic estimates obtained with diverse approaches. We searched four scientific 
databases to identify all the primary literature simultaneously investigating 
cancer-related costs and DALYs. In view of the different methodologies, studies 
were divided into two groups: those estimating costs starting from DALYs, and 
those independently performing cost and DALY analyses. The latter were pooled to 
compute costs per disease-related DALY: meta-analytic syntheses were performed 
for total costs and indirect costs, and in relation to the corresponding gross 
domestic product (GDP) per capita. The quality of included studies was assessed 
through the Quality of Health Economic Studies instrument. Seven studies were 
selected. Total and indirect pooled costs per DALY were, respectively, USD 9150 
(95% CI: 5560-15,050) and USD 3890 (95% CI: 2570-5880). Moreover, the cost per 
cancer-related DALY has been found to be, on average, 32% (95% CI: 24-42%) of 
the corresponding countries' GDP per capita. Costs calculated a priori from 
DALYs may lead to results widely different from those obtained after data 
retrieval and model building. Further research is needed to better estimate the 
economic burden of cancer in terms of costs and DALYs.

The world's population aged ≥65 is expected to rise from one in eleven in 2019 
to one in six by 2050. People aged ≥65 are at a risk of undernutrition, frailty, 
and sarcopenia. The association between these conditions is investigated in a 
hospital setting. However, there is little understanding about the overlap and 
adverse health outcomes of these conditions in community-dwelling people. This 
systematic review aims to quantify the reported prevalence and incidence of 
undernutrition, frailty, and sarcopenia among older people aged ≥50 living in 
community dwellings. Searches were conducted using six databases (AMED, CENTRAL, 
EMBASE, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and CINAHL), and 37 studies were included. 
Meta-analyses produced weighted combined estimates of prevalence for each 
condition (Metaprop, Stata V16/MP). The combined undernutrition prevalence was 
17% (95% CI 0.01, 0.46, studies n = 5; participants = 4214), frailty was 13% 
(95% CI 0.11, 0.17 studies n = 28; participants = 95,036), and sarcopenia was 
14% (95% CI 0.09, 0.20, studies n = 9; participants = 7656). Four studies 
reported incidence rates, of which three included data on frailty. Nearly one in 
five of those aged ≥50 was considered either undernourished, frail, or 
sarcopenic, with a higher occurrence in women, which may reflect a longer life 
expectancy generally observed in females. Few studies measured incidence rates. 
Further work is required to understand population characteristics with these 
conditions and the overlap between them. PROSPERO registration No.

BACKGROUND: Recurrences remain an important problem in laryngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma. Little has been described about histological characteristics of the 
primary laryngeal tumor that may be associated with recurrences. Identifying 
risk factors for recurrences might help in adapting treatment or follow-up. 
Using real-life population-based data, we aimed to identify histological 
features of the primary tumor associated with recurrences and overall survival.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Demographic, clinical and treatment information on all 
first primary invasive laryngeal tumors diagnosed in 2010-2014 (N = 3705) were 
extracted from the population-based nationwide Netherlands cancer registry (NCR) 
and linked to PALGA, the nationwide Dutch pathology registry, to obtain data on 
histological factors and recurrences. For a random 1502 patients histological 
information i.e., keratinization, perineural invasion (PNI+), vascular invasion 
(VI+), growth pattern, degree of differentiation, extracapsular spread (ECS+), 
cartilage- and bone invasion and extralaryngeal extension, was manually 
extracted from narrative pathology reports and analyzed for locoregional 
recurrence and overall survival using cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 299 patients developed a locoregional recurrence and 555 
patients died. Keratinization (HR = 0.96 (95%CI: 0.68-1.34) p = 0.79), two or 
three adverse characteristics (PNI+, VI+, non-cohesive growth) (HR = 1.38 (95% 
CI: 0.63-3.01) p = 0.42), and ECS+ (HR = 1.38 (95% CI: 0.48-4.02) p = 0.55) were 
not associated to recurrence. For death, also no significant association was 
found.
CONCLUSION: In this population-based real-life dataset on laryngeal carcinoma in 
the Netherlands, histological factors were not associated with locoregional 
recurrences or overall survival, but future studies should investigate the role 
of these features in treatment decisions.

Metabolic and endocrine diseases - is our approach always rational?

[Article in English]

Brunerová L, Urbanová J, Brož J.

Choosing wisely in metabolic and endocrine diseases shows the inutility of some, 
in clinical practice often used, ways of management. In diabetology, the routine 
recommendation for selfmonitoring of type 2 diabetic patients not treated with 
insulin represents a contraversial issue. On the contrary, there is a consensus 
on rational targets of glycemic control in elderly frailty patients with limited 
life expectancy. In endocrinology (thyroid diseases), the iniciative fights 
against the overuse of some laboratory examinations and ultrasonography. The 
recommendations on the rational indications of densitometry are discussed. In 
conclusion, these recommendations within Choosing wisely initiative of different 
professional associations usualy arise from expert views, supported by relevant 
clinical studies. They represent a challange to think over rational management 
of care.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy for people with Down syndrome is increasing, but 
older adults with Down syndrome are at greater risk of developing certain 
pathologies associated with ageing. When ageing parents can no longer look after 
their child with Down syndrome, their other children are often expected to 
shoulder this responsibility.
METHOD: We asked 120 adult siblings of a person with Down syndrome to complete a 
questionnaire on their current and anticipated relationships.
RESULTS: Most respondents considered these relationships to be positive, but 
they expressed concerns about the effects of ageing and about having to organise 
their sibling with Down syndrome's future life. We investigated the impact of 
factors relating to the respondents and to their sibling with Down syndrome 
(age, gender, social inclusion, protection regime) on these general tendencies.
CONCLUSION: Siblings need to be given support, for example, via discussion 
groups, to facilitate the transition to becoming caregivers.

Changing concepts in heart muscle disease: the evolving understanding of 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Sixty years ago, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was considered a rare lethal 
disease that affected predominantly young adults and for which there were few 
treatment options. Today, it is recognised to be a relatively common disorder 
that presents throughout the life course with a heterogeneous clinical phenotype 
that can be managed effectively in the majority of individuals. A greater 
awareness of the condition and less reluctance from healthcare practitioners to 
make the diagnosis, coupled with improvements in cardiac imaging, including 
greater use of artificial intelligence and improved yields from screening 
efforts, have all helped facilitate a more precise and timely diagnosis. This 
enhanced ability to diagnose HCM early is being paired with innovations in 
treatment, which means that the majority of patients receiving a contemporary 
diagnosis of HCM can anticipate a normal life expectancy and expect to maintain 
a good functional status and quality of life. Indeed, with increasing 
translation of molecular genetics from bench to bedside associated with a 
growing number of randomised clinical trials of novel therapies aimed at 
ameliorating or perhaps even preventing the disease, the next chapter in the 
story for HCM will provide much excitement and more importantly, offer much 
anticipated reward for our patients.

In the centenary year of the British Cardiovascular Society (BCS), this review 
article outlines the influence of UK cardiologists and surgeons on the field of 
heart valve disease, many of whom can rightly claim 'world firsts' in the field. 
From the description of endocarditis as we know it today at the turn of the 20th 
century, to the first mitral valvotomy, heart valve replacement and invention of 
the Ross procedure. These advances have transformed the outlook of patients with 
symptomatic valve disease from palliation and certain death to curative 
treatment and near normal life expectancy. Transcatheter aortic valve 
implantation (TAVI) was adopted early in the UK, and thanks to the comprehensive 
national database, the UK TAVI registry is one of the world's largest, 
contributing real-world patient data to inform clinical practice. The more 
recent concepts of 'Heart Valve Centres of Excellence' and specialist valve 
clinics have been developed by the BCS-affiliated British Heart Valve Society 
which continues to drive improved standards for patients with heart valve 
disease. The next 100 years will no doubt be equally thrilling in terms of 
innovation for heart valve disease, with artificial intelligence, transcatheter 
therapies and cutting-edge technology continuing to improve patient care and 
clinical outcomes.

While global warming and climate change associated with increasing carbon 
dioxide are widely seen to be one of the most serious worldwide dangers to 
population health, little is known regarding "how" country alters the linkage 
between increasing CO2 emissions and population health outcomes. Current 
literature on the health effects of CO2 emissions recommends various factors 
that may establish a more robust link, including health expenditure and research 
and development. Therefore, the purpose of this inquiry is to examine the 
effectiveness of health expenditure and R&D in improving health outcomes through 
reducing CO2 emissions. Using data for Saudi Arabia over the period 2000-2018, 
the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) technique shows that (i) health and 
R&D expenditures decrease infant mortality and increase life expectancy; (ii) 
health and R&D expenditures reduce CO2 emissions in all the estimated models; 
(iii) health and R&D expenditures can improve health outcomes through reducing 
CO2 emissions; and (iv) health and R&D expenditures have both direct and 
indirect effect on health outcomes. Policy implications and limitations are also 
discussed.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of app-based treatment for female 
stress, urgency or mixed urinary incontinence (UI) compared with care-as-usual 
in Dutch primary care.
DESIGN: A pragmatic, randomised controlled, superiority trial.
SETTING: Primary care in the Netherlands from 2015 to 2018, follow-up at 
12 months.
POPULATION: Women with ≥2 UI-episodes per week, access to mobile apps, wanting 
treatment.
METHODS: The standalone app included conservative management for UI with 
motivation aids (e.g. reminders). Care-as-usual delivered according to the Dutch 
GP guideline for UI.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs and cost-effectiveness and -utility were assessed 
from a societal perspective, based on incontinence impact adjusted life years 
(IIALYs), quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and medical, non-medical and 
productivity costs. Information on costs was obtained with the iMCQ and iPCQ 
questionnaires (medical consumption and productivity cost questionnaires).
RESULTS: In all, 262 women were andomised equally to app or care-as-usual; 89 
(68%) and 83 (63%) attended follow-up, respectively. Costs were lower for 
app-based treatment with € -161 (95% confidence interval [CI -180 to -151) per 
year. Cost-effectiveness showed small mean differences in effect for IIALY 
(0.04) and QALY (-0.03) and thus larger incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICER: -€3696) and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR: €6379).
CONCLUSION: App-based treatment is a cost-effective alternative to care-as-usual 
for women with UI in Dutch primary care.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: App-treatment for female urinary incontinence cost-effective 
compared to care-as-usual in general practice after 12 months.

OBJECTIVE: To examine differences in mortality, retreatment rates, and 
comorbidities that may be risk factors for retreatment among Medicare 
beneficiaries (age 65+) undergoing midurethral sling vs urethral bulking.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using the 5% 
limited data set from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services between 2010 
and 2018. Beneficiaries age 65 or older who underwent sling or bulking without 
concomitant surgery from 2011 to 2014 were included and followed until 
reoperation or retreatment, loss of Medicare, death, or December 31, 2018. 
Repeat procedures for ongoing stress incontinence or complication were included. 
Associations between index treatment and need for a secondary procedure were 
evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 5.7 years for 1,700 patients undergoing sling 
and 5.2 years for 875 patients undergoing bulking. Within 5 years, 10.2% of 
sling patients and 23.2% of bulking patients had died. When controlling for age, 
race, and comorbidities, bulking patients were 1.73 times more likely than sling 
patients to die during the study period. Bulking patients were significantly 
more likely to have 12 of the 16 of the medical comorbidities evaluated. By 5 
years, 6.7% of sling patients had been retreated for stress urinary incontinence 
(SUI) compared with 24.6% of bulking patients. Apart from hypertension, none of 
the comorbidities evaluated was associated with a difference in the risk of a 
subsequent surgical procedure. Members of racial and ethnic minority groups were 
less likely to be retreated.
CONCLUSION: Older adults undergoing bulking are notably sicker and have shorter 
life expectancy as compared with those undergoing sling, suggesting these 
factors heavily guide patient selection. Comorbidities do not predispose 
patients to reoperation or retreatment.

As an important environmental pollutant, lead exposure can result in idiopathic 
developmental intellectual disability (IDII). However, the latest spatiotemporal 
patterns across the world are unclear. Therefore, in this study, the global 
burden of lead exposure-related IDII was assessed using the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) study (2019). The data were downloaded from the Institute for 
Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), and the estimated annual percentage change 
(EAPC) was calculated to assess the changing trend of the age-standardized 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) rates (ASDR) of global IDII attributed to 
lead exposure. In 2019, the number of global DALYs of IDII attributed to lead 
exposure was 2.72 million, the corresponding ASDR was 35.70 per 100,000. The 
ASDR was highest in children and adolescents, and low- and middle-income 
countries. From 1990 to 2019, the global number of DALYs of IDII attributable to 
lead exposure increased by 7.89%, while the ASDR of IDII decreased by 19.19% 
[EAPC = -0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI): (-0.90, -0.66)]. The downward 
trends were seen in most GBD regions and countries, especially in high-income 
countries, but 11 countries presented an upward trend. Therefore, it is 
important to continue to improve primary mental healthcare globally, especially 
in low- and middle-income countries. Meanwhile, the implementation of effective 
strategies to reduce lead exposure should be continually strengthened.

The most common malignancies that develop in carriers of BAP1 germline mutations 
include diffuse malignant mesothelioma, uveal and cutaneous melanoma, renal cell 
carcinoma, and less frequently, breast cancer, several types of skin carcinomas, 
and other tumor types. Mesotheliomas in these patients are significantly less 
aggressive, and patients require a multidisciplinary approach that involves 
genetic counseling, medical genetics, pathology, surgical, medical, and 
radiation oncology expertise. Some BAP1 carriers have asymptomatic mesothelioma 
that can be followed by close clinical observation without apparent adverse 
outcomes: they may survive many years without therapy. Others may grow 
aggressively but very often respond to therapy. Detecting BAP1 germline 
mutations has, therefore, substantial medical, social, and economic impact. 
Close monitoring of these patients and their relatives is expected to result in 
prolonged life expectancy, improved quality of life, and being cost-effective. 
The co-authors of this paper are those who have published the vast majority of 
cases of mesothelioma occurring in patients carrying inactivating germline BAP1 
mutations and who have studied the families affected by the BAP1 cancer syndrome 
for many years. This paper reports our experience. It is intended to be a source 
of information for all physicians who care for patients carrying germline BAP1 
mutations. We discuss the clinical presentation, diagnostic and treatment 
challenges, and our recommendations of how to best care for these patients and 
their family members, including the potential economic and psychosocial impact.

Potassium (K) is an important cation that regulates plant metabolism. Therefore 
the effect of different concentrations of potassium (0, 75, 150 kg ha-1 K2SO4) 
on photosynthesis efficiency of three winter wheat cultivars (Baran, Homa, 
Hashtrud) was investigated during the growing seasons of 2017-18 and 2018-19 
under cold dryland conditions in Maragheh, Iran. Accumulation of potassium ion 
(K+) was observed to be increased with an increase in the concentration of 
K2SO4. With an increase in K+ the Hashtrud cultivar was observed to have more 
relative water content (RWC), normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), 
and stomatal conductance (gs) than other cultivars. This resulted in a higher 
grain yield for the Hashtrud cultivar. RWC (R2 = 0.97), NDVI (R2 = 0.96), and gs 
(R2 = 0.92) had a positive relationship with KUE (grain yield/unit of K 
fertilizer used), especially in dryer years. K deficiency induced hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in plants. The 
application of K increased superoxide dismutases and reduced abscisic acid, to 
maintain the plants' stomatal conductance. Chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) and 
the calculation of double normalized relative variable fluorescence reveal 
detailed information's about the response of wheat plants to K application under 
dryland conditions. The application of a high concentration of K (150 kg ha-1 
K2SO4) on Hashtrud plants had a beneficial effect on the ChlF efficiency at 
different OJIP phases (KJ and JI). We found the efficiency of ChlF at the ΔWK-I 
phase with the values of FV/FO and PIABS improved with the application of 
150 kg ha-1 K2SO4 and can be correlated with total yield improvement. These 
observations indicated that the application of a high concentration of K in 
stressed conditions for dryland areas could improve photosynthetic efficiency 
and wheat plant performance.

Japanese women have the highest life expectancy in the world and breast cancer 
is the most prevalent cancer among them. However, little data are available to 
support the evidence-based clinical management due to the fact that older adults 
are commonly excluded from most clinical trials. In Japan the rate of other 
cause of death in older patient was about a half, then we should consider 
whether or not breast cancer may affect the patient's life expectancy to avoid 
either overtreatment or undertreatment. Although management principles in older 
patients may be similar with those of younger age, these differences would be 
caused by relatively short life expectancy, some comorbidity, drug interactions 
and low functional status. Then, their treatment needs to be individualized. To 
this end, employing a comprehensive geriatric assessment may be advantageous, 
which enables to evaluate patient vulnerability from several different aspects, 
to predict adverse events of chemotherapy and to identify geriatric problems in 
advance so that extra support and modified treatment can be provided. Before 
treatment we should assess the patient's goals and values regarding the 
management of the cancer, especially on balancing survival benefit with 
immediate quality of life impairment due to anti-cancer therapy. In Japan 
Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) , a randomized controlled trial for older 
patients with advanced stage HER2-positive breast cancer is ongoing as an 
inferiority design including geriatric assessment (JCOG1607, HARB TEA study). 
Best practice, current management and how to approach decision making in older 
patients with breast cancer are summarized.

[Research in evaluation and intervention of cardiovascular complications of 
patients with type 1 diabetes on demand].

Recently, great progress has been made in the treatment of type 1 diabetes 
mellitus (T1DM), however the disease still significantly shortens the life 
expectancy. Cardiovascular complication is the main cause of death in T1DM 
patients, and the morbidity is even higher than that of type 2 diabetes. The 
risk factors of cardiovascular complication in T1DM are different from those of 
type 2 diabetes. Besides hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, 
microvascular complications and unhealthy lifestyle, non-traditional risk 
factors also play very important roles in developing cardiovascular 
complication, such as hypoglycemia, blood glucose variability, insulin 
resistance, and autoimmune inflammation of heart. At present, there is a lack of 
risk assessment and prevention measures for cardiovascular complications in 
T1DM. It is necessary for more studies to explore whether sodium-dependent 
glucose transporters 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
receptor agonists, which can improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 
diabetes mellitus, can be equally effective in T1DM.

近年来，1型糖尿病（T1DM）的治疗取得了巨大进步，但该病仍明显缩短预期寿命。心血管并发症是T1DM患者致死的首要原因，其发生率甚至高于2型糖尿病。影响T1DM心血管并发症发生发展的因素有不同于2型糖尿病的自身特点，除了高血糖、血脂异常、高血压、微血管并发症、不良生活方式之外，非传统的危险因素包括低血糖与血糖变异、胰岛素抵抗、心脏自身免疫炎症等也发挥了重要作用。目前对于T1DM心血管并发症的风险评估和防治手段均较为匮乏，已知能够改善2型糖尿病心血管和肾脏并发症的钠-葡萄糖协同转运蛋白2（SGLT2）抑制剂和 
胰高糖素样肽-1（GLP-1）受体激动剂能否在T1DM发挥同等效力均需要更多的研究进行探索。.
