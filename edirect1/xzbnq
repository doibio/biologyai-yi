BACKGROUND: This study examines the resources utilization in patients with 
Crohn's disease (CD) during the year before (Y - 1) and after (Y + 1) starting 
treatment with adalimumab and the drug's efficiency.
METHODS: Observational, multicenter, prospective cohort study of patients with 
CD naive to biological drugs. The proportion of patients with CD Activity Index 
(CDAI) <150 was considered as the effectiveness variable. Costs considered were 
direct costs (DC) related to the use of health care resources, and indirect 
costs (IC) related to sick leave in Y - 1 and Y + 1. Adalimumab efficiency was 
estimated as the incremental cost/effectiveness ratio. A deterministic 
sensitivity analysis was performed building 3 scenarios: base case, the least 
favorable, and the most favorable case for adalimumab.
RESULTS: In the cohort of 126 patients (50.8% men; age 39.1 ± 13.8 yr), the 
proportion of patients in remission increased from 34.1% by the end of Y - 1 to 
83.3% by the end of Y + 1. Although the DC increase by the use of adalimumab, 
the use of doctor visits, emergency room visits, laboratory tests, diagnostic 
examinations, and nonbiological drug treatment were lower (P < 0.05) in Y + 1 
than Y - 1. In the base case scenario, considering only DC, the incremental 
cost/effectiveness ratio was €31,308 and including IC, it was €28,936. In 
patients with CDAI > 150 at the onset, incremental cost/effectiveness ratio was 
€20,119 and €18,223, considering DC alone or included IC, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CD, adalimumab increases pharmacological costs at 
the expense of biological therapy but reduces the cost of other drugs, the use 
of health care resources, and IC. Adalimumab efficiency is 30% greater in 
patients with CDAI > 150.

AIM: Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is increasingly used in 
clinical practice for the management of selected patients with Type 1 diabetes. 
Several cost-effectiveness studies comparing CSII vs. multiple insulin 
injections (MDI) have been reported. The aim was systematically to review these 
analyses and test the hypothesis that CSII is a cost-effective use of healthcare 
resources across settings.
METHODS: A literature review was performed using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and 
other databases. No time limit or language restrictions were applied. After two 
rounds of screening, 11 cost-effectiveness analyses were included in the final 
review, of which nine used the CORE Diabetes Model. A narrative synthesis was 
conducted and mean cost effectiveness calculated.
RESULTS: CSII was considered cost-effective vs. MDI in Type 1 diabetes in all 11 
studies in 8 countries, with a mean (95% CI) incremental cost effectiveness 
ratio of €30 862 (17 997-43 727), US$40 143 (23 409-56 876) per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained. CSII was associated with improved life expectancy and 
quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.4-1.1 QALYs in adults), driven by lower 
HbA(1c) and lower frequency of hypoglycaemic events vs. MDI. CSII was associated 
with higher lifetime direct costs due to higher treatment costs but this was 
partially offset by cost-savings from reduced diabetes-related complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Published cost-effectiveness analyses show that in Type 1 diabetes 
CSII is cost-effective vs. MDI across a number of settings for patients who have 
poor glycaemic control and/or problematic hypoglycaemia on MDI, with 
cost-effectiveness highly sensitive to the reduction in HbA1c and hypoglycaemia 
frequency associated with CSII.

INTRODUCTION: Focal ablation therapy is playing an increasing role in oncology 
and may reduce the toxicity of current surgical treatments while achieving 
adequate oncological benefit. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has been 
proposed to be tissue-selective with potential advantages compared with current 
thermal-ablation technologies or radiotherapy. The aim of this pilot trial is to 
determine the effectiveness and feasibility of focal percutaneous IRE in 
patients with localised renal cell cancer as a uro-oncological tumour model.
METHODS: Prospective, monocentric Phase 2a pilot study following current 
recommendations, including those of the International Working Group on 
Image-Guided Tumor Ablation. Twenty patients with kidney tumour (T1aN0M0) will 
be recruited. This sample permits an appropriate evaluation of the feasibility 
and effectiveness of image-guided percutaneous IRE ablation of locally confined 
kidney tumours as well as functional outcomes. Percutaneous biopsy for 
histopathology will be performed before IRE, with magnetic-resonance imaging one 
day before and 2, 7, 27 and 112 days after IRE; at 28 days after IRE the tumour 
region will be completely resected and analysed by ultra-thin-layer histology.
DISCUSSION: The IRENE study will investigate over a short-term observation 
period (by magnetic-resonance imaging, post-resection histology and assessment 
of technical feasibility) whether focal IRE, as a new ablation procedure for 
soft tissue, is feasible as a percutaneous, tissue-sparing method for complete 
ablation and cure of localised kidney tumours. Results from the kidney-tumour 
model can provide guidance for designing an effectiveness and feasibility trial 
to assess this new ablative technology, particularly in uro-oncology.

Sarcopenia, an age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and function, 
dramatically affects the life quality of elder people. In view of increasing 
life expectancy, sarcopenia renders a heavy burden on the health care system. 
However, although there is a consensus that sarcopenia is a multifactorial 
syndrome, its etiology, underlying mechanisms, and even definition remain poorly 
delineated, thus, preventing development of a precise treatment strategy. The 
main aim of our review is to critically analyze potential sarcopenia biomarkers 
in light of the molecular mechanisms of their involvement in sarcopenia 
pathogenesis. Normal muscle mass and function maintenance are proposed to be 
dependent on the dynamic balance between the positive regulators of muscle 
growth such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF), follistatin (FST) and irisin, and negative regulators including 
TGFβ, myostatin, activins A and B, and growth and differentiation factor-15 
(GDF-15). We hypothesize that the shift in this balance to muscle growth 
inhibitors, along with increased expression of the C- terminal agrin fragment 
(CAF) associated with age-dependent neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dysfunction, as 
well as skeletal muscle-specific troponin T (sTnT), a key component of 
contractile machinery, is a main mechanism underlying sarcopenia pathogenesis. 
Thus, this review proposes and emphasizes that these molecules are the emerging 
sarcopenia biomarkers.

OBJECTIVE: Information on the current burden of stroke in Africa is limited. The 
aim of this review was to comprehensively examine the current and projected 
burden of stroke in Africa.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed the available literature (PubMed and AJOL) 
from January 1960 and June 2014 on stroke in Africa. Percentage change in 
age-adjusted stroke incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) for African countries between 1990 and 2010 were calculated from the 
Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) model-derived figures.
RESULTS: Community-based studies revealed an age-standardised annual stroke 
incidence rate of up to 316 per 100,000 population, and age-standardised 
prevalence rates of up to 981 per 100,000. Model-based estimates showed 
significant mean increases in age-standardised stroke incidence. The peculiar 
factors responsible for the substantial disparities in incidence velocity, 
ischaemic stroke proportion, mean age and case fatality compared to high-income 
countries remain unknown.
CONCLUSIONS: While the available study data and evidence are limited, the burden 
of stroke in Africa appears to be increasing.

BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is thought to develop as a result of 
inflammatory processes in the aortic wall. In particular, mast cells are 
believed to play a central role. The AORTA trial was undertaken to investigate 
whether the mast cell inhibitor, pemirolast, could retard the growth of 
medium-sized AAAs. In preclinical and clinical trials, pemirolast has been shown 
to inhibit antigen-induced allergic reactions.
METHODS: Inclusion criteria for the trial were patients with an AAA of 39-49 mm 
in diameter on ultrasound imaging. Among exclusion criteria were previous aortic 
surgery, diabetes mellitus, and severe concomitant disease with a life 
expectancy of less than 2 years. Included patients were treated with 10, 25 or 
40 mg pemirolast, or matching placebo for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was 
change in aortic diameter as measured from leading edge adventitia at the 
anterior wall to leading edge adventitia at the posterior wall in systole. All 
ultrasound scans were read in a central imaging laboratory.
RESULTS: Some 326 patients (mean age 70·8 years; 88·0 per cent men) were 
included in the trial. The overall mean growth rate was 2·42 mm during the 
12-month study. There was no statistically significant difference in growth 
between patients receiving placebo and those in the three dose groups of 
pemirolast. Similarly, there were no differences in adverse events.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with pemirolast did not retard the growth of medium-sized 
AAAs.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a 
behavioral intervention for urinary incontinence of prostate cancer patients. 
Study subjects were either participating in or eligible but declined (i.e., 
nonparticipating) the active intervention study.
METHODS: The intervention-participating subjects were randomized into three 
groups, including two intervention groups (support and telephone groups) and a 
usual care reference group. Intervention-nonparticipating subjects were 
concurrently enrolled. Intervention effectiveness was assessed on the EQ-5D 
measure. The costs included direct healthcare cost from medical billing data, 
patient out-of-pocket expense, caregiver expense, patient loss-of-work cost, and 
intervention cost. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
from societal, provider, and patient perspectives.
RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-seven intervention-participating and 69 
intervention-nonparticipating post-cancer treatment patients were included. The 
support and telephone groups, but not the usual care group, had significantly 
higher EQ-5D index scores (0.054, p = 0.033, and 0.057, p = 0.026, respectively) 
than the intervention-nonparticipating group at month 6. Within 6 months, 
intervention cost per subject was $252 and $484, respectively, for providers, 
and $564 and $203, respectively, for the support and phone group subjects. The 
final ICERs were $16,759 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and $12,561/QALY 
for support and telephone groups, compared with those of the 
intervention-nonparticipating group. These ICERs are much smaller than 
$50,000/QALY, the consensus threshold to determine cost-effectiveness for 
society.
CONCLUSIONS: The study interventions are cost-effective in consideration of 
eligible patients who declined the interventions. The interventions can provide 
meaningful outcome improvement on urinary continence at a low cost. This 
evidence provides critical information for future health policy decision-making 
of healthcare providers and payers.

Institutet, Sweden olof.ostergren@chess.su.se.

AIMS: Although absolute levels of mortality have decreased among Swedish men and 
women in recent decades, educational inequalities in mortality have increased, 
especially among women. The aim of this study is to disentangle the role of 
income and family type in educational inequalities in mortality in Sweden during 
1990-2009, focusing on gender differences.
METHODS: Data on individuals born in Sweden between the ages of 30 and 74 years 
were collected from total population registries, covering a total of 529,275 
deaths and 729 million person-months. Temporary life expectancies (age 30-74 
years) by education were calculated using life tables, and rate ratios were 
estimated with Poisson regression with robust standard errors.
RESULTS: Temporary life expectancy improved among all groups except low educated 
women. Relative educational inequalities in mortality (RRs) increased from 1.79 
to 1.98 among men and from 1.78 to 2.10 among women. Variation in family type 
explained some of the inequalities among men, but not among women, and did not 
contribute to the trend. Variation in income explained a larger part of the 
educational inequalities among men compared to women and also explained the 
increase in educational inequalities in mortality among men and women.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing educational inequalities in mortality in Sweden may be 
attributed to the increase in income inequalities in mortality.

The spine is a frequent localization of primary tumours or metastasis involving 
posterior arch, pedicles and vertebra body, and often causing unsustainable 
pain. The management of spinal metastasis remains complex, including medical 
therapy (corticosteroids, chemotherapy), radiotherapy and surgical treatment, or 
the recent percutaneous mini-invasive approach. The target of all these 
treatments is to improve the quality of life of patients affected by this type 
of lesion. Diagnosis of spinal metastasis and then its treatment should be based 
on the combination of different elements: clinical evaluation, CT, MRI and 
nuclear medicine patterns, considering the age of the patient, known primary 
tumour, location of the lesions, single/multiple lesions, pattern of morphology 
(border, matrix, expansile character, soft tissue extension), density or signal 
intensity, oncologic instability and expectancy of life. The percutaneous 
mini-invasive approach for patients affected by secondary lesions involving the 
spine has as treatment goal of: (1) pain relief improving the quality of life; 
(2) stability treatment re-establishing the spinal biomechanics, alterated by 
bone destruction or deformity, preventing pathological fracture; and (3) an 
anti-neoplastic effect. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive 
diagnostic and percutaneous approach to the bone metastatic spine lesions, 
identifying which metamer should be treated to improve patient quality of life, 
showing the importance of a multi-disciplinary approach to this problem.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to compare the ability of the Global 
Activity Limitation Indicator (GALI) and self-rated health (SRH) to predict 
all-cause mortality in the general adult population.
METHODS: We linked the 2001 Belgian Health Interview Survey with mortality and 
migration registers 2001-2010. The baseline sample included 8,583 individuals 
aged 15 years and older. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the 
effect of the GALI and SRH on mortality rate during follow-up. We investigated 
the impact of gender, age, education and follow-up period on the association 
between the GALI/SRH and mortality.
RESULTS: The GALI and SRH were strong and complementary predictors of mortality 
in the Belgian adult population. Although the two global instruments shared some 
traits, they predicted mortality concurrently, with some indication of a 
somewhat stronger effect for SRH. We found neither significant differences 
between men and women, nor between education groups. The predictive effect of 
the GALI and SRH slightly decreased over time and the predictive effect of SRH 
slightly decreased with age.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the GALI and SRH are useful and 
complementary measures for assessing the health and functional status of adults 
in population surveys.

Cost and safety of assisted reproductive technologies for human immunodeficiency 
virus-1 discordant couples.

of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10002, Taiwan.

Due to significant advances in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 
type-1 (HIV-1), HIV-1 infection gradually has become a treatable chronic 
disease. Successfully treated HIV-positive individuals can have a normal life 
expectancy. Hence, more and more HIV-1 discordant couples in Taiwan and the rest 
of the world are seeking fertility assistance. Pre-treatment of highly active 
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) combined with sperm washing and RT-polymerase 
chain reaction examination for HIV-1 viral load has become the standard 
procedure to assist them to conceive. However, in order to reduce the 
transmission risk to the lowest level for the couple and to diminish the cost of 
health care for the insurance institutes or government, in vitro fertilization 
(IVF)-intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) therapy provides the ideal 
solution for HIV-1 discordant couples with infected men. Intrauterine 
insemination (IUI) theoretically introduces more than 10(7) times of sperm 
counts or semen volume to uninfected women vs IVF-ICSI. However, since some 
regimens of HAART may significantly decrease the sperm motility, compared to 
IVF-ICSI, IUI only produces 1/5 to 1/2 pregnancy rates per cycle. Given the risk 
of seroconversion of HIV infection which actually happens after successful 
treatment, IVF-ICSI for these HIV-1 seropositive men is more cost-effective and 
should be the first line treatment for these cases.

The 2015 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections included new 
and exciting advances in the realm of antiretroviral therapy. The Temprano trial 
demonstrated benefits from early antiretroviral therapy and isoniazid preventive 
therapy. Important data on investigational antiretroviral drugs were presented, 
including tenofovir alafenamide fumarate and BMS-955176, an HIV-1 maturation 
inhibitor. Novel data on the HIV care continuum from resource-rich and -limited 
settings highlighted persistent sex- and race-related disparities in care 
engagement, and the crucial need to bring HIV testing and care into the 
community to improve engagement across the care continuum. Life expectancy data 
from resource-limited settings reveal dramatic improvements across sub-Saharan 
Africa, although people with HIV still live 5 years to 10 years less than those 
without HIV, and new cost-effectiveness research revealed that the price of 
antiretroviral therapy itself remains a key driver of cost and 
cost-effectiveness calculations. Results from the PROMISE trial showed reduced 
rates of mother-to-child transmission among women who received antiretroviral 
therapy with 3 drugs compared with women who received zidovudine monotherapy, 
supporting current World Health Organization guidelines.

Crystalline cellulose nanofibril (CNF) was isolated from cotton linter pulp 
using an acid hydrolysis method and used as a filler to reinforce sodium 
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) film. The CNF was in rod shape with the diameter 
of 23-38 nm and the length of 125-217 nm and crystallinity index (CI) was 0.89. 
The effect of CNF concentration (1, 3, 5, and 10 wt% based on CMC) on the 
optical, morphological, mechanical, water vapor barrier, surface hydrophobicity, 
and thermal properties of the nanocomposites were studied. The CNF was evenly 
distributed in the polymer matrix to form smooth and flexible films indicating 
the CNF is highly compatible with the CMC. The tensile strength (TS) and elastic 
modulus (EM) of CMC film increased by 23% and 27%, respectively, while the 
elongation (E) decreased by 28% with 5 wt% of CNF inclusion. The WVP of CMC film 
decreased at low content of CNF, and increased with increase in CNF content, 
then decreased but to the same level of the control CMC film with the inclusion 
of 10 wt% of CNF. Transparency of CMC film decreased slightly from 87.7% to 
86.2% with 5 wt% of CNF. The CMC/CNF composite films have a high potential to be 
used as an edible coating or packaging films for the extension of shelf life of 
fresh and minimally processed fruits and vegetables.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) and quantitative risk assessment (QRA) are commonly 
used to evaluate potential human health impacts associated with proposed or 
existing infrastructure and products. Each approach has a distinct objective 
and, consequently, their conclusions may be inconsistent or contradictory. It is 
proposed that the integration of elements of QRA and LCA may provide a more 
holistic approach to health impact assessment. Here we examine the possibility 
of merging LCA assessed human health impacts with quantitative microbial risk 
assessment (QMRA) for waterborne pathogen impacts, expressed with the common 
health metric, disability adjusted life years (DALYs). The example of a recent 
large-scale water recycling project in Sydney, Australia was used to identify 
and demonstrate the potential advantages and current limitations of this 
approach. A comparative analysis of two scenarios - with and without the 
development of this project - was undertaken for this purpose. LCA and QMRA were 
carried out independently for the two scenarios to compare human health impacts, 
as measured by DALYs lost per year. LCA results suggested that construction of 
the project would lead to an increased number of DALYs lost per year, while 
estimated disease burden resulting from microbial exposures indicated that it 
would result in the loss of fewer DALYs per year than the alternative scenario. 
By merging the results of the LCA and QMRA, we demonstrate the advantages in 
providing a more comprehensive assessment of human disease burden for the two 
scenarios, in particular, the importance of considering the results of both LCA 
and QRA in a comparative assessment of decision alternatives to avoid problem 
shifting. The application of DALYs as a common measure between the two 
approaches was found to be useful for this purpose.

What is the association of smoking and alcohol use with the increase in social 
inequality in mortality in Denmark? A nationwide register-based study.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to estimate the impact of smoking and 
alcohol use on the increase in social inequality in mortality in Denmark in the 
period 1985-2009.
DESIGN: A nationwide register-based study.
SETTING: Denmark.
PARTICIPANTS: The whole Danish population aged 30 years or more in the period 
1985-2009.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome is mortality rates 
in relation to educational attainments calculated with and without deaths 
related to smoking and alcohol use. An absolute measure of inequality in 
mortality is applied along with a result on the direct contribution from smoking 
and alcohol use on the absolute difference in mortality rates. The secondary 
outcome is life expectancy in relation to educational attainments.
RESULTS: Since 1985, Danish overall mortality rates have decreased. Alongside 
the improvement in mortality, the absolute difference in the mortality rate (per 
100,000 persons) between the lowest and the highest educated quartile grew from 
465 to 611 among men and from 250 to 386 among women. Smoking and alcohol use 
have caused 75% of the increase among men and 97% of the increase among women. 
Among men the increase was mainly caused by alcohol. In women the increase was 
mainly caused by smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: The main explanation for the increase in social inequality in 
mortality since the mid-1980s is smoking and alcohol use. A significant 
reduction in the social inequality in mortality can only happen if the 
prevention of smoking and alcohol use are targeted to the lower educated part of 
the Danish population.

BACKGROUND: The global volume of surgery is estimated at 312.9 million 
operations annually, but rates of surgery vary dramatically. Identifying 
surgical rates associated with improved health outcomes would be useful for 
benchmarking and targeted health system strengthening.
METHODS: We identified rates of surgery associated with a life expectancy (LE) 
of 74-75 years, a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of less than or equal to 100 
per 100,000 live births, and the estimated need for surgery in the seven global 
burden of disease (GBD) super-regions based on the prevalence of surgical 
conditions. We compared our findings to surgical rates from Chile, China, Costa 
Rica, and Cuba ("4C"), countries with moderate resources but high health 
outcomes.
RESULTS: The median surgical rates associated with LE of 74-75 years (N = 17) 
and MMR below 100 (N = 109) are 4392 (IQR 2897-4873) and 5028 (IQR 4139-6778) 
operations per 100,000 people annually, respectively. The mean surgical rate 
estimated for the seven super-regions was 4723 (95% CI 3967-5478) operations per 
100,000 people annually. The "4C" countries had a mean surgical rate of 4344 
(95% CI 2620-6068) operations per 100,000 people annually. Thirteen of the 
twenty-one GBD regions, accounting for 78% of the world's population, do not 
achieve rates of surgery at the lowest end of this range.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a narrow range of surgical rates associated with 
important health indicators. This target range can be used for benchmarking of 
surgical services, and as part of a policy aimed at strengthening health care 
systems and surgical capacity.

BACKGROUND: There is some evidence that school-based interventions are effective 
in preventing childhood obesity. However, longer term outcomes, equity of 
effects and cost-effectiveness of interventions have not been assessed. The aim 
of this trial is to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a 
multi-component intervention programme targeting the school and family 
environment through primary schools, in preventing obesity in 6-7 year old 
children, compared to usual practice.
METHODS: This cluster randomised controlled trial is set in 54 primary schools 
within the West Midlands, UK, including a multi-ethnic, socioeconomically 
diverse population of children aged 6-7 years. The 12-month intervention 
consists of healthy diet and physical activity promotion. These include: 
activities to increase time spent doing physical activity within the school day, 
participation in the 'Villa Vitality' programme (a programme that is delivered 
by an iconic sporting institution (Aston Villa Football Club), which provides 
interactive learning opportunities for physical activity and healthy eating), 
healthy cooking skills workshops in school time for parents and children, and 
provision of information to families signposting local leisure opportunities. 
The primary (clinical) outcome is the difference in body mass index (BMI) 
z-scores between arms at 3 and 18 months post-intervention completion. Cost per 
Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) will also be assessed. The sample size 
estimate (1000 children split across 50 schools at follow-up) is based on 90% 
power to detect differences in BMI z-score of 0.25 (estimated ICC ≤ 0.04), 
assuming a correlation between baseline and follow-up BMI z-score of 0.9. 
Treatment effects will be examined using mixed model ANCOVA. Primary analysis 
will adjust for baseline BMI z-score, and secondary analysis will adjust for 
pre-specified baseline school and child level covariates.
DISCUSSION: The West Midlands ActiVe lifestyle and healthy Eating in School 
children (WAVES) study is the first trial that will examine the 
cost-effectiveness and long term outcomes of a childhood obesity prevention 
programme in a multi-ethnic population, with a sufficient sample size to detect 
clinically important differences in adiposity. The intervention was developed 
using the Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions, and 
outcomes are measured objectively, together with a comprehensive process 
evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Autocatalytic sets are considered to be fundamental to the origin of 
life. Prior theoretical and computational work on the existence and properties 
of these sets has relied on a fast algorithm for detectingself-sustaining 
autocatalytic sets in chemical reaction systems. Here, we introduce and apply a 
modified version and several extensions of the basic algorithm: (i) a 
modification aimed at reducing the number of calls to the computationally most 
expensive part of the algorithm, (ii) the application of a previously introduced 
extension of the basic algorithm to sample the smallest possible autocatalytic 
sets within a reaction network, and the application of a statistical test which 
provides a probable lower bound on the number of such smallest sets, (iii) the 
introduction and application of another extension of the basic algorithm to 
detect autocatalytic sets in a reaction system where molecules can also inhibit 
(as well as catalyse) reactions, (iv) a further, more abstract, extension of the 
theory behind searching for autocatalytic sets.
RESULTS: (i) The modified algorithm outperforms the original one in the number 
of calls to the computationally most expensive procedure, which, in some cases 
also leads to a significant improvement in overall running time, (ii) our 
statistical test provides strong support for the existence of very large numbers 
(even millions) of minimal autocatalytic sets in a well-studied polymer model, 
where these minimal sets share about half of their reactions on average, (iii) 
"uninhibited" autocatalytic sets can be found in reaction systems that allow 
inhibition, but their number and sizes depend on the level of inhibition 
relative to the level of catalysis.
CONCLUSIONS: (i) Improvements in the overall running time when searching for 
autocatalytic sets can potentially be obtained by using a modified version of 
the algorithm, (ii) the existence of large numbers of minimal autocatalytic sets 
can have important consequences for the possible evolvability of autocatalytic 
sets, (iii) inhibition can be efficiently dealt with as long as the total number 
of inhibitors is small.

Stereotypical reaching movements of the octopus involve both bend propagation 
and arm elongation.

The bend propagation involved in the stereotypical reaching movement of the 
octopus arm has been extensively studied. While these studies have analyzed the 
kinematics of bend propagation along the arm during its extension, possible 
length changes have been ignored. Here, the elongation profiles of the reaching 
movements of Octopus vulgaris were assessed using three-dimensional 
reconstructions. The analysis revealed that, in addition to bend propagation, 
arm extension movements involve elongation of the proximal part of the arm, 
i.e., the section from the base of the arm to the propagating bend. The 
elongations are quite substantial and highly variable, ranging from an average 
strain along the arm of -0.12 (i.e. shortening) up to 1.8 at the end of the 
movement (0.57 ± 0.41, n = 64 movements, four animals). Less variability was 
discovered in an additional set of experiments on reaching movements (0.64 ± 
0.28, n = 30 movements, two animals), where target and octopus positions were 
kept more stationary. Visual observation and subsequent kinematic analysis 
suggest that the reaching movements can be broadly segregated into two groups. 
The first group involves bend propagation beginning at the base of the arm and 
propagating towards the arm tip. In the second, the bend is formed or present 
more distally and reaching is achieved mainly by elongation and straightening of 
the segment proximal to the bend. Only in the second type of movements is 
elongation significantly positively correlated with the distance of the bend 
from the target. We suggest that reaching towards a target is generated by a 
combination of both propagation of a bend along the arm and arm elongation. 
These two motor primitives may be combined to create a broad spectrum of 
reaching movements. The dynamical model, which recapitulates the biomechanics of 
the octopus muscular hydrostatic arm, suggests that achieving the observed 
elongation requires an extremely low ratio of longitudinal to transverse muscle 
force (<0.0016 for an average strain along the arm of around 0.5). This was not 
observed and moreover such extremely low value does not seem to be 
physiologically possible. Hence the assumptions made in applying the dynamic 
model to behaviors such as static arm stiffening that leads to arm extension 
through bend propagation and the patterns of activation used to simulate such 
behaviors should be modified to account for movements combining bend propagation 
and arm elongation.

BACKGROUND: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the percutaneous mitral valve 
repair (PMVR) using Carillon® Mitral Contour System® (Cardiac Dimensions Inc., 
Kirkland, WA, USA) in patients with congestive heart failure accompanied by 
moderate to severe functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) compared to the 
prolongation of optimal medical treatment (OMT).
METHODS: Cost-utility analysis using a combination of a decision tree and Markov 
process was performed. The clinical effectiveness was determined based on the 
results of the Transcatheter Implantation of Carillon Mitral Annuloplasty Device 
(TITAN) trial. The mean age of the target population was 62 years, 77% of the 
patients were males, 64% of the patients had severe FMR and all patients had New 
York Heart Association functional class III. The epidemiological, cost and 
utility data were derived from the literature. The analysis was performed from 
the German statutory health insurance perspective over 10-year time horizon.
RESULTS: Over 10 years, the total cost was €36,785 in the PMVR arm and €18,944 
in the OMT arm. However, PMVR provided additional benefits to patients with an 
1.15 incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and an 1.41 incremental life 
years. The percutaneous procedure was cost-effective in comparison to OMT with 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €15,533/QALY. Results were robust in 
the deterministic sensitivity analysis. In the probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis with a willingness-to-pay threshold of €35,000/QALY, PMVR had a 84 % 
probability of being cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous mitral valve repair may be cost-effective in 
inoperable patients with FMR due to heart failure.
