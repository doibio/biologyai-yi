PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We summarize the evidence of benefits, harms, and tools to 
assist in individualized decisions among older adults in screening for breast, 
prostate, colon, lung, and cervical cancer.
RECENT FINDINGS: The benefits of cancer screening in older adults remain unclear 
due to minimal inclusion of adults > 75 years old in most randomized controlled 
trials. Indirect evidence suggests that the benefits of screening seen in 
younger adults (< 70 years old) can be extrapolated to older adults when they 
have an estimated life expectancy of at least 10 years. However, older adults, 
especially those with limited life expectancy, may be at increased risk for 
experiencing harms of screening, including overdiagnosis of clinically 
unimportant diseases, complications from diagnostic procedures, and distress 
after false positive test results. We provide a framework to integrate key 
factors such as health status, risks and benefits of specific tests, and patient 
preferences to guide clinicians in cancer screening decisions in older adults.

Background: Substantial uncertainty exists about how providers assess the value 
of genomic testing. Materials & methods: We developed and administered a 
discrete choice experiment to a national sample of providers. We analyzed 
responses using an error components mixed logit model. Results: We received 
responses from 356 providers. The attributes important to providers were patient 
health and function, life expectancy, cost, expert agreement, and biomarker 
prevalence. Providers significantly valued reducing uncertainty only when it 
eliminated the possibility of decreased life expectancy. Providers valued 
improving certainty about life expectancy gains from 12 ± 18 to 12 ± 6 months at 
US$400 (US$200-600) versus US$200 (-US$60-500) for 4 ± 4 to 4 ± 2 years. 
Conclusion: Providers value resolving uncertainty most when it eliminates the 
possibility of substantial harm.

The three-cornered alfalfa hopper, Spissistilus festinus (Say), was shown to 
transmit Grapevine red blotch virus (GRBV), the causative agent for Grapevine 
red blotch disease, in a greenhouse study on grapes. GRBV is a major concern of 
wine grape growers due to its economic impact on wine quality. Plants in the 
family Fabaceae are preferred hosts of S. festinus and are commonly planted as 
cover crops or present in a vineyard's native vegetation. In late winter, during 
grapevine dormancy, S. festinus migrate into vineyards to feed and reproduce on 
these cover crop and weed hosts. Tilling vineyard floor vegetation provides 
growers an opportunity to disrupt the life cycle of early instars that are 
relatively immobile, reducing the S. festinus first-generation population. 
Nymphal presence is difficult to detect. First through third instars were not 
detected in sweep net samples in a 2-yr weekly sampling study, whereas fourth 
and fifth instars were first found on the same sample date as emerging adults. A 
degree-day model was developed and successfully predicted when early S. festinus 
instars are present in the vineyard to aid in exploiting the time period when S. 
festinus is most susceptible to cultural control measures.

This phase 3 multicenter study, including 26-week treatment and extension 
periods, evaluated the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in Japanese patients 
with active ulcers due to pyoderma gangrenosum. Patients received adalimumab 
160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, and then 40 mg every week starting at week 4. 
Of the 22 enrolled patients, 12 (54.5%, P < 0.001) achieved the primary efficacy 
end-point of pyoderma gangrenosum area reduction 100 (PGAR 100, defined as 
complete skin re-epithelialization) for the target ulcer at week 26 assessed by 
digital planimetry. PGAR 100 response was observed as early as week 6 (13.6%) 
and continued to increase over time. The mean percent change from baseline in 
target ulcer area was -31.8% at week 6 and -63.8% at week 26. A Physician's 
Global Assessment score of 0 (PGA 0, all ulcers completely clear) was achieved 
by two patients (9.1%) at week 6 and eight (36.4%) at week 26, while PGA 0/1 
(completely/almost clear) was achieved by five (22.7%) and 12 patients (54.5%) 
at week 6 and 26, respectively. Mean changes from baseline in pain numeric 
rating scale (-1.8 at week 6 and -2.5 at week 26) and the Dermatology Life 
Quality Index (-3.1 at week 6 and -3.6 at week 26) improved over time. Adverse 
events were reported by 18 patients, most commonly infections (n = 11), and 
serious adverse events by four. These results suggest that adalimumab is 
effective and generally well tolerated in Japanese patients with active ulcers 
of pyoderma gangrenosum.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a carcinogenesis event that 
promotes metastasis and resistance to therapy by unclear mechanisms. Expression 
of the colon cancer-associated transcript 2 gene (CCAT2), which encodes a long 
noncoding RNA (lncRNA), associates with CIN, but little is known about how CCAT2 
lncRNA regulates this cancer enabling characteristic.
METHODS: We performed cytogenetic analysis of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines 
(HCT116, KM12C/SM, and HT29) overexpressing CCAT2 and colon organoids from 
C57BL/6N mice with the CCAT2 transgene and without (controls). CRC cells were 
also analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy, γ-H2AX, and senescence assays. 
CCAT2 transgene and control mice were given azoxymethane and dextran sulfate 
sodium to induce colon tumors. We performed gene expression array and mass 
spectrometry to detect downstream targets of CCAT2 lncRNA. We characterized 
interactions between CCAT2 with downstream proteins using MS2 pull-down, RNA 
immunoprecipitation, and selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer 
extension analyses. Downstream proteins were overexpressed in CRC cells and 
analyzed for CIN. Gene expression levels were measured in CRC and non-tumor 
tissues from 5 cohorts, comprising more than 900 patients.
RESULTS: High expression of CCAT2 induced CIN in CRC cell lines and increased 
resistance to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. Mice that expressed the CCAT2 
transgene developed chromosome abnormalities, and colon organoids derived from 
crypt cells of these mice had a higher percentage of chromosome abnormalities 
compared with organoids from control mice. The transgenic mice given 
azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium developed more and larger colon polyps 
than control mice given these agents. Microarray analysis and mass spectrometry 
indicated that expression of CCAT2 increased expression of genes involved in 
ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. CCAT2 lncRNA interacted directly with 
and stabilized BOP1 ribosomal biogenesis factor (BOP1). CCAT2 also increased 
expression of MYC, which activated expression of BOP1. Overexpression of BOP1 in 
CRC cell lines resulted in chromosomal missegregation errors, and increased 
colony formation, and invasiveness, whereas BOP1 knockdown reduced viability. 
BOP1 promoted CIN by increasing the active form of aurora kinase B, which 
regulates chromosomal segregation. BOP1 was overexpressed in polyp tissues from 
CCAT2 transgenic mice compared with healthy tissue. CCAT2 lncRNA and BOP1 mRNA 
or protein were all increased in microsatellite stable tumors (characterized by 
CIN), but not in tumors with microsatellite instability compared with nontumor 
tissues. Increased levels of CCAT2 lncRNA and BOP1 mRNA correlated with each 
other and with shorter survival times of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that overexpression of CCAT2 in colon cells promotes CIN 
and carcinogenesis by stabilizing and inducing expression of BOP1 an activator 
of aurora kinase B. Strategies to target this pathway might be developed for 
treatment of patients with microsatellite stable colorectal tumors.

BACKGROUND: The results of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9343 trial 
showed that radiation therapy (RT) did not improve survival for women older than 
70 y with early-stage estrogen receptor + breast cancer treated with breast 
conserving surgery and adjuvant endocrine therapy. In 2005, guidelines were 
modified to allow for RT omission; however, minimal change in clinical practice 
has occurred. The aim of this study was to determine if CALGB long-term 
follow-up data have affected RT utilization, and to characterize the population 
still receiving RT after breast conserving surgery.
METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database was 
used to identify women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer from 2004 to 
2015 who matched the CALGB 9343 inclusion criteria. Multivariate logistic 
regression was carried out to identify the factors that affect the receipt of 
radiation therapy. We also plotted the overall use of RT over time juxtaposed 
with the temporal trends of CALGB 9343 clinical trial data, guideline 
recommendations, and publishing of long-term survival data.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 25,723 Medicare beneficiaries, of whom 20,328 
(79%) received RT and 5395 (21%) did not receive RT. In a multivariate model, 
the frequency of RT omission increased over time, with those diagnosed in year 
2015 being 2.72 times more likely to omit RT compared with those diagnosed in 
2004 (95% confidence interval 2.31-3.19).
CONCLUSIONS: This study investigated the impact of long-term CALGB 9343 data on 
clinical practice. The results of this study support results from previous 
studies, extend the dates of analysis, and indicate that after long-term 
follow-up of CALGB 9343 data, RT was less used, but overall trends did not 
dramatically decrease.

The present study was conducted during a time of drought to assess the 
concentration of herbicides and their potential for accumulation in marine biota 
found in the near shore marine environment of an urban setting (Camps Bay, Cape 
Town, South Africa). The purpose was to establish whether raw sewage containing 
selected persistent chemicals that are released through a local marine outfall 
would be sufficiently diluted by the ocean to prevent impact on the near-shore 
marine environment of the suburb Camps Bay. Samples of seawater, sediment, 
seaweed, and selected marine organisms present in the near shore environment, 
such as limpets (Cymbula granatina), mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), and 
sea urchins (Parechinus angulosus), were analysed for five indicator herbicides, 
namely atrazine, alachlor, simazine, metolachlor, and butachlor, with gas 
chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer. The concentration of the 
compounds detected ranged from below the limit of detection (<LOD) to 4.2 ng/L 
in seawater, <LOD to 45.3 ng/g dry weight (dw) in sediments, <LOD to 157.8 ng/g 
dw in marine organisms, and between 12.3 and 87.0 ng/g dw in seaweed. Results of 
ecological risk assessment for acute and chronic risk, calculated following the 
US Environmental Protection Agency method, showed a possible threat to the near 
shore environment from sewage released by the marine outfall, as the herbicide 
contamination in the biota posed a low to high ecotoxicological risk for marine 
organisms. The hazard quotients and carcinogenic risk caused by herbicide 
pollution in Camps Bay seawater were above the acceptable level indicating that 
these chemicals pose adverse health effects, should an average sized human 
(70 kg) consume any of the marine species analysed herein on a daily basis 
(daily consumption of 54 g), over a lifetime period (life expectancy of 
70 years). The study also indicated the extensive use of these herbicides for 
cosmetic and ornamental purposes in gardening, or for weed control in an urban 
setting, thus, it is apparent that consumers and municipalities need to be 
educated about their inadvertent use and safe disposal of these compounds. The 
use of these herbicides to control weeds within the area and discharge of sewage 
to Camps Bay must be checked through adequate control of the trade, handling of 
herbicides, and enforcement of appropriate sanctions and development of suitable 
regulations.

With the increase in the expectancy of the life span of humans, 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) have imposed a considerable burden on the 
family, society, and nation. In defiance of the breakthroughs in the knowledge 
of the pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms of various NDs, very little 
success has been achieved in developing effective therapies. This review draws a 
bead on the availability of the nutraceuticals to date for various NDs 
(Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
Huntington's disease, vascular cognitive impairment, Prion disease, 
Spinocerebellar ataxia, Spinal muscular atrophy, Frontotemporal dementia, and 
Pick's disease) focusing on their various mechanisms of action in various in 
vivo and in vitro models of NDs. This review is distinctive in its compilation 
to critically review preclinical and clinical studies of the maximum 
phytochemicals in amelioration and prevention of almost all kinds of 
neurodegenerative diseases and address their possible mechanism of action. 
PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library searches were used for preclinical studies, 
while ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed were searched for clinical updates. The 
results from preclinical studies demonstrate the efficacious effects of the 
phytochemicals in various NDs while clinical reports showing mixed results with 
promise for phytochemical use as an adjunct to the conventional treatment in 
various NDs. These studies together suggest that phytochemicals can 
significantly act upon different mechanisms of disease such as oxidative stress, 
inflammation, apoptotic pathways, and gene regulation. However, further clinical 
studies are needed that should include the appropriate biomarkers of NDs and the 
effect of phytochemicals on them as well as targeting the appropriate 
population.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a progressive loss of neurons in 
the brain or spinal cord that leads to a loss of function of the affected areas. 
The lack of effective treatments and the ever-increasing life expectancy is 
raising the number of individuals affected, having a tremendous social and 
economic impact. The brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage given 
the high energy demand, low levels of antioxidant defenses, and high levels of 
metal ions. Driven by age-related changes, neurodegeneration is characterized by 
increased oxidative stress leading to irreversible neuronal damage, followed by 
cell death. Nevertheless, neurodegenerative diseases are known as complex 
pathologies where several mechanisms drive neuronal death. Herein we discuss the 
interplay among oxidative stress, proteinopathy, and neuroinflammation at the 
early stages of neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we discuss the use of the 
Nrf2-ARE pathway as a potential therapeutic strategy based on these molecular 
mechanisms to develop transformative medicines.

Ionizing radiation creates free radicals, the effect of which is enhanced by the 
presence of oxygen; a low oxygen level produces radioprotective effects for 
insects compared with irradiation in ambient air. Modified (controlled) 
atmosphere packaging is used for maintaining quality and shelf-life extension; 
therefore, treatment efficacy may be affected, and there is a need to determine 
the critical O2 levels that may cause radioprotective effects. Late third-instar 
Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) larvae were irradiated in bags filled with ambient 
or low-oxygen air (0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% O2) and were exposed to radiation doses of 
8 to 64 Gy with intervals of 8 Gy. Efficacy was measured by the prevention of 
adult emergence. Dose-response data on mortality (failure of adult emergence) 
were analyzed via two-way ANOVA (analysis of variance), ANCOVA (analysis of 
covariance), and probit regression. The difference in radiotolerance was only 
significant in 0% O2 atmospheres through two-way ANOVA; therefore, the 95% 
confidence limits (CLs) of lethal dose ratios at LD99 were used to determine 
significant differences between treatments at different O2 levels. The 
differences in radiotolerance were significant in 0% and 2% O2 but insignificant 
in 4%, 6%, and 8% O2 environments when compared with radiation in ambient air. 
The critical threshold of radioprotective effects for late third-instar B. 
dorsalis larvae is an O2 level of ≥4% and <6%, but a maximum radiation dose of 
14 Gy can compensate for this effect during phytosanitary irradiation treatment.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the hypothesis that an adjunctive therapy with 
methylprednisolone and unfractionated heparin (UFH) or with methylprednisolone 
and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are more effective in reducing any-cause 
mortality in critically-ill ventilated patients with pneumonia from SARS-CoV-2 
infection compared to LMWH alone.
TRIAL DESIGN: The study is designed as a multi-centre, interventional, parallel 
group, superiority, randomized, investigator sponsored, three arms study. 
Patients, who satisfy all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, will be 
randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups in a ratio 1:1:1.
PARTICIPANTS: Inpatients will be recruited from 8 Italian Academic and 
non-Academic Intensive Care Units INCLUSION CRITERIA (ALL REQUIRED): 1. Positive 
SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic (on pharyngeal swab of deep airways material) 2. Positive 
pressure ventilation (either non-invasive or invasive) from > 24 hours 3. 
Invasive mechanical ventilation from < 96 hours 4. PaO2/FiO2 ratio lower than 
150 mmHg 5. D-dimer level > 6 times the upper limit of normal reference range 6. 
C-reactive Protein > 6-fold upper the limit of normal reference range EXCLUSION 
CRITERIA: 1. Age < 18 years 2. On-going treatment with anticoagulant drugs 3. 
Platelet count < 100.000/mm3 4. History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia 5. 
Allergy to sodium enoxaparin or other LMWH, UFH or methylprednisolone 6. Active 
bleeding or on-going clinical condition deemed at high risk of bleeding 
contraindicating anticoagulant treatment 7. Recent (in the last 1 month prior to 
randomization) brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery 8. Chronic assumption or oral 
corticosteroids 9. Pregnancy or breastfeeding or positive pregnancy test. In 
childbearing age women, before inclusion, a pregnancy test will be performed if 
not available 10. Clinical decision to withhold life-sustaining treatment or 
"too sick to benefit" 11. Presence of other severe diseases impairing life 
expectancy (e.g. patients are not expected to survive 28 days given their 
pre-existing medical condition) 12. Lack or withdrawal of informed consent 
INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: • LMWH group: patients in this group will be 
administered enoxaparin at standard prophylactic dosage. • LMWH + steroid group: 
patients in this group will receive enoxaparin at standard prophylactic dosage 
and methylprednisolone. • UFH + steroid group: patients in this group will 
receive UFH at therapeutic dosages and methylprednisolone. UFH will be 
administered intravenously in UFH + steroid group at therapeutic doses. The 
infusion will be started at an infusion rate of 18 UI/kg/hour and then modified 
to obtain aPTT Ratio in between the range of 1.5-2.0. aPTT will be periodically 
checked at intervals no longer than 12 hours. The treatment with UFH will be 
administered up to ICU discharge. After ICU discharge anticoagulant therapy may 
be interrupted or switched to prophylaxis with LMWH in the destination ward up 
to clinical judgement of the attending physician. Enoxaparin will be 
administered in both LMWH group and LMWH + steroid group at standard 
prophylactic dose (i.e., 4000 UI once day, increased to 6000 UI once day for 
patients weighting more than 90 kg). The treatment will be administered 
subcutaneously once a day up to ICU discharge. After ICU discharge it may be 
continued or interrupted in the destination ward up to clinical judgement of the 
attending physician. Methylprednisolone will be administered in both LMWH + 
steroid group and UHF + steroid group intravenously with an initial bolus of 0,5 
mg/kg followed by administration of 0,5 mg/kg 4 times daily for 7 days, 0,5 
mg/kg 3 times daily from day 8 to day 10, 0,5 mg/kg 2 times daily at days 11 and 
12 and 0,5 mg/kg once daily at days 13 and 14.
MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary Efficacy Endpoint: All-cause mortality at day 28 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: - Ventilation free days (VFDs) at day 28, defined 
as the total number of days that patient is alive and free of ventilation 
(either invasive or non-invasive) between randomization and day 28 (censored at 
hospital discharge). - Need of rescue administration of high-dose steroids or 
immune-modulatory drugs; - Occurrence of switch from non-invasive to invasive 
mechanical ventilation during ICU stay; - Delay from start of non-invasive 
ventilation to switch to invasive ventilation; - All-cause mortality at ICU 
discharge and hospital discharge; - ICU free days (IFDs) at day 28, defined as 
the total number of days between ICU discharge and day 28. - Occurrence of new 
infections from randomization to day 28; including infections by Candida, 
Aspergillus, Adenovirus, Herpes Virus e Cytomegalovirus - Occurrence of new 
organ dysfunction and grade of dysfunction during ICU stay. - Objectively 
confirmed venous thromboembolism, stroke or myocardial infarction; Safety 
endpoints: - Occurrence of major bleeding, defined as transfusion of 2 or more 
units of packed red blood cells in a day, bleeding that occurs in at least one 
of the following critical sites [intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular (within 
the corpus of the eye; thus, a conjunctival bleed is not an intraocular bleed), 
pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or 
retroperitoneal], bleeding that necessitates surgical intervention and bleeding 
that is fatal (defined as a bleeding event that was the primary cause of death 
or contributed directly to death); - Occurrence of clinically relevant non-major 
bleeding, defined ad acute clinically overt bleeding that does not meet the 
criteria for major and consists of any bleeding compromising hemodynamic; 
spontaneous hematoma larger than 25 cm2, intramuscular hematoma documented by 
ultrasonography, haematuria that was macroscopic and was spontaneous or lasted 
for more than 24 hours after invasive procedures; haemoptysis, hematemesis or 
spontaneous rectal bleeding requiring endoscopy or other medical intervention or 
any other bleeding requiring temporary cessation of a study drug.
RANDOMIZATION: A block randomisation will be used with variable block sizes 
(block size 4-6-8), stratified by 3 factors: Centre, BMI (<30/≥30) and Age 
(<75/≥75). Central randomisation will be performed using a secure, web-based, 
randomisation system with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. The allocation sequence 
will be generated by the study statistician using computer generated random 
numbers.
BLINDING (MASKING): Participants to the study will be blinded to group 
assignment.
NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The target sample size is based on the 
hypothesis that the combined use of UHF and steroid versus the LMWH group will 
significantly reduce the risk of death at day 28. The overall sample size in 
this study is expected to be 210 with a randomization 1:1:1 and seventy patients 
in each group. Assuming an alpha of 2.5% (two tailed) and mortality rate in LMWH 
group of 50%, as indicated from initial studies of ICU patients, the study will 
have an 80% power to detect at least a 25 % absolute reduction in the risk of 
death between: a) LMHW + steroid group and LMWH group or b) UHF + steroid group 
and LMWH group. The study has not been sized to assess the difference between 
LMHW + steroid group and UHF + steroid group, therefore the results obtained 
from this comparison will need to be interpreted with caution and will need 
further adequately sized studies confirm the effect. On the basis of a 
conservative estimation, that 8 participating sites admit an average of 3 
eligible patients per month per centre (24 patients/month). Assuming that 80 % 
of eligible patients are enrolled, recruitment of 210 participants will be 
completed in approximately 10 months.

The use of mechanical circulatory support for failing Fontan patients is an area 
of growing interest, as the increased life expectancy of these patients 
continues to be accompanied by numerous end-organ complications. In vitro work 
has shown positive results using the CentriMag device for right-sided Fontan 
support, however the generalizability across various patient anatomies and 
cannulations is unknown. Computational simulations are first validated against 
in vitro modeling, then used to assess generalizability and further explore 
hemodynamic metrics including relative pressure changes, hepatic flow 
distribution, wall shear stress and power added. Computational modeling matched 
previous in vitro work very well, with vessel flow rates and relative average 
pressure change each within 1%. Positive results were seen across all patient 
anatomies and cannulations. On average, pressure from the vena cava to pulmonary 
arteries increased by 5.4 mmHg corresponding to 32 mW of power added. Hepatic 
flow distribution and wall shear stress were within acceptable ranges, with an 
average hepatic flow distribution of 47% and all patients showing ≤ 1% of the 
total Fontan connection surface area at a wall shear stress above 150 Pa. The 
positive results previously seen using CentriMag as a right-sided Fontan support 
device were found to be repeatable across multiple patient anatomies and 
cannulations. While animal models and eventual patient studies will provide 
further insight into the efficacy of this support strategy, our findings here 
suggest this method may reproduce right heart function.

BACKGROUND: The interaction between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 
non-communicable diseases may increase the global burden of disease. We assessed 
the association of COVID-19 with ageing and non-communicable diseases.
METHODS: We extracted data regarding non-communicable disease, particularly 
cardiovascular disease, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and 
healthy life expectancy (HALE) from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 
2017. We obtained data of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and tests from the 
Our World in Data database as of May 28, 2020. Potential confounders of pandemic 
outcomes analyzed include institutional lockdown delay, hemispheric geographical 
location, and number of tourists. We compared all countries according to GBD 
classification and World Bank income level. We assessed the correlation between 
independent variables associated with COVID-19 caseload and mortality using 
Spearman's rank correlation and adjusted mixed model analysis.
FINDINGS: High-income had the highest, and the Southeast Asia, East Asia, and 
Oceania region had the least cases per million population (3050.60 vs. 63.86). 
Sub-saharan region has reported the lowest number of COVID-19 mortality (1.9). 
Median delay to lockdown initiation varied from one day following the first case 
in Latin America and Caribbean region, to 34 days in Southeast Asia, East Asia, 
and Oceania. Globally, non-communicable disease DALYs were correlated with 
COVID-19 cases (r = 0.32, p<0.001) and deaths (r = 0.37, p<0.001). HALE 
correlated with COVID-19 cases (r = 0.63, p<0.001) and deaths (r = 0.61, 
p<0.001). HALE was independently associated with COVID-19 case rate and the 
number of tourists was associated with COVID-19 mortality in the adjusted model.
INTERPRETATION: Preventive measures against COVID-19 should protect the public 
from the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases, particularly 
in the elderly. In addition to active COVID-19 surveillance, policymakers should 
utilize this evidence as a guide for prevention and coordination of health 
services. This model is timely, as many countries have begun to reduce social 
isolation.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Empirical analyses of the data available around the word 
concluded that women have longer life span now, when compared to the men. 
Available literature unfortunately could not offer full answers to this 
observation. The "entropic age" concept suggests that ageing related changes in 
the body, such as loss of molecular functions and overwhelming of the 
maintenance systems, may be explained in terms of entropy generation.
METHODS: Telomere-length regulated entropic assessment based on metabolic 
activity with four different diets carried out.
RESULTS: Estimates of the life expectancy of the women on all of these diets is 
longer than those of the men. Faster shortening of the telomere lengths in men 
was the major reason of the shorter life expectancy. The highest and the lowest 
life expectancy for women were estimated with Mediterranean and the vegetarian 
diets, respectively; men were estimated to have the longest life span with the 
vegetarian diet and the shortest life span with the ketogenic diet.
CONCLUSIONS: A higher rate of metabolism causes higher entropy generation and 
hints correlations that can be helpful in future ageing research. Faster 
shortening of the telomere lengths in men was the major reason of the estimation 
of the shorter life span for men.

BACKGROUND: Circulatory diseases continue to be the greatest cause of mortality 
for Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and a major cause 
of persistently lower life expectancy compared with non-Aboriginal Australians. 
The limited information that exists on atrial fibrillation (AF) prevalence in 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is mostly based on hospital 
admission data. This shows AF as principal or additional admission diagnosis was 
1.4 times higher compared to non-Aboriginal Australians, a higher incidence of 
AF across the adult life span after age 20 years and a significantly higher 
prevalence among younger patients. Our study estimates the first national
