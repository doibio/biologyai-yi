We studied the role of peroxisomal catalase in chronological aging of the 
yeastHansenula polymorpha in relation to various growth substrates. 
Catalase-deficient (cat) cells showed a similar chronological life span (CLS) 
relative to the wild-type control upon growth on carbon and nitrogen sources 
that are not oxidized by peroxisomal enzymes. However, when media contained 
methylamine, which is oxidized by peroxisomal amine oxidase, the CLS of cat 
cells was significantly reduced. Conversely, the CLS of cat cells was enhanced 
relative to the wild-type control, when cells were grown on methanol, which is 
oxidized by peroxisomal alcohol oxidase. At these conditions strongly enhanced 
ROS levels were observed during the exponential growth phase of cat cells. This 
was paralleled by activation of the transcription factor Yap1, as well as an 
increase in the levels of the antioxidant enzymes cytochrome c peroxidase and 
superoxide dismutase. Upon deletion of the genes encoding Yap1 or cytochrome c 
peroxidase, the CLS extension of cat cells on methanol was abolished. These 
findings reveal for the first time an important role of enhanced cytochrome c 
peroxidase levels in yeast CLS extension.

Incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm during diagnostic ultrasound for urologic 
disease: our experience.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is increasing 
because of increased life expectancy. There are none or few symptoms related to 
abdominal aortic aneurysm until rupture. After rupture, mortality rates are 
60-80%, but with an elective operation.
METHODS: We performed an observational study on 140 consecutive patients of age 
over 50 years (range 50-82), presented to our clinic to perform a routine 
ultrasound examination of the urinary tract. We consecutively evaluated in these 
patients the possible detection of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
RESULTS: Ultrasonography of the abdomen is the test of choice for the detection 
of the disease, it is an examination of low-cost and non-invasive. It has a high 
diagnostic sensitivity 80%, in our study (result slightly less than the range 
reported by the literature 82-99%) and a specificity of 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of its safety, low cost, ease of use, and wide 
availability, ultrasonography is the most commonly used clinical imaging 
modality. Ultrasonography is the standard method for screening and monitoring 
AAAs that have not ruptured. With the advance in 3-dimensional (3D) imaging, 3D 
ultrasonography has provided a new opportunity to acquire fast and reliable AAA 
measurements, which can not only shorten the time for a ultrasound exam but also 
reduce the workload of AAA surveillance.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In Egypt, Phlebotomus papatasi is the main vector of 
cutaneous leishmaniasis. In nature, P. papatasi feeds on blood from different 
hosts and sucrose (other sugars) mainly from fig fruits. The aim of this study 
was to examine the effects of three food regimes on the life table parameters of 
females mainly the life expectancy as a factor determining the fly's capability 
for Leishmania transmission.
METHODS: Females maintained on different diets (30% sucrose solution, Guinea pig 
blood and sucrose followed by blood) under laboratory conditions were observed 
for offspring emergence to examine the survival period expressed as the median 
emergence time (E50) and female fecundity (females/female). Life table was 
constructed including the mean life expectancy at emergence (e0) as a measure of 
longevity and the mortality rate per day(qx).
RESULTS: Females fed on sucrose-blood has the highest fecundity and the shortest 
E50 compared to those fed on other diets. The mean life expectancy at emergence 
(e0) differed significantly with the highest value being for females fed on 
sucrose.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The calculated expectancies for female life beyond 
the infective age (8 days) indicated that more flies would survive to become 
infective when fed on sucrose-blood meals than those offered blood alone which 
increases its capability for Leishmania transmission.

Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA. phliu@hcp.med.harvard.edu

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify the reduced life expectancy for six 
types of potentially preventable cancer in the United States.
METHODS: A total of 1,579,310 patients diagnosed with cancers of the lung, colon 
and rectum, liver, breast, cervix, or prostate in 1992-2005 were identified from 
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries. The lifetime 
survival functions for the cancer cohort and age-/sex-matched reference 
population were generated using a semi-parametric extrapolation method with 
annual life tables. The average expected years of life lost (EYLL) for cancers 
were calculated by subtracting the estimated life expectancy of the cancer 
cohorts from that of the reference population.
RESULTS: Liver cancer and lung cancer had an average EYLL of over 13 years, 
while the EYLL for prostate cancer was below 2 years. When considering the 
annual incidence in 2012, lung cancer would cause the greatest subtotal of EYLL 
(3,116,000 years) followed by female breast cancer (1,420,000 years) and 
colorectal cancer (932,000 years).
CONCLUSION: The potential life years saved by successful prevention, in terms of 
EYLL since diagnosis, would be substantial for lung cancer, breast cancer, and 
colorectal cancer. This work will inform prioritization of strategies for cancer 
control to minimize the life expectancy loss.

Growth outcome: nutritionist perspective.

Increasing evidence points to a fundamental role of early nutrition on rates of 
growth and development, and later health. We may identify three major fields of 
scientific interest and clinical application. (1) In developing countries poor 
growth is associated with greater risk of morbidity and mortality from 
infectious diseases, mainly lower respiratory infections and diarrhea. In these 
settings, failure to promote compensatory growth may have negative short-term 
consequences, and the nutritionist's task is the primary prevention of nutrient 
deficiencies to promote the full expression of the individual genetic potential, 
while allowing for recovery of early secondary functional deficiencies. (2) A 
second challenge for nutritionists is represented by the approach to growth 
impairments in rare disorders, ranging from congenital disorders to chronic 
infections. Most disorders are favorably influenced by improved nutritional 
status and better growth, and patients may satisfactorily reach adolescence, 
pubertal and reproductive age, up to ageing. Even for the less positive 
conditions, an improvement in the quality of life for families is in any case a 
rewarding aim. (3) A third challenge is represented by the definition of the 
role of nutrition on growth in physiological conditions for all individuals. 
Concern has been raised about the potential adverse long-term consequences of 
accelerated child growth rates, possibly resulting in a predisposition to 
develop non-communicable chronic diseases in the adult age. Accordingly, this 
hypothesis might explain the benefits of breastfeeding in terms of slower early 
growth, and the fetal origins hypothesis in terms of adverse postnatal catch-up 
growth in infants born small. Therefore, growth as viewed by a pediatric 
nutritionist perspective is a complex matter, ranging from the early stages of 
intrauterine development up to adult ages and ageing processes. Cost/benefit 
analyses of interventions on growth such as cost per DALYs (disability-adjusted 
life years) or QALYs (quality-adjusted life years) should be expanded on 
population basis and extended also to congenital and invalidating disorders to 
identify the most effective and economic sustainable strategies of action.

Intentional weight loss in older adults: useful or wasting disease generating 
strategy?

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Strategies for weight management in older adults remain 
controversial as overweight may protect them against mortality whereas weight 
loss may have harmful effects by promoting sarcopenia and bone loss. It has been 
suggested that weight management for obese older adults should focus more on 
maintaining weight and improving physical function than promoting weight loss. 
This review aims to specify whether intentional weight loss in older adults is a 
useful or a wasting disease generating strategy.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent randomized controlled studies have shown that a 
supervised, moderate caloric restriction coupled with regular exercise (both 
aerobic and resistance) in obese older adults do not increase mortality risk and 
may conversely reduce insulin resistance, metabolic complications, and 
disabilities without exacerbating lean mass and bone mineral density loss.
SUMMARY: In obese older adults, moderate weight loss may have beneficial effects 
on comorbidities, functional performances, and quality of life provided that 
regular physical activity can be associated. An individual approach considering 
life expectancy, chronic comorbidities, functional status, personal motivation, 
and social support should be preferred. More research is needed to define the 
circumstances in which cautious dietary restrictions are reasonably justified in 
older adults. In any case, in the oldest (≥80 years) as in frail individuals, it 
seems reasonable to abstain from recommending weight loss.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients 
continues to increase, and more patients become adults with a chronic disease, 
researching the impact of the disorder on male and female infertility has become 
increasingly important. Studies suggest that the prevalence of CF mutations may 
be higher than previously thought and that many mutations are yet to be 
identified.
RECENT FINDINGS: Assisted reproductive technologies can help both infertile male 
and female patients with CF in achieving successful parenthood. In addition, for 
women more health characteristics including baseline pulmonary function have 
been evaluated as predictors of health and pregnancy outcomes.
SUMMARY: Mutations in the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene 
affect both male and female fertility; however, not all CFTR mutations appear to 
cause infertility. Although most men with CF have significant anatomical 
abnormalities of the reproductive tract causing infertility, most women with CF 
have anatomically normal reproductive tracts and up to half may be able to 
conceive spontaneously. Less is known about how CF affects female fertility or 
the treatment options available.

Neurodegenerative disorders are undoubtedly an increasing problem in the health 
sciences, given the increase of life expectancy and occasional vicious life 
style. Despite the fact that the mechanisms of such diseases are far from being 
completely understood, a large number of studies that derive from both the basic 
science and clinical approaches have contributed substantial data in that 
direction. In this review, it is discussed several frontiers of basic research 
on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, in which research groups from three 
departments of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences of the University of São 
Paulo have been involved in a multidisciplinary effort. The main focus of the 
review involves the animal models that have been developed to study cellular and 
molecular aspects of those neurodegenerative diseases, including oxidative 
stress, insulin signaling and proteomic analyses, among others. We anticipate 
that this review will help the group determine future directions of joint 
research in the field and, more importantly, set the level of cooperation we 
plan to develop in collaboration with colleagues of the Nucleus for Applied 
Neuroscience Research that are mostly involved with clinical research in the 
same field.

BACKGROUND: Inhaled dry powder mannitol enhanced mucus clearance and improved 
quality of life over 2 weeks in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. This study's 
objective was to investigate the efficacy and safety of dry powder mannitol over 
12 weeks.
METHODS: Patients with bronchiectasis confirmed by high-resolution CT (HRCT) 
scan, aged 15 to 80 years, with FEV1≥50% predicted and ≥1 L participated in a 
randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients with a negative 
mannitol provocation test were randomized to inhale 320 mg mannitol (n=231) or 
placebo (n=112) bid for 12 weeks. To further assess safety, the same mannitol 
dose/frequency was administered to a patient subset in an open-label extension 
over 52 weeks. Primary end points were changes from baseline at 12 weeks in 24-h 
sputum weight and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference of 4.3 g in terms of change in 
sputum weight over 12 weeks (95% CI, 1.64-7.00; P=.002) between mannitol and 
placebo; however, this was largely driven by a decrease in sputum weight in the 
placebo group. This was associated, in turn, with more antibiotic use in the 
placebo group (50 of 112 [45%]) than in the inhaled mannitol group (85 of 231 
[37%]). There was no statistical difference between the groups (P=.304) in total 
SGRQ score (mannitol, -3.4 points [95% CI, -4.81 to -1.94] vs placebo, -2.1 
points [95% CI, -4.12 to -0.09]). In a subgroup study (n=82), patients receiving 
mannitol showed less small airway mucus plugging on HRCT scan at 12 weeks 
compared with patients receiving placebo (P=.048). Compliance rates were high, 
and mannitol was well tolerated with adverse events similar to those of placebo.
CONCLUSION: Because the difference in sputum weights appears to be associated 
with increased antibiotic use in the placebo group, a larger controlled study is 
now required to investigate the long-term mannitol effect on pulmonary 
exacerbations and antibiotic use.

Regression analysis for competing risks data can be based on generalized 
estimating equations. For the case with right censored data, pseudo-values were 
proposed to solve the estimating equations. In this article we investigate 
robustness of the pseudo-values against violation of the assumption that the 
probability of not being lost to follow-up (un-censored) is independent of the 
covariates. Modified pseudo-values are proposed which rely on a correctly 
specified regression model for the censoring times. Bias and efficiency of these 
methods are compared in a simulation study. Further illustration of the 
differences is obtained in an application to bone marrow transplantation data 
and a corresponding sensitivity analysis.

Anemia is not physiologically associated with increasing age but a symptom of an 
underlying disease. The individual patient's wish, results of geriatric 
assessment, and therapeutic options regarding life expectancy and quality of 
life must be taken into consideration when determining the diagnostic steps to 
be taken. Prevalence of anemia is high, reaching up to 40% among geriatric 
inpatients. There are various reasons for anemia, but the three most frequent 
forms of anemia in the elderly are iron deficient anemia (IDA), anemia of 
chronic diseases (ACD), and unexplained anemia (UA). This article will, 
therefore, be limited to these forms. Until now no guidelines have been 
developed concerning diagnostic and therapeutic steps for anemia in the elderly. 
For basic diagnostics, the analysis of hematologic parameters such as 
hemoglobin, ferritin, and the saturation of transferrin are recommended. 
Therapeutic options have to be chosen according to the underlying disease.

In 2010, we reported the successful clinical outcome related to a 20-month 
course of intravenous, cyclical ceftriaxone, in a patient with adult-onset 
Alexander's disease. We now provide evidence that the progression of the 
patient's signs/symptoms was halted and reversed with a 4-year-long extension of 
the trial.The patient's clinical signs/symptoms were evaluated before the start 
and every 6 months for 6 years. For the early 2 years, without therapy, and for 
the following 4 years, after intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily, for 3 weeks 
monthly during the initial 4 months, then for 15 days monthly.Gait ataxia and 
dysarthria were assessed clinically on a 0 to 4 scale. Palatal myoclonus and 
nystagmus/oscillopsia were monitored by videotape and a self-evaluation scale. 
The degree of disability, measured by a modified Rankin scale, and the brain MRI 
were periodically evaluated.Before ceftriaxone therapy, in a 2-year period, gait 
ataxia and dysarthria worsened from mild to marked, palatal myoclonus spread 
from the soft palate to lower facial muscles, and the patient complained of 
oscillopsia. After 4 years of ceftriaxone therapy, gait ataxia and dysarthria 
improved, from marked to mild at clinical rating scales. The palatal myoclonus 
was undetectable; the patient did not complained of oscillopsia and declared a 
progressively better quality of life. Ceftriaxone was safe.This case report 
provides Class IV evidence that intravenous cycles of ceftriaxone may halt 
and/or reverse the progression of neurodegeneration in patients with adult-onset 
Alexander's disease and may significantly improve their quality of life.

Increases in adult life expectancy in rural South Africa: valuing the scale-up 
of HIV treatment.

The scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is expected to raise adult life 
expectancy in populations with high HIV prevalence. Using data from a population 
cohort of over 101,000 individuals in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, we 
measured changes in adult life expectancy for 2000-2011. In 2003, the year 
before ART became available in the public-sector health system, adult life 
expectancy was 49.2 years; by 2011, adult life expectancy had increased to 60.5 
years--an 11.3-year gain. Based on standard monetary valuation of life, the 
survival benefits of ART far outweigh the costs of providing treatment in this 
community. These gains in adult life expectancy signify the social value of ART 
and have implications for the investment decisions of individuals, governments, 
and donors.

The oral health needs of children, adolescents and young adults affected by a 
mucopolysaccharide disorder.

Alison.James@bch.nhs.uk.

BACKGROUND: As one of the 4 United Kingdom national centres for Lysosomal 
Storage Disorders, Birmingham Children's Hospital (BCH) cares for 49 patients 
with a mucopolysaccharide (MPS) disorder. Presently, their oral health needs 
have never been fully investigated. Enzyme therapies are revolutionising medical 
treatment, and will prolong life expectancy. Therefore, oral health and its 
impact on quality of life are increasingly important.
HYPOTHESIS: Patients with an MPS disorder have greater oral health needs in 
comparison with the general population.
DESIGN: Forty-six patients with an MPS disorder were investigated for caries, 
gingival health and enamel opacities. Questionnaires to establish the 
utilisation of dental services and assess the perceived difficulties in 
achieving adequate oral health care were completed.
RESULTS: Patients with an MPS disorder have specific oral health needs depending 
on the type of MPS experienced. This study found 76% of patients with MPS IV had 
experienced dental caries and they all showed evidence of a generalised 
unspecified enamel defect. Subjects with MPS I, II and III did not have an 
increased caries rate; 50% of the study group had received dental treatment in 
the past, of which 74% (17, n = 23) required a general anaesthetic.
CONCLUSION: The MPS disorders can have a significant effect on the developing 
dentition. Subjects with MPS IV do have an increased oral health need in 
comparison with the general population and the other MPS groups due to their 
increased caries rate and enamel defects. Further research is required to fully 
assess their needs and investigate any structural tooth defects.

issue of Genes & Development, O'Rourke and colleagues (pp. 429-440) uncovered a 
role for lipase-generated ω-6 fatty acids in promoting autophagy and, 
consequently, life span extension under both fed and fasting conditions. The 
impact of this finding is discussed with regard to the nutritional value of ω-6 
fatty acids and regulatory functions of fat metabolism beyond its well-known 
role in energy storage.

Phytonutrients reportedly extend the life span of Caenorhabditis elegans, 
Drosophila, and mice. We tested extracts of blueberry, pomegranate, green and 
black tea, cinnamon, sesame, and French maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol and 
taxifolin), as well as curcumin, morin, and quercetin for their effects on the 
life span of mice. While many of these phytonutrients reportedly extend the life 
span of model organisms, we found no significant effect on the life span of male 
F1 hybrid mice, even though the dosages used reportedly produce defined 
therapeutic end points in mice. The compounds were fed beginning at 12 months of 
age. The control and treatment groups were iso-caloric with respect to one 
another. A 40% calorically restricted and other groups not reported here did 
experience life span extension. Body weights were un-changed relative to 
controls for all but two supplemented groups, indicating most supplements did 
not change energy absorption or utilization. Tea extracts with morin decreased 
weight, whereas quercetin, taxifolin, and Pycnogenol together increased weight. 
These changes may be due to altered locomotion or fatty acid biosynthesis. 
Published reports of murine life span extension using curcumin or tea components 
may have resulted from induced caloric restriction. Together, our results do not 
support the idea that isolated phytonutrient anti-oxidants and 
anti-inflammatories are potential longevity therapeutics, even though 
consumption of whole fruits and vegetables is associated with enhanced health 
span and life span.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in a referral center in Iran: are patients 
developing the disease at a younger age?

Houston, Houston, TX, USA. neda.hashemisadraei@uth.tmc.edu

 
BACKGROUND: The incidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) appears to be 
increasing.  In the western literature, the average age of presentation is in 
the seventh decade of life while it has been reported to be earlier in the 
Middle East and India.  Given that a paucity of epidemiological data exists in 
Iran, we sought to describe the clinical pattern and course of the disease at a 
large Iranian referral center.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of 132 patients diagnosed with IPF 
at the National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD) in 
Tehran, Iran from 1988 through 2008. Data were collected from the medical 
records which consisted of demographics, clinical history, laboratory tests, 
pulmonary function tests (PFT), radiographic and pathology findings, treatment, 
and outcomes of the disease.  
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 56.6 years (95% CI: 53.8 - 59.4) with no 
significant sex predilection. Common presenting symptoms included dyspnea and 
cough, which occurred for a mean period of 21 months prior to diagnosis. Common 
signs included end-inspiratory crackles and digital clubbing, which were found 
in 85.6% and 55.3% of the patients, respectively. Radiographically, reticular 
and reticulonodular opacities were seen in 47.3% and 20.9% of the patients, 
respectively on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). In patients who 
underwent lung biopsy, diffuse interstitial fibrosis was seen in 91.1%. The mean 
follow-up time for all patients was 32.8 months (95% CI: 23.2 - 42.4, range: 1 - 
257 months).  There were 16 patients who died during the study period. The mean 
age of death was 56.8 years (95% CI: 46.2 - 67.4), which is significantly lower 
than the life expectancy in Iran (P-value: 0.017). The mean survival time for 
patients who died was 1.1 years (95% CI: 0.5 - 1.7) after diagnosis.  The one- 
and three- year overall survival rates for all patients were 88% and 79%, 
respectively. 
CONCLUSION: The clinical characteristics of IPF in Iran are similar to those in 
the western literature.  However, Iranian patients appear to be developing the 
disease a decade earlier than western patients.

Life expectancy of artists in the Low Countries from the fifteenth to the 
twentieth century.

We investigated the role that urbanization and plague may have played in changes 
in life expectancy amongst artists in the Low Countries who were born between 
1450 and 1909. Artists can be considered to be representative of a middle-class 
population living mostly in urban areas. The dataset was constructed using 
biographical information collected by the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische 
Documentatie in The Hague, the Netherlands. As early as the beginning of the 
sixteenth century, life expectancy at age 20 amongst the artists had reached 40 
years. After a substantial decline in the late sixteenth and the early 
seventeenth centuries, when plague hit the region, life expectancy at age 20 
began to rise again, and this upward trend accelerated after 1850. The life 
expectancy of female artists commonly exceeded that of males, and sculptors had 
better survival prospects than painters. In comparison with elite groups in the 
Low Countries and elsewhere in Europe, life expectancy amongst the artists was 
rather high.

Imaging epigenetics in Alzheimer's disease.

Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent, complex and chronically 
progressive brain disease. Its course is non-linear, dynamic, adaptive to 
maladaptive, and compensatory to decompensatory, affecting large-scale neural 
networks through a plethora of mechanistic and signaling pathway alterations 
that converge into regional and cell type-specific neurodegeneration and, 
finally, into clinically overt cognitive and behavioral decline. This decline 
includes reductions in the activities of daily living, quality of life, 
independence, and life expectancy. Evolving lines of research suggest that 
epigenetic mechanisms may play a crucial role during AD development and 
progression. Epigenetics designates molecular mechanisms that alter gene 
expression without modifications of the genetic code. This topic includes 
modifications on DNA and histone proteins, the primary elements of chromatin 
structure. Accumulating evidence has revealed the relevant processes that 
mediate epigenetic modifications and has begun to elucidate how these processes 
are apparently dysregulated in AD. This evidence has led to the clarification of 
the roles of specific classes of therapeutic compounds that affect epigenetic 
pathways and characteristics of the epigenome. This insight is accompanied by 
the development of new methods for studying the global patterns of DNA 
methylation and chromatin alterations. In particular, high-throughput sequencing 
approaches, such as next-generation DNA sequencing techniques, are beginning to 
drive the field into the next stage of development. In parallel, genetic imaging 
is beginning to answer additional questions through its ability to uncover 
genetic variants, with or without genome-wide significance, that are related to 
brain structure, function and metabolism, which impact disease risk and 
fundamental network-based cognitive processes. Neuroimaging measures can further 
be used to define AD systems and endophenotypes. The integration of genetic 
neuroimaging methods with epigenetic markers in humans appears promising. This 
evolving development may lead to a new research discipline - imaging epigenetics 
- that will provide deeper insight into the causative pathogenetic and 
pathophysiological pathways through which genes and environment interrelate 
during life and impact human brain development, physiology, aging and disease. 
This knowledge may open doors for the development of novel biomarkers and 
preventive and disease-modifying treatments.

Incremental cost-effectiveness of guideline-directed medical therapies for heart 
failure.

Author information:
(1)Ahmanson-UCLA Cardiomyopathy Center, Ronald Reagan-UCLA Medical Center, Los 
Angeles, CA 90095, USA.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to quantify the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICER) of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), beta-blocker 
(BB), and aldosterone antagonist (AldA) therapies for patients with heart 
failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
BACKGROUND: There are evidence-based, guideline-directed medical therapies for 
patients with HFrEF, but the incremental cost-effectiveness of these therapies 
has not been well studied using contemporary data.
METHODS: A Markov model with lifetime horizon and two states, dead or alive, was 
created. We compared HFrEF patients treated with diuretic agents alone to three 
treatment arms: 1) ACEI therapy alone; 2) ACEI+BB; and 3) ACEI+BB+AldA. 
Sequential therapy was also analyzed. HF hospitalizations and mortality rates 
were based on representative studies. Costs of medications and inpatient and 
outpatient care were accounted for.
RESULTS: Treatment with ACEI and ACEI+BB strictly dominated treatment with 
diuretics only (cost-saving). The greatest gains in quality-adjusted life-years 
occurred when all 3 guideline-directed medications were provided. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ACEI+BB+AldA versus ACEI+BB and 
ACEI+BB versus ACEI was <$1,500 per quality-adjusted life-year. The cost-savings 
in the ACEI and ACEI+BB cohorts compared to that with diuretics alone were $444 
and $33, respectively. Assuming lower treatment costs and lower hospitalization 
rates in the ACEI+BB+AldA arm resulted in greater cost-savings. Even in the most 
unfavorable situations, the ICER was <$10,000 per life-year gained.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrates that medical treatment of HFrEF is highly 
cost-effective and may even result in cost-savings. Greater efforts to ensure 
optimal adherence to guideline-directed medical therapy for HFrEF are warranted.

OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to measure the burden of disease from 
premature death and disability for chronic diseases in Korea in 2007.
STUDY DESIGN: Chronic diseases were defined using the WHO definitions. 
Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were used to analyse insurance claim data.
METHODS: This was a population-based study and included the total population of 
Korea. DALYs were used to analyse insurance claim data. Years of life lost (YLL) 
and years lost to disability (YLD) were measured in terms of incidence rate and 
number of deaths. DALYs were aggregated to YLL and YLD. To ensure code validity, 
only patients who had visited a tertiary hospital or a clinic three or more 
times for the same disease were included.
RESULTS: Cerebrovascular disease was the leading contributor to the chronic 
disease burden, with a value of 907.4, followed by diabetes mellitus (899), 
ischaemic heart disease (710), cirrhosis of the liver (616.5), chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (512.9), asthma (503.1), hypertensive heart 
disease (407.5), stomach cancer (356) and peptic ulcer disease (292.5). As these 
results demonstrate, the highest ranked diseases were cardio-cerebrovascular or 
related diseases, as well as the fact that hypertension, diabetes mellitus and 
related complications, which are associated diseases, have became increasingly 
severe problems. And the rural areas have a higher burden of disease than 
metropolitan cities. According to difference in social status, Medicaid 2 group 
has more burden of disease than other groups.
CONCLUSIONS: It has been possible to present evidence regarding the burden of 
diseases and the relatively high risk of cardio-cerebrovascular disease. If the 
various types of cancer were combined and then the calculating tool applied, the 
burden would likely be greater than that of cardio-cerebrovascular disease. 
However, based on DALY, ischaemic heart disease demonstrated a remarkable 
increase compared to the rate in the previous study based on 2002 data. 
Underprivileged people in particular have been struggling - with chronic 
diseases.

Sustaining innovation and improvement in the treatment of childhood cancer: 
lessons from high-income countries.

Cancer in children and adolescents is rare and biologically very different from 
cancer in adults. It accounts for 1·4% of all cancers worldwide, although this 
proportion ranges from 0·5% in Europe to 4·8% in Africa, largely because of 
differences in age composition and life expectancy. In high-income countries, 
survival from childhood cancer has reached 80% through a continuous focus on the 
integration of clinical research into front-line care for nearly all children 
affected by malignant disease. However, further improvement must entail new 
biology-driven approaches, since optimisation of conventional treatments has in 
many cases reached its limits. In many instances, such approaches can only be 
achieved through international collaborative research, since rare cancers are 
being subdivided into increasingly smaller subgroups on the basis of their 
molecular characteristics. The long-term effect of anticancer treatment on 
quality of life must also be taken into account because more than one in 1000 
adults in high-income countries are thought to be survivors of cancer in 
childhood or adolescence. The introduction of drugs that are less toxic and more 
targeted than those currently used necessitates a partnership between clinical 
and translational researchers, the pharmaceutical industry, drug regulators, and 
patients and their families. This therapeutic alliance will ensure that efforts 
are focused on the unmet clinical needs of young people with cancer. Most 
children with cancer live in low-income and middle-income countries, and these 
countries account for 94% of all deaths from cancer in people aged 0-14 years. 
The immediate priority for these children is to improve access to an affordable, 
best standard of care in each country. Every country should have a national 
cancer plan that recognises the unique demographic characteristics and care 
needs of young people with cancer. Centralisation of the complex components of 
treatment of these rare diseases is essential to improve survival, accelerate 
research, and train the future specialist workforce. Referral routes and care 
pathways must take account of the large geographical distances between many 
patients' homes and treatment centres, and the economic, cultural, and 
linguistic diversity of the populations served.

Herd immunity effect of the HPV vaccination program in Australia under different 
assumptions regarding natural immunity against re-infection.

Deterministic dynamic compartmental transmission models (DDCTMs) of human 
papillomavirus (HPV) transmission have been used in a number of studies to 
estimate the potential impact of HPV vaccination programs. In most cases, the 
models were built under the assumption that an individual who cleared HPV 
infection develops (life-long) natural immunity against re-infection with the 
same HPV type (this is known as SIR scenario). This assumption was also made by 
two Australian modelling studies evaluating the impact of the National HPV 
Vaccination Program to assist in the health-economic assessment of male 
vaccination. An alternative view denying natural immunity after clearance (SIS 
scenario) was only presented in one study, although neither scenario has been 
supported by strong evidence. Some recent findings, however, provide arguments 
in favour of SIS. We developed HPV transmission models implementing life-time 
(SIR), limited, and non-existent (SIS) natural immunity. For each model we 
estimated the herd immunity effect of the ongoing Australian HPV vaccination 
program and its extension to cover males. Given the Australian setting, we aimed 
to clarify the extent to which the choice of model structure would influence 
estimation of this effect. A statistically robust and efficient calibration 
methodology was applied to ensure credibility of our results. We observed that 
for non-SIR models the herd immunity effect measured in relative reductions in 
HPV prevalence in the unvaccinated population was much more pronounced than for 
the SIR model. For example, with vaccine efficacy of 95% for females and 90% for 
males, the reductions for HPV-16 were 3% in females and 28% in males for the SIR 
model, and at least 30% (females) and 60% (males) for non-SIR models. The 
magnitude of these differences implies that evaluations of the impact of 
vaccination programs using DDCTMs should incorporate several model structures 
until our understanding of natural immunity is improved.

The key role of growth hormone-insulin-IGF-1 signaling in aging and cancer.

Institute of Oncology, St. Petersburg, Russia. aging@mail.ru

Studies in mammals have led to the suggestion that hyperglycemia and 
hyperinsulinemia are important factors in aging. GH/Insulin/insulin-like growth 
factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling molecules that have been linked to longevity include 
daf-2 and InR and their homologues in mammals, and inactivation of the 
corresponding genes increases lifespan in nematodes, fruit flies and mice. The 
life-prolonging effects of caloric restriction are likely related to decreasing 
IGF-1 levels. Evidence has emerged that antidiabetic drugs are promising 
candidates for both lifespan extension and prevention of cancer. Thus, 
antidiabetic drugs postpone spontaneous carcinogenesis in mice and rats, as well 
as chemical and radiation carcinogenesis in mice, rats and hamsters. 
Furthermore, metformin seems to decrease the risk for cancer in diabetic 
patients.

Diagnosis and treatment of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1).

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1; formerly known as Wermer syndrome) is 
a rare disorder characterized by the combined occurrence of two or more tumors 
involving parathyroid, pancreatic islets and anterior pituitary glands; some 
other tumors have also been described. In most cases it is inherited in an 
autosomic dominant manner but it may occur sporadically. The MEN1 gene (MEN1) is 
located on chromosome 11q13, it is composed of ten exons that encode a 610 amino 
acid protein called menin. Menin, with no homology to any other known protein, 
interacts with several different proteins and plays an important role in 
regulation of cell growth, cell cycle, genome stability and synapse plasticity. 
Familiar MEN1 has a high degree of penetrance with clinical or biochemical 
manifestations of the disease in 80% and 98%, respectively, by the fifth decade. 
Clinical manifestations are related to tumor localizations and their secretory 
products. Hyperparathyroidism is the most common feature of MEN1 (95% of 
patients), pancreatic islet tumors or pancreatic NET (neuroendocrine tumor) 
occur in 40-70% and pituitary tumors in 30-40% of MEN 1 patients. In addition, 
other tumors, such as adrenal cortical tumors, carcinoid tumors, lipomas, 
angiofibromas, colagenomas and meningiomas may be present. Occurrence of de novo 
mutations appear in 10% of all patients with MEN1. A correlation between 
genotype and phenotype has not been found and, even more, combinations of these 
tumors may be different in members of the same family. Untreated patients have a 
decreased life expectancy, with a 50% probability of death by the age of 50 
years and the cause of death is mostly directly related to MEN1, being the most 
important causes malignant pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and thymic 
carcinoids. Treatment for each type of endocrine tumor is generally similar as 
in non-MEN1 associated tumors, but results are less successful according to 
multiplicity of tumors, higher metastatic disease, larger and more aggressive 
tumors and more resistant to treatment. The prognosis might improve by 
preclinical tumor diagnosis and appropriated treatment.
