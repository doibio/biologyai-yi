transplant. The strategy was also cost-effective with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $56 018 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) from 
the payer perspective, and $4647 per QALY from the societal perspective, 
compared to remaining on the waitlist for 1 additional year. The results were 
consistent in 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We conclude that the 
use of kidneys from deceased donors with HCV infection is likely to lead to 
improved clinical outcomes at reduced cost for HCV-negative transplant 
candidates.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical methods of resection of elbow tumor and total 
elbow replacement with custom personalized prosthesis based on three dimensional 
(3-D) printing navigation template.
METHODS: In August 2016, a 63-year-old male patient with left elbow joint tumor 
was treated, with the discovery of the left distal humerus huge mass over 3 
months, with elbow pain, activity limitation of admission. Computer-assisted 
reduction technique combined with 3-D printing was used to simulate preoperative 
tumor resection, a customized personal prosthesis was developed; tumor was 
accurately excised during operation, and the clinical result was evaluated after 
operation.
RESULTS: The time was 46 minutes for tumor resection, and was 95 minutes for 
personalized implant and allograft bone without fluoroscopy. X-ray and CT 
examination at 1 week after operation showed good position of artificial elbow 
joint; the anteversion of ulna prosthesis was 30° and the elbow carrying angle 
was 15°, which were consistent with the simulated results before surgery. The 
finger flexion was normal at 1 month after operation; the range of motion was 
0-130° for elbow flexion and extension, 80° for forearm pronation, and 80° for 
forearm supination. The elbow function was able to meet the needs of daily life 
at 7 months after operation, and no recurrence and metastasis of tumor were 
observed.
CONCLUSION: For limb salvage of elbow joint, computer aided design can make 
preoperative surgical simulation; the navigation template can improve surgical 
precision; and the function of elbow joint can be reconstructed with customized 
and personlized prosthesis for total elbow replacement.

OBJECTIVES: This analysis uses the data from the randomized controlled trial to 
assess the cost effectiveness of catheter ablation (n = 132) versus escalated 
antiarrhythmic therapy (n = 127).
BACKGROUND: For survivors of myocardial infarction with implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator shocks despite antiarrhythmic drugs, the VANISH 
(Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation Versus Escalated Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy 
in Ischemic Heart Disease) trial demonstrated improved clinical outcomes with 
catheter ablation compared with more aggressive antiarrhythmic pharmacotherapy.
METHODS: Health care resource use and quality-of-life data were used to 
determine the cost effectiveness of catheter ablation. Published references were 
used to estimate costs (in 2015 Canadian dollars). The analysis was over 3 
years, with a 5% discount rate. Adjustment was made for censoring and baseline 
utilities.
RESULTS: Ablation resulted in greater quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) than 
escalated drug therapy did (1.63 vs. 1.49; difference: 0.14; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: -0.20 to 0.46) and higher cost ($65,126 vs. $60,269; difference: 
$4,857; 95% CI: -$19,757 to $27,106); with an incremental cost per QALY gained 
for ablation versus escalated drug therapy of $34,057 primarily due to the 
initial costs of ablation, which were partially offset by the costs of 
subsequent ablations and adverse outcomes in the escalated drug therapy arm. For 
patients with amiodarone-refractory ventricular tachycardia, ablation dominated 
escalated drug therapy, with greater QALYs (1.48 vs. 1.26; difference: 0.22; 95% 
CI: -0.19 to 0.59) and lower costs ($67,614 vs. $68,383; difference: -$769; 95% 
CI: -$35,330 to $27,092). For those with sotalol-refractory ventricular 
tachycardia, ablation resulted in similar QALYs (1.90 vs. 1.90; difference: 
-0.00; 95% CI: -0.59 to 0.62) and higher costs ($60,455 vs. $45,033; difference: 
$15,422; 95% CI: -$10,968 to $48,555).
CONCLUSIONS: For the total trial population, results are suggestive that 
ablation is cost effective compared with escalation of drug therapy. This result 
was only manifest for the subgroup of patients whose qualifying arrhythmia 
occurred despite amiodarone.

and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo

The life expectancy provides valuable information about population health. The 
life expectancies were evaluated in 12,039 dogs which were buried or cremated 
during January 2012 to March 2015. The data of dogs were collected at the eight 
animal cemeteries in Tokyo. The overall life expectancy of dogs was 13.7 (95% 
confidence interval (CI): 13.7-13.8) years. The probability of death was high in 
the first year of life, lowest in the fourth year, and increased exponentially 
after four years of age like Gompertz curve in semilog graph. The life 
expectancy of companion dogs in Tokyo has increased 1.67 fold from 8.6 years to 
13.7 years over the past three decades. Canine crossbreed life expectancy (15.1 
years, 95% CI 14.9-15.3) was significantly greater than pure breed life 
expectancy (13.6 years, 95%CI 13.5-13.7, P-value <0.001). The life expectancy 
for male and for female dogs were 13.6 (95% CI: 13.5-13.7) and 13.5 (95% CI: 
13.4-13.6) years, respectively, with no significant difference (P=0.097). In 
terms of the median age of death and life expectancy for major breeds, Shiba had 
the highest median age of death (15.7 years), life expectancy (15.5 years) and 
French Bulldog had the lowest median age of death (10.2 years), life expectancy 
(10.2 years). When considering life expectancy alone, these results suggest that 
the health of companion dogs in Japan has significantly improved over the past 
30 years.

Sponsorship Bias in Base-Case Values and Uncertainty Bounds of Health Economic 
Evaluations? A Systematic Review of Herpes Zoster Vaccination.

Antwerp, Wilrijk, Antwerp, Belgium.

Wales, Sydney, Australia.

BACKGROUND: New health technologies are more likely adopted when they have lower 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and/or when their ICER is 
presented with more certainty. Industry-funded (IF) health economic evaluations 
use often more favorable base-case values, leading to more favorable 
conclusions.
PURPOSE: To study whether IF health economic evaluations of varicella-zoster 
virus vaccination in the elderly use more favorable base-case values and account 
for less uncertainty than non-industry-funded (NIF) evaluations.
DATA SOURCE: PubMed. Data extracted: funding source; incremental cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained; vaccine price; study quality score; 
base-case values, uncertainty ranges, and data sources for influential 
parameters: duration of vaccine protection, utility loss due to herpes zoster 
(HZ) disease, percentage of HZ patients developing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), 
and duration of PHN.
DATA SYNTHESIS: qualitative comparisons; Fisher exact test for differences in 
study quality score and 1-sided Mann-Whitney U tests for differences in 
base-case values and uncertainty ranges.
RESULTS: Despite using the same data sources, IF studies ( n = 10) assume a 
longer duration of vaccine protection ( U = 56, P = 0.03), have a higher 
percentage of HZ patients developing PHN ( U = 22/33, P = 0.02/0.03 for ages 
60-64/65-69), and tend to use higher HZ utility loss than NIF studies ( n = 11) 
for their baseline. IF studies show lower ICERs given similar or even higher 
vaccine prices than NIF studies, consider less uncertainty around the duration 
of vaccine protection ( U = 8, P < 0.001), and tend to use less uncertainty 
around the duration of PHN. Yet their quality has been rated equally well, using 
current standard quality rating tools.
CONCLUSION: Researchers and decision makers should be aware of potential 
sponsorship bias in health economic evaluations, especially in the way source 
data are used to specify base-case values and uncertainty ranges.

INTRODUCTION: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell neoplasm with substantial 
morbidity and mortality. A comprehensive description of the global burden of MM 
is needed to help direct health policy, resource allocation, research, and 
patient care.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the burden of MM and the availability of effective 
therapies for 21 world regions and 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 
2016.
DESIGN AND SETTING: We report incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted 
life-year (DALY) estimates from the Global Burden of Disease 2016 study. Data 
sources include vital registration system, cancer registry, drug availability, 
and survey data for stem cell transplant rates. We analyzed the contribution of 
aging, population growth, and changes in incidence rates to the overall change 
in incident cases from 1990 to 2016 globally, by sociodemographic index (SDI) 
and by region. We collected data on approval of lenalidomide and bortezomib 
worldwide.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Multiple myeloma mortality; incidence; years lived 
with disabilities; years of life lost; and DALYs by age, sex, country, and year.
RESULTS: Worldwide in 2016 there were 138 509 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 
121 000-155 480) incident cases of MM with an age-standardized incidence rate 
(ASIR) of 2.1 per 100 000 persons (95% UI, 1.8-2.3). Incident cases from 1990 to 
2016 increased by 126% globally and by 106% to 192% for all SDI quintiles. The 3 
world regions with the highest ASIR of MM were Australasia, North America, and 
Western Europe. Multiple myeloma caused 2.1 million (95% UI, 1.9-2.3 million) 
DALYs globally in 2016. Stem cell transplantation is routinely available in 
higher-income countries but is lacking in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of the 
Middle East. In 2016, lenalidomide and bortezomib had been approved in 73 and 
103 countries, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Incidence of MM is highly variable among countries 
but has increased uniformly since 1990, with the largest increase in middle and 
low-middle SDI countries. Access to effective care is very limited in many 
countries of low socioeconomic development, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Global health policy priorities for MM are to improve diagnostic and treatment 
capacity in low and middle income countries and to ensure affordability of 
effective medications for every patient. Research priorities are to elucidate 
underlying etiological factors explaining the heterogeneity in myeloma 
incidence.

The use of a disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) metric to measure human health 
damage resulting from pesticide maximum legal exposures.

Most agencies around the world have developed a separate regulation frameworks 
for pesticides with different modes of action, likely because of the lack of a 
uniform quantification for health damage, which may underestimate pesticides' 
impact on human health and disease burden. In this study, the 
disability-adjusted life-year, a uniform metric used to express the human health 
impact and damage, was used to measure theoretical health damage resulting from 
maximum exposure as permitted by law to the most widely used pesticides. The 
total human risk characterization factors computed from chlorpyrifos and 
diazinon standard values through main exposure routes are generally larger than 
that of other widely used pesticides, and most factors of chlorpyrifos exceed 
the upper bounds of health risk. In addition, the damages to human health 
quantified from soil legal exposure to these widely used pesticides are much 
lower than that from exposure to drinking water or foods, which could help 
derive exposure allocation factors for different exposure routes. A total of 412 
(28.3% of the total) computed total risk characterization factors of the 13 
pesticides exceed the upper bound of tolerable risk uncertainty. Some nations, 
such as those in Europe, have adopted uniform and strict pesticide standard 
values as well as some computed risk characterization factors presented in the 
consensus data cluster. In addition, the results of an analysis on the 
geographical distribution of health risk characterization factors indicated that 
European nations have provided more conservative pesticide standard values in 
general. It is hoped that regulatory agencies can apply this uniform metric to 
compare and formulate legal limits for pesticides that have different modes of 
action.

Cost-effectiveness of Electroconvulsive Therapy vs Pharmacotherapy/Psychotherapy 
for Treatment-Resistant Depression in the United States.

Arbor.

IMPORTANCE: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for 
depression but is infrequently used owing to stigma, uncertainty about 
indications, adverse effects, and perceived high cost.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of ECT compared with 
pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder 
in the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A decision analytic model integrating data on 
clinical efficacy, costs, and quality-of-life effects of ECT compared with 
pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy was used to simulate depression treatment during a 
4-year horizon from a US health care sector perspective. Model input data were 
drawn from multiple meta-analyses, randomized trials, and observational studies 
of patients with depression. Where possible, data sources were restricted to 
US-based studies of nonpsychotic major depression. Data were analyzed between 
June 2017 and January 2018.
INTERVENTIONS: Six alternative strategies for incorporating ECT into depression 
treatment (after failure of 0-5 lines of pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy) compared 
with no ECT.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Remission, response, and nonresponse of depression; 
quality-adjusted life-years; costs in 2013 US dollars; and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios. Strategies with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year or less were designated 
cost-effective.
RESULTS: Based on the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression 
trial, we simulated a population with a mean (SD) age of 40.7 (13.2) years, and 
62.2% women. Over 4 years, ECT was projected to reduce time with uncontrolled 
depression from 50% of life-years to 33% to 37% of life-years, with greater 
improvements when ECT is offered earlier. Mean health care costs were increased 
by $7300 to $12 000, with greater incremental costs when ECT was offered 
earlier. In the base case, third-line ECT was cost-effective, with an ICER of 
$54 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Third-line ECT remained cost-effective 
in a range of univariate, scenario, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. 
Incorporating all input data uncertainty, we estimate a 74% to 78% likelihood 
that at least 1 of the ECT strategies is cost-effective and a 56% to 58% 
likelihood that third-line ECT is the optimal strategy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For US patients with treatment-resistant depression, 
ECT may be an effective and cost-effective treatment option. Although many 
factors influence the decision to proceed with ECT, these data suggest that, 
from a health-economic standpoint, ECT should be considered after failure of 2 
or more lines of pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is the most crucial nutritionally demanding period of 
every woman's life. The high demand of nutrients to deposit energy in the form 
of new tissue, growth of existing maternal tissues such as breast and uterus and 
increased energy requirements for tissue synthesis makes pregnant women more 
vulnerable to malnutrition. Dietary practice is defined as an observable actions 
or behavior of dietary habit and can be classified as good dietary practices and 
poor dietary practices. The incidence of dietary inadequacies as a result of 
dietary habits and patterns in pregnancy is higher during pregnancy when 
compared to any other stage of the life cycle. Thus, this study aimed to assess 
dietary practices and associated factors during pregnancy in Bahir Dar town, 
Northwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: A community based cross sectional study was conducted from March 1 to 
April 1, 2016. A total of 616 pregnant women were participated in the study. All 
eligible pregnant women were identified through house-to-house visit with the 
help of health extension workers. Cluster sampling was used to select eligible 
pregnant women. The data were collected using interviewer administered 
questionnaire prepared in English and translated in to Amharic. Data were 
analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors 
associated with dietary practices.
RESULT: This study has shown that 39.3% of the study participants had good 
dietary practices and the rest 60.7% of pregnant women reported poor dietary 
practices. Concerning dietary knowledge, 61.4% of the study participants had 
good dietary knowledge while 38.6% had poor dietary knowledge. Husband income, 
ownership of radio, history of disease and dietary knowledge were shown to have 
significant association (P < 0.05) with dietary practices.
CONCLUSION: Dietary practices of pregnant women in the study area was 
suboptimal. Husband income, ownership of radio, history of disease and dietary 
knowledge were independent predictors of women dietary practices. Awareness 
should be created among pregnant women by concerned bodies such as governmental 
and non-governmental organization through local mass media.

This study examines the cost-effectiveness of constructing a dedicated pediatric 
operating room (OR) in Uganda, a country where access to surgical care is 
limited to 4 pediatric surgeons serving a population of over 20 million children 
under 15 years of age.
METHODS: A simulation model using a decision tree template was developed to 
project the cost and disability-adjusted life-years saved by a pediatric OR in a 
low-income setting. Parameters are informed by patient outcomes of the surgical 
procedures performed. Costs of the OR equipment and a literature review were 
used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a pediatric OR. 
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to assess 
parameter uncertainty. Economic monetary benefit was calculated using the value 
of a statistical life approach.
RESULTS: A pediatric OR averted a total of 6,447 disability-adjusted life-years 
/year (95% uncertainty interval 6,288-6,606) and cost $41,182/year (UI 
40,539-41,825) in terms of OR installation. The pediatric operating room had an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6.39 per disability-adjusted life-year 
averted (95% uncertainty interval of 6.19-6.59), or $397.95 (95% uncertainty 
interval of 385.41-410.67) per life saved based on the country's average life 
expectancy in 2015. These values were well within the WHO guidelines of 
cost-effectiveness threshold. The net economic benefit amounted to $5,336,920 
for a year of operation, or $16,371 per patient. The model remained robust with 
one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: The construction of a pediatric operating room in Uganda is a 
cost-effective and worthwhile investment, endorsing future decisions to enhance 
pediatric surgical capacity in the resource-limited settings of Sub-Saharan 
Africa.

BACKROUND: Accurate life expectancy estimation is crucial in clinical 
decision-making including management and treatment of clinically localized 
prostate cancer (PCa).
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that Social Security Administration (SSA) life 
tables' derived survival estimates closely follow observed survival of PCa 
patients. To test this relationship, we examined 10-yr overall survival rates in 
patients with clinically localized PCa and compared it with survival estimates 
derived from the SSA life tables.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
database (2004), we identified patients aged >50-<90yr. Follow-up was at least 
10 yr for patients who did not die of disease or other causes.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Monte Carlo method was used to 
define individual survival in years, according to the SSA life tables 
(2004-2014). Subsequently, SSA life tables' predicted survival was compared with 
observed survival rates in Kaplan-Meier analyses. Subgroup analyses were 
stratified according to treatment type and D'Amico risk classification.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 39191 patients with localized PCa were 
identified. At 10-yr follow-up, the SSA life tables' predicted survival was 
69.5% versus 73.1% according to the observed rate (p<0.0001). The largest 
differences between estimated versus observed survival rates were recorded for 
D'Amico low-risk PCa (8.0%), brachytherapy (9.1%), and radical prostatectomy 
(8.6%) patients. Conversely, the smallest differences were recorded for external 
beam radiotherapy (1.7%) and unknown treatment type (1.6%) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, SSA life tables' predicted life expectancy closely 
approximate observed overall survival rates. However, SSA life tables' predicted 
rates underestimate by as much as 9.1% the survival in brachytherapy patients, 
as well as in D'Amico low-risk and radical prostatectomy patients. In these 
patient categories, an adjustment for the degree of underestimation might be 
required when counseling is provided in clinical practice.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Social Security Administration (SSA) life tables' predicted 
life expectancy closely approximate observed overall survival rates. However, 
SSA life tables' predicted rates underestimate by as much as 9.1% the survival 
in brachytherapy patients, as well as in D'Amico low-risk and radical 
prostatectomy patients.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the cost-effectiveness of lipegfilgrastim versus 
pegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis in women with early stage breast cancer.
METHODS: Two Markov models including a chemotherapy and a post-chemotherapy 
models were constructed with a time horizon of 12 weeks and 30 years, 
respectively. All the transition probabilities and utility weights were derived 
from clinical trials and/or published literatures. The costs populated in the 
chemotherapy model were extracted from Medicare, Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme 
and the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. No cost was considered in the 
post-chemotherapy model. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the 
robustness of the results.
RESULTS: From the first chemotherapy model, lipegfilgrastim was associated with 
fewer episodes of severe neutropenia (SN) (N = 142 per 1000 patients treated), 
febrile neutropenia (FN) (N = 29 per 1000 patients treated), infection (N = 17 
per 1000 patients treated) and chemotherapy delayed (N = 170 per 1000 patients 
treated) and lower cost ($116.88 less per patient treated). The 
post-chemotherapy model indicated lipegfilgrastim led to higher gains in both 
life years (18.72 versus 18.61) and quality-adjusted life years (17.28 versus 
17.18) in comparison to pegfilgrastim. Sensitivity analysis showed that the 
results from the chemotherapy model is very sensitive to the baseline risk of 
SN; while from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, lipegfilgrastim was 
likely to be more cost-effective than pegfilgrastim based on two models.
CONCLUSIONS: Lipegfilgrastim was likely to be a cost-effective alternative to 
pegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis. The sensitivity analysis showed the 
confidence interval for the cost and benefit outcomes overlapped to a great 
extent, suggesting an insignificant difference.

There is a rapidly growing reinvigoration of the investigation of small 
proteins, cyclic peptides, and mAb derived domains as biotherapies. The 
drugability of these structures are challenged by fast peripheral clearance 
properties that can reduce their potential to be realized as medicines. 
Engineering strategies have been of limited value because mechanistically the 
half-life benefit is manifested by increasing the molecular weight and/or the 
hydrodyanimc radius which slows the molecule's renal elimination, but can result 
in the inherent loss of activity and target accessibility. The present work 
evaluated an alternative approach using smaller peptide sequences which bind to 
the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Results revealed, small linear and cyclic FcRn 
binding peptides (FcRnBPs) fused to a combination of the N- and C-termini of a 
Fab can significantly improve the pharmacokinetics of the protein in cynomolgus 
monkeys relative to the parental Fab. The linear and cyclic conformations, as 
well as, the number of FcRnBPs fused to the Fab both influence the clearance and 
the extent of pharmacokinetic benefit. FcRnBP fusion protein kinetics were also 
affected by a combination of post-translation modifications and non-specific 
binding properties. The results in this report lay some foundation in fostering 
the advent of newer technologies toward successfully improving the 
pharmacokinetics of proteins, peptides, and mAb-derived domains. Additional work 
in the integration of a variety of factors including the intended site of 
action, tissue disposition, metabolism, toxicity and pharmacokinetic, and 
pharmacodynamics relationship of the intended therapeutic modality are key areas 
for advancement of these approaches.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral abscesses are rare, potentially life-threatening entities 
that result from local spread or hematogenous dissemination to the brain. Prompt 
diagnosis and initiation of treatment is key in lowering morbidity and 
preventing mortality associated with cerebral abscesses. Congenital heart 
diseases with right-to-left intracardiac shunts can be complicated by brain 
abscesses via paradoxical embolism of infected microthrombi. Hypoplastic left 
heart syndrome (HLHS) is a rare congenital heart disease characterized by an 
underdeveloped left heart that uses intracardiac shunting to achieve adequate 
systemic circulation. We present the first reported case of a cerebral abscess 
in a patient with HLHS. The pathophysiology of HLHS and how it predisposes 
patients to development of cerebral abscesses is discussed.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 25-year-old male was transferred to our institution 
complaining of headache, nausea, and vomiting. The patient was not an 
intravenous (IV) drug user, and serologic testing was negative for human 
immunodeficiency virus. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 2.6-cm left 
occipital abscess, which was surgically resected without complication, and the 
patient was treated with IV antibiotics.
CONCLUSION: HLHS is a rare congenital cardiac malformation. The long-term 
outcome of patients with this condition continues to improve as treatment 
paradigms evolve. As such, patients with HLHS are living longer, and their 
potential to develop cerebral abscesses secondary to their unique systemic 
circulation is increasing with improved life expectancy. Surgeons and physicians 
should maintain a high index of suspicion for cerebral abscess in the setting of 
HLHS.

BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-conditional pacemakers (M-PPMs) 
grant patients greater accessibility to MRI scans. The cost-effectiveness of 
implanting M-PPM is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
M-PPM implantation.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed on patients receiving a M-PPM 
across 4 institutions. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 
calculated by dividing the sum of the total incremental cost of implanting a 
M-PPM vs a conventional pacemaker and the cost of MRI scans by the utility of 
MRI scans in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained. QALY and 
lifespan of M-PPM (7-11 years) data were obtained from the literature. The 
benchmark of <$100,000 per QALY was used as the threshold for 
cost-effectiveness. Computer modeling/simulations were used to calculate the 
percentage of patients required to achieve this benchmark, to extrapolate the 
cumulative projected percentage of patients utilizing MRI scans over the 
lifespan of a M-PPM via the Weibull parametric survival model, and to conduct 
univariate and multivariate, probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The ICER during the follow-up period (21 ± 17 months) was $451,569. The 
cost-effectiveness ICER benchmark is reached 7.0 years postimplantation, when a 
projected 38% of recipients would receive MRI scans. The projected percentage of 
patients receiving MRI scans at 11 years was 58%, yielding an ICER of $74,221 
per QALY. Henceforth, assuming increased MRI usage in regular PPM based on 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services memo CAG00399R4 and decreased cost of 
M-PPM, M-PPM implantation is still cost-effective, with a lifetime ICER of 
$49,817 per QALY.
CONCLUSION: M-PPM implantation is cost-effective over the lifespan of a M-PPM 
based on projected usage of MRI.

statin and antihypertensive medications: a cross-sectional study of patient and 
primary care physician perspectives.

OBJECTIVE: Expressing therapy benefit from a lifetime perspective, instead of 
only a 10-year perspective, is both more intuitive and of growing importance in 
doctor-patient communication. In cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, 
lifetime estimates are increasingly accessible via online decision tools. 
However, it is unclear what gain in life expectancy is considered meaningful by 
those who would use the estimates in clinical practice. We therefore quantified 
lifetime and 10-year benefit thresholds at which physicians and patients 
perceive statin and antihypertensive therapy as meaningful, and compared the 
thresholds with clinically attainable benefit.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTINGS: (1) continuing medical education conference in December 2016 for 
primary care physicians;(2) information session in April 2017 for patients.
PARTICIPANTS: 400 primary care physicians and 523 patients in the Netherlands.
OUTCOME: Months gain of CVD-free life expectancy at which lifelong statin 
therapy is perceived as meaningful, and months gain at which 10 years of statin 
and antihypertensive therapy is perceived as meaningful. Physicians were framed 
as users for lifelong and prescribers for 10-year therapy.
RESULTS: Meaningful benefit was reported as median (IQR). Meaningful lifetime 
statin benefit was 24 months (IQR 23-36) in physicians (as users) and 42 months 
(IQR 12-42) in patients willing to consider therapy. Meaningful 10-year statin 
benefit was 12 months (IQR 10-12) for prescribing (physicians) and 14 months 
(IQR 10-14) for using (patients). Meaningful 10-year antihypertensive benefit 
was 12 months (IQR 8-12) for prescribing (physicians) and 14 months (IQR 10-14) 
for using (patients). Women desired greater benefit than men. Age, CVD status 
and co-medication had minimal effects on outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Both physicians and patients report a large variation in meaningful 
longevity benefit. Desired benefit differs between physicians and patients and 
exceeds what is clinically attainable. Clinicians should recognise these 
discrepancies when prescribing therapy and implement individualised medicine and 
shared decision-making. Decision tools could provide information on realistic 
therapy benefit.

Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, 
China.

Objective: To assess the disease burden for gynecological disease in China in 
2016. Methods: Data were extracted from the global burden of disease study 2016 
(GBD 2016) . The burden of gynecological disease among age groups and provinces 
groups was assessed by prevalence rate, mortality rate, years lived with 
disability (YLD) , years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLL) and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) . An average world population 
age-structure for the period 2010-2035 was adopted to calculate age-standardized 
rates. Results: In 2016, the prevalence rate of gynecological disease in women 
aged 15 years and above in China was 24.94%, of which was 36.71% to women of 
childbearing age. The number of DALY from gynecological disease was 2 727 637.82 
life years in 2016, with the DALY rate was 411.12/100 000 and standardized DALY 
rate was 341.80/100 000. The first three gynecological diseases with highest 
DALY and DALY rate among Chinese women aged ≥15 years were premenstrual syndrome 
(815 004.64 life years, 122.84/100 000) , uterine fibroids (281 976.67 life 
years, 42.5/100 000) and endometriosis (154 792.89 life years, 23.33/100 000) . 
The DALY caused by gynecological disease in Guangdong (220 871.19 life years) , 
Shandong (190 968.72 life years) , Henan (171 273.92 life years) , Jiangsu (168 
404.27 life years) and Sichuan (144 358.5 life years) were higher than other 
provinces. The standardized DALY rate attributable to gynecological disease were 
highest in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (404.00/100 000) , Shanghai 
(394.90/100 000) , Heilongjiang (382.00/100 000) , Beijing (365.70/100 000) and 
Jiangsu (357.50/100 000). Conclusions: Gynecological disease is a great threat 
to women's reproductive health. Effective measures should be taken to address 
the issue, especially to women of childbearing age.
