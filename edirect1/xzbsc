OBJECTIVE: It is uncertain if the raised mortality in schizophrenia persists in 
later life. Register-based studies suggest that excess mortality continues, 
although at a lower level than in younger age groups. However, prospective 
follow-up studies of older schizophrenia samples are lacking.
METHODS: A cohort of 157 older patients (mean age at study entry: 68 years) 
diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in a psychiatric 
catchment area in Amsterdam, the Netherlands was studied. Standardized mortality 
rate (SMR) was estimated at a 5-year follow-up, in referral to the same age 
group in the general catchment area population. The impact on survival time of a 
range of independent demographic and clinical predictors was evaluated.
RESULTS: The cohort had an all-cause SMR of 1.89 (95% CI: 1.28-2.70). SMR was 
higher in men (2.60; 95% CI: 1.42-4.37) than in women (1.78; 95% CI: 1.02-2.90). 
All deaths were from natural causes. Reduced survival was associated with higher 
age (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05-1.16), male gender (HR: 3.94; 95% CI: 1.87-8.31), 
and having had one or more compulsory admissions in the past (HR: 2.61; 95% CI: 
1.46-4.68). In contrast, no mortality associations were found with diagnosis 
(schizophrenia versus schizoaffective disorder), age at onset of the disorder, 
or current prescription of antipsychotics.
CONCLUSION: The excess mortality in schizophrenia continues into late life, 
affecting men more often than women. Given the poor insight into the underlying 
mechanisms of this disquieting finding, there is a need to identify modifiable 
clinical and social risk factors.

BACKGROUND: Although fractures of the proximal femur (FPF) are supposedly less 
frequent in Black populations (studies of incidence are rare) the life 
expectancy in Africa is low, which could partially explain this notion. There is 
only one retrospective study on the incidence of FPF in the islands of the 
Caribbean, thus we performed an incidence study in the insular, circumscribed, 
90% Afro-Caribbean population of Martinique. The goals of this study were: (1) 
to estimate the incidence of FPF; (2) and to prospectively describe the main 
characteristics.
HYPOTHESIS: The incidence of fractures of the proximal femur in Martinique is 
lower than in Western countries.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The raw and standardized incidence ratio of FPF in 
relation to the world population was estimated based on data from the Medical 
Information System Program (Programme de médicalisation des systèmes 
d'information [PMSI]) for all of Martinique for a period of 4 years (January 1, 
2010 to December 31, 2013). Characteristics were based on all patients over the 
age of 60 who presented to the Fort-de-France University Hospital (CHU) for a 
FPF between December 1, 2011 and April 31, 2012. Patients with light-skin 
phenotype, high-energy fractures and secondary fractures were excluded from the 
study.
RESULTS: The standardized incidence ratio in relation to the world population 
was estimated (n=794) as 22.5/100,000 patient-years [20.6-24.4]: 22.6 and 
22.4/100,000 in men and women respectively. The characteristics of eighty-seven 
patients (including 56 women), mean age 85.3 (±7.2) (62-100) years old were 
evaluated: 52 femoral neck fractures (60%) and 33 fractures of the greater 
trochanter (38%). The 2-month mortality rate was 21%, and 1/3 of the surviving 
patients could function independently. The risk of death increased in relation 
to the initial risk of moderate to severe dementia.
DISCUSSION: The incidence of FPF in Martinique is lower than in Western 
countries and includes, as expected, an elderly, female population. Unlike a 
previous study performed in Guadeloupe, there was a majority of femoral neck 
fractures. A Caribbean multi-insular study is needed to confirm these results 
and to obtain precise data on bone density.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a diagnostic protocol for 
appendicitis in children, the use of a validated clinical decision rule (CDR) 
and a staged imaging protocol, compared with usual care.
METHODS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of the three competing strategies 
using parameters from existing literature as well as a Markov model developed to 
simulate the effects of exposure to ionizing radiation from a single computed 
tomography (CT) study in the course of diagnosis. The simulation model was 
applied to a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 boys and girls, age 10 years, 
presenting with acute abdominal pain to emergency departments in the United 
States.
RESULTS: The integrated strategy, the CDR followed by staged imaging, was found 
to be the most cost-effective approach. Cost savings accrued from the reduction 
in CT utilization for low-risk patients compared with the other two strategies. 
The addition of ultrasound (US) to the CDR strategy reduced CT utilization by an 
additional 10.9%, its main cost advantage, with negligible change in net health 
benefits from false-negative US results, and associated morbidity or mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the integration of staged imaging with the CDR 
for the diagnosis of appendicitis in children is a cost-effective and 
cost-saving approach. The model estimates a further 10.9% reduction in the 
number of CTs from the incorporation of US for patients scoring high or medium 
risk, in excess of the 19.5% reduction estimated in the CDR validation study.

BACKGROUND: Studies to produce value sets for preference-based measures of 
health require definition of a full health upper anchor if the values are to be 
used to calculate quality-adjusted life years. Recent value sets derived for the 
EQ-5D-5L instrument have described the upper anchor as "full health," whereas 
older valuation studies for the EQ-5D used "best health state" in the 
descriptive system (11111). It is unclear whether this change could have led to 
differences in the values obtained. The objective of this study was to assess 
differences in time trade-off (TTO) valuations using two different comparators 
(full health and 11111).
METHODS: Preferences for EQ-5D-5L health states were elicited from a broadly 
representative sample of the UK general public. TTO data were collected by using 
computer-assisted personal interviews. Respondents were randomly allocated to 
one of two arms, each using a different comparator health state. Respondents 
completed 10 or 11 TTO valuations and a series of follow-up questions examining 
their interpretations of the term "full health."
RESULTS: Interviews with 443 respondents were completed in 2014. The differences 
in mean values across arms are mostly small and nonsignificant. The two arms 
produced data of similar quality. There is evidence of interviewer effects. 
Health state 11111 was given a value of 1 by 98.2% of the respondents who valued 
it.
CONCLUSIONS: EQ-5D-5L values elicited by using the composite TTO approach are 
not greatly affected by the use of full health or 11111 as the comparator health 
state.

Aims. To investigate the costs and cost-effectiveness of a short message service 
(SMS) intervention to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 
subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Methods. A Markov model was 
developed to simulate the cost and effectiveness outcomes of the SMS 
intervention and usual clinical practice from the health provider's perspective. 
The direct programme costs and the two-year SMS intervention costs were 
evaluated in subjects with IGT. All costs were expressed in 2011 US dollars. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated as cost per T2DM onset 
prevented, cost per life year gained, and cost per quality adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained. Results. Within the two-year trial period, the net intervention 
cost of the SMS group was $42.03 per subject. The SMS intervention managed to 
reduce 5.05% onset of diabetes, resulting in saving $118.39 per subject over two 
years. In the lifetime model, the SMS intervention dominated the control by 
gaining an additional 0.071 QALY and saving $1020.35 per person. The SMS 
intervention remained dominant in all sensitivity analyses. Conclusions. The SMS 
intervention for IGT subjects had the superiority of lower monetary cost and a 
considerable improvement in preventing or delaying the T2DM onset. This trial is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01556880.

How To Diagnose and Manage Infected Endografts after Endovascular Aneurysm 
Repair.

di Dio" Hospital, Florence, Italy; and.

The prevalence of endograft infections (EI) after endovascular abdominal aortic 
aneurysm repair is below 1%. With the growing number of patients with aortic 
endografts and the aging population, the number of patients with EI might also 
increase. The diagnosis is based on an association of clinical symptoms, 
imaging, and microbial cultures. Angio-computed tomography is currently the 
gold-standard technique for diagnosis. Low-grade infection sometimes requires 
nuclear medicine imaging to make a correct diagnosis. There is no good evidence 
to guide management so far. In the case of active gastrointestinal bleeding, 
pseudoaneurysm, or extensive perigraft purulence involving adjacent organs, an 
invasive treatment should always be attempted. In the other cases (the 
majority), when there is not an immediate danger to the patient's life, a 
conservative management is started with a proper antimicrobial therapy. Any 
infectious cavity can be percutaneously drained. Management depends on the 
patient's condition and a tailored approach should always be offered. In the 
case of a patient who is young, has a good life expectancy, or in whom there is 
absence of significant comorbidities, a surgical attempt can be proposed. 
Surgical techniques favor, in terms of mortality, patency, and reinfection rate, 
the in situ reconstruction. Choice of technique relies on the center and the 
operator's experience. Long-term antibiotic therapy is always required in all 
cases, with close monitoring of the C-reactive protein.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the feasibility of applying value-based insurance designs 
(V-BIDs) to the treatment of mental health disorders and address any additional 
challenges posed.
STUDY DESIGN: Literature review.
METHODS: This study consisted of 3 steps. First, we reviewed the historical 
literature on V-BIDs and challenges revealed by various programs. Second, we 
reviewed the literature on the cost, scope, and various treatment options for 
mental health disorders. Third, we analyzed potential challenges in applying 
V-BIDs to mental health disorders.
RESULTS: Many challenges exist in applying V-BID to the management and treatment 
of physical and mental health disorders, such as getting buy-in from insurance 
companies and from large employers, and adherence issues for those with 
diminished capabilities to comprehend program benefits and those lacking family 
support. Additional challenges specific to mental health disorders include: a) 
privacy (ie, sensitivity issues) in implementing the program in certain 
settings; and b) sociodemographic variables, along with perceptions of mental 
disorder severity and need that currently affect the take-up of mental health 
services.
CONCLUSIONS: Research projects focused on applying V-BID to mental health 
disorders that address these challenges and demonstrate cost savings will be 
needed (ie, comparative effectiveness research studies), along with additional 
information on changes in disability-adjusted life-years, and on-demand 
responses across different mental health services, populations, and care 
settings.

Aging & healthcaRE (SHARE), University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Many oncological drugs that are being used in the adjuvant setting 
were first submitted for reimbursement in the metastatic stage, with differences 
in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in both settings having 
potential implications for reimbursement and pricing. The aim of this study is 
to identify a possible trend in the cost-effectiveness for the early/adjuvant 
and late/metastatic stages of oncological drugs through review and case study.
METHODS: We reviewed pairs of cost-effectiveness analyses of the same 
oncological drug in different stages for Scotland and the Netherlands. The case 
study in this report was directed at trastuzumab in the Dutch situation. Using a 
simplified Markov model, the cost-effectiveness in early and late stage of 
breast cancer was calculated and compared to the findings from the review.
RESULTS: Comparable studies were found for cetuximab, bortezomib and bosutinib. 
Treatments in the late stage were found to be more expensive per QALY by a 
factor ranging from 1.5 to 12. The case study provided a similar result; late 
stage treatment was more expensive by a factor 10. Using, for example, a 
threshold of € 80,000/QALY, the early stage of cetuximab, bosutinib and 
trastuzumab are deemed cost-effective, while their compared late stage is lifted 
over the threshold and potentially considered not cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: ICERs of oncological drugs used in different stages are more 
unfavourable in the late stage than in the early stage. Applying a reasonable 
threshold may result in early stage treatment being deemed cost-effective while 
late stage potentially not. Authorities should be aware of this when assessing 
oncological drugs and interpreting the corresponding ICERs, in the situation 
where oncological drugs are generally most submitted for reimbursement in the 
late stage initially.

BACKGROUND: White shrimps (Litopenaeus vannamei) are a major aquaculture product 
in the world fishery market. The main aim of this study was to investigate the 
effect of clove- and cinnamon-assimilated starch edible films on the shelf life 
of white shrimps in terms of maintaining their freshness and other organoleptic 
properties. Physical, chemical, microbial and sensory qualities of edible 
film-wrapped white shrimps were studied until they reached their limit of 
acceptability during storage at different temperatures (10 and 4 °C).
RESULTS: Shrimp samples wrapped with spice-assimilated edible films showed lower 
bacterial counts. Shelf life extension of edible film-wrapped white shrimps was 
estimated to be 14 and 12 days for storage at 10 and 4 °C respectively. Reduced 
lipid oxidation and release of nitrogen base compounds were noted for edible 
film-wrapped shrimp samples. Good consumer acceptance was noted for edible 
film-wrapped shrimp samples through sensory evaluation.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that spice-fused edible films were 
effective in inhibiting the growth of microbial populations. Reductions in lipid 
oxidation and total volatile base nitrogen were also achieved through edible 
film wrapping of shrimps, which increased their consumer acceptance during 
sensory evaluation. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.

Research Waste: How Are Dental Survival Articles Indexed and Reported?

Layton DM, Clarke M.

PURPOSE: Research waste occurs when research is ignored, cannot be found, cannot 
be used, or is unintentionally repeated. This article aims to investigate how 
dental survival analyses were indexed and reported, and to discuss whether 
errors in indexing and writing articles are affecting identification and use of 
survival articles, contributing to research waste.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles reporting survival of dental prostheses in 
humans (also known as time-to-event) were identified by searching 50 dental 
journals that had the highest Impact Factor in 2008. These journals were hand 
searched twice (Kappa 0.92), and the articles were assessed by two independent 
reviewers (Kappa 0.86) to identify dental survival articles ("case" articles, n 
= 95), likely false positives (active controls, n = 91), and all other true 
negative articles (passive controls, n = 6,769). This means that the study used 
a case:control method. Once identified, the different groups of articles were 
assessed and compared. Allocation of medical subject headings (MeSH) by MEDLINE 
indexers that related to survival was sought, use of words by authors in the 
abstract and title that related to survival was identified, and use of words and 
figures by authors that related to survival in the articles themselves was also 
sought. Differences were assessed with chi-square and Fisher's Exact statistics. 
Reporting quality was also assessed. The results were reviewed to discuss their 
potential impact on research waste.
RESULTS: Allocation of survival-related MeSH index terms across the three 
article groups was inconsistent and inaccurate. Statistical MeSH had not been 
allocated to 30% of the dental survival "case" articles and had been incorrectly 
allocated to 15% of active controls. Additionally, information reported by 
authors in titles and abstracts varied, with only two-thirds of survival "case" 
articles mentioning survival "statistics" in the abstract. In the articles 
themselves, time-to-event statistical methods, survival curves, and life tables 
were poorly reported or constructed. Overall, the low quality of indexing by 
indexers and reporting by authors means that these articles will not be readily 
identifiable through electronic searches, and, even if they are found, the poor 
reporting quality makes it unnecessarily difficult for readers to understand and 
use them.
CONCLUSION: There are substantial problems with the reporting of time-to-event 
analyses in the dental literature. These problems will adversely impact how 
these articles can be found and used, thereby contributing to research waste. 
Changes are needed in the way that authors report these studies and the way 
indexers classify them.

Planning Implant Placement on 3D Stereolithographic Models Applied with 
Immediate Loading of Implant-Supported Hybrid Prostheses After Multiple 
Extractions: A Case Series.

Aires I, Berger J.

PURPOSE: The aim of this noninterventional, retrospective case series was to 
evaluate the outcome of immediately loaded implants in patients with failing 
dentitions that require bone tabling using a bone reduction guide and a surgical 
guide manufactured directly on three-dimensional (3D) stereolithographic models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with failing dentition and at least 
two remaining teeth who were treated in a single center between December 14, 
2009 and September 23, 2013 were eligible. All patients receiving implants 
loaded with a hybrid prosthesis on the same day as extraction with their surgery 
planned on 3D models and performed using a surgical guide manufactured in a 
laboratory on the planning model were included. Patients who had undergone bone 
grafting procedures were excluded. Descriptive statistical analyses of available 
data were performed, including life-table calculations to derive a cumulative 
survival rate (CSR).
RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-eight patients (105 females and 123 males) received 
1,657 implants (NobelActive) in 321 arches, in most cases 5 implants (range, 5 
to 7) per arch. Ten preexisting implants were used. The mean insertion torque 
was 60.02 ± 13.1 Ncm (range, 15 to 75 Ncm). The definitive abutment was placed 
on the same day as surgery in all cases, and the definitive prosthesis (n = 304) 
was delivered after a mean of 7.9 ± 2.6 months. All implants were followed for 
20.01 ± 11.3 months (range, 0 to 52 months) from implant insertion. Four 
implants (3 patients) had delayed loading, and one implant was left as a 
sleeping implant. Eight implants among six patients failed, two of the implants 
after prosthesis delivery. The CSR of the placed implants was 99.4% at implant 
level and 96.2% at patient level.
CONCLUSION: Planning on 3D models to remove bone and place implants using 
custom-made bone reduction and surgical guides with immediate loading on the 
same day as extraction of remaining teeth was safe and effective for implant 
survival and rehabilitation of patients with periodontitis and failing 
dentition.

The experiment was conducted to determine the influence of mirror movements in 
bimanual coordination during life span. Children, young adults, and older adults 
were instructed to perform a continuous 1:2 bimanual coordination task by 
performing flexion-extension wrist movements over 30s where symmetrical and 
non-symmetrical coordination patterns alternate throughout the trial. The vision 
of the wrists was covered and Lissajous-feedback was provided online. All age 
groups had to perform 10 trials under three different load conditions (0kg, 
.5kg, 1.0kg: order counterbalanced). Load was manipulated to determine if 
increased load increases the likelihood of mirror movements. The data indicated 
that the performance of the young adults was superior compared to the children 
and older adults. Children and older adults showed a stronger tendency to 
develop mirror movements and had particular difficulty in performing the 
non-symmetrical mode. This type of influence may be attributed to neural 
crosstalk.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) adversely affects the quality of 
life and life expectancy of patients. Shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue in 
lower limbs are the main reasons limiting physical activities of patients. The 
lack of physical activity results in poorer muscle strength. The latest 
guidelines regarding breathing rehabilitation in COPD patients emphasize a 
significant role of inspiratory muscle exercises. The objective of the present 
study was to evaluate the effects of an 8-week long inspiratory muscle training, 
interval training on a cycle ergometer, and training combining both kinds of 
rehabilitation, on pulmonary function, health-related quality of life, and the 
tolerance to exercise in patients with COPD. The study was conducted in a group 
of 43 patients with diagnosed COPD stage II and III according to GOLD. They were 
randomly divided into four training groups: inspiratory muscle training (Group 
1), cycle ergometer training (Group 2), cycle ergometer and inspiratory muscle 
training (Group 3), control group - patients who did not participate in any 
rehabilitation programs (Group 4 - control). Before the rehabilitation process 
and after its completion the patients were medically examined, they completed a 
health-related quality of life questionnaire, performed a 6-min walk test, 
spirometry, and a treadmill exercise test according to the modified Bruce 
protocol. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the quality of 
life measured for Group 3 in comparison with the control group.

It is well established now that dietary calorie restriction (CR) leads to 
extension of life span in many species, although the exact mechanism of this 
effect is still eluding. In the present study, we examined the effect of 40 % CR 
imposed during a prolonged period of life span (from 6 to 30 months) of rats on 
the activity of DNA polymerase β (pol β) in view of its role in short gap base 
excision DNA repair and template driven primer extension. DNA pol β activity is 
very low at this late age. However, cortical neuronal extracts prepared from CR 
rats of 30 months age showed significantly higher pol β protein levels and 
activity when compared to control 30 month old rats. Yet, one-nucleotide gap 
repair in old control neurons and an improved efficiency in CR neurons could be 
visualized only after supplementation of the extracts with T4 DNA ligase 
indicating the lack of CR affect on ligase activity. No impressive primer 
extension activity is seen either in the CR or old control neurons. These 
results are taken to convey that extended CR through adult life leads to 
improved pol β activity and therefore, pol β dependent DNA gap repair activity.

In the next few decades, a significant increase in the number of elderly 
survivors diagnosed with cancer is anticipated due to an increase in life 
expectancy and better medical treatments. The reality of being old and being 
diagnosed with cancer may limit considerably the future time perspective (time 
expected to live) of both the patient and his or her caregiver(s) and lead then 
to invest resources in emotionally meaningful goals and close social 
relationships. The goal of the current study was to describe the relationship 
among psychological distress, depression, social support, and hope in a cohort 
of oldest old patients diagnosed with cancer and their spousal caregivers living 
at home. We predicted that patients would rely mostly on their hope and less on 
social as a source of coping. Our cross-sectional sample consisted of 45 
patients with cancer and 45 spouses; all individuals were at least 86 years old. 
The participants completed standardized self-report measures of depression, 
distress, hope, and social support. Patients presented extremely high levels of 
psychological distress compared with their spousal caregivers, who exhibited 
significantly lower levels of distress and depression. Among patients, hope but 
not social support was found to be negatively correlated to distress. In order 
to enhance the quality of life of oldest old cancer patients and their spouses, 
health care teams should understand and address the unique needs of each 
individual within the dyads of patients and spouses in this group.

INTRODUCTION: Early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) is a serious debilitating disorder 
with considerable morbidity and a reduced life expectancy; therefore, early 
diagnosis and effective treatments are particularly important. Negative symptoms 
are more prominent in adolescents and children (compared with adults), and are 
key predictors of worse functional and clinical outcomes in EOS. Therefore, this 
study aimed to explore the relative efficacy of antipsychotics used in the 
treatment of EOS, with a focus on studies reporting effectiveness using the 
Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS), a scale that includes an overall 
symptom measure, in addition to separate subscales for positive and, 
importantly, negative symptoms.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using the MEDLINE and 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify trials 
conducted in children and adolescents with schizophrenia, and symptom control 
was reported using the PANSS. A Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis 
was performed, synthesising data for a number of outcomes, including mean change 
from baseline in PANSS scores, treatment discontinuation and weight gain.
RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the evidence synthesis, comprising 1714 
patients across eight active interventions (aripiprazole, haloperidol, 
molindone, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone) 
and placebo. All treatments showed a greater reduction in total PANSS scores vs 
placebo; however, only three interventions (molindone, olanzapine and 
risperidone) were associated with a statistically significant reduction in total 
PANSS scores at 6 weeks vs placebo. Haloperidol had the greatest reduction vs 
placebo; however, this result was not statistically significant [mean 
difference, -15.6, 95% credible interval (-35.4, 4.1)]. Haloperidol, olanzapine 
and risperidone showed a statistically significant reduction in positive PANSS 
scores vs placebo; however, whilst all interventions showed a trend of reduction 
in negative PANSS scores vs placebo, no comparisons were statistically 
significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Many of the treatments are efficacious in controlling symptoms, and 
all showed a trend of superiority vs placebo for total, positive and negative 
PANSS scores, although only olanzapine and risperidone yielded statistically 
significant results vs placebo for both total and positive PANSS scores. Varying 
results for discontinuation and weight gain demonstrate a need to balance 
efficacy with side-effect profiles.

Taenia solium is an endemic parasite in India which occurs in two forms in 
humans: cysticercosis (infection of soft tissues) and taeniosis (intestinal 
infection). Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the most severe form of cysticercosis in 
which cysts develop in the central nervous system. This study was conducted to 
estimate health and economic impact due to human NCC-associated active epilepsy 
in India. Input data were sourced from published research literature, census 
data and other official records. Economic losses due to NCC-associated active 
epilepsy were estimated based on cost of treatment, hospitalisation and severe 
injury as well as loss of income. The disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due 
to NCC were estimated by combining years of life lost due to early death and the 
number of years compromised due to disability taking the disease incidence into 
account. DALYs were estimated for five age groups, two genders and four regions, 
and then combined. To account for uncertainty, probability distributions were 
used for disease incidence data and other input parameters. In addition, 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the impact of certain input 
parameters on health and economic estimates. It was estimated that in 2011, 
human NCC-associated active epilepsy caused an annual median loss of Rupees 
12.03 billion (uncertainty interval [95% UI] Rs. 9.16-15.57 billion; US $ 185.14 
million) with losses of Rs. 9.78 billion (95% UI Rs. 7.24-13.0 billion; US $ 
150.56 million) from the North and Rs. 2.22 billion (95% UI Rs. 1.58-3.06 
billion; US $ 34.14 million) from the South. The disease resulted in a total of 
2.10 million (95% UI 0.99-4.10 million) DALYs per annum without age weighting 
and time discounting with 1.81 million (95% UI 0.84-3.57 million) DALYs from the 
North and 0.28 million (95% UI 0.13-0.55 million) from the South. The health 
burden per thousand persons per year was 1.73 DALYs (95% UI 0.82-3.39). The 
results indicate that human NCC causes significant health and economic impact in 
India. Programs for controlling the disease should be initiated to reduce the 
socio-economic impact of the disease in India.

Acute exposure to selenium disrupts associative conditioning and long-term 
memory recall in honey bees (Apis mellifera).

A plethora of toxic compounds - including pesticides, heavy metals, and 
metalloids - have been detected in honey bees (Apis mellifera) and their 
colonies. One such compound is selenium, which bees are exposed to by consuming 
nectar and pollen from flowers grown in contaminated areas. Though selenium is 
lethal at high concentrations, sublethal exposure may also impair honey bees' 
ability to function normally. Examining the effect of selenium exposure on 
learning and memory provides a sensitive assay with which to identify sublethal 
effects on honey bee health and behavior. To determine whether sublethal 
selenium exposure causes learning and memory deficits, we used proboscis 
extension reflex conditioning coupled with recall tests 30min and 24h 
post-conditioning. We exposed forager honey bees to a single sublethal dose of 
selenium, and 3h later we used an olfactory conditioning assay to train the bees 
to discriminate between one odor associated with sucrose-reinforcement and a 
second unreinforced odor. Following conditioning we tested short- and long-term 
recall of the task. Acute exposure to as little as 1.8ng of an inorganic form of 
selenium (sodium selenate) before conditioning caused a reduction in behavioral 
performance during conditioning. And, exposure to 18ng of either an inorganic 
form (sodium selenate) or an organic form (methylseleno-l-cysteine) of selenium 
caused a reduction in the bees' performance during the long-term recall test. 
These concentrations of selenium are lower than those found in the nectar of 
plants grown in selenium-contaminated soil, indicating that even low-grade 
selenium toxicity produces significant learning and memory impairments. This may 
reduce foragers' ability to effectively gather resources for the colony or nurse 
bees' ability to care for and maintain a healthy colony.

Herpes Zoster Vaccine in the Long-Term Care Setting: A Clinical and Logistical 
Conundrum.

Schafer KM(1), Reidt S.

Author information:
(1)Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.

Advancing age is associated with an increased risk of herpes zoster (shingles) 
infection and latent effects such as postherpetic neuralgia. The herpes zoster 
vaccine is recommended in those 60 years of age and older and has been shown to 
prevent both the primary disease and associated complications. While this 
recommendation applies to those living in long-term care facilities, there is 
little clinical evidence to support use in this population. Additionally, there 
are logistical barriers that may complicate the use of the vaccine. The article 
examines the evidence for vaccinating residents in long-term care facilities and 
discusses logistical barriers to vaccination. Pharmacists and providers may 
consider life expectancy and other factors when evaluating which patients should 
receive the vaccination.

Recent studies have shown that people with severe mental illness have a 
dramatically lower life expectancy than the general population. Psychiatrists 
have not traditionally been very attentive to or involved with physical health 
issues and there has been growing emphasis on integrated care for physical and 
mental health and access to primary care for all members of the population. This 
paper examines the role of psychiatrists in the provision of primary care to the 
patients they treat. Some recommendations are offered for their involvement in 
the provision of primary care at three levels of complexity: Level 1--Universal 
Basic Psychiatric Primary Care; Level 2--Enhanced Psychiatric Primary Care; and 
Level 3--Fully Integrated Primary Care and Psychiatric Management. Some of the 
obstacles to the provision of primary care by psychiatrists are considered along 
with some suggestions for overcoming them.

BACKGROUND: The HPV vaccine was introduced to Malaysian national immunization 
programme in 2010. The current implementation age of HPV vaccination in 
Malaysian is at the age of 13 years school girls, given according to a 3 doses 
protocol which may complicate implementation and compliance. Aim of the study is 
to determine the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination regime comparing twice 
versus thrice HPV vaccinations dose regime among adolescent girls in Malaysia.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model reflecting the natural history of HPV infection 
accounting for oncogenic and low-risk HPV was adapted for 13 year old Malaysian 
girls cohort (n = 274,050). Transition probabilities, utilities values, 
epidemiological and cost data were sourced from published literature and local 
data. Vaccine effectiveness was based on overall efficacy reported from 3-doses 
clinical trials, with the assumption that the 2-doses is non-inferior to the 
3-doses allowing overall efficacy to be inferred from the 3-doses immunogenicity 
data. Price parity and life-long protection were assumed. The payer perspective 
was adopted, with appropriate discounting for costs (3 %) and outcomes (3 %). 
One way sensitivity analysis was conducted. The sensitivity analysis on cost of 
vaccine, vaccine coverage and discount rate with a 2-doses protocol was 
performed.
RESULT: The 3-doses and 2-doses regimes showed same number of Cervical Cancers 
averted (361 cases); QALYs saved at 7,732,266. However, the lifetime protection 
under the 2-doses regime, showed a significant cost-savings of RM 36, 722,700 
compared to the 3-doses scheme. The MOH Malaysia could vaccinate 137,025 more 
girls in this country using saving 2-doses regime vaccination programme. The 
model predicted that 2-doses HPV vaccination schemes can avoid additional 180 
Cervical Cancers and 63 deaths compare to 3-doses.
CONCLUSION: A 2-doses HPV vaccination scheme may enable Malaysian women to be 
protected at a lower cost than that achievable under a 3-doses scheme, while 
avoiding the same number of Cervical Cancer cases and deaths. Using the saving 
money with 2-doses, more Cervical Cancers and deaths can be avoided.

Purpose The purpose of this study is to improve web-based employability 
interventions for employees with work-related health problems for both 
intervention content and study design by means of a pilot economic evaluation. 
Methods Uptake rate analysis for the intervention elements, cost effectiveness, 
cost utility and subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential 
content-related intervention improvements. Differences in work ability and 
quality-adjusted life years and overall contribution of resource items to the 
total costs were assessed. These were used to guide study design improvements. 
Results Sixty-three participants were a-select allocated to either the 
intervention (n = 29) or the control (n = 34) group. Uptake regarding the 
intervention elements ranged between 3% and 70%. Cost-effectiveness and 
cost-utility analyses resulted in negative effects although higher total costs. 
Incremental effects were marginal (work ability -0.51; QALY -0.01). Conclusions 
The web-based tool to enhance employability among work disabled employees 
requires improvements regarding targeting and intensity; outcome measures 
selected and collection of cost data. With respect to the studies of disability
