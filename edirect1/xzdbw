IMPORTANCE: Two 2018 randomized controlled trials (DAWN and DEFUSE 3) 
demonstrated the clinical benefit of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) more than 6 
hours after onset in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Health-economic evidence is 
needed to determine whether the short-term health benefits of late MT translate 
to a cost-effective option during a lifetime in the United States.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of 2 strategies (MT added to 
standard medical care [SMC] vs SMC alone) for various subgroups of patients with 
AIS receiving care more than 6 hours after symptom onset.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation study used the 
results of the DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials to populate a cost-effectiveness model 
from a US health care perspective combining a decision tree and Markov trace. 
The DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials enrolled 206 international patients from 2014 to 
2017 and 182 US patients from 2016 to 2017, respectively. Patients were followed 
until 3 months after stroke. The clinical outcome at 3 months was available for 
29 subgroups of patients with AIS and anterior circulation large vessel 
occlusions. Data analysis was conducted from July 2018 to October 2019.
EXPOSURES: MT with SMC in the extended treatment window vs SMC alone.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) during lifetime were estimated. Deterministic results (incremental costs 
and effectiveness, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and net monetary 
benefit) were presented, and probabilistic analyses were performed for the total 
populations and 27 patient subgroups.
RESULTS: In the DAWN study, the MT group had a mean (SD) age of 69.4 (14.1) 
years and 42 of 107 (39.3%) were men, and the control group had a mean (SD) age 
of 70.7 (13.2) years and 51 of 99 (51.5%) were men. In the DEFUSE 3 study, the 
MT group had a median (interquartile range) age of 70 (59-79) years, and 46 of 
92 (50.0%) were men, and the control group had a median (interquartile range) 
age of 71 (59-80) years, and 44 of 90 (48.9%) were men. For the total trial 
population, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $662/QALY and 
$13 877/QALY based on the DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials, respectively. MT with SMC 
beyond 6 hours had a probability greater than 99.9% of being cost-effective vs 
SMC alone at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000/QALY. Subgroup analyses 
showed a wide range of probabilities for MT with SMC to be cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY, with the greatest uncertainty 
observed for patients with a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score of 
at least 16 and for those aged 80 years or older.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that late MT added 
to SMC is cost-effective in all subgroups evaluated in the DAWN and DEFUSE 3 
trials, with most results being robust in probabilistic sensitivity analyses. 
Future MT evidence-gathering could focus on older patients and those with 
National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores of 16 and greater.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Acromegaly is a rare disease with a peak of incidence in 
early adulthood. However, enhanced awareness of this disease, combined with wide 
availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has increased the diagnosis of 
forms with mild presentation, especially in elderly patients. Moreover, due to 
increased life expectancy and proactive individualized treatment, patients with 
early-onset acromegaly are today aging. The aim of our study was to describe our 
cohort of elderly patients with acromegaly.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional retrospective study of 96 
outpatients. Clinical, endocrine, treatment, and follow-up data were collected 
using the electronic database of the University Hospital of Padova, Italy.
RESULTS: We diagnosed acromegaly in 13 patients, aged ≥65 years, presenting with 
relatively small adenomas and low IGF-1 secretion. Among them, 11 patients were 
initially treated with medical therapy and half normalized hormonal levels after 
6 months without undergoing neurosurgery (TNS). Remission was achieved after TNS 
in three out of four patients (primary TNS in two); ten patients presented 
controlled acromegaly at the last visit. Acromegaly-related comorbidities (colon 
polyps, thyroid cancer, adrenal incidentaloma, hypertension, and bone disease) 
were more prevalent in patients who had an early diagnosis (31 patients, 
characterized by a longer follow-up of 24 years) than in those diagnosed aged 
≥65 years (5 years of follow-up).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly acromegalic patients are not uncommon. Primary medical 
therapy is a reasonable option and is effectively used, while the rate of 
surgical success is not reduced. A careful cost-benefit balance is suggested. 
Disease-specific comorbidities are more prevalent in acromegalic patients with a 
longer follow-up rather than in those diagnosed aged ≥65 years.

Objectives Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency (HCSD) (OMIM #253270) is a rare 
inborn error of metabolism with an estimated annual incidence of 1 in 200,000 
people. Typical manifestations of HCSD include eczema, alopecia, lactic acidosis 
and hyperammonemia. Diagnosis is made through genetic analysis. Case 
presentation Patient 1 was a 7-year-old girl with normal growth and development, 
presenting with severe hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis. Her family reported 
that she was diagnosed as having ketotic hypoglycemia; she had five episodes of 
hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis in past 4 years when her oral intake 
decreased during acute illness. Patient 2 was a 6-month-old female infant with 
normal growth and development, presenting with progressive generalized eczema 
and metabolic acidosis for the first time. We found that they both had 
hyperammonemia, hyperlactatemia, hyperketonemia, organic acids detected in urine 
and elevated C5OH acylcarnitine level by tandem mass spectrometry. HLCS gene 
analysis showed a homozygous pathogenic variant p.V363D in patient 1 and a 
pathogenic variant p.R508W compound with a novel splice site pathogenic variant 
c.2010-1G>A in patient 2. They have been on biotin treatment (10 mg/day for both 
of them) for more than 2 years and no more symptoms have occurred. Conclusions 
HCSD is a rare disease, and it can be fatal if severe metabolic acidosis occurs 
without timely management. Once the diagnosis is made, most of the patients with 
HCSD have good prognosis and normal life expectancy with biotin treatment.

Gluconeogenesis and PEPCK are critical components of healthy aging and dietary 
restriction life extension.

High glucose diets are unhealthy, although the mechanisms by which elevated 
glucose is harmful to whole animal physiology are not well understood. In 
Caenorhabditis elegans, high glucose shortens lifespan, while chemically 
inflicted glucose restriction promotes longevity. We investigated the impact of 
glucose metabolism on aging quality (maintained locomotory capacity and median 
lifespan) and found that, in addition to shortening lifespan, excess glucose 
negatively impacts locomotory healthspan. Conversely, disrupting glucose 
utilization by knockdown of glycolysis-specific genes results in large mid-age 
physical improvements via a mechanism that requires the FOXO transcription 
factor DAF-16. Adult locomotory capacity is extended by glycolysis disruption, 
but maximum lifespan is not, indicating that limiting glycolysis can increase 
the proportion of life spent in mobility health. We also considered the largely 
ignored role of glucose biosynthesis (gluconeogenesis) in adult health. Directed 
perturbations of gluconeogenic genes that specify single direction enzymatic 
reactions for glucose synthesis decrease locomotory healthspan, suggesting that 
gluconeogenesis is needed for healthy aging. Consistent with this idea, 
overexpression of the central gluconeogenic gene pck-2 (encoding PEPCK) 
increases health measures via a mechanism that requires DAF-16 to promote pck-2 
expression in specific intestinal cells. Dietary restriction also features 
DAF-16-dependent pck-2 expression in the intestine, and the healthspan benefits 
conferred by dietary restriction require pck-2. Together, our results describe a 
new paradigm in which nutritional signals engage gluconeogenesis to influence 
aging quality via DAF-16. These data underscore the idea that promotion of 
gluconeogenesis might be an unappreciated goal for healthy aging and could 
constitute a novel target for pharmacological interventions that counter high 
glucose consequences, including diabetes.

This study contributes to interdisciplinary research on the social and 
environmental determinants of population health, with a focus on the interaction 
between working hours and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration. The 
authors estimate longitudinal models of the relationship between US state-level 
average life expectancy and both average working hours and PM2.5 concentration 
for the 2005-2014 period. Results obtained from two-way fixed effects models 
indicate that average life expectancy is negatively associated with both average 
working hours and fine particulate matter concentration. Findings also indicate 
clear moderating relationships: the negative association between life expectancy 
and working hours is amplified as PM2.5 concentration increases, and the 
negative relationship between life expectancy and fine particulate matter 
concentration is amplified when average working hours increase. The results of 
this study underscore the need for additional research on the multiplicative 
impacts of socioeconomic factors and environmental factors in the modeling of 
population health.

BACKGROUND: Food allergy quality of life (FAQL) is impaired in children with 
peanut allergy. Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaires (FAQLQs) provide 
disease-specific insight into the burden of peanut allergy and potential FAQL 
changes after peanut immunotherapy.
OBJECTIVE: To examine FAQL changes in children after treatment with epicutaneous 
immunotherapy for peanut allergy (250 μg, daily epicutaneous peanut protein; 
DBV712 250 μg).
METHODS: FAQL was prospectively measured using the FAQLQ parent proxy form (Food 
Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-Parent Proxy Form [FAQLQ-PF], for children 
aged ≤12 years) and child form (Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-Child 
Form [FAQLQ-CF], child rated if aged ≥8 years) during the 12-month double-blind, 
randomized, controlled Peanut EPIT Efficacy and Safety Study (PEPITES) trial and 
the initial 12 months of the open-label PEPITES Open Label Extension Study 
(PEOPLE) follow-up study. Data were analyzed for between-group differences after 
treatment unblinding.
RESULTS: FAQLQs from placebo participants (FAQLQ-PF: 96; FAQLQ-CF: 47) and 
treatment group participants (FAQLQ-PF: 209; FAQLQ-CF: 105) were analyzed. 
Twenty-four-month global FAQL scores (FAQLQ-PF/FAQLQ-CF) were significantly 
improved in the treatment group versus the placebo group (least squares mean, 
0.34, P = .008, and 0.46, P = .023, respectively). At 24 months, there was 
significant FAQLQ-PF score improvement in participants initially randomized to 
treatment who met the efficacy primary end point (n = 74; least squares mean, 
0.55; P < .001) and in participants with any eliciting dose increase (n = 127; 
least squares mean, 0.66; P < .001). FAQLQ-PF improvements were observed in 
social dietary limitations (P = .002), food-related anxiety (P = .029), and 
emotional impact (P = .048) domains. FAQLQ-CF improvements were observed in risk 
of accidental exposure (P = .002) and allergen avoidance (P = .04) domains. 
Nearly all outcomes met a nontreatment context minimal clinically important 
difference previously cited for FAQLQ.
CONCLUSIONS: Epicutaneous immunotherapy treatment was observed to be associated 
with significant global and domain-specific FAQL improvement 
(FAQLQ-PF/FAQLQ-CF), largely driven by increases in eliciting dose, in children 
with peanut allergy.

Estimating the lung cancer disease burden can provide evidence for public health 
practitioners, researchers, and policymakers. This study uses claim data from 
lung cancer patients for 2006-2015 from the Korean National Health Insurance 
Service to estimate the lung cancer burdens attributable to residential radon in 
Korea using disability-adjusted life years (DALY) and patients' annual economic 
burden with societal perspectives using the cost-of-illness (COI) method. The 
number of patients increased during our study period (from 35,866 to 59,168). 
The disease burden and that attributable to residential radon, respectively, 
increased from 517.57 to 695.74 and 64.62 (95%; CIs 61.33-67.69) to 86.99 (95%; 
CIs 82.7-91.1) DALYs per 100,000 patients. The percentage of years lost due to 
disability among the DALY doubled from 8% to 17%. The cost for all the patients 
was US$2.33 billion, with US$292 (95%; CIs 278-306) million attributable to 
residential radon. During the last decade, the lung cancer disease burden 
increased by 1.34 times, with a doubled percentage of non-fatal burden and 
average annual growth rate of 9.5% of the total cost. Hence, the burden and cost 
of lung cancer in Korean provinces have been steadily increasing. The findings 
could be used as input data for future cost-effectiveness analysis of policies 
regarding radon reduction.

With the continuous development of cancer treatment, the immune checkpoint 
inhibitors have been applied to the treatment of a variety of malignant tumors, 
which improved the patient's survival time and quality of life. However, 
immune-related adverse reactions occur inevitably. Like chemotherapeutics and 
targeted drugs, immunosuppressants can also cause cardiovascular events that 
affect the mortality of cancer patients. With the extension of the survival time 
of cancer patients, it will increasingly become a key factor which affects the 
prognoses of these diseases. This review focuses on the cardiotoxic mechanism, 
clinical manifestation, and future direction of immune checkpoint inhibitors 
during cancer treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an untreatable neurodegenerative disease that 
initially manifests as difficulty to remember recent events and gradually 
progresses to cognitive impairment. The incidence of AD is growing yearly as 
life expectancy increases, thus early detection is essential to ensure a better 
quality of life for diagnosed patients. To reach that purpose, electrochemical 
biosensing has emerged as a cost-effective alternative to traditional diagnostic 
techniques, due to its high sensitivity and selectivity. Of special relevance is 
the incorporation of nanomaterials in biosensors, as they contribute to enhance 
electron transfer while promoting the immobilization of biological recognition 
elements. Moreover, nanomaterials have also been employed as labels, due to 
their unique electroactive and electrocatalytic properties. The aim of this 
review is to add value in the advances achieved in the detection of AD 
biomarkers, the strategies followed for the incorporation of nanomaterials and 
its effect in biosensors performance.

Interventions to suppress the coronavirus pandemic will increase unemployment 
and lead to many premature deaths.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Interventions to suppress the coronavirus pandemic have led 
to economic recession and higher unemployment, which will increase mortality and 
decrease quality of life. The aim of this article is to estimate the 
consequences on mortality and life expectancy of increased unemployment rates 
due to the coronavirus pandemic in Sweden and other countries.
METHODS: Based on recent increases and expected future unemployment rates due to 
the coronavirus pandemic, results from a systematic review and data from vital 
statistics in Sweden, the number of premature deaths due to unemployment in 
Sweden have been estimated.
RESULTS: Based on our assumptions, the calculations show that if the number of 
unemployed persons in Sweden increases by 100,000, one may expect some 1800 more 
premature deaths during the following 9 years. If the duration of the recession 
is limited to 4 years, excess deaths due to unemployment may be around 800. On 
average, the unemployed will lose 2 years of their remaining life expectancy. In 
many other countries unemployment rates have or are estimated to rise more than 
in Sweden, sometimes two- or threefold, suggesting hundreds of thousands of 
excess deaths due to unemployment.
CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to suppress the coronavirus pandemic include the 
shut-down of economic activities and lead to increased all-cause mortality.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness and safety of 
high dose dexamethasone treatment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome 
secondary to SARS-Cov-2 pneumonia.
TRIAL DESIGN: Multicentre, randomized clinical trial, controlled, open label, 
parallel group, to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of high dose 
dexamethasone in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, with Acute Respiratory 
Distress Syndrome.
PARTICIPANTS: We will include patients with SARS-Cov-2 pneumonia who develop 
acute respiratory distress syndrome, in several intensive care units (ICU) in 
Buenos Aires, Argentina (CEMIC, Clinica Bazterrica, Sanatorio Sagrado Corazon) 
Inclusion criteria: Men and women, age ≥ 18 years old. Confirmed diagnosis of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, by RT-PCR. Diagnosis of Acute Respiratory Distress 
Syndrome (hypoxemic respiratory failure not explained by cardiac disease + 
PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 300 with a Positive End-Expiratory Pressure ≥ 5 cm H2O + 
bilateral pulmonary infiltrates) Length of mechanical ventilation of at least 72 
hours Informed consent (next of kin / legal guardian) Exclusion criteria: 
Pregnant or breast-feeding women. Terminal disease (advanced cancer; under 
palliative care; cardiovascular, respiratory, or renal disease with a life 
expectancy less ≤ 1 year). Therapeutic limitation (advance directives or do not 
resuscitate order) Severe immunosuppression (HIV infection, long-term use of 
immunosuppressive agents, active cancer). Patients under chronic treatment with 
glucocorticoids for other diseases (≥ 8 mg prednisone, or equivalent) 
Participation in another randomized clinical trial.
INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Eligible patients will be randomized to receive 
standard ICU patient care (group 1) or standard ICU patient care plus high dose 
dexamethasone (group 2). Group 1: dexamethasone up to 6 mg/24 hours for up to 10 
days + ventilatory, hemodynamic, nutritional, and antimicrobial support 
according to international guidelines. Group 2: dexamethasone 16 mg/24 hours for 
5 days followed by dexamethasone 8 mg/24 hours for 5 days + ventilatory, 
hemodynamic, nutritional, and antimicrobial support according to international 
guidelines.
MAIN OUTCOME: The main result is ventilator-free days at 28 days (Days without 
ventilator support in the first 28 days following randomization). Secondary 
outcomes are 28-days and 90-days mortality, frequency of nosocomial infections 
in the first 28 days after randomization, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) score variation and prone position in the first 10-days, viral shedding 
28-days after randomization, and delirium and muscle weakness at ICU discharge.
RANDOMISATION: Treatment will be assigned according to site stratified 
randomization by permuted random blocks sequence 1:1 generated with a table in R 
language concealed in a randomization tool in REDCap (Research Electronic Data 
CAPture) platform.
BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open trial, so no masking of treatment assignment 
will be used.
NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Assuming a 3 days difference in 
ventilator-free days between treatment groups, with a mean of 9 days, and a 
standard deviation of 9 days; the necessary sample size would be 284 subjects 
(142 per group), with a power of 80% and a two-tailed alpha error of 0.05.

In primary health care only chronic pain surpass depression and anxiety in loss 
of quality-adjusted life years. More than 70% of people suffering from common 
mental disorders consulted their GPs for this reason. However, 'the declining 
halves rule' is a reality: less than 50% of primary care attendees with common 
mental disorders were correctly diagnosed, of these less than 50% received 
adequate treatment (pharmacological or psychological) and of these less than 50% 
patients were adherent. Collaborative models of common mental disorders care in 
primary health care have demonstrated their effectiveness through clinical 
trials; however, its implementation in a more general and real context is 
difficult and its effectiveness remains unclear. Risk algorithms have been 
developed and validated in primary health care to predict the onset and 
prognosis of common mental disorders; which are useful for their treatment and 
prevention. There is evidence that psychological and psychoeducational 
interventions (and possibly those of physical exercise) are effective for the 
primary prevention of common mental disorders, even in primary health care; 
although their effects are small or moderate. These interventions have a high 
potential to be scalable in schools, workplace and primary health care; in 
addition, when they are administered through information and communication 
technologies (e.g. by App), in self-guided or minimally guided programs, they 
have demonstrated their effectiveness for the treatment and prevention of common 
mental disorders. They are also very accessible, have low cost and contribute to 
the massive implementation of these interventions in different settings.

AIM: To report on Rabson-Mendenhall Syndrome (RMS) diagnosed in Kuwait.
METHODS: A toddler (18 months old) was referred with high plasma insulin and 
dysmorphic features suggestive of RMS including coarse facial features with 
globular nose, full lips and furrowed tongue. His skin was hyperkeratotic with 
hypertrichosis. His sister (aged 13.5 years) was diagnosed with diabetes at 9 
years of age and treated with metformin and insulin. She presented with similar 
dysmorphic features, extensive acanthosis nigricans, dental abnormalities and 
bilateral nephrocalcinosis. The children were born to non-consanguineous 
parents. Blood samples were sent for genetic testing in a reference laboratory.
RESULTS: Both children were found to be homozygous for the p.Arg141Trp missense 
variant (p.Arg114Trp if numbered according to pro-receptor sequence) in the 
alpha subunit of the insulin receptor.
CONCLUSIONS: These cases demonstrate the importance of raising awareness among 
healthcare professionals to ensure rapid referral of patients with 
characteristic physical features of RMS and severe insulin resistance for 
genetic testing. Unfortunately, treatment of RMS patients remains a challenge 
with poor prognosis and short life expectancy usually caused by diabetes-related 
complications. Genetic testing confirms the diagnosis and allows informed 
genetic counseling of parents considering future pregnancies.

Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) or acid maltase deficiency is a rare 
metabolic disorder. It is caused by a deficiency in functioning of the enzyme 
acid alpha-glucosidase and leads to the accumulation of glycogen in the liver, 
heart, muscle, and other tissues. Myozyme is an effective drug, but it imposes a 
heavy financial burden on societies and healthcare systems. Therefore, this 
study was conducted to analyze the cost-effectiveness of Myozyme compared to 
conventional therapy for the treatment of IOPD. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, 
and Cochrane library databases were searched on December 2018 to identify the 
effectiveness of Myozyme versus conventional therapy. Then, a cost-effectiveness 
and a cost utility study were conducted in patients suffering from IOPD. In this 
cost effectiveness and cost utility analysis, Markov and decision tree models 
were used for modeling. Model parameters were obtained from international data, 
and the perspective of the payer was considered. Every cycle was one year; the 
model was run for 22 cycles. TreeAge pro 2011 was used for analysis. Finally, 
one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Two papers were 
included and 39 patients were evaluated as the treatment group in both studies. 
Results revealed the effectiveness of Myozyme. Results also revealed a wide 
range of adverse reactions. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) resulted in 4.21038 
quality-adjusted life years (QALY) per $381,852. The incremental cost per QALY 
was $96,809 and the incremental cost per life years gained (LYG) was 74,429 over 
a 22-year time horizon. Sensitivity analysis indicated the robustness of the 
results. Myozyme is effective for IOPD and could increase the life expectancy of 
patients significantly. However, since the calculated incremental cost per QALY 
was 17 times higher than the GDP per capita of Iran, Myozyme is not cost 
effective in Iran.

Due to improvements in healthcare services, the life expectancy of human-beings 
is being improved; therefore the interest of understanding the possibility of 
implanting an anterior tooth for maintaining healthy lifestyle is of key 
importance. The aim of this study was to investigate the labial (facial) and 
palatal cortical plate dehiscence in bamboo monkeys. A total number of 20 bamboo 
monkeys tooth samples were included in the study, comprising of 20-teeth for 
individuals average aged 42 months. Labial and palatal cortical plate thickness 
of alveolar bone was measured at three different points at 1.0mm interval from 
alveolar crest 3.0mm apically using X-ray micro-tomography. The values showed 
dehiscence of labial cortical plate 1.0mm below the crest of alveolar bone. 
Further the labial cortical plate thickness at 2.0mm (0.25±0.076) and 3.0mm 
(0.525±0.089) was observed to be less than the palatal cortical plate of 
alveolar bone. The dehiscence of buccal cortical plate was observed at a 
distance of 1.0mm in addition the thickness of buccal cortical plate at three 
different points was significantly thinner than the palatal plate (p<0.05).

Herein we describe four clinical scenarios. For the standard patient (prostate 
volume 30-80 ml, life expectancy >10 years) transurethral resection of the 
prostate (TURP) remains the standard of care, while endoscopic enucleation is 
a valuable alternative. Patients with a relevant middle lobe profit most from 
TURP, endourological enucleation procedures, or laser vaporization. In the case 
of the absence or a moderate-sized middle lobe and the absence of severe bladder 
outlet obstruction (BOO), minimally invasive procedures such as Rezūm®, UroLift® 
or prostate artery embolization (PAE) can be offered. Patients have to be 
informed that long-term data on this specific indication are lacking. 
Particularly younger men requiring BPH surgery are interested in preserving 
ejaculatory function. In the presence of severe BOO, ejaculatory-protective TURP 
or endoscopic enucleation by preserving the pericollicular region or aquablation 
are the methods of choice providing an antegrade ejaculation in 60-90% of cases. 
Rezūm®, AquaBeam®, and UroLift® enable preservation of ejaculation in almost 
100%; data on PAE with this respect are more controversial. For patients with 
a small prostate and significant post void residual, a thorough preoperative 
work-up, including urodynamics and bladder/detrusor wall thickness measurement, 
is of great importance. Desobstructive surgery provides satisfactory short- and 
midterm outcome, yet the long-term outcome is disappointing and remains to be 
determined in greater detail. The broad spectrum of therapeutic options enables 
today an individualized minimally invasive or surgical management of BPH 
considering patient wishes, anatomical factors or urodynamic factors. The time 
of a "one therapy fits all" strategy is definitely history.

The making of John Tyndall's Darwinian Revolution.

Hesketh I(1).

Author information:
(1)Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities, University of Queensland, 
Brisbane, Australia.

One of the most influential imagined histories of science of the nineteenth 
century was John Tyndall's Belfast Address of 1874. In that address, Tyndall 
presented a sweeping history of science that focused on the attempt to 
understand the material nature of life. While the address has garnered attention 
for its discussion of the conflict at the centre of this history, namely between 
science and theology, less has been said about how Tyndall's history culminated 
with a discussion of the evolutionary researches of Charles Darwin. Tyndall 
presented Darwin as a revolutionary scientific practitioner, whose virtues of 
patience, self-denial, and observation led him to his epochal theory of 
evolution and thus justified the extension of science into realms previously 
under the purview of theology. Tyndall was criticized at the time for his 
'vulgar admiration' of a man of science who was still very much alive, and who 
could not possibly live up to such 'fulsome adulation'. What such critics failed 
to realize, however, is that Tyndall had historicized the living Darwin within 
the context of his own philosophy of history that he cultivated years before, a 
philosophy that integrated the moral lives of heroic individuals within a 
progressive history of science itself.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused serious damage to 
public health. COVID-19 has no vaccine or specific therapy; its mortality rate 
increases significantly once patients deteriorate. Furthermore, intensive 
monitoring of COVID-19 is limited by insufficient medical resources and 
increased risks of exposure to medical staff. We therefore aim to build an early 
warning and rapid response system (EWRRS) to address these problems.
METHOD: The research is designed as a prospective cohort study, to verify a 
dynamic and interactive evaluation system; it includes patient self-reporting, 
active monitoring, early alarming and treatment recommendations. Adult patients 
diagnosed with COVID-19 will be recruited from Sept 2020 to Aug 2021 at a 
tertiary contagious hospital. Patients with life expectancy <48 hours, pregnant 
or lactating, in immunosuppression states or end-stage diseases will be 
excluded. The intervention is implementation of EWRRS to detect early signs of 
clinical deterioration of COVID-19 patients, to provide timely and efficient 
treatment suggestions by the system. EWRRS can determine the classification and 
interactive evaluation of patient information; the determination is based on the 
application of 3 different scenario modules, separately driven by patients, 
nurses, and physicians. The primary outcome is change in disease severity 
category after treatment. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients 
with different disease severity types; critical deterioration events; patients 
who had unplanned transfers to an intensive care unit (ICU) and required 
critical care interventions; intervals from warning to implementation of 
clinical interventions; hospital mortality; length of ICU and hospital stay; 
workload of medical staff and risks of exposure to COVID-19.
DISCUSSION: Our hypothesis is that EWRRS provides an example of an early 
identification, warning, and response system for COVID-19. In addition, EWRRS 
can potentially be extended to use as a grading metric for general critically 
ill patients in an ICU setting.

Recently, progress has been observed in the knowledge about Duchenne Muscular 
Dystrophy (DMD), which is a severe and commonly diagnosed genetic myopathy in 
childhood, historically resulting in early death. Currently, there are a lot of 
methods available to improve the clinical course of DMD and extend patients' 
life expectancy to more than 30 years of age. The key issue for DMD patients is 
the period between 16-18 years of age, which is described as a transition from 
pediatric- to adult-oriented healthcare. Adolescents and adults with DMD have 
highly complex healthcare needs associated with long-term steroid usage, 
orthopedic, ventilation, cardiac, and gastrointestinal problems. The current 
paper provides a comprehensive overview of special healthcare needs related to 
the transfer of a patient with DMD from child-oriented to adult-oriented care. 
Additionally, the need to organize effective care for adults with DMD is 
presented.

Life expectancy is increasing and so is the prevalence of age-related 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Consequently, older people and patients 
present with multi-morbidities and more complex needs, putting significant 
pressure on healthcare systems. Effective nutrition interventions could be an 
important tool to address patient needs, improve clinical outcomes and reduce 
healthcare costs. Inflammation plays a central role in NCDs, so targeting it is 
relevant to disease prevention and treatment. The long-chain omega-3
