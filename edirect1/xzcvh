primate (NHP) models of VEEV infection. Here, we evaluated a chimeric antibody 
1A3B-7 (c1A3B-7) containing mouse variable regions on a human IgG framework and 
a humanized antibody 1A4A-1 containing a serum half-life extension modification 
(Hu-1A4A-1-YTE) for their post-exposure efficacy in NHPs exposed to aerosolized 
VEEV. Approximately 24 hours after exposure, NHPs were administered a single 
bolus intravenous mAb. Control NHPs had typical biomarkers of VEEV infection 
including measurable viremia, fever, and lymphopenia. In contrast, c1A3B-7 
treated NHPs had significant reductions in viremia and lymphopenia and on 
average approximately 50% reduction in fever. Although not statistically 
significant, Hu-1A4A-1-YTE administration did result in reductions in viremia 
and fever duration. Delay of treatment with c1A3B-7 to 48 hours post-exposure 
still provided NHPs protection from severe VEE disease through reductions in 
viremia and fever. These results demonstrate that post-exposure administration 
of c1A3B-7 protected macaques from development of severe VEE disease even when 
administered 48 hours following aerosol exposure and describe the first 
evaluations of VEEV-specific mAbs for post-exposure prophylactic use in NHPs. 
Viral mutations were identified in one NHP after c1A3B-7 treatment administered 
24 hrs after virus exposure. This suggests that a cocktail-based therapy, or an 
alternative mAb against an epitope that cannot mutate without resulting in loss 
of viral fitness may be necessary for a highly effective therapeutic.

IMPORTANCE: Clinicians have an opportunity to provide smoking cessation 
interventions to smokers who present to emergency departments (EDs). The 
effectiveness of a brief intervention based on self-determination theory for 
smoking cessation is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of a brief intervention based on 
self-determination theory for smoking cessation (immediate or progressive) among 
Chinese smokers presenting at EDs in Hong Kong.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-blind, multicenter 
intent-to-treat randomized clinical trial was conducted at the EDs of 4 major 
acute care hospitals in different districts of Hong Kong. In total, 1571 smokers 
18 years or older who presented at 4 major EDs between July 4, 2015, and March 
17, 2017, were randomized into an intervention group (n = 787) and a control 
group (n = 784).
INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group received brief advice (about 1 minute) and 
could choose their own quit schedules (immediate or progressive). The control 
group received a smoking cessation leaflet.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Follow-up visits were conducted at 1, 3, 6, and 12 
months. The primary outcome measure, by intent to treat, was biochemically 
validated abstinence at 6 months.
RESULTS: Participants (N = 1571) included 1381 men (87.9%); the mean (SD) age at 
baseline was 47.4 (16.4) years. Among participants who self-reported abstinence 
at 6 months, 50.3% (85 of 169) had biochemical validation by both an exhaled 
carbon monoxide test and a saliva cotinine test. Compared with the control 
group, the intervention group had statistically higher biochemically validated 
abstinence at 6 months: 6.7% (53 of 787) vs 2.8% (22 of 784) (P < .001), with an 
adjusted relative risk of 3.21 (95% CI, 1.74-5.93; P < .001). The intervention 
group also had higher self-reported quit rates at 6 months (12.2% [96 of 787] vs 
9.3% [73 of 784], P = .04) and 12 months (13.0% [102 of 787] vs 8.5% [67 of 
784], P < .01), as well as higher biochemically validated abstinence at 12 
months (7.0% [55 of 787] vs 3.7% [29 of 784], P < .001). The additional cost for 
each intervention group participant was US $0.47, with an estimated gain of 
0.0238 quality-adjusted life-year. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted 
life-year (US $19.53) fell within acceptable thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This brief, low-cost self-determination theory-based 
intervention for smokers presenting at EDs effectively increased the 
biochemically validated quit rate at 6 months. If delivered routinely, such a 
simple intervention may offer a cost-effective and sustainable approach to help 
many smokers quit smoking.

IMPORTANCE: Traumatic digit amputation is the most common type of amputation 
injury, but the cost-effectiveness of its treatments is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of finger replantation compared with 
revision amputation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation was conducted using 
data from the Finger Replantation and Amputation Challenges in Assessing 
Impairment, Satisfaction, and Effectiveness (FRANCHISE), a retrospective, 
multicenter cohort study at 19 centers in the United States and Asia that 
enrolled participants from August 1, 2016, to April 12, 2018. Model variables 
were based on the FRANCHISE database, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 
and published literature. A total of 257 participants with unilateral traumatic 
finger amputations treated with revision amputation or replantation distal to 
the metacarpophalangeal joint and at least 1 year of follow-up after treatment 
were included in the analysis.
EXPOSURES: Revision amputation or replantation of traumatic finger amputations.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcome measures were quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs), total costs (in US dollars), and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). A willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 
per QALY was used to assess cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Of the 257 study participants (mean [SD] age, 46.7 [15.9] years; 221 
[86.0%] male), 178 underwent finger replantation and 79 underwent revision 
amputation. In a base case of a 46.7-year-old patient, replantation was 
associated with QALY gains of 0.30 (95% credible interval [CrI], -0.72 to 1.38) 
for single-finger (not thumb), 0.39 (95% CrI, -1.00 to 1.90) for thumb, 1.69 
(95% CrI, -0.13 to 3.76) for multifinger excluding thumb, and 1.27 (95% CrI, 
-2.21 to 5.04) for multifinger including thumb injury patterns. Corresponding 
ICERs for replantation compared with revision amputation were $99 157 per QALY 
for single-finger (not thumb), $66 278 per QALY for thumb, $18 388 per QALY for 
multifinger excluding thumb, and $21 528 per QALY for multifinger including 
thumb injury patterns. Sensitivity analysis revealed that age at time of injury, 
life expectancy, postinjury utility, wages, and time off work for recovery had 
the strongest associations with cost-effectiveness. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis revealed the following chances of replantation being cost-effective: 
47% in single-finger (not thumb), 52% in thumb, 78% in multifinger excluding 
thumb, and 64% in multifinger including thumb injury patterns.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: With proper patient selection, replantation of all 
finger amputation patterns, whether single-finger or multifinger injuries, may 
be cost-effective compared with revision amputation. Multifinger replantations 
had a higher probability of being cost-effective than single-finger 
replantations. Cost-effectiveness may depend on injury pattern and patient 
factors and thus appears to be important for consideration when patients and 
surgeons are deciding whether to replant or amputate.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically review all published cost-effectiveness analyses 
(CEAs) of imaging technologies in children.
METHODS: We identified all CEAs involving fetal and pediatric imaging included 
in a publicly available repository of CEAs published since 1976. Information on 
publication characteristics, methods, costs, quality of life weights, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) was recorded for each article.
RESULTS: Of 480 diagnostic CEAs, only 10 focused on fetal and pediatric imaging. 
The 10 studies reported 43 quality of life weights based on previously published 
adult data (n = 20, 46.5%); pregnant women perspective (n = 11, 25.6%), and 
treating physician perspective (n = 12, 27.9%). None of the studies elicited 
quality of life weights from children nor took into consideration the postnatal 
impact of disease on family's quality of life. All studies used a health care 
payer perspective without incorporating patients' incurred cost such as loss 
wages or travel related cost. Of 37 ICERs, 7 (18.9%) were cost saving and 6 
(16.2%) were more expensive and less effective. The remaining ICERs ranged from 
$1,400 per quality-adjusted life-year (MRI versus ultrasound in newborns with 
moderate risk of occult spinal dysraphism) to $10,000,000 per quality-adjusted 
life-year (CT versus no imaging in children at low risk for craniosynostosis).
CONCLUSION: There is a striking paucity of cost-effectiveness studies evaluating 
imaging technologies in children. Existing studies do not incorporate the 
patient and family perspectives regarding utilities (eg, impact of child's 
disease on families' quality of life) or cost (eg, loss wages, travel, time 
off). Future studies should elicit and incorporate the impact of disease on 
families to better reflect real-world scenarios.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The popular sense of the word "cure" implies that a patient 
treated for a specific disease will return to have the same life expectancy as 
if he/she had never had the disease. In analytic terms, it translates into the 
concept of statistical cure which occurs when a group of patients returns to 
having similar mortality to a reference population. The aim of this study was to 
assess the probability of being cured from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by 
hepatic resection.
METHODS: Data from 2,523 patients undergoing resection for HCC were used to fit 
statistical cure models, to compare disease-free survival (DFS) after surgery to 
the survival expected for patients with chronic hepatitis and/or cirrhosis and 
the general population, matched by sex, age, race/ethnicity and year of 
diagnosis.
RESULTS: The probability of resection enabling patients with HCC to achieve the 
same life expectancy as those with chronic hepatitis and/or cirrhosis was 26.3%. 
The conditional probability of achieving this result was time-dependent, 
requiring about 8.9 years to be accomplished with 95% certainty. Considering the 
general population as a reference, the cure fraction decreased to 17.1%. Uncured 
patients had a median DFS of 1.5 years. In multivariable analysis, patient's age 
and the risk of early HCC recurrence (within 2 years) were independent 
determinants of the chance of cure (p <0.001). The chances of being cured ranged 
between 36.0% for individuals at low risk of early recurrence to approximately 
3.6% for those at high risk.
CONCLUSION: Estimates of the chance of being cured of HCC by resection showed 
that cure is achievable, and its likelihood increases with the passing of 
recurrence-free time. The data presented herein can be used to inform decision 
making and to provide patients with accurate information.
LAY SUMMARY: Data from 2,523 patients who underwent resection for hepatocellular 
carcinoma were used to estimate the probability that resection would enable 
treated patients to achieve the same life expectancy as patients with chronic 
hepatitis and/or cirrhosis, and the general population. Herein, the cure model 
suggests that in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, resection can enable 
patients to achieve the same life expectancy as those with chronic liver disease 
in 26.3% of cases and as the general population in 17.1% of cases.

Worldwide life expectancy has increased dramatically in recent years. Also on 
the rise are incidents of pathologies related to aging, such as Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's Disease (AD). An inaccurate diagnosis impairs 
the well-being and the quality of life of patients and their relatives, as well 
as being a financial burden on the health system. Continued education pertaining 
to the neuropsychological field is uncommon for health workers involved in 
general practice. This article aims to present the process of development and 
content validity of the "CENEES Program - Psychoeducation for Health Staff on 
The Neuropsychology of Aging". The CENEES Program was developed in six steps 
which include: literature review, first draft, focal group, adjustments after 
focal group, judgment analysis (n = 4), and finally the last version. The 
inter-rater reliability index after judgment analysis was 0.785. The final 
version of the CENEES Program contains eight meetings, divided into 4 modules: 
1) Fundamentals of Neuroscience; 2) Memory; 3) Executive Functions; and 4) 
Communication. The final meeting was called "Review". The CENEES Program is a 
new resource to help professionals who work within the general practice field, 
especially community health workers. As far as we know, there is no 
psychoeducation program on aging which contains the four subjects that are 
covered in the CENEES Program. The CENEES Program could assist the workers' 
daily activities and make them comfortable to offer and build actions in the 
community. A pilot and follow-up studies are suggested.

BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C is a major public health burden. With new 
interferon-free direct-acting agents (showing sustained viral response rates of 
more than 98%), elimination of HCV seems feasible for the first time. However, 
as HCV infection often remains undiagnosed, screening is crucial for improving 
health outcomes of HCV-patients. Our aim was to assess the long-term 
cost-effectiveness of a nationwide screening strategy in Germany.
METHODS: We used a Markov cohort model to simulate disease progression and 
examine long-term population outcomes, HCV associated costs and 
cost-effectiveness of HCV screening. The model divides the total population into 
three subpopulations: general population (GEP), people who inject drugs (PWID) 
and HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM), with total infection numbers 
being highest in GEP, but new infections occurring only in PWIDs and MSM. The 
model compares four alternative screening strategies (no/basic/advanced/total 
screening) differing in participation and treatment rates.
RESULTS: Total number of HCV-infected patients declined from 275,000 in 2015 to 
between 125,000 (no screening) and 14,000 (total screening) in 2040. Similarly, 
lost quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were 320,000 QALYs lower, while costs 
were 2.4 billion EUR higher in total screening compared to no screening. While 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) increased sharply in GEP and MSM 
with more comprehensive strategies (30,000 EUR per QALY for total vs. advanced 
screening), ICER decreased in PWIDs (30 EUR per QALY for total vs. advanced 
screening).
CONCLUSIONS: Screening is key to have an efficient decline of the HCV-infected 
population in Germany. Recommendation for an overall population screening is to 
screen the total PWID subpopulation, and to apply less comprehensive advanced 
screening for MSM and GEP.

Social media are an ever-present part of daily life and for researchers and may 
be a useful platform to increase potential participant pools for Web-based 
surveys. Although survey usage to evaluate practices in the equine community is 
not new, the use of social media to advertise and enhance the usage of Web-based 
surveys is novel. In 2018, the University of Minnesota (UMN) equine Extension 
program developed and administered two Web-based surveys through the UMN equine 
Extension Facebook page and monthly e-newsletter. Surveys focused on industry 
practices and motivating factors behind the usage of hay nets and methods to 
provide water in the winter to horses. Two thousand eighty-eight participants 
started the hay net survey with a completion rate of 96%, whereas the winter 
water survey had a completion rate of 94%, with 930 participants starting the 
survey. Participant demographics aligned with previous survey populations and 
represented all regions of the United States. Both surveys revealed information, 
which described current industry practices as well as future research needs. In 
addition, participants were asked if scientific research would impact future 
decision-making in regards to equine management. When exploring hay net 
practices, most participants responded "maybe" (48%, n = 527), whereas for the 
winter water survey, the majority responded "yes" (68%, n = 877). Web-based 
surveys administered through social media present multiple benefits, including 
savings of both cost and labor, compared with traditional mailed surveys. 
Despite the success observed with the present surveys, this methodology may not 
be suitable for organizations with limited social media followers.

Patients with ESKD who would benefit from a kidney transplant face a critical 
and continuing shortage of kidneys from deceased human donors. As a result, such 
patients wait a median of 3.9 years to receive a donor kidney, by which time 
approximately 35% of transplant candidates have died while waiting or have been 
removed from the waiting list. Those of blood group B or O may experience a 
significantly longer waiting period. This problem could be resolved if kidneys 
from genetically engineered pigs offered an alternative with an acceptable 
clinical outcome. Attempts to accomplish this have followed two major paths: 
deletion of pig xenoantigens, as well as insertion of "protective" human 
transgenes to counter the human immune response. Pigs with up to nine genetic 
manipulations are now available. In nonhuman primates, administering novel 
agents that block the CD40/CD154 costimulation pathway, such as an anti-CD40 
mAb, suppresses the adaptive immune response, leading to pig kidney graft 
survival of many months without features of rejection (experiments were 
terminated for infectious complications). In the absence of innate and adaptive 
immune responses, the transplanted pig kidneys have generally displayed 
excellent function. A clinical trial is anticipated within 2 years. We suggest 
that it would be ethical to offer a pig kidney transplant to selected patients 
who have a life expectancy shorter than the time it would take for them to 
obtain a kidney from a deceased human donor. In the future, the pigs will also 
be genetically engineered to control the adaptive immune response, thus enabling 
exogenous immunosuppressive therapy to be significantly reduced or eliminated.

The ClpP protease is found in all kingdoms of life, from bacteria to humans. In 
general, this protease forms a homo-oligomeric complex composed of 14 identical 
subunits, which associates with its cognate ATPase in a symmetrical manner. Here 
we show that, in contrast to this general architecture, the Clp protease from 
Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm) forms an asymmetric hetero-oligomeric complex 
ClpP1P2, which only associates with its cognate ATPase through the ClpP2 ring. 
Our structural and functional characterisation of this complex demonstrates that 
asymmetric docking of the ATPase component is controlled by both the composition 
of the ClpP1 hydrophobic pocket (Hp) and the presence of a unique C-terminal 
extension in ClpP1 that guards this Hp. Our structural analysis of MsmClpP1 also 
revealed openings in the side-walls of the inactive tetradecamer, which may 
represent sites for product egress.

Benefits of whole grains as dietary supplements and active ingredients in health 
products have been promoted. Despite being neglected as an agricultural 
byproduct of polished rice, pigmented rice bran has emerged as a promising 
source of natural anti-aging compounds. Indeed, the extract of red rice bran Hom 
Dang cultivar contained rich phenolic acids and flavonoids. It displayed high 
antioxidant activities in vitro and in vivo assays. Using yeast model, extract 
and bioactive compounds, quercetin and protocatechuic acid found in the rice 
bran pericarp, effectively reduced levels of intracellular reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), restored plasma membrane damages and prolonged life-span of 
pre-treated wild-yeast cells. Importantly, these molecules modulated life 
span-extension through a mechanism of ROS reduction that resembles to that 
operated under the highly conserved Tor1- and Sir2-dependent signaling pathways, 
with the human homologs TORC1 and SIRT1, respectively. The key longevity factors 
Sch9 and Rim15 kinases, Msn2/4 regulators and a novel transcription factor Asg1, 
the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutases and glutathione peroxidases played 
important role in mediating longevity. Yeast clearly provides an instrumental 
platform for rapid screening of compounds with anti-aging efficacies and 
advances knowledge in the molecular study of ageing.

BACKGROUND: Restricting price promotions on unhealthy foods and beverages has 
been identified by governments as a promising approach for improving population 
diets. Using a limited societal perspective, this study assessed the potential 
cost-effectiveness of mandatory restrictions on price promotions for 
sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in Australia.
METHODS: Australian dietary consumption data, together with UK data on the SSB 
sales uplift associated with price promotions, were used to estimate reductions 
in SSB purchases and consequent changes in body mass index following the 
intervention. A multi-state, multiple-cohort Markov model was used to estimate 
the obesity-related health and cost impacts over the lifetime of the 2010 
Australian population. Costs included passing legislation, assisting retailer 
implementation, and compliance monitoring.
RESULTS: The intervention was estimated to result in a mean change in daily 
energy intake of -12.52 kJ (95% Uncertainty Interval, UI: -15.91 to -9.58) per 
person, which translated to a mean body weight change of -0.11 kg (95%UI: -0.14 
to -0.08) per person. Total Health Adjusted Life Years gained were estimated at 
34,260 (95%UI: 24,922-45,504). Estimated costs were AUD17.0 million, with 
estimated healthcare cost savings of AUD376.0 million. The intervention was 
considered dominant (cost-saving and health promoting). The intervention 
remained cost-effective if retailers reduced average non-discounted SSB prices 
in response to the intervention by less than 5.36%.
CONCLUSIONS: Restricting price promotions on SSBs is likely to be highly 
cost-effective, although its impact would depend on how industry and shoppers 
respond. Although Australian data are used, these results are likely to be 
transferable and highly relevant to the UK context. Policies for restricting 
price promotions should be considered as part of a comprehensive obesity 
prevention strategy.

People with severe mental illness have significantly reduced life expectancy and 
higher risk of cardiovascular diseases than the general population. There is a 
critical need for quality physical health care to improve consumers' health 
outcomes. There is minimal knowledge, however, on the impact of mental health 
nurse practitioner candidate (NPC) practices on consumers' health outcomes. The 
aim of this proof-of-concept study was to describe the impacts of NPC practices 
on the quality of physical healthcare provision and physical health outcomes 
(cardiovascular and cardiometabolic) of consumers in community mental health 
service settings. Using a mixed methods design, quantitative data were collected 
for 12 months prior to (Period 1), and 12 months during (Period 2), the 
candidacy period. Qualitative interviews were conducted with a purposive sample 
of n = 10 consumers to explore their perspectives on physical healthcare 
provision by the NPCs. During the 12-month candidacy period, the number of 
metabolic monitoring assessments rose from n = 55 in Period 1 to n = 146 in 
Period 2 (P < 0.01, χ2  = 41.20). Advanced practices provided by NPCs included 
taking an extensive holistic history and clinical examination, ordering 
diagnostic pathology, and clinical simulation of physical health medication 
prescription (under medical supervision). Analysis of consumer interviews 
resulted in two themes: (i) positive and helpful NPC health care and (ii) 
improvements in physical and mental health. The findings add new knowledge on 
specialist mental health nurse practitioner candidate roles and demonstrate the 
benefits these roles can have in reducing the significant morbidity and 
mortality of mental health consumers.

With the onset of a metabolic syndrome epidemic and the increasing life 
expectancy, erectile dysfunction (ED) has become a more common condition. As 
incidence and prevalence increase, the medical field is focused on providing 
more appropriate therapies. It is common knowledge that ED is a chronic 
condition that is also associated with a myriad of other disorders. Conditions 
such as aging, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, prostatic hypertrophy, 
and prostate cancer, among others, have a direct implication on the onset and 
progression of ED. Characterization and recognition of risk factors may help 
clinicians recognize and properly treat patients suffering from ED. One of the 
most reliable treatments for ED is penile prosthetic surgery. Since the 
introduction of the penile prosthesis (PP) in the early seventies, this surgical 
procedure has improved the lives of thousands of men, with reliable and 
satisfactory results. The aim of this review article is to characterize the 
epidemiology of men undergoing penile prosthetic surgery, with a discussion 
about the most common conditions involved in the development of ED, and that 
ultimately drive patients into electing to undergo PP placement.

The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic effects of fat grafting on 
radiation-induced hind limb contracture. Radiation therapy (RT) is used to 
palliate and/or cure a range of malignancies but causes inevitable and 
progressive fibrosis of surrounding soft tissue. Pathological fibrosis may lead 
to painful contractures which limit movement and negatively impact quality of 
life. Fat grafting is able to reduce and/or reverse radiation-induced soft 
tissue fibrosis. We explored whether fat grafting could improve extensibility in 
irradiated and contracted hind limbs of mice. Right hind limbs of female 
60-day-old CD-1 nude mice were irradiated. Chronic skin fibrosis and limb 
contracture developed. After 4 weeks, irradiated hind limbs were then injected 
with (a) fat enriched with stromal vascular cells (SVCs), (b) fat only, (c) 
saline, or (d) nothing (n = 10/group). Limb extension was measured at baseline 
and every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Hind limb skin then underwent histological 
analysis and biomechanical strength testing. Irradiation significantly reduced 
limb extension but was progressively rescued by fat grafting. Fat grafting also 
reduced skin stiffness and reversed the radiation-induced histological changes 
in the skin. The greatest benefits were found in mice injected with fat enriched 
with SVCs. Hind limb radiation induces contracture in our mouse model which can 
be improved with fat grafting. Enriching fat with SVCs enhances these beneficial 
effects. These results underscore an attractive approach to address challenging 
soft tissue fibrosis in patients following RT.

Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) aimed at increasing the life 
expectancy for diabetic patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, 
the risks of surgery complications and immunosuppression therapy make it unclear 
if the SPKT positively impacts patient's quality of life (QoL). Using the Kidney 
Disease Quality of Life-Short-Form Health Survey (KDQOL-SF36) and Problems Areas 
in Diabetes (PAID) measurement tools, we compared the QoL of 57 patients on the 
pretransplant waiting list with that of 103 patients who had undergone SPKT. 
Posttransplantation patients were assessed within different time intervals (<1, 
1-3, and >3 years). Mean KDQOL-SF36 scores were better among posttransplantation 
patients in the SF36 and KDQOL domains. It was also observed patients' stress 
reduction in PAID mean score (P = 0.011) after SPKT. We concluded that patients 
receiving SPKT had a better perception of QoL than did patients on the waiting 
list, and this positive perception remained almost entirely comparable over the 
three different intervals of the posttransplantation time. These positive 
results showed better outcomes when excluding patients that lost pancreas graft 
function. Further research is needed to compare diabetic patients with kidney 
transplant alone using specific measurement tools to evaluate patient's QoL.

All-cause mortality rates in rural areas have exceeded those in urban areas of 
the US since the 1980s, and the gap continues to widen. Yet no definitive causes 
of this difference are known, and within-state differences that might be 
amenable to state-level policy have not been explored. An analysis of 2016 
state-level data indicated that rural mortality exceeded urban mortality in all 
but three states, with substantial variability in both rates across states. 
Overall, higher rural mortality at the state level can be mainly explained by 
three factors: socioeconomic deprivation, physician shortages, and lack of 
health insurance. To a certain degree, these factors reflect a state's health 
policies, such as expansion of eligibility for Medicaid, health infrastructure, 
and socioeconomic conditions. Our findings suggest that state and federal policy 
efforts to address rural-urban disparities in these areas could alleviate the 
higher rates of all-cause mortality faced by rural US residents.

Malectin is a maltose-binding endoplasmic reticulum protein conserved in 
animals. In Arabidopsis thaliana, we identified four genes that encode 
malectin-like domain (MLD)- and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing proteins 
(AtMLLRs): two were receptor-like proteins (AtMLLR1 and 2) and the other two 
were extracellular proteins (AtMLLR3 and 4). The promoter:G3GFP+promoter:GUS 
assay indicated the organ- and cell-specific expression of the AtMLLR2 and 
AtMLLR3 genes.Abbreviations: Cmr: chloramphenicol-resistance marker; G3GFP: G3

The Dystrophinopathies.

Thangarajh M.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The dystrophinopathies are among the most common 
neuromuscular conditions, and they include Duchenne and Becker muscular 
dystrophies. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, 
genetic cause, management, and new and emerging therapies for this condition.
RECENT FINDINGS: New studies have highlighted how oral corticosteroids have 
changed the natural history of the disease, prolonging ambulation in boys with 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy and reducing the risk of developing scoliosis and 
subsequent surgical correction, improving cardiac health, and increasing 
long-term survival. Additionally, recent publications have provided insights 
into how newer and emerging treatment options are becoming more common for this 
condition. With gene therapy being approved in the United States for the severe 
form, the dystrophinopathies represent model diseases to understand the 
personalization of genetic treatment.
SUMMARY: Improvement in the standardization of care and the use of oral 
corticosteroids have increased the life expectancy of patients with 
dystrophinopathy and changed the natural history of the disease. This article 
presents a summary of clinical features, diagnostic testing, and new and 
emerging treatment strategies for the dystrophinopathies.

OBJECTIVE: Effective interventions to reduce the public health burden of 
HIV/AIDS can vary in their ability to deliver value at different levels of scale 
and in different epidemiological contexts. Our objective was to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of HIV treatment and prevention interventions implemented at 
previously documented scales of delivery in six US cities with diverse HIV 
microepidemics.
DESIGN: Dynamic HIV transmission model-based cost-effectiveness analysis.
METHODS: We identified and estimated previously documented scale of delivery and 
costs for 16 evidence-based interventions from the US CDC's Compendium of 
Evidence-Based Interventions and Best Practices for HIV Prevention. Using a 
model calibrated for Atlanta, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City and 
Seattle, we estimated averted HIV infections, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (healthcare perspective; 3% 
discount rate, 2018$US), for each intervention and city (10-year implementation) 
compared with the status quo over a 20-year time horizon.
RESULTS: Increased HIV testing was cost-saving or cost-effective across cities. 
Targeted preexposure prophylaxis for high-risk MSM was cost-saving in Miami and 
cost-effective in Atlanta ($6123/QALY), Baltimore ($18 333/QALY) and Los Angeles 
($86 117/QALY). Interventions designed to improve antiretroviral therapy 
initiation provided greater value than other treatment engagement interventions. 
No single intervention was projected to reduce HIV incidence by more than 10.1% 
in any city.
CONCLUSION: Combination implementation strategies should be tailored to local 
epidemiological contexts to provide the most value. Complementary strategies 
addressing factors hindering access to HIV care will be necessary to meet 
targets for HIV elimination in the United States.
