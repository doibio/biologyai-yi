Las técnicas diagnósticas actuales son muy precisas, pero presentan falsos 
positivos. Las distintas técnicas de medicina nuclear, en concreto la PET-TC con 
C11-metionina, suponen una ayuda diagnóstica. Con este caso se pretende llamar 
la atención sobre una de las complicaciones tardías de la radioterapia y los 
distintos diagnósticos diferenciales. Los avances diagnósticos y terapéuticos 
han aumentado la esperanza de vida de los pacientes oncológicos, con lo que 
estas complicaciones tardías se prevén más frecuentes.

BACKGROUND: After curative treatment of primary non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), patients undergo intensive surveillance with the aim to detect 
recurrences from the primary tumor or metachronous second primary lung cancer as 
early as possible and improve overall survival. However, the benefit of 
surveillance is debated. Available evidence is of low quality and conflicting. 
Microsimulation modeling facilitates the exploration of the impact of different 
surveillance strategies and provides insight into the cost-effectiveness of 
surveillance.
METHODS: A microsimulation model was used to simulate a range of computed 
tomography (CT)-based surveillance schedules, differing in the frequency and 
duration of CT surveillance. The impact on survival, quality-adjusted 
life-years, costs, and cost-effectiveness of each schedule was assessed.
RESULTS: Ten of 108 strategies formed the cost-effectiveness frontier; that is, 
these were the strategies with the optimal cost-health benefit balance. Per 
person, the discounted QALYs of these strategies varied between 5.72 and 5.81 y, 
and discounted costs varied between €9892 and €19,259. Below a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of €50,000/QALY, no scanning is the preferred 
option. For a willingness-to-pay threshold of €80,000/QALY, surveillance 
scanning every 2 y starting 1 y after curative treatment becomes the best 
option, with €11,860 discounted costs and 5.76 discounted QALYs per person. The 
European Society for Medical Oncology guideline strategy was more expensive and 
less effective than several other strategies.
CONCLUSION: Model simulations suggest that limited CT surveillance scanning 
after the treatment of primary NSCLC is cost-effective, but the incremental 
health-benefit remains marginal. However, model simulations do suggest that the 
guideline strategy is not cost-effective.

Humans survive and thrive through social exchange. Yet, social dependency also 
comes at a cost. Perceived social isolation, or loneliness, affects physical and 
mental health, cognitive performance, overall life expectancy, and 
increases vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease-related dementias. Despite severe 
consequences on behavior and health, the neural basis of loneliness remains 
elusive. Using the UK Biobank population imaging-genetics cohort (n = ~40,000, 
aged 40-69 years when recruited, mean age = 54.9), we test for signatures of 
loneliness in grey matter morphology, intrinsic functional coupling, and fiber 
tract microstructure. The loneliness-linked neurobiological profiles converge on 
a collection of brain regions known as the 'default network'. This higher 
associative network shows more consistent loneliness associations in grey matter 
volume than other cortical brain networks. Lonely individuals display stronger 
functional communication in the default network, and greater microstructural 
integrity of its fornix pathway. The findings fit with the possibility that the 
up-regulation of these neural circuits supports mentalizing, reminiscence and 
imagination to fill the social void.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic disease caused by expanded CAG repeat 
tract in exon 1 of the HTT gene that codes for huntingtin. Since the first 
symptoms of the disease the average life expectancy is 15-20 years, when the 
symptoms resulting from neurodegeneration are progressing. Therefore, there is a 
great demand for an effective HD treatment method. Various therapeutic 
strategies are being developed based on mechanisms of gene expression silencing, 
including DNA editing techniques. Here, we present the most important currently 
tested approaches, with particular emphasis on strategies based on the use of 
antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), RNA interference (RNAi) technology and 
CRISPR-Cas9. Currently ongoing clinical trials as well as different 
pharmacological agents are discussed.

Following the announcement of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Wuhan 
on 31 December 2019, government officials in Hong Kong recommended the wearing 
of face masks as a public infection control measure against the COVID-19 virus 
and curtail the impact of the concurrent influenza season. The present study 
evaluated the influenza-related outcomes between the influenza season 2019 and 
2020 in Hong Kong as a result of these infection control measures. A Monte Carlo 
simulation model was designed to estimate the number of influenza cases, clinic 
visits, hospitalization, deaths, direct medical cost and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) for the season 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 in six age groups: 
0-5 years, 6-11 years, 12-17 years, 18-49 years, 50-64 years and ≥65 years in 
Hong Kong. Model inputs were derived from public data and existing literature. 
The model findings showed significant reduction in influenza-related cases, 
clinic visits, hospitalization, and deaths in 2020 versus 2019 (p < 0.05). 
Influenza-related direct costs in all age-groups were significantly reduced by 
56%-82% (p < 0.01) in 2020 versus 2019. DALYs were also significantly decreased 
by 58%-85% (p < 0.01). The direct cost and DALYs avoided in 2020 was the highest 
among the age group of 0-5 years with a cost-saving of USD593,763 (95%CI 
590,730-596,796) per 10,000 population and a DALY reduction of 57.67 (95%CI 
57.54-57.83) per 10,000 population. This study illustrated the reduction of all 
influenza-related outcome measures in Hong Kong as a result of the 
implementation of public infection control measures against COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) is a process that supports adults in 
understanding and sharing their personal values, life goals, and preferences 
regarding future medical care. We examined the current status of ACP and 
end-of-life (EOL) communication between oncologists and patients with metastatic 
breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a survey among 41 institutions that 
specialize in oncology by using an online tool in October 2019. Participants 
(118 physicians) from 38 institutions completed a 39-item questionnaire that 
measured facility type and function; physicians' background and clinical 
approach, education about EOL communication, and understanding about ACP; and 
the current situation of ACP and EOL discussions.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight responses concerning physicians' engagement in ACP with 
patients were obtained. Seventy-one (72%) answered that they had engaged in ACP. 
Among these, 23 (33%) physicians used a structured format to facilitate the 
conversation in their institutions, and only 6 (8%) settled triggers or sentinel 
events for the initiation of ACP. In the multivariable analysis, only the 
opportunity to learn communication skills was associated with physicians' 
engagement with ACP (odds ratio: 2.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-7.0). The 
frequency and timing of communication about ACP and EOL care with patients 
substantially varied among the oncologists. Communication about patients' life 
expectancy was less frequent compared with other topics.
CONCLUSION: The opportunity to improve EOL communication skills promoted 
physicians' engagement with ACP among patients with metastatic/advanced breast 
cancer. However, there were still substantial variabilities in the method, 
frequency, and timing of ACP and EOL communication among the oncologists.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study found that the opportunity to improve 
end-of-life (EOL) communication skills promoted physicians' engagement in 
advance care planning (ACP) among patients with metastatic/advanced breast 
cancer. All oncologists who treat said patients are encouraged to participate in 
effective education programs concerning EOL communication skills. In clinical 
practice, there are substantial variabilities in the method, frequency, and 
timing of ACP and EOL communication among oncologists. As recommended in several 
clinical guidelines, the authors suggest a system that identifies patients who 
require conversations about their care goals, a structured format to facilitate 
the conversations, and continuous measurement for improving EOL care and 
treatment.

Life expectancy has increased in many countries throughout the world over recent 
years, leading to new challenges related to aging. A large part of the 
population is over 60 years old, and therefore studies that focus on financial 
autonomy and active aging are necessary. In this paper, we analyze the 
relationship between cognitive functioning and life satisfaction in relation to 
financial attitudes in a sample of 251 elderly adults (71% women) participating 
in an active aging program (M = 67.5, SD = 4.5). We used the Mini-Mental State 
Examination, the Satisfaction with Life scale, and a questionnaire about 
financial attitudes to gather data. Our results show that cognitive functioning 
and life satisfaction are related to certain financial attitudes. We also 
observed differences associated with gender, education level, and financial 
independence. According to our findings, life satisfaction should be taken into 
account when the financial attitudes of older adults are evaluated. The 
importance of support groups for the elderly is highlighted as well as of all 
those recreation and health programs, since they constitute a means of promoting 
well-being.

Cachexia (CC) is a devastating metabolic syndrome associated with a series of 
underlying diseases that greatly affects life quality and expectancy among 
cancer patients. Studies involving mouse models, in which CC was induced through 
inoculation with tumor cells, originally suggested the existence of a direct 
correlation between the development of this syndrome and changes in the relative 
proportions of several bacterial groups present in the digestive tract. However, 
these analyses have focus solely on the characterization of bacterial dysbiosis, 
ignoring the possible existence of changes in the relative populations of fungi, 
during the development of CC. Thus, the present study sought to expand such 
analyses, by characterizing changes that occur in the gut fungal population 
(mycobiota) of mice, during the development of cancer-induced cachexia. Our 
results confirm that cachectic animals, submitted to Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) 
transplantation, display significant differences in their gut mycobiota, when 
compared to healthy controls. Moreover, identification of dysbiotic fungi showed 
remarkable consistency across successive levels of taxonomic hierarchy. Many of 
these fungi have also been associated with dysbioses observed in a series of gut 
inflammatory diseases, such as obesity, colorectal cancer (CRC), myalgic 
encephalomyelitis (ME) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nonetheless, the 
dysbiosis verified in the LLC model of cancer cachexia seems to be unique, 
presenting features observed in both obesity (reduced proportion of 
Mucoromycota) and CRC/ME/IBD (increased proportions of Sordariomycetes, 
Saccharomycetaceae and Malassezia). One species of Mucoromycota (Rhyzopus 
oryzae) stands out as a promising probiotic candidate in adjuvant therapies, 
aimed at treating and/or preventing the development of CC.

The introduction of antifungals in clinical practice has an enormous impact on 
the provision of medical care, increasing the expectancy and quality of life 
mainly of immunocompromised patients. However, the emergence of pathogenic fungi 
that are resistant and multi-resistant to the existing antifungal therapy has 
culminated in fungal infections that are almost impossible to treat. Therefore, 
there is an urgent need to discover new strategies. The marine environment has 
proven to be a promising rich resource for the discovery and development of new 
antifungal compounds. Thus, this review summarizes more than one hundred marine 
natural products, or their derivatives, which are categorized according to their 
sources-sponges, bacteria, fungi, and sea cucumbers-as potential candidates as 
antifungal agents. In addition, this review focus on recent developments using 
marine antifungal compounds as new and effective approaches for the treatment of 
infections caused by resistant and multi-resistant pathogenic fungi and/or 
biofilm formation; other perspectives on antifungal marine products highlight 
new mechanisms of action, the combination of antifungal and non-antifungal 
agents, and the use of nanoparticles and anti-virulence therapy.

[Aplastic anaemia].

[Article in Norwegian]

Hagestande S, Kvam AK, Lothe IMB, Gjelberg HK, Bruserud Ø, Tvedt THA.

Aplastic anaemia is a rare form of bone marrow failure characterised by loss of 
haematopoietic stem cells, bone marrow suppression and insufficient production 
of blood cells. If left untreated, the condition is very serious with short life 
expectancy, but a large proportion of patients recover with the aid of 
immunosuppression or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

AIMS: This report reviews major laws, acts and regulations of social benefits 
and services for individuals with disabilities, focusing on cerebral palsy in 
the five Nordic countries. It summarizes the available benefits and services and 
the re-application process and provides comparative analyses among the 
countries.
METHODS: Published reports, articles and relevant government and municipal 
websites were reviewed for each respective country and used to compile an 
overview and comparison between the countries.
RESULTS: In the Nordic countries, there are a number of laws and regulations in 
place to support individuals with cerebral palsy and their families. In 
addition, there are numerous social benefits available for which individuals 
with disabilities can apply. Although there are national differences, the 
similarities across the five countries regarding laws, social benefits offered 
for individuals with cerebral palsy and the application processes are clear. 
However, the application processes seem cumbersome and, at times, redundant. 
Physicians and other healthcare specialists repeatedly need to write 'medical 
certificates' describing the diagnosis and its consequences for a disability 
that is chronic and lifelong.
CONCLUSIONS: Participation in society for individuals with cerebral palsy 
disabilities can be enabled by social benefits. By extension, social benefits 
may indirectly have implications for public health in individuals with 
disabilities. Although the lives of individuals with cerebral palsy - as with 
others - can improve in certain areas, the need for social benefits will 
generally increase, not decrease, over time. Although it is clearly important to 
have checks and balances that prevent system misuse, it might be worthwhile from 
a cost-benefit perspective to investigate whether the current systems could be 
improved to better manage time and resources and avoid emotional distress by

BACKGROUND: Trait boredom is associated with several internalizing and 
externalizing problems. Addressing existing research gaps in the field, the 
present study investigated the map of cognitive processes for boredom, based on 
the rational emotive behaviour therapy model (REBT).
AIMS: The general aim of the study was to investigate the organization of 
irrational and rational evaluative cognitions related to boredom, and the 
association between boredom and depression symptoms and state/trait anxiety.
METHODS: The 233 participants (84% women) completed online scales of evaluative 
cognitions, trait boredom, trait/state anxiety and depression. Multiple 
mediation models via the SPSS extension PROCESS were employed.
RESULTS: The REBT psychopathology and psychological health models were partially 
confirmed, as the evaluative primary cognitions predicted positively and 
significantly the secondary ones in both cases. Low frustration tolerance (LFT) 
and global evaluations (GE), and frustration tolerance (FT), respectively, had 
significant effects. We found a positive significant association between boredom 
proneness and the negative dysfunctional emotions investigated.
CONCLUSIONS: Both results offer further support for the hierarchy of cognitions 
and the distinction between the level of irrationality and rationality in REBT. 
This is the first attempt to assess a cognitive map of boredom, underlining the 
importance of (L)FT in relation to boredom. The significance of GE in boredom 
suggests that people might see themselves responsible, or even blame themselves, 
others or life itself while bored. The associations of boredom with anxiety and 
depression are relevant, as its role in those contexts is not yet fully 
understood.

The effect of repetitive training on learned behavior has been an important 
subject in neuroscience. In instrumental conditioning in mammals, learned action 
early in training is often goal-driven and controlled by outcome expectancy, but 
as training progresses, it becomes more habitual and insensitive to outcome 
devaluation. Similarly, we recently showed in Pavlovian conditioning in crickets 
(Gryllus bimaculatus) that a conditioned response (CR) is initially sensitive to 
devaluation of the unconditioned stimulus but becomes insensitive to it after 
extended training. It is known that habitual responses after extended 
instrumental training are characterized by a higher context specificity than are 
initial goal-directed actions in mammals. In this study, we investigated whether 
this is applicable to Pavlovian conditioning in crickets. In crickets that 
received a standard amount of training to associate an odor with water reward 
under illumination, CR under illumination was stronger than that in the dark. In 
crickets that received extended training under illumination, on the other hand, 
the level of CR did not differ in different light conditions. Further 
experiments confirmed that context specificity decreases with the development of 
behavioral automaticity by extended training, as opposed to findings in 
instrumental training in mammals. We conclude that the nature of habitual 
behaviors after extended training differs in different learning systems of 
animals.

Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), the most severe form of T-cell 
immunodeficiency, can be screened at birth by quantifying T-cell receptor 
excision circles (TREC) in dried blood spot (DBS) samples. Early detection of 
this condition speeds up the establishment of appropriate treatment and 
increases the patient's life expectancy. Newborn screening for SCID started in 
January 2017 in Catalonia, the first Spanish and European region to universally 
include this testing. The results obtained in the first three years and a half 
of experience (January 2017 - June 2020) are shown here, using EnLite Neonatal 
TREC kit (Perkin Elmer) with 20 copies/µL as TREC detection cutoff. Of 222,857 
newborns screened, 48 tested positive: three patients were diagnosed with SCID 
(incidence 1:74,285); 17 patients had clinically significant T-cell lymphopenia 
(non-SCID) with an incidence of 1 in 13,109 newborns; twenty two patients were 
considered false-positive cases because of an initially normal lymphocyte count 
with normalization of TREC between 3 and 6 months of life; one case had 
transient lymphopenia due to an initially low lymphocyte count with recovery in 
the following months; and five patients are still under study. The results 
obtained provide further evidence of the benefits of including this disease in 
newborn screening programs. Even longer follow-up could be necessary to define 
the exact incidence of SCID in Catalonia.

Publisher: La inmunodeficiencia combinada grave (IDCG) es la forma más grave de 
inmunodeficiencia primaria, que afecta sobre todo a los linfocitos T, y puede 
ser detectada al nacer mediante la cuantificación de los círculos de escisión 
del receptor de linfocitos T (TREC) en una muestra de sangre impregnada en papel 
(DBS). La detección precoz de esta enfermedad permite establecer de forma 
temprana un tratamiento adecuado en el paciente, permitiendo así su curación. El 
cribado neonatal de IDCG comenzó en Cataluña en enero de 2017, siendo la primera 
región española y europea en incluirla oficial y universalmente en su programa. 
En el presente trabajo se presentan los resultados obtenidos durante los tres 
primeros años y medio de experiencia (enero 2017 – junio 2020) empleando el kit 
EnLite Neonatal TREC (Perkin Elmer), con un cutoff de detección de TREC de 20 
copias/µL. De 222.857 recién nacidos analizados, cuarenta y ocho fueron 
detecciones positivas: tres casos de IDCG (incidencia de 1:74.285); diecisiete 
casos de linfopenia T no IDCG (incidencia de 1:13.109); veintidós casos falsos 
positivos (recuento de linfocitos inicialmente normal, con normalización de TREC 
entre los tres y seis meses de vida); un caso con linfopenia transitoria (con un 
recuento de linfocitos inicialmente bajo, que se normaliza en los meses 
siguientes); y cinco pacientes se encuentran todavía en estudio. Los resultados 
obtenidos aportan evidencias de los beneficios que supone incluir esta 
enfermedad en los programas de cribado neonatal. Podría ser necesario un 
seguimiento todavía más prolongado para acabar de definir la incidencia exacta 
de IDCG en Cataluña.

Aging is characterized by the decline and deterioration of functional cells and 
results in a wide variety of molecular damages and reduced physical and mental 
capacity. The knowledge on aging process is important because life expectancy is 
expected to rise until 2050. Aging cannot be considered a homogeneous process 
and includes different trajectories characterized by states of fitness, frailty, 
and disability. Frailty is a dynamic condition put between a normal functional 
state and disability, with reduced capacity to cope with stressors. This 
geriatric syndrome affects physical, neuropsychological, and social domains and 
is driven by emotional and spiritual components. Sarcopenia is considered one of 
the determinants and the biological substrates of physical frailty. Physical and 
cognitive frailty are separately approached during daily clinical practice. The 
concept of motoric cognitive syndrome has partially changed this scenario, 
opening interesting windows toward future approaches. Thus, the purpose of this 
manuscript is to provide an excursus on current clinical practice, enforced by 
aneddoctical cases. The analysis of the current state of the art seems to 
support the urgent need of comprehensive organizational model incorporating 
physical and cognitive spheres in the same umbrella.

BACKGROUND: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR amyloidosis) is a rare, 
genetically heterogenous, and clinically variable autosomal dominant disease 
that severely reduces life expectancy. As treatment options grow, a proper 
diagnostic approach is mandatory especially in non-endemic regions with diverse 
genetic backgrounds.
METHODS: We examined 102 neuropathy patients at a German neuromuscular centre. 
Common causes of polyneuropathy were ruled out by medical history and extensive 
laboratory testing to define a cohort of patients with progressive 
polyneuropathy classified as idiopathic. Molecular genetic testing of the entire 
TTR gene was performed, and the detected amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic 
variants were associated with the observed clinical phenotypes and results of 
prior diagnostic testing.
RESULTS: Two of 102 patients tested positive for amyloidogenic mutations 
(p.Ile127Val and p.Glu81Lys), while a variant of unknown significance, 
p.Glu26Ser, was found in 10 cases. In both positive cases, previous negative 
biopsy results were proved by gene sequencing to be false negative. In case of 
the p.Glu81Lys mutation we detected clinical presentation (combination of severe 
polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy), ethnic background (patient of polish origin, 
mutation only reported in Japanese families before), and disease course clearly 
differed from well-known cases of the same mutation in the literature.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, transthyretin hereditary amyloid polyneuropathy 
(ATTR-PN) should be considered in cases of otherwise idiopathic polyneuropathy. 
Sequencing of the four exons of the TTR gene should be considered the key step 
in diagnosis, while tissue biopsy possibly leads to false negative results.

Lifestyle habits and the risk factors of dementia: Evidence from Japan.

Chen F(1), Yoshida H(1).

Author information:

Japan.

AIM: In this study, we seek to empirically understand the relationship between 
lifestyle habits and dementia risk.
METHODS: Through an original online survey, we first confirm the significant 
difference in the dementia risk indicators between good and bad lifestyle 
habits. Then, using regression analysis to hold other factors equal, we examine 
the relationships between lifestyle habits and an aggregate dementia risk 
indicator.
RESULTS: Through the t-test results, we find that the average scores of dementia 
risk for respondents avoiding good habits and preferring bad habits are 
significantly higher than those of the respondents favoring good habits and 
avoiding bad habits. Our empirical findings showed that Japanese-style dietary 
habits significantly correlate with a decreased dementia risk. An additional 
1-point increase in eating habits will reduce dementia risk scores by 
0.148 points, on average. Furthermore, we also confirm that walking (more than 
three times per week) and watching TV (almost every day) help prevent dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that maintaining a good lifestyle helps prevent 
dementia. In particular, good eating habits, both in terms of types of food and 
eating routines, are essential to avoid the development of dementia. Most of 
these lifestyle habits belong to the targets of the "Health Japan 21" project. 
Therefore, our findings might provide some convincing evidence for promoting the 
project, which will not only extend healthy life expectancy, but also reduce the 
increasing number of older adults with dementia. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2021; 21:

Duchenne (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophies (BMD) are rare neuromuscular 
disorders caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene and failure in its protein 
production. The absence or the reduced expression of dystrophin render muscles 
prone to damage, including the cardiac and respiratory muscles with reduced life 
expectancy. Careful planning for clinical trials will require a sufficient 
number of confirmed cases to meet the inclusion criteria. National registries 
for rare disorders serve as an essential tool for personalized medicines or 
mutation-specific trials to facilitate patient recruitment. The Iranian Registry 
of DMD and BMD (IRDAB) collects detailed molecular data of Iranian DMD/BMD 
patients and carriers according to the TREAT-NMD Global Neuromuscular Network 
guidelines. As of March 2020, five hundred and twenty-two cases are registered. 
The registry incorporates multi-level web and database technologies, where 
registrants can access their data and compare it to the cumulative data. The 
registry's objectives are to recruit eligible patients for clinical trials and 
provide sufficient data for the national program of disease surveillance and 
social planning. Furthermore, the registry provides accurate epidemiological 
data, phenotype/genotype correlation, and evaluate the standards of care in 
Iran.

BACKGROUND: Despite the international endorsement of multidisciplinary tumor 
boards (MTBs) for breast cancer care, implementation is suboptimal worldwide, 
and evidence regarding their effectiveness in developing countries is lacking. 
We assessed the impact on survival and the cost-effectiveness of implementing an 
MTB in Mozambique, sub-Saharan Africa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 205 patients with 
breast cancer diagnosed between January 2015 and August 2017 (98 before and 107 
after MTB implementation), followed to November 2019. Pre- and post-MTB 
implementation subcohorts were compared for clinical characteristics, 
treatments, and overall survival. We used hazard ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI), computed by Cox proportional hazards regression. The impact of 
MTB implementation on the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was 
estimated from the provider perspective.
RESULTS: We found no significant differences between pre- and post-MTB 
subcohorts regarding clinical characteristics or treatments received. Among 
patients with early breast cancer (stage 0-III; n = 163), the 3-year overall 
survival was 48.0% (95% CI, 35.9-59.1) in the pre-MTB and 73.0% (95% CI, 
61.3-81.6) in the post-MTB subcohort; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.47 (95% CI, 
0.27-0.81). The absolute 3-year mean cost increase was $119.83 per patient, and 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $802.96 per QALY, corresponding to 
1.6 times the gross domestic product of Mozambique.
CONCLUSION: The implementation of a MTB in Mozambique led to a 53% mortality 
decrease among patients with early breast cancer, and it was cost-effective. 
These findings highlight the feasibility of implementing this strategy and the 
need for scaling-up MTBs in developing countries, as a way to improve patient 
outcomes.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Currently, more than half of the deaths from breast 
cancer in the world occur in developing countries. Strategies that optimize care 
and that are adjusted for available resources are needed to improve the outcomes 
of patients with breast cancer in these regions. The discussion of cases at 
multidisciplinary tumor boards (MTBs) may improve survival outcomes, but 
implementation is suboptimal worldwide, and evidence regarding their 
effectiveness in developing countries is lacking. This study evaluated the 
impact of implementing an MTB on the care and survival of patients with breast 
cancer in Mozambique, sub-Saharan Africa and its cost-effectiveness in this 
low-income setting.
