OBJECTIVES: Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) may provide useful data to inform 
management decisions depending on the robustness of a model's input parameters. 
We sought to determine the level of heterogeneity in health state utility 
values, transition probabilities, and cost estimates across published CEAs 
assessing primarily radiotherapeutic management strategies in prostate cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of prostate cancer CEAs indexed in 
MEDLINE between 2000 and 2018 comparing accepted treatment modalities across all 
cancer stages. Search terms included "cost effectiveness prostate," "prostate 
cancer cost model," "cost utility prostate," and "Markov AND prostate AND 
(cancer OR adenocarcinoma)." Included studies were agreed upon. A Markov model 
was designed using the parameter estimates from the systematic review to 
evaluate the effect of estimate heterogeneity on strategy cost acceptability.
RESULTS: Of 199 abstracts identified, 47 publications were reviewed and 37 were 
included; 508 model estimates were compared. Estimates varied widely across 
variables, including gastrointestinal toxicity risk (0%-49.5%), utility of 
metastatic disease (0.25-0.855), intensity-modulated radiotherapy cost ($21 
193-$61 996), and recurrence after external-beam radiotherapy (1.5%-59%). 
Multiple studies assumed that different radiotherapy modalities delivering the 
same dose yielded varying cancer control rates. When using base estimates for 
similar parameters from included studies, the designed model resulted in 3 
separate acceptability determinations.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant heterogeneity exists across parameter estimates used to 
perform CEAs evaluating treatment for prostate cancer. Heterogeneity across 
model inputs yields variable conclusions with respect to the favorability and 
cost-effectiveness of treatment options. Decision makers are cautioned to review 
estimates in CEAs to ensure they are up to date and relevant to setting and 
population.

OBJECTIVES: The ALIC4E trial has shown that oseltamivir reduces recovery time 
while increasing the risk of nausea. This secondary analysis of the ALIC4E trial 
aimed to determine the gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated 
with adding oseltamivir to usual primary care in patients presenting with 
influenza-like illness (ILI).
METHODS: Patients with ILI were recruited during the influenza season 
(2015-2018) in 15 European countries. Patients were assigned to usual care with 
or without oseltamivir through stratified randomization (age, severity, 
comorbidities, and symptom onset). Patients' health status was valued with the 
EQ-5D and visual analog scale (VAS) for up to 28 days. Average EQ-5D and VAS 
scores over time were estimated for both treatment groups using one-inflated 
beta regression in children (<13 years old) and adults (≥13 years old). QALY 
gain was calculated as the difference between the groups. Sensitivity analysis 
considered the value set to convert EQ-5D answers to summary scores and the 
follow-up period.
RESULTS: In adults, oseltamivir gained 0.0006 (95% confidence interval 
0.0002-0.0010) QALYs, whereas no statistically significant gain was found in 
children (14-day follow-up, EQ-5D). QALY gains were statistically significant in 
patients aged ≥65 years, patients without relevant comorbidities, or patients 
experiencing symptoms for ≤48 hours. Using VAS and accounting for 28-day 
follow-up resulted in higher QALY gain.
CONCLUSIONS: QALY gain owing to oseltamivir is limited compared with other 
diseases, and its clinical meaningfulness remains to be determined. Further 
analysis is needed to evaluate whether QALY gain and its impact on ILI treatment 
cost render oseltamivir cost-effective.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness, from a US 
commercial payer perspective, of cemiplimab versus other first-line treatments 
for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with programmed death-ligand 1 
expression ≥50%.
METHODS: A 30-year "partitioned survival" model was constructed. Overall 
survival and progression-free survival were estimated by applying time-varying 
hazard ratios from a network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. 
Overall survival and progression-free survival were estimated from EMPOWER-Lung 
1 (cemiplimab monotherapy vs chemotherapy) and KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-042 
(pembrolizumab monotherapy vs chemotherapy). Drug acquisition costs were based 
on published 2020 US list prices. A 3% discount rate was applied to life-years, 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs. A deterministic analysis was 
performed on the base case; 1-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses assessed model and parameter uncertainties.
RESULTS: Cemiplimab was associated with increased time in the "preprogression" 
(13.08 vs 7.90 and 6.08 months) and "postprogression" (47.30 vs 29.49 and 14.78 
months) health states versus pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, respectively. 
Compared with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, cemiplimab generated 1.00 (95% 
CI -0.266 to 2.440) and 1.78 (95% CI 0.607-3.20) incremental QALYs, 
respectively, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $68 254 and $89 219 
per QALY for cemiplimab versus pembrolizumab and cemiplimab versus chemotherapy, 
respectively. The probability of cemiplimab being cost-effective at a 
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 to $150 000 per QALY was 62% to 76% 
versus pembrolizumab and 56% to 84% versus chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that cemiplimab, versus pembrolizumab or versus 
chemotherapy, is a cost-effective first-line treatment option for advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer with programmed death-ligand 1 expression ≥50%.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate whether the profit margins of 
pharmaceuticals would influence the outcome of reimbursement decisions within 
the Dutch policy context.
METHODS: We conducted a discrete choice experiment among 58 Dutch decision 
makers. In 20 choice sets, we asked respondents to indicate which of 2 
pharmaceutical treatment options they would select for reimbursement. Options 
were described using 5 attributes (disease severity, incremental costs per 
quality-adjusted life-year, health gain, budget impact, and profit margin) with 
3 levels each. Additionally, cognitive debriefing questions were presented, and 
for validation debriefing, interviews were conducted. Choice data were analyzed 
using mixed logit models, also to calculate marginal effects and choice 
probabilities.
RESULTS: Results indicated that the specified levels of profit margins 
significantly influenced choices made. Decision makers were less likely to 
reimburse a product with a higher profit margin. The relative importance of 
profit margins was lower than that of the included traditional health technology 
assessment criteria, but not negligible. When asked directly, 61% of respondents 
indicated that profit margin should play a role in reimbursement decision 
making, although concerns about feasibility and the connection to price 
negotiations were voiced.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that if available to decision makers the profit 
margin of pharmaceutical products would influence reimbursement decisions within 
the Dutch policy context. Higher profit margins would reduce the likelihood of 
reimbursement. Whether adding profit margin as an additional, explicit criterion 
to the health technology assessment decision framework would be feasible and 
desirable is open to further exploration.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the extent to which stated preferences for treatment 
criteria elicited using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods are 
consistent with the trade-offs (implicitly) applied in cost-effectiveness 
analysis (CEA), and the impact of any differences on the prioritization of 
treatments.
METHODS: We used existing MCDA and CEA models developed to evaluate 
interventions for knee osteoarthritis in the New Zealand population. We 
established equivalent input parameters for each model, for the criteria 
"treatment effectiveness," "cost," "risk of serious harms," and "risk of 
mild-to-moderate harms" across a comprehensive range of (hypothetical) 
interventions to produce a complete ranking of interventions from each model. We 
evaluated the consistency of these rankings between the 2 models and 
investigated any systematic differences between the (implied) weight placed on 
each criterion in determining rankings.
RESULTS: There was an overall moderate-to-strong correlation in intervention 
rankings between the MCDA and CEA models (Spearman correlation coefficient = 
0.51). Nevertheless, there were systematic differences in the evaluation of 
trade-offs between intervention attributes and the resulting weights placed on 
each criterion. The CEA model placed lower weights on risks of harm and much 
greater weight on cost (at all accepted levels of willingness-to-pay per 
quality-adjusted life-year than did respondents to the MCDA survey.
CONCLUSIONS: MCDA and CEA approaches to inform intervention prioritization may 
give systematically different results, even when considering the same criteria 
and input data. These differences should be considered when designing and 
interpreting such studies to inform treatment prioritization decisions.

OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a complex, chronic condition that 
impairs health-related quality of life of affected individuals and their 
caregivers. As curative therapies emerge, comprehensive cost-effectiveness 
models will inform their value. These models will require descriptions of health 
states and their corresponding utility values that accurately reflect 
health-related quality of life over the disease trajectory. The objectives of 
this systematic review were to develop a catalog of health state utility (HSU) 
values for SCD, identify research gaps, and provide future directions for 
preference elicitation.
METHODS: Records were identified through searches of PubMed and Embase, Tufts 
Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, reference lists of relevant 
articles, and consultation with SCD experts (2008-2020). We removed duplicate 
records and excluded ineligible studies. For included studies, we summarized the 
study characteristics, methods used for eliciting HSUs, and HSU values.
RESULTS: Five studies empirically elicited utilities using indirect methods 
(EQ-5D) (n = 3) and Short Form-6 Dimension (n = 2); these represent health 
states associated with general SCD (n = 1), SCD complications (n = 2), and SCD 
treatments (n = 3). Additionally, we extracted HSUs from 7 quality-adjusted 
life-years-based outcome research studies. The HSU among patients with general 
SCD without specifying complications ranged from 0.64 to 0.887. Only 36% of the 
HSUs used in the quality-adjusted life-year-based outcomes research studies were 
derived from individuals with SCD. No study estimated HSUs in caregivers.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a dearth of literature of HSUs for use in SCD models. 
Future empirical studies should elicit a comprehensive set of HSUs from 
individuals with SCD and their caregivers.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate how value is defined and measured in 
existing value assessment frameworks (VAFs) in healthcare.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Centre for 
Reviews and Dissemination from 2008 to 2019. We also performed backward citation 
chaining of included studies and previously published systematic reviews. 
Studies reporting the development of a VAF in healthcare were included. For each 
included framework, we extracted and compared the context, target users, 
intended use, methods used to identify value attributes, description of the 
attributes, and attribute scoring approaches.
RESULTS: Of the 8151 articles screened, 57 VAFs were included. The value 
attributes included in 55 VAFs were grouped into 9 categories: health benefits 
(n = 53, 96%), affordability (n = 45, 82%), societal impact (n = 42, 76%), 
burden of disease (n = 36, 65%), quality of evidence (n = 32, 58%), 
cost-effectiveness (n = 31, 56%), ethics and equity (n = 27, 49%), unmet needs 
(n = 21, 38%), and innovation (n = 15, 27%). The remaining 2 VAFs used broad 
attributes or user-defined attributes. Literature review was the main approach 
to identify value attributes in 36 VAFs. Patient or public was engaged through 
the development of only 11 VAFs. Weighting has been used to score 29 VAFs, of 
which 19 used the methods of multicriteria decision analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial variations in defining and measuring value. A 
noticeable weakness of existing VAFs is that patient or public engagement was 
generally very limited or missing in framework development process. Existing 
VAFs tend to aggregate multiple value attributes into a single index for 
decision making.

OBJECTIVES: Pneumococcal infection is a leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 23-valent 
polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) together with influenza vaccination or 
pneumococcal vaccination alone in adults starting from 50 years vs. 65 years in 
Hong Kong.
METHODS: A hypothetical population of 100,000 older adults was included in a 
Markov model with age ranging from 50 to 85 years to calculate the cost and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained for vaccination strategies, 
including: (1) annual influenza vaccine and PPV23 at 50 and 65 years; (2) annual 
influenza vaccine and PPV23 at 65 years (similar with the current vaccination 
programme); (3) PPV23 at 50 and 65 years; (4) PPV23 at 65 years; and (5) no 
vaccination. We evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and 
used Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The 
cost-effectiveness threshold was extracted from previous literature.
RESULTS: In comparison with no vaccination, all strategies were cost-effective 
with ICERs less than the threshold (US$24,302 per QALY gained). When compared 
with no vaccination, strategies 1-4 saved US$ 49.5, US$ 94.9, US$ 584.3, and US$ 
1114.2 to gain one QALY respectively. In comparison with strategy 2, strategy 1 
spent US$ 195.3 to gain one QALY, whilst strategies 3 and 4 showed less 
effectiveness with increased costs.
CONCLUSIONS: All vaccination strategies were cost-effective, among which the 
strategy of PPV23 at 50/65 years with annual influenza vaccine was 
cost-effective even in comparison with current vaccination programme. These 
findings could help inform the design and implementation of vaccination 
strategies.

Health, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia.

BACKGROUND: The established link between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 
dementia may provide new insights into dementia prevention.
OBJECTIVE: It aims to quantify the burden of dementia attributable to people 
with CVD.
METHODS: A Markov microsimulation model was developed to simulate the lifetime 
cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) related to people with and without 
CVD in Australia. A de-novo systematic review was undertaken to identify all 
evidence around the association between CVD [i.e., stroke, myocardial infarction 
(MI), atrial fibrillation (AF), and heart failure (HF)] and the risk of 
developing dementia. Incremental costs and QALY losses were estimated for people 
by type of CVD compared to the general Australian population without CVD.
RESULTS: Of the comprehensive literature search, 19 observational studies were 
included in the qualitative synthesis. Patients who had CVD incurred both higher 
healthcare costs over their lifetime (ranging from $73,131 for patients with AF 
to $127,396 for patients with HF) and fewer QALYs gains (from -1.099 for 
patients with MI to -5.163 for patients with stroke), compared to people who did 
not have CVD. The total incremental economic burden of dementia from patients 
aged 65 years and over with CVD was $6.45 billion (stroke), $11.89 billion (AF), 
$17.57 billion (MI), or $7.95 billion (HF) over their remaining life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: The results highlighted the importance of CVD prevention to reduce 
the CVD burden and decrease the prevalence of dementia. Interventions that 
target patients with dementia risk factors like CVD may prove to be effective 
and cost-effective strategies.

As the worldwide average life expectancy has grown, the prevalence of 
age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) has risen dramatically. A 
progressive loss of neuronal function characterizes NDDs, usually followed by 
neuronal death. Inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and protein 
misfolding are critical dysregulated signaling pathways that mainly orchestrate 
neuronal damage from a mechanistic point. Furthermore, in afflicted families 
with genetic anomalies, mutations and multiplications of α-synuclein and 
amyloid-related genes produce some kinds of NDDs. Overproduction of such 
proteins, and their excessive aggregation, have been proven in various models of 
neuronal malfunction and death. In this line, providing multi-target therapies 
carried by novel delivery systems would pave the road to control NDDs through 
simultaneous modulation of such dysregulated pathways. Phytochemicals are 
multi-target therapeutic agents, which employ several mechanisms towards 
neuroprotection. Besides, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a critical issue in 
managing NDDs since it inhibits the accessibility of drugs to the brain in 
sufficient concentration. Besides, discovering novel delivery systems is vital 
to improving the efficacy, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetic of therapeutic 
agents. Such novel formulations are also employed to improve the drug's 
biodistribution, allow for the co-delivery of several medicines, and offer 
targeted intracellular delivery against NDDs. The present review proposes 
nanoformulations of phytochemicals and synthetic agents to combat NDDs by 
modulating neuroinflammation, neuroapoptosis, neuronal oxidative stress pathways 
and protein misfolding.

BACKGROUND: The challenges of modern medicine in addressing chronic diseases 
necessitate a shift of attention towards traditional medicine (TM) and other 
supplementary care systems. China has prioritized the strengthening of 
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the health system reform since 2009. This 
study sought to assess the effects of the reform on TCM and the resultant effect 
of a strengthened TCM on health outcomes and financial protection.
METHODS: Longitudinal data were obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook, 
China Health Statistical Yearbook, China Population Statistical Yearbook, and 
Statistical Extract of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 31 provinces of mainland 
China between 2002 and 2016. Dependent variables included health outcomes 
measured by age-standardized excess mortality and life expectancy at birth and 
financial protection measured by the proportion of health expenses in total 
consumption expenses. The independent variables consisted of the number and 
proportion of TCM physicians. The fixed effects (FEs) models were established to 
identify the effect of the independent variables on outcomes.
RESULTS: From 2009 to 2016, the number and proportion of TCM physicians 
increased from 22 to 36 physicians per 100,000 population and from <12% to >15%, 
respectively. The changes were more rapid and higher than that in the period 
before the reform. An increase of 1 TCM physician per 100,000 population was 
associated with a decrease of 1.944 excess deaths, a 5.84-day increase in male 
life expectancy, and a decrease of 0.051% of health expenses among both urban 
and rural residents. An increase in proportion of 1% of TCM physicians was 
associated with a decrease of 5.097 excess deaths, a 17.52-day increase of life 
expectancy (both genders), an increase of 21.535-day in life expectancy (males) 
per 100,000 population, and a decrease of 0.082% of health expenses among rural 
residents.
CONCLUSION: During China's health system reform, the increased physician number 
has strengthened TCM. Higher TCM physician supply was associated with improved 
health outcomes and financial protection, which implies that the reform may have 
important implications on health system performance in China.

Nucleic acid testing (NAT) is important for the identification and 
quantification of specific nucleic acid targets, both DNA and RNA, in life 
sciences and clinical diagnostics. Nucleic acid amplification can be a 
time-consuming step in NAT using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. 
Therefore, this study aimed to develop a simple method to reduce the 
amplification time while maintaining the PCR system. The three-step process of a 
general qPCR was reduced to a two-step process. The annealing/extension 
temperatures were increased to minimize the differences between the denaturation 
temperature and the annealing/extension temperatures. Subsequently, the time for 
each of these steps was reduced and, finally, the denaturation temperature was 
lowered. Taq polymerase was replaced with SD polymerase because it has strand 
displacement activity and is efficient in amplifying partial dsDNA at lower 
denaturation temperatures. In the two-step qPCR of genomic DNA using SD 
polymerase, the final conditions included an initial denaturation at 92 °C for 
2 min, and 1 s at each cycling step with a denaturation temperature of 87 °C and 
an annealing/extension temperature of 72 °C. Amplification of the nucleocapsid 
(N) gene of SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus was evaluated at a template concentration as 
low as 10 copies. This method, named SF-qPCR (strand displacement-based fast 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction), can stably detect less than 10 copies 
of DNA and RNA within 25-40 min. This new protocol allows for sensitive and 
rapid detection of important DNA and RNA targets in clinical diagnosis.

With the wide use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the life 
expectancy of HIV-infected individuals drastically improved. However, HIV 
infection and HIV-associated cancers were the most common causes of death in the 
HIV-infected populations. The HIV-associated cancers are divided into acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining and non-AIDS-defining cancers based 
on the incidence among the HIV-infected patients. Among HIV-associated cancers, 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related lymphoma (ARL) is still the most 
common condition and the leading cause of HIV/AIDS-related deaths. Diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) are the most common subtypes 
of the ARL. Although Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is not considered as an 
AIDS-defining cancer, incidence of HL in HIV-infected individuals is higher than 
the general population. The review summarizes the new progress in the treatment 
of HIV-associated lymphoma.

A recurrent theme of the literature and wider public discourse is that trade and 
digitization are good for health as it promotes economic prosperity. The present 
study investigates the impact of trade and digitization on health in 12 selected 
Asian economies for the period 1991-2019. The study applied FMOLS and DOLS 
approaches for confirming the panel and economy-wise findings. The core findings 
of the panel FMOLS confirm the significant negative impact of trade and 
digitization on mortality rate, and trade and digitization have significantly 
positively contributed to life expectancy in selected Asian countries in the 
long run. The study deduces some imperative policy implications related to 
trade, digitization, and health, specifically for Asian economies.

Today, the developing economies continue to tackle the penalties of the energy 
use and its influence on their environmental and socio-economic prosperity, and 
the developed economies are concentrating on promoting programs and policies to 
improve and sustain the endowment of adequate energy consumption that pledges 
less carbon emissions and threats to human health. Currently, millions of people 
face a dearth of access to reliable, affordable, and clean energy to fulfill 
their daily requirements. Thus, the mounting need for energy use portends 
hazardous consequences on human health. This paper investigates the transmission 
channels and impact of energy consumption on health outcomes in Asia by adopting 
a panel of selected Asian economies for the period from 1991 and 2019. The 
findings of the study show that energy causes a rise in infant mortality rate 
and a reduction in life expectancy. Furthermore, the study found that a high 
degree of pollution emissions causes a rise in infant mortality and a decline in 
life expectancy.

The present study attempts to examine the impact of digitization and green 
technology on the health outcomes of BRICS countries over the period of 
1993-2019. Internet users measure digitalization, and health outcome is 
determined by life expectancy. The study employed the ARDL estimation approach 
for empirical investigation of country-specific analysis. GDP per capita and 
current health expenditures have been incorporated as control variables. The 
study findings reveal that digitalization results in increasing life expectancy 
in the long-run in BRICS except for Brazil. While green technology tends to 
enhance life expectancy in the long-run in Russia and China, it produces an 
insignificant impact on health outcomes in the short-run. While GDP and health 
expenditures also improve life expectancy in mostly BRICS economies in the 
long-run and short-run. Our study provides some policy implications for BRICS 
nations.

Adults with spinal deformity (ASD) are known to have spinal malalignment 
affecting their quality of life and daily life activities. While walking 
kinematics were shown to be altered in ASD, other functional activities are yet 
to be evaluated such as sitting and standing, which are essential for patients' 
autonomy and quality of life perception. In this cross-sectional study, 93 ASD 
subjects (50 ± 20 years; 71 F) age and sex matched to 31 controls (45 ± 
15 years; 18 F) underwent biplanar radiographic imaging with subsequent 
calculation of standing radiographic spinopelvic parameters. All subjects filled 
HRQOL questionnaires such as SF36 and ODI. ASD were further divided into 34 
ASD-sag (with PT > 25° and/or SVA >5 cm and/or PI-LL >10°), 32 ASD-hyperTK (with 
only TK >60°), and 27 ASD-front (with only frontal malalignment: Cobb >20°). All 
subjects underwent 3D motion analysis during the sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit 
movements. The range of motion (ROM) and mean values of pelvis, lower limbs, 
thorax, head, and spinal segments were calculated on the kinematic waveforms. 
Kinematics were compared between groups and correlations to radiographic and 
HRQOL scores were computed. During sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit movements, 
ASD-sag had decreased pelvic anteversion (12.2 vs 15.2°), hip flexion (53.0 vs 
62.2°), sagittal mobility in knees (87.1 vs 93.9°), and lumbar mobility 
(L1L3-L3L5: -9.1 vs -6.8°, all p < 0.05) compared with controls. ASD-hyperTK 
showed increased dynamic lordosis (L1L3-L3L5: -9.1 vs -6.8°), segmental thoracic 
kyphosis (T2T10-T10L1: 32.0 vs 17.2°, C7T2-T2T10: 30.4 vs 17.7°), and 
thoracolumbar extension (T10L1-L1L3: -12.4 vs -5.5°, all p < 0.05) compared with 
controls. They also had increased mobility at the thoracolumbar and 
upper-thoracic spine. Both ASD-sag and ASD-hyperTK maintained a flexed trunk, an 
extended head along with an increased trunk and head sagittal ROM. Kinematic 
alterations were correlated to radiographic parameters and HRQOL scores. Even 
after controlling for demographic factors, dynamic trunk flexion was determined 
by TK and PI-LL mismatch (adj. R 2 = 0.44). Lumbar sagittal ROM was determined 
by PI-LL mismatch (adj. R 2 = 0.13). In conclusion, the type of spinal deformity 
in ASD seems to determine the strategy used for sitting and standing. Future 
studies should evaluate whether surgical correction of the deformity could 
restore sitting and standing kinematics and ultimately improve quality of life.

Lycium barbarum berry (Ningxia Gouqi, Fructus lycii, goji berry, or wolfberry), 
as a traditional Chinese herb, was recorded beneficial for longevity in 
traditional Chinese medical scriptures and currently is a natural dietary 
supplement worldwide. However, under modern experimental conditions, the 
longevity effect of L. barbarum berry and the underlying mechanisms have been 
less studied. Here, we reported that total water extracts of L. barbarum berry 
(LBE), which contains 22% polysaccharides and other components, such as 
anthocyanins, extended the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans without side 
effects on worm fertility and pharyngeal pumping. Interestingly, we found that 
the lifespan extension effect was more prominent in worms with shorter mean 
lifespan as compared to those with longer mean lifespan. Furthermore, we showed 
that the lifespan extension effect of LBE depended on deacetylase sir-2.1. 
Remarkably, LBE rescued heat shock transcription factor-1 (hsf-1) deficiency in 
wild-type worms with different mean lifespans, and this effect also depended on 
sir-2.1. In addition, we found that LBE extended lifespan and alleviated toxic 
protein aggregation in neurodegenerative worms with hsf-1 deficiency. Our study 
suggested that LBE may be a potential antiaging natural dietary supplement 
especially to individuals with malnutrition or chronic diseases and a potential 
therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by hsf-1 
deficiency.

Shifts in ecology, behavior, values, and relationships during the coronavirus 
pandemic: Survival threat, subsistence activities, conservation of resources, 
and interdependent families.

What are the psychological effects of the coronavirus pandemic? Greenfield's 
Theory of Social Change, Cultural Evolution, and Human Development predicts that 
when survival concerns augment, and one's social world narrows toward the family 
household. life shifts towards activities, values, relationships, and parenting 
expectations typical of small-scale rural subsistence environments with low life 
expectancy. Specific predictions were that, during the pandemic, respondents 
would report intensified survival concerns (e.g., thinking about one's own 
mortality); increased subsistence activities (e.g., growing food); augmented 
subsistence values (e.g., conserving resources); more interdependent family 
relationships (e.g., members helping each other obtain food); and parents 
expecting children to contribute more to family maintenance (e.g., by cooking 
for the family). All hypotheses were confirmed with a large-scale survey in 
California (N = 1,137) administered after about a month of stay-at-home orders 
during the coronavirus pandemic; results replicated in Rhode Island (N = 955). 
We posited that an experience of increased survival concerns and number of days 
spent observing stay-at-home orders would predict these shifts. A structural 
equation model confirmed this hypothesis.

Life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) is now close to that of the 
HIV-uninfected population. As a result, age-related comorbidities, including 
osteoporosis, are increasing in PLWH. This narrative review describes the 
epidemiology of bone fragility in PLWH, changes of bone features over the course 
of HIV infection and their determinants, as well as the available evidence 
regarding the management of osteoporosis in PLWH. The risk of fracture is higher 
and increases about 10 years earlier compared to the general population. The 
classical risk factors of bone fragility are very widespread and are major 
determinants of bone health in this population. The majority of bone loss occurs 
during virus replication and during immune reconstitution at antiretroviral 
therapies (ART) initiation, which both increase osteoclast activity. 
Abnormalities in bone formation and mineralization have also been shown in 
histomorphometric studies in untreated PLWH. Measurement of bone mineral density 
(BMD) is the first line tool for assessing fracture risk in postmenopausal 
women, men above 50 years, and other HIV-infected patients with clinical risk 
factors for osteoporosis. FRAX underestimates fracture probability in PLWH. In 
case of indication for anti-osteoporotic drug, bisphosphonates remain the 
reference option. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation should be considered as 
ART initiation, since it may attenuate bone loss at this stage. Bone-protective 
ART regimens improve BMD compared to other regimens, but to a lesser extent than 
bisphosphonate, and without available data on their influence on the incidence 
of fracture.
