The nutritive value of single foods.

Williams RJ, Heffley JD, Bode CW.

This is an extension of an earlier study in which we found that while commercial 
"enriched" bread alone would not support the life of weanling rats in a 90-day 
test, enrichment could be updated at low cost, with the result that rats 
consuming the improved bread alone lived during the test period and grew seven 
times as fast. Prominent nutritionists criticized this study on the basis that 
bread is not eaten alone and that other single foods are likewise deficient. It 
was stated: "the experiments you performed would have given the same or similar 
results if you had begun with milk, eggs, meat, or any other food". Skepticism 
regarding this statement led to experimental trials in which milk, meat, eggs, 
and several other foods, including breakfast cereals, were fed singly to groups 
of animals. Eggs proved to be a remarkably complete food, and milk exhibited 
about the same excellence until the iron deficiency became evident after about 
two months. "Enriched" breakfast foods and macaroni were highly deficient and 
could be improved greatly by supplementation.As an outgrowth of this study, we 
are developing a method of biological testing which is incomparably better for 
evaluating foods than consulting food composition tables. On the basis of the 
tabulated data alone one might conclude that "enriched" puffed rice, for 
example, is only slightly inferior nutritionally to eggs. Our experiments have 
shown this assumption to be grossly in error.

Studies on man vector contact in some malarious areas in Colombia.

Elliott R.

The frequency of man-biting by mosquitos depends upon the amount of contact 
between man and mosquito, which in turn depends upon the behaviour patterns of 
both. In order to examine these relationships in an area with a high incidence 
of malaria, a study was made in 1965 of the nocturnal movements and of mosquito 
biting habits in five localities in the malarious area of Colombia that were in 
the thirteenth or fourteenth cycle of biennial DDT spraying.The populations were 
classed into five age- and sex-groups, i.e., men and women over the age of 15 
years, boys and girls from 5 to 15 years, and children under 5. A number of 
differences in the habits of these groups were discovered in relation to time 
spent indoors or outside, but close to, the house.The habits of the four main 
anopheline vector species were studied in relation to human activities. For 
three of the species (A. albimanus, A. darlingi, A. nuneztovari) it is suggested 
that a low relative importance of outdoor biting is caused not by a 
density-dependent factor but by an anopheline gonotrophic cycle or by relative 
humidity or both. The fourth species (A. punctimacula), common only at one 
locality, displayed a complex pattern of biting behaviour with, however, a much 
greater frequency of outdoor biting than in the other species.It is considered 
that in these localities malaria is probably transmitted mainly inside sprayed 
houses by vectors that are susceptible to the insecticides in use but which are 
not sufficiently reduced in numbers or in life-expectancy to interrupt the 
transmission of the parasite.

Severe peptic oesophagitis.

Brunnen PL, Karmody AM, Needham CD.

The incidence, clinical and investigative features, treatment, and course of 
severe oesophagitis in 200 patients seen and followed up in the Thoracic 
Surgical Department for north east Scotland from 1951 to 1967 are reviewed. The 
male/female ratio was 1/1.9. The incidence of severe oesophagitis (grades III 
and IV) approximated to 4.5 per 100,000; there was a dramatic increase from the 
age of 50 years onwards.Reflux, with or without hiatal hernia, precedes 
oesophagitis and has an incidence in excess of 86 per 100,000. It is difficult 
to assess the extent to which reflux produces mild oesophagitis, but it is clear 
that it only infrequently leads to the severe grades. Severe oesophagitis does 
not always need operative treatment. A conservative regime, supplemented by 
bouginage as required, enables the poorer-risk older patient to live a 
near-normal life span, in very reasonable comfort. Fifty-three patients of the 
whole series were operated upon, half primarily and half after previous 
conservative treatment. The problems of operative treatment are discussed. Newer 
procedures designed to prevent reflux now allow operation to be more freely 
advised.Perhaps, rather surprisingly, severe oesophagitis had very little effect 
on the expectation of life, whether treatment was conservative or operative.

Congenital complete absence of left pericardium. Report of two cases.

Borrie J.

Two cases of congenital complete absence of the left pericardium are presented. 
One, in a youth aged 17 years, had an associated patent ductus arteriosus; the 
other occurred in a woman aged 65 years with carcinoma of the lower third of the 
oesophagus. In both, the pericardial lesion was discovered as an incidental 
finding—at thoracotomy. The anatomical and radiographic features are described. 
Complete absence of the left side of the pericardium needs no surgical treatment 
and is compatible with normal life expectancy. On the other hand, because of the 
dangers of herniation of the heart with strangulation, partial defects should be 
closed, using either mediastinal pleura or fabric such as Dacron or Teflon.

Immediate and long-term results of mitral valve replacement with University of 
Cape Town mitral valve prosthesis.

Schrire V, Barnard CN.

We describe seven years' experience with the University of Cape Town lenticular 
mitral valve prosthesis in 122 patients. All the patients had severe mitral 
valve disease. In 98 severe mitral stenosis was present with or without 
incompetence and in 24 the dominant or sole lesion was mitral incompetence. 
Other valves, particularly the tricuspid, were also frequently affected. The 
disability was severe or total in almost every patient. One hundred and five 
patients were discharged from hospital, and in 90 per cent of these the clinical 
improvement was most gratifying, with the disappearance of pulmonary oedema, 
paroxysmal dyspnoea, angina pectoris, and congestive cardiac failure. Return to 
full normal activity including physical work was the rule. The hospital 
mortality was 14 per cent and a further 38 per cent died during the follow-up 
period. The major post-operative complication was systemic embolism which could 
occur at any time after operation. The most important factor influencing the 
frequency of this complication was the nature of the valve seat. A bare steel 
seat was associated with a 100 per cent embolism, and a significant reduction 
occurred when a cloth-covered seat of Dacron-velour was introduced. 
Anticoagulant therapy appeared to prevent large or fresh clots but had no effect 
on the deposition of fibrin or platelet thrombi. The only other factor of 
importance was the age of the patient: after the age of 50 life expectancy and 
trouble-free long-term survival was reduced.

"Psychogenic" death: a reappraisal.

Barrett GV, Franke RH.

Social, economic, and medical variables correlated with "psychogenic" death 
rates across about 30 countries. However, McClelland's psychological motives of 
achievement, affiliation, and power, determined for each country by content 
analysis of children's stories, did not. Status integration correlated 
positively with homicide and negatively with deaths from suicide and ulcers. Low 
life expectancy, wealth, economic growth, wine consumption, and zinc (cadmium) 
consumption correlated with deaths from homicide, suicide, ulcers, cirrhosis and 
hypertension, respectively.

Natural history of coarctation of the aorta.

Campbell M.

With the increasing number of subjects with coarctation of the aorta having 
operations, its natural history becomes more difficult to determine. The 
expectation of life has been calculated by two quite independent methods: (1) 
from 304 reported necropsies, and (2) from 22 deaths among 161 subjects followed 
for 716 patient-years. These were mostly patients rather than unselected 
school-children, but many were quite free from symptoms and were sent only 
because a murmur was heard on examination. Knowing how long they had been under 
observation, mortality rates could be calculated for each decade. They rise 
gradually but not very regularly, from 1.6 per cent in the first two decades to 
6.7 per cent per annum in the sixth and later decades. The two methods give 
results in close agreement, closer than could be expected considering the 
relatively small numbers of patients and patient-years. The percentages of 
deaths at the end of each decade found by the two methods never differ by more 
than +/-4 per cent and are often much closer. Of those surviving the serious 
hazards of the first one or two years, 25 per cent die before they reach 20, 50 
per cent by 32, 75 per cent by 46, and 90 per cent by 58 years. The arithmetical 
mean of the ages of death is 34 years instead of 71 years as normally. These 
means, however, hide a very wide range, with standard deviations of at least 
+/-15 per cent. For coarctation the median is 31 years and the mode is widely 
spread through the second to fifth decades rather than closely clustered round a 
point. This poor outlook makes an operative mortality in the region of 5 per 
cent a small price to pay for the greatly increased security afterwards. We do 
not yet know how much the risk of bacterial endocarditis or of intracranial 
haemorrhage will be reduced in the long run because there may be bicuspid aortic 
valves or intracranial berry aneurysms. The exact incidence of subacute 
bacterial endocarditis is uncertain, somewhere between 0.6 (from necropsy 
series) and 1.3 per cent per annum in clinical series. The range was similar for 
persistent ductus arteriosus, but paradoxically 1.5 for the necropsy series and 
0.5 for the clinical series. Clearly the incidence is high in all the four 
malformations shown in Table 5, about 0.9+/-0.4 per cent per annum.
