were evaluated with a quasi-experimental, pre-post test design, using paired 
t-tests. Factors contributing to positive changes were tested using general 
linear models. The outcome measures included blood pressure (mmHg), weight (kg), 
body mass index (kg/m2), waist and hip circumference (cm), waist to hip ratio 
(waist cm/hip cm) and six minute walk test (6MWT).
RESULTS: Changes in several clinical outcome measures were detected, either 
within the entire group (n = 85) or within specific participant sub-groups. 
Participant's 6MWT distance improved by an average 0.053 km (95% CI: 
0.01-0.07 km). The change in distance travelled was influenced by number of 
social and emotional wellbeing conditions participants presented with. The 
weight of participants classified with extreme obesity decreased on average by 
1.6 kg (95% CI: 0.1-3.0 kg). Participants with high baseline systolic blood 
pressure demonstrated a mean decrease of 11 mmHg (95% CI: 3.2-18.8 mmHg). Change 
in blood pressure was influenced by the number of cardiovascular conditions 
participants experienced.
CONCLUSIONS: Short-term improvements seen in some measures could indicate a 
trend for improvement in other indicators over the longer term. These results 
suggest the Work It Out program could be a useful model for cardiovascular 
rehabilitation and prevention for other urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander populations.

INTRODUCTION: Aim of the present study is to evaluate homolateral and 
contralateral hippocampus (H-H, C-H, respectively) dose during Fractionated 
Stereotactic Radiotherapy (FSRT) or Radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases 
(BM).
MATERIALS & METHODS: Patients with BM<5, size≤30mm, KPS≥80 and a life 
expectancy>3months, were considered for SRS/FSRT (total dose 15-30Gy, 1-5 
fractions). For each BM, a Flattening Filter Free (FFF) Volumetric Modulated Arc 
Therapy (VMAT) plan was generated with one or two arcs. Hippocampi were not 
considered during optimizations phase and were contoured and evaluated 
retrospectively in terms of dose: the Dmedian, Dmean, D0.1cc and the V1Gy, V2Gy, 
V5Gy and V10Gy were analyzed.
RESULTS: From April 2014 to December 2015, 81 BM were treated with FFF-FSRT/SRS. 
For the H-H, the average values of Dmedian, Dmean and D0.1cc were 1.5Gy, 1.54Gy 
and 2.2Gy, respectively, while the V1Gy, V2Gy, V5Gy and V10Gy values were 25%, 
8.9%, 8.9% and 2.1%, respectively. For the C-H, the average Dmedian, Dmean and 
D0.1cc were 0.7Gy, 0.7Gy, 0.9Gy, respectively, while the average values of V1Gy, 
V2Gy, V5Gy and V10Gy were 18%, 10.2%, 2.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Tumor 
dimension, tumor cranial-caudal length and the distance between BM and H-H were 
correlated to Dmedian, Dmean and D0.1cc. For C-H, only the distance from PTV was 
correlated with a dose reduction.
CONCLUSION: During FFF-FSRT/SRS, hippocampus received a negligible dose. Despite 
its clinical significance is still under evaluation, in patients with a long 
life expectancy, H-H should be considered during Linac-based FSRT/SRS.

BACKGROUND: In the U.S., intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for pregnant 
women colonized with group B streptococcus (GBS) has reduced GBS disease in the 
first week of life (early-onset/EOGBS). Nonetheless, GBS remains a leading cause 
of neonatal sepsis, including 1000 late-onset (LOGBS) cases annually. A maternal 
vaccine under development could prevent EOGBS and LOGBS.
METHODS: Using a decision-analytic model, we compared the public health impact, 
costs, and cost-effectiveness of five strategies to prevent GBS disease in 
infants: (1) no prevention; (2) currently recommended screening/IAP; (3) 
maternal GBS immunization; (4) maternal immunization with IAP when indicated for 
unimmunized women; (5) maternal immunization plus screening/IAP for all women. 
We modeled a pentavalent vaccine covering serotypes 1a, 1b, II, III, and V, 
which cause almost all GBS disease.
RESULTS: In the base case, screening/IAP alone prevents 46% of EOGBS compared to 
no prevention, at a cost of $70,275 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from a 
healthcare and $51,249/QALY from a societal perspective (2013 US$). At coverage 
rates typical of maternal vaccines in the U.S., a pentavalent vaccine alone 
would not prevent as much disease as screening/IAP until its efficacy approached 
90%, but would cost less per QALY. At vaccine efficacy of ≥70%, maternal 
immunization together with IAP for unimmunized women would prevent more disease 
than screening/IAP, at a similar cost/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: GBS maternal immunization, with IAP as indicated for unvaccinated 
women, could be an attractive alternative to screening/IAP if a pentavalent 
vaccine is sufficiently effective. Coverage, typically low for maternal 
vaccines, is key to the vaccine's public health impact.

OBJECTIVE: Hispanics account for approximately 17% of the U.S.
POPULATION: They are one of the fastest growing racial/ethnic groups, second 
only to Asians. This heterogeneous population has diverse socioeconomic 
conditions, making the prevention, diagnosis, and management of vascular disease 
difficult. This paper discusses the cultural, racial, and social aspects of the 
Hispanic community in the United States and assesses how they affect vascular 
disease within this population. Furthermore, it explores risk factors, medical 
and surgical treatments, and outcomes of vascular disease in the Hispanic 
population; generational evolution of these conditions; and the phenomenon 
called the Hispanic paradox.
METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was performed to identify all 
English-language publications from 1991 to 2014 using PubMed, which draws from 
the National Institutes of Health and U.S. National Library of Medicine, with 
the words "cardiovascular disease," "prevalence," "vascular," and "Hispanic." An 
additional search was performed using "cardiovascular disease and Mexico," 
"cardiovascular disease and Cuba," "cardiovascular disease and Puerto Rico," and 
"cardiovascular disease and Latin America" as well as for complications, 
management, outcomes, surgery, vascular disease, and Hispanic paradox. The 
resulting publications were queried for generational data (spanning multiple 
well-defined age groups) regarding cardiovascular disease, and cross-references 
were obtained from their bibliographies. Results are segmented by country of 
origin.
RESULTS: Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics face higher risks of 
cardiovascular diseases because of a high prevalence of high blood pressure, 
obesity, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic stroke. However, the incidence of 
peripheral arterial disease and carotid disease appears to be significantly 
lower than in whites. The Hispanic paradox (lower mortality in spite of higher 
cardiovascular risk factors) may relate to challenges in ascribing life 
expectancy and cause of death in this diverse population. Low socioeconomic 
status and high prevalence of concomitant diseases negatively influence the 
outcomes of all patients, independent of being Hispanic.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the cultural diversity in Hispanics is important in 
terms of targeting preventive measures to modify cardiovascular risk factors, 
which affect development and outcomes of vascular disease. The available 
literature regarding vascular disease in the Hispanic population is limited, and 
further longitudinal study is warranted to improve health care delivery and 
outcomes in this group.

OBJECTIVE: To model the long-term cost-effectiveness of consuming milk powder 
fortified with potassium to decrease systolic blood pressure (SBP) and prevent 
cardiovascular events.
DESIGN: A best case scenario analysis using a Markov model was conducted.
PARTICIPANTS: 8.67% of 50-79 year olds who regularly consume milk in China, 
including individuals with and without a prior diagnosis of hypertension.
INTERVENTION: The model simulated the potential impact of a daily intake of two 
servings of milk powder fortified with potassium (+700 mg/day) vs the 
consumption of a milk powder without potassium fortification, assuming a market 
price equal to 0.99 international dollars (intl$; the consumption of a milk 
powder without potassium fortification, assuming a market price equal to 
intl$0.99 for the latter and to intl$1.12 for the first (+13.13%). Both 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the 
robustness of the results.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimates of the incidence of cardiovascular events and 
subsequent mortality in China were derived from the literature as well as the 
effect of increasing potassium intake on blood pressure. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used to determine the cost-effectiveness of 
a milk powder fortified with potassium taking into consideration the direct 
medical costs associated with the cardiovascular events, loss of working days 
and health utilities impact.
RESULTS: With an ICER equal to int$4711.56 per QALY (quality-adjusted life year) 
in the best case scenario and assuming 100% compliance, the daily consumption of 
a milk powder fortified with potassium shown to be a cost-effective approach to 
decrease SBP and reduce cardiovascular events in China. Healthcare savings due 
to prevention would amount to intl$8.41 billion. Sensitivity analyses showed the 
robustness of the results.
CONCLUSION: Together with other preventive interventions, the consumption of a 
milk powder fortified with potassium could represent a cost-effective strategy 
to attenuate the rapid rise in cardiovascular burden among the 50-79 year olds 
who regularly consume milk in China.

BACKGROUND: The number of migrant elders is increasing due to ageing of the 
global population and increasing life expectancy. There is accumulating evidence 
of the impact of internal or international migration on health.
AIM: To compare the health and depression of local and migrant elders in Hainan 
province.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Health and depression were assessed by the Self-Rated 
Health Measurement Scale Version 1.0 (SRHMS V1.0) and the Geriatric Depression 
Scale (GDS), respectively. The relationship between health and depression was 
investigated, along with the three sub-scales of SRHMS and the potential 
independent variables.
RESULTS: In total, 564 valid questionnaires were returned. Migrant elders were 
younger, had higher education levels and monthly income, and lower prevalence 
rates of chronic diseases than the local elders. The SRHMS scores were 
significantly higher, while the GDS scores were statistically lower in the 
migrant elders than the locals. Depression was negatively correlated with health 
(r = -0.674, p = 0.0000). Moreover, the three sub-scales of SRHMS were 
correlated with age, birth place, marital status, chronic diseases, GDS and/or 
educational level.
CONCLUSION: Migrant elders self-reported better health and lower depression 
compared to the local elders. Differences in age, education, monthly income and 
chronic diseases might be influencing factors.

The number of women living with HIV continues to increase. Thirty years into the 
AIDS epidemic, we now expect those with access to highly active antiretroviral 
to survive into their seventh decade of life or beyond. Increasingly, the focus 
of HIV care is evolving from preventing opportunistic infections and treating 
AIDS-defining malignancies to strategies that promote longevity. This holistic 
approach to care includes detection of malignancies that are associated with 
certain viral infections, with chronic inflammation, and with lifestyle choices. 
The decision to screen an HIV-infected women for cancer should include an 
appreciation of the individualized risk of cancer, her life expectancy, and an 
attempt to balance these concerns with the harms and benefits associated with 
specific cancer screening tests and their potential outcome. Here, we review 
cancer screening strategies for women living with HIV/AIDS with a focus on 
cancers of the lung, breast, cervix, anus, and liver.

Elderly men are likely to be diagnosed with clinically localized prostate 
cancer, however only few studies have assessed the appropriate treatment in such 
patients. Radical prostatectomy is one valid alternative. Perioperative 
outcomes, functional outcomes and oncological outcomes have to be carefully 
discussed in patient counselling. Fewer perioperative complications, lower 
perioperative mortality, and shorter hospitalization times have been reported 
for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy by high-volume surgeons at 
high-volume centers. Although elderly patients are more likely to be 
preoperatively incontinent, and increasing age impacts negatively on continence 
recovery, long-term urinary continence rates have been reported to be 
satisfactorily high also in older patients. Potency should not be considered as 
a relevant outcome, since many elderly patients already suffer from longstanding 
erectile dysfunction and advanced age itself is associated with low chances of 
recovery. Although some inter-study variability exists in different oncological 
outcomes measured, most studies are consistent in showing no different 
cancer-specific survival rates between younger and older patients, thus implying 
that even elderly patients may benefit from radical treatment. Biological rather 
than chronological age should be used to base the decision as to whether a 
patient will profit from definitive treatment. Therefore, elderly men should 
undergo a health assessment using validated tools before any treatment decision. 
Only fit and motivated individuals with a reasonable life expectancy and, above 
all, high-risk disease should be offered radical prostatectomy. In these 
patients, high-volume surgeons and minimally invasive approaches should be 
preferable to minimize perioperative complications.

Hospital, Antalya, Turkey.

OBJECTIVE: Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a frequent cause of morbidity and can 
negatively impact life expectancy; iodine is an essential element for bone 
mineralization, and iodine deficiency is frequently observed. The aim of the 
present study was to understand the connection between postmenopausal 
osteoporosis and the level of iodine in the body.
METHODS: A total of 132 participants were divided into three groups: group 1 
consisted of healthy postmenopausal women (n = 34), group 2 comprised osteopenic 
women (n = 38), and group 3 included women with postmenopausal osteoporosis 
(n = 60). The three groups were compared according to demographic, clinical, and 
laboratory findings.
RESULTS: The urinary iodine levels were recorded as 216.1 ± 125.2 in the control 
group, 154.6 ± 76.6 in the osteopenic group, and 137.5 ± 64.9 in the 
postmenopausal osteoporosis group (P < 0.001). These differences were maintained 
after adjustment for body mass index (P < 0.001). The urinary iodine level 
accurately correlated with the total T-score for the lumbar spine (r = 0.236, 
P = 0.008). Multiple regression analysis showed that corrected for body mass 
index, alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme, and urinary deoxypyridinoline, the 
urinary iodine level was significantly associated with total T-score (beta 
coefficient = 0.270, P = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: The urinary iodine level was significantly lower in women with 
postmenopausal osteoporosis, and iodine replacement may be important in 
preventing osteoporosis in areas where iodine deficiency is endemic.

Author information:
(1)aDepartment of Intensive Care bDepartment of Radiology cDepartment of 
Gastroenterology, CHU Ambroise Paré, Mons dDepartment of Intensive Care, Erasme 
University Hospital - Université Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a frequent emergency 
situation, whose incidence will likely rise as a result of the increasing use of 
direct anticoagulants and of the medical progresses resulting in longer life 
expectancy with underlying comorbidities. Updated guidelines and improvements in 
the diagnostic and therapeutic tools are now available and will likely improve 
the management of massive gastrointestinal bleeding in the near future.
RECENT FINDINGS: The assessment of severity has been improved by validated 
scores useable upon admission. Massive blood transfusion protocols and specific 
care in case of bleeding of patients treated with direct anticoagulants, 
including concentrates of coagulation factors and monoclonal antibodies are now 
available. The endoscopic management has been facilitated by the use of 
hemostatic powders and by the use of self-expanding metal stents in case of 
variceal hemorrhage. New diagnostic tools include emergency video-capsule 
endoscopy, multiphasic computed tomography angiography and enterography.
SUMMARY: The implementation of multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic 
algorithms for the management of massive bleeding requires a close collaboration 
between emergency physicians, intensivists, endoscopists, radiologists and 
surgeons. A sequential strategy involving each of these specialists is desirable 
for a successful management of acute and massive gastrointestinal bleeding.

Survey on the knowledge and expectations of Psychiatry of Intellectual 
Disability (ID) in Junior Doctors joining a NHS Mental Health Trust.

Thalitaya MD(1), Reynolds C.

Author information:
(1)East London NHS University Foundation Trust, London, UK, 
dthalitaya@yahoo.com.

BACKGROUND: Nationally, there is a drive to rotate more Foundation and GP 
Trainee Doctors through Psychiatry posts. In East London Foundation Trust (ELFT) 
in Bedfordshire, doctors from Core Psychiatry, Foundation and GP training 
programmes come to train in Psychiatry. Many will not have worked in Psychiatry 
before and have little experience of patients with ID. The prevalence of people 
with ID is increasing with improved life expectancy. They are a complex and 
vulnerable group with considerable wider legal, ethical and social issues. 
Recent national reports including the Confidential Inquiry in to Premature 
Deaths in People with Learning Disability 3 and Transforming Care 4 have 
recommended increased training and awareness of the roles and responsibilities 
for all health staff who provide care to people with ID.
AIM: To survey the knowledge level and expectations of junior doctors on 
Psychiatry placements in Bedfordshire in relation to ID and local logistical 
arrangements of services and on call duties.
METHODOLOGY: The local ID governance committee together with the Postgraduate 
Medical Education Department created a questionnaire which was circulated to new 
trainee Doctors on placements with ELFT. The questionnaire was distributed to 
new trainees after 3 different inductions throughout the year. This combined 
self-rating questions using Likert scales, multiple choice answers and others 
allowing for expanded free text answers.
DISCUSSION: The results show the self-rated knowledge levels of ID psychiatry in 
general and with regard to local services and on call arrangements amongst new 
trainees was low. The majority of trainees indicated they would have liked to 
have received information on the suggested areas at the start of the placement. 
When given the option of themes of information the psychiatric and medical 
presentation was most sought, although general and on call specific information 
was also indicated to be useful. The most popular delivery of information was 
found to be oral presentation and hand out at induction, followed by an 
electronic document. 8 trainees were interested in attending clinical sessions 
in ID and most felt it would be feasible in their posts to get to these.
CONCLUSIONS: This survey shows that Junior Doctors from different training 
programmes rate their knowledge of ID psychiatry to be low. This has 
implications during their rotation in a mental health trust as they are expected 
to cover an ID ward whilst on call, but also going forward in their careers as 
all specialties will encounter patients with ID. It is known that awareness of 
patients with ID is lacking in many healthcare professionals and we know that 
people with ID are living longer, however continue to have worse health than the 
general population. The results show trainees would like more education on ID 
and would be interested in attending clinical sessions in ID psychiatry. The 
results will enable clinicians in ID services how best to improve the local 
induction experience for trainees. It also will guide how to educate colleagues 
outside of the specialty to improve their practice with people with ID, which 
will improve standards in the quality of care people with ID receive from 
doctors who treat them.

Hospital No. 7 of Medical University of Silesia, Ziołowa 45-47, Katowice, 
Poland, agn.bratek@gmail.com.

BACKGROUND: The population of older adults with intellectual disability (ID) is 
large and growing due to a significant increase of life expectancy caused by 
improvements in health and social care. Multimorbidity is highly prevalent in 
this population and co-morbid psychiatric disorders are especially frequent.
SUBJECT AND METHODS: The aim of this article is to review the prevalence and 
consequences of psychiatric comorbidity in the population of older adults with 
ID. We therefore performed a literature search of studies relevant to adults 
with ID, published since January 2006, using the following keywords: 
intellectual disability and comorbidity, intellectual disability and mental 
disorders, intellectual disability and polypharmacy.
RESULTS: Psychiatric comorbidity is frequent among patients with ID and 
correlates with older age. Mental disorders are present in up to 40% of older 
adults with ID and the most prevalent are challenging behaviour, depression, 
anxiety and dementia. Patients with ID and at least one co-morbid mental 
disorder are at a high risk of polypharmacy. Importantly, psychiatric 
comorbidity was found to significantly increase service use and costs of care.
CONCLUSIONS: Further investigation of the population of older adults with ID is 
needed, with special attention to development of clear treatment guidelines in 
order to effectively manage co-morbid mental illnesses and physical health 
problems.

Using official data, this study analyzed violent deaths (homicide, suicide, 
events of undetermined intent and deaths due to legal intervention) in Brazil 
and Mexico in the three-year periods 2002-2004 and 2012-14, the impact of these 
causes of death on life expectancy in both countries and the role of the 
different age groups in years of life expectancy lost (YLEL). Abridged life 
tables were constructed for both countries for both periods. Temporary life 
expectancy and YLEL between zero and 80 years by selected causes and age groups 
were calculated for each triennium. The leading cause of YLEL among men was 
homicide in both periods in Brazil (1.5 years) and in the second period in 
Mexico (one year). Violent deaths (VD) accounted for around 16% of YLEL in 
Brazil and 13% in Mexico in 2012-2014. Among women, YLEL due to homicides and 
suicides showed the greatest relative increase in both countries, although VD 
accounted for barely 3% of total YLEL. The highest percentage of YLEL due to 
VDwas found among the 15 to 29 year age groups in both countries and for both 
sexes. The increase in rates of VD in Mexico, above all among young people, has 
curbed further increases in life expectancy in recent years, especially among 
men. Likewise, the high rates of VD in Brazil in both periods have hindered the 
growth of life expectancy.

The increase of firearm mortality and its relationship with the stagnation of 
life expectancy in Mexico.

This study analyzes firearms mortality (FA) and their impact on life expectancy 
in Mexico -compared to other causes of deaths- during the three-year periods 
2000-2002 and 2010-2012 and the weight of the different age groups in years of 
life expectancy lost (YLEL) due to this cause. Based on official death and 
population data, abridged life tables in Mexico were constructed for the 
three-year periods studied. Temporary life expectancy and YLEL for aged 15 to 75 
by selected causes and age groups were calculated in each three-year period. 
Among men, FA mortality went from being the cause less YLEL caused in 2000-2002 
to be the main cause of YLEL between 15 and 75 years in 2010-2012. Among women, 
YLEL for FA mortality had a higher relative growth. In both sexes, the greatest 
increase in YLEL by FA mortality was between 20 and 34 years. Findings indicate 
that the increase in FA mortality, especially among young people, has 
substantially contributed to the stagnation of life expectancy in recent years, 
and even his decline in the case of men. This reflects that violence linked to 
the FA is not only a security problem but also a collective health problem that 
must be copied in an interdisciplinary and intersectoral form if it is to 
increase the life expectancy of the country.

Background: Lipegfilgrastim (Lonquex®) has demonstrated to be non-inferior to 
pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) in reducing the duration of severe neutropenia (SN) in 
patients with stage II-IV breast cancer. Compared to pegfilgrastim, 
lipegfilgrastim also demonstrated statistically significant lower time to ANC 
recovery in cycles 1-3, lower incidence of SN in cycle 2 and lower depth of 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir in cycles 2 and 3. The aim of this study 
was to quantify the cost utility of lipegfilgrastim compared to pegfilgrastim in 
stage II-IV breast cancer patients, taking the perspective of the Belgian payer 
over a lifetime horizon. Methods: Two Markov models were developed to track on- 
and post-chemotherapy related complications, including SN, febrile neutropenia 
(FN), chemotherapy dose delay, chemotherapy relative dose intensity of less than 
85%, infection, death rates, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Data on 
costs (2015 value) and effects were obtained from literature, national 
references, and complemented by a survey of clinical experts using a modified 
Delphi method. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
carried out. Outcomes measures included costs, QALYs and life-years (LY). 
Results: At current equivalent price of €1,169, treatment with lipegfilgrastim 
was associated with overall costs of €9,845 vs. €10,208 for pegfilgrastim and 
overall QALYs of 13.977 vs. 13.925 for pegfilgrastim. Life expectancy was 
increased by 21 days (or 0.058 LY gained). The difference in costs stem from 
avoided infection, SN and FN cases in the lipegfilgrastim compared to the 
pegfilgrastim group. Similarly, the difference in QALYs was explained by the 
difference in the number of patients in the chemotherapy/G-CSF Markov state 
followed by infection and FN between lipegfilgrastim and pegfilgrastim. The 
probability of lipegfilgrastim to be cost-effective compared to pegfilgrastim 
was 68, 79, and 83% at the willingness-to-pay thresholds (WTP) of €10,000, 
€30,000 and €50,000 per QALY gained, respectively. At a WTP threshold of €30,000 
per QALY gained, lipegfilgrastim was cost-effective up to €1,500 across all age 
bands and cancer stages, compared to the current price. Conclusions: 
Lipegfilgrastim is a cost-effective use of health care resources in patients 
with stage II-IV breast cancer.

Heart-Rate Variability-More than Heart Beats?

Ernst G(1).

Viken Hospital Trust, Kongsberg, Norway.

Heart-rate variability (HRV) is frequently introduced as mirroring imbalances 
within the autonomous nerve system. Many investigations are based on the 
paradigm that increased sympathetic tone is associated with decreased 
parasympathetic tone and vice versa. But HRV is probably more than an indicator 
for probable disturbances in the autonomous system. Some perturbations trigger 
not reciprocal, but parallel changes of vagal and sympathetic nerve activity. 
HRV has also been considered as a surrogate parameter of the complex interaction 
between brain and cardiovascular system. Systems biology is an 
inter-disciplinary field of study focusing on complex interactions within 
biological systems like the cardiovascular system, with the help of 
computational models and time series analysis, beyond others. Time series are 
considered surrogates of the particular system, reflecting robustness or 
fragility. Increased variability is usually seen as associated with a good 
health condition, whereas lowered variability might signify pathological 
changes. This might explain why lower HRV parameters were related to decreased 
life expectancy in several studies. Newer integrating theories have been 
proposed. According to them, HRV reflects as much the state of the heart as the 
state of the brain. The polyvagal theory suggests that the physiological state 
dictates the range of behavior and psychological experience. Stressful events 
perpetuate the rhythms of autonomic states, and subsequently, behaviors. Reduced 
variability will according to this theory not only be a surrogate but represent 
a fundamental homeostasis mechanism in a pathological state. The neurovisceral 
integration model proposes that cardiac vagal tone, described in HRV beyond 
others as HF-index, can mirror the functional balance of the neural networks 
implicated in emotion-cognition interactions. Both recent models represent a 
more holistic approach to understanding the significance of HRV.

People in modern, affluent societies are living longer but also becoming 
increasingly overweight. With increased life expectancy comes increased risk of 
developing age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases, such 
that an increasing proportion of life may be lived with cognitive impairment as 
age increases. Obesity is associated with poorer cognitive function in elderly 
subjects, and often leads to ill-health arising from various complications such 
as metabolic syndrome and type-2 diabetes mellitus. This chapter provides an 
overview of the effects of administering pan-phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) 
inhibitors to animal models of cognitive ageing, Alzheimer's disease, 
frontotemporal dementia, fragile X syndrome, obesity and diabetes. Inhibition of 
the PDE4B subtype specifically is discussed as an approach to avoid the emetic 
side effects of pan-PDE4 inhibitors, whilst retaining their therapeutic effects. 
Finally, the findings of rodent studies that employ genetic and pharmacological 
approaches to specifically target PDE4B are discussed in relation to the 
potential utility of PDE4B-selective inhibitors for the treatment of cognitive 
impairment and obesity-related metabolic diseases.

Neck of femur fractures are occurring at an increased incidence. Functionally 
independent patients without cognitive impairment can expect reasonable life 
expectancy. This indicates the need for a durable surgical option that optimises 
the chance to return to pre-injury functional status, with minimal risk of 
complications and reoperation. Most fractures are displaced. Surgical options 
include internal fixation, hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty (THA). 
Evidence is conclusive that arthroplasty options outperform internal fixation in 
terms of function, quality of life and reoperation rates. In anyone other than 
young patients where head preserving surgery is required, arthroplasty is the 
standard of care. Hemiarthroplasty is the heavily favoured arthroplasty option 
for surgeons. However, in patients other than the extreme elderly, medically 
infirm, neurologically impaired, or with little or no ambulatory capacity, the 
evidence to support hemiarthroplasty is lacking. In functionally independent 
patients without cognitive impairment, THA should be considered the gold 
standard, producing better functional and quality of life outcomes, lower 
reoperation rates and better cost effectiveness, with no difference in 
complications or mortality. An increased risk of dislocation does exist. This 
may be reduced with modern surgical technique and implant options. Low amounts 
of research have been afforded to undisplaced fractures. For this fracture type, 
surgery is the standard of care. Despite a higher risk of reoperation, internal 
fixation is the preferred option for all age groups. Further study is required 
to identify the difference between internal fixation and THA, in particular, for 
unstable fracture patterns in elderly patients.

Cancer cells share several metabolic traits, including aerobic production of 
lactate from glucose (Warburg effect), extensive glutamine utilization and 
impaired mitochondrial electron flow. It is still unclear how these metabolic 
rearrangements, which may involve different molecular events in different cells, 
contribute to a selective advantage for cancer cell proliferation. To ascertain 
which metabolic pathways are used to convert glucose and glutamine to balanced 
energy and biomass production, we performed systematic constraint-based 
simulations of a model of human central metabolism. Sampling of the feasible 
flux space allowed us to obtain a large number of randomly mutated cells 
simulated at different glutamine and glucose uptake rates. We observed that, in 
the limited subset of proliferating cells, most displayed fermentation of 
glucose to lactate in the presence of oxygen. At high utilization rates of 
glutamine, oxidative utilization of glucose was decreased, while the production 
of lactate from glutamine was enhanced. This emergent phenotype was observed 
only when the available carbon exceeded the amount that could be fully oxidized 
by the available oxygen. Under the latter conditions, standard Flux Balance 
Analysis indicated that: this metabolic pattern is optimal to maximize biomass 
and ATP production; it requires the activity of a branched TCA cycle, in which 
glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation cooperates to the production of 
lipids and proteins; it is sustained by a variety of redox-controlled metabolic 
reactions. In a K-ras transformed cell line we experimentally assessed 
glutamine-induced metabolic changes. We validated computational results through 
an extension of Flux Balance Analysis that allows prediction of metabolite 
variations. Taken together these findings offer new understanding of the logic 
of the metabolic reprogramming that underlies cancer cell growth.

The 2011 Fukushima disaster led to increases in multiple risks (e.g., lifestyle 
diseases and radiation exposure) and fear among the public. Here, we assessed 
the additional risks of cancer caused by radiation and diabetes related to the 
disaster and the cost-effectiveness of countermeasures against these conditions. 
Our study included residents of the cities of Minamisoma and Soma (10-40 km and 
35-50 km north of the Fukushima Daiichi (N° 1) Nuclear Power Station, 
respectively). We used the loss of life expectancy (LLE) as an indicator to 
compare risks between radiation exposure and diabetes. We also estimated the 
cost-effectiveness of radiation-related countermeasures, including restricted 
food distribution, decontamination, and whole-body counter tests and 
interventions. Metformin therapy was selected as a representative management for 
diabetes. The diabetes-related LLEs among residents were 4.1 (95% confidence 
interval: 1.4-6.8) ×10-2 years for the whole population and 8.0 (2.7-13.2) ×10-2 
years for 40s to 70s in a scenario that considered the additional incidence of 
diabetes during the first 10 years. The cancer-related LLEs caused by lifetime 
exposure to radiation were 0.69 (2.5-97.5 percentile: 0.61-0.79) ×10-2 years for 
the whole population and 0.24 (0.20-0.29) ×10-2 years for 40s to 70s. The 
diabetes-related LLEs among residents in the above-mentioned scenario were 
5.9-fold and 33-fold higher than those attributed to average radiation among the 
whole population and among the 40s to 70s age groups, respectively. The costs 
per life-years saved of the radiation countermeasures (i.e., restricted food 
distribution, decontamination, and whole-body counter tests and interventions) 
were >1 to >4 orders of magnitude higher than those of general heath checkups 
and conventional management for diabetes. Our findings indicate that 
countermeasures to mitigate diabetes are warranted. Policy-makers' and 
individuals' understanding of multiple risks after any disaster will be 
essential to saving the lives of victims.

Life expectancy versus lifespan inequality: A smudge or a clear relationship?

Németh L(1).

Author information:
(1)Laboratory of Survival and Longevity, Max Planck Institute for Demographic 
Research, Rostock, Germany.

Interest in inequality, including lifespan inequality, is growing. Several 
studies, using various measures of variation in the length of life, reveal that 
as life expectancy increases, lifespan inequality tends to decrease, albeit with 
considerable variation across populations and over time. The aim of this article 
is to understand why the strength of the relationship between life expectancy 
and lifespan inequality varies across publications. Results differ in large part 
because they are based on different data sources. In addition, some measures 
show more smudginess than others. All the analyses presented here support the 
basic finding of a strong relationship between life expectancy and lifespan 
inequality.
