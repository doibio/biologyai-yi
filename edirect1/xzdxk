BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy has improved life expectancy among people 
living with HIV (PLWH). Despite increased longevity, PLWH are at increased risk 
of age-related comorbidities, including frailty. We examined the relationship 
between body composition and frailty among PLWH, and moderation of this 
relationship by substance use, physical activity (PA), and physical function.
METHODS: Participants (n = 341; 71% male, 48 ± 10 years, body mass index 
(BMI) = 27.3 ± 7.0 kg/m2 ) enrolled in the New Orleans Alcohol Use in HIV (NOAH) 
study underwent measures of body composition, muscle strength, and gait speed. 
Whole blood phosphatidylethanol (PEth) was measured, and substance use and PA 
were self-reported. Frailty risk measures included the 58-Item Deficit Index 
(DI58) and the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Index 1.0, where higher scores 
indicate greater frailty risk.
RESULTS: Multivariable linear regression adjusted for age, sex, and race showed 
that higher fat-free mass index (FFMI), body fat (%), waist-to-hip ratio, and 
body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25.0 kg/m2 vs. < 25.0 kg/m2 were significantly 
(p < 0.05) associated with decreased frailty risk measured by the VACS Index, 
whereas adjusted analyses showed no association between body composition 
variables and the DI58 score. Recent alcohol use, muscle strength, and PA, but 
not lifetime alcohol use or gait speed, significantly moderated associations 
between body composition variables and frailty risk with medium-to-large effect 
sizes. Subgroup analyses revealed a negative relationship between DI58 and FFMI 
among people with PEth > 8 ng/ml and negative relationships of VACS Index with 
FFMI and WHR in people with lower muscle strength. Overweight or obese BMI 
categories were positively associated with DI58 in people with lower muscle 
strength or higher PA level but negatively associated in those with higher 
muscle strength.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that body composition has significant 
modulatory effects on frailty risk in PLWH, where obesity increases the risk of 
frailty and greater muscle mass may be protective, even in individuals who use 
alcohol. These results highlight the importance of considering body composition, 
physical activity, and physical function in assessing frailty risk in PLWH, 
particularly among individuals who use alcohol. Moreover, they support the 
implementation of physical activity interventions to ameliorate the risk of 
frailty in aging PLWH.

PURPOSE: To investigate whether the rate of Anti-Osteoporosis Medication (AOM) 
dispensing was related to prevalence of risk factors and hip fracture incidence 
in the local population.
METHODS: The Open Prescribing database was used to analyse dispensed AOM at the 
level of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England. Male Healthy Life 
Expectancy (MHLE), Female Healthy Life Expectancy (FHLE), the prevalence of 
smoking and active adults, the incidence of hip fracture and of alcohol related 
hospital admissions, and local dispensing of a comparator drug (atorvastatin) 
were considered as predictor variables. Linear and multilinear regression were 
performed. Using atorvastatin as a comparator, AOM dispensing was compared after 
the start of the Covid-19 pandemic with the same quarter the previous year.
RESULTS: Rates of AOM per 1000 people aged over 65 years in a CCG area varied 
between 379.2 and 1129.1, with a mean of 670.3. Population risk factors were 
individually related to the amount of AOM dispensed in an area. Collectively, 
local activity levels in adults (p = 0.042) and local hip fracture incidence 
(p = 0.003) were significantly negatively correlated with rates of AOM 
dispensed. Rates of alendronate dispensing fell significantly at the start of 
the Covid-19 pandemic (p < 0.001), whilst atorvastatin dispensing rates 
significantly increased (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Lower rates of AOM dispensing were seen in areas with a higher 
proportion of active adults and higher incidence of hip fracture. 
Multidisciplinary services should be developed to address this care gap with 
consideration given to local population risk factors. Community pharmacists are 
ideally placed to play a vital role in osteoporosis management.

Histone methylation plays crucial roles in the development, gene regulation, and 
maintenance of stem cell pluripotency in mammals. Recent work shows that histone 
methylation is associated with aging, yet the underlying mechanism remains 
unclear. In this work, we identified a class of putative histone 3 lysine 9 
mono/dimethyltransferase genes (met-2, set-6, set-19, set-20, set-21, set-32, 
and set-33), mutations in which induce synergistic lifespan extension in the 
long-lived DAF-2 (insulin growth factor 1 [IGF-1] receptor) mutant in 
Caenorhabditis elegans. These putative histone methyltransferase plus daf-2 
double mutants not only exhibited an average lifespan nearly three times that of 
wild-type animals and a maximal lifespan of approximately 100 days, but also 
significantly increased resistance to oxidative and heat stress. Synergistic 
lifespan extension depends on the transcription factor DAF-16 (FOXO). mRNA-seq 
experiments revealed that the mRNA levels of DAF-16 Class I genes, which are 
activated by DAF-16, were further elevated in the daf-2;set double mutants. 
Among these genes, tts-1, F35E8.7, ins-35, nhr-62, sod-3, asm-2, and Y39G8B.7 
are required for the lifespan extension of the daf-2;set-21 double mutant. In 
addition, treating daf-2 animals with the H3K9me1/2 methyltransferase G9a 
inhibitor also extends lifespan and increases stress resistance. Therefore, 
investigation of DAF-2 and H3K9me1/2 deficiency-mediated synergistic longevity 
will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aging 
and therapeutic applications.

BACKGROUND: With the aging of society and increasingly longer of life 
expectancy, elderly patients with esophageal cancer are more commonly 
encountered. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for operative 
mortality after esophagectomy in elderly patients.
METHODS: We used data from the National Clinical Database of Japan. After 
cleaning the data, 10,633 records obtained from 861 hospitals were analyzed. A 
risk model for operative mortality was developed using risk factors from the 
entire study population. Then, odds ratios (OR) were compared between age 
categories using this risk model.
RESULTS: In this study, 1959 (18.4%) patients were ≥ 75 years (defined as 
"elderly" in this study). Eighteen variables, including T4b, N2-N3, and M1 in 
the TNM classification, were included in the risk model for operative mortality. 
The ORs increased in age categories < 65, 65-74, and ≥ 75 years for N2-N3 
(1.172, 1.200, and 1.588, respectively), and M1 (2.189, 3.164, and 4.430, 
respectively). Based on these results, we also focused on residual tumors, which 
are caused by extensive tumor development. The operative mortality in the 
elderly group with residual tumors increased to more than twice than that in the 
non-elderly groups (15.9 vs. 5.5 or 6.5%) and was much higher than that in 
elderly patients without residual tumors (15.9 vs. 4.6%).
CONCLUSION: We should carefully select the treatment for elderly patients with 
highly advanced tumors, which result in N2-N3 and M1, to avoid unfavorable 
short-term outcomes. In addition, R0 resection is important in preventing 
operative mortality among elderly patients.

In the contemporary world, environmental degradation has become a concern for 
human beings. Accordingly, the impact of social welfare, economic policy 
uncertainty, natural resource rents, life expectancy, and trade openness are 
examined on ecological footprint (the most comprehensive proxy of environmental 
degradation) in 19 energy-intensive countries from 1997 to 2018. With this in 
mind, this study used the traditional panel ARDL and CS-ARDL approaches to 
evaluate how the study's variables influence ecological footprint. Notably, the 
results of the CS-ARDL approach are more robust due to cross-sectional 
dependence and slope heterogeneity problems. The outcomes revealed that economic 
policy uncertainty and trade openness affect the ecological footprint negatively 
in the short run and positively in the long run. Moreover, social welfare 
degrades the environment in the long run, and natural resource rents improve 
environmental quality by mitigating the ecological footprint in the short run 
and harming the environment in the long run. Besides, life expectancy does not 
significantly affect ecological footprint in the long or short run. Meanwhile, 
the results confirmed the bi-directional causal relationship between the study's 
variable and ecological footprint. Based on the outcomes, the way to adopt 
effective policies to improve the quality of the environment has been paved. 
Furthermore, a comprehensive policy framework for stricter environmental 
regulation is expected to be developed using the outcomes derived from this 
study.

INTRODUCTION: This phase III study aimed to compare the efficacy, safety, and 
immunogenicity of SCT630 with the reference adalimumab.
METHODS: A total of 367 Chinese patients with moderate-to-severe plaque 
psoriasis were randomly assigned to receive 80 mg of SCT630 or adalimumab 
subcutaneously at week 1, 40 mg at week 2, then 40 mg biweekly. At week 16, 
those with 50 % or more improvement in psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) 
were eligible to enter an extension period up to week 52. Patients on SCT630 
continued the same treatment, whereas patients receiving adalimumab were 
re-randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to adalimumab or SCT630 group. The primary 
endpoint was percentage improvement in PASI at week 16. Other endpoints included 
PASI 50/75/90/100, Physician's Global Assessment, Dermatology Life Quality 
Index, safety, and immunogenicity.
RESULTS: PASI improvement at week 16 was 85.07 % for SCT630 and 84.82 % for 
adalimumab. The mean difference (3.10 %, 95 % CI: -1.875 %, 8.066 %) was within 
the equivalence interval. Other efficacy endpoints, safety and immunogenicity 
profiles were similar across the two groups. There were no safety or 
immunogenicity difference between switched/continued groups.
CONCLUSION: This phase III study demonstrated the equivalences in efficacy, 
safety and immunogenicity of SCT630 to adalimumab in patients with moderate to 
severe psoriasis.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Bouveret's syndrome is a very rare form of 
gallstone ileus, that occurs when a sizable gallstone enters the 
gastrointestinal tract via a bilioenteric fistula and is impacted in the pylorus 
or proximal duodenum, causing gastric outlet obstruction. It usually occurs in a 
geriatric population with multiple comorbidities, and causes significant 
morbidities and mortalities.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 88-year-old patient with concomitant Bouveret's syndrome 
and biliary obstruction was presented. The duodenal obstructed stone and biliary 
stone were successfully removed by endoscopic approach. The patient resumed diet 
on day-1 and recovered smoothly.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Due to the rarity of Bouveret's syndrome, there are no 
standardized recommendations for the management of these patients, including 
open, laparoscopic surgical approach or endoscopic approach. Minimally invasive 
treatment was tailored to the condition of the patient and clinical findings.
CONCLUSION: The best approach is the one tailored to each patient, with the 
consideration of the patient's medical condition, age, comorbidities, life 
expectancy, and available expertise. This article highlights the key features of 
the disease, and the precautions during endoscopic treatment.

[The broad spectrum of sickle cell disease: HbSC in everyday clinical practice].

[Article in German]

Dickerhoff R.

Sickle cell disease has come to Germany from the Mediterranean region, Africa 
and the Middle East since the 1950 s and initially mainly concerned 
paediatricians. Since the 1970 s, the life expectancy of those affected has 
risen significantly, and about 95 % now live to adulthood. Therefore, general 
practitioners and internists should be familiar with the different forms of 
sickle cell disease, especially HbSC disease (approx. 20 %).A precise diagnosis 
of sickle cell disease (exact phenotype) is essential; the term "sickle cell 
anaemia" must be avoided. In patients of African origin with microcytosis, 
slightly elevated reticulocytes and pain symptomatology, the possibility of HbSC 
disease should be considered - even with age-appropriate haemoglobin values. 
Annual retinoscopy is recommended for HbSC patients from the age of 7, and for 
all other sickle cell patients from the age of 10. If a hearing loss occurs in 
an HbSC patient, phlebotomy should be performed immediately. In all sickle cell 
patients with dizziness or pain and an Hb > 10 g/dl, phlebotomy is indicated.

INTRODUCTION: Providing comprehensive stroke care poses major organisational and 
financial challenges to the German healthcare system. The quasi-randomised 
TEMPiS-Flying Intervention Team (TEMPiS-FIT) study aims to close the gap in the 
treatment of patients who had ischaemic stroke in rural areas of Southeast 
Bavaria by flying a team of interventionalists via helicopter directly to 
patients in the regional TEMPiS hospitals instead of transporting the patients 
to the next comprehensive stroke centre. The objective of the present paper is 
to describe the methods for the economic evaluation 
(TEMPiS-Gesundheitsökonomische Analyse (TEMPiS-GÖA)) alongside the TEMPiS-FIT 
study to determine whether the new form of care is cost-effective compared with 
standard care.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and 
cost-utility analysis (CUA) will be performed from a statutory health insurance 
perspective as well as from a societal perspective over the time horizon of 12 
months after the patients' hospital discharge. Direct costs from outpatient and 
inpatient care are collected from routine data of the participating health 
insurance funds, while medical and non-medical costs from a patient's 
perspective are retrieved from primary data collected during the TEMPiS-FIT 
study and follow-up questionnaires. Results will be presented as incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio and incremental cost-utility ratio quantifying the 
incremental costs and health benefits compared with standard care practice. The 
outcome of the CEA will be measured in costs per minute reduction in mean 
process time to thrombectomy. The outcome of the CUA will be presented as costs 
per quality-adjusted life year gained.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the TEMPiS-FIT study was granted 
by the Bavarian State Medical Association Ethics Committee (# 17056). Results 
will be disseminated via reports, presentations of the results in publications 
and at conferences and on the TEMPiS website.

The Covid-19 pandemic has not affected the population evenly. This must be 
acknowledged when it comes to understanding the Covid-19 death toll and 
answering the question of how many life years have been lost. We use level of 
geriatric care to account for variation in remaining life expectancy among 
individuals that died during 2020. Based on a linkage of administrative 
registers, we estimate remaining life expectancy stratified by age, sex, and 
care status using an incidence-based multistate model and analyze the number of 
years of life lost (YLL) during 2020 in Sweden. Our results show that remaining 
life expectancy between individuals with and without care differs substantially. 
More than half of all Covid-19 deaths had a remaining life expectancy lower than 
4 years. Yet, in a 1-year perspective, Covid-19 did not seem to replace other 
causes of death. Not considering the differences in remaining life expectancy in 
the affected populations overestimated YLL by 40% for women and 30% for men, or 
around 2 years per death. While the unadjusted YLL from Covid-19 amounted to an 
average of 7.5 years for women and 8.6 years for men, the corresponding YLL 
adjusted for care status were 5.4 and 6.6, respectively. The total number of YLL 
to Covid-19 in 2020 is comparable to YLL from ischemic heart disease in 2019 and 
2020. Our results urge the use of subgroup specific mortality when counting the 
burden of Covid-19. YLL are considerably reduced when the varying susceptibility 
for death is considered, but even if most lifespans were cut in the last years 
of life, the YLL are still substantial.

BACKGROUND: Patients with glioblastoma have a short life-expectancy, with median 
survival rates of 9 to 12 months. Providing information about the expected 
course of the disease can be complicated. Therefore, an online tool has been 
developed. The objective of this tool is to better inform patients and proxies, 
and decrease their uncertainties and improve their quality of life. This study 
aims to gather experiences of an initial cohort of patient-proxy dyads, to 
identify if the tool meets the previously mentioned objectives.
METHODS: This is a qualitative study based on thematic analysis. Interviews were 
conducted with 15 patient-proxy dyads. For these interviews, a combined method 
of think-aloud sessions and semi-structured interviews were used. Audiotapes of 
these interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed four major themes, namely, unmet information 
needs, improvement possibilities, effects of the tool and clinical 
implementation. Participants indicated that this tool could decrease 
uncertainties and increase their perceived quality of life. Also, they often 
mentioned that it could have a positive effect on the efficiency and quality of 
consultations.
CONCLUSION: Participants considered this tool to be useful and effective in 
decreasing uncertainties for both patients with glioblastoma and their proxies. 
Moreover, participants brought up that this tool could positively influence the 
efficiency and quality of consultations. This could lead to more patient 
participation and empowerment, and could therefore enhance shared decision 
making and timely advanced care planning.

BACKGROUND: Neonatal Marfan syndrome (nMFS), the most severe form of Marfan 
syndrome, is a rare condition that presents a clinical and treatment challenge. 
nMFS has high infant mortality related to progressive valvular dysfunction. 
Valve replacement in this setting improves long-term prognosis but carries high 
morbidity and mortality. Thus, sharing clinical experience in treating such 
patients is valuable.
CASE SUMMARY: A 2 year old with nMFS underwent tricuspid valve annuloplasty and 
prosthetic mitral valve replacement. Postoperative management was complicated by 
pulmonary hypertension, cardiogenic shock, and arrythmias. Venoarterial 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) helped overcome these challenges 
but posed a high risk for prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT). Despite 
decompression of the left atrium (LA) with an LA vent, the left ventricle (LV) 
was distended because of aortic regurgitation and no native cardiac output. We 
lowered the ECMO flow under echocardiographic guidance; used inodilators and 
pacing to encourage transmitral flow and reduce LV afterload. The patient 
completed a successful 6-day ECMO run with good end-organ perfusion. At last 
follow up, she was 6 years old, enjoying school, home-ventilated through the 
tracheostomy, and mobilizing with walking aids/wheelchair.
DISCUSSION: Valve replacement can improve life quality and expectancy for 
patients with nMFS. Lowering ECMO flow under echocardiography guidance till the 
aortic valve is seen to open; coupled with inodilators, pacing and adequate 
anticoagulation can be a safe way to deliver VA-ECMO for cardiogenic shock after 
prosthetic valve replacement. Further research is needed to show if this 
strategy prevents prosthetic valve thrombosis and provides sufficient 
haemodynamic support and myocardial rest.

Neonatal stroke is a devastating condition that causes brain injury in babies 
and often leads to lifelong neurological impairment. Recent prospective 
population studies of neonatal stroke are lacking. Neonatal strokes are 
different from those in older children and adults. A better understanding of its 
aetiology, current management, and outcomes could reduce the burden of this rare 
condition. The study aims to explore the incidence and 2 year outcomes of 
neonatal stroke across an entire population in the UK and Republic of Ireland. 
This is an active national surveillance study using a purpose-built integrated 
case notification-data collection online platform. Over a 13 month period, with 
a potential 6 month extension, clinicians will notify neonatal stroke cases 
presenting in the first 90 days of life electronically via the online platform 
monthly. Clinicians will complete a primary questionnaire via the platform 
detailing clinical information, including neuroimaging, for analysis and 
classification. An outcome questionnaire will be sent at 2 years of age via the 
platform. Appropriate ethics and regulatory approvals have been received. The 
neonatal stroke study represents the first multinational population surveillance 
study delivered via a purpose-built integrated case notification-data collection 
online platform and data safe haven, overcoming the challenges of setting up the 
study.

INTRODUCTIONS: The spine is one of the most common sites of metastasis for 
malignancies. This study aimed to compare the predictive performance of seven 
commonly used prognostic scoring systems for surgically treated spine 
metastases. It is expected to assist surgeons in selecting appropriate scoring 
systems to support clinical decision-making and better inform patients.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study involving 268 surgically treated 
patients with spine metastases between 2017 and 2020 at a single regional 
oncology center in China. The revised Tokuhashi, Tomita, modified Bauer, revised 
Katagiri, van der Linden, Skeletal Oncology Research Group (SORG) nomogram, and 
SORG machine-learning (ML) scoring systems were externally validated. The area 
under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to 
evaluate sensitivity and specificity at different postoperative time points. The 
actual survival time was compared with the reference survival time provided in 
the original publication.
RESULTS: In the present study, the median survival was 16.6 months. The SORG ML 
scoring system demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting 90-day (AUC: 
0.743) and 1-year survival (AUC: 0.787). The revised Katagiri demonstrated the 
highest accuracy (AUC: 0.761) in predicting 180-day survival. The revised 
Katagiri demonstrated the highest accuracy (AUC: 0.779) in predicting 2-year 
survival. Based on this series, the actual life expectancy was underestimated 
compared with the original reference survival time.
CONCLUSIONS: None of the scoring systems can perform optimally at all time 
points and for all pathology types, and the reference survival times provided in 
the original study need to be updated. A cautious awareness of the 
underestimation by these models is of paramount importance in relation to 
current patients.

Renal artery aneurysmal (RAA) disease is a rare, but potentially 
life-threatening cause of renovascular disease presenting with hypertension. 
Conventional management involves aneurysmal excision followed by renal 
auto-transplantation. We present the management of a 13-year-old girl with 
complex multiple saccular aneurysmal disease of the left renal artery with hilar 
extension and symptomatic hypertension. We used 3D printing to print a 
patient-specific model that was not implanted in the patient but was used for 
surgical planning and discussion with the patient and their family. Endovascular 
options were precluded due to anatomical complexities. Following 
multi-disciplinary review and patient-specific 3D printing, she underwent 
successful in-situ RAA repair with intraoperative cooling, without the need for 
auto-transplantation. 3D printing enabled appreciation of aneurysmal spatial 
configuration and dimensions that also helped plan the interposition graft 
length needed following aneurysmal excision. The models provided informed 
multidisciplinary communications and proved valuable during the consent process 
with the family for this high-risk procedure. To our knowledge, this is the 
first reported case utilizing 3D printing to facilitate in-situ complex repair 
of RAA with intra-hilar extension for paediatric renovascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major cause of early death 
worldwide. By 2030, 14.5 million people will have end-stage kidney disease 
(ESKD, or CKD stage 5), yet only 5.4 million will receive kidney replacement 
therapy (KRT) due to economic, social, and political factors. Even for those who 
are offered KRT by various means of dialysis, the life expectancy remains far 
too low.
OBSERVATION: Researchers from different fields of artificial organs collaborate 
to overcome the challenges of creating products such as Wearable and/or 
Implantable Artificial Kidneys capable of providing long-term effective 
physiologic kidney functions such as removal of uremic toxins, electrolyte 
homeostasis, and fluid regulation. A focus should be to develop easily 
accessible, safe, and inexpensive KRT options that enable a good quality of life 
and will also be available for patients in less-developed regions of the world.
CONCLUSIONS: Hence, it is required to discuss some of the limits and burdens of 
transplantation and different techniques of dialysis, including those performed 
at home. Furthermore, hurdles must be considered and overcome to develop 
wearable and implantable artificial kidney devices that can help to improve the 
quality of life and life expectancy of patients with CKD.

It is important to understand the effects of rapid changes in weight on 
neuromuscular functions of combat athletes. The purpose of this case study was 
to investigate time-course changes in muscle strength, muscle size, and neural 
input during rapid weight loss in a professional boxer. One professional male 
boxer (26 yr) participated in two matches during measurements: welterweight 
(66.6 kg; weight loss: WL) and super welterweight (69.85 kg; control: CON). His 
muscle contraction properties and body composition were measured from 6 wk 
(baseline) before the matches to 1 wk after them. Maximal voluntary isometric 
knee extension torque, muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) of the vastus 
lateralis using ultrasound, and high-density surface electromyography of the 
vastus lateralis during submaximal ramp-up contraction were measured. Individual 
motor units were identified, and modified discharge rates were calculated from a 
regression line between the recruitment threshold and discharge rates at 60%-70% 
of maximum torque according to the baseline value. His body weights for WL and 
CON decreased from 70.80 and 71.42 kg at the baseline to 68.75 and 71.36 kg 
immediately before the matches, respectively. Muscle strength changed little for 
either match. For WL, skeletal muscle mass and mCSA decreased, but there was no 
decrease for CON. The modified motor unit discharge rate for WL increased 
immediately before the match compared with other periods but did not change for 
CON. After rapid weight loss, neural input increased to compensate for lost 
muscle mass, and muscle strength was maintained.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This case study 
found that neural input to muscle, which was evaluated by high-density surface 
electrocardiography, increased to compensate for the decline of body weight and 
muscle mass and to maintain muscle strength during rapid weight loss, while 
neuromuscular characteristics were not markedly changed during no significant 
weight loss.

Decades of Swedish Taxation Data.

As with many social transfer schemes, pension systems around the world are often 
progressive: individuals with lower incomes receive a higher percentage of their 
income as a subsequent pension. On the other hand, those with lower earnings 
have higher mortality and thus accumulate fewer years of pension income. Both of 
these opposing factors influence the progressiveness of pension systems. 
Empirical efforts to disentangle the effects of mortality inequality on lifetime 
pension inequality have been scarce. Using Swedish taxation data linked with 
death registers for 1970-2018, we study how education and preretirement earnings 
relate to lifetime pensions from age 60 onward and how mortality inequalities 
contribute to overall inequalities in lifetime pensions. The results show that a 
progressive replacement structure and mortality differences contribute to the 
overall distribution of pension payments over the life course. Up to one quarter 
of lifetime pension inequality is attributable to the greater longevity of 
socially advantaged groups-particularly among men. Hence, mortality inequalities 
are an important determinant of the overall degree of between-group income 
transfers in a pension system, but they are not as important as inequalities in 
prior earnings.

The global burden of neurodegenerative disorders is significantly increasing as 
life expectancy rises but currently there is no cure for these conditions. An 
extensive search on MEDLINE (PubMed) and PEDro databases was conducted selecting 
clinical trials, Randomized Controlled Trials, and longitudinal studies 
published in the last 20 years in order to highlight what evidence there is for 
a role of spa rehabilitative interventions for patients with neurodegenerative 
diseases, in terms of motor function, symptoms, and quality of life (QoL) 
improvement and cost-effectiveness. A total of 225 publications were analyzed. 
Only three manuscripts were selected for review because they matched the 
inclusion criteria. These studies demonstrated statistically significant 
differences in the outcomes evaluated among patients affected by Parkinson's 
disease after thermal rehabilitative treatments: motor function, balance, QoL, 
and psychological well-being statistically improved. In addition, rehabilitation 
in the spa setting seemed to be cost-effective for these patients. However, 
further studies are needed to define the role of spa rehabilitative 
interventions for these patients as the literature is still limited.
