expected benefits declined in subgroups with shorter life expectancies. 
Participants with <4 y of life expectancy had minimal gains of <0.05 LY and 
<0.03 QALYs from added medication. Accounting for injection-related disutility, 
GLP1RA use reduced QALYs (-0.03 QALYs [-0.04, -0.02]). Conclusions. While GLP1RA 
and SGLT2I have substantial health benefits for many older adults with type 2 
diabetes, benefits are not clinically significant in patients with <4 y of life 
expectancy. Life expectancy and patient preferences are important considerations 
when prescribing newer diabetes medications.
HIGHLIGHTS: On average, older adults benefit significantly from SGLT2I and 
GLP1RA use. However, the benefits of these drugs are not clinically significant 
among older patients with life expectancy less than 4 y.There is potential harm 
in injectable GLP1RA use in the oldest categories of adults with type 2 
diabetes.Heterogeneity in life expectancy and patient preferences for injectable 
versus oral medications are important to consider when prescribing newer 
diabetes medications.

Despite decades of advancement in the diagnosis and therapy of gliomas, the most 
malignant primary brain tumors, the overall survival rate is still dismal, and 
their post-treatment imaging appearance remains very challenging to interpret. 
Since the limitations of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 
distinction between recurrence and treatment effect have been recognized, a 
variety of advanced MR and functional imaging techniques including 
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), 
perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), as well as a variety of 
radiotracers for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron 
emission tomography (PET) have been investigated for this indication along with 
voxel-based and more quantitative analytical methods in recent years. Machine 
learning and radiomics approaches in recent years have shown promise in 
distinguishing between recurrence and treatment effect as well as improving 
prognostication in a malignancy with a very short life expectancy. This review 
provides a comprehensive overview of the conventional and advanced imaging 
techniques with the potential to differentiate recurrence from treatment effect 
and includes updates in the state-of-the-art in advanced imaging with a brief 
overview of emerging experimental techniques. A series of representative cases 
are provided to illustrate the synthesis of conventional and advanced imaging 
with the clinical context which informs the radiologic evaluation of gliomas in 
the post-treatment setting.

BACKGROUND: Intrathecal infusion therapy is widely accepted for cancer pain 
patients when conventional analgesic treatments are not sufficient. There are 
different types of devices for carrying out this therapy: partially externalized 
devices (PED), used when life expectancy is under 3 months, and totally 
implanted devices (TID), when it is larger. Our objective is to compare the 
efficacy, functionality, and complication rate in both types.
METHODS: We included 132 patients with mild-severe cancer pain, treated with 
intrathecal infusion therapy by fixed flow devices, PED, or TID, during the 
study time. Demographic, physical oncologic, and pain control data of the 
patients were recorded prior to starting therapy and at months 1, 3, and 6. 
Functionality status and complications were also collected from the patient's 
medical records and clinical files.
RESULTS: Pain control improved after starting therapy, with an overall reduction 
of 4.75 points in VAS score at 1 month in the both groups, without significant 
differences between them, keeping it at 3 months and 6. 33.3% of the patients 
developed complications and were more frequent in the PED group, being catheter 
dislocation the most common. Patients with TID required more often hospital 
admission to solve the complication.
CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal infusion therapy has been shown to be a very effective 
and safe therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe oncologic pain. There 
are no significant differences between PED and TID in terms of degree of pain 
control, therapeutic success, efficacy on episodic or nocturnal pain, or the 
presence of serious complications.

In this 'perspective' article, the pandemic and other examples are used to 
provide a basic explanation of the quality adjusted life year (QALY), when it 
can, and when it can't be used. QALYs are intended to compare the population 
health gains or losses of interventions, regardless of indication area. That 
information feeds into decision-making that aims to improve societal health 
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Increasing life expectancy is resulting in a growing demand for 
long-term care; however, there is a shortage of qualified health care 
professionals (HCPs) to deliver it. If used optimally, technology can provide a 
solution to this challenge. HCPs play an important role in the use of technology 
in long-term care. However, technology influences several core aspects of the 
work that HCPs do, and it is therefore important to have a good understanding of 
their viewpoint regarding the use of technology in daily practice of long-term 
care.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the factors that HCPs consider 
as relevant for using technology in daily practice of long-term care.
METHODS: In this qualitative study, 11 focus groups were organized with 73 HCPs. 
The focus group discussions were guided by an innovative game, which was 
specifically developed for this study. The content of the game was categorized 
into 4 categories: health care technology and me; health care technology, the 
patient, and me; health care technology, the organization, and me; and 
facilitating conditions. The perspectives of HCPs about working with technology 
were discussed based on this game. The focus groups were recorded and 
transcribed, followed by an inductive thematic analysis using ATLAS.ti 9x 
(ATLAS.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH).
RESULTS: Overall, 2 main domain summaries were developed from the data: 
technology should improve the quality of care and acceptance and use of 
technology in care. The first factor indicates the need for tailored and 
personalized care and balance between human contact and technology. The second 
factor addresses several aspects regarding working with technology such as 
trusting technology, learning to work with technology, and collaboration with 
colleagues.
CONCLUSIONS: HCPs are motivated to use technology in daily practice of long-term 
care when it adds value to the quality of care and there is sufficient trust, 
expertise, and collaboration with colleagues. Their perspectives need to be 
considered as they play a crucial part in the successful use of technology, 
transcending their role as an actor in implementation. On the basis of the 
findings from this study, we recommend focusing on developing technology for 
situations where both efficiency and quality of care can be improved; redefining 
the roles of HCPs and the impact of technology hereon; involving HCPs in the 
design process of technology to enable them to link it to their daily practice; 
and creating ambassadors in care teams who are enthusiastic about working with 
technology and can support and train their colleagues.

BACKGROUND: With the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, partly due to 
the increase in life expectancy and the aging of the population, the complexity 
of the approach faced by the structures, dynamics, and actors that are part of 
the current care and attention systems is evident. The territory of Bages 
(Catalonia, Spain) presents characteristics of a highly complex ecosystem where 
there is a need to develop new, more dynamic structures for the various actors 
in the health and social systems, aimed at incorporating new actors in the 
technological and business field that would allow innovation in the management 
of this context. Within the framework of the Bages Territorial Specialization 
and Competitiveness Project (PECT BAGESS), the aim is to address these 
challenges through various entities that will develop 7 interrelated operations. 
Of these, the operation of the IDIAP Jordi Gol-Catalan Health Institute focuses 
on the creation of a Laboratory for Statistics and Analysis of Dependence and 
Chronic Conditions in the Bages region, in the form of a database that will 
collect the most relevant information from the different environments that 
affect the management of chronic conditions and dependence: health, social, 
economic, and environment.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to create a laboratory for statistical, dependence, 
and chronic condition analysis in the Bages region, to determine the chronic 
conditions and conditions that generate dependence in the Bages area, in order 
to propose products and services that respond to the needs of people in these 
situations.
METHODS: PECT BAGESS originated from the Shared Agenda initiative, which was 
established in the Bages region with the goal of enhancing the quality of life 
and fostering social inclusion for individuals with chronic diseases. This study 
presents part of this broader project, consisting of the creation of a database. 
Data from chronic conditions and dependence service providers will be combined, 
using a unique identifier for the different sources of information. A thorough 
legal analysis was conducted to establish a secure data sharing mechanism among 
the entities participating in the project.
RESULTS: The laboratory will be a key piece in the structure generated in the 
environment of the PECT BAGESS, which will allow relevant information to be 
passed on from the different sectors involved to respond to the needs of people 
with chronic conditions and dependence, as well as to generate opportunities for 
products and services.
CONCLUSIONS: The emerging organizational dynamics and structures are expected to 
demonstrate a health and social management model that may have a remarkable 
impact on these sectors. Products and services developed may be very useful for 
generating synergies and facilitating the living conditions of people who can 
benefit from all these services. However, secure data sharing circuits must be 
considered.

BACKGROUND: Against the backdrop of population ageing, governments are facing 
the need to raise the statutory retirement age. In this context, the question 
arises whether these extra years added to working life would be spent in good 
health. As cancer represents a main contributor to premature retirement this 
study focuses on time trends and educational inequalities in cancer-free working 
life expectancy (WLE).
METHODS: The analyses are based on the data of a large German health insurer 
covering annually about 2 million individuals. Cancer-free WLE is calculated 
based on multistate life tables and reported for three periods: 2006-2008, 
2011-2013, and 2016-2018. Educational inequalities in 2011-2013 were assessed by 
two educational levels (8 to 11 years and 12 to 13 years of schooling).
RESULTS: While labour force participation increased, cancer incidence rates 
decreased over time. Cancer-free WLE at age 18 increased by 2.5 years in men and 
6.3 years in women (age 50: 1.3 years in men, 2.4 years in women) between the 
first and third period while increases in WLE after a cancer diagnosis remained 
limited. Furthermore, educational inequalities are substantial, with lower 
groups having lower cancer-free WLE. The proportion of cancer-free WLE in total 
WLE remained constant in women and younger men, while it decreased in men at 
higher working age.
CONCLUSION: The increase in WLE is accompanied by an increase in cancer-free 
WLE. However, the subgroups considered have not benefitted equally from this 
positive development. Among men at higher working age, WLE increased at a faster 
pace than cancer-free WLE. Particular attention should be paid to individuals 
with lower education and older men, as the general level and time trends in 
cancer-free WLE are less favourable.

BACKGROUND: In patients with intracranial aneurysm presenting with spontaneous 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 15% of them could be missed by the initial 
diagnostic imaging. Repeat delayed imaging can help to identify previously 
undetected aneurysms, however, the cost-effectiveness of this strategy remains 
uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of repeat 
delayed imaging in patients with SAH who had a negative result during their 
initial imaging.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs and 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for patients who received or not received 
repeat delayed imaging. The analyses were conducted from a healthcare 
perspective, with costs reported in UK pounds and expressed in 2020 values. 
Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the 
results.
RESULTS: The base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of repeat 
delayed imaging is £9,314 per QALY compared to no-repeat delayed imaging. This 
ICER is below the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
£20,000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. At the NICE willingness-to-pay 
threshold of £20,000 per QALY, the probability that repeat delayed imaging is 
most cost-effective is 0.81. The results are sensitive to age, the utility of 
survived patients with a favorable outcome, the sensitivity of repeat delayed 
imaging, and the prevalence of aneurysm.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that, in the UK, it is cost-effective to provide 
repeat delayed imaging using computed tomographic angiography (CTA) for patients 
with SAH who had a negative result in their initial imaging.

INTRODUCTION: While the Japanese long-term care insurance system supports an 
ageing society, there are concerns about the shortage of financial resources and 
labour force. Further, extending healthy life expectancy and narrowing the gap 
with the average life expectancy are important issues. In this study, we aimed 
to examine, over a 15-year period, the relationship between the total Kihon 
Checklist (t-KCL) score and age-specific deaths among late-stage older adults 
aged 75 and older who were not certified for long-term care insurance.
METHODS: The participants were older adults residing in Otawara City, Tochigi 
Prefecture, who were aged 75 years or older as of 2006. The participants, who 
were not certified by the long-term care insurance system, were asked to 
complete the KCL by a community welfare committee member. Based on their t-KCL 
scores, the participants were classified as robust (0-3 points), pre-frail (4-7 
points), and frail (≥8 points). The deaths of those aged 75-89 years who had 
completed the KCL were investigated. Information on deaths was obtained from 
local authorities. Statistics were examined for the risk of robust, pre-frail, 
and frail mortality using a Cox proportional hazards model with age and gender 
as covariates for the 75-79, 80-84, and 85-89 age groups.
RESULTS: Of the 7,924 participants, 3,423 (75-79 years: 1,990, 80-84 years: 
1,059, 85-89 years: 374) were ultimately eligible for the study. Of these, 2,450 
(75-79 years: 1,238, 80-84 years: 861, 85-89 years: 351) died over the 15-year 
study period. Hazard ratios for death in frailty as determined by the t-KCL 
score were 1.337 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.162-1.540) for the pre-frail 
group and 2.012 (95% CI, 1.7756-2.305) for the frail group at 75-79 years, 
respectively, compared with the robust group; 1.511 (95% CI, 1.271-1.797) at 
80-84 years only in the frail group; and 1.567 (95% CI, 1.140-2.154) at 85-89 
years, also in the frail group.
DISCUSSION: The relationship between frailty and mortality weakens after age 80. 
The results suggest that factors other than frailty may have a stronger 
influence on mortality risk after the age of 80.

As the human population of western North America continues to expand, widespread 
patterns of urban growth pose increasingly existential threats to certain wild 
stocks of Pacific salmon and steelhead (Oncorhynchus sp.). Rainfall previously 
absorbed into the soils of forests and grasslands falls instead on pavement and 
other hardened surfaces. This creates stormwater runoff that carries toxic 
metals, oil, and many other contaminants into salmon-bearing habitats. These 
include freshwater streams where coho salmon (O. kisutch) spawn in gravel beds. 
Coho salmon embryos develop within a thick eggshell (chorion) for weeks to 
months before hatching as alevins and ultimately emerging from the gravel as 
fry. Untreated urban runoff is highly toxic to older coho salmon 
(freshwater-resident juveniles and adult spawners), but the vulnerability of the 
earliest life stages remains poorly understood. To address this uncertainty, we 
fertilized eggs and raised them under an episodic stormwater exposure regimen, 
using runoff collected from a high-traffic arterial roadway from 15 discrete 
storm events. We monitored survival and morphological development, as well as 
molecular markers for contaminant exposure and cardiovascular stress. We also 
evaluated the benefit of treating runoff with green infrastructure (bioretention 
filtration) on coho salmon health and survival. Untreated runoff caused subtle 
sublethal toxicity in pre-hatch embryos with no mortality, followed by high 
rates of mortality from exposure at hatch. Bioretention filtration removed most 
measured contaminants (bacteria, dissolved metals, and polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons), and the treated effluent was considerably less toxic - notably 
preventing mortality at the alevin stage. Our findings indicate that untreated 
urban runoff poses an important threat to early life stage coho salmon, in terms 
of both acute and delayed-in-time mortality. Moreover, while inexpensive 
management strategies involving bioinfiltration are promising, future green 
infrastructure effectiveness research should emphasize sublethal metrics for 
contaminant exposure and adverse health outcomes in salmonids.

Lung transplant is an established treatment for patients with end-stage lung 
disease. As a result, there is increased demand for transplants. Despite 
improvements in pretransplant evaluation, surgical techniques, and postsurgical 
care, the average posttransplant life expectancy is only around 6.5 years. Early 
recognition of complications on imaging and treatment can improve survival. 
Knowledge of surgical techniques and imaging findings of surgical and 
nonsurgical complications is essential. This review covers surgical techniques 
and imaging appearance of postsurgical and nonsurgical complications, including 
allograft dysfunction, infections, neoplasms, and recurrence of primary lung 
disease.

INTRODUCTION: COVID-19-associated mortality remains difficult to estimate in 
sub-Saharan Africa because of the lack of comprehensive systems of death 
registration. Based on death registers referring to the capital city of 
Madagascar, we sought to estimate the excess mortality during the COVID-19 
pandemic and calculate the loss of life expectancy.
METHODS: Death records between 2016 and 2021 were used to estimate weekly excess 
mortality during the pandemic period. To infer its synchrony with circulation of 
SARS-CoV-2, a cross-wavelet analysis was performed. Life expectancy loss due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic was calculated by projecting mortality rates using the Lee 
and Carter model and extrapolating the prepandemic trends (1990-2019). 
Differences in life expectancy at birth were disaggregated by cause of death.
RESULTS: Peaks of excess mortality in 2020-21 were associated with waves of 
COVID-19. Estimates of all-cause excess mortality were 38.5 and 64.9 per 100 000 
inhabitants in 2020 and 2021, respectively, with excess mortality reaching ≥50% 
over 6 weeks. In 2021, we quantified a drop of 0.8 and 1.0 years in the life 
expectancy for men and women, respectively attributable to increased risks of 
death beyond the age of 60 years.
CONCLUSION: We observed high excess mortality during the pandemic period, in 
particular around the peaks of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Antananarivo. Our study 
highlights the need to implement death registration systems in low-income 
countries to document true toll of a pandemic.

With recent data demonstrating that lecanemab treatment can slow cognitive and 
functional decline in early symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD), it is widely 
anticipated that this drug and potentially other monoclonal antibody infusions 
targeting β-amyloid protein will imminently be realistic options for some 
patients with AD. Given that these new antiamyloid monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
are associated with nontrivial risks and burdens of treatment that are radically 
different from current mainstays of AD management, effectively and equitably 
translating their use to real-world clinical care will require systematic and 
practice-specific modifications to existing workflows and infrastructure. In 
this Emerging Issues in Neurology article, we provide practical guidance for a 
wide audience of neurology clinicians on logistic adaptations and decision 
making around emerging antiamyloid mAbs. Specifically, we briefly summarize the 
rationale and available evidence supporting antiamyloid mAb use in AD to 
facilitate appropriate communication with patients and care partners on 
potential benefits. We also discuss pragmatic approaches to optimizing patient 
selection and treatment monitoring, with a particular focus on the value of 
incorporating shared decision making and multidisciplinary collaboration. In 
addition, we review some of the recognized limitations of current knowledge and 
highlight areas of future evolution to guide the development of sustainable and 
flexible models for treatment and follow-up. As the field enters a new era with 
disease-modifying treatment options for AD, it will be critical for neurology 
practices to prepare and continually innovate to ensure optimal outcomes for 
patients.

INTRODUCTION: African, Caribbean and Black (ACB) adolescents are 
disproportionately affected by teen pregnancy in North America. Teen pregnancy 
poses risks to the quality of life of adolescent boys and girls, including 
physical, psychosocial and socioeconomic risks. Our review aims to explore this 
public health concern for ACB adolescents within North America. We aim to 
identify and analyse available evidence on the incidence and prevalence of, 
associated factors of and interventions to curtail teen pregnancy involvement 
(TPI) among ACB adolescent boys and girls in North America. This review will 
explore TPI, rather than teen pregnancy, to ensure a review of men' involvement 
in teen pregnancy outcomes.
METHODS AND ANALYSES: Health literature databases such as CINAHL, OVID (Medline 
and Embase) and CAB direct. Searches will be conducted for evidence published 
from 2001 to October 2021. Search results will be exported to Covidence for 
subsequent steps of the review. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Review guidelines will be used 
to ensure reproducibility and transparency. We will include all study designs 
focused on ACB boys and girls between 10 and 19 years old, residing in North 
America. Studies with a mixed racial sample will be included if sample consists 
of greater than 50% ACB individuals.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: TPI is a public health concern with socioeconomic and 
health consequences for ACB teens in North America. A scoping review such as 
this will provide direction for healthcare practice, policy changes, education 
and further research in reducing the incidence of TPI in North America. Study 
results will be disseminated via presentations at conferences, at target 
populations, communities and organisations and publications via peer-reviewed 
journals. As knowledge generated from this scoping review will stem from 
previously published evidence, an ethical approval is not needed.

BACKGROUND: Our understanding of the natural history of cystic fibrosis liver 
disease (CFLD) is limited, leading to uncertainty for patients their families 
and clinicians when liver abnormalities are identified.
AIM: to determine the incidence of CFLD, identify risk factors and document the 
natural history of liver abnormalities in cystic fibrosis (CF).
METHODS: The Irish longitudinal study of CFLD (ILSCFLD) prospectively enrolled 
95% of children with CF in 2007. Their liver disease status was classified as 
(i) advanced liver disease with portal hypertension (CFLD). (ii) nonspecific 
cystic fibrosis liver disease (NSCFLD) (iii) no liver disease (NoLD) RESULTS: 
480/522 (91.9%) children were followed for a median 8.53 years IQR 1.28, of whom 
35 (7.29%) had CFLD, 110 (22.9%) NSCFLD and 335 (69.79%) had NoLD. At follow-up 
28/445 (6.29%) participants without CFLD at baseline, progressed to CFLD 
(Incidence 7.51/1000 person years (Pyrs) (95%CI 4.99-10.86). Of these 
25/28(89.28%) were <10 years. No participant >10 years of age without clinical 
or radiological evidence of liver disease at baseline progressed to CFLD. During 
follow-up 18/35(51.43%) participants with CFLD died or received a transplant, 
MTx rate 7.75/100 Pyrs (95%CI 4.59-12.25) compared to NSCFLD 2.33/100 Pyrs 
(95%CI 1.44-3.56) and NoLD 1.13/100 Pyrs (95%CI 0.77-1.59). CFLD was an 
independent risk factor for mortality in CF. Children with CFLD also had a 
shorter life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of CFLD was highest in children under10 years. 
Children over10 years, with normal hepatic function did not develop CFLD. 
Research to identify the cause and improve outcome should focus on young 
children.

CONTEXT: Cushing's disease (CD) is rare condition burdened by several systemic 
complications correlated to higher mortality rates. The primary goal of 
clinicians is to achieve remission, but it is unclear if treatment can also 
increase life expectancy.
AIM: To assess the prevalence of cortisol-related complications and mortality in 
a large cohort of CD patients attending a single referral centre.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical charts of CD patients attending a referral 
hospital between 2001 and 2021 were reviewed.
RESULTS: 126 CD patients (median age at diagnosis 39 years) were included. At 
the last examination, 78/126 (61.9%) of the patients were in remission 
regardless of previous treatment strategies. Patients in remission showed a 
significant improvement in all the cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities (p < 0.05). 
The CV events were more frequent in older patients (p = 0.003), smokers and 
persistent CD groups (p < 0.05). Most of the thromboembolic (TE) and infective 
events occurred during active stages of the disease. The CV events were the most 
frequent cause of death. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) resulted 
increased in persistent cases at the last follow-up (SMR 4.99, 95%CI [2.15; 
9.83], p < 0.001) whilst it was not higher in those in remission (SMR 1.66, 
95%CI [0.34; 4.85], p = 0.543) regardless of the timing or number of treatments 
carried out. A younger age at diagnosis (p = 0.005), a microadenoma (p = 0.002), 
and remission status at the last follow-up (p = 0.027) all increased survival. 
Furthermore, an elevated number of comorbidities, in particular arterial 
hypertension, increased mortality rates.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with active CD presented a poor survival outcome. 
Remission restored the patients' life expectancy regardless of the timing or the 
types of treatments used to achieve it. Persistent CD-related comorbidities 
remained major risk factors.

BACKGROUND: Headache disorders are major contributors to disability in 
adolescents and young adults worldwide. We aimed to analyze global trends in the 
burden of migraine and tension-type headache in 10 to 24-year-olds from 1990 to 
2019.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019 
to examine trends in incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) for migraine and tension-type headache in adolescents and young adults 
by location, age, sex and sociodemographic index (SDI). Joinpoint regression 
analyzed trends and identified years of significant change.
RESULTS: Globally, migraine and tension-type headache incidence, prevalence, and 
DALYs increased from 1990 to 2019, though with some fluctuations. The highest 
growth in migraine incidence occurred in males and individuals aged 10-14, while 
for tension-type headache incidence, it was observed in males and individuals 
aged 20-24. Prevalence and DALYs were highest for both disorders in females and 
those aged 20-24 years. Incidence increased fastest in East Asia for migraine 
and tension-type headache. For migraine, Tropical Latin America had the fastest 
increase in prevalence and DALYs. East Asia had the fastest increase in 
prevalence of tension-type headache, while North Africa and the Middle East had 
the highest growth in DALYs. Some high-income countries such as Singapore, 
Norway, and Iran (Islamic Republic of) demonstrated fast increases, while a few 
countries including Qatar, Thailand and Ethiopia decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence, prevalence and disability from migraine and 
tension-type headache are rising in adolescents and young adults, especially in 
males, older youth and middle SDI populations. The increasing trends highlight 
the need for targeted interventions focused on prevention and control in 
priority populations. Continued monitoring of trends can help identify 
strategies to promote headache health and reduce the life-course impacts of 
headache disorders globally.
