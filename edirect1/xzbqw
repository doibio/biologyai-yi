BACKGROUND: While anesthesiologist's involvement in palliative care has been 
widely researched, extensive data on palliative patients under anesthesiological 
care in the operating room is missing. This study was performed to assess the 
incidence, demographics, and outcome of palliative patients under 
anesthesiological care.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective chart review of all 
palliative patients under anesthesiological care at a university hospital in 1 
year. Patients were classified as palliative if they fulfilled all predefined 
criteria (a) incurable, life-threatening disease, (b) progression of the disease 
despite therapy, (c) advanced stage of the disease with limited life-expectancy, 
(d) receiving or being in need of a specific palliative therapy. Demographics, 
periprocedural parameters, symptoms at evaluation, and outcome were determined 
using different medical records.
RESULTS: Of 17,580 patients examined, 276 could be classified as palliative 
patients (1.57%). Most contacts with palliative patients occurred in the 
operating room (68.5%). In comparison to the non-palliative patients, procedures 
in palliative patients were significantly more often urgent or emergency 
procedures (39.1% vs. 27.1%., P < 0.001), and hospital mortality was higher 
(18.8% vs. 5.0%, P < 0.001). Preprocedural symptoms varied, with pain, 
gastrointestinal, and nutritional problems being the most prevalent.
CONCLUSIONS: Palliative patients are treated by anesthesiologists under varying 
circumstances. Anesthesiologists need to identify these patients and need to be 
aware of their characteristics to adequately attend to them during the 
periprocedural period.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the lifetime costs and health outcomes of 
both first-line and sequential combination treatments with standard treatment 
for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with congenital heart 
disease (CHD) (PAH-CHD) patients.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed using a Markov model based on a 
societal perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
performed to investigate the effect of parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: As first-line treatments, both beraprost (incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) = 192,752 and 201,308 Thai baht (THB) per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained) and sildenafil (ICER = 249,770 and 
226,802 THB per QALY gained) seemed cost-effective for PAH-CHD patients 
aged ≤30 years in functional classes II and III, respectively, while no 
treatment was cost-effective for the sequential combination therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil should be included in the National Drug List of 
Essential Medicines as the first-line treatment for PAH-CHD, and its price per 
dose should be negotiated to be reduced by 43-57%.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical 
cardioprotective agent used to reduce infarct size in patients undergoing 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after anterior ST-elevation myocardial 
infarction.
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis using a Markov model.
SETTING: The National Health Service in the UK.
PATIENTS: Patients undergoing PCI after anterior ST-elevation myocardial 
infarction.
INTERVENTIONS: A cardioprotective agent given at the time of reperfusion 
compared to no cardioprotection. We assumed the cardioprotective agent (given at 
the time of reperfusion) would reduce the risk and severity of heart failure 
(HF) after PCI and the risk of mortality after PCI (with a relative risk ranging 
from 0.6 to 1). The costs of the cardioprotective agent were assumed to be in 
the range £1000-4000.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year 
(QALY) gained, using 95% CIs from 1000 simulations.
RESULTS: Incremental costs ranged from £933 to £3820 and incremental QALYs from 
0.04 to 0.38. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranged from £3311 
to £63 480 per QALY gained. The results were highly dependent on the costs of a 
cardioprotective agent, patient age, and the relative risk of HF after PCI. The 
ICER was below the willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per QALY gained in 
71% of the simulations.
CONCLUSIONS: A cardioprotective agent that can reduce the risk of HF and 
mortality after PCI has a high chance of being cost-effective. This chance 
depends on the price of the agent, the age of the patient and the relative risk 
of HF after PCI.

Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of almost 50 monogenic diseases 
characterized by mutations causing deficiency of lysosomal enzymes or non-enzyme 
proteins involved in transport across the lysosomal membrane, protein maturation 
or lysosomal biogenesis. Usually, affected patients are normal at birth and have 
a progressive and severe disease with high morbidity and reduced life 
expectancy. The overall incidence of LSDs is usually estimated as 1:5000, but 
newborn screening studies are indicating that it could be much higher. Specific 
therapies were already developed for selected LSDs, making the timely and 
correct diagnosis very important for successful treatment and also for genetic 
counseling. In most LSD cases the biochemical techniques provide a reliable 
diagnosis. However, the identification of pathogenic mutations by genetic 
analysis is being increasingly recommended to provide additional information. In 
this paper we discuss the conventional methods for genetic analysis used in the 
LSDs [restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), amplification-refractory 
mutation system (ARMS), single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), 
denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC), real-time polymerase 
chain reaction, high resolution melting (HRM), multiplex ligation-dependent 
probe amplification (MLPA), Sanger sequencing] and also the newer approaches 
[massive parallel sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)].

Cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity are highly prevalent diseases 
associated with reduced quality of life and life expectancy. We discuss a novel 
risk factor for these cardiometabolic diseases: circadian disruption. Circadian 
disruption occurs when the internal circadian (∼24-hour) rhythms are not in 
synchrony with the environment or each other. This paper reviews (1) 
cardiometabolic health of shift work, which often leads to circadian disruption, 
(2) effects of experimentally disrupted circadian rhythms on cardiometabolic 
function, (3) observational studies of sleep timing and behavioral chronotype, 
and (4) potential mediators linking chronotype and shift work to circadian 
disruption and cardiometabolic health.

Cardiovascular disease and type 1 diabetes: prevalence, prediction and 
management in an ageing population.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality in type 1 diabetes 
mellitus (T1D). However, evidence of its risks and management is often 
extrapolated from studies in type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients or the general 
population. This approach is unsatisfactory given that the underlying pathology, 
demographics and natural history of the disease differ between T1D and T2D. 
Furthermore, with a rising life expectancy, a greater number of T1D patients are 
exposed to the cardiovascular (CV) risk factors associated with an ageing 
population. The aim of this review is to examine the existing literature around 
CVD in T1D. We pay particular attention to CVD prevalence, how well we manage 
risk, potential biomarkers, and whether the studies included the older aged 
patients (defined as aged over 65). We also discuss approaches to the management 
of CV risk in the older aged. The available data suggest a significant CVD 
burden in patients with T1D and poor management of CV risk factors. This is 
underpinned by a poor evidence base for therapeutic management of CV risk 
specifically for patients with T1D, and in the most relevant population - the 
older aged patients. We would suggest that important areas remain to be 
addressed, particularly exploring the risks and benefits of therapeutic 
approaches to CVD management in the older aged.

Human motion analysis is crucial for a wide range of applications and 
disciplines. The development and validation of low cost and unobtrusive sensing 
systems for ambulatory motion detection is still an open issue. Inertial 
measurement systems and e-textile sensors are emerging as potential technologies 
for daily life situations. We developed and conducted a preliminary evaluation 
of an innovative sensing concept that combines e-textiles and tri-axial 
accelerometers for ambulatory human motion analysis. Our sensory fusion method 
is based on a Kalman filter technique and combines the outputs of textile 
electrogoniometers and accelerometers without making any assumptions regarding 
the initial accelerometer position and orientation. We used our technique to 
measure the flexion-extension angle of the knee in different motion tasks 
(monopodalic flexions and walking at different velocities). The estimation 
technique was benchmarked against a commercial measurement system based on 
inertial measurement units and performed reliably for all of the various tasks 
(mean and standard deviation of the root mean square error of 1:96 and 0:96, 
respectively). In addition, the method showed a notable improvement in angular 
estimation compared to the estimation derived by the textile goniometer and 
accelerometer considered separately. In future work, we will extend this method 
to more complex and multi-degree of freedom joints.

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective comparative study.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish cervical spine morphometry, alignment, 
and range of motion (ROM) and to clarify the impact of these age-related and 
degenerative changes.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There are no studies that have evaluated differences 
in the results of cervical spine radiographs between a large series of cervical 
spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) patients and healthy subjects.
METHODS: We enrolled 1016 consecutive CSM patients who underwent laminoplasty. 
CSM patients were also divided based on each decade of life between the fourth 
and ninth decades. We also enrolled a total of 1230 healthy volunteers as 
asymptomatic subjects in this study. There were at least 100 men and 100 women 
in each decade of life between the third and eighth decades. Cervical sagittal 
alignment on neutral and flexion-extension views was measured by the Cobb method 
at C2-7. ROM was assessed by measuring the difference in alignment between 
flexion and extension.
RESULTS: Cervical lordosis in the neutral position increased gradually with age 
in both groups. CSM patients showed significantly smaller lordotic angles 
compared with those shown by asymptomatic subjects within each decade. The total 
ROM decreased with increasing age in both groups. The total ROM of females was 
larger than males. The ROM of CSM patients was significantly smaller than 
asymptomatic subjects. The flexion ROM did not change with aging in either 
group. There was no significant difference in the flexion ROM between males and 
females in the two groups. However, the extension ROM decreased gradually in 
both groups. The extension ROM of CSM patients was significantly smaller than 
asymptomatic subjects.
CONCLUSION: Age-related and degenerative changes in the cervical spine, 
alignment, and ROM in each decade of life were established between CSM patients 
and asymptomatic subjects.

Nursing Practice: a Collaborating Center of the Joanna Briggs Institute.

REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review is to explore 
the experiences and perceptions of persons living with HIV who participate in 
mind-body and energy therapies. The review will focus on the use of mind-body 
medicine and energy therapies that include meditation, prayer, mental healing, 
Tai Chi, yoga, art therapy, music therapy, dance therapy, Qigong, reiki, 
therapeutic touch, healing touch and electromagnetic therapy. These mind-body 
and energy therapies are selected categories because they do not involve options 
that might be contraindicated to an individual's current treatment regime. More 
specifically, the review questions are:
BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a popular adjunct to 
conventional medicine across global populations. Complementary generally refers 
to a non-mainstream approach together with conventional medicine whereas 
alternative refers to a non-mainstream approach in place of conventional 
medicine. Most people use non-mainstream approaches along with conventional 
treatments. The World Health Organization [WHO] defines CAM as distinct 
health-care practices that have not been assimilated into a country's mainstream 
health care system.The USA's National Center for Complementary and Integrative 
Health (NCCIH), formerly National Center for Complementary and Alternative 
Medicine (NCCAM), organizes CAM into five medical system categories: whole 
medical systems, mind-body medicine, biologically based practices, manipulative 
and body-based practices, and energy therapies. Whole medical systems include 
homeopathy, naturopathy, traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda. Mind-body 
medicine includes meditation, prayer, mental healing, Tai Chi, yoga, art 
therapy, music therapy and dance therapy. Biologically based practices include 
dietary supplements, herbal supplements and a few scientifically unproven 
therapies. Manipulative and body-based practices include massage and spinal 
manipulation such as chiropractic and osteopathic. Energy therapies include 
Qigong, reiki, therapeutic touch, healing touch and electromagnetic therapy.The 
NCCAM, the Alternative Medicine's Strategic Plan for 2011-2015 and the Healthy 
People 2020 envision a society in which all people have the opportunity to live 
long, healthy lives. In most countries, life expectancy has increased, but 
unfortunately, the incidence of chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular 
disease, cancer, hypertension, diabetes and depression continues to increase. 
Research findings indicate that the use of CAM is often greater among people 
living with a chronic or life threatening illness compared with the general 
population,Until the development of highly active antiretroviral medications 
(ARVs) in 1996, a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was considered 
to be a death sentence. The human immunodeficiency virus attacks the immune 
system and weakens a person's ability to combat infections and some types of 
cancer. Currently, there is no cure for HIV but because of lifesaving 
medications, the mortality rate has declined significantly. The disease is now 
considered a chronic illness and highly manageable. Effective treatment has 
resulted in approximately 35 million people worldwide still living with HIV at 
the end of 2012.Because HIV is no longer a death sentence but a chronic illness, 
there is a need to evaluate the experiences and perceptions of people using CAM, 
considering the prevalence of CAM use within this population. In the United 
States and Canada, the rate of CAM use among HIV positive persons is 
approximately 50% to 70%, whereas in Africa, rates of CAM use range from 36% to 
68%. Popular forms of CAM among persons living with HIV include herbal or 
nutritional supplements, mind and body practices, and spiritual or religious 
healing. Worldwide, only a small percentage of persons who have access to ARVs 
refuse to take them and utilize CAM exclusively to treat their HIV 
infection.People living with HIV often report using CAM because they believe 
that these therapies will improve their overall health and well-being and 
provides them an opportunity to take some responsibility in managing their 
personal health, which includes medication side effects. However, the effect of 
CAM on an individual's physical health often cannot be measured physiologically, 
but may be felt or experienced.Understanding CAM use is essential so that health 
professionals will have the most accurate information about which integrative 
therapies may or may not be helpful for people living with HIV. As recommended 
by the Institute of Medicine report entitled, 'Integrative Medicine and Patient 
Centered Care', health professionals have a moral commitment to find innovative 
ways of obtaining evidence and expanding knowledge about diverse interpretations 
of health and healing. Research aimed at exploring patients' experiences and 
perceptions of mind-body and energy therapies is imperative so asto offer 
comprehensive care and promote shared decision making regarding complementary 
therapeutic options.

[Analysis of results of Gamma Knife radiosurgery for patients with melanoma 
brain metastases].

[Article in Russian]

Ivanov PI, Zubatkina IS, Tumarova DI, Andreev GI, Volkov NM.

The outcomes of Gamma Knife radiosurgery for 95 patients with melanoma brain 
metastases were studied. The majority of the patients (82%) presented multiple 
metastatic brain lesions. Local control was achieved in 94% of cases. The 
Kaplan-Maier analyses of life expectancy revealed that median survival after 
radiosurgical treatment was 6.9 months. The median survival by RTOG RPA class 
was 18,3 months for class I; 6.9 months for class II and 3.9 months for class 
III. These results demonstrate that Gamma Knife radiosurgery provides a high 
level of local control for melanoma brain metastases and may increase the life 
expectancy.

[The effect of floating-needle therapy combined with rehabilitation training for 
the hand function recovery of post-stroke patients].

[Article in Chinese]

Yang J, Xiao H.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the improvement of hand motion function,spasm and 
self-care ability of daily life for stroke patients treated with floating-needle 
combined with rehabilitation training.
METHODS: Eighty hand spasm patients of post-stroke within one year after stroke 
were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 40 cases in 
each one. In the two groups, rehabilitation was adopted for eight weeks,once a 
day,40 min one time. In the observation group, based on the above treatment and 
according to muscle fascia trigger point, 2~3 points in both the internal and 
external sides of forearm were treated with floating-needle. The positive or 
passive flexion and extension of wrist and knuckle till the relief of spasm hand 
was combined. The floating-needle therapy was given for eight weeks, on the 
first three days once a day and later once every other day. Modified Ashworth 
Scale(MAS), activity of daily life(ADL, Barthel index) scores and 
Fugl-Meyer(FMA) scores were used to assess the spasm hand degree,activity of 
daily life and hand motion function before and after 7-day, 14-day and 8-week 
treatment.
RESULTS: After 7-day, 14-day and 8-week treatment, MAS scores were apparently 
lower than those before treatment in the two groups(all P<0. 05), and Barthel 
scores and FMA scores were obviously higher than those before-treatment(all P<0. 
05). After 14-day and 8-week treatment, FMA scores in the observation group were 
markedly higher than those in the control group(both P<0. 05).
CONCLUSION: Floating-needle therapy combined with rehabilitation training and 
simple rehabilitation training could both improve hand spasm degree, hand 
function and activity of daily life of post-stroke patients, but floating-needle 
therapy combined with rehabilitation training is superior to simple 
rehabilitation training for the improvement of hand function.

INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation is a treatment available for many patients 
with liver cirrhosis who find in this treatment a way to improve life expectancy 
and quality of life. Paranoid schizophrenia affects 1% of the general 
population, produces psychotic symptoms, and runs a chronic course in some cases 
with significant deterioration in all areas of life.
OBJECTIVE: To discuss the case of a patient with liver cirrhosis diagnosed with 
paranoid schizophrenia during the evaluation protocol for liver transplantation.
METHOD: Case report.
RESULTS: We report the case of a 47-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis whose 
only alternative to improve life expectancy and quality of life was access to 
liver transplantation. During routine evaluations the liaison psychiatrist 
observed first-order psychotic symptoms and documented a life story that 
confirmed the presence of paranoid schizophrenia.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Paranoid schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder 
common in the general population that can be a part of the medical comorbidities 
of patients requiring liver transplantation and is not an absolute 
contraindication to its completion. We are unaware of similar cases of liver 
transplantation in patients with schizophrenia in our country. We believe this 
is a big step on the road to overcome the stigma that mental illness imposes on 
patients.

With the increase in life expectancy, there is also growing interest in 
anti-aging treatments and technologies. The development of anti-aging functional 
drugs for the skin, and foods from natural sources, may offer solutions to this 
global matter. Aging involves structural, functional and biochemical changes 
that occur throughout cells and bodily tissues; the amount of hormones secreted 
from of all human organs, including the skin, decreases over time. Matrix 
metalloproteinase (MMP) genes (MMP-1 and -8) play an important role in the aging 
of skin fibroblasts. For example, an increased MMP expression causes accelerated 
aging and the degradation of skin elasticity-related genes. In the present 
study, we examined the anti-wrinkle effects of tuna heart extract which are 
mediated through the inhibition of MMPs in skin cells. Generally, tuna contains 
high concentrations of selenium and antioxidants, which serve to remove free 
radicals, and is known to delay skin and body aging. In addition, unsaturated 
fatty acids in tuna help to maintain the natural glossy look of skin, and 
increase skin elasticity, providing moisture for dry skin. A recent study 
confirmed the various bio-effects of boiled tuna extract and muscle. However, 
bioactivity studies using tuna heart are limited. Thus, in the present study, we 
obtained extracts and fractions of tuna heart, and examined their effects on 
Hs27 human fibroblast proliferation using an MTS assay. In addition, we measured 
procollagen type 1 levels and elastase activity, and performed β-galactosidase 
staining. We then measured the expression levels of 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and MMP-related genes by western blot analysis 
and RT-PCR. Our results revealed that tuna heart extract decreased MMP 
expression by upregulating tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and 
decreasing elastase activity, thus exerting anti-aging and anti-wrinkle effects 
by increasing collagen synthesis and promoting skin fibroblast proliferation. 
Thus, our data suggest that tuna heart (TH)-H2O fractions exert anti-wrinkle 
effects on Hs27 cells.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of hip fractures in older adults in India is likely to 
increase dramatically in the coming decades as a result of an aging population 
and increasing life expectancy. Currently, more than 600,000 adults over 60 
years of age suffer a hip fracture annually in India. This paper outlines a 
protocol for a qualitative study investigating the care seeking behavior of 
older adults with hip fractures: to determine the processes in decision making, 
identify causes for delay in obtaining care, and identify potential barriers and 
facilitators to seeking appropriate care in time.
METHODS AND DESIGN: The planned study will consider Odisha, an eastern state in 
India with limited health care facility, as a suitable case study. It is 
proposed to conduct 30 in-depth interviews in two administrative districts of 
Odisha. The participants will be patient and their carers in seven health 
facilities- four public hospitals, two private hospitals and one traditional 
bone-setting facility. The study relies on a purposive sampling strategy. Ethics 
permission will be sought from each participating institution and participants. 
The participants will be adults aged 50 years or older of both sexes arriving at 
the recruiting centers with a history of fall or injury, pain in the hip region 
and inability to walk and X-ray confirmed diagnosis of proximal femoral fracture 
and their primary carer. Trained qualitative research team will conduct these 
interviews. A thematic framework approach will be used to analyze the data using 
NVivo 9 software. The data collected from the interviews will be analysed to 
explore the cause of the hip fracture, events following the injury, the 
experiences of patients from the time of sustaining the injury, pain relief 
measures, decision to seek care, understanding of the urgency for treatment, 
causes for delay in receiving treatment, funding sources, cost liabilities for 
the family, financing mechanisms for out of pocket expenditure and the burden 
for caring.
DISCUSSION: The findings of this study will provide an increased understanding 
of the care seeking behaviors of older adults with hip fracture, and inform 
contextually appropriate changes in healthcare program and policy aimed at 
improving health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about what is at stake at a subjective level for the 
oncologists and the advanced cancer patients when they face the question whether 
to continue, limit or stop specific therapies. We studied (1) the frequency of 
such questioning, and (2) subjective determinants of the decision-making process 
from the physicians' and the patients' perspectives.
METHODS: (1) All hospitalized patients were screened during 1 week in oncology 
and/or hematology units of five institutions. We included those with advanced 
cancer for whom a questioning about the pursuit, the limitation or the 
withholding of specific therapies (QST) was raised. (2) Qualitative design was 
based on in-depth interviews.
RESULTS: In conventional units, 12.8 % of cancer patients (26 out of 202) were 
concerned by a QST during the study period. Interviews were conducted with all 
physicians and 21 advanced cancer patients. The timing of this questioning 
occurred most frequently as physicians estimated life expectancy between 15 days 
and 3 months. Faced with the most frequent dilemma (uncertain risk-benefit 
balance), physicians showed different ways of involving patients. The first two 
were called the "no choice" models: 1) trying to resolve the dilemma via a 
technical answer or a "wait-and-see" posture, instead of involving the patients 
in the questioning and the thinking; and 2), giving a "last minute" choice to 
the patients, leaving to them the responsibility of the decision. In a third 
model, they engaged early in shared reflections and dialogue about uncertainties 
and limits with patients, proxies and care teams. These schematic trends 
influenced patients' attitudes towards uncertainty and limits, as they were 
influenced by these ones. Individual and systemic barriers to a shared 
questioning were pointed out by physicians and patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicate to what extent these difficult decisions are 
related to physicians' and patients' respective and mutually influenced 
abilities to deal with and share about uncertainties and limits, throughout the 
disease trajectory. These insights may help physicians, patients and policy 
makers to enrich their understanding of underestimated and sensitive key issues 
of the decision-making process.

Effect of the Prevalence of HIV/AIDS and the Life Expectancy Rate on Economic 
Growth in SSA Countries: Difference GMM Approach.

The productivity of countries around the globe is adversely affected by the 
health-related problems of their labour force. This study examined the effect of 
the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and life expectancy on the economic growth of 33 Sub-Saharan 
African (SSA) countries over a period of 11 years (2002-2012). The study 
employed a dynamic panel approach as opposed to the static traditional approach 
utilised in the literature. The dynamic approach became eminent because of the 
fact that HIV/AIDS is a dynamic variable as its prevalence today depends on the 
previous years. The result revealed that HIV/AIDS is negatively correlated with 
economic growth in the region, with a coefficient of 0.014, and significant at 
the 1% level. That is, a 10% increase in HIV/AIDS prevalence leads to a 0.14% 
decrease in the GDP of the region. Tackling HIV/AIDS is therefore imperative to 
the developing Sub-Saharan African region and all hands must be on deck to end 
the menace globally.

Over recent years, significant progress has been made in characterisation of the 
underlying pathogenic mechanisms in psoriasis, a common cutaneous disease that 
is associated with major systemic co-morbidity and reduced life expectancy. 
Basic science discoveries have informed the design of novel therapeutic 
approaches, many of which are now under evaluation in late-stage clinical 
trials. Here we describe the complex interplay between immune cell types and 
cytokine networks that acts within self-perpetuating feedback loops to drive 
cutaneous inflammation in psoriasis. Genetic studies have been pivotal in the 
construction of the disease model and more recently have uncovered a distinct 
aetiology for rare, pustular variants of psoriasis. The translation of 
mechanistic insights into potential advancements in clinical care will also be 
described, including several treatments that target the interleukin-23 
(IL-23)/T17 immune axis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia in developed countries. 
Between the identified risk factors, one of the most important is the age. Its 
prevalence reaches 24 % in men and 33 % in women over 85 years. Increase in life 
expectancy, making it a serious public health problem. Prevention of Alzheimer's 
disease represents a major challenge to health. Given that Alzheimer's disease 
is largely dependent on the genetics of each person and uninterrupted progress 
of the age, which is try to make people aware that there are other factors that 
can alter your chance of developing the Alzheimer disease and although currently 
not reduce, help is not increased in the near or distant future.The aim of this 
paper is to develop and evaluate a Web-Mobile application (Alzhe Alert) used to 
calculate the risk of Alzheimer's from a short questionnaire using a computer or 
mobile device, so that any user, without requiring computer skills, can access 
the website to estimate their risk of developing the disease in the coming years 
depending on their habits and daily basis activities. The users who have 
realized the questionnaire can to observe in a graph the result, and they will 
know which is at risk for Alzheimer's at present and over the next 50 years if 
they continue with the same habits and lifestyle. The objective is that the 
users can be aware of the risk they have different habits of life about their 
health. Currently, 243 users (84 women and 159 men) of white race have completed 
the questionnaire. 76 % of the users have got a risk below the average.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relevance of C-reactive protein (CRP) and squamous 
cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) levels in relation to clinicopathological 
factors and prognosis in penile cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 124 Chinese patients with penile squamous cell 
carcinoma (SCC), treated between November 2007 and October 2014, were analysed 
retrospectively. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were used to identify 
the combination of markers with the best sensitivity and specificity for 
prognosis prediction. Statistical data analysis was performed using a 
non-parametric method, and survival analysis was performed using the log-rank 
test and Cox proportional hazard model.
RESULTS: Levels of CRP ≥4.5 mg/L and SCC-Ag ≥1.4 ng/mL were both significantly 
associated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) laterality (chi-squared trend test, 
P = 0.041), extranodal extension (chi-squared trend test, P < 0.001), pelvic LNM 
(chi-squared trend test, P = 0.024), pathological tumour status (chi-squared 
trend test, P = 0.002), pathological nodal status (chi-squared trend test, P < 
0.001), and disease-specific survival (DSS; log-rank test, P < 0.001). Moreover, 
the influence of CRP and SCC-Ag levels on DSS (P = 0.033, hazard ratio 3.390, 
95% confidence interval 1.104-10.411) remained after adjusting for smoking 
history, phimosis, tumour status, tumour cell differentiation and nodal status.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that the combined measurement of 
preoperative CRP and SCC-Ag levels may serve as an independent biomarker for 
LNM, advanced tumour stage and DSS in patients with penile SCC.

Ageing is an individual process. Chronological age does not reflect life 
expectancy or functional capacity. That is why, in geriatric oncology, the 
estimation of this capacity is a determining factor. An inter-disciplinary 
approach is necessary in order to coordinate the different players in the care 
and optimise the hospitalisation of elderly patients with multiple pathologies, 
all the more so when they are suffering from cancer.

AIMS: To estimate the incremental cost, cost-effectiveness and benefit-cost 
ratio of incorporating a significant other (SO) into motivational intervention 
for alcohol misuse.
DESIGN: We obtained economic data from the one year with the intervention in 
full operation for patients in a recent randomized trial.
SETTING: The underlying trial took place at a major urban hospital in the United 
States.
PARTICIPANTS: The trial randomized 406 (68.7% male) eligible hazardous drinkers 
(196 during the economic study) admitted to the emergency department or trauma 
unit.
INTERVENTION: The motivational interview condition consisted of one in-person 
session featuring personalized normative feedback. The significant other 
motivational interview condition comprised one joint session with the 
participant and SO in which the SO's perspective and support were elicited.
MEASUREMENTS: We ascertained activities across 445 representative time segments 
through work sampling (including staff idle time), calculated the incremental 
cost in per patient of incorporating an SO, expressed the results in 2014 US$, 
incorporated quality and mortality effects from a closely related trial and 
derived the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
FINDINGS: From a health system perspective, the incremental cost per patient of 
adding an SO was $341.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) = $244.44-437.74]. The 
incremental cost per year per hazardous drinker averted was $3623 (CI = 
$1777-22,709), the cost per QALY gained $32,200 (CI = $15,800-201,700), and the 
benefit-cost ratio was 4.73 (95% CI = 0.7-9.66). If adding an SO into the 
intervention strategy were concentrated during the hours with highest risk or in 
a trauma unit, it would become even more cost-beneficial.
CONCLUSIONS: Using criteria established by the World Health Organization 
(cost-effectiveness below the country's gross domestic product per capita), 
incorporating a significant other into a patient's motivational intervention for 
alcohol misuse is highly cost-effective.
