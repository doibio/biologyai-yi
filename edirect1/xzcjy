examination was performed to evaluate dental caries (decayed, missing, and 
filled teeth DMFT) and periodontal status including bleeding on probing, visible 
plaque index, probing depth, and clinical attachment level. The impact of oral 
health on quality of life was measured using the Brazilian version of the Oral 
Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14).
RESULTS: In terms of the OHIP-14, the mean ±SD and median of the severity scores 
were 11.07 ±9.45 and 9, respectively, and mean ±SD of the extension score: 1.78 
±2.27. The adjusted association measurement showed that in individuals exposed 
simultaneously to caries and periodontitis, the occurrence of the impact on 
quality of life was 63% greater than among those without these diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the combined occurrence of dental caries 
and periodontitis is associated with a significant impact on oral health-related 
quality of life when compared with absence of these oral diseases.

Perceptual coupling between people can lead to the spontaneous synchronisation 
of their rhythmic movements. In the current study, we hypothesised that the 
sight of a co-actor generates anchoring (local stabilisation around specific 
spatiotemporal points within movement cycles), and that such anchoring supports 
the occurrence and stability of spontaneous interpersonal synchronisation 
(global stabilisation across cycles). To test these hypotheses, we re-examined 
previously published data from a study where participants were required to 
perform auditory-motor coordination of whole-body movements with versus without 
visual contact. Paired participants performed two kinds of coordination task - 
either knee flexion or extension repeatedly with auditory metronome beats 
(Flexion-on-the-beat and Extension-on-the-beat conditions) while standing 
face-to-face or back-to-back to manipulate visual interaction. The analysis of 
individual movement trajectories showed that visual interaction led to decreased 
variability along the entire trajectory, except the maximum extension position. 
The results also indicated that the strength of this anchoring was correlated 
with the degree to which the variability of interpersonal phase relations 
decreased with visual coupling, suggesting that local stabilisation supported 
global interpersonal stabilisation. Therefore, the sight of a co-actor generates 
anchoring effects that may play a crucial role in the stabilisation of 
spontaneous interpersonal synchronisation.

Ki-67 has shown promise as a prognostic factor in pulmonary carcinoids. In this 
study, we sought to validate the importance of Ki-67 and study the relationships 
between Ki-67 and other stromal biomarkers of vascular density. We examined 
Ki-67, CD34, and D2-40 in tumor tissues from 128 patients with surgically 
excised typical carcinoid of the lung. We used immunohistochemistry and 
morphometry to evaluate the amount of tumor staining for cellular proliferation 
(Ki-67), microvascular density (CD34-MVD), and D2-40 lymphovascular density. The 
main outcome was overall survival, considered as life expectancy until death 
from metastasis. Specimens from patients with central tumors showed high 
CD34-MVD (P = .01), which was also significantly associated with a compromised 
surgical margin, lymph node metastasis, and clinical stage Ib. Equally 
significant was high D2-40 lymphovascular density in central specimens with a 
compromised surgical margin and lymph node metastasis. A high Ki-67 
proliferation rate was significantly associated with tumors from patients with 
clinical stage IIb, IIIa, and IV disease. Multivariate Cox model analysis 
demonstrated that tumor location and stage, surgical margin, tumor size, and N 
stage were significantly related to survival time (P < .05). Quantitative 
staining of the tumor for Ki-67 and CD34-MVD served as prognostic factors (P < 
.05), which were more relevant than the surgical and pathological stage. Ki-67 
greater than 5% and CD34-MVD greater than 7% staining comprise a subset of 
patients with higher death hazard; this outcome may harbor evidence for further 
prospective studies of target therapy after surgical resection.

BACKGROUND: Older patients are increasingly presenting for surgery with 
intracranial meningioma because of progress with diagnostic imaging and longer 
life expectancy. However, older patients have many problems, such as 
comorbidities and reduced physiological capacity reflected in the frailty index. 
This study examines the factors affecting clinical deterioration after surgery 
in older patients, particularly factors associated with frailty.
METHODS: Two hundred sixty-five patients older than 65 years underwent surgical 
resection of meningioma at Hiroshima University and related hospitals between 
2000 and 2016. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scores before and after 
surgery were evaluated. Factors related to the deterioration of KPS were 
analyzed with multivariate logistic regression modeling, including body mass 
index and serum albumin.
RESULTS: KPS score deteriorated compared with preoperative score in 56 patients 
at discharge and in 40 patients at 3 months later, and 2 patients died within 1 
year after surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis in addition to 
preoperative body mass index and serum albumin indicated skull base tumor 
location (odds ratio [OR], 4.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.02-10.8) and 
serum albumin (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.06-5.34) were risk factors for deterioration 
of KPS score at discharge. Age (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-0.98), skull base tumor 
location (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 1.45-12.9), tumor size (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 
1.00-1.05), and serum albumin (OR, 3.53; 95% CI, 1.29-9.61) were significant 
risk factors for perioperative intracranial complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Skull base tumor location and serum albumin correlated with 
deterioration of clinical status after surgery.

Eicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are a class of intermediates produced during 
arachidonic acid metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases that exert 
multiple physiological effects on the nervous system. EETs promote three 
metabolic processes, including esterification, hydrolysis and degradation or 
extension. EETs are hydrolyzed by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to form 
corresponding diols, thereby reducing their biological activity. Strategies 
regulating sEH expression or activity affect EET hydrolysis and alter relative 
cell concentrations, thus influencing EET function. This article summarizes the 
metabolic pathway of eicosatrienoic acid in organisms and highlights its 
neuroprotective effects on the central nervous system, which include regulating 
neuronal excitability, increasing cerebral blood flow, inhibiting neuronal 
apoptosis, reducing neuroinflammation, mitigating brain injury and promoting 
recovery of neurological function in subjects with nervous system diseases.

Two fundamental goals of health systems are to maximise overall population 
health gain (referred to as efficiency) and to minimise unfair health 
inequalities (equity). Often there is a trade-off in maximising efficiency vis a 
vis equity and the relative weight given to one goal over the other is 
acknowledged to be essentially a value judgement. Health systems necessarily 
make those value judgements but in making them would benefit from relevant and 
accurate opportunity cost information. Unfortunately the development of 
practical tools to measure equity-efficiency trade-offs has lagged theoretical 
advances in this area. We address this gap by presenting a practical technique 
to reveal opportunity costs of equity (and efficiency) gains in decentralised 
population-based health systems, applying stochastic data envelopment analysis 
to ethnic-specific life expectancy (LE) changes for 20 New Zealand (NZ) District 
Health Boards for the inter-census period 2006-2013, thereby deriving a notional 
health frontier from 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Four different ways to 
increase health equity emerge. These show that a trade-off between equity and 
efficiency does not always exist. In particular, improving both productive 
efficiency and allocative efficiency (up to its maximum) can also yield gains in 
equity through reductions in LE inequalities. However, in NZ's case, the 
opportunity cost (in sacrificed European life-years) of achieving gains in 
equity beyond the point of maximum productive and allocative efficiency is 
relatively high, even for quite small reductions in the LE gap between Māori and 
European populations. This high opportunity cost may explain why, despite 
governments' strong rhetorical commitment to equity, NZ's health gains have not 
strayed far from the path of maximising allocative efficiency. Nevertheless, 
this opportunity cost could be reduced significantly by measures which shift the 
health frontier outward, highlighting the importance of technical and 
organisational innovation as potential drivers of greater equity in health 
outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To pilot the methods for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to 
investigate whether the treatment effect of Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy 
(MDT) is enhanced with the LUMOback.
DESIGN: Assessor blinded RCT with 3 and 6-week follow-ups.
SETTING: An outpatient clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: Primary eligibility criteria were: a directional preference of 
lumbar extension, ≥18years of age, and non-specific low back pain lasting for 
≥1month.
INTERVENTIONS: The MDT group undertook extension exercises (10reps/3hour) and 
postural correction using a lumbar roll at home. The MDT+LUMOback group also 
wore the LUMOback daily, providing a vibration alert in a slouched posture.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Global Rating of Change Scale (GRCS) (0-6), 
recruitment rate per month, treatment sessions, compliance rate of wearing the 
LUMOback, participants' adherence with treatment, dropout rate and the stage of 
the MDT program at six weeks.
RESULTS: Twenty-two participants were included for 20 months (a recruitment rate 
of 1.1 patient/month). Dropout rate was 9%. The mean (SD) of the GRCS of the MDT 
and MDT+LUMOback groups were 4.7 (0.8) and 4.7 (0.5) at the 3-week follow-up and 
were both 4.9 (0.5) at the 6-week follow-up. The patients undertook a mean of 
6.7 sessions for six weeks and exercises with mean of 3.7set/day in each group. 
The mean compliance rate of wearing the LUMOback was 88%. Nobody was discharged 
from the intervention with full recovery within six weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Data indicated a promising method for the full RCT, but a rationale 
for the full RCT was not justified.

IMPORTANCE: As the life expectancy of people with Down syndrome (DS) has 
markedly increased over the past decades, older adults with DS may be 
experiencing a higher incidence of aging conditions. In addition to longevity, 
the amyloid precursor protein gene located on chromosome 21 places individuals 
with DS at a high risk for developing Alzheimer disease. Yet, few studies have 
determined prevalence of dementia and comorbidities among older people with DS.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of dementia and aging-related 
comorbidities in older adult individuals with DS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analysis of 2015 California 
Medicare claims data. We examined 1 year of cross-sectional Medicare claims data 
that included 100% of Californian Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in both 
Medicare Part A and B in 2015. Of these 3 001 977 Californian Medicare 
beneficiaries 45 years or older, 878 individuals were identified as having a 
diagnosis of DS. Data were analyzed between April 2017 and February 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The frequency of DS dementia was assessed across 
different age categories. The number and frequency of 27 comorbidities were 
compared among individuals with DS with and without dementia and by age and sex 
groups.
RESULTS: A total of 353 DS individuals (40%) were identified as having dementia 
diagnoses (mean, 58.7 years; 173 women [49%]) and 525 without dementia diagnoses 
(mean, 55.9 years; 250 women [48%]). The frequency of DS dementia among those 65 
years or older rose to 49%. The mean number of comorbidities per individual 
increased with age in general. Comorbid conditions were more numerous among 
those with dementia compared with those with DS without dementia (mean, 3.4 vs 
2.5, respectively), especially among those younger than 65 years. In particular, 
4 treatable conditions, hypothyroidism, epilepsy, anemia, and weight loss, were 
much more frequent in DS dementia.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Older Medicare beneficiaries in California with DS, 
especially those with dementia, have a high level of multimorbidity including 
several treatable conditions. While DS follow-up has long been confined to the 
pediatric sphere, we found that longevity in individuals with DS will 
necessitate complex adult and geriatric care. More evidenced-based and 
standardized follow-up could support better long-term comorbidity management and 
dementia care among aging adults with DS.

Objective: To compare predictive value of the current 7 scoring systems and 
CADILLAC-plus scoring system for risk of short-term deathin patients with acute 
myocardial infarction complicating cardiogenic shock. Methods: A total of 126 
acute myocardial infarction patients complicating cardiogenic shock hospitalized 
in Fuwai hospital from June 2014 to January 2018 were enrolled in this study, 
the clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into 
survival group(49 cases) and death group(77 cases) according to survival or not 
at 28 days after diagnosis of cardiogenic shock.The scores of APACHE Ⅱ,APACHE 
Ⅲ,SAPS Ⅱ,PAMI, TIMI-STEMI,TIMI-NSTEMI,and CADILLAC were calculated within 24 
hours in coronary care unit (CCU),and scores of CADILLAC-plus, which is an 
improved score derived from CADILLAC, was also calculated. The predictive value 
of the different scoring systems for 28 day smortality of acute myocardial 
infarction patients complicating cardiogenic shock were compared in this patient 
cohort. Results: Scores of APACHEⅡ,APACHEⅢ,SAPSⅡ,PAMI,TIMI-STEMI, 
TIMI-NSTEMI,CADILLAC,and CADILLAC-plus were all significantly higher in death 
group than in survival group: (28.9±10.2 vs. 21.8±8.3,94.0 (57.0,114.0) vs. 57.0 
(45.4,81.5) ,62.0 (46.0,81.0) vs. 47.0 (41.5,60.5) ,7.0 (6.0,9.0) vs. 6.0 
(6.0,7.5) ,10.0 (9.0,11.0) vs. 9.0 (8.0,10.0) ,4.0 (3.0,5.0) vs. 3.0 (3.0,4.0) 
,10.0 (7.0,12.0) vs. 7.0 (5.0,9.0) ,and 10.0 (8.0,14.0) vs. 7.0 (5.0,10.0) , 
respectively, all P<0.01).The area under the curve(AUC) of receiver operating 
characteristic(ROC) curve for predicting 28 days death of APACHE Ⅱ,APACHE Ⅲ,SAPS 
Ⅱ,PAMI, TIMI-STEMI,TIMI-NSTEMI,and CADILLAC scoring systems were 
0.820,0.797,0.785,0.667,0.657,0.711,and 0.821,respectively and cut-off value was 
27.5,79.5,66.0,8.5,10.5,3.5,and 8.5, respectively and the sensitivity was 
0.766,0.844,0.649,0.494,0.494,0.740,and 0.753, respectively and specificity was 
0.816,0.755,0.837,0.204,0.796,0.571,and 0.755,respectively.The AUC of ROC of 
CADILLAC-plus scoring system was 0.885,cut-off value was 9.5, sensitivity was 
0.896,and specificity was 0.735. The predicting efficacy of CADILLAC-plus 
scoring system was superior to other scoring systems. Conclusion: The 7 current 
scoring systems are all suitable for predicting theshort-term death in acute 
myocardial infarction patients complicating cardiogenic shock, and the 
predicting efficacy of the improved CADILLAC-plus score is superior to other 
scoring systems in this patient cohort.

Acute myocarditis (AM) is commonly found in everyday clinical practice. 
Differential diagnosis between various causes of myocardial damage with 
non-obstructive coronary arteries can be cumbersome for clinician. Moreover, AM 
may be provoked by a number of different causes and clinical presentation can be 
heterogeneous with potential overlap going from asymptomatic or subclinical to 
severe heart failure, arrhythmias, and death. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) 
over the last decades has proven to be the diagnostic technique of choice since 
it allows identifying AM with excellent diagnostic accuracy. Latest 
technological advancement with parametric imaging such as T1 and T2 mapping 
further increases sensitivity and provides additional help towards a correct 
diagnosis. CMR however is no longer to be considered as a mere diagnostic tool 
but also as a powerful source of prognostic information. Scientific evidence has 
corroborated CMR's role beyond diagnosis demonstrating how late gadolinium 
enhancement (LGE) presence is a powerful predictor of cardiac events and how the 
presence of septal LGE is to be considered of worst prognosis regardless of LGE 
extension even in patients with preserved global systolic function. CMR should 
be routinely performed in all patients with AM suspicion since its diagnostic 
and prognostic role is of paramount important and could modify therapeutic 
strategy and subsequent clinical decisions.

INTRODUCTION: In 2014, the Government of Thailand recommended pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP) as an additional HIV prevention programme within Thailand's 
National Guidelines on HIV/AIDS Treatment Prevention. However, to date 
implementation and uptake of PrEP programmes have been limited, and evidence on 
the costs and the epidemiological and economic impact is not available.
METHODS: We estimated the costs associated with PrEP provision among men having 
sex with men (MSM) participating in a facility-based, prospective observational 
cohort study: the Test, Treat and Prevent HIV Programme in Thailand. We created 
a suite of scenarios to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PrEP and sensitivity 
of the results to the model input parameters, including PrEP programme 
effectiveness, PrEP uptake among high-risk and low-risk MSM, baseline and future 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage, condom use, unit cost of delivering PrEP, 
and the discount rate.
RESULTS: Drug costs accounted for 82.5% of the total cost of providing PrEP, 
followed by lab testing (8.2%) and personnel costs (7.8%). The estimated costs 
of providing the PrEP package in accordance with the national recommendation 
ranges from US$223 to US$311 per person per year. Based on our modelling 
results, we estimate that PrEP would be cost-effective when provided to either 
high-risk or all MSM. However, we found that the programme would be 
approximately 32% more cost-effective if offered to high-risk MSM than it would 
be if offered to all MSM, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 
US$4,836 per disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted and US$7,089 per DALY 
averted respectively. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves demonstrate that 
80% of scenarios would be cost-effective when PrEP is provided solely to 
higher-risk MSM.
CONCLUSION: We provide the first estimates on cost and cost-effectiveness of 
PrEP in the Asia-Pacific region, and offer insights on how to deliver PrEP in 
combination with ART. While the high drug cost poses a budgeting challenge, 
incorporating PrEP delivery into an existing ART programme could be a 
cost-effective strategy to prevent HIV infections among MSM in Thailand.

BACKGROUND: Australian life expectancy is high by world standards, largely 
because of advanced health care. It is therefore important to determine safety 
and oncological benefits of major surgical procedures in the elderly. This 
retrospective review examines outcomes of liver resection in octogenarians.
METHODS: Data on all liver resections performed at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital 
were collected in a prospective database. The primary aim was to determine 
overall and disease-free survival, and secondary aim to assess perioperative 
quality of life (QoL) and functionality outcomes using surrogate markers.
RESULTS: Twenty-four octogenarians underwent 26 liver resections for colorectal 
liver metastases (n = 20), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 4), cholangiocarcinoma 
(n = 1) and benign lesion (n = 1). Median hospital stay was 11 days. There were 
no major post-operative complications and only one patient experienced a decline 
in QoL. There was no 90-day mortality. Five-year overall survival and 5-year 
disease-free survival were 47% and 37%, respectively. Median duration of 
follow-up was 34 months.
CONCLUSION: Liver resection can be performed safely in octogenarians with low 
morbidity, excellent overall survival and good QoL outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The addition of a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 
(PCSK9) inhibitor to statin therapy reduces the rate of cardiovascular events. 
This study examined the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitor+statin compared 
with standard therapy (statin monotherapy) in the treatment of triple-vessel 
coronary artery disease (CAD) in Japan. Methods and Results: A Markov model was 
applied to assess the costs and benefits associated with PCSK9 inhibitor+statin 
over a projected 30-year period from the perspective of a public healthcare 
payer in Japan. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as 
the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), was estimated. The effects on survival 
and numbers of events were based on the FOURIER trial and the CREDO Kyoto 
registry. The ICER of PCSK9 inhibitor+statin over standard therapy was 13.5 
million (95% confidence interval 7.6-23.5 million) Japanese Yen (JPY) per QALY 
gained for triple-vessel CAD. The probability of the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 
inhibitor+statin vs. standard therapy was 0.0008% at a cost-effectiveness 
threshold of 5 million JPY. In patients with poorly controlled familial 
hypercholesterolemia (FH) with triple-vessel CAD, the ICER was 3.4 million JPY 
per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: PCSK9 inhibitor plus statin did not show good cost-effectiveness 
for triple-vessel CAD; however, it showed good cost-effectiveness for patients 
with triple-vessel CAD and poorly controlled FH in Japan.

(2)New York University, New York City, NY, USA.

Background: This study aims to examine the lay perceptions of successful aging 
among elderly Chinese in Hawai'i, the state has the highest life expectancy in 
the United States. Method: Principal components factor analysis and logistic 
regression models were used to analyze survey data collected among 136 
respondents who were asked to evaluate the importance of 12 successful aging 
items developed in Asian societies involving the Chinese population. Results: 
Results from factor analysis reveal three distinct factors out of the 12 items 
of successful aging-(a) psychosocial and economic well-being, (b) physical 
well-being, and (c) social support from adult children. The former two factors 
were perceived as important dimensions of successful aging by most survey 
participants, and approximately 35%-41% respondents viewed items composing 
Factor 3 as important. Discussion: Results suggest that elderly Chinese in 
Hawai'i have unique perceptions of successful aging that go beyond the Rowe and 
Kahn's biomedical model to include more psychosocial components. In addition, 
their perceptions are similar to but slightly different from perceptions of 
elderly Chinese in China and Singapore in levels of familism. Our findings 
indicate cultural variation of successful aging.

How interdependent are stay/leave decisions? On staying in the relationship for 
the sake of the romantic partner.

Joel S(1), Impett EA(1), Spielmann SS(1), MacDonald G(1).

The decision to end a romantic relationship can have a life-changing impact on 
the partner as well as the self. Research on close relationships has thus far 
focused on self-interested reasons why people choose to stay in their 
relationship versus leave. However, a growing body of research on 
decision-making and prosociality shows that when people make decisions that 
impact others, they take those others' feelings and perspectives into 
consideration. In the present research, we tested the prediction that people 
make stay/leave decisions prosocially, such that consideration for their 
romantic partner's feelings can discourage people from ending their 
relationships. In Study 1, a total of 1,348 participants in romantic 
relationships were tracked over a 10-week period. Study 2 was a preregistered 
replication and extension of Study 1, in which 500 participants contemplating a 
breakup were followed over a 2-month period. Both studies showed that the more 
dependent people believed their partner was on the relationship, the less likely 
they were to initiate a breakup. These findings held above and beyond a variety 
of self-focused variables (e.g., investment model components; Rusbult, Martz, & 
Agnew, 1998). These results suggest that people can be motivated to stay in 
relatively unfulfilling relationships for the sake of their romantic partner.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy is greatly reduced in individuals presenting alcohol 
use disorders and chronic smoking. Literature studies suggest that common 
mechanisms may apply to the chronic use and relapse of both alcohol and 
nicotine. It is hypothesized that an increased brain oxidative stress and 
neuroinflammation are involved in perpetuating these conditions and that a 
common treatment may be considered for both.
METHODS: Rats bred as high ethanol (EtOH) drinkers (UChB) were allowed chronic 
access to EtOH solutions and water and were thereafter deprived of EtOH for a 
prolonged period, subsequently allowing reaccess to EtOH, which leads to marked 
relapse binge-like drinking. Separately, EtOH-naïve animals were chronically 
administered nicotine intraperitoneally and tested under either a conditioned 
place preference (CPP) reinstatement condition or allowed a free-choice drinking 
of nicotine solutions and water. Oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (100 mg/kg) was 
administered daily to the animals to determine its effect on both chronic 
voluntary EtOH and nicotine intake, on EtOH relapse and nicotine-CPP 
reinstatement. Oxidative stress was evaluated in hippocampus as the 
oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio (GSSG/GSH), and neuroinflammation by glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Marked increases in hippocampal oxidative stress (GSSG/GSH) and 
neuroinflammation (astrocyte reactivity, GFAP) were observed after both chronic 
EtOH and chronic nicotine treatment. Oral NAC administration (i) fully abolished 
the increased oxidative stress and the neuroinflammation induced by both drugs, 
(ii) greatly inhibited EtOH intake (70%) and EtOH relapse binge-like drinking 
(76%), and (iii) markedly inhibited (90%) voluntary nicotine intake and fully 
suppressed nicotine-CPP reinstatement.
CONCLUSIONS: Data indicate that (i) oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are 
tightly associated with chronic EtOH and nicotine intake and drug relapse and 
(ii) NAC inhibits the relapse for both drugs, suggesting that the oral chronic 
administration of NAC may be of value in the concomitant treatment of alcohol 
and nicotine use disorders.

Raven L(1).

Coast, Queensland, Australia

Over the last century human life expectancy has increased in many countries 
throughout the world. After World War II it was still accepted by the medical 
and scientific community that an infant could die suddenly and unexpectedly from 
no known cause (1). In the 1960s, this view began to be challenged and in 1963 
and 1969 two international conferences were held to focus on the etiology of 
sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and the first working definition of SIDS 
was established (1). However, given the overall decline in perinatal mortality 
during the last century due to medical advancements and higher standards of 
living, our societal expectations have changed. It has now become the norm that 
children will thrive and grow to outlive their parents, when 100 years ago this 
was frequently not the case. With our increased knowledge about how the human 
body functions and about how to prevent childhood diseases, it has become 
unthinkable that in the 21st century a healthy child would die in their sleep 
from SIDS, and yet this still happens to many families. Indeed, SIDS remains the 
leading cause of infant mortality in Western countries, contributing to half of 
all post-neonatal deaths (2, 3). For any parent there could be no greater 
nightmare than the silent tragedy of SIDS. When a child’s death is attributed to 
SIDS, a diagnosis of exclusion, the infant’s death remains unexplained even 
after a thorough investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy and 
review of the circumstances of death and clinical history (4). It has been 
estimated by Red Nose that, on average, at least 60 people are impacted by a 
child’s death to SIDS. The parents, siblings, and extended family are at the 
core of this experience, with friends, work colleagues, first responders, 
coroners, and health professionals included in the network of those impacted. 
SIDS communities have formed in every country as a result of these tragedies, 
often through the significant leadership and unrelenting passion of the families 
and individuals who have lived through the experience of SIDS. These families 
have embarked on a quest for answers as to why this tragedy happened to them, 
with their journey often involving activities undertaken in honor and memory of 
their beloved children.

With increases in life expectancy, it is vital to understand the dynamics of 
aging, their interaction with lifestyle factors, and the connections to 
age-related disease processes. Our work on environmental enrichment (EE), a 
housing environment boosting mental health, has revealed a novel anticancer and 
anti-obesity phenotype mediated by a brain-fat axis: the 
hypothalamic-sympathoneural-adipocyte (HSA) axis in young animals. Here we 
investigated EE effects on healthspan and lifespan when initiated after middle 
age. Short-term EE for six weeks activated the HSA axis in 10-month-old mice. 
Long-term EE for twelve months reduced adiposity, improved glucose tolerance, 
decreased leptin levels, enhanced motor abilities, and inhibited anxiety. In 
addition to adipose remodeling, EE decreased age-related liver steatosis, 
reduced hepatic glucose production, and increased glucose uptake by liver and 
adipose tissue contributing to the improved glycemic control. The EE-induced 
liver modulation was associated with a suppression of protein kinase Cε. 
Moreover, EE down-regulated the expression of inflammatory genes in the brain, 
adipose, and liver. EE initiated at 18-month of age significantly improved 
glycemic control and showed a trend of positive impact on mean lifespan. These 
data suggest that EE induces metabolic and behavioral adaptations that are 
shared by factors known to increase healthspan and lifespan.

Extracts of the Chinese plant Polygonum multiflorum (PME) are used for medicinal 
purposes as well as food supplement due to anti-aging effects. Despite of the 
common use of these food supplements, experimental data on physiological effects 
of PME and its underlying molecular mechanisms in vivo are limited. We used the 
model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to analyze anti-aging-effects of PME in 
vivo (life span, lipofuscin accumulation, oxidative stress resistance, thermal 
stress resistance) as well as the molecular signaling pathways involved. The 
effects of PME were examined in wildtype animals and mutants defective in the 
sirtuin-homologue SIR-2.1 (VC199) and the FOXO-homologue DAF-16 (CF1038). PME 
possesses antioxidative effects in vivo and increases oxidative stress 
resistance of the nematodes. While the accumulation of lipofuscin is only 
slightly decreased, PME causes a significant elongation (18.6%) of mean life 
span. DAF-16 is essential for the reduction of thermally induced ROS 
accumulation, while the resistance against paraquat-induced oxidative stress is 
dependent on SIR-2.1. For the extension of the life span, both DAF-16 and 
SIR-2.1 are needed. We demonstrate that PME exerts protective effects in C. 
elegans via modulation of distinct intracellular pathways.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF)-β signaling plays a crucial role in the 
development and maintenance of various organs, including the vasculature. 
Accordingly, the mutations in TGF-β signaling pathway-related genes cause 
heritable disorders of the connective tissue, such as Marfan syndrome (MFS), 
Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), and Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS), and these 
syndromes may affect skeletal, ocular, pulmonary, and cardiovascular systems. 
Aortic root aneurysms are common problems that can result in aortic dissection 
or rupture, which is the leading cause of sudden death in the natural history of 
MFS and LDS, and recent improvements in surgical treatment have improved life 
expectancy. However, there is currently no genotype-specific medical treatment. 
Accumulating evidence suggest that not only structural weakness of connective 
tissue but also increased TGF-β signaling contributes to the complicated 
pathogenesis of aortic aneurysm formation, but a comprehensive understanding of 
governing molecular mechanisms remains lacking. Inhibition of angiotensin II 
receptor signaling and endothelial dysfunction have gained attention as a
