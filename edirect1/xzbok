surgery was associated with poorer 5 year survival (adjusted log OR -0.118, 95% 
CI -0.142 to -0.094, I(2) = 70%). After adjusting for average patient age, an 
improvement in 5 year survival over the period that these data spanned was 
obtained (adjusted log OR 0.027, 95% CI 0.012 to 0.042).
CONCLUSION: Five-year survival remains poor after elective AAA repair despite 
advances in short-term outcomes and is associated with AAA diameter and patient 
age at the time of surgery. Age-adjusted survival appears to have improved; 
however, this cohort as a whole continues to have poor long-term survival. 
Research in this field should attempt to improve the life expectancy of patients 
with repaired AAA and to optimise patient selection.

[NON-ONCOLOGIC CHRONIC PAIN TREATMENT WITH OPIATES].

[Article in Spanish]

Molas Ferrer G, Castellà Kastner M, Lombraña Mencia M.

Non-oncologic chronic pain is a very common symptom. It causes great impact on 
daily activities of people who suffer it. The incidence of this type of pain is 
rising due to the increase in life expectancy. The most affected population is 
geriatric population. Back pain, osteoarthritic pain and neuropathic pain are 
the most prevalent types of non-oncologic chronic pain. Opiates, among other 
analgesic drugs, are used to alleviate this type of pain. Opiates are divided 
into minor opiates (tramadol, codeine) and major opiates (morphine, fentanyl, 
oxycodone, methadone). Opiates are very effective to treat pain, but they also 
have important adverse effects that we must know and try to prevent. One of 
these adverse effects is the opiates ability to cause dependence, tolerance, 
addiction and other aberrant behaviors. Terminology of these concepts is 
sometimes confusing. It is necessary to be careful and control the patient 
periodically in order to avoid these aberrant behaviors. However, if health 
professionals take precautions to prevent these behaviors, the risk is 
considerably reduced. Controlling patients on opiate treatment is essential to 
achieve a correct use if these drugs.

[THERAPEUTIC GUIDE IN VENOUS ULCERS].

[Article in Spanish]

López Herranz M, Bas Caro P, García Jábega RM, García Carmona FJ, Villalta 
García P, Postigo Mota S.

The treatment of venous ulcers and wounds in general, is a complex and important 
public health problem, with personal effects, family and health, without 
addressing the economic impact includes assistance, care of patients with 
ulcerative lesions. The increase in life expectancy, driven by improved 
socio-sanitary conditions that this aging population, facilitates the emergence 
of chronic diseases may be complicated by the presence of skin ulcers. There is 
no doubt that the best way to treat a skin ulcer is avoiding to occur, hence the 
importance of early diagnosis and risk factors act alone them. In relation to 
venous ulcers is crucial, provide local treatment, act on the cause, because if 
not, relapse is the norm in this type of injury. Currently, the moist wound 
healing, is an important step in solving earlier of these chronic wounds. This 
has meant that the pharmaceutical industry has been involved in researching and 
creating different types of dressings, having specific activity at different 
stages of venous ulcer healing, ie inflammatory phase, proliferative and 
remodeling. The proliferation of these products has been increasing over the 
years, not surprisingly, are described therapeutic 12 families that are applied 
in the management, care of these injuries. The fact of existing therapeutic 
options highlights the ineffectiveness of these products individually. 
Therefore, the nurse will not forget that the optimal treatment of venous 
ulcers, necessarily involves choosing the right product for every type and stage 
of the lesion. In this decision process, strongly influenced by the specific 
characteristics of each patient and injury, the nurse will take into account a 
lot of factors when choosing the product, not forgetting that an ulcer is not 
cured with a single therapeutic element, several products being used throughout 
the process to evolutionary venous ulcer until complete resolution.

[NURSING ACTION BEFORE THE TERMINAL PATIENT PHYSICAL CARE].

[Article in Spanish]

Delgado Sevilla D, Juarez Vela R, Pellicer García B, Redondo Castán LC, Ramón 
Arbués E, López Martín I, De Blas Gómez I, Alburquerque Medina E.

Palliative care is a group of actions performed by nurses in order to increase 
the comfort and well-being of patients with terminal illnesses. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) defines this term as: An approach that improves the quality 
of life of patients and their families facing the problem associated with 
life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by 
means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain 
and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual [1]. Cicely Mary Strode 
Saunders is considered as the precursor of the palliative care, who explained 
the need to change the Palliative Care Units in order to improve the quality of 
life of patients with terminal illnesses. Palliative care is necessary for 
patients with a terminal illness. In such cases, the life expectancy is less 
than six months. Human being is considered a biopsychosocial model. For this 
reason, the nurse must take into account all the requirements arising from these 
three dimensions of the human being. In this essay, we deal with palliative care 
in patients with terminal illnesses, considering the role of the nurse as an 
important reference when teaching palliative care to the main carer.

Increase in life expectancy has put neurodegenerative diseases on the rise. 
Amongst these, degenerative diseases involving hippocampus like Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) are ranked higher as it is 
vulnerable to excitotoxicity induced neuronal dysfunction and death resulting in 
cognitive impairment. Modern medicines have not succeeded in halting the 
progression of these diseases rendering them incurable and often fatal. Under 
such scenario, regenerative studies employing stem cells or their by-products in 
animal models of AD and TLE have yielded encourageing results. This review 
focuses on the distinct cell types, such as hippocampal cell lines, neural 
precursor cells, embryonic stem cells derived neural precursor cells, induced 
pluripotent stem cells, induced neurons and mesenchymal stem cells, which can be 
employed to rescue hippocampal functions in neurodegenerative diseases like AD 
and TLE. Besides, the divergent mechanisms through which cell based therapy 
confer neuroprotection, current impediments and possible improvements in stem 
cell transplantation strategies are discussed. Authors are aware of the 
voluminous literature available on this issue and have made a sincere attempt to 
put forth the current status of research in the field of cell based therapy 
concurrently discussing the promise it holds for combating neurodegenerative 
diseases like AD and TLE in the near future. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons,

INTRODUCTION: In order to help inform the discussion about the risks versus 
benefits of prostate cancer screening among older men, we determined whether 
advanced age is associated with a higher probability of harboring high-grade or 
high-risk disease.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 
database was used to identify 383,039 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in 
2004-2011. The percentage of patients diagnosed with low-, intermediate-, or 
high-risk disease or a Gleason score of 6, 7, or 8 to 10 was calculated by age 
range. As a secondary analysis, we examined whether this relationship was 
different in 2010-2011 versus 2007-2008 (before and after the 2009 publication 
of screening trials).
RESULTS: The probability of Gleason score 8 to 10 or high-risk disease increased 
significantly with increasing age. The percentage of Gleason score 8 to 10 
disease among men ages 50 to 54, 70 to 74, and 80 to 84 years was 8.9%, 16.2%, 
and 28.5%, respectively, and the percentage of high-risk disease was 14.3%, 
22.4%, and 38.7% (P < .001). There were similar relationships among men with 
stage T1c disease. In addition, older men experienced a significant increase in 
the relative probability of high-risk or high-grade disease from 2007-2008 to 
2010-2011.
CONCLUSION: In this large US-based cohort, older men had a much higher 
probability of high-grade or high-risk prostate cancer. Physicians and patients 
should take into account the higher risk of more aggressive or advanced disease 
in older men when discussing the risks and benefits of prostate-specific antigen 
screening with healthy older men with a substantial life expectancy.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing a patient navigation 
(PN) program with capitated payment for Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with 
lung cancer.
DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model to capture the disease progression of lung cancer 
and characterize clinical benefits of PN services as timeliness of treatment and 
care coordination. Taking a payer's perspective, we estimated the lifetime 
costs, life years (LYs), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and addressed 
uncertainties in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Model inputs were extracted from the 
literature, supplemented with data from a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services demonstration project.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared to usual care, PN services incurred higher costs 
but also yielded better outcomes. The incremental cost and effectiveness was 
$9,145 and 0.47 QALYs, respectively, resulting in an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of $19,312/QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis indicated 
that findings were most sensitive to a parameter capturing PN survival benefit 
for local-stage patients. CE-acceptability curve showed the probability that the 
PN program was cost-effective was 0.80 and 0.91 at a societal willingness-to-pay 
of $50,000 and $100,000/QALY, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Instituting a capitated PN program is cost-effective for lung cancer 
patients in Medicare. Future research should evaluate whether the same 
conclusion holds in other cancers.

OBJECTIVES: (1) Assess the health-related physical fitness of adults with 
ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and compare these to the general population, and (2) 
examine the relationships between physical fitness and condition-specific 
outcomes.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional, controlled study.
SETTING: Exercise research laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-nine adults with AS (32 men, 7 women) and 39 age- and 
gender-matched controls.
INTERVENTION: Comprehensive physical fitness assessment, and completion of 
questionnaires assessing disease activity, physical function and 
quality-of-life.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body composition was assessed by bio-impedance analysis. 
Flexibility was measured with the Bath AS Metrology Index (BASMI). 
Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by submaximal treadmill test with 
breath-by-breath gas analysis and heart rate monitoring. Muscular strength and 
endurance were measured by isokinetic dynamometry of concentric knee 
flexion/extension.
RESULTS: The AS group demonstrated significantly lower cardiorespiratory fitness 
[mean difference -1.3mLmin(-1)kg(-1) (95% CI -1.1 to -1.4)], flexibility [0.4 
BASMI units (0.2 to 0.7)], muscular strength [-31.6 peak torque per body weight 
dominant knee extension (-56.1 to -7.1)], and increased body fat [0.4% (0.0 to 
1.2)] compared to population controls (p<.05). There were significant 
associations between each fitness component and physical function (p<.05). 
Higher aerobic capacity was significantly associated with improved 
quality-of-life. Fitness was not significantly associated with disease activity.
CONCLUSION: Adults with AS have significantly reduced health-related physical 
fitness compared to population controls. Decreased body fat, and higher aerobic 
capacity, muscular fitness and flexibility are significantly associated with 
improved function. These findings have implications for clinicians assessing 
adults with AS, and for targeted-exercise prescription in this cohort.

Previous studies have demonstrated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 
controls autophagy through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Unc-51 
like kinase 1 (ULK1/Atg1) signaling, which augments the quality of cellular 
housekeeping, and that β-guanidinopropionic acid (β-GPA), a creatine analog, 
leads to a chronic activation of AMPK. However, the relationship between β-GPA 
and aging remains elusive. In this study, we hypothesized that feeding β-GPA to 
adult Drosophila produces the lifespan extension via activation of 
AMPK-dependent autophagy. It was found that dietary administration of β-GPA at a 
concentration higher than 900 mm induced a significant extension of the lifespan 
of Drosophila melanogaster in repeated experiments. Furthermore, we found that 
Atg8 protein, the homolog of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 
(LC3) and a biomarker of autophagy in Drosophila, was significantly upregulated 
by β-GPA treatment, indicating that autophagic activity plays a role in the 
effect of β-GPA. On the other hand, when the expression of Atg5 protein, an 
essential protein for autophagy, was reduced by RNA interference (RNAi), the 
effect of β-GPA on lifespan extension was abolished. Moreover, we found that 
AMPK was also involved in this process. β-GPA treatment significantly elevated 
the expression of phospho-T172-AMPK levels, while inhibition of AMPK by either 
AMPK-RNAi or compound C significantly attenuated the expression of 
autophagy-related proteins and lifespan extension in Drosophila. Taken together, 
our results suggest that β-GPA can induce an extension of the lifespan of 
Drosophila via AMPK-Atg1-autophagy signaling pathway.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the level and trend of diabetes mellitus (DM) in Mexico, 
and its contribution to the changes in temporary life expectancy between 20 and 
100 years of age, in the period 1990-2010.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data comes from National Mortality Vital Statistics and 
from the Population Census from the Mexican National Institute of Geography and 
Statistics (INEGI). We calculated standardized mortality rates. To analyze the 
impact of DM on the temporary life expectancy (80e20) we used Pollards method.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2010, the standardized mortality rate for people 20 
years and older increased by 224 %. The contribution of DM for men to the change 
in life expectancy during 1990-2000 was a reduction of 0.31 years; for women was 
a reduction of 0.32 years; in the period 2000-2010 the reduction continued for 
both men and women (0.34 and 0.12 years respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality from DM continues to increase, especially for men, but 
for women a modest reduction was observed. It is essential to apply health 
services and programs aimed at reducing mortality from this cause, focused on 
prevention, early detection and timely treatment, with concrete actions on 
vulnerable groups.

INTRODUCTION: Dysphonia is a potential long-term complication of preterm birth. 
Childhood voice disorders caused by vocal hyperfunction resolve with pubertal 
changes to the vocal mechanism in many cases. In extremely preterm children, 
whose voice quality is affected by supraglottic hyperfunction adapted secondary 
to underlying structural laryngeal pathology sustained during neonatal 
intubation, the prognosis is unknown.
METHODS: A pilot study was conducted to assess the incidence and severity of 
dysphonia in children born at < 25 weeks' gestation. Ten individuals, aged 
between 9.67 and 17.08 years, presented for repeat assessment in a replication 
and extension of the original study. The mean period between assessments was 
2.85 (SD 0.38) years. The primary outcome measure was the severity score on the 
Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V), with the Acoustic 
Voice Quality Index score as the secondary outcome measure. Scores on the 
Pediatric Voice Handicap Index were also compared.
RESULTS: Perceptual dysphonia severity scores were significantly lower on repeat 
assessment, but no differences were observed in objective or quality of life 
scores. Individual variation was observed: the difference in CAPE-V scores 
ranged from -36 to + 1. No participant presented with normal voice quality on 
repeat assessment.
DISCUSSION: Analysis of group data masked individual variability in this series. 
Mechanisms underlying such individual variation are currently unknown. These 
data suggest that dysphonia is persistent in extremely preterm children.
CONCLUSION: Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the progression of 
voice disorders in extremely preterm children, to inform prognostic predictors 
and treatment decisions.

BACKGROUND: Forecasting the disease burden of the elderly will contribute to 
make a comprehensive assessment about physical and mental status of the elderly 
in China and provide a basis for reducing the negative consequences of aging 
society to a minimum.
METHODS: This study collected data from a public database online provided by 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. Grey model GM (1, 1) was used to forecast 
all-cause and disease-specific rates of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) 
in 2015 and 2020.
RESULTS: After cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis, we found that 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were still the greatest threats in the elderly, 
followed by injuries. As for 136 predicted causes, more than half of NCDs 
increased obviously with age, less than a quarter of communicable, material, 
neonatal, and nutritional disorders or injuries had uptrend.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings display the health condition of the Chinese elderly in 
the future, which will provide critical information for scientific and 
sociological researches on preventing and reducing the risks of aging society.

Associations between the fasting levels of serum lipid and amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS) in Chinese populations remain largely unknown. Our objective was 
to analyse data from a cohort of ALS patients to determine these associations. 
Four hundred and thirteen ALS patients and 400 age- and gender-matched healthy 
controls were included. Fasting serum lipid concentration of all subjects, 
including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG), were measured at the time of first 
visit. The revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) was used to assess the 
severity of ALS. Systems Analysis by Review Manager 5 was used to evaluate 
differences in dyslipidaemia between ALS patients and controls. Results showed 
that ALS patients with higher triglyceride levels had longer survival time 
compared to patients with lower triglyceride levels (p < 0.05). We found a 
median prolonged life expectancy of 5.8 months for patients with serum 
triglyceride levels above the median of 127.5 mg/dl. Cox regression analysis 
indicated that disease duration and age were positively correlated with death, 
and triglyceride was positively correlated with survival. A meta-analysis 
indicated that there were no significant differences in mean total cholesterol, 
TG, LDL or the LDL/HDL ratio between patients and controls. In conclusion, high 
serum TG might be a protective factor for the survival of patients with ALS.

The autoimmune diseases are among the 10 leading causes of death for women and 
the number two cause of chronic illness in America as well as a predisposing 
factor for cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Patients of some autoimmune 
diseases have shown a shorter life span and are a model of accelerated 
immunosenescence. Conversely, centenarians are used as a model of successful 
aging and have shown several immune parameters that are better preserved and 
lower levels of autoantibodies. The study reported here focused on clarifying 
the connection between longevity and some autoimmune and allergic diseases in 29 
developed Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
countries, because multidisciplinary analyses of the accelerated or delayed 
aging data could show a distinct relationship pattern, help to identify common 
factors, and determine new important factors that contribute to longevity and 
healthy aging. The relationships between the mortality rates data of multiple 
sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), asthma, the incidence of type 1 
diabetes (T1D) from one side and centenarian rates (two sets) as well as life 
expectancy data from the other side were assessed using regression models and 
Pearson correlation coefficients. The data obtained correspond to an inverse 
linear correlation with different degrees of linearity. This is the first 
observation of a clear tendency of diminishing centenarian rates or life 
expectancy in countries having higher death rates of asthma, MS, and RA and a 
higher incidence of T1D in children. The conclusion is that most probably there 
are common mechanistic pathways and factors affecting the above diseases and at 
the same time but in the opposite direction the processes of longevity. Further 
study, comparing genetic data, mechanistic pathways, and other factors connected 
to autoimmune diseases with those of longevity could clarify the processes 
involved, so as to promote longevity and limit the expansion of those diseases 
in the younger and older population.

The life expectancy continues to gradually increase worldwide. Laparoscopic 
liver resection (LLR) was recently reported to be a relatively safe procedure 
for treatment of liver disease because of the development of new techniques and 
instruments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical outcomes of 
elderly patients who underwent LLR. Of these 61 patients who underwent LLR in 
our institute from January 2010 through April 2014, 21 were aged 75 years and 
above (group E), and 40 were aged below 75 years (group NE). Patient 
characteristics were retrospectively analyzed between the 2 groups. The results 
showed that patient characteristics were similar between the 2 groups, although 
the incidence of hypertension was significantly greater among patients in group 
E. There were no significant differences in the incidence of postoperative 
complications or length of hospital stay between the 2 groups. In conclusion, 
LLR for elderly patients was a feasible procedure compared with nonelderly 
patients.

Muscle-specific 4E-BP1 signaling activation improves metabolic parameters during 
aging and obesity.

Tsai S, Sitzmann JM, Dastidar SG, Rodriguez AA, Vu SL, McDonald CE, Academia EC, 
O'Leary MN, Ashe TD, La Spada AR, Kennedy BK.

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) is a key 
downstream effector of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) that represses cap-dependent mRNA 
translation initiation by sequestering the translation initiation factor eIF4E. 
Reduced mTORC1 signaling is associated with life span extension and improved 
metabolic homeostasis, yet the downstream targets that mediate these benefits 
are unclear. Here, we demonstrated that enhanced 4E-BP1 activity in mouse 
skeletal muscle protects against age- and diet-induced insulin resistance and 
metabolic rate decline. Transgenic animals displayed increased energy 
expenditure; altered adipose tissue distribution, including reduced white 
adipose accumulation and preserved brown adipose mass; and were protected from 
hepatic steatosis. Skeletal muscle-specific 4E-BP1 mediated metabolic protection 
directly through increased translation of peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and enhanced respiratory function. Non-cell 
autonomous protection was through preservation of brown adipose tissue 
metabolism, which was increased in 4E-BP1 transgenic animals during normal aging 
and in a response to diet-induced type 2 diabetes. Adipose phenotypes may derive 
from enhanced skeletal muscle expression and secretion of the known myokine 
FGF21. Unlike skeletal muscle, enhanced adipose-specific 4E-BP1 activity was not 
protective but instead was deleterious in response to the same challenges. These 
findings indicate that regulation of 4E-BP1 in skeletal muscle may serve as an 
important conduit through which mTORC1 controls metabolism.

There is increasing interest in forensic ancestry tests, which are part of a 
growing number of DNA analyses that can enhance routine profiling by obtaining 
additional genetic information about unidentified DNA donors. Nearly all 
ancestry tests use single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but these currently 
rely on SNaPshot single base extension chemistry that can fail to detect mixed 
DNA. Insertion-deletion polymorphism (Indel) tests have been developed using 
dye-labeled primers that allow direct capillary electrophoresis detection of PCR 
products (PCR-to-CE). PCR-to-CE maintains the direct relationship between input 
DNA and signal strength as each marker is detected with a single dye, so mixed 
DNA is more reliably detected. We report the results of a collaborative 
inter-laboratory exercise of 19 participants (15 from the EDNAP European DNA 
Profiling group) that assessed a 34-plex SNP test using SNaPshot and a 46-plex 
Indel test using PCR-to-CE. Laboratories were asked to type five samples with 
different ancestries and detect an additional mixed DNA sample. Statistical 
inference of ancestry was made by participants using the Snipper online Bayes 
analysis portal plus an optional PCA module that analyzes the genotype data 
alongside calculation of Bayes likelihood ratios. Exercise results indicated 
consistent genotyping performance from both tests, reaching a particularly high 
level of reliability for the Indel test. SNP genotyping gave 93.5% concordance 
(compared to the organizing laboratory's data) that rose to 97.3% excluding one 
laboratory with a large number of miscalled genotypes. Indel genotyping gave a 
higher concordance rate of 99.8% and a reduced no-call rate compared to SNP 
analysis. All participants detected the mixture from their Indel peak height 
data and successfully assigned the correct ancestry to the other samples using 
Snipper, with the exception of one laboratory with SNP miscalls that incorrectly 
assigned ancestry of two samples and did not obtain informative likelihood 
ratios for a third. Therefore, successful ancestry assignments were achieved by 
participants in 92 of 95 Snipper analyses. This exercise demonstrates that 
ancestry inference tests based on binary marker sets can be readily adopted by 
laboratories that already have well-established CE regimes in place. The Indel 
test proved to be easy to use and allowed all exercise participants to detect 
the DNA mixture as well as achieving complete and concordant profiles in nearly 
all cases. Lastly, two participants successfully ran parallel next-generation 
sequencing analyses (each using different systems) and achieved high levels of 
genotyping concordance using the exercise PCR primer mixes unmodified.

An efficient case finding strategy to diagnose osteoporosis in a developing 
society with low treatment frequency.

OBJECTIVES: Osteoporosis is a debilitating condition with rising frequency of 
fragility fractures with advancing age. Life expectancy increases in developing 
societies with the emergence of osteoporosis. There is a need for a simple 
protocol to diagnose fractures that merit treatment for osteoporosis.
METHODS: Evaluation of all consecutive lateral chest radiographs performed at 
the National Hospital in the capital city in Greenland over a 3-month period for 
vertebral body heights at the anterior, middle and posterior regions. Use of 
anti-osteoporotic drug was evaluated from records of dispensed drugs from 
Greenland National Pharmacy.
RESULTS: 1869 vertebrae were evaluated on radiographs from 203 subjects. On 
average 9.2 vertebrae (range 5-13) qualified for evaluation in each individual. 
Median (range) age was 55 (30-82) years. Any vertebral deformity above 25 (20) % 
was seen in 28.6 (50.2) %. More than one fracture was seen in 10.3 (27.1) %. 
Fractures occurred in 18.5 (36.9) % of patients from the General Medicine Clinic 
and in 33.3 (56.5) % of inpatients (p = 0.029). The occurrence of vertebral 
fractures increased with age (p < 0.001) and hosting more than one vertebral 
fracture was markedly more frequent after the age of 60 years [OR, 95 % CI 9.6, 
3.1-30 (5.7, 2.9-11); p < 0.001] after correction for gender in logistic 
regressions. The National Pharmacy handed out anti-osteoporotic drugs equal to 
the treatment of 36 individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral fractures that merit treatment can be readily diagnosed 
from lateral chest radiographs taken in routine clinical work-up. They are 
common in Greenland as demonstrated by this simple protocol to improve diagnosis 
and treatment of osteoporosis in a developing society.

Corruption costs lives: a cross-country study using an IV approach.

Lio MC(1), Lee MH(1).

Author information:

Taiwan.

This study quantitatively estimates the effects of corruption on five major 
health indicators by using recent cross-country panel data covering 119 
countries for the period of 2005-2011. The corruption indicators provided by the 
World Bank and Transparency International are used, and both the two-way fixed 
effect and the two-stage least squares approaches are employed for our 
estimation. The estimation results show that, in general, corruption is 
negatively associated with a country's health outcomes. A lower level of 
corruption or a better control of corruption in a country can lead to longer 
life expectancy, a lower infant mortality rate and a lower under-five mortality 
rate for citizens. However, our estimation finds no significant association 
between corruption and individual diseases including human immunodeficiency 
virus prevalence and tuberculosis incidence. The findings suggest that 
corruption reduction itself is an effective method to promote health. Copyright

Classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (c-BSE) is the only animal prion 
disease reputed to be zoonotic, causing variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) 
in humans and having guided protective measures for animal and human health 
against animal prion diseases. Recently, partial transmissions to humanized mice 
showed that the zoonotic potential of scrapie might be similar to c-BSE. We here 
report the direct transmission of a natural classical scrapie isolate to 
cynomolgus macaque, a highly relevant model for human prion diseases, after a 
10-year silent incubation period, with features similar to those reported for 
human cases of sporadic CJD. Scrapie is thus actually transmissible to primates 
with incubation periods compatible with their life expectancy, although fourfold 
longer than BSE. Long-term experimental transmission studies are necessary to 
better assess the zoonotic potential of other prion diseases with high 
prevalence, notably Chronic Wasting Disease of deer and elk and atypical/Nor98 
scrapie.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is limited information about the economic impact of 
nutritional support despite its known clinical benefits. This systematic review 
examined the cost and cost effectiveness of using standard (non-disease 
specific) oral nutritional supplements (ONS) administered in the hospital 
setting only.
METHODS: A systematic literature search of multiple databases, data synthesis 
and analysis were undertaken according to recommended procedures.
RESULTS: Nine publications comprising four full text papers, two abstracts and 
three reports, one of which contained 11 cost analyses of controlled cohort 
studies, were identified. Most of these were based on retrospective analyses of 
randomised controlled trials designed to assess clinically relevant outcomes. 
The sample sizes of patients with surgical, orthopaedic and medical problems and 
combinations of these varied from 40 to 1.16 million. Of 14 cost analyses 
comparing ONS with no ONS (or routine care), 12 favoured the ONS group, and 
among those with quantitative data (12 studies) the mean cost saving was 12.2%. 
In a meta-analysis of five abdominal surgical studies in the UK, the mean net 
cost saving was £746 per patient (se £338; P = 0.027). Cost savings were 
typically associated with significantly improved outcomes, demonstrated through 
the following meta-analyses: reduced mortality (Risk ratio 0.650, P < 0.05; 
N = 5 studies), reduced complications (by 35% of the total; P < 0.001, N = 7 
studies) and reduced length of hospital stay (by ∼2 days, P < 0.05; N = 5 
surgical studies) corresponding to ∼13.0% reduction in hospital stay. Two 
studies also found ONS to be cost effective, one by avoiding development of 
pressure ulcers and releasing hospital beds, and the other by gaining quality 
adjusted life years.
CONCLUSION: This review suggests that standard ONS in the hospital setting 
produce a cost saving and are cost effective. The evidence base could be further 
strengthened by prospective studies in which the primary outcome measures are 
economic.

BACKGROUND: The Solanaceae are an economically important family of plants that 
include tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), tomato, and potato. Drought is a major 
cause of crop losses.
RESULTS: We have identified major changes in physiology, metabolites, mRNA 
levels, and promoter activities during the tobacco response to drought. We have 
classified these as potential components of core responses that may be common to 
many plant species or responses that may be family/species-specific features of 
the drought stress response in tobacco or the Solanaceae. In tobacco the largest 
increase in any metabolite was a striking 70-fold increase in 
4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutaric acid (KHG) in roots that appears to be 
tobacco/Solanaceae specific. KHG is poorly characterized in plants but is broken 
down to pyruvate and glyoxylate after the E. coli SOS response to facilitate the 
resumption of respiration. A similar process in tobacco would represent a 
mechanism to restart respiration upon water availability after drought. At the 
mRNA level, transcription factor gene induction by drought also showed both core 
and species/family specific responses. Many Group IX Subgroup 3 AP2/ERF 
transcription factors in tobacco appear to play roles in nicotine biosynthesis 
as a response to herbivory, whereas their counterparts in legume species appear 
to play roles in drought responses. We observed apparent Solanaceae-specific 
drought induction of several Group IId WRKY genes. One of these, NtWRKY69, 
showed ABA-independent drought stress-inducible promoter activity that moved 
into the leaf through the vascular tissue and then eventually into the 
surrounding leaf cells.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose components of a core metabolic response to drought 
stress in plants and also show that some major responses to drought stress at 
the metabolome and transcriptome levels are family specific. We therefore 
propose that the observed family-specific changes in metabolism are regulated, 
at least in part, by family-specific changes in transcription factor activity. 
We also present a list of potential targets for the improvement of Solanaceae 
drought responses.
