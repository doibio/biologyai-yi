recordings from the transgenic mice at rest demonstrated the normal sinus rhythm 
and the regular ECG complex as well as the control WT mice except for prolonged 
QT interval. However, the stress ECG test with noradrenaline revealed abnormal 
intraventricular conduction delay and arrhythmogeneity in the transgenic mouse. 
Fibrotic changes in the heart tissue were remarkable in aged transgenic mice, 
and the cardiac fibrosis developed progressively at least from the age of 30 
weeks. Gene expression analyses revealed the differentiation of cardiac 
fibroblasts to myofibroblasts with elevated cytokine expressions was initiated 
way in advance before the fibrotic changes and the upregulation of BNP in the 
ventricle. In sum, Kir6.1TG mice provide an electro-pathological disease concept 
originated from KATP channel dysfunction.

Rejuvenation of stem cell activity might increase life expectancy by prolonging 
functionality of organs. Higher stem cell replication rates also bear the risk 
of cancer. The extent of this risk is not known. While it is difficult to 
evaluate this cancer risk in experiments, it can be estimated using a 
mathematical model for tissue homeostasis by stem cell replication and 
associated cancer risk. The model recapitulates the observation that treatments 
targeting stem cell replication can induce a substantial delay of organ failure. 
The model predicts that the cancer risk is minor under particular conditions. It 
depends on the assumed implications for cell damage repair during treatment. The 
benefit of rejuvenation therapy and its impact on cancer risk depend on the 
biological age at the time of treatment and on the overall cell turnover rate of 
the organs. Different organs have to be considered separately in the planning of 
systemic treatments. In recent years, the transfer of blood from young to old 
individuals was shown to bear the potential of rejuvenation of stem cell 
activity. In this context, the model predicts that the treatment schedule is 
critical for success and that schedules successful in animal experiments are not 
transferable to humans. Guidelines for successful protocols are proposed. The 
model presented here may be used as a guidance for the development of stem cell 
rejuvenation treatment protocols and the identification of critical parameters 
for cancer risk.

Background: Cognitive impairment is a manifestation of cerebrovascular disease 
regarding hypertension and other degenerative diseases which has become a global 
health issue due to increased life expectancy. Recently, the gold standard used 
for diagnosing vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) has required a combination of 
the neurophysiological approach and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The 
Neurosonological approach, involving measuring the pulsatility index (PI) of the 
middle cerebral artery (MCA) using Trans Cranial Doppler (TCD), can hopefully be 
used as an affordable alternative predictor of VCI in patients with 
hypertension. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Outpatient 
Clinic of the Department of Neurology in Ciptomangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta. 
Sixty-six hypertensive subjects with no macrovascular complication were selected 
and screened using the Montreal Cognitive Assesment-Indonesia version (MoCA-Ina) 
to determine their cognitive status. Subjects were categorized into two groups; 
subjects with scores ≥26 were classified as the normal cognitive group, while 
subjects with scores <26 were classified as the cognitive impairment group. Both 
groups then underwent TCD examination to determine bilateral MCA PI. Results: 
There was a significant difference between MCA PI in both groups; it was higher 
in the cognitive impairment group than normal group (p < 0.001). Subjects with 
an increased left MCA PI were more likely to suffer cognitive impairment than 
those with an increased right MCA PI. Conclusion: MCA PI can be used as a 
predictor for cognitive impairment in hypertensive subjects.

BACKGROUND: Many patients who receive chronic hemodialysis have a limited life 
expectancy comparable to that of patients with metastatic cancer. However, 
patterns of home palliative care use among patients receiving hemodialysis are 
unknown.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to undertake a current-state analysis to inform measurement 
and quality improvement in palliative service use in Ontario.
METHODS: We conducted a descriptive study of outcomes and home palliative care 
use by Ontario residents maintained on chronic dialysis using multiple 
provincial healthcare datasets. The period of study was the final year of life, 
for those died between January 2010 and December 2014.
RESULTS: We identified 9611 patients meeting inclusion criteria. At death, 
patients were (median [Q1, Q3] or %): 75 (66, 82) years old, on dialysis for 3.0 
(1.0-6.0) years, 41% were women, 65% had diabetes, 29.6% had dementia, and 13.9% 
had high-impact neoplasms, and 19.9% had discontinued dialysis within 30 days of 
death. During the last year of life, 13.1% received ⩾1 home palliative services. 
Compared with patients who had no palliative services, those who received home 
palliative care visits had fewer emergency department and intensive care unit 
visits in the last 30 days of life, more deaths at home (17.1 vs 1.4%), and a 
lower frequency of deaths with an associated intensive care unit stay (8.1 vs 
37.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Only a small proportion of patients receiving dialysis in Ontario 
received support through the home palliative care system. There appears to be an 
opportunity to improve palliative care support in parallel with dialysis care, 
which may improve patient, family, and health-system outcomes.

Publisher: CONTEXTE: L’espérance de vie de bon nombre de patients traités par 
hémodialyse chronique se compare à celle des patients atteints d’un cancer 
métastatique. Cependant, les tendances d’utilisation des soins palliatifs à 
domicile chez les patients hémodialysés sont encore peu connues.
OBJECTIF DE L’ÉTUDE: Nous souhaitions faire une analyse de l’état actuel des 
choses afin d’éclairer sur la mesure et l’amélioration de la qualité des soins 
palliatifs en Ontario.
MÉTHODOLOGIE: Nous avons mené une étude descriptive des issues pour les patients 
et de l’utilisation des soins palliatifs à domicile chez les patients 
hémodialysés en Ontario. Plusieurs ensembles de données provinciales en soins de 
santé ont été employés pour procéder à l’analyse. La dernière année de vie des 
patients décédés entre janvier 2010 et décembre 2014 a constitué la période 
étudiée.
RÉSULTATS: Les patients satisfaisant les critères d’inclusion étaient au nombre 
de 9 611. La cohorte était constituée à 41 % de femmes. Au moment du décès, 
l’âge médian (Q1; Q3) des patients était de 75 ans (66; 82 ans) et la médiane de 
la durée des traitements d’hémodialyse était de trois ans en moyenne (1,0; 6,0 
ans). Parmi les comorbidités recensées au décès, 65 % des patients étaient aussi 
diabétiques, environ un tiers (29,3 %) étaient atteints de démence et 13,9 % 
présentaient des néoplasmes. Dans les 30 jours précédant leur décès, 19,9 % des 
patients avaient cessé leurs traitements de dialyse. Au cours de la dernière 
année de vie, seulement 13,1 % des patients de la cohorte avaient reçu au moins 
un service de soins palliatifs à domicile. Lorsque comparés aux patients n’ayant 
reçu aucun service en soins palliatifs, ils se sont moins souvent présentés aux 
urgences et ont moins souvent séjourné dans les unités de soins intensifs. De 
plus, une plus grande proportion des patients ayant reçu des soins palliatifs 
sont décédés à domicile, soit 17,1 % contre 1,4 % des patients n’ayant reçu 
aucun service en soins palliatifs. Enfin, le taux de mortalité associé à un 
séjour aux soins intensifs s’est avéré bien inférieur chez les patients qui 
avaient reçu des soins palliatifs, soit 8,1 % contre 37,8 % pour les patients 
n’ayant reçu aucun service de soins palliatifs.
CONCLUSION: En Ontario, une très faible proportion des patients hémodialysés a 
reçu du soutien par l’entremise du système de soins palliatifs à domicile au 
cours de la période étudiée. Il semble donc y avoir une possibilité d’améliorer 
l’offre de soins palliatifs parallèlement aux traitements de dialyse; et ceci 
pourrait avoir une incidence positive sur les patients et leurs proches, de même 
que sur le système de santé.

BACKGROUND: People with severe mental illness (SMI) show significantly shorter 
life expectancy, mostly due to more prevalent cardiovascular disease. Although 
age is a prominent contributor to contemporary risk assessment and SMI usually 
affects younger people, these assessments still do not reveal the actual risk. 
By assessing advanced glycation end products (AGEs), cardiovascular risk can be 
assessed independent of age.
AIMS: To establish whether detection of AGEs with the AGE-reader will give a 
more accurate cardiovascular risk assessment in people with SMI.
METHOD: We compared assessment with the AGE-reader with that of the Systematic 
Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) table in a group of 120 patients with SMI.
RESULTS: The AGE-reader showed an increased cardiovascular risk more often than 
the SCORE table, especially in the youngest group.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of its ease of use and substantiation by studies done on 
other chronic diseases, we advocate use of the AGE-reader in daily care for 
patients with SMI to detect cardiovascular risk as early as possible. However, 
the findings of the current study should be evaluated with caution and should be 
seen as preliminary findings that require confirmation by a prospective 
longitudinal cohort study with a substantial follow-up observation period.

Productivity change of national health systems in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean 
region: application of DEA-based Malmquist productivity index.

Masri MD(1), Asbu EZ(1).

Author information:

Arab Emirates.

BACKGROUND: The pursuit of efficiency and productivity is one of the goals of 
health systems. In the era of Sustainable Development Goals and particularly the 
move towards universal health coverage, it is imperative to curb wastage of 
resources to ensure sustainable access of the population to needed and effective 
health services without enduring financial hardship. This study aims to assess 
total factor productivity change of national health systems of 20 countries in 
the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Region.
METHODS: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-based Malmquist index is used to assess 
total factor productivity change and its components - efficiency change and 
technical change. To assess the robustness of the Malmquist index estimates, 
bootstrapping was performed. Outputs used are life expectancy at birth for both 
sexes and infant mortality; while total expenditure on health per capita in 
international dollars (PPP) is used as a measure of input. Panel data for the 
period 2003-2014 was extracted from databases of the WHO and the World Bank.
RESULTS: In all but five countries covered in the study, a decline in the mean 
total factor productivity is observed during the period 2003-2014. The decline 
is driven by technical regress. In all countries, the technical change component 
of the Malmquist TFP index is less than unity (range: 0.896 to 0.945). All 
countries exhibited growth in efficiency (efficiency change exceeding one) 
except two countries (Djibouti and Iraq). The growth in efficiency was mainly 
due to change in scale efficiency. Overall, total factor productivity in the 
region declined by 3.8%. This was due to a 9.1% decline in technical change, 
which overshadowed the 5.8% increase in efficiency. Three countries - Libya, 
Qatar and Yemen - showed a marginal growth in total factor productivity. There 
was no change in total factor productivity in Kuwait and Lebanon.
CONCLUSION: The decline in total factor productivity over the study period is 
likely to hamper achieving the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 3 of 
ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. It is 
recommended that country-level studies on efficiency and productivity of health 
systems be conducted in order to intensively examine the determinants of 
inefficiency and productivity decline and implement appropriate interventions 
that could enhance efficiency and productivity.

BACKGROUND: Evidence-based policy measures need non-interest-guided information 
about the health status of a population and the diseases that affect the 
population the most. In such cases, a national burden of disease study can 
provide reliable insights at the regional level.
AIM: This article presents the potential of the BURDEN 2020 project and its 
expected outcome for Germany at the national and regional level.
METHODS: The BURDEN 2020 project uses several indicators including years of life 
lost (YLL) to cover the impact of mortality and years lived with disability 
(YLD) to cover morbidity. The sum of both is the measure of population health 
called disability adjusted life years (DALY).
RESULTS: The study ranks individual diseases and risk factors based on their 
impact on population health. The burden of disease approach is assumed to be 
sensitive to subnational differences and may generate immediate benefits for 
regional planning. The BURDEN 2020 study will pilot a national burden of disease 
study for Germany that will later be transformed into a continuous data 
processing and visualization tool. This is done by using, modifying and 
supplementing the methodology employed by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
study to better fit the needs of health policy in Germany. This study is aimed 
at calculating the disease burden for up to 17 preselected diseases. 
Furthermore, the estimates of burden of disease are attributed to a selected set 
of risk factors.
CONCLUSION: The Burden 2020 study will provide the results of a new, 
health-related data processing system to the public. This includes 
a noninterest-guided presentation of the burden of disease (DALY) in Germany at 
the national and regional level.

Comment in
    Lancet Oncol. 2022 Apr;23(4):447-449.

The precise population of the Palestinian territories is disputed, but a 2017 
estimate was 4 543 126 people, including 2 155 743 people in the West Bank and 
1 795 183 in Gaza. The Palestinian territories rank 121st out of 233 countries 
and dependencies by population (its people comprise 0·07% of the world 
population). Palestinian health care has been a major concern since the 1994 
Oslo agreement when the Palestinian Authority took over the administration of 
health care for the region. This effort has been supported by WHO and foreign 
donors, especially the US Government. Despite major political, economic and 
social challenges for the region, health care in Palestine is one of the best 
among Arab countries in terms of life expectancy and maternal, infant, and child 
mortality rates. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Palestine at 
14%, exceeded only by heart disease at 30%. The cancer burden in Palestine is 
expected to increase, reaching levels that further challenge the financial and 
infrastructural resources of the current health-care system, of which financial 
and political uncertainty exacerbate the problem. In this Review, we discuss the 
current state of cancer care in the Palestinian territories including 
epidemiology, screening, and prevention efforts, and infrastructural and 
workforce issues for the region. We also discuss examples of some encouraging 
progress that has been made for health in the region and the enormous challenges 
that the Palestinian health-care system still faces.

Conjugating a hydrophilic and protein-resistant polymer to a protein is a widely 
used strategy to extend the in vivo half-life of the protein; however, the 
benefit of the half-life extension is usually limited by the bioactivity 
decrease. Herein we report a supramolecular self-assembly strategy of 
site-specific in situ polymerization induced self-assembly (SI-PISA) to address 
the dilemma. An amphiphilic block copolymer (POEGMA-PHPMA) was directly grown 
from the C-terminus of an important therapeutic protein interferon-α (IFN) to in 
situ form IFN-POEGMA-PHPMA conjugate micelles. Notably, the in vitro bioactivity 
of the micelles was 21.5-fold higher than that of the FDA-approved PEGylated 
interferon-α PEGASYS. Particularly, the in vivo half-life of the micelles (83.8 
h) was 1.7- and 100-fold longer than those of PEGASYS (49.5 h) and IFN (0.8 h), 
respectively. In a tumor-bearing mouse model, the micelles completely suppressed 
tumor growth with 100% animal survival, whereas at the same dose, PEGASYS and 
IFN were much less effective. These findings suggest that SI-PISA is promising 
as a next-generation technology to remarkably enhance the pharmacological 
performance of therapeutic proteins with short circulation half-lives.

OBJECTIVES: Young adults undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) have 
decreased life expectancy compared to matched controls. The Ross procedure aims 
to improve valve lifespan while avoiding anticoagulation. We prepared a 
systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the Ross procedure compared to 
conventional AVR.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane CENTRAL for studies evaluating 
the Ross procedure versus any conventional AVR in adult patients. We performed 
screening, full-text assessment, risk of bias evaluation and data collection 
independently and in duplicate. We evaluated the risk of bias with the ROBINS-I 
and Cochrane tools and quality of evidence with the GRADE framework. We pooled 
data using the random- and fixed-effects models.
RESULTS: Thirteen observational studies and 2 randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) were identified (n = 5346). No observational study was rated as having 
low risk of bias. The Ross procedure was associated with decreased late 
mortality in observational and RCT data [mean length of follow-up 2.6 years, 
relative risk (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.84, I2 = 58%, very 
low quality]. The RCT estimate of effect was similar (mean length of follow-up 
8.8 years, RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.11-0.96, I2 = 66%, very low quality). No difference 
was observed in mortality <30 days after surgery. All-site reintervention was 
similar between groups in cohorts and significantly reduced by the Ross 
procedure in RCTs (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.89-2.24, I2 = 55%, very low quality and RR 
0.41, 95% CI 0.22-0.78, I2 = 68%, high quality, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Observational data, with residual confounding, and RCT data suggest 
a late survival benefit with the Ross procedure with no increased risk of 
reintervention when compared to conventional AVR. Considering the quality of 
available evidence and limited follow-up, additional high-quality randomized 
studies are required to strengthen these findings.

OBJECTIVES: Cardiac surgery has little effect on life expectancy in elderly 
patients. Thus, improving the quality of life should be the main factor 
affecting therapeutic decisions. Most studies on quality of life in elderly 
patients undergoing cardiac surgery report improvement but have limitations. 
Consequently, we assessed improvements in the quality of life of elderly 
patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, identified influencing variables 
and established patterns of mental and physical health variations in the first 
year postoperatively.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of patients aged 65 or older who 
underwent elective cardiac surgery between September 2011 and August 2013. The 
36-item Short Form (SF-36) surveys were obtained preoperatively and at 3, 6 and 
12 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: The 430 preoperative patients with a mean age of 74 years (SD 
5.5 years) comprised 220 men. Most physical health improvements occurred within 
3 months and continued to improve significantly until 12 months. Predictive 
variables for patients showing less improvement were poor preoperative physical 
health, female sex, older age and longer length of hospital stay. Mental health 
improved significantly through the third postoperative month. The negative 
predictive variables were poor preoperative mental health and longer intensive 
care unit stay.
CONCLUSIONS: Most patients improved both physically and mentally after surgery, 
and most of the improvement occurred within 3 months post-surgery. These 
improvement patterns should be taken into account when creating rehabilitation 
programmes, and patients should be counselled on what improvements can be 
expected during the first 12 months after surgery.

Immunotherapy is used to upregulate or downregulate the immune system to achieve 
a therapeutic effect in immunological mediated disorders, including 
immunodeficiencies, hypersensitivity reactions, autoimmune diseases, tissue and 
organ transplantations, malignancies, inflammatory disorders, infectious 
diseases, and any other disease, where immunotherapy can improve the quality and 
life expectancy. This activity will highlight the various types of 
immunotherapy, including mechanisms of action, adverse event profiles, and other 
key factors, e.g., dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, 
relevant interactions pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the 
management of patients with conditions that can benefit from receiving 
immunotherapy.

STUDY DESIGN: A propensity score matching study.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of balloon 
kyphoplasty (BKP) in Japan.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF) is a common 
disease in elderly people. In Japan, the incidence of painful OVF in 2008 was 
estimated as 880,000, and approximately 40% of patients with painful OVF are 
hospitalized due to the severity of pain. Japan is the front runner among 
super-aged societies and rising health care costs are an economic problem.
METHODS: BKP and nonsurgical management (NSM) for acute/subacute OVF were 
performed in 116 and 420 cases, respectively. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
and incremental costs were calculated on the basis of a propensity score 
matching study. QALY was evaluated using the SF-6D questionnaire. Finally, using 
a Markov model, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated 
for 71 matched cases.
RESULTS: In the comparison between BKP and NSM, mean patients age was 78.3 and 
77.7 years, respectively (P = 0.456). The BKP procedure cost 402,988 JPY more 
than NSM and the gains in QALY at the 6-month follow-up were 0.153 and 0.120, 
respectively (difference = 0.033). ICERs for 3 and 20 years were 4,404,158 JPY 
and 2,416,406 JPY, respectively. According to sensitivity analysis, ICERs ranged 
from 652,181 JPY to 4,896,645 JPY (4418-33,168 GBP).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that BKP is a cost-effective treatment 
option for OVF in Japan. However, the effect might be blunted in patients aged > 
80 years. Further research is necessary to elucidate the cost-effectiveness of 
BKP in this population.

It may be beneficial, although risky, to decide to trust others during social 
interactions in daily life. The current study explored the time course of the 
effect of trust decisions on outcome evaluation processing using 
electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques. Twenty-two healthy young adults made 
trust or distrust decisions regarding a message they received from a stranger in 
a card game. The results showed that at the early stage of outcome processing, 
feedback-related negativity (FRN) was more negative for losses than for gains, 
and more importantly, this valence effect of FRN was greater for outcomes 
following trust decisions than distrust decisions. At the later stage, the P3 
was larger for gains than for losses and for outcomes following trust decisions 
than distrust decisions. In addition, at both the early and late stages, 
differences in the mid-frontal theta power between losses and gains were also 
greater in the trust condition than in the distrust condition. These findings 
indicate that trust decisions could effectively modulate the processing of 
outcome evaluation at different stages. The trust effect at the early stage of 
outcome processing suggests that compared to distrust decisions, trust decisions 
result in greater motivation and expectancy to obtain positive outcomes. While 
the trust effect on the later stage of outcome processing suggests that 
individuals pay more attention and feel stronger emotional experience to the 
outcomes following trust decisions. This study sheds light on the neural 
mechanisms of trust decisions modulating outcome processing.

INTRODUCTION:  About 40 % of the patients are active smokers when diagnosed lung 
cancer. Half of these patients is the nicotine consumption continues despite the 
existence of cancer. The overall mortality in these patients is a factor of 3 
higher. In addition, the quality of life increases and symptoms such as cough 
and dyspnoea are reduced.
QUESTION:  How do the treating physicians deal with the tobacco consumption of 
their patients with lung carcinoma?
METHODS:  A total of 14 physicians from the Bonn University Hospital were 
interviewed from the departments of pneumology, oncology and thoracic surgery 
involved in the treatment of the lung carcinoma. The interviews were transcribed 
and analysed according to the qualitative content analysis Mayring with MAXQDA® 
12.
RESULTS:  The doctors handled the nicotine consumption of their patients very 
individually. In doing so, the doctors were primarily oriented on the possible 
life expectancy of the patients. In a curative treatment approach, the doctors 
presumed a smoking stop in their patients for successful treatment. In the 
context of a palliative treatment, many doctors no longer wanted the burden of 
smoking cessation to their patients. Came the desire for a cessation therapy in 
patients were referred generally to colleagues who were trained in smoking 
cessation. Obstacles to the independent execution of a smoking cessation were in 
particular lack of knowledge and short treatment times or high number of 
patients, especially during the consultation hours.
DISCUSSION:  The doctors were quite convinced of the benefit of a smoking stop 
in the treatment of the lung carcinoma. Lung cancer patients would benefit if 
smoking cessation would be even more integrated into the overall therapy. For 
that one could rely on already established cessation programs and concepts for 
clinics.

Publisher: EINLEITUNG:  Etwa 40 % der Patienten sind bei der Diagnosestellung 
Lungenkrebs aktive Raucher. Die Hälfte dieser Patienten setzt den Nikotinkonsum 
trotz bestehender Krebserkrankung fort. Die Gesamtsterblichkeit liegt bei diesen 
Patienten um den Faktor 3 höher. Zudem steigt die Lebensqualität und Symptome 
wie Husten und Luftnot werden reduziert.
FRAGESTELLUNG:  Wie gehen die behandelnden Ärzte mit dem Tabakkonsum ihrer 
Patienten mit Lungenkrebs um?
METHODEN:  Es wurden insgesamt 14 Ärzte des Universitätsklinikums Bonn aus den 
Abteilungen Pneumologie, Onkologie und Thoraxchirurgie befragt, die in die 
Behandlung des Lungenkrebses eingebunden sind. Die Interviews wurden 
transkribiert und nach der qualitativen Inhaltsanalyse nach Mayring mit 
MAXQDA®12 ausgewertet.
ERGEBNISSE:  Die Ärzte gingen sehr individuell mit dem Nikotinkonsum ihrer 
Patienten um. Dabei orientierten sich die Ärzte vorwiegend an der möglichen 
Lebenserwartung der Patienten. Bei einem kurativen Behandlungsansatz setzten die 
Ärzte einen Rauchstopp bei ihren Patienten für eine erfolgreiche Behandlung 
voraus. Im Rahmen einer palliativen Behandlung wollten viele Ärzte ihren 
Patienten die Belastung einer Raucherentwöhnung nicht mehr zumuten. Kam der 
Wunsch nach einer Entwöhnungstherapie beim Patienten auf, wurde in der Regel auf 
Kollegen verwiesen, die in Raucherentwöhnung geschult waren. Hindernisse für die 
selbstständige Durchführung einer Raucherentwöhnung waren insbesondere fehlende 
Kenntnisse und kurze Behandlungszeiten bzw. eine hohe Anzahl an Patienten, vor 
allem während der Sprechstunde.
DISKUSSION:  Die Ärzte waren durchaus vom Nutzen eines Rauchstopps bei der 
Behandlung des Lungenkarzinoms überzeugt. Patienten mit Lungenkrebs würden davon 
profitieren, wenn die Raucherentwöhnung noch mehr in die Gesamttherapie 
integriert wäre. Dazu könnte man auf bereits etablierte Entwöhnungsprogramme und 
Konzepte für Kliniken zurückgreifen.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The epidemiological characteristics of patients 
with head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have changed over 
recent years. The increase in life expectancy of the population, changed 
patterns of tobacco and alcohol use, and human papillomavirus infection (HPV) 
have brought about significant changes. The objective of the present study is to 
analyze the changes in the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of these 
patients over a 30-year period.
METHODS: Retrospective study of 5,123 patients with HNSCC treated over the 
period 1985-2017. We evaluated the existence of changes in the patterns of age, 
sex, tobacco and alcohol use, and location and extension of the tumours 
throughout the study period. HPV status was evaluated for patients with 
oropharyngeal carcinomas.
RESULTS: Throughout the study period there was a significant increase in the 
mean age at presentation and in the percentage of women, and a decrease in the 
percentage of patients with history of high consumption of toxic substances. We 
observed a decrease in the proportion of patients with laryngeal cancer, and an 
increase of patients with early tumours cT1 and with neck disease cN2. We 
detected a progressive increase in the proportion of HPV-positive oropharyngeal 
carcinoma patients.
CONCLUSION: Over recent decades there have been significant changes in the 
epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with HNSCC.

BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a growing problem worldwide, markedly in low- and 
middle-income countries, where the rate of control slightly decreased. The 
overall prevalence of hypertension in Brazil is 28.7% among adult individuals 
and 68.9% in the population aged 60 years and older, and less than a third of 
patients have controlled blood pressure (BP). The use of technologies-mobile 
phones and the internet-to implement interventions to reduce blood pressure can 
minimize costs and diminish cardiovascular risk. Interventions through text 
messaging and electronic BP monitoring present divergent results.
OBJECTIVE: This trial evaluates the effectiveness of interventions-personalized 
messages and telemonitoring of BP-to reduce systolic BP and improve lifestyle 
compared to the usual care of patients with hypertension (control group).
METHODS: This factorial randomized controlled trial enrolls individuals aged 30 
to 75 years who have a mobile phone and internet access with the diagnosis of 
hypertension under drug treatment with up to 2 medications and uncontrolled BP. 
Eligible participants should have both increased office BP and 24-hour BP with 
ambulatory BP monitoring. Participants with severe hypertension (systolic BP 
≥180 or diastolic BP ≥110 mm Hg), life threatening conditions, low life 
expectancy, recent major cardiovascular event (last 6 months), other indications 
for the use of antihypertensive medication, diagnosis of secondary hypertension, 
pregnant or lactating women, or those unable to understand the interventions are 
excluded. Participants are randomly allocate to 1 of 4 experimental arms: (1) 
Telemonitoring of blood pressure (TELEM) group: receives an automatic 
oscillometric device to measure BP, (2) telemonitoring by text message (TELEMEV) 
group: receives personalized, standardized text messages to stimulate lifestyle 
changes and adhere with BP-lowering medication, (3) TELEM-TELEMEV group: 
receives both interventions, and (4) control group: receives usual clinical 
treatment (UCT). Data collection is performed in a clinical research center 
located in a referent hospital. The primary outcomes are reduction of systolic 
BP assessed by 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (primary outcome) and change of 
lifestyle (based on dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH)-type diet, 
sodium restriction, weight loss or control, increase of physical activity).
RESULTS: This study was funded by two Brazilian agencies: the National Council 
for Scientific and Technological Development and Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa 
do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul. Enrollment was completed at the end of 2017 
(N=231), the follow-up is ongoing, and data analysis is expected to begin in 
early 2019. A reduction of 24-hour systolic BP of approximately 8.8 [SD 13.1] mm 
Hg for participants in the BP monitoring group versus 3.4 [SD 11.6] mm Hg in the 
UCT group is expected. A similar reduction in the text messaging group is 
expected.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of mobile technologies connected to the internet through 
mobile phones promotes time optimization, cost reduction, and better use of 
public health resources. However, it has not been established whether simple 
interventions such as text messaging are superior to electronic BP monitoring 
and whether both outperform conventional counseling.

Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) is a rare 
congenital cardiac defect with atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial 
discordance which leads to heart failure and limits patients' lifespan. We 
report the case of a 70-year-old lady, from a poor province in Pakistan, who 
presented for the first time with palpitations and was diagnosed to have CCTGA. 
She had moderate pulmonic valve stenosis which was protective against heart 
failure. She had six children all born via spontaneous vertex delivery in her 
local village. This case exemplifies the fact that pulmonic stenosis is 
favourable for patients with CCTGA. In a country where the average life 
expectancy of females is only 68 years, the survival of our patient with CCTGA 
beyond the average lifespan is indeed interesting.

[Anti-Aging Approach for Ocular Disorders: from Dry Eye to Retinitis Pigmentosa 
and Myopia].

[Article in Japanese]

Tsubota K.

More than 90% of ocular diseases, such as glaucoma, age-related macular 
degeneration, and dry eye, are age-related with the incidence increasing with 
age. Furthermore, although retinitis pigmentosa and myopia may be associated 
with hereditary factors, they are also considered age-related diseases since 
they progress with aging. Thus, instead of targeting individual diseases, a new 
approach aimed at targeting aging itself is being examined. The most established 
current anti-aging approach is calorie restriction, considered to induce various 
gene expressions such as anti-oxidative enzymes contributing to life extension. 
At first, we confirmed that conditions under increased oxidative stresses, 
including genetically modified animals, such as Sod-1 knockout mice (KO), Mev1 
transgenic mice, and Nrf-2 KO mice, and smoking induces a decrease in tear 
secretion resulting in dry eye. Recently, we found that dietary supplements 
containing lactoferrin or lactic acid bacteria suppress oxidative stress in the 
lacrimal glands, these results need to be considered in association with the 
current advances in the microbiome research. It is now possible to promote the 
clinical use of those supplements to increase tear secretion. Calorie 
restriction (CR) activates longevity gene sirtuins. We also have shown that 
agents activating sirtuins, such as resveratrol or nicotinamide mononucleotide 
(NMN) have retinal protective effects. Particularly, NMN is promising since we 
have confirmed its therapeutic effect against retinitis pigmentosa. Ketone 
bodies are considered another mechanistic target of CR. We developed eye drops 
containing ketone bodies, and confirmed a therapeutic effect similar to that of 
CR. Now we are expanding our investigations to include new therapies for dry eye 
and neuroprotection for the retina and the optic nerve. Other pathways such as 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), 
and inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) are also considered to be 
targets for the anti-aging approach. Taken together, the new strategy 
"anti-aging" is one approach in dealing with ocular diseases. The anti-aging 
approach is promising as the next generation of preventive medicine focusing on 
aging for the current era with increased health care expenditures.

INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic advances over the past 30 years have led to longer 
life expectancy and improved quality of life (QOL) for persons with hemophilia. 
Access to innovative therapy may be compromised if treatment decisions are 
driven solely by cost. New strategies are needed to assess true therapeutic 
values, along with financial cost, as physicians, policymakers, payers and 
manufacturers work together to improve patient care.
AIM: To provide an evidence-based assessment of the value of prophylaxis vs 
on-demand therapy for hemophilia, based on a widely recognized three-tiered 
value framework approach for assessing a range of therapeutic interventions.
METHODS: Data from six randomized clinical trials (ESPRIT, Joint Outcomes Study, 
SPINART, LEOPOLD II, ADVATE and POTTER) and four observational studies comparing 
primary and secondary prophylaxis vs on-demand therapy were applied to a 
hemophilia value framework.
RESULTS: Both primary and secondary prophylaxis showed advantages in Tier 1 
"Degree of health/recovery" outcomes, including measures of bleeding, 
musculoskeletal complications, pain, function/activity and QOL. Tier 2 "Process 
of Recovery" outcomes, also favoured prophylaxis, including measures of recovery 
time, return to normal activities, orthopaedic intervention and venous access. 
In Tier 3 "Sustainability of Health Recovery," measures of breakthrough bleeds, 
joint preservation, sustained productivity and QOL showed significant 
improvement with prophylaxis.
CONCLUSION: The hemophilia value framework affirmed value of primary and 
secondary prophylaxis vs on-demand therapy, with clinical benefit demonstrated 
in all three tiers. This analysis also demonstrates clinical utility of the 
value framework process in the determination of optimal and cost-effective 
hemophilia care for all stakeholders.
