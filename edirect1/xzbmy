OBJECTIVE: To estimate the health and economic burdens of child maltreatment in 
China.
METHODS: We did a systematic review for studies on child maltreatment in China 
using PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL-EBSCO, ERIC and the Chinese National 
Knowledge Infrastructure databases. We did meta-analyses of studies that met 
inclusion criteria to estimate the prevalence of child neglect and child 
physical, emotional and sexual abuse. We used data from the 2010 global burden 
of disease estimates to calculate disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost as 
a result of child maltreatment.
FINDINGS: From 68 studies we estimated that 26.6% of children under 18 years of 
age have suffered physical abuse, 19.6% emotional abuse, 8.7% sexual abuse and 
26.0% neglect. We estimate that emotional abuse in childhood accounts for 26.3% 
of the DALYs lost because of mental disorders and 18.0% of those lost because of 
self-harm. Physical abuse in childhood accounts for 12.2% of DALYs lost because 
of depression, 17.0% of those lost to anxiety, 20.7% of those lost to problem 
drinking, 18.8% of those lost to illicit drug use and 18.3% of those lost to 
self-harm. The consequences of physical abuse of children costs China an 
estimated 0.84% of its gross domestic product - i.e. 50 billion United States 
dollars - in 2010. The corresponding losses attributable to emotional and sexual 
abuse in childhood were 0.47% and 0.39% of the gross domestic product, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: In China, child maltreatment is common and associated with large 
economic losses because many maltreated children suffer substantial 
psychological distress and might adopt behaviours that increase their risk of 
chronic disease.

maltraitance des enfants en Chine.
MÉTHODES: Nous avons réalisé une revue systématique des études sur la 
maltraitance des enfants en Chine en utilisant les bases de données PubMed, 
Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL-EBSCO, ERIC et de l'Infrastructure nationale de 
connaissances chinoises. Nous avons effectué les méta-analyses des études qui 
satisfaisaient les critères d'inclusion, afin d'estimer la prévalence de 
l'abandon moral des enfants et des abus physiques, psychologiques et sexuels des 
enfants. Nous avons utilisé les données des estimations 2010 de la charge 
mondiale de morbidité pour calculer l'espérance de vie corrigée de l'incapacité 
(EVCI) perdue du fait de la maltraitance des enfants.
RÉSULTATS: À partir de 68 études, nous avons estimé que 26,6% des enfants de 
moins de 18 ans ont souffert d'abus physiques, 19,6% d'abus psychologiques, 8,7% 
d'abus sexuels et 26,0% d'abandon moral. Nous estimons que les abus 
psychologiques représentent 26,3% de l'EVCI perdue à cause des troubles mentaux 
et 18,0% de l'EVCI perdue à cause des comportements autodestructeurs. Les abus 
physiques pendant l'enfance représentent 12,2% de l'EVCI perdue à cause de la 
dépression, 17,0% à cause de l'anxiété, 20,7% à cause des problèmes de 
surconsommation d'alcool, 18,8% à cause de l'usage des drogues illicites et 
18,3% à cause des comportements autodestructeurs. Nous estimons que les 
conséquences des abus physiques sur les enfants ont coûté à la chine 0,84% de 
son produit intérieur brut, soit 50 milliards de dollars en 2010. Les pertes 
correspondantes attribuables aux abus psychologiques et sexuels pendant 
l'enfance s'élevaient à 0,47% et 0,39% du produit intérieur brut, 
respectivement.
CONCLUSION: En Chine, la maltraitance des enfants est courante et associée à des 
pertes économiques considérables, car de nombreux enfants maltraités souffrent 
de détresse psychologique profonde et qu'ils peuvent adopter des comportements 
augmentant leur risque de maladie chronique.

infantil en China.
MÉTODOS: Se realizó una revisión sistemática de los estudios sobre el maltrato 
infantil en China utilizando las bases de datos PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, 
CINAHL-EBSCO, ERIC y Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure. También se 
efectuó un metaanálisis de los estudios que cumplieron los criterios de 
inclusión para estimar la prevalencia del abandono infantil y del abuso infantil 
físico, emocional y sexual. Se emplearon datos de las estimaciones de la carga 
mundial de morbilidad del año 2010 para calcular los años de vida ajustados por 
discapacidad (AVAD) perdidos como consecuencia del maltrato infantil.
RESULTADOS: A partir de 68 estudios se estimó que el 26,6 % de los niños menores 
de 18 años de edad han sufrido abuso físico, el 19,6 % abuso emocional, el 8,7 % 
abuso sexual y el 26,0 % abandono. Asimismo, se estimó que el abuso emocional en 
la infancia representa el 26,3 % de los AVAD perdidos a causa de trastornos 
mentales y el 18,0 % de los perdidos por autolesión. El abuso físico en la 
infancia representa el 12,2 % de los AVAD perdidos a causa de la depresión, el 
17,0 % por ansiedad, el 20,7 % por problemas con el alcohol, el 18,8 % por uso 
de drogas ilícitas y el 18,3 % por autolesión. Las consecuencias del abuso 
físico de niños le cuestan a China aproximadamente el 0,84 % de su producto 
interior bruto, es decir, 50 mil millones de dólares de los Estados Unidos, en 
2010. Las pérdidas correspondientes atribuibles al abuso emocional y sexual en 
la infancia representaron el 0,47 % y el 0,39 % del producto interior bruto, 
respectivamente.
CONCLUSIÓN: En China, el maltrato infantil es común y está asociado con grandes 
pérdidas económicas, ya que muchos niños maltratados sufren trastornos 
psicológicos importantes y podrían adoptar conductas que aumentan su riesgo de 
sufrir enfermedades crónicas.

我们使用PubMed、Embase、PsycInfo、CINAHL-EBSCO、ERIC和中国国家知识基础设施数据库（中国知网）对中国儿童虐待研究做了系统回顾。我们对符合纳入标准的研究进行荟萃分析，估计儿童忽视和儿童身体、情感以及性虐待流行率。我们使用2010年全球疾病负担估计的数据计算因儿童虐待导致的伤残调整寿命（DALY）损失。.
结果: 
在我们估计的68份研究中，18岁以下儿童有26.6%遭受身体虐待、19.6%遭受情感虐待、8.7%遭受性虐待、26.0%遭受忽视。据我们估计，童年时期遭受情感虐待分别是26.3%因精神疾病和18.0%因自残导致的DALY损失的根源。而童年时期遭受身体虐待分别是12.2%因抑郁、17.0%因焦虑、20.7%因酗酒、18.8%因使用毒品以及18.3%因自残导致的DALY损失的根源。2010年儿童身体虐待后果令中国国内生产总值（GDP）损失0.84%（即500亿美元）。因童年情感和性虐待造成的损失分别是国内生产总值的0.47%和0.39%。.
结论: 中国的儿童虐待情况很常见，并伴有巨大的经济损失，这种损失是因为许多受虐儿童遭受巨大的心理压力，可能做出增加慢性病风险的行为。.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ: Оценить влияние бремени жестокого обращения с детьми в Китае на 
состояние здоровья и экономику.
МЕТОДЫ: С помощью сведений, полученных из баз данных PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, 
CINAHL-EBSCO, ERIC и Китайской национальной инфраструктуры знаний (CNKI), был 
проведен систематический обзор исследований, посвященных жестокому обращению с 
детьми в Китае. Для оценки распространения безнадзорности детей, физического, 
морального и сексуального насилия над детьми был проведен мета-анализ 
исследований, отвечающих критериям включения в данный обзор. Для расчета 
количества лет жизни с поправкой на инвалидность (DALY), потерянных в результате 
жестокого обращения с детьми, были использованы данные оценок глобального 
бремени болезней за 2010 г..
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: По данным 68 исследований было установлено, что 26,6% детей в 
возрасте до 18 лет пострадали от физического насилия, 19,6% – от эмоционального 
насилия, 8,7% – от сексуального насилия и 26,0% – от безнадзорности. Было 
установлено, что на эмоциональное насилие в детстве приходится 26,3% DALY, 
потерянных в результате психических расстройств и 18,0% DALY, потерянных в 
результате нанесения себе увечий. На физическое насилие в детстве приходится 
12,2% DALY, потерянных в результате депрессии, 17,0% – из-за страха, 20,7% – 
из-за пьянства на почве желания уйти от ситуационного стресса, 18,8% – из-за 
использования запрещенных наркотиков и 18,3% – из-за нанесения себе увечий. 
Последствия физического насилия над детьми обошлись Китаю предположительно в 
0,84% от валового внутреннего продукта, т. е. составили 50 миллиардов долларов 
США в 2010 году. Убытки, связанные с эмоциональным и сексуальным насилием в 
детстве, составляли 0,47% и 0,39% от валового внутреннего продукта 
соответственно.
ВЫВОД: Жестокое обращение с детьми в Китае является распространенным явлением, 
которое приводит к значительным экономическим убыткам, поскольку многие дети, 
подвергающиеся жестокому обращению, страдают устойчивыми психологическими 
расстройствами и могут демонстрировать формы поведения, которые повышают риск 
возникновения хронических заболеваний.

The incidence of fractures of the atrophic edentulous mandible is still low, 
even with the increasing life expectancy. The reduced blood supply of the 
sclerotic bone, the diminished contact area between bone fragments and the 
patient's systemic condition makes the treatment of those fractures a challenge 
for any professional. Treatment of atrophic mandibular fractures by means of 
miniplate osteosynthesis has not been the preferred method of fixation by many 
authors. Yet, many surgeons have applied this type of fixation for the atrophied 
jaw sections. This paper reports 2 cases of fractured atrophic mandibles treated 
with the pencilboneplate, a monocortical 2.0 mm titanium, 8 or 10-hole hardware 
with reinforcement on its middle portion, highlighting important considerations 
of its use. The pencilboneplate appears to be a valuable option for the 
treatment of atrophic mandibular fractures, especially by an intra-oral 
approach, and warrants further biomechanical and clinical studies.

Lithocholic bile acid accumulated in yeast mitochondria orchestrates a 
development of an anti-aging cellular pattern by causing age-related changes in

Comment in
    Cell Cycle. 2015;14(12):1770.

We have previously revealed that exogenously added lithocholic bile acid (LCA) 
extends the chronological lifespan of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
accumulates in mitochondria and alters mitochondrial membrane lipidome. Here, we 
use quantitative mass spectrometry to show that LCA alters the age-related 
dynamics of changes in levels of many mitochondrial proteins, as well as 
numerous proteins in cellular locations outside of mitochondria. These proteins 
belong to 2 regulons, each modulated by a different mitochondrial dysfunction; 
we call them a partial mitochondrial dysfunction regulon and an oxidative stress 
regulon. We found that proteins constituting these regulons (1) can be divided 
into several "clusters", each of which denotes a distinct type of partial 
mitochondrial dysfunction that elicits a different signaling pathway mediated by 
a discrete set of transcription factors; (2) exhibit 3 different patterns of the 
age-related dynamics of changes in their cellular levels; and (3) are encoded by 
genes whose expression is regulated by the transcription factors 
Rtg1p/Rtg2p/Rtg3p, Sfp1p, Aft1p, Yap1p, Msn2p/Msn4p, Skn7p and Hog1p, each of 
which is essential for longevity extension by LCA. Our findings suggest that 
LCA-driven changes in mitochondrial lipidome alter mitochondrial proteome and 
functionality, thereby enabling mitochondria to operate as signaling organelles 
that orchestrate an establishment of an anti-aging transcriptional program for 
many longevity-defining nuclear genes. Based on these findings, we propose a 
model for how such LCA-driven changes early and late in life of chronologically 
aging yeast cause a stepwise development of an anti-aging cellular pattern and 
its maintenance throughout lifespan.

OBJECT: With the increase in the average life expectancy, medical care of 
elderly patients with symptomatic pituitary adenoma (PA) will continue to grow. 
Little information exists in the literature about the surgical treatment of 
these patients. The aim of this study was to present the results of a single 
pituitary center in the surgical treatment of PAs in patients > 70 years of age.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, 55 consecutive elderly patients (age ≥ 70 
years) with nonfunctioning PAs underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery at 
the General Hospital of Fortaleza, Brazil, between May 2000 and December 2012. 
The clinical and radiological results in this group were compared with 2 groups 
of younger patients: < 60 years (n = 289) and 60-69 years old (n = 30).
RESULTS: Fifty-five patients ≥ 70 years of age (average age 72.5 years, range 
70-84 years) underwent endoscopic surgery for treatment of PAs. The mean 
follow-up period was 50 months (range 12-144 months). The most common symptoms 
were visual impairment in 38 (69%) patients, headache in 16 (29%) patients, and 
complete ophthalmoplegia in 6 (10.9%). Elderly patients presented a higher 
incidence of ophthalmoplegia (p = 0.032) and a lower frequency of pituitary 
apoplexy before surgery (p < 0.05). Tumors with cavernous sinus invasion were 
treated surgically less frequently than in younger patients. Although patients 
with an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3 were more common in the 
elderly group (p < 0.05), no significant difference regarding surgical time, 
extent of resection, and hospitalization were observed. Elderly patients 
presented with more complications than patients < 60 years (32.7% vs 10%, p < 
0.05). Complications observed in the elderly group included 5 CSF leaks (9%), 2 
permanent diabetes insipidus cases (3.6%), 4 postoperative refractory 
hypertension cases (7.2%), 1 myocardial ischemia (1.8%), and 1 death (1.8%). 
Postoperative new anterior pituitary deficit was more common in the younger 
group (< 60 years old: 17.7%) than in the elderly (≥ 70 years old: 12.7%); 
however, there was no statistical difference.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery for elderly patients with PAs 
may be associated with higher complication rates, especially secondary to early 
transitory complications, when compared with surgery performed in younger 
patients. Although the worst preoperative clinical status might be observed in 
this group, age alone is not associated with a worst final prognosis after 
endoscopic removal of nonfunctioning PAs.

Quality and length of life, money and urethral stricture disease.

Jackson MJ(1), Ivaz SL.

Author information:
(1)aInstitute of Cellular Medicine, William Leech Building, Newcastle Upon Tyne 
bInstitute of Urology, University College London Hospital, London, UK.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article walks through some of the ideas behind 
patient-reported outcome measurement and quality of life research against the 
backdrop of urethral stricture disease and conditions of the lower urinary tract 
more generally, why measurement matters at all, future areas for research and 
development and potential opportunities for misuse and manipulation.
RECENT FINDINGS: It is the authors' opinion that only one published study has 
substantially advanced our understanding of the way men with urethral stricture 
disease manage this condition in the real world, and, in turn, the outcomes 
those men seek when they consent to surgery and its associated risks. There is, 
however, almost certainly greater acceptance now by reconstructive urologists of 
the utility of patient-reported outcome measures in audit; surgical performance 
evaluation; clinical research; and fair, logical and transparent healthcare 
resource allocation at a population level. This is evidenced by the recent 
proliferation of studies incorporating patient-reported outcomes, which appear 
today to be on parity at least with those that surgeons historically gave 
priority to.
SUMMARY: The next frontier in urethral stricture disease outcomes research is a 
better understanding of the impact of this condition on men's daily lives. That 
level of insight is likely to be gained through a mixture of qualitative and 
quantitative research methods applied to collaborative research ventures with 
men with the condition who, as those that have the most to gain and lose, must 
be majority stakeholders in this process.

Tuberculosis DALY-Gap: Spatial and Quantitative Comparison of Disease Burden 
Across Urban Slum and Non-slum Census Tracts.

To quantitatively assess disease burden due to tuberculosis between populations 
residing in and outside of urban informal settlements in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 
we compared disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), or "DALY-gap." Using the 
2010 Brazilian census definition of informal settlements as aglomerados 
subnormais (AGSN), we allocated tuberculosis (TB) DALYs to AGSN vs non-AGSN 
census tracts based on geocoded addresses of TB cases reported to the Brazilian 
Information System for Notifiable Diseases in 2005 and 2010. DALYs were 
calculated based on the 2010 Global Burden of Disease methodology. DALY-gap was 
calculated as the difference between age-adjusted DALYs/100,000 population 
between AGSN and non-AGSN. Total TB DALY in Rio in 2010 was 16,731 (266 
DALYs/100,000). DALYs were higher in AGSN census tracts (306 vs 236 
DALYs/100,000), yielding a DALY-gap of 70 DALYs/100,000. Attributable DALY 
fraction for living in an AGSN was 25.4%. DALY-gap was highest for males 40-59 
years of age (501 DALYs/100,000) and in census tracts with <60% electricity 
(12,327 DALYs/100,000). DALY-gap comparison revealed spatial and quantitative 
differences in TB burden between slum vs non-slum census tracts that were not 
apparent using traditional measures of incidence and mortality. This metric 
could be applied to compare TB burden or burden for other diseases in 
mega-cities with large informal settlements for more targeted resource 
allocation and evaluation of intervention programs.

JR)

BACKGROUND: Cost-utility analyses commonly employ a multiattribute utility (MAU) 
instrument to estimate the health state utilities, which are needed to calculate 
quality-adjusted life years. Different MAU instruments predict significantly 
different utilities, which makes comparison of results from different evaluation 
studies problematical.
AIM: This article presents mapping functions ("crosswalks") from 6 MAU 
instruments (EQ-5D-5L, SF-6D, Health Utilities Index 3 [HUI 3], 15D, Quality of 
Well-Being [QWB], and Assessment of Quality of Life 8D [AQoL-8D]) to each of the 
other 5 instruments in the study: a total of 30 mapping functions.
METHODS: Data were obtained from a multi-instrument comparison survey of the 
public and patients in 7 disease areas conducted in 6 countries (Australia, 
Canada, Germany, Norway, United Kingdom, and United States). The 8022 
respondents were administered each of the 6 study instruments. Mapping equations 
between each instrument pair were estimated using 4 econometric techniques: 
ordinary least squares, generalized linear model, censored least absolute 
deviations, and, for the first time, a robust MM-estimator.
RESULTS: Goodness-of-fit indicators for each of the results are within the range 
of published studies. Transformations reduced discrepancies between predicted 
utilities. Incremental utilities, which determine the value of quality-related 
health benefits, are almost perfectly aligned at the sample means.
CONCLUSION: Transformations presented here align the measurement scales of MAU 
instruments. Their use will increase confidence in the comparability of 
evaluation studies, which have employed different MAU instruments.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate maximal isometric muscle force at 18 years of age in 
relation to Parkinson disease (PD) later in life.
METHODS: The cohort consisted of 1,317,713 men who had their muscle strength 
measured during conscription (1969-1996). Associations between participants' 
muscle strength at conscription and PD diagnoses, also in their parents, were 
examined using multivariate statistical models.
RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders, the lowest compared to the highest 
fifth of handgrip strength (hazard ratio [HR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.06-1.79), elbow flexion strength (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.02-1.76), but not knee 
extension strength (HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.94-1.62) was associated with an increased 
risk of PD during follow-up. Furthermore, men whose parents were diagnosed with 
PD had reduced handgrip (fathers: mean difference [MD] -5.7 N [95% CI -7.3 to 
-4.0]; mothers: MD -5.0 N [95% CI -7.0 to -2.9]) and elbow flexion (fathers: MD 
-4.3 N [95% CI -5.7 to -2.9]; mothers: MD -3.9 N [95% CI -5.7 to -2.2]) 
strength, but not knee extension strength (fathers: MD -1.1 N [95% CI -2.9 to 
0.8]; mothers: MD -0.7 N [95% CI -3.1 to 1.6]), than those with no such familial 
history.
CONCLUSIONS: Maximal upper extremity voluntary muscle force was reduced in late 
adolescence in men diagnosed with PD 30 years later. The findings suggest the 
presence of subclinical motor deficits 3 decades before the clinical onset of 
PD.

Self-expandable metallic stent placement for palliation in gastric outlet 
obstruction.

Malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) often has a markedly adverse impact 
on the quality of life (QOL) of patients. Procedures in affected patients should 
aim to reduce obstructive symptoms and enable oral ingestion. Surgical 
gastrojejunostomy (GJJ) has been performed as a conventional palliative 
procedure. Enteral stenting has been increasingly used as an alternative to 
surgical palliation because of its lower invasiveness. Enteral stents used for 
GOO are made of a metal alloy mesh in a cylindrical shape, and are termed 
self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS). Of the two placement techniques, 
over-the-wire (OTW) and through-the-scope (TTS) deployment, TTS is easier and is 
now more frequently used. In general, the technical success rate is extremely 
high, at nearly 100%, and the clinical success rate is about 90%, but 
complications after placement can occur, most frequently late-developing stent 
dysfunction due to stent obstruction and migration. Biliary obstruction can 
occur concurrently with GOO, or before or after GOO, particularly in patients 
with pancreaticobiliary malignancies. Considering accessibility to the bile 
duct, biliary stenting should generally be conducted prior to enteral stenting. 
Transhepatic or transmural biliary stenting may be required if transpapillary 
stenting is not possible. Because enteral stenting is more commonly associated 
with late-developing stent dysfunction, it is better suited than GJJ for 
patients with a short life expectancy and poorer performance score. Chemotherapy 
may be beneficial in reducing the risk of stent obstruction, despite the 
possible risk of migration, particularly in patients with GOO due to gastric 
cancer. Many enteral stents with different structures are now commercially 
available, but the association between the design and mechanical properties of a 
stent and clinical outcomes is still poorly understood. Further, no consensus on 
the benefits of covered SEMS has yet been obtained. Further study to verify 
which types of SEMS are most suited for GOO is warranted.

Patients diagnosed with an advanced cancer frequently have a very limited life 
expectancy and need to understand their prognosis in order to make good choices 
about care. Advance care planning (ACP) is an important aspect of this care but 
can be especially difficult to address. Most patients and families prefer direct 
and honest communication, but they may interpret the information they are given 
in very different ways. In addition, oncologists strive to communicate honestly 
and sensitively, but often struggle with the best approach. Finally, 
standardization of ACP is challenging because patients have highly 
individualized values, traditions and social and family dynamics that guide 
their preferences. Palliative Care is a rapidly growing field that specializes 
in communication and patient-centered approaches to care. Treatment of patients 
with advanced or metastatic cancer should prioritize early discussions of ACP to 
ensure high quality end-of-life care. When available, this care should be 
delivered through careful integration with palliative care specialists.

Renal masses are increasingly detected in asymptomatic individuals as incidental 
findings. An indeterminate renal mass is one that cannot be diagnosed 
confidently as benign or malignant at the time it is discovered. CT, 
ultrasonography, and MRI of renal masses with fast-scan techniques and 
intravenous (IV) contrast are the mainstays of evaluation. Dual-energy CT, 
contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, PET/CT, and percutaneous biopsy are all 
technologies that are gaining traction in the characterization of the 
indeterminate renal mass. In cases in which IV contrast cannot be used, whether 
because of IV contrast allergy or renal insufficiency, renal mass classification 
with CT is markedly limited. In the absence of IV contrast, ultrasonography, 
MRI, and biopsy have some advantages. Owing to the low malignant and metastatic 
potential of small renal cell carcinomas (≤4 cm in diameter), active 
surveillance is additionally emerging as a diagnostic strategy for patients who 
have high surgical risk or limited life expectancy. The ACR Appropriateness 
Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are 
reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline 
development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical 
literature from peer-reviewed journals and application by the panel of a 
well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the 
appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures. In those instances in which 
evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend 
imaging or treatment.

AIM: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence, incidence rate, and lifetime 
risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF) in a population-based study of 
Swedish men.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study is a part of 'The Study of Men Born in 1913', 
which is a longitudinal prospective cohort study of 855 men born in 1913 and 
living in the city of Gothenburg in Sweden. They were followed from the age of 
50 years until 98 years with repeated examinations and data from the Swedish 
National Hospital Discharge Register. A total of 185 (21.6%) men developed AF. 
The prevalence of AF increased from 0.4% at 50 years old, to 1.9% by 60 years 
old, to 4.6% by 70 years old, to 12.5% by 80 years old, and to 15.7% by 90 years 
old. The lifetime risk of developing AF was 22.5%.
CONCLUSION: Atrial fibrillation is rare at the age of 50 in Swedish men, but it 
increases exponentially with age, markedly accelerating after 70 years old. In 
nonagenarians, one of five men has or has had AF.

[Diagnostic imaging and radiation hazards].

[Article in French]

Claudon M, Guillaume L.

For the last 20 years, the exposure of the population to medical radiation has 
been increased by 600%, mainly due to the extension of new imaging modalities 
such as CT or interventional radiology. The risk for radio-induced hazards is 
especially marked for children, because of the high sensivity of tissues to 
radiation especially during the first decade of the life. Two main ways allow to 
better control and reduce the mean effective dose per patient in diagnostic 
imaging: the introduction of recent technical improvement (i.e. low dose CT 
scans using iterative reconstruction algorithms, low dose technique for 
pediatric spine), and the substitution to non-radiating techniques such as 
ultrasound and MRI. The French National institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear 
Safety periodically publishes dose reference levels for conventional films and 
CT examinations, for both adults and pediatric patients. A close relationship 
between clinicians and radiologists remains essential for a better appreciation 
of the risk/benefit ratio of each individual examination using X-Rays.

[Risks related to radiation therapy].

[Article in French]

Bey P.

Radiotherapy is used for about 60% of cancer patients, in 2/3rd of the cases 
with a curative intent. If the frequent early secondary effects are transitory 
and with a limited impact, some late effects, even rare as cardiac troubles and 
secondary tumors, are now more important due to the increase of cure rate and 
due to the improvement of life expectancy of cured patients. Technologic 
improvements of the last decades reduced some of these risks, as the 
strengthening of human resources and the development of quality assurance 
procedures have contributed to reduce the risk of major accidents.

INTRODUCTION: Outcomes of Wilms tumor improved in last 50 years and excellent 
survival rates can be achieved especially in case of non-metastatic disease and 
favorable histology. Nevertheless, bilateral cases still stand as a therapeutic 
challenge. Prognosis of bilateral Wilms tumor (BWT) is not as good as the 
unilateral tumors of similar stage and histology in terms of survival and renal 
function.
OBJECTIVE: Management of BWT is constantly evolving and still stands as a 
therapeutic challenge. This study is designed to review and share our 
experiences on this topic from a surgical standpoint.
STUDY DESIGN: The records of patients treated in our clinic between 1980 and 
2013 according to Turkish Pediatric Group of Oncology protocol were analyzed 
retrospectively and clinical data, surgical details, pathology results, long 
term outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Thirteen girls and 7 boys with a mean age of 2,5 years were treated. 
There were 2 patients with Wilms tumor-Aniridia-Growth Retardation complex and 
one with isolated hemihypertrophy. Metastasis were detected in lungs of 4 
patients; liver of 2 and in the cranium of one. All patients except one with the 
presumptive diagnosis of unilateral Wilms tumor were given preoperative 
chemotherapy. To sum up; 19 nephroureterectomies, 8 partial nephrectomies and 13 
enucleations were performed to 36 kidneys without any major early or late 
postoperative complications. Pathologic results revealed positive surgical 
margins in 2 lesions with enucleation and in 2 with partial nephrectomies and 
anaplasia in 4 patients. Two patients were not operated due to parental 
disapproval. Two patients had the need of dialysis; one was anephric and the 
others' renal functions recovered over a year. Seven patients received 
radiotherapy for pulmonary metastasis, positive surgical margins or local 
recurrences. Overall, 13 patients survived and 7 died due to metastasis, 
recurrences, and complication of dialysis and refusal of surgical treatment. 
Survival among all patients was 65% and 72.2% among operated ones. Of the 7 
patients with the partial nephrectomy, 2 died and 5 survived. Among enucleation 
group, 8 out of 10 survived and 2 died. Survival was slightly higher among 
enucleation group (80% vs 71.4%). Median time of follow-up for survivors of 
disease is 5.8 years (min: 6 months and max: 14 years).
DISCUSSION: Outcomes of BWT management have changed dramatically during the last 
few decades from only survival, to a long life expectancy without the need of 
renal replacement therapy owing to improvements in treatment options. We argue 
that positive surgical margins do not necessarily lead to local recurrence. For 
this reason it may be wiser to favor on more nephron sparing surgery than to 
achieve negative surgical margins. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be 
adequate to prevent local recurrence. Also, survival did not differ 
significantly between different ways of nephron sparing surgeries, so it may be 
wiser to choose enucleation over partial nephrectomy which preserves more 
nephrons. Nephron-sparing surgery should have utmost importance despite the risk 
of positive margins. On the other hand, there is not enough data to interpret if 
positive surgical margins have role on distant metastases or not. Presence of 
metastasis and recurrence seems to be an important determinant of prognosis 
given the fact that none of the survivors had any metastasis or recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Nephron preservation should be the aim while taking positive 
surgical margin risk on nephron sparing surgery side relying on postoperative 
chemotherapy and carefully planned radiotherapy to avoid recurrence. However, 
there is significant diversity on the management BWT in different centers and a 
certain validated guideline or protocol to provide the optimal treatment is 
still lacking.

Neuronal migration and neurite growth are essential events in neural 
development, but it remains unclear how guidance cues are transduced through 
receptors to the actin cytoskeleton, which powers these processes. We report 
that a cytokinetic scaffold protein, Anillin, is redistributed to the leading 
edge of the C. elegans Q neuroblast during cell migration and neurite growth. To 
bypass the requirement for Anillin in cytokinesis, we used the somatic 
CRISPR-Cas9 technique to generate conditional mutations in Anillin. We 
demonstrate that Anillin regulates cell migration and growth cone extension by 
stabilizing the F-actin network at the leading edge. Our biochemical analysis 
shows that the actin-binding domain of Anillin is sufficient to stabilize 
F-actin by antagonizing the F-actin severing activity of Cofilin. We further 
uncover that the active form of RhoG/MIG-2 directly binds to Anillin and 
recruits it to the leading edge. Our results reveal a novel pathway in which 
Anillin transduces the RhoG signal to the actin cytoskeleton during neuronal 
migration and neurite growth.

Anatomy of a Municipal Triumph: New York City's Upsurge in Life Expectancy.

Preston SH(1), Elo IT(1).

Author information:
(1)Population Studies Center, University of Pennsylvania.

Over the period 1990-2010, the increase in life expectancy for males in New York 
City was 6.0 years greater than for males in the United States. The female 
relative gain was 3.9 years. Male relative gains were larger because of 
extremely rapid reductions in mortality from HIV/AIDS and homicide, declines 
that reflect effective municipal policies and programs. Declines in drug- and 
alcohol-related deaths also played a significant role in New York City's 
advance, but every major cause of death contributed to its relative improvement. 
By 2010, New York City had a life expectancy that was 1.9 years greater than 
that of the US. This difference is attributable to the high representation of 
immigrants in New York's population. Immigrants to New York City, and to the 
United States, have life expectancies that are among the highest in the world. 
The fact that 38 percent of New York's population consists of immigrants, 
compared to only 14 percent in the United States, accounts for New York's 
exceptional standing in life expectancy in 2010. In fact, US-born New Yorkers 
have a life expectancy below that of the United States itself.

Surrey, United Kingdom.

Study Design Case report. Objectives Decompression of metastatic spinal cord 
compression has been shown to improve quality of life and prolong ambulation in 
patients undergoing palliative treatment. We report a case of metastatic 
cervical myelopathy treated with a combined approach using corpectomy and 
stabilization together with balloon kyphoplasty to allow adequate decompression 
and immediate stability in a patient with significant destruction of adjacent 
vertebral bodies. Methods The cervical spine was approached anteriorly and 
decompressed with a C7 corpectomy. Subsequent stability was achieved with 
insertion of a trabecular metal cage. Balloon kyphoplasty was used to treat 
lytic lesions within the posterior body of the adjacent vertebrae for pain 
relief and increased stability. Additional stability was achieved through the 
application of an anterior plate. Results Full limited decompression and 
stabilization were successfully achieved. The patient had no further neurologic 
deterioration and made modest improvements that allowed a return to independent 
ambulation. Conclusion This limited approach may be an option for patients with 
metastatic spinal cord compression, lytic destruction of adjacent vertebral 
bodies, and limited life expectancy.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013;(1):CD004448.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease, a common recessively inherited haemoglobin 
disorder, affects people from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Mediterranean 
basin, Indian subcontinent, Caribbean and South America. It is associated with 
complications and a reduced life expectancy. Phytomedicines (medicine derived 
from plants in their original state) encompass many of the plant remedies from 
traditional healers which the populations most affected would encounter. There 
has been little systematic appraisal of their benefits. This is an update of a 
Cochrane Review first published in 2010 and updated in 2013.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and risks of phytomedicines in people with 
sickle cell disease of all types, of any age, in any setting.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders 
Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, the International Standard Randomised 
Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN) and the Allied and Complimentary 
Medicine Database (AMED).Dates of most recent searches: Haemoglobinopathies 
Trials Register: 13 October 2014;
ISRCTN: 17 January 2015; AMED: 20 January 2015.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials with participants of 
all ages with sickle cell disease, in all settings, comparing the administration 
of phytomedicines, by any mode to placebo or conventional treatment, including 
blood transfusion and hydroxyurea.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently assessed trial quality 
and extracted data.
MAIN RESULTS: Two trials (182 participants) and two phytomedicines Niprisan(®) 
(also known as Nicosan(®)) and Ciklavit(®) were included. The Phase IIB 
(pivotal) trial suggests that Niprisan(®) was effective in reducing episodes of 
severe painful sickle cell disease crisis over a six-month period. It did not 
affect the risk of severe complications or the level of anaemia. No serious 
adverse effects were reported. The single trial of Cajanus cajan (Ciklavit(®)) 
reported a possible benefit to individuals with painful crises, and a possible 
adverse effect (non-significant) on the level of anaemia.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: While Niprisan(®) appeared to be safe and effective in 
reducing severe painful crises over a six-month follow-up period, further trials 
are required to assess its role in the management of people with sickle cell 
disease and the results of its multicentre trials are awaited. Currently no 
conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy of Ciklavit(®). Based on the 
published results for Niprisan(®) and in view of the limitations in data 
collection and analysis of both trials, phytomedicines may have a potential 
beneficial effect in reducing painful crises in sickle cell disease. This needs 
to be further validated in future trials. More trials are required on the safety 
and efficacy of phytomedicines used in managing sickle cell disease.

OBJECTIVE: To create a decision analytic model to estimate the balance between 
treatment risks and benefits for severely obese patients with diabetes.
BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery leads to many desirable metabolic changes, but 
long-term impact of bariatric surgery on life expectancy in patients with 
diabetes has not yet been quantified.
METHODS: We developed a Markov state transition model with multiple Cox 
proportional hazards models and logistic regression models as inputs to compare 
bariatric surgery versus no surgical treatment for severely obese diabetic 
patients. The model is informed by data from 3 large cohorts: (1) 159,000 
severely obese diabetic patients (4185 had bariatric surgery) from 3 HMO 
Research Network sites; (2) 23,000 subjects from the Nationwide Inpatient 
Sample; and (3) 18,000 subjects from the National Health Interview Survey linked
