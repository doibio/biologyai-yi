This study reports the first analysis regarding cost-effectiveness of left 
ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation via thoracotomy. 
Cost-effectiveness of LVADs implanted via the traditional surgical approach of 
sternotomy has been improved through the years because of technological 
advances, along with understanding the importance of patient selection and 
postimplant management have on positively affecting outcomes. Given the positive 
clinical outcomes of the thoracotomy approach, we seek to study the 
cost-effectiveness of a centrifugal LVAD via this less invasive approach. We 
developed a Markov model. Survival and quality of life inputs (QALY) for the 
LVAD arm were based on data from the LATERAL clinical trial. For the Medical 
Management arm, survival was derived from the Seattle Heart Failure Model. The 
heart transplant probability was derived from INTERMACS. Survival after heart 
transplantation used International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation 
data. Cost inputs were calculated based on Medicare data and past literature. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was found to be $64,632 per quality 
adjusted life year and $57,891 per life year in the bridge to transplant 
indication. These results demonstrate further improvement in the overall 
cost-effectiveness of LVAD therapy and confirm implantation of LVADs via a less 
invasive approach as being cost-effective.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) represents a 
high-risk subset of coronary artery disease with significant morbidity and 
mortality if not treated in a timely manner. In this review, we survey the 
contemporary evidence on the management of LMCAD, highlight advances, and 
provide in-depth review of data comparing surgical and percutaneous approaches.
RECENT FINDINGS: LMCAD represents a heterogeneous condition and management 
should be guided by key clinical and anatomic factors. In recent years, there 
has been a wealth of published prospective data including results of the EXCEL 
and NOBLE trials. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), remains the gold standard 
for optimal long-term outcomes and the greatest benefit seen in patients with 
higher anatomic complexity and longer life expectancy. Percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) offers a less-invasive approach with rapid recovery. PCI is 
optimal in situations when surgery cannot be offered in a timely manner due to 
hemodynamic instability, for high-risk surgical patients, or those with limited 
life expectancy, if LMCAD is anatomically simple. As a result of continued 
technological and procedural improvements in both PCI and CABG, cardiovascular 
specialists possess a growing armamentarium of approaches to treat LMCAD. Thus, 
center specialization and use of a heart team approach are increasingly vital, 
though barriers remain.
SUMMARY: Emerging evidence continues to support CABG as the gold standard for 
achieving optimal long-term outcomes in patients with LMCAD. PCI offers a more 
expeditious approach with rapid recovery and is a safe and effective alternative 
in appropriately selected candidates.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to outline the important echocardiographic 
findings observed in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 
in the current era of treatment.
RECENT FINDINGS: HIV infection has a wide spectrum of cardiac manifestations. 
Myocardial and pericardial involvement were the primary cardiac manifestations 
in HIV patients early during the epidemic in the developed countries. In the 
current era of effective antiretroviral therapy, the spectrum has shifted to 
metabolic abnormalities (hyperlipidemia, hypertension, etc.), accelerated 
atherosclerotic disease, and cardiac sequelae related to these abnormalities. 
Dramatic improvement in life expectancy of patients with HIV infection has 
resulted in a shift in the developed nations in the spectrum of cardiac 
manifestations, currently dominated by diastolic dysfunction and coronary artery 
disease. Echocardiography and advanced echocardiographic techniques play a major 
role in diagnosis and screening of HIV patients with underlying cardiovascular 
abnormalities.

Viral hepatitis has been recognized as a leading cause of deaths worldwide. We 
aimed to analyse the disease burden of viral hepatitis at the global, regional 
and national levels. We collected the data of death number, mortality rate, and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of viral hepatitis by sex, age, geography 
and type of disease from the Global Health Data Exchange platform. Estimated 
average percentage change (EAPC) was used to quantify the age-standardized 
mortality rate (ASMR) of viral hepatitis between 1990 and 2017. Globally, the 
number of deaths from viral hepatitis increased from 980.9 thousand in 1990 to 
1412.3 thousand in 2017, accompanying by the DALYs increased from 35.2 million 
to 43.1 million in the same period. Hepatitis B and C accounted for 97.6% of 
total viral hepatitis-related deaths worldwide in 2017. While the death number 
and DALYs were decreased in acute hepatitis A, B, C and E, a significant 
increase was found in liver cancer and cirrhosis due to hepatitis B and C. The 
ASMRs of liver cancer and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B and C were decreased 
at the global level and in most regions. However, a significant increase was 
observed in several developed countries, such as the USA and the UK. The disease 
burden of viral hepatitis continues to increase worldwide, which was driven by 
the increase in burden of chronic hepatitis B and C.

The State of Our Understanding of the Pathophysiology and Optimal Treatment of 
Depression: Glass Half Full or Half Empty?

Major depressive disorder is a remarkably common and often severe psychiatric 
disorder associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Patients with 
major depression are prone to several comorbid psychiatric conditions, including 
posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
and substance use disorders, and medical conditions, including cardiovascular 
disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer, which, coupled with the risk of suicide, 
result in a shortened life expectancy. The goal of this review is to provide an 
overview of our current understanding of major depression, from pathophysiology 
to treatment. In spite of decades of research, relatively little is known about 
its pathogenesis, other than that risk is largely defined by a combination of 
ill-defined genetic and environmental factors. Although we know that female sex, 
a history of childhood maltreatment, and family history as well as more recent 
stressors are risk factors, precisely how these environmental influences 
interact with genetic vulnerability remains obscure. In recent years, 
considerable advances have been made in beginning to understand the genetic 
substrates that underlie disease vulnerability, and the interaction of genes, 
early-life adversity, and the epigenome in influencing gene expression is now 
being intensively studied. The role of inflammation and other immune system 
dysfunction in the pathogenesis of major depression is also being intensively 
investigated. Brain imaging studies have provided a firmer understanding of the 
circuitry involved in major depression, providing potential new therapeutic 
targets. Despite a broad armamentarium for major depression, including 
antidepressants, evidence-based psychotherapies, nonpharmacological somatic 
treatments, and a host of augmentation strategies, a sizable percentage of 
patients remain nonresponsive or poorly responsive to available treatments. 
Investigational agents with novel mechanisms of action are under active study. 
Personalized medicine in psychiatry provides the hope of escape from the current 
standard trial-and-error approach to treatment, moving to a more refined method 
that augurs a new era for patients and clinicians alike.

ãJapan is currently one of the countries with a long life expectancy, in which a 
great number of older people need care for their daily living. Japan has become 
increasingly internationalized due to an increase in foreigners and 
international marriages. As the number of elderly foreigners and foreign-born 
Japanese increase, older adults who do not use Japanese as their first language 
will need more opportunities to receive care.ãWe examined characteristics such 
as country of origin, language spoken, lifestyle, living environment, and 
cultural background of elderly people who were either foreign permanent 
residents living in Japan or foreign-born Japanese (hereinafter referred to as 
elderly with an international background, in short, EIB) receiving care support. 
Ichushi-web, a medical literature database, was used [last search date: June 2, 
2018]. These searches extracted 205 papers. After the first and second 
extraction procedures, only two papers matched this theme. These two reports 
were for Korean residents in Japan, so-called special permanent residents, and 
repatriates from China and their spouses, many of whom were aged 75 years old 
and above.ãThe number of permanent residents in Japan who speak a foreign 
language as their first language is increasing. Inhibition of communication 
between EIB and healthcare welfare service providers is expected to be an 
obstacle while accessing care support services. For this reason, we must provide 
them with information related to Japanese healthcare services. Medical 
interpretation efforts are scattered and the response to EIB in the event of 
disasters has been discussed. From the perspective of multicultural coexistence, 
it is necessary to provide long-term care insurance services and medical 
services to EIB. Such efforts may include development and sharing of tools and 
the placement of staff who can communicate with non-Japanese speakers. Staff 
must also understand various illness- and health awareness-related issues.ãIn 
the future, considering the increasing number of EIB who may require care 
services, we must consider cultural backgrounds and language diversification for 
EIB. These issues require clarification and development of acceptable solutions.

A 2-day-old Japanese Black male calf that presented with opisthotonos with 
spastic extension of all four limbs and nystagmus was presented. Evaluation of 
cranial neurology revealed a horizontal slow nystagmus and absence of menace 
response in the left eye. Necropsy revealed a mass located between the posterior 
margin of the cerebrum and anterior margin of the cerebellum, and continuously 
with the cerebellar lesion. The brainstem was severely compressed by those 
lesions. Original structures of the cerebellum were mostly replaced by 
grayish-white and brownish tissues. Those lesions were diagnosed as presumed 
cerebellar medulloblastoma by histopathological and immunohistochemical 
examination. As neuron-specific enolase in the cerebrospinal fluid which is a 
biomarker for neuronal damage was increased compared with healthy calves.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this case series was to report the long-term 
patient-reported and functional outcomes of complex bicondylar tibial plateau 
fractures in patients treated with internal fixation in combination with an 
Ilizarov fixator.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective series of cases. Patient-reported, 
radiological and functional outcomes were obtained with a mean of 9.4 years' 
follow-up.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients completed the follow-up. At follow-up, the mean age 
was 52.2 years, ranging from 26 to 69 years. The gender distribution was 14 
males and 8 females. The mean knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score 
(KOOS) was pain 72.5, symptoms 62.7, ADL 75.9, sport 35.4, and knee related 
quality of life (QOL) 56.4. Compared to a reference population, the present 
study reported worse outcome for the subscales: symptoms, sport, and QOL. The 
maximal isometric muscle strength for knee extension was 354N for the noninjured 
leg and 325N for the injured leg (p = 0.27). Assessment of gait functions showed 
a gait speed of 122.7 cm/second and a cadence of 112.7 steps/minute. Gait speed 
and cadence showed no significant difference when compared to a reference 
population. Radiological examination of knee osteoarthritis (OA) showed 6 
patients presented with none OA, 13 patients with mild OA, and 3 patients with 
severe OA.
CONCLUSION: Complex bicondylar tibial plateau fractures are associated with 
long-term decreased knee structure-specific patient-reported outcome (KOOS). In 
contrast, most patients presented with satisfactory long-term radiological and 
functional outcomes. More research is needed to understand the complex 
association between patient-reported outcomes and radiological and functional 
outcomes.

Cell culture is one of the most commonly used techniques in the production of 
biological products. Many physical and chemical parameters may affect cell 
growth and proliferation. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of 
chemical components as supplements using the experimental design method, which 
aimed at reducing the number of experiments. For this purpose, supplements 
including chemical components using four levels, with three replications in 
suspension and batch culture conditions, were examined for 72 hours using the 
Taguchi experimental design method. From the experiments, it was concluded that 
the culture media composition had a significant impact on final cell count and 
pH. High concentrations of different media composition alone were insufficient 
to ensure higher cell count. According to the results, this insufficiency was 
associated with an increase of 20% in the number of final cells. In the majority 
of cultures, the number of final cells at 48 hours increased relative to the 
number of final cells at 24 hours after culturing the cells.

PURPOSE: Kidney transplantation (KT) is the treatment of choice for end-stage 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is well known to improve the clinical outcome 
of patients. However, the impact of KT on comorbid psychological symptoms, 
particularly depression and anxiety, is less clear, and recipients of 
living-donor (LD) organs may have a different psychological outcome from 
recipients of dead-donor (DD) organs.
DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: In total, 152 patients were included and analyzed 
using a cross-sectional design. Of these patients, 25 were pre-KT, 13 were 
post-KT with a LD transplant and 114 were post-KT with a DD transplant. The 
patients were tested for a variety of psychometric outcomes using the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale, the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (assessing 
physical and mental health-related quality of life), the Resilience Scale, the 
Coping Self-Questionnaire and the Social Support Questionnaire.
FINDINGS: The mean age of the patients was 51.25âyears and 40 per cent of the 
patients were female. As expected, the post-KT patients had significantly better 
scores on the physical component of the Short Form Health Survey than the pre-KT 
patients, and there were no significant differences between the two post-KT 
groups. There were no significant differences among the groups in any of the 
other psychometric outcome parameters tested, including anxiety, depression and 
the mental component of health-related quality of life.
RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: KT and the origin of the donor organ do not 
appear to have a significant impact on the psychological well-being of 
transplant patients with CKD. Although the diagnosis and early treatment of 
psychological symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, remain important for 
these patients, decisions regarding KT, including the mode of transplantation, 
should not be fundamentally influenced by concerns about psychological 
impairments at the population level.
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: CKD is a serious condition involving profound impairment of 
the physical and psychological well-being of patients. KT is considered the 
treatment of choice for most of these patients. KT has notable advantages over 
dialysis with regard to the long-term physical functioning of the renal and 
cardiovascular system and increases the life expectancy of patients. However, 
the data on the improvement of psychological impairments after KT are less 
conclusive.

BACKGROUND: Sierra Leone faces among the highest maternal mortality rates 
worldwide. Despite this burden, the role of life-saving critical care 
interventions in low-resource settings remains scarcely explored. A value-based 
approach may be used to question whether it is sustainable and useful to start 
and run an obstetric intermediate critical care facility in a resource-poor 
referral hospital. We also aimed to investigate whether patient outcomes in 
terms of quality of life justified the allocated resources.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the value-based dimension performing a cost-utility 
analysis with regard to the implementation and one-year operation of the HDU. 
The primary endopoint was the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of patients 
admitted to the HDU, against direct and indirect costs. Secondary endpoints 
included key procedures or treatments performed during the HDU stay.
METHODS: The study was conducted from October 2, 2017 to October 1, 2018 in the 
obstetric high dependency unit (HDU) of Princess Christian Maternity Hospital 
(PCMH) in Freetown, Sierra Leone.
FINDINGS: 523 patients (median age 25 years, IQR 21-30) were admitted to HDU. 
The total 1 year investment and operation costs for the HDU amounted to â¬120,082 
- resulting in â¬230 of extra cost per admitted patient. The overall cost per 
QALY gained was of â¬10; this value is much lower than the WHO threshold defining 
high cost effectiveness of an intervention, i.e. three times the current Sierra 
Leone annual per capita GDP of â¬1416.
CONCLUSION: With an additional cost per QALY of only â¬10.0, the implementation 
and one-year running of the case studied obstetric HDU can be considered a 
highly cost-effective frugal innovation in limited resource contexts. The 
evidences provided by this study allow a precise and novel insight to policy 
makers and clinicians useful to prioritize interventions in critical care and 
thus address maternal mortality in a high burden scenario.

BACKGROUND: Although the notion of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) 
tube placement for patients with dementia has been changing, the number of cases 
of PEG placement remains high as Japan has become a super-aged society. However, 
there is insufficient research about the clinical course of dementia patients 
with PEG, especially regarding PEG extubation after regaining full oral intake. 
This case series aimed to reveal the demographic data of patients who 
successfully underwent PEG extubation and to identify clinical factors that 
might help predict eventual resumption.
METHODS: This retrospective case series was identified in a private, 
community-based long-term care hospital in Sapporo, Japan. Inclusion criteria 
for the series were: 1) age, â¥75 years, 2) diagnosis of any type of dementia, 
and 3) resumption of full oral intake after removal of PEG tubes.
RESULTS: Eight female patients were identified. Decreased oral intake was 
triggered by acute medical conditions, such as infectious enteritis. A trial of 
oral intake was initiated mostly by speech therapists. A majority of the 
patients ate pureed food. The patients aged â¥85 years with advanced dementia 
could be weaned from PEG tubes.
CONCLUSION: The series indicates that even patients with limited life expectancy 
could recover swallowing function by receiving appropriate guidance and care. 
Constant evaluation for swallowing function even after PEG insertion may be 
important for PEG extubation.

BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) allows patients to declare their 
preferences for life-sustaining and hospice palliative care. However, the 
perception of ACP remains low in Korea. The present study assessed the attitudes 
and status of medical professionals in relation to end-of-life care decisions in 
older and noncancerous patients.
METHODS: This descriptive correlation study was performed to understand the 
attitudes regarding and status of ACP and advance directives (AD). For this 
purpose, we conducted a survey of members who attended the Spring Conference of 
the Korean Geriatrics Society in May 2015 using a questionnaire that included 
questions on experiences related to AD, opinions on disturbance factors and 
improvement measures, and questions about the status of their medical 
institutions.
RESULTS: All of 181 respondents were doctors. Among the respondents, 21.7% had 
the experience of treating patients who had completed an AD. Medical 
professionals saw AD use as appropriate for terminal patients with less than 6 
months of life expectancy, as well as those with degenerative neurological 
disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, chronic diseases such as 
chronic renal disease, and early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that geriatrics medical professionals agreed with 
the necessity for AD in noncancerous terminal diseases and that consideration of 
a family-centered decision-making culture, legal protection for medical 
professionals, and education of the general public and medical professionals 
will be helpful for the popularization of AD.

The long circulating half-life and inherently bivalent architecture of IgGs 
provide an ideal vehicle for presenting otherwise short-lived G-protein-coupled 
receptor agonists in a format that enables avidity-driven enhancement of 
potency. Here, we describe the site-specific conjugation of a dual agonist 
peptide (an oxyntomodulin variant engineered for potency and in vivo stability) 
to the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of an immunologically silent 
IgG4. A cysteine-containing heavy chain CDR3 variant was identified that 
provided clean conjugation to a bromoacetylated peptide without interference 
from any of the endogenous mAb cysteine residues. The resulting mAb-peptide 
homodimer has high potency at both target receptors (glucagon receptor, GCGR, 
and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor, GLP-1R) driven by an increase in receptor 
avidity provided by the spatially defined presentation of the peptides. 
Interestingly, the avidity effects are different at the two target receptors. A 
single dose of the long-acting peptide conjugate robustly inhibited food intake 
and decreased body weight in insulin resistant diet-induced obese mice, in 
addition to ameliorating glucose intolerance. Inhibition of food intake and 
decrease in body weight was also seen in overweight cynomolgus monkeys. The 
weight loss resulting from dosing with the bivalently conjugated dual agonist 
was significantly greater than for the monomeric analog, clearly demonstrating 
translation of the measured in vitro avidity to in vivo pharmacology.

AIMS: Widowed people have increased mortality compared to married people of the 
same age. Although most widowed people are of older age, few studies include the 
oldest old. As life expectancy is increasing, knowledge of widowhood into older 
age is needed. This study aimed to examine mortality and widowhood in older age 
by comparing mortality in widowed and married people by sex, age, time since 
spousal loss and cause of death.
METHODS: A Danish register-based matched cohort study of 10% of widowed persons 
â©¾65 years in the years 2000-2009. For each randomly drawn widowed person, five 
married persons were matched on sex and age. Mortality rate ratios (MRR) were 
calculated using Poisson regression, and stratified according to sex and 5-year 
age intervals. MRRs were furthermore calculated by time since spousal loss and 
by specific cause of death.
RESULTS: The study included 82 130 persons contributing with 642 914.8 
person-years. The overall MRR between widowed and married persons with up to 16 
years of follow-up was 1.25 (95% CI 1.23-1.28). At age â©¾95 years for men, and 
â©¾90 years for women, no differences in mortality rates were seen between widowed 
and married persons. Mortality in widowed persons was increased for most 
specific causes of death, with the highest MRR from external causes (MRR 1.53 
[1.35-1.74]) and endocrine diseases (MRR 1.51 [1.34-1.70]).
CONCLUSIONS: Widowhood was associated with increased mortality in older age for 
both men and women until age â©¾95 and â©¾90 years, respectively. Increased 
mortality was observed for almost all causes of death.

AIMS: The economic burden of diabetes is driven by the management of vascular 
complications. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have 
demonstrated reductions in cardiovascular and renal complications, including 
hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) and renal disease progression, in 
randomized clinical trials. The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of the SGLT2i class versus standard of care in type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), using evidence from both clinical trial and real-world 
studies.
METHODS: An established T2DM model was adapted to use contemporary outcomes 
evidence from real-world studies and randomized controlled trial evaluations of 
SGLT2i, and extrapolated over a lifetime for HHF, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
end-stage renal disease and all-cause mortality. The economic analysis 
considered adults with T2DM, with and without established cardiovascular 
disease, and was conducted over a lifetime from the perspective of the health 
care payer in the United Kingdom, United States and China, discounted at 
country-specific rates.
RESULTS: SGLT2i were consistently associated with increased treatment costs, 
reduced complication costs and gains in quality-adjusted life years driven by 
differences in projected life expectancy, cardiovascular and microvascular 
morbidity and weight loss. SGLT2i were estimated to be cost-saving or 
cost-effective at relevant thresholds for the overall population in the United 
Kingdom, United States and China, with cost-effectiveness being the greatest in 
higher risk subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the need to take into account cost savings 
from reducing common, morbid and preventable T2DM complications when considering 
the cost of diabetes medications.

Modeling real-life transportation problems usually require the simultaneous 
incorporation of different variants of the classical vehicle routing problem 
(VRP). The periodic VRP (PVRP) is a classical extension in which routes are 
determined for a planning period of several days and each customer has an 
associated set of allowable visit schedules. This work proposes a unified model 
framework for PVRP that consists of multiple attributes or variants not 
previously addressed simultaneously, such as time-windows, time-dependence, and 
consistency -which guarantees the visits to customer by the same vehicle-, 
together with three objective functions that respond to the needs of practical 
problems. The numerical experimentation is focused on the effects of three 
factors: frequency, depot centrality, and the objective function on the 
performance of a general-purpose MILP solver, through the analysis of the 
achieved relative gaps. Results show higher sensitivity to the objective 
functions and to the problem sizes.

AIM: When glycaemic control for people with type 2 diabetes is not achieved with 
metformin and sulfonylurea alone, adding another oral anti-diabetes drug, such 
as a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) 
inhibitor, is an alternative to starting insulin. The aim of this study is to 
determine the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) compared 
with DPP-4 inhibitors when added to metformin and sulfonylurea in people with 
type 2 diabetes in the Netherlands.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis is performed using the Cardiff diabetes model, 
a fixed-time increment stochastic simulation model informed by 'United Kingdom 
Prospective Diabetes Study 68' risk equations. The base-case analysis uses a 
40-year time horizon, a Dutch societal perspective and differential discounting 
(4% for costs, 1.5% for effects). Inputs are obtained from the literature and 
Dutch price lists. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis are 
performed.
RESULTS: Dapagliflozin is dominant compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, resulting in 
a â¬990 cost saving and a 0.28 quality-adjusted life year gain over 40Â years. 
Cost savings are associated mainly with treatment costs and a reduced incidence 
of micro- and macrovascular complications, among others nephropathy, myocardial 
infarction and stroke. Results are robust to changes in input parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin is a cost-saving alternative to DPP-4 inhibitors when 
added to metformin and sulfonylurea. The incidence of micro- and macrovascular 
complications is lower for people treated with dapagliflozin. Uncertainty around 
this outcome is low.

About 15% of adults in the United States-37 million persons-have chronic kidney 
disease (CKD). Chronic kidney disease is divided into 5 groups, ranging from 
stage 1 to stage 5 CKD, whereas end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is defined as 
permanent kidney failure. The treatment options for ESKD are kidney replacement 
therapy (KRT) and conservative management. The options for KRT include 
hemodialysis (either in-center or at home), peritoneal dialysis, and kidney 
transplant. Conservative management, a multidisciplinary model of care for 
patients with stage 5 CKD who want to avoid dialysis, is guided by patient 
values, preferences, and goals, with a focus on quality of life and symptom 
management. In 2015, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommended 
that patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 30 mL/min/1.73 
m2 be educated about options for both KRT and conservative management. In 2018, 
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended that 
assessment for KRT or conservative management start at least 1 year before the 
need for therapy. It also recommended that in choosing a management approach, 
predicted quality of life, predicted life expectancy, patient preferences, and 
other patient factors be considered, because little difference in outcomes has 
been found among options. Here, 2 experts-a nephrologist and a general 
internist-palliative care physician-reflect on the care of a patient with 
advanced CKD and mild to moderate dementia. They discuss the management options 
for patients with advanced CKD, the pros and cons of each method, and how to 
help a patient choose among the options.

Normative databases allow testing of novel hypotheses without the costly 
collection of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Here we present the 
Amsterdam Ultra-high field adult lifespan database (AHEAD). The AHEAD consists 
of 105 7 Tesla (T) whole-brain structural MRI scans tailored specifically to 
imaging of the human subcortex, including both male and female participants and 
covering the entire adult life span (18-80 yrs). We used these data to create 
probability maps for the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, internal and 
external segment of the globus pallidus, and the red nucleus. Data was acquired 
at a submillimeter resolution using a multi-echo (ME) extension of the second 
gradient-echo image of the MP2RAGE sequence (MP2RAGEME) sequence, resulting in 
complete anatomical alignment of quantitative, R1-maps, R2*-maps, T1-maps, 
T1-weighted images, T2*-maps, and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). 
Quantitative MRI maps, and derived probability maps of basal ganglia structures 
are freely available for further analyses.

Iterative Filtering Decomposition Based Early Dementia Diagnosis Using EEG With 
Cognitive Tests.

Sharma N, Kolekar MH, Jha K.

OBJECTIVE: There has been a constant increase in life expectancy with the 
advancement of modern medicine. Likewise, dementia has also increased and 
projected to elevate in the coming decades with the higher expenditure on 
healthcare. Consequently, it is essential to identify early dementia, e.g., a 
patient suffering from mild cognitive impairment who is highly vulnerable to 
developing dementia soon.
METHODS: Through this work, we brought forward an approach by fusing cognitive 
task and EEG signal processing. Continuous EEG of 16 dementia, 16 early dementia 
and 15 healthy subjects recorded under two resting states; eye open and eye 
closed, and two cognitive states; finger tapping test (FTT) and the continuous 
performance test (CPT). The present approach introduced iterative filtering (IF) 
as a decomposition technique for dementia diagnosis along with four significant 
EEG features power spectral density, variance, fractal dimension and Tsallis 
entropy. Multi-class classification conducted to compare the decision tree, k 
nearest neighbour ( k NN), support vector machine, and ensemble classifiers.
RESULTS: The proposed approach deeply checked for their capability of prediction 
using cognitive scores and EEG measures. The highest accuracies obtained by k NN 
with 10-fold cross-validation for dementia, early dementia and healthy are 
92.00%, 91.67% and 91.87%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The essential findings of this study are: 1) Experimental results 
indicate that k NN is superior over other classifier algorithms for dementia 
diagnosis. 2) CPT is the best predictor for healthy subjects. 3) FTT can be an 
essential test to diagnose significant dementia.
SIGNIFICANCE: IF decomposition technique enhances the diagnostic accuracy even 
with a limited dataset.
