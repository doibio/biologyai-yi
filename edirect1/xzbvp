waste generation is an essential step, since various factors can affect waste 
trends. The application of predictive and prognosis models are useful tools, as 
reliable support for decision making processes. In this paper some indicators 
such as: number of residents, population age, urban life expectancy, total 
municipal solid waste were used as input variables in prognostic models in order 
to predict the amount of solid waste fractions. We applied Waste Prognostic 
Tool, regression analysis and time series analysis to forecast municipal solid 
waste generation and composition by considering the Iasi Romania case study. 
Regression equations were determined for six solid waste fractions (paper, 
plastic, metal, glass, biodegradable and other waste). Accuracy Measures were 
calculated and the results showed that S-curve trend model is the most suitable 
for municipal solid waste (MSW) prediction.

BACKGROUND: Majority of the countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) 
African Region are not on track to achieve the health-related Millennium 
Development Goals, yet even more ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 
including SDG 3 on heath, have been adopted. This paper highlights the 
challenges - amplified by the recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West 
Africa - that require WHO and other partners' dialogue in support of the 
countries, and debate on how WHO can leverage the existing space and place to 
foster health development dialogues in the Region.
DISCUSSION: To realise SDG 3 on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being 
for all at all ages, the African Region needs to tackle the persistent 
weaknesses in its health systems, systems that address the social determinants 
of health and national health research systems. The performance of the third 
item is crucial for the development and innovation of systems, products and 
tools for promoting, maintaining and restoring health in an equitable manner. 
Under its new leadership, the WHO Regional Office for Africa is transforming 
itself to galvanise existing partnerships, as well as forging new ones, with a 
view to accelerating the provision of timely and quality support to the 
countries in pursuit of SDG 3. WHO in the African Region engages in dialogues 
with various stakeholders in the process of health development. The EVD outbreak 
in West Africa accentuated the necessity for optimally exploiting currently 
available space and place for health development discourse. There is urgent need 
for the WHO Regional Office for Africa to fully leverage the space and place 
arenas of the World Health Assembly, WHO Regional Committee for Africa, African 
Union, Regional economic communities, Harmonization for Health in Africa, United 
Nations Economic Commission for Africa, African Development Bank, professional 
associations, and WHO African Health Forum, when it is created, for dialogues to 
mobilise the required resources to give the African Region the thrust it needs 
to attain SDG 3.
CONCLUSIONS: The pursuit of SDG 3 amidst multiple challenges related to 
political leadership and governance, weak health systems, sub-optimal systems 
for addressing the socioeconomic determinants of health, and weak national 
health research systems calls for optimum use of all the space and place 
available for regional health development dialogues to supplement Member States' 
efforts.

University, Liverpool, UK bDepartment of Physiology, Radboud University Medical 
Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands cDivision of Cardiology, Hartford Hospital, 
Hartford, Connecticut, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Habitual physical activity can reduce the risk of future 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This review evaluates recent 
publications that have assessed the impact of the dose of physical (in)activity 
on cardiovascular outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Sedentary behavior, characterized by prolonged sitting, is 
increasingly prevalent across the globe and increases the risk for 
cardiovascular events in a dose-dependent fashion. Similarly, the number of 
individuals performing endurance exercise events has tripled over the last 2 
decades, and some studies suggest that the high volumes of exercise training and 
competition may attenuate the health benefits of a physically active lifestyle.
SUMMARY: Breaking up sitting time or replacing sitting by (light) physical 
activity are effective strategies to attenuate its detrimental health effects. 
Low doses of physical activity, preferably at a high intensity, significantly 
reduce the risk for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Larger doses of 
exercise yield larger health benefits. Extreme doses of exercise neither 
increase nor decrease the risk for adverse outcomes. Athletes demonstrate a 
transient cardiac dysfunction and biomarker release directly postexercise. 
Chronic exercise training may increase the risk for atrial fibrillation, but is 
also associated with a superior life expectancy compared with the general 
population.

BACKGROUND: Subcutaneous administration of Ig (SCIg) has gained popularity as an 
alternative route of administration but has never been rigorously examined in 
chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).
METHODS/DESIGN: The primary objective of the PATH study (Polyneuropathy and 
Treatment with Hizentra) is to determine the efficacy of two different doses of 
SCIg IgPro20 (0.2 g/kg bw or 0.4 g/kg bw) in a 24-week maintenance treatment of 
CIDP in comparison to placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the 
proportion of patients who show CIDP relapse (1-point deterioration on the 
adjusted Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability score) 
or are withdrawn within 24 weeks after randomization for any reason. 
IVIg-dependent adult patients with definite or probable CIDP according to the 
European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society who 
fulfil the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible. Based on 
sample-size calculation and relapse assumptions in the three arms, a sample size 
of 58 is needed per arm (overall sample size will be 350, of which 174 will be 
randomized). All eligible patients will progress through three study periods: an 
IgG dependency period (≤12 weeks) to select those who are Ig dependent; an IVIg 
restabilization period (10 or 13 weeks), which will be performed using the 10 % 
IgPro10 product; and an SC treatment period (24 weeks, followed by a 1-week 
completion visit after last follow-up). Patients showing IVIg restabilization 
will be randomized to demonstrate the efficacy of SCIg IgPro20 maintenance 
treatment over placebo. After completing the study, subjects are eligible to 
enter a long-term, open-label, extension study of 1 year or return to their 
previous treatment. In case of CIDP relapse during the 24-week SC treatment 
period, IgPro10 rescue medication will be offered. Safety, tolerability, and 
patients' preference of Ig administration route will be examined.
DISCUSSION: The PATH trial, which started in March 2012, is expected to finish 
at the end of 2016. The results will increase knowledge about the efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability of SCIg in maintenance management of CIDP patients.

Complications of sinusitis.

Carr TF(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.

BACKGROUND: Sinusitis is a common disorder associated with significant patient 
symptomatology that adversely affects quality of life. Sinusitis can cause 
further morbidity and mortality through its impact on comorbid disorders, 
progression of inflammation, and extension of infection.
OBJECTIVE: This review highlights common complications of acute bacterial 
rhinosinusitis (ABRS) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).
RESULTS: ABRS is complicated by orbital infections, such as pre- or postseptal 
cellulitis, and by intracranial infections, including abscesses of the epidural 
and subdural spaces. CRS can contribute to asthma, sleep disordered breathing, 
and smell disorders. CRS can be complicated by development of allergic fungal 
rhinosinusitis or deformity of surrounding bony structures. Fungal complications 
contribute to morbidity and mortality.
CONCLUSION: Complications of ABRS, although relatively rare, can cause 
significant morbidity and mortality, and must be promptly recognized. CRS 
commonly complicates or drives comorbid diseases, which adversely impacts 
quality of life. Treatment of these complications often requires coordinated 
multidisciplinary care.

Effect of Packaging on Shelf-life and Lutein Content of Marigold (Tagetes erecta 
L.) Flowers.

Pal S, Ghosh PK, Bhattacharjee P(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Food Technology and Biochemical Engineering, Jadavpur 
University, Kolkata 700032, India.

BACKGROUND: African marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) flowers are highly valued for 
their ornamental appeal as well as medicinal properties. However, their short 
shelf lives cause high post-harvest loss and limit their export potential. The 
review of patents and research articles revealed that different types of 
packaging designs/materials have been successfully employed for extension of 
shelf lives of cut flowers.
OBJECTIVE: The current work focuses on designing of different packaging 
configurations and selection of best configuration for preservation of marigold 
cut flowers.
METHODS: Ten packaging configurations, composed of four different packaging 
materials i.e., low density polyethylene (LDPE), polyethylene terephthalate, 
glassine paper and cellophane paper, were designed. Each pack, consisting of 20 
± 1 g of marigold flowers along with non-packaged control set were stored at 23 
± 2°C, 80% R.H., in an environmental chamber and the flowers were evaluated for 
their sensory attributes, phytochemical characteristics and physicochemical 
parameters of senescence to determine their shelf lives.
RESULTS: Flowers packed in LDPE bag showed highest shelf life of 8 days with a 
lead of 4 days compared to control (shelf life - 4 days). This study also 
established for the first time the phenomenon of carotenogenesis in marigold cut 
flowers with significantly (P<0.01) higher production of lutein in LDPE packaged 
flowers.
CONCLUSION: LDPE pack was the best design among the ten package designs, in 
preserving lutein content of marigold flowers and extending their shelf lives. 
This economically viable packaging can not only boost the export potential of 
this ornamental flower, but also allow utilization of nutraceutical potency of 
lutein.

Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit C from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 
(PaAhpC) is a member of the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin family. Here, we examined the 
peroxidase and molecular chaperone functions of PaAhpC using a site-directed 
mutagenesis approach by substitution of Ser and Thr residues with Cys at 
positions 78 and 105 located between two catalytic cysteines. Substitution of 
Ser with Cys at position 78 enhanced the chaperone activity of the mutant 
(S78C-PaAhpC) by approximately 9-fold compared with that of the wild-type 
protein (WT-PaAhpC). This increased activity may have been associated with the 
proportionate increase in the high-molecular-weight (HMW) fraction and enhanced 
hydrophobicity of S78C-PaAhpC. Homology modeling revealed that mutation of 
Ser(78) to Cys(78) resulted in a more compact decameric structure than that 
observed in WT-PaAhpC and decreased the atomic distance between the two 
neighboring sulfur atoms of Cys(78) in the dimer-dimer interface of S78C-PaAhpC, 
which could be responsible for the enhanced hydrophobic interaction at the 
dimer-dimer interface. Furthermore, complementation assays showed that 
S78C-PaAhpC exhibited greatly improved the heat tolerance, resulting in enhanced 
survival under thermal stress. Thus, addition of Cys at position 78 in PaAhpC 
modulated the functional shifting of this protein from a peroxidase to a 
chaperone.

Immunotoxins have documented potential as a cancer treatment due to their 
extreme potency; a single toxin molecule delivered to the cytosol may be 
sufficient to kill a cell. However, their short half-life in the circulatory 
system may be one of the key problems associated with the clinical use of 
immunotoxins and may continue to limit their therapeutic activity. Herein, we 
genetically fused an albumin-binding domain (ABD) to the human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific immunotoxin ZHER2-PE38 to extend the 
circulation time and thus improve the therapeutic outcome of this immunotoxin. 
Furthermore, the fusion of an ABD to the immunotoxin was found to promote 
non-covalent interactions between the immunotoxin and serum albumin, which 
rescue the immunotoxin from lysosomal degradation through a serum 
albumin-mediated interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). This 
manuscript reports the construction, purification, and characterization of the 
ABD-fused HER2-specific immunotoxin, ABD-ZHER2-PE38, both in vitro and in vivo. 
Compared with non-fused ZHER2-PE38, this new construct exhibits a clearly 
increased half-life in plasma (330.8 versus 13.5min, approximately 24.4-fold 
extension) and remarkably improved antitumor effects in an NCI-N87 subcutaneous 
xenograft model. Therefore, the new construct represents a potentially 
attractive therapeutic modality, and the proposed strategy may also have useful 
applications for current immunotoxin designs.

INTRODUCTION: Wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic eye 
condition that causes severe deterioration of vision and even blindness. Current 
wet AMD treatment in the UK involves the vascular endothelial growth factor 
inhibitors ranibizumab and aflibercept. Patients with wet AMD require frequent 
and long-term monitoring for treatment to be effective, contributing to a 
substantial resource burden at wet AMD centers. The European license for 
ranibizumab was recently updated with an individualized 'treat and extend' (T&E) 
regimen, comprising a structured monitoring and treatment protocol. This study 
evaluated the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab T&E versus aflibercept within a 
UK setting.
METHODS: An individual patient-level simulation model was developed utilizing 
treatment effects from a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. 
The model was conducted from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective over 
a lifetime horizon and the base case utilized probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
to assess uncertainty in the model. Additional scenario analyses were conducted 
to assess the impact of changes to the model inputs.
RESULTS: Ranibizumab T&E was found to be more effective and less costly than 
aflibercept, providing, on average, an additional 1.058 quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) and a cost-saving of £19,604 over a lifetime horizon. At list 
price, ranibizumab T&E was found to be cost-effective versus aflibercept in 100% 
of simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY. The 
robustness of the results was tested in several scenario analyses; ranibizumab 
T&E was found to be more effective, and less costly, than aflibercept in the 
vast majority of cases.
CONCLUSION: This evaluation suggests that treating patients with ranibizumab 
according to the T&E regimen could be a better use of NHS resources than 
aflibercept, and could, therefore, be considered as a first-line regimen for 
patients with wet AMD in the UK.

BACKGROUND: Young patients with severe glenohumeral arthritis pose a challenging 
management problem for shoulder surgeons. Two controversial treatment options 
are total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and hemiarthroplasty. This study aims to 
characterize costs, as expressed by reimbursements for episodes of acute care, 
and outcomes associated with each treatment.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked: for patients 30 to 50 years old with severe 
end-stage glenohumeral arthritis refractory to conservative management, (1) are 
more years of patient-derived satisfactory outcome by the Neer criteria and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) achieved using a TSA or a hemiarthroplasty; 
(2) does a TSA or a hemiarthroplasty result in a greater number of revision 
procedures; and (3) does a TSA or a hemiarthroplasty result in greater 
associated costs to society?
METHODS: The incidence of glenohumeral arthritis among 30- to 50-year-old 
patients, outcomes, reoperation probabilities, and associated costs from TSA and 
hemiarthroplasty were derived from the literature. A Markov chain decision tree 
model was developed from these estimates with number of revisions, cost of 
management for patients to 70 years old as defined by reimbursement for 
acute-care episodes, years with "satisfactory" or "excellent" outcome by the 
modified Neer criteria, and QALYs gained as principle outcome measures. A Monte 
Carlo simulation was conducted with a cohort representing the at-risk population 
for shoulder arthritis between 30 and 50 years old in the United States.
RESULTS: During the lifetime of a cohort of 5279 patients, hemiarthroplasty as 
the initial treatment resulted in 59,574 patient years of satisfactory or 
excellent results (11.29 per patient) and average QALYs gained of 6.55, whereas 
TSA as the initial treatment resulted in 85,969 patient years of satisfactory or 
excellent results (16.29 per patient) and average QALYs gained of 7.96. During 
the lifetime of a cohort of 5279 patients, a hemiarthroplasty as the initial 
treatment led to 2090 lifetime revisions (0.4 per patient), whereas a TSA as the 
initial treatment led to 1605 lifetime revisions (0.3 per patient). During the 
lifetime of a cohort of 5279 patients, a hemiarthroplasty as initial treatment 
resulted in USD 132,500,000 associated direct reimbursements (USD 25,000 per 
patient), whereas a TSA as initial treatment resulted in USD 125,500,000 
associated direct reimbursements (USD 23,700 per patient).
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of end-stage glenohumeral arthritis refractory to 
conservative treatment in patients 30 to 50 years old in the United States with 
TSA, instead of hemiarthroplasty, would result in greater cost savings, avoid a 
substantial number of revision procedures, and result in greater years of 
satisfactory or excellent patient outcomes and greater QALYs gained. On a 
population level, TSA is the cost-effective treatment for glenohumeral arthritis 
in patients 30 to 50 years old.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, economic and decision analysis study.

BACKGROUND: New regulations by the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary 
Office provide for the monitoring of breed health by Swiss breeding clubs. In 
collaboration with the Swiss Bernese Mountain Dog Club, the purpose of this 
study was to investigate the causes of death in purebred dogs registered by the 
club and born in 2001 and 2002.
RESULTS: Of a total of 1290 Bernese mountain dogs (BMDs) born in 2001 and 2002 
in Switzerland, data was collected from owners and veterinarians using a 
questionnaire designed for this study from 389 dogs (30.2 %). By the end of the 
study, 381/389 dogs (97.9 %) had died. The median life expectancy of all dogs 
was 8.4 years (IQR, 6.9-9.7). Female dogs had a significantly longer median 
survival (8.8 years; IQR, 7.1-10.3) than male dogs (7.7 years; IQR, 6.6-9.3) 
(P < 0.00). The cause of death was unknown in 89/381 dogs (23.4 %). For the 
remaining dogs, the most frequent causes of death were neoplasia (222/381, 
58.3 %), degenerative joint disease (16/381, 4.2 %), spinal disorders (13/381, 
3.4 %), renal injury (12/381, 3.1 %), and gastric or mesenteric volvulus (7/381, 
1.8 %). However, large numbers of dogs were diagnosed with neoplasia without 
histopathologic or cytologic confirmation. Dogs with neoplasms had a shorter 
median survival than dogs with other disorders. The shortest median survival 
(6.8 years) was found for dogs with renal injury.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study confirm a high prevalence of neoplasia and 
associated low life expectancy in BMDs. The results underline a need for more 
widespread precise diagnostics and further research on malignant tumours in this 
breed to improve overall breed health.

When is Transplantation with a "Marginal Kidney" Justifiable?

Rouchi AH(1), Mahdavi-Mazdeh M(1).

Author information:

Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

The ability of kidney transplantation to improve quality of life has made this 
therapeutic modality the treatment of choice among renal replacement therapies; 
however, the continuing organ shortage has forced the use of marginal kidneys as 
a supplementary source of allografts. It has been repeatedly suggested that 
failed kidney transplant recipients have greater morbidity and mortality 
compared with dialysis patients with no renal transplant history. Achieving an 
optimal balance between the advantages of kidney transplant and disadvantages of 
allografts with marginal quality is a topic of controversy in transplant 
medicine. The major and potentially life-threatening complications of 
immunosuppressive therapies and shorter lifespan following graft failure 
necessitate a reappraisal of kidney transplant programs from expanded-criteria 
deceased donors, which can neither necessarily give dialysis patients a better 
quality of life nor a significant survival benefit, especially in settings with 
additional diminished graft survival due to HLA-mismatch. It should be offered 
just to those with short life expectancy and with HLA-matching. The last item is 
very important in countries without mandatory HLA-matching protocols for kidney 
transplantation programs.

Genetic manipulations in nutrient-sensing pathways are known to both extend 
lifespan and modify responses to environmental stressors (e.g., starvation, 
oxidative and thermal stresses), suggesting that similar mechanisms regulate 
lifespan and stress resistance. However, despite being a key factor reducing 
female lifespan and affecting female fitness, male-induced harm has rarely been 
considered as a stressor mediated by nutrient sensing pathways. We explored 
whether a lifespan-extending manipulation also modifies female resistance to 
male-induced harm. To do so, we used long-lived female Drosophila melanogaster 
that had their insulin signalling pathway downregulated by genetically ablating 
the median neurosecretory cells (mNSC). We varied the level of exposure to males 
for control and ablated females and tested for interacting effects on female 
lifespan and fitness. As expected, we found that lifespan significantly declined 
with exposure to males. However, mNSC-ablated females maintained significantly 
increased lifespan across all male exposure treatments. Furthermore, lifespan 
extension and relative fitness of mNSC-ablated females were maximized under 
intermediate exposure to males, and minimized under low and high exposure to 
males. Overall, our results suggest that wild-type levels of insulin signalling 
reduce female susceptibility to male-induced harm under intense sexual conflict, 
and may also protect females when mating opportunities are sub-optimally low.

A leading hypothesis proposes that increased human life span since 1850 has 
resulted from decreased exposure to childhood infections, which has reduced 
chronic inflammation and later-life mortality rates, particularly from 
cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer. Early-life cohort mortality rate 
often predicts later-life survival in humans, but such associations could arise 
from factors other than disease exposure. Additionally, the impact of early-life 
disease exposure on reproduction remains unknown, and thus previous work ignores 
a major component of fitness through which selection acts upon life-history 
strategy. We collected data from seven 18th- and 19th-century Finnish 
populations experiencing naturally varying mortality and fertility levels. We 
quantified early-life disease exposure as the detrended child mortality rate 
from infectious diseases during an individual's first 5 y, controlling for 
important social factors. We found no support for an association between 
early-life disease exposure and all-cause mortality risk after age 15 or 50. We 
also found no link between early-life disease exposure and probability of death 
specifically from cardiovascular disease, stroke, or cancer. Independent of 
survival, there was no evidence to support associations between early-life 
disease exposure and any of several aspects of reproductive performance, 
including lifetime reproductive success and age at first birth, in either males 
or females. Our results do not support the prevailing assertion that exposure to 
infectious diseases in early life has long-lasting associations with later-life 
all-cause mortality risk or mortality putatively linked to chronic inflammation. 
Variation in adulthood conditions could therefore be the most likely source of 
recent increases in adult life span.

BACKGROUND: Dance is an embodied activity with benefits for mobility, balance, 
and quality of life (QoL) of persons affected by Parkinson's Disease (PD). It is 
enjoyable and likely to support adherence to movement prescriptions. The 
objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of measuring changes in 
psychological outcomes, specifically well-being, body self-efficacy, outcome 
expectations, and experienced beauty after a single Argentine Tango intervention 
in a workshop format. To anchor experienced beauty in a theory, the article 
introduces a model of embodied aesthetics featuring active art-making as a 
central aspect of healing in arts-based interventions.
METHODS: In a single-group pre-post design, we tested the feasibility of 
measuring psychological changes of 34 PD patients from Southern Germany after an 
introductory workshop in Argentine Tango. They participated in a 90 min Tango 
for PD intervention and completed the Heidelberg State Inventory (HSI-24; (Koch 
et al., 2007)), the Body Self-Efficacy Scale (BSE; (Fuchs and Koch, 2014)) with 
a sub-dimension on aesthetic experience, and the Credibility-Expectancy 
Questionnaire (CEQ; (Devilly and Borkovec, 2000)) before and after the 
intervention. A subgroup completed the therapeutic factors of arts 
therapies-scale, a new measure to elaborate on the aesthetic experience. We 
analyzed pre-post-differences with a t-test for paired samples.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The study supports the feasibility of measuring 
health-related psychological changes from a single Argentine Tango intervention 
for PD patients, as well as acceptance and appropriateness of the intervention 
for the patient group. After the tango intervention, well-being, body 
self-efficacy, and outcome expectancies increased. Participants also experienced 
an increase in beauty of their movements and other aesthetic aspects. We suspect 
that, in addition to the functional and psychological factors identified so far, 
the aesthetic experience in dance may be an important therapeutic factor 
mediating several outcomes of dance and other arts-based interventions. A 
controlled study for evidence-based testing of targeted variables can now follow 
to examine the new hypotheses.

INTRODUCTION: Several studies have suggested that anterior cruciate ligament 
reconstruction (ACLR) without wound drainage has no impact on long-term 
follow-up.
AIM: To investigate a prospective patient series as measured by the 
patient-administered disease-specific questionnaire Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 101 consecutive patients (71 men and 30 
women) with a mean age of 30 years (SD 10, range: 15-62 years), who had 
undergone primary single incision arthroscopic bone-patellar tendon-bone 
autograft (BPTB) ACLR without wound drainage. All patients completed KOOS 
questionnaires, preoperatively and at a mean follow-up of 1.4 years (range: 
0.4-3.4). Satisfactory clinical outcome (function recovery - FR) was defined as 
the lower threshold for the 95% CI of 18-34-year old males and corresponded to a 
KOOS score > 90 for Pain, 84 for Symptoms, 91 for Activities of Daily Living 
(ADL), 80 for Sports/Recreation, and 81 for Quality of Life (QOL). A 
non-satisfactory result was defined as treatment failure (TF) and corresponded 
to a QOL score < 44.
RESULTS: All patients achieved 90° of knee flexion on the first postoperative 
day and full extension 2 weeks postoperatively. A full range of motion was 
achieved in less than 6 weeks postoperatively. No postoperative complications 
were reported. Score improvement at follow-up was observed in the KOOS subscales 
Pain, Symptoms and ADL. Criteria for FR were fulfilled by 52% of patients for 
Pain, 47% for Symptoms, 62% for ADL, 34% for Sports/Recreation and 15% for QOL, 
whereas criteria for TF were fulfilled by 29% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that the primary ACLRs without wound 
drainage did not have any negative impact for patient-reported recovery.

Background: Headaches are prevalent among Service members with traumatic brain 
injury (TBI); 80% report chronic or recurrent headache. Evidence for 
nonpharmacologic treatments, such as acupuncture, are needed. Objective: The aim 
of this research was to determine if two types of acupuncture (auricular 
acupuncture [AA] and traditional Chinese acupuncture [TCA]) were feasible and 
more effective than usual care (UC) alone for TBI-related headache. Materials 
and Methods:Design: This was a three-armed, parallel, randomized exploratory 
study. Setting: The research took place at three military treatment facilities 
in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. Patients: The subjects were previously 
deployed Service members (18-69 years old) with mild-to-moderate TBI and 
headaches. Intervention: The interventions explored were UC alone or with the 
addition of AA or TCA. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was the Headache 
Impact Test (HIT). Secondary outcomes were the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist, Symptom 
Checklist-90-R, Medical Outcome Study Quality of Life (QoL), Beck Depression 
Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Automated Neuropsychological 
Assessment Metrics, and expectancy of outcome and acupuncture efficacy. Results: 
Mean HIT scores decreased in the AA and TCA groups but increased slightly in the 
UC-only group from baseline to week 6 [AA, -10.2% (-6.4 points); TCA, -4.6% 
(-2.9 points); UC, +0.8% (+0.6 points)]. Both acupuncture groups had sizable 
decreases in NRS (Pain Best), compared to UC (TCA versus UC: P = 0.0008, 
d = 1.70; AA versus UC: P = 0.0127, d = 1.6). No statistically significant 
results were found for any other secondary outcome measures. Conclusions: Both 
AA and TCA improved headache-related QoL more than UC did in Service members 
with TBI.

BACKGROUND: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and concomitant treatment 
can be implemented in several ways. The authors investigated how the net benefit 
of PSA screening varies between common practice versus "good practice."
METHODS: Microsimulation screening analysis (MISCAN) was used to evaluate the 
effect on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) if 4 recommendations were 
followed: limited screening in older men, selective biopsy in men with elevated 
PSA, active surveillance for low-risk tumors, and treatment preferentially 
delivered at high-volume centers. Outcomes were compared with a base model in 
which annual screening started at ages 55 to 69 years and were simulated using 
data from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.
RESULTS: In terms of QALYs gained compared with no screening, for 1000 screened 
men who were followed over their lifetime, recommended good practice led to 73 
life-years (LYs) and 74 QALYs gained compared with 73 LYs and 56 QALYs for the 
base model. In contrast, common practice led to 78 LYs gained but only 19 QALYs 
gained, for a greater than 75% relative reduction in QALYs gained from 
unadjusted LYs gained. The poor outcomes for common practice were influenced 
predominantly by the use of aggressive treatment for men with low-risk disease, 
and PSA testing in older men also strongly reduced potential QALY gains.
CONCLUSIONS: Commonly used PSA screening and treatment practices are associated 
with little net benefit. Following a few straightforward clinical 
recommendations, particularly greater use of active surveillance for low-risk 
disease and reducing screening in older men, would lead to an almost 4-fold 
increase in the net benefit of prostate cancer screening. Cancer

Refrigerated storage of platelets initiates changes in platelet surface marker 
expression and localization of intracellular proteins.

BACKGROUND: Platelets (PLTs) are currently stored at room temperature (22°C), 
which limits their shelf life, primarily due to the risk of bacterial growth. 
Alternatives to room temperature storage include PLT refrigeration (2-6°C), 
which inhibits bacterial growth, thus potentially allowing an extension of shelf 
life. Additionally, refrigerated PLTs appear more hemostatically active than 
conventional PLTs, which may be beneficial in certain clinical situations. 
However, the mechanisms responsible for this hemostatic function are not well 
characterized. The aim of this study was to assess the protein profile of 
refrigerated PLTs in an effort to understand these functional consequences.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Buffy coat PLTs were pooled, split, and stored either 
at room temperature (20-24°C) or under refrigerated (2-6°C) conditions (n = 8 in 
each group). PLTs were assessed for changes in external receptor expression and 
actin filamentation using flow cytometry. Intracellular proteomic changes were 
assessed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blotting.
RESULTS: PLT refrigeration significantly reduced the abundance of glycoproteins 
(GPIb, GPIX, GPIIb, and GPIV) on the external membrane. However, refrigeration 
resulted in the increased expression of high-affinity integrins (αIIbβ3 and β1) 
and activation and apoptosis markers (CD62P, CD63, and phosphatidylserine). PLT 
refrigeration substantially altered the abundance and localization of several 
cytoskeletal proteins and resulted in an increase in actin filamentation, as 
measured by phalloidin staining.
CONCLUSION: Refrigerated storage of PLTs induces significant changes in the 
expression and localization of both surface-expressed and intracellular 
proteins. Understanding these proteomic changes may help to identify the 
mechanisms resulting in the refrigeration-associated alterations in PLT function 
and clearance.

BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal neurodegenerative 
disease with death on average within 2-3 years of symptom onset. Mutations in 
superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) have been identified to cause ALS. Riluzole, the 
only neuroprotective drug for ALS provides life extension of only 3 months on 
average. Thishighlights the need for compound screening in disease models to 
identify new neuroprotective therapies for this disease. Zebrafish is an 
emerging model system that is well suited for the study of 
diseasepathophysiology and also for high throughput (HT) drug screening. The 
mutant sod1 zebrafish model of ALS mimics the hallmark features of ALS. Using a 
fluorescence based readout of neuronal stress, we developed a high throughput 
(HT) screen to identify neuroprotective compounds.
RESULTS: Here we show that the zebrafish screen is a robust system that can be 
used to rapidly screen thousands ofcompounds and also demonstrate that riluzole 
is capable of reducing neuronal stress in this model system. The screen shows 
optimal quality control, maintaining a high sensitivity and specificity 
withoutcompromising throughput. Most importantly, we demonstrate that many 
compounds previously failed in human clinical trials, showed no stress reducing 
activity in the zebrafish assay.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that HT drug screening using a mutant sod1 zebrafish is 
a reliable model system which supplemented with secondary assays would be useful 
in identifying drugs with potential for neuroprotective efficacy in ALS.

BACKGROUND: Estimated medical costs ("T") and QALYs ("Q") associated with 
smoking are frequently used in cost-utility analyses of tobacco control 
interventions. The goal of this study was to understand how researchers have 
addressed the methodological challenges involved in estimating these parameters.
METHODS: Data were collected as part of a systematic review of tobacco modeling 
studies. We searched five electronic databases on July 1, 2013 with no date 
restrictions and synthesized studies qualitatively. Studies were eligible for 
the current analysis if they were U.S.-based, provided an estimate for Q, and 
used a societal perspective and lifetime analytic horizon to estimate T. We 
identified common methods and frequently cited sources used to obtain these 
estimates.
RESULTS: Across all 18 studies included in this review, 50 % cited a 1992 source 
to estimate the medical costs associated with smoking and 56 % cited a 1996 
study to derive the estimate for QALYs saved by quitting or preventing smoking. 
Approaches for estimating T varied dramatically among the studies included in 
this review. T was valued as a positive number, negative number and $0; five 
studies did not include estimates for T in their analyses. The most commonly 
cited source for Q based its estimate on the Health Utilities Index (HUI). 
Several papers also cited sources that based their estimates for Q on the 
Quality of Well-Being Scale and the EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire 
(EQ-5D).
CONCLUSIONS: Current estimates of the lifetime medical care costs and the QALYs 
associated with smoking are dated and do not reflect the latest evidence on the 
health effects of smoking, nor the current costs and benefits of smoking 
cessation and prevention. Given these limitations, we recommend that researchers 
conducting economic evaluations of tobacco control interventions perform 
extensive sensitivity analyses around these parameter estimates.
