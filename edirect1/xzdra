revolution and sustainable development goals. Using qualitative content 
analysis, the results indicated that artificial intelligence and machine 
learning played an important role in the response to the challenges posed by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and various 
digital communication tools through telehealth performed meaningful roles in 
scaling customer communications, provided a platform for understanding how 
COVID-19 spreads, and sped up research and treatment of COVID-19, among other 
notable achievements. The lessons we draw from this is that, despite the 
disruptions and the rise in the number of unintended consequences of technology 
in the fourth industrial revolution, the role played by artificial intelligence 
and machine learning motivates us to conclude that governments must build trust 
in these technologies, to address health problems going forward, to ensure that 
the sustainable development goals related to good health and wellbeing are 
achieved.

The infection of CD4 T-lymphocytes with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the 
etiological agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), disrupts 
cellular homeostasis, increases oxidative stress and interferes with 
micronutrient metabolism. Viral replication simultaneously increases the demand 
for micronutrients and causes their loss, as for selenium (Se). In HIV-infected 
patients, selenium deficiency was associated with a lower CD4 T-cell count and a 
shorter life expectancy. Selenium has an important role in antioxidant defense, 
redox signaling and redox homeostasis, and most of these biological activities 
are mediated by its incorporation in an essential family of redox enzymes, 
namely the selenoproteins. Here, we have investigated how selenium and 
selenoproteins interplay with HIV infection in different cellular models of 
human CD4 T lymphocytes derived from established cell lines (Jurkat and SupT1) 
and isolated primary CD4 T cells. First, we characterized the expression of the 
selenoproteome in various human T-cell models and found it tightly regulated by 
the selenium level of the culture media, which was in agreement with reports 
from non-immune cells. Then, we showed that selenium had no significant effect 
on HIV-1 protein production nor on infectivity, but slightly reduced the 
percentage of infected cells in a Jurkat cell line and isolated primary CD4 T 
cells. Finally, in response to HIV-1 infection, the selenoproteome was slightly 
altered.

Aging is a complex process indicated by low energy levels, declined 
physiological activity, stress induced loss of homeostasis leading to the risk 
of diseases and mortality. Recent developments in medical sciences and an 
increased availability of nutritional requirements has significantly increased 
the average human lifespan worldwide. Several environmental and physiological 
factors contribute to the aging process. However, about 40% human life 
expectancy is inherited among generations, many lifespan associated genes, 
genetic mechanisms and pathways have been demonstrated during last decades. In 
the present review, we have evaluated many human genes and their non-human 
orthologs established for their role in the regulation of lifespan. The study 
has included more than fifty genes reported in the literature for their 
contributions to the longevity of life. Intact genomic DNA is essential for the 
life activities at the level of cell, tissue, and organ. Nucleic acids are 
vulnerable to oxidative stress, chemotherapies, and exposure to radiations. 
Efficient DNA repair mechanisms are essential for the maintenance of genomic 
integrity, damaged DNA is not replicated and transferred to next generations 
rather the presence of deleterious DNA initiates signaling cascades leading to 
the cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. DNA modifications, DNA methylation, histone 
methylation, histone acetylation and DNA damage can eventually lead towards 
apoptosis. The importance of calorie restriction therapy in the extension of 
lifespan has also been discussed. The role of pathways involved in the 
regulation of lifespan such as DAF-16/FOXO (forkhead box protein O1), TOR and 
JNK pathways has also been particularized. The study provides an updated account 
of genetic factors associated with the extended lifespan and their interactive 
contributory role with cellular pathways.

Artificial pigmentation of apple fruits has been intensely evaluated to generate 
less pigmented red apples, which are profitable because of the changes in fruit 
quality. In this study, we analyzed the diversity of flavonoids and the patterns 
of flavonoid metabolic gene expression under light irradiation with or without 
methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment in immature (S1) and color-turning (S2) staged 
'Fuji' apples. Further, we assessed the metabolic regulation at the gene level 
between anthocyanin and flavonol in light-responsive apple skins. UV-B exposure 
within 3 days was found to significantly stimulate anthocyanin accumulation in 
apple skin compared to other light exposure. S1 skin was more sensitive to UV-B 
and MeJA treatment, in the aspect of indaein accumulation. The enhancement of 
apple pigmentation following treatment with adequate levels of UV-B and MeJA was 
maximized at approximately 72 h. Red (range from 4.25 to 17.96 µg·g-1 DW), blue 
(range from 4.59 to 9.17 µg·g-1 DW) and UV-A (range from 3.98 to 19.12 µg·g-1 
DW) lights contributed to the induction of idaein content. Most genes related to 
the flavonoid pathways increased their expression under UV-B exposure, including 
the gene expression of the transcription factor, MdMYB10, a well-known upstream 
factor of flavonoid biosynthesis in apples. The boosted upregulation of MdMYB10, 
MdCHS, MdF3H MdLDOX, and MdUFGT genes due to MeJA in UV-B was found and may 
contribute the increase of idaein. UV-A and UV-B caused higher quercetin 
glycoside content in both S1 and S2 apple skins than longer wavelengths, 
resulting in significant increases in quercetin-3-O-galactoside and 
quercetin-3-O-glucoside. These results suggest that the application of adequate 
UV-B with MeJA in less-pigmented postharvest apples will improve apple color 
quality within a short period.

Chronological age, in conjunction with population life tables, is widely used 
for estimating future life expectancy. The aims of this study are to estimate a 
subjective ageing indicator, namely self-rated age, and to evaluate its 
concurrent validity in comparison with other age indicators: subjective survival 
probabilities, subjective age, and biological age. We use data from the Wave 6 
of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, Wave 12 of the Health 
and Retirement Study in the United States, and life tables from the Human 
Mortality Database. For the statistical analysis we use multinomial regression 
models. Our results indicate that health status and frequency of physical 
activities imply similar patterns of self- rated age, subjective survival 
probabilities, subjective age, and biological age. However, the impact of 
cognitive function differs by geographical region. Self-rated age can be 
interpreted as a subjective adjustment that better reflects the ageing process.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death 
in France (17,712 annual deaths). However, this cancer is preventable in the 
majority of cases by the early detection of adenomas. In France, the organized 
screening for CRC relies on general practitioners (GPs). The tests delivered by 
the GPs are carried out in 89% of cases. However, GPs do not systematically 
offer the test, because of time management and communication.
METHODS: AmDepCCR is a cluster randomized trial. Patients are prospectively 
included by their GPs. The study is designed in 2 phases for the GPs: first, GPs 
who have never participated in motivational interviewing (MI) training will be 
recruited then randomly split in 2 groups. Secondly, a 6-day motivational 
interviewing training will be carried out for the intervention group. Then, 
patients will be included in both groups during a period of 1 year. The primary 
outcome will be the number of CRC screenings achieved in each group and its 
difference. The secondary outcome will be the reluctance to screening and the 
patient's self-estimated life expectancy at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months using the 
Health Belief Model (HBM).
DISCUSSION: This study will help to know if GPs motivational interviewing is 
useful to improve organized CRC screening. In addition, it may help to improve 
communication between patients and GPs. GPs will be able to improve their 
practice in other fields of application through motivational interviewing (other 
screenings, addictions…).

BACKGROUND: Oral semaglutide is a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog 
that has been associated with improvements in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and 
body weight versus sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor empagliflozin and 
injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist dulaglutide in the PIONEER 2 clinical trial 
and in a recent network meta-analysis (NMA), respectively. The aim of the 
present study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of oral 
semaglutide 14 mg versus empagliflozin 25 mg and dulaglutide 1.5 mg for the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes from a healthcare payer perspective in Portugal.
METHODS: In two separate analyses, outcomes were projected over patients' 
lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (v9.0), discounted at 4% per 
annum. Clinical data were sourced from the PIONEER 2 trial and the NMA for the 
comparisons versus empagliflozin and dulaglutide, respectively. Patients were 
assumed to receive initial therapies until HbA1c exceeded 7.5%, then 
treatment-intensified to solely basal insulin therapy. Costs were accounted from 
a National Healthcare Service perspective in Portugal and expressed in 2021 
euros (EUR). Utilities were taken from published sources.
RESULTS: Oral semaglutide 14 mg was associated with improvements in life 
expectancy of 0.10 and 0.03 years, and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.11 
and 0.03 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), versus empagliflozin 25 mg and 
dulaglutide 1.5 mg, respectively. Improved clinical outcomes were due to a 
reduced cumulative incidence and increased time to onset of diabetes-related 
complications with oral semaglutide. Total costs were projected to be EUR 2548 
and EUR 814 higher with oral semaglutide versus empagliflozin and dulaglutide, 
with higher acquisition costs partially offset by cost savings from avoidance of 
diabetes-related complications. Oral semaglutide 14 mg was therefore associated 
with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of EUR 23,571 and EUR 23,927 per QALY 
gained versus empagliflozin 25 mg and dulaglutide 1.5 mg, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 30,000 per QALY 
gained, oral semaglutide 14 mg was considered cost-effective versus 
empagliflozin 25 mg and dulaglutide 1.5 mg for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
in Portugal.

INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy (LE) depends on the wider determinants of health, 
which have different impact in women and men. Therefore, this study aimed to 
investigate whether gender equality was correlated with LE in women and men.
METHODS: Gender equality in the 27 European Union (EU) member states between 
2010 and 2019 was estimated using a modified Gender Equality Index (mGEI), based 
on the index developed by the European Institute for Gender Equality. The 
correlation between this mGEI and LE and the gender gap in LE was calculated 
using the Spearman correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2019, LE increased more for men than women, which 
resulted in a narrowing of the gender gap in LE in the EU. During the same 
period, there was an increase in gender equality, as measured by the mGEI, 
although with substantial heterogeneity between countries. There was a strong 
correlation between the mGEI and the gender gap in LE (-0.880), which was 
explained by a stronger correlation between the mGEI and longer LE in men than 
in women (0.655 vs 0.629, respectively). The domains of the mGEI most strongly 
associated with a narrowing of the gender gap in LE were health, money and 
knowledge, while power was the domain with the weakest association.
CONCLUSIONS: Gender equality appears to be at least as beneficial to men as 
women with regard to LE, thus reinforcing the key role gender equality plays in 
improving population health and longevity.

Environmental exposure to active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) can have 
negative effects on the health of ecosystems and humans. While numerous studies 
have monitored APIs in rivers, these employ different analytical methods, 
measure different APIs, and have ignored many of the countries of the world. 
This makes it difficult to quantify the scale of the problem from a global 
perspective. Furthermore, comparison of the existing data, generated for 
different studies/regions/continents, is challenging due to the vast differences 
between the analytical methodologies employed. Here, we present a global-scale 
study of API pollution in 258 of the world's rivers, representing the 
environmental influence of 471.4 million people across 137 geographic regions. 
Samples were obtained from 1,052 locations in 104 countries (representing all 
continents and 36 countries not previously studied for API contamination) and 
analyzed for 61 APIs. Highest cumulative API concentrations were observed in 
sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, and South America. The most contaminated sites 
were in low- to middle-income countries and were associated with areas with poor 
wastewater and waste management infrastructure and pharmaceutical manufacturing. 
The most frequently detected APIs were carbamazepine, metformin, and caffeine (a 
compound also arising from lifestyle use), which were detected at over half of 
the sites monitored. Concentrations of at least one API at 25.7% of the sampling 
sites were greater than concentrations considered safe for aquatic organisms, or 
which are of concern in terms of selection for antimicrobial resistance. 
Therefore, pharmaceutical pollution poses a global threat to environmental and 
human health, as well as to delivery of the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals.

COVID-19 has affected all countries. Its containment represents a unique 
challenge for India due to a large population (> 1.38 billion) across a wide 
range of population densities. Assessment of the COVID-19 disease burden is 
required to put the disease impact into context and support future pandemic 
policy development. Here, we present the national-level burden of COVID-19 in 
India in 2020 that accounts for differences across urban and rural regions and 
across age groups. Input data were collected from official records or published 
literature. The proportion of excess COVID-19 deaths was estimated using the 
Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Washington data. 
Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) due to COVID-19 were estimated in the 
Indian population in 2020, comprised of years of life lost (YLL) and years lived 
with disability (YLD). YLL was estimated by multiplying the number of deaths due 
to COVID-19 by the residual standard life expectancy at the age of death due to 
the disease. YLD was calculated as a product of the number of incident cases of 
COVID-19, disease duration and disability weight. Scenario analyses were 
conducted to account for excess deaths not recorded in the official data and for 
reported COVID-19 deaths. The direct impact of COVID-19 in 2020 in India was 
responsible for 14,100,422 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 14,030,129-14,213,231) 
DALYs, consisting of 99.2% (95% UI 98.47-99.64%) YLLs and 0.80% (95% UI 
0.36-1.53) YLDs. DALYs were higher in urban (56%; 95% UI 56-57%) than rural 
areas (44%; 95% UI 43.4-43.6) and in men (64%) than women (36%). In absolute 
terms, the highest DALYs occurred in the 51-60-year-old age group (28%) but the 
highest DALYs per 100,000 persons were estimated for the 71-80 years old age 
group (5481; 95% UI 5464-5500 years). There were 4,815,908 (95% UI 
4,760,908-4,924,307) DALYs after considering reported COVID-19 deaths only. The 
DALY estimations have direct and immediate implications not only for public 
policy in India, but also internationally given that India represents one sixth 
of the world's population.

Retirement ages are rising in many countries to offset the challenges of 
population ageing, but osteoarthritis is an age-associated disease that is 
becoming more prevalent and may limit capacity to work until older ages. We 
aimed to assess the impact of osteoarthritis on healthy working life expectancy 
(HWLE) by comparing HWLE for people with and without osteoarthritis from ages 50 
and 65 nationally and in a local area in England. Mortality-linked data for 
adults aged ≥ 50 years were used from six waves (2002-13) of the English 
Longitudinal Study of Ageing and from three time points of the North 
Staffordshire Osteoarthritis Project. HWLE was defined as the average number of 
years expected to be spent healthy (no limiting long-standing illness) and in 
paid work (employment or self-employment), and was estimated for people with and 
without osteoarthritis and by sex and occupation type using interpolated Markov 
chain multi-state modelling. HWLE from age 50 years was a third lower for people 
with osteoarthritis compared to people without osteoarthritis both nationally 
(5.68 95% CI [5.29, 6.07] years compared to 10.00 [9.74, 10.26]) and in North 
Staffordshire (4.31 [3.68, 4.94] years compared to 6.90 [6.57, 7.24]). HWLE from 
age 65 years for self-employed people with osteoarthritis exceeded HWLE for 
people without osteoarthritis in manual or non-manual occupations. 
Osteoarthritis was associated with a significantly shorter HWLE. People with 
osteoarthritis are likely to have significantly impaired working ability and 
capacity to work until older ages, especially in regions with poorer health and 
work outcomes.

Management of Chronic Portal Vein Thrombosis in a Cirrhotic Patient With 
Pancytopenia and Grade II Esophageal Varices.

Chronic portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a major vascular complication of liver 
cirrhosis. Patients may be asymptomatic and chronic PVT might be detected 
incidentally on imaging. PVT is associated with worsening liver disease, poorer 
clinical outcomes, and might proceed to life-threatening intestinal ischemia. 
Management of chronic PVT with anticoagulation has been shown to be successful 
in promoting recanalization and reducing thrombus extension in patients with 
cirrhosis. However, optimal anticoagulation for PVT in cirrhosis has not yet 
been addressed in any large-scale trial, and the decision to anti-coagulate 
varies on a case by case presentation. We report the case of a 62-year-old male 
patient with a history of liver cirrhosis, pancytopenia, and grade II esophageal 
varices presenting with abdominal pain who was incidentally found to have 
chronic thrombosis of the portal vein on imaging and was managed appropriately 
with a good outcome.

Yttrium-90 (Y-90) resin microsphere therapy for patients with unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Identification of successful treatment response 
predictors and patient selection.

Arslan N, Ince S, Okuyucu K, San H, Alagoz E, Karadurmus N, Karaman B, Ercin CN.

AIM: Selective intraarterial radionuclide therapy (SIRT) with Yttrium-90 (Y-90) 
resin microspheres has been applied for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lately. 
The aim of this study is to present our clinical experience of radiomicrosphere 
therapy in the treatment of unresectable HCC and determine the proper cases who 
could benefit from this therapy according to response results yielded by initial 
staging and control imaging modalities.
METHODS: We administered 43 Y-90 microsphere therapy to 34 patients with 
unresectable HCC (twice in 9 patients). Patients with histopathologically 
confirmed HCC having a life expectancy of ≥3 months; Child A-B, Okuda stage 1-2 
and BCLC stage A-B-C classifications were included in the study. The patients 
were divided into two groups: Group A consisted of 29 patients who responded to 
Y-90 therapy (complete response, partial response and stable disease), Group B 5 
of non-responders (progressive disease). Predefined parameters were evaluated 
for response to SIRT and compared between two groups.
RESULTS: We found a significant decrease in platelet and lymphocyte counts one 
month after therapy (p=0.02, p=0.01, respectively). On control imaging tests 
performed 3 months later, we observed complete response in 19% (n=6), partial 
response in 44% (n=15), stable disease in 25% (n=8) and progressive diease in 
12% (n=5) of the patients. Mean overall survival (OS) was 19 (median value: 14) 
months.
CONCLUSIONS: Y-90 microsphere therapy is a safe and effective treatment option 
for the patients with unresectable HCC without any serious side effect. Mean 
tumor dose delivery and lack of bilobar disease seem the best predictors for 
treatment success.

Publisher: La terapia selettiva con radionuclidi intraarteriosi (SIRT) con 
microsfere di resina di ittrio-90 (Y-90)   stata applicata recentemente per il 
carcinoma epatocellulare (HCC). Lo scopo di questo studio   presentare il nostro 
studio della terapia con radiomicrosfera nel trattamento dell’HCC non resecabile 
e determinare i casi appropriati che potrebbero trarre beneficio da questa 
terapia in base ai risultati di risposta forniti dallo stadio iniziale e dalle 
modalit  di controllo per immagini. METODI: abbiamo somministrato 43 terapie con 
microsfere Y-90 a 34 pazienti con HCC non resecabile (due volte in 9 pazienti). 
I pazienti con HCC confermato dal punto di vista istopatologico con 
un’aspettativa di vita di ≥3 mesi; classificazioni Child AB, Classificazione 
Okuda 1-2 e stadiazione BCLC ABC sono state incluse nello studio. I pazienti 
sono stati divisi in due gruppi: il gruppo A era composto da 29 pazienti che 
hanno risposto alla terapia con Y-90 (risposta completa, risposta parziale e 
malattia stabile), il gruppo B 5 non davano nessuna risposta (malattia 
progressiva). I parametri predefiniti sono stati valutati per la risposta alla 
SIRT e confrontati tra i due gruppi. RISULTATI: abbiamo riscontrato una 
significativa diminuzione del numero di piastrine e dei linfociti un mese dopo 
la terapia (p = 0,02, p = 0,01, rispettivamente). Nei test di controllo per 
immagini eseguiti 3 mesi dopo, abbiamo osservato una risposta completa nel 19% 
(n = 6), una risposta parziale nel 44% (n = 15), una malattia stabile nel 25% (n 
= 8) e una malattia progressiva nel 12% ( n = 5) dei pazienti. La sopravvivenza 
globale media (OS)   stata di 19 (valore mediano: 14) mesi. CONCLUSIONI: la 
terapia con microsfere Y-90   un’opzione di trattamento sicura ed efficace per i 
pazienti con HCC non resecabile senza alcun effetto collaterale grave. Tumore di 
piccole dimensioni e mancanza di assenza di localizzazione bilobare sembrano le 
migliori condizioni per il successo del trattamento.

As life expectancy continues to increase, clinicians are challenged by 
age-related renal impairment that involves podocyte senescence and 
glomerulosclerosis. There is now compelling evidence that lithium has a potent 
antiaging activity that ameliorates brain aging and increases longevity in 
Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans. As the major molecular target of lithium 
action and a multitasking protein kinase recently implicated in a variety of 
renal diseases, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is overexpressed and 
hyperactive with age in glomerular podocytes, correlating with functional and 
histological signs of kidney aging. Moreover, podocyte-specific ablation of 
GSK3β substantially attenuated podocyte senescence and glomerular aging in mice. 
Mechanistically, key mediators of senescence signaling, such as p16INK4A and 
p53, contain high numbers of GSK3β consensus motifs, physically interact with 
GSK3β, and act as its putative substrates. In addition, therapeutic targeting of 
GSK3β by microdose lithium later in life reduced senescence signaling and 
delayed kidney aging in mice. Furthermore, in psychiatric patients, lithium 
carbonate therapy inhibited GSK3β activity and mitigated senescence signaling in 
urinary exfoliated podocytes and was associated with preservation of kidney 
function. Thus, GSK3β appears to play a key role in podocyte senescence by 
modulating senescence signaling and may be an actionable senostatic target to 
delay kidney aging.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome with high incidence rates, 
a substantial symptom and treatment burden, and a significant risk of 
readmission within 30 days after hospitalization. The COVID-19 pandemic has 
revealed the significance of using eHealth interventions to follow up on the 
care needs of patients with HF to support self-care, increase quality of life 
(QoL), and reduce readmission rates during the transition between hospital and 
home.
OBJECTIVE: The aims of this review are to summarize research on the content and 
delivery modes of HF posthospitalization eHealth interventions, explore patient 
adherence to the interventions, and examine the effects on the patient outcomes 
of self-care, QoL, and readmissions.
METHODS: A restricted systematic review study design was used. Literature 
searches and reviews followed the (PRISMA-S) Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses literature search extension checklist, and 
the CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for 
studies published between 2015 and 2020. The review process involved 3 groups of 
researchers working in pairs. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to 
assess the included studies' methodological quality. A thematic analysis method 
was used to analyze data extracted from the studies.
RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were examined in this review. The studies were 
published between 2015 and 2019, with 56% (10/18) of them published in the 
United States. Of the 18 studies, 16 (89%) were randomized controlled trials, 
and 14 (78%) recruited patients upon hospital discharge to eHealth interventions 
lasting from 14 days to 12 months. The studies involved structured telephone 
calls, interactive voice response, and telemonitoring and included elements of 
patient education, counseling, social and emotional support, and self-monitoring 
of symptoms and vital signs. Of the 18 studies, 11 (61%) provided information on 
patient adherence, and the adherence levels were 72%-99%. When used for 
posthospitalization follow-up of patients with HF, eHealth interventions can 
positively affect QoL, whereas its impact is less evident for self-care and 
readmissions.
CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that patients with HF should receive prompt 
follow-up after hospitalization and eHealth interventions have the potential to 
improve these patients' QoL. Patient adherence in eHealth follow-up trials shows 
promise for successful future interventions and adherence research. Further 
studies are warranted to examine the effects of eHealth interventions on 
self-care and readmissions among patients with HF.
