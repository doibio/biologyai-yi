In this study, a health risk assessment of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in 
drinking water and food was conducted using disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) in major cities of China. Considering the numerous non-detected values 
found in drinking water samples, a zero-inflated model was employed to obtain a 
more precise NDMA concentration distribution function in drinking water. With 
exogenous chronic daily intake of 1.20 × 10-6 mg/(kg*d), the lifetime cancer 
risk and disability-adjusted life years of NDMA are 4.01 × 10-5 and 5.52 × 10-6 
per person-year (ppy). The disease burden attributable to water sources accounts 
for nearly 9.94% of total exogenous intake. The contribution rate of vegetables 
is the largest, followed by cereals, milk products, fish and shrimp, and meat. 
Taking endogenous sources into consideration, the contribution rates of drinking 
water and food sources decrease to 0.08% and 0.69%. This study provides a 
scientific basis for making policy decisions on NDMA pollution management.

BACKGROUND: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is a promising new 
class of cancer therapy but has a high up-front cost. We evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of CAR-T therapy among pediatric patients with 
relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).
METHODS: We built a microsimulation model for pediatric patients with 
relapsed/refractory B-ALL receiving either CAR-T therapy or standard of care. 
Outcomes included costs, quality of life (health utility), complications, and 
survival. We measured cost-effectiveness with the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER), with ICERs under $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) 
considered cost effective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
used to test model uncertainty.
RESULTS: Compared to standard of care, CAR-T therapy increased overall cost by 
$528 200 and improved effectiveness by 8.18 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of 
$64 600/QALY. The model was sensitive to assumptions about long-term CAR-T 
survival, the complete remission rate of CAR-T patients, and the health utility 
of long-term survivors. The base model assumed a 76.0% one-year survival with 
CAR-T, although if this decreased to 57.8%, then CAR-T was no longer cost 
effective. If the complete remission rate of CAR-T recipients decreased from 81% 
to 56.2%, or if the health utility of disease-free survivors decreased from 0.94 
to 0.66, then CAR-T was no longer cost effective. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis found that CAR-T was cost effective in 94.8% of iterations at a 
willingness to pay of $100 000/QALY.
CONCLUSION: CAR-T therapy may represent a cost-effective option for pediatric 
relapsed/refractory B-ALL, although longer follow-up of CAR-T survivors is 
required to confirm validity of these findings.

The steady rise in life expectancy, modern life style and changing environmental 
conditions are responsible for increasing incidence of cancer. A number of 
chemical drugs have been used for cancer treatment; however the induction of 
genotoxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic effects limits their use. Alternatively, 
plant phytochemicals have been proven effective chemopreventive agents. This 
review illustrates the use of "picrosides" derived from Picrorhiza kurroa for 
the treatment of cancer. We have detailed the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory 
action of picrosides as the key mechanism in reducing oncogenesis. Action of 
picrosides on detoxifying enzymes, cell cyle regulation and induction of signal 
transducers inhibiting apoptosis has also been reviewed. The present review 
highlights the use of picrosides as an important therapeutic agent against 
different types of cancer.

BACKGROUND: Total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) and open reduction-internal fixation 
(ORIF) are 2 viable surgical treatment options for acute, intra-articular distal 
humeral fractures in elderly patients. Whereas recent systematic reviews and 
randomized trials have suggested that TEA and ORIF result in similar functional 
outcome scores, no previous study has assessed the comparative 
cost-effectiveness between TEA and distal humeral ORIF in this specific 
demographic.
METHODS: A Markov model was created with the highest-level data available from 
the literature depicting transitioning health states based on treatment 
strategies. To populate the quality-of-life data points in the model lacking in 
the literature, a survey was conducted of patients at 2 referral institutions 
who underwent TEA or ORIF for acute, intra-articular distal humeral fractures 
via the European Quality of Life, 5 Domains (EQ-5D) questionnaire at least 2 
years postoperatively. Cost data from 2016 for each strategy were used to 
calculate the comparative cost-effectiveness of TEA versus ORIF.
RESULTS: For patients aged 65 years, the total cost of TEA was $19,407 compared 
with $20,669 for ORIF. The effectiveness of TEA and ORIF was 8.17 and 7.72, 
respectively. Overall, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of TEA 
($2375.76/quality-adjusted life-year) was favored more than ORIF 
($2677.26/quality-adjusted life-year).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest TEA is a slightly more cost-effective 
procedure than ORIF for most elderly patients who sustain acute, intra-articular 
distal humeral fractures. Still, the unique limitations, complications, and 
revision rates for each strategy must be carefully weighed for each patient when 
making a decision.

OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a prediction model for short-term mortality 
in Australian men aged ≥45years, using age and self-reported health variables, 
for use when implementing the Australian Clinical Practice Guidelines for 
Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Testing and Early Management of Test-Detected 
Prostate Cancer. Implementation of one of the Guideline recommendations requires 
an estimate of 7-year mortality.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study using questionnaire data linked to mortality 
data.
SETTING: Men aged ≥45years randomly sampled from the general population of New 
South Wales, Australia, participating in the 45 and Up Study.
PARTICIPANTS: 123 697 men who completed the baseline postal questionnaire 
(distributed from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008) and gave informed consent 
for follow-up through linkage of their data to population health databases.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: 12 160 died during follow-up (median=5.9 years). Following 
age-adjustment, self-reported health was the strongest predictor of all-cause 
mortality (C-index: 0.827; 95% CI 0.824 to 0.831). Three prediction models for 
all-cause mortality were validated, with predictors: Model-1: age group and 
self-rated health; Model-2: variables common to the 45 and Up Study and the 
Australian Health Survey and subselected using stepwise regression and Model-3: 
all variables selected using stepwise regression. Final predictions calibrated 
well with observed all-cause mortality rates. The 90th percentile for the 7-year 
mortality risks ranged from 1.92% to 83.94% for ages 45-85 years.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed prediction scores for short-term mortality using age 
and self-reported health measures and validated the scores against national 
mortality rates. Along with age, simple measures such as self-rated health, 
which can be easily obtained without physical examination, were strong 
predictors of all-cause mortality in the 45 and Up Study. Seven-year mortality 
risk estimates from Model-3 suggest that the impact of the mortality risk 
prediction tool on men's decision making would be small in the recommended age 
(50-69 years) for PSA testing, but it may discourage testing at older ages.

BACKGROUND: Passive immunization against RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) is 
given in most western countries (including Israel) to infants of high risk 
groups such as premature babies, and infants with Congenital Heart Disease or 
Congenital Lung Disease. However, immunoprophylaxis costs are extremely high 
($2800-$4200 per infant). Using cost-utility analysis criteria, we evaluate 
whether it is justified to expand, continue or restrict nationwide 
immunoprophylaxis using palivizumab of high risk infants against RSV.
METHODS: Epidemiological, demographic, health service utilisation and economic 
data were integrated from primary (National Hospitalization Data, etc.) and 
secondary data sources (ie: from published articles) into a spread-sheet to 
calculate the cost per averted disability-adjusted life year (DALY) of 
vaccinating various infant risk groups. Costs of intervention included antibody 
plus administration costs. Treatment savings and DALYs averted were estimated 
from applying vaccine efficacy data to relative risks of being hospitalised and 
treated for RSV, including possible long-term sequelae like asthma and wheezing.
RESULTS: For all the groups RSV immunoprophylaxis is clearly not cost effective 
as its cost per averted DALY exceeds the $105,986 guideline representing thrice 
the per capita Gross Domestic Product. Vaccine price would have to fall by 48.1% 
in order to justify vaccinating Congenital Heart Disease or Congenital Lung 
Disease risk groups respectively on pure cost-effectiveness grounds. For 
premature babies of < 29 weeks, 29-32 and 33-36 weeks gestation, decreases of 
36.8%, 54.5% and 83.3% respectively in vaccine price are required.
CONCLUSIONS: Based solely on cost-utility analysis, at current price levels it 
is difficult to justify the current indications for passive vaccination with 
Palivizumab against RSV. However, if the manufacturers would reduce the price by 
54.5% then it would be cost-effective to vaccinate the Congenital Heart Disease 
or Congenital Lung Disease risk groups as well as premature babies born before 
the 33rd week of gestation.

BACKGROUND: There have been no studies on the differences in impingement-free 
angle that result from different combined anteversion (CA) patterns. The aim of 
this study was to find the optimal CA pattern for achieving a favorable 
impingement-free angle, including bony and prosthetic impingement, in total hip 
arthroplasty.
METHODS: We evaluated 100 patients with no hip arthritis. We investigated the 
impingement-free angle (flexion, internal rotation with 90° flexion, extension, 
and external rotation) after changing the stem and cup anteversions to satisfy 
several CA patterns [cup anteversion + stem anteversion = 30°, 40°, 50°, and 
60°; cup anteversion + 0.7 × stem anteversion = 37.3° (:Widmer's theory); and 
cup anteversion + 0.77 × stem anteversion = 43.3° (:Yoshimine's theory)] using 
3-dimensional templating software.
RESULTS: The impingement-free angle changed dramatically among the various CA 
patterns. The optimal CA was changed by various stem anteversion. Only CA: 
Widmer with stem anteversion of 20° satisfied daily-life range of motion (ROM) 
requirements (flexion ≥130°, internal rotation with 90° flexion ≥ 45°, 
extension ≥ 40°, external rotation ≥ 40°).
CONCLUSION: Good impingement-free angle cannot be obtained with single fixed CA. 
Different CA patterns should be used, depending on the differences in the stem 
anteversion. A CA of 30° with 0° ≤ stem anteversion ≤10°; a CA:Widmer with 20° 
of stem anteversion; a CA of 40° or Widmer with 30° of stem anteversion. When 
stem anteversion is ≥40°, CA should be decided by each patient's state. Among 
them, a stem anteversion of 20° with cup anteversion of 23.3° was found to be 
the best CA pattern.

BACKGROUND: Improvements in health care systems worldwide have had notable 
effects on the life expectancy of older individuals. As a result, nonagenarians 
are emerging as a separate age group with distinct health care needs. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), the 
mortality rates, and length of in-hospital stay among nonagenarians.
METHODS: This is a retrospective case-control chart review of patients of age 90 
years and above who were admitted to hospital. Patients with Stage I, II, or III 
chronic kidney disease were included in the analysis. The incidence of AKI was 
determined using data from the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) 
classification. Primary outcome variables included length of in-hospital stay 
and mortality rates.
RESULTS: Of the 253 patients who were included in the study, the mean age was 
91.5 years, 61 of the patients (25.9%) developed AKI, and 41 patients (66.1%) 
were in Stage I AKI according to AKIN criteria. Fifty-seven patients died during 
the study period; 57.9% of those patients had AKI. Hospital stay was longer in 
patients with AKI with a mean length of stay of 8.1 days. Congestive heart 
failure, cancer, and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the main 
risk factors for AKI among those patients.
CONCLUSION: AKI is common in nonagenarians. It was associated with increased 
length of hospital stays and increased risk for mortality.

Throughout life, organisms are subjected to a variety of environmental 
perturbations, including temperature, nutrient conditions, and chemical agents. 
Exposure to external signals induces diverse changes in the physiological 
conditions of organisms. Genetically identical individuals exhibit highly 
phenotypic variations, which suggest that environmental variations among 
individuals can affect their phenotypes in a cumulative and inhomogeneous 
manner. The organismal phenotypes mediated by environmental conditions involve 
development, metabolic pathways, fertility, pathological processes, and even 
lifespan. It is clear that genetic factors influence the lifespan of organisms. 
Likewise, it is now increasingly recognized that environmental factors also have 
a large impact on the regulation of aging. Multiple studies have reported on the 
contribution of epigenetic signatures to the long-lasting phenotypic effects 
induced by environmental signals. Nevertheless, the mechanism of how 
environmental stimuli induce epigenetic changes at specific loci, which 
ultimately elicit phenotypic variations, is still largely unknown. Intriguingly, 
in some cases, the altered phenotypes associated with epigenetic changes could 
be stably passed on to the next generations. In this review, we discuss the 
environmental regulation of organismal viability, that is, longevity and stress 
resistance, and the relationship between this regulation and epigenetic factors, 
focusing on studies in the nematode C. elegans.

AIM: Medication non-adherence influences outcomes of therapies for chronic 
diseases. Allopurinol is a cornerstone therapy for patients with gout; however, 
non-adherence to allopurinol is prevalent in Singapore and limits its 
effectiveness. Between 2008-2010, an adherence-enhancing program was implemented 
at the rheumatology division of a public tertiary hospital. The 
cost-effectiveness of this program has not been fully evaluated. With healthcare 
resources being finite, the value of investing in adherence-enhancing 
interventions should be ascertained. This study aims to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of this adherence-enhancing program to inform optimal 
resource allocation toward better gout management.
METHOD: Adopting a real-world data approach, we utilized patient clinical and 
financial records generated in their course of routine care. Intervention and 
control groups were identified in a standing database and matched on nine risk 
factors through propensity score matching. Cost and effect data were followed 
through 1-2 years. A decision tree was developed in TreeAge using a societal 
perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed 
to assess parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: At an assumed willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 USD ($70 000 SGD) 
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), the intervention had an 85% probability 
of being cost-effective compared to routine care. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $12 866 USD per QALY for the base case and ranged 
from $4 139 to $21 593 USD per QALY in sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: The intervention is cost-effective in the short-term, although its 
long-term cost-effectiveness remains to be evaluated.

Global increases in life expectancy drive increasing demands for bone 
regeneration. The gold standard for surgical bone repair is autografting, which 
enjoys excellent clinical outcomes; however, it possesses significant drawbacks 
including donor site morbidity and limited availability. Although collagen 
sponges delivered with bone morphogenetic protein, type 2 (BMP2) are a common 
alternative or supplement, they do not efficiently retain BMP2, necessitating 
extremely high doses to elicit bone formation. Hence, reports of BMP2 
complications are rising, including cancer promotion and ectopic bone formation, 
the latter inducing complications such as breathing difficulties and neurologic 
impairments. Thus, efforts to exert spatial control over bone formation are 
increasing. Several tissue engineering approaches have demonstrated the 
potential for targeted and controlled bone formation. These approaches include 
biomaterial scaffolds derived from synthetic sources, e.g., calcium phosphates 
or polymers; natural sources, e.g., bone or seashell; and immobilized 
biofactors, e.g., BMP2. Although BMP2 is the only protein clinically approved 
for use in a surgical device, there are several proteins, small molecules, and 
growth factors that show promise in tissue engineering applications. This review 
profiles the tissue engineering advances in achieving control over the location 
and onset of bone formation (spatiotemporal control) toward avoiding the 
complications associated with BMP2.

We present an extension of the Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS) 
standard for reporting sequences of uncultivated virus genomes. Minimum 
Information about an Uncultivated Virus Genome (MIUViG) standards were developed 
within the Genomic Standards Consortium framework and include virus origin, 
genome quality, genome annotation, taxonomic classification, biogeographic 
distribution and in silico host prediction. Community-wide adoption of MIUViG 
standards, which complement the Minimum Information about a Single Amplified 
Genome (MISAG) and Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MIMAG) standards for 
uncultivated bacteria and archaea, will improve the reporting of uncultivated 
virus genomes in public databases. In turn, this should enable more robust 
comparative studies and a systematic exploration of the global virosphere.

BACKGROUND: Bunion correction surgery is a very common procedure to improve 
patients' pain and physical function attributable to a misaligned first 
metatarsophalangeal joint. The objective of this study was to apply a health 
utility framework to estimate the cost utility of bunion correction surgery.
METHODS: Patients were prospectively recruited from the population of patients 
seen in a lower-extremity orthopedic clinic and scheduled for isolated bunion 
surgery. Participants completed EuroQoL's EQ-5D(3L) to measure patients' current 
general health preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Participants' change 
in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated by comparing the 
difference between postoperative utility values and preoperative utility values. 
The study had 95 patients representing 53% of eligible patients.
RESULTS: The mean preoperative utility value was 0.6816 and the mean 
postoperative value was 0.7451, a statistically significant difference denoting 
an improvement in self-reported health. The cost per QALY, assuming gains in 
health accrued for 15 years, was $4911 (the 95% confidence interval ranged from 
$4736 to $5088). The cost per QALY was highest among the oldest patients. 
Assuming gains in health accrued for 20 years, the cost per QALY was $3922.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that bunion correction surgery was 
inexpensive relative to its gains in health compared with commonly applied 
thresholds for women and men in all age groups, though the gains were not 
uniformly distributed across age categories. Future research should examine the 
impact of recurrence on the robustness of these findings.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, comparative study.

Robustness of the reproductive number estimates in vector-borne disease systems.

Campus, Penryn, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: The required efforts, feasibility and predicted success of an 
intervention strategy against an infectious disease are partially determined by 
its basic reproduction number, R0. In its simplest form R0 can be understood as 
the product of the infectious period, the number of infectious contacts and the 
per-contact transmission probability, which in the case of vector-transmitted 
diseases necessarily extend to the vector stages. As vectors do not usually 
recover from infection, they remain infectious for life, which places high 
significance on the vector's life expectancy. Current methods for estimating the 
R0 for a vector-borne disease are mostly derived from compartmental modelling 
frameworks assuming constant vector mortality rates. We hypothesised that some 
of the assumptions underlying these models can lead to unrealistic high vector 
life expectancies with important repercussions for R0 estimates.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we used a stochastic, individual-based 
model which allowed us to directly measure the number of secondary infections 
arising from one index case under different assumptions about vector mortality. 
Our results confirm that formulas based on age-independent mortality rates can 
overestimate R0 by nearly 100% compared to our own estimate derived from first 
principles. We further provide a correction factor that can be used with a 
standard R0 formula and adjusts for the discrepancies due to erroneous vector 
age distributions.
CONCLUSION: Vector mortality rates play a crucial role for the success and 
general epidemiology of vector-transmitted diseases. Many modelling efforts 
intrinsically assume these to be age-independent, which, as clearly demonstrated 
here, can lead to severe over-estimation of the disease's reproduction number. 
Our results thus re-emphasise the importance of obtaining field-relevant and 
species-dependent vector mortality rates, which in turn would facilitate more 
realistic intervention impact predictions.

[The overview for regulation of aging and the future perspective of anti-aging 
medicine].

[Article in Japanese]

Kondoh H, Mikawa T, Inagaki N.

Individual variability is one of the common features of aged human populations. 
As the popu- lation aging rate in Japan is forecasted to be over 40 % around 
2050, physiological and patho- logical variability of aging is a rising big 
issue not only for medical scientist but also as social concerns. Such 
variability could be partly explained as consequences of human evolution, but 
decrease of death rates also facilitates it indirectly. Here we review on aging 
and anti- aging research in 21st century, which would play a significant role to 
dissolve the problems relevant to the following issues. That is, regulation of 
aging, epigenetics, removal of senescent cells, regeneration of the tissues, and 
environmental improvement.

[Regulation of senescence by telomeres and telomerase].

[Article in Japanese]

Hayashi MT.

Telomeres are vital for chromosome end protection against activation of DNA 
damage response. Telomere attrition leads to cell cycle arrest, which underlies 
cellular senescence and can restrict tissue replenishment. Although stem cells 
express telomerase reverse tran- scriptase, which elongates telomeric DNA, its 
activity is not enough to fully compensate for chronic telomere shortening. 
Growing lines of evidence, including telomerase knockout mouse models and human 
genetic diseases, suggest that a decline in the cellular renewal capacity of 
stem cells is a consequence of such telomere shortening. These findings 
highlight the critical importance of telomere protection control for human aging 
process, and may lead to new strategies for healthy life extension.

Cast parts usually inherit internal defects such as micro shrinkage pores due to 
the manufacturing process. In order to assess the fatigue behaviour in both 
finite-life and long-life fatigue regions, this paper scientifically contributes 
towards a defect-based fatigue design model. Extensive fatigue and fracture 
mechanical tests were conducted whereby the crack initiating defect size 
population was fractographically evaluated. Complementary in situ X-ray computed 
tomography scans before and during fatigue testing enabled an experimental 
estimation of the lifetime until crack initiation, acting as a significant input 
for the fatigue model. A commonly applied fatigue assessment approach introduced 
by Tiryakioglu was modified by incorporating the long crack threshold value, 
which additionally enabled the assessment of the fatigue strength in the 
long-life fatigue regime. The presented design concept was validated utilising 
the fatigue test results, which revealed a sound agreement between the 
experiments and the model. Only a minor deviation of up to about five percent in 
case of long-life fatigue strength and up to about 9% in case of finite-lifetime 
were determined. Thus, the provided extension of Tiryakioglu's approach supports 
a unified fatigue strength assessment of cast aluminium alloys in both the 
finite- and long-life regimes.

    Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. 2019 Feb;7(2):76-78.

BACKGROUND: Our previous phase 2, open-label study of 11 infants and young 
children with life-threatening perinatal or infantile hypophosphatasia showed 1 
year safety and efficacy of asfotase alfa, an enzyme replacement therapy. We 
aimed to report the long-term outcomes over approximately 7 years of treatment.
METHODS: We did a prespecified, end of study, 7 year follow-up of our 
single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial in which children aged 3 years or younger 
with life-threatening perinatal or infantile hypophosphatasia were recruited 
from ten hospitals (six in the USA, two in the UK, one in Canada, and one in the 
United Arab Emirates). Patients received asfotase alfa (1 mg/kg three times per 
week subcutaneously, adjusted to 3 mg/kg three times per week if required) for 
up to 7 years (primary treatment period plus extension phase) or until the 
product became commercially available; dosage adjustments were made at each 
visit according to changes in the patient's weight. The primary objectives of 
this extension study were to assess the long-term tolerability of asfotase alfa, 
defined as the number of patients with one or more treatment-emergent adverse 
events, and skeletal manifestations associated with hypophosphatasia, evaluated 
using the Radiographic Global Impression of Change (RGI-C) scale (-3 indicating 
severe worsening, and +3 complete or near-complete healing). Respiratory 
support, growth, and cognitive and motor functions were also evaluated. All 
efficacy and safety analyses were done in all patients who received any asfotase 
alfa (full-analysis population). This study and extension phase are registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01205152, and EudraCT, number 2009-009369-32.
FINDINGS: 11 participants were recruited between Oct 6, 2008, and Dec 4, 2009. 
Ten patients completed a 6 month treatment period and entered the extension 
phase; nine received asfotase alfa for at least 6 years and completed the study, 
with four being treated for more than 7 years. Skeletal healing was sustained 
over 7 years of treatment; all evaluable patients had RGI-C scores of at least 
+2 at year 6 (n=9; median score +2·0 [range 2·0-3·0]) and year 7 (n=7; median 
score +2·3 [2·0-3·0]). No patient who completed the study required respiratory 
support after year 4. Weight Z scores improved to within normal range from year 
3 to study end; length or height Z scores improved but remained below normal. 
Age-equivalent scores on gross motor, fine motor, and cognitive subscales of the 
Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development also improved. All 11 patients 
had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. The most common adverse 
events were pyrexia (eight [73%] of 11 patients), upper respiratory tract 
infection (eight [73%]), craniosynostosis (seven [64%]), and pneumonia (seven 
[64%]). Serious adverse events related to asfotase alfa occurred in three (27%) 
patients (severe chronic hepatitis; moderate immediate post-injection reaction; 
and severe craniosynostosis with severe conductive deafness).
INTERPRETATION: Patients with perinatal or infantile hypophosphatasia treated 
with asfotase alfa for up to 7 years showed early, sustained improvements in 
skeletal mineralisation. Respiratory function, growth, and cognitive and motor 
function also improved, and asfotase alfa was generally well tolerated.
