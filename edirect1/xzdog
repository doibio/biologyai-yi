INTRODUCTION: Venetoclax in combination with rituximab (VEN + R) demonstrated 
prolonged overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for patients 
with relapsed/refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in comparison 
to standard chemoimmunotherapy [bendamustine + rituximab (BR)]. We conducted a 
cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis comparing VEN + R versus six 
comparators from the Swiss healthcare payer perspective.
METHODS: A three-state partitioned survival model, developed in accordance with 
NICE and ISPOR decision modelling guidelines, was adapted to Switzerland. Model 
inputs were informed by the MURANO trial (survival data, patient 
characteristics), publicly available Swiss sources (drug prices, inpatient and 
outpatient costs), Swiss National Institute of Cancer Epidemiology and 
Registration data (incidence and prevalence values), and Swiss medical expert 
feedback. We used published (dis-)utility values and adverse event 
probabilities.
RESULTS: Over a lifetime, VEN + R resulted in an expected gain of 2.60 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient and incremental costs of Swiss 
Francs (CHF) 147,851 compared to BR, leading to an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF 56,881/QALY gained. Other treatment strategies 
(for example ibrutinib versus VEN + R) resulted in higher costs and lower QALYs. 
Results were not different for subgroups of patients with/without deletion of 
chromosome 17p/tumour protein 53 mutation. In scenario analysis, changes in 
post-progression treatment costs demonstrated a high impact on results. We 
estimated an expected value of perfect information of CHF 3,318/patient. A 
moderate VEN + R uptake was estimated to save CHF 12.3 million during 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a threshold of CHF 100,000 per QALY, VEN + R was projected to 
be cost-effective vs BR.

BACKGROUND: Several guidelines have suggested alternative glycemic markers for 
hemoglobin A1c among older adults with limited life expectancy or multiple 
coexisting chronic illnesses. We evaluated associations between fructosamine, 
albumin-corrected fructosamine (AlbF), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 
mortality in the diabetic and nondiabetic subpopulations, and compared which 
marker better predicts mortality among participants aged 80 and older.
METHODS: Included were 2 238 subjects from the Healthy Ageing and Biomarkers 
Cohort Study (2012-2018) and 207 participants had diabetes at baseline. 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models investigated the 
associations of fructosamine, AlbF, FPG, and all-cause, cardiovascular disease 
(CVD), and non-CVD mortality in the diabetic and nondiabetic subpopulations. 
Restricted cubic splines explored potential nonlinear relations. C-statistic, 
integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and net reclassification 
improvement (NRI) evaluated the additive value of different glycemic markers to 
predict mortality.
RESULTS: Overall, 1 191 deaths were documented during 6 793 person-years of 
follow-up. In the linear model, per unit increases of fructosamine, AlbF, and 
FPG were associated with a higher risk of mortality in nondiabetic participants, 
with hazard ratios of 1.02 (1.00, 1.05), 1.27 (1.14, 1.42), and 1.04 (0.98, 
1.11) for all-cause mortality, and 1.04 (1.00, 1.07), 1.38 (1.19, 1.59), and 
1.10 (1.01, 1.19) for non-CVD mortality, respectively. Comparisons indicated 
that AlbF better predicts all-cause and non-CVD mortality in nondiabetic 
participants with significant improvement in IDI and NRI.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher concentrations of fructosamine, AlbF, and FPG were 
associated with a higher risk of all-cause or non-CVD mortality among the very 
elderly where AlbF may constitute an alternative prospective glycemic predictor 
of mortality.

BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is widespread across the world. Mapping the latest 
magnitudes and temporal trends of acne vulgaris provides the essential 
foundation for targeted public policies at the national, regional and global 
levels.
OBJECTIVES: In compliance with the framework of the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2019, this study aimed to summarize the incidence, prevalence, DALYs and 
the corresponding secular trends of acne vulgaris by sex and age group in 204 
countries from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: The average annual percentage change was calculated to depict the 
temporal trends in age-standardized rates (ASRs) of acne vulgaris burden by 
region, sex and age.
RESULTS: Globally, it was estimated that there were 117·4 million [95% 
uncertainty interval (UI) 103·0-133.7] incident cases of acne vulgaris, 231·2 
million (95% UI 208·2-255·5) prevalent cases and 5·0 (95% UI 3·0-7·9) million 
DALYs, with an increase of approximately 48% compared with 1990. Moreover, the 
overall ASRs of acne vulgaris increased by approximately 0·55% annually over the 
past three decades. We observed large disparities in ASRs of acne vulgaris with 
changing trends in sex, location and age. The ASR of acne vulgaris among women 
was around 1·3 times that of men, but the sex difference was narrowed because of 
the pronounced increase among men. The ASRs of acne vulgaris were higher in 
high-income regions, but the increasing trend was more pronounced in other 
regions.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden rate of acne vulgaris continues to increase in almost 
all countries. Understanding the specific characteristics of acne vulgaris 
burden is essential to formulate more effective and targeted interventions for 
controlling acne burden.

BACKGROUND: The announcement of China's 2060 carbon neutrality goal has drawn 
the world's attention to the specific technology pathway needed to achieve this 
pledge. We aimed to evaluate the health co-benefits of carbon neutrality under 
different technology pathways, which could help China to achieve the carbon 
neutrality goal, air quality goal, and Healthy China goal in a synergetic manner 
that includes health in the decision-making process.
METHODS: In this modelling study, we used Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 with no 
climate policy as the reference scenario, and two representative carbon 
neutrality scenarios with identical emission trajectories and different 
technology pathways-one was led by renewable energies and the other was led by 
negative emission technologies. We had three modules to analyse health 
co-benefits and mitigation costs for each policy scenario. First, we used a 
computable general equilibrium model that captures the operation of the whole 
economic system to investigate the carbon mitigation costs and air pollutant 
emission pathways of different technology portfolios. Second, we used a reduced 
complexity air quality model to estimate the concentrations of particulate 
matter in the atmosphere from the air pollutant emission pathways. Finally, we 
used a health impact evaluation model to estimate premature deaths, morbidity, 
and the resulting loss of life expectancy, then these health impacts were 
monetised according to value of a statistical life and cost of illness. We 
compared the monetised health co-benefits against the corresponding mitigation 
costs to explore the cost-effectiveness of different technology portfolios. A 
series of uncertainties embodied in carbon neutrality pathways and models were 
considered.
FINDINGS: In our models, sole dependence on improving end-of-pipe air pollution 
control measures is not sufficient for all Chinese provinces to meet the 2005 
WHO PM2·5 standards (10 μg/m3) by 2060. Only a combination of strong climate and 
air pollution control policies can lead to substantial improvement of air 
quality across China. If the carbon neutrality pathway led by developing 
renewable energies was followed, the air quality of all provinces could meet the 
WHO guideline by 2060. With the realisation of carbon neutrality goals, the 
total discounted mitigation costs (discount rate 5%) from 2020-60 would range 
from 40-125 trillion Chinese yuan (CNY), and 22-50 million cumulative premature 
deaths could be avoided. China has the potential to increase the associated life 
expectancy by 0·88-2·80 years per person in 2060 versus the reference scenario. 
The health benefits are higher in the renewable energies-led scenarios, whereas 
the mitigation costs are smaller in the negative emission technologies-led 
scenarios. If the value of a statistical life is set higher than 12·5 million 
CNY (39% of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development value), 
the health co-benefits will be higher than mitigation costs, even when 
considering all included uncertainties, implying the cost-effectiveness of 
China's carbon neutrality goal.
INTERPRETATION: The life expectancy increase from the realisation of China's 
2060 carbon neutrality goal could be equivalent to the past 5-10 years of life 
expectancy growth in China. Choosing an appropriate carbon neutrality pathway 
affects the health of China's population both today and in the future. Our 
findings suggest that, if China incorporates health co-benefits into climate 
policy making and puts a high value on people's health, it should choose a 
carbon neutrality pathway that relies more on developing renewable energies and 
avoid over-reliance on negative emission technologies.

Treatment of Hip Instability in Children With Down Syndrome: Keys to Managing a 
Challenging Problem.

INTRODUCTION: Management of hip instability in children with Down syndrome is a 
challenging task to undertake for even the most experienced surgeons. As life 
expectancy of these patients increases, the importance of preserving functional 
mobility and hip joint stability in order to minimize late hip degeneration and 
pain has become a priority. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical 
and radiographic outcomes of children with Down syndrome and hip instability who 
underwent surgical reconstruction with femoral and/or acetabular procedures.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all children with Down syndrome 
age 18 years and younger, who underwent surgical intervention to address hip 
instability between 2003 and 2017. Data was recorded detailing the patient's 
demographics, preoperative and postoperative functional status and surgical 
details. Preoperative and postoperative radiographic analysis was performed as 
well as 3-dimensional computed tomography scan evaluation, when available. All 
major and minor complications were recorded and classified using the Severin 
radiographic classification and the Clavien-Dindo-Sink clinical classification.
RESULTS: We studied 28 hips in 19 children that were followed for an average of 
4.4 years postsurgical intervention for hip instability. The majority of 
patients improved in all radiographic parameters. A total of 14 hips (50%) had 
complications and 9 hips (32%) required a secondary surgery. Of those 
complications, 2 hips (7%) developed avascular necrosis and 4 hips (14%) 
developed recurrent instability after the index procedure. Two of these hips had 
a subsequent anteverting periacetabular osteotomy that produced a stable hip at 
final follow up.
DISCUSSION: Surgical management of hip instability in children with Down 
syndrome remains challenging. The treating surgeon must have a thorough 
understanding of the pathoanatomy and design the surgical treatment to meet all 
of the underlying sources of instability. Combined femoral and acetabular 
osteotomies plus capsulorrhaphy are often required along with postoperative hip 
spica immobilization. Although complication and revision surgery rates are high, 
hip stability and good functional outcomes can be achieved.

Anticalin® proteins have been proven as versatile clinical stage 
biotherapeutics. Due to their small size (∼20 kDa), they harbor a short 
intrinsic plasma half-life which can be extended, e.g., by fusion with IgG or 
Fc. However, for antagonism of co-immunostimulatory Tumor Necrosis Factor 
Receptor Superfamily (TNFRSF) members in therapy of autoimmune and inflammatory 
diseases, a monovalent, pharmacokinetically optimized Anticalin protein format 
that avoids receptor clustering and therefore potential activation is favored. 
We investigated the suitability of an affinity-improved streptococcal 
Albumin-Binding Domain (ABD) and the engineered Fab-selective 
Immunoglobulin-Binding Domain (IgBD) SpGC3Fab for plasma Half-Life Extension 
(HLE) of an OX40-specific Anticalin and bispecific Duocalin proteins, 
neutralizing OX40 and a second co-immunostimulatory TNFRSF member. The higher 
affinity of ABD fusion proteins to human serum albumin (HSA) and Mouse Serum 
Albumin (MSA), with a 4 to 5-order of magnitude lower KD compared with the 
binding affinity of IgBD fusions to human/mouse IgG, translated into longer 
terminal plasma half-lives (t 1/2). Hence, the anti-OX40 Anticalin-ABD protein 
reached t 1/2 values of ∼40 h in wild-type mice and 110 h in hSA/hFcRn double 
humanized mice, in contrast to ∼7 h observed for anti-OX40 Anticalin-IgBD in 
wild-type mice. The pharmacokinetics of an anti-OX40 Anticalin-Fc fusion protein 
was the longest in both models (t 1/2 of 130 h and 146 h, respectively). Protein 
formats composed of two ABDs or IgBDs instead of one single HLE domain clearly 
showed longer presence in the circulation. Importantly, Anticalin-ABD and -IgBD 
fusions showed OX40 receptor binding and functional competition with 
OX40L-induced cellular reactivity in the presence of albumin or IgG, 
respectively. Our results suggest that fusion to ABD or IgBD can be a versatile 
platform to tune the plasma half-life of Anticalin proteins in response to 
therapeutic needs.

The global population is aging, and elderly people have a higher incidence of 
lower airway diseases owing to decline in swallowing function, airway ciliary 
motility, and overall immunity associated with aging. Furthermore, lower airway 
diseases in the elderly tend to have a high mortality rate. Their prevention is 
important for extending healthy life expectancy and improving the quality of 
life of each individual. In recent years, the relationship between "chronic 
periodontitis and oral bacteria, especially the periodontopathic ones" and 
"respiratory diseases" (e.g., pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
and influenza) has become clear. In addition, the association of several 
periodontal pathogens with the onset and aggravation of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) is also being reported. In support of these findings, oral health 
management has shown to reduce deaths from pneumonia and prevent influenza in 
nursing homes and inpatient wards. This has led to clinical and 
multidisciplinary cooperation between physicians and dentists, among others. 
However, to date, the mechanisms by which "chronic periodontitis and oral 
bacteria" contribute to lower airway diseases have not been well understood. 
Clarifying these mechanisms will lead to a theoretical basis for answering the 
question, "Why is oral health management effective in preventing lower airway 
diseases?"

Sourdoughs based on fermentation by lactobacilli have the potential to produce 
gluten-free maize-based bread with acceptable technological and rheological 
characteristics, nutritional quality, and more prolonged shelf life. Of the 17 
treatments compared (with or without sourdough, and involving single and 
multiple LAB species), treatments 12C (Lactobacillus brevis, 
L sanfranciscensis + L. plantarum), and 8C (L. brevis + L. paralimentarius) 
showed the lowest rate of complex modulus, while treatments 11C 
(L. sanfranciscensis + L. brevis + L. paralimentarius) and 2C (L. brevis) led to 
the greatest reduction in baking loss. The crumb moisture content of all of the 
formulations decreased with storage. Breads produced with treatment 2C 
(L. brevis) had the highest crumb moisture content when freshly baked, while 
loaves produced with treatment 3C (L. paralimentarius) had the highest crumb 
moisture content after four days of storage. A sensory evaluation indicated that 
sourdough-based maize breads were superior to both control and chemically 
acidified breads. The optimal treatments were to use sourdough seeded with 
treatment 2C (L. brevis), with treatment 4C (L. plantarum), with treatment 8C 
(L. brevis + L. paralimentarius), or with treatment 11C 
(L. sanfranciscensis + L. brevis + L. paralimentarius).

BACKGROUND: Most common terrestrial animal clades exhibit senescence, suggesting 
strong adaptive value of this trait. However, there is little support for 
senescence correlated with specific adaptations. Nevertheless, insects, mammals, 
and birds, which are the most common terrestrial animal clades that show 
symptoms of senescence, evolved from clades that predominantly did not show 
symptoms of senescence. Thus, we aimed to examine senescence in the context of 
the ecology and life histories of the main clades of animals, including humans, 
and to formulate hypotheses to explain the causes and origin of senescence in 
the major clades of terrestrial animals.
METHODOLOGY: We reviewed literature from 1950 to 2020 concerning life 
expectancy, the existence of senescence, and the adaptive characteristics of the 
major groups of animals. We then proposed a relationship between senescence and 
environmental factors, considering the biology of these groups of animals. We 
constructed a model showing the phylogenetic relationships between animal clades 
in the context of the major stages of evolution, distinguishing between 
senescent and biologically 'immortal' clades of animals. Finally, we synthesised 
current data on senescence with the most important concepts and theories 
explaining the origin and mechanisms of senescence. Although this categorisation 
into different senescent phenotypes may be simplistic, we used this to propose a 
framework for understanding senescence.
RESULTS: We found that terrestrial mammals, insects, and birds show senescence, 
even though they likely evolved from non-senescent ancestors. Moreover, 
secondarily aquatic animals show lower rate of senescence than their terrestrial 
counterparts. Based on the possible life histories of these groups and the 
analysis of the most important factors affecting the transition from a 
non-senescent to senescent phenotype, we conclude that aging has evolved, not as 
a direct effect, but as a correlated response of selection on developmental 
strategies, and that this occurred separately within each clade. Adoption of 
specific life history strategies could thus have far-reaching effects in terms 
of senescence and lifespan.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis strongly suggests that senescence may have emerged as 
a side effect of the evolution of adaptive features that allowed the 
colonisation of land. Senescence in mammals may be a compromise between land 
colonisation and longevity. This hypothesis, is supported by palaeobiological 
and ecological evidence. We hope that the development of new research 
methodologies and the availability of more data could be used to test this 
hypothesis and shed greater light on the evolution of senescence.

Background: We used the Therapy Preference Scale, a 30-item questionnaire, to 
determine cancer treatment preferences of adults with cancer. Methods: We used 
Wilcoxon's rank sum test and Fisher's exact test to compare the preferences of 
younger (<60 years) versus older adults (≥60 years). Results: While 56% of 
patients would accept treatment offering increased life expectancy at an expense 
of short-term side effects, 75% preferred maintenance of cognition, functional 
ability and quality of life to quantity of days. Oral instead of intravenous 
treatment (p = 0.003), shorter hospital stay (p = 0.03), preservation of 
cognitive function (p = 0.01) and avoidance of pain (p = 0.02) were more 
important to older patients compared with younger patients. Conclusion: Many 
patients prioritized maintenance of cognition, functional ability and quality of 
life; older patients valued oral treatment, shorter hospital stay, preservation 
of cognitive function and avoidance of pain.

Plain Language Summary: Lay abstract Understanding the preferences of adults 
with cancer is important for physicians to develop personalized cancer treatment 
plans. We used a self-reported 30-item questionnaire, the Therapy Preference 
Scale, to help patients express their preferences with regard to safety, 
efficacy and other aspects of therapy. While 56% of the patients in our study 
would accept treatment offering increased life expectancy at an expense of 
short-term side effects, 75% preferred maintenance of cognition, functional 
ability and quality of life to quantity of days. Compared with younger patients, 
older patients preferred oral instead of intravenous treatment, shorter hospital 
stay, preservation of cognitive function and avoidance of pain.

IMPORTANCE: In the IMspire150 trial, triplet treatment with atezolizumab and 
vemurafenib plus cobimetinib significantly improved progression-free survival 
(PFS) compared with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib alone for treatment of BRAF 
V600 variation metastatic melanoma. However, considering high cost of this 
combination, it is unclear if the incremental cost is worth the additional 
survival benefit.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab and vemurafenib 
plus cobimetinib vs vemurafenib plus cobimetinib alone in patients with newly 
diagnosed unresectable BRAF V600 variation metastatic melanoma from the US 
health care perspective.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation study used a 3-state 
partitioned survival model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the combination 
of atezolizumab with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib vs vemurafenib plus 
cobimetinib alone. The observed Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival and PFS 
were digitized from the IMspire150 trial (January 2017-April 2018) and the 
long-term survivals (over a lifetime horizon) beyond the end of the trial were 
extrapolated using 7 different survival models. The cost and health preference 
data were collected from a literature review. This study was performed from 
March 2021 through June 2021.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcomes of interest were expected life-years 
(LYs) gained and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per LYs and per QALYs saved.
RESULTS: Adding atezolizumab to vemurafenib and cobimetinib provided an 
additional 3.267 QALYs compared with the doublet regimen of vemurafenib plus 
cobimetinib, at an ICER of $271 669 per QALY, which is not considered 
cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000 per QALY. 
However, the scenario analyses found that atezolizumab combined with vemurafenib 
plus cobimetinib could be cost-effective at 20-year (ICER, $121 432 per QALY) 
and 30-year ($98 092 per QALY) time horizons when both strategies were stopped 
after 2 years of treatments, and over a lifetime horizon ($122 220 per QALY) 
when only immunotherapy with atezolizumab was stopped after 2 years of 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that the atezolizumab and 
vemurafenib plus cobimetinib regimen provides significant survival benefits over 
vemurafenib plus cobimetinib alone, and a price reduction would be encouraged to 
maximize the value of its survival gain.

BACKGROUND: Quality of life in cancer patients might be affected by 
chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Especially in patients with pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with a short life expectancy, fear of poor quality of 
life is often a reason for both patients and medical oncologists to refrain from 
further treatment. In this study, we investigated quality of life (QoL), pain, 
sleep, and activity levels in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) patients 
after FOLFIRINOX treatment.
METHODS: A total of 41 LAPC patients with stable disease or partial response 
were included after completion of at least four cycles of FOLFIRINOX. QoL was 
measured with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and NRS pain scores. Patients completed the 
Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) for five consecutive nights and 
wore a GENEActiv tri-axial accelerometer (Actiwatch) for 7 days, registering 
sleep duration, efficiency, and activity.
RESULTS: Mean EORTC QLQ-C30 score for global health status was 78.3 (± 17.3), 
higher than reference values for cancer patients (P < 0.001) and general 
population (P = 0.045). LAPC patients reported few disease-related symptoms. Two 
patients (5%) reported pain scores > 3. Mean sleep duration was 8 h/night 
(± 1.2 h) and sleep efficiency 70% (± 9%) with high patient-reported quality of 
sleep (mean RCSQ score 72.0 ± 11.4). Mean duration of moderate-vigorous activity 
was 37 min/week (± 103 min/week).
CONCLUSIONS: QoL is very good in most LAPC patients with disease control after 
FOLFIRINOX, measured with validated questionnaires and Actiwatch registration. 
The fear of clinical deterioration after FOLFIRINOX is not substantiated by this 
study and should not be a reason to refrain from treatment.

BACKGROUND: This article presents the first detailed analysis of the prevalence 
and disability burden of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) from 1990 to 2019 by 
cause, age, sex, and Socio-demographic Index (SDI) in 204 countries and 
territories.
METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study (GBD) 2019 were used. GBD 
2019 modelled the prevalence of GBS using hospital and claims data. Years lived 
with disability (YLDs) were estimated as the product of the GBS prevalence and 
the disability weight. This article also reported proportions in the 
age-standardised prevalence rate that were due to six underlying causes of GBS.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 150,095 [95% uncertainty intervals (UI) 119,924 to 
188,309] total cases of GBS worldwide, which resulted in 44,407 (95% UI 28,016 
to 64,777) YLDs. Globally, there was a 6.4% (95% UI 3.6 to 9.5) increase in the 
age-standardised prevalence of GBS per 100,000 population between 1990 and 2019. 
High-income Asia Pacific [1.9 (95% UI: 1.5 to 2.4)] and East Asia [0.8 (95% UI: 
0.6 to 1.0)] had the highest and lowest age-standardised prevalence rates (per 
100,000), respectively, in 2019. Nationally, Japan [6.4 (95% UI: 5.3 to 7.7)] 
and China [0.8 (95% UI: 0.6 to 1.0)] had the highest and lowest age-standardised 
prevalence rates (per 100,000). The age-standardised burden of GBS increased 
with increasing age and was higher in males in all age groups. Furthermore, the 
age-standardised prevalence of GBS (per 100,000) had a positive association with 
the level of development, as measured by SDI, although this association was not 
strong. Upper respiratory infections and unknown causes accounted for the 
highest proportions of underlying causes.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, the prevalence of GBS continues to increase. Geographical 
differences and strategies aimed at preventing infectious diseases should be 
considered in future health policy planning and decision-making processes. This 
study had several limitations, such as using the same disability weight for all 
causes and a reliance on hospital- and self-reported data, which should be 
addressed in future research.

BACKGROUND: Raised low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in young 
adulthood (aged 18-39 years) is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease (ASCVD) later in life. Most young adults with elevated LDL-C do not 
currently receive lipid-lowering treatment.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of elevated LDL-C in 
ASCVD-free U.S. young adults and the cost-effectiveness of lipid-lowering 
strategies for raised LDL-C in young adulthood compared with standard care.
METHODS: The prevalence of raised LDL-C was examined in the U.S. National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey. The CVD Policy Model projected lifetime 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), health care costs, and incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for lipid-lowering strategies. Standard care 
was statin treatment for adults aged ≥40 years based on LDL-C, ASCVD risk, or 
diabetes plus young adults with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL. Lipid lowering incremental to 
standard care with moderate-intensity statins or intensive lifestyle 
interventions was simulated starting when young adult LDL-C was 
either ≥160 mg/dL or ≥130 mg/dL.
RESULTS: Approximately 27% of ASCVD-free young adults have LDL-C of ≥130 mg/dL, 
and 9% have LDL-C of ≥160 mg/dL. The model projected that young adult lipid 
lowering with statins or lifestyle interventions would prevent lifetime ASCVD 
events and increase QALYs compared with standard care. ICERs were US$31,000/QALY 
for statins in young adult men with LDL-C of ≥130 mg/dL and US$106,000/QALY for 
statins in young adult women with LDL-C of ≥130 mg/dL. Intensive lifestyle 
intervention was more costly and less effective than statin therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin treatment for LDL-C of ≥130 mg/dL is highly cost-effective 
in young adult men and intermediately cost-effective in young adult women.

Social and emotional skills are known to affect health and non-health outcomes, 
but there is limited evidence on whether these skills in childhood affect late 
life outcomes because of a shortage of long-running datasets containing this 
information. We develop a three-stage procedure and use it to estimate the 
effect of childhood social and emotional skills on health and labour market 
outcomes in late-life. This procedure makes use of mediators in midlife which 
are shown to be predicted by childhood skills in one dataset and to predict 
late-life outcomes in another dataset. We use this method to combine estimates 
from the National Child Development Survey and the British Household Panel 
Survey. We find that childhood skills predict marital status, education, home 
ownership, income and health at age 46 years and these midlife variables predict 
levels of quality-adjusted life years and labour income accumulated by age 63 
years. The combined estimates suggest a standard deviation increase in average 
Bristol Social Adjustment Guide total score at ages 7 and 11 is associated with 
4.2% (standard error = 0.6%) additional quality-adjusted life years and more 
than 9.9% (£14,539, standard error = £2072) additional accumulated pre-tax 
earnings by age 63 years. Therefore, childhood interventions to increase social 
and emotional skills would be expected to reduce future healthcare costs and 
increase wealth. Our three-stage methodology can be used to predict the 
life-course effects of investments in childhood skills by combining results from 
datasets across population cohorts.

Aspirin and statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in 
older adults.

The value of primary preventative therapies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 
older adults (age ≥75 years) is less certain than in younger patients. There is 
a lack of quality evidence in older adults due to underenrolment in pivotal 
trials. While aspirin is no longer recommended for routine use in primary 
prevention of CVD in older adults, statins may be efficacious. However, it is 
unclear which patient subgroups may benefit most, and guidelines differ between 
expert panels. Three relevant geriatric conditions (cognitive impairment, 
functional impairment and polypharmacy) may influence therapeutic decision 
making; for example, baseline frailty may affect statin efficacy, and some have 
advocated for deprescription in this scenario. Evidence regarding statins and 
incident functional decline are mixed, and vigilance for adverse effects is 
important, especially in the setting of polypharmacy. However, aspirin has not 
been shown to affect incident cognitive or functional decline, and its lack of 
efficacy extends to patients with baseline cognitive impairment or frailty. 
Ultimately, the utility of primary preventative therapies for CVD in older 
adults depends on potential lifetime benefit. Rather than basing treatment 
decisions on absolute risk alone, consideration of comorbidities, polypharmacy 
and life expectancy should play a significant role in decision making. Coronary 
calcium score and new tools for risk stratification validated in older adults 
that account for the competing risk of death may aid in evaluating potential 
benefits. Given the complexity of therapeutic decisions in this context, shared 
decision making provides an important framework.
