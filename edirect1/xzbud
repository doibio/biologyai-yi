BACKGROUND: A dilemma arises about the merits of conservative management vs lead 
replacement and/or extraction when patients with a Medtronic Sprint Fidelis lead 
undergo generator replacement. Conflicting reports suggest that the fracture 
rate may increase after generator change.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of generator 
replacement on Fidelis lead performance.
METHODS: The Carelink PLUS cohort is composed of 21,500 Fidelis leads (model 
6949) implanted in 1,006 centers. The survival rate for leads that remained 
active after the first generator replacement was compared with that for a 
control group with matched lead implant duration, patient age, patient sex, and 
generator type using the Kaplan-Meier method. The control group's starting point 
was adjusted to match the implant duration of each lead in the replacement group 
to allow for the comparison of similarly aged leads.
RESULTS: Of the 2,988 implanted leads in each group, there was no statistical 
difference in the number of lead fractures between cases and controls 
(replacement, n = 227; no replacement, n = 257; Fisher exact, P = .169). Lead 
survival analysis demonstrated that lead performance since the first replacement 
procedure did not differ from that of the matched control group.
CONCLUSION: The Fidelis lead survival rate after generator replacement does not 
differ from that of the Fidelis leads that have not had replacement. In the 
event of generator replacement with no manifestation of lead fracture, the lead 
model, patient age and life expectancy, ejection fraction, comorbidities, ease 
of extraction, local extraction expertise, and patient preference should be 
considered to determine the best course of action.

The population of older individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is rapidly 
expanding, mainly due to increased life expectancy. While targeted biological 
therapies are well established for the treatment of this disease, their use may 
be lower in older patients (age > 65 years) and very old patients 
(age > 75 years) as a result of perceived higher risks for adverse events in 
this population, taking into account comorbidity, polypharmacy, and frailty. In 
this review, we discuss the available evidence for the use of biological 
therapies in this growing patient group with specific attention towards the 
eventual reasons for biological treatment failure or withdrawal. The majority of 
data is found in secondary analyses of clinical trials and in retrospective 
cohorts. The most information available is on tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 
blockers. Older patients seem to have a less robust response to anti-TNF agents 
than a younger population, but drug survival as a proxy for efficacy does not 
seem to be influenced by age. Despite an overall rate of adverse effects 
comparable to that in younger patients, older RA patients are at higher risk of 
serious infections. Other biologics appear to have an efficacy similar to 
anti-TNF agents, also in older RA patients. Again, the drug survival rates for 
tocilizumab, rituximab, and abatacept resemble those in young RA patients with 
good general tolerability and safety profiles. The cardiovascular risk and the 
risk of cancer, increased in RA patients and in the older RA patients, do not 
appear to be strongly influenced by biologicals.

Given prostate cancer is driven, in part, by its responsiveness to androgens, 
treatments historically employ methods for their removal from circulation. 
Approaches as crude as castration, and more recently blockade of androgen 
synthesis or receptor binding, are still of limited use long term, since other 
steroids of adrenal origin or tumor origin can supersede that role as the 
'castration resistant' tumor re-emerges. Broader inhibition of steroidogenesis 
using relatively nonselective P450 inhibitors such as ketoconazole is not an 
alternative since a general disruption of steroid biosynthesis is neither safe 
nor effective. The recent emergence of drugs more selectively targeting CYP17 
have been more effective, and yet extension of life has been on the scale of 
months rather than years. It is now becoming clear this shortcoming arises from 
the adaptive capabilities of many tumors to initiate local steroid synthesis 
and/or become responsive to novel early pathway adrenal steroids that are 
synthesized when lyase activity is not selectively blocked, and ACTH rises in 
the face of declining cortisol feedback. Abiraterone has been described as a 
lyase selective inhibitor, yet its use still requires co-administration of 
prednisone to suppress such a rise of ACTH and fall in cortisol. So is creation 
of a selective lyase inhibitor even possible? Can C19 steroid production be 
achieved without a prominent decline in cortisol and corresponding rise in ACTH? 
Decades of scientific study of CYP17 in humans and nonhuman primates, as well as 
nature's own experiments of gene mutations in humans, reveal 'true' or 
'isolated' 17,20 lyase deficiency does quite selectively prevent C19 steroid 
biosynthesis whereas simple 17 hydroxylase deficiency also suppresses cortisol. 
We propose these known outcomes of natural mutations should be used to guide 
analysis of clinical trials and long term outcomes of CYP17 targeted drugs. In 
this review, we use that framework to re-evaluate the basic and clinical 
outcomes of many compounds being used or in development for treatment of 
castration resistant prostate cancer. Specifically, we include the nonselective 
drug ketoconazole, and then the CYP17 targeted drugs abiraterone, orteronel 
(TAK-700), galaterone (TOK-001), and seviteronel (VT-464). Using this framework, 
we can fully discriminate the clinical outcomes for ketoconazole, a drug with 
broad specificity, yet clinically ineffective, from that of abiraterone, the 
first CYP17 targeted therapy that is limited by its need for prednisone 
co-therapy. We also can identify potential next generation CYP17 targeted drugs 
now emerging that show signs of being far more 17,20 lyase selective. We 
conclude that a future for improved therapy without substantial cortisol 
decline, thus avoiding prednisone co-administration, seems possible at long 
last.

BACKGROUND: Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) are an indicator of 
mortality, morbidity, and disability. We calculated DALYs for cancer in 
middle-aged and older adults participating in the Consortium on Health and 
Ageing Network of Cohorts in Europe and the United States (CHANCES) consortium.
METHODS: A total of 90 199 participants from five European cohorts with 10 455 
incident cancers and 4399 deaths were included in this study. DALYs were 
calculated as the sum of the years of life lost because of premature mortality 
(YLLs) and the years lost because of disability (YLDs). Population-attributable 
fractions (PAFs) were also estimated for five cancer risk factors, ie, smoking, 
adiposity, physical inactivity, alcohol intake, and type II diabetes.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 12 years, the total number of DALYs lost 
from cancer was 34 474 (382 per 1000 individuals) with a similar distribution by 
sex. Lung cancer was responsible for the largest number of lost DALYs (22.9%), 
followed by colorectal (15.3%), prostate (10.2%), and breast cancer (8.7%). 
Mortality (81.6% of DALYs) predominated over disability. Ever cigarette smoking 
was the risk factor responsible for the greatest total cancer burden (24.0%, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 22.2% to 26.0%), followed by physical inactivity 
(4.9%, 95% CI = 0.8% to 8.1%) and adiposity (1.8%, 95% CI = 0.2% to 2.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: DALYs lost from cancer were substantial in this large European 
sample of middle-aged and older adults. Even if the burden of disease because of 
cancer is predominantly caused by mortality, some cancers have sizeable 
consequences for disability. Smoking remained the predominant risk factor for 
total cancer burden.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of 
Internet-based interventions for depression in comparison with usual care. 
However, evidence on the cost-effectiveness of these interventions when 
delivered in outpatient clinics is lacking. The aim of this study was to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of an Internet-based problem-solving guided 
self-help intervention in comparison with enhanced usual care for outpatients on 
a waiting list for face-to-face treatment for major depression. After the 
waiting list period, participants from both groups received the same treatment 
at outpatient clinics.
METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed alongside a randomized controlled 
trial with 12 months follow-up. Outcomes were improvement in depressive symptom 
severity (measured by CES-D), response to treatment and Quality-Adjusted 
Life-Years (QALYs). Statistical uncertainty around cost differences and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated using bootstrapping.
RESULTS: Mean societal costs for the intervention group were €1579 higher than 
in usual care, but this was not statistically significant (95% CI - 1395 to 
4382). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the maximum 
probability of the intervention being cost-effective in comparison with usual 
care was 0.57 at a ceiling ratio of €15,000/additional point of improvement in 
CES-D, and 0.25 and 0.30 for an additional response to treatment and an extra 
QALY respectively, at a ceiling ratio of €30,000. Sensitivity analysis showed 
that from a mental healthcare provider perspective the probability of the 
intervention being cost-effective was 0.68 for a ceiling ratio of 0 €/additional 
unit of effect for the CES-D score, response to treatment and QALYs. As the 
ceiling ratio increased this probability decreased, because the mean costs in 
the intervention group were lower than the mean costs in the usual care group.
LIMITATIONS: The patients in the intervention group showed low adherence to the 
Internet-based treatment. It is possible that greater adherence would have led 
to larger clinical effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Offering an Internet-based intervention to depressed outpatients on 
waiting list for face-to-face treatment was not considered cost-effective in 
comparison with enhanced usual care from a societal perspective. There was a 
high probability of the intervention being cost-effective in comparison with 
enhanced usual care from the perspective of the mental healthcare provider.

We use a model to predict whether using a patient decision aid in patients 
considering bisphosphonate therapy would be a good use of health resources. We 
found that if the decision aid improved adherence, and only marginally increased 
time physicians needed with their patients, then the decision-aid would be 
cost-effective.
INTRODUCTION: Oral bisphosphonates have been shown to reduce the risk of 
osteoporotic fracture. Adherence is crucial but suboptimal. A recent study 
suggests that a patient decision aid, which facilitates shared decision-making, 
could be effective in increasing adherence to bisphosphonates. But decision aids 
come at a cost in terms of additional time spent with physicians. This study 
considers the emerging evidence on the role of patient decision aids in 
improving adherence to bisphosphonates and their potential costs to inform 
future decision-making and research priorities.
METHODS: We estimate the hypothetical cost-effectiveness of a patient decision 
aid detailing the benefits and risks of bisphosphonates for osteoporotic 
patients, from a Canadian healthcare perspective. A previously developed and 
validated Markov microsimulation model was adapted to include use of a patient 
decision aid to support the decision of whether to initiate bisphosphonate 
therapy, and subsequent influence on adherence and future fractures. We 
considered 2014 costs and benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs).
RESULTS: A patient decision aid that could improve treatment initiation rates or 
persistence (adherence) by 20 %, or a linear combination of the two, in 
osteoporotic women aged 70+ over a 3-year treatment period was found to have an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below $50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient decision aids have the potential to be cost-effective in 
osteoporosis so long as they increase adherence under certain conditions. 
Funding further research on the long-term effectiveness and costs of a patient 
decision aid which outlines all treatment options for osteoporosis patients is 
justified.

INTRODUCTION: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) during hospitalization for acute 
hypercapnic exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has 
been shown to be effective, but data on the prognosis of such patients is 
limited. The aim of this study was to investigate in-hospital and long-term 
outcome in patients with COPD exacerbations requiring NIV treatment during 
hospitalization.
METHODS: Between 2011 and 2013, hospitalized subjects with hypercapnic COPD 
exacerbations were included in this retrospective single-center cohort study. 
Subjects' clinical and laboratory data and survival status after a median of 27 
months were recorded. The predictive factors of in-hospital and long-term 
mortality were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 574 patients (357 men, mean age 68±11 years) were recorded. 
During hospitalization, 24 (4.1%) patients died. In-hospital mortality was 
negatively affected by lower baseline values of hematocrit, albumin, and pH, and 
by higher baseline leucocytes and higher 24h PaCO2. Median survival of the 
cohort was 27 months. Mortality at 3 and 6 months, and 1 year were 14.5%, 19.5%, 
and 30%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, reduction in long-term 
survival was found to be related to older age, higher Charlson score, lower 
baseline levels of hematocrit and albumin, and lower pH level after 24h. In the 
multivariate analysis, older age and lower albumin were identified as the 
strongest predictors of mortality.
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy after a COPD exacerbation requiring NIV treatment is 
short. Baseline blood counts and day 2 arterial blood gases levels may predict 
in-hospital mortality. The strongest indicators of poorer long-term outcome were 
advanced age and lower albumin. Such patients may need closer follow-up.

BACKGROUND: The mainstay of treatment for bone metastases from renal cell 
carcinoma is surgery. We assessed if there was a difference in local recurrence, 
reoperation, and survival between patients who underwent metastasectomy, 
intralesional curettage, or stabilization only for renal cell carcinoma 
metastasis to the appendicular skeleton, and if there was a difference in these 
outcomes based on margin status.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 183 patients; 48% underwent 
metastasectomy (n = 88, margins: 64 negative; 20 positive; 4 unclear), 30% 
intralesional curettage (n = 54), and 22% stabilization only (n = 41).
RESULTS: The recurrence rate differed and was highest after stabilization only 
(39%), followed by intralesional curettage (22%), and metastasectomy (12%) 
(P = 0.003). However, we found no difference in reoperation rate (P = 0.847). 
Survival was better in patients who underwent metastasectomy (P = 0.020). The 
recurrence rate was lower in patients who had a negative margin (5%) as compared 
to those with a positive margin (26%) (P < 0.001). However, we found no 
difference in reoperation rate (P = 0.97). Negative margins showed better 
survival (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize the importance of obtaining negative margins 
in patients with a good life expectancy, as lower recurrence rate can be 
attained at a not significant additional risk for reoperation, with a potential 
impact on survival. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;114:237-245. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

Embryo-maternal communication during the first 4 weeks of equine pregnancy.

Stout TA(1).

University, Utrecht, The Netherlands. Electronic address: t.a.e.stout@uu.nl.

The first month of equine pregnancy covers a period of rapid growth and 
development, during which the single-cell zygote metamorphoses into an embryo 
with a functional circulation and precursors of many important organs, enclosed 
within extraembryonic membranes responsible for nutrient uptake and gaseous 
exchange. After exiting the oviduct, the conceptus must influence uterine 
physiology to ensure adequate nutrition and preparation for implantation, while 
continued development results in the chorioallantois superseding the yolk sac as 
the primary interface for maternal interaction and exchange. Throughout the 
first month, pregnancy maintenance depends absolutely on progesterone secreted 
by the primary corpus luteum. However, although extension of luteal life span 
via maternal recognition of pregnancy is clearly essential, it is still not 
known how the horse conceptus signals its presence. On the other hand, our 
understanding of how luteolytic prostaglandin F2α release from the endometrium 
is averted has improved, and we are increasingly aware of the biological and 
practical significance of various events characteristic of early horse 
pregnancy, such as selective oviductal transport, the formation and dissolution 
of the blastocyst capsule, and prolonged intrauterine conceptus migration. It is 
also increasingly clear that embryo-maternal dialog during the first month is 
essential not only to conceptus survival but also has more profound and 
long-lasting implications. In this latter respect, it is now accepted that the 
maternal environment (e.g., metabolic or health status) may epigenetically alter 
gene expression capacity of the developing embryo and thereby permanently 
influence the health of the resulting foal right through adulthood.

INTRODUCTION: We estimate the burden of late-onset dementia in the United 
Kingdom through to 2025 and assess the impact of potential interventions.
METHODS: We compute disability adjusted life years (DALYs) through to 2025 and 
consider three interventions, all assumed launched in 2018; (1) an optimistic 
limiting case of a 100% preventive intervention with immediate uptake of 100% of 
the population at risk; (2) an intervention which delays onset by 5 years, 
linear uptake to 50% after 5 years; (3) as (2) but uptake 75% after 5 years.
RESULTS: By 2025, the DALY burden will have increased by 42% from the Global 
Disease Burden 2010 estimate. Intervention results: (1) a 9% decrease by 2025; 
(2) a 33% increase; and (3) a 28% increase.
DISCUSSION: At current prevalence rates, the ability of an intervention to 
offset the projected increase in DALY burden of dementia in the United Kingdom 
by 2025 appears low.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer 
mortality in Belgium. In Flanders (Belgium), a population-based screening 
program with a biennial immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) in women 
and men aged 56-74 has been organised since 2013. This study assessed the 
cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the colorectal population-based 
screening program in Flanders (Belgium).
METHODS: A health economic model was conducted, consisting of a decision tree 
simulating the screening process and a Markov model, with a time horizon of 
20years, simulating natural progression. Predicted mortality and incidence, 
total costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with and without the 
screening program were calculated in order to determine the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of CRC screening. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were conducted, taking into account uncertainty of the 
model parameters.
RESULTS: Mortality and incidence were predicted to decrease over 20years. The 
colorectal screening program in Flanders is found to be cost-effective with an 
ICER of 1681/QALY (95% CI -1317 to 6601) in males and €4,484/QALY (95% CI -3254 
to 18,163). The probability of being cost-effective given a threshold of 
€35,000/QALY was 100% and 97.3%, respectively. The budget impact analysis showed 
the extra cost for the health care payer to be limited.
CONCLUSION: This health economic analysis has shown that despite the possible 
adverse effects of screening and the extra costs for the health care payer and 
the patient, the population-based screening program for CRC in Flanders is 
cost-effective and should therefore be maintained.

OBJECTIVE: When deciding about diabetes treatments, patients are typically 
uninformed about how much time is required before (time requirements), or for 
how long treatments change outcomes (legacy effects). However, patients may be 
motivated to adopt treatments with time-related treatment information. We 
explored whether this information alters a patients' likelihood of starting 
medications.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 60 
adults with type 2 diabetes for <10 years and hypertension on oral medications. 
We measured change in likelihood of starting medications after receiving time 
requirement (diabetes, 10 years; hypertension, 3 years) and legacy effect 
(diabetes, 10 additional years; hypertension, none) information. Responses were 
analyzed for themes about time-related treatment information.
RESULTS: At baseline, 70% of participants reported being very likely to start a 
recommended medication. Nearly half (40%) were less likely to start a diabetes 
medication after being informed of time requirements; but after being informed 
of legacy effects, 32% reported being more likely. Fewer participants changed 
likelihoods of starting antihypertensives with time-related information. Many 
participants expressed that medications' benefits were important to them 
regardless of time-related information. Participants considered time 
requirements for diabetes medications too long and compared them to their life 
expectancy. Many participants were interested in legacy effects of diabetes 
medications because they looked forward to discontinuing medications, although 
some expressed doubt that benefits could persist after stopping medications.
CONCLUSIONS: While prolonged time requirements may dissuade patients from 
adopting treatments, the promise of legacy effects may motivate patients to 
commit to diabetes treatments.

Cost-Effectiveness of Cardiovascular Screening in Patients With Rheumatoid 
Arthritis.

Bernhoven Hospital, Uden, The Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE: Early detection and preemptive treatment of patients at risk is of 
great importance in reducing the excess risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, it is unclear how much screening is 
cost-effective in RA. The objective is to assess whether CV screening in RA 
proves to be cost-effective from a medical perspective, using different 
scenarios based on different guidelines.
METHODS: A Markov chain model was used with a time horizon of 10 years. 
Parameter values were mainly obtained from literature and from RA patients 
screened for CV diseases at the Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The 
Netherlands. The primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness expressed as 
costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis was performed and described in willingness-to-pay curves; several 
scenarios were built.
RESULTS: In the base case scenario, in 82% of the simulations, screening proved 
to be dominant compared to no screening. The mean QALY gain was 0.09 (95% 
percentile -0.07, 0.27), and the mean cost savings were €-1,057 (95% percentile 
-€2,825, €333). Different scenarios showed small differences in 
cost-effectiveness; the probability that screening is dominant remained high 
with the lowest probability being 50% for a very conservative scenario.
CONCLUSION: Screening for CV events in RA patients was estimated to be 
cost-effective with high chances of being less expensive and more effective. 
These results support endorsement of screening for CV risk in patients with RA.

Several models have been studied on predictive epidemics of arthropod vectored 
plant viruses in an attempt to bring understanding to the complex but specific 
relationship between the three cornered pathosystem (virus, vector and host 
plant), as well as their interactions with the environment. A large body of 
studies mainly focuses on weather based models as management tool for monitoring 
pests and diseases, with very few incorporating the contribution of vector's 
life processes in the disease dynamics, which is an essential aspect when 
mitigating virus incidences in a crop stand. In this study, we hypothesized that 
the multiplication and spread of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) in a crop 
stand is strongly related to its influences on Frankliniella occidentalis 
preferential behavior and life expectancy. Model dynamics of important aspects 
in disease development within TSWV-F. occidentalis-host plant interactions were 
developed, focusing on F. occidentalis' life processes as influenced by TSWV. 
The results show that the influence of TSWV on F. occidentalis preferential 
behaviour leads to an estimated increase in relative acquisition rate of the 
virus, and up to 33% increase in transmission rate to healthy plants. Also, 
increased life expectancy; which relates to improved fitness, is dependent on 
the virus induced preferential behaviour, consequently promoting multiplication 
and spread of the virus in a crop stand. The development of vector-based models 
could further help in elucidating the role of tri-trophic interactions in 
agricultural disease systems. Use of the model to examine the components of the 
disease process could also boost our understanding on how specific 
epidemiological characteristics interact to cause diseases in crops. With this 
level of understanding we can efficiently develop more precise control 
strategies for the virus and the vector.

People with mental illness have a significantly lower life expectancy and higher 
rates of chronic physical illnesses than the general population. Health care 
system reform to improve access and quality is greatly needed to address this 
inequity. The inclusion of consumers of mental health services as 
co-investigators in research is likely to enhance service reform. In light of 
this, the current paper reviews mental health consumer focussed research 
conducted to date, addressing the neglect of physical health in mental health 
care and initiatives with the aim of improving physical health care. The 
international literature on physical healthcare in the context of mental health 
services was searched for articles, including mental health consumers in 
research roles, via Medline, CINAHL and Google Scholar, in October 2015. Four 
studies where mental health consumers participated as researchers were 
identified. Three studies involved qualitative research on barriers and 
facilitators to physical health care access, and a fourth study on developing 
technologies for more effective communication between GPs and patients. This 
review found that participatory mental health consumer research in physical 
health care reform has only become visible in the academic literature in 2015. 
Heightened consideration of mental health consumer participation in research is 
required by health care providers and researchers. Mental health nurses can 
provide leadership in increasing mental health consumer research on integrated 
care directed towards reducing the health gap between people with and without 
mental illness.

BACKGROUND: Meniscus scaffolds are currently evaluated clinically for their 
efficacy in preventing the development of osteoarthritis as well as for their 
efficacy in treating patients with chronic symptoms. Procedural costs, 
therapeutic consequences, clinical efficacy, and future events should all be 
considered to maximize the monetary value of this intervention.
PURPOSE: To examine the socioeconomic effect of treating patients with 
irreparable medial meniscus injuries with a meniscus scaffold.
STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: Two Markov simulation models for patients with an irreparable medial 
meniscus injury were developed. Model 1 was used to investigate the lifetime 
cost-effectiveness of a meniscus scaffold compared with standard partial 
meniscectomy by the possibility of preventing the development of osteoarthritis. 
Model 2 was used to investigate the short-term (5-year) cost-effectiveness of a 
meniscus scaffold compared with standard partial meniscectomy by alleviating 
clinical symptoms, specifically in chronic patients with previous meniscus 
surgery. For both models, probabilistic Monte Carlo simulations were applied. 
Treatment effectiveness was expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
while costs (estimated in euros) were assessed from a societal perspective. We 
assumed €20,000 as a reference value for the willingness to pay per QALY. Next, 
comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the most 
influential variables on the cost-effectiveness of meniscus scaffolds.
RESULTS: Model 1 demonstrated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a 
meniscus scaffold treatment of €54,463 per QALY (€5991/0.112). A threshold 
analysis demonstrated that a meniscus scaffold should offer a relative risk 
reduction of at least 0.34 to become cost-effective, assuming a willingness to 
pay of €20,000. Decreasing the costs of the meniscus scaffold procedure by 33% 
(€10,160 instead of €15,233; an absolute change of €5073) resulted in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €7876 per QALY. Model 2 demonstrated an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a meniscus scaffold treatment of 
€297,727 per QALY (€9825/0.033). On the basis of the current efficacy data, a 
meniscus scaffold provides a relative risk reduction of "limited benefit" 
postoperatively of 0.37 compared with standard treatment. A threshold analysis 
revealed that assuming a willingness to pay of €20,000, a meniscus scaffold 
would not be cost-effective within a period of 5 years. Most influential 
variables on the cost-effectiveness of meniscus scaffolds were the cost of the 
scaffold procedure, cost associated with osteoarthritis, and quality of life 
before and after the scaffold procedure.
CONCLUSION: Results of the current health technology assessment emphasize that 
the monetary value of meniscus scaffold procedures is very much dependent on a 
number of influential variables. Therefore, before implementing the technology 
in the health care system, it is important to critically assess these variables 
in a relevant context. The models can be improved as additional clinical data 
regarding the efficacy of the meniscus scaffold become available.

Radiology Case of the Month:Diagnosis and Treatment of an Acquired Uterine 
Arteriovenous Malformation in a 26-Year-Old Woman presenting with Vaginal 
Bleeding.

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a rare source of potentially 
life-threatening uterine bleeding, and should be suspected in patients 
presenting with metromenorrhagia. Histologically, AVMs are characterized as 
having both arterial and venous tissues without an intervening capillary 
network.1 The etiology may be either congenital or acquired secondary to prior 
uterine surgery or uterine malignancy.2 Congenital lesions are thought to result 
from arrested vascular development and contain a nidus of multiple feeding 
arteries anastomosed to multiple draining veins. In contrast, acquired lesions 
contain small fistulas between a single feeding artery and draining vein.4 While 
angiography is considered the gold standard for diagnosing AVMs, its limitations 
include exposure to contrast and radiation and the inability to accurately 
detect the degree of pelvic extension.5 As a result, ultrasound (US) with color 
Doppler is the imaging modality of choice in suspected AVM and can be confirmed 
noninvasively with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).6 Angiography remains the 
preferred method of imaging when there is a high index of suspicion of AVM in a 
patient who may potentially undergo embolization as treatment.3 Historically, 
the definitive treatment for AVMs has been either hysterectomy or uterine artery 
ligation. However, embolotherapy has become a well-recognized alternative to 
surgery since the first reported case in 1982.5 One of the advantages of 
embolotherapy is the preservation of reproductive structures. Currently, 
treatment for AVMs is based on the patient's desire to maintain fertility. The 
objective of this study was (1) to describe the diagnostic features of an AVM on 
Doppler ultrasound in a patient who presented with vaginal bleeding and (2) 
discuss the treatment and outcome of this patient using uterine artery 
embolization.

BACKGROUND: Frailty prevalence differs across countries depending on the models 
used to assess it that are based on various conceptual and operational 
definitions. This study aims to assess the clinical validity of three frailty 
models among community-dwelling older adults in north-western Russia where there 
is a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease and lower life expectancy than 
in European countries.
METHODS: The Crystal study is a population-based prospective cohort study in 
Kolpino, St. Petersburg, Russia. A random sample of the population living in the 
district was stratified into two age groups: 65-75 (n = 305) and 75+ (n = 306) 
and had a baseline comprehensive health assessment followed by a second one 
after 33.4 +/-3 months. The total observation time was 47 +/-14.6 months. 
Frailty was assessed according to the models of Fried, Puts and 
Steverink-Slaets. Its association with mortality at 5 years follow-up as well as 
dependency, mental and physical decline at around 2.5 years follow up was 
explored by multivariable and time-to-event analyses.
RESULTS: Mortality was predicted independently from age, sex and comorbidities 
only by the frail status of the Fried model in those over 75 years old [HR (95 % 
CI) = 2.50 (1.20-5.20)]. Mental decline was independently predicted only by 
pre-frail [OR (95 % CI) = 0.24 (0.10-0.55)] and frail [OR (95 % CI) = 0.196 
(0.06-0.67)] status of Fried model in those 65-75 years old. The prediction of 
dependency and physical decline by pre-frail and frail status of any the three 
frailty models was not statistically significant in this cohort of older adults.
CONCLUSIONS: None of the three frailty models was valid at predicting 5 years 
mortality and disability, mental and physical decline at 2.5 years in a cohort 
of older adults in north-west Russia. Frailty by the Fried model had only 
limited value for mortality in those 75 years old and mental decline in those 
65-75 years old. Further research is needed to identify valid frailty markers 
for older adults in this population.

BACKGROUND: Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed tools to 
standardize economic evaluations of global health interventions, little is known 
about the cost-effectiveness of surgical mission trips and their economic 
values. Our objective was to systematically evaluate the current literature on 
surgical volunteering trips to measure their adherence to WHO CHOosing 
Interventions that are cost-effective (WHO-CHOICE). We hypothesized that the 
majority of studies use some type of cost-effectiveness analysis that do not 
adhere to these standards.
METHODS: A systematic review of Pubmed, Medline, and Embase databases was 
performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, with inclusion criteria set a 
priori. Of the 908 publications screened, 72 were selected for full text review; 
17 met inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Only 17 out of 72 studies reported some type of economic analysis. We 
categorized the studies into service, educational, and combination (service and 
educational) surgical trips. Although seven of the service studies calculated 
the cost per disability-adjusted life year averted, the results were not based 
on WHO-CHOICE standards to facilitate comparisons among alternative options. 
Furthermore, none of the three educational trips calculated the value of the 
education provided, but only published cost estimates of the resources used 
during the trip.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a few studies performed some type of economic analysis, 
owing to their non-adherence to WHO-CHOICE standards, the results were not 
comparable to other studies. International surgical trips are expensive. To 
improve the efficacy and optimal use of limited resources, studies on surgical 
trips should follow the guidelines set by the WHO-CHOICE.

INTRODUCTION: Heart failure (HF) is characterized by substantial health and 
economic burden, mainly attributed to increased hospitalizations and 
readmissions. Its diagnosis remains challenging due to the non-specific nature 
of the initial symptoms of the disease. Recently, scientific evidence has 
highlighted the potential of natriuretic peptides (NP) in improving the 
diagnosis and prognosis of HF and, by extension, in restraining healthcare 
costs. The present review aimed at providing evidence of their optimal use in 
terms of economic and health outcomes.
AREAS COVERED: Systematic literature research limited to studies published from 
February 2006 to February 2016 was performed with the aim of identifying and 
analyzing all cost-effectiveness and other economic evaluation studies that 
investigated the economic and health outcomes of NPs use as screening and 
management tools for HF. Expert commentary: NP testing either added in the
