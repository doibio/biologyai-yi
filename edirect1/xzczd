METHODS: Data from 996 participants, and code to run published statistical 
models, were provided for inspection. The main elements of the study were 10 
lead-time trade-off (TTO) experiments and 7 discrete choice experiments (DCEs). 
Data quality was examined and tested with respect to subsequent assumptions made 
in the statistical analysis. We examined the statistical analysis including 
model specification and estimation methods.
RESULTS: The TTO experiments covered less than 3% of the possible 3125 5-level 
health states. There is strong evidence, both direct (self-reported) and 
indirect (poor data quality), that many participants found tasks difficult or 
did not engage effectively. Forty-seven percent of respondents valued more than 
20% of states inconsistently, which is double the 3-level rate. The DCEs covered 
12.5% of possible states and 0.01% of possible 2-state comparisons. The design 
precludes examination of inconsistent responses. Several aspects of the 
statistical model conflict with the data and underlying experimental design. The 
model is unidentified. The Bayesian approach relies on unjustified, informative 
priors. There is a clear failure to achieve convergence.
CONCLUSION: Significant limitations are identified with the quality of the 
valuation data and the subsequent statistical analysis that underpin the English 
EQ-5D-5L value set. A new program of further development, including a new data 
collection initiative, should be considered to put the EQ-5D-5L on a 
sufficiently firm evidential basis for healthcare decision making.

Nowadays, there is an increasing concern regarding the shelf life of food 
products, leading producers to research natural antimicrobial agents to use in 
food preparation. In this study, we evaluated the antifungal activity of 
Lactobacillus plantarum fermented whey and then added the whey during 
preparation of pita bread to study shelf-life improvement. The fermented whey 
showed a satisfactory inhibitory (antifungal) effect against Penicillium 
expansum and Penicillium brevicompactum strains: the minimum inhibitory and 
minimum fungicidal concentrations ranged from 3.9 to 39.0 g/L and from 62.5 to 
250 g/L, respectively. Addition of fermented whey increased the shelf life of 
the pita bread. After inoculation of the bread surface with Penicillium, an 
increase in shelf life until d 8 was achieved compared with the positive 
control, whereas under natural contamination conditions, an extension of shelf 
life until d 19 was observed. In terms of antimicrobial activity, the greatest 
reduction (100%) in fungal growth was achieved when all of the water in the 
dough was replaced with fermented whey. An untrained sensory panel could not 
identify differences between bread produced with fermented whey and control pita 
breads. These results suggest the possibility of using fermented whey in food 
preservation.

The conventional production model based on extensive use of chemical inputs such 
as pesticides is increasingly challenged. Organic agriculture is considered as 
one of the most important alternative agricultural systems to produce healthy 
food without any chemicals. Current models are not suitable for prediction of 
environmental behaviors. The current study aims to analyze the diffusion of 
organic agriculture to produce healthy food with the environmental sociology 
approach among farmers. The study was conducted using the survey research and 
multi-stage random sampling in Fars province, in the south of Iran. The samples 
included 215 farmers. The reliability of the questionnaire was confirmed by 
conducting a pilot study out of the main sample. The results showed that the 
farmers have strong attitude to the environment and are for the most part, 
highly intentioned to perform organic activities. Based on the results, the 
farmers' intention toward adoption of organic agriculture, environmental 
identity, and responsibility of pro-environmental behavior, and their moral 
norms play an important role to accept organic agricultural activities. There 
are also some effective factors in implementation of organic agriculture 
including farmers` increasing awareness about the principles of organic farming, 
controllability of environmental behaviors as well as their accessibility to the 
resources and facilities for organic farming. The study emphasized that the 
attitude and enhancing the knowledge do not lead to pro-environmental behaviors 
and organic activities directly. Using the models and environmental sociology 
theories is more efficient to explain pro-environmental behaviors. To this aim, 
some suggestions were presented to increase the adoption of organic activities 
and persuade the Iranian farmers to select this kind of cultivation.

The global increase in life expectancy to 74 years for women, while the median 
age of the menopause remains at 51 years, means that an increasing number of 
women will live a significant portion of their adult lives in the menopause. The 
WHI publications in 2003/4 reported on the dangers of hormone replacement 
therapy, in particular with respect to breast cancer and dementia risk. This 
resulted in a dramatic reduction in hormone replacement therapy prescription and 
use. However, the findings from the WHI studies have been re-appraised, and the 
new perspective is reflected in the guidance published by NICE in 2015 in which 
they recommended that more women be offered hormone replacement therapy as the 
benefits are now perceived to outweigh the risks for most women. However, 
controversy continues to surround hormone replacement therapy, and there are 
probably few areas in medicine where the misuse of terminology causes quite as 
much confusion as in hormone replacement therapy. Commonly used terms such as 
'menopausal hormone therapy' and 'hormone replacement therapy' lack specificity 
and there is an urgent need for correct terminology to accurately describe the 
hormones replaced.

During the last decades, further knowledge of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
molecular mechanisms has led to development of effective systemic treatments 
including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immunotherapy. In this review, 
we describe first and second line systemic treatment options for advanced HCC. 
Several trials have evaluated new drugs for the treatment of HCC patients: In 
first line, lenvatinib resulted non-inferior to sorafenib and it can be used as 
alternative, even in the lack of evidence for sequential treatment options in 
second line after lenvatinib. Recently, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab have shown 
superiority over sorafenib in first-line. Sorafenib-regorafenib sequential 
administration in selected patients has opened a new paradigm of treatment in 
advanced HCC with a life expectancy exceeding two years. Other TKIs for second 
line treatment include cabozantinib and ramucirumab (specifically for patients 
with Alpha-fetoprotein values ≥ 400 ng/mL). The combination of TKIs with 
immunotherapy may represent a big step forward for these patients in the near 
future.

Merosin deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (MDC1A), or LAMA2-related 
muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-RD), is a recessive disorder resulting from mutations 
in the LAMA2 gene, encoding for the alpha-2 chain of laminin-211. The disease is 
predominantly characterized by progressive muscular dystrophy affecting patient 
motor function and reducing life expectancy. However, LAMA2-RD also comprises a 
developmentally-associated dysmyelinating neuropathy that contributes to the 
disease progression, in addition to brain abnormalities; the latter often 
underappreciated. In this brief review, we present data supporting the impact of 
peripheral neuropathy in the LAMA2-RD phenotype, including both mouse models and 
human studies. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying nerve 
abnormalities and involved in the laminin-211 pathway, which affects axon 
sorting, ensheathing and myelination. We conclude with some final considerations 
of consequences on nerve regeneration and potential therapeutic strategies.

INTRODUCTION: Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by recurrent episodes of 
depression and mania and affects up to 2% of the population worldwide. Patients 
suffering from bipolar disorder have a reduced life expectancy of up to 10 
years. The increased mortality might be due to a higher rate of somatic 
diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases. There is however also evidence for 
an increased rate of diabetes mellitus in BD, but the reported prevalence rates 
vary by large.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 85 bipolar disorder patients were recruited in the 
framework of the BiDi study (Prevalence and clinical features of patients with 
Bipolar Disorder at High Risk for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), at prediabetic state 
and with manifest T2D) in Dresden and Würzburg. T2D and prediabetes were 
diagnosed measuring HBA1c and an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT), which at 
present is the gold standard in diagnosing T2D. The BD sample was compared to an 
age-, sex- and BMI-matched control population (n = 850) from the Study of Health 
in Pomerania cohort (SHIP Trend Cohort).
RESULTS: Patients suffering from BD had a T2D prevalence of 7%, which was not 
significantly different from the control group (6%). Fasting glucose and 
impaired glucose tolerance were, contrary to our hypothesis, more often 
pathological in controls than in BD patients. Nondiabetic and diabetic bipolar 
patients significantly differed in age, BMI, number of depressive episodes, and 
disease duration.
DISCUSSION: When controlled for BMI, in our study there was no significantly 
increased rate of T2D in BD. We thus suggest that overweight and obesity might 
be mediating the association between BD and diabetes. Underlying causes could be 
shared risk genes, medication effects, and lifestyle factors associated with 
depressive episodes. As the latter two can be modified, attention should be paid 
to weight changes in BD by monitoring and taking adequate measures to prevent 
the alarming loss of life years in BD patients.

The consideration for treatment of mitral regurgitation is dependent on its 
underlying cause: degenerative or functional. The percutaneous MitraClip 
treatment is mostly suitable for patients with severe, symptomatic mitral 
regurgitation and additional risk factors, who therefore do not qualify for 
surgical treatment but still have a life expectancy of more than one year. The 
MitraClip treatment has undergone technical improvements in the past ten years 
and has a low rate of periprocedural and postprocedural complications. Patients 
with severe functional mitral regurgitation, a relatively preserved left 
ventricular function, and a limited left ventricular volume benefit most from a 
MitraClip treatment. The number of MitraClip procedures in the Netherlands is 
strongly increasing and has shown good results. Besides the development of the 
MitraClip and introduction of new devices, careful patient selection is the most 
important instrument to achieve better results.

AIMS: To evaluate the expected life expectancy in patients with diabetes in 
Bulgaria and to compare it to the expected life expectancy of the non-diabetic 
population in the country.
METHODS: It is a retrospective observational population study on individuals 
diagnosed with diabetes, compared to the non-diabetic population in Bulgaria for 
the period 2012-2015. Data from the national diabetes register and national 
statistical institute were used to construct life-tables with probability of 
survival with t-test and Chi Square test. Confounder analysis was done by age, 
sex, and type of diabetes. All-cause mortality and deaths in diabetic patients 
were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed for each age group 
and a log-rank analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: Average life expectancy in the non-diabetic population, patients with 
Type 1 DM and with Type 2 DM is 74.8; 70.96 and 75.19 years, respectively. For 
2012-2015 the mortality in the non-diabetic population remained constant and 
lower (average-1.48%) compared to type-1 DM (5.25%) and Type-2 (4.27%). Relative 
risk of death in diabetics was higher overall (12%), after the age of 70 before 
which the relative risk was higher for the non-diabetic population. This was 
observed as a trend in all analyzed years.
CONCLUSION: Patients with type 2 DM have a longer life-expectancy than patients 
with type-1 DM and overall Diabetics life expectancy equals that of the 
non-diabetic population, which could suggest improved disease control and its 
associated complications in Bulgaria. Male diabetics show slightly longer life 
expectancy than their counterparts in the non-diabetic population, by a marginal 
gain of 0.6 years for the entire observed period. Life expectancy in diabetic 
women increased by 1.3 years, which was not observed in the non-diabetic 
population. Prevalence of diabetes was higher for women. Improved diabetes 
control may explain this gain in life; however other studies are needed to 
confirm this.

Investment in healthcare infrastructure in resource-limited settings is a vital 
and cost-effective approach for diminishing world-wide disease burden, 
increasing quality of life, and lengthening life expectancy. Graduate medical 
trainees enthusiastically express interest in supporting global health efforts 
that expand healthcare access and capacity in resource-limited settings. 
Academic institutions are responding by developing training programs to equip 
graduate medical trainees with the technical, interpersonal, scholastic, and 
ethical skillsets necessary for the pursuit of global health efforts. Drawn from 
real-world experience and current literature, the following twelve tips will 
strengthen a global health curriculum in graduate medical training programs with 
dedicated global health education.

BACKGROUND: Robotic surgery is increasingly used for proctectomy, but the 
cost-effectiveness of this approach is uncertain. Robotic surgery is considered 
more expensive than open or laparoscopic approaches, but in certain situations 
has been demonstrated to be cost-effective. We examined the cost-effectiveness 
of open, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches to proctectomy from societal and 
healthcare system perspectives.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate one-year costs and 
outcomes of robotic, laparoscopic, and open proctectomy based on data from the 
available literature. The robustness of our results was tested with one-way and 
multi-way sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Open proctectomy had increased cost and lower quality of life (QOL) 
compared with laparoscopy and robotic approaches. In the societal perspective, 
robotic proctectomy costs $497/case more than laparoscopy, with minimal QOL 
improvements, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
$751,056 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In the healthcare sector 
perspective, robotic proctectomy resulted in $983/case more and an ICER of 
$1,485,139/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated factors influencing 
cost-effectiveness primarily pertained to the operative cost and the 
postoperative length of stay (LOS). In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the 
cost-effective approach to proctectomy was laparoscopic in 42% of cases, robotic 
in 39%, and open in 19% at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $100,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic and robotic proctectomy cost less and have higher QALY 
than the open approach. Based on current data, laparoscopy is the most 
cost-effective approach. Robotic proctectomy can be cost-effective if modest 
differences in costs or postoperative LOS can be achieved.

Background: The aim of this study was to estimate the incremental cost-utility 
ratio (ICUR) of a multi-modal intervention in frail and pre-frail subjects aged 
≥70 years with type-2 diabetes versus usual care group focused on quality 
adjusted life years (QALYs) in different European countries. Methods: The 
MID-FRAIL study was a cluster randomized multicentre trial conducted in seven 
European countries. A cost-utility analysis was carried out based on this study, 
conducted from the perspective of the health care system with a time horizon of 
one year. Univariate and probabilistic analysis were carried out to test the 
robustness of the results. Results: The cost estimation showed the offsetting 
health effect of the intervention program on total health care costs. The mean 
annual health care costs were 25% higher among patients in usual care. The mean 
incremental QALY gained per patient by the intervention group were 0.053 QALY 
compared with usual care practice. Conclusions: The MID-FRAIL intervention 
program showed to be the dominant option in comparison with usual care practice. 
It saved costs to the health care system and achieved worthwhile health gains. 
This finding should encourage its implementation, at least, in the trial 
participant countries.

OBJECTIVE: Identification of a cost-effective treatment strategy is an unmet 
need in Crohn's disease (CD). Here we consider the patient outcomes and cost 
impact of pan-intestinal video capsule endoscopy (PVCE) in the English National 
Health Service (NHS).
DESIGN: An analysis of a protocolized CD care pathway, informed by guidelines 
and expert consensus, was performed in Microsoft Excel. Population, efficacy and 
safety data of treatments and monitoring modalities were identified using a 
structured PubMed review with English data prioritized. Costs were taken from 
the NHS and Payer Provided Services (PSS) 2016-17 tariffs for England and 
otherwise literature. Analysis was via a discrete-individual simulation with 
discounting at 3.5% per annum.
SETTING: NHS provider and PSS perspective.
PARTICIPANTS: 4000 simulated CD patients.
INTERVENTIONS: PVCE versus colonoscopy ± magnetic resonance enterography (MRE).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs in 2017 GBP and quality-adjusted life years (QALY).
RESULTS: The mean, total 20-year cost per patient was £42 266 with colonoscopy ± 
MRE and £38 043 with PVCE. PVCE incurred higher costs during the first 2 years 
due to higher treatment uptake. From year 3 onwards, costs were reduced due to 
fewer surgeries. Patients accrued 10.67 QALY with colonoscopy ± MRE and 10.96 
with PVCE. PVCE dominated (less cost and higher QALY) colonoscopy ± MRE and was 
likely (>74%) to be considered cost-effective by the NHS. Results were similar 
if a lifetime time horizon was used.
CONCLUSIONS: PVCE is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to colonoscopy ± 
MRE for CD surveillance. Switching to PVCE resulted in lower treatment costs and 
gave patients better quality of life.

Aneurysm of the abdominal aorta is common and can be treated with endovascular 
repair, open surgical repair or conservative treatment. Risk-stratification and 
treatment decision-making can be complex in frail patients and depends largely 
on anatomy, life-expectancy and functional capacity. Currently, 
risk-stratification in the Netherlands is primarily based on comorbidities and 
age. Insight in a patient's resilience could provide important additional 
information. For this reason, St. Antonius hospital has implemented an 
Anaesthesia Geriatric Evaluation (AGE) to screen for frailty in high risk 
vascular surgery patients. Results of frailty-screening are discussed in a 
multi-disciplinary team (MDT) to assess perioperative risk and compose a 
personal treatment plan. This paper presents a case-series of three patients to 
illustrate the additional value of MDT care and frailty-screening in a high-risk 
vascular surgery population.

With the increase in life expectancy, women now live up to one-third of their 
life in menopause. Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) is a common gynecologic 
complaint encountered by the clinician. Endometrial cancer is present in about 
10% of patients with PMB. Nevertheless, many other conditions such as 
endometrial or cervical polyps, genital atrophy, or non-gynecologic conditions 
may also be present. Hysteroscopy has replaced blind diagnostic procedures and 
is now considered the gold-standard technique for the diagnosis and management 
of intrauterine pathology. Gynecologists in clinical practice should be familiar 
with the use of hysteroscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of the menopausal 
patient presenting with gynecologic complaints. The aim of this article is to 
report the current evidence on the role of hysteroscopy in the evaluation and 
management of the postmenopausal patient with intrauterine pathology.

Prey speed influences the speed and structure of the raptorial strike of a 
'sit-and-wait' predator.

Predators must often employ flexible strategies to capture prey. Particular 
attention has been given to the strategies of visual predators that actively 
pursue their prey, but sit-and-wait predators have been largely overlooked, 
their strategies often characterized as stereotyped. Praying mantids are 
primarily sit-and-wait predators that often employ crypsis to catch their prey 
using a raptorial strike produced by their highly modified forelimbs. Here, we 
show that the raptorial strike of the Madagascan marbled mantis (Polyspilota 
aeruginosa) varies in duration from 60 to 290 ms due to the tibial extension 
alone; slower strikes involve slower tibial extensions that may also be 
interrupted by a pause. The success of a strike is independent of its duration 
or the presence of these pauses. However, prey speed affects the duration of 
tibial extension and the probability of a pause occurring, both increasing at 
slower prey speeds. Adjusting the duration of the tibial extension according to 
prey speed allows mantids to time the final downward sweep of the tibia to their 
prey's approach. The use of visual inputs to adjust the motor pattern 
controlling forelimb movements shows that not all aspects of the strike are 
stereotyped and that sit-and-wait predators can produce behavioural flexibility.

The aim of this study was to measure the magnitude and distribution of a 
Korean's lifetime dental expenses depending on age and sex, by constructing a 
hypothetical lifetime and life table of survival. Additionally, we estimated the 
difference in life expectancy between men and women and its impact on dental 
expenses. We used the 2015 Korea Health Panel Survey to calculate the total 
dental expenditure, including expenses paid directly by patients and those paid 
by insurers. We generated survival profiles to simulate dental expenses during a 
typical lifetime (from birth to age 95) using the abridged life table (five-year 
intervals for age groups) in 2015 from the South Korean Statistical Information 
Service. We independently calculated the remaining dental expenses for survivors 
of all ages. The results showed that an estimate of average lifetime dental 
expenditure was $31,851 per capita: $31,587 for men and $32,318 for women. 
Nearly 33% of the average per capita lifetime dental expenditure was 
attributable to the longer life expectancy of women, with no statistically 
significant difference in lifetime dental expenditure between men and women. 
Many survivors incurred 70% of their lifetime dental expenses before age 65. The 
results highlighted the need for policymakers to address spending on 
age-specific dental care owing to extended life expectancy, given the 
disproportionate share of healthcare resources supporting the elderly.

BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is associated with increased risk of cancer. However, 
the impact of tuberculosis on global cancer burden is unknown.
METHODS: We performed random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions of 
studies reporting the association between tuberculosis and cancer risks by 
searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane library, and CINAHL from 
inception to 1 June 2019. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) of cancer 
incidence attributable to tuberculosis were calculated using relative risks from 
our meta-analyses and tuberculosis prevalence data from Global Health Data 
Exchange by age, sex, and country. The study has been registered with PROSPERO 
(CRD42016050691).
RESULTS: Fourty nine studies with 52,480 cancer cases met pre-specified 
inclusion criteria. Tuberculosis was associated with head and neck cancer (RR 
2.64[95% CI 2.00-3.48]), hepatobiliary cancer (2.43[1.82-3.25]), Hodgkin's 
lymphoma (2.19[1.62-2.97]), lung cancer (1.69[1.46-1.95]), gastrointestinal 
cancer (1.62[1.26-2.08]), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (1.61[1.34-1.94]), pancreatic 
cancer (1.58[1.28-1.96]), leukaemia (1.55[1.25-1.93]), kidney and bladder cancer 
(1.54[1.21-1.97]), and ovarian cancer (1.43[1.04-1.97]). We estimated that 
2.33%(1.14-3.81) or 381,035(187145-623,404) of global cancer incidences in 2015 
were attributable to tuberculosis. The PAFs varied by Socio-demographic Index 
(SDI)-ranging from 1.28% (0.57-2.31%) in the high-SDI countries to 3.51% 
(1.84-5.42%) in the middle-SDI countries. Individually, China and India 
accounted for 47% of all tuberculosis-related cancer cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis is associated with increased risk of cancer at ten 
sites. The burden of tuberculosis attributable cancer skewed towards lower 
resource countries. Research priorities are to better understand regional 
disparities and underlying mechanism linking tuberculosis and cancer 
development.

In this nationwide, population-based study, we assessed 10-year relative 
survival among 225,305 patients with ten early-stage cancers diagnosed in the 
Netherlands during 2004-2015. This study aimed to ascertain which early-stage 
cancer is associated with minimal or no excess mortality and likely to be 
diagnosed in individuals who are otherwise more healthy or health-conscious than 
their counterparts in the general population. Ten-year relative survival 
marginally exceeded 100% in patients with early-stage prostate cancer, while it 
was close to 100% for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and stage I 
cancers of the breast, skin (melanoma), testis, and thyroid. In contrast, 
patients with early-stage oral/pharyngeal, bladder, lung, and pancreatic cancers 
experienced considerable excess mortality, reflected by a 10-year relative 
survival of 74.9%, 69.4%, 45.5%, and 33.9%, respectively. Collectively, the life 
expectancy of patients with DCIS and early-stage cancers of the prostate, 
breast, skin (melanoma), testis, and thyroid parallels the expected survival of 
an age-, sex-, and calendar year-matched group from the general population. Our 
study findings add to the controversy surrounding overdiagnosis of particular 
early-stage cancers that are generally not destined to metastasis or cause 
excess mortality.

Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most aggressive human 
malignancies, with an average life expectancy of ∼6 months from the time of 
diagnosis. The genetic and epigenetic changes that underlie this malignancy are 
incompletely understood. We found that ASH1-like histone lysine 
methyltransferase (ASH1L) is overexpressed in ATC relative to the much less 
aggressive and more common differentiated thyroid cancer. This increased 
expression was due at least in part to reduced levels of microRNA-200b-3p 
(miR-200b-3p), which represses ASH1L expression, in ATC. Genetic knockout of 
ASH1L protein expression in ATC cell lines decreased cell growth both in culture 
and in mouse xenografts. RNA-Seq analysis of ASH1L knockout versus WT ATC cell 
lines revealed that ASH1L is involved in the regulation of numerous 
cancer-related genes and gene sets. The pro-oncogenic long noncoding RNA colon 
cancer-associated transcript 1 (CCAT1) was one of the most highly (approximately 
68-fold) down-regulated transcripts in ASH1L knockout cells. Therefore, we 
investigated CCAT1 as a potential mediator of the growth-inducing activity of 
ASH1L. Supporting this hypothesis, CCAT1 knockdown in ATC cells decreased their 
growth rate, and ChIP-Seq data indicated that CCAT1 is likely a direct target of 
ASH1L's histone methyltransferase activity. These results indicate that ASH1L 
contributes to the aggressiveness of ATC and suggest that ASH1L, along with its 
upstream regulator miR-200b-3p and its downstream mediator CCAT1, represents a 
potential therapeutic target in ATC.

OBJECTIVES: To report the level and trends of prevalence, incidence and years 
lived with disability (YLDs) for osteoarthritis (OA) in 195 countries and 
territories from 1990 to 2017 by age, sex and Socio-demographic index (SDI; a 
composite of sociodemographic factors).
METHODS: Publicly available modelled data from the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 were used. The burden of OA was 
estimated for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017, through a 
systematic analysis of prevalence and incidence modelled data using the methods 
reported in the GBD 2017 Study. All estimates were presented as counts and 
age-standardised rates per 100 000 population, with uncertainty intervals (UIs).
RESULTS: Globally, the age-standardised point prevalence and annual incidence 
rate of OA in 2017 were 3754.2 (95% UI 3389.4 to 4187.6) and 181.2 (95% UI 162.6 
to 202.4) per 100 000, an increase of 9.3% (95% UI 8% to 10.7%) and 8.2% (95% UI 
7.1% to 9.4%) from 1990, respectively. In addition, global age-standardised YLD 
rate in 2017 was 118.8 (95% UI 59.5 to 236.2), an increase of 9.6% (95% UI 8.3% 
to 11.1%) from 1990. The global prevalence was higher in women and increased 
with age, peaking at the >95 age group among women and men in 2017. Generally, a 
positive association was found between the age-standardised YLD rate and SDI at 
the regional and national levels. Age-standardised prevalence of OA in 2017 
ranged from 2090.3 to 6128.1 cases per 100 000 population. United States (6128.1 
(95% UI 5729.3 to 6582.9)), American Samoa (5281 (95% UI 4688 to 5965.9)) and 
Kuwait (5234.6 (95% UI 4643.2 to 5953.6)) had the three highest levels of 
age-standardised prevalence. Oman (29.6% (95% UI 24.8% to 34.9%)), Equatorial 
Guinea (28.6% (95% UI 24.4% to 33.7%)) and the United States 23.2% (95% UI 16.4% 
to 30.5%)) showed the highest increase in the age-standardised prevalence during 
1990-2017.
CONCLUSIONS: OA is a major public health challenge. While there is remarkable 
international variation in the prevalence, incidence and YLDs due to OA, the 
burden is increasing in most countries. It is expected to continue with 
increased life expectancy and ageing of the global population. Improving 
population and policy maker awareness of risk factors, including overweight and
