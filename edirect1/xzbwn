BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated strongly with an increased 
risk of micro- and macro-vascular complications, leading to impaired quality of 
life and shortened life expectancy. In addition to appropriate glycemic control, 
multi-factorial intervention for a wide range of risk factors, such as 
hypertension and dyslipidemia, is crucial for management of diabetes. A recent 
cardiovascular outcome trial in diabetes patients with higher cardiovascular 
risk demonstrated that a SGLT2 inhibitor markedly reduced mortality, but not 
macro-vascular events. However, to date there is no clinical evidence regarding 
the therapeutic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on arteriosclerosis. The ongoing 
PROTECT trial was designed to assess whether the SGLT2 inhibitors, 
ipragliflozin, prevented progression of carotid intima-media thickness in 
Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: A total of 480 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus with a HbA1c 
between 6 and 10 % despite receiving diet/exercise therapy and/or standard 
anti-diabetic agents for at least 3 months, will be randomized systematically 
(1:1) into either ipragliflozin or control (continuation of conventional 
therapy) groups. After randomization, ipragliflozin (50-100 mg once daily) will 
be added on to the background therapy in participants assigned to the 
ipragliflozin group. The primary endpoint of the study is the change in mean 
intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery from baseline to 24 months. 
Images of carotid intima-media thickness will be analyzed at a central core 
laboratory in a blinded manner. The key secondary endpoints include the change 
from baseline in other parameters of carotid intima-media thickness, various 
metabolic parameters, and renal function. Other cardiovascular functional tests 
are also planned for several sub-studies.
DISCUSSION: The PROTECT study is the first to assess the preventive effect of 
ipragliflozin on progression of carotid atherosclerosis using carotid 
intima-media thickness as a surrogate marker. The study has potential to clarify 
the protective effects of ipragliflozin on atherosclerosis. Trial registration

BACKGROUND: After the financial crisis of 2008, increasing numbers of nurses 
from Spain are going abroad to work.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the health and workforce policy trends in Spain between 
2009 and 2014 and to analyze their correlation with the migration of nurses.
DESIGN: Single embedded case study.
DATA SOURCES: We examined data published by: Health Statistics, Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (1996 to 2013); Ministry of Education, 
Culture and Sports (2006 to 2013); Ministry of Employment and Social Security 
(2009 to 2014); Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality (1997 to 2014); 
and National Institute of Statistics (1976 to 2014). In addition to reviewing 
the scholarly literature on the topic in Spanish and English, we also examined 
Spanish mobility laws and European directives.
POPULATION: We used the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
definition of "professionally active nurses" which defines practising nurses and 
other nurses as those for whom their education is a prerequisite for employment 
as a nurse. Moreover, we used the term "nursing graduate" as defined by Spanish 
Ministry of Education to describe those who have obtained a recognized 
qualification in nursing in a given year, the term "registered nurses" is 
defined by Spanish law as nurses registered in the Nurses Associations and 
"unemployed nurses" are those without work and registered as seeking employment.
RESULTS: A transformation of the Spanish health system has reduced the number of 
employed nurses per capita since 2010. Moreover, reductions in public spending, 
labour market reforms and widespread unemployment have affected nurses in two 
ways: first by increasing the number of applicants per vacancy between 2009 and 
2013, and second, by an increase in casual positions. However, despite the poor 
job market and decreasing job security, the number of registered nurses and 
nursing graduates in Spain per year has continued to grow, increasing the 
pressure on the labour market.
CONCLUSIONS: Spain is transforming from a stable nursing labour market, to one 
that is increasingly producing nurses for foreign markets, principally in 
Europe. With its low birth rate, increased life expectancy and increasing rates 
of chronic disease, it is critical for Spain to have sufficient nurses now and 
into the future. It is important that there be continued study of this 
phenomenon by Spanish policy makers, health service providers and educators in 
order for Spain to develop health human resources policies that address the 
health care needs of the Spanish population.

BACKGROUND: The update of the global burden of disease attributable to the 
environment is presented. The study focuses on modifiable risks to show the 
potential health impact from environmental interventions.
METHODS: Systematic literature reviews on 133 diseases and injuries were 
performed. Comparative risk assessments were complemented by more limited 
epidemiological estimates, expert opinion and information on disease 
transmission pathways. Population attributable fractions were used to calculate 
global deaths and global disease burden from environmental risks.
RESULTS: Twenty-three percent (95% CI: 13-34%) of global deaths and 22% (95% CI: 
13-32%) of global disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were attributable to 
environmental risks in 2012. Sixty-eight percent of deaths and 56% of DALYs 
could be estimated with comparative risk assessment methods. The global disease 
burden attributable to the environment is now dominated by noncommunicable 
diseases. Susceptible ages are children under five and adults between 50 and 75 
years. Country level data are presented.
CONCLUSIONS: Nearly a quarter of global disease burden could be prevented by 
reducing environmental risks. This analysis confirms that eliminating hazards 
and reducing environmental risks will greatly benefit our health, will 
contribute to attaining the recently agreed Sustainable Development Goals and 
will systematically require intersectoral collaboration to be successful.

Health Improvements Have Been More Rapid and Widespread in China than in India: 
A Comparative Analysis of Health and Socioeconomic Trends from 1960 to 2011.

Health Policy, Global Health and Education Projects, Washington, DC 20018, USA.

Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Columbia, SC 29208, USA.

OBJECTIVES: We examined differences between China and India in key health and 
socioeconomic indicators, including life expectancy, infant and child mortality, 
non-communicable disease mortality from cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), 
and diabetes, Human Development Index, Gender Inequality Index, material living 
conditions, and health expenditure.
METHODS: Data on health and social indicators came from various World Health 
Organization and United Nations databases on global health and development 
statistics, including the GLOBOCAN cancer database. Mortality trends were 
modeled by log-linear regression, and differences in rates and relative risks 
were tested for statistical significance.
RESULTS: Although both countries have made marked improvements, India lags 
behind China on several key health indicators. Differential rates of mortality 
decline during 1960-2009 have led to a widening health gap between China and 
India. In 2009 the infant mortality rate in India was 50 deaths per 1,000 live 
births, 3 times greater than the rate for China. Sixty-six out of 1,000 Indian 
children died before reaching their 5th birthday, compared with 19 children in 
China. China's life expectancy is 9 years longer than India's. Life expectancy 
at birth in India increased from 42 years in 1960 to 65 years in 2009, while 
life expectancy in China increased from 47 years in 1960 to 74 years in 2009. 
Major health concerns for China include high rates of stomach, liver, and lung 
cancer, CVD, and smoking prevalence. Globally, India ranked 90th and China 102nd 
in life satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS AND PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: India's less favorable health 
profile compared to China is largely attributable to its higher rates of 
mortality from communicable diseases and maternal and perinatal conditions. 
Further health gains can be achieved by reducing social inequality, greater 
investments in human development and health services, and by prevention and 
control of chronic-disease risks such as hypertension, smoking, obesity, and 
physical inactivity.

INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is one of the tumors with higher incidence and 
mortality among men in the World. Epidemiological data are influenced by life 
expectancy of population, available diagnostic methods, correct collection of 
data and quality of health services. Screening of the disease is not 
standardized around the World. Up till now there is no consensus about the risks 
versus benefits of early detection. There are still missing data about this 
pathology in Latin America.
OBJECTIVE: to revise current epidemiologic situation and early diagnosis 
policies of prostate cancer in Brazil and Latin America.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline, Cochrane Library and SciELO databases were 
reviewed on the subject of epidemiology and screening of prostate cancer. 
Screening research was performed in websites on national public health 
organizations and Latin America. Screening recommendations were obtained from 
those governmental organizations and from Latin American urological societies 
and compared to the most prominent regulatory agencies and societies of 
specialists and generalists from around the World.
RESULTS: Brazil and Latin America have a special position in relation to 
incidence and mortality of prostate cancer. In Brazil, it occupies the first 
position regarding incidence of cancer in men and the second cause of mortality. 
Central America has the highest rate of mortality of the continent with lower 
incidence/mortality ratios. Screening recommendations are very distinct, mainly 
among regulatory organs and urological societies.
CONCLUSION: prostate cancer epidemiology is an important health public topic. 
Data collection related to incidence and mortality is still precarious, 
especially in less developed countries. It is necessary to follow-up long term 
screening studies results in order to conclude its benefits.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography (PET) provides quantitative 
metabolic information and potential biomarkers of treatment outcome. We aimed to 
determine the prognostic value of early 18F-fluoroethyl-tyrosine (18F-FET) PET 
scans acquired during re-irradiation for recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A phase I clinical trial of re-irradiation of HGG was 
carried out. MRI and 18F-FET PET were used for target delineation and follow-up. 
Images were acquired at baseline, during radiotherapy and 4weeks post-treatment 
and compared by measuring the metabolically active biological tumor volume (BTV) 
and maximal activity (Tmax/B). Correlations with outcomes were assessed by 
multivariate Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included and all patients have died. The 
median overall survival was 7.0 mos. Both baseline BTV and baseline MRI volume 
(necrotic/cystic cavities subtracted) were prognostic for overall survival (OS) 
in multivariate analysis (HR=1.3 p<0.01 and HR=1.3 p<0.01, respectively). Early 
changes in BTV and Tmax/B were observed but they carried no independent 
prognostic information.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline biological tumor volume (BTV) defined by 18F-FET PET was 
prognostic for OS in multivariate analysis, as was MRI volume (necrotic/cystic 
cavities subtracted). Tumor volume may aid in identifying patients whose life 
expectancy is too short to warrant re-irradiation.

CONTEXT: Patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI) (primary AI [PAI], secondary 
AI due to a pituitary disorder [PIT] and congenital adrenal hyperplasia [CAH]) 
have reduced life expectancy; however, the underlying explanation remains 
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate characteristics, comorbidities, and hospitalizations in 
AI patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational.
SETTING AND POPULATION: Using a United States-based national payer database 
comprising of more than 108 million members, strict inclusion criteria including 
diagnostic codes and steroid prescription records were used to identify 10 383 
adults with AI; 1014 with PAI, 8818 with PIT, and 551 with CAH. Patients were 
matched 1:1 to controls, based on age (±5 y), gender, insurance, and region and 
followed for more than 12 months.
INTERVENTION: None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic variables, comorbidities (diabetes mellitus 
[DM] types 1 and 2, depression, anxiety, hyperlipidemia, hypertension) and 
hospitalization incidence.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with AI had higher odds of DM, 
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, depression, and anxiety, ranging from an odds 
ratio (OR) of 1.51 for hyperlipidaemia in PAI to 3.85 for DM in CAH. Odds of 
having DM (OR, 3.85; 95% confidence interval, 2.52-5.90) or anxiety (OR, 2.99; 
95% confidence interval, 2.02-4.42) compared with controls were highest in CAH, 
whereas depression was highest in PAI and PIT (OR, 2.40 and 2.55). ORs of 
hyperlipidaemia and hypertension (OR, 1.98 and 2.24) were highest in the PIT 
cohort. Inpatient admissions were more frequent in PAI (4.64:1; P < .0001) and 
PIT (4.00:1; P < .0001) than controls; infection was the most common cause for 
admission.
CONCLUSION: Patients with AI carry a significant metabolic and psychiatric 
burden, with higher risk of comorbidities and hospital admissions than matched 
controls.

[Advocacy for the establishment of a comprehensive strategy to reduce the 
"burden" of schizophrenic disorders].

This article attempts to identify and put into perspective the different 
approaches that could globally prevent the suffering induced by schizophrenia, 
from the detection of early psychosis to the impact on individual and family 
functioning and emotional health. Schizophrenia causes, at the community level, 
a number of difficult consequences and associated costs, which likely could be 
reduced if specific strategies, already known and documented internationally, 
were applied. Two areas not explored in this article: the role of medication and 
the issue of suicide prevention. In the scope of screening and early treatment, 
genetic risk, as well as the predictive ability of the clinical criteria for 
individuals at "ultra-high risk" of developing schizophrenia justify an 
increased vigilance for the detection of symptoms in order for treatment to 
begin earlier and to be more effective. These risk factors should not be 
neglected as the benefits of early management impact the course of illness and 
functional outcome. At this stage of the emergence of the disorder, it is 
difficult to systematize a therapeutic protocol. Two options are open to the 
clinician: "wait and watch" given the lack of a conclusive diagnosis and a more 
pro-active intervention, focused on the therapeutic alliance and enhancing 
insight and awareness. The second approach seems more productive but requires 
transparency with the patient and family regarding the uncertainty of the 
clinical situation, and an attitude that favors sharing information, along the 
lines of early psych education. Once a pathological stage is reached, early and 
accurate clinical care is fundamental. They depend heavily on access to care, 
proximity and availability to clinics or out-reach teams, capable of a thorough 
diagnostic work-up. Yet conversely, the availability for early and accurate 
clinical care faces obstacles which are closely related to the pejorative view 
of psychiatry held by the general public, health care professionals, and public 
officials. This poor image of psychiatry is partly due to cases of clinical 
decompensation, dangerous in some instances, underscoring why it is be important 
to understand and anticipate the contributory factors to these outcomes in the 
first place so as to avoid them. In this sense, defending a complacent and 
conciliatory approach can be counter-productive. Following developments of 
recent decades in other chronic diseases (diabetes, cancer, AIDS, severe heart 
disease…), the implementation of systematic clinical programs, treatment 
protocols, psycho-education to reinforce adherence to therapeutic measures, 
their simplification, the support and appreciation of the role of caregivers, 
destigmatizing due to proximity of contact, and therefore an increase in the use 
of care. Similarly, the systematic search for side-effects of medication and 
pro-actively managing to minimize their occurrence strengthen compliance, a 
recognized factor of relapse prevention. Preventable comorbidities, addictions, 
and common physical illnesses are not systematically screened (neoplastic 
diseases, diabetes, hypertension, dental health, gynecology…) in this population 
and thus also represent significant potential for a better life expectancy. The 
tools of psychosocial rehabilitation, unfortunately, are too infrequently used 
in France. Their goal is to improve the functional outcome of patients, a 
determinant of social integration and to lessen the burden shouldered by family 
and other carers, and ultimately to reduce exacerbations of the illness due to 
situations of interpersonal stress. Work has also proven its worth as a 
protective factor, as well as strengthening a sense of self-efficiency, of 
self-esteem, of empowerment, of quality of life, helping attain recovery. It is 
clear that not all social and health care systems are primarily geared towards 
these objectives, although they have at their disposal, by the means described 
above, strong preventive measures for relapses. Beyond the issue of the 
implementation of clinical programs, the existing culture would benefit from 
being infused with a prioritization of resource deployment, with debates of 
these issues regarding parity for mental health services, advocated by users, 
and forging a place, for example, for the intervention of "peer supports", 
sociologists, social workers, interested beyond the disease, in community 
environment, employment opportunities, and housing. Overall, this work argues 
for updating our conceptions of clinical care, supporting the systematic 
implementation of modern models of care, and expanding the scope of our concerns 
regarding patients' lives.

INTRODUCTION: The course of schizophrenia can vary widely, and patients 
experience remission phases alternating with relapse episodes, which generally 
lead to hospitalisation and have a significant impact on the burden of disease. 
The prevalence of schizophrenia in France is estimated to be approximately 
600,000 people, with an incidence of 10,000 new patients per year. Patients with 
schizophrenia represent the largest group of hospitalised patients in French 
public institutions and specialised centres, and the French authorities 
recognise that the management of schizophrenia is a major public health concern. 
The Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) and most of the evidence-based guidelines for 
the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia recommend long-acting injectable 
(LAI) antipsychotics to be used predominantly in the prevention of relapse for 
non-compliant patients; however, in clinical practice, the use of LAIs remains 
low.
OBJECTIVE: This analysis aimed to estimate and to compare the cost-effectiveness 
of the most common antipsychotic strategies in France in the management of 
schizophrenia.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the progression of a cohort of 
patients with schizophrenia through four health states (stable treated, stable 
non-treated, relapse and death) and considered up to three lines of treatment to 
account for changes in treatment management. Antipsychotics including 
aripiprazole LAI (ALAI), olanzapine LAI (OLAI), paliperidone LAI (PLAI), 
risperidone LAI (RLAI), haloperidol decanoate (HD) and oral olanzapine (OO) were 
compared in terms of costs and clinical outcomes. Thus, costs, quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) and number of relapses were assessed over five years based on 
three-month cycles from a French health insurance perspective with a discount 
rate of 4 %. Patients were considered to be stabilised after clinical 
decompensation and would enter the model at an initiation phase, followed by a 
prevention of relapse phase if successful. Data (e.g. relapse or discontinuation 
rates) for the initiation phase came from randomised clinical trials, whereas 
relapse rates in the prevention phase were derived from hospitalisation risks 
based on French real-life data in order to capture adherence effects. Safety and 
utility data were derived from international publications. Additionally costs 
were retrieved from French health insurance databases and publications. 
Robustness of results was assessed through deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: First and second generations of LAIs were found to have similar costs 
over five years; i.e. approximately € 55,000, except for PLAI which was 
associated with a discounted cost of € 50,880. Oral antipsychotics were found to 
be less costly (i.e. OO cost € 50,379 after five years) but associated with a 
lower number of QALYs gained and relapse avoided. PLAI and RLAI were associated 
with the greatest number of QALYs gained; i.e. PLAI dominated ALAI, OLAI and HD 
and was associated with an incremental costs-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
€ 2411 per QALY gained versus OO. Finally, PLAI and OLAI were associated with 
the lowest number of relapses; i.e. PLAI dominated RLAI, ALAI and HLAI and was 
associated with an ICER of € 1782 per avoided relapse compared to OO. OO and HD 
were found to have led to the highest number of relapses.
CONCLUSION: This analysis, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its 
kind to assess the cost-effectiveness of antipsychotics based on French 
observational data. PLAI was associated with the highest probability of being 
the optimal treatment from the French health insurance perspective.

OBJECTIVE: Due to advances in the care of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), 
life expectancy significantly increased, putting this group vulnerable to 
age-related comorbidities, such as cancer. The objective of this study was to 
describe the knowledge of cancer screening (cervical, breast, anal, colon, 
prostate) and other cancer prevention strategies (HPV vaccination, HPV testing) 
among HIV care professionals in Puerto Rico (PR).
METHODS: Cross-sectional study using a sample of 104 HIV healthcare 
professionals in PR. Descriptive analyses were used to characterize the study 
sample. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relation of 
sociodemographic and work-related factors with cancer screening knowledge.
RESULTS: On average, the healthcare professionals interviewed had been working 
for more than 10 years with the HIV/AIDS population (11.5±7.6 years). 
Multivariate analysis showed that physicians had a higher likelihood of having 
extensive knowledge of cervical (OR=3.96; 95% CI=1.23, 12.77) and anal cancer 
(OR=9.4; 95% CI=2.2, 41.0) screening than other healthcare professionals. For 
anal cancer in particular, as the number of years a given participant had been 
working with people living with HIV/AIDS increased, the likelihood that this 
participant would have extensive knowledge of anal cancer screening 
significantly increased (10% year).
CONCLUSION: Health education interventions, tailored to healthcare professionals 
who recently finished their formal education should be developed in HPV-related 
cancers. Such training would improve cancer prevention and control efforts, 
thereby benefitting the HIV population in Puerto Rico.

Modern therapy of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) using pancreatic 
enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) has largely been very effective and has 
greatly helped in improving the nutritional status of patients with PEI and in 
increasing the life expectancy in cystic fibrosis. It is believed that the use 
of predictable large animal models could play an important role in assessing and 
developing new therapies. This article reviews the pancreatic duct ligated 
(adult) minipig as a chronic model of total PEI, with a detailed look at the 
influence of PEI and response to PERT on prececal compared to fecal 
digestibility, to directly investigate effects on protein and starch digestion 
and absorption. In addition, the piglet with PEI is reviewed as a model for PEI 
in young patients with the aim of further improving the therapy and nutritional 
status of young patients with cystic fibrosis.

The questionnaire format applied in a CV study represents the way in which the 
WTP estimates are obtained. Payment scales are often used in CV studies as the 
questionnaire format of choice. The study summarized here analyzes the impact of 
the design of two payment scales (PS) on the monetary value of QALY gains. The 
scales differed in terms of their end-points, mid points, and coarseness. We 
judged the performance of the two PS against several indicators: the average WTP 
per QALY estimates, post-estimation uncertainty levels, the existence of 
mid-point concentration, and the dependency on end-points. Our results show that 
PS design influences respondents' WTP values. The results also suggest that a 
more detailed scale with a more realistic range may help respondents to elicit 
values closer to their "true" WTP values, hence produce higher-quality outcomes. 
Further research and pretesting strategies are suggested to explore and minimize 
the effects of PS design on WTP estimates, which may ultimately increase the 
quality of WTP estimates.

OBJECTIVES: Herpes zoster (HZ) is characterized by a painful skin rash. Its main 
complication is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), pain persisting or occurring after 
the rash onset. HZ treatment aims to reduce acute pain, impede the onset 
complications, and disease progression. The aim of this study was to assess the 
cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination compared with no vaccination strategy, 
within the Italian context.
METHODS: The natural history of HZ and PHN was mapped through a Markov model 
with lifetime horizon. A population of patients aged between 60 and 79 years was 
hypothesized. Third party payer (Italian National Health Service, I-NHS) and 
societal perspectives were adopted. Data were derived from literature.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the 
vaccination equaled EUR 11,943 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) under the 
I-NHS perspective and EUR 11,248 per QALY under the societal perspective. 
Considering a cost-effectiveness threshold of EUR 30,000/QALY, the multi-way 
sensitivity analysis showed that vaccination is cost-effective regardless of the 
perspective adopted, in 99 percent of simulations.

OBJECTIVES: We explore how broader aspects of a treatment's value and the impact 
of the condition on patients not captured by routine health technology 
assessment (HTA) methods using clinical and economic evidence, defined as "other 
considerations," may influence HTA processes in different settings.
METHODS: Countries included were England, Scotland, Sweden, and France. Data 
sources were the publicly available reports on HTA recommendations. Ten drugs 
with European Medicines Agency orphan designation and appraised in England were 
selected. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to systematically identify and 
code all "other considerations" based on a previously developed methodological 
framework, which also coded whether it was provided by stakeholders, and how it 
influenced the decision.
RESULTS: A classification framework of scientific and social value judgments was 
developed and used throughout the study. A total of 125 "other considerations" 
were identified and grouped into ten subcategories based on the information 
provided. Eighteen to 100 percent of these, depending on the agency, were put 
forward as one of the main reasons for the final decision potentially 
contributing to accepting a higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratio or 
uncertain evidence. Some of these were nonquantified or nonelicited and 
pertained to the assessor's judgment. A taxonomy of these value judgments was 
created to be used in future cases. Results also contributed to better defining 
the determinants of social value and improving accountability for 
reasonableness.
CONCLUSIONS: The systematic identification of the scientific and social value 
judgments enables to better understanding the dimensions of value, which can be 
used to improve their transparency and consistent use across decisions and 
settings.

BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing allows women to self-collect 
cervico-vaginal cells at home (i.e., self-sampling). Using primary data from a 
randomized pilot study, we evaluated the long-term consequences and 
cost-effectiveness of using self-sampling to improve participation to routine 
cervical cancer screening in Norway.
METHODS: We compared a strategy reflecting screening participation (using 
reminder letters) to strategies that involved mailing self-sampling device kits 
to women noncompliant to screening within a 5- or 10-year period under two 
scenarios: (A) self-sampling respondents had moderate under-screening histories, 
or (B) respondents to self-sampling had moderate and severe under-screening 
histories. Model outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and 
lifetime costs. The "most cost-effective" strategy was identified as the 
strategy just below $100,000 per QALY gained.
RESULTS: Mailing self-sampling device kits to all women noncompliant to 
screening within a 5- or 10-year period can be more effective and less costly 
than the current reminder letter policy; however, the optimal self-sampling 
strategy was dependent on the profile of self-sampling respondents. For example, 
"10-yearly self-sampling" is preferred ($95,500 per QALY gained) if "5-yearly 
self-sampling" could only attract moderate under-screeners; however, "5-yearly 
self-sampling" is preferred if this strategy could additionally attract severe 
under-screeners.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted self-sampling of noncompliers likely represents good 
value-for-money; however, the preferred strategy is contingent on the screening 
histories and compliance of respondents.
IMPACT: The magnitude of the health benefit and optimal self-sampling strategy 
is dependent on the profile and behavior of respondents. Health authorities 
should understand these factors prior to selecting and implementing a 
self-sampling policy. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(1); 95-103. ©2016

Stormwater ponds are installed in urban developments to provide the ecosystem 
services of flood control and water treatment. In coastal areas, these ponds are 
connected to watersheds that can drain directly into protected estuaries, making 
their design, function, and maintenance critical to environmental protection. 
However, stormwater ponds in residential areas are increasingly managed as 
aesthetic amenities that add value to real estate rather than as engineered 
devices with special maintenance requirements. To help extend the life of 
neighborhood stormwater systems and improve ecosystem services, homeowners 
should follow best management practices for nutrient management and add 
shoreline plantings and non-invasive, beneficial aquatic plants to their ponds. 
This study used focus group and survey research to document the knowledge, 
behaviors, and attitudes of homeowners living near stormwater ponds in a 
master-planned community in Florida. The study was designed to use a social 
marketing research approach to promote Extension best practices. Findings 
indicate that many residents were aware of the functional components of 
stormwater systems and respondents' receptivity to best management practices was 
mediated by age, their attitudes about water quality and whether their home was 
adjacent to a pond. These findings can be used to target Extension audiences and 
improve adoption of stormwater pond best management practices for increased 
protection of water quality.

Few groups in the United States (US) are as heavily affected by HIV as men who 
have sex with men (MSM), yet many MSM remain unaware of their infection. HIV 
diagnosis is important for decreasing onward transmission and promoting 
effective treatment for HIV, but the cost-effectiveness of testing programs is 
not well-established. This study reports on the costs and cost-utility of the 
MSM Testing Initiative (MTI) to newly diagnose HIV among MSM and link them to 
medical care. Cost and testing data in 15 US cities from January 2013 to March 
2014 were prospectively collected and combined to determine the cost-utility of 
MTI in each city in terms of the cost per Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) 
saved from payer and societal perspectives. The total venue-based HIV testing 
costs ranged from $18,759 to $564,284 for nine to fifteen months of MTI 
implementation. The cost-saving threshold for HIV testing of MSM was $20,645 per 
new HIV diagnosis. Overall, 27,475 men were tested through venue-based MTI, of 
whom 807 (3 %) were newly diagnosed with HIV. These new diagnoses were 
associated with approximately 47 averted HIV infections. The cost per QALY saved 
by implementation of MTI in each city was negative, indicating that MTI 
venue-based testing was cost-saving in all cities. The cost-utility of social 
network and couples testing strategies was, however, dependent on whether the 
programs newly diagnosed MSM. The cost per new HIV diagnosis varied considerably 
across cities and was influenced by both the local cost of MSM testing 
implementation and by the seropositivity rate of those reached by the HIV 
testing program. While the cost-saving threshold for HIV testing is highly 
achievable, testing programs must successfully reach undiagnosed HIV-positive 
individuals in order to be cost-effective. This underscores the need for HIV 
testing programs which target and engage populations such as MSM who are most 
likely to have undiagnosed HIV to maximize programmatic benefit and 
cost-utility.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Poststroke cognitive impairment occurs frequently in 
young patients with ischemic stroke (18 through 50 years of age). Accumulating 
data suggest that stroke is associated with lower white matter integrity remote 
from the stroke impact area, which might explain why some patients have good 
long-term cognitive outcome and others do not. Given the life expectancy of 
decades in young patients, we therefore investigated remote white matter in 
relation to long-term cognitive function.
METHODS: We included all consecutive first-ever ischemic stroke patients, 
left/right hemisphere, without recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack 
during follow-up, aged 18 through 50 years, admitted to our university medical 
center between 1980 and 2010. One hundred seventeen patients underwent magnetic 
resonance imaging scanning including a T1-weighted scan, a diffusion tensor 
imaging scan, and completed a neuropsychological assessment. Patients were 
compared with a matched stroke-free control group (age, sex, and education 
matched). Cognitive impairment was defined as >1.5 SD below the mean cognitive 
index score of controls and no cognitive impairment as ≤1 SD. Tract-Based 
Spatial Statistics was used to assess the white matter integrity (fractional 
anisotropy and mean diffusivity).
RESULTS: About 11 years after ischemic stroke, lower remote white matter 
integrity was associated with a worse long-term cognitive performance. A lower 
remote white matter integrity, even in the contralesional hemisphere, was 
observed in cognitively impaired patients (n=25) compared with cognitively 
unimpaired patients (n=71).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that although stroke has an acute onset, it 
might have long lasting effects on remote white matter integrity and thereby 
increases the risk of long-term cognitive impairment.

The Role of Bacterial Secretion Systems in the Virulence of Gram-Negative Airway 
Pathogens Associated with Cystic Fibrosis.

Depluverez S(1), Devos S(1), Devreese B(1).

Author information:

of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Ghent University Ghent, Belgium.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal inherited disorder in Caucasians. 
It is caused by mutation of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 
gene. A defect in the CFTR ion channel causes a dramatic change in the 
composition of the airway surface fluid, leading to a highly viscous mucus 
layer. In healthy individuals, the majority of bacteria trapped in the mucus 
layer are removed and destroyed by mucociliary clearance. However, in the lungs 
of patients with CF, the mucociliary clearance is impaired due to dehydration of 
the airway surface fluid. As a consequence, patients with CF are highly 
susceptible to chronic or intermittent pulmonary infections, often causing 
extensive lung inflammation and damage, accompanied by a decreased life 
expectancy. This mini review will focus on the different secretion mechanisms 
used by the major bacterial CF pathogens to release virulence factors, their 
role in resistance and discusses the potential for therapeutically targeting 
secretion systems.

The role of the cilium in hereditary tumor predisposition syndromes.

Klasson TD(1), Giles RH(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, University Medical Center Utrecht, 
Utrecht, The Netherlands.

The primary cilium is a highly conserved cell organelle that is closely 
connected to processes involved in cell patterning and replication. Amongst 
their many functions, cilia act as "signal towers" through which cell-cell 
signaling cascades pass. Dysfunction of cilia or the myriad processes that are 
connected with cilium function can lead to disease. Due to the sheer number of 
cellular processes that at some point involve the primary cilium, the effects of 
misregulation are highly heterogeneous between different cell populations. 
However, because of the importance of primary cilia in the development, growth, 
patterning and orientation of cells and tissues, a common thread has emerged in 
which defective cilia can lead to disorganization, which can contribute to the 
growth of neoplasms, including cancer and pre-cancerous phenotypes. Because 
cilia are so vital for signaling during cell replication and the cell fate 
decisions that are important in childhood growth, symptoms often arise early in 
life. Here we review recent work connecting misregulation of the primary cilium 
with tumor formation in a variety of tissues in the developing body, with a 
particular focus on the syndromes in which classic tumor genes are mutated,
