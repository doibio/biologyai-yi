for the patient and family with five sub-themes, 2) 'Passing the baton' - the 
importance of collaboration across the health system with four sub-themes, and 
3) Avoiding new hospitalization by establishing collaboration and competence 
within primary health care with four sub-themes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that optimum palliative care at home 
depends on close collaboration and dialogue between the patient, family, home 
care nurses and general practitioner. It suggests the need for safer discharge 
routines and planning when hospitals transfer patients with terminal disease to 
their homes. A good start for the patient and family, where the initial 
interdisciplinary collaboration meeting takes place in the patient's home, is 
crucial for a good result. The general practitioners' perception of their 
'disconnection' during hospitalization and prior to discharge has the potential 
to reduce patient safety. The family seems to be fundamental in gaining more 
time at home for the patient and supporting the patient to eventually die at 
home. Home-based palliative care demands experience and competence as well as 
regular supportive mentoring.

Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) refers to the initial clinical episode with 
symptoms suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS). Due to limited number of 
long-term follow-up studies, progression pattern from CIS to more advanced 
stages remains unclear. In the current study, we constructed a Markov model to 
simulate the natural course of CIS. The model estimated the probabilities of 
transition from CIS to more advanced disease stages and the duration needed for 
the progression. The analysis showed: (1) CIS is a solid disease identity: more 
than 85% of the subjects with a diagnosis of CIS progress to RRMS or more 
advanced stages within 20 years; (2) the reduction of life expectancy in 
subjects with CIS is marginal.

A Gram-stain negative, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated 
2-56T, was isolated from water and characterized taxonomically using a 
polyphasic approach. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that 
strain 2-56T belongs to the family Flavobacteriaceae in the phylum Bacteroidetes 
and is closely related to Flavobacterium paronense KNUS1T (98.4%) and 
Flavobacterium collinsense 4-T-2T (96.7%). The G + C content of the genomic DNA 
of strain 2-56T was 33.4 mol%. The isolate contained MK-6 as the predominant 
respiratory quinone, and iso-C15:1 G (15.9%), iso-C15:0 (15.8%), iso-C17:0 3-OH 
(10.7%), and iso-C15:0 3-OH (9.6%) were the major fatty acids. The major polar 
lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified lipid. The phenotypic 
and chemotaxonomic data support the affiliation of strain 2-56T with the genus 
Flavobacterium. However, the DNA-DNA relatedness between the isolate and F. 
paronense and F. collinsense were 35.7 and 21.5%, respectively, clearly showing 
that strain 2-56T is not related to them at the species level. Strain 2-56T 
could be clearly differentiated from its close neighbours on the basis of its 
phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic features. Therefore, strain 2-56T 
represents a novel species of the genus Flavobacterium, for which the name 
Flavobacterium knui sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 2-56T (= KCTC 
62061T = JCM 32247T).

PURPOSE: Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for 
the assessment of clinical outcomes, long-term extension trials (LTEs) and 
observational cohorts may help generate evidence. Our goal was to compare the 
discontinuation rates of abatacept, rituximab, and tocilizumab in rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) reported in different study designs.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted with searches in PubMed, Scopus, and 
the Cochrane Library, plus a manual search, for RCTs, LTEs, and observational 
cohorts reporting discontinuation rates by any of three causes (all-cause, 
inefficacy, adverse events). Meta-analyses with sensitivity analyses and 
meta-regressions were conducted.
RESULTS: Of the 111 studies included, 74 were RCTs (n = 55) or LTEs (n = 17) 
reporting data on abatacept (n = 33), rituximab (n = 10), and tocilizumab 
(n = 31) and 37 were observational cohort studies (abatacept = 11, 
rituximab = 8, tocilizumab = 18). The follow-up duration did not differ among 
the study designs. Discontinuation rates were similar among the drugs but varied 
among the study designs. Discontinuation rates were significantly higher in 
cohort studies than those in interventional studies for the three drugs. 
Sensitivity analyses could not identify patient characteristics associated with 
these differences. Meta-regression analyses demonstrated no correlation between 
study follow-up duration and discontinuation rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The discontinuation rates reported for non-anti-TNF drugs varied 
relative to the study design in which they were investigated. Regulatory 
agencies, price-setting entities, and evidence-gathering researchers should 
consider the effect of the real-life environment in their decisions and 
conclusions.

Author information:
(1)a Capital Health Primary Care Brunswick , Trenton , New Jersey.

Background and Problem Statement: Obesity is a prevalent chronic disease 
associated with decreased life expectancy, increased morbidity and mortality, 
and escalating health care costs.
PURPOSE: To explore perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors toward obesity 
management by providers in primary care.
METHOD: Data were collected through a descriptive qualitative design using 
semi-structured face-to-face interviews at primary care practices.
RESULTS: Common barriers to obesity management were identified and three major 
themes emerged; provider centered obstacles, perceived organizational obstacles, 
and provider perception of patient obstacles.
CONCLUSION: Obesity is not being effectively managed in these primary care 
practices and three common themes/obstacles must be addressed.

Findings about predictors of chronic lower-back pain (CLBP) were inconsistent 
and inconclusive in previous studies because patients with CLBP are 
heterogeneous. Subgrouping patients with CLBP, according to a CLBP 
classification system, might thus clarify the research findings. CLBP in the 
direction of lumbar flexion movement, that is, the flexion pattern, is common in 
clinical situations. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the 
predictors of dysfunction (pain, disability) and health-related quality of life 
in the flexion pattern subgroup of patients with CLBP.A cross-sectional study of 
prospectively collected data. One hundred eight subjects in the flexion pattern 
subgroup of CLBP. Thirteen variables were measured: the visual analog scale 
(VAS), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Beck 
Depression Inventory (BDI), hip internal rotation range of motion, hip flexion 
range of motion, knee extension range of motion, knee extension with 
dorsiflexion range of motion, ratio forward flexion, knee extension strength, 
hip extension strength, hip flexion strength, and lumbopelvic stability.The 
models for predictors of lower-back pain in the CLBP flexion pattern subgroup 
included knee extension and the BDI as predictor variables that accounted for 
8.1% of the variance in the VAS (P < .05); predictors for disability included 
the BDI, age, and hip flexion strength, which accounted for 21.2% of the 
variance in the ODI (P < .05); predictors for health-related quality of life 
included the BDI, sex, knee extension with dorsiflexion range of motion, and 
age, which accounted for 38.8% of the variance in the SF-36 (P < .05) in 
multiple regression models with a stepwise selection procedure.The current 
results suggest that knee extension, the BDI, age, hip flexion strength, knee 
extension with dorsiflexion, and sex should be considered when determining 
appropriate prediction, prevention, and intervention in the flexion pattern 
subgroup of patients with CLBP.

INTRODUCTION: Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) results from a permanent 
and progressive destruction of the airways leading to poor lung function. NCFB 
is characterized by recurrent lung infection, sputum production, and cough, 
often requiring long-term antibiotic therapy and hospitalization. At present, 
there are no approved therapies available. Clinical trials of inhaled 
antibiotics have shown promise against sputum bacterial load, but mixed results 
on clinical outcomes. Areas covered: The objective of this review is to provide 
an overview of NCFB and critically evaluate the evidence supporting the outcome 
measures used in recent clinical trials of inhaled antibiotics. These include 
quantitative changes in bacterial load, sputum purulence and yield, inflammatory 
markers, and lung function, as well as clinical changes in exacerbations, 
exacerbation frequency, hospitalizations, and health-related quality of life. 
Expert commentary: Recently completed large trials of inhaled antibiotics in 
NCFB did not consistently meet pre-specified end points, suggesting that we have 
not yet found the best enrollment criteria or outcome measures to evaluate 
efficacy, although reduced exacerbation frequency may be clinically most 
meaningful. Future trials may focus on specific patient populations at high risk 
with new information obtained through analyses of large international patient 
registries.

Malignant melanoma is an aggressive cancer associated with a poor prognosis in 
patients with metastatic disease. As in many other cancers, the incidence of 
melanoma rises with age; and combined with the longer life expectancy, this led 
to an increasing prevalence of melanoma in the older population. Recently, 
immune checkpoint inhibitors significantly improved the treatment of melanoma 
given their efficacy and tolerability profile. Two major classes of agents 
include the anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) 
inhibitors, such as ipilimumab, and the anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1) 
inhibitors, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Treatment of metastatic disease 
with immune checkpoint inhibitors demonstrated improved efficacy and better 
safety profiles compared to cytotoxic drugs and appears to be an attractive 
treatment option. Nevertheless, there is a need for tools designed to better 
predict which older patients will benefit from its use and who will experience 
toxicities related to the treatment. Current data do not show a major increase 
in toxicity rates in older patients. However, patients above 75 are often 
under-represented and those who are included are not representative of the 
general population of older patients, thereby also stressing the need for 
real-life data. Ongoing research is aiming at maximizing the potential treatment 
efficacy and developing novel immune-targeting modalities. Future studies should 
include older patients and assess geriatric domains in these older patients to 
better guide decision-making. This review discusses published clinical trials 
and where known, the efficacy and toxicity in older patients. Moreover, the 
clinical implications and future perspectives are discussed, with current 
recommendations for older patients, management of toxicities, and a proposal for 
an initial approach to the treatment of older patients with metastatic melanoma.

CONTEXT: Patients with end-stage kidney disease have a high mortality rate and 
disease burden. Despite this, many do not speak with health care professionals 
about end-of-life issues. Advance care planning is recommended in this context 
but is complex and challenging. We carried out a realist review to identify 
factors affecting its implementation.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are 1) to identify implementation 
theories; 2) to identify factors that help or hinder implementation; and 3) to 
develop theory on how the intervention may work.
METHODS: We carried out a systematic realist review, searching seven electronic 
databases: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, 
and ScienceDirect.
RESULTS: Sixty-two papers were included in the review.
CONCLUSION: We identified two intervention stages-1) training for health care 
professionals that addresses concerns, optimizes skills, and clarifies processes 
and 2) use of documentation and processes that are simple, individually 
tailored, culturally appropriate, and involve surrogates. These processes work 
as patients develop trust in professionals, participate in discussions, and 
clarify values and beliefs about their condition. This leads to greater 
congruence between patients and surrogates; increased quality of communication 
between patients and professionals; and increased completion of advance 
directives. Advance care planning is hindered by lack of training; 
administrative complexities; pressures of routine care; patients overestimating 
life expectancy; and when patients, family, and/or clinical staff are reluctant 
to initiate discussions. It is more likely to succeed where organizations treat 
it as core business; when the process is culturally appropriate and takes 
account of patient perceptions; and when patients are willing to consider death 
and dying with suitably trained staff.

Animal locomotion is driven by underlying axial and appendicular musculature. In 
order for locomotion to be effective, these muscles must be able to rapidly 
respond to changes in environmental and physiological demands. Although 
virtually unstudied, muscles must also respond to morphological changes, such as 
those that occur with tail autotomy in lizards. Tail autotomy in leopard geckos 
(Eublepharis macularius) results in a 25% loss of caudal mass and significant 
kinematic alterations to maintain stability. To elucidate how motor control of 
the locomotor muscles is modulated with these shifts, we used electromyography 
(EMG) to quantify patterns of in vivo muscle activity in forelimb and hindlimb 
muscles before and after autotomy. Forelimb muscles (biceps brachii and triceps 
brachii) exhibited no changes in motor recruitment, consistent with unaltered 
kinematics after autotomy. The amplitude of activity of propulsive muscles of 
the hindlimbs (caudofemoralis and gastrocnemius) was significantly reduced and 
coincided with decreases in the propulsive phases of femur retraction and ankle 
extension, respectively. The puboischiotibialis did not exhibit these changes, 
despite significant reductions in femur depression and knee angle, suggesting 
that the reduction in mass and vertical ground-reaction force by autotomy allows 
for the maintenance of a more sprawled and stable posture without increasing 
motor recruitment of the support muscles. These results highlight the 
significant neuromuscular shifts that occur to accommodate dramatic changes in 
body size and mass distribution, and illuminate the utility of tail autotomy as 
a system for studying the neuromuscular control of locomotion.

BACKGROUND: The proportion of avoidable hospital deaths is challenging to 
estimate, but has great implications for quality improvement and health policy. 
Many studies and monitoring tools are based on selected high-risk populations, 
which may overestimate the proportion. Mandatory reporting systems, however, 
under-report. We hypothesise that a review of an unselected sample of hospital 
deaths will provide an estimate of avoidability in-between the estimates from 
these methods.
METHODS: A retrospective case record review of an unselected population of 1000 
consecutive non-psychiatric hospital deaths in a Norwegian hospital trust was 
conducted. Reviewers evaluated to what degree each death could have been 
avoided, and identified problems in care.
RESULTS: We found 42 (4.2%) of deaths to be at least probably avoidable (more 
than 50% chance of avoidability). Life expectancy was shortened by at least 
1 year among 34 of the 42 patients with an avoidable death. Patients whose death 
was found to be avoidable were less functionally dependent compared with 
patients in the non-avoidable death group. The surgical department had the 
greatest proportion of such deaths. Very few of the avoidable deaths were 
reported to the hospital's report system.
CONCLUSIONS: Avoidable hospital deaths occur less frequently than estimated by 
the national monitoring tool, but much more frequently than reported through 
mandatory reporting systems. Regular reviews of an unselected sample of hospital 
deaths are likely to provide a better estimate of the proportion of avoidable 
deaths than the current methods.

BACKGROUND: Despite the World Health Organization recommendation of exclusive 
breastfeeding (EBF) for the first six months of life, the rate remains low both 
in developed and developing countries. In Ethiopia, findings regarding the 
prevalence of EBF have been highly variable. Antenatal care and institutional 
delivery are the most important factors contributing to the practice of EBF 
however; their effect has not been investigated in Ethiopia.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, international databases 
were systematically searched. All observational studies reporting the prevalence 
of EBF and its association with antenatal care and institutional delivery in 
Ethiopia were considered. Two authors independently extracted all necessary data 
using a standardized data extraction format. A random effects meta-analysis 
model was computed to estimate the pooled prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding. 
Moreover, the association of antenatal care and institutional delivery with EBF 
was determined.
RESULTS: After reviewing 619 studies, 32 studies fulfilled the inclusion 
criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of EBF in 
Ethiopia was 59.3% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 53.8, 64.8). The subgroup 
analysis indicated that the highest prevalence was observed in Afar region 
(65.6%), followed by SNNP (63.8%), and then by Oromia (61.8%). Additionally, 
mothers who attended antenatal visits were 2.1 times more likely to practice EBF 
compared to their counterparts (Odds Ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% CI 1.5, 2.8). Moreover, 
mothers who gave birth at a health institution were 2.2 times more likely to 
practice EBF compared to mothers who gave birth at home (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3, 
3.5).
CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive breastfeeding in Ethiopia was significantly lower than 
the global recommendations. There was evidence that mothers who attended 
antenatal visits and who gave birth at health institutions had better EBF 
practices. Based on our findings, we strongly recommended that the utilization 
of antenatal care and institutional delivery should be improved through health 
extension workers.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited disorders caused by a mutation 
of the hemoglobin gene, resulting in the formation of abnormal, sickle-shaped 
red blood cells. It is a lifelong condition characterized by anemia, 
vaso-occlusion, and decreased blood flow to vital tissues. Sickle cell disease 
affects every major organ and significantly reduces life expectancy of the 
affected individuals. Patients with SCD are at an increased risk for developing 
musculoskeletal complications that decrease quality of life and contribute to 
the significant burden of the disease. Understanding these complications, as 
well as the genetics, pathophysiology, and epidemiology of SCD, will assist 
orthopaedic nurses in providing evidence-informed care.

INTRODUCTION: Adherence has a key role in treating patients as influences the 
effectiveness of therapeutic treatment for improving overall survival, life 
expectancy, quality of life and reducing healthcare costs. There are gaps in 
identifying indicators to be used to evaluate adherence and ways in which these 
indicators should be adopted. The aim of this paper is to identify adherence's 
indicators in literature.
METHODS: Systematic review was carried out in, Cinhal-EBSCO, Medline-PUBMED and 
Scopus including studies of measure patient's adherence in English and published 
from 2010 to 2016. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were used. The quality of 
the articles was assessed with the NewCastle Ottawa Scale for observational 
studies and the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias for experimental studies.
RESULTS: Of the 7,368 papers initially retrieved, 15 met the inclusion criteria 
(11 observational studies, 4 RCTs), for a total of 1,396 patients. The 
indicators found are: self-report tools, pill counts, drug recharge rate, 
continuous measures, metabolic dosage. A patient is considered adherent to the 
treatment if he or she assumes a percentage of drugs ≥ 80% of the prescribed 
medications.
DISCUSSION: A better adherence rating is obtained by using multiple instruments 
at the same time. The objective indicators derive from the direct measurement 
methods of adherence, the subjective ones from the indirect.

Publisher: INTRODUZIONE. L’indice di aderenza ha un ruolo fondamentale nel 
trattamento dei pazienti poichè influenza notevolmente l’efficacia di un 
trattamento terapeutico in termini di miglioramento della sopravvivenza globale, 
della speranza di vita, della qualità della stessa e di riduzione dei costi 
sanitari. Esistono lacune nell’individuazione degli indicatori da utilizzare per 
valutare l’aderenza e le modalità attraverso cui tali indicatori debbano essere 
adottati. L’obiettivo di questo lavoro è quello di individuare in letteratura 
gli indicatori di aderenza. METODO. Revisione sistematica della letteratura di 
tipo quantitativo effettuata seguendo il metodo PRISMA. La ricerca è stata 
condotta su: Cinhal-EBSCO, Medline-PUBMED e Scopus. Sono stati ricercati studi 
che misurassero l’aderenza dei pazienti al trattamento in lingua inglese e 
pubblicati dal 2010 al 2016. La selezione è stata effettuate utilizzando criteri 
di inclusione ed esclusione. La qualità degli articoli è stata valutata con la 
NewCastle Ottawa Scale per gli studi osservazionali e con la Cochrane 
Collaboration Risk of Bias per gli studi sperimentali. RISULTATI. Sono stati 
ritrovati in totale 7,368 articoli e di questi selezionati 15 (11 studi 
osservazionali, 4 RCT), per un totale di 1,396 pazienti. Gli indicatori 
individuati sono: strumenti self-report, conta pillola, tasso di ricarica del 
farmaco, misure continue, dosaggio dei metaboliti. Un paziente oncologico è 
considerato aderente al trattamento se assume una percentuale di farmaci 
superiore all'80% rispetto ai farmaci prescritti. DISCUSSIONE. Si ottiene una 
valutazione migliore di aderenza mediante l’utilizzo di più strumenti 
contemporaneamente. Gli indicatori oggettivi derivano dall’utilizzo dei metodi 
di misurazione diretta dell’aderenza, quelli soggettivi da quella indiretta. 
PAROLE CHIAVE: self-management support, oral chemioterapy, measure adherence, 
measure compliance.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral treatment has turned HIV infection into a chronic 
condition with a near normal life expectancy and an ageing patient population. 
For a well-defined proportion of these patients, HIV-care could pass from 
specialty care to primary care, especially for prevention and treatment of 
additional chronic diseases. A better understanding of the complex health needs 
of this particular proportion is needed to determine the optimal way to 
integrate specialist and primary care.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to examine the health-seeking behaviour of ageing 
HIV patients. We investigated which physicians they consulted and the reasons 
for encounter. We also explored patients' participation in preventive healthcare 
activities.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective descriptive cohort study among adults, 
60 years of age or older living with HIV, who came for a routine consultation 
visit at the HIV clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) over a 
period of 9 months. Those who met the inclusion criteria were offered a 
self-administered questionnaire. The responses were manually coded, exported 
into Excel and subsequently imported into SPSS for descriptive statistical 
analysis.
RESULTS: We analysed questionnaires from 74 patients, 11 women and 63 men. Since 
their last consultation visit at the ITM, 48 patients consulted their general 
practitioner (GP), 35 patients consulted a specialist and 7 went to the 
emergency department over a period of 6 months. Forty-nine patients (66%) had 
done a faecal occult blood test and 8 women (73% of female patients) had a 
screening mammography in the past 2 years, 8 women (73% of female patients) had 
a PAP smear in the past 3 years. Sixty-three participants (85%) declared that 
their vaccinations were up-to-date. Thirty-eight patients (51%) take 
antihypertensive medication, 35 patients (47%) cholesterol medication and 9 
participants (12%) are on oral antihyperglycemic medication.
CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of patients are seeking healthcare from their GP 
and specialists, other than the HIV specialist. They do so both for curative and 
preventive health needs. This calls for a more structured collaboration between 
the various care providers, whereby communication plays a pivotal role.

BACKGROUND: Our research focuses on the co-creation of value in healthcare with 
reference to a case of hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency 
(C1-INH-HAE). Our work is mainly based on the concept of value co-creation in 
healthcare. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of an alternative 
treatment strategy - self-administration - by focusing on treatment outcomes and 
costs to understand if innovative therapeutic solutions can create value for 
patients and healthcare systems.
METHODS: This paper compares home-based and hospital-based therapeutic 
strategies (independent of treatment type) with a cost minimization analysis. It 
encompasses compliance issues and focuses on both payer and societal 
perspectives, also benefiting from an operationalization of the service-dominant 
logic model for healthcare delivery. Data were collected over a 6-month period 
(August 2014-January 2015) through monthly patient interviews. Archival data 
were used for variable measurement.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine out of 62 patients enrolled in the study, experienced at 
least one HAE attacks, equally distributed between home and hospital-based 
strategies. No evidence of correlation between therapeutic strategy and disease 
severity score (p = 0.351), compliance (p = 0.399), and quality of life 
(p = 0.971), were found. Total direct cost per attack amounts to € 1224 for 
home-based strategy with respect to € 1454 for hospital-based strategy, with a 
savings of € 230. The economic advantage of the home-based strategy almost 
doubles if the societal perspective was considered due to a further savings of 
€169 (less missed work/school days and no travel expenses).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that home-based therapies represent a feasible 
strategy for managing C1-INH-HAE and may result in lower costs and increased 
value for both patients and the healthcare systems. The findings are relevant to 
the debate on and extend the extant literature to provide a broader view of 
value co-creation dynamics for home-based therapies in healthcare and their 
positive effects. The insights are relevant to practitioners and policy makers.

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia and 
several associated biochemical abnormalities. Diabetes leads to multiorgan 
complications that collectively reduce life expectancy. Hematopoietic stem cells 
(HSCs) are nested within bone marrow (BM) niches whence they can be mobilized to 
the peripheral circulation. Clinically, this is done for HSC collection and 
autologous or allogenic transplantation. A great amount of data from basic and 
clinical studies support that diabetic patients are poor HSC mobilizers owing to 
BM remodeling. Dysfunction of the BM shares pathophysiological features and 
pathways with typical chronic diabetic complications that affect other issues 
(e.g. the retina and the kidney). From a clinical perspective, impaired HSC 
mobilization translates into the failure to collect a minimum number of CD34+ 
cells to achieve a safe engraftment after transplantation. Furthermore, blunted 
mobilization is associated with reduced steady-state levels of circulating HSCs, 
which have been consistently described in diabetic patients and associated with 
increased risk of adverse outcomes, including cardiovascular events and death. 
In this review, we discuss the most clinically relevant pharmacological options 
to overcome impaired HSC mobilization in diabetes. These therapeutic strategies 
may result in an improved outcome of diabetic patients undergoing HSC 
transplantation and restore circulating HSC levels, thereby protecting from 
adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is composed of the nuclear envelope, perinuclear 
sheets and a peripheral tubular network. The peripheral ER and mitochondria form 
tight contacts at specific subdomains, which coordinate the functions of the two 
organelles and are required for multiple cellular processes such as Ca2+ 
transfer and apoptosis. However, it is largely unknown how ER morphology and 
ER-mitochondria signaling are dynamically regulated under different 
physiological or pathological conditions such as DNA damage. Here we show that 
the peripheral, tubular ER undergoes significant extension in response to DNA 
damage, and that this process is dependent on p53-mediated transcriptional 
activation of the ER-shaping proteins REEP1, REEP2 and EI24 (alias PIG8). This 
promotes the formation of ER-mitochondria contacts through EI24 and the 
mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC2, facilitates Ca2+ transfer from ER to 
mitochondria and promotes DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Thus, we identify a 
unique DNA damage response pathway involving alterations in ER morphology, 
ER-mitochondria signaling, and apoptosis.

BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are increasingly used for health 
state valuations. However, the values derived from initial DCE studies vary 
widely. We hypothesize that these findings indicate the presence of unknown 
sources of bias that must be recognized and minimized. Against this background, 
we studied whether values derived from a DCE are sensitive to how well the DCE 
design spans the severity range.
METHODS: We constructed an experiment involving three variants of DCE tasks for 
health state valuation: standard DCE, DCE-death, and DCE-duration. For each type 
of DCE, an experimental design was generated under two different conditions, 
enabling a comparison of health state values derived from current best practice 
Bayesian efficient DCE designs with values derived from 'severity-stratified' 
designs that control for coverage of the severity range in health state 
selection. About 3000 respondents participated in the study and were randomly 
assigned to one of the six study arms.
RESULTS: Imposing the severity-stratified restriction had a large effect on 
health states sampled for the DCE-duration approach. The unstratified efficient 
design returned a skewed distribution of selected health states, and this 
introduced bias. The choice probability of bad health states was underestimated, 
and time trade-offs to avoid bad states were overestimated, resulting in too low 
values. Imposing the same restriction had limited effect in the DCE-death 
approach and standard DCE.
CONCLUSION: Variation in DCE-derived values can be partially explained by 
differences in how well selected health states spanned the severity range. 
Imposing a 'severity stratification' on DCE-duration designs is a validity 
requirement.

BACKGROUND: Both dental caries and periodontal disease, as isolated conditions, 
can generate limitations and disabilities with negative repercussions on the 
individual's quality of life, but the combination of both oral diseases has not 
been investigated yet. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the 
combined exposure to dental caries and periodontitis and the impact on oral 
health-related quality of life.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 306 individuals seen in the 
public health services in Feira de Santana, Bahia, Brazil. The individuals were 
divided into three groups: individuals without caries and periodontitis 
(n = 60), those with caries or periodontitis separately (n = 155), and those 
with both caries and periodontitis (n = 91). Information regarding 
sociodemographic, health conditions, behavioral aspects, and health-care 
characteristics were obtained through structured questionnaires. Oral clinical
