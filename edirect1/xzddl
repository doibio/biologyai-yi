Objective: To analyze the trends of mortality and years of life lost (YLL) of 
breast cancer in women in Tianjin and provide references for the development of 
intervention strategies. Methods: The crude mortality rate, standard mortality 
rate, cumulative rate (0-74 years old) and truncated rate (35-64 years old) of 
breast cancer in women in Tianjin from 1999 to 2017 were calculated. The annual 
percentage change of the mortality rate and YLL rate were analyzed by Joinpoint 
regression. Results: From 1999 to 2017, a total of 8 356 deaths of breast cancer 
were reported in Tianjin, resulting in a YLL of 262 835.53 person-years. The 
average crude mortality rate was 9.15/100 000. The average age standardized 
rate(ASR) (World) was 6.14/100 000. The ratio of ASR (World) between urban and 
rural areas was 1.73∶1. The peak mortality ratio of age groups between urban 
area and rural area was 3.13∶1. From 1999 to 2017, both the crude mortality rate 
and ASR of breast cancer in Tianjin had rising trends. In 2017, the crude 
mortality rate and the ASR of breast cancer increased by 113.7% and 44.4% 
respectively compared with 1999. The increase of urban mortality mainly came 
from elderly group aged ≥75 years, and the mortality of young age groups in 
rural area showed an fast increases, which was most obvious in age group 45-59 
years (average annual percentage change=3.6%, P<0.01). Conclusions: The 
mortality rate of breast cancer and disease burden in women in Tianjin are still 
in rapid increase. We should continue to implement the prevention and control 
strategies such as lifestyle intervention and screening of key groups. More 
attention need to be paid to the increase of breast cancer incidence in rural 
area.

Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are chromosomal stretches that in a diploid genome 
appear in a homozygous state and display identical alleles at multiple 
contiguous loci. This study aimed to systematically compare the genomic 
distribution of the ROH islands among five populations of wild vs commercial 
chickens of both layer and broiler type. To this end, we analyzed whole genome 
sequences of 115 birds including white layer (WL, n = 25), brown layer (BL, n = 
25), broiler line A (BRA, n = 20), broiler line B (BRB, n = 20) and Red 
Junglefowl (RJF, n = 25). The ROH segments varied in size markedly among 
populations, ranging from 0.3 to 21.83 Mb reflecting their past genealogy. White 
layers contained the largest portion of the genome in homozygous state with an 
average ROH length of 432.1 Mb (±18.7) per bird, despite carrying it in short 
segments (0.3-1 Mb). Population-wise inbreeding measures based on Wright's (Fis) 
and genomic (FROH) metrics revealed highly inbred genome of layer lines relative 
to the broilers and Red Junglefowl. We further revealed the ROH islands, among 
commercial lines overlapped with QTL related to limb development (GREM1, MEOX2), 
body weight (Meis2a.1, uc_338), eggshell color (GLCCI1, ICA1, UMAD1), antibody 
response to Newcastle virus (ROBO2), and feather pecking. Comparison of ROH 
landscape in sequencing resolution demonstrated that a sizable portion of genome 
of commercial lines segregates in homozygote state, reflecting many generations 
of assortative mating and intensive selection in their recent history. In 
contrary, wild birds carry shorter ROH segments, likely suggestive of older 
evolutionary events.

BACKGROUND: The Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends 
universal vaccination against pertussis in pregnancy. We assessed the 
cost-effectiveness of vaccination with tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis 
(Tdap) vaccine in pregnancy in Canada.
METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis comparing a vaccination program to 
no program corresponding with the 2017 Canadian guideline for economic 
evaluation from the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health. We 
developed 2 models - part decision tree, part Markov model - to estimate the 
long-term cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for pregnant women and 
their infants. We obtained epidemiologic data from 2006 to 2015, and derived 
costs and utility values from relevant sources. Results were reported in 2019 
Canadian dollars. We obtained expected values through probabilistic analysis, 
with methodologic and structural uncertainty assessed through scenario analyses. 
The analysis adopted an acquisition price of Tdap vaccine of $12.50, with 
scenario analysis conducted to identify the threshold price for vaccination to 
be cost-effective.
RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, for every 1000 pregnant women vaccinated, 
the program would lead to a gain of 0.3 QALYs, occurring solely in infants, at 
an increased total cost of $12 987, or $44 301 per QALY gained. Based on a 
threshold of $50 000 per QALY gained, vaccination would have been cost-effective 
in 6 of the 10 years included in the model (range of incremental costs $20 
463-$100 348 per QALY gained). The threshold cost for Tdap vaccine to be 
cost-effective over the 10-year horizon was $14.03.
INTERPRETATION: Based on a threshold of $50 000 per QALY gained, vaccination 
against pertussis in pregnancy would be cost-effective if the acquisition cost 
per vaccine were $14.03 or less. Province- and territory-specific analyses 
should be done to inform local decision-making.

Maize is the food crop with the highest total output in the world. However, corn 
bran is only a by-product with low price. The 5,5'-diferulic acid glucoside 
esters (DFG) were obtained from corn bran using the enzymatic method. DFG showed 
obvious antioxidant capacity in cell, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and in 
mouse. DFG decreased ROS and MDA content in 500 μM H2 O2 stimulated ARPE-19 
cells to 48.6% and 32.2%, respectively. DFG decreased ROS content in C. elegans 
to 49.1% and MDA content in acute ethanol (50%, 12 ml/kg) stimulated mouse to 
30.4%. DFG also increased SOD protein content significantly in cell, C. elegans 
and mouse to 175.5%, 120.1%, and 126.2%, respectively. DFG significantly 
extended the lifespan of C. elegans both under heat stress and natural 
situation. The median survival time was prolonged to 133.3% and 116.7%, 
respectively. This capacity relied on the SIR-2.1 activity. SIR-2.1 is an 
ortholog of human Sirtuin-1 (SIRT-1). DFG also upregulated SIRT-1 and PCG-1α 
expression level obviously in H2 O2 -stimulated ARPE-19 cells (to 134.4% and 
127.1%, respectively) and in acute ethanol stimulated mouse eyes (to 135.1% and 
111.5%, respectively) and liver (to 123.3% and 113.6%, respectively). These 
results indicate that DFG has multiple bioactivities. Our research provides a 
new application prospect of corn bran. And to our best knowledge, this is the 
first time, the sirtuins-relied lifespan extension activity of the 
5,5'-diferulic acid extracted from corn bran was reported. PRACTICAL 
APPLICATIONS: The traditional method for extracting diferulic acid from corn 
bran is to use the strong alkali. Obviously, this is not welcomed by the food 
industry. We employed the biological enzyme method in a relatively mild pH range 
during the extraction process. It is more environmentally friendly and more 
economical. DFG can be added as a raw material for functional foods like yogurt, 
fruit juice, and cereals. As well, the solid precipitate obtained after 
extraction can also be used as high-quality dietary fiber to produce functional 
food. Meanwhile, concerning for the 5,5'-diferulic acid derived from corn bran, 
the relevant research is still not abundant. And to our best knowledge, we have 
reported for the first time about the effect of this kinds of diferulic acid on 
prolonging life span and its SIRT-1-dependent activity. It also provides a new 
perspective for the study of diferulic acid.

Diabetic foot ulcers are prevalent among patients with diabetes and negatively 
affect mortality and life expectancy. This study aimed to synthesize and 
systematically review the best evidence to assess the efficacy of low-level 
light therapy in improving healing of diabetic foot ulcers. We search CINAHL, 
Cochrane Library, EMBASE, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from 
inception until September 30, 2019. Meta-analysis was performed using the 
Comprehensive Meta-analysis 3.0 software. Overall effect was measured using 
Hedges' g and determined using the Z-statistic at a significance level of P 
< .05. Heterogeneity was assessed using χ2 and I2 statistics. Twelve randomized 
controlled trials were included. Meta-analysis revealed that 30.90% of the ulcer 
area was significantly reduced in the therapy group compared with the control 
group (Z = 3.95, P < .001) with a very large effect (g = 2.81). A 4.2 cm2 
reduction of the ulcer area was observed in the therapy group compared with the 
control group (Z = 2.17, P = .03) with a very large effect (g = 1.37). In 
addition, diabetic foot ulcers in the therapy group was 4.65 times more likely 
to heal completely than those in the control group (Z = 3.02, P = .003). 
Low-level light therapy accelerates wound healing and reduces the size of 
diabetic foot ulcers. However, our review does not allow any recommendation for 
the best treatment parameters required to achieve improved healing. Future 
trials need to include a good design and large sample size in defining the 
optimal treatment parameters for ulcers of different sizes.

Chronic-wasting disease (CWD) is a prion-derived fatal neurodegenerative disease 
that has affected wild cervid populations on a global scale. Susceptibility has 
been linked unambiguously to several amino acid variants within the prion 
protein gene (PRNP). Quantifying their distribution across landscapes can 
provide critical information for agencies attempting to adaptively manage CWD. 
Here we attempt to further define management implications of PRNP polymorphism 
by quantifying the contemporary geographic distribution (i.e., phylogeography) 
of PRNP variants in hunter-harvested white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus 
virginianus, N = 1433) distributed across Arkansas (USA), including a focal spot 
for CWD since detection of the disease in February 2016. Of these, PRNP variants 
associated with the well-characterized 96S non-synonymous substitution showed a 
significant increase in relative frequency among older CWD-positive cohorts. We 
interpreted this pattern as reflective of a longer life expectancy for 96S 
genotypes in a CWD-endemic region, suggesting either decreased probabilities of 
infection or reduced disease progression. Other variants showing statistical 
signatures of potential increased susceptibility, however, seemingly reflect an 
artefact of population structure. We also showed marked heterogeneity across the 
landscape in the prevalence of 'reduced susceptibility' genotypes. This may 
indicate, in turn, that differences in disease susceptibility among WTD in 
Arkansas are an innate, population-level characteristic that is detectable 
through phylogeographic analysis.

Policy Points Explanations for the troubling trend in US life expectancy since 
the 1980s should be grounded in the dynamic changes in policies and political 
landscapes. Efforts to reverse this trend and put US life expectancy on par with 
other high-income countries must address those factors. Of prime importance are 
the shifts in the balance of policymaking power in the United States, the 
polarization of state policy contexts, and the forces behind those changes.

IMPORTANCE: Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal condition, and average 
life expectancy has increased substantially, from 25 years in 1983 to 60 years 
in 2020. Despite the unique clinical comorbidities among adults with Down 
syndrome, there are no clinical guidelines for the care of these patients.
OBJECTIVE: To develop an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for adults 
with Down syndrome.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: The Global Down Syndrome Foundation Medical Care Guidelines for 
Adults with Down Syndrome Workgroup (n = 13) developed 10 
Population/Intervention/ Comparison/Outcome (PICO) questions for adults with 
Down syndrome addressing multiple clinical areas including mental health (2 
questions), dementia, screening or treatment of diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, obesity, osteoporosis, atlantoaxial instability, thyroid disease, and 
celiac disease. These questions guided the literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
PubMed, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, and the TRIP Database, searched from 
January 1, 2000, to February 26, 2018, with an updated search through August 6, 
2020. Using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and 
Evaluation) methodology and the Evidence-to-Decision framework, in January 2019, 
the 13-member Workgroup and 16 additional clinical and scientific experts, 
nurses, patient representatives, and a methodologist developed clinical 
recommendations. A statement of good practice was made when there was a high 
level of certainty that the recommendation would do more good than harm, but 
there was little direct evidence.
FINDINGS: From 11 295 literature citations associated with 10 PICO questions, 20 
relevant studies were identified. An updated search identified 2 additional 
studies, for a total of 22 included studies (3 systematic reviews, 19 primary 
studies), which were reviewed and synthesized. Based on this analysis, 14 
recommendations and 4 statements of good practice were developed. Overall, the 
evidence base was limited. Only 1 strong recommendation was formulated: 
screening for Alzheimer-type dementia starting at age 40 years. Four 
recommendations (managing risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke 
prevention, screening for obesity, and evaluation for secondary causes of 
osteoporosis) agreed with existing guidance for individuals without Down 
syndrome. Two recommendations for diabetes screening recommend earlier 
initiation of screening and at shorter intervals given the high prevalence and 
earlier onset in adults with Down syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These evidence-based clinical guidelines provide 
recommendations to support primary care of adults with Down syndrome. The lack 
of high-quality evidence limits the strength of the recommendations and 
highlights the need for additional research.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Childhood obesity is increasing substantially in many Pacific 
island countries and poses an urgent and serious challenge. The Sustainable 
Development Goals set by the United Nations and the NCD Roadmap created at the 
request of the Pacific Finance and Economic Ministers identify prevention and 
control of noncommunicable diseases as core priorities. Among the various risk 
factors responsible for the development of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), 
overweight and obesity are particularly of concern with the potential to negate 
many of the health benefits that have contributed to increased life expectancy. 
With the increase in childhood obesity across the region, it has become apparent 
that surveillance data remains a challenge; however, it is essential to inform 
the development of effective policies and strategies to tackle the challenge of 
childhood obesity in the Pacific region.
RECENT FINDINGS: The paper highlights the paucity of childhood obesity 
surveillance data available in the Pacific region and how the absence of a 
standardised tool to collect this data makes it difficult to do comparative 
analysis between countries. Drawing on a global protocol and identifying the 
gaps that currently exist in the region, the paper aims to highlight 
opportunities via which childhood obesity surveillance data can be improved to 
monitor better childhood obesity across the Pacific region.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has high morbidity and 
mortality rates. COPD impairs body functioning, reduces quality of life, and 
creates a great economic burden for society. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has 
become an important nonpharmacological treatment for COPD. This paper 
systematically reviews economic evaluations of PR in COPD patients in different 
settings.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to understand the cost-effectiveness of PR in different 
settings for COPD to provide economic evidence for decision-makers.
METHODS: We searched eight databases from their inception to 23 November 2019. 
The results were presented in terms of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER), and the decision uncertainty was expressed by cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curves (CEACs). We used the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria 
to assess study quality.
RESULTS: This review included ten studies that matched the selection criteria. 
Five studies compared PR with usual care in primary healthcare or outpatient 
departments. Two studies compared community-based PR with hospital PR or usual 
care. In the other studies, PR was mainly carried out at home. Compared with 
usual care, PR was cost-effective in primary healthcare institutions or 
outpatient departments. According to CEACs, community-based PR had a 50% 
probability of cost-effectiveness at £30,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
compared with hospital PR in the UK. Based on the ICER, community-based PR was 
"moderately" cost-effective, with a ratio of €32,425/QALY compared with usual 
care in the Netherlands. Home-based PR was dominant compared with usual care, 
and tele-rehabilitation was dominant compared with traditional home PR.
CONCLUSIONS: PR conducted in different settings can potentially be 
cost-effective, as measured using QALY or the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire 
(CRQ).

AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of fingolimod versus interferon 
(IFN)-β1a at a dose of 30 μg per week for the treatment of relapsing 
pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) in Canada.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A discrete-time Markov model was developed to compare 
fingolimod with IFN β-1a over a time horizon of two years representing patients 
followed up to mean age of 18 years from a Canadian health care system 
perspective. Twenty-one health states based on the Expanded Disability Status 
Scale (EDSS) were considered: EDSS 0‒9 for relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS), 
EDSS 0‒9 for secondary progressive MS, and "Death." Relative treatment efficacy 
for fingolimod versus IFN-β1a was estimated from the PARADIGMS study. Costs and 
resource use were obtained from published literature and Canadian sources. 
Utilities were estimated by mapping the Pediatric Quality of Life inventory data 
onto the Child Health Utility Index-9 Dimension using a published mapping 
algorithm. Future costs and benefits were discounted at 1.5% per annum.
RESULTS: Compared with IFN β-1a, fingolimod led to an increase in 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (0.125) with incremental costs (Canadian 
dollars [CAD] 2,977) and to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
CAD 23,886/QALY over a time horizon of two years representing patients followed 
up to mean age of 18 years. The monetary benefits of fingolimod treatment versus 
IFN β-1a at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of CAD 50,000 per QALY gained 
were higher than the costs. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic 
sensitivity analysis (PSA) both confirmed the robustness of the results.
LIMITATIONS: The main limitations of this analysis primarily stem from the 
limited data availability in POMS.
CONCLUSIONS: Fingolimod is cost effective compared with IFN β-1a for the 
treatment of POMS over a time horizon of two years representing patients 
followed up to a mean age of 18 years in Canada.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of pazopanib versus sunitinib as a 
first-line treatment for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) 
from an Italian National Health Service perspective, considering the evolving 
Italian landscape in terms of new reimbursement agreements trend.
METHODS: This analysis is an update of the previously published 
cost-effectiveness analysis to incorporate recent 2019 costs and additional 
changes regarding drug discounting. A partitioned-survival analysis model with 
three different health states (progression-free survival, post-progression 
survival, and dead) was utilized. Outcomes included progression-free life years, 
post-progression life years, overall life years, quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), and costs calculated for both treatments. Cost-effectiveness was 
assessed in terms of incremental costs per QALY gained and the net monetary 
benefit (NMB) of pazopanib versus sunitinib. In the base case analysis, a time 
horizon of 5 years was used and future costs and QALYs were discounted at a 3% 
annual discount rate. An impact of methodological and parameter uncertainly on 
base case results was evaluated using probabilistic and deterministic 
sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: In the base case, pazopanib had higher QALYs (+0.060) at lower costs 
(-€5,857) versus sunitinib, hence it dominated sunitinib. At willingness-to-pay 
thresholds of €30,000 and €50,000 per QALY, the NMB with pazopanib were €7,647 
and €8,841 per patient, respectively, versus sunitinib. The probability that 
pazopanib is cost-effective versus sunitinib was estimated to be 97.5% at a 
cost-effectiveness threshold of €20,000, 95.4% at a threshold of €30,000, and 
90.2% at a threshold of €50,000 per QALY. Cost-effectiveness results were robust 
to changes in key parameter values and assumptions as demonstrated by 
deterministic sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Pazopanib is likely to represent a cost-effective treatment option 
compared with sunitinib as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic 
RCC in Italy.

OBJECTIVE: Liver transplant (LT) is a definitive therapeutic option for patients 
with chronic liver disease. However, acute kidney injury after LT (post-LT AKI) 
is a frequent complication that may lead to graft dysfunction and decrease life 
expectancy. Delay in AKI detection by traditional biomarkers boosted research 
with new biomarkers for post-LT AKI as neutrophil gelatinase-associated 
lipocalin (NGAL) and syndecan-1. We aim to evaluate associations of 
intraoperative systemic NGAL and syndecan-1 levels with post-LT AKI.
METHODS: This is a prospective study conducted in 46 patients selected for LT. 
Patients were evaluated preoperatively and blood samples were collected 
intraoperatively: T1 (after induction of anesthesia), T2 (anhepatic phase) and 
T3 (2 h after reperfusion of the graft).
RESULTS: The mean age was 54 ± 12 years and 60% were male. Post-LT AKI was 
observed in 24 (52%) patients of which 12% needed dialysis. Serum NGAL and 
syndecan-1 increased along surgical phases. Mostly, increment values of serum 
NGAL of T2 to T3 and syndecan-1 at T3 were importantly associated with post-LT 
AKI. Into a multivariate model with model for end-stage liver disease score, 
age, gender, warm ischemia, cold ischemia and surgery time, syndecan-1 levels at 
T3 remains capable to predict post-LT AKI. Serum NGAL had significance only with 
increment values calculated by the ratio of 'T3/T2'. Finally, serum syndecan-1 
at T3 had a better diagnostic performance in receiver operating characteristic 
curve analysis.
CONCLUSION: Serum syndecan-1 levels in 2 h after reperfusion were most useful in 
early post-LT AKI diagnosis and may be used to construct new risk groups in this 
context.

OBJECTIVES: To prolong tooth life expectancy, tooth wear resulting in dentin 
exposure should be detected early. However, the most objective methods are 
clinically limited. We validated fluorescence parameters for distinguishing 
enamel from dentin-exposed wear in clinical images.
METHODS: Quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) images of 73 adults (age 
range: 22-48 years, mean: 33.81 ± 7.71 years), including 1949 teeth with varying 
tooth wear degrees, without restorations, caries, or cusp area fractures, were 
used to calculate the ΔFwear values. Areas-of-interest (AOIs) were selected from 
QLF images; the ΔFwear values and the tooth wear index (TWI) were calculated for 
each tooth. The ΔFwear values were compared according to the TWI scores. The 
optimum ΔFwear values for distinguishing enamel and dentin-exposed wear were 
determined using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 1949 AOIs were evaluated. The median ΔFwear values for teeth 
with TWI scores 0, 1, and 2 (5.7 %, 10.3 %, and 17.0 %) differed significantly 
(P < 0.001). The optimum cutoff ΔFwear values were 12.1 and 14.7 in the anterior 
and posterior teeth, respectively; the corresponding areas under the ROC values 
(AUROCs) were 0.86 and 0.93 (sensitivity: 0.79 and 0.85; specificity: 0.79 and 
0.85, respectively). The ΔFwear cutoff values for different age groups were 
within a range (12.7-13.7) and showed high validity (sensitivity, specificity, 
and AUROC: 0.78, 0.77-0.78, and 0.87-0.88, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: At the optimum threshold, the ΔFwear values showed high validity 
for distinguishing dentin exposure in worn teeth (AUROC: 0.87‒0.93) and could 
determine pathological tooth wear, particularly in posterior teeth.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrated the feasibility of using QLF to detect 
dentin-exposed tooth wear and present optimal thresholds according to age. In 
addition, we confirmed the possibility using such image data for objective and 
cost-effective epidemiological investigation and application in tele-dentistry.

Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is frequently complicated by 
bone metastasis, which deteriorates the life expectancy of this patient cohort. 
In order to develop a novel type of therapy for bone metastasis, we established 
4T1.3 clone with a high capacity to metastasize to bone after orthotopic 
injection, from a murine TNBC cell line, 4T1.0. To elucidate the molecular 
mechanism underlying a high growth ability of 4T1.3 in a bone cavity, we 
searched for a novel candidate molecule with a focus on a transcription factor 
whose expression was selectively enhanced in a bone cavity. Comprehensive gene 
expression analysis detected enhanced Nfe2 mRNA expression in 4T1.3 grown in a 
bone cavity, compared with in vitro culture conditions. Moreover, Nfe2 gene 
transduction into 4T1.0 cells enhanced their capability to form intraosseous 
tumors. Moreover, Nfe2 shRNA treatment reduced tumor formation arising from 
intraosseous injection of 4T1.3 clone as well as another mouse TNBC-derived 
TS/A.3 clone with an augmented intraosseous tumor formation ability. 
Furthermore, NFE2 expression was associated with in vitro growth advantages of 
these TNBC cell lines under hypoxic condition, which mimics the bone 
microenvironment, as well as Wnt pathway activation. These observations suggest 
that NFE2 can potentially contribute to breast cancer cell survival in the bone 
microenvironment.

Epidemiological data report that male hypogonadism may play a role in cognitive 
impairment in elderly. However, the effect of testosterone replacement therapy 
(TRT) on cognitive abilities in this cluster of patients has not been well 
established. Methods. PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and Web 
of Science were searched by using free text words and medical subject headings 
terms related with "male hypogonadism", "late-onset hypogonadism", elderly, 
cognition, "mild cognitive impairment", memory, "testosterone replacement 
therapy" used in various combinations according to the specific clinical 
questions. Original articles, reviews, and randomized controlled trials written 
in English were selected. Results. A long-term TRT could improve specific 
cognitive functions, such as verbal and spatial memory, cognitive flexibility, 
and physical vitality. However, randomized controlled trials do not provide 
positive results, and in most of the cases TRT might not induce beneficial 
effects on cognitive function in elderly men. Discussion and conclusions. Since 
the lengthening of life expectancy, the prevalence rate of cognitive decline in 
elderly men is expected to increase remarkably over the next decade with 
considerable healthcare and economical concerns. Therefore, this remains a 
relevant clinical topic and further investigations are needed for clarifying the 
role of TRT especially in elderly men with hypogonadism.

Implementing Interventions with Varying Marginal Cost-Effectiveness: An 
Application in Precision Medicine.

Purpose. A range of barriers may constrain the effective implementation of 
strategies to deliver precision medicine. If the marginal costs and consequences 
of precision medicine vary at different levels of implementation, then such 
variation will have an impact on relative cost-effectiveness. This study aimed 
to illustrate the importance and quantify the impact of varying marginal costs 
and benefits on the value of implementation for a case study in precision 
medicine. Methods. An existing method to calculate the value of implementation 
was adapted to allow marginal costs and consequences of introducing precision 
medicine into practice to vary across differing levels of implementation. This 
illustrative analysis used a case study based on a published decision-analytic 
model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of a 70-gene recurrence score 
(MammaPrint) for breast cancer. The impact of allowing for varying costs and 
benefits for the value of the precision medicine and of implementation 
strategies was illustrated graphically and numerically in both static and 
dynamic forms. Results. The increasing returns to scale exhibited by introducing 
this specific example of precision medicine mean that a minimum level of 
implementation (51%) is required for using the 70-gene recurrence score to be 
cost-effective at a defined threshold of €20,000 per quality-adjusted life year. 
The observed variation in net monetary benefit implies that the value of 
implementation strategies was dependent on the initial and ending levels of 
implementation in addition to the magnitude of the increase in patients 
receiving the 70-gene recurrence score. In dynamic models, incremental losses 
caused by low implementation accrue over time unless implementation is improved. 
Conclusions. Poor implementation of approaches to deliver precision medicine, 
identified to be cost-effective using decision-analytic model-based 
cost-effectiveness analysis, can have a significant economic impact on health 
systems. Developing and evaluating the economic impact of strategies to improve 
the implementation of precision medicine will potentially realize the more 
cost-effective use of health care budgets.

BACKGROUND: Physical Activity Monitors (PAMs) have been shown to effectively 
enhance level of physical activity (PA) in older adults. Motivational 
interviewing is a person-centred model where participants are guided using 
self-reflection and counselling, and addresses the behavioural and psychological 
aspects of why people initiate health behaviour change by prompting increases in 
motivation and self-efficacy. The addition of motivational interviewing to PA 
interventions may increase the effectiveness of PAMs for older adults.
METHODS: This motivational interviewing and PA monitoring trial is designed as 
an investigator-blinded, two arm parallel group, randomized controlled 
superiority trial with primary endpoint after 12 weeks of intervention. The 
intervention group will receive a PAM-based intervention and motivational 
interviewing and the control group will only receive the PAM-based intervention. 
The primary outcome is PA, objectively measured as the average daily number of 
steps throughout the intervention period. Secondary outcome measures include 
self-reported PA health-related quality of life, loneliness, self-efficacy for 
exercise, outcome expectancy for exercise, and social relations. The outcomes 
will be analysed with a linear regression model investigating between-group 
differences, adjusted for baseline scores. Following the intention to treat 
principle, multiple imputation will be performed to handle missing values.
DISCUSSION: A moderate effect of daily PA measured using PAMs is expected in 
this superiority RCT investigating the effect of adding motivational 
interviewing to a PAM intervention. According to the World Health Organization, 
walking and cycling are key activities in regular PA and should be promoted. To 
increase the general public health and lower the burden of inactivity in older 
adults, cost-beneficial solutions should be investigated further. If this RCT 
shows that motivational interviewing can enhance the effect of PAM-based 
interventions, it might be included as an add-on intervention when appropriate. 
No matter what the results of this study will be, the conclusions will be 
relevant for clinicians as the dependence on technology is increasing, 
especially in relation to public health promotion.

BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) improvements have stalled, and UK tax and 
welfare 'reforms' have been proposed as a cause. We estimated the effects of tax 
and welfare reforms from 2010/2011 to 2021/2022 on LE and inequalities in LE in
