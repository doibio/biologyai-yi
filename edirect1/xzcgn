INTRODUCTION: Adverse pregnancy outcomes are more common among Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander populations than non-Indigenous populations in Australia. 
Later in life, most of the difference in life expectancy between Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander women and non-Indigenous women is due to non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs). Most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women attend health 
services regularly during pregnancy. Providing high-quality care within these 
appointments has an important role to play in improving the current and future 
health of women and babies.
AIM: This study engaged stakeholders in a theory-informed process to use 
aggregated continuous quality improvement (CQI) data to identify 1) priority 
evidence-practice gaps in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander maternal health 
care, 2) barriers and enablers to high-quality care, and 3) strategies to 
address identified priorities.
METHODS: Three phases of reporting and feedback were implemented using 
de-identified CQI data from 91 health services between 2007 and 2014 (4,402 
client records). Stakeholders (n = 172) from a range of professions and 
organisations participated.
RESULTS: Stakeholders identified four priority areas relating to NCDs: smoking, 
alcohol, psychosocial wellbeing and nutrition. Barriers or enablers to 
high-quality care included workforce support, professional development, 
teamwork, woman-centred care, decision support, equipment and community 
engagement. Strategies to address the priorities included upskilling staff to 
provide best practice care in priority areas, advocating for availability of 
healthy food, housing and local referral options, partnering with communities on 
health promotion projects, systems to facilitate continuity of care and clear 
referral pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: This novel use of large-scale aggregate CQI data facilitated 
stakeholder input on priority evidence-practice gaps in maternal health care in 
Australia. Evidence-practice gaps relating to NCD risk factors and social 
determinants of health were prioritised, and stakeholders suggested both 
healthcare-focussed initiatives and approaches involving the community and the 
wider health sector. The findings can inform health service planning, advocacy, 
inter-agency strategies, and future research.

Cold storage can extend shelf life of parasitoids for use in biocontrol. 
However, cold storage may have negative impacts on life history traits of the 
parasitoids and, therefore, on their performance as biocontrol agents. Here, we 
examine the effect of cold storage on life history traits of Habrobracon hebetor 
(Say) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a parasitoid of several economic lepidopteran 
pests. Newly emerged wasps were stored at three constant temperatures (3°C, 5°C, 
7°C) for up to 4 wk. Both temperature and exposure time significantly affected 
longevity, parasitism, fecundity, and sex ratio. Significant reduction in 
longevity was observed at 3°C and 7°C, whereas longevity of wasps stored at 5°C 
remained stable up to the second week and then gradually decreased in Weeks 3 
and 4. Parasitism rate also significantly decreased after cold storage at 3°C, 
5°C, and 7°C (ranked from high to low). Fecundity decreased at T 3°C and T 5°C 
but this trait was not affected by storage at T 7°C. A significant shift in male 
production was observed at T 5°C in Week 3, but in Week 4, the only treatment 
with male biased reproduction was T 3°C. These results show that the effect of 
temperature and exposure time in cold storage is trait dependent. Overall, 
storage at 5°C for a period of 3 wk least impacted most life-history traits of 
H. hebetor wasps.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the associations of sleep 
duration and sleep disturbances with healthy and chronic disease-free life 
expectancy (LE) between ages 50 and 75.
METHODS: Data were drawn from repeated waves of three occupational cohort 
studies in England, Finland, and Sweden (n = 55,494) and the follow-up ranged 
from 6 to 18 years. Self-reported sleep duration was categorized into <7, 7-8.5, 
and ≥9 hours and sleep disturbances into no, moderate, and severe. Health 
expectancy was estimated with two health indicators: healthy LE based on years 
in good self-rated health and chronic disease-free LE based on years without 
chronic diseases. Multistate life table models were used to estimate healthy and 
chronic disease-free LE from age 50 to 75 years for each category of sleep 
measures in each cohort. Fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the 
cohort-specific results into summary estimates.
RESULTS: Persons who slept 7-8.5 hours could expect to live 19.1 (95% CI 
19.0-19.3) years in good health and 13.5 (95% CI 13.2-13.7) years without 
chronic diseases between ages 50 and 75. Healthy and disease-free years were 1-3 
years shorter for those who slept less than 7 hours or slept 9 hours or more. 
Persons who did not have sleep disturbances could expect to live 20.4 (95% CI 
20.3-20.6) years in good health and 14.3 (95% CI 14.1-14.5) years without 
chronic diseases between ages 50 and 75. Healthy and disease-free years were 6-3 
years shorter for those who reported severe sleep disturbances.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleeping 7-8.5 hours and having no sleep disturbances between ages 
50 to 75 are associated with longer healthy and chronic disease-free LE.

The distributions of income and health within and across countries are changing. 
This challenges the way donors allocate development assistance for health (DAH) 
and particularly the role of gross national income per capita (GNIpc) in 
classifying countries to determine whether countries are eligible to receive 
assistance and how much they receive. Informed by a literature review and 
stakeholder consultations and interviews, we developed a stepwise approach to 
the design and assessment of country classification frameworks for the 
allocation of DAH, with emphasis on critical value choices. We devised 25 
frameworks, all which combined GNIpc and at least one other indicator into an 
index. Indicators were selected and assessed based on relevance, salience, 
validity, consistency, and availability and timeliness, where relevance 
concerned the extent to which the indicator represented country's health needs, 
domestic capacity, the expected impact of DAH, or equity. We assessed how the 
use of the different frameworks changed the rankings of low- and middle-income 
countries relative to a country's ranking based on GNIpc alone. We found that 
stakeholders generally considered needs to be the most important concern to be 
captured by classification frameworks, followed by inequality, expected impact 
and domestic capacity. We further found that integrating a health-needs 
indicator with GNIpc makes a significant difference for many countries and 
country categories-and especially middle-income countries with high burden of 
unmet health needs-while the choice of specific indicator makes less difference. 
This together with assessments of relevance, salience, validity, consistency, 
and availability and timeliness suggest that donors have reasons to include a 
health-needs indicator in the initial classification of countries. It 
specifically suggests that life expectancy and disability-adjusted life year 
rate are indicators worth considering. Indicators related to other concerns may 
be mainly relevant at different stages of the decision-making process, require 
better data, or both.

Dietary restriction (DR) is an important experimental paradigm for lifespan and 
healthspan extension, but its specific contribution regarding the type, onset, 
and duration are still debatable. This study was designed to examine the impact 
of different dietary protocols by assessing the behavioral changes during aging. 
We exposed male Wistar rats of various age to ad libitum (AL) or DR (60 per cent 
of AL daily intake) feeding regimens with different onsets. The impact of DR on 
locomotor activity, memory, and learning was examined in 12-, 18-, and 
24-month-old treated animals and controls using open field and Y-maze tests. We 
have also evaluated the effects of different DR's through the quantification of 
animal frailty, using behavioral data to create the frailty score. Our results 
indicated that DR improves general animal activity and spatial memory and 
decreases frailty with the effect being highly dependent on DR duration and 
onset. Notably, life-long restriction started at young age had the most profound 
effect. In contrast, shorter duration and later onset of restricted diet had 
significantly lower or no impact on animal's behavior and frailty. This study 
signifies the importance of DR starting point and duration as critical 
determinants of DR effects on healthspan.

BACKGROUND: The life expectancy of untreated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
is dismal, while treatment for NSCLC improves survival. The presence of 
comorbidities is thought to play a significant role in the decision to treat or 
not treat a given patient. We aim to evaluate the association of comorbidities 
with the survival of patients treated for NSCLC.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients aged ≥66 years with 
invasive NSCLC between the years 2007 and 2011 in the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results Kentucky Cancer Registry. Comorbidity was measured 
using the Klabunde Comorbidity Index (KCI), and univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression models were used to measure association between receiving 
treatment and comorbidity. Kaplan-Meier plots were constructed to estimate 
time-to-event outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 4014 patients were identified; of this, 94.9% were white and 
55.7% were male. The proportion of patients who did not receive any treatment 
was 8.7%, 3.9%, 19.1%, and 23.5% for stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively 
(p<0.0001). In multivariate analysis, older age, higher stage, and higher 
comorbidity (KCI ≥3) were associated with a lower likelihood of receiving any 
treatment. The median overall survival (OS) for untreated and KCI=0 was 17.7 
months for stages I and II, 2.3 months for stage III, and 1.3 months for stage 
IV. The median OS for treated and KCI=0 was 58.9 months for stages I and II, 
16.8 months for stage III, and 5.8 months for stage IV (p<0.01). Treatment was 
an independent predictor of OS in multivariate analysis that included KCI 
scores.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that lung cancer patients may derive a survival 
benefit from therapies, regardless of the presence of comorbidities, although 
the degree of benefit seems to decrease with higher KCI scores.

BACKGROUND: Depression, schizophrenia and panic disorder are common mental 
disorders in the community and hospitalized patients. These mental disorders 
negatively affect life quality and even expectancy of life. Haptoglobin (Hp) 
phenotype (Hp 1-1, 1-2, or 2-2) is associated with risk for cardiovascular 
diseases, but its association with psychiatric disorders, a growing concern in 
the modern society, has not been studied thoroughly. The aim of the study was to 
examine whether Hp phenotype is associated with common mental disorders such as 
depression, schizophrenia, and panic disorder.
METHODS: The study included 92 Arab patients with mental disorders, and among 
them 44 suffered from schizophrenia (mean age 39 ± 1.5 years), 17 from 
depression (mean age 44.5 ± 3.1 years), 31 from panic disorder (mean age of 44.9 
± 2.7 years), and 206 healthy Arab control subjects with a mean age of 42.6 ± 
0.9 years. Beck's depression inventory assessment and Hamilton depression scale 
were administered for depression and panic disorder diagnosis. Schizophrenia was 
evaluated with positive and negative affect schedule (Panas) test. All mental 
disorders were evaluated by clinical review. Blood analysis for Hp phenotype was 
performed. Diagnosis was made using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders axis to correlate depression with Hp phenotype.
RESULTS: In mentally healthy controls, 10.7% were Hp 1-1, 38.8% Hp 2-1, and 
50.5% Hp 2-2. In patients with the studied psychiatric disorders, Hp phenotype 
was comparable to healthy subjects; 8.7% were Hp 1-1, 50% Hp 2-1, and 41.3% Hp 
2-2. When Hp phenotyping was analyzed in the psychiatric subgroups, Hp 2-1 was 
more common among depressed and schizophrenic patients, as compared with healthy 
subjects (58.8% and 52.3% vs. 38.8%). In patients who suffer from panic 
disorder, Hp phenotype distribution was 6.5% Hp 1-1, 41.9% Hp 2-1, and 51.6% Hp 
2-2, suggesting a lower prevalence among Hp 1-1 phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Arab patients who carry Hp 2-1 phenotype may be at risk to develop 
depression or schizophrenia more than the general healthy population. In 
contrast, Hp 1-1 subjects have a lower prevalence of panic disorder.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers with a high 
mortality rate. Late diagnosis and poor prognosis are still a major drawback 
since curative therapies such as liver resection and liver transplantation are 
effective only for an early stage HCC. Development of novel molecular targeting 
therapies against HCC may provide new options that will improve the efficiency 
of the diagnosis and the success of the therapy, thus ameliorating the life 
expectancy of the patients. The aptamer is an oligonucleotide nanomedicine that 
has high binding affinity and specificity to small and large target molecules in 
the intracellular and extracellular environment with agonist or antagonist 
function. Currently, several aptamers for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes 
are under development to recognize different molecules of HCC. In in vitro 
models, the aptamer has been shown to be able to reduce the growth of HCC cells 
and increase the sensitivity to conventional chemotherapies. In in vivo mouse 
models, aptamer could induce cell apoptosis with antitumor activity. Overall 
data had shown that aptamer has limited toxicity and might be safe in clinical 
application. This review summarizes recent information of aptamer as a potential 
oligonucleotide nanomedicine tool, in diagnostics, targeted therapy, and as drug 
delivery nano-vehicles.

Muscular dystrophies are a clinically and heterogeneous group of disorders that 
all share clinical characteristics of progressive muscular weakness. Duchenne 
muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common X-linked disorder muscular dystrophy 
in children, presenting in early childhood and characterized by proximal muscle 
weakness and calf hypertrophy in affected boys. There is usually delay in motor 
development and eventually wheelchair confinement followed by premature death 
from cardiac or respiratory complications. Treatment modalities such as 
corticosteroid therapy and use of intermittent positive pressure ventilation 
have provided improvements in function, ambulation, quality of life, and life 
expectancy, although novel therapies still aim to provide a cure for this 
devastating disorder. Here, we present a case of DMD in a 12-year-old male with 
remarkable clinical and oral manifestations.

Owing to the worldwide increase in life expectancy, the high incidence of 
diabetes in older individuals and the improved survival of people with diabetes, 
about one-third of all individuals with diabetes are now older than 65 years. 
Evidence is accumulating that type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive 
impairment, dementia and frailty. Older people with diabetes have significantly 
more comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial 
disease and renal impairment, compared with those without diabetes. However, as 
a consequence of the increased use of multifactorial risk factor intervention, a 
considerable number of older individuals can now survive for many years without 
any vascular complications. Given the heterogeneity of older individuals with 
type 2 diabetes, an individualised approach is warranted, which must take into 
account the health status, presence or absence of complications, and life 
expectancy. In doing so, undertreatment of otherwise healthy older individuals 
and overtreatment of those who are frail may be avoided. Specifically, 
overtreatment of hyperglycaemia in older patients is potentially harmful; in 
particular, insulin and sulfonylureas should be avoided or, if necessary, used 
with caution. Instead, glucose-dependent drugs that do not induce hypoglycaemia 
are preferable since older patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function 
are especially vulnerable to this adverse event.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous clonal disorders ranging from 
indolent conditions with a near-normal life expectancy to forms approaching 
acute myeloid leukaemia. Comorbid conditions have rarely been systematically 
studied among patients with MDS. Older age per se has a negative impact on 
survival of MDS patients, in particular of those with lower risk. However, age 
indirectly affects also the survival of higher-risk patients by limiting their 
eligibility to intensive treatments. In addition, ageing is associated with an 
increasingly high risk of developing comorbidity, and a high prevalence of 
comorbid diseases has indeed been reported in MDS patients. The impact of 
multi-morbidities/comorbidities and polypharmacy in patients with low-risk MDS 
patients is a poorly explored topic. We focused on medications, 
multi-morbidities and comorbidities of 155 low-risk MDS patients followed in the 
haematological outpatients clinics or in medical/oncology wards of our 
University Hospital. One or more comorbidities were present at diagnosis in 24 
younger patients with MDS syndromes (31%), whereas 56 older patients with MDS 
(75%) presented 1 or more comorbidities (P < 0.001).The most frequent 
comorbidity was cardiac comorbidity 18% in younger patients and 25% in older 
patients. With no statistical significance between older and younger patients, 
congestive heart failure was the most frequent observed disease. Our study has 
shown a statistical correlation between transfusion dependency and polypathology 
(P = 0.0014). These data were also confirmed in a subanalysis of the younger 
group of patients. Our study has shown that comorbidity is very common among 
patients with MDS, potentially affecting the clinical course and outcome of MDS 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Some surgeons perform flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy (FFL) in all 
patients prior to thyroid cancer operations. Given the low likelihood of 
recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) or aerodigestive invasion in clinically low-risk 
thyroid cancers, the value of routine FFL in this group is controversial. We 
hypothesized that routine preoperative FFL would not be cost effective in 
low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).
METHODS: A decision model was constructed comparing preoperative FFL versus 
surgery without FFL in a clinical stage T2 N0 DTC patient without voice 
symptoms. Total thyroidectomy and definitive hemithyroidectomy were both modeled 
as possible initial surgical approaches. Outcome probabilities and their 
corresponding utilities were estimated via literature review, and costs were 
estimated using Medicare reimbursement data. Sensitivity analysis was conducted 
to examine the uncertainty of cost, probability, and utility estimates in the 
model.
RESULTS: When the initial surgical strategy was total thyroidectomy, routine 
preoperative FFL produced an incremental cost of $183 and an incremental 
effectiveness of 0.000126 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for routine FFL prior to total thyroidectomy was 
$1.45 million/QALY, exceeding the $100,000/QALY threshold for cost 
effectiveness. Routine FFL became cost effective if the preoperative probability 
of asymptomatic vocal cord paralysis increased from 1.0% to 4.9%, or if the cost 
of preoperative FFL decreased from $128 to $27. Changing the extent of initial 
surgery to hemithyroidectomy produced a higher ICER for routine FFL of $1.7 
million/QALY.
CONCLUSION: Routine preoperative FFL is not cost effective in asymptomatic 
patients with sonographically low-risk DTC, regardless of the initial planned 
extent of surgery.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Daclatasvir plus asunaprevir has shown superior 
efficacy and safety for treating hepatitis C virus genotype 1b infection in 
comparison with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. The objective of this 
analysis is to investigate the cost effectiveness of daclatasvir plus 
asunaprevir compared with interferon-α-based therapies from the perspective of 
the Chinese healthcare system.
METHODS: A Markov model was established to measure economic and health outcomes 
of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir compared with general interferon-α plus 
ribavirin and pegylated interferon plus ribavirin for hepatitis C virus genotype 
1b infection. We also considered the two following scenarios: 24 weeks of 
daclatasvir plus asunaprevir used as a second-line treatment for 
ineligible/intolerant and non-responding patients with HCV during 48 weeks of 
first-line interferon-α plus ribavirin (interferon-α plus ribavirin and 
daclatasvir plus asunaprevir) or pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (pegylated 
interferon plus ribavirin and daclatasvir plus asunaprevir) treatment. Clinical 
costs and utility inputs were derived from the published literature. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was shown as costs in US dollars per 
quality-adjusted life-years gained. Uncertainty was examined by one-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Compared with interferon-α plus ribavirin, pegylated interferon and 
ribavirin, interferon-α plus ribavirin plus daclatasvir plus asunaprevir, and 
pegylated interferon plus ribavirin plus daclatasvir plus asunaprevir 
strategies, daclatasvir plus asunaprevir gained an additional 0.62, 0.32, 0.20, 
and 0.15 quality-adjusted life-year with increasing costs of US$11,950, US$671, 
US$8366, and -$3783, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 
pegylated interferon and ribavirin, daclatasvir plus asunaprevir, interferon-α 
plus ribavirin and daclatasvir plus asunaprevir, and pegylated interferon plus 
ribavirin and daclatasvir plus asunaprevir against the baseline interferon-α 
plus ribavirin strategy were US$37,930, US$19,233, US$8495, and US$33,031 per 
quality-adjusted life-year gained. Daclatasvir plus asunaprevir and interferon-α 
plus ribavirin plus daclatasvir plus asunaprevir were presented as the 
cost-effective alternatives, and pegylated interferon plus ribavirin and 
pegylated interferon plus ribavirin and daclatasvir plus asunaprevir strategies 
dominated. The model outputs were sensitive to a patient's age, discount rate, 
and the risk ratio between pegylated interferon plus ribavirin and interferon-α 
plus ribavirin.
CONCLUSIONS: Daclatasvir plus asunaprevir in the Chinese setting is likely to be 
cost effective for treating hepatitis C virus genotype 1b infection.

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of 7 treatment 
strategies for treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in 
adults.
METHODS: A model was developed to evaluate treatment alternatives for adults 
(18-64 years old) that consisted of 2 parts: a decision analytic model and a 
Markov model. The decision analytic model stratified 7 outpatient treatment 
strategies, and the Markov model accumulated benefits and costs across the life 
expectancy of a simulated cohort of individuals. The model was parameterized 
with probabilistic and deterministic parameters from the literature and an 
outcomes database to perform a Monte Carlo simulation of a hypothetical cohort 
of 100,000 adults with OCD to estimate net health benefits (NHBs), costs, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for each treatment strategy. OCD was 
considered treatment refractory in adults with an OCD diagnosis who failed 
first-line therapies. Encounters took place from 2012 to 2015, and the analyses 
were performed from November 2016 to February 2017.
RESULTS: Partial hospitalization with step-down to intensive outpatient 
treatment was the most cost-effective of the 7 strategies, with an estimated 
ICER of $7,983 and mean (SD) NHB of 10.96 (0.53) quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) remaining. This result was 2.2 QALYs greater than that of the 
trial-based antidepressant and cognitive-behavioral therapy (ADM + CBT) 
strategy. Three additional ADM + CBT strategies were estimated not to be 
statistically significantly different from each other. These 4 ADM + CBT 
strategies outperformed both pharmacotherapy-only strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment strategies that include higher-intensity CBT, with 
effectiveness outcomes that approached efficacy estimates, were superior to 
real-world CBT strategies. However, given the limited availability of 
high-quality CBT, especially through use of commercial insurance networks, 
specialized treatment programs offer greater effectiveness than real-world 
therapies in achieving wellness for this severe patient population.

Streptococcus pneumoniae causes a high disease burden including pneumonia, 
meningitis and septicemia. Both a polysaccharide vaccine targeting 23 serotypes 
(PPV23) and a 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) are indicated for persons aged 
over 50 years. We developed and parameterized a static multi-cohort model to 
estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness and budget-impact of these vaccines 
at different uptake levels. Using three different vaccine efficacy scenarios 
regarding non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia and extensive uni- and 
multivariate sensitivity analyses, we found a strong preference for PPV23 over 
PCV13 in all age groups at willingness to pay levels below €300 000 per quality 
adjusted life year (QALY). PPV23 vaccination would cost on average about 
€83 000, €60 000 and €52 000 per QALY gained in 50-64, 65-74 and 75-84 year 
olds, whereas for PCV13 this is about €171 000, €201 000 and €338 000, 
respectively. Strategies combining PPV23 and PCV13 vaccines were most effective 
but generally less cost-effective. When assuming a combination of increased 
duration of PCV13 protection, increased disease burden preventable by PCV13 and 
a 75% reduction of the PCV13 price, PCV13 could become more attractive in <75 
year olds, but would remain less attractive than PPV23 from age 75 years 
onwards. These observations are independent of the assumption that PPV23 has 0% 
efficacy against non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia. Pneumococcal vaccination 
would be most cost-effective in Belgium, when achieving high uptake with PPV23 
in 75-84 year olds, as well as by negotiating a lower market-conform PPV23 price 
to improve uptake and cost-effectiveness.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of 20-week abortion bans on maternal and 
consequent neonatal health outcomes and costs in the setting of fetal congenital 
diaphragmatic hernia.
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was built using TreeAge software to evaluate 
the effect of a 20-week ban on abortion in a theoretical cohort of 921 women 
diagnosed with fetal congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Probabilities, utilities, 
and costs were derived from the literature. The cohort size was based on the 
annual rate of prenatal diagnoses of congenital diaphragmatic hernia and live 
births among the 20 states with bans. The threshold for cost-effectiveness was 
set at $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Analysis was completed from the 
maternal perspective. Clinical outcomes included mode of delivery, maternal 
death, intrauterine fetal death, neonatal death, neurodevelopmental disability, 
and use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. One-way sensitivity analysis was 
used on all variables and Monte Carlo simulation was performed.
RESULTS: A policy restricting termination was associated with higher costs, at 
an additional $158,419,623, with decreased quality of life and 674 fewer 
quality-adjusted life-years. With 20-week bans in place, 60 women would travel 
out of state to obtain abortions. There would be 158 more live births affected 
by congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Of these births, 45 neonates would die 
before 28 days after birth and an additional 37 would have long-term 
neurodevelopmental disability.
CONCLUSION: In this model, bans that limit abortions beyond 20 weeks of 
gestation were associated with worse health outcomes and increased costs for 
women with pregnancies complicated by congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The 
restriction of health care access should be considered in terms of the long-term 
outcomes and economic effect on individuals and society.

BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common reportable infection in the 
United States and can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and tubal factor 
infertility (TFI).
METHODS: We created life tables to estimate the "lifetime" risk of chlamydia 
diagnosis among women aged 15-34 years in King County, Washington, between 1992 
and 2014. We estimated the lifetime risk of chlamydia-associated PID and TFI 
incorporating published estimates of the risk of sequelae.
RESULTS: There were 51464 first chlamydia diagnoses in 1992-2014. For women born 
between 1980 and 1984, the lifetime risk of chlamydia diagnosis was 19.8% 
overall and 14.0% for non-Hispanic white, 64.9% for non-Hispanic black, and 
32.6% for Hispanic women. The cumulative risk of chlamydia by age 24 increased 
overall from 13.9% to 17.3% among women born between 1975 and 1994 but declined 
among non-Hispanic black women, among whom risk by age 24 declined from 57.3% 
among women born between 1980 and 1984 to 38.6% among women born between 1990 
and 1994. The lifetime risk of chlamydia-associated PID among women born between 
1980 and 1984 ranged from 0.33% to 1.14%. Among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic 
black, and Hispanic women, the lifetime risk of chlamydia-associated TFI was 
0.04%, 0.20%, and 0.10%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Over 60% of non-Hispanic black women had at least 1 chlamydia 
diagnosis by age 34 in the birth cohorts most affected, a risk almost 5 times 
that in non-Hispanic whites. An estimated 1 in 500 non-Hispanic black women 
develops chlamydia-associated TFI. More effective control measures are needed.

BACKGROUND: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. 
Preventive Services Task Force recommend one-time hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
testing for persons born 1945-1965 and targeted testing for high-risk persons. 
This strategy targets HCV testing to a prevalent population at high risk for HCV 
morbidity and mortality, but does not include younger populations with high 
incidence. To address this gap and improve access to HCV testing, age-based 
strategies should be considered.
METHODS: We used a simulation of HCV to estimate the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of HCV testing strategies: 1) standard of care (SOC) - 
recommendation for one-time testing for all persons born 1945-1965, 2) 
recommendation for one-time testing for adults ≥40 years (≥40 strategy), 3) ≥30 
years (≥30 strategy), and 4) ≥18 years (≥18 strategy). All strategies assumed 
targeted testing of high-risk persons. Inputs were derived from national 
databases, observational cohorts and clinical trials. Outcomes included 
quality-adjusted life expectancy, costs, and cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Expanded age-based testing strategies increased US population lifetime 
case identification and cure rates. Greatest increases were observed in the ≥18 
strategy. Compared to the SOC, this strategy resulted in an estimated 256,000 
additional infected persons identified and 280,000 additional cures at the 
lowest cost per QALY gained (ICER = $28,000/QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to risk-based testing, one-time HCV testing of persons 
18 and older appears to be cost-effective, leads to improved clinical outcomes 
and identifies more persons with HCV than the current birth cohort 
recommendations. These findings could be considered for future recommendation 
revisions.

CONTEXT: Studies examining the attitudes of clinicians toward prognostication 
for older adults have focused on life expectancy prediction. Little is known 
about whether clinicians approach prognostication in other ways.
OBJECTIVES: To describe how clinicians approach prognostication for older 
adults, defined broadly as making projections about patients' future health.
METHODS: In five focus groups, 30 primary care clinicians from community-based, 
academic-affiliated, and Veterans Affairs primary care practices were given 
open-ended questions about how they make projections about their patients' 
future health and how this informs the approach to care. Content analysis was 
used to organize responses into themes.
RESULTS: Clinicians spoke about future health in terms of a variety of health 
outcomes in addition to life expectancy, including independence in activities 
and decision making, quality of life, avoiding hospitalization, and symptom 
burden. They described approaches in predicting these health outcomes, including 
making observations about the overall trajectory of patients to predict health 
outcomes and recognizing increased risk for adverse health outcomes. Clinicians 
expressed reservations about using estimates of mortality risk and life 
expectancy to think about and communicate patients' future health. They 
discussed ways in which future research might help them in thinking about and 
discussing patients' future health to guide care decisions, including 
identifying when and whether interventions might impact future health.
CONCLUSION: The perspectives of primary care clinicians in this study confirm 
that prognostic considerations can go beyond precise estimates of mortality risk 
and life expectancy to include a number of outcomes and approaches to predicting 
those outcomes.

Therapeutic strategies using endogenous stem cell mobilizer can provide 
effective cell-free therapy for addressing various ischemic diseases. In 
particular, substance P (SP) exhibited therapeutic regeneration by facilitating 
mobilization of endogenous stem cells from bone marrow to the injured sites. 
However, its therapeutic effect has been limited due to short half-life and 
rapid degradation of administered SP peptides in vivo. Here we sought to develop 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-mimicking nanodiscs conjugated with SP (HDL-SP) 
in order to increase the in vivo half-life, bone marrow targeting, and 
therapeutic efficacy of SP for the treatment of diabetic peripheral ischemia. 
Conjugation of SP onto HDL nanodisc led to remarkable ∼3215- and ∼1060-fold 
increase in the ex vivo and in vivo half-lives of SP, respectively. Accordingly, 
HDL-SP nanodiscs improved retention of SP in bone marrow after systemic
