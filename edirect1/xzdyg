Real-world data/evidence (RWD/RWE) may provide insightful information on 
medicines' clinical effects to guide regulatory decisions. While its 
contribution has been recognized for safety monitoring and disease epidemiology 
across medicines' life cycles, using RWD/RWE to demonstrate efficacy requires 
further evaluation. This study aimed to (i) characterize RWD/RWE presented by 
applicants to support claims on medicines' efficacy within initial marketing 
authorization applications (MAAs) and extension of indication applications 
(EoIs), and (ii) analyze the contribution of RWD/RWE to regulatory decisions on 
medicines' benefit-risk profile. RWD/RWE was included to support efficacy in 32 
MAAs and 14 EoIs submitted 2018-2019. Of these, RWD/RWE was part of the 
preauthorization package of 16 MAAs and 10 EoIs, and was (i) considered 
supporting the regulatory decision in 10 applications (five MAAs, five EoIs), 
(ii) considered not supporting the regulatory decision in 11 (seven MAAs, four 
EoIs), and (iii) not addressed at all in the evaluation of 5 applications (four 
MAAs, one EoI). Common limitations of submitted RWD/RWE included missing data, 
lack of representativeness of populations, small sample size, absence of an 
adequate or prespecified analysis plan, and risk of several types of bias. The 
suitability of RWD/RWE in a given application still requires a case-by-case 
analysis considering its purpose of use, implying reflection on the data source, 
together with its assets and limitations, study objectives and designs, and the 
overall data package issued. Early interactions and continuous dialogues with 
regulators and relevant stakeholders is key to optimize fit-for-purpose RWE 
generation, enabling its broader use in medicines development.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article is to review and synthesize the evidence on 
end-of-life in burn intensive care units.
METHODS: Systematic scoping review: Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic 
Reviews extension for Scoping Reviews was used as a reporting guideline. 
Searches were performed in 3 databases, with no time restriction and up to 
September 2021.
RESULTS: A total of 16,287 documents were identified; 18 were selected for 
analysis and synthesis. Three key themes emerged: (i) characteristics of the 
end-of-life in burn intensive care units, including end-of-life decisions, 
decision-making processes, causes, and trajectories of death; (ii) symptom 
control at the end-of-life in burn intensive care units focusing on patients' 
comfort; and (iii) concepts, models, and designs of the care provided to burned 
patients at the end-of-life, mainly care approaches, provision of care, and 
palliative care.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: End-of-life care is a major step in the care provided 
to critically ill burned patients. Dying and death in burn intensive care units 
are often preceded by end-of-life decisions, namely forgoing treatment and 
do-not-attempt to resuscitate. Different dying trajectories were described, 
suggesting the possibility to develop further studies to identify triggers for 
palliative care referral. Symptom control was not described in detail. 
Palliative care was rarely involved in end-of-life care for these patients. This 
review highlights the need for early and high-quality palliative and end-of-life 
care in the trajectories of critically ill burned patients, leading to an 
improved perception of end-of-life in burn intensive care units. Further 
research is needed to study the best way to provide optimal end-of-life care and 
foster integrated palliative care in burn intensive care units.

Blueprint for Future Research Advancing the Study of Sexuality, Gender, and 
Equity in Later Life: Lessons Learned From Aging With Pride, The National 
Health, Aging, and Sexuality/Gender Study (NHAS).

While interest in sexuality\research is growing, in the past, it has been 
largely invisible in gerontology. By exploring the full range and dimensions of 
sexuality and their interrelationships with multiple factors, this article 
presents conceptual, substantive, and methodological advances for the field of 
sexuality in later life. Based on the Sexual Equity Framework, an extension of 
the Health Equity Promotion Model, this article highlights the heterogeneity and 
intersectionality of sexuality across the life course, examining how historical 
and contemporary contexts frame key dimensions of sexuality at multiple levels 
(intrapersonal, interpersonal, sociocultural, and structural) and their 
relationship with sexual quality of life. Utilizing findings from Aging with 
Pride: National Health, Aging and Sexuality/Gender Study, the heterogeneity and 
intersectionality of age, gender, race, and ethnicity are critical to 
understanding sexuality and its dimensions in later life. Many adults experience 
changes in sexual and gender identities over time. Affirming sexual and gender 
identities, social connections, and health-promoting behaviors are positively 
associated with sexual quality of life, while sexual stigma and marginalization 
have adverse consequences. The study of sexuality needs to be fully integrated 
into gerontology. The Sexual Equity Framework explicates the potential 
deleterious effect of historical and contemporary structures on sexuality as 
well the important roles of affirmation, agency, and resilience among older 
adults, and recognizes the important role of human rights to advance sexual 
quality of life. Important directions for future research, practices, and 
policies are outlined.

INTRODUCTION: Experiencing or being exposed to violence is called victimization; 
living it can generate repercussions on health, quality of life and life 
expectancy.
OBJECTIVES: To describe victimization and identify factors related to 
polyvictimization (≥ 4 victimization incidents) in adolescents.
METHODS: After informed consent and assent were obtained, the ICAST-C and Youth 
Self-Report validated self-report questionnaires were applied in nine public 
secondary schools, by means of which demographic data, six forms of 
victimization and symptoms related to eight mental health problems were 
investigated. Frequencies of the forms of victimization and polyvictimization 
were obtained and an ordinal regression was carried out to identify variables 
related to polyvictimization.
RESULTS: The answers of 638 participants were included; 49.37% reported 
victimization throughout life, 53.37% before previous year and 68.86% during 
previous year; 47.65% reported polyvictimization, 21.75% before previous year 
and 17.53% during previous year. The factors related to polyvictimization were 
depression-introversion, attention deficit, rule-breaking behaviors, bullying 
and parental separation/divorce.
CONCLUSIONS: Victimization and polyvictimization were frequent in this sample of 
adolescents; the factors that were related to polyvictimization included 
symptoms of mental health problems, bullying and parental divorce/separation.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined as a resting mean pulmonary arterial 
pressure (mPAP) of more than 20 mmHg. Pulmonary hypertension is a complex, 
heterogeneous disease with multiple etiologies, subtypes, and various methods 
were used to classify the disease. WHO has categorized pulmonary hypertension 
into five broad clinical groups based on the underlying etiologies, similarities 
in pathophysiology, and treatment approach.  WHO group 1 is generally referred 
to as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). WHO group 2 PH is caused by left 
heart disease. WHO group 3 is PH related to lung disease and/or hypoxia. WHO 
group 4 is PH due to pulmonary artery obstructions such as chronic 
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). WHO group 5 PH has unclear and/or 
multifactorial mechanisms. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare 
subtype of PAH characterized by progressive obstruction of small pulmonary veins 
leading to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and right-sided heart 
failure. Although PVOD was first described in 1934, the understanding of the 
disease remains poor.  The clinical features are very non-specific and can 
resemble congestive heart failure, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(IPAH), and restrictive lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis. The gold 
standard for diagnosis is a biopsy, which is risky and not advisable in 
pulmonary hypertension due to a high risk of procedure-related complications 
such as life-threatening bleeding.  No medical therapy is supported by evidence, 
and the only curative option is lung transplantation. The prognosis is poor, and 
life expectancy is two years after symptom onset. This review aims to educate 
clinicians on this rare, less emphasized, and poorly understood disease.

416. Death or dialysis: the value of burdensome life-extending treatments for the
 cognitively impaired.

Parsons JA.

In: Kohlhammer VW, author. Schildmann J, Buch C, Zerth J, editors. Defining the 
Value of Medical Interventions: Normative and Empirical Challenges [Internet]. 
Stuttgart (DE): W. Kohlhammer GmbH; 2021.
Wellcome Trust–Funded Monographs and Book Chapters.

All medical treatments carry with them some level of burden for the patient, 
though this is usually outweighed by the benefits. Some long-term, 
life-extending treatments, however, are highly burdensome and the benefits are 
not always clearly greater. When a patient lacks decision-making capacity, there 
is a risk of undue harm if the decision is made on their behalf to initiate that 
treatment. In this chapter, I question the prioritisation of life-extension over 
quality of life in such circumstances, arguing that the latter ought sometimes 
to be prioritised. I suggest that in appealing to the principle of equal 
treatment of the cognitively impaired (which is endorsed in the majority of 
countries and is often the very purpose of legislation which governs treatment 
decisions for this population) we ought to accept that the very fact some 
patients with decision-making capacity choose to forego a medical intervention 
entails that sometimes cognitively impaired patients in similar situations ought 
also to forego that medical intervention. In doing so, maintenance dialysis is 
employed as a case study. Kidney failure is a reality for millions of 
individuals globally. Due to the shortage of organs for transplantation, 
patients with or approaching kidney failure are usually started on maintenance 
dialysis. This is often considered the default, with the alternative of 
conservative kidney management – which, incidentally, some studies have 
suggested may provide a similar survival benefit in some patients – thought of 
as giving up. Dialysis is a hugely burdensome treatment, often proving both 
physically and mentally exhausting and thereby negatively impacting on quality 
of life. Depending on treatment modality it may also require thrice weekly 
visits to an outpatient unit for the procedure to be performed. With the 
increasing age of the dialysis population, for patients to have several 
comorbidities is common and may compromise quality of life further. Given the 
significance of these burdens, it is not uncommon for patients – particularly 
those who are older and with several comorbidities – to forego dialysis in 
favour of conservative kidney management. Many of the burdens associated with 
dialysis may be exacerbated in cognitively impaired patients; they may not 
understand why they are being put through the treatment, and dialysis clinics 
may not be suitable environments depending on the nature of the patient's 
impairment. Not only are the burdens high for cognitively impaired patients, but 
these patients may be subjected to them for an extended period of time. The 
organ shortage, as well as many older cognitively impaired patients not being 
suitable candidates for transplantation, mean that dialysis is not always a 
bridge therapy. Rather, it is something that will be a part of the rest of these 
patients’ lives. This raises the question of dialysis withdrawal, which I frame 
in terms of the equivalence thesis and the possible omission bias of clinicians. 
I conclude that given some patients choose themselves to forego dialysis, 
patients who lack decision-making capacity ought sometimes also to forego 
dialysis in favour of conservative kidney management. This discussion is 
applicable to other highly burdensome treatments for cognitively impaired 
patients, and indeed is also useful in considering decisions concerning dialysis 
more broadly. Nonetheless, I also call for further research in this area to 
better explore the issues raised.

The target of EGR1 protein 1 (TOE1) is evolutionarily conserved from 
Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals, which plays a critical role in the maturation 
of a variety of small nuclear RNAs. Mutation in human TOE1 has been reported to 
cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 7, a severe neurodegenerative syndrome. 
However, the role of TOE1 in early embryonic development remains unclear. 
Herein, we found that Toe1 mRNA and protein were expressed in mouse 
preimplantation embryos. Silencing Toe1 by siRNA led to morula-to-blastocyst 
transition failure. This developmental arrest can be rescued by Toe1 mRNA 
microinjection. EdU incorporation assay showed a defect in blastomere 
proliferation within developmentally arrested embryos. Further studies revealed 
that Toe1 knockdown caused increased signals for γH2AX and micronuclei, 
indicative of sustained DNA damage. Moreover, mRNA levels of cell cycle 
inhibitor p21 were significantly upregulated in Toe1 knockdown embryos before 
developmental arrest. Together, these results suggest that TOE1 is indispensable 
for mouse early embryo development potentially through maintaining genomic 
integrity. Our findings provide further insight into the role of TOE1 in mouse 
preimplantation embryonic development.

Universal Screening for Malnutrition Prior to Total Knee Arthroplasty Is 
Cost-Effective: A Markov Analysis.

Pennsylvania.

BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) who have 
malnutrition possess an increased risk of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). 
Although malnutrition screening and intervention may decrease the risk of PJI, 
it utilizes healthcare resources. To date, no cost-effectiveness analyses have 
been performed on the screening and treatment of malnutrition prior to TKA.
METHODS: A Markov model projecting lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) was built to determine the cost-effectiveness of malnutrition 
screening and intervention for TKA patients from a societal perspective. Costs, 
health state utilities, and state transition probabilities were obtained from 
previously published literature, hospital costs at our institution, and expert 
opinions. Two important assumptions included that 30% of patients would be 
malnourished and that a malnutrition intervention would be 50% effective. The 
primary outcome of this study was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, with 
a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. One-way and two-way 
sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate model parameter assumptions.
RESULTS: When using the base case values, universal malnutrition screening and 
intervention was cost-effective compared to no malnutrition screening or 
intervention, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6,454 per QALY. 
Universal screening and intervention remained cost-effective, provided the cost 
of screening remained less than $3,373, the cost of nutritional intervention 
remained less than $12,042, the prevalence of malnutrition among surgical 
candidates was higher than 2%, and the risk of PJI among patients with 
malnutrition was greater than 1%.
CONCLUSION: Universal preoperative malnutrition screening and intervention among 
TKA candidates is cost-effective at parameters encountered in clinical practice. 
Nutritional optimization programs should be considered to facilitate 
malnutrition screening and intervention and future studies should evaluate their 
efficacy at lowering PJI risk.

INTRODUCTION: Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rt-CGM) involves the 
measurement and display of glucose concentrations, potentially improving glucose 
control among insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The present 
analysis aimed to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of rt-CGM versus 
self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) based on a USA retrospective cohort 
study in insulin-treated people with T2D adapted to the UK.
METHODS: Long-term costs and clinical outcomes were estimated using the CORE 
Diabetes Model, with clinical input data sourced from a retrospective cohort 
study. Patients were assumed to have a baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 
8.3%. Patients using rt-CGM were assumed to have a 0.56% reduction in HbA1c 
based on the mean difference between groups after 12 months of follow-up. 
Reduced fingerstick testing when using rt-CGM was associated with a quality of 
life (QoL) benefit. The analysis was performed over a lifetime time horizon from 
a National Health Service (NHS) perspective, including only direct costs from 
published data. Future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per 
annum. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Projections showed that rt-CGM was associated with increased 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.731 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
and increased mean total lifetime costs of Great British pounds (GBP) 2694, and 
an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 3684 per QALY compared with SMBG. 
Key drivers of outcomes included HbA1c reduction and reduced fingerstick testing 
QoL benefit.
CONCLUSIONS: Over patient lifetimes, rt-CGM was associated with improved 
clinical outcomes and is highly likely to be cost effective versus SMBG in 
people with T2D on insulin therapy in the UK.

BACKGROUND: In a context of decreasing resources and growing health needs, 
evidence-based health and care policies are essential. This study aims to assess 
the health trends in Belgium between 1990 and 2019, to compare the Belgian 
health status to that of the EU-15 countries, and to identify the main drivers 
in trends over time and country differences within the EU-15.
METHODS: We extracted estimates from the GBD 2019 study via the GBD results tool 
and visualization tools. We compared the Belgian health status with 14 European 
Union comparator countries between 1990 and 2019, and decomposed the time trends 
and country differences into the unique contributions of the different 
underlying causes of death and disability.
RESULTS: Life expectancy (LE) in Belgium improved significantly between 1990 and 
2019 for both men and women. Belgium age-standardised mortality rates dropped 
significantly for men (-40%) and women (-33%) between 1990 and 2019. Overall, 
Belgium age-standardised disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates dropped by 
23%. This decrease is mainly due to decreasing trends in age-standardised years 
of life lost (YLL) rates while age-standardised years lived with disability 
(YLD) rates remained stable. Compared to EU-15, Belgium's ranking in terms of 
age-standardised DALY rates worsened for both men and women in 2019. Self-harm 
and falls are major causes of disease burden, with DALY rates that are higher 
than in many other EU-15 countries, indicating a realistic potential for 
improvement. Lung cancer DALY rates remain worrisome for men, and even show an 
increasing trend for women. Increasing trends of headache disorders, drug use 
disorders, and diabetes, require further attention.
CONCLUSION: Non-communicable diseases remain the main contributors for health 
burden in Belgium, with disability accounting for an increasingly larger share 
of the disease burden. Despite considerable improvements, Belgium's ranking for 
DALYs decreased between 1990 and 2019 compared to the EU-15. This study 
identified priority causes of disease burden based on their contributions to 
current evolutions and EU-15 differences. Since many of these causes are 
considered to be avoidable, primary and secondary prevention are crucial 
elements for reducing the burden of disease on the healthcare system.

The differential diagnosis of abdominal pain ranges from benign 
to life-threatening conditions. This case report describes the importance of the 
differential diagnosis and a faster and more accurate diagnosis. A 75-year-old 
male presented to the emergency room (ER) with diffuse abdominal pain, 
associated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a fever of 38.5ºC since the previous 
day. Medical history included hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Clinical 
examination showed hypotension and a distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness 
in all quadrants. Blood tests revealed a hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, and an 
arterial blood gas test revealed metabolic acidosis and lactate of 8 mmol/L. 
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 
large aneurysm in the infrarenal aorta with an extension of about 17x8x8 cm and 
an exuberant mural thrombus. The patient underwent endovascular treatment of the 
aneurysm; however, he died during surgery.

BACKGROUND: Quantitative attribution of the burden of disease due to population 
aging is an important part of setting meaningful global health priorities. This 
study comprehensively examines the burden of disease attributable to population 
aging in 188 countries from 1990 to 2019, incorporates a comprehensive range of 
diseases, and projects the burden of disease due to population aging till 2050.
METHODS: We extracted data from 1990 to 2019 for 188 countries from the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2019. We decomposed the change in disease burden into 
the contribution of the age structure of the population, population size, and 
age-specific disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rates due to all other 
reasons. We used the Bayesian age-period-cohort model to evaluate the effects of 
age on temporal trends, and then to predict the possible disease burden in 2050.
RESULTS: At the global level, the change in total DALYs associated with age 
structure, population size, and all other reasons is 27.4%, 16.8%, and 89.4% 
(absolute level of DALYs attributable to age structure: -15.20 million, 9.32 
million, and -49.58 million) of the absolute level of DALYs gap between 2019 and 
1990. The absolute level of DALYs changes attributable to age structure for 
communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases were negative in all 
income groups from 1990 to 2019. For non-communicable diseases, the contribution 
was positive except in the low-income group. For injuries, the contribution was 
positive in lower-middle-income groups and low-income groups. By 2050, DALY 
rates decreased in all income groups, if compared to 2019. However, a total of 
132 countries may see a gradual increase of all-cause DALYs attributable to 
population aging.
CONCLUSIONS: The direction and intensity of the effects of population aging on 
the burden of disease vary by region and disease, with huge implications for 
global health in the future.

Trypanosoma rangeli is a protozoan that infects triatomines and mammals in 
Central and South America. Although it does not cause disease to humans, this 
parasite produces different levels of pathogenicity to its invertebrate host, 
mainly in species of the genus Rhodnius. In this study, we followed T. 
rangeli-infected and uninfected pairs throughout their adult lives and measured 
the amount of blood ingested, number of eggs laid, number of eggs hatched and 
proportion of infertile eggs, as well as female life expectancy. We found that 
all reproductive parameters were drastically decreased during infection, mainly 
due to the reduced amount of blood the infected insects ingested throughout 
their lives. Reproductive parameters were also affected by the reduction of the 
life expectancy of infected females, as survival was positively correlated with 
the number of eggs laid. The strategies used by the parasite to be transmitted 
are discussed in view of the pathological effects it causes in the insect.

BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions (DHIs) can improve the provision of 
health care services. To fully account for their effects in economic 
evaluations, traditional methods based on measuring health-related quality of 
life may not be appropriate, as nonhealth and process outcomes are likely to be 
relevant too.
PURPOSE: This systematic review identifies, assesses, and synthesizes the 
arguments on the analytical frameworks and outcome measures used in the economic 
evaluations of DHIs. The results informed recommendations for future economic 
evaluations.
DATA SOURCES: We ran searches on multiple databases, complemented by gray 
literature and backward and forward citation searches.
STUDY SELECTION: We included records containing theoretical and empirical 
arguments associated with the use of analytical frameworks and outcome measures 
for economic evaluations of DHIs. Following title/abstract and full-text 
screening, our final analysis included 15 studies.
DATA EXTRACTION: The arguments we extracted related to analytical frameworks (14 
studies), generic outcome measures (5 studies), techniques used to elicit 
utility values (3 studies), and disease-specific outcome measures and 
instruments to collect health states data (both from 2 studies).
DATA SYNTHESIS: Rather than assessing the quality of the studies, we critically 
assessed and synthesized the extracted arguments. Building on this synthesis, we 
developed a 3-stage set of recommendations in which we encourage the use of 
impact matrices and analyses of equity impacts to integrate traditional economic 
evaluation methods.
LIMITATIONS: Our review and recommendations explored but not fully covered other 
potentially important aspects of economic evaluations that were outside our 
scope.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic review that summarizes the arguments 
on how the effects of DHIs could be measured in economic evaluations. Our 
recommendations will help design future economic evaluations.
HIGHLIGHTS: Using traditional outcome measures based on health-related quality 
of life (such as the quality-adjusted life-year) may not be appropriate in 
economic evaluations of digital health interventions, which are likely to 
trigger nonhealth and process outcomes.This is the first systematic review to 
investigate how the effects of digital health interventions could be measured in 
economic evaluations.We extracted and synthesized different arguments from the 
literature, outlining advantages and disadvantages associated with different 
methods used to measure the effects of digital health interventions.We propose a 
methodological set of recommendations in which 1) we suggest that researchers 
consider the use of impact matrices and cost-consequence analysis, 2) we discuss 
the suitability of analytical frameworks and outcome measures available in 
economic evaluations, and 3) we highlight the need for analyses of equity 
impacts.

Health Outcomes, Income and Income Inequality: Revisiting the Empirical 
Relationship.

In this paper we revisit the relationship between health outcomes, income, and 
income inequality by applying alternative panel methodologies to a dataset of 
high-income countries spanning the time period 1980-2017. In this direction, we 
adopt alternative methodological frameworks in order to provide a) meaningful 
results by taking into account standard errors that alleviate problems of 
cross-sectional (spatial) and temporal dependence, and b) insights into the 
underlying relationships at several points of the conditional distribution of 
the health outcomes dependent variables. The evidence strongly supports the 
significant role that income plays in determining health outcomes. The findings 
relating to income inequality and nonlinear terms are more fragmented in that 
their significance and sign-direction depend on the functional form and the 
respective quantiles of the distribution the relationships are evaluated.

Chronic pathologies or non-communicable diseases (NCDs) include cardiovascular 
diseases, metabolic syndrome, neurological diseases, respiratory disorders and 
cancer. They are the leading global cause of human mortality and morbidity. 
Given their chronic nature, NCDs represent a growing social and economic burden, 
hence urging the need for ameliorating the existing preventive strategies, and 
for finding novel tackling therapies. NCDs are highly correlated with unhealthy 
lifestyle habits (such as high-fat and high-glucose diet, or sedentary life). In 
general, lifestyle approaches that might improve these habits, including dietary 
consumption of fresh vegetables, fruits and fibers, may contrast NCD symptoms 
and prolong life expectancy of affected people. Polyphenols (PPLs) are 
plant-derived molecules with demonstrated biological activities in humans, which 
include: radical scavenging and anti-oxidant activities, capability to modulate 
inflammation, as well as human enzymes, and even to bind nuclear receptors. For 
these reasons, PPLs are currently tested, both preclinically and clinically, as 
dietary adjuvants for the prevention and treatment of NCDs. In this review, we 
describe the human metabolism and bioactivity of PPLs. Also, we report what is 
currently known about PPLs interaction with gastro-intestinal enzymes and gut 
microbiota, which allows their biotransformation in many different metabolites 
with several biological functions. The systemic bioactivity of PPLs and the 
newly available PPL-delivery nanosystems are also described in detail. Finally, 
the up-to-date clinical studies assessing both safety and efficacy of dietary 
PPLs in individuals with different NCDs are hereby reported. Overall, the 
clinical results support the notion that PPLs from fruits, vegetables, but also 
from leaves or seeds extracts, are safe and show significant positive results in 
ameliorating symptoms and improving the whole quality of life of people with 
NCDs.

IMPORTANCE: Combination immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab has markedly 
improved outcomes for patients with advanced melanoma. However, these therapies 
pose a considerable financial burden to both patients and the health care 
system. The ADAPT-IT trial demonstrated comparable progression-free and overall 
survival for patients with response-adapted ipilimumab discontinuation compared 
with standard of care (SOC).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of ipilimumab discontinuation for 
patients with interim imaging-confirmed tumor response in the treatment of 
advanced melanoma.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cost-effectiveness analysis was 
performed using data from the ADAPT-IT (follow-up of 33 months) and CheckMate 
067 (follow-up of 6.5 years) trials, as well as published literature over the 
ADAPT-IT trial duration of 33 months. The analysis was performed in a US setting 
from a US-payer perspective, and the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set 
at $100 000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). A total of 355 patients with 
previously untreated melanoma (unresectable stage III or IV metastatic melanoma) 
were included.
EXPOSURE: Response-adapted ipilimumab discontinuation compared with SOC therapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes of the CheckMate trial were 
overall survival and progression-free survival, while that of ADAPT-IT was 
objective response. This informed a decision model to estimate lifetime costs 
and QALYs associated with both strategies. Incremental cost, effectiveness, and 
cost-effectiveness ratio were assessed. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were 
performed to account for variability in trials and input parameters.
RESULTS: Of the 355 patients included in the analysis, 41 patients were from the 
ADAPT-IT trial (median age, 65 years; 28 [68%] male) and 314 patients from the 
CheckMate 067 trial (median age, 61 years; 206 [66%] male). Response-adapted 
treatment was the cost-effective option in 94.0% of scenarios based on Monte 
Carlo simulations, with a dominant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and an 
incremental net monetary benefit of $28 849 compared with SOC therapy. Cost 
savings were estimated at $19 891 per patient compared with SOC. In scenario 
analyses, current SOC was only considered as a cost-effective option under best 
survival assumptions and if the willingness-to-pay threshold exceeded 
$630 000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This economic evaluation demonstrated that 
response-adapted treatment de-escalation in patients with advanced melanoma may 
lead to considerable savings in health care costs and could represent the most 
cost-effective strategy across various resource settings. Future trials should 
aim to provide further evidence on noninferiority.

DNA damage-induced nuclear import of HSP90α is promoted by Aha1.

The interplay between yHSP90α (Hsp82) and Rad51 has been implicated in the DNA 
double-strand break repair (DSB) pathway in yeast. Here we report that nuclear 
translocation of yHSP90α and its recruitment to the DSB end are essential for 
homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair in yeast. The HsHSP90α 
possesses an amino-terminal extension which is phosphorylated upon DNA damage. 
We find that the absence of the amino-terminal extension in yHSP90α does not 
compromise its nuclear import, and the nonphosphorylatable-mutant HsHSP90αT7A 
could be imported to the yeast nucleus upon DNA damage. Interestingly, the 
flexible charged-linker (CL) domains of both yHSP90α and HsHSP90α play a 
critical role during their nuclear translocation. The conformational restricted 
CL mutant yHSP90α∆(211-259), but not a shorter deletion version 
yHSP90α∆(211-242), fails to reach the nucleus. As the CL domain of yHSP90α is 
critical for its interaction with Aha1, we investigated whether Aha1 promotes 
the nuclear import of yHSP90α. We found that the nuclear import of yHSP90α is 
severely affected in ∆aha1 strain. Moreover, Aha1 is accumulated in the nucleus 
during DNA damage. Hence Aha1 may serve as a potential target for inhibiting 
nuclear function of yHSP90α. The increased sensitivity of ∆aha1 strain to 
genotoxic agents strengthens this notion.
