To explore the relationship between occurrence of chronic diseases and the aging 
process, the role of age in death from disease was assessed by receiver 
operating curve (ROC) analysis, to quantify differences in the age compositions 
between death and survival groups using data for various diseases and from 
regions of different socioeconomic status in China. Results showed that the 
contribution of age to different diseases was varied. Increase in life 
expectancy was associated with relatively old age at the time of death for five 
of seven diseases. For cancer and diseases of the circulatory system, increase 
in life expectancy was associated with relatively younger age at the time of 
death. These findings indicate that chronic diseases may occur independently of 
aging and may have a programmed onset pattern.

Active biofilms of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa, W.) starch were prepared by 
incorporating gold nanoparticles stabilised by an ionic silsesquioxane that 
contains the 1,4-diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane chloride group. The biofilms were 
characterised and their antimicrobial activity was evaluated against 
Escherichiacoli and Staphylococcusaureus. The presence of gold nanoparticles 
produces an improvement in the mechanical, optical and morphological properties, 
maintaining the thermal and barrier properties unchanged when compared to the 
standard biofilm. The active biofilms exhibited strong antibacterial activity 
against food-borne pathogens with inhibition percentages of 99% against E. coli 
and 98% against S. aureus. These quinoa starch biofilms containing gold 
nanoparticles are very promising to be used as active food packaging for the 
maintenance of food safety and extension of the shelf life of packaged foods.

OBJECTIVE: To review the effect of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic 
intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) 
in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis.
BACKGROUND: CRS and HIPEC is increasingly performed with curative intent for 
peritoneal carcinomatosis. Significant morbidity rates are reported in the 
context of limited life-expectancy, necessitating accurate post-operative HRQOL 
outcome data.
METHODS: A systematic review of clinical studies published after January 2000 
was performed using strict eligibility criteria. Key outcomes measures were 
post-operative HRQOL compared to pre-operative levels and reference populations. 
Quality appraisal and data tabulation were performed using pre-determined forms. 
Data were synthesised by narrative review and random-effects meta-analysis. Tau2 
and I2 values and Funnel plots were analysed for consistency and bias.
RESULTS: 15 studies (1583 patients) were included. HRQOL declines at the 3-4 
month time-point before becoming similar or better compared to pre-operative 
levels at 1 year. The pooled-effects of combined post-operative functional 
assessment of cancer therapy and European organisation for research and 
treatment quality of life questionnaire scores were significantly improved from 
baseline on overall health status (p=0.001) and emotional health (p=0.001). 
Physical health (p=0.83), social health (p=0.48) and functional health (p=0.24) 
remain similar. HRQOL after 1 year is less clear, but benefits may persist up to 
5 years especially on overall and physical health domains. Evidence is 
conflicted and inconclusive on HRQOL compared to reference populations. Levels 
of consistency and bias were acceptable.
CONCLUSIONS: CRS and HIPEC for peritoneal carcinomatosis can confer small to 
medium benefits for HRQOL. These results should be interpreted with in caution 
due to the small studies and absence of more randomised controlled trials.

The relationship between reef-building corals and light-harvesting pigments of 
zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium sp.) has been acknowledged for decades. The 
photosynthetic activity of the algal endocellular symbionts may provide up to 
90% of the energy needed for the coral holobiont. This relationship limits the 
bathymetric distribution of coral reefs to the upper 100 m of tropical 
shorelines. However, even corals growing under high light intensities have to 
supplement the photosynthates translocated from the algae by predation on 
nutrient-rich zooplankton. New information has revealed how the fate of carbon 
acquired through photosynthesis differs from that secured by predation, whose 
rates are controlled by light-induced tentacular extension. The Goreau paradigm 
of "light-enhanced calcification" is being reevaluated, based on evidence that 
blue light stimulates coral calcification independently from photosynthesis 
rates. Furthermore, under dim light, calcification rates were stoichiometrically 
uncoupled from photosynthesis. The rates of photosynthesis of the zooxanthellae 
exhibit a clear endogenous rhythmicity maintained by light patterns. This daily 
pattern is concomitant with a periodicity of all the antioxidant protective 
mechanisms that wax and wane to meet the concomitant fluctuation in oxygen 
evolution. The phases of the moon are involved in the triggering of coral 
reproduction and control the spectacular annual mass-spawning events taking 
place in several reefs. The intensity and directionality of the underwater light 
field affect the architecture of coral colonies, leading to an optimization of 
the exposure of the zooxanthellae to light. We present a summary of major gaps 
in our understanding of the relationship between light and corals as a roadmap 
for future research.

23% of the total global burden of disease is attributable to disorders in people 
aged 60 years and older. Although the proportion of the burden arising from 
older people (≥60 years) is highest in high-income regions, disability-adjusted 
life years (DALYs) per head are 40% higher in low-income and middle-income 
regions, accounted for by the increased burden per head of population arising 
from cardiovascular diseases, and sensory, respiratory, and infectious 
disorders. The leading contributors to disease burden in older people are 
cardiovascular diseases (30·3% of the total burden in people aged 60 years and 
older), malignant neoplasms (15·1%), chronic respiratory diseases (9·5%), 
musculoskeletal diseases (7·5%), and neurological and mental disorders (6·6%). A 
substantial and increased proportion of morbidity and mortality due to chronic 
disease occurs in older people. Primary prevention in adults aged younger than 
60 years will improve health in successive cohorts of older people, but much of 
the potential to reduce disease burden will come from more effective primary, 
secondary, and tertiary prevention targeting older people. Obstacles include 
misplaced global health priorities, ageism, the poor preparedness of health 
systems to deliver age-appropriate care for chronic diseases, and the complexity 
of integrating care for complex multimorbidities. Although population ageing is 
driving the worldwide epidemic of chronic diseases, substantial untapped 
potential exists to modify the relation between chronological age and health. 
This objective is especially important for the most age-dependent disorders (ie, 
dementia, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and vision impairment), 
for which the burden of disease arises more from disability than from mortality, 
and for which long-term care costs outweigh health expenditure. The societal 
cost of these disorders is enormous.

Ageing is a dynamic process, and trends in the health status of older adults 
aged at least 60 years vary over time because of several factors. We examined 
reported trends in morbidity and mortality in older adults during the past two 
decades to identify patterns of ageing across the world. We showed some evidence 
for compression of morbidity (ie, a reduced amount of time spent in worse 
health), in four types of studies: 1) of good quality based on assessment 
criteria scores; 2) those in which a disability-related or impairment-related 
measure of morbidity was used; 3) longitudinal studies; or 4) studies undertaken 
in the USA and other high-income countries. Many studies, however, reported 
contrasting evidence (ie, for an expansion of morbidity), but with different 
methods, these measures are not directly comparable. Expansion of morbidity was 
more common when trends in chronic disease prevalence were studied. Our 
secondary analysis of data from longitudinal ageing surveys presents similar 
results. However, patterns of limitations in functioning vary substantially 
between countries and within countries over time, with no discernible 
explanation. Data from low-income countries are very sparse, and efforts to 
obtain information about the health of older adults in less-developed regions of 
the world are urgently needed. We especially need studies that focus on refining 
measurements of health, functioning, and disability in older people, with a core 
set of domains of functioning, that investigate the effects of these evolving 
patterns on the health-care system and their economic implications.

In high-income countries, life expectancy at age 60 years has increased in 
recent decades. Falling tobacco use (for men only) and cardiovascular disease 
mortality (for both men and women) are the main factors contributing to this 
rise. In high-income countries, avoidable male mortality has fallen since 1980 
because of decreases in avoidable cardiovascular deaths. For men in Latin 
America, the Caribbean, Europe, and central Asia, and for women in all regions, 
avoidable mortality has changed little or increased since 1980. As yet, no 
evidence exists that the rate of improvement in older age mortality (60 years 
and older) is slowing down or that older age deaths are being compressed into a 
narrow age band as they approach a hypothesised upper limit to longevity.

Between now and 2030, every country will experience population ageing-a trend 
that is both pronounced and historically unprecedented. Over the past six 
decades, countries of the world had experienced only a slight increase in the 
share of people aged 60 years and older, from 8% to 10%. But in the next four 
decades, this group is expected to rise to 22% of the total population-a jump 
from 800 million to 2 billion people. Evidence suggests that cohorts entering 
older age now are healthier than previous ones. However, progress has been very 
uneven, as indicated by the wide gaps in population health (measured by life 
expectancy) between the worst (Sierra Leone) and best (Japan) performing 
countries, now standing at a difference of 36 years for life expectancy at birth 
and 15 years for life expectancy at age 60 years. Population ageing poses 
challenges for countries' economies, and the health of older populations is of 
concern. Older people have greater health and long-term care needs than younger 
people, leading to increased expenditure. They are also less likely to work if 
they are unhealthy, and could impose an economic burden on families and society. 
Like everyone else, older people need both physical and economic security, but 
the burden of providing these securities will be falling on a smaller portion of 
the population. Pension systems will be stressed and will need reassessment 
along with retirement policies. Health systems, which have not in the past been 
oriented toward the myriad health problems and long-term care needs of older 
people and have not sufficiently emphasised disease prevention, can respond in 
different ways to the new demographic reality and the associated changes in 
population health. Along with behavioural adaptations by individuals and 
businesses, the nature of such policy responses will establish whether 
population ageing will lead to major macroeconomic difficulties.

PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), cost 
effectiveness and cost utility associated with VNS therapy in children with 
refractory epilepsy in a developing country.
METHODS: Retrospective review of all children who underwent VNS implantation at 
King Abdullah University Hospital and Jordan University Hospital in Jordan.
RESULTS: Twenty eight patients (16 males) had implantation of the VNS therapy 
system between the years 2007 and 2011. Mean age at implantation was 9.4 years. 
Mean duration of epilepsy prior to implantation was 6.5 years. The most common 
seizure type was generalized tonic clonic seizures. Fifteen patients showed a 
50% or more reduction in seizure frequency. There was a significant reduction in 
total number of seizures (p=0.002) and emergency room (ER) visits (p=0.042) 
after VNS therapy. Atonic seizures were more likely to respond than generalized 
tonic clonic seizures, p=0.034. Direct hospital costs prior to VNS implantation 
were analyzed in relation to ER visits and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. 
Cost savings per patient did reduce the financial burden of the device by about 
30%. There was a QALY gain per lifetime of 3.78 years for children and 1 year 
for adolescents.
CONCLUSION: Response to VNS implantation in Jordan was favorable and similar to 
what has been previously reported. QALY gain and cost per QALY analysis were 
encouraging. Cost savings were related to reduction in seizure severity. In 
circumstances of limited resources as in developing countries, targeting 
patients with frequent utilization of health services would improve cost 
effectiveness.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a serious 
complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. If DCI is suspected 
clinically, imaging methods designed to detect angiographic vasospasm or 
regional hypoperfusion are often used before instituting therapy. Uncertainty in 
the strength of the relationship between imaged vasospasm or perfusion deficits 
and DCI-related outcomes raises the question of whether imaging to select 
patients for therapy improves outcomes in clinical DCI.
METHODS: Decision analysis was performed using Markov models. Strategies were 
either to treat all patients immediately or to first undergo diagnostic testing 
by digital subtraction angiography or computed tomography angiography to assess 
for angiographic vasospasm, or computed tomography perfusion to assess for 
perfusion deficits. According to current practice guidelines, treatment 
consisted of induced hypertension. Outcomes were survival in terms of life-years 
and quality-adjusted life-years.
RESULTS: When treatment was assumed to be ineffective in nonvasospasm patients, 
Treat All and digital subtraction angiography were equivalent strategies; when a 
moderate treatment effect was assumed in nonvasospasm patients, Treat All became 
the superior strategy. Treating all patients was also superior to selecting 
patients for treatment via computed tomography perfusion. One-way sensitivity 
analyses demonstrated that the models were robust; 2- and 3-way sensitivity 
analyses with variation of disease and treatment parameters reinforced dominance 
of the Treat All strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Imaging studies to test for the presence of angiographic vasospasm 
or perfusion deficits in patients with clinical DCI do not seem helpful in 
selecting which patients should undergo treatment and may not improve outcomes. 
Future directions include validating these results in prospective cohort 
studies.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy increases, HIV-infected patients are facing a 
wide array of metabolic complications, including diabetes mellitus (DM) and 
impaired fasting glucose (IFG). However, little is known about the incidence of 
and risk factors for glycemic disorders in Chinese HIV-infected patients.
METHODS: Longitudinal data were pooled from a multicenter clinical trial of 
combination antiretroviral regimens between 2009 and 2010 across Mainland China. 
DM was defined as fasting glucose level ≥7.0 mmol/L and IFG as between 5.6 and 
6.9 mmol/L on 2 separate measurements. We calculated the incidence densities of 
DM and IFG. Risk factors for DM and IFG were also identified.
RESULTS: Four hundred fifteen patients contributed 457.35 person-years of 
follow-up. The incidence densities of DM and IFG were 2.62 and 35.64 per 100 
person-years, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, advanced age [adjusted 
hazard ratio (HR): 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01 to 1.04], hepatitis 
B virus coinfection (adjusted HR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.06 to 2.38), and baseline 
fasting glucose (adjusted HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.63) were associated with 
DM and IFG.
CONCLUSIONS: A high incidence of DM and IFG was detected in Chinese HIV-infected 
patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Clinicians should be 
aware of the potential for an increased risk of glycemic disorders in Chinese 
HIV-infected patients, particularly those of advanced age, with hepatitis B

and projection. Although China is the world's most populous country with 
approximately a fifth of the world's population, none of the empirical tables 
from mainland China were used in calibrating the existing models. In this paper, 
we applied recent three model life table systems with different inputs to China 
mortality data to investigate whether or not these systems truly reflect Chinese 
mortality epidemiological patterns and whether or not system biases exist. The 
resulting residuals show that, in most cases, the male infant mortality rate 
(1q0), adult mortality rate (45q15) and old age mortality rate (20q60) have a 
strong bias towards being overestimated and the life expectancy at birth (e0) 
bias is underestimated. We also give the detailed results for each case. 
Furthermore, we found that the average relative errors (AREs) for females are 
more than those for males for e0, 45q15 and 20q60, but for 1q0, males have 
larger AREs in the Wilmoth and Murray systems. We also found that the urban 
population has more errors than the rural population in almost all cases. 
Finally, by comparing the AREs with 10 other countries, we found the errors for 
China are more than those for other countries in most cases. It is concluded 
that these existing model life table systems cannot accurately reflect Chinese 
mortality epidemiological situations and trajectories. Therefore, model life 
tables should be used with caution when applied to China on the basis of 5q0.

Defining novel health-related quality of life domains in lung transplantation: a 
qualitative analysis.

PURPOSE: Health-related quality of life (HRQL) domains vary across disease 
conditions and are determined by standards, values, and priorities internal to 
patients. Although the clinical goals of lung transplantation are to improve 
patient survival and HRQL, what defines HRQL in lung transplantation is unknown. 
Employing a qualitative approach, we aimed to identify HRQL domains important in 
lung transplantation.
METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews in purposefully sampled lung 
transplant recipients (n = 8) representing a spectrum of ages, gender, 
indications for transplantation, and time since transplantation as well as 
healthcare practitioners representing a spectrum of practitioner types (n = 9). 
Grounded theory was used to identify HRQL domains important in lung 
transplantation, building on but going beyond domains already defined in the 
SF-36, the most commonly used instrument in this population.
RESULTS: In addition to confirming the relevance of the eight SF-36 domains, we 
identified 11 novel HRQL domains. Palliation of respiratory symptoms was 
identified as important. After transplant surgery, new HRQL domains emerged 
including: distressing symptoms spanning multiple organ systems, worry about 
infection and acute rejection, treatment burden, and depression. Further, 
patients identified challenges to intimacy, changes in social relationships, and 
problems with cognitive functioning. Saliently, worry about limited life 
expectancy was pervasive and impaired life planning.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that HRQL in lung transplantation is defined by both 
generic and transplant-specific domains. Delineating and refining these domains 
can inform efforts to improve clinical outcomes and HRQL measurement in lung 
transplantation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia which affects 
people older than 60 years of age. In AD, the dysregulation of the amyloid-beta 
(Aβ) level leads to the appearance of senile plaques which contain Aβ 
depositions. Aβ is a complex biological molecule which interacts with many types 
of receptors and/or forms insoluble assemblies and, eventually, its 
nonphysiological depositions alternate with the normal neuronal conditions. In 
this situation, AD signs appear and the patients experience marked cognitional 
disabilities. In general, intellect, social skills, personality, and memory are 
influenced by this disease and, in the long run, it leads to a reduction in 
quality of life and life expectancy. Due to the pivotal role of Aβ in the 
pathobiology of AD, a great deal of effort has been made to reveal its exact 
role in neuronal dysfunctions and to finding efficacious therapeutic strategies 
against its adverse neuronal outcomes. Hence, the determination of its different 
molecular assemblies and the mechanisms underlying its pathological effects are 
of interest. In the present paper, some of the well-established structural forms 
of Aβ, its interactions with various receptors and possible molecular and 
cellular mechanisms underlying its neurotoxicity are discussed. In addition, 
several Aβ-based rodent models of AD are reviewed.

Italy: health system review.

Italy is the sixth largest country in Europe and has the second highest average 
life expectancy, reaching 79.4 years for men and 84.5 years for women in 2011. 
There are marked regional differences for both men and women in most health 
indicators, reflecting the economic and social imbalance between the north and 
south of the country. The main diseases affecting the population are circulatory 
diseases, malignant tumours and respiratory diseases. Italy's health care system 
is a regionally based national health service that provides universal coverage 
largely free of charge at the point of delivery. The main source of financing is 
national and regional taxes, supplemented by copayments for pharmaceuticals and 
outpatient care. In 2012, total health expenditure accounted for 9.2 percent of 
GDP (slightly below the EU average of 9.6 percent). Public sources made up 78.2 
percent of total health care spending. While the central government provides a 
stewardship role, setting the fundamental principles and goals of the health 
system and determining the core benefit package of health services available to 
all citizens, the regions are responsible for organizing and delivering primary, 
secondary and tertiary health care services as well as preventive and health 
promotion services. Faced with the current economic constraints of having to 
contain or even reduce health expenditure, the largest challenge facing the 
health system is to achieve budgetary goals without reducing the provision of 
health services to patients. This is related to the other key challenge of 
ensuring equity across regions, where gaps in service provision and health 
system performance persist. Other issues include ensuring the quality of 
professionals managing facilities, promoting group practice and other integrated 
care organizational models in primary care, and ensuring that the concentration 
of organizational control by regions of health-care providers does not stifle 
innovation.

The Endocrinology of Ageing: A Mini-Review.

Jones CM(1), Boelaert K.

Birmingham, UK.

Significant advances in health and social wellbeing have led to linear gains in 
life expectancy and an accompanying increase in the burden imposed by 
age-related morbidities. Complex alterations in hormonal networks which regulate 
homeostasis and survival may underlie this poor adaptation to later life, as 
exemplified by an increased fracture risk amongst post-menopausal women. Beyond 
overt under- or overactivity of hormonal axes, changes in the concentrations of 
regulatory hormones may also impact on health and disease. Subclinical 
hyperthyroidism, a disorder characterised by normal thyroxine levels in the 
presence of decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone, is, for instance, 
independently associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation amongst 
elderly populations. Both the menopause and subclinical thyroid disease 
demonstrate the difficulty in reversing endocrine changes in later life, with 
minimal impact from thyroxine therapy in subclinical hypothyroidism and multiple 
reports of harm resulting from hormone replacement therapy in peri- and 
post-menopausal women. Given these findings, strategies to locally regulate 
hormone bioavailability by altering pre-receptor metabolism may offer greater 
therapeutic potential in the fight against age-related disease. This review aims 
to provide an overview of the ageing endocrine system and its potential impact 
on health and disease in the elderly. It will postulate that strategies to 
coordinate pre-receptor hormone metabolism and a greater understanding of 
putative hormonal longevity pathways may offer key new drug targets in the fight 
against ageing, and will argue against applying the conventional endocrine maxim 
of 'block and replace' to hormonal changes seen during ageing.

Intestinal failure-associated liver disease and the use of fish oil-based lipid 
emulsions.

Digestive Diseases, Hospital Necker-Enfants Malades, University of 
Paris-Descartes, Paris, France.

Intestinal failure (IF) is caused by the critical reduction of functional gut 
mass below the minimal amount necessary for adequate digestion and absorption to 
satisfy body nutrient and fluid requirements for maintenance in adults and 
growth in children. The advent of parenteral nutrition (PN) resulted in a 
dramatic improvement in life expectancy of patients suffering IF, but it has its 
own complications, such as catheter related sepsis. In pediatric patients 
suffering IF, intraluminal intestinal bacterial overgrowth may cause bacterial 
translocation and subsequent cholestasis and liver fibrosis. With our current 
understanding of the genesis of intestinal failure associated liver disease 
(IFALD), it should be prevented or at least early recognized and treated 
especially in patients experiencing prematurity and/or sepsis. Targeting harmful 
cytokine responses can be expected to reduce the severity and frequency of 
IFALD. In that view, prevention of sepsis, appropriate management of enteral 
feeding, prevention and treatment of intestinal bacterial overgrowth and the 
effects of fish oil, as providing omega-3 fatty with anti-inflammatory effects, 
are promising in avoiding or reversing cholestasis. This chapter aims to review 
both IF and PN related factors of liver disease with special emphasize on 
inflammation as cause of liver injury and on the use of fish oil based lipid 
emulsions as a provision of both alpha-tocopherol (200 g/l of 20% emulsion), as 
anti-oxidant agent and long-chain PUFAs.

BACKGROUND: Untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is linked to poor 
prognosis. While sorafenib is the current recommended treatment for advanced 
HCC, radioembolisation (RE; also called selective internal radiation therapy or 
SIRT) with yttrium-90 microspheres has shown efficacy in cohort studies. 
However, there are no head-to-head trials comparing radiation therapy with 
yttrium-90 microspheres and sorafenib in advanced HCC. The SARAH trial has been 
designed to compare the efficacy and safety of sorafenib therapy and RE using 
yttrium-90 resin microspheres (SIR-Spheres™; Sirtex Medical Limited, North 
Sydney, Australia) in patients with advanced HCC. Quality of life (QoL) and 
cost-effectiveness will also be compared between therapies.
METHODS/DESIGN: SARAH is a prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label, 
multicentre trial comparing the efficacy of RE with sorafenib in the treatment 
of patients with advanced HCC. The trial aims to recruit adults with a life 
expectancy of >3 months, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
status ≤ 1, and: advanced HCC according to the Barcelona criteria (stage C) or 
recurrent HCC after surgical or thermoablative treatment who are not eligible 
for surgical resection, liver transplantation or thermal ablation; or two rounds 
of failed chemoembolisation. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive either 
RE or sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. All patients will be monitored for between 
12 and 48 months following start of treatment. The primary endpoint of the SARAH 
trial is overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints include: adverse events, 
progression-free survival at 6 months; tumour response rate; general or liver 
disease-specific QoL scores; and cost of each treatment strategy. Assuming an 
increase in median OS of 4 months with RE versus sorafenib therapy, randomising 
at least 400 patients (200 in each treatment arm) will be sufficient for 80% 
power and a bilateral alpha risk of 5%; therefore, 440 patients will be enrolled 
to allow for 10% loss of patients due to ineligibility.
DISCUSSION: The SARAH trial is the first randomised head-to-head study to 
compare RE with sorafenib in advanced HCC, and will establish the potential role 
of RE in HCC treatment guidelines.

Animals in a poor biological state face reduced life expectancy, and as a 
consequence should make decisions that prioritize immediate survival and 
reproduction over long-term benefits. We tested the prediction that if, as has 
been suggested, developmental telomere attrition is a biomarker of state and 
future life expectancy, then individuals who have undergone greater 
developmental telomere attrition should display greater choice impulsivity as 
adults. We measured impulsive decision-making in a cohort of European starlings 
(Sturnus vulgaris) in which we had previously manipulated developmental telomere 
attrition by cross-fostering sibling chicks into broods of different sizes. We 
show that as predicted by state-dependent optimality models, individuals who had 
sustained greater developmental telomere attrition and who had shorter current 
telomeres made more impulsive foraging decisions as adults, valuing smaller, 
sooner food rewards more highly than birds with less attrition and longer 
telomeres. Our findings shed light on the biological embedding of early 
adversity and support a functional explanation for its consequences that could 
be applicable to other species, including humans.

Globally, nations are confronted with the challenge of providing affordable 
health services to populations with increasing levels of noncommunicable and 
chronic disease. Paradoxically, many nations can both celebrate increases in 
life expectancy and bemoan parallel increases in chronic disease prevalence. 
Simply put, despite living longer, not all of that time is spent in good health. 
Combined with factors such as rising levels of obesity and related 
noncommunicable disease, the demand for health services is requiring nations to 
consider new models of affordable health care. Given the level of disease 
burden, all staff, not just doctors, need to be part of the solution and 
encouraged to innovate and deliver better and more affordable health care, 
particularly preventative primary health care services. This paper draws 
attention to a range of exemplars to encourage and stimulate readers to think 
beyond traditional models of primary health service delivery. Examples include 
nurse-led, allied health-led, and student-led clinics; student-assisted 
services; and community empowerment models. These are reported for the interest 
of policy makers and health service managers involved in preventative and 
primary health service redesign initiatives.

The aims were to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a new 
benzene-poly-carboxylic acids complex with cis-diammineplatinum (II) dichloride 
(BP-C1) versus placebo and to investigate the long-term tolerability of BP-C1 in 
the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter 
study was performed with a semi-crossover design. Patients allocated to placebo 
switched to BP-C1 after 32 days of treatment. Patients who completed 32 days of 
BP-C1 treatment were offered the opportunity to continue on BP-C1 for an 
additional 32 days in an open-label extension. Patients were then followed up 
for another 28 days. Thirty patients were given daily intramuscular injections 
of 0.035 mg/kg of body weight BP-C1 or placebo for 32 days. Biochemistry, 
hematology, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTC-NCI), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
quality of life questionnaire (QOL-C30 and the breast-cancer-specific BR23) data 
were recorded at screening and after every 16 days of treatment. Computed 
tomography was performed at screening and every 32 days.
RESULTS: The sum of target lesions increased 2.4% in the BP-C1 group and 14.3% 
in the placebo group. Only the increase in the placebo group was significant 
(P=0.013). The difference between the groups was significant in favor of BP-C1 
(P=0.04). There was a significant difference (P=0.026) in favor of BP-C1 
regarding Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) classification. 
The sum of lesions increased slightly in the patients receiving 64 days of
