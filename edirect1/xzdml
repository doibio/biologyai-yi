OBJECTIVE: In order to better incorporate the patient's perspective in medical 
decision making, core outcome sets (COS) are being defined. In the field of 
abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), efforts to capture the patient's perspective 
focus on generic quantitative quality of life (QoL) scales. The question arises 
whether these quantitative scales adequately reflect the patient's perspective 
on QoL, and whether they can be included in the QoL aspect of COS. A scoping 
review of QoL assessment in the context of elective AAA repair was undertaken.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library.
REVIEW METHODS: A scoping review was performed according to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping 
Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Articles reporting QoL assessment in the 
context of elective AAA repair were identified. Quantitative studies (i.e., 
traditional QoL scales) were aligned (triangulation approach) with qualitative 
studies (i.e., patient perspective) to identify parallels and discrepancies. 
Mean Short Form 36 item survey (SF-36) scores were pooled using a random effects 
model to evaluate sensitivity to change.
RESULTS: Thirty-three studies were identified, of which 29 (88%) were 
quantitative and four (12%) qualitative. The 33 studies reported a total of 54 
quantitative QoL scales; the most frequently used were the generic SF-36 (16 
studies) and five dimension EuroQol (EQ-5D; eight studies). Aneurysm specific 
scales were reported by one study. The generic quantitative scales showed poor 
alignment with the patient's perspective. The aneurysm specific scales better 
aligned but missed "concerns regarding symptoms" and "the impact of possible 
outcomes/complications". "Self control and decision making", which was brought 
forward by patients in qualitative studies, was not captured in any of the 
current scales.
CONCLUSION: There is no established tool that fully captures all aspects of the 
patient's perspective appropriate for a COS for elective AAA repair. In order to 
fulfil the need for a COS for the management of, AAA disease, a more 
comprehensive overview of the patient's perspective is required.

Antwerp, Edegem, Antwerp, Belgium.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a lysosomal storage disorder 
characterized by α-L-iduronidase deficiency. Patients present with a broad 
spectrum of disease severity ranging from the most severe phenotype (Hurler) 
with devastating neurocognitive decline, bone disease and early death to 
intermediate (Hurler-Scheie) and more attenuated (Scheie) phenotypes, with a 
normal life expectancy. The most severely affected patients are preferably 
treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which halts the 
neurocognitive decline. Patients with more attenuated phenotypes are treated 
with enzyme replacement therapy. There are several challenges to be met in the 
treatment of MPS I patients. First, to optimize outcome, early recognition of 
the disease and clinical phenotype is needed to guide decisions on therapeutic 
strategies. Second, there is thus far no effective treatment available for MPS I 
bone disease. The pathophysiological mechanisms behind bone disease are largely 
unknown, limiting the development of effective therapeutic strategies. This 
article is a state of the art that comprehensively discusses three of the most 
urgent open issues in MPS I: early diagnosis of MPS I patients, pathophysiology 
of MPS I bone disease, and emerging therapeutic strategies for MPS I bone 
disease.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Individuals with evening chronotype have a higher risk of 
cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, although the underlying mechanisms are 
not well understood. In a population-based cohort, we aimed to investigate the 
association between chronotype and 242 circulating proteins from three panels of 
established or candidate biomarkers of cardiometabolic processes.
METHODS: In 2,471 participants (49.7% men, mean age 61.2 ± 8.4 SD years) from 
the EpiHealth cohort, circulating proteins were analyzed with a multiplex 
proximity extension technique. Participants self-reported their chronotype on a 
five-level scale from extreme morning to extreme evening chronotype. With the 
intermediate chronotype set as the reference, each protein was added as the 
dependent variable in a series of linear regression models adjusted for 
confounders. Next, the chronotype coefficients were jointly tested and the 
resulting p-values adjusted for multiple testing using a false discovery rate 
(5%). For the associations identified, we then analyzed the marginal effect of 
each chronotype category.
RESULTS: We identified 17 proteins associated with chronotype. Evening 
chronotype was positively associated with proteins previously linked to insulin 
resistance and cardiovascular risk, namely retinoic acid receptor protein 2, 
fatty acid-binding protein adipocyte, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and 
plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). Additionally, PAI-1 was inversely 
associated with the extreme morning chronotype.
CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study, proteins previously related to 
cardiometabolic risk were elevated in the evening chronotypes. These results may 
guide future research in the relation between chronotype and cardiometabolic 
disorders.

Sickle cell disease can be life-threatening or chronically debilitating for both 
children and adults. Worldwide, more than 300 000 children are born with sickle 
cell disease every year, over 75% of whom in sub-Saharan Africa. Increased 
awareness and early interventions, such as neonate screening and comprehensive 
care, have led to considerable reductions in mortality in children younger than 
5 years in high-income countries. However, sickle cell disease prevention and 
care have largely been neglected in Africa. Without intervention, 50-90% of 
affected children in many sub-Saharan African countries die before their fifth 
birthday. Fortunately, increasing initiatives in sub-Saharan Africa are piloting 
interventions such as neonate screening and comprehensive care, and as mortality 
declines, quality of life and increased life expectancy become major targets for 
interventions. Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) and haematopoietic stem-cell 
transplantation have already been shown to be effective therapies in high-income 
countries, but are either not widely accessible or too expensive for most 
African populations. These challenges are being alleviated by numerous networks 
evolving through international collaborations that are positively changing the 
outlook of sickle cell disease management in sub-Saharan Africa. In this Series 
paper, we describe the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinicobiological profile, 
and psychosocial effects of sickle cell disease in sub-Saharan Africa. We 
highlight transferable strategies already used for the successful management of 
the condition and key strategies and recommendations for affordable and 
comprehensive care on the continent. TRANSLATION: For the French translation of

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess alcohol-related mortality and 
years of life lost (YLL) in Poland between 1999 and 2017.
METHODS: A database of 7,168,765 death certificates of Polish residents who died 
in 1999-2017 was reviewed. This number included 112,512 people who had died due 
to alcohol consumption. YLL was calculated with the use of the Standard Expected 
Years of Life Lost (SEYLL) measure; its value was related to the size of the 
study population and calculated per 100,000 people (SEYLLp). Time trends were 
determined by joinpoint regression analysis.
RESULTS: In 1999, the SEYLLp value was 653.99 years among males and 71.20 years 
among females; in 2017, these numbers rose to 1,263.76 and 293.10 years, 
respectively. Time trend analysis revealed that SEYLLp increased more quickly in 
females (by 8.69 % per year) than in males (by 3.68 %). The ratio of male to 
female SEYLLp values decreased from 9.18 to 4.31 over the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: In Poland, both males and females are experiencing adverse changes 
in the number of alcohol-induced YLLs. However, the disparity in YLLs between 
males and females is gradually decreasing, primarily due to the value increasing 
more quickly in females.

AIMS: To estimate the burden and inequity of unintentional childhood injury for 
children in Aotearoa.
METHODS: We used administrative data from the Accident Compensation Corporation 
(ACC) and the Ministry of Health to estimate the direct, indirect and intangible 
costs of unintentional injuries in children aged under 15 and the inequity of 
the impact of childhood injury on discretionary household income. We used an 
incidence approach and attributed all costs arising from injuries to the year in 
which those injuries were sustained.
RESULTS: 257,000 children experienced unintentional injury in 2014, resulting in 
direct and indirect costs of almost $400 million. The burden of lost health and 
premature death was the equivalent of almost 200 full lives at perfect health. 
Pacific children had the highest incidence rates. Māori had the lowest rates of 
ACC claims but the highest rate of emergency department attendance. Children 
living with the highest levels of socioeconomic deprivation had the highest rate 
of hospital admission following injury. The proportional loss in discretionary 
income arising from an injury was higher for Māori and Pacific compared to 
non-Māori, non-Pacific households.
CONCLUSION: The burden of unintentional childhood injury is greater than 
previously reported and has a substantial and iniquitous societal impact. There 
should be a focus on addressing inequities in incidence and access to care in 
order to reduce inequities in health and financial impact.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Nowadays, with the rise in average life expectancy, the rate of 
hospitalization of the older population in intensive care unit (ICU) is 
gradually increasing. Unfortunately, there are no ideal combination of 
prognostic factors predicting the mortality in older patients admitted to the 
ICU. In the present study, we aim to determine the prognostic factors and their 
impacts on short-time mortality in older critically ill patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed between 
January 2019 and February 2020. We included 133 patients aged ≥80 years and 
hospitalized ≥24 h in the ICU.
RESULTS: A total of 133 critically ill patients enrolled in the present study. 
And, the median age of the patients was 85 (80–106) years. 30-days and overall 
ICU mortality rates were found 30.1% and 34.6%, respectively. The patients were 
grouped as survivors (n = 94) and nonsurvivors (n = 39). Hospital length of stay 
before the ICU admission was found significantly longer in nonsurvivors (p = 
0.001). Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and acute physiology 
and chronic health evaluation-II (APACHE-II) score were significantly higher in 
nonsurvivors (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). Also, blood lactate level and glucose level 
were respectively significantly higher in nonsurvivors (p < 0.001, p = 0.006). 
We found that modified nutrition risk in critically ill (mNUTRIC) score and 
prehospital clinical frailty scale (CFS) were independent prognostic factors for 
the older critically ill patients (HR = 9.19, 95% CI=1.47–57.32, p = 0.018, HR = 
20.16, 95% CI = 2.63–54.07, p =0.004).
CONCLUSION: mNUTRIC score and prehospital CFS score were the most important 
prognostic factors in the admission of older patients to intensive care units.

BACKGROUND: Early identification of people at elevated risk of type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) is an important step in preventing or delaying its onset. Pharmacies can 
serve as a significant channel to reach these people. This study aimed to assess 
the potential health economic impact of screening and recruitment services in 
pharmacies in referring people to preventive interventions.
METHODS: A decision analytic model was constructed to perform a cost-utility 
analysis of the expected national health economic consequences (in terms of 
costs and quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) of a hypothetical pharmacy-based 
service where people screened and recruited through pharmacies would participate 
in a digital lifestyle program. Cost-effectiveness was considered in terms of 
net monetary benefit (NMB). In addition, social return on investment (SROI) was 
calculated as the ratio of the intervention and recruitment costs and the net 
present value of expected savings. Payback time was the time taken to reach the 
break-even point in savings. In the base scenario, a 20-year time horizon was 
applied. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were applied to 
study robustness of the results.
RESULTS: In the base scenario, the expected savings from the pharmacy-based 
screening and recruitment among the reached target cohort were 255.3 m€ (95% CI 
- 185.2 m€ to 717.2 m€) in pharmacy visiting population meaning 1412€ (95% CI 
- 1024€ to 3967€) expected savings per person. Additionally, 7032 QALYs (95% CI 
- 1344 to 16,143) were gained on the population level. The intervention had an 
NMB of 3358€ (95% CI - 1397€ to 8431€) using a cost-effectiveness threshold of 
50,000 €/QALY. The initial costs were 122.2 m€ with an SROI of 2.09€ (95% CI 
- 1.52€ to 5.88€). The expected payback time was 10 and 8 years for women and 
men, respectively. Results were most sensitive for changes in effectiveness of 
the intervention and selected discount rate.
CONCLUSIONS: T2D screening and recruitment to prevention programs conducted via 
pharmacies was a dominant option providing both cost savings and QALY gains. The 
highest savings can be potentially reached by targeting recruitment at men at 
elevated risk of T2D.

BACKGROUND: A better representation of the burden of childhood asthma should 
rely on both morbidity and mortality and not only mortality. This will reduce 
the dearth of information on burden of childhood asthma, and enhance 
evidence-based decision-making. In this study, burden of childhood asthma was 
estimated, using disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs), factoring in the 
disability weights for asthma, age at mortality and life expectancy.
METHODS: The study was conducted at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, 
Enugu. An Interviewer Administered Questionnaire was used to collect information 
from parents of children with asthma who presented to respiratory clinics 
regarding level of their asthma control (controlled, partially controlled and 
poorly controlled asthma), their age distributions, and gender. The prevalence 
of asthma, prevalence of associated disability, and case-fatality were obtained 
from previous publications. The DALYs were estimated by adding together the 
years lost to disability (YLDs) and years lost to life (YLLs) to asthma 
(DALYs = YLD + YLL). DALYs were dis-aggregated by age group and by whether their 
asthma were controlled, partially controlled and poorly controlled.
RESULTS: A total of 66 children with asthma were studied. The proportion of the 
subjects with controlled, partially controlled and poorly controlled asthma were 
26 (39.4%), 31 (47%), and 9 (13.6%) respectively. The subjects that had some 
form of asthma-related disability were 16 (24.3%). Childhood asthma caused 
23.6-34.24 YLLs per 1000 population, 0.01-1.28 YLDs per 1000 population and 
24.23-34.41 DALY per 1000 population. There was minimal difference in DALYs 
across the three clinical categories, but this was consistently higher among 
older children 12-17 years. The estimated national DALYs was 407820.2, 
reflecting about of 1.6% of the global all age (children and adults) DALYs of 
24.8 million.
CONCLUSION: The DALYs due to childhood asthma were high and did not vary much 
across the clinical categories, but increased with age. This imperatively 
necessitates the de-emphasis on just clinical responses as an indicator of the 
efficiency of childhood asthma control interventions but rather a holistic 
approach should be adopted considering the limitations the child suffers as a 
component of both life and environmental modification in a deliberate attempt to 
prevent attacks. The ability of the child to function optimally while on 
treatment should be considered in the treatment impact review.

OBJECTIVES: Oncologists estimate patients' prognosis to guide care. Evidence 
suggests oncologists tend to overestimate life expectancy, which can lead to 
care with questionable benefits. Information obtained from geriatric assessment 
may improve prognostication for older adults. In this study, we created a 
geriatric assessment-based prognostic model for older adults with advanced 
cancer and compared its performance to alternative models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of a trial (URCC 13070; 
PI: Mohile) capturing geriatric assessment and vital status up to one year for 
adults age ≥ 70 years with advanced cancer. Oncologists estimated life 
expectancy as 0-6 months, 7-12 months, and > 1 year. Three statistical models 
were developed: (1) a model including age, sex, cancer type, and stage (basic 
model), (2) basic model + Karnofsky Performance Status (≤50, 60-70, and 80+) 
(KPS model), and (3) basic model +16 binary indicators of geriatric assessment 
impairments (GA model). Cox regression was used to model one-year survival; 
c-indices and time-dependent c-statistics assessed model discrimination and 
stratified survival curves assessed model calibration.
RESULTS: We included 484 participants; mean age was 75; 48% had gastrointestinal 
or lung cancer. Overall, 43% of patients died within one year. Oncologists 
classified prognosis accurately for 55% of patients, overestimated for 35%, and 
underestimated for 10%. C-indices were 0.61 (basic model), 0.62 (KPS model), and 
0.63 (GA model). The GA model was well-calibrated.
CONCLUSIONS: The GA model showed moderate discrimination for survival, similar 
to alternative models, but calibration was improved. Further research is needed 
to optimize geriatric assessment-based prognostic models for use in older adults 
with advanced cancer.

PURPOSE: To compare the cost and utility of scleral buckle (SB), pars plana 
vitrectomy (PPV), and PPV with SB (PPV/SB) for moderately complex rhegmatogenous 
retinal detachment repair.
METHODS: Cost-utility analysis using data from the Primary Retinal Detachment 
Outcomes Study. The model estimated costs, lifetime utility, and lifetime cost 
per quality-adjusted life year for treatment of moderately complex 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with SB, PPV, or PPV/SB. Data from the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services were used to calculate costs in hospital and 
ambulatory surgery center settings.
RESULTS: Total costs (2020 US dollars) for repair of a moderately complex 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in hospital (ambulatory surgery center) 
settings were $5,975 ($3,774) for the SB group, $8,125 ($5,082) for the PPV 
group, and $7,551 ($4,713) for the PPV/SB group. The estimated lifetime 
quality-adjusted life years gained were 5.4, 4.7, and 4.7 in the SB, PPV, and 
PPV/SB groups, respectively. The cost per quality-adjusted life year for 
hospital and ambulatory surgery center settings was $1,106 a ($699) for the SB 
group, $1729 ($1,081) for the PPV group, and $1,607 ($1,003) for the PPV/SB 
group.
CONCLUSION: Scleral buckle, PPV, and PPV/SB yielded very favorable cost-utility 
results for the repair of moderately complex rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, 
with slightly better results for SB, compared with current willingness to pay 
standards.

The objectives were to estimate disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and life 
expectancy with disability (DLE) by gender for the 100 French départements 
(administrative geographical subdivisions) and to investigate associations with 
socioeconomic factors, supply of healthcare and services for older persons. DFLE 
and DLE at age 60 are estimated using the Sullivan method and based on the GALI 
indicator provided by the French cross-sectional survey Vie Quotidienne et Santé 
2014. In 2014, DFLE for men and women aged 60 was 14.3 years and 15.6 years, 
respectively. Variations across départements were considerable (5.4 years for 
men, 6.7 years for women). Multivariate random effects meta-regression models 
indicated a negative association for men between DFLE and some of the 
socioeconomic contextual indicators (ratio of manual workers to higher-level 
occupations and unemployment rate); the level of in-home nursing services (HNS) 
was negatively associated with DFLE and density of nurses positively associated 
with DLE. Among women, ratio of manual workers to higher-level occupations, 
unemployment rate, proportion of the population living in large urban areas, 
density of nurses, and level of HNS were negatively associated with DFLE; 
density of physiotherapy supply was associated positively with DFLE and 
negatively with DLE. Our results suggest that geographical inequalities in 
health expectancies are significantly correlated with socioeconomic status and 
with healthcare supply, support for older persons, and urban environments, 
particularly among women. These results underline the importance of monitoring 
these indicators and disparities at infra-national-level, and of investigating 
their relations with local context, particularly the supply of healthcare and 
services.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological trends of type 2 diabetes mellitus attributable to 
fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution remain unclear. Here, we estimated 
spatiotemporal trends of type 2 diabetes mellitus burden attributable to PM2.5 
pollution, including ambient particulate matter pollution (APMP) and household 
air pollution (HAP), from 1990-2019.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 and 
were analyzed by age, sex, year, and location. Joinpoint regression analysis was 
applied in the analysis of temporal trends in type 2 diabetes mellitus burden 
over the 30 years.
RESULTS: Globally, PM2.5 pollution contributed to 292.5 thousand deaths and 13 
million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2019. APMP ranked third among 
all risk factors, causing an increase in type 2 diabetes mellitus burden from 
1990, whereas the impact of HAP significantly fell during the same period. Both 
APMP and HAP contributed the most to deaths and DALYs of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus among older people. However, the age-standardized death and DALY rates 
of type 2 diabetes mellitus attributable to APMP were greater among males and 
people in the middle socio-demographic index countries, especially in Southern 
Sub-Saharan Africa. For HAP, type 2 diabetes mellitus burden was modestly higher 
in females and was highest in Oceania, which was the only region with an 
increase from 1990.
CONCLUSIONS: PM2.5 pollution resulted in substantial and increasing type 2 
diabetes mellitus burden worldwide. Hence, governments and health systems should 
take steps to reduce air pollution to mitigate this increasing burden.

[Leadership, social determinants of health and health equity: the case of Costa 
Rica].

Costa Rica has long been a country of special interest in the Americas and in 
global health because of its good health. The United Nations Development 
Programme ranks countries according to their level of human development based on 
life expectancy, education and national income. Although Costa Rica is ranked at 
63 and classified as 'High', in terms of health it belongs in the 'Very High' 
group. In 2018 mean life expectancy for the 'Very High' countries was 79.5, 
while in Costa Rica it was 80. In 2018, under five mortality was 8.8/1000 live 
births, lower than countries ranked in the 'Very High' human development group. 
Expected years of schooling in Costa Rica is 15.4, closer to the average, 16.4 
years, of the 'Very High' human development group than the average of the 'High' 
group. The country is much healthier than would be predicted by its national 
income; rather, other features of society's development are likely to have 
played a key role in the development of good health. These include (i) the 
decision to cease investment in national defence, which freed up money to invest 
in health, education and the welfare of the population; (ii) the decision to 
create a universal health system financed by the State, employers and workers in 
the 1940s; and (iii) the educational system, that generated opportunities to 
lift important sectors of the population out of poverty, allowing them to have 
basic sanitary conditions that increase their possibilities to live longer and 
in better conditions. Despite these advances, inequalities in terms of income 
and social conditions persist, presenting challenges in the field of health, 
particularly for lower-income populations and those of African and indigenous 
descent. These inequalities must be addressed using decisions based on 
scientific evidence, a greater use of disaggregated data to reveal progress in 
addressing these inequalities, and with a broader articulation of the health 
sector with policies that act on the social determinants of health.

Costa Rica es un país de especial interés en la Región de las Américas y en la 
salud mundial debido a su buena salud. El Programa de las Naciones Unidas para 
el Desarrollo clasifica a los países según su nivel de desarrollo humano con 
base en la esperanza de vida, la educación y el ingreso nacional. Aunque Costa 
Rica está clasificada en el puesto 63 y dentro del grupo “alto”, en términos de 
salud pertenece al grupo “muy alto”. En el 2018, la esperanza de vida media de 
los países del grupo “muy alto” era de 79,5 años, mientras que en Costa Rica era 
de 80. En el 2018, la mortalidad en menores de 5 años era de 8,8/1000 nacidos 
vivos, inferior a la de los países clasificados en el grupo de desarrollo humano 
“muy alto”. Los años de escolaridad previstos en Costa Rica ascienden a 15,4; 
más cercanos al promedio de 16,4 años del grupo de desarrollo humano “muy alto” 
que el promedio del grupo “alto”. El país es mucho más saludable de lo que 
podría predecirse por su ingreso nacional; más bien, es probable que otras 
características del desarrollo de la sociedad hayan desempeñado un papel 
fundamental en el desarrollo de la buena salud. Entre ellas figuran: a) la 
decisión de dejar de invertir en la defensa nacional, que liberó dinero para 
invertir en la salud, la educación y el bienestar de la población; b) la 
decisión de crear un sistema de salud universal financiado por el Estado, los 
empleadores y los trabajadores en el decenio de 1940; y c) el sistema educativo, 
que generó oportunidades para sacar de la pobreza a importantes sectores de la 
población, permitiéndoles disponer de condiciones sanitarias básicas que 
aumentan sus posibilidades de vivir más y mejor. A pesar de estos avances, 
persisten desigualdades en términos de ingresos y condiciones sociales, lo que 
plantea desafíos en el ámbito de la salud, en particular para los grupos de 
menores ingresos y los afrodescendientes e indígenas. Estas desigualdades deben 
abordarse mediante decisiones basadas en pruebas científicas, un mayor uso de 
datos desglosados que revelen los progresos realizados para hacer frente a esas 
desigualdades, y una mayor articulación del sector de la salud con las políticas 
que actúan sobre los determinantes sociales de la salud.

Enhanced Visualization Methods for First Transurethral Resection of Bladder 
Tumour in Suspected Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer: A Health Technology 
Assessment.

Ontario Health (Quality).

Collaborators: Sehatzadeh S, Higgins C, Tiggelaar S, Xie X, Wells D.

BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer begins in the innermost lining of the bladder wall 
and, on histological examination, is classified as one of two types: 
non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) or muscle-invasive bladder cancer. 
Transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) is the standard treatment for 
people with NMIBC, but the high rate of cancer recurrence after first TURBT is a 
challenge that physicians and patients face. Tumours seen during follow-up may 
have been missed or incompletely resected during first TURBT. TURBT is 
conventionally performed using white light to see the tumours. However, small 
papillary or flat tumours may be missed with the use of white light alone. With 
the emergence of new technologies to improve visualization during TURBT, better 
diagnostic and patient outcomes may be expected. We conducted a health 
technology assessment of two enhanced visualization methods, both as an adjunct 
to white light to guide first TURBT for people with suspected 
NMIBC-hexaminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL), a solution that is instilled into 
the bladder to make tumours fluoresce under blue-violet light, and narrow band 
imaging (NBI), a technology that filters light into wavelengths that can be 
absorbed by hemoglobin in the tumours, making them appear darker. Our assessment 
included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, and the 
budget impact of publicly funding these new technologies to improve patient 
outcomes following first TURBT. The use of NBI in diagnostic cystoscopy was out 
of scope for this health technology assessment.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence 
from inception to April 15, 2020. We searched for randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) that compared the outcomes of first TURBT with the use of HAL or NBI, 
both as an adjunct to white light, with the outcomes of first TURBT using white 
light alone, or studies that made such comparison between HAL and NBI. We 
conducted pairwise meta-analyses using a fixed effects model where head-to-head 
comparisons were available. In the absence of any published RCT for comparison 
between HAL and NBI, we indirectly compared the two technologies through 
indirect treatment comparison (ITC) analysis. We assessed the risk of bias of 
each included study using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We assessed the 
quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We 
performed a systematic economic literature search and conducted a cost-utility 
analysis with a 15-year time horizon from a public payer perspective. We also 
analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding HAL and NBI as an adjunct to 
white light in people undergoing their first TURBT for suspected 
non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer in Ontario.
RESULTS: In the clinical evidence review, we identified 8 RCTs that used HAL or 
NBI as an adjunct to white light during first TURBT. Pairwise meta-analysis of 
HAL studies showed that HAL-guided TURBT as an adjunct to white light 
significantly reduces recurrence rate at 12 months compared with TURBT using 
white light alone (risk ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.95) 
(GRADE: Moderate). Five-year recurrence-free survival was significantly higher 
when HAL was used as an adjunct to white light than when white light was used 
alone (GRADE: Moderate). There was little to no difference in the tumour 
progression rate (GRADE: Moderate).Meta-analysis of NBI studies did not show a 
significant difference between NBI-guided TURBT as an adjunct to white light and 
TURBT using white light alone in reducing the rate of recurrence at 12 months 
(risk ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.75-1.19) (GRADE: Moderate). No evidence on the effect 
on recurrence-free survival or tumour progression rate was identified for 
NBI-guided TURBT. The indirect estimate from the network analysis showed a trend 
toward a lower rate of recurrence after HAL-guided TURBT than after NBI-guided 
TURBT but the difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio 0.76, 95% 
CI 0.51-1.11) (GRADE: Low). Studies showed that use of HAL or NBI during TURBT 
was generally safe.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of HAL-guided TURBT 
compared with NBI-guided TURBT, both as an adjunct to white light, is $12,618 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Compared with TURBT using white 
light alone and using adjunct NBI, the probability of HAL-guided TURBT being 
cost-effective is 69.1% at a willingness-to-pay value of $50,000 per QALY gained 
and 74.6% at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per QALY gained. The annual budget 
impact of publicly funding HAL-guided TURBT in Ontario over the next 5 years 
ranges from an additional $0.6 million in year 1 to $2.5 million in year 5.
CONCLUSIONS: First TURBT guided by HAL as an adjunct to white light likely 
reduces the rate of recurrence at 12 months and increases 5-year recurrence-free 
survival when compared with first TURBT using white light alone. There is likely 
little to no difference in the tumour progression rate. First TURBT guided by 
NBI as an adjunct to white light likely results in little to no difference in 
the rate of recurrence at 12 months when compared with first TURBT using white 
light alone. Based on an indirect comparison, there may be little to no 
difference in cancer recurrence rate between HAL-guided and NBI-guided first 
TURBT. Use of HAL or NBI during first TURBT is generally safe. For people 
undergoing their first TURBT for suspected non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, 
using HAL as an adjunct to white light is likely to be cost-effective compared 
with using white light alone or with using NBI as an adjunct to white light. We 
estimate that publicly funding HAL as an adjunct to white light to guide first 
TURBT for people in Ontario with suspected NMIBC would result in additional 
costs of between $0.6 million and $2.5 million per year over the next 5 years.

Multi-gene Pharmacogenomic Testing That Includes Decision-Support Tools to Guide 
Medication Selection for Major Depression: A Health Technology Assessment.

Ontario Health (Quality).

Collaborators: Jokic M, Vandersluis S, Higgins C, Gajic-Veljanoski O, Xie X, 
Akhund A.

BACKGROUND: Major depression is a substantial public health concern that can 
affect personal relationships, reduce people's ability to go to school or work, 
and lead to social isolation. Multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing that includes 
decision-support tools can help predict which depression medications and dosages 
are most likely to result in a strong response to treatment or to have the 
lowest risk of adverse events on the basis of people's genes.We conducted a 
health technology assessment of multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing that includes 
decision-support tools for people with major depression. Our assessment 
evaluated effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of 
publicly funding multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing, and patient preferences and 
values.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. 
We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane Risk of 
Bias Tool and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized studies 
(RoBANS) and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group 
criteria.We performed a systematic literature search of the economic evidence to 
review published cost-effectiveness studies on multi-gene pharmacogenomic 
testing that includes a decision-support tool in people with major depression. 
We developed a state-transition model and conducted a probabilistic analysis to 
determine the incremental cost of multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing versus 
treatment as usual per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for people with 
major depression who had inadequate response to one or more antidepressant 
medications. In the reference case (with GeneSight-guided care), we considered a 
1-year time horizon with an Ontario Ministry of Health perspective. We also 
estimated the 5-year budget impact of publicly funding multi-gene 
pharmacogenomic testing for people with major depression in Ontario.To 
contextualize the potential value of multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing that 
includes decision-support tools, we spoke with people who have major depression 
and their families.
RESULTS: We included 14 studies in the clinical evidence review that evaluated 
six multi-gene pharmacogenomic tests. Although all tests included 
decision-support tools, they otherwise differed greatly, as did study design, 
populations included in studies, and outcomes reported. Little or no improvement 
was observed on change in HAM-D17 depression score compared with treatment as 
usual for any test evaluated (GRADE: Low-Very Low). GeneSight- and 
NeuroIDgenetix-guided medication selection led to statistically significant 
improvements in response (GRADE: Low-Very Low) and remission (GRADE: Low-Very 
Low), while treatment guided by CNSdose led to significant improvement in 
remission rates (GRADE: Low), but the study did not report on response. Results 
were inconsistent and uncertain for the impact of Neuropharmagen, and no 
significant improvement was observed for Genecept or another unspecified test 
for either response or remission (GRADE: Low-Very Low). Neuropharmagen may 
reduce adverse events and CNSDose may reduce intolerability to medication, while 
no difference was observed in adverse events with GeneSight, Genecept, or 
another unspecified test (GRADE: Moderate-Very Low). No studies reported data on 
suicide, treatment adherence, relapse, recovery, or recurrence of depression 
symptoms.Our review included four model-based economic studies and found that 
multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing was associated with greater effectiveness and 
cost savings than treatment as usual, over long-term (i.e., 3-,5-year and 
lifetime) time horizons. Since none of the included studies was fully applicable 
to the Ontario health care system, we conducted a primary economic 
evaluation.Our reference case analysis over the 1-year time horizon found that 
multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing (with GeneSight) was associated with 
additional QALYs (0.03, 95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.005; 0.072) and 
additional costs ($1,906, 95% Crl: $688; $3,360). An incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio was $60,564 per QALY gained. The probability of the 
intervention being cost-effective (vs. treatment as usual) was 36.8% at a 
willingness-to-pay amount of $50,000 per QALY (i.e., moderately likely not to be 
cost-effective), rising to 70.7% at a willingness-to-pay amount of $100,000 per 
QALY (i.e., moderately likely to be cost-effective). Evidence informing economic 
modeling of the reference case with GeneSight and other multi-gene 
pharmacogenomic tests was of low to very low quality, implying considerable 
uncertainty or low confidence in the effectiveness estimates. The price of the 
test, efficacy of the intervention on remission, time horizon, and analytic 
perspective were major determinants of the cost-effectiveness results. If the 
test price were assumed to be $2,162 (compared with $2,500 in the reference 
case), the intervention would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay amount 
of $50,000 per QALY; moreover, if the price decreased to $595, the intervention 
would be cost saving (or dominant) compared with treatment as usual.At an 
increasing uptake of 1% per year and a test price of $2,500, the annual budget 
impact of publicly funding multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing in Ontario over 
the next 5 years ranged from an additional $3.5 million in year 1 (at uptake of 
1%) to $16.8 million in year 5. The 5-year budget impact was estimated at about 
$52 million.People with major depression and caregivers generally supported 
multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing because they believed it could provide 
guidance that fit their values. They hoped such guidance would speed symptom 
relief, would reduce side effects and help inform their medication choices. Some 
patients expressed concerns over maintaining confidentiality of test results and 
the possibility that physicians would sacrifice patient-centred care to follow 
pharmacogenomic guidance.
CONCLUSIONS: Multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing that includes decision-support 
tools to guide medication selection for depression varies widely. Differences 
between individual tests must be considered, as clinical utility observed with 
one test might not apply to other tests. Overall, effectiveness was inconsistent 
among the six multi-gene pharmacogenomic tests we identified. Multi-gene 
pharmacogenomic tests may result in little or no difference in improvement in 
depression scores compared with treatment as usual, but some tests may improve 
response to treatment or remission from depression. The impact on adverse events 
is uncertain. The evidence, however, is uncertain, and therefore our confidence 
that these observed effects reflect the true effects is low to very low.For the 
management of major depression in people who had inadequate response to at least 
one medication, some multi-gene pharmacogenomic tests that include decision 
support tools are associated with additional costs and QALYs over the 1-year 
time horizon, and maybe be cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay amount of 
$100,000 per QALY. Publicly funding multi-gene pharmacogenomic testing in 
Ontario would result in additional annual costs of between $3.5 million and 
$16.8 million, with a total budget impact of about $52 million over the next 5 
years.People with major depression and caregivers generally supported multi-gene 
pharmacogenomic testing because they believed it could provide guidance that fit 
their values. They hoped such guidance would speed symptom relief, would reduce 
side and help inform their medication choices. Some patients expressed concerns 
over maintaining confidentiality of test results and the possibility that 
physicians would sacrifice patient-centred care to follow pharmacogenomic 
guidance.

Mexico is one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 disease. Although 
there is vast information on the disease, there still are unknown data on the 
societal and economic cost of the pandemic. To estimate this impact, the 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) can be a useful tool. Objective: To 
assess the DALYs due to COVID-19 in Mexico. Methods: We used the data released 
by the Mexican Ministry of Health to estimate the DALYs by the sum of the years 
of life lived with disability (YLDs) and the years of life lost (YLLs). Results: 
A total of 1,152,885 confirmed cases and 324,570 suspected cases of COVID-19 
have been registered. Half of the cases were men, with a median age of 43.4 ± 
16.9 years. About 8.3% died. A total of 39,202 YLDs were attributable to 
COVID-19. The total YLLs caused by COVID-19 were 2,126,222. A total of
