times (p=0.037) higher than patients with a different immunophenotype (HR: 2.77. 
95%CI: 1.10-6.99). The degree of intermediate SBR increases the risk of dying in 
patients with metastasis (HR 2.76, 95% CI: 1.17-6.51).
CONCLUSIONS: CNS metastasis continues to be a poor prognostic factor that 
reduces survival and affects quality of life. It is recommended to monitor the 
early presence of clinical neurological manifestations during follow-up for 
prompt treatment. TN patients have worse prognosis and HER2+ a better control.

Publisher: OBJETIVO: Evaluar los factores pronósticos (características 
clínico-patológicas y tratamientos) en las pacientes con cáncer de mama y 
metástasis al sistema nervioso central (SNC) como primer sitio de afección.
MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: Cohorte retrospectiva, formada por 125 pacientes con cáncer 
de mama atendidas en el Instituto Nacional de Cancerología durante 2007-2015, 
quienes presentaron afección en el SNC como primer sitio de metástasis. A través 
del método Kaplan-Meier y tablas de vida se estimó la supervivencia global. El 
modelo de riesgos proporcionales de Cox fue utilizado para determinar los 
factores pronósticos.
RESULTADOS: La mediana de supervivencia global fue de 14.2 meses (IC95% 
11.8-26.9). Pacientes clasificadas por inmunohistoquímica como triple negativo 
(TN) presentaron tiempos de supervivencia más cortos (p<0.004) y con dos veces 
más riesgo de fallecer, en comparación con los otros inmunofenotipos (HR= 2.77; 
IC95% 1.10-6.99); asimismo, se identificó que un grado intermedio en la escala 
Scarff-Bloom-Richardson incrementa el riesgo de morir en pacientes con 
metástasis (HR=2.76; IC95% 1.17-6.51).
CONCLUSIONES: La metástasis al SNC continúa siendo un factor de mal pronóstico 
que reduce la supervivencia y afecta la calidad de vida. Se recomienda vigilar 
puntualmente la presencia de manifestaciones clínicas neurológicas durante el 
seguimiento, para una rápida intervención. Las pacientes TN tienen peor 
pronóstico, y las HER2+ (es decir, con resultado positivo para el receptor 2 del 
factor de crecimiento humano epidérmico), mejor control a mediano plazo.

BACKGROUND: Many of the elderly in nursing homes are very ill and have a reduced 
quality of life. Life expectancy is often hard to predict. Decisions about 
life-prolonging treatment should be based on a professional assessment of the 
patient's best interest, assessment of capacity to consent, and on the patient's 
own wishes. The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare how these 
types of decisions were made in nursing homes and in hospital wards.
METHODS: Using a questionnaire, we studied the decision-making process for 299 
nursing home patients who were treated for dehydration using intravenous fluids, 
or for bacterial infections using intravenous antibiotics. We compared the 215 
(72%) patients treated in nursing homes to the 84 (28%) nursing home patients 
treated in the hospital.
RESULTS: The patients' capacity to consent was considered prior to treatment in 
197 (92%) of the patients treated in nursing homes and 56 (67%) of the patients 
treated in hospitals (p < 0.001). The answers indicate that capacity to consent 
can be difficult to assess. Patients that were considered capable to consent, 
were more often involved in the decision-making in nursing homes than in 
hospital (90% vs. 52%). Next of kin and other health personnel were also more 
rarely involved when the nursing home patient was treated in hospital. Whether 
advance care planning had been carried out, was more often unknown in the 
hospital (69% vs. 17% in nursing homes). Hospital doctors expressed more doubt 
about the decision to admit the patient to the hospital than about the treatment 
itself.
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates a potential for improvement in decision-making 
processes in general, and in particular when nursing home patients are treated 
in a hospital ward. The findings corroborate that nursing home patients should 
be treated locally if adequate health care and treatment is available. The 
communication between the different levels of health care when hospitalization 
is necessary, must be better.

BACKGROUND: All organisms employ biological clocks to anticipate physical 
changes in the environment; however, the integration of biological clocks in 
symbiotic systems has received limited attention. In corals, the interpretation 
of rhythmic behaviours is complicated by the daily oscillations in tissue oxygen 
tension resulting from the photosynthetic and respiratory activities of the 
associated algal endosymbiont Symbiodinium. In order to better understand the 
integration of biological clocks in cnidarian hosts of Symbiodinium, daily 
rhythms of behaviour and gene expression were studied in symbiotic and 
aposymbiotic morphs of the sea-anemone Aiptasia diaphana.
RESULTS: The results showed that whereas circatidal (approx. 12-h) cycles of 
activity and gene expression predominated in aposymbiotic morphs, circadian 
(approx. 24-h) patterns were the more common in symbiotic morphs, where the 
expression of a significant number of genes shifted from a 12- to 24-h rhythm. 
The behavioural experiments on symbiotic A. diaphana displayed diel (24-h) 
rhythmicity in body and tentacle contraction under the light/dark cycles, 
whereas aposymbiotic morphs showed approximately 12-h (circatidal) rhythmicity. 
Reinfection experiments represent an important step in understanding the 
hierarchy of endogenous clocks in symbiotic associations, where the aposymbiotic 
Aiptasia morphs returned to a 24-h behavioural rhythm after repopulation with 
algae.
CONCLUSION: Whilst some modification of host metabolism is to be expected, the 
extent to which the presence of the algae modified host endogenous behavioural 
and transcriptional rhythms implies that it is the symbionts that influence the 
pace. Our results clearly demonstrate the importance of the endosymbiotic algae 
in determining the timing and the duration of the extension and contraction of 
the body and tentacles and temporal gene expression.

BACKGROUND: TAS-102 is indicated for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC) previously treated with, or not considered candidates for, available 
therapies. Given the complete inefficacy in half of patients, the lack of 
predictive factors, the palliative setting, and the financial and clinical 
toxicity, optimizing the cost-benefit ratio is crucial. The "ColonLife" nomogram 
allows an estimate of the 12-week life expectancy of patients with refractory 
mCRC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected data from patients treated at eight Italian 
centers in the compassionate use program. Baseline characteristics of patients 
who were or were not progression free at 6 months were compared. The 
discriminative ability of the ColonLife nomogram was assessed. Among patients 
who received both TAS-102 and regorafenib, clinical outcomes of the two 
sequences were compared.
RESULTS: This study included 341 patients. Six (2%) and 93 (27%) patients 
achieved response and disease stabilization, respectively. The median 
progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.4 months with an estimated 6-month PFS 
rate of 19%; the median overall survival (OS) was 6.2 months. An Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0, normal lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), and a time from the diagnosis of metastatic disease of >18 
months were independently associated with higher chances of a patient being 
progression free at 6 months. The discriminative ability of ColonLife was 
confirmed. Among 121 patients who received both regorafenib and TAS-102, no 
differences in first or second PFS or OS were reported between the two 
sequences.
CONCLUSION: One out of five patients achieves clinical benefit with TAS-102. 
ECOG PS, LDH, and time from diagnosis of metastatic disease may help to identify 
these patients. Excluding patients with very short life expectancy appears a 
reasonable approach.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Improving the cost-efficacy ratio of TAS-102 in 
metastatic colorectal cancer is needed to spare useless toxicities in a 
definitely palliative setting. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 
status, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and time from the diagnosis of metastatic 
disease may help to identify patients more likely to achieve benefit. Properly 
designed prognostic tools (i.e., the "ColonLife" nomogram) may enable excluding 
from further treatments patients with very limited life expectancy.

摘要 背景。TAS‐102 
适用于先前接受过现有疗法治疗或者被认定无法接受现有疗法治疗的转移性结直肠癌(mCRC)患者。由于对半数患者完全无效,缺乏预测因素,采取姑息治疗以及经济因素和临床毒性因素,因此,优化成本效益比显得至关重要。“ColonLife”列线图可以估算出难治性mCRC患者的预期寿命为 
12 周。 材料和方法。我们收集了在8家参与同情使用计划的意大利中心接受治疗的患者的数据,并在 6 
个月时对病情有进展与病情无进展的患者的基本特征进行了比较。我们还对 ColonLife 列线图的鉴别能力进行了评估。在同时服用 TAS‐102 
和瑞格非尼的患者中,我们对两种服药顺序的临床效果进行了比较。 
结果。本研究入组341名患者。其中分别有6名患者(2%)和93名患者(27%)的病情缓解及疾病稳定。中位无进展生存期(PFS)为2.4个月,估算的6个月PFS率为19%;中位总生存期(OS)为6.2个月。东部肿瘤协作组体能状态(ECOG 
PS)评分为0,乳酸脱氢酶(LDH)正常,诊断转移的时间超过18个月,均与患者在6个月时无疾病进展独立相关。ColonLife的鉴别能力得到了证实。在服用瑞格非尼和TAS‐102的121名患者中,未收到两种服药顺序在PFS或OS存在差异的报告。 
结论。五分之一的患者在服用TAS‐102后得到临床受益。ECOG PS、LDH和诊断转移的时间可帮助确定这些患者。排除预期寿命很短的患者似乎是一种合理的方法。 
实践意义 
需要提高TAS‐102在治疗转移性结直肠癌过程中的成本疗效比率,进而消除其在明确姑息治疗环境中的无用毒性。东部肿瘤协作组体能状态评分、乳酸脱氢酶水平以及诊断转移的时间可帮助确定更有可能获得疗效的患者。设计合理的预后工具(如“ColonLife”列线图)可排除预期寿命非常有限的患者去接受进一步的治疗。

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Once a patient with atrial fibrillation experiences an 
embolic event, the risk of a recurrent event increases 2.6-fold. New treatments 
have emerged as viable treatment alternatives to warfarin for stroke risk 
reduction in secondary prevention populations. This analysis sought to assess 
the cost-effectiveness of left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) compared with 
warfarin and the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants dabigatran 150 mg, 
apixaban and rivaroxaban in the prevention of stroke in nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation patients with a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack.
METHODS: A Markov model was constructed using data from the secondary prevention 
subgroup analyses of the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant and LAAC 
pivotal trials. Costs were from 2016 US Medicare reimbursement rates and the 
literature. The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a US Medicare 
perspective over a lifetime (20 years) horizon. The model was populated with a 
cohort of 10 000 patients aged 70 years with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 7 (annual 
stroke risk=9.60%) and HAS-BLED score of 3 (annual bleeding risk=3.74%).
RESULTS: LAAC achieved cost-effectiveness relative to dabigatran at year 5 and 
warfarin and apixaban at year 6. At 10 years, LAAC had more quality-adjusted 
life years (4.986 versus 4.769, 4.869, 4.888, and 4.810) and lower costs 
($42 616 versus $53 770, $58 774, $55 656, and $58 655) than warfarin, 
dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban, respectively, making LAAC the dominant 
(more effective and less costly) stroke risk reduction strategy. LAAC remained 
the dominant strategy over the lifetime analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Upfront procedure costs initially make LAAC higher cost than 
warfarin and the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, but within 10 
years, LAAC delivers more quality-adjusted life years and has lower total costs, 
making LAAC the most cost-effective treatment strategy for secondary prevention 
of stroke in atrial fibrillation.

BACKGROUND: In 2005, the Israeli parliament passed the "law of dying patients" 
legalizing life and death decisions (do not resuscitate) in patients with life 
expectancy less than 6 months.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ethnic and religious backgrounds (both religion 
and religiosity) influence neonatologists' attitudes in simulated clinical 
situations and opinions about the new law.
DESIGN/METHODS: Prospective design, using standard questionnaire sent to all 155 
board-certified practising Israeli Neonatologists. The questionnaire sought 
demographic and descriptive data, personal opinions regarding four simulated 
cases, and opinions about five statements regarding variables that may influence 
decision-making. Statistical analyses were by stepwise backward regression 
analysis, linear regression, and Kruskal-Wallis tests, wherever indicated.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent of the neonatologists replied, representing 27 NICUs 
out of the 29 NICUs in Israel. Most neonatologists would respect the wish of the 
family as long as it would be within the limits of the law or their personal 
beliefs. In stepwise regression analysis, religion, religiosity, age, gender, 
experience, or country of training did not influence significantly the 
neonatologists' opinions or their decisions in simulated practice. Most 
neonatologists felt that Ethical Committees had no role in NICUs and were seldom 
consulted. Most felt that likelihood of severe handicap was critical in 
decision-making. Issues related to treatment cost of a handicapped or dying 
infant, as well as impact of a handicapped infant on family's well-being, were 
not deemed critical.
CONCLUSION: Israeli neonatologists appear to be a relatively homogeneous group 
in end-of-life decisions, regardless of their ethnic, religious, or religiosity 
background.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have compared the cost effectiveness of non-vitamin 
K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin using results from 
clinical trials evaluating NOACs. However, the time in therapeutic range (TTR) 
of warfarin groups ranged across clinical trials, and all were below the 
therapeutic goal of 70%. We compared the cost effectiveness of edoxaban 60 mg, 
apixaban 5 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, dabigatran 110 mg, rivaroxaban 20 mg, and 
well-managed warfarin with a TTR of 70% in preventing stroke among patients with 
atrial fibrillation at high risk of bleeding.
METHODS: For the six treatments, we used a Markov state-transition model to 
quantify lifetime costs in $US and effectiveness in quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). We simulated relative risk ratios of clinical events with each NOAC 
versus warfarin with a TTR of 70% using published regression models that predict 
how the incidence of thrombotic or hemorrhagic events changes for each unit 
change in TTR. We re-ran our analysis for two other estimates of TTR: 65 and 
75%.
RESULTS: Treatment with edoxaban 60 mg cost $US127,520/QALY gained compared with 
warfarin with a TTR of 70% and cost $US41,860/QALY gained compared with warfarin 
with a TTR of 65%. However, warfarin with a TTR of 75% was more effective and 
less expensive than all NOACs. For three levels of TTR, apixaban 5 mg, 
dabigatran 150 mg, dabigatran 110 mg, and rivaroxaban 20 mg were dominated 
strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: The comparative cost effectiveness of edoxaban and warfarin is 
highly sensitive to TTR. At the $US100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, 
our results suggest that warfarin is the most cost-effective treatment for 
patients who can achieve a TTR of 70%.

BACKGROUND: Behavioral economics interventions have been shown to effectively 
reduce the rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory 
infections (ARIs).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of three behavioral economic 
interventions designed to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for 
ARIs.
DESIGN: Thirty-year Markov model from the US societal perspective with inputs 
derived from the literature and CDC surveillance data.
SUBJECTS: Forty-five-year-old adults with signs and symptoms of ARI presenting 
to a healthcare provider.
INTERVENTIONS: (1) Provider education on guidelines for the appropriate 
treatment of ARIs; (2) Suggested Alternatives, which utilizes computerized 
clinical decision support to suggest non-antibiotic treatment choices in lieu of 
antibiotics; (3) Accountable Justification, which mandates free-text 
justification into the patient's electronic health record when antibiotics are 
prescribed; and (4) Peer Comparison, which sends a periodic email to prescribers 
about his/her rate of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing relative to clinician 
colleagues.
MAIN MEASURES: Discounted costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
KEY RESULTS: Each intervention has lower costs but higher QALYs compared to 
provider education. Total costs for each intervention were $178.21, $173.22, 
$172.82, and $172.52, and total QALYs were 14.68, 14.73, 14.74, and 14.74 for 
the control, Suggested Alternatives, Accountable Justification, and Peer 
Comparison groups, respectively. Results were most sensitive to the 
quality-of-life of the uninfected state, and the likelihood and costs for 
antibiotic-associated adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral economics interventions can be cost-effective strategies 
for reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions by reducing healthcare 
resource utilization.

non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) treated with standard chemotherapy will have 
long-term life expectancy comparable to those in the age-adjusted general 
population. This systematic literature review summarizes current literature 
regarding health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of long-term (≥2 years) 
survivors of aggressive NHL.
METHODS: Electronic databases (without restriction on years) and abstracts from 
four major oncology and HRQoL conferences from 2014 to 2017 were searched. 
Studies were included if HRQoL or health utility was assessed at least 2 years 
after NHL diagnosis. Studies focusing on central nervous system lymphoma, or 
indolent NHL, were excluded. Results were categorized relative to baseline 
(improvement, deterioration or no change) and compared to the general population 
(better, comparable or worse).
RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Twelve studies included ≥1 
HRQoL instrument, and two measured health utilities using EQ-5D. Half of the 
studies showed improvement (5/10) and half no change (5/10) in overall HRQoL. 
Compared to the general population, overall HRQoL was more comparable when 
assessed at ≥3 years from baseline (3/3 better or comparable) versus assessment 
at <3 years (2/3 better or comparable). Six studies reported on the physical 
HRQoL domain with improvement in 4/6 studies and no change in 2/6 studies.
CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL of NHL survivors may improve from baseline and becomes more 
comparable to general population HRQoL with longer survival. Overall HRQoL 
improvement is driven mostly by improvements in the physical domain.

AIMS: The goal of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of mechanical 
thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) from an Australian payer 
perspective.
METHODS: This study used a Markov model that employed a life-time time horizon, 
modeling patients from symptom onset of stroke until end of life. Clinical 
efficacy and safety data were taken from an individual patient level data (IPD) 
meta-analysis of clinical studies. The treatment effect of MT compared to usual 
care was measured by changes in modified Rankin Score (mRS). Post-treatment mRS 
scores were used to determine short- and long-term stroke care costs. Treatment 
costs were modeled, with health state utility values determined by literature 
review. All analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel.
RESULTS: In comparison to usual care, MT is associated with higher costs 
($10,666 per patient) and additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.8281 
per patient), resulting in an incremental cost per QALY of $12,880. Sensitivity 
analyses demonstrated the reliability of the base case results across a range of 
assumptions. The higher cost associated with MT is, to an extent, offset by the 
cost savings resulting from lower stroke care costs due to improved patient 
outcomes. The life-time cost savings in terms of stroke care costs are estimated 
to be more than $8,000 per patient for patients who had received MT in 
combination with usual care.
LIMITATIONS: Stroke care costs based on patient disability/functional level were 
not available and were derived. As a consequence, long-term care costs for 
patients with poorer outcomes may be under-estimated. Patient outcomes at 90 
days were extrapolated to a lifetime horizon, but this approach was supported by 
long-term evidence on stroke survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy is a cost-effective treatment option for 
AIS, with clinical benefits translating to short- and long-term cost benefits. 
This analysis supports rapid update of stroke care pathways to incorporate this 
therapy as a treatment option.

Both Hemibarbus labeo and H. medius (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae: Gobioninae) are 
primary freshwater fishes and are widely distributed. As such, they provide an 
ideal model for phylogeographical studies. However, the similarity in 
morphological characters between these two species made the description of their 
distributions and the validation of species quite challenging. Here we employed 
variations in the DNA sequences of mitochondrial COI and ND5 genes (2151 bp) to 
solve this challenge and to study the population genetics structure of these two 
species. Among the 130 specimens belonging to 8 populations of H. labeo and 9 
populations of H. medius from 17 drainage systems in southern China,196 variable 
sites (9.1% in the full sequences) falling into 50 haplotypes were identified. 
The haplotype diversity (h) and the nucleotide diversity (π) were 0.964 and 
0.019, respectively, indicating a high level of genetic diversity and an 
evolutionary potential in both species. The result of neighbor-joining tree 
based on composite nucleotide sequences of the mtDNA COI and ND5 genes showed 
that the H. labeo and H. medius fell into two major clades (clade1and clade2): 
clade1was composed of some specimens of Oujiang River, all the specimens of 
Hanjiang River and Jiulongjiang River, whereas all remaining populations fell in 
clade2. The genetic distance between clade I and clade II was 0.036, while that 
between H. labeo and H. medius was 0.027. The haplotype network analyses 
indicated that the populations of Hanjiang River and Jiulongjiang River had 
relatively high genetic variation with the rest rivers. The po-pulations of 
Hainan Island migrated northward to Moyangjaing River. Haplotypes of the rivers 
of Hainan Island and Moyangjang River had relatively higher genetic variation 
with the Yangtze River than Pearl River. The populations of Xiangjiang River had 
no genetic variation with the populations of Guijiang River and Liujiang River. 
Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that the genetic variance 
mainly presented in individuals between geographical regions. The genetic 
variation of populations among regions was 71.2%, the genetic variation among 
populations within regions was 16.6%, and that within populations within the 
regions was 12.2%, indicating that most of the genetic variations resided in the 
populations among regions. The results of mismatch distribution and tests of 
neutrality suggested that in all populations, H. labeo, H. medius, clade1and 
clade2 were relatively stable.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis. To date, there has been 
little research devoted to decision-making regarding treatment options in 
pancreatic cancer, including the rationale for choosing to withhold tumor 
targeting treatment (TTT). This study aims to gain insight into the 
characteristics of patients receiving no TTT, the reasons for this decision and 
their survival.
METHODS: All patients diagnosed in the Netherlands between 1 January 2014 and 30 
June 2015 with a proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma or a pathologically unverified 
pancreatic tumor were identified in the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Information 
on initial management, patient characteristics, main reasons for no TTT (as 
reported in medical charts) and survival were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 3090 patients was included. Of these patients, 1818 (59%) 
received no TTT. Median age of no TTT patients was 74 years (range 35-99) versus 
66 years (30-87) for TTT patients. In the no TTT group 77% had a clinical stage 
III/IV versus 57% of patients who received TTT. Main reasons for not starting 
TTT were patient's choice (27%) and extensive disease (21%). Median survival of 
patients who did not receive TTT was 1.9 months, ranging from a median survival 
of 0.8 months (when main reason to withhold TTT was short life expectancy) to 
4.4 months (main reason to withhold TTT: old age). In the latter group, a 
relatively large proportion of clinical stage I tumors was present (37%).
CONCLUSION: The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer received no TTT and 
had a very poor median survival. In most patients, patient's choice not to start 
treatment was the main reason for withholding treatment, suggesting patient's 
involvement in decision-making.

Background Physical fitness is impaired after stroke, yet fitness training after 
stroke reduces disability. Several international guidelines recommend that 
fitness training be incorporated as part of stroke rehabilitation. However, 
information about cost-effectiveness is limited. Methods A decision tree model 
was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a fitness programme for stroke 
survivors vs. relaxation (control group). This was based on a published 
randomised controlled trial, from which evidence about quality of life was used 
to estimate Quality Adjusted Life Years. Costs were based on the cost of the 
provision of group fitness classes within local community centres and a cost per 
Quality Adjusted Life Year was calculated. Results The results of the base case 
analysis found an incremental cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year of £2,343. 
Conclusions Physical fitness sessions after stroke are a cost-effective 
intervention for stroke survivors. This information will help make the case for 
the development of new services.

BACKGROUND: The article examines gender differences in happy life expectancy at 
age 50 (LE50) and computes the age-specific contributions of mortality and 
happiness effects to gender differences in happy LE50 in 16 European countries.
METHODS: Abridged life tables and happy LE50 were calculated using conventional 
life tables and Sullivan's method. Age-specific death rates were calculated from 
deaths and population exposures in the Human Mortality Database. Happiness 
prevalence was estimated using the 2010-11 Survey of Health, Ageing and 
Retirement in Europe. Happiness was defined using a single question about life 
satisfaction on a scale of 0-10. A decomposition algorithm was applied to 
estimate the exact contributions of the differences in mortality and happiness 
to the overall gender gap in happy LE50.
RESULTS: Gender differences in happy LE50 favour women in all countries except 
Portugal (0.43 years in Italy and 3.55 years in Slovenia). Generally, the 
contribution of the gender gap in happiness prevalence is smaller than the one 
in mortality. The male advantage in the prevalence of happiness partially 
offsets the effects of the female advantage in mortality on the total gender gap 
in happy LE50. Gender differences in unhappy life years make up the greatest 
share of the gender gap in total LE50 in all countries except Denmark, Germany, 
Netherlands, Slovenia and Sweden.
CONCLUSION: Countries with the largest gender gap in LE are not necessarily the 
countries with larger differences in happy LE50. The remaining years of life of 
women are expected to be spent not only in unhealthy but also in unhappy state.

BACKGROUND: Data on long-term prognosis of metastatic GCT (mGCT) is scant. The 
frequency of spontaneous regressions (SRs) is unknown. We aimed to estimate the 
prognosis of mGCT.
METHODS: We searched electronic scientific literature databases and generic 
Internet from January 1980 to August 2017. After identifying eligible studies we 
performed descriptive analyses and meta-analyses to estimate overall survival 
(OS), disease specific survival (DSS) and frequency of SRs in the years before 
the widespread use of denosumab. We performed pre-specified subgroup analyses of 
studies published before and after 2000 and of those with more and less than 10 
years of follow-up.
RESULTS: After retrieving and combining data from 26 relevant retrospective 
case-series totaling 242 patients with a median follow-up of 6.9 years, the 
estimated pooled OS was 86.9% (95% CI 78.0-94.2). Pooled DSS was 88.0% (95% CI 
79.7-94.7). SRs were observed in 4.5% of patients. In the subgroup of studies 
published after 2000 mGCT was the only cause of death of affected subjects. In 
case-series with a follow-up longer than 10 years pooled DSS was 69.7% (95% CI 
25.5-99.8).
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first study to derive estimated pooled 
OS and DSS of mGCT based on a large dataset. SRs were not exceptional phenomena. 
In a long run the disease could impact in a significant way on the life 
expectancy of affected subjects.

The rapid rate of discoveries of exoplanets has expanded the scope of the 
science possible for the remote detection of life beyond Earth. The Exoplanet 
Biosignatures Workshop Without Walls (EBWWW) held in 2016 engaged the 
international scientific community across diverse scientific disciplines, to 
assess the state of the science and technology in the search for life on 
exoplanets, and to identify paths for progress. The workshop activities resulted 
in five major review papers, which provide (1) an encyclopedic review of known 
and proposed biosignatures and models used to ascertain them (Schwieterman et 
al., 2018 in this issue); (2) an in-depth review of O2 as a biosignature, 
rigorously examining the nuances of false positives and false negatives for 
evidence of life (Meadows et al., 2018 in this issue); (3) a Bayesian framework 
to comprehensively organize current understanding to quantify confidence in 
biosignature assessments (Catling et al., 2018 in this issue); (4) an extension 
of that Bayesian framework in anticipation of increasing planetary data and 
novel concepts of biosignatures (Walker et al., 2018 in this issue); and (5) a 
review of the upcoming telescope capabilities to characterize exoplanets and 
their environment (Fujii et al., 2018 in this issue). Because of the immense 
content of these review papers, this summary provides a guide to their 
complementary scope and highlights salient features. Strong themes that emerged 
from the workshop were that biosignatures must be interpreted in the context of 
their environment, and that frameworks must be developed to link diverse forms 
of scientific understanding of that context to quantify the likelihood that a 
biosignature has been observed. Models are needed to explore the parameter space 
where measurements will be widespread but sparse in detail. Given the 
technological prospects for large ground-based telescopes and space-based 
observatories, the detection of atmospheric signatures of a few potentially 
habitable planets may come before 2030. Key Words:

The desire of eternal youth seems to be as old as mankind. However, the 
increasing life expectancy experienced by populations in developed countries 
also involves a significantly increased incidence of the most common age-related 
diseases (ARDs). Senescent cells (SCs) have been identified as culprits of 
organismal aging. Their number rises with age and their senescence-associated 
secretory phenotype fuels the chronic, pro-inflammatory systemic state 
(inflammaging) that characterizes aging, impairing the regenerative ability of 
stem cells and increasing the risk of developing ARDs. A variegated class of 
molecules, including synthetic senolytic compounds and natural compounds 
contained in food, have been suggested to possess anti-senescence activity. 
Senolytics are attracting growing interest, and their safety and reliability as 
anti-senescence drugs are being assessed in human clinical trials. Notably, 
since SCs spread inflammation at the systemic level through pro-oxidant and 
pro-inflammatory signals, foods rich in polyphenols, which exert antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory actions, have the potential to be harnessed as 
"anti-senescence foods" in a nutraceutical approach to healthier aging. We 
discuss the beneficial effects of polyphenol-rich foods in relation to the 
Mediterranean diet and the dietary habits of long-lived individuals, and examine 
their ability to modulate bacterial genera in the gut.

Cytoreductive surgery is an important column in the treatment of primary ovarian 
cancer. Surgical outcome is one of the most important prognostic factors and one 
of the few prognostic variables that can be influenced by therapists. 
Retrospective studies suggested that only complete cytoreduction was associated 
with a benefit. Therefore, definition of predictors of complete resection is of 
the utmost importance to avoid surgical burden in patients with both limited 
benefit of the procedure and limited overall life expectancy. Two prospective 
multicentre randomised surgical trials in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian 
cancer (DESKTOP III [NCT #01166737] and GOG 213 [NSC #704865]) comparing 
secondary cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy versus 
chemotherapy alone have been conducted. The results of the DESKTOP III were 
recently presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in 
Chicago. It showed a benefit of secondary cytoreductive surgery exclusively in 
patients with complete resection with a progression-free survival of 5.6 months 
(P < 0.001). This overview aims to support this task and concentrates on the 
currently available data regarding surgery in recurrent ovarian cancer.

Endoscopic treatments, including endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic 
submucosal dissection, are well accepted as standard treatments for early 
gastric cancers. However, there are few studies evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of this approach for early gastric cancers in patients aged over 80 
years, and the post-treatment prognosis remains unclear. Here, we 
retrospectively analyzed the medical records and evaluated the safety and 
efficacy of endoscopic treatment for early gastric cancers in patients aged over 
80 years (group A) compared with non-elderly patients aged 65-79 years (group B) 
and under 65 years (group C). In this study, we enrolled 53 patients (mean age, 
82 years) in group A, 217 patients (mean age, 73 years) in group B, and 89 
patients (mean age, 60 years) in group C who received endoscopic treatment at 
Kyoto University Hospital between 2001 and 2010. The incidence of 
treatment-related complications including aspiration pneumonia, bleeding, and 
perforation was 19% (10/53) in group A, 9.7% (21/217) in group B, and 6.7% 
(6/89) in group C, respectively. In particular, only the incidence of aspiration 
pneumonia was significantly higher in group A [11% (6/53) ] than in the other 
two groups [1.8% (4/217) in group B and 1.1% (1/89) in group C]. There was no 
significant difference in the curative resection rate and recurrence rate 
including metachronous lesions among the three groups. In group A, the median 
survival calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method was 8.0 years, and the 5-year 
survival rate was 73%. No gastric cancer-related deaths were observed in all 
groups. In conclusion, endoscopic treatment for early gastric cancers may 
contribute to an improvement in life expectancy, even among patients aged over 
80 years, provided an experienced gastroenterologist selects the appropriate 
patients based on not only the endoscopic findings for the lesion but also the 
severity of any comorbidities. However, it is noteworthy that our elderly group 
aged over 80 years had a high risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
