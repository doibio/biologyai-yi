Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) targeting high-risk men who have sex with men 
(MSM) has been shown to be a cost-effective HIV control measure. However, the 
approach could be a challenge in low HIV incidence places with a low proportion 
of high-risk MSM. To examine the impact of PrEP in such setting in Asia, we 
developed an epidemic model and conducted cost-effectiveness analysis using 
empirical multicentre clinical and HIV sequence data from HIV-infected MSM in 
Hong Kong, in conjunction with behavioural data of local MSM. Without PrEP, the 
HIV incidence (per 100 person-years) would increase from 1.1 to 1.6 between 2011 
and 2021. PrEP could avert 3-63% of total new infections in a five-year period 
(2017-2021), the variability of which depends on the implementation strategies 
and combination with test-and-treat. However, under current market drug price in 
2016, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALYG) of PrEP 
(USD1583136/QALYG) is almost 3 times higher than test-and-treat intervention 
alone (USD396874/QALYG). Assuming 93% fall of PrEP drug price and in combination 
with test-and-treat, putting 30% of MSM on non-targeting PrEP would be more 
feasible, cost-effective (USD268915/QALYG), and could avert more new infections 
(40%). PrEP could contribute to HIV epidemic control in a low incidence place.

Self-assembly of proteins into filaments, such as actin and tubulin filaments, 
underlies essential cellular processes in all three domains of life. The early 
emergence of filaments in evolutionary history suggests that filament genesis 
might be a robust process. Here we describe the fortuitous construction of GFP 
fusion proteins that self-assemble as fluorescent polar filaments in Escherichia 
coli. Filament formation is achieved by appending as few as 12 residues to GFP. 
Crystal structures reveal that each protomer donates an appendage to fill a 
groove between the two following protomers along the filament. This exchange of 
appendages resembles runaway domain swapping but is distinguished by higher 
efficiency because monomers cannot competitively bind their own appendages. 
Ample evidence for this 'runaway domain coupling' mechanism in nature suggests 
it could facilitate the evolutionary pathway from globular protein to polar 
filament, requiring a minimal extension of protein sequence and no substantial 
refolding.

CONTEXT: The aim of palliative care is to improve quality of life for patients 
with serious illnesses by treating their symptoms and adverse effects. Hospice 
care also aims for this for patients with a life expectancy of six months or 
less. When conventional therapies do not provide adequate symptom management or 
produce their own adverse effects, patients, families, and caregivers may prefer 
complementary or alternative approaches in their care.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the available evidence 
on the use of complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) in hospice and 
palliative care and to summarize their potential benefits.
METHODS: A defined search strategy was used in reviewing literature from major 
databases. Searches were conducted using base terms and the symptom in question. 
Symptoms included anxiety, pain, dyspnea, cough, fatigue, insomnia, nausea, and 
vomiting. Studies were selected for further evaluation based on relevancy and 
study type. References of systematic reviews were also assessed. After 
evaluation using quality assessment tools, findings were summarized and the 
review was structured based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
RESULTS: Out of 4682 studies, 17 were identified for further evaluation. 
Therapies included acupressure, acupuncture, aromatherapy massage, breathing, 
hypnotherapy, massage, meditation, music therapy, reflexology, and reiki. Many 
studies demonstrated a short-term benefit in symptom improvement from baseline 
with CAM, although a significant benefit was not found between groups.
CONCLUSION: CAM may provide a limited short-term benefit in patients with 
symptom burden. Additional studies are needed to clarify the potential value of 
CAM in the hospice or palliative setting.

disease practice guideline: A systematic review.

BACKGROUND: The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 
(ACC/AHA) recently published a rigorous framework to guide integration of 
economic data into clinical guidelines. We assessed the quality of economic 
evaluations in a major ACC/AHA clinical guidance report.
METHODS: We systematically identified cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of RCTs 
cited in the ACC/AHA 2012 Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients 
with Stable Ischemic Heart Disease. We extracted: (1) study identifiers; (2) 
parent RCT information; (3) economic analysis characteristics; and (4) study 
quality using the Quality of Health Economic Studies instrument (QHES).
RESULTS: Quality scores were categorized as high (≥75 points) or low (<75 
points). Of 1,266 citations in the guideline, 219 were RCTs associated with 77 
CEAs. Mean quality score was 81 (out of 100) and improved over time, though 
29.9% of studies were low-quality. Cost-per-QALY was the most commonly reported 
primary outcome (39.0%). Low-quality studies were less likely to report study 
perspective, use appropriate time horizons, or address statistical and clinical 
uncertainty. Funding was overwhelmingly private (83%). A detailed methodological 
assessment of high-quality studies revealed domains of additional methodological 
issues not identified by the QHES.
CONCLUSIONS: Economic evaluations of RCTs in the 2012 ACC/AHA ischemic heart 
disease guideline largely had high QHES scores but methodological issues existed 
among "high-quality" studies. Because the ACC/AHA has generally been more 
systematic in its integration of scientific evidence compared to other 
professional societies, it is likely that most societies will need to proceed 
more cautiously in their integration of economic evidence.

Toxicity of pollutants is known to have a different impact depending on the 
organisms' life stage. Standard tests are often based on one life stage, i.e. 
effects could be underestimated. We aimed here to develop and optimize a test 
system using eggs of Folsomia candida (4-5 days) instead of the juveniles 
(10-12 days old) required by the OECD standard test guideline No. 232 (2009). 
Accordingly, the exposure time and thus the test duration was extended. Tests 
with "standard" juveniles (10-12 days old) and, adults (21 and 28 days old) were 
also performed. Cadmium (Cd) was used as test substance. The extension to the 
test guideline starts as follows: 1) synchronization of eggs in a thin soil 
layer on plaster of Paris, 2) selection of viable eggs, 3) burying these eggs in 
groups of 5 in soil. Afterwards, the test procedure will follow the standard 
procedure as described in the OECD standard test. Cadmium caused ca. 50% effects 
on reproduction at 60 mg Cd/kg soil dry weight (DW) when exposing juveniles or 
adults. There was no significant impact of Cd on the eggs, the hatching process 
or the latter life stages until ca. 250 mg Cd/kg DW (Cd is stable during this 
exposure period). Hence, Cd seems to affect reproduction before egg laying, 
i.e., during egg formation or during juvenile-adult stages. In order to clarify 
whether other chemicals do act in a similar way testing with different chemicals 
is highly recommended. Testing of different life stages does provide insight on 
the mechanisms and effects of contaminants and offers important insight.

A good understanding of disease burden is the first step in formulating a 
response to it. Analysis of the Global Burden of Disease 2016 dataset shows an 
87% rise in the global burden of chronic kidney disease and a doubling of 
chronic kidney disease deaths between 1990 and 2016. Countries with a lower 
level of socioeconomic development and poorer access to quality health care 
experience a higher chronic kidney disease burden. Reductions in global 
disability-adjusted life-years over time indicate progress, but deviations from 
this trend in some geographies present a call to action.

The last quarter century witnessed significant population growth, aging, and 
major changes in epidemiologic trends, which may have shaped the state of 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) epidemiology. Here, we used the Global Burden of 
Disease study data and methodologies to describe the change in burden of CKD 
from 1990 to 2016 involving incidence, prevalence, death, and 
disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs). Globally, the incidence of CKD increased 
by 89% to 21,328,972 (uncertainty interval 19,100,079- 23,599,380), prevalence 
increased by 87% to 275,929,799 (uncertainty interval 252,442,316-300,414,224), 
death due to CKD increased by 98% to 1,186,561 (uncertainty interval 
1,150,743-1,236,564), and DALYs increased by 62% to 35,032,384 (uncertainty 
interval 32,622,073-37,954,350). Measures of burden varied substantially by 
level of development and geography. Decomposition analyses showed that the 
increase in CKD DALYs was driven by population growth and aging. Globally and in 
most Global Burden of Disease study regions, age-standardized DALY rates 
decreased, except in High-income North America, Central Latin America, Oceania, 
Southern Sub-Saharan Africa, and Central Asia, where the increased burden of CKD 
due to diabetes and to a lesser extent CKD due to hypertension and other causes 
outpaced burden expected by demographic expansion. More of the CKD burden (63%) 
was in low and lower-middle-income countries. There was an inverse relationship 
between age-standardized CKD DALY rate and health care access and quality of 
care. Frontier analyses showed significant opportunities for improvement at all 
levels of the development spectrum. Thus, the global toll of CKD is significant, 
rising, and unevenly distributed; it is primarily driven by demographic 
expansion and in some regions a significant tide of diabetes. Opportunities 
exist to reduce CKD burden at all levels of development.

Circular economy strategies encourage, among others, concrete actions to extend 
the product lifetime. Product's repair and reuse, and component harvesting for 
reuse, all require the facilitated access to product components. Consequently, a 
reduction of the disassembly time and the related costs will increase the 
economic feasibility of product lifetime extension and therefore increase the 
viability of a circular economy in industrialised regions. Furthermore, 
disassembly has the potential to significantly increase the recycling yield and 
purity for precious metals, critical metals and plastics. For this reason, the 
European Commission and several ecolabels have considered to include design for 
disassembly requirements in legislation or voluntary environmental instruments. 
However, up to date, there is no standardised method to evaluate the ease of 
disassembly in an unambiguous manner with a good trade-off between the efforts 
required to apply the method and the accuracy of the determined disassembly 
time. The article proposes a robust method "eDiM" (ease of Disassembly Metric), 
to calculate the disassembly time based on the Maynard operation sequence 
technique (MOST). A straightforward calculation sheet is employed in eDiM to 
calculate the disassembly time given the sequence of actions and basic product 
information. This makes the results fully verifiable in an unambiguous manner, 
which makes eDiM suited to be used in policy measures in contrast to the results 
of prior developed methods One of the innovative aspects of eDiM is the 
categorization of disassembly tasks in six categories, which provides better 
insights on which disassembly tasks are the most time consuming and how the 
product design could be improved. The proposed method is illustrated by means of 
a case study of an LCD monitor. The presented case study demonstrates how the 
proposed method can be used in a policy context and how the calculated 
disassembly times per category can provide insights to manufacturers to improve 
the disassemblability of their products. The results also demonstrate how the 
proposed method can produce realistic results with only limited detail of input 
data.

George's University of London London UK.

BACKGROUND: The recent Emergency Laparotomy Pathway Quality Improvement Care 
(ELPQuiC) study showed that the use of a specific care bundle reduced mortality 
in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. However, the costs of 
implementation of the ELPQuiC bundle remain unknown. The aim of this study was 
to assess the in-hospital and societal costs of implementing the ELPQuiC bundle.
METHODS: The ELPQuiC study employed a before-after approach using quality 
improvement methodology. To assess the costs and cost-effectiveness of the 
bundle, two models were constructed: a short-term model to assess in-hospital 
costs and a long-term model (societal decision tree) to evaluate the patient's 
lifetime costs (in euros).
RESULTS: Using health economic modelling and data collected from the ELPQuiC 
study, estimated costs for initial implementation of the ELPQuiC bundle were €30 
026·11 (range 1794·64-40 784·06) per hospital. In-hospital costs per patient 
were estimated at €14 817·24 for standard (non-care bundle) treatment versus €15 
971·24 for the ELPQuiC bundle treatment. Taking a societal perspective, lifetime 
costs of the patient in the standard group were €23 058·87, compared with €19 
102·37 for patients receiving the ELPQuiC bundle. The increased life expectancy 
of 4 months for patients treated with the ELPQuiC bundle was associated with 
cost savings of €11 410·38 per quality-adjusted life-year saved.
CONCLUSION: Implementation of the ELPQuiC bundle is associated with lower 
mortality and higher in-hospital costs but reduced societal costs.

INTRODUCTION: Proximal (iliocaval and iliofemoral) deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 
and pulmonary thromboembolism are the second cause of death in patients with 
cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in 35 patients with 
cancer treated with endovascular therapy for proximal DVT. The primary objective 
was to evaluate the technical success of the procedure and the 30-day and 
long-term symptom improvement.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with a mean age of 57.7 years were treated. In 27 
patients, DVT was due to tumor compression and/or invasion of the iliocaval 
venous axis, and in the remaining 8, it was secondary to their 
hypercoagulability state. The revascularization techniques used were manual 
catheter-directed aspiration of the thrombus plus angioplasty and stenting. 
Technical success was achieved in 33 patients. No complications occurred. 
Twenty-seven patients were followed up at 30 days posttreatment: 21 were free of 
postthrombotic syndrome, 4 (14.8%) had mild symptoms, and 2 (7.4%) had moderate 
symptoms. The mean long-term follow-up was 27.3 months, with a primary patency 
of 68.8% and assisted and secondary patency rates of 100%.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular revascularization in patients with cancer with 
extensive and symptomatic proximal DVT is safe and efficient, with a low rate of 
complications. We consider that this therapy should be offered to patients with 
cancer with an average or long life expectancy.

A Network-Based Perspective in Alzheimer's Disease: Current State and an 
Integrative Framework.

Dragomir A, Vrahatis AG, Bezerianos A.

A major rise in the prevalence and impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
projected in the coming decades, resulting from increasing life expectancy, thus 
leading to substantially increased healthcare costs. While brain disfunctions at 
the time of diagnosis are irreversible, it is widely accepted that AD pathology 
develops decades before clinical symptoms onset. If incipient processes can be 
detected early in the disease progression, prospective intervention for 
preventing or slowing the disease can be designed. Currently, there is no 
noninvasive biomarker available to detect and monitor early stages of disease 
progression. The complex etiology of AD warrants a systems-based approach 
supporting the integration of multimodal and multilevel data, while 
network-based modeling provides the scaffolding for methods revealing complex 
systems-level disruptions initiated by the disease. In this work, we review 
current state-of-the-art, focusing on network-based biomarkers at molecular and 
brain functional connectivity levels. Particular emphasis is placed on outlining 
recent trends, which highlight the functional importance of modular 
substructures in molecular and connectivity networks and their potential 
biomarker value. Our perspective is rooted in network medicine and summarizes 
the pipelines for identifying network-based biomarkers, as well as the benefits 
of integrating genotype and brain phenotype information for a comprehensively 
noninvasive approach in the early diagnosis of AD. Finally, we propose a 
framework for integrating knowledge from molecular and brain connectivity 
levels, which has the potential to enable noninvasive diagnosis, provide support 
for monitoring therapies, and help understand heretofore unexamined deep level 
relations between genotype and brain phenotype.

Dynamics of life expectancy at birth (LE0) and at older ages has been analyzed 
and the contribution of older ages (60+) to the life expectancy changes has been 
estimated for greatest Russian megacities Moscow and Saint-Petersburg. The 
contributions of aggregated age groups to differences of LE0 values for Moscow 
and Saint-Petersburg have been studied. It has been found, in particular, that 
the increase in life expectancy at older ages makes a significant contribution 
to the LE0 growth.

Health care reimbursement agencies in countries other than the US often rely on 
cost-effectiveness evidence for drug coverage decisions, signaling to drug 
manufacturers their expectations for value-based pricing. To see whether drug 
prices in the US are influenced by value, we estimated the range of 
cost-effectiveness for thirty frequently prescribed cardiovascular drugs. We 
extrapolated evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine average 
lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and payer-related costs and to 
calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), the principal metric of 
cost-effectiveness studies. Across the thirty drugs, the ICERs ranged from 
cost-saving with increased QALYs to more costly with decreased QALYs. This range 
suggests that drug pricing is not consistently influenced by value, or that such 
influence is masked by inaccessible factors, such as price discounts. Our 
findings highlight the need to debate how to define and use value-based evidence 
to inform US coverage and reimbursement decision making.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate probabilities of achieving the 
statistical cure from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with hepatic resection (HR) 
and liver transplantation (LT).
BACKGROUND: Statistical cure occurs when the mortality of a specific population 
returns to values of that of general population. Resection and transplantation 
are considered potentially curative therapies for HCC, but their effect on the 
residual entire life-expectancy has never been investigated.
METHODS: Data from 3286 HCC patients treated with LT (n = 1218) or HR (n = 2068) 
were used to estimate statistical cure. Disease-free survival (DFS) was the 
primary survival measure to estimate cure fractions through a nonmixture model. 
Overall survival (OS) was a secondary measure. In both, patients were matched 
with general population by age, sex, year, and race/ethnicity. Cure variations 
after LT were also adjusted for different waiting-list drop-outs.
RESULTS: Considering DFS, the cure fraction after LT was 74.1% and after HR was 
24.1% (effect size >0.8). LT outperformed HR within all transplant criteria 
considered (effect size >0.8), especially for multiple tumors (>0.9) and even in 
presence of a drop-out up to 20% (>0.5). Considering OS, the cure fraction after 
LT marginally increased to 75.8%, and after that HR increased to 40.5%. The 
effect size of LT over HR in terms of cure decreased for oligonodular tumors 
(<0.5), became small for drop-out up to ∼20% (<0.2), and negligible for single 
tumors <5 cm (∼0.1).
CONCLUSION: As other malignancies, statistical cure can occur for HCC, primarily 
with LT and secondarily with HR, depending on waiting-list capabilities and 
efficacy of tumor recurrence therapies after resection.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To characterize global differences in otitis media 
(OM)-related disease burden between socioeconomically advantaged and 
disadvantaged nations.
METHODS: Using the Global Health Data Exchange, worldwide OM burden was 
evaluated using age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 
100,000 individuals in 183 countries from 1990 to 2015. Countries were organized 
by socioeconomic status using Human Development Index (HDI) values collected 
from the United Nations Development Program. Gini coefficients and concentration 
indices were employed to analyze disparities in OM disease burden.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2015, the mean DALY rate across all nations decreased by 
21.9%. When considering disease burden in relation to socioeconomic status, 
age-standardized DALYs decreased as HDI values increased (p < 0.001). For both 
children and adults, DALY rates were significantly different between HDI groups 
(p < 0.01). Gini coefficients decreased from 0.821 in 1990 to 0.810 in 2015, 
indicating a modest reduction in international health inequality. Global 
disparities in OM disease burden, as measured by the concentration index, 
worsened from 1990 to 2010 before showing a small trend reversal in 2015.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first analysis investigating 
socioeconomic-related global disparities in OM disease burden using HDI values, 
Gini coefficients, and concentration indices. While the overall mean decrease in 
DALY rate from 1990 to 2015 is encouraging, the net decrease in concentration 
index during this period suggests less-developed nations continue to shoulder a 
disproportionate burden. Greater resource allocation to resource-poor nations 
may be warranted, as disease burden negatively impacts these countries to a 
greater degree.

Wnt signaling plays critical roles in dorsoventral fate specification and 
anteroposterior patterning, as well as in morphogenetic cell movements. 
Dishevelled proteins, or Dvls, mediate the activation of Wnt/ß-catenin and 
Wnt/planar cell polarity pathways. There are at least three highly conserved Dvl 
proteins in vertebrates, but the implication of each Dvl in key early 
developmental processes remains poorly understood. In this study, we use 
genome-editing approach to generate different combinations of maternal and 
zygotic dvl mutants in zebrafish, and examine their functions during early 
development. Maternal transcripts for dvl2 and dvl3a are most abundantly 
expressed, whereas the transcript levels of other dvl genes are negligible. 
Phenotypic and molecular analyses show that early dorsal fate specification is 
not affected in maternal and zygotic dvl2 and dvl3a double mutants, suggesting 
that the two proteins may be dispensable for the activation of maternal 
Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Interestingly, convergence and extension movements and 
anteroposterior patterning require both maternal and the zygotic functions of 
Dvl2 and Dvl3a, but these processes are more sensitive to Dvl2 dosage. Zygotic 
dvl2 and dvl3a double mutants display mild axis extension defect with correct 
anteroposterior patterning. However, maternal and zygotic double mutants exhibit 
most strongly impaired convergence and extension movements, severe trunk and 
posterior deficiencies, and frequent occurrence of cyclopia and craniofacial 
defects. Our results suggest that Dvl2 and Dvl3a products are required for the 
activation of zygotic Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and Wnt/planar cell polarity 
pathway, and regulate zygotic developmental processes in a dosage-dependent 
manner. This work provides insight into the mechanisms of Dvl-mediated Wnt 
signaling pathways during early vertebrate development.

TLR25 is a new member of TLR1 family that is only identified in teleosts, but 
its function in immune response is still unclear. In current study, the coding 
sequence (CDS) of TLR25 was cloned from Schizothorax prenanti (named spTLR25), 
and spTLR25 is 2454 bp in length and coding a protein of 817 aa. The spTLR25 
contains a signal peptide, twenty leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, a LRR 
C-terminal (LRRCT) motif, a transmembrane region and a Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) 
domain. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that spTLR25 has the closest 
relationship with Cyprinus carpio (C. carpio) TLR25-2. The 3D structure of 
spTLR25 exhibits 5 α-helices and 3 β-sheets in the TIR domain, and 8 α-helices 
and 6 β-sheets in the LRR domains. The spTLR25 is mainly expressed in 
immune-related tissues and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). Furthermore, the 
expression levels of spTLR25 were upregulated in spleen, head kidney and liver 
while S. prenanti was challenged with LPS or Aeromonas hydrophila (Ah), and the 
upregulation was also detected in head kidney leukocytes (HKL) after LPS and 
Poly (I:C) stimulation. The luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that NF-κB 
and type I IFNs signaling pathways can be activated by spTLR25, and this process 
may involve in the cascade amplification of TLR25-MyD88 signaling. In addition, 
the co-localization analysis showed that spTLR25 localizes to intracellular 
region. Taken together, our results reveal that teleost-specific TLR25 may be a 
multifunctional receptor for recognizing both LPS and Poly (I:C) and may 
activate NF-κB and type I IFNs signaling pathways.

OBJECTIVES: In the follow-up of patients in a trial of intracoronary sodium 
nitrite given during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we found a reduction in the incidence of 
major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Specifically, MACE rates were 5.2% versus 
25.0% with placebo at 3 years ( P = .013). Such MACE reductions should also be 
associated with economic benefit. Thus, we assessed the cost utility of sodium 
nitrite therapy versus standard primary PCI only.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a model to simulate costs and quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) over the first 36 months after ST-Segment Elevation 
Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). Decision tree analysis was used to assess 
different potential cardiovascular outcomes after STEMI for patients in both 
treatment groups. Model inputs were derived from the NITRITE-AMI study. Cost of 
comparative treatments and follow-up in relation to cardiovascular events was 
calculated from the United Kingdom National Health Service perspective. Higher 
procedural costs for nitrite treatment were offset by lower costs for repeat 
revascularization, myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure 
compared to primary PCI plus placebo. Nitrite treatment was associated with 
higher utility values (0.91 ± 0.19 vs 0.82 ± 0.30, P = .041). The calculated 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £2177 per QALY indicates a 
cost-effective strategy. Furthermore, positive results were maintained when 
input parameters varied, indicating the robustness of our model. In fact, based 
on the difference in utility values, the cost of nitrite could increase by 
4-fold (£2006 per vial) and remain cost-effective.
CONCLUSION: This first analysis of sodium nitrite as a cardioprotective 
treatment demonstrates cost-effectiveness. Although more comparative analysis 
and assessment of longer follow-up times are required, our data indicate the 
considerable potential of nitrite-mediated cardioprotection.

OBJECTIVES: The economic burden of incarceration is substantial in Australia. 
People released from prison are at high risk of poor health and this is an 
important predictor of recidivism. The 'Passports Study' was a randomised 
controlled trial of an intervention designed to increase health service 
utilisation after release from prison. The aim of this study is to conduct a 
cost-utility analysis of this transitional programme.
SETTING: Australia DESIGN: A hybrid simulation model was developed to estimate 
the changes to total economic costs and effectiveness expressed as 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from the adoption of the 'Passports' 
intervention compared with the control group. Model parameters were informed by 
linked data from Queensland Corrective Services, Medicare, Pharmaceutical 
Benefits Scheme, Queensland Hospital Admission Patient Data Collection, 
Emergency Department Information System and National Death Index. Health-related 
quality of life was measured using the Short-Form 8 Health Survey (SF-8). The 
primary outcomes were the costs and estimated QALYs associated with the 
intervention group and the control group. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was 
conducted to test parameter uncertainties.
RESULTS: Compared with the control group where no attempt was made to encourage 
health service utilisation, an average participant in the intervention group 
incurred an extra cost of AUD 1790 and experienced slightly reduced QALYs, which 
indicated that the intervention was dominated in the baseline analysis. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that the transitional programme had 
a low probability of being cost-effective with the outcome measures selected.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study do not provide economic evidence to 
support the widespread adoption of the Passports intervention. Due to the 
reductionist nature of the cost-utility approach, it may be that important 
health-related benefits have been omitted. Another research approach using a 
wider range of health-related measures might generate different conclusions.

In 2014, Truth Initiative launched the national FinishIt campaign to prevent 
smoking initiation among youth and young adults. The significant changes in the 
communications landscape requires further analysis to determine resource 
requirements for public education campaigns relative to their impact. This 
analysis estimates the cost of the FinishIt campaign based on data from 
expenditure records and uses published estimates of the lifetime treatment costs 
and quality-adjusted life years associated with smoking. The total cost of the 
FinishIt campaign for 2014⁻2016 was $162 million. Under assumptions associated 
with the pessimistic base-case (no medical care costs saved through prevention), 
917 smoking careers would need to be averted for the campaign to be 
cost-effective. Assuming smoking leads to increased medical care costs, 7186 
smoking careers would need to be averted for the campaign to be cost-saving. 
Given these thresholds (917 and 7186) and the estimate of the impact of the 
previous truth campaign, the investments in the Truth Initiative's FinishIt 
campaign are likely warranted for preventing smoking careers among youth and 
young adults.

We recently reported the reduced ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel 
activities in the transgenic mouse heart overexpressing the vascular type KATP 
channel pore-forming subunit (Kir6.1). Although dysfunction of cardiac KATP 
channel has been nominated as a cause of cardiomyopathy in human, these 
transgenic mice looked normal as wild-type (WT) during the experiment period 
(~20 weeks). Extended observation period revealed unexpected deaths beginning 
from 30 weeks and about 50% of the transgenic mice died by 55 weeks. Surface ECG
