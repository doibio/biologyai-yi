Life expectancy lengthened over the past 165 years. This is one of the reasons, 
that the prevalence of diseases connected with elderly, including osteoporosis, 
has increased. A physical activity may be used as prophylactic tool against 
osteoporosis and improve the skeletal resistance to bone fractures. 
Mechanotransduction, eg. the response of the cell to mechanical stimuli in bones 
is particularly relevant, because the mammalian skeleton remodels to adapt to 
loading environment. It also helps to gain and maintain the maximal BMD. The 
molecular mechanism of mechanotransduction is complex and depends on integrated 
activity of osteoblasts and osteocytes. Osteocytes are the cell that posses the 
ability to sense mechanical load. Shear stress induced in bones canaliculi by 
fluid flow induces the synthesis of PGE2, NO and activation of integrins, what 
triggers the Wnt signaling pathway. This pathway is important in osteocytes to 
prevent apoptosis and transmit the signals to other bone cells, and in 
osteoblasts for differentiation, proliferation and synthesis of bone matrix. The 
effectiveness of physical training in osteoporosis prevention depends on strain 
magnitude, strain rate, cycle number, strain frequency and rest periods, and the 
increase in BMD is found only in loaded parts of skeleton.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia is projected to rise dramatically in 
future with increasing life expectancy. Though dementia itself is not treatable 
in majority of cases, modification of co-morbid medical conditions may influence 
onset and rate of decline of cognitive functions.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of dementia in elderly by assessing 
cognitive function and to assess the association of cardiovascular risk factors 
with cognitive functions.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross sectional analytical study.
PARTICIPANTS: 400 consecutive elderly subjects > 65 years attending Geriatric 
OPD, Dept. of Medicine, Indira Gandhi Government Medical College, Nagpur, were 
recruited and assessed for cognitive functions by applying Mini Mental Status 
examination Score (MMSE). Relationships between cardiovascular risk factors and 
impaired cognitive score were determined.
RESULTS: Prevalence of impaired cognitive function (MMSE Score < 25) was 33.25% 
(133 cases), while that of dementia (MMSE < 23) was 3.25 % (13 cases) in this 
elderly population. Impaired cognitive function was higher in those with low 
education and low socioeconomic status, (p = < 0.001). Increasing age, Female 
gender, alcohol intake and high cholesterol were found to be independently 
associated with impaired cognitive score in multiple logistic regression (p = < 
0.001). Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking and obesity were not associated 
with impaired cognitive score.
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of cognitive impairment rises significantly as the age 
advances and is associated with alcohol intake and high cholesterol.

BACKGROUND: Although the value of telemonitoring in heart failure patients is 
increasingly studied, little is known about the value of the separate components 
of telehealth: ICT guided disease management and telemonitoring. The aim of this 
study is to investigate the value of telemonitoring added to ICT guided disease 
management (DM) on the quality and efficiency of care in patients with chronic 
heart failure (CHF) after a hospitalisation.
METHODS/DESIGN: The study is divided in two arms; a control arm (DM) and an 
intervention arm (DM+TM) in 10 hospitals in the Netherlands. In total 220 
patients will be included after worsening of CHF (DM: N = 90, DM+TM: N = 130). 
Total follow-up will be 9 months. Data will be collected at inclusion and then 
after 2 weeks, 4.5 and 9 months. The primary endpoint of this study is a 
composite score of: 1: death from any cause during the follow-up of the study, 
2: first readmission for HF and 3: change in quality of life compared to 
baseline, assessed by the Minnesota Living with Heart failure Questionnaire. The 
study has started in December 2009 and results are expected in 2012.
CONCLUSIONS: The IN TOUCH study is the first to investigate the effect of 
telemonitoring on top of ICT guided DM on the quality and efficiency of care in 
patients with worsening HF and will use a composite score as its primary 
endpoint.

Results of cemented femoral revisions for periprosthetic femoral fractures in 
the elderly.

The treatment goals of Vancouver type B2 periprosthetic femoral fractures in 
elderly patients with a limited life expectancy are early weight bearing without 
compromising the fracture healing. Thirty-one patients with a mean age of 82 
years were treated with a long cemented stem with additional allograft or plate 
fixation, followed by immediate full weight bearing. Seven major complications 
occurred within the first 3 months postoperatively. Forty-three percent of 
patients had died within the first year with their implant in place. Sixteen 
patients had survived more than 1 year. None of the implants had to be revised 
at a mean follow-up of 46 months. The results of this series suggest that this 
technique can provide acceptable results and offers the advantages of reduced 
cost and early weight bearing.

Taking care of patients in oncology needs safety venous access, as percutaneous 
implantable port. These venous devices are sometimes responsible for serious 
adverse events. Infection and thrombosis are the two main complications that can 
occur early or be delayed. Clinical examination and especially, evaluation of 
the severity are very important keys to manage the patients. They both can lead 
to the ablation of the central venous device, which is an option to keep always 
in mind. However, whatever the clinical situation is, the oncologic context such 
as life expectancy and the need for a venous access is also a data to 
counterbalance.

CONTEXT: Besides short stature and gonadal dysgenesis, Turner syndrome (TS) is 
associated with various abnormalities. Adults with TS have a reduced life 
expectancy, mainly related to structural abnormalities of the heart and aorta, 
and an increased risk of atherosclerosis.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate the yield of an initial standardized 
multidisciplinary screening in adult TS patients.
DESIGN AND SETTING: This was an observational study at a multidisciplinary care 
unit for adult women with TS.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants were adult women with TS (n = 150). Mean age was 31.0 
± 10.4 yr, with 47% karyotype 45,X.
INTERVENTIONS: All women were consulted by an endocrinologist, a gynecologist, a 
cardiologist, an otorhinolaryngologist, and when indicated, a psychologist. The 
screening included magnetic resonance imaging of the heart and aorta, 
echocardiography, electrocardiogram, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, renal 
ultrasound, audiogram, and laboratory investigations according to international 
expert recommendations.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: New diagnoses and prevalence of TS-associated morbidity 
were evaluated.
RESULTS: Thirty percent of patients currently lacked medical follow-up, and 15% 
lacked estrogen replacement therapy in the recent last years. The following 
disorders were newly diagnosed: bicuspid aortic valve (n = 13), coarctation of 
the aorta (n = 9), elongation of the transverse aortic arch (n = 27), dilation 
of the aorta (n = 34), osteoporosis (n = 8), osteopenia (n = 56), renal 
abnormalities (n = 7), subclinical hypothyroidism (n = 33), celiac disease (n = 
3), glucose intolerance (n = 12), dyslipidemia (n = 52), hypertension (n = 39), 
and hearing loss warranting a hearing aid (n = 8). Psychological consultation 
was needed in 23 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Standardized multidisciplinary evaluation of adult women with TS as 
advocated by expert opinion is effective and identifies significant morbidity. 
Girls with TS benefit from a careful transition to ongoing adult medical care.

How applicable are clinical practice guidelines to elderly patients with 
comorbidities?

Mutasingwa DR(1), Ge H, Upshur RE.

Author information:
(1)Public Health and Preventive Medicine program, Dalla Lana School of Public 
Health, University of Toronto, Ontario.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the applicability of 10 common clinical practice 
guidelines (CPGs) to elderly patients with multiple comorbidities.
DESIGN: Content analysis of published Canadian CPGs for the following chronic 
diseases: diabetes, dyslipidemia, dementia, congestive heart failure, 
depression, osteoporosis, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, and osteoarthritis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence or absence of 4 key indicators of applicability 
of CPGs to elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. These indicators 
include any mention of older adults or people with comorbidities, time needed to 
treat to benefit in the context of life expectancy, and barriers to 
implementation of the CPG.
RESULTS: Out of the 10 CPGs reviewed, 7 mentioned treatment of the elderly, 8 
mentioned people with comorbidities, 4 indicated the time needed to treat to 
benefit in the context of life expectancy, 5 discussed barriers to 
implementation, and 7 discussed the quality of evidence.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that although most CPGs discuss the elderly 
population, only a handful of them adequately address issues related to elderly 
patients with comorbidities. In order to make CPGs more patient centred rather 
than disease driven, guideline developers should include information on elderly 
patients with comorbidities.

OBJECTIF: Déterminer l’applicabilité aux patients âgés qui souffrent de 
multiples affections de 10 directives de pratique clinique (DPC) courantes.
TYPE D’ÉTUDE: Analyse de contenu des DPC canadiennes pour les maladies 
chroniques suivantes : diabète, dyslipidémie, démences, insuffisance cardiaque, 
dépression, ostéoporose, hypertension, reflux gastro-œsophagien, maladie 
pulmonaire obstructive chronique et arthrose.
PRINCIPAUX PARAMÈTRES À L’ÉTUDE: Présence ou absence de 4 indicateurs clés de 
l’applicabilité des DPC aux patients avec comorbidité. Ces indicateurs incluent 
toute mention d’adultes âgés ou de sujets avec comorbidité, durée du traitements 
nécessaire pour obtenir un avantage compte tenu de l’espérance de vie et 
obstacles à la mise en œuvre des DPC.
RÉSULTATS: Sur les 10 DPC à l’étude, 7 parlaient du traitement des personnes 
âgées, 8 mentionnaient les patients avec comorbidité, 4 indiquaient le temps de 
traitement nécessaire pour obtenir un avantage compte tenu de l’espérance de 
vie, 5 discutaient des obstacles à l’application des DPC et 7 de la qualité des 
preuves.
CONCLUSION: Cette étude montre que même si la plupart des DPC font mention de la 
population âgée, très peu discutent adéquatement des problèmes des patients âgés 
avec comorbidité. Afin que les DPC soient davantage centrées sur les patients 
plutôt que sur les maladies, les concepteurs des directives devraient inclure 
des informations sur les patients avec comorbidité.

Diplopods are very susceptible to various degrees of environmental disturbance, 
particularly climate, altitude and diet. In order to increase our understanding 
of millipede ecological plasticity, we used fertility tables to access and to 
compare the fertility and survival of two populations of the parthenogenetic 
species Poratia salvator from two areas with distinct characteristics. 
Collecting was conducted in two localities within the state of Mato Grosso, in 
the Pantanal of Mato Grosso, municipality of Nossa Senhora do Livramento, and in 
the municipality of Várzea Grande. The specimens were maintained at room 
temperature. In the first generation, individuals from the Pantanal of Mato 
Grosso population reproduced early and also died earlier when compared with 
individuals from the Várzea Grande population. Furthermore, the population from 
the Pantanal had a lower net reproduction rate and a higher intrinsic growth 
rate than the population from the Várzea Grande. The generation time was lower 
for the Pantanal population than for the Várzea Grande population. In the second 
generation, the net reproduction rate observed for both populations was higher 
than that observed in the first generation, suggesting an increase in the 
reproductive potential of the females throughout their lives. The intrinsic 
growth rate of both populations decreased as a function of an increase in 
generation time observed in the second generation. As a result, the population 
growth rate in the second generation was slower when compared with the first 
generation, probably a result of the longer life expectancy of the second 
generation, which may have become adapted to the artificial conditions of the 
experiment.

The Burch-Schneider cage for reconstruction after metastatic destruction of the 
acetabulum: outcome and complications.

INTRODUCTION: The Burch-Schneider cage is an established implant in revision 
surgery after hip arthroplasty that is used for reconstructing osseous defects 
in the acetabulum. However, there are only a few reports about the use of cages 
in patients with metastatic destruction of the acetabulum. The aim of this 
retrospective study was to assess the outcome and complications of this 
procedure.
METHODS: The records of 15 patients with metastatic acetabular defects using the 
Burch-Schneider cage were examined pre- and postoperatively. X-rays were 
analyzed, clinical and functional outcome was assessed by the Harris hip score 
(HHS) and the visual analogue scale (VAS) for subjective pain perception. The 
follow-up of 14 months was due to the underlying disease.
RESULTS: The overall revision rate was 26%. The HHS improved from 33 (range 
25-39) to 69 (range 35-93). The VAS improved from 7.5 to 3.2.
CONCLUSION: The life expectancy of patients with bone metastasis can be short 
and patients should be carefully selected for a surgical treatment. The 
implantation of a protrusio cage can improve the quality of life in these 
patients by increasing their mobility and reducing pain. The complication rate 
is comparable with the rates for other surgical methods for metastatic 
acetabular lesions. For surgeons who are familiar with this implant, it seems to 
be a good option in treating such cases.

scott.braithwaite@nyumc.org

OBJECTIVE: To identify cardiovascular health services with a high level of 
evidence to suggest that they deliver favorable value.
STUDY DESIGN: Evidence synthesis using the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry.
METHODS: We queried the registry to identify published cost-effectiveness 
analyses of cardiovascular health services in the United States. In addition to 
searching the registry, we performed supplementary searches of published 
literature for cost-effectiveness studies of cardiovascular interventions that 
were endorsed by guidelines of national medical and scientific societies. We 
defined favorable value as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $100,000 
or less per quality-adjusted life-year.
RESULTS: Our initial review of cardiovascular health services in the United 
States revealed 174 separate peer-reviewed studies. Of those, 157 studies did 
not meet our inclusion criteria, leaving 17 studies for further evaluation that 
covered the following services with potentially high value: statins to prevent 
myocardial infarction (for primary and secondary prevention), screening for and 
treatment of high blood pressure (diuretics or beta-blockers and 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the case of diabetes) to prevent 
myocardial infarction and stroke, warfarin sodium and low-molecular-weight 
heparin to prevent pulmonary emboli, implantable cardiac defibrillators for 
patients at high risk of sudden death, antiplatelet drugs (aspirin and 
clopidogrel bisulfate) to prevent future myocardial infarction, beta-blockers 
for patients who have had myocardial infarction, warfarin to prevent future 
stroke in persons with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and percutaneous 
procedures to relieve claudication symptoms.
CONCLUSION: We describe a new way of synthesizing cost-effectiveness evidence 
for use by consumers, payers, and other decision makers.

Sensory systems provide organisms from bacteria to humans with the ability to 
interact with the world. Numerous senses have evolved that allow animals to 
detect and decode cues from sources in both their external and internal 
environments. Recent advances in understanding the central mechanisms by which 
the brains of simple organisms evaluate different cues and initiate behavioral 
decisions, coupled with observations that sensory manipulations are capable of 
altering organismal lifespan, have opened the door for powerful new research 
into aging. Although direct links between sensory perception and aging have been 
established only recently, here we discuss these initial discoveries and 
evaluate the potential for different forms of sensory processing to modulate 
lifespan across taxa. Harnessing the neurobiology of simple model systems to 
study the biological impact of sensory experiences will yield insights into the 
broad influence of sensory perception in mammals and may help uncover new 
mechanisms of healthy aging.

[EAU guidelines on prostate cancer. Part I: screening, diagnosis, and treatment 
of clinically localised disease].

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to present a summary of the 2010 version of the European 
Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on the screening, diagnosis, and 
treatment of clinically localised cancer of the prostate (PCa).
METHODS: The working panel performed a literature review of the new data 
emerging from 2007 to 2010. The guidelines were updated, and level of evidence 
and grade of recommendation were added to the text based on a systematic review 
of the literature, which included a search of online databases and bibliographic 
reviews.
RESULTS: A full version is available at the EAU office or Web site 
(www.uroweb.org). Current evidence is insufficient to warrant widespread 
population-based screening by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for PCa. A 
systematic prostate biopsy under ultrasound guidance and local anaesthesia is 
the preferred diagnostic method. Active surveillance represents a viable option 
in men with low-risk PCa and a long life expectancy. PSA doubling time in < 3 yr 
or a biopsy progression indicates the need for active intervention. In men with 
locally advanced PCa in whom local therapy is not mandatory, watchful waiting 
(WW) is a treatment alternative to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with 
equivalent oncologic efficacy. Active treatment is mostly recommended for 
patients with localised disease and a long life expectancy with radical 
prostatectomy (RP) shown to be superior to WW in a prospective randomised trial. 
Nerve-sparing RP represents the approach of choice in organ-confined disease; 
neoadjuvant androgen deprivation demonstrates no improvement of outcome 
variables. Radiation therapy should be performed with at least 74Gy and 78Gy in 
low-risk and intermediate/high-risk PCa, respectively. For locally advanced 
disease, adjuvant ADT for 3 yr results in superior disease-specific and overall 
survival rates and represents the treatment of choice. Follow-up after local 
therapy is largely based on PSA, and a disease-specific history with imaging is 
indicated only when symptoms occur.
CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge in the field of PCa is rapidly changing. These EAU 
guidelines on PCa summarise the most recent findings and put them into clinical 
practice.

Fondaparinux for isolated superficial vein thrombosis of the legs: a 
cost-effectiveness analysis.

BACKGROUND: According to the Comparison of Arixtra in Lower Limb Superficial 
Vein Thrombosis with Placebo (CALISTO) study, a recent randomized, controlled 
trial, prophylactic fondaparinux can prevent thrombotic complications following 
superficial vein thrombosis (SVT). The cost-effectiveness of this treatment 
remains to be determined.
METHODS: We developed a decision-tree model comparing fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily 
for 45 days vs no treatment of SVT. It included all clinical events associated 
with SVT, its treatment, its complications, and all respective 
quality-adjustment factors. Data were mainly derived from the CALISTO study and 
the published literature. Measured outcomes comprised clinical events (VTE, 
major hemorrhage, death), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The analysis was conducted using 
a lifetime time horizon from a health-care system perspective. We performed 
one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate parameter 
uncertainty.
RESULTS: In 10,000 patients, we estimated that fondaparinux would prevent 123 
VTE events and two deaths. On a per-patient basis, the incremental QALY compared 
with no treatment was 0.04 (1 day) at an incremental cost of $1,734, resulting 
in an ICER of $500,000 per QALY. This result remained robust in the one-way 
sensitivity analyses, with an ICER remaining > $100,000 per QALY throughout all 
ranges. Based on probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probability that 
fondaparinux was cost-effective was 1% at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per 
QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Fondaparinux for 45 days does not appear to be cost-effective when 
treating patients with isolated SVT of the legs. A better value for money could 
be obtained in subgroups of patients with a higher incidence of VTE after SVT. 
Shorter durations of treatment should be further evaluated in future clinical 
studies.

PCP effector proteins inturned and fuzzy play nonredundant roles in the 
patterning but not convergent extension of mammalian neural tube.

Dynamics, Huck Institute of Life Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, 
University Park, Pennsylvania, USA.

PCP effector proteins Inturned (Intu) and Fuzzy (Fuz) play important roles in 
mammalian neural development and ciliogenesis, but the developmental defects in 
Intu and Fuz mutants are not the same as those with the complete loss of cilia. 
Furthermore, it remains unclear whether mouse Intu and Fuz play a role in 
convergent extension, a process regulated by PCP signaling. In the current 
study, we show that the functions of both Intu and Fuz in neural tube patterning 
are dependent on the presence of cilia. We further show that neither gene 
exhibits obvious genetic interaction with the core PCP regulator Vangl2 in 
convergent extension or patterning of the neural tube. Finally, we show in Intu; 
Fuz double mutants that the lack of convergent extension and more severe 
patterning defects in Intu and Fuz mutants does not result from a functional 
redundancy between these two proteins.

The extraction of SAR information from structurally diverse compound data sets 
is a challenging task. One of the focal points of systematic SAR analysis is the 
search for activity cliffs, that is, structurally similar compounds having large 
potency differences, from which SAR determinants can be deduced. The assessment 
of SAR information is usually based on pairwise similarity and potency 
comparisons of data set compounds. As a consequence, activity cliffs are mostly 
evaluated at a compound pair level. Here, we present an extension of the 
activity cliff concept by introducing "activity ridges" that are formed by 
overlapping "combinatorial" activity cliffs between participating compounds, 
giving rise to ridge-like structures in activity landscapes. Activity ridges are 
rich in SAR information. In a systematic analysis of 242 compound data sets, we 
have identified well-defined activity ridges in 71 different sets. In addition, 
an information-theoretic approach has been devised to characterize the 
structural composition of activity ridges. Taken together, our results show that 
activity ridges frequently occur in sets of active compounds and that different 
categories of ridges can be distinguished on the basis of their structural 
content. The computational identification of activity ridges provides access to 
compound subsets having high priority for SAR analysis.

OBJECTIVES: Although targeted screening of patients at high risk for human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the emergency department (ED) improves 
patient outcomes and may prevent HIV transmission, ED-based screening programs 
incur additional costs and have thus not been widely scaled up. The objective of 
this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ED-based targeted HIV 
screening as implemented in actual practice.
METHODS: This was a cost-utility analysis of a rapid HIV screening program in an 
urban ED. Physicians were encouraged to screen patients undergoing inpatient 
admission or who had HIV risk factors. The authors measured costs directly and 
estimated quality-adjusted life expectancy using chart review, literature 
assumptions, and mathematical modeling. Incremental cost utility was evaluated 
from a societal perspective using a lifetime time horizon.
RESULTS: From June 2008 through September 2009, a total of 3,766 HIV tests were 
ordered (235 tests per month), of which an estimated 2,406 (64%) represented 
screening in patients without HIV-related signs or symptoms. Nineteen (0.8%) 
patients were newly diagnosed through screening during the study period, of whom 
nine (47%) were eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) and maintained 
consistent outpatient follow-up. Estimated screening costs were $82,300 per 
year, or $45.53 per screening test, of which $28.01 (62%) was for program 
management. Targeted screening prevented an estimated 2.1 HIV transmission 
events over 16 months. Per patient screened, targeted screening saved $112 (95% 
uncertainty range [UR] = $20 to $225) and resulted in 2.71 quality-adjusted 
life-days gained (95% UR = 1.71 to 4.01). Cost-utility was most sensitive to the 
prevalence of undiagnosed HIV in the screened population.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted HIV screening, as implemented in an urban ED, is cost 
saving and increases quality-adjusted life expectancy.

Over a period of 6.5 years, we treated 19 patients, all of whom suffered from 
severe heart failure and various stages of chronic kidney disease, excluding 
those with end-stage kidney failure. Before peritoneal catheter implantation, 
all patients had ascites, dyspnea, orthopnea, and an ejection fraction ranging 
from 20 to 45%. Seven of them (7/19) were able to take care of themselves, 9/19 
needed assistance for their daily activities, and the remaining 3 were 
bedridden. All of them needed hospitalization 1 - 3 times/month during the year 
before the initiation of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). With 
peritoneal dialysis, daily ultrafiltrate volume ranged from 500 to 3,000 ml and, 
after an average of 2 months of peritoneal dialysis, body weight decreased 
significantly (74.7 ± 13 vs. 69.7 ± 10.2, p = 0.02). At the same time, diuresis 
improved significantly, and this allowed a reduction in the dose of diuretics. 
Dyspnea and orthopnea improved significantly in all patients. The patients' 
degree of self-care and ability to sleep lying flat improved significantly as 
the need for hospitalization declined. Before peritoneal dialysis, patients were 
hospitalized for 5 - 20 days/month for pulmonary edema or overhydration, whereas 
with peritoneal dialysis, nobody was hospitalized for these causes (chi2, p = 
0.0001). Ejection fraction also improved in all of them (28.6 ± 8.6 vs. 36.8 ± 
12.5%, p = 0.0001). Actual survival of our patients ranged from 6 to 86 months 
(mean ± SD = 24.6 ± 20.8). Actuarial survival was 68% at 1 year and 42% at 2 
years. During peritoneal dialysis we observed only two episodes of peritonitis. 
Four patients developed a severe episode of hypotension during implantation of 
the catheters from the sudden removal of 4 - 6 l of ascitic fluid. We conclude 
that peritoneal dialysis is a good method for the treatment of congestive heart 
failure because it increases the quality of life and life expectancy in patients 
with poor prognosis.

Mutant ubiquitin (UBB+1) associated with neurodegenerative disorders is 
hydrolyzed by ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3 (UCH-L3).

Mutant ubiquitin (UBB(+1)) accumulates in the hallmarks of tauopathies and 
polyglutamine diseases. We show that the deubiquitinating enzyme YUH1 of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its mouse and human ortholog UCH-L3 are able to 
hydrolyze the C-terminal extension of UBB(+1). This yields another dysfunctional 
ubiquitin molecule (UB(G76Y)) with biochemical properties similar to full length 
UBB(+1). UBB(+1) may be detected in post-mortem tissue due to impaired 
C-terminal truncation of UBB(+1). Although the level of UCH-L3 protein in 
several neurodegenerative diseases is unchanged, we show that in vitro oxidation 
of recombinant UCH-L3 impairs its deubiquitinating activity. We postulate that 
impaired UCH-L3 function may contribute to the accumulation of full length 
UBB(+1) in various pathologies.

A philosophic discussion is pertinent to all residents and practicing thoracic 
surgeons as they see retirement as just a continuum of their lives in the 
context of full engagement in life. In this article, the author extends the 
concept of engagement into a third dimension, one that includes autonomy, 
mastery, purpose, physical fitness, quality of life, life expectancy, personal 
finances, philanthropy, and a desire to be part of a national reckoning in the 
development of medicine in general and thoracic surgery in particular.

Life expectancy has greatly increased in the last century. In the last decades, 
cancer in the older people has become an increasingly common problem owing to 
the prolonged life-expectancy of the general population and to the improved 
management of common cancers. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the 
age-specific incidence ratios in patients with BC. Data were collected from 
hospital-based registries from 1988 to 2007. A total of 10,149 patients were 
assessed. The median age at diagnosis was 50 years. When compared to 
Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data, these values were found 
to be 11 years younger than American patients. Trends consist of the median ages 
of patients were increased during years (p<0.001). Along the years, especially 
in the last years, the ratios of cancer patients of older than 70 years were 
significantly increased among the BC patient populations. In conclusion, BC in 
older person has become an increasingly common problem in the last years.

The CP-MST, a malnutrition screening tool for institutionalized adult cerebral 
palsy patients.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Progress in management of cerebral palsy (CP) patients has 
helped to increase life expectancy, but has also revealed nutritional 
consequences of this disability. The aims of this study were to determine the 
prevalence of malnutrition in long-term-institutionalized adult patients with CP 
and to propose specific malnutrition screening tool.
METHODS: Practitioners at 15 specialized institutions hosting CP patients 
assessed their nutritional status and completed a binary questionnaire 
containing thirteen questions related to factors suspected of increasing 
malnutrition. Moderate malnutrition was defined as the following: loss of weight 
(%) ≥ 5 to <10 or BMI ≥ 16 to <18.5 or albuminemia (g/l) ≥ 30 to <35. Markers of 
malnutrition were identified by bivariate analysis (ANOVA and Chi-square). 
Stepwise factorial discriminant analysis was used to determine the best subset 
of parameters for use in computation of a screening score.
RESULTS: A total of 365 patients age 35.7 ± 9.0 years were identified. 
Malnutrition was severe in 25%, moderate in 33% and absent in 42% of cases. The 
four strongest factors associated with malnutrition were used to build a 
three-level malnutrition screening tool for CP adult patients (CP-MST) as 
follows: body weight < 40 kg (10 points), sitting position uncomfortable or 
impossible (4 points), partial or total help to feed (4 points) and suspicion of 
gastro-esophageal reflux (3 points), (P < 0.0001): A screening score higher than 
10 points indicated high risk with malnutrition probability of 90%, and detected 
37% of malnourished patients. Conversely, a score equal to 0 excluded severe 
malnutrition in 90% of cases.
CONCLUSION: In light of the fact that 58% of these patients were malnourished, 
the CP-MST would appear to be useful for detecting malnutrition, underlining the 
need for a multidisciplinary approach in CP patients.

Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis and multiple brain metastases from 
urothelial carcinoma.

Intramedullary spinal cord metastases (ISCM) are rare spinal cord neoplasms 
associated with severe neurological deterioration and poor life expectancy. 
However, their incidence is expected to increase as a result of advances in 
diagnostic techniques and longer survival of patients with cancer due to 
improvements in cancer therapy. Reports on ISCM from primary urothelial 
carcinoma are virtually non existent. We report a 74-year-old male patient with 
a significant history of a high-grade urothelial carcinoma who presented with 
progressive back pain and concomitant weakness, grade 3-4/5 proximally and 0-1/5 
distally, and distal hyperesthesia and hyperalgesia, particularly of the left 
lower limb. MRI revealed a contrast-enhancing intramedullary lesion at 
Th11/Th12. Laminectomies of Th11/Th12 and lesion resection were performed. 
Postoperative histopathological examinations confirmed the metastatic nature of 
the lesion. Subsequently the patient developed multiple brain metastases. 
Radiation therapy was refused by the patient. We conclude that ISCM are 
devastating complications of systemic cancer. Early and thorough diagnosis, as 
well as carefully considered and prompt therapy, is important for minimizing the 
patient's functional deficit, thus improving quality of life.

Health-related behaviors in adolescence establish trajectories of risk for 
obesity and chronic degenerative diseases, and they represent an important 
pathway through which socio-economic environments shape patterns of morbidity 
and mortality. Most behaviors that promote health involve making choices that 
may not pay off until the future, but the factors that predict an individual's 
investment in future health are not known. In this paper we consider whether 
expectations for the future in two domains relevant to adolescents in the 
U.S.-perceived chances of living to middle age and perceived chances of 
attending college-are associated with an individual's engagement in behaviors 
that protect health in the long run. We focus on adolescence as an important 
life stage during which habits formed may shape trajectories of disease risk 
later in life. We use data from a large, nationally representative sample of 
American youth (the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health) to 
predict levels of physical activity, fast food consumption, and cigarette 
smoking in young adulthood in relation to perceived life chances in adolescence, 
controlling for baseline health behaviors and a wide range of potentially 
confounding factors. We found that adolescents who rated their chances of 
attending college more highly exercised more frequently and smoked fewer 
cigarettes in young adulthood. Adolescents with higher expectations of living to 
age 35 smoked fewer cigarettes as young adults. Parental education was a 
significant predictor of perceived life chances, as well as health behaviors, 
but for each outcome the effects of perceived life chances were independent of, 
and often stronger than, parental education. Perceived life chances in 
adolescence may therefore play an important role in establishing individual 
trajectories of health, and in contributing to social gradients in population 
health.

Foundation, New Orleans, LA.

A number of advances have been made over the last decade in the systemic therapy 
of breast cancer, including 1) the introduction of the taxanes, paclitaxel and 
docetaxel, into the treatment regimes for both early and advanced breast cancer; 
2) a greater understanding of the use of high-dose chemotherapy, supplemented 
with stem cell rescue; 3) the development of newer parenteral and oral 
chemotherapeutic drugs; 4) the first biologic therapy for breast cancer; 5) the 
first demonstration of effective drug therapy to prevent the development of 
breast cancer; and 6) effective agents to palliate and/or prevent complications 
from bone metastasis. These and other developments are allowing both the 
extension of life and a better quality of life for those stricken with the 
breast cancer.

Personality and longevity: knowns, unknowns, and implications for public health 
and personalized medicine.

Making Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester Medical Center,

We review evidence for links between personality traits and longevity. We 
provide an overview of personality for health scientists, using the primary 
organizing framework used in the study of personality and longevity. We then 
review data on various aspects of personality linked to longevity. In general, 
there is good evidence that higher level of conscientiousness and lower levels 
of hostility and Type D or "distressed" personality are associated with greater 
longevity. Limited evidence suggests that extraversion, openness, perceived 
control, and low levels of emotional suppression may be associated with longer 
lifespan. Findings regarding neuroticism are mixed, supporting the notion that 
many component(s) of neuroticism detract from life expectancy, but some 
components at some levels may be healthy or protective. Overall, evidence 
suggests various personality traits are significant predictors of longevity and 
points to several promising directions for further study. We conclude by 
discussing the implications of these links for epidemiologic research and 
personalized medicine and lay out a translational research agenda for 
integrating the psychology of individual differences into public health and 
medicine.

Centenarians are the best example of extreme human longevity, and they represent 
a selected population in which the appearance of major age-related diseases, 
such as cancer, and cardiovascular diseases among others, has been consistently 
delayed or escaped. The study of the long-lived individual genetic profile has 
the purpose to possibly identify the genes and the allelic variations 
influencing extended life expectancy, hence considering them as biomarkers of 
age-related diseases onset and development. The present study shows no 
significant differences between allelic variations of ABO blood groups among a 
group of centenarians from Western Sicily.
