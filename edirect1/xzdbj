Sickle cell disease (SCD) afflicts millions of people worldwide but is referred 
to as an orphan disease in the United States. Over the past several decades, 
there has been an increasing understanding of the pathophysiology of SCD and its 
complications. While most individuals with SCD in resource-rich countries 
survive into adulthood, the life expectancy of patients with SCD remains 
substantially shorter than for the general African-American population. SCD can 
be cured using hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and possibly gene 
therapy, but these treatment approaches are not available to most patients, the 
majority of whom reside in low- and middle-income countries. Until relatively 
recently, only one drug, hydroxyurea, was approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration to ameliorate disease severity. Multiple other drugs 
(L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor) have recently been approved for the 
treatment of SCD, with several others at various stages of clinical testing. The 
availability of multiple agents to treat SCD raises questions related to the 
choice of appropriate drug therapy, combination of multiple agents, and 
affordability of recently approved products. The enthusiasm for new drug 
development provides opportunities to involve patients in low- and middle-income 
nations in the testing of potentially disease-modifying therapies and has the 
potential to contribute to capacity building in these environments. 
Demonstration that these agents, alone or in combination, can prevent or 
decrease end-organ damage would provide additional evidence for the role of drug 
therapies in improving outcomes in SCD.

Telomere length is a hallmark characteristic of ageing and age-related diseases. 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common cause of joint pain and physical 
disability in the elderly. Previous studies have revealed the role of telomere 
shortening in OA; however, the relationship between telomere length, muscle 
strength and physical performance in knee OA patients remains unknown. The aim 
of the present study was to investigate the association of telomere length and 
physical performance in patients with knee OA. A total of 202 patients with knee 
OA and 60 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The quality of life was 
assessed using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) 
index and Short Form Health Survey. The skeletal muscle mass was examined using 
bioelectrical impedance analysis, while the muscle strength was analyzed using 
hand grip force and isometric knee extension force. The physical performance of 
patients with knee OA was also investigated using gait speed, Timed up and go 
test (TUGT), Sit to stand test and 6-min walk test (6MWT). Blood leukocyte 
relative telomere length (RTL) was assessed using real time quantitative PCR. 
The mean blood leukocyte RTL in knee OA subjects was significantly lower 
compared with healthy controls (P<0.001). Knee OA patients with RTL values in 
the lowest quartile had a slow gait speed (P=0.006) and prolonged TUGT time 
(P=0.03). Multivariate regression analyses and multiple logistic regression 
analyses adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, body mass index, fat mass, 
skeletal muscle index and the total WOMAC demonstrated that gait speed, TUGT and 
6MWT were associated with longer RTL (P-trend<0.05). These findings suggested 
that poorer physical performance was associated with shorter RTL. Therefore, 
leukocyte telomere length and physical performance tests, especially gait speed, 
TUGT and 6MWT, could predict the health status and quality of life in patients 
with knee OA.

BACKGROUND: Preservation of sleep quality is a modifiable and treatable factor, 
which may enhance the patient's adherence to other supportive and palliative 
care procedures. The outcome of sleep disturbances in lung cancer patients 
before and after treatment aren't reported. The aim of this study was to 
investigate changes in sleep quality before and after chemotherapy in locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients.
METHODS: It was a prospective study including 64 patients with stage III or IV 
nonsmall-cell lung cancer. Patients answered the Tunisian dialectal version of 
the following questionnaires: PSQI and QLQ-C30 in order to evaluate, 
respectively, the sleep quality and the quality of life. The assessments took 
place before chemotherapy and then repeated after the chemotherapy course was 
over.
RESULTS: The mean age was 62.9 years. All patients were active smokers. Before 
chemotherapy, there were 10 patients (15%) with poor sleep quality. The most 
frequent complaints were daytime sleepiness (70%) and nocturnal arousals (100%). 
After chemotherapy, the mean PSQI score increased from 2.9 to 5.4, and 45% of 
all patients had poor sleep quality. Most frequent complaints were the extension 
of sleep latency (69%), daytime sleepiness (98%), and nocturnal arousals (100%). 
Predicting factors of sleep disturbance according to statistical univariate 
analysis were delayed diagnosis confirmation (p = 0.05), delayed treatment onset 
(p < 10-3), depressive mood (p = 0.001), and anxious mood (p = 0.001). 
Multivariate analysis had shown a significant and independent correlation 
between sleep quality and shortened diagnosis and treatment delays. 
Sociodemographic parameters, clinical parameters, and factors related to 
treatment procedure had no correlation with sleep quality.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the persistence and potential intensity 
worsening of sleep disturbances in advanced stage nonsmall-cell lung cancer 
patients. We, hereby, reported a statistical correlation between sleep quality 
and quality of life in our patients.

Administration, Office of Health Equity, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 
USA.

BACKGROUND: Despite having one of the highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per 
capita levels, United States (US) ranks lower in subjective well-being, 
including happiness and life satisfaction, compared with European countries. 
Studies of the impact of happiness and life satisfaction on life expectancy and 
mortality in the US are limited or non-existent. Using a national longitudinal 
dataset, we examined the association between levels of happiness/life 
satisfaction and US life expectancy and all-cause mortality.
METHODS: We analyzed the 2001 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) 
prospectively linked to 2001-2014 mortality records in the National Death Index 
(NDI) (N=30,377). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model survival 
time as a function of happiness, life satisfaction, and sociodemographic and 
behavioral covariates.
RESULTS: Life expectancies at age 18 among adults with high levels of happiness 
and life satisfaction were, respectively, 7.5 and 8.9 years higher compared to 
those with low levels of happiness and life satisfaction. In Cox models with 14 
years of mortality follow-up, all-cause mortality risk was 82% higher (hazard 
ratio [HR]=1.82; 95% CI=1.59,2.08) in adults with little or no happiness, 
controlling for age, and 36% higher (HR=1.36; 95% CI=1.17,1.57) in adults with 
little/no happiness, controlling for sociodemographic, behavioral and health 
characteristics, when compared with adults reporting happiness all of the time. 
Mortality risk was 107% higher (HR=2.07; 95% CI=1.80,2.38) in adults who were 
very dissatisfied with their life, controlling for age, and 39% higher (HR=1.39; 
95% CI=1.20,1.60) in adults who were very dissatisfied, controlling for all 
covariates, when compared with adults who were very satisfied.
CONCLUSIONS AND GLOBAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: Adults with higher happiness and 
life satisfaction levels had significantly higher life expectancy and lower 
all-cause mortality risks than those with lower happiness and satisfaction 
levels. These findings underscore the significance of addressing subjective 
well-being in the population as a strategy for reducing all-cause mortality.

Background Patient satisfaction is one of the key indicators of health care 
quality. We aim to identify patient's needs and expectations in a breast cancer 
clinic to provide patient-centered care and better overall satisfaction.  
Methods A 17-item survey was administered to 110 patients at a breast cancer 
clinic. The survey was designed after a thorough literature review and approved 
by an oncologist and a palliative care physician.  Results Self-reported 
knowledge about the disease was reported adequate by 90.9% of our patients yet 
only 55.45% of our patients could identify the stage of their cancer. More 
education was desired by 32.7% of patients including various treatment options 
(29%), common complications (24.5%), prognosis (26.3%) and risk factors (11.8%). 
The majority of our patients were having some form of cancer-related emotional 
stress and physical symptoms. The majority of our patients (57.27%) wanted their 
oncologist to address social/emotional issues and 25.45% felt the need for more 
focus on physical symptoms in their subsequent visits. End-of-life (EoL) care 
discussions were considered an integral component of overall care by 29% of our 
patients. Components of EoL care discussions that patients stated they could 
benefit from included prognosis (27.27%), life expectancy (29%), the treatment 
effect on the quality of life (22.7%), palliative care (9%), hospice (10.9%), 
advance directives (11.8%), and family involvement in medical decision-making 
(13.6%). There was a difference noted regarding their EoL care discussion based 
on the stage of cancer. Patients with early-stage disease wanted their 
oncologists to decide on the frequency of this discussion (72.7%). Patients with 
advanced disease wanted EoL care discussion to be done more frequently as 
initiated by them or their oncologist or if there's a change in the treatment 
plan.  Conclusions A discrepancy between self-reported and actual knowledge in 
breast cancer patients emphasizes the need for patient education. Most patients 
rely on their oncologists for their diagnosis-related emotional and social 
issues. Surprisingly, more than a quarter of our patients consider EoL care 
discussions important even though the majority of our patients were healthy and 
having stage I and II disease.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were: to develop a predictive model for 
hospital mortality and another for hospital re-admission, to identify the impact 
of antibiotic delay in the mortality rate and, to report the rate of 
inappropriate antibiotic therapy.
METHODS: A cohort and retrospective study was conducted at the HM Sanchinarro 
University Hospital during the period September 1st, 2012 to March 31th, 2013. 
The inclusion criteria were: age> 18 years, hospital admission from the ED with 
a diagnosis of bacterial infection. The exclusion criteria were: suspected viral 
infection, negative bacteriological cultures, life expectancy less than 6 
months, lack of clinical information, assistance exclusively by the trauma 
emergency department. Two logistic models were made (hospital mortality and 
hospital re-admission).
RESULTS: A total of 517 patients were included. The final mortality model (30 
deaths) include the following variables: respiratory rate (OR 1.12; IC95% 1.02; 
1.22), oxygen saturation (OR 0.92; IC95% 0.87; 0.98), creatinine (OR 2.33; IC95% 
1.62; 3.36), COPD (OR 3.02; IC95% 1.06; 8.21), cancer (OR 3.34; IC95% 1.07; 
9.98) and chemotherapy in the last 3 months (OR 4.83; IC95% 1.54; 16.41). The 
final model for hospital re-admission (28 re-admissions) include the following 
variables: hepatopathy (OR 5.51; IC95% 1.57; 16.88), GPT (OR 1.005; IC95% 1.003; 
1.008), history of stroke (OR 5.06; IC95% 1.04; 18.80) and arterial hypertension 
(OR 3.15; IC95% 1.38; 7.56). The antibiotic therapy delays not influenced the 
mortality or re-admission rate. In 24.3% the causative microorganism was 
identified and antibiotic treatment was inappropriate 19.6%.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospital mortality rate was 5.8% and readmission rate was 5.7%. 
Variables associated with mortality differ from those associated with 
re-admission. The delay in the antibiotic initiation was not associated with a 
deleterious effect. Antibiotic therapy was inadequate in almost 20% of patients.

INTRODUCCIÓN: Los objetivos del estudio fueron: identificar variables asociadas 
a mortalidad intrahospitalaria y reingreso hospitalario a 3 meses; identificar 
el impacto de la demora en el inicio de la antibioticoterapia en la mortalidad y 
reportar la tasa de antibioticoterapia inapropiada.
MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: Estudio observacional de cohortes retrospectivo realizado en 
el Hospital Universitario HM Sanchinarro en Madrid. Los criterios de inclusión 
fueron: edad> 18 años de edad, hospitalización desde urgencias durante el 
periodo 1 de septiembre 2012 al 31 de marzo del 2013 con diagnóstico de 
infección bacteriana. Los criterios de exclusión fueron: sospecha de infección 
viral y cultivos bacteriológicos negativos, expectativa de vida inferior a 6 
meses, falta de información clínica, asistencia exclusivamente por el servicio 
de urgencias traumatológicas. Se realizaron dos modelos logísticos (mortalidad y 
reingreso hospitalarios).
RESULTADOS: Se incluyeron 517 pacientes. Variables asociadas a mortalidad (30 
fallecidos): frecuencia respiratoria (OR 1,12; IC95% 1,02; 1,22), saturación de 
oxígeno (OR 0,92; IC95% 0,87; 0,98), creatinina (OR 2,33; IC95% 1,62; 3,36), 
EPOC (OR 3,02; IC95% 1,06; 8,21), cáncer OR 3,34; IC95% 1,07; 9,98) y 
quimioterapia en los últimos 3 meses (OR 4,83; IC95% 1,54; 16,41). Variables 
asociadas a reingreso hospitalario (28 fallecidos): hepatopatía, GPT, 
antecedente de ictus e hipertensión arterial. Ambos modelos se destacan por su 
elevada especificidad y capacidad discriminativa pero baja sensibilidad. La 
demora en el inicio de la antibioticoterapia no influyo en la mortalidad ni 
reingreso. En 56 pacientes se identificó el microorganismo causal y el 
tratamiento antibiótico fue inapropiado en 11.
CONCLUSIONES: Se registro un 5,8% de mortalidad hospitalaria y un 5,7% de 
reingresos. Las variables asociadas a la mortalidad intrahospitalaria difieren 
de las asociadas al reingreso. La demora en el inicio de la antibioticoterapia 
no se asoció a un efecto deletéreo. La antibioticoterapia inadecuada fue de casi 
el 20%.

BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) natural history remains poorly characterized, and 
new investigations are impossible as it would be unethical to follow up TB 
patients without treatment.
METHODS: We considered the reports identified in a previous systematic review of 
studies from the prechemotherapy era, and extracted detailed data on mortality 
over time. We used a Bayesian framework to estimate the rates of TB-induced 
mortality and self-cure. A hierarchical model was employed to allow estimates to 
vary by cohort. Inference was performed separately for smear-positive TB (SP-TB) 
and smear-negative TB (SN-TB).
RESULTS: We included 41 cohorts of SP-TB patients and 19 cohorts of pulmonary 
SN-TB patients in the analysis. The median estimates of the TB-specific 
mortality rates were 0.389 year-1 (95% credible interval [CrI], .335-.449) and 
0.025 year-1 (95% CrI, .017-.035) for SP-TB and SN-TB patients, respectively. 
The estimates for self-recovery rates were 0.231 year-1 (95% CrI, .177-.288) and 
0.130 year-1 (95% CrI, .073-.209) for SP-TB and SN-TB patients, respectively. 
These rates correspond to average durations of untreated TB of 1.57 years (95% 
CrI, 1.37-1.81) and 5.35 years (95% CrI, 3.42-8.23) for SP-TB and SN-TB, 
respectively, when assuming a non-TB-related mortality rate of 0.014 year-1 (ie, 
a 70-year life expectancy).
CONCLUSIONS: TB-specific mortality rates are around 15 times higher for SP-TB 
than for SN-TB patients. This difference was underestimated dramatically in 
previous TB modeling studies, raising concerns about the accuracy of the 
associated predictions. Despite being less infectious, SN-TB may be responsible 
for equivalent numbers of secondary infections as SP-TB due to its much longer 
duration.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive health expectancy estimates the proportion of the lifespan 
that is lived in good cognitive health at the population level. A number of 
cardiovascular diseases have been identified to be risk factors for cognitive 
decline and dementia including diabetes, stroke, heart diseases and 
hypertension. The aim of this study was to examine how these cardiovascular 
conditions relate to cognitive health expectancy.
METHODS: Longitudinal data were obtained from the US Health and Retirement 
Study. Multistate modelling was used to estimate total life expectancy (LE), 
cognitive impairment free life expectancy (CIFLE) and years spent with cognitive 
impairment (CILE) across self-reported diabetes, hypertension, heart problems 
and stroke. Individual and cumulative effects of multiple cardiovascular 
conditions were examined.
RESULTS: The presence of cardiovascular disease was associated with a 5- to 
9-year decrease in LE and 4- to 8-year decrease in CIFLE at age 55. The outcomes 
varied in a hierarchical fashion by cardiovascular condition. Relative to other 
conditions, individuals with stroke had the shortest LE and CIFLE. Analysis of 
multiple cardiovascular risk factors revealed that each additional 
cardiovascular condition was associated with an exponential decrease in LE and 
CIFLE.
CONCLUSIONS: Having a cardiovascular condition is associated with a lower CIFLE 
and higher proportion of life lived with cognitive impairment. However, the 
outcomes vary depending on the type of cardiovascular condition. Reducing 
incidence of stroke and minimising exposure to multiple cardiovascular risk 
factors may be beneficial in helping to improve population estimates of 
cognitive health expectancy.

BACKGROUND: For intensive care patients with limited life expectancy the 
integration of palliative care in intensive care may be beneficial. However, 
little is known about the extent of this interdisciplinary collaboration.
OBJECTIVES: The support given by palliative medicine in German oncological 
centers and used by the intensive care units should be recorded.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive survey was conducted in all of the 
16 Comprehensive Cancer Centers (CCC) funded by German Cancer Aid. The 
questionnaires were sent to the head of department of the CCCs' specialized 
palliative care teams. Data were collected for the year 2016. Quantitative data 
were analysed to establish frequencies, given as mean and median. A qualitative 
section asked for trigger factors, i.e., patient characteristics triggering 
a palliative care consultation. Evaluation was inductively carried out by 
content analysis according to Mayring.
RESULTS: Data from 15 of the 16 CCCs (94%) were obtained between July and August 
2017. In 2016, the median of intensive care patients with palliative care 
consultations was 33 (minimum 0, maximum 100). The median of nine patients were 
transferred from an intensive care unit to a palliative care unit (minimum 1, 
maximum 30). Multidisciplinary ward rounds by both intensive and palliative care 
staff were available in two CCCs on a regular basis. Two CCCs implemented 
screening tools to integrate specialized palliative care into intensive care. 
From 23 responses concerning triggers, three categories were established, i.e., 
"team's decision and attitude", "patient's condition" and "desires of patients 
and relatives".
CONCLUSIONS: Palliative care is available in German CCCs. However, the degree of 
integration of specialized palliative care into intensive care units is low. 
Screening tools are available to identify patients with complex needs and to 
trigger a palliative care consultation. These tools, as well as joint ward 
rounds of intensive and palliative care staff, can improve the quality of 
patient centred care.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Die interdisziplinäre Zusammenarbeit 
zwischen Intensivmedizin und Palliativmedizin kann die Versorgungsqualität 
verbessern. Das Ausmaß dieser Zusammenarbeit ist aber bisher kaum untersucht.
ZIEL DER ARBEIT: Es sollten die angebotenen und in Anspruch genommenen 
palliativmedizinischen Unterstützungsangebote auf den Intensivstationen 
deutscher onkologischer Spitzenzentren erfasst werden.
MATERIAL UND METHODEN: Durchgeführt wurde eine quantitativ-qualitative, 
deskriptive Umfrage an den 16 von der Stiftung Deutsche Krebshilfe geförderten 
Zentren. Die im quantitativen Teil erfragten Häufigkeiten werden als Mittelwert 
und Median mit den jeweiligen Streumaßen dargestellt, während die im 
qualitativen Teil erhobenen Triggerfaktoren mit einer Inhaltsanalyse nach 
Mayring ausgewertet wurden.
ERGEBNISSE: Von Juli bis August 2017 konnten Angaben aus 15 von 16 onkologischen 
Spitzenzentren (94 %) erfasst werden. Im Jahr 2016 wurden im Median 
33 Intensivpatienten (Min. 0, Max. 100) palliativmedizinisch vorgestellt und 
9 Patienten (Min. 1, Max. 30) auf eine Palliativstation verlegt. Regelmäßige 
intensivmedizinisch-palliativmedizinische Visiten sowie ein Screening-Tool zur 
Einbindung der spezialisierten Palliativmedizin sind an zwei onkologischen 
Spitzenzentren implementiert. Anhand von 23 genannten Triggern, die auf der 
Intensivstation eine palliativmedizinische Mitbehandlung ausgelöst haben, lassen 
sich nach qualitativer Analyse die drei Kategorien „Entscheidung und Einstellung 
des Teams“, „Zustand des Patienten“ und „Wunsch von Patienten und Angehörigen“ 
ableiten.
DISKUSSION: Trotz eines verfügbaren Angebots werden palliativmedizinische 
Ressourcen in den intensivmedizinischen Abteilungen der onkologischen 
Spitzenzentren immer noch selten genutzt. In die tägliche Routine integrierte 
Angebote wie Screening-Tools oder gemeinsame Visiten könnten die Ausnutzung der 
angebotenen palliativmedizinischen Ressourcen erhöhen und die 
Versorgungsqualität verbessern.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders 
that manifest various motor and nonmotor symptoms. Although currently available 
therapies can alleviate some of the symptoms, the disease continues to progress, 
leading eventually to severe motor and cognitive decline and reduced life 
expectancy. The past two decades have witnessed rapid progress in our 
understanding of the molecular and genetic pathogenesis of the disease, paving 
the way for the development of new therapeutic approaches to arrest or delay the 
neurodegenerative process. As a result of these advances, biomarker-driven 
subtyping is making it possible to stratify PD patients into more homogeneous 
subgroups that may better respond to potential genetic-molecular pathway 
targeted disease-modifying therapies. Therapeutic nucleic acid oligomers can 
bind to target gene sequences with very high specificity in a base-pairing 
manner and precisely modulate downstream molecular events. Recently, nucleic 
acid therapeutics have proven effective in the treatment of a number of severe 
neurological and neuromuscular disorders, drawing increasing attention to the 
possibility of developing novel molecular therapies for PD. In this review, we 
update the molecular pathogenesis of PD and discuss progress in the use of 
antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs, short hairpin RNAs, 
aptamers, and microRNA-based therapeutics to target critical elements in the 
pathogenesis of PD that could have the potential to modify disease progression. 
In addition, recent advances in the delivery of nucleic acid compounds across 
the blood-brain barrier and challenges facing PD clinical trials are also 
reviewed.

Characidium iaquira, a new species from the upper rio Juruena, rio Tapajós 
basin, Brazil, is described. The new species can be promptly distinguished from 
all congeners by having a unique v-shaped dark mark lying along the caudal-fin 
extension, in medium- and large-sized specimens, and a remarkable iridescent 
green colouration in life. Characidium iaquira is closely related to Characidium 
crandellii and Characidium declivirostre by sharing unambiguous synapomorphies 
such as branchiostegal membranes united to each other across the isthmus, a 
scaleless area extending from the isthmus to the pectoral girdle, and dermal 
flaps surrounding anterior and posterior naris independent, but touching each 
other distally. Morphological specializations of the paired fins in the three 
riffle-dwellers species are discussed, including the wing-like shape, 
robustness, and inclination of the pectoral fin.

PURPOSE: Electrochemotherapy is increasingly entering into national and 
international guidelines, requiring formal evaluation of treatment costs and 
cost-effectiveness to ensure that its uptake provides value to 
budget-constrained health care systems. This study analyzed the early 
cost-effectiveness of electrochemotherapy in patients with Stage IIIc/IV skin 
melanoma in clinical practice in Slovenia. The costs of electrochemotherapy were 
compared to those of the standard of care, consisting of palliative treatment 
and therapy for symptoms.
METHODS: wThe study enrolled 23 patients treated with electrochemotherapy at the 
Institute of Oncology (Ljubljana, Slovenia). The mean cost of 
electrochemotherapy was estimated using patient-specific cost data on 
electrochemotherapy procedures and subsequent follow-up. Quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) were estimated by collecting EQ-5D-3L questionnaires at 
baseline, after complete or partial response following the treatment, and after 
a relapse of skin lesions. A discrete-time Markov model was built to estimate 
the lifetime costs and consequences of using electrochemotherapy compared to 
standard of care, from the perspective of the Slovenian health care system. The 
analysis was conducted separately in the whole patient sample and in the subset 
of patients with bleeding lesions. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to test model assumptions and to characterize the 
uncertainty around model parameters.
FINDINGS: In the whole patient population, electrochemotherapy for skin melanoma 
Stage IIIc/IV was expected to increase QALYs by 0.29 (95% credible interval 
[CrI], 0.10-0.50), at the higher cost of 6568 EUR (95% CrI, 4593-8928) in 
comparison to the standard of care. At the cost-effectiveness threshold of 
20,000 EUR/QALY, the estimated probabilities of electrochemotherapy being 
cost-effective compared to standard of care were 0.30 and 0.91 in the whole 
patient sample and in patients with bleeding lesions, respectively. In the whole 
sample population, a 50% reduction in the price of the electrodes was expected 
to increase the probability of electrochemotherapy being cost-effective from 
0.30 to ~0.64.
IMPLICATIONS: The findings from this cost-effectiveness analysis of data from 
clinical practice were based on a small sample size (ie, 23 patents), which made 
the subgroup of patients with bleeding lesions very small. Therefore, the 
findings in this patient population should be carefully interpreted.

Despite some approvals of antibody-drug conjugates for cancer therapy, their 
clinical success rate is unsatisfactory because of very small therapeutic 
windows, influenced by on-target and off-target toxicities of conjugate and 
liberated toxin. Additional formats with systematically investigated molecular 
parameters must therefore be explored to increase their therapeutic window. Here 
we focused on the effective molecular weight. To generate conjugates with 
exactly defined drug loads and tunable pharmacokinetics, we used Designed 
Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins), fused to unstructured polypeptides of 
different lengths, to produce proteins with any desired half-life, to identify 
those with the best efficacy. We generated an EpCAM-targeting DARPin-MMAF 
conjugate, fused to PAS or XTEN of different lengths, and a matched series of 
controls of a non-binding DARPin to account for the enhanced permeability and 
retention (EPR) effect, covering half-lives of minutes to 20.6 h in mice. All 
conjugates were produced at high purity, and demonstrated high specificity and 
cytotoxicity in human tumor cell cultures, with IC50 values in the low nM range, 
independent of the polypeptide type and length. Due to their more facile 
purification, the PASylated conjugates were tested in nude mice bearing HT29 
tumor xenografts. Independent of their size, all PASylated conjugates were very 
well tolerated after repeated systemic administration of 300 nmol/kg. We found 
that the conjugates with intermediate size and half-life showed the strongest 
anti-tumor effects, and deduced that this effect is a compromise of serum 
half-life and diffusion within the tumor, as on-rates and affinities are 
essentially identical, with extravasation playing only a very minor role.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint degenerative disease leading to 
irreversible structural and functional changes in the joint and is a major cause 
of disability and reduced life expectancy in ageing population. Despite the high 
prevalence of OA, there is no disease modifying drug available for the 
management of OA. Oxidative stress, a result of an imbalance between the 
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their clearance by antioxidant 
defense system, is high in OA cartilage and is a major cause of chronic 
inflammation. Inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are highly upregulated in OA 
joints and induce ROS production and expression of matrix degrading proteases 
leading to cartilage extracellular matrix degradation and joint dysfunction. ROS 
and inflammation are interdependent, each being the target of other and 
represent ideal target/s for the treatment of OA. Plant polyphenols possess 
potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and can inhibit ROS 
production and inflammation in chondrocytes, cartilage explants and in animal 
models of OA. The aim of this review is to discuss the chondroprotective effects 
of polyphenols and modulation of different molecular pathways associated with OA 
pathogenesis and limitations and future prospects of polyphenols in OA 
treatment.

Use of medications of questionable benefit is common in end of life care. In 
order to effectively carry out deprescribing, it is important to gain insight 
into the perspectives of patients and their relatives. Thus, our objective was 
to explore perspectives on deprescribing among older adults with limited life 
expectancy and their relatives. We conducted semi-structured interviews with ten 
nursing home residents and nine relatives. Interviews were analysed using 
systematic text condensation. Four main themes were identified: "Medication as a 
necessity and to feel well," "Frailty as a barrier for taking responsibility," 
"Patient autonomy and faith in authority" and "A wish for being involved." Most 
participants had not considered the possibility of deprescribing but were open 
towards medication change if proposed by a healthcare professional. Most 
participants did not have in-depth knowledge about medication but would like to 
be informed or involved in decisions. The participants generally had faith in 
healthcare professionals despite limited contact. Our study implies that older 
adults with limited life expectancy and their relatives are generally interested 
in deprescribing activities; however, the initiative of deprescribing lies with 
the healthcare professionals.

BACKGROUND: Fear of childbirth is a common health concern for women during 
pregnancy. The Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ) is 
widely used to measure childbirth fear during pregnancy. However, this 
instrument is yet to be validated in Malawi, Africa. Our study aimed to assess 
the psychometric properties of the W-DEQ questionnaire in Malawi.
METHODS: Healthy pregnant women in the third trimester (N = 476) at a district 
hospital in Malawi were included. Fear of childbirth, depressive symptoms, and 
quality of life were assessed using the W-DEQ, the Edinburg Postnatal Depression 
Scale, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life scale, respectively. 
The construct validity, reliability, and convergent validity of the W-DEQ were 
examined using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, Cronbach's alpha, 
and Pearson correlations.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 28.2 (standard deviation = 6.8) years. 
Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of the Malawian version of the 
W-DEQ indicated a multidimensional structure with three factors: fear, negative 
appraisal, and a lack of self-efficacy, with acceptable goodness of model fit. 
The Malawian version of the W-DEQ showed a satisfactory internal consistency 
(α = 0.84) and was significantly correlated with depressive symptoms (r = 0.23, 
p < 0.001) and quality of life (r = - 0.17 ~ -0.26, ps < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the Malawian W-DEQ version being a reliable 
and valid instrument for measuring childbirth fear in African women.

There is a well-established relationship between temperature and mortality, with 
older individuals being most at risk in high-income settings. This raises the 
question of the degree to which lives are being shortened by exposure to heat or 
cold. Years of life lost (YLL) take into account population life expectancy and 
age at which mortality occurs. However, YLL are rarely used as an outcome-metric 
in studies of temperature-related mortality. This represents an important gap in 
knowledge; to better comprehend potential impacts of temperature in the context 
of climate change and an ageing population, it is important to understand the 
relationship between temperature and YLL, and also whether the risks of 
temperature related mortality and YLL have changed over recent years. Gridded 
temperature data derived from observations, and mortality data were provided by 
the UK Met Office and the Office for National Statistics (ONS), respectively. We 
derived YLL for each death using sex-specific yearly life expectancy from ONS 
English-national lifetables. We undertook an ecological time-series regression 
analysis, using a distributed-lag double-threshold model, to estimate the 
relationship between daily mean temperature and daily YLL and mortality between 
1996 and 2013 in Greater London, the West Midlands including Birmingham, and 
Greater Manchester. Temperature-thresholds, as determined by model best fit, 
were set at the 91st (for heat-effects) and 35th (for cold-effects) percentiles 
of the mean temperature distribution. Secondly, we analysed whether there had 
been any changes in heat and cold related risk of YLL and mortality over time. 
Heat-effects (lag 0-2 days) were greatest in London, where for each 1 °C above 
the heat-threshold the risk of mortality increased by 3.9% (CI 3.5%, 4.3%) and 
YLL increased by 3.0% (2.5%, 3.5%). Between 1996 and 2013, the proportion of 
total deaths and YLL attributable to heat in London were 0.50% and 0.40% 
respectively. Cold-effects (lag 0-27 days) were greatest in the West Midlands, 
where for each 1 °C below the cold-threshold, risk of mortality increased by 
3.1% (2.4%, 3.7%) and YLL also increased by 3.1% (2.2%, 3.9%). The proportion of 
deaths and YLL attributable to cold in the West Midlands were 3.3% and 3.2% 
respectively. We found no evidence of decreasing susceptibility to heat and cold 
over time. The addition of life expectancy information into calculations of 
temperature-related risk and mortality burdens for English cities is novel. We 
demonstrate that although older individuals are at greatest risk of 
temperature-related mortality, heat and cold still make a significant 
contribution to the YLL due to premature death.
