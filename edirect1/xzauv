Until the 2000s Testosterone (T) Replacement Therapy (TRT) wasn't very 
satisfactory for male hypogonadic patients because the available T formulations 
weren't able to reproduce the physiological pattern of T secretion in man. In 
fact, oral formulations (oral undecanoate T) showed very short half-life (<24 
hours), requiring the administration of several daily doses, whereas the old 
injection products (T esters) were characterized by very long half-life (>7 
days) because of their adipose tissue storage, requiring to be administered 
every 2-3 weeks but determining remarkable and quick fluctuations (in 2-3 weeks) 
of the testosteronemia with variations in a few days from over-physiological 
levels (> 2000 ng/dl) to very low levels (< 200 ng/dl). Nowadays, several 
compounds can attain the standards of suitability and effectiveness of TRT in 
hypogonadal men. Both transcutaneous (gel) T and long-acting injectable 
formulations are the most modern preparations that can satisfy the criteria of 
an ideal chronic replacement therapy. In fact, they keep the serum T levels in 
the physiological range imitating its circadian rhythm, leading to the 
development and/or the preservation of male sexual characteristics and, finally, 
positively influencing bone mass, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue 
distribution. In particular, the availability and use of long-acting injectable 
undecanoate T can really improve the patients' compliance as requested for a 
life-long treatment. However, definitive and conclusive evidence regarding the 
main end-points, such as the diminished recurrence of falls in elderly men, the 
decrease in fractures in osteoporotic subjects, the reduction in disabling 
conditions and the extension of life, have not been reached so far. Therefore, 
the aim of this review is to sum up the most important evidence that has been 
collected regarding TRT, highlighting in particular those concerning both 
transcutaneous and long-acting injectable T compounds.

States.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate lifetime medical expenditures that can 
be attributed to hypertension, by gender, in the United States, given important 
gender differences in both survival and medical expenditures.
METHODS: We estimated lifetime medical expenditures among hypertensive and 
nonhypertensive men and women aged 20 and older. Expenditures were estimated 
from the 2001 to 2004 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and life expectancies 
were estimated from the 1986 to 2002 National Health Interview Survey Linked 
Mortality Files. Assuming that medical technology, the cost of health care 
services, the incidence of disease, and survival were fixed, the cross-sectional 
age-specific expenditures and the survival profiles were used to estimate the 
lifetime expenditures from ages 20 to older than 85.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The estimated lifetime expenditure for an average life table 
individual at age 20 was $188,300 for hypertensive men and $254,910 for 
hypertensive women; however, a greater share of lifetime expenditures can be 
attributed to hypertension among men ($88,033) than among women ($40,960).
CONCLUSION: Although hypertensive women had greater lifetime expenditures than 
hypertensive men, hypertension was associated with a greater increase in 
lifetime expenditures for men than for women. Gender differences in both 
survival and health care utilization have important implications for gender 
differences in lifetime medical expenditures.

OBJECTIVE: To undertake a cost effectiveness analysis comparing first and second 
generation endometrial ablative techniques, hysterectomy, and the levonorgestrel 
releasing intrauterine system (Mirena) for treating heavy menstrual bleeding.
DESIGN: Model based economic evaluation with data from an individual patient 
data meta-analysis supplemented with cost and outcome data from published 
sources taking an NHS (National Health Service) perspective. A state transition 
(Markov) model was developed, the structure being informed by the reviews of the 
trials and clinical input. A subgroup analysis, one way sensitivity analysis, 
and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were also carried out.
POPULATION: Four hypothetical cohorts of women with heavy menstrual bleeding.
INTERVENTIONS: One of four alternative strategies: Mirena, first or second 
generation endometrial ablation techniques, or hysterectomy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost effectiveness based on incremental cost per quality 
adjusted life year (QALY).
RESULTS: Hysterectomy is the preferred strategy for the first intervention for 
heavy menstrual bleeding. Although hysterectomy is more expensive, it produces 
more QALYs relative to other remaining strategies and is likely to be considered 
cost effective. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for hysterectomy 
compared with Mirena is £1440 (€1633, $2350) per additional QALY. The 
incremental cost effectiveness ratio for hysterectomy compared with second 
generation ablation is £970 per additional QALY.
CONCLUSION: In light of the acceptable thresholds used by the National Institute 
for Health and Clinical Excellence, hysterectomy would be considered the 
preferred strategy for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding. The results 
concur with those of other studies but are highly sensitive to utility values 
used in the analysis.

Pennsylvania 19107, USA. niyatichiniwala@gmail.com

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Description of management of diabetes in elderly.
RECENT FINDINGS: Population of older adults is growing and so is the prevalence 
of diabetes in elderly individuals. Older adults are a heterogeneous group of 
individuals with varying physical capabilities, cognitive functioning and 
co-morbidities and life expectancies. Also, older adults with diabetes are at 
increased risk for some geriatric conditions. Thus, clinicians taking care of 
elderly with diabetes must take this into consideration and prioritize treatment 
accordingly.
SUMMARY: Goals of diabetes care in elderly and younger adults are alike, though 
managing diabetes in elderly requires individualized approach. Fit elderly with 
life expectancy over 10 years should have HbA1c target similar to younger 
adults, whereas in frail elderly with multiple co-morbidities, the goal should 
somewhat be higher. Pharmacological treatment options are similar to younger 
adults and avoidance of hypoglycemia is an important consideration in choosing 
therapeutic agents in elderly. Evaluation and treatment of microvascular and 
macrovascular complications of diabetes in elderly must also be individualized.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to estimate the impact of comorbidity acquired before HIV 
diagnosis on mortality in individuals infected with HIV.
METHODS: This cohort study compared 2 different cohorts. The prospective 
population-based nationwide observational Danish HIV Cohort Study was used to 
compare all adults diagnosed with HIV in Denmark from 1997 with a matched 
general population cohort. Comorbidity history was ascertained from the Danish 
National Patient Registry and vital statistics obtained from the Danish Civil 
Registration System. Cox regression was used to estimate the impact of Charlson 
comorbidity index (CCI) and hepatitis C virus coinfection on mortality, and 
population attributable risk was used to assess the proportional impact of 
comorbidity on mortality.
RESULTS: CCI comorbidity was present before HIV diagnosis in 11.3% of 1638 
persons with HIV, and in 8.0% of 156,506 persons in the general population. The 
risk for death in patients with HIV with at least 1 CCI point was 1.84 times 
higher than in those with no CCI points (adjusted mortality rate ratio, 95% 
confidence interval: 1.32 to 2.57). The annual risk of dying for patients with 
HIV vs general population with 0, 1, 2, and 3+ CCI points was 1.70% (1.44 to 
2.00) vs 0.27% (0.26 to 0.28), 4.37% (3.01 to 6.32) vs 1.36% (1.26 to 1.47), 
8.06% (4.94 to 13.16) vs 2.44% (2.22 to 2.68), and 10.15% (5.08 to 20.30) vs 
5.84% (5.19 to 6.58), respectively. Comorbidity acquired before HIV, hepatitis C 
virus coinfection, and background mortality accounted for 45% of total mortality 
in the population infected with HIV.
CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of deaths in persons diagnosed with HIV in a health 
care setting with free access to highly active antiretroviral therapy stemmed 
from factors unrelated to HIV disease.

BACKGROUND: Fragility fractures are a major health care problem worldwide. The 
proportion of the geriatric population and the overall life expectancy will 
increase. Hip fractures are the most common fragility fractures needing surgery 
and nowadays treatment concepts are changing. We studied the long-term 
functional outcome and their influencing factors in patients treated without any 
interdisciplinary aspects.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective cohort study with functional long-term 
follow-up examination was carried out in a level one trauma centre on hip 
fracture patients 80 years old and above treated without any formalized 
interdisciplinary aspects ("usual care").
PATIENTS: Of 281 consecutive patients who were treated 2005 and 2006 with usual 
care, 246 patients with a mean age of 86.8 years met our inclusion criteria. 
69.1% died within the study period of 4.9 years. On the remaining patients, the 
residential status, the Barthel Index and the Parker Score were assessed.
RESULTS: The mean Barthel Index was 49.6 and the mean Parker Score was 2.7. More 
than one-fourth of the survivors were found to be bedridden and 45% were not 
able to walk outside. 88% are bound to one floor and only 8% are able to walk 
unaided. Patients with more comorbidities and patients with subsequent fractures 
had significant higher mortality rates. Patients with trochanteric fractures had 
significant better functional outcome scores compared to patients with femoral 
neck fractures. Nursing home residents showed significant higher mortality rates 
and lower functional outcome scores. Patients who were transferred to a nearby 
acute geriatric hospital for further treatment had significantly higher 
functional outcome scores.
CONCLUSION: This paper shows the frustrating long-term outcome of geriatric hip 
fracture patients but it also suggests that an early geriatric intervention may 
lead to better function.

PURPOSE: To understand the functional and psychosocial aspects of strabismus 
surgery, an evaluation based on the patient's perspective is essential. In this 
study, we assessed quality of life and utility in adult patients who had 
undergone strabismus surgery, and we modeled the cost of providing this 
intervention in order to calculate the cost-utility of strabismus surgery in 
adults.
METHODS: The study population comprised 226 patients with strabismus aged 18 
years or older who were scheduled for ocular alignment surgery at 12 facilities 
of the Strabismus Surgery Study Group in Japan. Survey questionnaires consisting 
of the Japanese versions of the Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (VFQ-25) and 
8-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) and utility assessment by a time 
trade-off method were administrated preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. 
On the basis of the cost model and measured utility data, the gains in 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and $/QALY were estimated.
RESULTS: Postoperatively, the subscale scores of the VFQ-25 and the physical and 
mental component summary scores of the SF-8 showed a statistically significant 
improvement. A significant improvement of utility was also noted: 0.82 ± 0.28 
postoperatively versus 0.76 ± 0.31 preoperatively. On the basis of the life 
expectancy of these patients and the cost model, the surgery resulted in a mean 
value gain of 0.99 QALYs and a cost-utility for strabismus surgery of 1,303 
$/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: By using standard tools to assess vision-associated and general 
health status, we confirmed the psychosocial benefits of corrective surgery for 
adults with strabismus. Our study concurrently demonstrated that strabismus 
surgery in adults is very cost-effective.

An economic evaluation of positron emission tomography (PET) and positron 
emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the diagnosis of breast 
cancer recurrence.

Collaboration, School of Health and Population Science, University of 
Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.

OBJECTIVES: To review the published economic studies that have evaluated 
positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in the treatment of 
recurrent breast cancer, and to develop and carry out a model-based economic 
evaluation to investigate the relative cost-effectiveness of PET/CT to detect 
breast cancer recurrence compared with conventional work-up.
DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of economic and diagnostic evidence for PET/CT 
in diagnosis of breast cancer recurrence. The original databases searched 
include MEDLINE (Ovid) (1950 to week 5 May 2009), EMBASE (Ovid) (1980 to 2009 
week 22) and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database. An updated search was 
conducted for each database from May 2009 to week 4 April 2010.
METHODS: A decision tree was developed in TREEAGE software (TreeAge Software 
Inc., Williamstown, MA, USA). The relevant data on accuracy, sensitivity and 
specificity of each diagnostic test were linked in the model, to costs and the 
primary outcome measure, cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The model 
estimated the mean cost associated with each diagnostic procedure and assumed 
that patients entering the model were aged 50-75 years. The results of the 
cost-effectiveness analysis are presented in terms of the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
RESULTS: The ICER for the strategy of PET compared with conventional work-up was 
estimated at £29,300 per QALY; the ICER for PET/CT compared with PET was £ 
31,000 per QALY; and the ICER for PET/CT combined with conventional work-up 
versus PET/CT was £ 42,100. Clearly, for each additional diagnostic test that is 
added to PET, the more expensive the package becomes, but also the more 
effective it becomes in terms of QALYs gained. The probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis shows that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £ 20,000 per QALY, 
conventional work-up is the preferred option.
LIMITATIONS: Only data from indirect comparisons are available from the accuracy 
review, and there is some uncertainty about whether the data defining the 
accuracy of PET/CT present its use as a replacement or as an adjunct to 
conventional work-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current model and given the limitations that are 
apparent in terms of limited availability of data, the result of the current 
analysis suggests that the use of PET/CT in the diagnosis of recurrent breast 
cancer in every woman suspected of having a recurrence is unlikely to be 
cost-effective given the current willingness-to-pay thresholds that are accepted 
in the UK by decision-making bodies such as the National Institute for Health 
and Clinical Excellence. Our modelling suggests that conventional work-up could 
be the most cost-effective diagnostic strategy given current data. Future 
studies need to secure robust cost data that can be verified from more than one 
source for the diagnostic tests involved in PET and PET/CT. Reliable and 
verifiable data on quality of life associated with this clinical condition are 
also crucial.

The protective effect of marriage for survival: a review and update.

Rendall MS(1), Weden MM, Favreault MM, Waldron H.

(1)RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA 90407-2138, USA. mrendall@rand.org

The theory that marriage has protective effects for survival has itself lived 
for more than 100 years since Durkheim's groundbreaking study of suicide 
(Durkheim 1951 [1897]). Investigations of differences in this protective effect 
by gender, by age, and in contrast to different unmarried statuses, however, 
have yielded inconsistent conclusions. These investigations typically either use 
data in which marital status and other covariates are observed in 
cross-sectional surveys up to 10 years before mortality exposure, or use data 
from panel surveys with much smaller sample sizes. Their conclusions are usually 
not based on formal statistical tests of contrasts between men and women or 
between never-married, divorced/separated, and widowed statuses. Using 
large-scale pooled panel survey data linked to death registrations and earnings 
histories for U.S. men and women aged 25 and older, and with appropriate 
contrast tests, we find a consistent survival advantage for married over 
unmarried men and women, and an additional survival "premium" for married men. 
We find little evidence of mortality differences between never-married, 
divorced/separated, and widowed statuses.

Economic burden of depression in South Korea.

Chang SM(1), Hong JP, Cho MJ.

Author information:
(1)Department of Psychiatry, Kyungpook National University Hospital and School 
of Medicine, Daegu, South Korea.

BACKGROUND: A recent national survey in South Korea indicated that the 12-month 
prevalence rate of major depressive disorder was 2.5%. Depressive disorders may 
lead to disability, premature death, and severe suffering of patients and their 
families. This study estimates the economic burden of depression in Korea from a 
societal perspective.
METHODS: Annual direct healthcare costs associated with depression were 
calculated based on the National Health Insurance database. Annual direct 
non-healthcare costs were estimated for transport. Annual indirect costs were 
estimated for the following components of productivity loss due to illness such 
as morbidity (absenteeism and presenteeism) and premature mortality. Indirect 
costs were estimated using the large national psychiatric epidemiological 
surveys in Korea. The human capital approach was used to estimate indirect 
costs.
RESULT: The total cost of depression was estimated to be $4,049 million, of 
which $152.6 million represents a direct healthcare cost. Total direct 
non-healthcare costs were estimated to be $15.9 million. Indirect costs were 
estimated at $3,880.5 million. The morbidity cost was $2,958.9 million and the 
mortality cost was $921.6 million. The morbidity cost was identified as the 
largest component of overall cost.
CONCLUSION: Depression is a considerable burden on both society and the 
individual, especially in terms of incapacity to work. The Korean society should 
increase the public health effort to prevent and detect depression in order to 
ensure that appropriate treatment is provided. Such actions will lead to a 
significant reduction in the total burden resulting from depression.

The decline in ischaemic heart disease mortality in seven European countries: 
exploration of future trends.

Amiri M(1), Janssen F, Kunst AE.

Author information:
(1)Department of Public Health, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The 
Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: To assess the implication of a possible continuation of the decline 
in ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality in the future.
METHODS: Annual rates of decline in IHD mortality from 1980-2005 were determined 
for the national populations of the Netherlands, UK, France and four Nordic 
countries through regression analysis and used to extrapolate mortality rates 
until 2030. Through cause-elimination life tables we determined the impact of 
IHD on life expectancy at birth.
RESULTS: In all countries, IHD mortality rates among both sexes declined 
incessantly until 2005. Age-adjusted mortality rates would have declined by 
about 50% in 2030 compared to 2005 if past trends were to continue. The impact 
of IHD on life expectancy at birth would decline by about 25-50% in most 
populations. The absolute numbers of IHD deaths would decline slowly or even 
increase in some countries mainly because of population ageing.
CONCLUSIONS: If current IHD mortality trends continued, IHD would lose much of 
its importance as a cause of premature death in the near future. As the 
incidence and disabling impact of IHD might decline much less, prevention of 
IHD-related disability instead of mortality may become increasingly important in 
the future.

Weighting components of composite end points in clinical trials: an approach 
using disability-adjusted life-years.

Hong KS(1), Ali LK, Selco SL, Fonarow GC, Saver JL.

Author information:
(1)UCLA Stroke Center, 710 Westwood Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional analysis of vascular prevention trials 
assigns equal weight to disparate vascular events in a composite end point at 
variance with the public's perception of their differential impact on health 
outcome. This study sought to apply the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) 
metric to differential weighting individual vascular end points in trial 
analyses.
METHODS: DALY values for the most common major end points in vascular prevention 
trials (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and vascular death), 
were derived by using World Health Organization Global Burden of Disease Project 
methodology. The standardized DALYs for each event were applied to recent major 
primary and secondary vascular prevention trials and to hypothetical model 
trials.
RESULTS: Standardized DALYs lost were 7.63 for nonfatal stroke, 5.14 for 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, and 11.59 for vascular death. In the published 
trials analyses, the direction of treatment effects was consistent between DALY 
and standard event analysis, but the rank order of treatment effect changed for 
10 of 18 trials. The DALY analysis also permitted derivation of 
number-needed-to-treat values to gain 1 DALY: 2.1 for anticoagulation in atrial 
fibrillation, 2.7 for carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic stenosis, and 4.7 
for clopidogrel added to aspirin in acute coronary syndrome. Hypothetical trial 
analyses demonstrated that the DALY metric more finely discriminates treatment 
effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with a nonfatal myocardial infarction, a nonfatal stroke 
causes a 1.48-fold greater loss and vascular death a 2.25-fold greater loss of 
DALY. DALY analysis integrates these valuations in a summary metric reflecting 
the net impact of therapy on patient and societal health, complementing 
conventional end point analyses.

Cost-effectiveness of statins revisited: lessons learned about the value of 
innovation.

Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Klarabergsviadukten 
90 D, Stockholm, Sweden. peter.lindgren@innovus.com

BACKGROUND: The economic evaluation of statins has undergone a development from 
risk-factor-based models to modeling of hard end points in clinical trials with 
a shift back to risk-factor models after increased confidence in their 
predictive power has now been established. At this point, we can look back on 
the historical economic data on simvastatin to see what lesson regarding 
reimbursement we can learn.
METHODS: Historical data on the usage and sales of simvastatin in Sweden were 
combined with published epidemiological and clinical data to calculate the 
social value of simvastatin to the present day and to make projection until 
projected until 2018. The distribution of the social surplus was calculated by 
taking the costs born by society and the producer of the drug into 
consideration.
RESULTS: The cost of simvastatin fell drastically following patent expiration, 
although the number of treated patients has continued to grow. Presently, the 
use of simvastatin is close to cost neutrality taking direct and indirect cost 
savings from reduced morbidity into account. However, the major part of the 
social surplus generated comes from the value of improved quality-adjusted 
survival. Of the social surplus generated, the producer appropriated 20-43% of 
the value during the on-patent period, a figure dropping to 1% following loss of 
exclusivity. The total producer surplus between 1987 and 2018 is 2-5% of the 
total social surplus.
CONCLUSION: Only a small part of the surplus value generated was appropriated by 
the producer. A regulatory and reimbursement approach that favors early market 
access and coverage with evidence development as opposed to long-term trials as 
a pre-requisite for launch is more attractive from both a company and social 
perspective.

OBJECT: Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) for 
spondylolisthesis-associated back and leg pain is associated with improvement in 
pain, disability, and quality of life. However, given the rising health care 
costs associated with spinal fusion procedures and varying results of recent 
cost-utility studies, the cost-effectiveness of TLIF remains unclear. The 
authors set out to assess the comprehensive costs of TLIF at their institution 
and to determine its cost-effectiveness in the treatment of degenerative 
spondylolisthesis.
METHODS: Forty-five patients undergoing TLIF for Grade I degenerative 
spondylolisthesis-associated back and leg pain after 6-12 months of conservative 
therapy were included. The authors assessed the 2-year back pain visual analog 
scale (VAS) score, leg pain VAS score, Oswestry Disability Index, and total 
back-related medical resource utilization, missed work, and health-state values 
(quality-adjusted life years [QALYs], calculated from EQ-5D with US valuation). 
Two-year resource use was multiplied by unit costs based on Medicare national 
allowable payment amounts (direct cost), and patient and caregiver workday 
losses were multiplied by the self-reported gross-of-tax wage rate (indirect 
cost). The mean total 2-year cost per QALY gained after TLIF was assessed.
RESULTS: Compared with preoperative health states reported after at least 6 
months of medical management, a significant improvement in back pain VAS score, 
leg pain VAS score, and Oswestry Disability Index was observed 2 years after 
TLIF, with a mean 2-year gain of 0.86 QALYs. The mean ± SD total 2-year cost of 
TLIF was $36,836 ± $11,800 (surgery cost, $21,311 ± $2800; outpatient resource 
utilization cost, $3940 ± $2720; indirect cost, $11,584 ± $11,363). 
Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion was associated with a mean 2-year cost 
per QALY gained of $42,854.
CONCLUSIONS: Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion improved pain, disability, 
and quality of life in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis-associated 
back and leg pain. The total cost per QALY gained for TLIF was $42,854 when 
evaluated 2 years after surgery with Medicare fees, suggesting that TLIF is a 
cost-effective treatment of lumbar spondylolisthesis.

Development of physical disability in older adults.

Gainesville, FL 32611-0107, USA. tmanini@aging.ufl.edu

Demographers expect the number of older persons to double to 86.7 million - or 
to 20.6% of the US population - by the year 2050. As has occurred over the past 
decade, the health care costs associated with older age are expected to steadily 
increase approximately 2% per year causing both a public health and personal 
burden. A key component to reducing health care costs and maintaining well-being 
in older persons is preserving physical function throughout the lifespan. The 
challenge to this objective is to combat the origin of the loss of physical 
function through treatment of chronic disease conditions. Another approach is to 
enhance physical function despite the occurrence of comorbid conditions through 
enhancement of the neuromuscular system. The neuromuscular system provides the 
necessary components for all locomotion, and is thus a logical choice for 
preventative therapies to target. This article will give a general overview of 
the models and risk factors that explain the development of physical disability.

Influence of PEI as a core modifying agent on PLGA microspheres of PGE₁, a 
pulmonary selective vasodilator.

Gupta V(1), Ahsan F.

University Health Sciences Center, 1300 Coulter Drive, Amarillo, TX 79106, 
United States.

This study tests the hypothesis that large porous poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) 
(PLGA) microparticles modified with polyethyleneimine (PEI) are viable carriers 
for pulmonary delivery of prostaglandin E(1) (PGE(1)) used in the treatment of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a pulmonary vascular disorder. The 
particles were prepared by a double-emulsion solvent evaporation method with 
PEI-25 kDa in the internal aqueous phase to produce an osmotic pressure 
gradient. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was used for external coating of the 
particles. The particles were examined for morphology, size, aerodynamic 
diameter, surface area, pore volume and in-vitro release profiles. Particles 
with optimal properties for inhalation were tested for in-vivo pulmonary 
absorption, metabolic stability in rat lung homogenates, and acute toxicity in 
rat bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and respiratory epithelial cells, Calu-3. The 
micromeritic data indicated that the PEI-modified particles of PGE(1) are 
optimal for inhalation. Incorporation of PEI in the formulations resulted in an 
increased entrapment efficiency - 83.26 ± 3.04% for particles with 1% PVA and 
95.48 ± 0.46% for particles with 2% PVA. The amount of cumulative drug released 
into the simulated interstitial lung fluid was between 50.8 ± 0.76% and 55.36 ± 
0.06%. A remarkable extension of the circulation half-life up to 6.0-6.5h was 
observed when the formulations were administered via the lungs. The metabolic 
stability and toxicity studies showed that the optimized formulations were 
stable at physiological conditions and relatively safe to the lungs and 
respiratory epithelium. Overall, this study demonstrates that large porous 
inhalable polymeric microparticles can be a feasible option for non-invasive and 
controlled release of PGE(1) for treatment of PAH.

Association between life-span extension by caloric restriction and thiol redox 
state in two different strains of mice.

Rebrin I(1), Forster MJ, Sohal RS.

Author information:
(1)Department of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of 
Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.

The hypothesis that the life-extending effect of caloric restriction (CR) is 
associated with an attenuation of the age-related pro-oxidant shift in the thiol 
redox state was tested employing a novel experimental design. Amounts of GSH, 
GSSG, and protein mixed disulfides (Pr-SSG) in the skeletal muscle and liver 
were compared between two strains of mice that have similar life spans when fed 
ad libitum (AL), but different life spans under the standard CR regimen. The 
life span of one strain, C57BL/6, is extended under CR, whereas it remains 
unaffected in the other strain, DBA/2. Mice were fed AL or 40% less food 
starting at 4 months and compared at 6 and 24 months of age. The amounts of GSSG 
and Pr-SSG increased and the GSH:GSSG ratios decreased with age in both strains 
of AL-fed mice. CR prevented these age-related changes in the C57BL/6, whose 
life span is extended by CR, but not in the DBA/2 mice, in which it remains 
unaffected. CR enhanced the activity of glutamate-cysteine ligase in the 
C57BL/6, but not in the DBA/2 mice. The results suggest that longevity extension 
by CR may be associated with the attenuation of age-related pro-oxidizing shifts 
in the thiol redox state.

Measurement of health-related quality of life can play a major role in 
benefit-risk assessment. Preference-based methods for measuring quality of life 
where data are aggregated into a single quality of life index are particularly 
well suited for use in quantitative analysis. Using two examples from research 
on cancer and multiple sclerosis, this paper compares approaches in which 
quality of life data from genuine studies or from external sources is used. It 
will be demonstrated that quality of life data can provide relevant information 
for quantitative benefit-risk assessment in applied research. In addition, 
quality of life data may be included in more complex approaches of 
multi-criteria decision analysis.

BACKGROUND: Basilic vein transposition fistulas (BVTFs) and prosthetic bridge 
grafts (PBGs) provide good vascular access for hemodialysis. To evaluate the 
patency and complication rates after arteriovenous fistula formation, a 
concurrent series of patients was reviewed.
METHODS: Between September 2003 and September 2009, 147 hemodialysis access 
procedures were performed in 147 consecutive patients at Van Research and 
Training Hospital and Yuzuncu Yil University Hospital, Van, Turkey. All access 
procedures were planned on the basis of preoperative duplex scans of arm and 
forearm veins. Functional patency was defined as the ability to cannulate 
hemodialysis patients successfully. Primary and secondary cumulative functional 
patency rates of BVTFs and PBGs were determined with life-table analysis and 
differences were analyzed with retrospective study. Differences in revision 
rates, including thrombolysis thrombectomies and operative revisions, were 
analyzed with the Fisher exact t-test.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 15 months (range, 3-24 months). Risk factors were 
similar between the two groups. BVTFs had better patency at 15 months. The 
dialysis access complications were higher in the PBG group versus BVTF group, 
and the PBG group had a higher infection rate than the BVTF group.
CONCLUSION: The primary and secondary patency rates were superior in the BVTF 
group. Our data strongly support the contention that as long as the patient is a 
candidate for an upper arm BVTF based on anatomical criteria, BVTF always be 
considered before a PBG.

[Acute renal failure in the elderly].

[Article in French]

Acute renal failure in elderly patients is common and likely to become more so 
as life expectancy in France continues to grow. The chances of acute renal 
failure occurring in the elderly are increased by changes in renal function and 
the effects of various chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and 
obstructive urological disorders, all of which increase in incidence with age. 
The elderly may develop all types of the disease but are most prone to 
drug-related acute renal failure. The diagnostic and therapeutic strategies 
adopted are the same as those for adult patients but should take into account 
the potential risks and benefits in this specific age group. However, age should 
no longer be considered as the sole determining factor in diagnostic and 
therapeutic decisions. The elderly are among those who benefit most from 
preventive measures against acute renal failure.

for patients participating in phase I oncology trials.

BACKGROUND: High circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts are associated with poor 
prognosis in several cancers. Enrollment of patients on phase I oncology trials 
requires a careful assessment of the potential risks and benefits. Many patients 
enrolled on such trials using established eligibility criteria have a short life 
expectancy and are less likely to benefit from trial participation. We 
hypothesized that the incorporation of CTC counts might improve patient 
selection for phase I trials.
METHODS: This retrospective analysis evaluated patients who had baseline CTCs 
enumerated prior to their starting on a phase I trial. CTCs were enumerated 
using the CellSearch System.
RESULTS: Between January 2006 and December 2009 a total of 128 patients enrolled 
in phase I trials had CTC counts evaluated. Higher CTC counts as a continuous 
variable independently correlated with risk of death in this patient population 
(P = 0.006). A multivariate point-based risk model was generated using CTCs as a 
dichotomous variable (≥3 or <3), and incorporated other established prognostic 
factors, including albumin <35 g/L, lactate dehydrogenase greater than upper 
limit of normal, and >2 metastatic sites. Comparison of receiver operating 
characteristic curves demonstrated that the addition of baseline CTC counts 
improved the performance of the prospectively validated Royal Marsden Hospital 
phase I prognostic score, which now identifies three risk groups (P < 0.0001): 
good prognosis [score 0-1, median overall survival (OS) 63.7 weeks], 
intermediate prognosis (score 2-3, median OS 37.3 weeks), and poor prognosis 
(score 4, median OS 13.4 weeks).
CONCLUSION: CTC enumeration improved the performance of a validated prognostic 
score to help select patients for phase I oncology trials.

uncertain future adherence.

BACKGROUND: Statins are an important part of the treatment plan for patients 
with type 2 diabetes. However, patients who are prescribed statins often take 
less than the prescribed amount or stop taking the drug altogether. This 
suboptimal adherence may decrease the benefit of statin initiation.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the influence of adherence on the optimal timing of 
statin initiation for patients with type 2 diabetes.
METHOD: The authors use a Markov decision process (MDP) model to optimize the 
treatment decision for patients with type 2 diabetes. Their model incorporates a 
Markov model linking adherence to treatment effectiveness and long-term health 
outcomes. They determine the optimal time of statin initiation that minimizes 
expected costs and maximizes expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: In the long run, approximately 25% of patients remain highly adherent 
to statins. Based on the MDP model, generic statins lower costs in men and 
result in a small increase in costs in women relative to no treatment. Patients 
are able to noticeably increase their expected QALYs by 0.5 to 2 years depending 
on the level of adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence-improving interventions can increase expected QALYs by as 
much as 1.5 years. Given suboptimal adherence to statins, it is optimal to delay 
the start time for statins; however, changing the start time alone does not lead 
to significant changes in costs or QALYs.

Ill-health and intellectual disabilities.

McCarthy J(1), O'Hara J.

Author information:
(1)Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, London, UK. 
jane.m.mccarthy@kcl.ac.uk

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Adults with intellectual disabilities are recognized globally 
as a group of individuals with poorer access to appropriate healthcare and have 
worse health outcomes than the general population, including significantly 
reduced life expectancy. This article reviews the evidence base published over 
the past 12-24 months, highlighting how public health policy is influencing the 
literature on the health needs of people with intellectual disabilities.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies looking at information from death certificates 
found people with intellectual disabilities died 15 years younger than people 
without intellectual disabilities. Using standardized mortality rates, the 
overall mortality for people with intellectual disabilities is three times 
higher than for the general population. People with intellectual disabilities 
have higher rates of asthma and oral disease, but similar rates of hypertension. 
There is limited high-quality evidence on drugs used to treat epilepsy in this 
population, despite epilepsy being one of the leading causes of premature 
deaths.
SUMMARY: Recent evidence continues to show that people with intellectual 
disabilities have poorer health outcomes than the general population. However, 
the quality of evidence available on the wider health needs remains limited, 
but, with the move to a public health approach through health surveillance, this 
may increase the quality of evidence available, so influencing health outcomes 
for people with intellectual disabilities.

The pharmacological chaperone, isofagomine (IFG), enhances acid β-glucosidase 
(GCase) function by altering folding, trafficking, and activity in wild-type and 
Gaucher disease fibroblasts. The in vivo effects of IFG on GCase activity, its 
substrate levels, and phenotype were evaluated using a neuronopathic Gaucher 
disease mouse model, 4L;C* (V394L/V394L + saposin C-/-) that has CNS 
accumulation of glucosylceramide (GC) and glucosylsphingosine (GS) as well as 
progressive neurological deterioration. IFG administration to 4L;C* mice at 20 
or 600 mg/kg/day resulted in life span extensions of 10 or 20 days, 
respectively, and increases in GCase activity and protein levels in the brain 
and visceral tissues. Cerebral cortical GC and GS levels showed no significant 
reductions with IFG treatment. Increases of GC or GS levels were detected in the 
visceral tissues of IFG treated (600 mg/kg/day) mice. The attenuations of brain 
proinflammatory responses in the treated mice were evidenced by reductions in 
astrogliosis and microglial cell activation, and decreased p38 phosphorylation 
and TNFα levels. Terminally, axonal degeneration was present in the brain and 
spinal cord from untreated and treated 4L;C* mice. These data demonstrate that 
IFG exerts in vivo effects by enhancing V394L GCase protein and activity levels, 
and in mediating suppression of proinflammation, which led to delayed onset of 
neurological disease and extension of the life span of 4L;C* mice. However, this 
was not correlated with a reduction in the accumulation of lipid substrates.
