Obesity has become a major global health challenge of the 21st century, as it is 
associated with the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular 
complications, even at a very early age in life. The root causes of pediatric 
obesity remain incompletely understood. The obesity epidemic together with the 
relationship of obesity to the growing population burden of chronic disease 
presents unprecedented research opportunities and challenges. Decades of 
obesity-related research funded by governments around the world have yielded 
many important discoveries about both etiological pathways and preventive or 
therapeutic interventions. Yet, there is a sense that the problem is outpacing 
these research efforts. Obesity poses a significant risk for the development of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) , diabetes and certain cancers thereby shortening 
life expectancy. Nevertheless, many obese individuals do not develop any of 
these comorbidities. One hypothesis explaining this dilemma is that total body 
fat is not the culprit of adverse health in obesity rather the relative 
proportion of lipids in various fat depots is what determines the metabolic 
risk. In this review, we describe the role of altered fat partitioning in youth 
onset obesity and its relation to fatty liver and T2D during adolescence.

AIM: To investigate the effect of malignancy on the outcomes of patients with 
severe aortic stenosis (AS) and the management strategy for AS with malignancy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using data of 3815 patients with severe AS in a 
retrospective multicentre registry [CURRENT AS (Contemporary outcomes after 
sURgery and medical tREatmeNT in patients with severe Aortic Stenosis) 
registry], we compared 3-year clinical outcomes among three groups based on 
malignancy status: with malignancy currently under treatment including best 
supportive care (malignancy group), with a history of malignancy without any 
current treatment (past history group), or without history of malignancy (no 
malignancy group). Patients in the malignancy group (n = 124) were more often 
men and had higher prevalence of low body mass index, recurrence of malignancy, 
anaemia, and asymptomatic status, despite comparable surgical risks and 
echocardiographic parameters. The malignancy group or the past history group 
(n = 389) had significantly higher risk for all-cause death [hazard ratio (HR) 
2.49, 95% CI (95% confidence interval) 1.98-3.14; HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04-1.46] and 
for malignancy-related death (HR 16.2, 95% CI 10.64-24.54; HR 3.66, 95% CI 
2.43-5.52) than that of the no malignancy group (n = 3302). The excess risk for 
aortic valve-related death was not observed in the malignancy group (HR 0.79, 
95% CI 0.48-1.29) and was lower in the past history group (HR 0.72, 95% CI 
0.53-0.96). In the malignancy group, the treatment strategy (surgery: n = 16, 
conservative management: n = 108) was determined based on the clinical status of 
AS or life expectancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Malignancy had marked effect on all-cause death and 
malignancy-related death in patients with severe AS. History of malignancy also 
had a smaller but significant effect on mortality.

AIMS: Diabetes and cancer frequently coexist in the same subject, often having 
relevant effects on the management and prognosis of the oncologic patient. 
However, existing guidelines do not deal with many clinical issues in this 
setting appropriately. In evaluating the opinions of Diabetologists and 
Oncologists dealing with diabetes care in people with cancer, the Italian 
Association of Diabetologists (AMD) promoted a dedicated exploratory survey.
METHODS: The survey was carried out through the web or handily delivered printed 
copies between October 2014 and April 2015, in Italy. It was composed of 27 
questions intended to gather information on the characteristics of participants 
and to examine their clinical habits in this context, and participation was 
totally free and anonymous.
RESULTS: A total of 252 physicians participated in the survey. Diabetologists 
accounted for 51.1% of respondents. According to survey results, in spite of the 
presence of diabetes (or diabetic complications) worsening the outcome of cancer 
treatments, the counseling or intervention of a Diabetologist was only required 
for less than two-thirds of hospitalized patients. For subjects with a life 
expectancy of months, 80% of specialists considered a glycemic target of 
120-250 mg/dL optimal whereas Oncologists were more likely to consider a range 
of 180-360 mg/dL for patients with a shorter life expectancy. Furthermore, 1 
participant out of 3 indicated 1-4 measurements/day as the most appropriate 
frequency for blood glucose monitoring including in the palliative setting. 
Insulin was the therapy of choice for the majority of respondents albeit with 
different routes of administration.
CONCLUSIONS: This survey provides interesting preliminary data that could help 
facilitate and optimize the management of patients with cancer and diabetes, 
promoting the delivery of an organic answer to fragmented assistance, to 
potentially inappropriate behaviors, and to a tailored therapy in a context of 
particular clinical fragility.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Diagnosis of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome 
(IBS-D) relies on the Rome IV symptom-based criteria, which are imperfect for 
separating functional vs organic disease. Biomarker tests for IBS-D might be 
added to symptom data to allow clinicians to make more accurate and precise 
diagnoses in a cost-effective manner. We tested the economic consequences of 
using a range of hypothetical IBS-D biomarkers, and explored at what cost and 
level of accuracy a biomarker becomes cost effective. We produced a framework 
for payers to evaluate the return on an investment of implementing IBS-D 
biomarkers of varying accuracy and cost.
METHODS: We used decision analysis software to evaluate a hypothetical cohort of 
patients who met Rome IV criteria for IBS-D. We conducted cost-utility and 
budget impact analyses of 2 competing approaches: usual care or an IBS 
biomarker-based diagnostic approach. Patients in the usual care group received 
empiric IBS treatment; non-responders received additional diagnostic tests for 
organic disease. In the group evaluated with a biomarker test, those with a 
positive result received IBS treatment before additional diagnostic analyses, 
whereas patients with a negative result underwent upfront diagnostic testing. 
Outcomes were incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained 
(third-party payer perspective) and incremental per-member per-month cost.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, using a willingness-to-pay threshold of 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life year, we found that biomarkers are not cost 
effective when the biomarker test costs more than $846, even if the test is 100% 
accurate in detecting IBS-D. In probabilistic analysis using 1,000 simulations, 
most trials (75% or more) show that the biomarker-based diagnostic approach is 
cost effective above the following accuracy thresholds: a $100 biomarker test 
with 51% accuracy, a $200 test with 57% accuracy, a $300 test with 63% accuracy, 
a $400 test with 69% accuracy, a $500 test with 76% accuracy, a $600 test with 
82% accuracy, a $700 test with 89% accuracy, and a $800 test with 94% accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: In decision analysis of a hypothetical cohort of patients who met 
Rome IV criteria for IBS-D, we identified cost and accuracy thresholds that can 
guide investigators and payers as they develop, validate, price, and/or 
reimburse IBS-D biomarker tests for use in everyday clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: Although the primary goal of treatment of type II odontoid fracture 
is bony union, some advocate continued nonsurgical management of minimally 
symptomatic older patients who have fibrous union or minimal fracture motion. 
The risk of this strategy is unknown. We reviewed our long-term outcomes after 
dens nonunion to define the natural history of Type II odontoid fractures in 
elderly patients managed nonoperatively.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 50 consecutive adults aged 65 or older 
with Type II odontoid fracture initially managed nonsurgically from 1998 to 2012 
at a single tertiary care institution was conducted. Particular attention was 
paid to patients who had orthosis removal despite absent bony fusion. Patients 
were contacted prospectively by telephone and followed until death, surgical 
intervention, or last known contact.
RESULTS: Fifty patients initially were managed nonsurgically; of these, 21 
(42.0%) proceeded to bony fusion, 3 (6%) underwent delayed surgery for 
persistent instability, and 26 (52%) had orthosis removal despite the lack of 
solid arthrodesis on imaging. The last group had a median follow-up of 25 months 
(range 4-158 months), with 20 of 26 (76.9%) followed until death. Of these 
patients, 1 patient developed progressive quadriplegia and dysphagia 11 months 
after initial injury. Compared with patients with spontaneous union, patients 
with nonunion had shorter life expectancy, despite no significant differences 
between the groups with respect to age, sex, injury mechanism, radiographic 
variables, or follow-up duration.
CONCLUSIONS: Orthosis removal despite fracture nonunion may be reasonable in 
elderly patients with Type II dens fractures.

BACKGROUND: Imagery rescripting is a psychotherapeutic technique that aims to 
ameliorate negative emotions by altering (i.e., rescripting) inner 
representations of negative memories and images. Although the treatment was 
initially developed for traumatized individuals, face-to-face interventions have 
yielded promising results for patients with other diagnoses as well. The present 
study explored the feasibility and efficacy of the approach when used as a 
self-help intervention for depression.
METHOD: A total of 127 individuals with diagnosed depression were randomly 
allocated to either a wait-list control condition or received a brief or long 
version of a manual teaching imagery rescripting. Six weeks after inclusion, 
patients were invited to participate in the post assessment. The Beck Depression 
Inventory (BDI-II) served as the primary outcome (registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03299127).
RESULTS: The long version was superior to the wait-list control condition on the 
BDI-II, self-esteem, and quality of life at a medium effect size. No effects 
emerged for anxiety. No significant between-group differences were found for the 
brief version. Moderation analyses indicated that the self-help approach seems 
particularly beneficial for those scoring high on symptoms, willingness to 
change, and expectancy (baseline). Most patients indicated they would use the 
technique in the future.
DISCUSSION: The efficacy of imagery rescripting was confirmed when applied via 
self-help. Use of the long form of the manual is recommended. Future studies are 
needed to ascertain whether treatment effects are sustained over time.

The dramatic increase in life expectancy is leading to a significant increase in 
the use of gastrointestinal endoscopy in the elderly. Taking into account these 
demographic changes, the use of gastrointestinal endoscopy in this age group is 
of great importance. Although these procedures are generally safe and well 
tolerated even in very elderly patients, the onset of physiological changes 
associated with aging and the increased prevalence of cardiovascular and 
pulmonary comorbidities raise the risk of sedation related complications in 
these patients. Age alone is not a contraindication for performing any 
endoscopic procedure. However, elderly patients have their own peculiarities 
that require a detailed review of the characteristics, risks and benefits of 
endoscopic procedures in this specific context.

BACKGROUND: The burden of pulmonary hypertension (PHT) in Central Australia has 
not been previously studied. Our aim is to characterise the prevalence, clinical 
classification, and long-term survival of individuals with PHT in Central 
Australia.
METHODS: A community-based cohort study of all individuals diagnosed with PHT in 
Central Australia between 2005 and 2016 was undertaken. We estimated PHT 
prevalence using population data, describe clinical PHT classification, and 
characterised long-term survival using Kaplan-Meier approaches.
RESULTS: A total of 183 patients were identified (mean age 52±16years, 63% 
female). Of these individuals, 149 (81.4%) were of Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander (ATSI) descent. The prevalence per 100,000 of any PHT was significantly 
higher In ATSI (723 [95% CI 608-839] compared to non-ATSI individuals (126 [95% 
CI 84-168], p<0.001). Furthermore, ATSI individuals were diagnosed at younger 
ages compared to non-ATSI individuals (49±15 vs 64±16years, p<0.001). Median 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (ePASP) was higher in patients with 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) compared to other causes (62 [IQR 54-69] 
vs 50 [IQR 44-58] mmHg, p<0.01). The median survival rate from diagnosis was 9 
years (IQR 7.2-13.2). Age and ePASP were significant predictors of mortality (HR 
1.05 [95% CI 1.02-1.07] and HR 1.56 [95% 1.00-2.42] respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In this community based study, we found a high burden of PHT in 
Central Australia. The prevalence of PHT is greater in ATSI individuals and is 
diagnosed at younger ages compared to non-ATSI individuals. Together with other 
cardiovascular diseases, PHT may be in-part contributing to the gap in life 
expectancy between ATSI and non-ATSI individuals.

Slower trunk muscle responses are linked to back pain and injury. Unfortunately, 
clinical assessments of spine function do not objectively evaluate this 
important attribute, which reflects speed of trunk control. Speed of trunk 
control can be parsed into two components: (1) delay, the time it takes to 
initiate a movement, and (2) lag, the time it takes to execute a movement once 
initiated. The goal of this study is to demonstrate a new approach to assess 
delay and lag in trunk control using a simple tracking task. Ten healthy 
subjects performed four blocks of six trials of trunk tracking in the sagittal 
plane. Delay and lag were estimated by modeling trunk control for predictable 
and unpredictable (control mode) trunk movements in flexion and extension 
(control direction) at movement amplitudes of 2°, 4°, and 6° (control 
amplitude). The main effect of control mode, direction, and amplitude of 
movement were compared between trial blocks to assess secondary influencers 
(e.g., fatigue). Only control mode was consistent across trial blocks with 
predictable movements being faster than unpredictable for both delay and lag. 
Control direction and amplitude effects on delay and lag were consistent across 
the first two trial blocks and less consistent in later blocks. Given the 
heterogeneity in the presentation of back pain, clinical assessment of trunk 
control should include different control modes, directions, and amplitudes. To 
reduce testing time and the influence of fatigue, we recommend six trials to 
assess trunk control.

This study was conducted to research and develop recommendations for gender 
transformative approaches that will address misconceptions around food and 
nutrition, and reducing barriers around dietary diversity within rural Khatlon 
Province, Tajikistan. Most of the population in Tajikistan live in rural areas 
and spend a large part of their income on food. While stunting in children under 
5 years has decreased, acute malnutrition and the number of underweight children 
has increased. This is a qualitative, cross-sectional study that involved 
secondary data analysis, key informant interviews (KIIs), and focus group 
discussions (FGDs) to gauge appropriate interventions for agricultural extension 
agents seeking to improve the nutritional outcomes of their communities. In 
February of 2017, data were collected from 4 KIIs and 15 FGDs that were 
stratified as mothers with young children, mothers-in-law, and husbands, across 
12 different villages. Analysis of the KIIs and FGDs included NVivo software for 
coding and to uncover the most salient themes and characteristics from each. The 
participants of this study reported several misconceptions and taboos 
surrounding certain foods, especially during pregnancy, and food practices for 
children under the age of 5 years. Results also indicated a household hierarchy 
of decision-making surrounding food that included who buys, cooks, and decides 
what to buy. The findings of this study will be used as a springboard to launch 
gender-responsive and nutrition-sensitive interventions through the local 
agricultural extension agents.

INTRODUCTION: Recurrent musculoskeletal haemorrhages in people with haemophilia 
(PwH) lead to restrictions in the locomotor system and, as a result, in physical 
performance, too. Due to its physical and psychological benefits, sport is 
increasingly re-commended for haemophilic patients. Evidence on the 
cost-effectiveness of sports therapy is still lacking.
AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of a 6-month 
programmed sports therapy (PST).
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of the 6-month PST was assessed from a societal 
perspective alongside a RCT using cost-utility analysis. The analysis included 
50 PwH with moderate-to-severe haemophilia A and B and a training period over 
6 months. The health-related quality of life was measured with the 
EuroQoL-domain questionnaire. Resource utilization was assessed by questionnaire 
before and after the intervention. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was 
constructed, and sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: During the 6-month study period, mean adjusted total healthcare costs 
were lower (mean difference: -22 805 EUR; 95%-CI: -73 944-48 463; P = .59) and 
the number of QALYs was higher in the intervention group (mean difference: 
0.3733; 95%-CI: 0.0014-0.0573; P = .04). The probability of an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio <50 000 EUR per QALY was 71%. The performed sensitivity 
analysis confirmed these results.
CONCLUSION: Results showed that the PST is effective in terms of a significant 
gain of QALYs. Furthermore, results weakly indicate the potential of the PST to 
reduce healthcare costs. Future studies should expand the observation period to 
have a closer look at the influence of PST on lifetime costs.

OBJECTIVE: Sacubitril/valsartan (SAC/VAL) has been shown to reduce mortality and 
hospitalization in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF) compared with enalapril but at a substantially higher cost. This study 
evaluates the cost-effectiveness of SAC/VAL versus enalapril in patients with 
HFrEF over a 5-year time horizon from the U.S. payer perspective.
METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model was developed to compare costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between SAC/VAL and enalapril in patients 
with HFrEF over a 5-year time horizon. Markov states included New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) class (II-IV) and death. Treatment discontinuation, 
HF-related hospitalizations, and NYHA class progression were modeled as 
transition states based on data from the PARADIGM trial. Other probabilities, 
costs, and utilities were obtained from published literature and public 
databases.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, SAC/VAL cost more than enalapril ($81,943 vs 
$67,287) and was more effective (2.647 QALYs vs 2.546 QALYs), resulting in an 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $143,891/QALY gained. At a willingness 
to pay (WTP) of $100,000/QALY, SAC/VAL was cost-effective up to a cost of 
$298/month. Results were most sensitive to SAC/VAL cost, SAC/VAL mortality 
benefit, and NYHA progression probability. SAC/VAL had a 10% and 52% probability 
of being cost-effective at WTP thresholds of $100,000/QALY and $150,000/QALY, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: SAC/VAL is associated with clinical benefit and may be 
cost-effective compared with the current standard of care over realistic 
treatment durations from the payer perspective. Results of this analysis can 
inform discussions on the value and position of SAC/VAL in the current market.

Background: Patient education (PE) is a core treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) 
with the aim to increase persons' knowledge, self-efficacy, and empowerment. 
Objective: To describe person's various experiences of learning processes in PE 
for OA. Design: Phenomenography. Method: Semi-structured interviews were 
performed with the same persons, pre- (11) and post- (9) education. Results: 
Various experiences on learning processes were found and were described in an 
outcome space. Achieving knowledge describes self-regulated learning and 
strongly relates to Control, which describes a high order cognitive learning 
skill, and minor to Confirm, which describes a cognitive learning skill based on 
recognition and application. Receiving knowledge describes the expectancy of 
learning regulated from the educator and strongly relates to Comply, which 
describes a low-order cognitive learning skill, and minor to Confirm. 
Conclusion: Different experiences of motivation and learning impact on persons' 
learning processes which, in turn, influence the persons' capability to 
accomplish self-efficacy and empowerment. The outcome space may serve as a basis 
for discussions between healthcare educators involved in PE to better understand 
what learning implies and to develop PE further.

HIV infection and lipids.

London, UK.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We comment on the role of dyslipidaemia in cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) in HIV-infected patients. We have discussed various risk factors, 
including traditional CVD risk factors, HIV-related risk factors and 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-induced dyslipidaemia.
RECENT FINDINGS: HIV-infected individuals are prone to lipid and lipoprotein 
abnormalities as a result of the infection itself and the effect of ART. The 
older drugs used for the treatment of HIV were associated with an increased risk 
of these abnormalities. New therapies used to treat HIV are lipid friendly. 
Calculating CVD risk in the HIV population is complex due to the infection 
itself and the ART-related factors. The advancement in ART has helped to 
increase the life expectancy of HIV patients. As a result, a growing number of 
patients die of non-HIV related complications such as CVD, hepatic and renal 
disease. Outcome studies with intervention for dyslipidaemia in HIV are 
underway.
SUMMARY: The implications of the above findings suggest that all patients with 
HIV should undergo a CVD risk assessment before starting ART. Appropriate 
lipid-friendly ART regimen should be initiated along with intervention for 
associated CVD risk factors (e.g. lipids, hypertension and smoking).

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recognize the presentation of anaphylaxis for prompt 
management and treatment and to provide tools for the diagnosis of the 
underlying cause(s) and set up a long-term treatment to prevent recurrence of 
anaphylaxis.
RECENT FINDINGS: The recent description of phenotypes provides new insight and 
understanding into the mechanisms and causes of anaphylaxis through a better 
understanding of endotypes and biomarkers for broad clinical use.
SUMMARY: Anaphylaxis is the most severe hypersensitivity reaction and can lead 
to death. Epinephrine is the first-line treatment of anaphylaxis and it is 
life-saving. Patients with first-line therapy-induced anaphylaxis are candidates 
for desensitization to increase their quality of life and life expectancy. 
Desensitization is a breakthrough novel treatment for patients with anaphylaxis 
in need of first-line therapy, including chemotherapy, mAbs, aspirin and others. 
Ultrarush with venom immunotherapy should be considered in patients who present 
with life-threatening anaphylaxis after Hymenoptera sting with evidence of 
IgE-mediated mechanisms. Food desensitization is currently being expanded to 
provide increased safety to adults and children with food-induced anaphylaxis.

BACKGROUND: In patients having elective hip or knee replacements, many comorbid 
conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and congestive heart 
failure, are associated with postoperative mortality. Renal failure and a 
history of renal transplantation also increase mortality. However, the effect of 
different stages of chronic kidney disease on patients' prognoses is unclear.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the risk of postoperative mortality in different 
stages of chronic kidney disease after elective hip or knee replacement and does 
the risk increase with mild renal insufficiency? (2) How severe is the risk of 
death in patients with chronic kidney disease compared with other major medical 
comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and congestive heart 
failure? (3) Are there risk factor combinations associated with especially poor 
survival?
METHODS: Using longitudinally maintained databases, the records of 18,575 
patients (median age 69 years, 63% female, median body mass index 29 kg/m) 
undergoing elective hip and knee replacements from a single center between 2002 
and 2011 were analyzed in this retrospective study. A total of 6519 (35%) 
patients had Stage I, 9917 (53%) Stage II, 2023 (11%) Stage III, 81 (0.4%) Stage 
IV, and 35 (0.2%) Stage V chronic kidney disease. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used 
to analyze mortality at different stages of the disease. Cox regression analysis 
was performed to compare the risk of death associated with the comorbid 
conditions of interest. Comorbid conditions with greatest risk for death 
(diabetes, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure) were combined 
separately with chronic kidney disease using logistic regression. According to 
data from the Finnish Population Register Centre, a total of 4055 deaths 
occurred in our patient cohort during the followup period. The median followup 
was 7.8 years (range, 0-14 years; interquartile range, 5.8-10.0 years).
RESULTS: The mean survival time was 13 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 
12.5-12.7 years) in Stage I, 11 years (95% CI, 11.3-11.5 years) in Stage II, 9 
years (95% CI, 9.2-9.7 years) in Stage III, 7 years (95% CI, 5.6-7.5 years) in 
Stage IV, and 6 years (95% CI, 4.9-8.0 years) in Stage V (p < 0.001). Compared 
with Stage I chronic kidney disease, the risk of death increased with every step 
of the disease (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.9 [95% CI, 1.76-2.10]; HR, 3.8 
[95% CI, 3.39-4.19]; and HR, 8.1 [95% CI, 6.33-10.31] in Stages II, III, and 
IV-V, respectively). Compared with congestive heart failure (HR, 2.11 [95% CI, 
1.81-2.45], p < 0.001), coronary disease (HR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.40-1.69], p < 
0.001), diabetes (HR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.54-1.90], p < 0.001), and hypertension 
(HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.26-1.45], p < 0.001), Stage III and Stage IV to V chronic 
kidney disease are associated with poorer survival. The combination of chronic 
kidney disease and diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 8.15 [95% CI, 4.9-13.51]) had a 
synergistic effect on the risk of death compared with chronic kidney disease 
(OR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.70-3.28]) or diabetes alone (OR, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.70-2.03]) 
during the first postoperative year.
CONCLUSIONS: All stages of chronic kidney disease have a harmful effect on 
long-term life expectancy in joint replacement recipients. The risk becomes 
clinically meaningful in the most severe forms of the disease, but also in 
moderate chronic kidney disease when it is accompanied by diabetes, coronary 
disease, or congestive heart failure. It should be recognized that these 
patients achieve fewer quality-adjusted life-years even if clinical outcomes 
were similar. The effect of chronic kidney disease on cost-effectiveness of hip 
and knee replacements should be investigated in future studies.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

Predicting patient life expectancy is of great importance for clinicians in 
making treatment decisions. This prediction needs to be conducted in a dynamic 
manner, based on longitudinal biomarkers repeatedly measured during the 
patient's post-treatment follow-up period. The prediction is updated any time a 
new biomarker measurement is obtained. The heterogeneity across patients of 
biomarker trajectories over time requires flexible and powerful approaches to 
model noisy and irregularly measured longitudinal data. In this article, we use 
functional principal component analysis (FPCA) to extract the dominant features 
of the biomarker trajectory of each individual, and use these features as 
time-dependent predictors (covariates) in a transformed mean residual life (MRL) 
regression model to conduct dynamic prediction. Simulation studies demonstrate 
the improved performance of the transformed MRL model that includes longitudinal 
biomarker information in the prediction. We apply the proposed method to predict 
the remaining time expectancy until disease progression for patients with 
chronic myeloid leukemia, using the transcript levels of an oncogene, BCR-ABL.

BACKGROUND: In this study the antifungal potential of a phenolic extract 
obtained from rice bran fermented with Rhizopus oryzae CECT 7560 and its 
application in the elaboration of bread was assessed.
RESULTS: Eighteen compounds with antifungal potential were identified by 
LC-ESI-qTOF-MS in the extract: organic acids, gallates and gallotannins, 
flavonoids, ellagic acid and benzophenone derivatives. The extract was active 
against strains of Fusarium, Aspergillus and Penicillium, with minimum 
inhibitory concentration ranging from 390 to 3100 µg mL-1 and minimum fungicidal 
concentration variable from 780 to 6300 µg mL-1 . The strains that were most 
sensitive to the phenolic extract were F. graminearum, F. culmorum, F. poae, P. 
roqueforti, P. expansum and A. niger. The phenolic extract added at 5 and 1 g 
kg-1 concentrations in the preparation of bread loaves contaminated with P. 
expansum produced a reduction of 0.6 and 0.7 log CFU g-1 . The bread loaves 
treated with calcium propionate and 10 g kg-1 of the phenolic extract evidenced 
an improvement in their shelf lives of 3 days.
CONCLUSION: The phenolic extract assessed in this study could be considered as 
an alternative for inhibiting toxigenic fungi and as a substitute for synthetic 
compounds in food preservation. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

Aging is the main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The increased 
prevalence of CVD is partly due to the global increase in life expectancy. In 
this context, it is essential to identify the mechanisms by which aging induces 
CVD, with the ultimate aim of reducing its incidence. Both atherosclerosis and 
heart failure significantly contribute to age-associated CVD morbidity and 
mortality. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic 
disorder caused by the synthesis of progerin, which is noted for accelerated 
aging and CVD. This mutant form of prelamin A induces generalised 
atherosclerosis, vascular calcification, and cardiac electrophysiological 
abnormalities, leading to premature aging and death, mainly due to myocardial 
infarction and stroke. This review discusses the main vascular structural and 
functional abnormalities during physiological and premature aging, as well as 
the mechanisms involved in the exacerbated CVD and accelerated aging induced by 
the accumulation of progerin and prelamin A. Both proteins are expressed in 
non-HGPS individuals, and physiological aging shares many features of progeria. 
Research into HGPS could therefore shed light on novel mechanisms involved in 
the physiological aging of the cardiovascular system.

Historical and Current Advances That Incorporate Competing Risk for Benefit and 
Mortality in Older Patients With Cancer.

Competing risk occurs when patients have >1 disease or condition that can affect 
an important outcome, such as mortality. In older adults who develop cancer, the 
presence of comorbid chronic diseases or functional impairments can change the 
likelihood that the cancer will lead to an adverse outcome. The recognition and 
incorporation of competing risk into oncology research started during the 
experimental development of chemotherapy. A related concept of considering 
performance status in clinical trials of cancer therapies also occurred in the 
context of treatment interventions using chemotherapy. Statistical methodologies 
for competing risk have advanced substantially over time, and a patient's 
performance measurements remain common in deciding how best to care for older 
patients with cancer. The historical development of these 2 uses of competing 
risk, statistical adjustment in research and patient performance measurement, is 
explained. Furthermore, this article discusses more recent advances in merging 
these 2 approaches. Particular attention is given to advances in calculating 
life expectancy that are specific to a patient's condition, status, or setting, 
and to describing how these estimates might be used to inform decisions about 
cancer care in older patients. Frameworks for moving beyond mortality as the 
only considered competing outcome to describe other outcomes, such as functional 
loss or the need for institutionalization, are also described. Finally, 
approaches that could more fully leverage the advanced methods for incorporating 
competing risks into clinical decision making are presented.

Patient perspectives on the HIV continuum of care in London: a qualitative study 
of people diagnosed between 1986 and 2014.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences of the HIV treatment cascade of 
diagnosis, engagement with care and initiation of treatment from the perspective 
of patients; we explored whether this differed according to the year of their 
diagnosis, for example, whether they had experienced HIV care in the 
pretreatment era.
DESIGN: Qualitative interview study with framework analysis.
SETTING: Two large HIV adult outpatient clinics in central London.
PARTICIPANTS: 52 HIV-positive individuals, 41 men, 11 women, purposively sampled 
to include people who had been diagnosed at different stages in the history of 
the epidemic classified as four 'generations': pre-1996 (preantiretroviral 
therapy (ART)), 1997-2005 (complex ARTs), 2006-2012 (simpler ARTs) and 2013 
onwards (recent diagnoses).
RESULTS: Some important differences were identified; for earlier generations, 
the visible illness and deaths from AIDS made it harder to engage with care 
following diagnosis. Subsequent decisions about starting treatment were deeply 
influenced by the fear of severe side effects from early ART. However, despite 
improvements in ART and life expectancy over the epidemic, we found a striking 
similarity across participants' accounts of the key stages of the care 
continuum, regardless of when they were diagnosed. Diagnosis was a major 
traumatic life event for almost everyone. Fear of testing positive or having low 
self-perceived risk affected the timing of testing and diagnosis. Engaging with 
care was facilitated by a flexible approach from services/clinicians. Initiating 
treatment was a major life decision.
CONCLUSION: We found patients' experiences are influenced by when they were 
diagnosed, with earliest cohorts facing substantial challenges. However, being 
diagnosed with HIV and starting treatment continue to be significant 
life-altering events even in the era of effective, simple treatments. Despite 
the advances of biomedical treatment, services should continue to recognise the 
needs of patients for whom the diagnosis and treatment remain significant 
challenges.
