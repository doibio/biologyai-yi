Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the anus is a human papilloma virus (HPV) 
related malignancy that is preceded by anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) 
making this cancer, at least theoretically, a preventable disease. In the past 
10 years the diagnosis, management and nomenclature of AIN has dramatically 
changed. Increased life expectancy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
positive patients due to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has caused 
an increase in the incidence of SCC of the anus. While many experts recommend 
screening and treatment of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion 
(HSIL), there is no consensus on the optimal management these lesions. 
Therefore, there is a need to review the current evidence on diagnosis and 
treatment of AIN and formulate recommendations to guide management. Surgeons who 
are members of the Italian Society of Colorectal Surgery (SICCR) with a 
recognized interest in AIN were invited to contribute on various topics after a 
comprehensive literature search. Levels of evidence were classified using the 
Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine of 2009 and the strength of 
recommendation was graded according to the United States (US) preventive 
services task force. These recommendations are among the few entirely dedicated 
only to the precursors of SCC of the anus and provide an evidence-based summary 
of the current knowledge about the management of AIN that will serve as a 
reference for clinicians involved in the treatment of patients at risk for anal 
cancer.

BACKGROUND: Using non-statin lipid-modifying agents in combination with statin 
therapy provides additional benefits for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk 
reduction, but their value for money has only been evaluated in high-income 
countries (HICs). Furthermore, studies mainly derive effectiveness data from a 
single trial or older meta-analyses.
OBJECTIVES: Our study used data from the most recent network meta-analysis (NMA) 
and local parameters to assess the cost effectiveness of non-statin agents in 
statin-treated patients with a history of CVD.
METHODS: A published Markov model was adopted to investigate lifetime outcomes: 
(1) number of recurrent CVD events prevented, (2) quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs) gained, (3) costs and (4) incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) 
of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) and 
ezetimibe added to statin therapy. Event rates and effectiveness inputs were 
obtained from the NMA. Cost and utility data were gathered from published 
studies conducted in Thailand. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Patients receiving PCSK9i and ezetimibe experienced fewer recurrent CVD 
events (number needed to treat [NNT] 17 and 30) and more QALYs (0.168 and 0.096 
QALYs gained per person). However, under the societal perspective and at current 
acquisition costs in 2018, ICERs of both agents were $US1,223,995 and 27,361 per 
QALY gained, respectively. Based on threshold analyses, the costs need to be 
reduced by 97 and 85%, respectively, for PCSK9i and ezetimibe to be 
cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the proven effectiveness of PCSK9i and ezetimibe, the costs 
of these agents need to reduce to a much greater extent than in HICs to be 
cost-effective in Thailand.

Over the last decades, the production and consumption of pharmaceuticals and 
health care products grew manifold, allowing an increase in life expectancy and 
a better life quality for humans and animals, in general. However, the growth in 
pharmaceuticals production and consumption comes with an increase in waste 
production, which creates a number of challenges as well as opportunities for 
the waste management industries. The conventional current technologies used to 
treat effluents have shown to be inefficient to remove or just to reduce the 
concentrations of these types of pollutants to the legal limits. The present 
review provides a thorough state-of-the-art overview on the use of biological 
processes in the rehabilitation of ecosystems contaminated with the 
pharmaceutical compounds most commonly detected in the environment and 
eventually more studied by the scientific community. Among the different 
biological processes, special attention is given to biosorption and 
biodegradation.

Aim: Cryotherapy is commonly implemented following soccer match-play in an 
attempt to accelerate the natural time-course of recovery, but the effect of 
this intervention on neuromuscular function is unknown. The aim of the present 
study was to examine the effect of donning lower-body garments fitted with 
cooled phase change material (PCM) on recovery of neuromuscular function 
following competitive soccer match-play. Methods: Using a randomized, crossover 
design, 11 male semi-professional soccer players wore PCM cooled to 15°C 
(PCMcold) or left at ambient temperature (PCMamb; sham control) for 3 h 
following soccer match-play. Pre-, and 24, 48, and 72 h post-match, participants 
completed a battery of neuromuscular, physical, and perceptual tests. Maximal 
voluntary contraction force (MVC) and twitch responses to electrical (femoral 
nerve) and magnetic (motor cortex) stimulation (TMS) during isometric 
knee-extension and at rest were measured to assess central nervous system (CNS) 
(voluntary activation, VA) and muscle contractile (quadriceps potentiated twitch 
force, Qtw,pot) function. Fatigue and perceptions of muscle soreness were 
assessed via visual analog scales, and physical function was assessed through 
measures of jump [countermovement jump (CMJ) height and reactive strength index 
(RSI)] performance. A belief questionnaire was completed pre- and 
post-intervention to determine the perceived effectiveness of each garment. 
Results: Competitive soccer match-play elicited persistent decrements in MVC, VA 
measured with femoral nerve stimulation, Qtw,pot, as well as reactive strength, 
fatigue and muscle soreness (P < 0.05). Both MVC and VA were higher at 48 h 
post-match after wearing PCMcold compared with PCMamb (P < 0.05). However, there 
was no effect of PCM on the magnitude or time-course of recovery for any other 
neuromuscular, physical function, or perceptual indices studied (P > 0.05). The 
belief questionnaire revealed that players perceived that both PCMcold and 
PCMamb were moderately effective in improving recovery, with no difference 
between the two interventions (P = 0.56). Conclusion: Although wearing cooled 
PCM garments improved MVC and VA 48 h following match-play, the lack of effect 
on measures of physical function or perceptual responses to match-play suggest 
that PCM offers a limited benefit to the recovery process. The lack of effect 
could have been due to the relatively small magnitude of change in most of the 
outcome measures studied.

Ioannina, Greece.

In the 21st century, life expectancy has increased and consequently so has the 
number of elderly people. Sarcopenia is an emerging area in geriatric medicine. 
The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) defined 
sarcopenia as a syndrome characterised by progressive and generalised loss of 
skeletal muscle mass and strength and/or physical performance, associated with a 
risk of adverse outcomes such as physical disability, poor quality of life, and 
death. Sarcopenia requires diagnostic and interventional methods in order to 
initiate timely and appropriate treatment. Diagnosing sarcopenia requires 
assessments of muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance. Management 
of sarcopenia involves a variety of approaches. Nutritional and exercise 
interventions are strongly supported.

The number of older adults is increasing in high-income countries as survival 
chances continue to improve. We investigate changes in survival at older ages in 
high-income countries and show that although survival chances have improved, 
these improvements are concentrated at the top of the survival distribution 
where there is a small share of the population. Among females who survive to age 
85 in the most recently birth cohort (1925), for example, about half die within 
8 years while those in the top 25% of the survival distribution live at least 
50% longer (12 years or more). Importantly, these results indicate that having 
some individuals reach exceptionally old age does not imply that the majority of 
the population is living longer. In addition, estimates of lifespan inequality 
at older ages suggests that years of life lost because of death have increased 
in recent times and among recently born cohorts leading to an increase 
uncertainty in the age at death at older ages. Thus, slow survival improvements 
at ages 65+ suggest that most of the population is unlikely to reach long life 
expectancies in the near future, which may lead to lower than expected fraction 
of adults reaching older ages.

With increased life expectancy at birth and especially the rising incidence of 
age-related macular degeneration, low vision (re)habilitation is becoming more 
important today. Important factors to consider when presenting rehabilitation 
and treatment options to patients presenting to low vision centers include the 
diagnosis of the underlying disease, the patient’s age, their existing visual 
functions (especially distance and near visual acuity), whether visual loss is 
central or peripheral, whether their disease is progressive or not, the 
patient’s education level, and their expectations from us. Low vision patients 
must be guided to the right centers at the appropriate age, with appropriate 
indications, and with realistic expectations, and the rehabilitation process 
must be carried out as a multidisciplinary collaboration.

Itch is often regarded as unpleasant or bothersome and is accompanied by 
symptoms of distress and impairments in daily life. The biopsychosocial model of 
chronic itch describes how psychological factors can contribute to the 
improvement or exacerbation of chronic itch and related scratching behaviour. 
Recent research underlines the important role of cognitive-affective information 
processing, such as attention, affect and expectancies. This may not only play a 
role for acute itch states, but may particularly apply to the process of itch 
chronification, for example, due to the vicious cycle in which these factors 
shape the experience of itch. The present paper focuses on new insights into the 
relation between itch and the cognitive-affective factors of attention, affect 
and expectancies. These factors are thought to play a possible aggravating role 
in itch in the long term and have received increasing attention in the recent 
empirical literature on maintaining and exacerbating factors for chronic 
physical symptoms. Possible psychophysiological and neurobiological pathways 
regarding these factors are discussed, as well as possible intervention methods.

Marginal zone lymphomas: second most common lymphomas in older patients.

Bron D(1), Meuleman N; Eurobloodnet for rare diseases and EHA SWG ‘Aging and 
Hematology’.

Author information:

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Choosing an optimal treatment in older patients with indolent 
lymphomas is a challenge for hematooncologists. They must concomitantly treat 
some potentially curable entities, manage other symptomatic incurable diseases 
and protect their patients from life-threatening toxicities. Specific 
recommendations for older patients with different subtypes of marginal zone 
lymphomas are thus required in terms of treatment and supportive care.
RECENT FINDINGS: All the data in the literature agree that the therapeutic 
approach of older patients with malignant hemopathies should include the 
appraisal of their life expectancy and of the prognostic factors of their tumor, 
the evaluation of their physiological and cognitive functions and their 
socioeconomic environment, and their expectancy in terms of quality of life. 
Major progresses have, therefore, been achieved in the management of lymphoma 
patients of 80 years and older.
SUMMARY: With an optimal 'geriatric assessment', most of the recommended 
treatments are also appropriate in older marginal zone lymphoma patients. 
Extranodal MALT lymphoma: eradication of the pathogen is a major part of the 
first-line therapy. Prognosis is excellent in early stages. In advanced stages, 
observation and anti-CD20 antibodies with or without cytostatic drugs are 
recommended. Nodal MZL: Usually confined to lymph nodes, bone marrow and 
peripheral blood, they should be managed as follicular lymphomas. Splenic MZL: 
in this unique entity involving the spleen, the bone marrow and the peripheral 
blood. Hepatitis infection should be eradicated before considering treatment. 
Only symptomatic patients require to be treated by splenectomy and/or anti-CD20 
antibodies.

INTRODUCTION: The Temprano and START trials provided evidence to support early 
ART initiation recommendations. We projected long-term clinical and economic 
outcomes of immediate ART initiation in Côte d'Ivoire.
METHODS: We used a mathematical model to compare three potential ART initiation 
criteria: 1) CD4 <350/μL (ART<350/μL); 2) CD4 <500/μL (ART<500/μL); and 3) ART 
at presentation (Immediate ART). Outcomes from the model included life 
expectancy, 10-year medical resource use, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) in $/year of life saved (YLS), and 5-year budget impact. We simulated 
people with HIV (PWH) in care (mean CD4: 259/μL, SD 198/μL) and transmitted 
cases. Key input parameters to the analysis included first-line ART efficacy 
(80% suppression at 6 months) and ART cost ($90/person-year). We assessed 
cost-effectiveness relative to Côte d'Ivoire's 2017 per capita annual gross 
domestic product ($1,600).
RESULTS: Immediate ART increased life expectancy by 0.34 years compared to 
ART<350/μL and 0.17 years compared to ART<500/μL. Immediate ART resulted in 
4,500 fewer 10-year transmissions per 170,000 PWH compared to ART<350/μL. In 
cost-effectiveness analysis, Immediate ART had a 10-year ICER of $680/YLS 
compared to ART<350/μL, ranging from cost-saving to an ICER of $1,440/YLS as 
transmission rates varied. ART<500/μL was "dominated" (an inefficient use of 
resources), compared with Immediate ART. Immediate ART increased the 5-year HIV 
care budget from $801.9M to $812.6M compared to ART<350/μL.
CONCLUSIONS: In Côte d'Ivoire, immediate compared to later ART initiation will 
increase life expectancy, decrease HIV transmission, and be cost-effective over 
the long-term, with modest budget impact. Immediate ART initiation is an 
appropriate, high-value standard of care in Côte d'Ivoire and similar settings.

BACKGROUND: This study estimated the long-term changes of opioid agonist 
treatment (OAT) in quality of life (QOL) and quantified the quality-adjusted 
life years (QALY) from the loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) in 
heroin users.
METHODS: A total of 1283 heroin users stratified by OAT were linked to the 
National Mortality Registry for 8 years (2006-2014) to obtain survival 
functions, which were extrapolated to lifetime by applying a rolling 
extrapolation algorithm to survival ratio between the sub-cohorts and age- and 
sex-matched referents simulated from vital statistics of Taiwan. We performed 
cross-sectional measurement of EQ-5D on 349 participants, including those with a 
valid state of OAT or non-OAT plus newly recruited consecutive patients, during 
2015-2017 for utility values, while the QOL of referents were abstracted from 
the 2009 National Health Interview Survey. The QALE was calculated by summing 
the products of the mean QOL and survival rate throughout life. The QALE 
difference between the cohort and corresponding referents was the loss-of-QALE.
RESULTS: QOL of the OAT group was significantly better than that of the non-OAT 
group in every domain of the EQ-5D, which was quantified to be 0.23 for utility 
after controlling for other variables. After extrapolation to 70 years, the 
estimated QALE and loss-of-QALE were 17.8 and 18.2 QALY for OAT subjects, 
respectively, while those of the non-OAT group were 9.2 and 27.9 QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: Receiving OAT could reduce QALE lost by 9.7 QALYs compared with 
non-OAT after accounting for QOL differences along time and different age and 
sex distributions.

Structural colour QR codes for multichannel information storage with enhanced 
optical security and life expectancy.

Abdolahi M, Jiang H, Kaminska B.

Current schemes for encoding and decoding anticounterfeiting optical quick 
response (QR) codes involve miscellaneous challenges. The need for using 
multiple light sources to read out the wavelength-multiplexed data from 
optically encoded organic dyes, photoblinking from quantum dots, and 
autofluorescence from carbon dots are some typical examples. In order to address 
these restrictions, we exploited our previously devised 
nanoimprinting-exposure-thermal-treatment (NETT) data storage approach to 
present a new structural-colour-based regime for optical encoding of 
high-security QR codes. The angle-dependent readability of our diffraction-based 
nanostructures poses an enhanced optical security feature that can substitute 
the existing inefficient encoding strategies by eliminating the constraints 
associated with them. Additionally, in comparison with conventional optical 
encoding media, using the long-lasting photocrosslinked SU-8 in the NETT method 
considerably enhances the life expectancy of the proposed QR codes. Also, 
considering the rapid NETT-based Ni stamp origination method, which was 
previously introduced by our group, mass-generation of the proposed codes is 
feasible. Owing to the special optically variable effects provided by the 
nanostructures, duplication of our QR codes is very difficult. The colour code 
design, which embeds 766 characters in 2907 modules in red, green and blue 
channels, was generated and fabricated onto generic nanostructure arrays using 
the NETT process. The encoded information was successfully read out from the 
pattern using a broadband light source and a digital camera. Higher capacities 
are also deemed to be reachable by implementing image processing and machine 
learning algorithms to overcome in-channel module recognition and cross-channel 
interferences.

A healthy diet improves life expectancy and helps to prevent common chronic 
diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. The mechanisms driving these 
effects are not fully understood, but are likely to involve epigenetics. 
Epigenetic mechanisms control gene expression, maintaining the DNA sequence, and 
therefore the full genomic information inherited from our parents, unchanged. An 
interesting feature of epigenetic changes lies in their dynamic nature and 
reversibility. Accordingly, they are susceptible to correction through targeted 
interventions. Here we will review the evidence supporting a role for 
nutritional factors in mediating metabolic disease risk through DNA methylation 
changes. Special emphasis will be placed on the potential of using DNA 
methylation traits as biomarkers to predict risk of obesity and T2D as well as 
on their response to dietary and pharmacological (epi-drug) interventions.

To inform public health policy and research, we analyzed the patterns of life 
lost to cancers and evaluated the cancer burden in China. Based on the published 
Chinese Cancer Registry Annual Report and related literature in 2013, we 
calculated the cancer-related mortality and potential years of life lost (PYLL) 
by age, sex, districts (urban or rural), to describe the patterns of life lost 
to cancers. The high death-risk cancers in China were lung, liver, stomach, 
esophageal, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, brain and nervous system, and 
ovarian cancers, and leukemia. Liver and esophageal cancers were more prominent 
among males, while breast and colorectal cancers were more prevalent among 
females. The most obvious differences of mortality between urban and rural areas 
were found in liver, esophageal, and colorectal cancers. Cancer-related 
mortality increased significantly after the age of 30 years, and peaking at 
70-79 years. The PYLL rate of cancer in urban areas was higher than that in 
rural areas (21.49 vs. 19.20/1000), and significant regional and gender 
differences of PYLL ranks can be observed. For people aged over 60 years, cancer 
PYLL mainly came from lung, stomach, and esophageal cancers; for middle-aged 
people, it was mainly induced by liver, colorectal, and female reproductive 
systems' cancers; and for those under 30 years, life lost to cancer was mainly 
caused by leukemia and brain, nervous system cancers. Moreover, disparities in 
age distribution of PYLL from different regions and sexes can be found. In 
short, three categories of people, including those in urban areas, males and 
people over 60 years, were suffering from more serious cancer deaths and life 
lost. These variations pose considerable challenges for the Chinese health care 
system, and comprehensive measures are required for cancer prevention and 
treatment.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic acidosis, a complication of chronic kidney disease, causes 
protein catabolism and bone demineralisation and is associated with adverse 
kidney outcomes and mortality. Veverimer, a non-absorbed, counterion-free, 
polymeric drug candidate selectively binds and removes hydrochloric acid from 
the gastrointestinal lumen.
METHODS: We did a multicentre, randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled, 40-week 
extension of a 12-week parent study at 29 sites (hospitals and specialty 
clinics) in seven countries (Bulgaria, Georgia, Hungary, Serbia, Slovenia, 
Ukraine, and the USA). Eligible patients were those with chronic kidney disease 
(estimated glomerular filtration rate 20-40 mL/min per 1·73 m2) and metabolic 
acidosis (serum bicarbonate 12-20 mmol/L), who had completed the 12-week parent 
study, for which they were randomly assigned (4:3) to veverimer (6 g/day) or 
placebo as oral suspensions in water with food. Participants in the extension 
continued with the same treatment assignment as in the parent study. The primary 
endpoint was safety; the four secondary endpoints assessed the long-term effects 
of veverimer on serum bicarbonate concentration and physical functioning. The 
safety analysis set was defined as all patients who received any amount of study 
drug. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03390842, and 
has now completed.
FINDINGS: Participants entered the study between Dec 20, 2017, and May 4, 2018. 
Of the 217 patients randomly assigned to treatment in the parent study (124 to 
veverimer and 93 to placebo), 196 patients (114 veverimer and 82 placebo) 
continued on their blinded randomised treatment assignment into this 40-week 
extension study. Compared with placebo, fewer patients on veverimer discontinued 
treatment prematurely (3% vs 10%, respectively), and no patients on veverimer 
discontinued because of an adverse event. Serious adverse events occurred in 2% 
of veverimer-treated patients and in 5% of placebo patients (two of whom died). 
Renal system adverse events were reported in 8% and 15% in the veverimer and 
placebo groups, respectively. More patients on veverimer than placebo had an 
increase in bicarbonate (≥4 mmol/L or normalisation) at week 52 (63% vs 38%, 
p=0·0015) and higher bicarbonate concentrations were observed with veverimer 
than placebo at all timepoints starting at week 1 (p<0·001). Veverimer resulted 
in improved patient-reported physical functioning (Kidney Disease and Quality of 
Life-Physical Function Domain) versus placebo with a mean placebo-subtracted 
change at end of treatment of 12·1 points (SE 3·3; p<0·0001). Time to do the 
repeat chair stand test improved by 4·3 s (1·2) on veverimer versus 1·4 s (1·2) 
on placebo (p<0·0001).
INTERPRETATION: In patients with chronic kidney disease and metabolic acidosis, 
veverimer safely and effectively corrected metabolic acidosis and improved 
subjective and objective measures of physical function.

BACKGROUND: Public health is a priority for the Chinese Government. 
Evidence-based decision making for health at the province level in China, which 
is home to a fifth of the global population, is of paramount importance. This 
analysis uses data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study (GBD) 2017 to help inform decision making and monitor progress on 
health at the province level.
METHODS: We used the methods in GBD 2017 to analyse health patterns in the 34 
province-level administrative units in China from 1990 to 2017. We estimated 
all-cause and cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived 
with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), summary exposure 
values (SEVs), and attributable risk. We compared the observed results with 
expected values estimated based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
FINDINGS: Stroke and ischaemic heart disease were the leading causes of death 
and DALYs at the national level in China in 2017. Age-standardised DALYs per 
100 000 population decreased by 33·1% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 29·8 to 
37·4) for stroke and increased by 4·6% (-3·3 to 10·7) for ischaemic heart 
disease from 1990 to 2017. Age-standardised stroke, ischaemic heart disease, 
lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and liver cancer were the 
five leading causes of YLLs in 2017. Musculoskeletal disorders, mental health 
disorders, and sense organ diseases were the three leading causes of YLDs in 
2017, and high systolic blood pressure, smoking, high-sodium diet, and ambient 
particulate matter pollution were among the leading four risk factors 
contributing to deaths and DALYs. All provinces had higher than expected DALYs 
per 100 000 population for liver cancer, with the observed to expected ratio 
ranging from 2·04 to 6·88. The all-cause age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 
population were lower than expected in all provinces in 2017, and among the top 
20 level 3 causes were lower than expected for ischaemic heart disease, 
Alzheimer's disease, headache disorder, and low back pain. The largest 
percentage change at the national level in age-standardised SEVs among the top 
ten leading risk factors was in high body-mass index (185%, 95% UI 113·1 to 
247·7]), followed by ambient particulate matter pollution (88·5%, 66·4 to 
116·4).
INTERPRETATION: China has made substantial progress in reducing the burden of 
many diseases and disabilities. Strategies targeting chronic diseases, 
particularly in the elderly, should be prioritised in the expanding Chinese 
health-care system.

BACKGROUND: The increase in life expectancy along with the obesity epidemic has 
led to an increase in the number of older patients undergoing bariatric surgery. 
There is conflicting evidence regarding the safety of performing bariatric 
procedures on older patients.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the safety of laparoscopic 
sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) for older patients 
(>65 yr).
SETTING: Nationwide analysis of accredited centers.
METHODS: The Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality 
Improvement Program 2015 to 2017 database was used to identify nonrevisional 
laparoscopic RYGB and SG procedures. Comparisons were made based on patient age. 
Clinical outcomes included postoperative events and mortality.
RESULTS: There was a total 13,422 and 5395 matched pairs for SG and RYGB in 
comparing patients aged 18 years to those aged 65 and >65 years, respectively, 
and 5395 matched RYGB and SG procedures performed in patients >65 years. The 
complication rate was higher in older patients undergoing RYGB compared with SG 
(risk difference = 2.39%, 95% confidence interval: 1.57%-3.21%, P < .0001). When 
comparing older to younger patients, the older group had a higher complication 
rate for SG but not for RYGB (SG: risk difference = 1.01%, 95% confidence 
interval: .59%-1.43%, P < .0001, RYGB: risk difference = .59%, 95% confidence 
interval: -.29% to 1.47%, P = .2003).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall complication rates of bariatric surgery are low in patients 
>65 years. SG appears to have a favorable safety profile in this patient 
population compared with RYGB. The overall complication rate for RYGB is not 
significantly different between the older and younger groups.

School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

OBJECTIVES: The difference between income quintiles in health is relatively well 
accepted by the general public as a measure of health inequality. However, the 
slope index of inequality (SII) in health reflects the patterns of all social 
groups, including the middle 60%, and it could therefore be considered more 
academically desirable. If these two measures are closely correlated, the 
widespread use of the difference between income quintiles in health would be 
better supported. This study was conducted to compare differences between income 
quintiles in life expectancy (LE) and healthy life expectancy (HLE) with the 
SII.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison using correlational analysis of district 
level income differences in LE and HLE with associated SII.
SETTING: All 252 subnational districts of Korea.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 342 439 895 subjects (171 287 729 men, 171 152 166 
women) and 1 753 476 deaths (970 928 men, 782 548 women) between 2008 and 2014 
were analysed.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Difference in LE and HLE by income 
quintile and associated SII.
RESULTS: The Pearson correlation coefficients between differences between income 
quintiles and the SII were generally high: 0.97 (95% CI 0.96 to 0.98) for LE in 
men and women combined and 0.96 (95% CI 0.94 to 0.97) for HLE in men and women 
combined. In most districts, the SII was greater than the difference between 
income quintiles.
CONCLUSION: Differences between income quintiles were closely correlated with 
the SII. The widespread use of differences between income quintiles in health as 
a measure of health inequality may be preferable for communicating results of 
health inequality measurements to the public.
