Locomotor training based in virtual reality (VR) is promising for motor skill 
learning, with transfer of VR skills in turn required to benefit daily life 
locomotion. This study aimed to assess whether VR-adapted obstacle avoidance can 
be transferred to a physical obstacle and whether such transfer is retained 
after 1 week. Thirty-two young adults were randomly divided between two groups. 
A control group (CG) merely walked on a treadmill and an intervention group (IG) 
trained crossing 50 suddenly-appearing virtual obstacles. Both groups crossed 
three physical obstacles (transfer task) immediately after training (T1) and 
1 week later (T2, transfer retention). Repeated practice in VR led to a decrease 
in toe clearance along with greater ankle plantarflexion and knee extension. IG 
participants crossed physical obstacles with a lower toe clearance compared to 
CG but revealed significantly higher values compared to the VR condition. VR 
adaptation was fully retained over 1 week. For physical obstacle avoidance there 
were differences between toe clearance of the third obstacle at T1 and the first 
obstacle at T2, indicating only partial transfer retention. We suggest that 
perception-action coupling, and thus sensorimotor coordination, may differ 
between VR and the physical world, potentially limiting retained transfer 
between conditions.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease/dementia (AD) prevalence is of concern globally 
and in Canada owing to the rapidly aging population and increase in life 
expectancy. This study explored: (1) trends in the overall prevalence of 
self-reported AD/dementia by sex, age groups, educational levels, and geographic 
areas in Canada from 1994 to 2014, and (2) assessed what the observed trends 
mean in the context of the aging Canadian population and the health care system.
DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study used Canadian national survey 
data. Data for this study were from two Canadian national health surveys 
(National Population Health Survey and the Canadian Community Health Survey), 
between 1994 and 2014. After age-sex standardization, trends in the prevalence 
of self-reported Alzheimer's disease/dementia were tracked over time. The two 
cross-sectional surveys used similar diagnostic criteria over the years.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of Alzheimer's disease/dementia increased from 
0.14 in 1994 to 0.80 in 2014 representing a 0.66-point increase over the 
20 years. Alzheimer's disease/dementia prevalence increased with age across all 
years but was more pronounced after age 80. Men 65+ years, those with lower 
education, and Canadians living in Central Canada had an increased prevalence.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of Alzheimer's disease/dementia in the 
community increased over time. This study highlights the importance of 
establishing effective community-based prevention strategies that focus on 
minimizing risk and optimizing protection as well as health system capacity 
strengthening and preparation for long-term care including increased demand for 
neurologists' services, increased associated disability, psychosocial 
difficulties, rising costs, and caregiver burden.

The introduction and rapid uptake of CFTR modulator therapy, in addition to 
other treatments, has significantly increased life expectancy in CF and provided 
more women the opportunity to consider and successfully be managed throughout 
pregnancy. There is however limited evidence to guide patient management and 
enable informed decision making. Here we report the experience to date from a 
large multidisciplinary Cystic Fibrosis quaternary referral center in managing 
patients on CFTR modulators in the peri- and post-partum periods. While women in 
this case series were advised to discontinue CFTR modulators during pregnancy, 
they would likely receive a very different message today.

OBJECTIVE: Optimal wrist/hand function facilitates the performance of activities 
of daily living (ADL), which are associated with independent living and 
increased quality of life. Rheumatological, musculoskeletal, and neurological 
conditions or injuries can negatively impact hand/wrist function, with 
wrist-hand orthoses (WHOs) being prescribed to control motion and improve wrist 
alignment whilst enhancing hand/wrist functionality. The objective of this 
follow-up study was to quantify and assess the efficacy and functionality of 10 
commercially available WHOs during five ADLs.
DESIGN: Randomised comparative functional study of the wrist/hand with and 
without WHOs.
PARTICIPANTS: Ten right-handed healthy female participants with no underlying 
condition or pain affecting the wrist/hand that could influence their ability to 
undertake ADLs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was ascertaining the impact of each 
WHO during five ADLs. Movement was quantified in sagittal, coronal, and 
transverse planes with and without WHO use. The resting position, maximum mean 
flexion, extension, pronation, supination, and radial and ulnar deviation 
attained were quantified, with the time spent in wrist flexion, wrist flexion 
and ulnar deviation, wrist extension >15°, and radial deviation recorded. 
Finally, the time to complete each task was compared between conditions.
RESULTS: At rest, four WHOs maintained the desired sagittal plane wrist 
position, with only one preventing radial deviation with variation observed in 
the transverse plane. All WHOs reduced mean maximum flexion, with only 10 out of 
50 tests (20%) showing a successful restriction of flexion (p < 0.05) and 14 out 
of 50 (28%) showing a reduction of the time spent in flexion (p < 0.05). In 42 
out of 50 tests (84%), the wrist was extended >15° for a significant amount of 
time (p < 0.05), with the wrist in radial deviation in 98% for a significant 
amount of time (p < 0.001). The wrist was flexed and in ulnar deviation for a 
significant time for 6 out of 50 tests (12%, p < 0.05), whilst all WHOs impacted 
transverse movement, with 27% reducing it significantly, and all tasks took a 
longer time to complete, with 46% taking a significantly longer time (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The WHOs did not control movement sufficiently to successfully 
manage any condition requiring motion restriction associated with pain relief 
and were found to increase the time to complete the ADLs. Multifactorial design 
aspects influenced functionality, and there is a clear need for WHO redesign.

Bone metastasis is one of the comorbidities of advanced lung cancer, eventually 
leading to an impaired quality of life. We present a case of a lung 
adenocarcinoma patient with synchronous bone metastasis. The patient possessed a 
superior survival time of more than five years under multidisciplinary 
treatment. Considering the balance of life expectancy and limb function, the 
metastatic site on the right humerus was successively surgically managed. Based 
on the present case, we emphasized the importance of treatment choice between 
anti-tumor and bone management in the long-term survival of cancer patients with 
synchronous bone metastasis.

Iron levels are closely related to animals' growth performance and anti-oxidant 
function. Lactoferrin (LF) is an iron-binding glycoprotein, which can promote 
the absorption of iron and regulate immune function. This study aimed to clarify 
the effect of maternal LF supplementation on the iron metabolism of Dahe 
piglets. Sixty sows (Dahe black, parity 3-4, no significant differences in body 
weight) were randomly assigned to five groups: control (basal diet with no iron 
supplementation), supplemented 100 (LF1 group), 200 (LF2 group), or 300 (LF3 
group) mg LF/kg in the basal diet, and the basal diet supplemented with 100 
(Fe-Gly group) mg Fe/kg as ferrous glycine (Fe-Gly). The serum anti-oxidant 
parameters of the sows and neonatal piglets were determined. The iron contents, 
anti-oxidant gene expression levels, and Fe-acquisition genes were detected in 
the liver, heart, spleen, and other neonatal organs. The results indicated that 
(1) the LF3 group of sows had the highest serum and colostrum iron contents (P < 
0.05). The maternal LF significantly promoted the iron stores in the heart, 
liver, spleen, and lung of piglets compared with Fe-Gly. (2) The maternal LF 
increased serum glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and total superoxide dismutase 
(T-SOD) activities of sows. Compared with other groups, the total anti-oxidant 
capacity (T-AOC) activity of LF2 groups increased significantly (P < 0.05). (3) 
LF significantly increased piglet serum GSH-Px, T-SOD, and T-AOC activities (P < 
0.05). (4) Gene expression levels of GSH-Px, and SOD in the duodenum and jejunum 
of the LF2 group were significantly higher than in the Fe-Gly group (P < 0.05), 
while the expression levels in the liver and heart were lower (P < 0.05). (5) 
The expression levels of hepcidin and LF in the liver and duodenum of the LF2 
group were significantly higher than in the Fe-Gly group (P < 0.05). In 
conclusion, maternal LF supplementation showed remarkable effects on iron 
storage in neonatal piglets, and exhibited strong antioxidant activities, it is 
helpful to prevent the occurrence of iron deficiency, and improves the immune 
function of animals.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to explore the epidemiological trends of 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) over the past three decades in China and 
further predict the trends of IBD in the next 25 years.
METHODS: The prevalence, incidence, mortality, years of life lived with 
disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs), and annual percentage changes of the above metrics of IBD in China from 
1990 to 2019 were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. The 
corresponding trends in the next 25 years were predicted.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2019, the cases of IBD in China raised to 484 thousand 
[95% uncertainty interval (UI) 411-571] and 427 thousand (366-498) among males 
and females, respectively. The age-standardized incidence rate of IBD increased 
from 1.72 per 100,000 population (1.44-2.05) to 3.35 per 100,000 population 
(2.88-3.88) among males and from 1.20 per 100,000 population (1.02-1.42) to 2.65 
per 100,000 population (2.29-3.08) among females. The highest incidence rate 
occurred in people aged 35-39 years. The total YLDs attributed to IBD 
significantly increased, but the YLLs showed a decreasing trend, resulting in 
minor alterations of the DALYs. In the next 25 years, the incidence of IBD would 
continue to increase until a plateau by 2030, and IBD-related deaths would also 
increase to about 7.57 thousand by 2044 despite the decreasing age-standardized 
mortality rate. Similar trends were observed for both sexes, with a slight male 
predominance.
CONCLUSIONS: Although China is still a low-endemic area of IBD, the prevalence 
and incidence of IBD dramatically increased in the past three decades. The 
burden of IBD in China is expected to grow continuously in the next 25 years due 
to the large population base and severe aging problem. China is estimated to 
enter the Compounding Prevalence stage around 2030.

INTRODUCTION: On January 12, 2010, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck the 
Republic of Haiti. The human cost was enormous-an estimated 316,000 people were 
killed, and a further 300,000 were injured. The scope of the disaster was 
matched by the scope of the response, which remains the largest multinational 
humanitarian response to date. An extensive scoping review of the relevant 
literature was undertaken, to identify studies that discussed the civilian and 
military disaster relief efforts. The aim was to highlight the key-lessons 
learned, that can be applied to future disaster response practise.
METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses 
extension for Scoping Reviews guidance was followed. Seven scientific databases 
were searched, using consistent search terms-followed by an analysis of the 
existent Haitian literature. This process was supplemented by reviewing 
available grey literature. A total of 2,671 articles were reviewed, 106 of which 
were included in the study. In-depth analysis was structured, by aligning data 
to 12 key-domains, whilst also considering cross-sector interaction 
(Civilian-Civilian, Military-Military, and Civilian-Military). Dominant themes 
and lessons learned were identified and recorded in an online spreadsheet by an 
international research team. This study focuses on explicitly analysing the 
medical aspects of the humanitarian response.
RESULTS: An unpreceded collaborative effort between non-governmental 
organisations, international militaries, and local stakeholders, led to a 
substantial number of disaster victims receiving life and limb-saving care. 
However, the response was not faultless. Relief efforts were complicated by 
large influxes of inexperienced actors, inadequate preliminary needs 
assessments, a lack of pre-existing policy regarding conduct and inter-agency 
collaboration, and limited consideration of post-disaster redevelopment during 
initial planning. Furthermore, one critical theme that bridged all aspects of 
the disaster response, was the failure of the international community to ensure 
Haitian involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: No modern disaster has yet been as devastating as the 2010 Haiti 
earthquake. Given the ongoing climate crisis, as well as the risks posed by 
armed conflict-this will not remain the case indefinitely. This systematic 
analysis of the combined civilian and military disaster response, offers vital 
evidence for informing future medical relief efforts-and provides considerable 
opportunity to advance knowledge pertaining to disaster response.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of burden 
estimates and the secular trend of blindness and vision loss, as measured by 
years lived with disability (YLDs), at the global, regional, and national 
levels.
METHODS: The age-standardized YLD rates (ASYRs) due to blindness and vision loss 
and its subtypes, including moderate vision loss, severe vision loss, blindness, 
and presbyopia, from 1990 to 2019 were extracted from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study 2019 database. The estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) 
were calculated to quantify the temporal trends in the ASYRs due to blindness 
and vision loss.
RESULTS: In 2019, the global ASYRs per 100,000 population was 327.98 for 
blindness and vision loss, specifically, 85.81 for moderate vision loss, 74.86 
for severe vision loss, 95.03 for blindness, and 62.27 for presbyopia. From 1990 
to 2019, the ASYRs due to blindness and vision loss slightly decreased. Females 
showed higher ASYRs than males in 2019. The global highest ASYRs were observed 
in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Negative associations were found between 
the burden estimates of blindness and vision loss and the sociodemographic index 
levels. The EAPCs of ASYRs in blindness and vision loss were significantly 
negatively correlated with the ASYRs in 1990 and positively correlated with 
human development indices in 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: Globally, blindness and vision loss continue to cause great losses 
of healthy life. Reasonable resource allocation and health-service planning are 
needed for the prevention and early intervention of disabilities caused by 
vision loss.

City, Edo State, Nigeria.

BACKGROUND: The periodic determination of the degree to which coroner's 
postmortems done for medicolegal purpose turns out to be natural death is 
desirable because of its usefulness to health administrators in making policies 
that may ultimately help in focusing on the prevention/management of the causes 
of natural death at that particular point in time.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the causes of natural 
death by a retrospective analysis of coroner's postmortem cases carried out on 
patients ages 19 years and above who died from natural causes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3-year period, retrospective postmortem study was 
carried out at the Department of Anatomic Pathology, University of Benin 
Teaching Hospital on 530 medicolegal postmortem cases ages 19 and above who died 
from natural causes.
RESULTS: Natural deaths were observed in 530 cases of medicolegal postmortems. 
Their age ranged from 19 years to 104 years with a mean age and standard 
deviation of 52.82 ± 16.71 years. Cardiovascular system diseases were the most 
common causes of natural deaths with hypertensive heart disease being the most 
common underlining cause. Infections and diseases of the respiratory, 
gastrointestinal system/hepatic, central nervous and endocrine systems were also 
noteworthy.
CONCLUSIONS: Most causes of natural deaths were in the middle ages with the 
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) accounting for a significant proportion. To 
reduce premature death from NCDs by 2030, the World Health Organization (WHO) is 
promoting its prevention and management. It is our desire that our health 
administrators would adopt this WHO model incorporating postmortem-based data 
for planning of medical services.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Aging refers to a progressive decrease in functional 
performance, leading to increased mortality risk. At present, life expectancy is 
increasing worldwide and is expected to exceed 80 years by 2040. However, this 
increase in life expectancy also indicates a rise in the incidence and 
prevalence of diseases, such as cardiovascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, 
and oncological diseases, which are associated with aging. The exact underlying 
mechanisms of aging remain unknown, and whether it is a programmed process or 
the consequence of an accumulation of stress events remains unclear. Thus, more 
scientific research is needed to improve the management of complex and frail 
patients.
METHODS: Several databases were searched with the following key words: 
immunosenescence, inflamm-aging, frailty, sarcopenia and skeletal muscle, etc.
KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Skeletal muscle is the core phenotype of frailty and 
sarcopenia. Immune aging and skeletal muscle decline interplay with each other 
and form a vicious circle. Maintaining muscle health is beneficial for immune 
function and delays the onset of frailty. Particularly, in the context of the 
ongoing corona virus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, studies have shown that the 
elderly are more prone to the consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It has been 
reported that the rates of hospitalization in the 65-74, 75-84, and ≥85 years 
old group were 5×, 8×, and 10× greater than the 18-29 years old group, with 
corresponding COVID-19-related deaths being 60×, 140×, and 330× that of the 
younger reference group, respectively. Considering the above, this review aims 
to discuss the relationship between immunosenescence, skeletal muscle, and 
frailty, and to explore immunosenescence as a potential therapeutic target to 
prevent frailty and extend healthspan, with some emphasis on the effects of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on the elderly.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunosenescence is a promising potential therapeutic target for 
frailty and is worthy of further investigation.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is taking a staggering toll on healthcare systems 
worldwide, with the bulk of the expenditures invested in the late stages of the 
disease. Considering the rising life expectancy and the increasing prevalence of 
PD across the globe, a clear understanding of the early signs and treatment 
options available for advanced PD (APD), will facilitate tailoring management 
programs and support services. This task is complicated by the lack of both 
global consensus in defining APD and standardized care guidelines. This 
perspective prepared by a panel of movement disorder specialists, proposes to 
extend and optimize currently accepted PD coding to better reflect the diverse 
disease manifestations, with emphasis on non-motor features. The panel seeks to 
promote timely diagnosis by adjustment of evaluation tools for use by community 
neurologists and suggests modification of eligibility criteria for advanced 
therapy. Moreover, it advocates multidisciplinary assessments of APD patients to 
drive personalized, patient-centered and holistic management. Overall, earlier 
and more targeted intervention is expected to markedly improve patient quality 
of life.

INTRODUCTION: Malignant otitis externa is a life-threatening infectious 
pathology that occurs mainly in diabetic patients; in a picture of otorrhea, 
with facial paralysis. We report the case of a necrotizing otitis externa, 
treated with antibiotics, which was complicated a few months later by spinal 
compression.
OBSERVATION: This is the case of a 60-year-old patient, diabetic, who presented 
a painful otorrhea associated to left facial palsy.The diagnosis of necrotizing 
otitis externa was retained after performing a CT scan of the temporal bone.6 
months after medical treatment, the patient became has been complicated by 
tetraparesis with respiratory distress.
DISCUSSION: Necrotizing otitis externa is an osteitis of the base of the skull, 
which occurs in the diabetic patient and which starts in the external ear and 
spreads by contiguity after infection of the temporal bone.It represented 
clinically by otalgia and purulent otorrhea.The role of imaging is to confirm 
the involvement and to specify the extension of the lesions. CT scan is useful 
to evaluate the bone involvement. MRI is the examination of choice for the study 
of soft tissues and is essential in advanced forms.Its treatment is based on 
antibiotic therapy for a minimum of 6 weeks.
CONCLUSION: OEM is an infection occurring in elderly and diabetic patients. 
Imaging allows to confirm the diagnosis and to carry out the assessment of 
extension; but also has a great interest in the follow-up of these 
immunocompromised patients who are subject to complications with insidious 
evolution.

OBJECTIVES: The length of retirement life may be highly unequal due to 
persistent and significant discrepancies in old-age mortality. This study 
assesses gender and educational differences in the average retirement life span 
and the variation in retirement life span, taking into account individual labor 
force exit and reentry dynamics.
METHODS: We used longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study from 
1996 to 2016, focusing on respondents aged 50 and older (N = 32,228). Multistate 
life tables were estimated using discrete-time event history models. The average 
retirement life span, as well as absolute and relative variation in retirement 
life span, were calculated analytically.
RESULTS: Among women, we found a persistent educational gradient in average 
retirement life span over the whole period studied; among men, the relationship 
between education and retirement expectancy differed across periods. Women and 
the lower-educated had higher absolute variation in retirement life span than 
men and the higher-educated-yet these relationships were reversed when examined 
by relative variation.
DISCUSSION: Our multistate approach provides an accurate and comprehensive 
picture of the retirement life span of older Americans over the past two 
decades. Such findings should be considered in high-level discussions on Social 
Security. Potential reforms such as raising the eligibility age or cutting 
benefits may have unexpected implications for different social groups due to 
their differential effects on retirement initiation and reentry dynamics.

PURPOSE: Preference-based quality of life measures (PBMs) are used to generate 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in economic evaluations. A PBM consists of 
(1) a health state classification system and (2) a utility value set that allows 
the instrument responses to be converted to QALYs. A new, oral health-specific 
classification system, the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale-4D 
(ECOHIS-4D) has recently been developed. The aim of this study was to generate 
an Australian utility value set for the ECOHIS-4D.
METHODS: A discrete choice experiment with duration (DCETTO) was used as the 
preference elicitation technique. An online survey was administered to a 
representative sample of Australian adults over 18 years. Respondents were given 
14 choice tasks (10 tasks from the DCE design of 50 choice sets blocked into 
five blocks, 2 practice tasks, a repeated and a dominant task). Data were 
analyzed using the conditional logit model.
RESULTS: A total of 1201 respondents from the Australian general population 
completed the survey. Of them, 69% (n = 829) perceived their oral health status 
to be good, very good, or excellent. The estimated coefficients from the 
conditional logit models were in the expected directions and were statistically 
significant (p < 0.001). The utility values for health states defined by the 
ECOHIS-4D ranged from 0.0376 to 1.0000.
CONCLUSIONS: This newly developed utility value set will enable the calculation 
of utility values for economic evaluations of interventions related to oral 
diseases such as dental caries among young children. This will facilitate more 
effective resource allocation for oral health services.

Advancing age is associated with chronic diseases which are the largest cause of 
death and disability in developed countries. With increasing life expectancy and 
an ageing population, there is a need to conduct trials to extend healthy 
ageing, including targeting biological ageing processes, and prevent 
ageing-related diseases. The main objectives of the study are as follows: (i) to 
review outcome measures utilised in healthy ageing trials focusing on 
pharmacological therapies, nutritional supplements and medical devices; (ii) to 
summarise the views of key stakeholders on outcome selection for healthy ageing 
trials. An analysis of records from the Clinicaltrials.gov database pertaining 
to healthy ageing trials from inception to May 2022 was conducted. In addition, 
the findings of a workshop attended by key stakeholders at the 2022 annual 
UKSPINE conference were qualitatively analysed. Substantial heterogeneity was 
found in the interventions evaluated and the outcomes utilised by the included 
studies. Recruitment of participants with diverse backgrounds and the 
confounding effects of multi-morbidity in older adults were identified as the 
main challenges of measuring outcomes in healthy ageing trials by the workshop 
participants. The development of a core outcome set for healthy ageing trials 
can aid comparability across interventions and within different settings. The 
workshop provided an important platform to garner a range of perspectives on the 
challenges with measuring outcomes in this setting. It is critical to initiate 
such discussions to progress this field and provide practical answers to how 
healthy ageing trials are designed and structured in the future.
