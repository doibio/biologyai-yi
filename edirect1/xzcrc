OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) used for hemodialysis commonly undergo 
multiple percutaneous and open interventions to maintain functional patency, but 
it is unclear whether this strategy is cost-effective. The aim of this study was 
to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of performing 
repeated interventions vs starting a new AVF.
METHODS: We reviewed all patients with mature radiocephalic, brachiocephalic, 
and brachiobasilic AVFs at a single academic institution between 2007 and 2015 
and assessed the clinical effectiveness of each open and percutaneous 
intervention to maintain functional patency after the fistula was created. These 
data were used to parameterize a Markov simulation model to determine the 
cost-effectiveness for performing an open or percutaneous intervention vs 
creating an AVF at a new anatomic location. This model compared strategies of 
creating a new AVF after the first to fourth reintervention within a 1-year time 
window, with the reference being creation of a new AVF on the fourth 
reintervention. Costs were measured from Medicare's perspective, and 
effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and time in 
functional access. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated 
by taking the ratio of the difference in cost and the difference in 
effectiveness between two strategies.
RESULTS: A total of 720 AVFs that were created during the 8-year period reached 
maturity, and 407 (56%) underwent at least one intervention to maintain 
functional patency, with the median (interquartile range) time to first 
reintervention of 12.6 (10-17) months. For the strategies of creating a new AVF 
after the first versus the fourth reintervention, payer costs ranged from $3519 
to $3922 for open procedures and $2134 to $3922 for percutaneous procedures. The 
ICERs for open interventions on failing AVFs were $357,143/QALY after the first 
reintervention and $95,876/QALY after the second reintervention. The ICERs for 
percutaneous interventions on failing AVFs ranged from $1,522,078/QALY after the 
first reintervention to $443,243/QALY after the third reintervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Whereas the clinical effectiveness of performing percutaneous 
interventions on failing AVFs diminishes after each reintervention, they are 
nevertheless less costly than creating a new AVF. In comparison, our data show 
that creating a new AVF is cost-effective after the second open reintervention 
procedure.

BACKGROUND: Controversy exists surrounding gender outcome disparity and 
abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Previous reports have demonstrated worse 
outcomes for women undergoing open aneurysm repair (OAR); however, these 
differences are less evident with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). 
Epidemiologic studies have documented that women score higher on most frailty 
assessment scales but paradoxically have longer life expectancy compared to men. 
The interaction of gender/frailty and the influence on outcomes and practice 
patterns surrounding EVAR and OAR is poorly described. This analysis 
characterizes the association of frailty/sex interactions on mortality as well 
as patient selection surrounding elective AAA repair in the Society for Vascular 
Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative.
METHODS: All elective infrarenal AAA (EVAR + OAR; 2003-2017) cases were queried 
from the Vascular Quality Initiative database. Each patient was assigned a 
previously published modified frailty index (mFI) score derived from comorbidity 
and preoperative functional status data. Cox proportional hazard models, 
adjusted for statistically significant covariates, including procedural 
complexity, determined associations within full models and sex-stratified 
models.
RESULTS: A total of 20,750 elective AAA cases were analyzed (EVAR 15,893 [77%]; 
OAR 4857 [23%]). Thirty-day mortality for EVAR and OAR was 0.7% (n = 115) and 
3.5% (n = 169), respectively. Patients who died were significantly more likely 
to be older (EVAR, 78 vs 73 years; OAR, 74 vs 69 years; P < .0001), have larger 
AAA diameters (EVAR, 59 vs 56 mm; P = .005; OAR, 62 vs 59 mm; P = .001), higher 
mFI scores (EVAR, 3.2 vs 2.4; OAR, 3.1 vs 2.2; P < .0001), and be of female sex 
(EVAR hazard ratio = 1.66 [95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.52]; P = .007; 
OAR-1.43 [1.02-1.99]; P = .003). Significant differences in the gender 
distribution of frailty scores among EVAR patients were evident (mean mFI: male 
2.42 vs female 2.34; P = .02), but no difference was detected for OAR (male 2.17 
vs female 2.22; P = .38). The mFI was a strong independent predictor of 
mortality (30 days: EVAR hazard ratio = 1.36 [1.22-1.53] and OAR 1.46 
[1.32-1.60]; 1 year: EVAR 1.32 [1.25-1.39] and OAR-1.38 [1.28-1.48]). There was 
no interaction between mFI and gender on the association with mortality. Across 
frailty strata, male patients were nearly twofold more likely to undergo either 
elective EVAR or OAR for an AAA below recommended minimum diameter thresholds 
(male, <5.5 cm; female, <5.0 cm). Greater mFI score did not alter OAR selection 
but was associated with less frequent EVAR of small AAA.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the strong association between frailty and postoperative 
mortality, mFI can be used as a predictive tool to aid in surgical planning of 
patients undergoing elective AAA repair. While mFI can predict postoperative 
mortality for both men and women, it does not account for the survival disparity 
between sexes, and further research is warranted to explain this difference. 
There appear to be significant gender differences in patient selection based on 
current Society for Vascular Surgery-endorsed treatment thresholds that may have 
important implications on the appropriateness of AAA care delivery nationally.

OBJECTIVE: Device-specific data on the long-term efficacy of endovascular 
aneurysm repair (EVAR) are limited by the constant evolution of stent graft 
design. Whereas some modifications, such as barb-mediated fixation, probably 
enhance durability, others, such as thin-walled fabric, are of less certain 
benefit. The purpose of this study was to examine 15 years of a single-center 
experience of EVAR using the Zenith stent graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, 
Ind).
METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted of 325 high-risk patients who 
underwent elective EVAR with Zenith stent grafts between October 1998 and 
December 2005 under a physician-sponsored investigational device exemption. 
Patients' charts and death registries were reviewed to identify late stent graft 
failures and causes of death. Late stent graft failures were defined as type I 
or type III endoleaks; enlarging aneurysm sac requiring revision; and limb 
kinking or occlusion, stent graft infection, renal artery occlusion, or aneurysm 
rupture occurring >30 days after the index procedure.
RESULTS: The mean age at treatment was 75.9 ± 7.4 years, and 300 of 325 (92%) 
were men. The mean aneurysm diameter was 60 ± 9 mm, and the median main body 
stent graft diameter was 28 mm (range, 22-32 mm). During a median follow-up time 
of 5.6 years (interquartile range, 2.6-8.7 years), there were six (2%) 
aneurysm-related deaths caused by the following: one stent graft infection, one 
infection of a femoral-femoral bypass graft placed after limb occlusion, one 
infection of a stent graft placed to treat a type IB endoleak, and three 
aneurysm ruptures. There were 19 (6%) late stent graft failures occurring at a 
median time of 4.0 years (range, 39 days-14.6 years) after the procedure. 
Patients with late stent graft failure were more likely to have had impaired 
renal function (creatinine concentration ≥2 mg/dL; 21% vs 6%; P = .03) and less 
likely to have had cardiac disease (42% vs 67%; P = .04) at the time of the 
index procedure. There was no significant association between late stent graft 
failure and age, sex, aneurysm size, stent graft diameter, diabetes, smoking, or 
lung disease. Kaplan-Meier estimated overall survival was 60% at 5 years, 29% at 
10 years, and 12% at 15 years. Kaplan-Meier estimated freedom from 
aneurysm-related mortality was 98% at 5 years, 97% at 10 years, and 97% at 
15 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Late-occurring stent graft failures and aneurysm-related death are 
rare after EVAR using the Zenith stent graft, especially in high-risk patients 
whose comorbidities diminish life expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate excess mortality and life years lost in a Swiss cohort 
of individuals with traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI).
METHODS: This study uses population-based data collected in the Swiss Spinal 
Cord Injury Cohort (SwiSCI) study, which covers all specialized rehabilitation 
centres. Flexible parametric survival models were used to model life years 
remaining (LYR), potential years life lost (PYLL), relative survival and excess 
hazard ratios.
RESULTS: Men and women with TSCI and an attained age of 30 were estimated to 
have 42 LYR (95% CI = 37.9-45.5) and 43 LYR (95% CI = 40.1-45.5), respectively; 
this equates to a life expectancy (LE) of 80.6 and 76.9% of that of the Swiss 
general population. With respect to lesion level and completeness, persons with 
incomplete paraplegia had 45.1 LYR at an attained age of 30, whereas individuals 
with complete tetraplegia only had 28.7 LYR. This pattern was similar for PYLL.
CONCLUSIONS: The extended LE following TSCI, even for the most severe lesions, 
underscores the need for sustained follow-up to support functioning and health 
for individuals ageing with SCI.

BACKGROUND: National guidelines recommend against cancer screening for older 
individuals with less than a 10-year life expectancy, but it is unknown if this 
population desires ongoing screening.
OBJECTIVE: To determine (1) if older individuals with < 10-year life expectancy 
have future intentions for cancer screening, (2) if they recall a doctor 
previously suggesting that screening is no longer needed, and (3) individual 
characteristics associated with intentions to seek screening.
DESIGN: National Social life Health and Aging Project (2015-2016), a nationally 
representative, cross-sectional survey.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults 55-97 years old (n = 3816).
MAIN MEASURES: Self-reported: (1) mammography and PSA testing within the last 
2 years, (2) future intentions to be screened, and (3) discussion with a doctor 
that screening is no longer needed. Ten-year life expectancy was estimated using 
the Lee prognostic index. Multivariate logistic regression analysis examined 
intentions to pursue future screening, adjusting for sociodemographic and health 
covariates.
KEY RESULTS: Among women 75-84 with < 10-year life expectancy, 59% intend on 
future mammography and 81% recall no conversation with a doctor that mammography 
may no longer be necessary. Among men 75-84 with < 10-year life expectancy, 54% 
intend on future PSA screening and 77% recall no discussions that PSA screening 
may be unnecessary. In adjusted analyses, those reporting recent cancer 
screening or no recollection that screening may not be necessary were more 
likely to want future mammography or PSA screening (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Over 75% of older individuals with limited life expectancy intend to 
continue cancer screening, and less than 25% recall discussing with physicians 
the need for these tests. In addition to public health and education efforts, 
these results suggest that older adults' recollection of being told by 
physicians that screening is not necessary may be a modifiable risk factor for 
reducing overscreening in older adults with limited life expectancy.

INTRODUCTION: Evidence supports the clinical benefits of early aggressive 
biologic treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have an 
inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drugs (csDMARDs), but the cost-effectiveness of early intervention with 
originator biologics such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) or their 
biosimilars has not been well studied.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate lifetime costs and utilities 
for patients with established RA who do not respond to methotrexate (MTX) 
therapy. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted comparing a standard 
intervention pathway (addition of originator biologic TNFis to MTX monotherapy 
at 12 months) and two early intervention pathways (either addition of originator 
biologic TNFis or addition of biosimilar TNFis to MTX monotherapy at 6 months).
RESULTS: Early intervention with an originator biologic TNFi at 6 months was 
associated with increases in total lifetime costs of £1692 and utilities of 
0.10 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient compared with standard 
intervention at 12 months, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
(ICER) of £17,335/QALY. Early intervention with a biosimilar TNFi increased 
costs by £70 and utilities by 0.10 QALYs per patient and was associated with an 
ICER of £713/QALY.
CONCLUSION: Switching from MTX monotherapy to combination therapy with either an 
originator biologic or biosimilar TNFis at 6 months after csDMARD failure in 
patients with RA was cost-effective at a threshold of £30,000/QALY.

Androgen ablating drugs increase life expectancy in men with metastatic prostate 
cancer, but resistance inevitably develops. In a majority of these recurrent 
tumors, the androgen axis is reactivated in the form of increased androgen 
receptor (AR) expression. Targeting proteins that are expressed as a down-stream 
effect of AR activity is a promising rationale for management of this disease. 
The humanized IgG1 antibody hu11B6 internalizes into prostate and prostate 
cancer (PCa) cells by binding to the catalytic cleft of human kallikrein 2 
(hK2), a prostate specific enzyme governed by the AR-pathway. In a previous 
study, hu11B6 conjugated with Actinium-225 (225Ac), a high linear energy 
transfer (LET) radionuclide, was shown to generate an AR-upregulation driven 
feed-forward mechanism that is believed to enhance therapeutic efficacy. We 
assessed the efficacy of hu11B6 labeled with a low LET beta-emitter, 
Lutetium-177 (177Lu) and investigated whether similar tumor killing and 
AR-enhancement is produced. Moreover, single-photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT) imaging of 177Lu is quantitatively accurate and can be used to perform 
treatment planning. [177Lu]hu11B6 therefore has significant potential as a 
theranostic agent. Materials and Methods: Subcutaneous PCa xenografts (LNCaP 
s.c.) were grown in male mice. Biokinetics at 4-336 h post injection and uptake 
as a function of the amount of hu11B6 injected at 72 h were studied. Over a 30 
to 120-day treatment period the therapeutic efficacy of different activities of 
[177Lu]hu11B6 were assessed by volumetric tumor measurements, blood cell counts, 
molecular analysis of the tumor as well as SPECT/CT imaging. Organ specific mean 
absorbed doses were calculated, using a MIRD-scheme, based on biokinetic data 
and rodent specific S-factors from a modified MOBY phantom. Tumor tissues of 
treated xenografts were immunohistochemically (IHC) stained for Ki-67 
(proliferation) and AR, SA-β-gal activity (senescence) and analyzed by digital 
autoradiography (DAR). Results: Organ-to-blood and tumor-to-blood ratios were 
independent of hu11B6 specific activity except for the highest amount of 
antibody (150 µg). Tumor accumulation of [177Lu]hu11B6 peaked at 168 h with a 
specific uptake of 29 ± 9.1 percent injected activity per gram (%IA/g) and low 
accumulation in normal organs except in the submandibular gland (15 ± 4.5 
%IA/g), attributed to a cross-reaction with mice kallikreins in this organ, was 
seen. However, SPECT imaging with therapeutic amounts of [177Lu]hu11B6 revealed 
no peak in tumor accumulation at 7 d, probably due to cellular retention of 
177Lu and decreasing tumor volumes. For [177Lu]hu11B6 treated mice, tumor 
decrements of up to 4/5 of the initial tumor volume and reversible myelotoxicity 
with a nadir at 12 d were observed after a single injection. Tumor volume 
reduction correlated with injected activity and the absorbed dose. IHC revealed 
retained expression of AR throughout treatment and that Ki-67 staining reached a 
nadir at 9-14 d which coincided with high SA- β-gal activity (14 d). 
Quantification of nuclei staining showed that Ki-67 expression correlated 
negatively with activity uptake. AR expression levels in cells surviving therapy 
compared to previous timepoints and to controls at 30 d were significantly 
increased (p = 0.017). Conclusions: This study shows that hu11B6 labeled with 
the low LET beta-emitting radionuclide 177Lu can deliver therapeutic absorbed 
doses to prostate cancer xenografts with transient hematological side-effects. 
The tumor response correlated with the absorbed dose both on a macro and a small 
scale dosimetric level. Analysis of AR staining showed that AR protein levels 
increased late in the study suggesting a therapeutic mechanism, a feed forward 
mechanism coupled to AR driven response to DNA damage or clonal lineage 
selection, similar to that reported in high LET alpha-particle therapy using 
225Ac labeled hu11B6, however emerging at a later timepoint.

Obstructive sleep apnea consists in recurrent episodes of partial obstruction of 
the upper airways which can determine cessation of breathing during sleep 
causing intermittent hypoxia. The obstructive sleep disorders are encountered 
predominantly in obese patients with or without metabolic syndrome, that can 
affect the quality of life and life expectancy by increasing the cardiovascular 
risk of coronary artery disease, conductance disturbances, malignant 
arrhythmias, promoting atherogenic processes, determining sudden death and 
impairing several domains of cognitive function.

Acromegaly is associated with increased mortality and decreased life expectancy. 
Cardiovascular disease is the principal cause of premature mortality in patients 
with acromegaly, accounting for about 60% of deaths. GH and/or IGF-I exert 
direct cardiac effects: enhance cardiac contractility, stimulate cardiomyocyte 
growth, influence calcium influx in cardiomyocytes. Cardiac remodelling is 
influenced by hypertension and insulin resistance. Among cardiovascular risk 
factors arterial hypertension, reported in 35% of patients with acromegaly, 
ranks among most important negative prognostic factors for mortality. 
Hypertension plays significant role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, 
especially in older acromegalic patients and diastolic blood pressure is best 
predictive factor for cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, early and aggressive 
hypertension treatment is essential for prognosis in acromegaly. Other important 
risk factors are: valvular defects, arrhythmias, endothelial dysfunction, heart 
failure, lipid abnormalities and coronary artery disease. Numerous studies 
suggest that patients with acromegaly are under threat of arrhythmias, 
especially those with structural heart abnormalities. Congestive heart failure 
as end-stage acromegalic cardiomyopathy occurs usually in older patients, with 
long-term uncontrolled disease and other cardiovascular and metabolic 
complications. Relation between acromegaly and coronary artery disease is 
controversial as it seems to be connected rather with classical cardiovascular 
risk factors than GH and IGF-1 overexpresion.

The phospholipid l-α-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), an endogenous ligand for 
GPR55, is elevated in patients with acute coronary syndrome, and a GPR55 
antagonist cannabidiol (CBD) reduces experimental ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) 
injury. While LPI activates multiple signaling pathways, little is known about 
which ones are important in cardiomyocytes. In this study we explored whether 
activation of the Rho kinase/ROCK/p38 MAPK pathway is responsible for 
LPI-induced extension of I/R injury. Using a high-throughput screening method 
(dynamic mass redistribution; DMR), mouse- and human-induced pluripotent stem 
cell (iPSC) cardiomyocytes exposed to LPI were shown to exhibit a rapid, 
sustained, and concentration-dependent (1 nmol L-1-30 μmol L-1) cellular 
response. Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor; 10 & 50 μmol L-1) and CBD (1 μmol L-1) both 
abolished the DMR response to LPI (10 μmol L-1). In murine iPSC cardiomyocytes, 
LPI-induced ROCK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, both of which were prevented by 
Y-27632 and CBD, but did not induce JNK activation or cleavage of caspase-3. In 
hearts isolated from wild type (WT) mice subjected to 30 minutes global I/R, LPI 
(10 μmol L-1) administered via the coronary circulation increased infarct size 
when applied prior to ischemia onset, but not when given at the time of 
reperfusion. The exacerbation of tissue injury by LPI was not seen in hearts 
from GPR55-/- mice or in the presence of Y-27632, confirming that injury is 
mediated via the GPR55/ROCK/p38 MAPK pathway. These findings suggest that raised 
levels of LPI in the vicinity of a developing infarct may worsen the outcome of 
AMI.

Caregiver Care.

Swartz K(1), Collins LG(1).

Author information:

Eighty percent of adults requiring long-term care currently live at home in the 
community, and unpaid family caregivers provide 90% of their care. Family 
caregivers serve as a critical extension of the U.S. health care system, and the 
demand for family caregivers is expected to increase during the next few 
decades. Caring for loved ones is associated with several benefits, including 
personal fulfillment; however, caregiving is also associated with physical, 
psychological, and financial burdens. Family physicians can aid in the 
identification, support, and treatment of caregivers by offering caregiver 
assessments-interviews directed at identifying high levels of burden-as soon as 
caregivers are identified. Repeat assessments may be considered when there is a 
change in the status of the caregiver or the care recipient. Caregivers should 
be directed to appropriate resources for support, including national caregiving 
organizations, local elder care agencies, websites, and respite care. 
Psychoeducation, skills training, and therapeutic counseling interventions for 
caregivers have shown small to moderate success by decreasing caregiver burden 
and increasing caregiver quality of life. Additional research is needed to 
further identify strategies to offset caregiver stress, depression, and poor 
health outcomes. Support and anticipatory guidance for the caregiver is 
especially helpful during care transitions and at the care recipient's end of 
life.

INTRODUCTION: In 2016, for the very first time, the Ministry of Health in Zambia 
implemented a reactive outbreak response to control the spread of cholera and 
vaccinated at-risk populations with a single dose of Shancol-an oral cholera 
vaccine (OCV). This study aimed to assess the costs of cholera illness and 
determine the cost-effectiveness of the 2016 vaccination campaign.
METHODOLOGY: From April to June 2017, we conducted a retrospective cost and 
cost-effectiveness analysis in three peri-urban areas of Lusaka. To estimate 
costs of illness from a household perspective, a systematic random sample of 189 
in-patients confirmed with V. cholera were identified from Cholera Treatment 
Centre registers and interviewed for out-of-pocket costs. Vaccine delivery and 
health systems costs were extracted from financial records at the District 
Health Office and health facilities. The cost of cholera treatment was derived 
by multiplying the subsidized cost of drugs by the quantity administered to 
patients during hospitalisation. The cost-effectiveness analysis measured 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio-cost per case averted, cost per life saved 
and cost per DALY averted-for a single dose OCV.
RESULTS: The mean cost per administered vaccine was US$1.72. Treatment costs per 
hospitalized episode were US$14.49-US$18.03 for patients ≤15 years old and 
US$17.66-US$35.16 for older patients. Whereas households incurred costs on 
non-medical items such as communication, beverages, food and transport during 
illness, a large proportion of medical costs were borne by the health system. 
Assuming vaccine effectiveness of 88.9% and 63%, a life expectancy of 62 years 
and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of US$1,500, the costs per case 
averted were estimated US$369-US$532. Costs per life year saved ranged from 
US$18,515-US$27,976. The total cost per DALY averted was estimated between 
US$698-US$1,006 for patients ≤15 years old and US$666-US$1,000 for older 
patients.
CONCLUSION: Our study determined that reactive vaccination campaign with a 
single dose of Shancol for cholera control in densely populated areas of Lusaka 
was cost-effective.

OBJECTIVES: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a frequent complication of diabetes 
with potentially devastating consequences that may be prevented or delayed. This 
study aimed to estimate the health and economic benefit of earlier diagnosis and 
treatment of DKD.
METHODS: Life expectancy and medical spending for people with diabetes were 
modeled using The Health Economics Medical Innovation Simulation (THEMIS). 
THEMIS uses data from the Health and Retirement Study to model cohorts of 
individuals over age 50 to project population-level lifetime health and economic 
outcomes. DKD status was imputed based on diagnoses and laboratory values in the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We simulated the 
implementation of a new biomarker identifying people with diabetes at an 
elevated risk of DKD and DKD patients at risk of rapid progression.
RESULTS: Compared to baseline, the prevalence of DKD declined 5.1% with a novel 
prognostic biomarker test, while the prevalence of diabetes with stage 5 chronic 
kidney disease declined 3.0%. Consequently, people with diabetes gained 0.2 
years in life expectancy, while per-capita annual medical spending fell by 0.3%. 
The estimated cost was $12,796 per life-year gained and $25,842 per 
quality-adjusted life-year.
CONCLUSIONS: A biomarker test that allows earlier treatment reduces DKD 
prevalence and slows DKD progression, thereby increasing life expectancy among 
people with diabetes while raising healthcare spending by less than one percent.

This study assesses the prevalence of falls, factors predicting future falls, 
and health impacts of falls and balance or walking problems for U.S. older 
adults. Data were from participants ≥65 years in the Medicare Health Outcomes 
Survey Cohort 15 (baseline survey in 2012; follow-up survey in 2014; 
n = 164,597). We examined baseline factors predicting falls at follow-up and 
estimated the impact of falls and balance/walking problems on health-related 
quality of life (HRQOL), mortality, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). 
About 23% reported falls and 34% reported balance/walking problems in the past 
12 months. The strongest predictors of falls were previous falls [adjusted odds 
ratio (OR) = 2.9] and balance/walking problems (OR = 1.7). Many self-reported 
chronic conditions (e.g., depression, stroke, and diabetes), geriatric symptoms 
(e.g., urine leakage), and limitations of activities of daily living (e.g., 
transferring and walking) also predicted falls, but at a smaller magnitude 
(ORs = 1.1-1.3). Having balance/walking problems was associated with a greater 
decrease in HRQOL scores (0.195 points) than falls (0.077 points), while falls 
were associated with a greater increase in mortality [adjusted hazard ratio 
(HR) = 1.5] than balance/walking problems (HR = 1.1). Falls were associated with 
a 4.6-year (48%) decrease in QALYs, while balance/walking problems was 
associated with a 7.3-year (62%) decrease in QALYs. Falls are a major problem 
for U.S. elderly and will continue to have an even greater impact as the 
population ages. The nearly 50% decrease in QALYs for falls and >60% decrease 
for balance or walking problems demonstrates the substantial burden associated 
with these problems among older Americans.

With increasing life expectancy and mortality rates, the burden of osteoporotic 
hip fractures is continually on an upward trend. In terms of prevention, there 
are several osteoporosis treatment strategies such as anti-resorptive drug 
treatments, which attempt to retard the rate of bone resorption, while promoting 
the rate of formation. With respect to prediction, several studies have provided 
insights into obtaining bone strength by non-invasive means through the 
application of FE analysis. However, what valuable information can we obtain 
from FE studies that have focused on osteoporosis research, with respect to the 
prediction of osteoporotic fractures? This paper aims to fine studies that have 
used FE analysis to predict fractures in the proximal femur through a systematic 
search of literature using PUBMED, with the main objective of supporting the 
diagnosis of osteoporosis. The focus of these FE studies is first discussed, and 
the methodological aspects are summarized, by mainly comparing and contrasting 
their meshing properties, material properties, and boundary conditions. The 
implications of these methodological differences in FE modelling processes and 
propositions with the aim of consolidating or minimalizing these differences are 
further discussed. We proved that studies need to start converging in terms of 
their input parameters to make the FE method applicable to clinical settings. 
This, in turn, will decrease the time needed for in vitro tests. Current 
advancements in FE analysis need to be consolidated before any further steps can 
be taken to implement engineering analysis into the clinical scenario.

The ageing process is a phenomenon leading to an emergence of a web of 
interrelated biological processes producing significant changes in the human 
body. The aim of the paper was to analyse gender-specific differences with 
regard to selected biochemical parameters in longevity. The study was conducted 
in Poland in 2017. The study population comprised of long-lived individuals, 
both living at home and staying at residential care homes. There were 90 people 
of both genders (69 women and 21 men) aged between 90 and 103 years (mean = 
92.36; SD = 2.98). The biochemical markers of longevity in the studied patients 
were identified by assessing their pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory status 
in various metabolic aspects. The analysis of biochemical variables revealed 
numerous statistically significant differences, both in the study group as a 
whole and between the genders. The ageing process is extremely complex, but 
understanding it will allow for a real intervention in life extension. Research 
into the processes involved in ageing and longevity will enable a better 
understanding of the mechanisms responsible for them, and to enjoy those 
processes in good health.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally 
among women, and certain pregnancy complications can be the earliest indicators 
of increased CVD risk. Nonetheless, there is no recommendation for follow-up of 
cardiovascular risk factors identified through postpartum screening programs. 
This study describes current referral practices and clinical course from the 
Maternal Health Clinic in Kingston, Ontario, for women deemed at high 
cardiovascular risk postpartum.
METHODS: We investigated the cohort of women referred from the postpartum 
Maternal Health Clinic to cardiology for further assessment and management, 
specifically examining timing and recommended interventions to reduce CVD risk.
RESULTS: Women referred to cardiology differed significantly from those not 
referred in history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (P < 0.05) and 
demonstrated a significantly worse CVD risk profile at 6 months postpartum (P < 
0.0001). Life expectancy by the cardiometabolic model for women referred was 5 
years shorter (P < 0.0001). Only half of the women referred to cardiology 
scheduled a visit; the median time to the scheduled appointment was 12 months. 
Of women seen by cardiology, 60% were deemed eligible for cardiac 
rehabilitation.
CONCLUSIONS: Although women at highest risk for CVD are being identified and 
referred to cardiology, the existing system is not designed for this 
demographic. Too many women are missing their appointments or being seen beyond 
1 year postpartum. To initiate lifestyle changes and/or therapeutic 
interventions, we suggest that CVD prevention programming begins within 1 year 
of delivery. Future studies should investigate the viability of traditional 
cardiac rehabilitation programs among this unique population.

BACKGROUND: Asylum seekers have a high burden of mental illness owing to 
traumatic experiences before, during and after flight. Screening has been 
suggested to identify asylum seekers with psychosocial needs. However, little is 
known about the costs of screening relative to expected gains. We assessed the 
cost-utility of population-based screening for depression in German asylum 
reception centres compared to case-finding by self-referral.
METHODS: Explorative modelling study using a decision tree over 15 months to 
estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Data points 
were taken from the published literature. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were used to address uncertainty around parameter 
estimates. Value of information analyses were performed to indicate the value of 
future research.
RESULTS: The model demonstrates a high probability (p = 83%) of the screening 
intervention being cost-effective at a Є 50,000/QALY threshold. Cost-utility 
depends on the process of care following screening: when acceptability and 
adherence parameters were decreased by 40%, the resulting ICER increased by 
27-131%. Eliminating uncertainty was most valuable for the screening process and 
cost parameters, at Є 3·0 and Є 4·4 million respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening asylum seekers for depression may be a cost-effective 
strategy to identify those in need of care. However, there is considerable value 
in conducting further research in this area, especially regarding resource 
requirements and the process of care following screening.

PREVALENCE OF HYPERTENSION LESS FREQUENT IN WOMEN BEFORE MENOPAUSE: In adults, 
up to the age of 50-60, hypertension is an uncommon disease, less frequent in 
women than in men. The literature review does not determine whether this 
difference is related to a protective effect of endogenous estrogens on the risk 
of high blood pressure, to genetic or immuno-enzymatic differences related to 
sex but of non-hormonal origin or to a large number of confounding variables 
(salt consumption, alcohol consumption, fruit and vegetable consumption, body 
mass index, psycho-socio-economic factors, sedentary lifestyle). PREVALENCE OF 
HYPERTENSION INCREASES AT MENOPAUSE: After menopause, the risk of hypertension 
in women increases and quickly reaches that of men, even exceeding it from the 
seventh decade onwards. The factors that make hypertension more frequent after 
the seventh decade in women are related to differences in cardiovascular risk 
and life expectancy between men and women, as well as a likely surviving effect 
in older men. The mechanisms by which estrogen-progestin deficiency increases 
the risk of hypertension have been extensively studied. These mechanisms are 
obviously numerous. However, it has not been clearly demonstrated that hormone 
replacement therapy during menopause reduces blood pressure levels. It should be
