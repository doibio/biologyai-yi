a decision context than the RCT data, and in some situations, as illustrated by 
3 examples, it would be unreasonable, not to take account of existing non-RCT 
data. The use of non-RCT clinical evidence is most common for devices, 
interventions where RCTs are difficult, and in conditions with poor prognosis 
where single arm studies are often carried out. Therefore, a pragmatic approach 
to the available evidence is needed for many decision made by the NICE Appraisal 
Committees to come to a reasonable and defendable decision.

INTRODUCTION: The large increase in the number of transnasal endoscopic skull 
base surgeries is a consequence of greater knowledge of the anatomic region, the 
development of specific materials and instruments, and especially the use of the 
nasoseptal flap as a barrier between the sinus tract (contaminated cavity) and 
the subarachnoid space (sterile area), reducing the high risk of contamination.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the otorhinolaryngologic complications in patients 
undergoing endoscopic surgery of the skull base, in which a nasoseptal flap was 
used.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included patients who underwent 
endoscopic skull base surgery with creation of a nasoseptal flap, assessing for 
the presence of the following post-surgical complications: cerebrospinal fluid 
leak, meningitis, mucocele formation, nasal synechia, septal perforation (prior 
to posterior septectomy), internal nasal valve failure, epistaxis, and olfactory 
alterations.
RESULTS: The study assessed 41 patients undergoing surgery. Of these, 35 had 
pituitary adenomas (macro- or micro-adenomas; sellar and suprasellar extension), 
three had meningiomas (two tuberculum sellae and one olfactory groove), two had 
craniopharyngiomas, and one had an intracranial abscess. The complications were 
cerebrospinal fluid leak (three patients; 7.3%), meningitis (three patients; 
7.3%), nasal fossa synechia (eight patients; 19.5%), internal nasal valve 
failure (six patients; 14.6%), and complaints of worsening of the sense of smell 
(16 patients; 39%). The olfactory test showed anosmia or hyposmia in ten 
patients (24.3%). No patient had mucocele, epistaxis, or septal perforation.
CONCLUSION: The use of the nasoseptal flap has revolutionized endoscopic skull 
base surgery, making the procedures more effective and with lower morbidity 
compared to the traditional route. However, although mainly transient nasal 
morbidities were observed, in some cases, permanent hyposmia and anosmia 
resulted. An improvement in this technique is therefore necessary to provide a 
better quality of life for the patient, reducing potential complications.

INTRODUÇÃO: O grande crescimento no número de cirurgias endoscópicas transnasais 
para a base do crânio ocorreu a partir de um maior conhecimento anatômico da 
região; do desenvolvimento de materiais e instrumentais específicos e, 
principalmente, após a utilização do retalho nasoseptal como uma barreira entre 
o trato sinusal (cavidade contaminada) e o espaço subaracnóideo (área estéril), 
com redução de grandes riscos de contaminação.
OBJETIVO: Avaliar as complicações otorrinolaringológicas nos pacientes 
submetidos à cirurgia endoscópica da base do crânio, na qual foi utilizado o 
retalho nasoseptal.
MÉTODO: Estudo retrospectivo, no qual foram avaliados os pacientes submetidos à 
cirurgia da base do crânio por via endoscópica com realização do retalho 
nasoseptal, quanto à presença no pós operatório das seguintes complicações: 
fístula liquórica, meningite, formação de mucocele, sinéquia nasal, perfuração 
septal (anterior à septectomia posterior), insuficiência de válvula nasal 
interna, epistaxe e alteração olfatória.
RESULTADOS: Foram avaliados 41 pacientes submetidos à cirurgia. Destes, 35 eram 
portadores de adenomas hipofisários (macro ou microadenomas; selares e extensão 
supraselar), três meningiomas (dois de tubérculo selar e um da goteira 
olfatória), dois craniofaringiomas e um abscesso intracraniano. As complicações 
observadas foram: fístula liquórica (três pacientes – 7,3%), meningite (três 
pacientes – 7,3%), sinéquia em fossa nasal (oito pacientes – 19,5%), 
insuficiência de válvula nasal interna (seis pacientes – 14,6%), e queixa de 
piora do olfato (16 pacientes – 39%). O teste olfatório evidenciou anosmia ou 
hiposmia em 10 pacientes (24,3%). Nenhum paciente apresentou mucocele, epistaxe 
ou perfuração septal.
CONCLUSÃO: O uso do retalho nasoseptal proporcionou uma revolução na cirurgia da 
base do crânio por via endoscópica tornando os procedimentos mais eficazes e com 
baixa morbidade, comparando com a via tradicional. Porém, passou a ocasionar 
morbidades nasais principalmente transitórias, mas em alguns casos permanentes, 
como hiposmia e anosmia. Assim, torna-se necessário um aperfeiçoamento desta 
técnica para proporcionar uma melhoria na qualidade de vida do paciente e 
diminuir possíveis complicações.

Multiple primary malignancies are no longer rare in clinical practice. The 
incidence of multiple primary malignant neoplasms is the consequence of progress 
in oncological treatment and diagnostic methods, as well as the higher overall 
survival rate and life expectancy rate. We present a case of a patient who 
synchronously developed four malignancies: cervical cancer, breast cancer, 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and an 
olfactory groove meningioma. This case proves that the diagnosis of the cervical 
cancer does not exclude the occurrence of other malignancies. It also emphasizes 
the fact that every case of uterine cervical cancer with atypical clinical 
presentation should be thoroughly analyzed to avoid diagnostic mistakes, which 
in turn may worsen the prognosis.

In addition to increased risks of macrovascular and microvascular complications, 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) usually also are at increased risk 
for cognitive impairment and dementia. Hypoglycemia, a common consequence of 
diabetes treatment, is considered an independent risk factor for dementia in 
patients with T2DM. Hypoglycemia and dementia are clinically underestimated and 
are related to poor outcomes; thus, they may compromise the life expectancy of 
patients with T2DM. Epidemiological evidence of hypoglycemia-associated 
cognitive decline and dementia is highly varied. Acute, severe hypoglycemic 
episodes induce chronic subclinical brain damage, cognitive decline, and 
subsequent dementia. However, the effects of recurrent moderate hypoglycemia on 
cognitive decline and dementia remain largely uninvestigated. Poor glycemic 
control (including fluctuation of hemoglobin A1C [HbA1c] and glucose values) and 
the viscous circle of bidirectional associations between dementia and 
hypoglycemia may be clinically relevant. The possible pathophysiological 
hypotheses include post-hypoglycemic neuronal damage, inflammatory processes, 
coagulation defects, endothelial abnormalities, and synaptic dysfunction of 
hippocampal neurons during hypoglycemia episodes. This article reviews previous 
findings, provides insight into the detection of groups at high risk of 
hypoglycemia-associated dementia, and proposes specific strategies to minimize 
the potential burdens associated with hypoglycemia-related neurocognitive 
disorders in patients with T2DM.

The role of active surveillance of small renal masses.

Volpe A(1).

Eastern Piedmont, Maggiore della Carità Hospital, Corso Mazzini, 18, 28100,

INTRODUCTION: The use of modern abdominal imaging modalities have led in recent 
years to an increased incidental diagnosis of small renal masses (SRMs), 
especially in elderly patients. The natural history of SRMs has been 
historically poorly understood because most have been traditionally surgically 
removed soon after diagnosis. However, several studies of active surveillance 
(AS) of SRMs have been published in the last decade.
METHODS: A review of English-language publications on AS of SRMs was performed 
from 1995 to 2015 using the Medline, Embase and Web of Science databases. 
Fifty-six articles were selected based on their scientific relevance and 
critically analysed.
RESULTS: When followed conservatively with serial imaging, SRMs have variable 
growth rates with an average of 0.31 cm/year in the largest multicenter 
analysis. A significant number of SRMs have a slow growth and some have zero 
growth under surveillance. The risk of progression to metastatic disease during 
AS is rare (1-2%). Population-based analyses in older patient populations (>75 
years) fail to show a benefit in cancer-specific mortality for surgical 
treatment of SRMs.
DISCUSSION: The standard of care for localized renal tumors is surgery. In 
elderly or unfit patients with decreased life expectancy, it is reasonable to 
propose an initial period of AS, with delayed intervention for those tumors 
which exhibit a fast growth during follow-up. At present AS is not recommended 
in younger and fit patients and for masses >4 cm at diagnosis outside clinical 
trials. Percutaneous needle biopsies of renal tumors have the potential to 
characterize histologically SRMs at diagnosis, thereby providing useful 
information for the selection of the best suited patients for AS.
CONCLUSIONS: Most SRMs are benign tumors or RCCs with a relatively indolent 
clinical behaviour. AS can be offered to patients with SRMs and decreased life 
expectancy. Prospective series of AS of histologically confirmed RCCs are needed 
to confirm the long term safety of this conservative approach.

"If You Don't Know, All of a Sudden, They're Gone": Caregiver Perspectives About 
Prognostic Communication for Disabled Elderly Adults.

OBJECTIVES: To describe preferences and experiences of caregivers of disabled 
older adults regarding being included in patient-clinician discussions about 
life expectancy.
DESIGN: Qualitative interview study.
SETTING: Caregivers were recruited from a Program of All-Inclusive Care for the 
Elderly (PACE), caregiver support groups and an advertisement on a nationwide 
caregiver advocacy group website.
PARTICIPANTS: Active and bereaved caregivers whose primary language was either 
English or Cantonese who had provided care within the last 5 years to a disabled 
adult aged 65 and older (N = 42, 79% female, 60% white, average age 54).
MEASUREMENTS: Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with caregivers 
who were asked about experiences and preferences related to clinician 
communication about life expectancy, including preferences for and attitudes 
toward being included in discussions about life expectancy, how such information 
should be delivered, and how clinicians should address concerns about 
uncertainty and hope. Responses were analyzed qualitatively using constant 
comparison until thematic saturation was reached.
RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of caregivers had been involved in a conversation 
with a clinician about life expectancy, even though 79% expressed a preference 
to have such a discussion. According to caregivers, clinician concerns about 
taking away hope or the uncertainty of prognostic information should not deter 
them from bringing up the topic of life expectancy. Thematic analysis suggested 
several approaches that may facilitate prognosis communication: establishing a 
relationship with the caregiver and care recipient; delivering the prognosis in 
clear, plain language; and responding to emotion with empathy.
CONCLUSION: Caregivers reported a preference for being included in conversations 
about a care recipient's life expectancy.

AIM: We investigated differences in function, strength and pain in those with 
knee osteoarthritis (OA) who responded with a single step compared to multiple 
steps during balance recovery during an induced forward fall.
METHOD: The stepping response of 24 participants with knee OA (50% female, age 
68.6 ± 6.2 years) as they recovered balance from an induced forward fall was 
recorded. Participants were grouped based on their stepping response as 
single-stepper and multi-stepper. Comparison was made between the groups for 
functional and strength tests and self-reported pain, function, quality of life, 
fear of falls and physical activity.
RESULTS: Fourteen of the participants (58%) responded with a multiple step 
response. Multiple steppers demonstrated greater time for the up and go (P = 
0.01), the stair climb tests (P = 0.05), as well as reduced distance during the 
2 min walk test (P = 0.001) and reduced isokinetic knee extension strength (P = 
0.02).
CONCLUSION: Those who demonstrated multiple step response had impaired function, 
reduced strength and were less physically active. Given the high prevalence of 
falls in people with knee OA, further studies are required to better understand 
the ability of people with knee OA to respond and avoid falls.

Nurses' experience of caring for people with intellectual disability and 
dementia.

Ireland.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore nurses' experiences of caring for older people 
with intellectual disability and dementia.
BACKGROUND: Ageing and dementia prevalence is increasing along with the life 
expectancy of people with intellectual disability. As a population group, people 
with intellectual disability have a high prevalence of dementia, which is higher 
within the subpopulation of Down syndrome. People with intellectual disability 
live in residential care, community or residential settings, and nurses are 
required to adapt their practices to meet the changed needs of the individual.
DESIGN: A qualitative Husserlian descriptive phenomenological methodology 
facilitated the researcher to become absorbed in the quintessence of meaning and 
explore nurses' experience of working with older people with intellectual 
disability and dementia.
METHODS: Ethical approval was obtained, and data were collected utilising 
semistructured interviews (n = 11). Interviews were transcribed and analysed 
using Colaizzi's framework for data analysis.
RESULTS: Three key themes were identified: 'knowledge of dementia', 
'person-centred care' and 'transitioning within the service'. The study 
highlights the need for proactive planning, life story books of the patient, and 
funding to support client and staff.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the study highlights the importance of knowing the person, 
supporting the individual and recognising presenting behaviours as outside the 
control of the individual.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This article presents the experiences of nurses 
caring for the older person with intellectual disability and dementia. 
Transitions are often very difficult for both the person and their peers, and 
they experience benefit from the efforts of a multidisciplinary team 
facilitating a person-centred approach.

PURPOSE: To describe a life-threatening complication during endovascular 
aneurysm repair that was caused by a series of errors.
CASE REPORT: A 64-year-old man received a Zenith aortouni-iliac stent-graft for 
a 61-mm saccular aortic aneurysm. During retrieval of the delivery system, the 
sheath became dislodged from the common femoral artery. Reintroduction caused 
the top cap to disengage from the pusher rod because the pin vice had not been 
tightened as per the instructions for use. Subsequent traction was applied but 
the delivery system could not be withdrawn from the sheath, thus it was decided 
to remove the delivery system and sheath en masse. On removal, the distal 
sealing stent was found deformed and wedged between the top cap and the sheath. 
Perforation of the common iliac artery by the avulsed stent was treated with 
iliac limb extension before contralateral iliac plug and femorofemoral bypass 
graft were performed as planned. The patient made an uneventful recovery.
CONCLUSION: Trapping of the distal sealing stent between the top cap and the 
pusher rod of the Zenith graft is possible and can be prevented by securing the 
pin vice prior to retrieval. Description of this complication may prevent 
similar occurrences in future.

Life expectancy for people with severe mental disorders is up to 25 years less 
in comparison to the general population, mainly due to diseases caused or 
worsened by smoking. However, smoking is usually a neglected issue in mental 
healthcare settings. The aim of this article is to describe a strategy to 
improve tobacco control in the hospital mental healthcare services of Catalonia 
(Spain). To bridge this gap, the Catalan Network of Smoke-free Hospitals 
launched a nationwide bottom-up strategy in Catalonia in 2007. The strategy 
relied on the creation of a working group of key professionals from various 
hospitals -the early adopters- based on Rogers' theory of the Diffusion of 
Innovations. In 2016, the working group is composed of professionals from 17 
hospitals (70.8% of all hospitals in the region with mental health inpatient 
units). Since 2007, tobacco control has improved in different areas such as 
increasing mental health professionals' awareness of smoking, training 
professionals on smoking cessation interventions and achieving good compliance 
with the national smoking ban. The working group has produced and disseminated 
various materials, including clinical practice and best practice guidelines, 
implemented smoking cessation programmes and organised seminars and training 
sessions on smoking cessation measures in patients with mental illnesses. The 
next challenge is to ensure effective follow-up for smoking cessation after 
discharge. While some areas of tobacco control within these services still 
require significant improvement, the aforementioned initiative promotes 
successful tobacco control in these settings.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive 
chronic disease that has considerable impact on utility-based health-related 
quality of life. Utility is a key input of many decision analytic models used 
for economic evaluations.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review COPD-related utilities and to compare these 
with alternative values used in decision models.
METHODS: The literature review comprised studies that generated utilities for 
COPD-related stages based on EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire surveys of 
patients and of decision models of COPD progression that have been used for 
economic evaluations. The utility values used in modeling studies and those from 
the meta-analysis of actual patient-level studies were compared and differences 
quantified.
RESULTS: Twenty decision modeling studies that used utility value as an input 
parameter were found. Within the same span of publication period, 13 studies 
involving patient-level utility data were identified and included in the 
meta-analysis. The estimated mean utility values ranged from 0.806 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.747-0.866) for stage I to 0.616 (95% CI 0.556-0.676) 
for stage IV. The utility scores for comparable stages in modeling studies were 
different (significant difference 0.045 [95% CI 0.041-0.052] for stage III). 
Modeling studies consistently used higher utility values than the average 
reported patient-level data.
CONCLUSIONS: COPD decision analytic models are based on a limited range of 
utility values that are systematically different from average values estimated 
using a meta-analysis. A more systematic approach in the application of utility 
measures in economic evaluation is required to appropriately reflect current 
literature.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treatment with anti-CD20 
monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil (GClb) in untreated patients 
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine-based 
therapy.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of GClb versus 
other chemoimmunotherapy options. The model comprised three mutually exclusive 
health states: "progression-free survival (with/without therapy)", "progression 
(refractory/relapsed lines)", and "death". Each state was assigned a health 
utility value representing patients' quality of life and a specific cost value. 
Comparisons between GClb and rituximab plus chlorambucil or only chlorambucil 
were performed using patient-level clinical trial data; other comparisons were 
performed via a network meta-analysis using information gathered in a systematic 
literature review. To support the model, a utility elicitation study was 
conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service.
RESULTS: There was good agreement between the model-predicted progression-free 
and overall survival and that from the CLL11 trial. On incorporating data from 
the indirect treatment comparisons, it was found that GClb was cost-effective 
with a range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below a threshold of 
£30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and remained so during 
deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses under various scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: GClb was estimated to increase both quality-adjusted life 
expectancy and treatment costs compared with several commonly used therapies, 
with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below commonly referenced UK 
thresholds. This article offers a real example of how to combine direct and 
indirect evidence in a cost-effectiveness analysis of oncology drugs.

BACKGROUND: Currently in the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) 
Breast Screening Programme invites all women for triennial mammography between 
the ages of 47 and 73 years (the extension to 47-50 and 70-73 years is currently 
examined as part of a randomized controlled trial). The benefits and harms of 
screening in women 70 years and older, however, are less well documented.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine whether extending screening to 
women older than 70 years would represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources 
and to identify the upper age limit at which screening mammography should be 
extended in England and Wales.
METHODS: A mathematical model that allows the impact of screening policies on 
cancer diagnosis and subsequent management to be assessed was built. The model 
has two parts: a natural history model of the progression of breast cancer up to 
discovery and a postdiagnosis model of treatment, recurrence, and survival. The 
natural history model was calibrated to available data and compared against 
published literature. The management of breast cancer at diagnosis was taken 
from registry data and valued using official UK tariffs.
RESULTS: The model estimated that screening would lead to overdiagnosis in 6.2% 
of screen-detected women at the age of 72 years, increasing up to 37.9% at the 
age of 90 years. Under commonly quoted willingness-to-pay thresholds in the 
United Kingdom, our study suggests that an extension to screening up to the age 
of 78 years represents a cost-effective strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides encouraging findings to support the extension 
of the screening program to older ages and suggests that further extension of 
the UK NHS Breast Screening Programme up to age 78 years beyond the current 
upper age limit of 73 years could be potentially cost-effective according to 
current NHS willingness-to-pay thresholds.

BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is used extensively in the treatment of cancer, 
including advanced ovarian cancer, for which results of the International 
Collaborative Ovarian Neoplasm (ICON) 7 trial have been recently reported. The 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) recent decision not 
to recommend bevacizumab for advanced ovarian cancer was not based on evidence 
related to the unlicensed lower dosage (7.5 mg/kg) of the drug despite its use 
in the English National Health Service (NHS) and the ICON7 trial.
OBJECTIVE: To report on the findings of an analysis that considered whether the 
lower dose is cost-effective.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis is assessed from the perspective of the 
English NHS and health outcomes expressed in terms of quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs). The analysis focuses on a clinically predefined high-risk 
subgroup of the ICON7 trial. The price at which the lower dose of bevacizumab 
could be considered cost-effective for the English NHS is presented for a range 
of scenarios to inform decisions about price negotiations by international 
health systems.
RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, bevacizumab has an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of £48,975 per additional QALY, which is above NICE's 
standard cost-effectiveness threshold (£20,000-£30,000 per QALY). The official 
price of bevacizumab in 2013 was between £2.31 and £2.63 per milligram. A price 
reduction of between 46% and 67%, dependent on the NICE threshold, would be 
required for the product to be cost-effective in the high-risk subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS: The lower dose of bevacizumab for advanced ovarian cancer is not 
cost-effective based on the product's list price and using NICE's 
cost-effectiveness thresholds. Significant price discounts would be needed to 
make the drug affordable to the NHS.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate health state utility values (HSUVs) for multiple 
sclerosis (MS) by key demographic and clinical characteristics.
METHODS: Data from a UK prospective, longitudinal, cohort study of people with 
MS were used for analysis. Patient-reported outcomes on the EuroQol 
five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) and the six-dimensional health state 
short form (SF-6D) (derived from 36-item short form health survey), SF-36 were 
used to estimate HSUVs by age, sex, MS type, time since diagnosis, disease 
severity (Expanded Disability Status Scale score), and relapse characteristics.
RESULTS: The cohort (n = 1,441) (11,778 returned questionnaires) was 
representative of the UK population with MS. Data indicated that primary and 
secondary progressive MS were associated with lower HSUVs than 
relapsing-remitting MS and that HSUVs decreased by disease severity. This was 
particularly apparent for the EQ-5D, with mean estimates ranging from 0.846 to 
0.025 for Expanded Disability Status Scale scores 0 to 8, compared to mean SF-6D 
estimates ranging from 0.702 to 0.529. Experiencing a relapse in the previous 6 
months had a significant impact on HSUVs, with mean decrements of 0.076 for the 
EQ-5D and 0.052 for the SF-6D.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the negative impact of MS on 
health-related quality of life, especially as the condition progresses, and 
indicate the substantial influence of varying features of relapses on HSUVs. 
This is the first report of SF-6D values for a UK MS population and the first 
time that EQ-5D data have been presented in such detail for people with MS. The 
representative nature of the sample means that these data can be used to offer 
decision makers more precise estimates of the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of MS treatments.

BACKGROUND: Time trade-off (TTO)-based valuation studies for the three-level 
version of the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) typically started 
off with a ranking task (ordering the health states by preference). This was not 
included in the protocol for the five-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) valuation study.
OBJECTIVES: To test whether reintroducing a ranking task before the composite 
TTO (C-TTO) could help to reduce inconsistencies in C-TTO responses and improve 
the data quality.
METHODS: Respondents were randomly assigned to three study arms. The control arm 
was the present EQ-5D-5L study protocol, without ranking. The second arm 
(ranking without sorting) preceded the present protocol by asking respondents to 
rank the target health states using physical cards. The states were then valued 
in random order using C-TTO. In the third arm (ranking and sorting), the ranked 
states remained visible through the C-TTO tasks and the order of valuation was 
determined by the ranking. The study used only 10 EQ-5D-5L health states. We 
compared the C-TTO-based inconsistent pairs of health states and ties.
RESULTS: The final sample size was 196 in the control arm, 205 in the ranking 
without sorting arm, and 199 in the ranking and sorting arm. The percentages of 
ties by respondents were 15.1%, 12.5%, and 12.6% for the control arm, the 
ranking without sorting arm, and the ranking and sorting arm, respectively. The 
extra cost for adding the ranking task was about 15%.
CONCLUSIONS: The benefit does not justify the effort involved in the ranking 
task. For this reason, the addition of the ranking task to the present EQ-5D-5L 
valuation protocol is not an attractive option.

BACKGROUND: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is an option for the treatment 
of medically intractable end-stage heart failure. MCS therapy, however, is 
resource intensive.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report was to systematically review the MCS 
cost-effectiveness literature as it pertains to the treatment of adult patients 
in end-stage heart failure.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search and narrative review of available 
cost- effectiveness and cost-utility analyses of MCS in adult patients with 
end-stage heart failure.
RESULTS: Eleven studies analyzing the cost-effectiveness or cost-utility of MCS 
were identified. Seven studies focused on bridge to transplantation, three 
studies focused on destination therapy, and one study presented analyses of both 
strategies. Two articles evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the HeartMate II 
(Thoratec Corp., Pleasanton, CA). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between 
MCS and medical management ranged between $85,025 and $200,166 for bridge to 
transplantation and between $87,622 and $1,257,946 for destination therapy (2012 
Canadian dollars per quality-adjusted life-year). Sensitivity analyses indicated 
that improvements in survival and quality of life and reductions in device and 
initial hospital-stay costs may improve the cost-effectiveness of MCS.
CONCLUSIONS: Current studies suggest that MCS is likely not cost-effective with 
reference to generally accepted or explicitly stated thresholds. Refined patient 
selection, complication rates, achieved quality of life, and device/surgical 
costs, however, could modify the cost-effectiveness of MCS.

BACKGROUND: Value-of-information (VOI) analysis provides an analytical framework 
to assess whether obtaining additional evidence is worthwhile to reduce decision 
uncertainty. The reporting of VOI measures, particularly the expected value of 
perfect parameter information (EVPPI) and the expected value of sample 
information (EVSI), is limited because of the computational burden associated 
with typical two-level Monte-Carlo-based solution. Recently, a nonparametric 
regression approach was proposed that allows the estimation of multiparameter 
EVPPI and EVSI directly from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis sample.
OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the value of the nonparametric regression approach in 
calculating VOI measures in real-world cases and to compare its performance with 
the standard approach of the Monte-Carlo simulation.
METHODS: We used the regression approach to calculate EVPPI and EVSI in two 
models, and compared the results with the estimates obtained via the standard 
Monte-Carlo simulation.
RESULTS: The VOI values from the two approaches were very close; computation 
using the regression method, however, was faster.
CONCLUSION: The nonparametric regression approach provides an efficient and 
easy-to-implement alternative for EVPPI and EVSI calculation in economic models.

Adolescents overestimate their risk for early or premature death. In turn, 
perceived early fatality is associated with a host of adverse developmental 
outcomes. Research on the correlates of perceived early fatality is nascent, and 
an examination of the contextual determinants of perceived early fatality is 
largely absent from the literature. Using data from the National Longitudinal 
Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), this study examines whether 
friendship networks and the school climate impact youth's perceptions of 
premature death. Analysis using hierarchical linear models on 9617 youth (52.0 % 
female) within 113 middle and high schools across the U.S. assess the extent to 
which peer and school future orientation climate and friendship network 
characteristics (network size, density, popularity, and centrality) impact 
respondents' life expectancy. Consistent with hypotheses: (1) higher levels of 
life expectancy in respondents' friendship networks and schools are associated 
with more optimistic expectations about the future among sample respondents; and 
(2) youth embedded in larger and denser friendship networks report higher levels 
of life expectancy. The results are consistent with the literature on peer 
effects, studies documenting the insulating effects of extensive and closely 
knit peer networks, and research on the contextual effects of the school 
environment. More generally, the results suggest that adolescent friendship 
networks and the school climate are key contexts in which youth develop 
expectations for the future.

PURPOSE: A dramatic improvement in the survival of patients with chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML) occurred after the introduction of imatinib mesylate, the first 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). We assessed how these changes affected the life 
expectancy of patients with CML and life-years lost as a result of CML between 
1973 and 2013 in Sweden.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients recorded as having CML in the Swedish Cancer 
Registry from 1973 to 2013 were included in the study and followed until death, 
censorship, or end of follow-up. The life expectancy and loss in expectation of 
life were predicted from a flexible parametric relative survival model.
RESULTS: A total of 2,662 patients with CML were diagnosed between 1973 and
