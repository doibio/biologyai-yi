cointegration amid the variables. Moreover, trade openness and FDI increase 
population health measured by life expectancy in the long-run. Furthermore, the 
analysis suggests that trade openness and FDI cause life expectancy in the 
short-run. These findings have several policy implications to improve life 
expectancy for the people of Pakistan in particular and other developing 
countries in general.

5-14% of patients underwent surgery for benign prostate hyperplasia harboring 
prostate cancer (PCa) focus. The best management of incidental prostate cancer 
(iPCa) has been debated. The decision "treatment or no treatment" should be 
determined by predictors which accurately foretell PCa progression after 
transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The purpose of this study is to 
review the available data that can be useful in daily clinical judgment. 
Transrectal ultrasound prostate biopsy (TRUSBx) did not provide further Gleason 
score (GS) data in most patients diagnosed with iPCa. TRUSBX may be useful 
before active surveillance, but not in all following radical prostatectomy. The 
decision "treatment or no treatment" should be dependent on the expected chance 
of having residual cancer and clinical progression. Prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) levels before and after TURP are good predictors of residual cancer after 
TURP. Pathological report of T0 is most likely seen in patients with low PSA 
density after TURP and indistinguishable lesion on multiparametric magnetic 
resonance imaging. The decision "treatment vs no treatment" is judged by life 
expectancy, tumor characteristic in the pathology report of TURP sample and PSA 
level following TURP. Active surveillance should be contemplated in patients 
with iPCa who have both prostate-specific antigen density ≤0.08 after TURP and 
indistinguishable cancer lesion on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. 
Patients who do not meet the criteria for active surveillance are candidates for 
radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy (RT). Radical prostatectomy could be 
peacefully done after TURP with somewhat greater morbidity. RT in patients who 
had a history of TURP could be safely done and is associated with acceptable 
quality of life.

Multiple myeloma represents 2% of all new cancer diagnoses in the United Kingdom 
and accounts for 2% of all cancer deaths. In the past few decades, there have 
been huge improvements in life expectancy which have been driven by novel 
therapeutic agents, autologous stem cell transplants and intensified supportive 
care. This review will discuss the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma, current 
management approaches and the direction of future treatments. In addition, this 
review will highlight the high burden of symptoms that patients experience and 
therefore the great benefits that can be gained from specialist palliative care 
input.

Pós-graduação em Saúde Pública. Belo Horizonte - MG, Brasil.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the years of life lost due to premature death and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) as a result of chronic noncommunicable 
diseases attributable to occupational hazard factors, and to compare their 
position according to the risk ranking for chronic noncommunicable diseases in 
1990 and 2016.
METHODS: Data for the DALY indicator, estimated from the Global Burden of 
Disease 2016 (GBD 2016) study, were analyzed for noncommunicable chronic 
diseases attributable to occupational, and other risk factors, selected in 
Brazil. A descriptive analysis was performed comparing the proportion of DALY by 
sex and age group (15 to 49 and 50 to 69 years old), as well as the ranking of 
occupational hazard factors in 1990 and 2016.
RESULTS: In 2016, ergonomic risk factors, carcinogenic agents, and noise in the 
workplace were among the 25 largest contributors to DALY for chronic 
noncommunicable diseases affecting the age group between 15 and 49 years. The 
contribution of all occupational hazard factors increased in 2016, except for 
occupational aerodispersoids affecting men. Concerning the age group between 50 
and 69, occupational carcinogens stand out, with an increase of 26.0% for men, 
and 17.1% for women in 2016. Risk factors evaluated according to their 1990 and 
2016 ranking show that occupational hazards have all scored higher on the second 
evaluation (2016), especially when compared with other risks.
CONCLUSIONS: The global burden of chronic noncommunicable diseases attributed to 
occupational hazard factors has become increasingly important. We suggest the 
strengthening of the approach of occupational hazard factors in the agendas for 
tackling these diseases in Brazil.

OBJETIVO: Avaliar anos de vida perdidos por morte prematura e por incapacidade ( 
disability-adjusted life years – DALY) em decorrência de doenças crônicas não 
transmissíveis atribuíveis a fatores de risco ocupacionais e comparar a posição 
desses fatores no ranking dos riscos para doenças crônicas não transmissíveis em 
1990 e 2016.
MÉTODOS: Os dados referentes ao indicador DALY, estimado no estudo de Carga 
Global de Doenças de 2016 (GBD 2016), foram analisados para doenças crônicas não 
transmissíveis atribuíveis a fatores de risco ocupacionais e outros selecionados 
no Brasil. Realizou-se análise descritiva comparando a proporção de DALY por 
sexo e faixa etária (15 a 49 e 50 a 69 anos), além do ranqueamento de atribuição 
dos fatores de risco ocupacionais em 1990 e 2016.
RESULTADOS: Em 2016, fatores de risco ergonômicos, agentes carcinogênicos e 
ruído no ambiente laboral estiveram entre os 25 que mais contribuíram para os 
DALY por doenças crônicas não transmissíveis na faixa etária de 15 a 49 anos. A 
contribuição de todos fatores de risco ocupacionais aumentou em 2016, exceto os 
aerodispersoides ocupacionais para os homens. Para a faixa etária de 50 a 69 
anos, sobressaem os agentes carcinogênicos ocupacionais, com aumento de 26.0% 
para homens e 17.1% para mulheres em 2016. Comparando o ranqueamento de 1990 e 
2016 dos fatores de risco avaliados, os ocupacionais ascenderam de posição, com 
destaque em relação aos demais.
CONCLUSÕES: A carga global de doenças crônicas não transmissíveis atribuídas aos 
fatores de risco ocupacionais têm adquirido importância crescente. Sugere-se 
reforçar a abordagem dos fatores de risco ocupacionais nas agendas para 
enfrentamento dessas doenças no Brasil.

BACKGROUND: We compared the cost-effectiveness of 10 weeks of outreach 
rehabilitation (intervention) versus usual care (control) for ambulatory nursing 
home residents after hip fracture.
METHODS: Enrollment occurred February 2011 through June 2015 in a Canadian 
metropolitan region. Seventy-seven participants were allocated in a 2:1 ratio to 
receive a 10-week rehabilitation program (intervention) or usual care (control) 
(46 intervention; 31 control). Using a payer perspective, we performed main and 
sensitivity analyses. Health outcome was measured by quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs), using the EQ5D, completed at study entry, 3-, 6-, and 12-months. We 
obtained patient-specific data for outpatient visits, physician claims, and 
inpatient readmissions; the trial provided rehabilitation utilization/cost data. 
We estimated incremental cost and incremental effectiveness.
RESULTS: Groups were similar at study entry; the mean age was 87.9 ± 6.6 years, 
54 (71%) were female and 58 (75%) had severe cognitive impairment. EQ5D QALYs 
scores were nonsignificantly higher for intervention participants. Inpatient 
readmissions were two times higher among controls, with a cost difference of 
-$3,350/patient for intervention participants, offsetting the cost/intervention 
participant of $2,300 for the outreach rehabilitation. The adjusted incremental 
QALYs/patient difference was 0.024 favoring the intervention, with an 
incremental cost/patient of -$621 for intervention participants; these values 
were not statistically significant. A sensitivity analysis reinforced these 
findings, suggesting that the intervention was likely dominant.
CONCLUSION: A 10-week outreach rehabilitation intervention for nursing home 
residents who sustain a hip fracture may be cost-saving, through reduced 
postfracture hospital readmissions. These results support further work to 
evaluate postfracture rehabilitation for nursing home residents.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is a well-established form 
of treatment for patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony. There are 
two different types of CRT devices: the biventricular pacemaker (CRT-P) and the 
biventricular defibrillator (CRT-D). The latter is more complex but also more 
expensive. For the majority of patients who are eligible for CRT, both devices 
are appropriate according to current guidelines. The purpose of this study was 
to conduct a cost-utility analysis for CRT-D compared to CRT-P from a German 
payer's perspective.
METHODS: A cohort Markov-model was developed to assess average costs and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) for CRT-D and CRT-P. The model consisted of 
six stages: one for the device implementation, one for the absorbing state 
death, and two stages ("Stable" and "Hospital") for either a CRT device or 
medical therapy. The time horizon was 20 years. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CRT-D compared with 
CRT-P was €24,659 per additional QALY gained. In deterministic sensitivity 
analysis, the survival advantage of CRT-D to CRT-P was the most influential 
input parameter. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis 96% of the simulated 
cases were more effective but also more costly.
CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with CRT-D compared to CRT-P resulted in an additional gain 
of QALYs, but was more expensive. In addition, the ICER was subject to 
uncertainty, especially due to the uncertainty in the survival benefit. A 
randomised controlled trial and subgroup analyses would be desirable to further 
inform decision making.

Health System, Morristown, New Jersey, USA.

Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA (MPS IVA), also known as Morquio A syndrome, is 
an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that results from variants in 
the GALNS gene that encodes the enzyme galactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase. This 
syndrome has systemic manifestations including, but not limited to, 
musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, rheumatologic, neurologic, dental, 
ophthalmologic, and otologic. This condition is usually detected within the 
first few years of life with an average life expectancy of 25.3 ± 17.43 years. 
We report the natural history of two of the oldest known females with MPS IVA, 
who were each clinically diagnosed at 4 years of age and who are now 74 and 
70 years of age, respectively. They are both affected by pathogenic variants 
c.319G>A (p.Ala107Thr) and c.824 T>C (p.Leu275Pro) in the GALNS gene.

Free-leg side elevation of pelvis in single-leg jump is a substantial advantage 
over double-leg jump for jumping height generation.

In single-leg jumps, humans achieve more than half the jumping height that they 
can reach for double-leg jumps. Although this bilateral deficit in jumping has 
been believed to be due to the reduction of leg extensor force/work exertions, 
we hypothesised that the three-dimensional biomechanical differences between 
double-leg and single-leg jumps also influence the bilateral deficit in jumping. 
Here, we show the substantial effect of the elevation of the pelvic free-leg 
side in single-leg squat jumps on the bilateral deficit in jumping in addition 
to extensor force reduction. We collected the kinematic and ground reaction 
force data during single-leg and double-leg squat jumps from ten male 
participants using motion capture systems and force platforms. We determined the 
components of the mechanical energy directly contributing to the height of the 
centre of mass due to segment movement. The energy due to rotations of the foot, 
shank, thigh, and pelvis were significantly greater in single-leg squat jumps 
than in double-leg squat jumps. The magnitudes of the difference in energy 
between single-leg and double-leg squat jumps due to the pelvis 
(0.54 ± 0.22 J/kg) was significantly larger than that due to any other segment 
(<0.30 J/kg). This indicates that pelvic elevation in single-leg jump is a 
critical factor causing bilateral deficit in jumping, and that humans generate 
the jumping height with a single leg not just by an explosive leg-extension but 
also by synchronous free-leg side elevation of the pelvis. The findings suggest 
that this pelvic mechanism is a factor characterising human single-leg jumps.

OBJECTIVES: Identify causes and future trends underpinning Scottish mortality 
improvements and quantify the relative contributions of disease incidence and 
survival.
DESIGN: Population-based study.
SETTING: Linked secondary care and mortality records across Scotland.
PARTICIPANTS: 1 967 130 individuals born between 1905 and 1965 and resident in 
Scotland from 2001 to 2016.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital admission rates and survival within 5 years 
postadmission for 28 diseases, stratified by sex and socioeconomic status.
RESULTS: 'Influenza and pneumonia', 'Symptoms and signs involving circulatory 
and respiratory systems' and 'Malignant neoplasm of respiratory and 
intrathoracic organs' were the hospital diagnosis groupings associated with most 
excess deaths, being both common and linked to high postadmission mortality. 
Using disease trends, we modelled a mean mortality HR of 0.737 (95% CI 0.730 to 
0.745) from one decade of birth to the next, equivalent to a life extension of 
~3 years per decade. This improvement was 61% (30%-93%) accounted for by 
improved disease survival after hospitalisation (principally cancer) with the 
remainder accounted for by lowered hospitalisation incidence (principally heart 
disease and cancer). In contrast, deteriorations in infectious disease incidence 
and survival increased mortality by 9% (~3.3 months per decade). Disease-driven 
mortality improvements were slightly greater for men than women (due to greater 
falls in disease incidence), and generally similar across socioeconomic deciles. 
We project mortality improvements will continue over the next decade but slow by 
21% because much progress in disease survival has already been achieved.
CONCLUSION: Morbidity improvements broadly explain observed mortality 
improvements, with progress on prevention and treatment of heart disease and 
cancer contributing the most. The male-female health gaps are closing, but those 
between socioeconomic groups are not. Slowing improvements in morbidity may 
explain recent stalling in improvements of UK period life expectancies. However, 
these could be offset if we accelerate improvements in the diseases accounting 
for most deaths and counteract recent deteriorations in infectious disease.

BACKGROUND: To estimate the potential gain in life expectancy from addressing 
modifiable risk factors for all-cause mortality (excluding suicide and deaths 
from accidents or violence) across specific serious mental illness (SMI) 
subgroups, namely schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, and bipolar 
disorders in a Western population.
METHODS: We have used relative risks from recent meta-analyses to estimate the 
population attribution fraction (PAF) due to specific modifiable risk factors 
known to be associated with all-cause mortality within SMI. The potential gain 
in life expectancy at birth, age 50 and age 65 years were assessed by estimating 
the combined effect of modifiable risk factors from different contextual levels 
(behavioural, healthcare, social) and accounting for the effectiveness of 
existing interventions tackling these factors. Projections for annual gain in 
life expectancy at birth during a two-decade was estimated using the Annual 
Percentage Change (APC) formula. The predicted estimates were based on mortality 
rates for year 2014-2015.
RESULTS: Based on the effectiveness of existing interventions targeting these 
modifiable risk factors, we estimated potential gain in life expectancy at birth 
of four (bipolar disorders), six (schizoaffective disorders), or seven years 
(schizophrenia). The gain in life expectancy at age 50 years was three (bipolar 
disorders) or five (schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders) years. The 
projected gain in life expectancy at age 65 years was three (bipolar disorders) 
or four (schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders) years.
CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of existing interventions targeting modifiable 
risk factors could narrow the current mortality gap between the general and the 
SMI populations by 24% (men) to 28% (women). These projections represent ideal 
circumstances and without the limitation of overestimation which often comes 
with PAFs.

Prognosis in young women less than 40 years of age with brain metastasis from 
breast cancer.

Montréal, Montreal, QC.

BACKGROUND: Brain metastasis from breast cancer (bca) in young women is doubly 
devastating because both quality of life and life expectancy are significantly 
reduced. With new radiation technology and drugs that have emerged, survival is 
expected to increase for these young women.
METHODS: Using the oacis and sardo patient databases, we identified 121 patients 
diagnosed with bca and brain metastasis between 2006 and 2016 at the University 
of Montreal Hospital Centre. Those patients were divided into Group A, patients 
who developed brain metastasis during the evolution of metastatic bca, and Group 
B, patients whose first metastasis was to the brain. For each group, we compared 
young patients (<40 years of age) with older patients (≥40 years of age).
RESULTS: Among the 121 patients with brain metastasis, median overall survival 
(mos) was significantly longer for those less than 40 years of age than for 
those 40 or more years of age (18 months vs. 4 months, p < 0.001). With respect 
to the timing of brain metastasis, survival was significantly longer in Group B 
than in Group A (7 months vs. 4 months, p = 0.032). In Group A, mos was 
significantly longer for patients less than 40 years of age than for patients 40 
or more years of age (18 months vs. 3 months, p = 0.0089). In Group B, the 
2-year overall survival rate was 57% for patients less than 40 years of age and 
12% for those 40 or more years of age (mos: not reached vs. 7 months; p = 
0.259).
CONCLUSIONS: In our single-centre retrospective cohort of women with brain 
metastasis from bca, prognosis was better for young women (<40 years) than for 
older women (≥40 years). Survival was also longer for patients whose initial 
metastasis was to the brain than for patients whose brain metastasis developed 
later in the disease course. In patients who received systemic treatment, median 
survival remained significantly higher in women less than 40 years of age. 
Further studies are needed to validate those results.

Background: Height is considered an indicator of health and well-being of an 
individual and population. Height variation results from a complex interaction 
of genetic, environmental, socioeconomic, and cultural influences. In order to 
understand the contribution of environmental stress associated with the child's 
growth, we correlated indicators of a stressful environment with adult height. 
Methods: We utilized seven equally weighted indicators of a stressful 
environment: homicide rates, GDP per capita, income inequality (GINI index), 
corruption perception index (CPI), unemployment rate, urban air pollution, and 
life expectancy (LE). Data on male and female height by country from 1992 to 
1996 were obtained from the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration dataset. We assessed 
separately data from the 31 member countries of the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD). In order to establish whether the 
indicators reflected a single conceptual dimension, we conducted an exploratory 
analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) with orthogonal transformation 
of the original variables. The relationships between male and female heights and 
the z-transformed principal components: Quality of life (QoL) and the Social 
factor (SF) that were derived after the PCA was assessed. Results: Male and 
female heights strongly correlated (p < 0.0001) with each of the seven 
indicators. In the PCA, the indicators clustered into "Quality of Life" factors 
(QoL), which comprised the CPI, GDP, air pollution, LE, and "Social factors" 
(SF), which comprised homicide rate and GINI index. For males and females, the 
average height by country strongly correlated with QoL (p < 0.0001) and SF (p < 
0.0001). Within OECD countries, male and female height strongly and negatively 
correlated with the SF, but not with QoL. Conclusion: Growth attenuation is a 
tradeoff adaptive response: a calorie used for growth cannot be used for 
fighting stress. Here we show that: (1) Adult height, when used as a measure of 
child's growth, is an indicator of a stressful environment in context with the 
genetic background and spatial factors; (2) Stressful QoL factors and the SF 
exert a greater effect on men's height than women's height; and (3) The ranking 
of the indicators of short stature are income inequality > air pollution > GDP > 
CPI > homicide rate > LE > unemployment.

INTRODUCTION: Thyroid gland fibrosarcomas are extremely rare tumors, and only 
very few cases have been described in the literature. There are no set 
recommendations along with follow-ups regarding the treatment of these tumors. 
Moreover, the prognosis is poor with a very short life expectancy.
CASE REPORT: We present an 81-year-old patient who was suffering from increasing 
dysphagia and dysphonia related to a painless giant cervical mass, which 
presented with progressive growth for the preceding months. After a core needle 
biopsy with a suspicion of a solitary fibrous tumor, total excision of the tumor 
was successfully performed, and the pathology examination revealed a 
fibrosarcoma. Following surgery, radiotherapy was decided in the oncological 
multidisciplinary meeting; however, the patient refused it. There were neither 
new clinical symptoms nor tumor recurrence after an 18-month follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Although it is a very rare tumor, primary fibrosarcoma of the 
thyroid gland should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of neck 
tumors.

OBJECTIVE: Liver neoplasms are problematic among small domestic animals. The 
etiological cause of hepatocellular carcinomas in domestic animals is still 
unknown although it is believed that chronic infections and toxic substances can 
affect the development of this type of tumor. This study aimed to analyze the 
clinical and morphological characteristics of canine hepatocellular carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 6,958 cancer operations were performed in the 
clinic. Liver tumors were detected in 123 dogs in vivo and 375 dogs postmortem. 
All animals with suspected liver neoplasm were assessed, including history, 
clinical examination, complete blood count, biochemical blood tests, 
radiographic examination, and ultrasound with a biopsy for performing 
cytological and histological analyses.
RESULTS: Hepatocellular carcinomas have nonspecific clinical manifestations, 
also a characteristic aspect of other tumors of the hepatobiliary system. The 
hematological changes have an impact on the prognosis, and biochemical 
abnormalities reflect the changes in liver activity. The cytological diagnosis 
of hepatocellular tumors is difficult because of hepatocyte atypia in highly 
differentiated carcinomas. Finally, a histological examination was performed in 
all the dogs diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma.
CONCLUSION: Hematological changes in dogs with hepatocellular carcinoma affect 
their prognosis. Biochemical abnormalities of this pathology reflect the changes 
in liver activity, not indicating a specific pathology. However, an increase in 
the activity of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and 
alkaline phosphatase is an unfavorable prognostic sign. In this study, five of 
seven dogs with a tumor size of more than 5.0 cm had a life expectancy of 30, 
51, and 91 days, suggesting that the size of the tumor is an adverse prognostic 
factor.

BACKGROUND: A very large number of studies have reported a stalling of health 
improvements in the UK since 2010.
SOURCES OF DATA: Almost all relevant data are produced by the Office for 
National Statistics and other national statistical agencies.
AREAS OF AGREEMENT: There has been a dramatic slowdown in life expectancy and 
diverging trends in infant mortality in the UK as a whole and England and Wales, 
respectively.
AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Many commentators are loath to describe the falls in life 
expectancy as actual falls or to ascribe blame to the political situation in the 
UK.
GROWING POINTS: Health trends in the UK are worrying and raise important 
questions about government policies.
AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: These findings point to a need for greater 
investment in research on the political determinants of health, on the timely 
detection and interpretation of evidence of worsening health, and on how 
political and policy processes respond to such findings.

The multidisciplinary co-management program for geriatric patients with hip 
fracture is cost-effective in the Chinese population and it has the potential to 
be scaled up in China.
INTRODUCTION: The study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of a 
multidisciplinary co-management program for patients with hip fracture in China.
METHODS: Hip fracture patients who were admitted to an orthopedic hospital in 
Beijing were included in the multidisciplinary co-management program. The 
cost-effectiveness of intervention was evaluated compared to the conventional 
management. A Markov microsimulation model was developed to simulate lifetime 
costs and effectiveness. Costs including intervention, hospitalization, 
medications, and long-term care costs were expressed using 2019 US dollars and 
the healthcare perspective was adopted. Effectiveness was evaluated using both 
1-year mortality-averted and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs and 
effectiveness were discounted at 5% per annum. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
threshold was set at $26,481 per QALY gained which was three times gross 
domestic product (GDP) per capita in China. One-way and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The lifetime cost for the conventional management (n = 1839) and 
intervention group (n = 1192) was $11,975 and $13,309 respectively. The lifetime 
QALYs were 2.38 and 2.45 years and the first-year mortality was 17.8% and 16.1%. 
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $19,437 per QALY gained or $78,412 
per 1-year mortality-averted. Given the Chinese WTP threshold, the intervention 
had a 78% chance being cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness of the 
intervention was sensitive to cost of intervention and the proportion of 
patients who underwent surgery within 48 h.
CONCLUSIONS: The multidisciplinary co-management program for patients with hip 
fracture is cost-effective and it has the potential to be scaled up in the 
Chinese population.

This analysis examined costs/resources of 141 women with vertebral fractures, 
randomised to a home exercise programme or control group. Total, mean costs and 
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. Quality of life 
was collected. Cost drivers were caregiver time, medications and adverse events 
(AEs). Results show adding an exercise programme may reduce the risk of AEs.
INTRODUCTION: This exploratory economic analysis examined the health resource 
utilisation and costs experienced by women with vertebral fractures, and 
explored the effects of home exercise on those costs.
METHODS: Women ≥ 65 years with one or more X-ray-confirmed vertebral fractures 
were randomised 1:1 to a 12-month home exercise programme or equal attention 
control group. Clinical and health system resources were collected during 
monthly phone calls and daily diaries completed by participants. Intervention 
costs were included. Unit costs were applied to health system resources. Quality 
of life (QoL) information was collected via EQ-5D-5L at baseline, 6 and 
12 months.
RESULTS: One hundred and forty-one women were randomised. Overall total 
costs (CAD 2018) were $664,923 (intervention) and $614,033 (control), 
respectively. The top three cost drivers were caregiver time ($250,269 and 
$240,811), medications ($151,000 and $122,145) and AEs ($58,807 and $71,981). 
The mean cost per intervention participant of $9365 ± $9988 was higher compared 
with the mean cost per control participant of $8772 ± $9718. The mean EQ-5D 
index score was higher for the intervention participants (0.81 ± 0.11) compared 
with that of controls (0.79 ± 0.13). The differences in quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) (0.02) and mean cost ($593) were used to calculate the ICER of 
$29,650.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with osteoporosis with a previous fracture experience a 
number of resources and associated costs that impact their care and quality of 
life. Caregiver time, medications and AEs are the biggest cost drivers for this 
population. The next steps would be to expand this feasibility study with more 
participants, longer-term follow-up and more regional variability.

INTRODUCTION: Many HIV-positive individuals in Africa have advanced disease when 
initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) so have high risks of opportunistic 
infections and death. The REALITY trial found that an enhanced-prophylaxis 
package including fluconazole reduced mortality by 27% in individuals starting 
ART with CD4 <100 cells/mm3 . We investigated the cost-effectiveness of this 
enhanced-prophylaxis package versus other strategies, including using 
cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing, in individuals with CD4 <200 cells/mm3 or 
<100 cells/mm3 at ART initiation and all individuals regardless of CD4 count.
METHODS: The REALITY trial enrolled from June 2013 to April 2015. A 
decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of six 
management strategies in individuals initiating ART in the REALITY trial 
countries. Strategies included standard-prophylaxis, enhanced-prophylaxis, 
standard-prophylaxis with fluconazole; and three CrAg testing strategies, the 
first stratifying individuals to enhanced-prophylaxis (CrAg-positive) or 
standard-prophylaxis (CrAg-negative), the second to enhanced-prophylaxis 
(CrAg-positive) or enhanced-prophylaxis without fluconazole (CrAg-negative) and 
the third to standard-prophylaxis with fluconazole (CrAg-positive) or without 
fluconazole (CrAg-negative). The model estimated costs, life-years and 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) over 48 weeks using three competing mortality 
risks: cryptococcal meningitis; tuberculosis, serious bacterial infection or 
other known cause; and unknown cause.
RESULTS: Enhanced-prophylaxis was cost-effective at cost-effectiveness 
thresholds of US$300 and US$500 per QALY with an incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratio (ICER) of US$157 per QALY in the CD4 <200 cells/mm3 population providing 
enhanced-prophylaxis components are sourced at lowest available prices. The ICER 
reduced in more severely immunosuppressed individuals (US$113 per QALY in the 
CD4 <100 cells/mm3 population) and increased in all individuals regardless of 
CD4 count (US$722 per QALY). Results were sensitive to prices of the 
enhanced-prophylaxis components. Enhanced-prophylaxis was more effective and 
less costly than all CrAg testing strategies as enhanced-prophylaxis still 
conveyed health gains in CrAg-negative patients and savings from targeting 
prophylaxis based on CrAg status did not compensate for costs of CrAg testing. 
CrAg testing strategies did not become cost-effective unless the price of CrAg 
testing fell below US$2.30.
CONCLUSIONS: The REALITY enhanced-prophylaxis package in individuals with 
advanced HIV starting ART reduces morbidity and mortality, is practical to 
administer and is cost-effective. Efforts should continue to ensure that 
components are accessed at lowest available prices.

BACKGROUND: In perioperative settings, frailty assessment has been shown to 
reduce mortality. This study examined the cost effectiveness of frailty 
assessment among patients aged 65 with coronary artery disease under 
consideration for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
METHODS: A combined decision tree and Markov model was developed to estimate 
costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 21-year time horizon. 
Clinical parameters were obtained from published literature. Utilities were 
derived from the literature and the Canadian Community Health Survey. Costs were 
obtained from the Ontario fee schedule and published literature. Sensitivity and 
scenario analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. 
Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) analysis was conducted to estimate 
the value of further research.
RESULTS: The frailty assessment initiative had a lower average cost than no 
frailty assessment ($19,567 compared with $20,062). QALYs with frailty 
assessment were 0.47 years more than with no frailty assessment. Thus, frailty 
assessment was dominant compared with no frailty assessment. Results were robust 
to changes in the input parameters. At a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 
$50,000/QALY, there was 100% probability of frailty assessment being 
cost-effective, and the EVPI per patient was $0. Scenario and sensitivity 
analysis showed frailty screening remained cost effective when changing the 
cohort average age, removing health benefits for nonfrail patients, and using
