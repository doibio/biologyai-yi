Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most dominant pathogens in cystic fibrosis 
(CF) airway disease and contributes to significant inflammation, airway damage, 
and poorer disease outcomes. The CF airway is now known to be host to a complex 
community of microorganisms, and polymicrobial interactions have been shown to 
play an important role in shaping P. aeruginosa pathogenicity and resistance. P. 
aeruginosa can cause chronic infections that once established are almost 
impossible to eradicate with antibiotics. CF patients that develop chronic P. 
aeruginosa infection have poorer lung function, higher morbidity, and a reduced 
life expectancy. P. aeruginosa adapts to the CF airway and quickly develops 
resistance to several antibiotics. A perplexing phenomenon is the disparity 
between in vitro antimicrobial sensitivity testing and clinical response. 
Considering the CF airway is host to a diverse community of microorganisms or 
'microbiome' and that these microorganisms are known to interact, the 
antimicrobial resistance and progression of P. aeruginosa infection is likely 
influenced by these microbial relationships. This review combines the literature 
to date on interactions between P. aeruginosa and other airway microorganisms 
and the influence of these interactions on P. aeruginosa tolerance to 
antimicrobials.

Bowel ultrasound (BUS) is a non-invasive and accurate technique for assessing 
activity, extension of disease, and complications in inflammatory bowel 
diseases. The main advantages of BUS are its safety, reproducibility, and low 
costs. Ancillary technologies of BUS (i.e., color Doppler and wave elastography) 
could broaden the diagnostic power of BUS, allowing one to distinguish between 
inflammation and fibrosis. Considering the costs and invasiveness of colonoscopy 
and magnetic resonance, BUS appears as a fast, safe, and accurate technique. The 
objective measures of disease allow one to make clinical decisions, such as 
optimization, switch, or swap of therapy. Previous studies reported a 
sensitivity and a specificity of more than 90% compared to endoscopy and 
magnetic resonance. Lastly, transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) is a promising 
approach for the evaluation of perianal disease in Crohn's disease (CD) and 
disease activity in patients with ulcerative proctitis or pouchitis. Bowel 
ultrasound is being incorporated in the algorithm of managing inflammatory bowel 
diseases. Transmural healing evaluated through ultrasonography is emerging as a 
complementary target for disease treatment. In this review, we aimed to 
summarize and discuss the current evidence on BUS in the management of 
inflammatory bowel diseases and to address the challenges of a full validation 
of this technique.

By using ultrasonography, we measured the longitudinal movement distance of the 
deep fascia (LMDDF), change of the pennation angle (PA) and muscle thickness 
(MT) in both the tensor fasciae latae muscle (TFL) and the gluteus medius muscle 
(G-Med) during passive movement of the toes/ankle joints. 21 right lower limbs 
of 21 healthy males were evaluated in this study. We measured the LMDDF of the 
TFL and G-Med by measuring distance between the designated landmark on skin and 
the intersection of the major deep-fascia (D-fascia) and the fascial bundle. We 
also measured change of the PA and MT of both muscles. Additionally, we also 
measured the reliability of the measurement and the measurement error. The 
measurement was performed during three manual positions on the toes/ankle; 
manual holding of the toes and ankle joint in neutral, toes flexion and ankle 
plantar flexion/inversion position, toes extension and ankle extension/valgus 
position. The existence of muscle contraction of both the muscles during passive 
motion was monitored by active surface electrodes. This study confirmed mobility 
of the D-fascia in which the TFL's D-fascia moves and change of muscle shape in 
the distal direction during no muscle contraction due to passive movement. This 
fact suggests the possibility that passive tension on fascia tissue of the ankle 
extends to the proximal part of the limb, i.e., to the D-fascia of the TFL.

More Power with Flower for the Pupal Parasitoid Trichopria drosophilae: A 
Candidate for Biological Control of the Spotted Wing Drosophila.

Institute for Biological Control, Heinrichstr. 243, 64287 Darmstadt, Germany.

Parasitoids are currently considered for biological control of the spotted wing 
drosophila (SWD) in berry crops. Releases of mass-reared parasitoids require the 
presence of all resources necessary to ensure their effectiveness in the crop 
system. The use of floral resources to feed Trichopria drosophilae, one of the 
candidate species, was investigated in a laboratory study. The life expectancy 
of males and females increased by three to four times when they had access to 
flowers of buckwheat or of two cultivars of sweet alyssum. Female realized 
lifetime fecundity increased from 27 offspring/female exposed to water only to 
69 offspring/female exposed to buckwheat flowers. According to this almost 
threefold increase in parasitoid fitness, it is advisable to introduce flowering 
plants into the crop system, when parasitoid releases are carried out. Sweet 
alyssum offers the advantage of not growing too tall in combination with an 
extended blooming. However, adult SWD were also able to feed on flowers of both 
plants and survived for at least 27 days, much longer than starving flies. The 
introduction of flowering plants to promote natural enemies therefore requires 
further consideration of the risk-benefit balance under field conditions to 
prevent unintended reinforcement of this pest.

In Pakistan, Apis cerana, the Asian honeybee, has been used for honey production 
and pollination services. However, its genomic makeup and phylogenetic 
relationship with those in other countries are still unknown. We collected A. 
cerana samples from the main cerana-keeping region in Pakistan and performed 
whole genome sequencing. A total of 28 Gb of Illumina shotgun reads were 
generated, which were used to assemble the genome. The obtained genome assembly 
had a total length of 214 Mb, with a GC content of 32.77%. The assembly had a 
scaffold N50 of 2.85 Mb and a BUSCO completeness score of 99%, suggesting a 
remarkably complete genome sequence for A. cerana in Pakistan. A MAKER pipeline 
was employed to annotate the genome sequence, and a total of 11,864 
protein-coding genes were identified. Of them, 6750 genes were assigned at least 
one GO term, and 8813 genes were annotated with at least one protein domain. 
Genome-scale phylogeny analysis indicated an unexpectedly close relationship 
between A. cerana in Pakistan and those in China, suggesting a potential human 
introduction of the species between the two countries. Our results will 
facilitate the genetic improvement and conservation of A. cerana in Pakistan.

AIMS: The higher prevalence of chronic physical health conditions among people 
with psychotic disorders may result in a reduced life expectancy as compared to 
the general population. More research is needed on the risk of multiple 
co-occurring chronic health conditions, known as multimorbidity, for people with 
psychotic disorders.
METHODS: We conducted a matched retrospective cohort study to quantify the 
prevalence of multimorbidity and associated factors among people with psychotic 
disorders over the 10-year period following first diagnosis, relative to those 
without psychosis. Data from an early psychosis intervention program in London, 
Canada were linked to population-based health administrative data to identify 
patients with first-episode psychosis (nâ=â439), and a comparison group from the 
general population (nâ=â1759) matched on age, sex, and postal code. We followed 
the cohort for 10 years to ascertain the prevalence of multimorbidity. We 
compared people with and without psychosis using modified Poisson regression 
models, and explored risk factors for multimorbidity among those with psychotic 
disorders.
RESULTS: People with psychotic disorders may have a 26% higher prevalence of 
multimorbidity 10 years following first diagnosis, although our findings include 
the possibility of a null effect (PRâ=â1.26, 95% CI 0.96-1.66). People with 
psychosis living in areas with the highest levels of material deprivation had a 
threefold higher prevalence of multimorbidity as compared to those in the lowest 
areas of material deprivation (PRâ=â3.09, 95% CI 1.21-7.90).
CONCLUSION: Multimorbidity is prevalent among those with psychosis, and 
assessment for chronic health conditions should be integrated into clinical care 
for younger populations with psychotic illness.

This study evaluated different varicella vaccination strategies in Jiangsu 
province, China. A decision-tree Markov model was used to evaluate the cost 
effectiveness of various varicella vaccination strategies for children, 
including direct and selective vaccination (serotesting pre-vaccination). A 
cohort of one-year-old children was followed through 60 one-year Markov cycles. 
The parameter estimation was based on field work, the literature, and 
statistical yearbooks. We calculated the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) 
using the saved quality-adjusted life year (QALY). One-way and probability 
sensitivity analyses were performed to assess uncertainty. Among 100,000 cohort 
members, one-dose and two-dose direct vaccination averted 8061 and 10,701 
varicella cases, respectively, compared with no vaccination. Furthermore, 
compared with no vaccination, one-dose and two-dose direct vaccination saved one 
QALY at the ICUR of USD 21,401.33 and USD 35,420.81, respectively, at less than 
three times the per capita gross domestic product (USD 47,626.86) of Jiangsu. 
The ICURs of the one-dose and two-dose selective strategies versus no 
vaccination were USD 42,623.62 and USD 51,406.35 per QALY gained, respectively. 
The cost effectiveness results were most sensitive to the QALY loss of 
outpatients and vaccine prices. Thus, in Jiangsu, one-dose and two-dose direct 
varicella vaccination in children could be cost effective at the willingness to 
pay threshold of three times provincial GDP per capita from a societal 
perspective. The findings were sensitive to the vaccine price and health utility 
of varicella cases.

AIMS: The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected over two hundred million 
worldwide and caused 4.4 million of deaths as of August 2021. Vaccines were 
quickly developed to address the pandemic. We sought to analyze the 
cost-effectiveness and budget impact of a non-specified vaccine for COVID-19.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov model of COVID-19 infections 
using a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered structure over a 1-year time 
horizon from a U.S. healthcare sector perspective. The model consisted of two 
arms: do nothing and COVID-19 vaccine. Hospitalization and mortality rates were 
calibrated to U.S. COVID-19 reports as of November 2020. We performed economic 
calculations of costs in 2020âU.S. dollars and effectiveness in units of 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to measure the budget impact and incremental 
cost-effectiveness at a $100,000/QALY threshold.
RESULTS: Vaccines have a high probability of reducing healthcare costs and 
increasing QALYs compared to doing nothing. Simulations showed reductions in 
hospital days and mortality by more than 50%. Even though this represents a 
major U.S. investment, the budget impacts of these technologies could save 
program costs by up to 60% or more if uptake is high.
LIMITATIONS: The economic evaluation draws on the reported values of the 
clinical benefits of COVID-19 vaccines, although we do not currently have 
long-term conclusive data about COVID-19 vaccine efficacies.
CONCLUSIONS: Spending on vaccines to mitigate COVID-19 infections offer 
high-value potential that society should consider. Unusually high uptake in 
vaccines in a short amount of time could result in unprecedented budget impacts 
to government and commercial payers. Governments should focus on expanding 
health system infrastructure and subsidizing payer coverage to deliver these 
vaccines efficiently.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Healthy diet has been associated with decreased mortality, 
but its impact on survival without disability is less clear. We aimed to 
investigate the association between the Nordic Prudent Diet Pattern (NPDP) and 
dementia- and disability-free survival, and to assess its interaction with other 
healthy lifestyle behaviors.
METHODS: Within the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care-Kungsholmen, 2290 
dementia- and disability-free adults aged â¥60 were followed up to 12 years to 
detect survival free from dementia (standard criteria) and disability (Katz's 
Activities of Daily Living). NPDP index was assessed at baseline with a 98-item 
food frequency questionnaire (characterized mainly by more frequent intakes of 
vegetable, fruit, cooking, cereals, whole grains, fish, and water) and was 
further categorized into tertiles (low, moderate, or high). Information on 
lifestyle factors was collected via baseline questionnaire. A favorable 
(vsÂ unfavorable) lifestyle profile was determined based on smoking status, 
social network and physical activity. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional 
hazard regression models and Laplace regression.
RESULTS: During the follow-up, 1074 participants survived without dementia and 
disability (614 died, 518 became disabled, and 84 developed dementia). Compared 
to low NPDP adherence, the hazard ratio (HR) of high NPDP adherence was 1.19 
(95% CI 1.04-1.34) for dementia- and disability-free survival. High NPDP 
adherence prolonged lifespan without mental and physical disability by an 
average of 1.24 years (95% CI 0.11-2.37). Further, among participants with high 
NPDP adherence, a favorable lifestyle profile was associated with an even higher 
HR (1.96, 95% CI 1.52-2.42) of dementia- and disability-free survival, 
corresponding to an average of 3.80 (95% CI 2.25-5.35) years longer life 
compared to those with low NPDP adherence and an unfavorable lifestyle profile.
CONCLUSION: High adherence to NPDP prolongs survival with good mental and 
physical function for more than one year, and this could increase to almost four 
years with a favorable lifestyle.

This article aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intensive 
neurorehabilitation in paraplegic cats, with no deep pain perception (grade 0 on 
the modified Frankel scale), with more than three months of injury. Nine cats, 
admitted to the ArrÃ¡bida Veterinary Hospital/ArrÃ¡bida Animal Rehabilitation 
Center (CRAA), were subjected to a 12-week intensive functional 
neurorehabilitation protocol, based on ground and underwater treadmill locomotor 
training, electrostimulation, and kinesiotherapy exercises, aiming to obtain a 
faster recovery to ambulation and a modulated locomotor pattern of 
flexion/extension. Of the nine cats that were admitted in this study, 56% (n = 
5) recovered from ambulation, 44% of which (4/9) did so through functional 
spinal locomotion by reflexes, while one achieved this through the recovery of 
deep pain perception. These results suggest that intensive neurorehabilitation 
can play an important role in ambulation recovery, allowing for a better quality 
of life and well-being, which may lead to a reduction in the number of 
euthanasia procedures performed on paraplegic animals.

Pulmonary hypertension is a rare condition that impairs patients' quality of 
life and life expectancy. The development of noninvasive instruments may help 
elucidate the prognosis of this cardiorespiratory disease. We aimed to evaluate 
the utility of routinely performed noninvasive test results as prognostic 
markers in patients with pulmonary hypertension. We enrolled 198 patients with 
mean pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHg measured at cardiac catheterisation or 
echocardiographic pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 40 mmHg and tricuspid 
regurgitation Vmax >2.9 m/s, and clinical information regarding management and 
follow-up studies from the date of diagnosis. Multivariate analysis revealed 
that female sex [HR: 0.21, (95% CI: 0.07-0.64); p = 0.006], the presence of 
collagenopathies [HR: 8.63, (95% CI: 2.38-31.32); p = 0.001], an increased red 
blood cell distribution width [HR: 1.25, (95% CI: 1.04-1.49); p = 0.017] and an 
increased electrocardiographic P axis (PÂ°)/T axis (TÂ°) ratio [HR: 0.93, (95% CI: 
0.88-0.98); p = 0.009] were severity-associated factors, while older age [HR: 
1.57, (95% CI: 1.04-1.28); p = 0.006], an increased QRS axis (QRSÂ°)/TÂ° ratio 
[HR: 1.21, (95% CI: 1.09-1.34); p < 0.001], forced expiratory volume in 1 s [HR: 
0.94, (95% CI: 0.91-0.98); p = 0.01] and haematocrit [HR: 0.93, (95% CI: 
0.87-0.99); p = 0.04] were mortality-associated factors. Our results support the 
importance of red blood cell distribution width, electrocardiographic ratios and 
collagenopathies for assessing pulmonary hypertension prognosis.

A home-use test (HUT) is one method that provides a measure of ecological 
validity as the product is consumed in home under common daily use 
circumstances. One product that benefits from being evaluated in-home are 
ready-to-eat (RTE) meals. This study determined consumer acceptance of 
microwave-thermally-pasteurized jambalaya, a multi-meat and vegetable dish from 
American Cajun cuisine, and a control (cooked frozen jambalaya) through an 
on-line home-use test (HUT) over a 12-week storage period. Paralleling the HUT, 
an online auction determined consumers' willingness to pay. The study also 
explored how the social environment may impact the liking of the meals when a 
partner of the participants joined the sensory evaluation of the meals. 
Consumers (n = 50) evaluated microwave-processed jambalaya stored at 2 Â°C and a 
control (cooked frozen jambalaya stored at -31 Â°C) after 2, 8 and 12 weeks of 
storage. Consumer liking of different sensory attributes was measured. 
Participants could choose to share the meals with a partner as a way to enhance 
ecological validity. The responses from 21 partners to the sensory-related 
questions were collected. After the sensory evaluation, the participants bid on 
the meal they had just sampled. Results showed that processing method (microwave 
vs. control) did not significantly influence the measured sensory attributes. 
Only flavor liking decreased over storage time (p < 0.05). The inclusion of 
partners significantly increased (p = 0.04) the liking of the appearance of the 
meals. The mean values of the bids for the meals ranged from $3.33-3.74, 
matching prices of commercially available jambalaya meals. This study found 
suggests that the shelf- life of microwave-processed meals could be extended up 
to 12 weeks without changing its overall liking. The study also shows the 
importance of exploring HUT methodology for the evaluation of consumers' 
acceptance of microwave-processed jambalaya and how including a partner could 
contribute to enhance ecological validity.

Treatment abandonment is a leading cause of death in children with 
retinoblastoma worldwide. We studied children who abandoned treatment upfront at 
diagnosis to delineate the natural history of untreated retinoblastoma. Studied 
were children who received no treatment, diagnosed between 2007 and 2017 at 29 
Chinese centers. Data were retrospectively collected from medical chart reviews 
and interviews with each patient's family. During the study period, 44 children 
received no treatment after diagnosis of retinoblastoma. Clinical or radiologic 
evidence of orbital extension was available for 25 children, and radiologic 
evidence of systemic metastasis was available for 12 children. Median times from 
diagnosis of intraocular tumor to orbital disease was 13.7 months, orbital 
disease to metastasis was 2.6 months, and metastasis to death was 2.0 months. 
Children with brain metastasis had shorter survival than those with metastasis 
to other sites (median 1.0 vs. 3.1 months; p = 0.015). Overall, 36% of patients 
died within 12 months of diagnosis, 77% within 24 months, 95% within 36 months 
and 100% within 48 months. While multiple factors influence refusal of 
treatment, insights into the natural history of retinoblastoma derived from 
real-world evidence can inform clinicians and parents that retinoblastoma is 
life-threatening and encourage urgent treatment at diagnosis.

Pediatric sarcoma patients with pleuropulmonary lesions have a dismal prognosis 
because the impossibility to obtain local control. The aim of this study was to 
determine if pleuropneumonectomy (PP) could be a therapeutic option. We 
retrospectively reviewed nine patients who underwent salvage PP for 
pleuropulmonary localization of primary localized sarcoma or metastatic 
recurrence. Surgery and complications were analyzed, pulmonary function tests 
were conducted, and quality of life was determined with EORTC-QLQ-C30 
questionnaire. At the time of PP age was between 9-17 years. Underlying disease 
included metastatic osteosarcoma (n = 5), Ewing sarcoma (two metastatic, one 
primary), and one primary undifferentiated sarcoma. Early complications occurred 
in three patients. Mean postoperative hospitalization stay was 14.5 days. 
Pulmonary function test showed 19-66% reduction of total lung capacity which led 
to mild exercise intolerance but did not affect daily life. Four patients died 
of multi-metastatic relapse <14 months after PP, one patient had a local 
recurrence, and four patients are in complete remission between 1.5 and 12 years 
after PP. In conclusion, in this small patient group treated with a 
pleuropneumonectomy for primary or metastatic lesions, outcome is variable; 
however, this extended surgical technique was generally quite well tolerated. 
Postoperative lung function seems well preserved, and it seems to lead to at 
least an extension of life with good quality and therefor can be considered as 
salvage therapy.

No studies have evaluated the influence of pharmaceutical copayment on hospital 
admission rates using time series analysis. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the 
relationship between hospital admission rates and the influence of the 
introduction of a pharmaceutical copayment system (PCS). In July 2012, a PCS was 
implemented in Spain, and we designed a time series analysis (1978-2018) to 
assess its impact on emergency hospital admissions. Hospital admission rates 
were estimated between 1978 and 2018 each month using the Hospital Morbidity 
Survey in Spain (the number of urgent hospital admissions per 100,000 
inhabitants). This was conducted for men, women and both and for all-cause, 
cardiovascular and respiratory hospital discharges. Life expectancy was obtained 
from the National Institute of Statistics. The copayment variable took a value 
of 0 before its implementation (pre-PCS: January 1978-June 2012) and 1 after 
that (post-PCS: July 2012-December 2018). ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated 
Moving Average) (2,0,0)(1,0,0) models were estimated with two predictors (life 
expectancy and copayment implementation). Pharmaceutical copayment did not 
influence hospital admission rates (with p-values between 0.448 and 0.925) and 
there was even a reduction in the rates for most of the analyses performed. In 
conclusion, the PCS did not influence hospital admission rates. More studies are 
needed to design health policies that strike a balance between the amount 
contributed by the taxpayer and hospital admission rates.

Nowadays people are living longer, and there has been a substantial growth in 
the global elderly population in the past decades. While life expectancy is 
increasing, there are growing concerns towards the heavy financial and social 
burdens related to chronic diseases among the elderly. These have been critical 
health care issues, and healthy ageing is considered a top priority in public 
health. Diet and eating habits are crucial factors contributing to healthy 
ageing. These important aspects have attracted much attention in health 
research, particularly in consideration of the causes and management of chronic 
conditions which affect most elder adults in the world. Recently, a growing 
number of investigations have reported significant findings on the association 
of reduction in the risks of chronic non-communicable diseases with plant-based 
diets. Meanwhile, there have been worldwide initiatives and programmes 
implemented for reduction of salt intake. A green diet, which emphasises the 
consumption of a diet rich in plant foods with minimal portions of red or 
processed meat and reduced salt intake, is advocated with due consideration to 
the importance of sustainable environment and healthy ageing. This paper 
highlights a brief review of the recent advance of knowledge in diet and health, 
its effects on the elderly and the significance of a green diet on healthy 
ageing. Implications for a green diet and recommendations for future research 
are also discussed.

Over the last hundred years, life expectancy in developed countries has 
increased because of healthier living habits and the treatment of chronic 
pathologies causing premature aging. Aging is an inexorable, time-dependent, 
multifactorial process characterized by a series of progressive and irreversible 
physiological changes associated with loss of functional, psychological, and 
social capabilities. Numerous factors, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, 
and cellular senescence, and an irreversible geriatric syndrome known as 
frailty, contribute to human body deterioration in aging. The speed of aging may 
differ between individuals depending on the presence or absence of multiple 
factors (genetic and/or environment) and the subsequent misbalance of 
homeostasis, together with the increase of frailty, which also plays a key role 
in developing chronic diseases. In addition, pathological circumstances have 
been reported to precipitate or accelerate the aging process. This review 
investigated the mechanisms involved in the developing pathologies, particularly 
chronic kidney disease, associated with aging.

Flowering is a morphogenetic process in which angiosperms shift from vegetative 
growth to reproductive growth. Flowering time has a strong influence on fruit 
growth, which is closely related to productivity. Therefore, research on crop 
flowering time is particularly important. To better understand the flowering 
period of the tomato, we performed transcriptome sequencing of early flower buds 
and flowers during the extension period in the later-flowering "Moneymaker" 
material and the earlier-flowering "20965" homozygous inbred line, and we 
analyzed the obtained data. At least 43.92 million clean reads were obtained 
from 12 datasets, and the similarity with the tomato internal reference genome 
was 92.86-94.57%. Based on gene expression and background annotations, 49 
candidate genes related to flowering time and flower development were initially 
screened, among which the greatest number belong to the photoperiod pathway. 
According to the expression pattern of candidate genes, the cause of early 
flowering of "20965" is predicted. The modes of action of the differentially 
expressed genes were classified, and the results show that they are closely 
related to hormone regulation and participated in a variety of life activities 
in crops. The candidate genes we screened and the analysis of their expression 
patterns provide a basis for future functional verification, helping to explore 
the molecular mechanism of tomato flowering time more comprehensively.

BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal disorders are a key cause of morbidity in elderly 
people. How musculoskeletal disorders relate to healthy life expectancy remain 
elusive. Hence, we aimed to estimate gains in healthy life expectancy from the 
elimination of musculoskeletal diseases and injuries by using recent national 
health statistics data in Japan.
METHODS: Mortality data were taken from Japanese national life tables and death 
certificates in 2016. Information on medical diagnoses, injuries, and activity 
were obtained from the 2016 Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions. We 
examined five disorders: rheumatoid arthritis, arthrosis, low back pain, 
osteoporosis, and fracture. The prevalence of limitations in activities of daily 
living (ADL) in the population after eliminating the disorder was estimated as 
the proportion of outpatients without the disorder and ADL limitations, 
inpatients without the disorder in hospitals and clinics, and people without the 
disorder who reside in long-term elderly care facilities.
RESULTS: There were small gains in life expectancy from elimination of all 
selected musculoskeletal disorders (0.0-0.1âyears). Elimination of rheumatoid 
arthritis, osteoporosis, and fracture slightly increased the expected years 
without activity limitation (0.1-0.4) and slightly decreased years with activity 
limitation (0.1-0.4âyears). Meanwhile, elimination of arthrosis, low back pain, 
and arthrosis and low back pain moderately increased expected years without 
activity limitation (0.3-1.5âyears) and decreased years with activity limitation 
(0.3-1.5âyears). In addition, elimination of rheumatoid arthritis, arthrosis, 
low back pain, osteoporosis, and fracture decreased expected years with ADL 
limitations (0.0-0.8âyears) and non-ADL limitations (0.0-0.3âyears). A 
combination of arthrosis and low back pain showed a moderate decrease in 
expected years with both ADL limitations (0.7-1.1âyears) and non-ADL limitations 
(0.3-0.4).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide clinical evidence that among the 
musculoskeletal disorders low back pain and arthrosis are the key factors for 
the elongation of healthy life expectancy.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disorder, caused by mutations in the CF 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. These cause a reduced secretion 
of chloride, a marked absorption of sodium and, therefore, of water, through the 
epithelium, resulting in the formation of thickened secretions in organs such as 
lung or pancreas. These viscous secretions lead to airway obstruction, chronic 
infection and inflammation resulting in progressive lung damage, bronchiectasis 
and eventual respiratory failure. Although the average life expectancy has 
increased over the last 30âyears, lung disease is the most common cause of death 
in people with CF. For these reasons, the improvement of sputum clearance is a 
major therapeutic aim in CF and early initiation of airway clearance is widely 
recommended and implemented. Symptomatic mucolytic therapy today is mainly based 
on inhalation of DNase, hypertonic saline or mannitol, in combination with 
physiotherapy. Mucolytic agents break down the gel structure of mucus and 
therefore decrease its elasticity and viscosity, reducing the pulmonary 
exacerbation frequency and to improve and stabilize lung function. Nevertheless, 
high quality studies comparing these mucolytic drugs are still few, and the 
individual experiences of patients and caregivers explain the high variability 
of their use globally. This review will summarize the current knowledge on 
hypertonic saline in the treatment of CF lung disease. Furthermore, we report 
the real-world prescription of inhaled mucolytic agents in CF.
