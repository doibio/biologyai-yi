Endocrine comorbidities have become increasingly important medical 
considerations as improving cystic fibrosis (CF) care increases life expectancy. 
Although the underlying pathophysiology of CF-related diabetes remains elusive, 
the use of novel technologies and therapeutics seeks to improve both CF-related 
outcomes and quality of life. Improvements in the overall health of those with 
CF have tempered concerns about pubertal delay and short stature; however, other 
comorbidities such as hypogonadism and bone disease are increasingly recognized. 
Following the introduction of highly effective modulator therapies there are 
many lessons to be learned about their long-term impact on endocrine 
comorbidities.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer often 
present with inoperable malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) from a large burden of 
abdominal disease. Interventions such as total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and 
chemotherapy may be used in this setting. We aim to describe the relative 
cost-effectiveness of these interventions to inform clinical decision making.
METHODS: Four strategies for management of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian 
cancer with inoperable MBO were compared from a societal perspective using a 
Monte Carlo simulation: (1) hospice, (2) TPN, (3) chemotherapy, and (4) TPN + 
chemotherapy. Survival, hospitalization rates, end-of-life (EOL) setting, and 
MBO-related utilities were obtained from literature review: hospice (survival 38 
days, 6% hospitalization), chemotherapy (42 days, 29%), TPN (55 days, 25%), TPN 
+ chemotherapy (74 days, 47%). Outcomes were the average cost per strategy and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in US dollars per quality-adjusted 
life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: In the base case scenario, TPN + chemotherapy was the most costly 
strategy (mean; 95% CI) ($49,741; $49,329-$50,162) and provided the highest 
QALYs (0.089; 0.089-0.090). The lowest cost strategy was hospice ($14,591; 
$14,527-$14,654). The TPN alone and chemotherapy alone strategies were dominated 
by a combination of hospice and TPN + chemotherapy. The ICER of TPN + 
chemotherapy was $918,538/QALY compared to hospice. With a societal willingness 
to pay threshold of $150,000/QALY, hospice was the strategy of choice in 71.6% 
of cases, chemotherapy alone in 28.4%, and TPN-containing strategies in 0%.
CONCLUSIONS: TPN with or without chemotherapy is not cost-effective in 
management of inoperable malignant bowel obstruction and platinum-resistant 
ovarian cancer.

The prognosis and life expectancy of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients 
have improved significantly with the launch of first tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI), imatinib. Maintaining at least one major molecular response in CML 
patients without the use of TKI is known as treatment-free remission (TFR). The 
safety of the first TFR (TFR1) effort has been reported by numerous studies. 
However, some patients relapse during TFR1. A second TFR (TFR2) can be tried 
again in those patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate individual 
patient characteristics for a TFR2, factors predicting successful TFR2, 
monitoring, consequences of the cessation of TKI, and studies about TFR2. We 
identified 5 studies related TFR2. The results showed that the first failed TKI 
discontinuation attempt is not an indicator of a second TKI discontinuation 
failure. TKIs could safely and successfully be discontinued for a second time in 
chronic phase CML patients despite a TFR1 failure. The most important factors 
for estimating TFR2 success are the speed of molecular relapse and the TKI-free 
duration after the first TKI discontinuation attempt. New trends in the 
management of CML patients are reducing the side effects of treatment, lessening 
the financial burden, and improving the quality of life of patients as CML has 
developed into a manageable chronic disease rather than an aggressive cancer. 
Although there are many studies and guidelines on TFR1, there are few studies on 
TFR2 and predictive factors. More data is still needed regarding TFR2 attempt in 
patients with CML.

BACKGROUND: The average life expectancy of older people is increasing, and most 
seniors desire to age at home and are capable of living independently. 
Occupational therapy (OT) is client-centered and uses patients' meaningful 
activities, or occupations, as treatment methods, thus playing an important role 
in later adulthood. Telemedicine removes the constraints of time and space, and 
the combination of OT and telemedicine can greatly improve medical efficiency 
and clinical effectiveness.
AIMS: The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the scope and 
effectiveness of telehealth OT for older people.
METHODS: This scoping review was conducted following the methodological 
framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. We searched the literature in five 
databases following the PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, 
Study design) guideline, from inception to April 2022. Two trained reviewers 
independently retrieved, screened, and extracted data, and used a descriptive 
synthesizing approach to summarize the results.
RESULTS: The initial search yielded 1249 studies from databases and manual 
searches, of which 20 were eligible and were included in the final review. A 
thematic analysis revealed five main themes related to telehealth OT: 
occupational assessment, occupational intervention, rehabilitation counseling, 
caregiver support, and activity monitoring.
CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth OT has been used widely for older people, focusing 
primarily on occupational assessment and intervention provided conveniently for 
occupational therapists and older clients. In addition, telehealth OT can 
monitor patients' activities and provide rehabilitation counseling and health 
education for the elderly and their caregivers, thus improving the security of 
their home life and the efficacy of OT. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth 
will be an effective alternative to face-to-face modalities.

BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy can be defined as using five or more medications 
simultaneously. "Medication-related problems", an extension of polypharmacy, 
includes inappropriate prescribing, poor adherence, overdosage, underdosage, 
inappropriate drug selection, inadequate monitoring, adverse drug effects, and 
drug interactions. Polypharmacy and the high risk of medication-related problems 
among older people are associated with adverse health consequences due to 
drug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions, and adverse drug effects. 
This study aims to assess the factors associated with polypharmacy and the high 
risk of medication-related problems among community-dwelling older people in the 
Netherlands, Greece, Croatia, Spain, United Kingdom.
METHOD: This longitudinal study used baseline and follow-up data from 1791 
participants of the Urban Health Center European project. Polypharmacy and the 
risk of medication-related problems were evaluated at baseline and follow-up 
using the Medication Risk Questionnaire. We studied factors in the domains (a) 
sociodemographic characteristics, (b) lifestyle and nutrition, and (c) health 
and health care use. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were used to 
examine the factors associated with polypharmacy and the high risk of 
medication-related problems.
RESULTS: Mean age was 79.6 years (SD ± 5.6 years); 60.8% were women; 45.2% had 
polypharmacy, and 41.8% had a high risk of medication-related problems. Women 
participants had lower odds of polypharmacy (OR = 0.55;95%CI:0.42-0.72) and a 
high risk of medication-related problems (OR = 0.50; 95%CI:0.39-0.65). 
Participants with a migration background (OR = 1.67;95%CI:1.08-2.59), overweight 
(OR = 1.37; 95%CI:1.04-1.79) and obesity (OR = 1.78;95%CI:1.26-2.51) compared to 
'normal weight', with lower physical HRQoL (OR = 0.96, 95%CI:0.95-0.98), 
multi-morbidity (OR = 3.73, 95%CI:2.18-6.37), frailty (OR = 1.69, 
95%CI:1.24-2.30), visited outpatient services (OR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.09-2.88) had 
higher odds of polypharmacy. The associations with the high risk of 
medication-related problems were similar.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors in demography, lifestyle, nutrition, and health 
care use are associated with polypharmacy and the high risk of 
medication-related problems. Polypharmacy is a single element that may reflect 
the number of medications taken. The broader content of medication-related 
problems should be considered to assess the context of medication use among 
older people comprehensively. These provide starting points to improve 
interventions to reduce polypharmacy and high risk of medication-related 
problems. In the meantime, health professionals can apply these insights to 
identify subgroups of patients at a high risk of polypharmacy and 
medication-related problems.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The intervention of the UHCE project was registered in the 
ISRCTN registry as ISRCTN52788952. The date of registration is 13/03/2017.

BACKGROUND: The entire population of Mozambique is at risk for malaria, which 
remains one of the leading causes of death. The 2017-2022 National Malaria 
Strategic Plan focuses on reducing malaria morbidity and mortality in high- and 
low-transmission areas. This study aimed to estimate the costs and health 
benefits of six variations of the World Health Organization's "test-and-treat" 
strategy among children under five.
METHODS: A decision tree model was developed that estimates the costs and health 
outcomes for children under five. Data on probabilities, costs, weights for 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
were based on peer-reviewed, grey literature, and primary data analysis of the 
2018 Malaria Indicator Survey. Six scenarios were compared to the status quo and 
calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of cost per 
QALY gained, DALY averted, and life saved. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses were conducted to understand the effect of parameter 
uncertainty on the findings.
RESULTS: In the base case, reaching the target of 100% testing with rapid 
diagnostic tests (RDTs; Scenario 1) is more cost-effective than improving the 
testing rate alone by 10% (Scenario 2). Achieving a 100% (Scenario 3) or a 10% 
increase in treatment rate (Scenario 4) have ICERs that are lower than Scenarios 
1 and 2. Both Scenarios 5 and 6, which represent combinations of Scenarios 1-4, 
have lower ICERs than their constituent strategies on their own, which suggests 
that improvements in treatment are more cost-effective than improvements in 
testing alone. These results held when DALYs averted or lives saved were used as 
health outcomes. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses revealed 
that the cost-effectiveness of Scenarios 1-6 are subject sensitive to parameter 
uncertainty, though Scenarios 4 and 5 are the optimal choice when DALYs averted 
or QALYs gained were used as the measure of health outcomes across all 
cost-effectiveness thresholds.
CONCLUSIONS: Improving testing rates alone among children at risk for malaria 
has the potential to improve health but may not be the most efficient use of 
limited resources. Instead, small or large improvements in treatment, whether 
alone or in conjunction with improvements in testing, are the most 
cost-effective strategies for children under five in Mozambique.

INTRODUCTION: Adjacent segment degeneration is among the most recognized 
long-term complications of lumbar surgery for degenerative spine pathologies 
with a relevant impact in spine surgical and clinical practice. It is reported a 
incidence of clinical adjacent segment disease between 5-30% of patients 
undergoing spinal fusion. We aimed to evaluate the main clinical and surgical 
risk factors for developing adjacent segment disease.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the pertinent 
literature was performed, according to PRISMA and PICO guidelines, focusing on 
clinical and radiological adjacent segment disease. We exclusively included 
studies reporting demographic and clinical data, and surgical details published 
from 30 September 2015 to 30 September 2020. The effect of considered risk 
factors on the presence of adjacent segment disease was explored with a 
random-effects model.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 15 scientific publications, corresponding to 6253 
patients, met the inclusion criteria for the qualitative and quantitative 
analysis. 720 of the patients developed a clinical and/or radiological adjacent 
syndrome disease, and 473 have been surgically managed. Ten articles qualified 
for the comparative geographical analysis. Advanced age and obesity are relevant 
risk factors for developing lumbar adjacent segment degeneration. Our data also 
reported a higher prevalence of adjacent segment degeneration in Western 
populations than in Eastern populations. The interbody fusion has a protective 
role toward lumbar adjacent segment degeneration.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted multifactorial issues regarding adjacent 
segment disease: clinical, anatomical, biomechanical, and radiological features. 
In view of increasing life expectancy and spinal surgery procedures, extensive 
multicenter studies will be needed to define the correct management of the 
adjacent segment disease.

Reproduction involves the investment of resources into offspring. Although 
variation in reproductive effort often affects the number of offspring, 
adjustments of propagule size are also found in numerous species, including the 
Western honey bee, Apis mellifera. However, the proximate causes of these 
adjustments are insufficiently understood, especially in oviparous species with 
complex social organization in which adaptive evolution is shaped by kin 
selection. Here, we show in a series of experiments that queens predictably and 
reversibly increase egg size in small colonies and decrease egg size in large 
colonies, while their ovary size changes in the opposite direction. Additional 
results suggest that these effects cannot be solely explained by egg-laying rate 
and are due to the queens' perception of colony size. Egg-size plasticity is 
associated with quantitative changes of 290 ovarian proteins, most of which 
relate to energy metabolism, protein transport, and cytoskeleton. Based on 
functional and network analyses, we further study the small GTPase Rho1 as a 
candidate regulator of egg size. Spatio-temporal expression analysis via 
RNAscope and qPCR supports an important role of Rho1 in egg-size determination, 
and subsequent RNAi-mediated gene knockdown confirmed that Rho1 has a major 
effect on egg size in honey bees. These results elucidate how the social 
environment of the honey bee colony may be translated into a specific cellular 
process to adjust maternal investment into eggs. It remains to be studied how 
widespread this mechanism is and whether it has consequences for population 
dynamics and epigenetic influences on offspring phenotype in honey bees and 
other species.

Plain Language Summary: Honey bees are social insects that live in large 
colonies containing tens of thousands of individuals. The vast majority of bees 
are sterile females known as worker bees. They perform most of the activities 
essential for the survival of the colony, including foraging for pollen and 
nectar and taking care of eggs and larvae. An individual known as the queen bee 
is the mother of the colony and is normally the only female who reproduces. She 
has two massive ovaries and can produce up to two thousand eggs per day. 
Previous studies indicate that the number and size of the eggs vary according to 
the conditions inside the colony and in the surrounding environment. Larger eggs 
contain more nutrients so the resulting embryos may have a better chance of 
survival. However, producing bigger eggs requires the queen to invest more 
resources, which is costly to the colony as a whole. It remains unclear which 
mechanisms regulate the size of honey bee eggs. To address this question, Han, 
Wei, Amiri et al. carried out a series of experiments on the Western honey bee, 
Apis mellifera. The experiments showed that queen bees in small colonies had 
smaller ovaries and produced bigger eggs than those in large colonies. The 
difference in egg size appeared to be due to the queen bee’s perception of the 
size of the colony, rather than its actual size. An approach called proteomics 
revealed that 290 ovarian proteins were produced at different levels in big-egg 
producing ovaries compared to small-egg producing ovaries. Further experiments 
suggested that a protein known as Rho1 regulates the size of the eggs the queen 
bees produce. These findings provide an explanation for how the social 
environment of the Western honey bee colony may influence the queen bee’s 
reproductive investment at the molecular level. Further studies to confirm and 
expand on this work may help to improve honey bee health and also contribute to 
our general understanding of this life stage in bees and other insects.

This study aimed to explore the effect of carbon fiber couch on radiotherapy 
dose attenuation and gamma pass rate in intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) 
plans. A phantom inserted with an ionization chamber was placed at different 
positions of the couch, and the dose was measured by the chamber. Under the same 
positioning, the phantom dose was calculated using the real and virtual couch 
images, and the difference in the planned dose of radiotherapy was compared. Ten 
clinical IMRT plans were selected as dose verification data, and the gamma pass 
rates were compared between couch addition and non-addition conditions. When the 
radiation field was near 110° and 250°, the measured value attenuation 
coefficient of the ionization chamber at the joint of the couch was up to 34%; 
the attenuation coefficient of the treatment couch from the actual couch image 
calculated using the treatment planning system (TPS) was up to 33%; the 
attenuation coefficient of the virtual couch calculated using the TPS was up to 
4.0%. The gamma pass rate of the dose verification near gantry angles 110° and 
250° was low, and that of the joint could be lower than 85% under the condition 
of 3%/3 mm. The gamma pass rates of the radiation field passing through the 
couch were all affected. The dose was affected by the radiation field passing 
through the couch, with the largest effect when passing through the joint part 
of the treatment couch, followed by that of the main couch plate and extension 
plate. When the irradiation field passed through the joint and near 110° and 
250° of the main couch, the dose difference was large, making it unsuitable for 
treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To analyse the trend in life expectancy (LE), healthy life expectancy 
(HLE) and socio-economic inequalities by neighbourhood in Barcelona from the 
pre-pandemic period (2018-2019) to the pandemic period (2020-2021).
METHOD: LE and HLE at birth were computed using the municipal register of 
inhabitants and quality of life (EuroQol) from the Barcelona Health Survey of 
2016. Inequalities were assessed with the gap between quantiles of neighbourhood 
income.
RESULTS: In 2020, there was a reduction in LE among men (-1.98 years) and women 
(-2.44) and in HLE among men (-1.44). Socio-economic inequalities in LE and HLE 
between neighbourhoods widened since 2019 to 2021 (LE: from 3.92 to 4.86 years 
for men, and from 1.30 to 3.60 for women; HLE: from 6.88 to 7.70 years for men, 
and from 7.85 to 9.31 for women).
CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has substantially reduced LE and HLE, with larger 
effects among low-income neighbourhoods, especially among women.

OBJETIVO: Analizar la evolución de la esperanza de vida (EV), la esperanza de 
vida en buena salud (EVBS) y las desigualdades socioeconómicas por barrios en 
Barcelona desde el periodo prepandémico (2018-2019) hasta el periodo de pandemia 
(2020-2021).
MÉTODO: Se calcularon la EV y la EVBS al nacimiento utilizando el registro 
municipal de habitantes y la calidad de vida (EuroQol) de la Encuesta de Salud 
de Barcelona de 2016. Las desigualdades se valoraron mediante la brecha entre 
los cuantiles de ingreso por barrios.
RESULTADOS: En 2020 hubo una reducción en la EV en los hombres (−1,98 años) y 
las mujeres (−2,44), y en la EVBS en los hombres (−1,44). Las desigualdades 
socioeconómicas en EV y EVBS por barrios se ampliaron de 2019 a 2021 (EV: de 
3,92 hasta 4,86 años en hombres y de 1,30 hasta 3,60 años en mujeres; EVBS: de 
6,88 hasta 7,70 años en hombres y de 7,85 hasta 9,31 años en mujeres).
CONCLUSIONES: La pandemia ha reducido sustancialmente la EV y la EVBS, con 
mayores efectos en los barrios de menor renta, en especial en las mujeres.

All EU countries have introduced Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination for 
adolescent girls and many countries are expanding the strategy to include 
adolescent boys. There is uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness and 
epidemiological impact of a gender-neutral HPV vaccination strategy. Here we 
present the results of an economic model adapted for Spain. Five vaccination 
strategies were compared from the Spanish healthcare system perspective, 
combining two vaccines (4-valent and 9-valent) in a gender-neutral or girls-only 
programme in a dynamic population-based model with a discrete-time Markov 
approach. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. The benefits of immunization 
were measured with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), which are achieved by 
reducing the incidence of diseases attributable to HPV. Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was compared with the willingness-to-pay 
threshold in Spain. The two most effective strategies were compared: 
gender-neutral 9-valent vaccination vs. girls-only 9-valent vaccination, 
resulting in an ICER of € 34,040/QALY, and an important number of prevented 
cases of invasive cancers and anogenital warts. The sensitivity analysis 
revealed that gender-neutral 9-valent vaccination would become cost-effective if 
protection against oropharyngeal and penile cancers was included or if the price 
per dose decreased from €45 to €28. The gender-neutral 9-valent HPV vaccination 
in Spain offers more benefits than any other modeled strategy, although in the 
conservative base case it is not cost-effective. However, certain plausible 
assumptions would turn it into an efficient strategy, which should be borne in 
mind by the decision makers together with equity and justice arguments.

Plain Language Summary: What is the context? Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a 
group of viruses that causes sexually transmitted diseases, including certain 
cancers. European countries offer HPV vaccination to adolescent girls.Many 
countries have also introduced the vaccination in adolescent boys.There are 
doubts about whether it is worth vaccinating adolescents of both genders.What 
this study adds? We estimated costs and benefits of the vaccination in Spain, 
comparing two types of vaccine, only in girls and in both genders. This analysis 
considered indirect protection of vaccinated people to unvaccinated ones.It 
seems that the benefits of HPV vaccination in all adolescents do not compensate 
the costs.However, when we included likely protection against additional cancers 
or we reduced the price per vaccine dose, it would be worth vaccinating all 
adolescents in Spain.We also stated ethical arguments in favor of HPV 
vaccination for both genders.What is the impact? HPV vaccination in adolescent 
boys and girls in Spain will prevent more HPV-related diseases.For certain 
scenarios, HPV vaccination in both genders would be worth in Spain.Ethically, 
vaccinating also boys would be fair, equitable and would not discriminate a part 
of the population.

Exact mechanisms of heat shock-induced lifespan extension, although documented 
across species, are still not well understood. Here, we show that fully 
functional peroxisomes, specifically peroxisomal catalase, are needed for the 
activation of canonical heat shock response and heat-induced hormesis in 
Caenorhabditis elegans Although during heat shock, the HSP-70 chaperone is 
strongly up-regulated in the WT and in the absence of peroxisomal catalase 
(ctl-2(ua90)II), the small heat shock proteins display modestly increased 
expression in the mutant. Nuclear foci formation of HSF-1 is reduced in the 
ctl-2(ua90)II mutant. In addition, heat-induced lifespan extension, observed in 
the WT, is absent in the ctl-2(ua90)II strain. Activation of the antioxidant 
response and pentose phosphate pathway are the most prominent changes observed 
during heat shock in the WT worm but not in the ctl-2(ua90)II mutant. 
Involvement of peroxisomes in the cell-wide cellular response to transient heat 
shock reported here gives new insight into the role of organelle communication 
in the organism's stress response.

BACKGROUND: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are opportunistic, difficult to 
treat pathogens. With increasing prevalence of NTM infections in people with 
cystic fibrosis (pwCF) and the improved life expectancy, the burden is expected 
to grow.
METHODS: We assessed the epidemiology and management of NTM isolation and 
disease in pwCF in the Netherlands using a survey and retrospective, 
case-controlled data from the Dutch CF Registry. We determined the isolation 
prevalence, treatment and outcomes from 2013-2019.
RESULTS: NTM isolation prevalence increased from 1.0% to 3.6% (2013-2019). This 
was a single NTM isolation in 53.7% of the adults and 60.0% of the children. M. 
abscessus and M. avium complex (MAC) were most frequent (47.1 and 30.9%). Of the 
treated pwCF, 48.5% attained culture conversion of M. abscessus; 54.5% for MAC. 
Children with an NTM isolation showed more infections with S. maltophilia and/or 
A. fumigatus (p < 0.001) compared to controls. In the year prior to NTM 
isolation, children in the NTM group had a lower mean FEV1% predicted 
(81.5 ± 16.7 vs. 88.6 ± 15.3, p = 0.024), while adults in the NTM group had more 
IV antibiotic days compared to controls (60 vs. 17, p = 0.047). In the following 
years, FEV1% predicted declined faster in pwCF with NTM than the control group 
(children: -3.8% vs. -1.6%, p = 0.023; adults: -0.7% and 0.4%, ns).
CONCLUSIONS: The isolation prevalence of 3.6%, poor treatment outcomes and 
associated lung function decline emphasize that NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) 
is a significant health issue among pwCF in the Netherlands. Its prevention and 
treatment require increased attention.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Methods for estimating health values in adult 
populations are well developed, but lag behind in children. The EuroQol standard 
protocol to arrive at value sets for the youth version of the EQ-5D-Y-3L 
combines discrete choice experiments with ten composite time trade-off values. 
Whether ten composite time trade-off values are sufficient remains to be seen 
and this is one of the reasons the protocol allows for experimental expansion. 
In this study, 23 health states were administered for the composite time 
trade-off. This methodological research is embedded in a study aimed at 
generating a representative value set for EQ-5D-Y-3L in Indonesia.
METHODS: A representative sample of 1072 Indonesian adults each completed 15 
discrete choice experiment choice pairs via face-to-face interviews. The 
discrete choice experiment responses were analysed using a mixed-logit model. To 
anchor the discrete choice experiment values onto the full health-dead 
quality-adjusted life-year scale, composite time trade-off values were 
separately obtained from 222 adults living in Java for 23 EQ-5D-Y-3L states. The 
derived latent discrete choice experiment values were mapped onto the mean 
observed composite time trade-off values to create a value set for the 
EQ-5D-Y-3L. Linear and non-linear mapping models were explored to estimate the 
most efficient and valid model for the value set.
RESULTS: Coefficients obtained from the choice model were consistent with the 
monotonic structure of the EQ-5D-Y-3L instrument. The composite time trade-off 
data showed non-linearity, as the values for the two worst states being 
evaluated were much lower than predicted by a standard linear model estimated 
over all composite time trade-off data. Thus, the non-linear mapping strategies 
with a power term outperformed the linear mapping in terms of mean absolute 
error. The final model gave a value range from 1.000 for full health (11111) to 
- 0.086 for the worst health state (33333). Values were most affected by 
pain/discomfort and least by self-care.
CONCLUSIONS: This article presents the first EQ-5D-Y-3L value set for Indonesia 
based on the stated preferences of adults asked to consider their views about a 
10-year-old child. Mapping the mixed-logit discrete choice experiment model with 
the inclusion of a power term (without a constant) allowed us to generate a 
consistent value set for Indonesian youth. Our findings support the expansion of 
the composite time trade-off part of the EQ-5D-Y valuation study design and show 
that it would be wise to account for possible non-linearities in updates of the 
design.

Aging, Equality and the Human Healthspan.

John Davis (New Methuselahs: The Ethics of Life Extension, The MIT Press, 
Cambridge, 2018) advances a novel ethical analysis of longevity science that 
employs a three-fold methodology of examining the impact of life extension 
technologies on three distinct groups: the "Haves", the "Have-nots" and the 
"Will-nots". In this essay, I critically examine the egalitarian analysis Davis 
deploys with respect to its ability to help us theorize about the moral 
significance of an applied gerontological intervention. Rather than focusing on 
futuristic scenarios of radical life extension, I offer a rival egalitarian 
analysis that takes seriously (1) the health vulnerabilities of today's aging 
populations, (2) the health inequalities of the "aging status quo" and, (3) the 
prospects for the fair diffusion of an aging intervention over the 
not-so-distant future. Despite my reservations about Davis's focus on 
"life-extension" vs. increasing the human "healthspan", I agree with his central 
conclusion that an aging intervention would be, on balance, a good thing and 
that we should fund such research aggressively. But, I make an even stronger 
case and conjecture that an intervention that slows down the rate of molecular 
and cellular decline from the inborn aging process will likely be one of the 
most important public health advancements of the twenty-first century. This is 
so because aging is the most prevalent risk factor for chronic disease, frailty 
and disability, and it is estimated that there will be over 2 billion persons 
age > 60 by the year 2050.

BACKGROUND: A biopsychosocial rehabilitation is recommended for chronic 
nonspecific low back pain (CNLBP); however, its effectiveness compared to the 
traditional supervised exercise therapy of CNLBP treatment is still unclear.
METHODS: This was a parallel-group randomized controlled clinical trial. The 
sample consisted of 180 participants of both sexes, aged ≥18 years, with CNLBP 
for ≥3 months. Using web randomization and concealed allocation, they were 
assigned to three groups; graded activity receiving cognitive-behavioral 
therapy, group-based combined exercise therapy and education (GA; n = 59), 
supervised group-based combined exercise therapy and education (SET; n = 63), 
and a control group receiving usual care (n = 58). Interventions were 
administered for 4 weeks (8 sessions). The primary outcome was pain intensity. 
Outcome measures were collected baseline, after interventions (4 weeks), and 
during two follow-up periods (3 and 6 months).
RESULTS: After the intervention, GA had a significant large effect on pain 
reduction compared to the control group (MD of 22.64 points; 95% CI = 16.10 to 
29.19; p < 0.0001; Cohen's d = 1.70), as well as SET compared with the control 
group (MD of 21.08 points; 95% CI = 14.64 to 27.52; p < 0.0001; Cohen's 
d = 1.39), without significant difference between two intervention groups. At 3 
and 6 months of follow-up, GA had a statistically significantly better effect in 
reducing pain, disability and fear-avoidance beliefs, and improving spinal 
extensor endurance, range of extension and quality of life compared to SET and 
the control group. A statistically significantly better effect of SET compared 
with the control group was found in reducing pain, disability, fear-avoidance 
beliefs, and improving the physical component of quality of life. Harms were not 
reported.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that graded activity and group-based supervised 
exercise therapy have beneficial effects over the control group in the treatment 
of CNLBP. The graded activity was more beneficial than supervised group-based 
exercise therapy only during the follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Rural Appalachian residents experience among the highest prevalence 
of chronic disease, premature mortality, and decreased life expectancy in the 
nation. Addressing these growing inequities while avoiding duplicating existing 
programming necessitates the development of appropriate adaptations of 
evidence-based lifestyle interventions. Yet few published articles explicate how 
to accomplish such contextual and cultural adaptation.
METHODS: In this paper, we describe the process of adapting the Make Better 
Choices 2 (MBC2) mHealth diet and activity randomized trial and the revised 
protocol for intervention implementation in rural Appalachia. Deploying the 
NIH's Cultural Framework on Health and Aaron's Adaptation framework, the 
iterative adaptation process included convening focus groups (N = 4, 38 
participants), conducting key informant interviews (N = 16), verifying findings 
with our Community Advisory Board (N = 9), and deploying usability surveys 
(N = 8), wireframing (N = 8), and pilot testing (N = 9. This intense process 
resulted in a comprehensive revision of recruitment, retention, assessment, and 
intervention components. For the main trial, 350 participants will be randomized 
to receive either the multicomponent MBC2 diet and activity intervention or an 
active control condition (stress and sleep management). The main outcome is a 
composite score of four behavioral outcomes: two outcomes related to diet 
(increased fruits and vegetables and decreased saturated fat intake) and two 
related to activity (increased moderate vigorous physical activity [MVPA] and 
decreased time spent on sedentary activities). Secondary outcomes include change 
in biomarkers, including blood pressure, lipids, A1C, waist circumference, and 
BMI.
DISCUSSION: Adaptation and implementation of evidence-based interventions is 
necessary to ensure efficacious contextually and culturally appropriate health 
services and programs, particularly for underserved and vulnerable populations. 
This article describes the development process of an adapted, community-embedded 
health intervention and the final protocol created to improve health behavior 
and, ultimately, advance health equity.
