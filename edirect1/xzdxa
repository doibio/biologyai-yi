Overwintering success is an important determinant of arthropod populations that 
must be considered as climate change continues to influence the spatiotemporal 
population dynamics of agricultural pests. Using a long-term monitoring database 
and biologically relevant overwintering zones, we modeled the annual and 
seasonal population dynamics of a common pest, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), based 
on three overwintering suitability zones throughout North America using four 
decades of soil temperatures: the southern range (able to persist through 
winter), transitional zone (uncertain overwintering survivorship), and northern 
limits (unable to survive winter). Our model indicates H. zea population 
dynamics are hierarchically structured with continental-level effects that are 
partitioned into three geographic zones. Seasonal populations were initially 
detected in the southern range, where they experienced multiple large population 
peaks. All three zones experienced a final peak between late July (southern 
range) and mid-August to mid-September (transitional zone and northern limits). 
The southern range expanded by 3% since 1981 and is projected to increase by 
twofold by 2099 but the areas of other zones are expected to decrease in the 
future. These changes suggest larger populations may persist at higher latitudes 
in the future due to reduced low-temperature lethal events during winter. 
Because H. zea is a highly migratory pest, predicting when populations 
accumulate in one region can inform synchronous or lagged population development 
in other regions. We show the value of combining long-term datasets, remotely 
sensed data, and laboratory findings to inform forecasting of insect pests.

The increased life expectancy has boomed the demand of dental implants in the 
elderly. As a consequence, considering the effect of poorer bone quality, due to 
aging or associated diseases such as osteoporosis, on the success of dental 
restoration is becoming increasingly important. Bisphosphonates are one of the 
most used drugs to overcome the effect of osteoporosis as they increase bone 
density. Bisphosphonates modify the physiological bone remodeling process by 
adhering to the bone surface, reducing the activity of osteoclasts. This study 
aims at comparing the effect on bone remodeling of two drug delivery methods of 
Bisphosphonates: local delivery by coating the implant surface and systemic 
delivery. A chemo-mechano-biological bone remodeling model validated in a 
previous paper was used here. The two drug delivery schemes were modeled by 
means of a finite element approach. In the systemic drug delivery case, the 
amount of drug that reaches the bone compartment was calculated using a 
pharmacokinetic model while in the local drug delivery system, the dose was 
calculated using Fickean diffusion. In particular, the effect of Zoledronate is 
studied here. The two drug delivery approaches are compared between them and 
with a control case with no drug. The results show that the use of 
Bisphosphonates increases the mechanical strength of bone, thus improving the 
implant fixation along time. Systemic drug delivery affects the entire skeleton, 
while local drug delivery only affects the area around the dental implant, which 
reduces the side effects of Bisphosphonates, such as increasing the mineral 
content, which may promote bone brittleness and microdamage far from the 
implant. These results support the conclusion that dental implants coated with 
Bisphosphonates can be a good solution for osteoporotic or low bone density 
patients without the long-term side effects of systemic drug delivery.

BACKGROUND: Resilient Healthcare research centres on understanding and improving 
quality and safety in healthcare. The Concepts for Applying Resilience 
Engineering (CARE) model highlights the relationships between demand, capacity, 
work-as-done, work-as-imagined, and outcomes, all of which are central aspects 
of Resilient Healthcare theory. However, detailed descriptions of the nature of 
misalignments and the mechanisms used to adapt to them are still unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to identify and classify types of misalignments 
between demand and capacity and types of adaptations that were made in response 
to misalignments.
METHODS: The study involved 88.5 hours of non-participant ethnographic 
observations in a large, teaching hospital in central London. The wards included 
in the study were: two surgical wards, an older adult ward, a critical care 
unit, and the Acute Assessment Unit (AAU), an extension unit created to expedite 
patient flow out of the Emergency Department. Data were collected via 
observations of routine clinical work and ethnographic interviews with 
healthcare professionals during the observations. Field notes were transcribed 
and thematically analysed using a combined deductive-inductive approach based on 
the CARE model.
RESULTS: A total of 365 instances of demand-capacity misalignment were 
identified across the five wards included in the study. Of these, 212 had at 
least one observed corresponding work adaptation. Misalignments identified 
include equipment, staffing, process, communication, workflow, and space. 
Adaptations identified include process, resource redistribution, and extra-role 
performance. For all misalignment types observed across the five in-patient 
settings, process adaptations were the most frequently used adaptations. The 
exception to this was for staffing misalignments, which were most frequently 
responded to with extra-role performance adaptations. Of the three process 
adaptations, hospital workers most often adapted by changing how the process was 
done.
CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes a new version of the CARE model that 
includes types of misalignments and corresponding adaptations, which can be used 
to better understand work-as-done. This affords insight into the complexity of 
the system and how it might be improved by reducing misalignments via work 
system redesign or by enhancing adaptive capacity.

Neurodegenerative diseases are severely debilitating conditions characterized 
primarily by progressive neuronal loss and impairment of the nervous system. 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are the most common neurodegenerative 
disorders, and their impact is increasing as average life expectancy increases 
worldwide. Although the underlying mechanisms of both progressive diseases have 
been extensively studied, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the 
molecular basis of both diseases. Current therapeutic options do not slow the 
progression of the diseases and only provide symptom relief. Cell models that 
resemble the characteristics of the disease in question are important in drug 
discovery projects because they provide information about the therapeutic 
benefits of drugs under development. Here, we review current in vitro cell 
models used to study the molecular basis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease 
focusing on their potential for discovering of disease-modifying therapeutics to 
combat neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss phenotypic screening as an 
important approach for identifying novel therapeutic molecules. Advances in the 
development of cell-based assays for drug discovery are discussed, ranging from 
simple monoculture cell models to high-throughput three-dimensional cell models. 
Finally, we critically present the limitations of cell models and the caveats 
encountered in drug discovery to find effective treatment for neurodegenerative 
diseases.

Objective  We illustrate a cavernous sinus chondrosarcoma treated with an 
endoscopic endonasal transethmoidal-transsphenoidal approach. Design  Case 
report of a 15-year-old girl with diplopia and esotropia due to complete 
abducens palsy. Preoperative images showed a right cavernous sinus lesion with 
multiple enhanced septa and intralesional calcified spots ( Fig. 1 ). 
Considering tumor location and the lateral dislocation of the carotid artery, an 
endoscopic endonasal approach was performed to relieve symptoms and to optimize 
the target geometry for adjuvant conformal radiotherapy. Setting  The study was 
conducted at University of Insubria, Department of Neurosurgery, Varese, Italy. 
Participants  Skull base team was participated in the study. Main Outcome 
Measures  A transethmoidal-transsphenoidal approach was performed by using a 
four-hand technique. We used a route lateral to medial turbinate to access 
ethmoid and the sphenoid sinus. During the sphenoid phase, we exposed the medial 
wall of the cavernous sinus ( Fig. 2 ) and the lesion was then removed using 
curette. Skull base reconstruction was performed with fibrin glue and nasoseptal 
flap. Results  No complications occurred after surgery, and the patient 
experienced a complete recovery of symptoms. A postoperative magnetic resonance 
imaging showed a small residual tumor inside the cavernous sinus ( Fig. 1 ). 
After percutaneous proton-bean therapy, patient experienced only temporary 
low-grade toxicity with local control within 2 years after treatment completion. 
Conclusion  Endoscopic endonasal extended approach is a safe and well-tolerated 
procedure that is indicated in selected cases (intracavernous tumors, soft 
tumors not infiltrating the vessels and/or the nerves). A tailored approach 
according to tumor extension is crucial for the best access to the compartments 
involved. The link to the video can be found at: https://youtu.be/TsqXjqpuOws .

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss recent developments in our understanding of 
epidemiology, diagnostics, biomarkers, pathology, pathogenesis, outcome 
measures, and therapeutics in inclusion body myositis (IBM).
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent epidemiology data confirms a relatively higher 
prevalence in the population aged above 50 years and the reduced life 
expectancy. Association with cancer and other systemic disorders is better 
defined. The role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound in 
diagnosis as well as in following disease progression has been elucidated. There 
are new blood and imaging biomarkers that show tremendous promise for diagnosis 
and as outcome measures in therapeutic trials. Improved understanding of the 
pathogenesis of the disease will lead to better therapeutic interventions, but 
also highlights the importance to have sensitive and responsive outcome measures 
that accurately quantitate change.
SUMMARY: There are exciting new developments in our understanding of IBM which 
should lead to improved management and therapeutic options.

Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: Prevention Through Control of Medical Risks.

Diabetes, hypertension, tobacco use, and obesity each substantially increases 
the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and must be controlled as part of CVD 
prevention. Among patients with diabetes, the reduction of CVD risk from lower 
A1c goals must be balanced against the risks of hypoglycemia. The American 
Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends an A1c goal for adults of less than 7% if 
hypoglycemia can be avoided. A less stringent goal of less than 8% is 
appropriate in patients with limited life expectancy. A blood pressure (BP) goal 
of less than 140/90 mm Hg is prudent for all adults younger than 60 years. A 
goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg also is advised for initiating or intensifying 
pharmacotherapy in adults 60 years and older with a history of stroke or who are 
at high cardiovascular risk. BP targets should be individualized to balance the 
known benefits of lowering BP to 120/80 mm Hg with the risks of morbidity 
because of hypotension and adverse effects. Varenicline is the most effective 
drug for smoking cessation, and abstinence rates are increased by combining it 
with nicotine replacement therapy. Bariatric surgery is the most effective 
management for long-term weight loss and reduction of obesity-related 
comorbidities. Social drivers of health are the primary cause of CVD outcomes 
differences among races and ethnicities.

BACKGROUND: Raising the statutory retirement age has been a common policy 
response to population ageing, but health problems may restrict labour force 
participation in older ages. We examined the development of healthy and 
unhealthy working life expectancies in Finland from 2000 to 2017 using different 
measures of health problems.
METHODS: Healthy and unhealthy working life expectancies were calculated for the 
age range 50-65 years using the Sullivan method. The health measures were 
limiting long-standing illness, self-rated health, mental health problems and 
self-assessed work ability.
RESULTS: Healthy working life expectancy was highest when health was measured by 
work ability. From 2000 to 2017, working years in full ability between the ages 
50-65 increased from 6.2 (95% confidence interval 5.9-6.4) to 8.2 (8.0-8.5). 
Healthy working life expectancy increased also when measured by the other 
indicators. Unhealthy working years also increased, except when health problems 
were measured by limiting long-standing illness. The share of years in work 
increased both within the healthy and the unhealthy years, the increase being 
larger or equally large for the latter. Within the healthy and unhealthy years 
measured by the other three indicators, the share of working years increased 
irrespective of whether work ability was full or limited, but the increase was 
larger for limited work ability.
CONCLUSIONS: In Finland, healthy working life expectancy has increased 
irrespective of how health is measured but also working with health problems has 
become more prevalent. The estimates for healthy working years are highest when 
a direct measure of work ability is used.

Erratum in
    CNS Drugs. 2022 Oct 3;:

Inebilizumab (Uplizna®) is a recently approved monoclonal antibody for use in 
adults with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) who are 
anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody seropositive. Inebilizumab targets the B cell 
antigen CD19 and effectively depletes circulating B cells, thus suppressing 
inflammatory NMOSD attacks that are potentially disabling or life-threatening. 
It is approved as an intravenous infusion in several countries. In the pivotal 
phase 2/3 N-MOmentum trial, inebilizumab reduced the risk of NMOSD attacks 
compared with placebo, including in AQP4-antibody seropositive patients. 
Inebilizumab also significantly reduced the risk of disability score worsening, 
the number of NMOSD-related hospitalisations and MRI lesion count, but had no 
significant effect on low-contrast binocular vision. The treatment effect on 
relapse risk and disability scores was sustained in inebilizumab-treated 
patients for ≥ 4 years during the open-label extension. Inebilizumab was 
generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being urinary 
tract infection and arthralgia. Thus, inebilizumab is an effective treatment 
option for adults with AQP4-antibody seropositive NMOSD.

Plain Language Summary: Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a 
chronic condition denoted by relapsing autoimmune attacks affecting the central 
nervous system, which may lead to accruing disability or death. It is frequently 
associated with anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) autoantibodies. In recent years, three 
new monoclonal antibody therapies have gained regulatory approval for the 
treatment of NMOSD. Inebilizumab (Uplizna®), a monoclonal antibody that targets 
B cells, is approved for use in AQP4-antibody seropositive adults as an 
intravenous infusion. Inebilizumab was effective at preventing NMOSD relapse 
compared with placebo in a pivotal phase 2/3 trial. It also prevented worsening 
of disability scores, and decreased the number of NMOSD-related hospitalisations 
and MRI lesions, but did not significantly improve low-contrast binocular 
vision. The clinical benefit of inebilizumab was maintained long-term (≥ 4 years 
in the open-label extension). Inebilizumab was generally well tolerated, with 
most adverse events being mild to moderate in severity. The most common adverse 
events were urinary tract infection and joint pain. Inebilizumab provides an 
effective option for preventing NMOSD attacks in adults who are AQP4-antibody 
seropositive.

The ecological variation in biological and adult life-table attributes of two 
populations of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) from the desert (Jodhpur) and 
coastal (Kolkata) regions of India are assessed to understand the reproductive 
and survival strategies. The results showed that females lived longer than males 
in both strains. The desert strain was more r-strategist because of its higher 
intrinsic rate of increase (rm  = 0.23), finite rate of increase (λ = 1.25), 
lower life expectancy of males (7.9 days) and females (14.4 days), mean 
generation time (T = 19.2 days) and doubling time (DT = 3.0 days). However, 
there was no difference in net reproductive rate (R0 ) between the desert and 
coastal strains. The coastal strain showed a longer female life expectancy 
(22.0 days) than the desert strain (14.4 days). However, the fecundity 
(eggs/female/day) was lower in the coastal strain (11.4) than in the desert 
strain (15.1). Conclusively, the desert (Jodhpur) strain is adapted to a better 
r-strategy than the coastal (Kolkata) strain of Ae. aegypti, which might be 
helpful to flourish in harsh environmental conditions. This study may provide 
accurate predictions of Ae. aegypti population dynamics for vector management.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used to noninvasively monitor aquatic 
animals in freshwater and coastal areas. However, the use of eDNA in the open 
ocean (hereafter referred to OceanDNA) is still limited because of the sparse 
distribution of eDNA in the open ocean. Small pelagic fish have a large biomass 
and are widely distributed in the open ocean. We tested the performance of two 
OceanDNA analysis methods-species-specific qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction) and MiFish metabarcoding using universal primers-to determine the 
distribution of small pelagic fish in the open ocean. We focused on six small 
pelagic fish species (Sardinops melanostictus, Engraulis japonicus, Scomber 
japonicus, Scomber australasicus, Trachurus japonicus, and Cololabis saira) and 
selected the Kuroshio Extension area as a testbed, because distribution of the 
selected species is known to be influenced by the strong frontal structure. The 
results from OceanDNA methods were compared to those of net sampling to test for 
consistency. Then, we compared the detection performance in each target fish 
between the using of qPCR and MiFish methods. A positive correlation was evident 
between the qPCR and MiFish detection results. In the ranking of the species 
detection rates and spatial distribution estimations, comparable similarity was 
observed between results derived from the qPCR and MiFish methods. In contrast, 
the detection rate using the qPCR method was always higher than that of the 
MiFish method. Amplification bias on non-target DNA and low sample DNA quantity 
seemed to partially result in a lower detection rate for the MiFish method; the 
reason is still unclear. Considering the ability of MiFish to detect large 
numbers of species and the quantitative nature of qPCR, the combined usage of 
the two methods to monitor quantitative distribution of small pelagic fish 
species with information of fish community structures was recommended.

BACKGROUND: Patients with high-risk prostate cancer (HRPC) have multiple 
accepted treatment options. Because there is no overall survival benefit of one 
option over another, appropriate treatment must consider patient life 
expectancy, quality of life, and cost.
METHODS: The authors compared quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost 
effectiveness among treatment options for HRPC using a Markov model with three 
treatment arms: (1) external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) delivered with 20 
fractions, (2) EBRT with 23 fractions followed by low-dose-rate (LDR) 
brachytherapy boost, or (3) radical prostatectomy alone. An exploratory analysis 
considered a simultaneous integrated boost according to the FLAME trial 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01168479).
RESULTS: Treatment strategies were compared using the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). EBRT with LDR brachytherapy boost was a 
cost-effective strategy (ICER, $20,929 per QALY gained). These results were most 
sensitive to variations in the biochemical failure rate. However, the results 
still demonstrated cost effectiveness for the brachytherapy boost paradigm, 
regardless of any tested parameter ranges. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis 
demonstrated that EBRT with LDR brachytherapy was favored in 52% of 100,000 
Monte Carlo iterations. In an exploratory analysis, EBRT with a simultaneous 
integrated boost was also a cost-effective strategy, resulting in an ICER of 
$62,607 per QALY gained; however, it was not cost effective compared with EBRT 
plus LDR brachytherapy boost.
CONCLUSIONS: EBRT with LDR brachytherapy boost may be a cost-effective treatment 
strategy compared with EBRT alone and radical prostatectomy for HRPC, 
demonstrating high-value care. The current analysis suggests that a reduction in 
biochemical failure alone can result in cost-effective care, despite no change 
in overall survival.

Evidence-based practice (EBP) has become a dominant paradigm in North American 
behavioral health and social service provision. Once a model of expert 
decision-making that asked practitioners to search through the "best available 
evidence" to inform their clinical decisions and select interventions, EBP is 
now better understood as a complex system of legitimation that designates 
particular methods and-by extension-their practitioners as "evidence-based." 
While critics worry that EBP forecloses professional discretion by imposing 
particular epistemic virtues of intervention science, this ethnographic case 
demonstrates that 1) EBP legitimates professional actors, methods, and 
organizations at least as much as it hampers them and 2) a wide range of 
"extra-scientific" actors are involved in producing and legitimating the 
evidence of evidence-based practice, including policy makers, public and private 
insurers, state agencies, charitable foundations, registries and clearinghouses, 
health and human service organizations, and helping professionals themselves. 
Once we recognize the range of actors and institutions involved in basing and 
legitimating evidence, and the rhetorical work of tethering scientific terms to 
resonant political and economic discourses, we learn that there is nothing 
self-evident about evidence-based practice. Drawing on the social scientific 
study of expertise and focusing empirically on how one behavioral intervention 
earns and retains its status as an EBP, this study traces the 
trans-institutional life of evidence and the continual need to legitimate it as 
a base for behavioral health practice.

In Japan, the ageing population is increasing, and the issue of "the declining 
birthrate and increasing ageing population", "population declining", and 
"extending healthy life expectancy" have been taken up in various academic 
fields, but they are still unsolved in the term of effective methods. Currently, 
in each region of Japan unlike big cities such as Tokyo and Osaka, there is the 
shortage of medical doctors, hospitals, living supportive infrastructure of 
roads, communications, public transportation, banks, post offices, and 
supermarkets, etc. All the necessary infrastructure is collapsing, and the 
current situation is becoming apparent in population declining villages of 
Japan. Will our country become more concentrated in big cities in the future? In 
particular, it is the elderly living in the community who are directly affected 
by these factors. In this article, we would like to introduce the history and 
recent activities of "Age-friendly cities and communities (AFCC)" led by the 
World Health Organization (WHO), and also introduce the efforts of "The Ageing 
in Place in Cities" project by Manchester Urban Ageing Research Group, the 
University of Manchester, UK, Akita City Hall, and Advanced Research Center for 
Geriatric and Gerontology (ARGG), Akita University, Japan.

We quantified the relationship between spatial oscillations in surface 
electromyographic (sEMG) activity and trunk-extension torque in individuals with 
and without chronic low back pain (CLBP), during two submaximal isometric lumbar 
extension tasks at 20% and 50% of their maximal voluntary torque. High-density 
sEMG (HDsEMG) signals were recorded from the lumbar erector spinae (ES) with a 
64-electrode grid, and torque signals were recorded with an isokinetic 
dynamometer. Coherence and cross-correlation analyses were applied between the 
filtered interference HDsEMG and torque signals for each submaximal contraction. 
Principal component analysis was used to reduce dimensionality of HDsEMG data 
and improve the HDsEMG-based torque estimation. sEMG-torque coherence was 
quantified in the δ(0-5 Hz) frequency bandwidth. Regional differences in 
sEMG-torque coherence were also evaluated by creating topographical coherence 
maps. sEMG-torque coherence in the δ band and sEMG-torque cross-correlation 
increased with the increase in torque in the controls but not in the CLBP group 
(p = 0.018, p = 0.030 respectively). As torque increased, the CLBP group 
increased sEMG-torque coherence in more cranial ES regions, while the opposite 
was observed for the controls (p = 0.043). Individuals with CLBP show reductions 
in sEMG-torque relationships possibly due to the use of compensatory strategies 
and regional adjustments of ES-sEMG oscillatory activity.

BACKGROUND: Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) is a sequela of advanced 
intraabdominal cancer and has a profound impact on quality of life. Common 
therapy is endoscopic decompressive gastrostomy tube placement. Standard 
gastrostomy tubes are poorly designed to completely evacuate the dependent 
portions of the stomach due to their location on the anterior gastric wall. In 
our institution we have begun placing the ASPIRE Assist gastrostomy tube (ASPIRE 
Bariatrics, Exton, PA) which includes a 15 cm long, 30Fr fenestrated gastric 
tube extension for enhanced gastric decompression. This tube is FDA indicated 
for gastric decompression and marketed for endoscopic weight loss. The purpose 
of this study is to review our experience managing MBO utilizing the ASPIRE 
Assist tube.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of outcomes at a single institution. 
All decompressive endoscopic gastrostomy tubes placed by two surgeons between 
November 2019 and July 2021 were reviewed. Endoscopic placement was performed 
utilizing standard safe tract and Ponsky pull techniques.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients were identified (10F:4 M), mean age 70 (range 35-89). 
Primary cancer diagnoses included gynecologic (8), colorectal (3), bladder (1), 
small bowel (1), peritoneal serous (1). During the 12 months before 
decompressive gastrostomy tube placement, mean number of hospital admissions for 
MBO was 1.6 (range 1-3). Following tube placement, twelve patients had no 
further hospital admissions for MBO over their lifespan of mean 270 days (range 
8-679 days). One patient had 1 admission for MBO in the 12 months before tube 
placement and 3 admissions in the 4 months after placement. A second patient had 
2 admissions in the 12 months before tube placement and 1 admission in their 
54-day lifespan after placement. There were no major complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic placement of the ASPIRE Assist gastrostomy tube is safe 
for palliation of MBO and may improve gastric decompression compared with 
standard endoscopic gastrostomy tubes. Enhanced gastric decompression can better 
manage symptoms, reduce hospital encounters, and improve quality of life. 
Further study is needed, however, our initial data appears promising.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to model the potential long-term disease 
progression and pharmacoeconomic value of sacubitril/valsartan for the treatment 
of essential hypertension from a Chinese healthcare system perspective.
METHODS: A Markov cohort model with five health states was constructed to 
simulate the incidence of acute cardiovascular events and cost per 
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with sacubitril/valsartan compared with 
allisartan isoproxil and valsartan over a lifetime horizon with an annual cycle. 
Multivariable risk regression models derived from China-PAR data accompanied by 
hazard ratios were used to transform the dual mechanism of sacubitril/valsartan 
to lower blood pressure and left ventricular mass index into long-term fatal and 
non-fatal cardiovascular risks. Efficacy data were calculated using a network 
meta-analysis integrated by the results of clinical trials. Healthcare costs 
were determined from a real-world study and published literature, supplemented 
by expert opinion. Utilities were derived from literature. Both costs and health 
outcomes were discounted at 5.0% annually, and prices corresponded to 2021. 
Model validation, deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to test the robustness of results.
RESULTS: For simulated patients with hypertension, sacubitril/valsartan reduced 
the rates of myocardial infarction by 6.67% and 6.39%, stroke by 9.38% and 
8.98%, and heart failure hospitalization by 9.92% and 9.62% relative to 
allisartan isoproxil and valsartan, respectively. It was also associated with 
gains in life expectancy among hypertensive individuals of 0.362-0.382 years. 
Eventually, lifetime costs per patient were CN¥59,272 (US$9187) for 
sacubitril/valsartan, CN¥54,783 (US$8492) for allisartan isoproxil, and 
CN¥56,714 (US$8791) for valsartan; total QALYs were 11.38, 11.24, and 11.25, 
respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CN¥31,805/QALY 
(US$4930/QALY) compared with allisartan isoproxil, and CN¥19,247/QALY 
(US$2983/QALY) compared with valsartan, both of which are below the one time 
per-capita GDP of CN¥80,976/QALY (US$12,551/QALY) in China. Similar results were 
obtained in various extensive sensitivity analysis scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
sacubitril/valsartan in the treatment of hypertension. Sacubitril/valsartan 
compares favorably with allisartan isoproxil and valsartan in the Chinese 
setting, which is mainly due to its higher efficacy resulting in fewer 
cardiovascular events and ultimately less related mortality over time. The 
results could inform deliberations regarding reimbursement and access to this 
treatment in China and may provide reference for facilitating more reasonable 
and efficient allocation of limited resources in such low- and middle-income 
countries.

PURPOSE: Increase in life expectancy of PLHIV has brought new challenges 
especially for young Malay Muslim men who have sex with men (MSM) in Malaysia. 
This country has strong religious and cultural roots that may pose as additional 
stigma and discrimination in the lives of PLHIV. Therefore, coping skills among 
PLHIV is important. Theories on coping strategies has shown that spiritual and 
religion are one aspect of emotional focused coping. The aim of this study is to 
explore the views on spiritual and religious (S/R) coping among Malay Muslim 
MSMs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a qualitative study using in-depth interview. 
Eligible participants were recruited using purposive and snowballing sampling 
techniques via NGOs and online flyers. The narrative inquiry approach was used 
to understand the lived experiences of PLHIV and their coping strategies, 
particularly using S/R coping. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and 
analysed using Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) Miner. The data was analysed 
using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Interviews with seven participants yielded four themes. Ambivalence 
towards religion was experienced by participants at some point following their 
diagnosis. Using S/R as a form of self-reflection was identified. Having 
positive religious support from family or NGOs helped some participants to 
embrace religious coping rather than to avoid it, and relationship with God was 
an important aspect of religious coping.
CONCLUSION: Spirituality and religiosity can be a form of positive coping for 
PLHIV. This study suggests the need for S/R guidance as well as positive support 
from healthcare professionals and religious-based organizations for PLHIV. This 
can have positive effects towards handling of the condition, adherence to 
treatment and health outcomes.

Gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea, a necrotrophic plant pathogen, is one of 
the most damaging diseases of tomato, resulting in both pre- and post-harvest 
losses. (E)-2-Hexenal dose-dependently inhibited the mycelial growth of B. 
cinerea, and caused distortion of mycelia and loss of the cytoplasm content, 
thus altering the morphology of B. cinerea hyphae. To understand molecular 
processes in response to (E)-2-hexenal, transcriptome sequencing was carried out 
using RNA-Seq technology. RNA-Seq results revealed that a total of 3,893 genes 
were differentially expressed in B. cinerea samples treated with (E)-2-hexenal 
fumigation. Among these genes, 1,949 were upregulated and 1,944 were 
downregulated. Moreover, further analysis results showed 2,113 unigenes were 
mapped onto 259 pathways in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). 
Moreover, (E)-2-hexenal stress affected the expression of genes involved in the 
pathways of cell wall, cell membrane, and energy metabolism. KEGG pathway 
analysis showed that the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis and steroid 
biosynthesis were the most enriched in ergosterol biosynthetic process 
transcriptome data. Particularly, (E)-2-hexenal fumigation had influenced 
ergosterol biosynthetic gene expression levels (e.g., ERG1, ERG3, ERG4, ERG7, 
ERG12, ERG13, ERG24, ERG25, ERG26, and ERG27), which were in good agreement with 
the experimental measurement results, and the ergosterol content decreased. 
Collectively, the results of this study increase our current understanding of 
(E)-2-hexenal inhibition mechanisms in B. cinerea and provide relevant 
information on postharvest shelf life extension and preservation of fruits and 
vegetables.

OBJECTIVE: This paper studies the impact of the subjective life expectancy of 
the elderly on their commercial pension insurance participation at micro 
perspective, providing new evidence to explain the motivation of commercial 
pension insurance participation in China.
METHODS: Using 4 waves of data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal 
Study (CHARLS) from 2011 to 2018, a multiple linear regression model is 
constructed to investigate the effect of subjective life expectancy on 
commercial pension insurance participation among the Chinese elderly, and IV 
model estimation shows that the results are robust. Meanwhile, the heterogeneity 
of the effect of elderly life expectancy on commercial pension insurance 
participation behavior among different characteristic groups is also studied.
RESULTS: A one standard deviation improvement in our measure of subjective life 
expectancy predicts a 0.9% point higher participation rate in commercial pension 
insurance. We also find that there is significant heterogeneity in the effects 
of subjective life expectancy on the participation of elderly people in 
commercial pension insurance with respect to gender, education, hukou, and 
wealth.
CONCLUSION: This paper provides a new perspective to explain the factors 
influencing commercial pension insurance participation in China. We suggest that 
improving residents' awareness of life expectancy is beneficial to their 
reasonable retirement planning, in the background of stepping into an aging 
society in China.
