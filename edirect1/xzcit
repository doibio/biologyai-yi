Insulin was discovered in 1921 and soon became widely available in high-income 
countries. However, many people currently in need of this life-saving medicine 
are unable to access it. This is a global phenomenon, impacting not only 
populations of low- and middle-income countries but low-income populations in 
the U.S. In the U.S., the rate of diabetic ketoacidosis remains high in certain 
subpopulations, the cost of insulin being the main precipitating factor. On a 
global level the main cause of mortality for a child with type 1 diabetes is a 
lack of access to insulin, and in sub-Saharan Africa the life expectancy of a 
child with type 1 diabetes can be as low as 1 year. One lens for considering the 
issue of access to health and medicines is to consider society as a three-legged 
stool. In this paradigm, the role of the public sector is to provide 
"protections" to the population it serves; the private sector is made up of 
"responsible businesses" that supply many of the goods and services people need; 
and the plural sector comprises communities and not-for-profits providing the 
"social affiliations" that are needed. For HIV/AIDS, each of these "legs" played 
a role in improving access. Civil society raised awareness of the issue and 
advocated for access to treatment. Governments provided funding and responses 
both nationally and globally. Finally, the private sector played its role, under 
pressure from civil society and governments, in lowering the price of medicines 
and developing programs to expand access. Here, we use this framework to 
describe the shortcomings in access to insulin from a U.S. and global 
perspective.

Carolina.

Since the emergence of HIV in the United States in the 1980s, cancer has been a 
part of the story. The good news is that antiretroviral therapy has improved 
survival for those living with HIV infection, with life expectancy now 
approaching that of uninfected people. Consequently, this patient population is 
living long enough to develop different types of cancer. At the 23rd NCCN Annual 
Conference, Gita Suneja, MD, MSHP, presented the debut of the new NCCN 
Guidelines for Cancer in People Living With HIV, discussing the intersection 
between cancer and HIV infection, the cancers most likely to develop in this 
group of patients, and the importance of oncologists working in conjunction with 
HIV specialists to render the most appropriate and individualized care.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the implications of supplemental vitamin C for pregnant 
tobacco smokers and its effects on the prevalence of pediatric asthma, 
asthma-related mortality, and associated costs.
STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model built via TreeAge compared the outcome 
of asthma in a theoretical annual cohort of 480,000 children born to pregnant 
smokers through 18 years of life. Vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) with a 
standard prenatal vitamin was compared to a prenatal vitamin (60 mg/day). Model 
inputs were derived from the literature. Deterministic and probabilistic 
sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of assumptions.
RESULT: Additional vitamin C during pregnancy would prevent 1637 cases of asthma 
at the age of 18 per birth cohort of pregnant smokers. Vitamin C would reduce 
asthma-related childhood deaths and save $31,420,800 in societal costs over 18 
years per birth cohort.
CONCLUSION: Vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers is a safe and 
inexpensive intervention that may reduce the economic burden of pediatric 
asthma.

Life expectancy is increasing worldwide, with a resultant increase in the 
elderly population. Aging is characterized by the progressive loss of skeletal 
muscle mass and strength - a phenomenon called sarcopenia. Sarcopenia has a 
complex multifactorial pathogenesis, which involves not only age-related changes 
in neuromuscular function, muscle protein turnover, and hormone levels and 
sensitivity, but also a chronic pro-inflammatory state, oxidative stress, and 
behavioral factors - in particular, nutritional status and degree of physical 
activity. According to the operational definition by the European Working Group 
on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP), the diagnosis of sarcopenia requires the 
presence of both low muscle mass and low muscle function, which can be defined 
by low muscle strength or low physical performance. Moreover, biomarkers of 
sarcopenia have been identified for its early detection and for a detailed 
identification of the main pathophysiological mechanisms involved in its 
development. Because sarcopenia is associated with important adverse health 
outcomes, such as frailty, hospitalization, and mortality, several therapeutic 
strategies have been identified that involve exercise training, nutritional 
supplementation, hormonal therapies, and novel strategies and are still under 
investigation. At the present time, only physical exercise has showed a positive 
effect in managing and preventing sarcopenia and its adverse health outcomes. 
Thus, further well-designed and well-conducted studies on sarcopenia are needed.

BACKGROUND: Several methods exist to cost hospital contacts when estimating the 
cost effectiveness of a new intervention. However, the implications of choosing 
a particular approach remain unclear. We compare the use of the three main 
diagnosis-related group (DRG)-based national unit costs in England to determine 
whether choice of approach can impact on economic evaluation results.
METHODS: A cost-utility model was developed to compare secondary fracture 
prevention models of care for hip fracture patients, using data from large 
primary and hospital care administrative datasets in England. A healthcare and 
personal social services payer perspective was adopted, and utilities were 
informed by a meta-regression. Hospital resource use was valued using three 
DRG-based unit costs, and regression-based costing models were developed using 
data from 13,906 patients to inform the model health states.
RESULTS: Finished consultant episode (FCE)-level reference costs resulted in the 
highest costs on admission (£9075) and in the year of the fracture (£14,440). 
Relative to FCE-level costs, spell-level tariffs led to the lowest total 
hospital care costs per patient within 1 year of fracture (- £3691) compared 
with spell-level reference costs (- £2106). At a £20,000/quality-adjusted 
life-year threshold, using spell-level reference costs or spell-level tariffs, 
the introduction of a nurse-led fracture liaison service model of care was the 
cost-effective alternative. However, using FCE-level reference costs, usual care 
was the cost-effective option.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that, conditional on the set of national unit 
costs adopted, the costs of hip fracture may vary considerably and different 
decisions may be reached regarding the introduction of new healthcare 
interventions.

AIM: Kidney transplantation offers improved quality of life and life expectancy 
compared with dialysis for children. This study aims to understand the 
experiences and expectations of children during the kidney transplantation 
process to inform clinical care.
METHODS: Face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 
children and adolescents aged between 7 and 17 years in New Zealand who had 
received a kidney transplantation. Findings were conceptualized using thematic 
analysis with inductive coding.
RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: transplant as the goal (the only 
real treatment and escaping dialysis); dealing with negative emotions (coping 
with anxiety and fear, guilt for siblings and burden of parent as donor); and 
enhancing understanding and knowledge (individualised education and reassurance 
from peer support).
CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents view transplantation as freedom from 
dialysis and return to a more normal life. Children focus on the positive 
aspects of transplantation to reduce anxiety and be reassured in the face of 
uncertainty. Complex emotions arise when thinking about their donor. Children 
recognize transplantation is not a return to full health and actively seek out 
ways to self-manage their care, while remaining anxious about their future.

OBJECTIVE: ?To evaluate the effectiveness of three-dimensional (3D) printing 
navigation templates assisting reconstruction with personalized unrestricted 
total knee prosthesis to treat maliganant bone tumors around the knee.
METHODS: ?Between March 2007 and September 2014, 43 patients with malignant 
tumor around the knee were divided into 2 groups: 3D printing navigation 
templates assisting reconstruction with personalized unrestricted total knee 
prosthesis were used in 21 cases (trial group), and conventional tumor resection 
and reconstruction with hinged total knee prosthesis were used in 22 cases 
(control group). There was no significant difference in age, gender, tumor 
location, pathological diagnosis, tumor stage, diameter of tumor, disease 
duration, and preoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) score between 2 groups 
(P>0.05), which were comparable. Intraoperative length of tumor resection and 
blood loss were recorded and compared, and the postoperative complications and 
tumor recurrence were observed. The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score 
was used to evaluate knee joint function.
RESULTS: ?The operations were completed successfully in the patients of 2 groups 
and postoperative pathological results were negative in tumor resection margin. 
All the patients were followed up 12-77 months (mean, 36.7 months). There was no 
significant difference in the length of tumor resection and blood loss between 
trial group and control group (t=1.01, P=0.32; t=-0.76, P=0.45). In trial group, 
the resection range and reconstruction results were consistent with preoperative 
computer simulation; postoperative complications happened in 2 cases (9.52%); 1 
case of immunological rejection and 1 case of infection); 2 cases (9.52%) had 
recurrence of osteosarcoma and pulmonary metastasis at 1 year after operation. 
In the control group, complication occurred in 6 cases (27.27%; 2 cases of 
periprosthetic fractures, 2 cases of infection, 1 case of incision nonunion, and 
1 case of common peroneal nerve injury); 4 cases (18.18%) had recurrence of 
osteosarcoma and metastasis at 1 year after operation. There was no significant 
difference in postoperative complication and recurrence rate between 2 groups 
(χ2=2.24, P=0.14; χ2=0.67, P=0.41). At last follow-up, distal femur score of 
tumor and proximal tibial score of tumor in trial group were significantly 
better than those in control group (t=4.89, P=0.00; t=3.94, P=0.00). The mean 
flexion and extension range of motion of the knee joint was (115.45±12.25)° in 
trial group and was (101.49±11.96)° in control group, showing significant 
difference (t=3.78, P=0.00).
CONCLUSIONS: ?The effectiveness using 3D printing navigation templates assisting 
reconstruction with personalized unrestricted prosthesis for maliganant bone 
tumors around the knee is better than conventional tumor resection and 
reconstruction with hinged total knee prosthesis. It can improve the joint 
function better and the patients' quality of life.

Health, Boston, MA.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 
retrograde voiding trials in the management of postoperative voiding 
dysfunction.
METHODS: We developed a disease simulation model to assess under which 
conditions routine retrograde voiding trial is the optimal strategy in terms of 
cost per quality-adjusted life-year and cost per case of chronic voiding 
dysfunction avoided. We varied the incidence of voiding dysfunction between 2% 
and 60%. We discounted future costs and utilities at 3% annually. We conducted 
1- and 2-way sensitivity analyses on uncertain model parameters.
RESULTS: The lifetime analysis showed that when the incidence of postoperative 
voiding dysfunction exceeded 12.2%, retrograde voiding trials were 
cost-effective, assuming a willingness-to-pay (WTP) for health of 
$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year. When the incidence exceeded 31.1%, 
retrograde voiding trials became the dominant strategy (less costly and more 
effective). For a simple hysterectomy with voiding dysfunction incidence of 
approximately 10%, lifetime cost is $230,069/case of chronic voiding dysfunction 
avoided; for a midurethral sling with voiding dysfunction incidence of 
approximately 20%, lifetime cost is $60,449/case avoided. Sensitivity analyses 
showed that WTP for health, the incidence of presentation to the emergency 
department (ED) for urinary retention and the incidence of chronic urinary 
retention following treatment in the ED had the greatest impact on the 
cost-effectiveness results.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine retrograde voiding trials following pelvic surgery can be 
cost-effective compared with expectant management when the incidence of voiding 
dysfunction exceeds 12.2%. These results were sensitive to WTP for health, 
incidence of ED visits for urinary retention, and incidence of chronic urinary 
retention following ED visits.

Cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (EarlyCDT-Lung) as an aid to early 
diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with incidentally detected pulmonary 
nodules.

OBJECTIVE: Patients who have incidentally detected pulmonary nodules and an 
estimated intermediate risk (5-60%) of lung cancer frequently are followed via 
computed tomography (CT) surveillance to detect nodule growth, despite 
guidelines for a more aggressive diagnostic strategy. We examined the 
cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (AABT)-Early Cancer Detection 
Test-Lung (EarlyCDT-LungTM)-as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer among 
such patients.
METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate use of the AABT 
versus CT surveillance alone. In the model, patients with a positive 
AABT-because they are at substantially enhanced risk of lung cancer-are assumed 
to go directly to biopsy, resulting in diagnosis of lung cancer in earlier 
stages than under current guidelines (a beneficial stage shift). Patients with a 
negative AABT, and those scheduled for CT surveillance alone, are assumed to 
have periodic CT screenings to detect rapid growth and thus to have their lung 
cancers diagnosed-on average-at more advanced stages.
RESULTS: Among 1,000 patients who have incidentally detected nodules 8-30 mm, 
have an intermediate-risk of lung cancer, and are evaluated by CT surveillance 
alone, 95 (9.5%) are assumed to have lung cancer (local, 73.6%; regional, 22.0%; 
distant, 4.4%). With use of the AABT set at a sensitivity/specificity of 41%/93% 
(stage shift = 10.8%), although expected costs would be higher by $949,442 ($949 
per person), life years would be higher by 53 (0.05 per person), resulting in a 
cost per life-year gained of $18,029 and a cost per quality-adjusted life year 
(QALY) gained of $24,330. With use of the AABT set at a sensitivity/specificity 
of 28%/98% (stage shift = 7.4%), corresponding cost-effectiveness ratios would 
be $18,454 and $24,833.
CONCLUSIONS: Under our base-case assumptions, and reasonable variations thereof, 
using AABT as an aid in the early diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with 
incidentally detected pulmonary nodules who are estimated to be at intermediate 
risk of lung cancer and are scheduled for CT surveillance alone is likely to be 
a cost-effective use of healthcare resources.

BACKGROUND: An aural cholesteatoma, more appropriately named tympanokeratoma, is 
an epidermoid cyst of the middle ear described in several species, including 
dogs, humans and Mongolian gerbils. The cyst lining consists of stratified, 
keratinizing squamous epithelium with central accumulation of a keratin debris. 
This case report describes vestibular ganglioneuritis and perineuritis in a dog 
with chronic otitis, bilateral tympanokeratomas and presumed extension of otic 
infection to the central nervous system.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 11-year-old intact male Dalmatian dog with chronic 
bilateral otitis externa and sudden development of symptoms of vestibular 
disease was examined. Due to the dog's old age the owner opted for euthanasia 
without any further examination or treatment and the dog was submitted for 
necropsy. Transection of the ears revealed grey soft material in the external 
ear canals and pearly white, dry material consistent with keratin in the 
tympanic bullae bilaterally. The brain and meninges were grossly unremarkable. 
Microscopical findings included bilateral otitis externa and media, unilateral 
otitis interna, ganglioneuritis and perineuritis of the spiral ganglion of the 
vestibulocochlear nerve and multifocal to coalescing, purulent meningitis. A 
keratinizing squamous epithelial layer continuous with the external acoustic 
meatus lined the middle ear compartments, consistent with bilateral 
tympanokeratomas. Focal bony erosion of the petrous portion of the temporal bone 
and squamous epithelium and Gram-positive bacterial cocci were evident in the 
left cochlea. The findings suggest that meningitis developed secondary to 
erosion of the temporal bone and ganglioneuritis and/or perineuritis of the 
vestibulocochlear nerve.
CONCLUSIONS: Middle ear tympanokeratoma is an important and potentially 
life-threatening otic condition in the dog. Once a tympanokeratoma has developed 
expansion of the cyst can lead to erosion of bone and extension of otic 
infection to the inner ear, vestibulocochlear ganglion and nerve potentially 
leading to bacterial infection of the central nervous system.

Background Appropriate patient selection and optimal timing of dialysis 
initiation among older adults with advanced CKD are uncertain. We determined the 
association between dialysis versus medical management and survival at different 
ages and levels of kidney function.Methods We assembled a nationally 
representative 20% sample of United States veterans with eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 
m2 between 2005 and 2010 (n=73,349), with follow-up through 2012. We used an 
extended Cox model to determine associations among the time-varying exposures, 
age (<65, 65-74, 75-84, and ≥85 years), eGFR (<6, 6-<9, 9-<12, 12-<15, and 
15-<29 ml/min per 1.73 m2), and provision of dialysis, and survival.Result Over 
the mean±SEM follow-up of 3.4±2.2 years, 15% of patients started dialysis and 
52% died. The eGFR at which dialysis, compared with medical management, 
associated with lower mortality varied by age (P<0.001). For patients aged <65, 
65-74, 75-84, and ≥85 years, dialysis associated with lower mortality for those 
with eGFR not exceeding 6-<9, <6, 9-<12, and 9-<12 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 
respectively. Dialysis initiation at eGFR<6 ml/min per 1.73 m2 associated with a 
higher median life expectancy of 26, 25, and 19 months for patients aged 65, 75, 
and 85 years, respectively. When dialysis was initiated at eGFR 9-<12 ml/min per 
1.73 m2, the estimated difference in median life expectancy was <1 year for 
these patients.Conclusions Provision of dialysis at higher levels of kidney 
function may extend survival for some older patients.

Diverse soil microbial community is determinant for sustainable agriculture. 
Rich microbial diversity has presumably improved soil health for economic crops 
to grow. In this work, the benefits of paddy-upland rotation on soil microbial 
diversity and specific microbes are thus intensively explored. The microbiome 
from multiple factor experiment (three fertilizations coupled with two rotation 
systems) were investigated by novel enrichment and co-occurrence analysis in a 
field well maintained for 25 years. Using next-generation sequencing technique, 
we firstly present explicit evidence that different rotation systems rather than 
fertilizations mightily governed the soil microbiome. Paddy-upland rotation (R1) 
obviously increase more microbial diversity than upland rotation (R2) whether 
organic (OF), chemical (CF) or integrated fertilizers (IF) were concomitantly 
applied. Besides, the specific bacterial composition dominated in OF soil is 
more similar to that of R1 than to CF, suggesting that paddy-upland rotation 
might be the best option for sustainable agriculture if chemical fertilizer is 
still required. Interestingly, the pot bioassay verified clearly the novel 
analysis prediction, illustrating that greater microbial diversity and specific 
microbial composition correlated significantly with disease resistance. This 
finding highlights the eminence of paddy-upland rotation in promoting microbial 
diversity and specific microbial compositions, preserving soil health for 
sustainable agriculture.

This study explores the impact of fossil fuels consumption, solid fuels 
consumption for cooking purposes, economic growth, and carbon emissions on human 
health, with a key emphasis on the occurrence of tuberculosis and the high 
mortality rate in Sub-Saharan Africa. For its practical insights, the study 
develops a system Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) for a panel of 34 middle- 
and lower-middle-income countries from 1995 to 2015. The study adopts a flexible 
methodology to tackle endogeneity in the variables. The robust results report 
that the use of solid fuels (charcoal, peat, wood, wood pellets, crop residues) 
for cooking purposes and the consumption of fossil fuels (oil, coal, gas) are 
significantly increasing the occurrence of tuberculosis. In addition, the 
results highlight that the consumption of both solid fuels and fossil fuels has 
adverse affects on life expectancy by increasing the mortality rate in 
Sub-Saharan African countries. Results report that renewable energy sources like 
sun, wind, and water (all with potential to prevent households from direct 
exposure to particulate matters and harmful gases) as well as a rise in economic 
growth serve as helping factors to control the occurrence of tuberculosis and to 
decrease the mortality rate. Moreover, the use of renewable energy sources is 
serving to lessen emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxides, and 
particulate matters, which can ultimately decrease the mortality rate and extend 
the life expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa.

BACKGROUND: Primary endocrine therapy is used as an alternative to surgery in up 
to 40 per cent of women with early breast cancer aged over 70 years in the UK. 
This study investigated the impact of surgery versus primary endocrine therapy 
on breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) in older women.
METHODS: Cancer registration data for 2002-2010 were obtained from two English 
regions. A retrospective analysis was performed for women with oestrogen 
receptor (ER)-positive disease, using statistical modelling to show the effect 
of treatment (surgery or primary endocrine therapy) and age and health status on 
BCSS. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation.
RESULTS: Cancer registration data on 23 961 women were retrieved. After data 
preprocessing, 18 730 of 23 849 women (78·5 per cent) were identified as having 
ER-positive disease; of these, 10 087 (53·9 per cent) had surgery and 8643 (46·1 
per cent) had primary endocrine therapy. BCSS was worse in the primary endocrine 
therapy group than in the surgical group (5-year BCSS rate 69·4 and 89·9 per 
cent respectively). This was true for all strata considered, although the 
difference was less in the cohort with the greatest degree of co-morbidity. For 
older, frailer patients the hazard of breast cancer death had less relative 
impact on overall survival.
CONCLUSION: BCSS in older women with ER-positive disease is worse if surgery is 
omitted. This treatment choice may contribute to inferior cancer outcomes. 
Selection for surgery on the basis of predicted life expectancy may permit 
choice of women for whom surgery confers little benefit.

[Opioids and new trends in pain therapy].

[Article in Czech]

Lejčko J.

Opioids are well known for their ability to reduce the perception of pain 
without a loss of consciousness. However, the influence of opioids on organism 
is very complex. Clinical pharmacology of currently available opioid analgesics 
is determined by three major factors - their opioid receptor properties, 
pharmacokinetic properties and genetic polymorphism in the opiate receptor and 
cytochrome P450 isoform. In acute severe pain are opioids very efficient. 
Long-term experience with opioid analgesia in patients with cancer pain has 
shown high favorable risk/benefit ratio. However, the treatment with opioids has 
its issues. Life expectancy of chronic pain patients is temporarily unlimited 
and for that reason the time horizon of opioid therapy is unlimited as well. In 
comparison with cancer pain opioid responsiveness to chronic non-cancer pain is 
somewhat different. Clinical experience has shown that exceeding of medium-sized 
doses of opioids in the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain does not lead to 
further improvement of analgesia, but only increases degree of physical 
dependency and tolerance. The most important step is to choose the right 
patient. Subsequently, the success of opioid therapy depends on a careful search 
of balance between pain, opioid dosage and analgesia with emphasis on 
individualization and attention to the prevention and management of side 
effects.

INTRODUCTION: Dementia is a clinical syndrome resulting from a number of 
causations and which is usually accompanied by progressive and diffuse brain 
dysfunction. The different subtypes are characterised by a clinical picture with 
common symptoms that differ in terms of their aetiology, age, clinical 
presentation, clinical course and associated disorders.
AIM: To present an update on the information available about the descriptive 
epidemiology of dementia and its main subtypes.
DEVELOPMENT: The main data on prevalence, incidence and mortality were extracted 
from a literature review. Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent subtype and 
accounts for 60-80% of all the cases, followed by vascular dementia and other 
neurodegenerative dementias, such as dementia due to Lewy bodies, the 
dementia-Parkinson complex and frontotemporal dementia. Other subtypes of 
dementias present frequencies below 1%, and the epidemiological indicators 
available are not very robust.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence and incidence of dementia increase exponentially 
from the age of 65 onwards. As a consequence of the progressive ageing of the 
population and the increase in life expectancy, the number of cases of dementia 
will rise in the coming decades. Recent studies point to a slight drop in the 
accumulated risk of dementia adjusted by age groups and sex over the last few 
decades in some countries. It is possible that by means of primary prevention 
strategies implemented upon the known risk factors for dementia the burden of 
dementia on public health will diminish in the future.

Publisher: TITLE: Epidemiologia de la enfermedad de Alzheimer y otras demencias.
Introduccion. La demencia es un sindrome clinico causado por multiples 
etiologias y que cursa habitualmente con disfuncion cerebral progresiva y 
difusa. Los distintos subtipos se caracterizan por un cuadro clinico con 
sintomas comunes que difieren en su etiologia, edad, forma de presentacion, 
curso clinico y trastornos asociados. Objetivo. Presentar una actualizacion de 
la informacion disponible de la epidemiologia descriptiva de la demencia y de 
sus principales subtipos. Desarrollo. A partir de una revision de la 
bibliografia, se extraen los principales datos de prevalencia, incidencia y 
mortalidad. La enfermedad de Alzheimer es el subtipo mas frecuente y representa 
el 60-80% de todos los casos, seguida de la demencia vascular y de otras 
demencias neurodegenerativas, como la demencia por cuerpos de Lewy, el complejo 
demencia-Parkinson y la demencia frontotemporal. Otros subtipos de demencias 
presentan frecuencias inferiores al 1%, y se dispone de indicadores 
epidemiologicos poco robustos. Conclusiones. La prevalencia e incidencia de 
demencia se incrementa a partir de los 65 años de forma exponencial. Como 
consecuencia del progresivo envejecimiento poblacional y el incremento de la 
esperanza de vida, el numero de casos de demencia aumentara durante las proximas 
decadas. Estudios recientes señalan una ligera disminucion del riesgo acumulado 
de demencia ajustado por grupos de edad y sexo durante las ultimas decadas en 
algunos paises. Es posible que mediante estrategias de prevencion primaria sobre 
los factores de riesgo de demencia conocidos en un futuro disminuya la carga de 
la demencia sobre la salud publica.

BACKGROUND: With respect to the increase in the average life expectancy, 
Alzheimer Disease (AD), the most common form of age-related dementia, has become 
a major threat to the population over the age of 65 during the past several 
decades. The majority of AD treatments are focused on cholinergic and amyloid 
hypotheses.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, three series of 
diphenyl-2-(2-(4-substitutedpiperazin-1-yl)ethyl)pyridazin- 3(2H)-one 
derivatives were designed, synthesized and investigated for their ability to 
inhibit both cholinesterase enzymes and amyloid-β aggregation.
METHOD: The inhibitory activities of the synthesized compounds on AChE (from 
electric eel) and BChE (from equine serum) were determined by the modified 
Ellman's method. The reported thioflavin T-based fluorometric assay was 
performed to investigate the effect of the selected compounds on the aggregation 
of Aβ1-42. The cytotoxic effect of the compounds (4g, 11g and 18g) was monitored 
in 3T3 cell lines to gain insight into therapeutic potential of the compounds by 
using MTT assay. The crystal structures of the AChE (1EVE) and BChE (1P0I) 
enzymes were retrieved from the RCSB Protein Data Bank and Molecular Operating 
Environment (MOE) software was used for molecular docking of the ligands.
RESULTS: Among the tested compounds, 5,6-diphenyl derivative 18g was identified 
as the most potent and selective AChE inhibitor (IC50 = 1.75 µM, Selectivity 
Index for AChE > 22.857). 4,6- Diphenyl derivative 11g showed the highest and 
the most selectivity for BChE (IC50= 4.97 µM, SI for AChE < 0.124). 
Interestingly, 4,5-diphenyl derivative 4g presented dual cholinesterase 
inhibition (AChE IC50= 5.11 µM; BChE IC50= 14.16 µM, SI for AChE = 2.771).
CONCLUSION: Based on biological activity results and low toxicity of the 
compounds, it can be said that diphenyl substituted pyridazinone core is a 
valuable scaffold. Especially, dual inhibitory potencies of 
4,5-diphenylpyridazin-3(2H)-one core for the cholinesterase enzymes and Aβ- 
aggregation makes this core a promising disease-modifying agent.

Gabapentin (GBP), an antiepileptic and anti-neuropathic agent, suffers from 
short half-life (5-7 h), has narrow absorption window, and is absorbed via 
carrier-mediated mechanism resulting in frequent dosing, poor compliance, and 
poor bioavailability (<60%). Moreover, GBP is a freely water-soluble drug, thus 
it is considered a challenging candidate to be formulated as extended release 
dosage form. In this study, raft forming systems were investigated as a 
potential drug delivery system for prolonging gastric residence time of GBP. A 
23 full factorial design was adopted to study the effect of formulation 
variables (% gellan gum, % GMO, and % LM-pectin 101), on the percent of GBP 
released at different time intervals (1, 5, and 8 h) as well as the gel 
strength, and thus was achieved an optimized formula with zero-order release 
profile suitable for once-daily administration. In vivo assessment was performed 
in rats to evaluate gastric residence of the gel formed. In addition, the oral 
bioavailability of GBP relative to commercially available Neurontin® immediate 
release oral solution was also investigated. Significant increase was observed 
for Cmax, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-∞). The increase in relative bioavailability of 
GBP from the optimized formula was 1.7 folds.

Urban agriculture is making an increasing contribution to food security in large 
cities around the world. The potential contribution of biodiversity to 
ecological intensification in urban agricultural systems has not been 
investigated. We present monitoring data collected from rice fields in 34 
community farms in mega-urban Shanghai, China, from 2001 to 2015, and show that 
the presence of a border crop of soybeans and neighboring crops (maize, eggplant 
and Chinese cabbage), both without weed control, increased invertebrate predator 
abundance, decreased the abundance of pests and dependence on insecticides, and 
increased grain yield and economic profits. Two 2 year randomized experiments 
with the low and high diversity practices in the same locations confirmed these 
results. Our study shows that diversifying farming practices can make an 
important contribution to ecological intensification and the sustainable use of 
associated ecosystem services in an urban ecosystem.

IMPORTANCE: Many older patients with a limited life expectancy experience 
fragility fracture of the hip, and this event is associated with increased risk 
of premature mortality, functional decline, and institutionalization. The 
treating team, in collaboration with patients and their families, must determine 
whether a surgical or conservative approach is in the patient's best interest 
when a patient has limited life expectancy.
OBSERVATION: Goals of care discussions appear to be rare in the setting of 
fragility fracture. The urgent nature of the problem makes such discussions 
challenging. We believe that many physicians have not considered goals of care 
discussions to be a standard component of fragility fracture management.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that physicians caring for patients with limited life 
expectancy and fragility fracture of the hip should initiate a goals of care 
discussion to help determine whether operative repair will be the most 
patient-centered approach. Training on conducting goals of care discussions 
should be a standard part of surgical training programs. Goals of care 
discussions should include prognosis, patient values and preferences, pain, 
likelihood for functional recovery, and burdens and benefits of surgical versus 
nonsurgical management. Multidisciplinary input is required, and many patients 
will benefit from geriatric and/or palliative care team involvement.

BACKGROUND: Feasibility of dignity therapy (DT) is well established in 
palliative care. Evidence of its efficacy, however, has been inconsistent and 
may stem from DT's primary effects differing from the outcomes measured in 
previous studies. We proposed that DT effects were in the spiritual domain and 
created a new outcome measure, Dignity Impact Scale (DIS), from items previously
