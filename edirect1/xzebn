The Australian healthcare system continues to work towards close the gap to 
improve and achieve equality in health and life expectancy for Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander peoples. When culturally safe practice is forefront, it 
may be the driving force in improving Indigenous Australian healthcare outcomes. 
For students and practitioners to be equipped with the industry-required 
cultural safety skills, we believe Indigenous Australian knowledge and 
perspectives must be effectively integrated into undergraduate education. A 
scoping review of the literature was conducted to identify the most effective 
teaching and learning methods and assessment tools to best integrate Indigenous 
knowledge and perspectives into undergraduate radiation therapy curriculum at 
Queensland University of Technology (QUT). Embase, CINAHL, Scopus and 
PubMed-Medline were searched to access peer-reviewed studies published between 
2017 and 2022. A total of 591 articles were identified with 39 full-text 
articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Methods of teaching and learning and 
independent assessment tools that promote cultural capability in undergraduate 
education were identified. Findings included intensive patient-specific 
workshops, which were reported to provide students with an immersive learning 
experience, better preparing them for clinical placements and future practice. 
Additionally, other allied healthcare professions have utilised tools such as 
the Cultural Capability Management Tool (CCMT) and Trans-Cultural Self-Efficacy 
Tool (TSET) to quantitatively assess positive shifts and highlight developmental 
needs. These findings will inform current educational endeavours to promote 
cultural safety and the cultural capability continuum in the undergraduate 
radiation therapy curriculum.

The study aims to estimate the trends in incidence and mortality of congenital 
birth defects at global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2019. Annual 
incident cases, age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs), deaths, and 
age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) of congenital birth defects during 
1990-2019 were collected from Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019. We 
calculated percentage of relative changes and estimated annual percentage 
changes (EAPCs) to quantify temporal trends, and explored potential influence 
factors of EAPCs using Pearson correlation. Globally, total incident cases and 
deaths of congenital birth defects were 8.52 million and 0.55 million in 2019. 
Congenital heart anomalies were the major category of congenital birth defects 
worldwide in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the ASIR remained stable (EAPC=0.01, 95% 
CI -0.03 to 0.05), whereas the ASMR decreased (EAPC=-1.79, 95% CI -1.84 
to -1.74). The most pronounced increase in ASIR occurred in low-middle 
socio-demographic index (SDI) regions (EAPC=0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.06). The 
number of deaths increased by 14.49% in low SDI regions and the ASMR increased 
in Southern Sub-Saharan Africa (EAPC=0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.33). Negative 
correlations of EAPCs in ASIRs and ASMRs with SDI and universal health coverage 
index values in 2019 were detected at national levels.  Conclusions: Congenital 
birth defects are an important child health problem. There is urgent need to 
strengthen surveillance and detection of congenital birth defects, build and 
improve maternal and child healthcare capacity, and promote treatment and 
rehabilitation, especially in resource-limited countries. What is known: • 
Congenital birth defects were the fourth leading cause of death among children 
under 5 years in 2019, accounting for nearly 10% of deaths. What is new: • In 
this study using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study, global incident 
cases, deaths, and age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of congenital birth 
defects decreased, whereas age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) remained 
stable from 1990 to 2019. • From 1990 to 2019, the most pronounced increase in 
ASIR occurred in Oceania, and the ASMR increased by an average of 0.17% per year 
in Southern Sub-Saharan Africa.

BACKGROUND: The clinical outcomes and radiographic changes of a one-stage 
procedure combining cervical laminoplasty and unilateral cervical foraminotomy 
for patients with coexisting cervical myelopathy and unilateral radiculopathy 
were evaluated.
METHODS: Seven patients (two females and five males) with coexisting cervical 
myelopathy and unilateral cervical radiculopathy were included in this study. 
The mean age was 58.4 years (range 45-77 years). Cervical laminoplasty and 
unilateral cervical foraminotomy were performed on the recruited patients in a 
single stage. The quantitative clinical changes between the preoperative and 
6-month postoperative assessment were analyzed using the Japanese Orthopedic 
Association (JOA) score, the JOA Cervical Myelopathy Evaluation Questionnaire 
(JOA-CMEQ), visual analog scale (VAS), and Neck Disability Index (NDI). 
Moreover, the preoperative and 6-month postoperative radiographic changes were 
assessed using the C2-7 angle and range of motion (ROM) between flexion and 
extension angle.
RESULTS: There were significant differences in QOL in the JOA-CMEQ between the 
groups. Furthermore, the postoperative VAS values in the arms and hands 
generally improved, although not significantly, between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The aforementioned surgical procedure may be safe and efficient for 
patients with coexisting cervical myelopathy and radiculopathy.

AIM: To assess the burden of liver complications related to non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease (LC-NAFLD) from 2005 to 2019 in China.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used data from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study, 2019, to present contemporary and varying profiles of 
China's LC-NAFLD burden. The Joinpoint Regression model and Gaussian process 
regression were, respectively, used to estimate the annual percentage change in 
prevalence rates and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) rates, and the 
relationship between the sociodemographic index (SDI) and age-standardized rates 
of LC-NAFLD.
RESULTS: In 2019, China had 293.42 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 
263.69-328.44) LC-NAFLD cases with a prevalence rate and DALYs of 20.63 (95% UI: 
23.09-18.54) per 1000 people and 591.03 thousand (95% UI: 451.25-737.33), 
respectively. North China had the highest prevalence but the lowest DALYs of 
LC-NAFLD, whereas Southwest China had the lowest prevalence but the highest 
DALYs. LC-NAFLD were more common in men than in women (male: female ratio, 1.27) 
in 2019. From 2005 to 2019, the prevalence of NAFLD cases increased by 68.32% 
(from 174.32 million in 2005 to 293.42 million in 2019), mainly because of an 
age-specific prevalence rate increase.
CONCLUSION: The LC-NAFLD burden in China is substantial and has increased 
markedly over the past 15 years. Effective measures for low SDI regions and men 
are needed to address the rapidly increasing NAFLD burden.

INTRODUCTION: Healthcare expenditure, a common input used in health systems 
efficiency analyses is affected by population age structure. However, while age 
structure is usually considered to adjust health system outputs, health 
expenditure and other inputs are seldom adjusted. We propose methods for 
adjusting Health Expenditure per Capita (HEpC) for population age structure on 
health system efficiency analyses and assess the goodness-of-fit, correlation, 
reliability and disagreement of different approaches.
METHODS: We performed a worldwide (188 countries) cross-sectional study of 
efficiency in 2015, using a stochastic frontier analysis. As single outputs, 
healthy life expectancy (HALE) at birth and at 65 years-old were considered in 
different models. We developed five models using as inputs: (1) HEpC 
(unadjusted); (2) age-adjusted HEpC; (3) HEpC and the proportion of 0-14, 15-64 
and 65 + years-old; (4) HEpC and 5-year age-groups; and (5) HEpC ageing index. 
Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, Spearman's rank correlation, 
intraclass correlation coefficient and information-based measure of disagreement 
were computed.
RESULTS: Models 1 and 2 showed the highest correlation (0.981 and 0.986 for HALE 
at birth and HALE at 65 years-old, respectively) and reliability (0.986 and 
0.988) and the lowest disagreement (0.011 and 0.014). Model 2, with age-adjusted 
HEpC, presented the lowest information criteria values.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite different models showing good correlation and reliability 
and low disagreement, there was important variability when age structure is 
considered that cannot be disregarded. The age-adjusted HE model provided the 
best goodness-of-fit and was the closest option to the current standard.

OBJECTIVES: Adult immunisation has recently emerged as an area of emphasis in 
research and policy. Increasing life expectancy, outbreaks like COVID-19, and 
the endemic nature of diseases like dengue, malaria have underscored its 
importance. Therefore, this study was carried out to assess hesitancy and the 
factors influencing the uptake of vaccines in adults.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among the medical 
students and doctors affiliated to a medical college and tertiary care hospital 
in Delhi, India and their immediate family members in January 2021. Online data 
collection was done using the Google Form platforms. Data on awareness and 
perceptions regarding adult vaccination and immunisation status of participants 
was collected. The dataset was exported in the Microsoft Excel format and 
analysed with IBM SPSS Version 25 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).
RESULTS: A total of 461 adults responded to the survey. The most common reasons 
for vaccine hesitancy were fear of side effects (51.41%), lack of awareness of 
vaccines (49.46%), and the lack of national guidelines on adult vaccination 
(32.97%). Hesitancy for vaccines among those who were informed by healthcare 
workers of vaccine availability was highest for zoster vaccine (97.80%) and 
least for tetanus toxoid (57.62%). Significant hesitancy was also observed for 
pneumococcal, human papillomavirus, influenza and varicella vaccines.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced vaccine uptake due to vaccine hesitancy in adulthood is a 
major health concern. Framing national guidelines for adult vaccination in India 
and awareness generation to create a public demand for adult vaccination 
warrants prioritization.

BACKGROUND: CDKN2A-p16-Leiden mutation carriers have a high lifetime risk of 
developing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with very poor survival. 
Surveillance may improve prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of surveillance, as compared to no 
surveillance.
METHODS: In 2000, a surveillance program was initiated at Leiden University 
Medical Center with annual MRI and optional endoscopic ultrasound. Data were 
collected on the resection rate of screen-detected tumors and on survival. The 
Kaplan-Meier method and a parametric cure model were used to analyze and compare 
survival. Based on the surveillance and survival data from the screening 
program, a state-transition model was constructed to estimate lifelong outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 347 mutation carriers participated in the surveillance 
program. PDAC was detected in 31 patients (8.9%) and the tumor could be resected 
in 22 patients (71.0%). Long-term cure among patients with resected PDAC was 
estimated at 47.1% (p < 0.001). The surveillance program was estimated to reduce 
mortality from PDAC by 12.1% and increase average life expectancy by 2.10 years. 
Lifelong costs increased by €13,900 per patient, with a cost-utility ratio of 
€14,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. For annual surveillance to have 
an acceptable cost-effectiveness in other settings, lifetime PDAC risk needs to 
be 10% or higher.
CONCLUSION: The tumor could be resected in most patients with a screen-detected 
PDAC. These patients had considerably better survival and as a result annual 
surveillance was found to be cost-effective.

Ischaemic disorders are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 
While the current therapeutic approaches have improved life expectancy and 
quality of life, they are unable to "cure" ischemic diseases and instate 
regeneration of damaged tissues. Exosomes are a class of extracellular vesicles 
with an average size of 100-150 nm, secreted by many cell types and considered a 
potent factor of cells for paracrine effects. Since exosomes contain multiple 
bioactive components such as growth factors, molecular intermediates of 
different intracellular pathways, microRNAs and nucleic acids, they are 
considered as cell-free therapeutics. Besides, exosomes do not rise cell therapy 
concerns such as teratoma formation, alloreactivity and thrombotic events. In 
addition, exosomes are stored and utilized more convenient. Interestingly, 
exosomes could be an ideal complementary therapeutic tool for ischemic 
disorders. In this review, we discussed therapeutic functions of exosomes in 
ischemic disorders including angiogenesis induction through various mechanisms 
with specific attention to vascular endothelial growth factor pathway. 
Furthermore, different delivery routes of exosomes and different modification 
strategies including cell preconditioning, gene modification and bioconjugation, 
were highlighted. Finally, pre-clinical and clinical investigations in which 
exosomes were used were discussed.

The temporal experience in depression: from slowing down and delayed help 
seeking to the emergency setting and length of treatment.

Demyttenaere K(1).

University Hospital Gasthuisberg, University Psychiatric Center KU Leuven, 
Leuven, Belgium.

The present paper discusses the 'time' dimension in depression, from the 
phenomenological experience to the diagnostic criteria, from delayed help 
seeking to the emergency room, from a (non) timely follow-up to (non) adherence 
to treatment. The temporal experience is fundamentally disturbed in depression 
and recent neurophenomenological findings help in better understanding this 
dimension. The duration of symptoms needed to fulfil diagnostic criteria are 
somewhat arbitrary. Depression dramatically decreases life expectancy mainly 
through increased non-suicidal mortality. The time from help seeking to getting 
treatment (between delayed help seeking and the emergency room) is contradictory 
and the length of treatment (from too short to too long) suggests that taking 
better account of these phenomena could improve depression treatment.

Myelofibrosis (MF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by mutations 
(most frequently in JAK2, CALR, or MPL), burdensome symptoms, splenomegaly, 
cytopenia, and shortened life expectancy. In addition to other clinical 
manifestations, patients with MF often develop anemia, which can either be 
directly related to MF pathogenesis or a result of MF treatment with Janus 
kinase (JAK) inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib and fedratinib. Although symptoms 
and clinical manifestations can be similar between the 2 anemia types, only 
MF-related anemia is prognostic of reduced survival. In this review, I detail 
treatment and patient management approaches for both types of anemia 
presentations and provide recommendations for the treatment of MF in the 
presence of anemia.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is frequently complicated by central nervous 
system (CNS) metastases affecting patients' life expectancy and quality. At the 
present clinical trials including neurosurgery, radiotherapy (RT) and systemic 
treatments alone or in combination have provided controversial results. CNS 
involvement is even more frequent in NSCLC patients with EGFR activating 
mutations or ALK rearrangement suggesting a role of target therapy in the 
upfront treatment in place of loco-regionals treatments (i.e. RT and/or 
surgery). So far clinical research has not explored the potential role of 
accurate brain imaging (i.e. MRI instead of the routine total-body contrast CT 
and/or PET/CT staging) to identify patients that could benefit of local 
therapies. Moreover, for patients who require concomitant RT there are no clear

This study aimed to provide up-to-date and comprehensive estimates on the global 
alcohol cardiomyopathy (ACM) from 1990 to 2019. Detailed data on the prevalence, 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), deaths,percentage change in the number 
of cases and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of ACM worldwide from 
1990 to 2019 were obtained or calculated from the Global Burden of Disease Study 
(GBD) 2019. Globally, the estimated prevalent cases of ACM in 2019 were 707,652 
[95% uncertainty interval (UI): 545,182-924,392], with a 35.4% (28.2-44.2) 
increase from 522,616 (95% UI: 394,118-683,206) in 1990, while the 
age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) was slightly decreased with an overall 
EAPC of - 1.30 (- 1.38 - - 1.22). Similar to ASPR, the global age-standardized 
DALYs rate and age-standardized death rate (ASDR) also declined, with an EAPC of 
- 1.12(- 2.09 - - 0.14) and - 1.53(- 2.36 - - 0.70) from 1990 to 2019, 
respectively. Conversely, the number of ACM-related DALYs cases in 2019 was 
2,441,108 (95% UI: 2,046,734-2,782,542), with an increase of 38.8%(2.8-59.9) 
over the past 30 years, and the number of ACM-related deaths in 2019 was 71,723 
(95% UI: 60,167-81,995), with an increase of 33.1% (0.5- 51.9) compared with 
1990. A significant variation in the burden of ACM was observed between 
different regions and countries. Although the ASPR, age-standardized DALYs rate 
and ASDR slightly decreased from 1990 to 2019, the absolute number of 
prevalent cases, DALYs cases and deaths significantly increased. This showed 
that the burden of ACM remains an important global public health concern. Public 
health policy and decision-makers should develop and implement more effective 
strategies specific to geographical location to combat and reduce the burden of 
ACM in the future.

Suprachoroidal triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension for macular edema 
associated with noninfectious uveitis: an in-depth look at efficacy and safety.

Patients with macular edema (ME) associated with uveitis (UME) are at risk for 
vision loss and decreased quality of life, and they often experience high health 
care costs and rates of workforce absenteeism. Systemically or locally delivered 
corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for UME. Although traditional 
corticosteroid treatments may demonstrate high levels of efficacy, systemic 
delivery carries the risk of potentially serious systemic adverse effects (AEs), 
and standard local modes of delivery may be associated with low bioavailability 
in posterior ocular tissues and steroid-associated AEs due to anterior ocular 
tissue exposure. Drug injection into the suprachoroidal space (SCS) allows for 
targeted delivery to chorioretinal tissues with high bioavailability in the 
posterior segment, as well as for inherent drug sequestration away from the 
anterior segment, which may lower the risk of AEs associated with anterior 
tissue exposure to steroids. A novel triamcinolone acetonide (TA) injectable 
suspension formulated for administration to the SCS, SCS-TA (Xipere®; Bausch + 
Lomb), received FDA approval in 2021 for the treatment of UME. It is 
administered via the SCS Microinjector® (Clearside Biomedical, Inc), a device 
specifically designed for SCS delivery of ocular therapeutics. This approval was 
based on results from the phase 3 PEACHTREE clinical trial (NCT02595398) that 
demonstrated the clinical efficacy-including significantly increased visual 
acuity and decreased central subfield thickness-and safety of SCS-TA in patients 
with UME. Results from this trial, as well as from its long-term observational 
extension (MAGNOLIA; NCT02952001) and an open-label safety study (AZALEA; 
NCT03097315), support the possibility that treatment with SCS-TA may address the 
burden of disease in patients with UME.

BACKGROUND: Children with severe cerebral palsy (CP) (GMFCS IV/V) can find it 
difficult to access equipment that allows them to exercise effectively, 
potentially impacting their quality of life. Physiotherapists working within 
special schools are well placed to facilitate increased physical activity as 
part of the school day. This study explored whether the Innowalk Pro, a robotic 
rehabilitation trainer, could influence quality of life (measured by the CPCHILD 
questionnaire), in children with CP, alongside, joint range of movement, 
spasticity and functional goals of the lower limbs, measured by goniometry, 
modified Tardieu scale and goal attainment scoring, GAS, respectively.
METHODS: A prospective single-arm, pre-post trial was undertaken. The Innowalk 
Pro was used four times a week for 30 min alongside usual physiotherapy care in 
a school setting over a 6-week period. Outcomes were evaluated immediately 
pre/post intervention and at 6 weeks and 3 months post intervention. Analysis 
also explored differences between primary and secondary age participants.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven participants aged 5-18 years with a diagnosis of CP GMFCS 
IV/V (10 female, 17 male, mean age 12 years) were included from a convenience 
sample in a special school. Quality of life improved in 36% of participants, the 
majority of these being secondary aged. Knee extension reduced significantly 
3 months post intervention. There were no meaningful changes in spasticity. GAS 
goals improved in 88% of participants after using the Innowalk Pro. GAS goals 
tended to decline after a break from using the equipment, with 21% declining by 
two or more units at 3 months post intervention.
CONCLUSION: A 6-week course of the Innowalk Pro can improve quality of life and 
functional goals for children with CP aged 5-18 years. After a break of 
6-12 weeks, functional goals tend to return to baseline. Further research is 
needed to explore different prescriptions of the Innowalk Pro, to see if 
increasing the time used/increasing the frequency or number of weeks it is used 
for can provide longer lasting benefits.

Cemiplimab, a human monoclonal antibody directed against PD-1, has provided more 
options in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic cutaneous 
squamous-cell carcinoma at an unresectable state. Immune checkpoint inhibitors 
can induce several unfavorable reactions generally referred to as immune-related 
adverse effects. Cytokine-release syndrome is an immune-related adverse event 
that is infrequent and not well known. Diagnosis is difficult because of the 
unspecific symptoms (e.g., fever, hypotension) but it can also be life 
threatening. The authors report the case of a 62-year-old treated by cemiplimab 
for a cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma of the diaper fold with iliac and 
inguinal lymph node extension. He presented with severe cytokine-release 
syndrome, concluding with the discontinuation of cemiplimab.

Plain Language Summary: Immunotherapy has become an increasingly important part 
of cancer treatment. This treatment has many side effects, mainly linked with 
immune system activation. Cytokine-release syndrome is one of the rare 
complications; it causes hyperthermia, hypotension and biological inflammation. 
Diagnosis of this syndrome is critical, as it can be life threatening. Diagnosis 
and early management, including stopping immunotherapy and administering 
corticosteroids and, in some cases, anti-IL- 6, leads to a favorable outcome in 
the majority of cases. The authors report the second case of cytokine-release 
syndrome after cemiplimab infusion used in the first-line treatment of cutaneous 
unresectable squamous-cell carcinoma.

Muscle foods are regarded as nutritionally dense foods while they are prone to 
spoilage by action of microorganism and oxidation. Recently, the consumer's 
preference is mostly toward minimally processed foods as well as preserved with 
natural preservatives. However, natural extract directly to the food matrix has 
several drawbacks. Hence development and applications of nanoemulsion has gained 
importance for the preservation of muscle foods to meet consumer requirements 
with enhanced food safety. Nanoemulsion utilizes natural extracts at much lower 
concentration with higher preservative abilities over original components. 
Nanoemulsions offer protection to the active component from degradation and 
ensure longer bioavailability. Novel techniques used for formulation of 
nanoemulsion provide stability to the emulsion with desirable qualities to 
improve their impacts. The application of nanoemulsion is known to enhance the 
preservative action of nanoemulsions by improving the microbial safety and 
oxidative stability in nanoform. This review provides recent updates on 
different methods used for formulation of nanoemulsions from different sources. 
Besides, successful application of nanoemulsion derived using natural agents for 
muscle food preservation and shelf life extension are reviewed. Thus, the 
application of nanoemulsion to extend shelf life and maintain quality is 
suggested for muscle foods.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 
population-based, expanded reproductive carrier screening (RCS) for a 300 
recessive gene panel from health service and societal perspectives.
METHODS: A microsimulation model (PreConMod) was developed using 2016 Australian 
Census data as the base population. Epidemiologic, health, and indirect cost 
data were based on literature review. The study assessed the incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio of expanded RCS compared with (1) no population screening 
and (2) 3-condition screening for cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and 
fragile X syndrome in a single birth cohort. Averted affected births and health 
service savings with expanded RCS were projected to year 2061. Both one-way and 
probability sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty of the 
parameter inputs.
RESULTS: Expanded RCS was cost saving compared with no population screening and 
cost effective compared with the 3-condition screening (incremental cost 
effectiveness ratio of Australian dollar [AUD] 6287 per quality-adjusted life 
year gained) at an uptake rate of 50% for RCS, 59% for in vitro fertilization 
and preimplantation genetic testing, 90% for prenatal diagnosis testing, and 50% 
for elective termination of affected pregnancies and a cost of AUD595 per couple 
screened. Our model predicts that expanded RCS would avert one-third of affected 
births in a single birth cohort and reduce lifetime health service spending by 
AUD632.0 million. Expanded RCS was estimated to be cost saving from the societal 
perspective.
CONCLUSION: Expanded RCS is cost effective from health service and societal 
perspectives. Expanded RCS is projected to avert significantly more affected 
births and result in health service saving beyond those expected from 
3-condition screening or no population screening.

INTRODUCTION: An increase in life expectancy was observed in the past years. 
Consequently, the knowledge of the maturational changes in the occlusion is 
highly important to guide clinicians during treatment planning.
OBJECTIVE: In this article, the occlusal and facial aging changes occurred 
during almost 50 years of follow-up are described. A normal occlusion sample 
from Bauru Dental School, University of São Paulo, Brazil, was evaluated at 13 
(T1), 17 (T2) and 60 (T3) years of age. The maturational changes observed in 
digital dental models and cephalometric radiographs were presented. A revision 
of the aging process, under the gerontology and psychology perspectives, was 
also explored.
DISCUSSION: Maturational changes in non-treated individuals were very delicate. 
Mandibular crowding, decrease in the overbite, changes in the maxillary second 
molar position, increase in the clinical crown length, dental wear and 
discoloration were observed.
CONCLUSION: Compared to the remarkable facial and skin changes during aging, the 
occlusion seems to be the most stable feature of the face during the aging 
process.
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: An adequate oral care throughout lifetime makes the smile 
the best memory of youth at mature ages.

BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective treatment for chronic 
refractory pain. The evidence of pain reduction, improvement of function, 
quality of life, and cost-effectiveness are strong in developed countries. 
Nevertheless, there is still a lack of economic studies of SCS in the context of 
low- and middle-income countries.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of additional 
SCS to conventional management (CMM) in patients with chronic refractory pain in 
Thailand.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: The pain clinic at Siriraj Hospital, a tertiary care center in 
Thailand.
METHODS: This study recruited patients undergoing SCS implants due to refractory 
pain to CMM from varieties of conditions and followed up to 36 months. The 
clinical outcomes, quality of life, and costs of treatment were collected before 
and after SCS implantation. A decision tree and Markov model were developed to 
estimate the total lifetime costs and health benefits of SCS using a societal 
perspective. The results were presented as an incremental cost-utility ratio 
(ICUR) in 2021 Thai Baht (THB) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and 
an incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) in 2021 THB per numeric rating pain 
score (NRS) reduction.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients who underwent SCS implantation reported pain 
intensity and increased utility at every point in time. Compared to 
pre-implantation, the QALY gained in both rechargeable and non-rechargeable SCS 
was 2.13 QALYs. The economic analysis showed the ICUR in the rechargeable and 
non-rechargeable SCS + CMM group was 660,106.96, and 620,120.59 THB/QALY gained, 
respectively, which was higher than Thais' willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold at 
160,000 THB/QALY gained. Pain score reduction was 2.49/10 at the 3-year point, 
and the ICER was 496,932.08 and 337,341.77 THB/NRS reduction for rechargeable 
and non-rechargeable SCS, respectively.
LIMITATIONS: As this is a single-center prospective cohort study, the results 
might be subject to selection bias and may not truly represent all patients from 
a developing country. The cost-effectiveness results should also be carefully 
interpreted for generalizability.
CONCLUSION: Spinal cord stimulation is effective in pain control and improves 
the quality of life for patients with chronic refractory pain. However, the ICUR 
of SCS is above the WTP, leading to the interpretation that SCS is still not a 
cost-effective treatment in the current context in Thailand.

The bones are a common site for metastasis arising from solid tumors such as 
breast and prostate cancer. Chemotherapy, including immunotherapy, is rarely 
curative. Radiotherapy with pain palliation can temporize bone metastases but is 
generally considered a short-term solution and retreatment is difficult. Surgery 
is often necessary, yet recovery times might exceed life expectancy. Therefore, 
there is a need to develop new approaches to bone metastases that are effective 
but minimally invasive. Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) uses 
antibodies labeled with IRDye700DX (IR700) which is activated by NIR light, 
resulting in rapid cell membrane damage and immunogenic cell death. NIR-PIT 
using an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody-IR700 conjugate 
in patients with recurrent head and neck cancer received qualified approval in 
Japan in 2020 and is now widely used there. However, no bone metastases have yet 
been treated. In this study, the efficacy of NIR-PIT for bone metastases was 
investigated using a bone metastases mouse model successfully established by 
caudal artery injection of a human triple-negative breast cancer cell line, 
MDAMB468-GFP/luc. The bone metastatic lesions were treated with NIR-PIT using 
the anti-EGFR antibody, panitumumab-IR700 conjugate. Bioluminescence imaging and 
histological evaluation showed that EGFR-targeted NIR-PIT has a therapeutic 
effect on bone metastatic lesions in mice. In addition, micro-CT showed that 
repeated NIR-PIT led to repair of metastasis-induced bone destruction and 
restored bone cortex continuity consistent with healing. These data suggest that 
NIR-PIT has the potential for clinical application in the treatment of bone 
metastases.

Although life saving, health inequities exist regarding access and patient 
outcomes in Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), especially among 
marginalized groups. This scoping review's goal is to outline existing 
literature and highlight gaps for future research. Researchers followed guidance 
from the Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. We 
conducted a search to identify articles published between 2016 and 2022 
regarding CABG and inequity groups, defined by the National Institutes of 
Health. Fifty-seven articles were included in our final sample. Race/Ethnicity
