Since the data investigating endovascular therapy performed by surgeons is 
scarce, we retrospectively reviewed our experience of endovascular procedures 
performed by vascular surgeons in the operating room for lower extremity 
ischemia due to stenotic lesions.
METHODS: A total of 14,424 procedures were performed by our division between 
January 1990--October 2003. Of these, 500 involved a balloon angioplasty. These 
made up 3.5% of the total caseload. The median age of the patients who underwent 
these 500 balloon angioplasty was 72+/-0.5 years old; 65% were male; 50% had a 
history of diabetes mellitus, and 6% had ESRD. Indications for the procedures 
included acute ischemia (47 cases), critical ischemia (rest pain, gangrene, or 
ischemic ulcers in 254 cases), failing bypass (64 cases), severe claudication 
(134 cases), and preoperative for a popliteal artery aneurysm repair.
RESULTS: 244 of the procedures were percutaneous, and the remaining 256 were 
combined with some type of open procedure. Those performed as an open technique 
were in combination with a bypass (135 cases) and in combination with a patch 
angioplasty (31cases). Balloon angioplasties were performed of the aorta (5 
cases), iliac arteries (281 cases), the superficial femoral artery (SFA) (101 
cases), the popliteal artery (44 cases), the tibial vessels (77 cases), the 
subclavian/axillary artery (5 cases) and failing grafts (26 cases). Balloon 
angioplasty was attempted in eight cases and failed due to inability to cross 
the lesion with a guidewire. Intraoperative complications included 4 
dissections, inability to dilate the lesion adequately (2 cases), and rupture of 
two iliac lesions that underwent open repair (1 case) or repair with a stent 
graft (1 case). Stents were initially used highly selectively but recently are 
now being deployed more liberally in the iliac arteries (total 251 cases with 
stents).
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these data, we suggest that balloon angioplasty is a 
useful tool that can be performed by vascular surgeons safely. The advantages to 
the patients include one combined procedure to treat lower extremity ischemia.

Life expectancy, especially in the older age groups, is growing enormously due 
to better social and medical care. According to published data on disabled 
people (1997), about 30 % of the total population (7,119,000) in Austria suffer 
from at least one physical disability. In this study, data from a micro census 
as well as a report from the Federal Ministry for Social Security and 
Generations is analyzed to illuminate the situation of impaired people with a 
focus on the capital Vienna. Among other results, it is anticipated that a large 
number of disabled people receive no help at all. About every 7th person 
regularly receives care, every 10th receives daily support. Care intensity 
increases with age showing a clear progression from the age of 60 onwards. 88% 
of the main supporting individuals are related to the handicapped person being 
supported. Women generally exhibit a much higher participation in nursing. The 
socio-political developments are discussed.

Spotlight on omalizumab in allergic asthma.

Bang LM(1), Plosker GL.

Omalizumab (Xolair) is a humanized monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of 
adolescent and adult patients with moderate to severe allergic asthma 
inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). It selectively binds 
to circulating immunoglobulin E (IgE) and, thereby, prevents binding of IgE to 
mast cells and other effector cells. Without surface-bound IgE, these cells are 
unable to recognize allergens, thus preventing cellular activation by antigens 
and the subsequent allergic/asthmatic symptoms. Omalizumab decreases free serum 
IgE levels in a dose-dependent manner, reduces IgE receptor density on effector 
cells, and significantly improves airway inflammation parameters. Omalizumab is 
slowly absorbed after subcutaneous administration, and mean elimination 
half-life is 26 days, thus allowing infrequent administration of the drug. 
Omalizumab dosage is determined by bodyweight and pretreatment serum total IgE 
levels. Patients treated with subcutaneous omalizumab in clinical trials 
received a dosage that was approximately equal to 0.016 mg/kg/IgE (IU/mL) per 4 
weeks. Thus, patients received 150 or 300 mg every 4 weeks, or 225, 300, or 375 
mg every 2 weeks. In adults and adolescents (> or = 12 years of age) with 
moderate to severe allergic asthma, subcutaneous administration of omalizumab as 
add-on therapy with ICS improved the number of asthma exacerbations, rescue 
medication use, asthma symptom scores, and quality-of-life (QOL) scores compared 
with placebo during 28- and 32-week double-blind trials. In addition, 
concomitant ICS use was significantly decreased in patients receiving 
omalizumab, and in the two largest double-blind trials approximately 40% of 
omalizumab recipients completely withdrew from ICS therapy while maintaining 
effective asthma control. In general, results of extension studies showed that 
the beneficial effects of omalizumab were maintained over a total period of 52 
weeks. Omalizumab was well tolerated as add-on therapy with ICS during treatment 
for up to 52 weeks. Common adverse events in clinical trials included injection 
site reaction, viral infection, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, 
headache, and pharyngitis, although the incidence of adverse events with 
omalizumab was similar to that with placebo. In conclusion, omalizumab, as 
add-on therapy with ICS, is an effective and well tolerated agent for the 
treatment of moderate to severe allergic asthma in adolescents and adults. In 
addition to its symptomatic and QOL benefits, omalizumab therapy allows ICS 
dosage reduction or discontinuation of ICS in many patients. Comparisons of 
omalizumab with other asthma therapies have yet to be conducted; however, 
clinical efficacy and tolerability data indicate that omalizumab is a valuable 
option in the treatment of allergic asthma.

OBJECTIVES: To identify factors associated with persistent hip pain in elderly 
hip fracture patients with physical frailty.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: Community-based study conducted at academic medical center.
PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-eight men and women (mean age+/-standard deviation 80+/-7 
years) with a recent hip fracture (mean 14.5+/-4.8 weeks after hip fracture 
repair) and physical frailty, defined as a modified Physical Performance Test 
Score between 12 and 28, enrolled in an exercise intervention trial.
MEASUREMENTS: Dependent variable was self-report of moderate to severe regional 
hip pain in the week preceding the baseline interview. Independent variables 
were self-reported demographic information, health characteristics, and activity 
of daily living (ADL) function; Yesavage Mood Score (YMS); 36-item Short Form 
percentile scores; and objective measurements of lower extremity strength, range 
of motion, balance, and gait.
RESULTS: Forty-two percent of the sample reported moderate or severe hip pain at 
the baseline assessment. Moderate/severe pain was related to difficulty with ADL 
performance and multiple measures of quality of life. Variables independently 
associated with moderate/severe hip pain were frequency of pain medication use 
(adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=5.75, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.23-14.82, 
P=.003), YMS score (AOR=2.69, 95% CI=1.18-6.12, P=.02), and knee extension at 60 
degrees /s in the fractured limb (AOR=0.96, 95% CI=0.92-1.0, P=.05, model 
coefficient of determination=0.34).
CONCLUSION: Persistent hip pain is a frequent symptom in frail elderly 
community-dwelling hip fracture patients. Pain medication use, symptoms of 
depression, and skeletal muscle weakness of the fractured leg are independent 
correlates of moderate to severe hip pain in this patient population. Clinicians 
should assess for, and address, persistent pain in this patient population.

Lower all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in centenarians' 
offspring.

Massachusetts 02118, USA. laterry@bu.edu

OBJECTIVES: To assess the cause of death for centenarians' offspring and 
controls.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Community-based, nationwide sample.
PARTICIPANTS: Family pedigree information was collected on 295 offspring of 
centenarians (from 106 families with a parent already enrolled in the nationwide 
New England Centenarian Study) and on 276 controls (from 82 control families) 
from 1997 to 2000. Controls were individuals whose parents were born in the same 
year as the centenarians but at least one of whom died at the average life 
expectancy.
MEASUREMENTS: Age at death and cause of death.
RESULTS: Centenarians' offspring had a 62% lower risk of all-cause mortality 
(P<.001), a 71% lower risk of cancer-specific mortality (P=.002), and an 85% 
lower risk of coronary heart disease-specific mortality (P<.001). Significant 
differences were not found for other causes of death. However of those who died 
centenarian offsprings dead at a significantly younger age than controls.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that centenarians' offspring have lower 
all-cause mortality rates and cause-specific mortality rates for cancer and 
coronary heart disease. These results suggest that mechanisms for survival to 
exceptional old age may go beyond the avoidance or delay of cardiovascular 
disease and also include the avoidance or delay of cancer. Moreover survival 
advantage of centenarian offsprings may not be due to factors related to 
childhood mortality. Ultimately, survival to exceptional old age may involve 
lower susceptibility to a broad range of age-related diseases, perhaps secondary 
to inhibition of basic mechanisms of aging.

Wharf Road, London W2 1PD, UK. j.warner@imperial.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of research into the mental health of gay men, 
lesbians and bisexual men and women in the UK.
AIMS: To assess rates and possible predictors of mental illness in these groups.
METHOD: A comprehensive assessment was made of the psychological and social 
well-being of a sample of gay men, lesbians and bisexual men and women, 
identified using 'snowball' sampling.
RESULTS: Of the 1285 gay, lesbian and bisexual respondents who took part, 556 
(43%) had mental disorder as defined by the revised Clinical Interview Schedule 
(CIS - R). Out of the whole sample, 361 (31%) had attempted suicide. This was 
associated with markers of discrimination such as recent physical attack 
(OR=1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.3) and school bullying (OR=1.4, 95% CI 1.1-2.0), but not 
with higher scores on the CIS-R.
CONCLUSIONS: Gay, lesbian and bisexual men and women have high levels of mental 
disorder, possibly linked with discrimination.

The total energy and fossil fuels used in producing a desktop computer with 
17-in. CRT monitor are estimated at 6400 megajoules (MJ) and 260 kg, 
respectively. This indicates that computer manufacturing is energy intensive: 
the ratio of fossil fuel use to product weight is 11, an order of magnitude 
larger than the factor of 1-2 for many other manufactured goods. This high 
energy intensity of manufacturing, combined with rapid turnover in computers, 
results in an annual life cycle energy burden that is surprisingly high: about 
2600 MJ per year, 1.3 times that of a refrigerator. In contrast with many home 
appliances, life cycle energy use of a computer is dominated by production (81%) 
as opposed to operation (19%). Extension of usable lifespan (e.g. by reselling 
or upgrading) is thus a promising approach to mitigating energy impacts as well 
as other environmental burdens associated with manufacturing and disposal.

Although limiting energy availability extends lifespan in many organisms, it is 
not understood how lifespan is coupled to energy levels. We find that the 
AMP:ATP ratio, a measure of energy levels, increases with age in Caenorhabditis 
elegans and can be used to predict life expectancy. The C. elegans AMP-activated 
protein kinase alpha subunit AAK-2 is activated by AMP and functions to extend 
lifespan. In addition, either an environmental stressor that increases the 
AMP:ATP ratio or mutations that lower insulin-like signaling extend lifespan in 
an aak-2-dependent manner. Thus, AAK-2 is a sensor that couples lifespan to 
information about energy levels and insulin-like signals.

When do older patients change primary care physicians?

Mold JW(1), Fryer GE, Roberts AM.

Author information:

Sciences Center, Oklahoma City 73104, USA. james-mold@ouhsc.edu

BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised about changes in the health care system 
that may disrupt continuity of care and thereby reduce the quality of that care. 
The purpose of this study was to look at the reasons that older patients give 
for changing primary care physicians (PCPs) and to look at relationships between 
the duration of the PCP-patient relationship and the perceived quality of 
primary care received.
METHODS: We analyzed data collected during the first 2 years of a longitudinal 
study of primary care patients 65 years of age and older. Variables included 
sociodemographic characteristics, duration of relationship with current PCP, 
reasons for leaving last PCP, estimated numbers of visits to PCP, other clinics, 
and emergency departments, and admissions to hospitals and nursing homes in the 
last year, self-rated health, 2 measures of health-related quality of life, and 
the Components of Primary Care Index (CPCI).
RESULTS: 799 patients of 23 PCPs were enrolled in year 1 of the longitudinal 
study, and 579 were re-evaluated in year 2. The mean and median PCP-patient 
relationship durations were 10.27 and 8 years, respectively. Duration of the 
PCP-patient relationship was associated with greater patient age, income, level 
of education, and frequency of visits to the PCP. Longer relationship duration 
was also associated with higher scores on all 8 CPCI subscales. The distribution 
of reasons for changing PCP was associated with duration of relationship; those 
with a longer relationship were more likely to change involuntarily. 
Insurance-related reasons for changing PCP were more common in those who had 
changed more recently. One hundred and fourteen (14%) changed PCP during the 
first year of the study. Three CPCI subscale scores predicted PCP change, 
accumulated knowledge, communication, and family orientation. Eighty-seven 
percent changed involuntarily, 44% for insurance-related reasons and 40% because 
their doctors had moved, retired, or died.
CONCLUSIONS: Older patients, particularly those who are older and have more 
education and income, tend to stay with their PCPs until they are forced to 
change. The longer they stay in the relationship, the better they feel about the 
quality of the primary services they receive. Changes in the health care system 
may have increased the number of patients forced to change PCP.

BACKGROUND: It is well recognized that the season of the year exerts an 
influence on some diseases and causes of death such as coronary heart diseases, 
stroke, infectious diseases and so on.
METHODS: We evaluated the influence of seasonal changes on diseases and causes 
of death in Japan using the Japan Vital Statistics from 1970 to 1999 and 
recorded weather data (mean temperature), by a Fourier decomposition in a log 
linear regression model.
RESULTS: Major influences of seasonal change with the highest rates in winter 
were seen on the following: the overall causes of death; infectious and 
parasitic diseases including tuberculosis; respiratory disease, including 
pneumonia and influenza; heart and cerebrovascular diseases; diabetes; and 
digestive diseases and accidents. Two peaks were seen in suicides, a large peak 
in April and a small peak in autumn. Cancer and homicides were little or not at 
all influenced by seasonality. There was no major difference in changes between 
the years studied, except for respiratory disease and tuberculosis, which showed 
a clear reduction in the seasonality effect from 1970 to 1999.
CONCLUSIONS: To reduce the overall mortality rate and to prolong life expectancy 
in Japan, measures must be taken to reduce those mortality rates associated with 
seasonal differences, especially those causes of death which show a strong 
correlation with seasonal change: respiratory, heart, cerebrovascular, diabetes 
and infectious diseases.

[Effects of prognostic parameters and radiotherapy on survival of patients with 
pulmonary cancer].

[Article in Russian]

Iuozaĭtite E, Inchiura A, Sakalaukas R, Valius L.

AIM: To analyze factors influencing expected survival of pulmonary cancer (PC) 
patients given radiotherapy, i.e. age of the patient, stage of the disease, size 
of the tumor, involvement of the lymph nodes, a total focal dose, space 
distribution of the dose.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Among PC patients 87% were males and 73.9% were 60 years 
of age and older. Local PC (stage IIIa and IIIb) was diagnosed in 65.2%. 
Non-small-cell PC was in 83.8%. Effects of radiotherapy on the survival was 
analysed in 115 patients. Total focal doses made up 30 Gy (3.0 Gy/10 fractions) 
to 70 Gy (2.0 Gy/35 fractions).
RESULTS: Longer survival was achieved after irradiation with greater dose and 
modern three-dimentional planning of conformic radiotherapy. A significant 
prolongation of the survival was seen in raising the total focal dose to 50 Gy. 
There is a correlation between the dose and conformity of the dose distribution. 
During the study 58.2% patients died.
CONCLUSION: Assessment of the survival of PC patients given radiotherapy has 
shown that negative prognostic factors are the following: PC stage IIIA, IIIB 
and IV, extensive local spread of the tumor, large primary tumor, involvement of 
the lymph nodes.

Analysis of cell movements in zebrafish embryos: morphometrics and measuring 
movement of labeled cell populations in vivo.

Sepich DS(1), Solnica-Krezel L.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biological Sciences, Vanderbilt University, Nashcille, TN, USA.

Cell movements occur in all phases of animal life from embryogenesis, to 
maintaining adult organs, to comprising a critical component of pathology. 
During gastrulation, cells demonstrate a repertoire of morphogenetic movements 
coordinated with fate inductions to sculpt the embryonic body. The morphogenetic 
behaviors, underlying mechanisms, and their control, are the subject of much 
current study. External development of the transparent zebrafish embryo, the 
abundance of mutations influencing cell movements, as well as a range of 
observation and manipulation methods, make the zebrafish valuable for cell 
movement studies. This chapter offers a conceptual background for analysis of 
gastrulation cell movements by reviewing how region specific cell movements 
shape the wild-type zebrafish embryo, and how defective morphogenetic movements 
alone or in combination with altered cell fate specification distort the body 
plans of known zebrafish mutants. We furnish methods for the morphometric 
analysis of embryonic shape and organ rudiments in live and fixed embryos, and 
present data collected from live wild-type, dorsoventral patterning (somitabun 
and chordino) and convergence and extension (knypek and trilobite) classes of 
mutants. We provide a method for quantitative assessment of the movements of 
cell populations in vivo, and a method for determining whether cell fate and/or 
movement are disturbed.

Cost-effectiveness of HIV postexposure prophylaxis following sexual or injection 
drug exposure in 96 metropolitan areas in the United States.

Behavioral Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202,

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HIV postexposure prophylaxis 
(PEP) following sexual or injection-related exposures in 96 metropolitan 
statistical areas in the United States (MSA).
DESIGN: Empirical, model-based cost-effectiveness analysis.
METHODS: Epidemiological and population size estimates from the literature were 
combined with information about the distribution of exposure types, PEP 
completion rate, proportion of source partners known to be HIV infected, and PEP 
program costs obtained from a feasibility study of PEP in San Francisco to 
estimate the cost-effectiveness of hypothetical PEP programs in each of the 96 
MSA. The effectiveness of combination antiretroviral therapy following sexual or 
drug use-related exposures, which is presently not known, was assumed equal to 
the effectiveness of zidovudine monotherapy in the occupational setting. The 
main outcome measure was the cost-utility ratio, defined as the cost per 
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved by the PEP intervention.
RESULTS: The cost-utility ratios for the 96 MSA ranged from 4137 dollars to 
39,101 dollars per QALY saved; only two of the ratios exceeded 30,000 dollars 
per QALY saved. Combined across the 96 MSA, the hypothetical PEP programs would 
reach nearly 20,000 clients at a total cost of approximately 22 million dollars. 
The overall cost-utility ratio across MSA was 12,567 dollars per QALY saved. The 
majority of the HIV infections prevented by PEP were among men and women who 
reported receptive anal intercourse exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: PEP following sexual or drug use-related exposures could be a 
cost-effective complement to existing HIV-prevention efforts in most MSA across 
the United States.

GOALS: The aims of this study were to describe the symptoms, their treatment 
during the final months of life of terminally ill cancer patients and to assess 
characteristics of the dying process.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a prospective study design. From a representative 
sample of physicians who participated in a study of end-of-life decision making, 
we asked whether they were treating a patient with cancer whose treatment was no 
longer aimed at cure, whose life expectancy was probably longer than 1 week but 
no longer than 3 months and who would probably continue to be treated by the 
same physician until their death; 85 physicians completed a monthly 
questionnaire until patients' deaths.
RESULTS: Patients were confronted with an increasing amount of symptoms during 
the final months of their life. Fatigue, loss of appetite, dependency and 
feeling unwell were the most prevalent symptoms. Physical symptoms were more 
often treated than psychosocial symptoms. The number of medical disciplines 
involved in the patient's care decreased in the period before death, but the 
number of informal caregivers increased; 73% of patients died peacefully. A 
peaceful death was impeded by feelings of anxiety and loneliness but promoted by 
the involvement of children in their patients' care.
CONCLUSION: The results give insight into the nature of suffering and factors 
related to the dying process of terminally ill cancer patients. Attention to 
psychosocial well-being and to the need to be with loved ones appears to be 
essential for patients' quality of life.

It is thought that the general increase in life expectancy will make 
osteoarthritis the fourth leading cause of disability by the year 2020. Even 
though the pathogenesis of idiopathic osteoarthritis has not been fully 
elucidated, the main features of the disease process are the altered 
interactions between the chondrocytes and their surrounding extracellular 
matrix. In the course of these disturbances, three types of chondrocytes are 
typically present in the pathologically altered extracellular matrix of the 
articular cartilage: healthy chondrocytes which are continually undergoing 
degeneration, degenerated cells which are continually being degraded and finally 
fibroblast-like chondrocytes which seem not to be influenced by this process 
and, therefore, are found in ever-increasing numbers. These fibroblast-like 
chondrocytes take part in tissue regeneration even in advanced stages of 
osteoarthritis, but only in as much as they form fibrocartilaginous or scar 
tissue, since, as we were able to show, they mainly synthesize collagen type I 
and not collagen type II, typical for healthy cartilage. However, we were 
further able to show that fibroblast-like chondrocytes also produce increasing 
amounts of the proteoglycans decorin and biglycan which physiologically are 
involved in the formation of collagen type II, as well as perlecan. These 
multifunctional fibroblast-like chondrocytes could present an ideal therapeutic 
starting point if they could be modified to synthesize the collagen type II 
typical for cartilage and to, thereby, contribute to reversing the damage of the 
joint cartilage that has occurred by the late stages of osteoarthritis.

Medicines are a great contribution to the rising life expectancy in XX century. 
But a lot of drug safety problems were reported since 1960's. More recently, 
ineffectiveness is also being considered as a problem. Since 1975, the term 
'drug-related problem' (DRP) is being used for several definition and purposes. 
This has led to a number of different DRP classifications. The aim of the 
present review is to gather different positions, definitions and classifications 
of DRP. And to present a more modern concept, which is also named as 
pharmacotherapy failure, corresponding to negative clinical outcomes resulting 
from the use or the lack of use of medicines. Those pharmacotherapy failures 
include necessity, effectiveness and safety problems.

Hospital, Florence, Italy.

INTRODUCTION: Adults and children affected by human immunodeficiency virus 
type-1 (HIV-1) infection show bone demineralization. Little is known about 
skeletal status using a quantitative high-frequency ultrasound (QUS) technique 
in these patients.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the bone quality and assess the role of the IGF system in 
the bone metabolism and skeletal status of HIV-1 perinatally infected children.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum free and total IGF-I, IGFBP-3, serum osteocalcin 
level, urinary deoxypyridinoline concentration, spontaneous interleukin-6 (IL-6) 
release and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) were evaluated in 44 
prepubertal children who had perinatal HIV-1 infection. The patients were 
divided into two groups depending on the severity of their clinical condition: 
group 1 (23 children with no or mild clinical symptoms, mean age 8.0 +/- 2.9 
years) and group 2 (21 children with severe clinical symptoms, mean age 8.58 +/- 
2.47 years). Fifty-five healthy age- and sex-matched controls were analysed for 
comparison.
RESULTS: Compared with group 1 and the controls, group 2 patients showed a 
significantly reduced BUA Z-score (P < 0.001), and significantly reduced 
concentrations of serum osteocalcin (P < 0.001) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (P 
< 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Group 2 patients also showed significantly 
reduced serum free IGF-I (P < 0.001) and total IGF-I (P < 0.05) levels compared 
with the controls, but not with group 1. No statistically significant 
differences were found between the three groups with regard to IGFBP-3. Group 2 
patients showed significantly higher spontaneous IL-6 release than group 1 
patients and controls (P < 0.001). BUA Z-scores displayed a significant 
correlation with free IGF-I in group 2 (r = 0.96; P < 0.001), group 1 (r = 0.56; 
P = 0.005) and controls (r = 0.50; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that only patients affected by perinatal HIV-1 
infection with severe clinical manifestations present significant changes in 
bone quality and bone metabolism. Our data also show that impairment of skeletal 
status is related to reduction in serum total and free IGF-I. Children with 
perinatal HIV-1 infection, because of a considerable improvement in life 
expectancy, seem at great risk of not obtaining an optimal bone mass. A possible 
therapeutic approach should be considered in these children.

Myelofibrosis in primary myelodysplastic syndromes: clinical and biological 
significance.

Montenegro.

In a retrospective study of 236 patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes 
(MDS), 130 cases (55.1%) revealed myelofibrosis in bone marrow biopsies. It was 
observed that fibrosis mostly occurs focally or patchy, and collagen deposits 
were found very rarely (only four patients). The histopathology of bone marrow 
biopsies revealed several differences between fibrotic and non-fibrotic MDS: 
cellularity is significantly higher, dysmegakaryopoiesis is more pronounced, 
plasmocytes and mast cells are more often increased, and disturbance of marrow 
topography (particularly of the MK- and G-line) can be found more frequently in 
MDS with myelofibrosis. Reticulin fibrosis occurred in all subtypes of MDS; 
however, there was a higher incidence in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The 
frequency of abnormal growth of GM-progenitors was significantly higher in the 
MDS cases with myelofibrosis, compared to the cases without fibrosis. Clinical 
data showed significantly higher WBC, more frequent presence of immature 
granulocytes, and higher percentage of myeloblasts in peripheral blood and bone 
marrow in MDS with myelofibrosis compared to cases without myelofibrosis. Life 
expectancy was reduced to 13 mo, compared with 35 mo in MDS without fibrosis 
(p=0.00055). Time to leukemic transformation was 32 mo in MDS with fibrosis, 
compared with >56 mo in MDS without fibrosis (p=0.015). Myelofibrosis therefore 
seems to herald a poor prognosis.

BACKGROUND: The average life expectancy of a person aged 75 in Finland is 
approximately 10 years. A substantial threat to the quality of life during these 
years is stroke, which is common among the elderly, may hamper independent 
living and places a substantial burden on health care resources. The aim of the 
present study was to analyse the trends in incidence, mortality and prognosis of 
acute stroke events in persons aged > or = 75 years in Finland.
DESIGN: A population-based stroke register study.
METHODS: The FINSTROKE register recorded all stroke events in persons aged > or 
= 75 years (n=5493) among inhabitants of the town of Turku from 1982 to 1992 and 
again from 1996 to 1998, and in the Kuopio area from 1990 to 1997.
RESULTS: At the end of the study period, the age group > or = 75 years 
constituted 3.8% of the population of study areas among men and 8.7% among 
women. This population segment contributed 35% of strokes among men and 66% 
among women. Of all strokes in this age group, 73% occurred among women. Data 
suggested that the mortality and incidence of acute stroke events were 
declining, but the 28-day case fatality did not change. At day 28 after the 
onset of stroke, only 26% of men and 19% of women had recovered well enough to 
be capable of independent living.
CONCLUSIONS: Stroke mortality among the elderly is declining in Finland, which 
is mainly due to the decline in the incidence of stroke events.

COPD mortality is a world-wide growing problem. COPD is the fifth leading cause 
of mortality among all diseases now and is projected to be the third one in 
2020. In the USA died 119,000 inhabitants in 2001. The Czech republic mortality 
for COPD in the same year was: men 21.3/100,000 inhabitants, women 11.6/100,000; 
this represents total number of 1666 deaths for COPD. Prevalence of COPD is from 
4.5% to 11% in developed countries of Europe and in the USA; prevalence in the 
Czech republic is 7.7%. Total economic cost of COPD reaches in the USA nearly 
the same value as cost of lung cancer. The cost is increasing with severity of 
the disease and with hospitalization, intensive care unit treatment especially. 
The average length of hospitalization for COPD is in the USA 6.9 days, in Italy 
10.6 days, in the Czech republic 15.8 days. Increasing lost of life years by 
premature death and inability to work (Disability-Adjusted Life Year--DALY 
system) in developed countries moves COPD from current 12th positron to the 5th 
one. Quality of life of COPD patients is decreased mainly in domain of physical 
activity in subjects with respiratory insufficiency on home long term oxygen 
therapy.

This report presents period life tables for the United States based on 
age-specific death rates in 2002. Data used to prepare these life tables are 
2002 final mortality statistics; July 1, 2002, population estimates based on the 
2000 decennial census and data from the Medicare program. Presented are complete 
life tables by age, race, and sex. In 2002 the overall expectation of life at 
birth was 77.3 years, representing an increase of 0.1 years from life expectancy 
in 2001. Between 2001 and 2002, life expectancy increased for both males and 
females. Life expectancy increased by 0.2 years for black males (from 68.6 to 
68.8). It increased by 0.1 year for white males (from 75.0 to 75.1), for white 
females (from 80.2 to 80.3), and for black females (from 75.5 to 75.6).

Recent studies have demonstrated a significant association between mutations in 
genes involved in the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway and extension of the life 
span of model organisms. In this study which compared 122 Japanese 
semisupercentenarians (older than 105) with 122 healthy younger controls, we 
examined polymorphic variations of six genes which are involved in insulin/IGF1 
signaling. These genes were FOXO1A, INSR, IRS1, PIK3CB, PIK3CG, and PPARGC1A. We 
investigated the possible association of each gene locus and longevity by 
haplotype-based association analyses using 18 SNPs from public databases and the 
published literature. One INSR haplotype, which was comprised of 2 SNPs in 
linkage disequilibrium, was more frequent in semisupercentenarians than in 
younger controls.

Increased life expectancy leads to increased age-associated health issues in 
both sexes. For menopausal women the most important of these appear to result 
from the severe estrogen deficiency caused by ovarian dysfunction. The 
consequences among others include hot flashes, osteoporosis, obesity, impaired 
memory, higher incidence of Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease. 
Ovarian function and steroidogenesis are influenced by pituitary gonadotropins, 
including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), whose actions are mediated through 
ovarian receptors. This article highlights our recent data pertinent to aging as 
derived from a novel genetically modified animal model [the FORKO mouse 
(FOllitropin Receptor KnockOut) lacking the FSH receptor. FORKO female mice 
experience a chronic depletion of estrogen (E2) from early development, and have 
phenotypes similar to aging women, with ovarian failure, obesity, skeletal 
changes, and ovarian tumors. A variety of findings support the conclusion that 
E2 deficiency in FORKO mice is responsible for their neural impairments 
associated with glial cell hypertrophy, region-specific brain cells loss, and 
abnormal behavior. Findings from mice with FSH receptor haploinsufficiency mice 
('menopausal mice') are also shedding light on the molecular basis of menopausal 
conditions that include degeneration of the hippocampus. Many phenotypes noted 
in the null condition also occur in +/- females but in an age related manner. 
Thus, the FORKO mouse becomes an excellent model to investigate mechanisms 
underlying age-related changes especially when these events are accelerated, as 
in menopausal women. Opportunities abound to assess the potential 
benefits/adverse effects of hormone replacement regimen on various targets.

The worldwide prolongation of the mean life expectancy has resulted in a rapid 
increase of the size of the elderly population (over the age of 60), both in 
numbers and as a proportion of the whole. As a consequence, increasing the 
number of potential beneficiaries of health and pension funds, mainly those aged 
65 and over raises many social and economic problems since they are supported by 
a relatively smaller number of potential contributors, i.e. those in the 
economically active ages between 18 and 64. Therefore, there is a search for any 
therapeutic agent improving quality of life in the elderly. A role for melatonin 
as such a compound was recently suggested. In this survey, data on the possible 
role of melatonin in human aging and age-related diseases are briefly presented. 
Undoubtedly the aging process is multi-factorial, and no single factor has been 
identified which satisfactorily explains the phenomenon. Although many theories 
relating the pineal gland and its secretory product melatonin to aging have been 
proposed, the role of this agent in the aging process is still unclear. However, 
for several reasons it seems reasonable to postulate a role for melatonin in 
this process. Melatonin levels decline gradually over the life-span and may be 
related to lowered sleep efficacy, very often associated with advancing age, as 
well as to deterioration of many circadian rhythms. Melatonin exhibits 
immunomodulatory properties, and a remodeling of immune system function is an 
integral part of aging. Finally, because melatonin is a potent free radical 
scavenger, its deficiency may result in reduced antioxidant protection in the 
elderly which may have significance not only for aging per se but also may 
contribute to the incidence or severity of some age-related diseases. Presently 
available data do not allow us to conclude that melatonin may have a role in 
extending normal longevity. However, although melatonin cannot be recognized as 
'rejuvenating' agent, some of its actions may be beneficial for the aging 
process. Administration of melatonin may improve temporal organization in 
advanced age. Moreover, it has beneficial effects on sleep as well as 
age-related diseases. Although recommendations of melatonin supplementation in 
elderly should be considered, there is a need for extensive studies on the use 
of melatonin in order to improve the quality of life in advanced age.

tachyarrhythmia by an implanted defibrillator.

BACKGROUND: The implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) improves survival in 
high-risk cardiac patients. This analysis from the MADIT-II trial database 
examines the long-term clinical course and subsequent mortality risk of patients 
after termination of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias by an ICD.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Life-table survival analysis was performed, and 
proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate the contribution 
of baseline clinical factors and time-dependent defibrillator therapy to 
mortality during long-term follow-up. Of 720 patients with an ICD (average 
follow-up 21 months), 169 patients received 701 antiarrhythmic device therapies 
for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Few baseline characteristics distinguished 
patients who received appropriate ICD therapy for their first ventricular 
tachyarrhythmic episode. The probability of survival for at least 1 year after 
first therapy for ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) 
was 80%. The hazard ratios for the risk of death due to any cause in those who 
survived appropriate therapy for termination of VT and VF were 3.4 (P<0.001) and 
3.3 (P=0.01), respectively, compared with those who survived without receiving 
ICD therapy, with a high frequency of heart failure and late nonsudden cardiac 
death after first successful ICD therapy for VF.
CONCLUSIONS: Successful appropriate therapy by an ICD for VT or VF is associated 
with 80% survival at 1 year after arrhythmia termination. These patients are at 
increased risk for heart failure and nonsudden cardiac death after device 
termination of VT or VF and should receive special attention for the prevention 
and management of progressive left ventricular dysfunction during long-term 
follow-up.

ENT and speech disorders in children with Down's syndrome: an overview of 
pathophysiology, clinical features, treatments, and current management.

Down's syndrome is the most commonly occurring genetic abnormality, involving 
about 1 in 600 births. The increasing life expectancy of individuals with Down's 
syndrome has revealed the presence of several unexpected pathological processes. 
Among these, ENT disorders hold an important place because of their high 
incidence and severity. Accurate knowledge of the pathophysiology underlying ENT 
disorders (facial dysmorphism, ear abnormalities, upper airway abnormalities, 
and immunodeficiency) allow an understanding of the reasons for the development 
of the upper airway obstruction, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, subglottic 
stenosis, deafness, speech delay, and ENT infections that occur frequently in 
these children. Early screening and specific treatment may allow some of the 
long-term sequelae to be avoided, or at least their prognosis to be improved. In 
order to help health care professionals in their daily practice, this review 
makes a series of recommendations to allow them to develop a master plan for the 
ENT management of children with Down's syndrome. In children with Down's 
syndrome, ENT disorders occur frequently and are often severe. They develop 
owing to craniofacial, functional, and immune system abnormalities. Early 
screening and treatment allow improvements in long-term outcomes.
