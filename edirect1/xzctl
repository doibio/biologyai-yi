QALYs (2.43 LYs) for medical therapy group, respectively. The incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of MitraClip procedure versus medical therapy 
was 1.97 million JPY/QALY (US$18,570/QALY, US$1 = 106 JPY), which was evaluated 
to be cost-effective. The probability of ICER of MitraClip procedure versus 
medical therapy being 5 million JPY/QALY was 96.7%.Limitations: There are two 
limitations. Firstly, the parameters for the comparators were based on some 
assumptions. However, it was a conservative setting against MitraClip group. 
Secondary, the mortality rate and adverse events of MitraClip group in a 
lifetime were estimated from data during a year after the procedure.Conclusions: 
MitraClip procedure improved life-years and quality of life in patients at high 
surgical risk and it was also a cost-effective treatment option.

Aim: Optimal use of scarce resources is a focus in the healthcare sector, as 
resources devoted to health care are limited. Costs and health economic analyses 
can help guide decision-making concerning treatments. One important factor is 
the choice of cost perspective that can range from a focus on narrow drug budget 
costs to broader economic perspectives. In the case of treatment with oral 
anticoagulants in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing deep 
vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, the aim of this cost analysis was to 
illustrate the differences in costs when applying different cost 
perspectives.Methods: In a cost analysis, pairwise comparisons of average costs 
of 6 months standard treatment with either a low molecular weight heparin 
parenteral anticoagulant (LMWH) and a Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA) versus one of 
the non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [NOACs; dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, 
apixaban, and edoxaban) used in daily clinical practice in Denmark for VTE 
patients were carried out. Each analysis included the results from five 
different cost analyses with increasingly broader cost perspectives going from 
the narrowest "drug cost only" perspective to the broadest "societal" 
perspective.Results: Focusing on "drug costs only", LMWH/VKA was associated with 
the lowest costs compared to all NOACs. However, including the economic impact 
of preventing recurrent VTE and limit bleedings, apixaban and rivaroxaban 
resulted in slightly lower health care costs than LMWH/VKA. When applying the 
"societal perspective", the total costs saved with apixaban and rivaroxaban 
compared to LMWH/VKA further increased, with apixaban having the lowest total 
costs.Conclusions: The present study's case of oral anticoagulants in VTE 
treatment illustrated the importance of the cost perspective in the choice of 
therapy. If decision-making were based on drug costs only, instead of applying a 
health care sector or societal cost perspective, suboptimal decisions may be 
likely.

Japan's health system is well known for achieving one of the world's highest 
life expectancy with universal health coverage. However, the country now faces 
challenges of a rapidly aging population and changes in patterns and burden of 
disease. Primary care is an important component of a well-functioning health 
system. In Japan, primary care services are provided in both the community and 
hospital settings. The distinction between primary and secondary care may not 
always be clear. This review is based on the framework from the 2015 WHO 
publication on primary care systems in Europe. Our aim is to describe the 
journey of primary care in Japan, with its past, present, and future as a 
valuable addition to the academic English literature. We also hope that this 
article would inspire readers outside of Japan who might face similar issues in 
their respective countries.

BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with a 5 to 10 years 
reduction in life expectancy due to premature atherosclerosis. This reduction is 
the consequence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors (TCRF) as well as 
systemic inflammation. The aim of the present study was to describe the 
prevalence and factors associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in RA at the 
University Hospital of Kinshasa (UHK).
METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of RA based on the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria 
were included in this cross-sectional study from 1 June 2014 to 31 May 2015 at 
the UHK. RA disease activity was measured using the DAS28-ESR. Active RA was 
defined by a DAS 28 > 2.6. Severe RA was defined by the presence of 
extra-articular manifestation, joint erosions on X-rays or HAQ ≥0.5. An 
assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis was performed by the measurement of 
the carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) using two-dimensional ultrasonography. 
Subclinical atherosclerosis was defined by a cIMT ≥0.9 mm. A diagnosis of 
atheroma plaque was retained when the cIMT was ≥1.5 mm. The association between 
subclinical atherosclerosis and potential risk factors was modeled using 
logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: We recruited 75 patients. The average age was 51.8 ± 14.6 years, with a 
sex ratio F/M of 4. The prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis was 32%. In 
logistic regression being a woman of ≥55 years old (aOR 10.6, 95% CI 
[2.087-53.82], p = 0.028), DAS28-ESR > 2.6 (aOR 3.5,95% CI [1.55-10.38], 
p = 0.044), severe RA (aOR 32.6,95% CI [1.761-60.37],p = 0.035), high blood 
pressure (aOR 22.4,95% CI [5.04-99.41], p = 0.005) and obesity (aOR 32.3, 95% CI 
[2.606-40.73], p = 0.026) emerged as factors associated with subclinical 
atherosclerosis.
CONCLUSION: Subclinical atherosclerosis is common in RA patients attending the 
UHK. It appears to be associated with RA disease activity and severity apart 
from traditional cardiovascular risk factors. These results suggest that early 
management of subclinical atherosclerosis targeting remaining RA disease 
activity and cardiovascular risk factors could slow down progression to clinical 
cardiovascular disease.

An inverse correlation between thyroid hormone levels and longevity has been 
reported in several species and reduced thyroid hormone levels have been 
proposed as a biomarker for healthy aging and metabolic fitness. However, 
hypothyroidism is a medical condition associated with compromised health and 
reduced life expectancy. Herein, we show, using wild-type and the Pax8 ablated 
model of hypothyroidism in mice, that hyperthyroidism and severe hypothyroidism 
are associated with an overall unhealthy status and shorter lifespan. Mild 
hypothyroid Pax8 +/- mice were heavier and displayed insulin resistance, hepatic 
steatosis and increased prevalence of liver cancer yet had normal lifespan. 
These pathophysiological conditions were precipitated by hepatic mitochondrial 
dysfunction and oxidative damage accumulation. These findings indicate that 
individuals carrying mutations on PAX8 may be susceptible to develop liver 
cancer and/or diabetes and raise concerns regarding the development of 
interventions aiming to modulate thyroid hormones to promote healthy aging or 
lifespan in mammals.

Abstract-This paper evaluates resource commitments to primary health care (PHC) 
by donors and selected governments between 1990-2011. Donor commitments to 
financing PHC are assessed by reclassifying OECD/CRS data on health assistance 
into spending on 'PHC Service Delivery' versus spending on 'Health System 
Strengthening'. Domestic spending on PHC is assessed using a case study approach 
and National Health Accounts for two major recipients of donor assistance, 
Ethiopia and Nigeria. Results are generally consistent with three simple 
hypotheses that guide the inquiry. First, though donor funding for health among 
LICs has mushroomed over the last decade, it remains a miniscule share of per 
capita spending targets prescribed by international forums to attain universal 
access to basic/essential PHC services. Relative to levels of domestic public 
spending in LICs, however, donor funding has considerably more significance as a 
potential lever to improve PHC efficiency. Second, as reflected in on-going 
debate in the literature, donor spending on broader 'health system 
strengthening' has not kept up with mushrooming financing of disease control 
programs. Third, at country level, where the 'rubber meets the road', allocative 
efficiency of donor and domestic spending on health is highly conditional on 
contextual factors, especially political will to improve financing and delivery 
of PHC services, and the process of managing and implementing public spending on 
PHC.

OBJECTIVE: Patients older than 80 years have significantly lower early mortality 
with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) compared with open repair for abdominal 
aortic aneurysms (AAAs), but long-term results remain poorly studied. We 
analyzed the results of both emergent and elective AAA repair in patients aged 
80 years or older who had at least 5 years of follow-up.
METHODS: Retrospective review of a prospectively collected vascular surgery 
database was performed to identify all patients who underwent elective repair of 
an AAA between 2007 and 2012 and were 80 years of age or older at the time of 
surgery. Open and EVAR groups were compared using univariate statistics.
RESULTS: The study cohort was composed of 314 patients 80 years of age or older 
(median, 83 years; interquartile range, 5 years) who underwent repair (96 open, 
218 EVAR). The groups had similar comorbidities, except that EVAR patients were 
more likely to be male and open repair patients were more likely to have larger 
aneurysms. Compared with open repair, elective early postoperative mortality was 
significantly lower for EVAR patients (1% vs 14%; P < .001). Overall mean life 
expectancy was 5.9 years (EVAR, 5.8 years; open repair, 5.8 years; P = .98). The 
1-year survival was significantly higher for EVAR (92.9%) than for open repair 
(84.1%; P = .02). The 2-year survival (EVAR, 83.4%; open repair, 74.6%; P = .07) 
and 5-year survival (EVAR, 57.8%; open repair, 60.3%; P = .98) did not differ 
between EVAR and open repair. Reintervention rates (EVAR, 18%; open repair, 2%; 
P = .05) were higher in the endovascular treatment group.
CONCLUSIONS: EVAR results in an improved 1-year mortality in octogenarians 
compared with open repair, although 5-year survival is similar between the 
groups. With average life expectancies of >5 years and an 18% reintervention 
rate, diligent follow-up is required after EVAR even in elderly patients.

BACKGROUND: The number of elderly patients among the severely injured has been 
increasing continuously. It has been suggested that an increased life expectancy 
and a higher level of activity and mobility in older ages could explain this 
observation. Elderly trauma patients have relevant higher mortality rates and 
poorer functional outcomes. The reasons remain unclear. The aim of this study 
was to look for differences in the management of severely injured elderly 
patients compared to younger age groups and to evaluate their potential impact 
on outcome.
METHODS: The TraumaRegister DGU® is a multicenter database that documents 
de-identified data of severely injured patients since 1993. Trauma cases 
documented between 2009 and 2016 with an ISS ≥ 9 were divided in four age 
groups. The groups were compared with respect to mechanism of injury, pattern of 
injury, severity of injury, management and outcome.
RESULTS: The analysis of 126,015 severely injured patients showed that 37.5% of 
the population were elderly patients (≥ 60 years). Their rate actually increased 
every year by 1.7%. The elderly trauma patients experience different mechanisms 
of injury (more low energy trauma) and different pattern of injuries (more brain 
trauma, less abdominal and extremity injuries). Evaluating the management of 
patients showed that elderly patients have lower intubation rates and less 
volume replacement in the prehospital setting. Diagnostic interventions like CT 
scans in the emergency room were performed more restrictively. Elderly trauma 
patients also received fewer surgical interventions for brain injuries, pelvic 
fractures and femur fractures. Their hospital mortality rates were higher.
CONCLUSIONS: Severely injured elderly patients are treated with a more "wait and 
see approach" resulting in higher mortality rates. We suggest that this 
population needs a more "aggressive management" to improve their outcome, if the 
wish to perform complete treatment including surgical procedures and intensive 
care medicine has not been excluded by the patients or their legal guardian.

Dental caries is a type of oral microbiome dysbiosis and biofilm infection that 
affects oral and systemic conditions. For healthy life expectancy, natural 
bacteriostatic products are ideal for daily and lifetime use as anti-oral 
infection agents. This study aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of abietic 
acid, a diterpene derived from pine rosin, on the in vitro growth of cariogenic 
bacterial species, Streptococcus mutans. The effective minimum inhibitory 
concentration of abietic acid was determined through observation of S. mutans 
growth, acidification, and biofilm formation. The inhibitory effects of abietic 
acid on the bacterial membrane were investigated through the use of in situ 
viability analysis and scanning electron microscopic analysis. Cytotoxicity of 
abietic acid was also examined in the context of several human cell lines using 
tetrazolium reduction assay. Abietic acid was found to inhibit key bacterial 
growth hallmarks such as colony forming ability, adenosine triphosphate activity 
(both planktonic and biofilm), acid production, and biofilm formation. Abietic 
acid was identified as bacteriostatic, and this compound caused minimal damage 
to the bacterial membrane. This action was different from that of 
povidone-iodine or cetylpyridinium chloride. Additionally, abietic acid was 
significantly less cytotoxic compared to povidone-iodine, and it exerted lower 
toxicity towards epithelial cells and fibroblasts compared to that against 
monocytic cells. These data suggest that abietic acid may prove useful as an 
antibacterial and antibiofilm agent for controlling S. mutans infection.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to provide a summary of the evaluation and 
treatment of older adults (≥ 65 years) with type 2 diabetes and/or hyperglycemia 
in the hospital.
RECENT FINDINGS: Caring for these older adults requires special considerations. 
Diabetes is a risk factor for hospitalization and hyperglycemia in the hospital 
is associated with increased complications and mortality. Treatment plans for 
hospitalized older adults with diabetes should include a comprehensive geriatric 
assessment. This team-based approach aims to develop an individualized care 
plan, with consideration of the patients' personal goals, comorbidities, 
functional status, life expectancy, and hypoglycemia risk. Studies from 
hospitalized middle age and older adults with hyperglycemia can help guide 
diabetes treatment goals and management in older adults. Further studies, 
examining both glucose targets and care management assessments and treatment 
plan specifically targeting older adults in the hospital setting, are needed.

Modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) extends life expectancy for people living 
with HIV (PLWH). However, most older PLWH (≥50 years) "aged" with HIV and were 
exposed to historical HIV care practices and older, more toxic ART. In PLWH with 
exposure to older and multiple ART regimens, the drug interactions between ART 
frequently used in treatment-experienced persons and commonly used 
immunosuppressants remain a significant challenge. However, the advent of newer 
ART classes (eg, integrase non-strand transfer inhibitors) and more advanced HIV 
genetic resistance testing may allow optimization of ART regimens with minimal 
drug interactions. Here, we present a case series of three PLWH whose 
complicated ART interacted (or was at risk for interacting) with their 
post-liver transplant immunosuppression. After a review of their proviral DNA 
resistance testing, they successfully transitioned onto safer integrase 
non-strand transfer inhibitor-containing ART regimens without viral blips or 
evidence of organ rejection.

Significant practice variation surrounds universal or contextual prescription of 
self-injectable epinephrine (SIE) for patients receiving AIT.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the cost-effectiveness of a universal vs contextual 
SIE requirement for patients receiving AIT.
METHODS: An economic evaluation using cohort and microsimulation was performed 
from both the societal and health care sector perspectives for patients 
undergoing AIT, assessing a universal requirement to fill SIE prescriptions at 
the outset of therapy compared with requiring this only after a systemic 
reaction to immunotherapy (SRIT).
RESULTS: A universal SIE requirement for AIT is not cost-effective, with the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for this strategy estimated at $669,327,730 
per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). In the microsimulation (n = 10,000), the 
mean (SD) costs of a universal approach exceeded that of a more context-specific 
strategy where SIE was only prescribed for patients after an initial SRIT 
($19,653.36 [$4296.66] vs $16,232.14 [$5204.32]), and given the effects on rates 
of AIT discontinuation, the universal approach was less effective (mean [SD], 
25.555 [2.285] QALYs) compared with a contextualized approach (mean [SD], 25.579 
[2.345] QALYs). Universal SIE prescription could be cost-effective if it 
provided a 1000 times protection against AIT fatality at a value-based cost of 
$24, and the annual AIT fatality rates unrealistically exceed 2.6 per 10,000 
patients.
CONCLUSION: In a simulation of potential SIE-prescribing strategies for patients 
receiving AIT, a universal approach to an epinephrine autoinjector requirement 
was not cost-effective when compared with an approach in which an SIE is 
prescribed only to patients with prior SRIT.

RNA structure underpins many essential functions in biology. New chemical 
reagents and techniques for probing RNA structure in living cells have emerged 
in recent years. High-throughput, genome-wide techniques such as Structure-seq2 
and DMS-MaPseq exploit nucleobase modification by dimethylsulfate (DMS) to 
obtain complete structuromes, and are applicable to multiple domains of life and 
conditions. New reagents such as 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide 
(EDC), glyoxal, and nicotinoyl azide (NAz) greatly expand the capabilities of 
nucleobase probing in cells. Additionally, ribose-targeting reagents in 
selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension (SHAPE) detect RNA 
flexibility in vivo. These techniques, coupled with crosslinking nucleobases in 
psoralen analysis of RNA interactions and structures (PARIS), provide new and 
diverse ways to elucidate RNA secondary and tertiary structure in vivo and 
genome-wide.

BACKGROUND: Because its mechanical properties are similar to cortical bones of 
the knee, polyetheretherketone (PEEK) material has been used to make total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA) components. This study investigated the PEEK femoral 
component deformation of a TKA system and compared the data with that of a 
cobalt-chromium (CoCr) component.
METHODS: A 3D finite element knee model was constructed using CT images of a 
normal subject. A knee prosthesis was installed on the model to simulate a TKA 
knee. The material properties of the bone were assumed linear and transverse 
isotropic. The femoral component was modeled using a PEEK or CoCr material. A 
compressive load was applied to the knee at full extension. Tibiofemoral contact 
stresses and femoral component deformations were analyzed.
FINDINGS: Under a 3 kN load, the maximal Von-Mises stresses in the femoral 
component were 14.39 MPa and 30.05 MPa for the PEEK and CoCr components, 
respectively. At the tibial polyethylene surface, the CoCr femoral component 
caused higher contact stresses (>2.2%) than the PEEK component. The deformation 
of the PEEK component was over 3 times larger than that of the CoCr component 
(0.65 × 10-3 mm vs 0.2 × 10-3 mm).
INTERPRETATION: The PEEK femoral component could result in lower contact 
stresses, but larger deformations in the TKA knee compared to the CoCr 
component. An increased deformation of the PEEK component indicates a reduction 
in its structural strength. Future investigation should examine if the reduced 
structural strength will affect the in-vivo component-bone interface integration 
and affect the component fatigue life.

BACKGROUND: Forecast of disease burden in lung cancer is an important health 
agenda. One of the main challenges is to predict the evolution of trends in 
disability-adjusted life year (DALY) of lung cancer so as to anticipate the 
future burden and to coordinate the supply of sufficient health services and 
care.
METHODS: Using 2004-2013 cancer registry data in Guangzhou, we fitted Bayesian 
age-period-cohort models with age, period, and cohort effects to analyze trends 
of lung cancer among women, and then made forecast for DALY of lung cancer until 
2030.
RESULTS: During 2004-2013, there was an annual average of 10,582 DALYs for lung 
cancer (15.84% of total DALY). In 2014-2030, DALY is expected to reach 234,752 
person-years for lung cancer (12.25% of total DALY), with an annual mean of 
13,809 DALYs. Lung cancer crude DALY rate is projected to rise steadily from 
257.56 (95% uncertainty interval: 165.97-361.22) in 2014 to 316.99 
(219.96-419.41) per 100,000 women in 2030, and the rise is mainly seen in 45-64 
years age group. Lung cancer DALY rate remains the highest in the 65-89 years 
age group.
CONCLUSIONS: Women at 65-89 years carry the highest lung cancer burden among 
other age groups in Guangzhou. The DALY rate of lung cancer is projected to 
increase most precipitously for the 45-64 years age group. This indicates that 
concerted efforts are needed to develop adequate cancer services, and to 
reassess health resources for control and care of lung cancer in these 
populations.

BACKGROUND: Serious mental illness (SMI) reduces life expectancy, primarily due 
to somatic comorbidity linked to obesity. Meta-analyses have found beneficial 
effects of lifestyle interventions in people with SMI and recommended their 
implementation to manage obesity.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the benefits 
and harms of individualized lifestyle interventions for weight in people 
diagnosed with SMI and to explore potential mediators and moderators of the 
effect.
METHODS: The protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42016049093). Randomized 
clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of individualized lifestyle 
interventions on weight management in people with SMI were included. Primary 
outcomes were differences in endpoint body mass index (BMI) and the proportion 
achieving clinically relevant weight loss (≥5%). Secondary outcomes included 
quality of life, cardiometabolic risk factors, and adverse effects.
RESULTS: We included 41 RCTs (n = 4,267). All trials were at high risk of bias 
according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The 
experimental interventions reduced the mean difference in BMI by -0.63 kg/m2 
(95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.02 to -0.23; p = 0.002; I2 = 70.7%) compared 
to the control groups. At postintervention follow-up (17 RCTs), the effect size 
remained similar but was no longer significant (BMI = -0.63 kg/m2; 95% CI = 
-1.30 to 0.04; p = 0.07; I2 = 48.8%). The risk ratio for losing ≥5% of baseline 
weight was 1.51 (95% CI = 1.07-2.13; p = 0.02) compared to the control groups. 
GRADE showed very low or low quality of evidence.
CONCLUSION: There is a statistically significant, but clinically insignificant, 
mean effect of individualized lifestyle interventions for weight reduction in 
people with SMI.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of persistence on cost-effectiveness of 
subcutaneous tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors (SC-TNFis) from healthcare and 
societal perspectives in a United Kingdom ankylosing spondylitis (AS) population 
using a recently published Markov cohort model.
METHODS: A recently published cost-effectiveness model developed for a National 
Institute for health and Care Excellence appraisal was extended to fit the 
current study; in brief, it is a Markov cohort model where treatment responders 
continue from the trial period with maintenance SC-TNFi treatment, while 
non-responders transition to conventional care. Costs and effects were modeled 
for a hypothetical SC-TNFi with average efficacy and price. Model outcomes 
included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total direct and indirect lifetime 
costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The cost-effectiveness 
of SC-TNFi persistence was estimated by decreasing the annual discontinuation 
probability in five percentage point increments from 25 to 5% per annum.
RESULTS: From a health care perspective, the ICERs for the modeled 
discontinuation rates compared to the baseline annual discontinuation rate (25%) 
ranged between GBP 17,277 and GBP 18,161. From a societal perspective, increased 
discontinuation rates resulted in decreased total costs and higher QALYs; hence, 
lower discontinuation rates dominated higher discontinuation rates from a 
societal perspective.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study shows that, all else equal, higher SC-TNFi 
treatment persistence in AS is cost effective from a health care perspective and 
dominant from a societal perspective. Hence, all else equal, prescribing the 
SC-TNFi with the highest persistence may be considered a cost-effective 
strategy.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus is a neurological disorder with 
clinical diagnosis and imaging confirmation that benefits from a neurosurgical 
therapeutic solution in the vast majority of cases. Prevalence among the general 
population is not well defined at this time, but prevalence and incidence in 
developed countries is certainly steadily increasing due to increased life 
expectancy and evolution of diagnostic methods. Early diagnosis and appropriate 
treatment contribute to improving living conditions and can significantly reduce 
the cost of medical care for the elderly.

A wide variety of single molecules can be identified by nanopore sensing. 
However, all reported nanopore sensing applications result from the same 
measurement configuration adapted from electrophysiology. Although urgently 
needed in commercial nanopore sequencing, parallel electrophysiology recording 
is limited in its cost and its throughput due to the introduced complexities 
from electronic integration. We present the first electrode-free nanopore 
sensing method defined as DiffusiOptoPhysiology (DOP), in which single-molecule 
events are monitored optically without any electrical connections. 
Single-molecule sensing of small molecules, macromolecules, and 
biomacromolecules was subsequently demonstrated. As a further extension, a 
fingertip-sized, multiplexed chip with single-molecule sensing capabilities has 
been introduced, which suggests a new concept of clinical diagnosis using 
disposable nanopore sensors. DOP, which is universally compatible with all types 
of channels and a variety of fluorescence imaging platforms, may benefit diverse 
areas such as nanopore sequencing, drug screening, and channel protein 
investigations.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a significant problem in the aging population, 
causing pain, impaired mobility, and decreased quality of life. Conservative 
treatment methods are necessary to reduce rapidly increasing rates of knee joint 
surgery. Recommended strategies include weight loss and knee bracing to unload 
knee joint forces. Although weight loss can be beneficial for joint unloading, 
knee OA patients often find it difficult to lose weight or begin exercise due to 
knee pain, and not all patients are overweight. Unicompartment offloader knee 
braces can redistribute joint forces away from one tibiofemoral (TF) 
compartment; however, <5% of patients have unicompartmental tibiofemoral 
osteoarthritis (TFOA), while patients with isolated patellofemoral or 
multicompartmental OA are much more common. By absorbing body weight (BW) and 
assisting the knee extension moment using a spring-loaded hinge, sufficiently 
powerful knee-extension-assist (KEA) braces could be useful for unloading the 
whole knee. This paper (1) describes the design of a spring-loaded 
tricompartment unloader (TCU) knee brace intended to provide unloading in all 
three compartments of the knee while weight-bearing, (2) measures and compares 
the force output of the TCU against the only published and commercially 
available KEA brace, and (3) calculates the static unloading capacity of each 
device. The TCU and KEA braces delivered maximum assistive moments equivalent to 
reducing BW by approximately 45 and 6 lbs, respectively. The paper concludes 
that sufficiently powerful spring-loaded knee braces show promise in a new class 
of multicompartment unloader knee orthoses, capable of providing a clinically 
meaningful unloading effect across all three knee compartments.

University, Hamedan, Iran.

Hydrocolloids (gums) have a good functional characteristic such as emulsifying, 
gelling, solubility, and textural improvement. In the bakery products, 
hydrocolloids were used to improving dough performance, bread and cake 
characteristics, sensorial quality, and extension the products shelf life. 
Several studies reported the potential use of hydrocolloids in breads, biscuits, 
cakes, and pasta formulation. The present review summarized the effect of the 
most common and new hydrocolloids (xanthan, guar, Arabic, carrageenan, karaya, 
alginate, acacia, methylcellulose, carboxy methyl cellulose, hydroxyl propyl 
methyl cellulose, locust bean, balangu seed, wild sage seed, basil seed, and 
cress seed gums) on the rheological, physicochemical, textural, and quality 
characteristics of bakery products. Gums addition improved volume and porosity 
of the breads and cakes. Gums influence on the gelatinization and retrogradation 
of starch and decreased the retrogradation of starch. In the bakery products, 
hydrocolloids were used to improving mixing and increasing the shelf life of the 
products through moisture preservation and avoidance of syneresis in some frozen 
foods. This study summarized the influence of the most common and new 
hydrocolloids on the rheological, physicochemical, textural, and quality 
characteristics of bakery products. Addition of seeds gum to the breads, 
biscuits, cakes, and pasta formula led to an increase in the viscosity of the 
batter. Also, the firmness of bakery products showed that they became softer 
with increasing gum levels.
