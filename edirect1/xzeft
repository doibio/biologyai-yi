BACKGROUND: Routine reporting of cancer patient survival is important, both to 
monitor the effectiveness of health care and to inform about prognosis following 
a cancer diagnosis. A range of different survival measures exist, each serving 
different purposes and targeting different audiences. It is important that 
routine publications expand on current practice and provide estimates on a wider 
range of survival measures. We examine the feasibility of automated production 
of such statistics.
METHODS: We used data on 23 cancer sites obtained from the Cancer Registry of 
Norway (CRN). We propose an automated way of estimating flexible parametric 
relative survival models and calculating estimates of net survival, crude 
probabilities, and loss in life expectancy across many cancer sites and 
subgroups of patients.
RESULTS: For 21 of 23 cancer sites, we were able to estimate survival models 
without assuming proportional hazards. Reliable estimates of all desired 
measures were obtained for all cancer sites.
DISCUSSION: It may be challenging to implement new survival measures in routine 
publications as it can require the application of modeling techniques. We 
propose a way of automating the production of such statistics and show that we 
can obtain reliable estimates across a range of measures and subgroups of 
patients.

Early life microbial colonization and factors affecting colonization patterns 
are gaining interest due to recent developments suggesting that early life 
microbiome may play a role in Developmental Origins of Health and Disease. In 
cattle, limited information exists on the early microbial colonization of 
anatomical sites involved in bovine health beyond the gastrointestinal tract. 
Here, we investigated 1) the initial microbial colonization of seven different 
anatomical locations in newborn calves and 2) whether these early life microbial 
communities and 3) serum cytokine profiles are influenced by prenatal vitamin 
and mineral (VTM) supplementation. Samples were collected from the hoof, liver, 
lung, nasal cavity, eye, rumen (tissue and fluid), and vagina of beef calves 
that were born from dams that either received or did not receive VTM 
supplementation throughout gestation (n = 7/group). Calves were separated from 
dams immediately after birth and fed commercial colostrum and milk replacer 
until euthanasia at 30 h post-initial colostrum feeding. The microbiota of all 
samples was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR. Calf serum was 
subjected to multiplex quantification of 15 bovine cytokines and chemokines. Our 
results indicated that the hoof, eye, liver, lung, nasal cavity, and vagina of 
newborn calves were colonized by site-specific microbiota, whose community 
structure differed from the ruminal-associated communities (0.64 ≥ R2 ≥ 0.12, p 
≤ 0.003). The ruminal fluid microbial community was the only one that differed 
by treatment (p < 0.01). However, differences (p < 0.05) by treatment were 
detected in microbial richness (vagina); diversity (ruminal tissue, fluid, and 
eye); composition at the phylum and genus level (ruminal tissue, fluid, and 
vagina); and in total bacterial abundance (eye and vagina). From serum cytokines 
evaluated, concentration of chemokine IP-10 was greater (p = 0.02) in VTM calves 
compared to control calves. Overall, our results suggest that upon birth, the 
whole-body of newborn calves are colonized by relatively rich, diverse, and 
site-specific bacterial communities. Noticeable differences were observed in 
ruminal, vaginal, and ocular microbiota of newborn calves in response to 
prenatal VTM supplementation. These findings can derive future hypotheses 
regarding the initial microbial colonization of different body sites, and on 
maternal micronutrient consumption as a factor that may influence early life 
microbial colonization.

Biomaterial implantation into the human body plays a key role in the medical 
field and biological applications. Increasing the life expectancy of biomaterial 
implants, reducing the rejection reaction inside the human body and reducing the 
risk of infection are the problems in this field that need to be solved 
urgently. The surface modification of biomaterials can change the original 
physical, chemical and biological properties and improve the function of 
materials. This review focuses on the application of surface modification 
techniques in various fields of biomaterials reported in the past few years. The 
surface modification techniques include film and coating synthesis, covalent 
grafting, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), plasma surface modification and 
other strategies. First, a brief introduction to these surface modification 
techniques for biomaterials is given. Subsequently, the review focuses on how 
these techniques change the properties of biomaterials, and evaluates the 
effects of modification on the cytocompatibility, antibacterial, antifouling and 
surface hydrophobic properties of biomaterials. In addition, the implications 
for the design of biomaterials with different functions are discussed. Finally, 
based on this review, it is expected that the biomaterials have development 
prospects in the medical field.

BACKGROUND: As life expectancy increases, understanding the mechanism for 
late-life depression and finding a crucial moderator becomes more important for 
mental health in older adults. Childhood adversity increases the risk of 
clinical depression even in old age. Based on the stress sensitivity theory and 
stress-buffering effects, stress would be a significant mediator, while social 
support can be a key moderator in the mediation pathways. However, few studies 
have tested this moderated mediation model with a sample of older adults. This 
study aims to reveal the association between childhood adversity and late-life 
depression in older adults, taking into consideration the effects of stress and 
social support.
METHODS: This study used several path models to analyze the data from 622 
elderly participants who were never diagnosed with clinical depression.
RESULTS: We found that childhood adversity increases the odds ratio of 
depression by approximately 20% in older adults. Path model with mediation 
demonstrates that stress fully mediates the pathway from childhood adversity to 
late-life depression. Path model with moderated mediation also illustrates that 
social support significantly weakens the association between childhood adversity 
and perceived stress.
CONCLUSION: This study provides empirical evidence to reveal a more detailed 
mechanism for late-life depression. Specifically, this study identifies one 
crucial risk factor and one protective factor, stress and social support, 
respectively. This brings insight into prevention of late-life depression among 
those who have experienced childhood adversity.

The use of partial code status in pediatric medicine presents clinicians with 
unique ethical challenges. The clinical vignette describes the presentation of a 
pulseless infant with a limited life expectancy. The infant's parents instruct 
the emergency medicine providers to resuscitate but not to intubate. In an 
emergency, without a clear understanding of parents' goals, complying with their 
request risks an ineffective resuscitation. The first commentary focuses on 
parental grief and how, in certain circumstances, a partial code best serves 
their needs. Its authors argue that providers are sometimes obligated to endure 
moral distress. The second commentary focuses on the healthcare team's moral 
distress and highlights the implications of a relational ethics framework for 
the case. The commentators emphasize the importance of honest communication and 
pain management. The final commentary explores the systems-level and how the 
design of hospital code status orders may contribute to requests for partial 
codes. They argue systems should discourage partial codes and prohibit 
resuscitation without intubation.

PURPOSE: For patients with a failed forearm autogenous fistula (AF) and an 
exhausted cephalic vein, there is controversy about whether a brachial basilic 
AF with transposition or an arteriovenous prosthetic bridging graft (BG) must be 
the second vascular access option. This work measured and compared these two 
modalities according to patency rates, complications, and revisions.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 104 cases that had either a 
brachial basilic AF (72) or an Arteriovenous BG (32). Technical success, 
operative complications, procedurerelated mortality, maturation time, functional 
primary, secondary, and overall patency rates were all assessed.
RESULTS: Technical success was obtained in all participants. No procedure-linked 
mortality. Maturation time for BGs was significantly shorter than AFs. The 
complication rate was significantly higher in BGs than in AFs. The most 
prevalent complication was access thrombosis. The functional primary patency 
rate was significantly higher in AF than in BG at 12-month followup: 77.7% vs 
53.1% (p < 0.012). secondary patency rate was higher in AF than in BG at 1-year 
follow-up 62.5% vs 42.8% (p = 0.063), respectively. In addition, BGs required 
more interventions to preserve patency.
CONCLUSIONS: AF had higher primary, secondary and overall functional patency 
rates and needed fewer procedures to keep patency than BGs. Cases that need 
early vascular access as a result of central venous catheter complications or 
who have a reduced life expectancy may benefit from BGs.

As the life expectancy and growth of the aging population increase globally, 
efforts to promote healthy longevity become more important. Holistic policy 
guidelines and actions have been designed to advocate and fortify healthy aging 
at multiple levels. Oral health, a fundamental contributor of overall health and 
well-being, forms a core part of the noncommunicable disease agenda within the 
sustainable development goals set by the World Health Organization. Aging 
significantly heightens the risk of myriad oral disorders and other 
noncommunicable diseases. As of 2019, oral disorders accounted for 8.9 million 
disability-adjusted life-years in individuals older than 60 y. In addition to 
the development of multidisciplinary aging-friendly policies to promote healthy 
aging, basic biology and translational research has been encouraged that focuses 
on deciphering the underlying mechanisms involved in age-related physical and 
cognitive decline or dysregulation of oral tissues. Given the relevance of oral 
health aging as a critical component of the One Health Initiative, this special 
issue encompasses a collection of articles dedicated to recent advances in the 
behavioral and social implications of age-related oral diseases and tooth loss 
on several aspects of the quality of life of adults as they age. Furthermore, it 
includes articles detailing molecular mechanisms associated with cellular aging 
and their implications for oral tissue health, periodontal disease severity, and 
the regenerative potential of stem cells.

Remnant muscles in the residual limb after amputation are the most common source 
of control signals for prosthetic hands, because myoelectric signals can be 
generated by the user at will. However, for individuals with amputation higher 
up the arm, such as an above-elbow (transhumeral) amputation, insufficient 
muscles remain to generate myoelectric signals to enable control of the lost arm 
and hand joints, thus making intuitive control of wrist and finger prosthetic 
joints unattainable. We show that severed nerves can be divided along their 
fascicles and redistributed to concurrently innervate different types of muscle 
targets, particularly native denervated muscles and nonvascularized free muscle 
grafts. We engineered these neuromuscular constructs with implanted electrodes 
that were accessible via a permanent osseointegrated interface, allowing for 
bidirectional communication with the prosthesis while also providing direct 
skeletal attachment. We found that the transferred nerves effectively innervated 
their new targets as shown by a gradual increase in myoelectric signal strength. 
This allowed for individual flexion and extension of all five fingers of a 
prosthetic hand by a patient with a transhumeral amputation. Improved prosthetic 
function in tasks representative of daily life was also observed. This 
proof-of-concept study indicates that motor neural commands can be increased by 
creating electro-neuromuscular constructs using distributed nerve transfers to 
different muscle targets with implanted electrodes, enabling improved control of 
a limb prosthesis.

Rapid advances in potency, safety, and availability of modern HIV antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) have yielded a near-normal life expectancy for most people living 
with HIV (PLWH). Ironically, considering the history of HIV/AIDS (initially 
called "slim disease" due to associated weight loss), the latest dilemma faced 
by many people starting HIV therapy is weight gain and obesity, particularly 
Black people, women, and those who commenced treatment with advanced 
immunodeficiency. We review the pathophysiology and implications of weight gain 
among PLWH on ART and discuss why this phenomenon was only recognized recently, 
despite the availability of effective therapy for nearly 30 years. We 
comprehensively explore the theories of the causes, from initial speculation 
that weight gain was simply a return to health for people recovering from 
wasting to comparative effects of newer regimens versus prior toxic agents, to 
direct effects of agents on mitochondrial function. We then discuss the 
implications of weight gain on modern ART, particularly concomitant effects on 
lipids, glucose metabolism, and inflammatory markers. Finally, we discuss 
intervention options for PLWH and obesity, from the limitations of switching ART 
regimens or specific agents within regimens, weight-gain mitigation strategies, 
and potential hope in access to emerging anti-obesity agents, which are yet to 
be evaluated in this population.

Systemic Therapy in Older Patients With High-Risk Disease.

Brain EGC(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Curie, Saint-Cloud, France.

Adjuvant systemic treatments for older patients with breast cancer require 
constant dose or schedule adjustments of standards established for younger ones. 
This is mainly due to frailty that increases according to age (40%-50% of 
signals in all comers after age 70 years) and remains difficult to spot or 
diagnose accurately and therefore is often overlooked. Older patients are at 
higher risk to develop side effects whether under chemotherapy, optimized 
endocrine treatment, or targeted therapies. Pharmacokinetic reflects poorly 
functional reserves that reduce with aging and is therefore misleading. The 
demonstration of significant long-term benefits provided by adjuvant treatments 
is challenged by life expectancy, driven by multimorbidity status that increases 
with age, competing with cancer outcome. When geriatric assessment is 
incorporated into the multidisciplinary team, treatment decision process shows 
30%-50% changes, de-escalating initial age-agnostic treatment choices in two of 
three cases. Finally, expectations from treatment vary over the years: In older 
ones, although not being exclusive, there is a general shift of preference for 
protecting functionality, cognitive functions, and independence, as summarized 
in quality of life that many systemic adjuvant treatment may jeopardize. These 
provocative considerations show importance to pay more attention to expectations 
expressed by older patients to limit gaps between what is thought by health care 
professionals as right, often on the basis of dose intensity models strongly 
engrained in oncology and that older patients may assess counterintuitively 
differently. The most achieved molecular testing to identify high-risk luminal 
tumors should be combined with determinant geriatric factors to bring relevant 
global information in the adjuvant setting for older patients.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic disease that is caused by mutations 
in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The 
recent development of a class of drugs called "correctors", which repair the 
structure and function of mutant CFTR, has greatly enhanced the life expectancy 
of CF patients. These correctors target the most common disease causing CFTR 
mutant F508del and are exemplified by the FDA-approved VX-809. While one binding 
site of VX-809 to CFTR was recently elucidated by cryo-electron microscopy, four 
additional binding sites have been proposed in the literature and it has been 
theorized that VX-809 and structurally similar correctors may engage multiple 
CFTR binding sites. To explore these five binding sites, ensemble docking was 
performed on wild-type CFTR and the F508del mutant using a large library of 
structurally similar corrector drugs, including VX-809 (lumacaftor), VX-661 
(tezacaftor), ABBV-2222 (galicaftor), and a host of other structurally related 
molecules. For wild-type CFTR, we find that only one site, located in membrane 
spanning domain 1 (MSD1), binds favorably to our ligand library. While this MSD1 
site also binds our ligand library for F508del-CFTR, the F508del mutation also 
opens a binding site in nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1), which enables strong 
binding of our ligand library to this site. This NBD1 site in F508del-CFTR 
exhibits the strongest overall binding affinity for our library of corrector 
drugs. This data may serve to better understand the structural changes induced 
by mutation of CFTR and how correctors bind to the protein. Additionally, it may 
aid in the design of new, more effective CFTR corrector drugs.

PURPOSE: To investigate the association between time-to-surgery (TTS) and 
overall survival (OS), disease specific survival (DSS) and quality of life (QoL) 
in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 116 patients with OSCC candidate to surgery were 
examined. TTS intervals starting from diagnosis (TTS-clinical-based) and from 
histological reports (TTS-biopsy-based) were calculated. The effects of TTS 
intervals and prognostic factors on 5-year OS and DSS were explored.
RESULTS: In our cohort advanced T-categories OSCCs with TTS < 30 days showed a 
trend to have higher DSS rate (p = 0.049). Patients with 
TTS-clinical-based < 30 days showed better postoperative QoL. Positive surgical 
margins, nodal involvement (pN+), DOI >10 mm, invasive surgery and 
extra-capsular extension in pN+ were found to be significantly associated with a 
poor OS and DSS.
CONCLUSIONS: TTS ≥ 30 days can adversely affect DSS, especially in the advanced 
T categories. Short TTS intervals resulted associated with a better 
postoperative QoL.

With an increasing life expectancy of global human population, there is a 
growing demand for preservation of native articular meniscus and cartilage to 
delay joint arthroplasties, especially in younger and active patients. Since 
damage to the meniscus and hyaline cartilage of the knee have limited intrinsic 
capacity to heal, such lesions lead to premature and/or accelerated 
osteoarthritis. However, knee surgical treatments have evolved and may allow 
restoration of the natural anatomy, delay the progression of damage, and alter 
the biology of the meniscus and articular cartilage. The knee preservation 
surgery is aided by timely detection of such injuries and high-resolution 
illustration and characterization of the pathology using two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), made possible due to better 
MR scanner technology and related software improvements. This article reviews 
the current literature and authors' experience with imaging concepts and 
high-resolution MR imaging techniques as they relate to management and planning 
for such restorative procedures. Relevant arthroscopy correlations have been 
illustrated.

OBJECTIVES: To determine life expectancy and causes of death after bariatric 
surgery in relation to baseline type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the prospective, 
Swedish Obese Subjects study.
METHODS: The study included 2010 patients with obesity who underwent bariatric 
surgery and 2037 matched controls, eligible for surgery. The surgery group 
underwent gastric bypass (n = 265), banding (n = 376), or vertical banded 
gastroplasty (n = 1369). The control group (n = 2037) received usual obesity 
care. Causes of death were obtained from the Swedish Cause of Death Register, 
case sheets and autopsy reports, in patients with baseline T2D (n = 392 surgery 
patients/n = 305 controls) or non-T2D (n = 1609 surgery patients/n = 1726 
controls) during a median follow-up 26 years.
RESULTS: In T2D and non-T2D subgroups, bariatric surgery was associated with 
increased life expectancy (2.1, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.2-4.0; and 
1.6, 0.5-2.7 years, respectively) and reduced overall mortality (adjusted hazard 
ratio (adjHR) = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.61-0.97; and 0.82, 0.72-0.94, respectively), and 
the treatment benefit was similar (interaction p = 0.615). Bariatric surgery was 
associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in both subgroups 
(adjHR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.46-0.91; and 0.70, 0.55-0.88, respectively (interaction 
p = 0.516)).
CONCLUSIONS: Bariatric surgery is associated with similar reduction of overall 
and cardiovascular mortality and increased life expectancy regardless of 
baseline diabetes status.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is expected to worsen the prognosis of 
inpatients with heart failure (HF) but the evidence from observational studies 
is inconsistent. We aimed to compare mortality outcomes and life expectancy 
among inpatients with HF with or without T2D and explored whether chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) influenced these associations.
METHODS: We collected hospital and civil registry records of consecutive 
inpatients from a tertiary hospital in Switzerland with a diagnosis of HF from 
the year 2015 to 2019. We evaluated the association of T2D with mortality risk 
using Cox regression and adjusted for confounders.
RESULTS: Our final cohort consisted of 10,532 patients with HF of whom 27% had 
T2D. The median age (interquartile range [IQR]) was 75 [68 to 82] and 78 [68 to 
86] for the diabetes and non-diabetes groups, respectively. Over a median 
follow-up [IQR] of 4.5 years [3.3 to 5.6], 5,347 (51%) of patients died. T2D 
patients had higher risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.21, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 1.29). Compared to control (i.e. no T2D nor 
CKD), average life expectancy (95% CI) among T2D patients, CKD, or both was 
shorter by 5.4 months (95% CI 1.1 to 9.7), 9.0 months (95% CI 8.4 to 9.6), or 
14.8 months (95% CI 12.4 to 17.2), respectively. No difference by sex or 
ejection fraction category was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: T2D is associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause 
mortality and shorter life expectancy compared to those without among 
middle-aged and elderly inpatients with HF; presence of CKD may further increase 
these risks.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have quantified the current burden of diseases 
attributable to overweight in Chile. However, no study has estimated the 
attributable burden of overweight in the future. Herein, we estimated the 
potential impact of different trajectories in the prevalence of overweight on 
the incidence and mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Chilean 
adults from 2019 to 2030.
METHODS: A multistate life table modelling was used to estimate the 
business-as-usual (BAU: if the current rate of increase in BMI persist through 
the next 11 years; i.e., 0.4% per year from 2003 to 2017) and three 
counterfactual scenarios (1: the increase rate of overweight is reduced by half; 
2: maintanance of the current prevalence of overweight; 3: the prevalence 
of overweight is reduced by 6.7%) over a 11-year simulation period for burden of 
NCDs attributable to overweight in Chilean adults aged 20 to 80 years. The model 
inputs included nationally representative data of body mass index, national 
official demographic records, NCDs from the Global Burden of Disease study in 
2019, and relative risks from a published meta-analysis.
RESULTS: If the current trends of increase in overweight are maintained in 
Chile, approximately, 669 thousand cases and 117 thousand deaths from NCDs will 
occur from 2020 to 2030. In case the increase rate of overweight is reduced by 
half during this period, around 7 thousand cases and 1.4 thousand deaths from 
NCDs would be prevented, while achieving no increase in the prevalence of 
overweight would avert 10 thousand cases and 2 thousand deaths. In the 
optimistic scenario of reducing the prevalence of overweight by 6.7% until 2030, 
approximately 25 thousand cases and 5 thousand deaths from NCDs would be 
prevented.
CONCLUSION: We estimated that the number of NCDs cases and deaths that could be 
avoided by decreasing the prevalence of overweight in Chilean adults. Preventive 
programs aimed to reduce overweight may have a high impact on the future burden 
of NCDs in Chile.

Even with a reduced burden of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), differences 
remain in the rate of change among countries and sub-regions. We used data from 
the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 to establish the relationship between 
Development Assistance for Health (DAH) and governance and trends in malaria 
burden in SSA. The trend was estimated using the Joinpoint regression program 
and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation's DAH database, and World 
Bank Governance Indicators to analyze the DAH and governance respectively from 
2000 to 2017 and used two-way fixed effects to establish their association with 
the trend in the period. The findings showed decreases in SSA's age-standardised 
rates for disability-adjusted life years (ASDR) (-47% (95% uncertainty interval 
(UI) -69% to -14%)), deaths (-38% (95% UI -65% to -3%)), incidence (-35% (95% UI 
-44% to -25%)), and prevalence (-34% (95% UI -43% to -24%)). Decreases in ASDR 
were associated with increases in DAH (β -134.18, standard error (SE) 27.26) and 
governance scores (β -246.19, SE 39.13). The association between reductions in 
malaria burden and increases in DAH and in governance scores shows the need for 
accelerated funding of malaria programs and advocacy for better disease 
governance in malaria-endemic countries.Abbreviations: APC: Annual percentage

Needs Assessment of Self-Management for Individuals With Chronic Spinal Cord 
Injury/Disease.

Kraus B(1), Wolf TJ(1).

Author information:
(1)University of Missouri-Columbia, USA.

Since the 1980s, survivorship for persons with spinal cord injury/disease 
(SCI/D) has significantly improved; however, life expectancy remains lower than 
the general population due to secondary health conditions (SHCs) that lead to 
decreased function and death. This study explored (1) facilitators and barriers 
to engaging in self-management (SM) for persons with SCI/D and (2) stakeholder 
perspectives on potential SM program components and content for intervention 
development. Around 38 participants with SCI/D responded to this cross-sectional 
study and needs assessment conducted at the University of Missouri, Columbia. 
Responses were analyzed to determine descriptive statistics. Participants 
indicated barriers to SM include transportation/distance, presence of SHCs, and 
a lack of local resources. Participants noted that virtual SM programs with 
strong psychological health/coping components were preferred. These findings 
should guide the development of an SM program tailored to SCI/D to reduce the 
prevalence and impact of SHC on the SCI/D population.

Plain Language Summary: Persons with Spinal Cord Injury/Disease (SCI/D) 
experience secondary health conditions to a higher degree than the general 
population which impacts their function, quality of life, and lifespan. The 
factors that limit or support participation in self-management behaviors and 
programs were explored and we asked people with SCI/D what they would want out 
of a self-management program tailored to their needs. Results showed that 
virtual programs with a both group and individual sessions with a strong mental 
health component were preferred.

Angiogenesis is one of the most essential developmental processes and plays a 
key role in organogenesis and tumorigenesis in which epithelial cells 
proliferate and migrate, thus resulting in sprouting and extension of the 
existing vasculature. The study of angiogenesis in vivo is limited by 
difficulties related to imaging of the fine structure of vascular sprouting 
within non-transparent bulk tissue. Thus, many model systems have been proposed 
in recent years. However, to meet the urgent need for high-throughput studies 
and screening, further improvements are still required, particularly in terms of 
scaling-up. In this study, we combined microchip fabrication with the culture of 
three-dimensional (3D) spheroids, thus providing a platform for 3D multilayer 
angiogenesis-on-a-chip. Using this platform, we investigated the precise effects 
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on angiogenesis. In comparison with 
two-dimensional (2D) angiogenesis assays, our 3D angiogenesis platform 
demonstrated superior sprouting and provided proof of concept that our 3D 
biomimetic angiogenesis-on-a-chip could serve as a powerful tool for pro- or 
anti-angiogenesis candidate drug screening.

PURPOSE: Tumor genomic profiling and PD-L1 testing mean lung cancer management 
can be tackled through a personalized approach. Targeted therapies and 
immunotherapy are necessary to improve survival and preserve the patients' 
quality of life. Early access to innovation before marketing authorization (MA) 
is possible in France through clinical trials and an early-access program called 
a Temporary Authorization for Use (ATU), which is a unique regulatory system in 
Europe. This study aims to assess the impact of early access to innovation 
through clinical trials and ATUs in thoracic oncology.
METHODS: Data from clinical trials between 2018 and 2021 and ATUs between 2005 
and 2019 were collected internally and assessed for drugs in thoracic oncology, 
with specific focus on 2 ATUs, respectively, atezolizumab and durvalumab.
RESULTS: From 2018 to 2021, the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and 
Health Products authorized 145 clinical trials in lung cancer. Between 2005 and 
2019, 19 drugs obtained an EU MA or an MA extension for a therapeutic indication 
in lung cancer. During this period, 11 of these drugs were granted an ATU, 
corresponding to 6851 patients treated. Of this total number of patients, data 
were collected for 33.1% and 71.2%, who received durvalumab and atezolizumab, 
respectively. Real-life efficacy data were consistent with the clinical trial 
data.
CONCLUSION: Over the past 15 years, clinical trials and the French early access 
program have allowed considerable early access to therapeutic innovation in real 
life for patients, especially in thoracic oncology.
