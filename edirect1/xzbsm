BACKGROUND: Setting priorities is important in health research given the limited 
resources available for research. Various guidelines exist to assist in the 
priority setting process; however, priority setting still faces significant 
challenges such as the clear ranking of identified priorities. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) proposed a Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY)-based model 
to rank priorities by research area (basic, health systems and biomedical) by 
dividing the DALYs into 'unavertable with existing interventions', 'avertable 
with improved efficiency' and 'avertable with existing but non-cost-effective 
interventions', respectively. However, the model has conceptual flaws and no 
clear methodology for its construction. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to 
amend the model to address these flaws, and develop a clear methodology by using 
tuberculosis in South Africa as a worked example.
METHODS: An amended model was constructed to represent total DALYs as the 
product of DALYs per person and absolute burden of disease. These figures were 
calculated for all countries from WHO datasets. The lowest figures achieved by 
any country were assumed to represent 'unavertable with existing interventions' 
if extrapolated to South Africa. The ratio of 'cost per patient treated' 
(adjusted for purchasing power and outcome weighted) between South Africa and 
the best country was used to calculate the 'avertable with improved efficiency 
section'. Finally, 'avertable with existing but non-cost-effective 
interventions' was calculated using Disease Control Priorities Project efficacy 
data, and the ratio between the best intervention and South Africa's current 
intervention, irrespective of cost.
RESULTS: The amended model shows that South Africa has a tuberculosis burden of 
1,009,837.3 DALYs; 0.009% of DALYs are unavertable with existing interventions 
and 96.3% of DALYs could be averted with improvements in efficiency. Of the 
remaining DALYs, a further 56.9% could be averted with existing but 
non-cost-effective interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: The amended model was successfully constructed using limited data 
sources. The generalizability of the data used is the main limitation of the 
model. More complex formulas are required to deal with such potential 
confounding variables; however, the results act as starting point for 
development of a more robust model.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this project was to identify metabolites, proteins, 
genes, and promoters associated with water stress responses in soybean. A number 
of these may serve as new targets for the biotechnological improvement of 
drought responses in soybean (Glycine max).
RESULTS: We identified metabolites, proteins, and genes that are strongly up or 
down regulated during rapid water stress following removal from a hydroponics 
system. 163 metabolites showed significant changes during water stress in roots 
and 93 in leaves. The largest change was a root-specific 160-fold increase in 
the coumestan coumestrol making it a potential biomarker for drought and a 
promising target for improving drought responses. Previous reports suggest that 
coumestrol stimulates mycorrhizal colonization and under certain conditions 
mycorrhizal plants have improved drought tolerance. This suggests that 
coumestrol may be part of a call for help to the rhizobiome during stress. About 
3,000 genes were strongly up-regulated by drought and we identified regulators 
such as ERF, MYB, NAC, bHLH, and WRKY transcription factors, receptor-like 
kinases, and calcium signaling components as potential targets for soybean 
improvement as well as the jasmonate and abscisic acid biosynthetic genes JMT, 
LOX1, and ABA1. Drought stressed soybean leaves show reduced mRNA levels of 
stomatal development genes including FAMA-like, MUTE-like and SPEECHLESS-like 
bHLH transcription factors and leaves formed after drought stress had a 
reduction in stomatal density of 22.34 % and stomatal index of 17.56 %. This 
suggests that reducing stomatal density may improve drought tolerance. MEME 
analyses suggest that ABRE (CACGT/CG), CRT/DRE (CCGAC) and a novel GTGCnTGC/G 
element play roles in transcriptional activation and these could form components 
of synthetic promoters to drive expression of transgenes. Using transformed 
hairy roots, we validated the increase in promoter activity of GmWRKY17 and 
GmWRKY67 during dehydration and after 20 μM ABA treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our toolbox provides new targets and strategies for improving 
soybean drought tolerance and includes the coumestan coumestrol, transcription 
factors that regulate stomatal density, water stress-responsive WRKY gene 
promoters and a novel DNA element that appears to be enriched in water stress 
responsive promoters.

BACKGROUND: The population of Fiji has experienced emergence of non-communicable 
disease (NCD) and a plateau in life expectancy over the past 20 years.
METHODS: A mini-STEPS survey (n = 2765) was conducted in Viseisei in Western 
Fiji to assess NCD risk factors (RFs) in i-Taukei (Melanesians) and those of 
Indian descent aged 25-64 years (response 73 %). Hypertension (HT) was defined 
as systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg or on 
medication for HT; type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as fasting plasma glucose 
≥7.0 mmol/L or on medication for T2DM; and obesity as a body mass index 
(kilograms/height(metres)(2)) ≥30. Data were age-adjusted to 2007 Fiji Census. 
Associations between RFs and ethnicity/education were investigated. Comparisons 
with Fiji STEPS surveys were undertaken, and the absolute risk of a 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) event/death in 10 years was estimated from multiple 
RF charts.
RESULTS: NCD/RFs increased with age except excessive alcohol intake and daily 
smoking (women) which declined. Daily smoking was higher in men 33 % (95 % 
confidence interval: 31-36) than women 14 % (12-116); women were more obese 40 % 
(37-43) than men 23 % (20-26); HT was similar in men 37 % (34-40) and women 34 % 
(31-36), as was T2DM in men 15 % (13-17) and women 17 % (15-19). i-Taukei men 
had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.41 (0.28-0.58) for T2DM compared to Indians (1.00); 
and i-Taukei (both sexes) had a higher OR for obesity and low fruit/vegetable 
intake, daily smoking, excessive alcohol intake and HT in females. Increasing 
education correlated with lesser smoking, but with higher obesity and lower 
fruit/vegetable intake. Compared to the 2011 Fiji STEPS survey, no significant 
differences were evident in obesity, HT or T2DM prevalences. The proportion 
(40-64 years) classified at high or very high risk (≥20 %) of a CVD event/death 
(over 10 years) based on multiple RFs was 8.3 % for men (8.1 % i-Taukei, 8.5 % 
Indian), and 6.7 % for women (7.9 % i-Taukei, 6.0 % Indian).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the survey highlight the need for individual and 
community interventions to address the high levels of NCD/RFs. Evaluation of 
interventions is needed in order to inform NCD control policies in Fiji and 
other Pacific Island nations.

The life expectancy of thalassemic patients has increased, and now approaches 
that of healthy individuals, thanks to improved treatment regimens. However, 
pregnancy in women with β-Thalassemia Μajor remains a challenging condition. 
Recent advances in managing this haemoglobinopathy offer the potential for safe 
pregnancies with favorable outcome. However, clinical data regarding the use of 
chelation therapy during pregnancy are limited, and it is unclear whether these 
agents impose any risk to the developing fetus. Successful pregnancies following 
unintentional treatment with deferoxamine or deferasirox have rarely been 
reported. Generally, chelators are not recommended during pregnancy. Regarding 
the new oral chelators, data on fetotoxicity are lacking. In the present study, 
we describe the evolution and successful outcome of nine pregnancies in six 
Greek thalassemic women who received deferasirox inadvertently during early 
pregnancy, and review the literature regarding fetal anomalies due to chelators. 
Use of chelation before embarking upon a non-programmed pregnancy remains a 
difficult and unresolved question. In our study, chelation treatment during 
pregnancy did not prevent the delivery of healthy children. Nonetheless, the use 
of deferasirox is contraindicated in pregnant women, based on the product label. 
Deferasirox should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit 
outweighs the potential fetal risk.

BACKGROUND: Previous epidemiological studies of dairy product consumption and 
health outcomes have reported mixed findings. Despite increasing in life 
expectancy, scarce data are available in this field in elderly individuals. We 
tested the hypothesis that greater dairy intake is associated with lower high 
sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level and better lipid profile and 
glycemic control.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was undertaken on 107 elderly individuals 
who aged 60-78 years. Usual dietary intakes were assessed by means of a 
validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Anthropometric measures and 
biochemical markers were determined using standard protocols.
RESULTS: The reported mean ± standard deviation (SD) of daily intake of dairy 
products and age were 588.02 ± 418.88 g/d and 63.22 ± 6.92 years, respectively. 
After control for demographic characteristics and dietary intakes, dairy 
consumption was not significantly related to the increased risk of insulin 
resistance [Odds ratio (OR): 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.54, 8.86; P = 
0.520] and elevated hs-CRP (OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 0.37, 6.35; P = 0.550). 
Participants in the top tertile of dairy had greater, but statistically not a 
significant risk of elevated triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol and 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). No significant relations were seen 
for hs-CRP, insulin resistance and lipid profile across tertiles of dairy 
products.
CONCLUSION: In this elderly population, total dairy consumption was not 
associated with inflammatory biomarkers levels and other cardiometabolic risk 
factors.

Malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is a common condition that results 
from locally advanced malignancies in the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as 
pancreatic, gastric, and other carcinomas. Two types of procedures for malignant 
GOO, namely, gastrojejunostomy (GJ) with laparotomy or a laparoscopic approach 
and endoscopic stenting (ES), are currently available. Although numerous 
previous reports have clarified the benefits and drawbacks of each procedure, 
whether GJ or ES should be used in patients with GOO that results from gastric 
cancer who may have a longer life expectancy than patients with other 
malignancies has not been determined. In this review, which focuses on gastric 
cancer-induced GOO, we analyzed the two systematic reviews and a meta-analysis 
that compared GJ and ES and outlined the current status of GOO treatment. We 
also provide an updated review that includes laparoscopic GJ. Various data from 
13 studies in one review and 6 studies in another review were analyzed. Although 
the main results of the present review indicated that both GJ and ES were 
efficacious treatments in patients with GOO that resulted from gastric cancer, 
current evidence suggests that GJ may be the preferable procedure given its good 
performance status and improved prognosis in gastric cancer patients.

Surgical Sciences for Mothers, Children and Adults, University of Modena and

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening genetic disorder characterized 
by chronic hemolytic anemia, vascular injury and multiorgan dysfunctions. Over 
the last few decades, there have been significant improvements in SCD management 
in Western countries, especially in pediatric population. An early onset of 
prophylaxis with Penicillin and a proper treatment of the infections have 
increased the overall survival in childhood. Nevertheless, management of painful 
episodes and prevention of organ damage are still challenging and more efforts 
are needed to better understand the mechanisms behind the development of chronic 
organ damages. Hydroxyurea (Hydroxycarbamide, HU), the only medication approved 
as a disease-modifying agent by the United States Food and Drug Administration 
and the European Medicines Agency, is usually under-used, especially in 
developing countries. Currently, hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is 
considered the only curative option, although its use is limited by lack of 
donors and transplant-related toxicity. SCD symptoms are similar in children and 
adults, but complications and systemic organ damages increase with age, leading 
to early mortality worldwide. Experts in comprehensive care of young patients 
with SCD, especially those approaching the transition age to adulthood, are 
missing, leading people to rely on urgent care, increasing health care 
utilization costs and inappropriate treatments. It would be important to 
establish programs of comprehensive healthcare for patients with SCD from birth 
to adulthood, to improve their quality and expectancy of life.

BACKGROUND: Surgical interventions are being increasingly recognized as 
cost-effective global priorities, the utility of which are frequently measured 
using either quality-adjusted (QALY) or disability-adjusted (DALY) life years. 
The objectives of this study were to: (1) identify surgical cost-effectiveness 
studies that utilized a formulation of the QALY or DALY as a summary measure, 
(2) report on global patterns of QALY and DALY use in surgery and the income 
characteristics of the countries and/or regions involved, and (3) assess for 
possible associations between national/regional-income levels and the relative 
prominence of either measure.
STUDY DESIGN: PRISMA-guided systematic review of surgical cost-effectiveness 
studies indexed in PubMed or EMBASE prior to December 15, 2014, that used the 
DALY and/or QALY as a summary measure. National locations were used to classify 
publications based on the 2014 World Bank income stratification scheme into: 
low-, lower-middle-, upper-middle-, or high-income countries. Differences in 
QALY/DALY use were considered by income level as well as for differences in 
geographic location and year using descriptive statistics (two-sided Chi-squared 
tests, Fischer's exact tests in cell counts <5).
RESULTS: A total of 540 publications from 128 countries met inclusion criteria, 
representing 825 "national studies" (regional publications included data from 
multiple countries). Data for 69.0% (569/825) were reported using QALYs (2.1% 
low-, 1.2% lower-middle-, 4.4% upper-middle-, and 92.3% high-income countries), 
compared to 31.0% (256/825) reported using DALYs (46.9% low-, 31.6% 
lower-middle-, 16.8% upper-middle-, and 4.7% high-income countries) (p<0.001). 
Studies from the US and the UK dominated the total number of QALY studies 
(49.9%) and were themselves almost exclusively QALY-based. DALY use, in 
contrast, was the most common in Africa and Asia. While prominent published use 
of QALYs (1990s) in surgical cost-effectiveness studies began approximately 10 
years earlier than DALYs (2000s), the use of both measures continues to 
increase.
CONCLUSION: As global prioritization of surgical interventions gains prominence, 
it will be important to consider the comparative implications of summary measure 
use. The results of this study demonstrate significant income- and 
geographic-based differences in the preferential utilization of the QALY and 
DALY for surgical cost-effectiveness studies. Such regional variation holds 
important implications for efforts to interpret and utilize global health policy 
research. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42015015991.

Transferring Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to water is known to extend their 
lifespan. However, it is unclear whether this lifespan extension is due to 
slowing the aging process or merely keeping old yeast alive. Here we show that 
in water-transferred yeast, the toxicity of polyQ proteins is decreased and the 
aging biomarker 47Q aggregates at a reduced rate and to a lesser extent. These 
beneficial effects of water-transfer could not be reproduced by diluting the 
growth medium and depended on de novo protein synthesis and proteasomes levels. 
Interestingly, we found that upon water-transfer 27 proteins are downregulated, 
4 proteins are upregulated and 81 proteins change their intracellular 
localization, hinting at an active genetic program enabling the lifespan 
extension. Furthermore, the aging-related deterioration of the heat shock 
response (HSR), the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the endoplasmic 
reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD), was largely prevented in 
water-transferred yeast, as the activities of these proteostatic network 
pathways remained nearly as robust as in young yeast. The characteristics of 
young yeast that are actively maintained upon water-transfer indicate that the 
extended lifespan is the outcome of slowing the rate of the aging process.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia is expected to soar as the average life 
expectancy increases, but recent estimates suggest that the age-specific 
incidence of dementia is declining in high-income countries. Temporal trends are 
best derived through continuous monitoring of a population over a long period 
with the use of consistent diagnostic criteria. We describe temporal trends in 
the incidence of dementia over three decades among participants in the 
Framingham Heart Study.
METHODS: Participants in the Framingham Heart Study have been under surveillance 
for incident dementia since 1975. In this analysis, which included 5205 persons 
60 years of age or older, we used Cox proportional-hazards models adjusted for 
age and sex to determine the 5-year incidence of dementia during each of four 
epochs. We also explored the interactions between epoch and age, sex, 
apolipoprotein E ε4 status, and educational level, and we examined the effects 
of these interactions, as well as the effects of vascular risk factors and 
cardiovascular disease, on temporal trends.
RESULTS: The 5-year age- and sex-adjusted cumulative hazard rates for dementia 
were 3.6 per 100 persons during the first epoch (late 1970s and early 1980s), 
2.8 per 100 persons during the second epoch (late 1980s and early 1990s), 2.2 
per 100 persons during the third epoch (late 1990s and early 2000s), and 2.0 per 
100 persons during the fourth epoch (late 2000s and early 2010s). Relative to 
the incidence during the first epoch, the incidence declined by 22%, 38%, and 
44% during the second, third, and fourth epochs, respectively. This risk 
reduction was observed only among persons who had at least a high school diploma 
(hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.88). The prevalence of 
most vascular risk factors (except obesity and diabetes) and the risk of 
dementia associated with stroke, atrial fibrillation, or heart failure have 
decreased over time, but none of these trends completely explain the decrease in 
the incidence of dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Among participants in the Framingham Heart Study, the incidence of 
dementia has declined over the course of three decades. The factors contributing 
to this decline have not been completely identified. (Funded by the National 
Institutes of Health.).

This study examined whether expectancy of ergogenicity of a commonly used 
nutritional supplement (sodium bicarbonate; NaHCO3) influenced subsequent 
high-intensity cycling capacity. Eight recreationally active males (age, 21 ± 1 
years; body mass, 75 ± 8 kg; height, 178 ± 4 cm; WPEAK = 205 ± 22 W) performed a 
graded incremental test to assess peak power output (WPEAK), one familiarisation 
trial and two experimental trials. Experimental trials consisted of cycling at 
100% WPEAK to volitional exhaustion (TLIM) 60 min after ingesting either a 
placebo (PLA: 0.1 g·kg(-1) sodium chloride (NaCl), 4 mL·kg(-1) tap water, and 1 
mL·kg(-1) squash) or a sham placebo (SHAM: 0.1 g·kg(-1) NaCl, 4 mL·kg(-1) 
carbonated water, and 1 mL·kg(-1) squash). SHAM aimed to replicate the 
previously reported symptoms of gut fullness (GF) and abdominal discomfort (AD) 
associated with NaHCO3 ingestion. Treatments were administered double blind and 
accompanied by written scripts designed to remain neutral (PLA) or induce 
expectancy of ergogenicity (SHAM). After SHAM mean TLIM increased by 9.5% 
compared to PLA (461 ± 148 s versus 421 ± 150 s; P = 0.048, d = 0.3). Ratings of 
GF and AD were mild but ~1 unit higher post-ingestion for SHAM. After 3 min TLIM 
overall ratings of perceived exertion were 1.4 ± 1.3 units lower for SHAM 
compared to PLA (P = 0.020, d = 0.6). There were no differences between 
treatments for blood lactate, blood glucose, or heart rate. In summary, 
ergogenicity after NaHCO3 ingestion may be influenced by expectancy, which 
mediates perception of effort during subsequent exercise. The observed 
ergogenicity with SHAM did not affect our measures of cardiorespiratory 
physiology or metabolic flux.

Overexpression of the CYP51A1 Gene and Repeated Elements are Associated with 
Differential Sensitivity to DMI Fungicides in Venturia inaequalis.

The involvement of overexpression of the CYP51A1 gene in Venturia inaequalis was 
investigated for isolates exhibiting differential sensitivity to the triazole 
demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides myclobutanil and difenoconazole. 
Relative expression (RE) of the CYP51A1 gene was significantly greater (P < 
0.0001) for isolates with resistance to both fungicides (MRDR phenotype) or with 
resistance to difenoconazole only (MSDR phenotype) compared with isolates that 
were resistant only to myclobutanil (MRDS phenotype) or sensitive to both 
fungicides (MSDS phenotype). An average of 9- and 13-fold increases in CYP51A1 
RE were observed in isolates resistant to difenoconazole compared with isolates 
with MRDS and MSDS phenotypes, respectively. Linear regression analysis between 
isolate relative growth on myclobutanil-amended medium and log10 RE revealed 
that little to no variability in sensitivity to myclobutanil could be explained 
by CYP51A1 overexpression (R(2) = 0.078). To investigate CYP51A1 upstream 
anomalies associated with CYP51A1 overexpression or resistance to 
difenoconazole, Illumina sequencing was conducted for three isolates with 
resistance to difenoconazole and one baseline isolate. A repeated element, "EL 
3,1,2", with the properties of a transcriptional enhancer was identified two to 
four times upstream of CYP51A1 in difenoconazole-resistant isolates but was not 
found in isolates with the MRDS phenotype. These results suggest that different 
mechanisms may govern resistance to different DMI fungicides in the triazole 
group.

OBJECTIVES: Life expectancy in the USA reached a record high of 78.7 years in 
2010. However, the racial gap in life expectancy persists. National data, which 
are readily available, provide averages which mask important local-level 
differences. Local data are needed to identify the worst off groups, key to 
reducing disparities and pursuing health equity.
METHODS: Using vital records data, we calculated life expectancy for the USA and 
Chicago by race/ethnicity and gender and for Chicago's 77 community areas. We 
also examined the correlation between life expectancy and (1) racial/ethnic 
composition of a community area and (2) median household income.
RESULTS: In Chicago, the highest life expectancy was observed among Hispanics at 
84.6 and the lowest life expectancy was observed among Blacks at 71.7-a 
difference of about 13 years. Life expectancy varied substantially across the 77 
community areas of Chicago, from a low of 68.2 to a high of 83.3-a difference of 
15 years. There were strong correlations between life expectancy and the racial, 
ethnic, and socioeconomic distributions among the community areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The examination of data at the local level provides invaluable 
insight into which communities are facing the greatest burden in terms of health 
and well-being. It is only through the examination of local-level data that we 
can understand the unique needs of these communities and begin to address them.

[Monitoring the nutritional status of the residents of St. Petersburg].

[Article in Russian]

Dotsenko VA, Kononenko IA, Mosiychuk L, Dolotov SA, Khoritonenko OV.

The purpose of the study was to analyze the diet of the population of St. 
Petersburg from different social and age groups and justify 
organizational-methodological ways to improve it. 1200 inhabitants 18 years old 
and over (674 women, 526 men) were interviewed using questionnaires. One-third 
of St. Petersburg population did not adhere to the recommended 3-4 meals per 
day, taking meal 2 times per day or less (21.7%) or 5 times per day or more 
(11.3%). The young (18-29 years old) and socially active residents 1.5-2fold 
more likely than pensioners (13.8%) fed 2 times per day. Women 2.2 fold more 
frequently than men fed 5 times per day. Young people (20%) and socially active 
persons (24.4%) prefer not to have breakfast or take it 2-3 times per week 
compared with 9.6% pensioners. Supper as the main mealtimes called 27.8% women, 
that is 1.4 fold more likely than men. Thus, a great part of the population in 
the young and socially active adulthood violates proper diet, and women more 
often as compared to men. This can lead to disruption of the metabolic 
processes, increasing the risk of nutrition-related diseases, a decrease of 
efficiency and reduced life expectancy. This raises the feasibility of 
establishing of healthy eating offices based on health centers or clinics in St. 
Petersburg.

Review of Various Herbal Supplements as Complementary Treatments for Oral 
Cancer.

Florida , Gainesville , Florida , USA.

In the United States, nearly 44,000 people are diagnosed with oral or pharyngeal 
cancer annually. The life expectancy for those who are diagnosed have a survival 
rate of 57% after five years. Among them, oral cancer can be classified as 
benign or malignant tumors and is diagnosed at several stages in the 
development: premalignant conditions, premalignant lesions, and malignant 
cancer. The early signs of oral cancer often go unnoticed by the individual and 
are often discovered during routine dental examinations. Early detection and 
treatment may help to increase patient survival rates. The most widely used 
treatments for oral cancer include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy-alone or 
in combination. Preclinical and clinical evidence for the use of green tea, 
raspberry, asparagus, and cannabis extracts is discussed in this review. Diet 
changes, supplementation with antioxidants, high-dose vitamin C therapy, and 
cannabinoid use have been suggested to decrease cancer cell replication and 
increase chance of remission. Early detection and lifestyle changes, including 
the use of dietary supplements in at-risk populations, are critical steps in 
preventing and successfully treating oral cancer. The main evidence for 
supplement use is currently in cancer prevention rather than treatment. Further 
research, determination, and mechanism of action for bioactive compounds such as 
epigallocatechin, epicatechin-3-gallate, and Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate, 
through in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials need to be completed to support 
the use of natural products and their effectiveness in preventative care and 
supporting therapeutic approaches.

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) causes premature death and loss of 
life expectancy worldwide. Its primary and secondary prevention can result in a 
significant number of years of life saved.
AIM: To assess how many years of life are lost after HCC diagnosis.
METHODS: Data from 5346 patients with first HCC diagnosis were used to estimate 
lifespan and number of years of life lost after tumour onset, using a 
semi-parametric extrapolation having as reference an age-, sex- and 
year-of-onset-matched population derived from national life tables.
RESULTS: Between 1986 and 2014, HCC lead to an average of 11.5 years-of-life 
lost for each patient. The youngest age-quartile group (18-61 years) had the 
highest number of years-of-life lost, representing approximately 41% of the 
overall benefit obtainable from prevention. Advancements in HCC management have 
progressively reduced the number of years-of-life lost from 12.6 years in 
1986-1999, to 10.7 in 2000-2006 and 7.4 years in 2007-2014. Currently, an HCC 
diagnosis when a single tumour <2 cm results in 3.7 years-of-life lost while the 
diagnosis when a single tumour ≥ 2 cm or 2/3 nodules still within the Milan 
criteria, results in 5.0 years-of-life lost, representing the loss of only 
approximately 5.5% and 7.2%, respectively, of the entire lifespan from birth.
CONCLUSIONS: Hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence results in the loss of a 
considerable number of years-of-life, especially for younger patients. In recent 
years, the increased possibility of effectively treating this tumour has 
improved life expectancy, thus reducing years-of-life lost.

BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty is an effective treatment when nonsurgical 
treatments fail, but it is associated with risk of complications which may be 
increased in advanced age. The purpose of this study was to quantify age-related 
differences in perioperative morbidity and mortality after total knee 
arthroplasty through systematic review of existing literature.
METHODS: PubMed, the Cochrane database of systematic reviews, Scopus, and 
clinicaltrials.gov, were queried for relevant studies that compared primary 
total knee arthroplasty outcomes of mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), deep 
vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) and functional status, of 
geriatric patients (>75 years old) with a younger control group (<65 years old). 
Pertinent journals and reference lists were hand searched. Eligibility criteria 
included all articles except case reports, meta-analyses, and systematic 
reviews. Two authors independently extracted data from each paper. Article 
quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included. Geriatric patients had higher rates 
of mortality, MI, DVT, and length of stay in older compared to younger patients, 
however the absolute magnitude of these increases were small. The increase in 
mortality may have reflected decreased life expectancy in the geriatric 
populations as opposed to mortality specifically due perioperative risk. There 
were no differences in PE incidence and improvement in pain and functional 
status was equal in older and younger patients. Existing studies were limited by 
non-randomized patient selection, as well as variation in definitions and 
methodology.
CONCLUSIONS: Existing data supports offering primary total knee arthroplasty to 
select geriatric patients, although the risk of complications may be increased. 
Much of the data was of poor quality. Future prospective studies are needed to 
better identify risks and benefits of total knee arthroplasty so that patients 
and surgeons can make informed decisions.

Homeostasis is known to be involved in maintaining the optimal internal 
environment, helping to achieve the best performance of biological functions. At 
the same time, a deviation from optimal conditions often attenuates the 
performance of biological functions, and such restricted performance could be 
considered as individual fatigue, including physical and mental fatigue. The 
present study seeks to develop an animal model of chronic or subacute fatigue in 
which the recovery time is extended through the gradual disruption of 
homeostasis. We show that repeated short-term rest periods with certain lengths 
of sleep during continuous fatigue loading extend recovery from spontaneous 
nighttime activity but not physical performance in comparison with a continuous 
fatigue-loading procedure. Furthermore, the immobility time in a forced swimming 
test was extended by repeated short-term rests. These results suggest that 
repeated short-term rest with certain lengths of sleep during continuous fatigue 
loading is able to extend the recovery from mental fatigue but not from physical 
fatigue and that this effect might occur via the disruption of a homeostatic 
mechanism that is involved in restoring the optimal internal environment.

OBJECTIVES: To use electronic health records (EHR) to predict lifetime costs and 
health outcomes of patients with stable coronary artery disease (stable-CAD) 
stratified by their risk of future cardiovascular events, and to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of treatments targeted at these populations.
METHODS: The analysis was based on 94 966 patients with stable-CAD in England 
between 2001 and 2010, identified in four prospectively collected, linked EHR 
sources. Markov modelling was used to estimate lifetime costs and 
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) stratified by baseline cardiovascular risk.
RESULTS: For the lowest risk tenth of patients with stable-CAD, predicted 
discounted remaining lifetime healthcare costs and QALYs were £62 210 (95% CI 
£33 724 to £90 043) and 12.0 (95% CI 11.5 to 12.5) years, respectively. For the 
highest risk tenth of the population, the equivalent costs and QALYs were 
£35 549 (95% CI £31 679 to £39 615) and 2.9 (95% CI 2.6 to 3.1) years, 
respectively. A new treatment with a hazard reduction of 20% for myocardial 
infarction, stroke and cardiovascular disease death and no side-effects would be 
cost-effective if priced below £72 per year for the lowest risk patients and 
£646 per year for the highest risk patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Existing EHRs may be used to estimate lifetime healthcare costs and 
outcomes of patients with stable-CAD. The stable-CAD model developed in this 
study lends itself to informing decisions about commissioning, pricing and 
reimbursement. At current prices, to be cost-effective some established as well 
as future stable-CAD treatments may require stratification by patient risk.
