PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Given the enormous impact congenital heart disease has on 
child health, it is imperative that we improve our understanding of the disease 
mechanisms that underlie patient phenotypes and clinical outcomes. This review 
will outline the merits of using the frog model, Xenopus, as a tool to study 
human cardiac development and left-right patterning mechanisms associated with 
congenital heart disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: Patient-driven gene discovery continues to provide new insight 
into the mechanisms of congenital heart disease, and by extension, patient 
phenotypes and outcomes. By identifying gene variants in CHD patients, studies 
in Xenopus have elucidated the molecular mechanisms of how these candidate genes 
affect cardiac development, both cardiogenesis as well as left-right patterning, 
which can have a major impact on cardiac morphogenesis. Xenopus has also proved 
to be a useful screening tool for the biological relevance of identified 
patient-mutations, and ongoing investigations continue to illuminate disease 
mechanisms.
SUMMARY: Analyses in model organisms can help to elucidate the disease 
mechanisms underlying CHD patient phenotypes. Using Xenopus to disentangle the 
genotype-phenotype relationships of well-known and novel disease genes could 
enhance the ability of physicians to efficaciously treat patients and predict 
clinical outcomes, ultimately improving quality of life and survival rates of 
patients born with congenital heart disease.

BACKGROUND: Recovery expectations can influence outcomes after injury, but 
little is known about the course of expectations over time or factors predicting 
changes in expectations. This study aimed to describe how expectations of 
persistent pain change over time following a non-catastrophic injury sustained 
in a road traffic crash (RTC); identify the early predictors of change in 
expectations over time; and examine whether change in expectations predicted 
pain at 24 months post-RTC.
METHODS: One hundred and seventy-seven participants (Mage = 49.25; SD = 14.15; 
66.1% female) reported their expectations of persistent pain (1 = no risk that 
pain will become persistent, 10 = highest risk) at approximately 6, 12 and 
24 months post-injury via survey. Measures of pain, emotional distress, 
post-traumatic stress, fear avoidance beliefs, social support and quality of 
life were also measured via survey at each time point.
RESULTS: Cluster analysis revealed four clusters: 42% of participants showed a 
pattern of stable expectations (stable high-risk, n = 74), whereas 58% of 
participants showed changes in expectations over time (decreasing risk, n = 31; 
increasing risk, n = 44; risk peaking at 12 months, n = 28). Hierarchical linear 
regression models demonstrated that the clusters were a better statistical 
predictor of pain at 24 months than a single measure of expectation taken at 
6 months post-injury. Pain, anxiety, depression and physical health-related 
quality of life at 6 months were associated with cluster affiliation.
CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of patterns of pain expectancy change is a superior 
means of determining long-term pain levels. Understanding expectancy change 
patterns will help provide more nuanced targets for pain intervention.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study extends previous work by investigating persistent pain 
expectancies over time in a compensation-seeking cohort with non-catastrophic 
injuries. It identifies factors that are associated with changing expectations, 
providing targets for clinical intervention. The study shows that expectations 
can change over time. Conversations with patients about their expectations 
should be ongoing.

BACKGROUND: Hispanic patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have decreased life 
expectancy compared to non-Hispanic white patients. Pulmonary function is a main 
predictor of life expectancy in CF. Ethnic differences in pulmonary function in 
CF have been understudied. The objective was to compare longitudinal pulmonary 
function between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients with CF.
METHODS: This cohort study of 15 018 6-25 years old patients in the CF 
Foundation Patient Registry from 2008 to 2013 compared FEV1 percent predicted 
and longitudinal change in FEV1 percent predicted in Hispanic to non-Hispanic 
white patients. We used linear mixed effects models with patient-specific slopes 
and intercepts, adjusting for 14 demographic and clinical variables. We did 
sub-analyses by CFTR class, F508del copies, and PERT use.
RESULTS: Hispanic patients had lower FEV1 percent predicted (79.9%) compared 
with non-Hispanic white patients (85.6%); (-5.8%, 95%CI -6.7% to -4.8%, 
P < 0.001), however, there was no difference in FEV1 decline over time. Patients 
on PERT had a larger difference between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients 
in FEV1 percent predicted than patients not on PERT (-6.0% vs -4.1%, P = 0.02). 
The ethnic difference in FEV1 percent predicted was not statistically 
significant between CFTR classes (Class I-III: -6.1%, Class IV-V: -5.9%, 
Unclassified: -5.7%, P > 0.05) or between F508del copies (None: -7.6%, 
Heterozygotes: -5.6%, Homozygotes: -5.3%, P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in pulmonary function exist in Hispanic patients with 
CF early in life and then persist without improving or worsening over time. It 
is valuable to investigate the factors contributing to pulmonary function in 
Hispanic patients with CF.

BACKGROUND: Docetaxel, pemetrexed, erlotinib, and gefitinib are recommended as 
second-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with 
wild-type or unknown status for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). 
However, the number of published randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on this topic 
is increasing. Our objective was to assess the comparative effectiveness and 
tolerability of all second-line treatments for advanced NSCLC with wild-type or 
unknown status for EGFR by a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the US Food and Drug 
Administration website, as well as other sources, were searched for available 
reports up to June 6, 2017. Two reviewers independently selected published and 
unpublished reports of RCTs comparing any second-line treatments, extracted data 
and assessed the risk of bias of all included trials. We performed a Bayesian 
network meta-analysis. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes included objective response 
(ObR), the number of serious adverse events, and quality of life.
RESULTS: We included 102 RCTs involving 36,058 patients (62% male, median age 
61 years, 81% with stage IV cancer, 80% smokers, and 92% with performance status 
0-1). We revealed a differential reporting of outcomes between efficacy and 
safety outcomes. Half of the trials reported safety outcomes and less than 20% 
quality of life. For OS, nivolumab was more effective than docetaxel (hazard 
ratio (HR) 0.69, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.56-0.83), pemetrexed (0.67, 
0.52-0.83), erlotinib (0.68, 0.53-0.86), and gefitinib (0.66, 0.53-0.83). 
Pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and pemetrexed plus erlotinib were also 
significantly more effective than docetaxel, pemetrexed, erlotinib, and 
gefitinib. For PFS, erlotinib plus cabozantinib was more effective than 
docetaxel (HR 0.39, 95% CrI 0.18-0.84), pemetrexed (0.38, 0.18-0.82), erlotinib 
(0.37, 0.18-0.78), and gefitinib (0.38, 0.18-0.82). Cabozantinib and pemetrexed 
plus erlotinib were also significantly more effective than the four recommended 
treatments. For ObR, no treatment was significantly more effective. The 
effectiveness of the four recommended treatments was similar and they were 
ranked among the 25 less-effective treatments. For safety, evidence is 
insufficient to draw certain conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and pemetrexed plus 
erlotinib may be the most effective second-line treatments for NSCLC in terms of 
OS. The four recommended treatments seem to have relatively poor performance. 
However, the impact on life expectancy of immunotherapy versus other treatments 
should be further explored by future analyses, and more trials comparing the 
novel treatments are needed to reduce uncertainty in these results.

Immunization has become a vital part of public health and disease prevention, 
and yet, it remains a controversial topic in our society today. Diseases that 
were once responsible for significant morbidity and mortality have now become 
all but eradicated, thanks to the introduction of vaccines. Immunization has 
contributed to increased life expectancy and improved quality of life. The first 
vaccine is credited to Edward Jenner, who in 1796 inoculated a 13-year-old boy 
with the virus responsible for cowpox, and he demonstrated immunity to smallpox. 
The first smallpox vaccine was created in 1798 using that premise. Over the 
following centuries, and leading up to the present day, vaccine technology has 
improved, and vaccines to many illnesses have been developed. In 1979, global 
eradication of smallpox was achieved thanks to immunization. The World Health 
Organization has made lifelong immunization a priority, including it as a core 
to the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. In fact, in 2012, the World Health 
Assembly adopted the Global Vaccine Action Plan, which aims to prevent millions 
of deaths by 2020 by increasing access to and utilization of vaccines throughout 
all parts of the world. The first milestone this action plan hopes to achieve is 
the worldwide eradication of polio. A vaccine is a pharmacologic compound that 
improves a person's immunity to a particular disease. When a disease-causing 
bacterium or virus invades the human body, the immune system recognizes the 
material as foreign, usually by detecting specific protein portions of the 
invading organism, known as antigens. Vaccines contain a form of the 
disease-causing agent, whether it be a weakened or killed form of the microbe 
itself, an inactivated version of its toxins, or a protein from the surface of 
the microbe. By introducing a form of the agent, the vaccine presents the 
antigen to the immune system, allowing it to recognize the antigen as foreign 
and develop antibodies and memory T-lymphocytes against those antigens. This 
allows a more rapid and robust immune response should the body be exposed to the 
organism in the future. In the absence of vaccination, the first exposure to 
the natural organism may prove fatal before the immune system can mount a 
sufficient immune response.  CDC's guidance for the safe delivery of vaccines 
during the COVID-19 pandemic includes physical distancing and appropriate use of 
personal protective equipment. According to ACIP(Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices), regular immunization is essential during the COVID-19 
pandemic as they prevent disease outbreaks at individual and community levels.

BACKGROUND: The majority of tuberculosis in migrants to Canada occurs due to 
reactivation of latent TB infection. Risk of tuberculosis in those with latent 
tuberculosis infection can be significantly reduced with treatment. Presently, 
only 2.4% of new migrants are flagged for post-landing surveillance, which may 
include latent tuberculosis infection screening; no other migrants receive 
routine latent tuberculosis infection screening. To aid in reducing the 
tuberculosis burden in new migrants to Canada, we determined the 
cost-effectiveness of using different latent tuberculosis infection 
interventions in migrants under post-arrival surveillance and in all new 
migrants.
METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was developed that focused on a 
Canadian permanent resident cohort after arrival in Canada, utilizing a ten-year 
time horizon, healthcare system perspective, and 1.5% discount rate. Latent 
tuberculosis infection interventions were evaluated in the population under 
surveillance (N = 6100) and the total cohort (N = 260,600). In all evaluations, 
six different screening and treatment combinations were compared to the base 
case of tuberculin skin test screening followed by isoniazid treatment only in 
the population under surveillance. Quality adjusted life years, incident 
tuberculosis cases, and costs were recorded for each intervention and 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated in relation to the base 
case.
RESULTS: In the population under surveillance (N = 6100), using an 
interferon-gamma release assay followed by rifampin was dominant compared to the 
base case, preventing 4.90 cases of tuberculosis, a 4.9% reduction, adding 4.0 
quality adjusted life years, and saving $353,013 over the ensuing ten-years. 
Latent tuberculosis infection screening in the total population (N = 260,600) 
was not cost-effective when compared to the base case, however could potentially 
prevent 21.8% of incident tuberculosis cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening new migrants under surveillance with an interferon-gamma 
release assay and treating with rifampin is cost saving, but will not 
significantly impact TB incidence. Universal latent tuberculosis infection 
screening and treatment is cost-prohibitive. Research into using risk factors to 
target screening post-landing may provide alternate solutions.

How Should Discrete Choice Experiments with Duration Choice Sets Be Presented 
for the Valuation of Health States?

BACKGROUND: Discrete Choice Experiments including duration (DCETTO) can be used 
to generate utility values for health states from measures such as EQ-5D-5L. 
However, methodological issues concerning the optimum way to present choice sets 
remain. The aim of the present study was to test a range of task presentation 
approaches designed to support the DCETTO completion process.
METHODS: Four separate presentation approaches were developed to examine 
different task features including dimension level highlighting, and health state 
severity and duration level presentation. Choice sets included 2 EQ-5D-5L states 
paired with 1 of 4 duration levels, and a third "immediate death" option. The 
same design, including 120 choice sets (developed using optimal methods), was 
employed across all approaches. The online survey was administered to a sample 
of the Australian population who completed 20 choice sets across 2 approaches. 
Conditional logit regression was used to assess model consistency, and scale 
parameter testing investigated poolability.
RESULTS: Overall 1,565 respondents completed the survey. Three approaches, using 
different dimension level highlighting techniques, produced mainly monotonic 
coefficients that resulted in a larger disutility as the severity level 
increased (excepting usual activities levels 2/3). The fourth approach, using a 
level indicator to present the severity levels, has slightly more 
non-monotonicity and produced larger ordered differences for the more severe 
dimension levels. Scale parameter testing suggested that the data cannot be 
pooled.
CONCLUSIONS: The results provide information regarding how to present DCE tasks 
for health state valuation. The findings improve our understanding of the impact 
of different presentation approaches on valuation, and how DCE questions could 
be presented to be amenable to completion. However, it is unclear if the task 
presentation impacts online respondent engagement.

BACKGROUND: Meaning and purpose in life are fundamental to human beings. In 
changing times, with an aging population and increased life expectancy, the need 
for health care services and long-term care is likely to grow. More deeply 
understanding how older long-term care residents perceive meaning and purpose in 
life is critical for improving the quality of care and the residents' quality of 
life. The purpose of this study was to explore crucial aspects promoting nursing 
home residents' experience of meaning and purpose in everyday life.
METHOD: An exploratory hermeneutical design with qualitative interviews for 
collecting data.
RESULTS: Four key experiences were found to promote meaning and purpose in life: 
1) physical and mental well-being, 2) belonging and recognition, 3) personally 
treasured activities and 4) spiritual closeness and connectedness.
CONCLUSION: In supporting meaning and purpose in life of nursing home residents, 
the residents' everyday well-being should be a central focus of care and 
facilitate personally treasured activities. Focused attention should also be 
given to the meaning-making power of experiencing belonging, recognition and 
spiritual connectedness.

Spiralians, including molluscs, annelids and platyhelminths, share a unique 
development process that includes the typical geometry of early cleavage and 
early segregation of cell fate in blastomeres along the animal-vegetal axis. 
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this early cell fate segregation 
are largely unknown. Here, we report spiralian-specific expansion of the 
three-amino-acid loop extension (TALE) class of homeobox genes. During early 
development, some of these TALE genes are expressed in staggered domains along 
the animal-vegetal axis in the limpet Nipponacmea fuscoviridis and the 
polychaete Spirobranchus kraussii. Inhibition or overexpression of these genes 
alters the developmental fate of blastomeres, as predicted by the gene 
expression patterns. These results suggest that the expansion of novel TALE 
genes plays a critical role in the establishment of a novel cell fate 
segregation mechanism in spiralians.

Application of edible coatings is a suitable method to maintain the quality and 
reduce post-harvest losses in fresh vegetables and fruits. Pear fruits being 
climacteric have a short shelf life, and coating is considered as one of the 
most popular techniques to prolong its shelf life.The present study evaluates 
the effect of optimized edible coatings containing soy protein isolate (SPI) in 
combination with additives like hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and olive 
oil on 'Babughosha' Pears (Pyrus communis L.) stored at ambient temperature 
(28 ± 5 °C and 60 ± 10% RH). Four different coatings optimized by response 
surface methodology study were used in the present experiment. The results of 
the present study shows that the optimized edible coatings help retain the 
firmness of fruits and lowered the moisture loss. The tested combination of 
coating could also withhold the levels of ascorbic acid, chlorophyll and sugar 
contents in the treated fruits. Activities of enzymes associated with fruit 
softening (β-galactosidase, polygalacturonase, pectin methyl esterase) showed 
delayed peaks. Amongst all treatments, T1 (SPI 5.0%, HPMC 0.40%, Olive oil 1%, 
Potassium sorbate 0.22%) and T2 (SPI 5.0%, HPMC 0.40%, Olive oil 0.98% Potassium 
sorbate 0.20%) were found to have pronounced effect on retention of nutritional 
quality in pears. Observations of shelf-life extension established that T2 (SPI 
5.0%, HPMC 0.40%, Olive oil 0.98% Potassium sorbate 0.20%) was successful in 
extending shelf-life of pear fruits up to 15 days, as compared to 8 days for 
untreated pear fruits.

Members of gram-negative bacteria family Pasteurellaceae, include a large number 
of important economically human and veterinary pathogens. Organisms belonging to 
the family can colonize in mucosal surfaces of the respiratory, alimentary, 
genital tracts and cause diseases in various mammals, birds, and reptiles. 
Hemorrhagic septicemia is an acute disease of cattle and buffaloes in tropical 
countries caused by Pasteurella multocida serotype B:2. In the present study, 
the possible bactericidal activity of immune calf sera in the presence and 
absence of complement system was investigated. The results showed that P. 
multocida B:2 is highly resistant to positive serum, containing high levels of 
IgG and IgM obtained from calves after vaccination, and complement activity in 
normal fresh calf serum. This organism also grew rapidly in the normal fresh 
calf serum and the mixture of positive serum as well as normal fresh calf serum. 
As a control test an E. coli strain was subjected to the same experiment and 
found completely sensitive to the bactericidal activity of complement in calf 
and guinea pig fresh sera. Results were indicative of the presence of inhibitory 
mechanism(s) in P. multocida B:2 against bactericidal activity of immune calf 
serum and complement system.

Aim  The purpose of this prospective multicenter study was to test the 
predictive value of cortical comminution and intra-articular involvement on 
function and quality of life in distal radius fractures (DRFs) using the 
Buttazzoni's classification system. Patients and Methods  We studied 406 
patients between skeletal maturity and 74 years of age with DRF. Fractures with 
acceptable radiographic alignment were immobilized with a cast. Fractures with 
nonacceptable radiographic alignment underwent closed reduction and 4 to 6 weeks 
cast immobilization. Radiographs were obtained after reduction and at 10 to 14 
days. Redisplaced fractures were offered surgical treatment. One-year follow-up 
included grip strength, range of motion (ROM), quickDASH, EQ-5D (including 
visual analog scale [VAS] for health status), and VAS pain. Results  We found no 
statistically significant differences in QuickDASH, EQ-5D questionnaire, EQ-5D 
health status VAS, and VAS pain among the Buttazzoni classes. However, initial 
displacement was associated with worse quickDASH score, worse EQ-5D score, 
reduced grip strength, and reduced ROM. Dorsal comminution was associated with 
worse quickDASH score, reduced flexion, and reduced pronation-supination 
ability. Volar comminution predicted loss of extension, while intra-articular 
involvement was associated with reduced flexion-extension arc and worse EQ-5D 
score. There was a significant difference in ROM between noncomminuted and 
comminuted fracture classes. Conclusion  Initial fracture position, type of 
comminution, and intra-articular involvement influenced the clinical outcome in 
DRF.

PURPOSE: To present a case of a patient with possible short (2 years 
approximately) life expectancy and a 68-mm abdominal aortic aneurysm with a 
large infrarenal neck and large suprarenal aorta that precluded chimney 
endovascular aortic repair (Ch-EVAR) treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The technical aspects of a modification of the funnel 
technique (thoracic endograft as a proximal extension of a main infrarenal 
device in wide necks) are described. We advocated a migrated bifurcated 36-mm 
endograft in a 34-mm native aorta, ten mm below the lowest renal artery and 
added endoanchor (four) fixation to this "intentionally migrated main 
endograft." Afterward, we extended proximally a large aortic 
38-mm-wide/50-mm-long cuff using the remaining 10-mm neck for cuff sealing. This 
aortic cuff achieved 8.5% oversizing in this 10-mm neck length. We again added 
additional endoanchoring (four) on this cuff.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Insights into technical issues for this bailout 
technique are described. No proximal endoleak or sac enlargement or migration is 
founded on 6-month follow up.

INTRODUCTION: A home-based, low-intensity physical activity program (Onco-Move) 
and a supervised, moderate-to-high intensity, combined resistance and aerobic 
exercise program (OnTrack) have proven to be effective in maintaining physical 
fitness and reducing fatigue among breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant 
chemotherapy. This study evaluated the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of 
Onco-Move and OnTrack.
METHODS: A total of 230 patients were randomized to Onco-Move, OnTrack, or usual 
care (UC). Health outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), general 
and physical fatigue, and physical fitness measured at baseline, end of 
chemotherapy, and 6-month follow-up. Societal costs included professional and 
informal health care, work absenteeism, and unpaid productivity costs. Cost data 
were based on 3-monthly questionnaires, supplemented by medication data obtained 
from pharmacies.
RESULTS: Onco-Move is not likely to be cost-effective due to the relatively high 
willingness-to-pay necessary to reach reasonable probabilities of 
cost-effectiveness (QALY, general and physical fatigue). Incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios for OnTrack compared to UC were €26,916/QALY, 
€788/1-point decrease in general fatigue and €1402/1-point decrease in physical 
fatigue. The probability of OnTrack being cost-effective ranged from 31% at a 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) of €0-79% at a WTP of €80,000/QALY, 97% at a WTP of 
€15,000/1-point decrease in general fatigue, and 86% at a WTP of €24,000/1-point 
decrease in physical fatigue. Both interventions had a low probability of being 
cost-effective for physical fitness. The probability of cost-effectiveness for 
both interventions was greater among compliant participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Onco-Move is not likely to be cost-effective. Depending on the 
decision-makers' willingness-to-pay, OnTrack could be considered cost-effective 
in comparison with UC. Trial registration Clinical trial registration number of 
the Netherlands Trial Register-NTR2159.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), as part of the 
institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process, invited the manufacturer 
of pomalidomide (POM; Imnovid®, Celgene) to submit evidence regarding the 
clinical and cost effectiveness of the drug in combination with dexamethasone 
(POM + LoDEX) for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma 
(RRMM) after at least two regimens including lenalidomide (LEN) and bortezomib 
(BOR). Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR) and Erasmus University Rotterdam 
were commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) for this submission. The 
ERG reviewed the evidence submitted by the manufacturer, validated the 
manufacturer's decision analytic model, and conducted exploratory analyses in 
order to assess the robustness and validity of the presented clinical and 
cost-effectiveness results. This paper describes the company submission, the ERG 
assessment, and NICE's subsequent decisions. The company conducted a systematic 
review to identify studies comparing POM with comparators outlined in the NICE 
scope: panobinostat with bortezomib and dexamethasone (PANO + BOR + DEX), 
bendamustine with thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD) and conventional 
chemotherapy (CC). The main clinical effectiveness evidence was obtained from 
MM-003, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing POM + LoDEX with high-dose 
dexamethasone (HiDEX; used as a proxy for CC). Additional data from other 
studies were also used as nonrandomized observational data sources for the 
indirect treatment comparison of POM + LoDEX with BTD and PANO + BOR + DEX. 
Covariate or treatment switching adjustment methods were used for each 
comparison. The model developed in Microsoft® Excel 2010 using a semi-Markov 
partitioned survival structure, submitted in the original submission to NICE for 
TA338, was adapted for the present assessment of the cost effectiveness of POM + 
LoDEX. Updated evidence from the clinical-effectiveness part was used for the 
survival modelling of progression-free survival and overall survival. For POM + 
LoDEX, the patient access scheme (PAS) discount was applied to the POM price. 
Three separate comparisons were conducted for each comparator, each comparison 
using a different dataset and adjustment methods. The ERG identified and 
corrected some errors, and the corrected incremental cost-effectiveness ratios 
(ICERs) for POM + LoDEX versus each comparator were presented: approximately 
£45,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus BTD, savings of 
approximately £143,000 per QALY lost versus PANO + BOR + DEX, and approximately 
£49,000 per QALY gained versus CC. The ERG also conducted full incremental 
analyses, which revealed that CC, POM + LoDEX and PANO + BOR + DEX were on the 
cost-effectiveness frontier. The committee's decision on the technology under 
analysis deemed that POM + LoDEX should be recommended as an option for treating 
multiple myeloma in adults at third or subsequent relapse of treatments 
including both LEN and BOR, contingent on the company providing POM with the 
discount agreed in the PAS.

Optimal management of recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) remains an area of 
uncertainty. An estimated 85% of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer who 
achieve a full remission following first-line therapy will develop recurrent 
disease and median survival for these patients' ranges from 12 months to 
24 months. Many patients receive several lines of treatment following recurrence 
and, although each subsequent line of therapy is characterized by shorter 
disease-free intervals, decisions about the most appropriate treatment is 
complex. Areas covered: This review focuses on chemotherapy, surgery and 
emerging biologic agents that present a therapeutic option for patients with 
ROC. Expert commentary: Recurrent ovarian cancer is not curable. The goals of 
therapy should focus on palliation of cancer-related symptoms, extension of 
life, and maintenance of quality of life. Patients with platinum-sensitive 
ovarian cancer should have their recurrence treated with a platinum-based agent. 
For patients whose cancer progresses after platinum retreatment and for those 
with platinum-resistant disease, numerous other non-platinum combination and 
targeted therapies have been shown to be effective in palliating cancer-related 
symptoms and extending life.

Health Inequalities in South Asia at the Launch of Sustainable Development 
Goals: Exclusions in Health in Kerala, India Need Political Interventions.

University , New Delhi, India.

Despite substantial progress in social development during the post-colonial 
period, health inequalities in the South Asian countries were staggering, with 
reduced life expectancy, higher maternal and child mortality, and gender 
discrimination. Notably, even with the rapid economic growth during the 
neoliberal period, India fares below most of the South Asian countries in 
several health indicators. The Indian state of Kerala stands out with social 
sector gains; nevertheless, evidence indicates widening health inequalities, 
restricted public arenas, and undemocratic practices in health, particularly in 
the context of increasing market logic in the health and social arenas shaping 
health. The caste, class, gender, and ethnic ideologies and patriarchal power 
structure interwoven in the sociopolitical, cultural, moral, and health 
discourses similar to the South Asian context raise serious inequalities for 
health. At the launch of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, the 
populations with lingering privations and forbidden freedoms for gaining better 
health in Kerala, similar to South Asia, were largely the dalits, ethnic and 
religious minorities, and women. This necessitates greater political 
interventions, recognizing the interacting effects of history, culture, social 
factors, politics, and policies on health. And public health research needs to 
underscore this approach.

αKlotho is a gene regulator of aging, increasing life expectancy when 
overexpressed and accelerating the development of aging phenotypes when 
inhibited. In mice, expression levels of the secreted isoform Klotho (s-KL) are 
very high in the brain, suggesting that s-KL activity may have an important role 
in the nervous system. Here we study the functional relevance at behavioural 
level of modifying s-KL levels in the aging brain. We used AAVrh10 vectors to 
deliver and sustained expression of s-KL in 6- and 12-month-old wild-type 
C57BL/6J males. This study demonstrates for we believe the first time in vivo 
that 6 months after a single injection of s-KL into the central nervous system, 
long-lasting and quantifiable enhancement of learning and memory capabilities 
are found. More importantly, cognitive improvement is also observable in 
18-month-old mice treated once, at 12 months of age. These findings demonstrate 
the therapeutic potential of s-KL as a treatment for cognitive decline 
associated with aging.

[ASSOCIATION OF SKIN PHOTOTYPE AND UV EXPOSURE WITH EXPRESSION OF HER RECEPTORS, 
Ki67 AND p53 IN PATIENTS WITH CUTANEOUS SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA].

[Article in Croatian]

Drvar DL, Lipozenčić J, Mokos ZB, Ilić I, Knežević F.

An increase in the incidence of cancer, in particular skin cancer, has been 
observed in the last few decades. Skin cancer represents a significant public 
health problem in Croatia and worldwide. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma 
(cSCC) is a malignant tumor arising in epidermal keratinocytes. Together with 
basal cell carcinoma it belongs to non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most 
common cancers in humans. The lifetime risk of cSCC development in Caucasian 
population is nowadays estimated to about 15%, which makes it double compared to 
20 years ago. The most probable causes are increased ultraviolet light (UV) 
exposure (exposure to artificial UV sources in suntan parlors, spending more 
time outdoors, changes in fashion, as well as ozone holes), and longer life 
expectancy. In its etiopathogenesis, important risk factors include genetic 
factors, fair-skin phototype, UV exposure, chronic degenerative and inflammatory 
conditions, chemical factors, oncogenic viruses, immunosuppression, ionizing 
radiation, as well as habitual risk factors. Human epidermal growth factor 
receptor (HER) family is involved in the control of multiple signal pathways. 
Their dysregulation is associated with development of many cancers such as 
breast carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, carcinoma of 
pancreas, head and neck carcinoma, as well as glioblastoma. The objective of our 
investigation was to establish if there is association of the skin phototype and 
UV exposure with the expression of HER receptors, Ki67 and p53 in patients with 
cSCC. Study group included 101 cSCC patients. Inclusion criteria were age >50, 
both sexes, histopathologically confirmed cSCC, no previous therapy, specimens 
sufficient for immunohistochemistry, and complete clinical data collected by a 
questionnaire. Material obtained by excisional biopsy was completely 
histopathologically evaluated and additional tissue slices were 
immunohistochemically analyzed. Statistical analysis of the sample included 
non-parametrical statistical methods and statistical reviews. Analysis was done 
using R statistical package. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. The 
following skin phototypes (according to Fitzpatrick) were present in our study: 
54 (53.47%) patients with phototype II and 47 (46.53%) patients with phototype 
III. The majority of patients (n=93; 92.08%) were exposed to increased UV 
radiation during lifetime. Forty (39.60%) patients had three or more sunburns 
during childhood. Study results showed a signifi cantly higher expression of 
EGFR receptors, Ki67 and protein p53 in patients with light skin phototype that 
had been exposed to increased UV light during lifetime or had acquired 3 or more 
sunburns in childhood, suggesting that UV exposure led to the induction of EGFR, 
Ki67 and protein p53, and consequently to development of cSCC.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the lifetime cost-effectiveness of intermittent, 
reversible vagal nerve blocking (via the implantable weight loss device vBloc) 
therapy versus conventional therapy as treatment for patients who are class 2 
obese with diabetes and for those who are class 3 obese with or without 
diabetes, who have found pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapies ineffective, 
but are not prepared or willing to undergo current bariatric surgical options.
STUDY DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness model was designed to simulate weight loss, 
diabetes remission, and costs in patients with obesity undergoing vagal nerve 
blocking therapy versus conventional therapy.
METHODS: The model compared 2 treatment arms, vagal nerve blocking therapy and 
conventional therapy, and for each treatment arm included 4 health states based 
on body mass index (BMI) class. Using Monte Carlo simulation, patients entered 
the model one at a time and could transition between health states by 
experiencing BMI change. The model focused on change in BMI and diabetes 
remission as predictors of healthcare costs, health-related quality of life, and 
survival. Inputs for vagal nerve blocking effectiveness were obtained from the 
ReCharge trial; however, remaining inputs were estimated from published 
literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were evaluated in 
terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: ICERs for vagal nerve blocking versus conventional therapy in patients 
who were class 2 and class 3 obese were estimated to be $17,274 and $21,713 per 
QALY gained, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed results to be robust to 
reasonable variation in model inputs, with the upper limit of ICERs remaining 
below $30,000 for all sensitivity analysis scenarios assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: Vagal nerve blocking therapy provides a cost-effective alternative 
to conventional therapy in patients who are class 2 obese with diabetes and in 
those who are class 3 with or without diabetes.
