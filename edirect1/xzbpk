PURPOSE: Brazil is the fifth most populous country in the world with widespread 
regional and social inequalities. Regional disparities in healthcare are 
unacceptably large, with the remote and poor regions of the north and northeast 
having reduced life expectancy compared to the south region, where life 
expectancy approaches that of rich countries. We report our experience of a 
humanitarian surgery mission to the Amazonas state, in the northwest part of 
Brazil.
METHODS: In August 2014, a team of seven consultant surgeons, and two trainees 
with the charity 'International Hernia', visited three hospitals in the Amazonas 
state to provide hernia surgery and training.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine hernias were repaired in 74 patients (female = 22, 
male = 52) with a median age of 44 years (range 2-83 years). Nine patients 
underwent more than one type of hernia repair, and there were 9 laparoscopic 
inguinal and ventral incisional hernia repairs. Local doctors were trained in 
hernia repair techniques, and an International Hernia Symposium was held at the 
University of the State of Amazonas, Manaus.
CONCLUSION: The humanitarian mission provided hernia surgery to an underserved 
population in Brazil and training to local doctors, building local 
sustainability. Continued cooperation between host and international surgeons 
for future missions to Brazil will ensure continuing surgical training and 
technical assistance.

Homeless people have substantial health disadvantages as compared to the general 
population, and excessive losses in life expectancy. High proportions of 
psychiatric disorders, substance abuse and intellectual disability have been 
reported. This makes palliative care for this population extremely complex. A 
55-year-old man, addicted to heroin and cocaine, was diagnosed with metastatic 
lung cancer. His terminal phase of life was complicated by many admissions to 
different care settings and problems with symptom management. Involvement of a 
palliative care consultation team and transfer to a homeless shelter, to which 
homeless people with life-threatening diseases could be admitted, gave both the 
patient and his family relief. This case illustrates that palliative care in 
homeless patients may be extremely complex due to the specific physical and 
psychosocial features involved. Such care should be offered proactively and on a 
multidisciplinary basis.

[What are the health benefits of the most expensive healthcare system in 
Europe?].

Since the year 2000, healthcare expenditure in the Netherlands has seen a 
meteoric rise and as a result the Netherlands now has the highest level of 
healthcare expenditure (expressed as a percentage of national income) of all 
European countries. Whether this has led to better population health outcomes 
is, however, unclear. The only outcome for which there is some evidence is life 
expectancy at birth, which has probably improved as a result of more and better 
healthcare. Unfortunately, despite very high levels of healthcare spending, 
current Dutch life expectancy is not among the best in Europe, partly because of 
a relatively high prevalence of smoking and insufficient tobacco control 
measures. More health gains could have been achieved if greater priority had 
been given to prevention.

INTRODUCTION: Tobacco smoking is among the leading causes of preventable 
mortality worldwide. We assessed the impact of smoking on life expectancy 
worldwide between 1980 and 2010.
METHODS: We retrieved cause-specific mortality data from the WHO Mortality 
Database by sex, year and age for 63 countries with high or moderate quality 
data (1980-2010). Using the time of the peak of the smoking epidemic by country, 
relative risks from the three waves of the Cancer Prevention Study were applied 
to calculate the smoking impact ratio and population attributable fraction. 
Finally, we estimated the potential gain in life expectancy at age 40 if 
smoking-related deaths in middle age (40-79 years) were eliminated.
RESULTS: Currently, tobacco smoking is related to approximately 20% of total 
adult mortality in the countries in this study (24% in men and 12% in women). If 
smoking-related deaths were eliminated, adult life expectancy would increase on 
average by 2.4 years in men (0.1 in Uzbekistan to 4.8 years in Hungary) and 
1 year in women (0.1 in Kyrgyzstan to 2.9 years in the USA). The proportion of 
smoking-related mortality among men has declined in most countries, but has 
increased in the most populous country in the world, that is, China from 4.6% to 
7.3%. Increases in the impact of tobacco on life expectancy were observed among 
women in high-income countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Recent trends indicate a substantial rise in the population-level 
impact of tobacco smoking on life expectancy in women and in middle-income 
countries. High-quality local data are needed in most low-income countries.

OBJECTIVE: Determine the cost-effectiveness of screening all pregnant women aged 
16-25 years for chlamydia compared with selective screening or no screening.
DESIGN: Cost effectiveness based on a decision model.
SETTING: Antenatal clinics in Australia.
SAMPLE: Pregnant women, aged 16-25 years.
METHODS: Using clinical data from a previous study, and outcomes data from the 
literature, we modelled the short-term perinatal (12-month time horizon) 
incremental direct costs and outcomes from a government (as the primary 
third-party funder) perspective for chlamydia screening. Costs were derived from 
the Medicare Benefits Schedule, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and average 
cost-weights reported for hospitalisations classified according to the 
Australian refined diagnosis-related groups.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Direct costs of screening and managing chlamydia 
complications, number of chlamydia cases detected and treated, and the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated and subjected to 
sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Assuming a chlamydia prevalence rate of 3%, screening all antenatal 
women aged 16-25 years at their first antenatal visit compared with no screening 
was $34,931 per quality-adjusted life-years gained. Screening all women could 
result in cost savings when chlamydia prevalence was higher than 11%. The 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were most sensitive to the assumed 
prevalence of chlamydia, the probability of pelvic inflammatory disease, the 
utility weight of a positive chlamydia test and the cost of the chlamydia test 
and doctor's appointment.
CONCLUSION: From an Australian government perspective, chlamydia screening of 
all women aged 16-25 years old during one antenatal visit was likely to be 
cost-effective compared with no screening or selective screening, especially 
with increasing chlamydia prevalence.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Chlamydia screening for all pregnant women aged 16-25 years 
during an antenatal visit is cost effective.

Advances in care and antiretroviral treatment, improved life expectancy and 
quality of life in children with perinatally-acquired human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) infection. There is increasing interest in the chronic effects of 
growing up with HIV. The aim of this study was to assess the psychosocial, 
emotional and behavioural functioning in a cohort of perinatally-acquired 
HIV-infected adolescents. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews 
and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for emotional and 
behavioural disorders screening.
RESULTS: A total of 95 patients (58% women) were assessed with a median age of 
15 years (11-19.1) and a median age at diagnosis of 1.7 years (0-12.2). The 
median CD4 count, at the inclusion, was 626 cells/mm(3) (132-998), with 34% 
(10-52%). Viral load was <50 copies/ml in 72% of patients. Eighty-one per cent 
knew their diagnosis and optimal adherence was achieved in 53%. Passive coping 
was reported in 58.4% of the adolescents. Only 7.7% of teenagers had a complete 
and adequate knowledge of their disease and only 18.2% had shared it with their 
friends. Six unwanted pregnancies occurred (11% of women). Most of them (90%) 
attended school but 60% had been held back one or more school years. Overall, 
SDQ scored a risk of behavioural and emotional problems in 24.5%. The report of 
behaviours associated with hyperactivity was high in 14.9% of the population and 
borderline in 18.1%. Adolescents with encephalopathy accounted for 44% of those 
whose total scores fell in either the abnormal and borderline ranges for 
emotional difficulties (p = .038).
CONCLUSION: Perinatally-acquired HIV-infected adolescents showed significant 
psychosocial and behavioural health risks that should bring attention to 
prevention and health care programmes. An earlier disclosure to children could 
favour a better psychological adjustment and a better treatment adherence. 
Future studies are needed to assess the relationship between vertically acquired 
HIV-infection and hyperactivity.

World governments have committed to increase the global protected areas coverage 
by 2020, but the effectiveness of this commitment for protecting biodiversity 
depends on where new protected areas are located. Threshold- and 
complementarity-based approaches have been independently used to identify 
important sites for biodiversity. We brought together these approaches by 
performing a complementarity-based analysis of irreplaceability in important 
bird and biodiversity areas (IBAs), which are sites identified using a 
threshold-based approach. We determined whether irreplaceability values are 
higher inside than outside IBAs and whether any observed difference depends on 
known characteristics of the IBAs. We focused on 3 regions with comprehensive 
IBA inventories and bird distribution atlases: Australia, southern Africa, and 
Europe. Irreplaceability values were significantly higher inside than outside 
IBAs, although differences were much smaller in Europe than elsewhere. Higher 
irreplaceability values in IBAs were associated with the presence and number of 
restricted-range species; number of criteria under which the site was 
identified; and mean geographic range size of the species for which the site was 
identified (trigger species). In addition, IBAs were characterized by higher 
irreplaceability values when using proportional species representation targets, 
rather than fixed targets. There were broadly comparable results when measuring 
irreplaceability for trigger species and when considering all bird species, 
which indicates a good surrogacy effect of the former. Recently, the 
International Union for Conservation of Nature has convened a consultation to 
consolidate global standards for the identification of key biodiversity areas 
(KBAs), building from existing approaches such as IBAs. Our results informed 
this consultation, and in particular a proposed irreplaceability criterion that 
will allow the new KBA standard to draw on the strengths of both threshold- and 
complementarity-based approaches.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcome and cost-effectiveness of nurse-led care in 
the community for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
DESIGN: Non-randomised pragmatic study.
SETTING: Primary (7 primary care practices) and secondary care (single centre) 
in the UK.
METHODS: In a single area, pragmatic non-randomised study, we assessed the 
outcome, cost-effectiveness of community-based nurse-led care (NLC) compared 
with rheumatologist-led outpatient care (RLC). Participants were 349 adults (70% 
female) with stable RA assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months. In the community 
NLC arm there were 192 participants. Outcome was assessed using Stanford Health 
Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). The economic evaluation (healthcare perspective) 
estimated cost relative to change in HAQ and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) 
derived from EQ-5D-3L. We report complete case and multiple imputation results 
from regression analyses.
RESULTS: The demographics and baseline characteristics of patients in the 
community group were comparable to those under hospital care apart from use of 
biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS), which were adjusted 
for in the analysis. The mean incremental cost was estimated to be £224 less for 
RLC compared to the community NLC, with wide CIs (CI -£213 to £701, p=0.296). 
Levels of functional disability were not clinically significantly higher in the 
community NLC group: HAQ 0.096 (95% CI -0.026 to 0.206; p=0.169) and QALY 0.023 
(95% CI -0.059 to 0.012; p=0.194).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that community care may be associated with 
non-significant higher costs with no significant differences in clinical 
outcomes, and this suggests a low probability that it is cost-effective.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to clarify the communication 
preferences of patients with advanced cancer regarding discussions about ending 
anticancer treatment and transitioning to palliative care and to explore the 
variables associated with those preferences.
METHODS: Participants were 106 Japanese patients with cancer who had been 
informed at least 1 week earlier about the cessation of their anticancer 
treatment. They completed a survey measuring their preferences for communication 
about ending anticancer treatment and transitioning to palliative care as well 
as their demographic characteristics. Medical records were also examined to 
investigate medical characteristics.
RESULTS: Results of the descriptive analysis indicated that patients strongly 
preferred their physicians to listen to their distress and concerns (96%), to 
assure them that their painful symptoms would be controlled (97.1%), and to 
explain the status of their illness and the physical symptoms that would likely 
occur in the future (95.1%). Multiple regression analyses identified the factors 
associated with these preferences: telling patients to prepare mentally and 
informing them of their expected life expectancy were associated with cancer 
site; sustaining hope was associated with cancer site and children; and empathic 
paternalism was associated with duration since cancer diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients preferred their physicians to be realistic 
about their likely future and wanted to be reassured that their painful symptoms 
would be controlled. For patients with cancer at certain sites, those with 
children, and those more recently diagnosed, physicians should communicate 
carefully and actively by providing information on life expectancy and mental 
preparation, sustaining hope, and behaving with empathic paternalism.

Influence of Mortality Factors and Host Resistance on the Population Dynamics of 
Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) in Urban Forests.

The success of emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) in North 
America is hypothesized to be due to both the lack of significant natural 
enemies permitting easy establishment and a population of trees that lack the 
ability to defend themselves, which allows populations to grow unchecked. Since 
its discovery in 2002, a number of studies have examined mortality factors of 
the insect in forests, but none have examined the role of natural enemies and 
other mortality agents in the urban forest. This is significant because it is in 
the urban forest where the emerald ash borer has had the most significant 
economic impacts. We studied populations in urban forests in three 
municipalities in Ontario, Canada, between 2010 and 2012 using life tables and 
stage-specific survivorship to analyze data from a split-rearing manipulative 
experiment. We found that there was little overall mortality caused by natural 
enemies; most mortality we did observe was caused by disease. Stage-specific 
survivorship was lowest in small and large larvae, supporting previous 
observations of high mortality in these two stages. We also used our data to 
test the hypothesis that mortality and density in emerald ash borer are linked. 
Our results support the prediction of a negative relationship between mortality 
and density. However, the relationship varies between insects developing in the 
crown and those in the trunk of the tree. This relationship was significant 
because when incorporated with previous findings, it suggests a mechanism and 
hypothesis to explain the outbreak dynamics of the emerald ash borer.

CONTEXT: As life expectancy improves among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 
patients, renal and cardiovascular diseases are increasingly prevalent in this 
population. Renal and cardiovascular disease are mutual risk factors and are 
characterized by albuminuria. Understanding the interactions between HIV, 
cardiovascular risk factors and renal disease is the first step in tackling this 
new therapeutic frontier in HIV.
METHODS: In a rural primary health care centre, 903 HIV-infected adult patients 
were randomly selected and data on HIV-infection and cardiovascular risk factors 
were collected. Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was estimated. Albuminuria was 
defined as an Albumin-Creatinine-Ratio above 30 mg/g. Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis was used to analyse albuminuria and demographic, clinical 
and HIV-associated variables.
RESULTS: The study population consisted of 903 HIV-infected patients, with a 
median age of 40 years (Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) 34-48 years), and included 
625 (69%) women. The median duration since HIV diagnosis was 26 months (IQR 
12-58 months) and 787 (87%) received antiretroviral therapy. Thirty-six (4%) of 
the subjects were shown to have diabetes and 205 (23%) hypertension. In the 
cohort, 21% had albuminuria and 2% an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2. Albuminuria was 
associated with hypertension (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.59; 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.05-2.41; p<0.05), total cholesterol (aOR 1.31; 95% CI 1.11-1.54; 
p<0.05), eGFR (aOR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.99; p<0.001) and detectable viral load 
(aOR 2.74; 95% CI 1.56-4.79; p<0.001). Hypertension was undertreated: 78% were 
not receiving treatment, while another 11% were inadequately treated. No 
patients were receiving lipid-lowering medication.
CONCLUSION: Glomerular filtration rate was well conserved, while albuminuria was 
common amongst HIV-infected patients in rural South Africa. Both cardiovascular 
and HIV-specific variables were associated with albuminuria. Improved 
cardiovascular risk prevention as well as adequate virus suppression might be 
the key to escape the vicious circle of renal failure and cardiovascular disease 
and improve the long-term prognosis of HIV-infected patients.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Despite the clinical benefits of using standard (non-disease 
specific) oral nutritional supplements (ONS) in the community and care homes, 
there is uncertainty about their economic consequences.
METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken according to recommended procedures 
to assess whether ONS can produce cost savings and cost-effective outcomes.
RESULTS: 19 publications with and without a hospital component were identified: 
9 full text papers, 9 abstracts, and 1 report with retrospective analyses of 6 
randomised controlled trials. From these publications a total of 31 cost and 4 
cost-effectiveness analyses were identified. Most were retrospective analyses 
based on clinical data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In 9 
studies/economic models involving ONS use for <3 months, there were consistent 
cost savings compared to the control group (median cost saving 9.2%; P < 0.01). 
When used for ≥3 months, the median cost saving was 5% (P > 0.05; 5 studies). In 
RCTs, ONS accounted for less than 5% of the total costs and the investment in 
the community produced a cost saving in hospital. Meta-analysis indicated that 
ONS reduced hospitalisation significantly (16.5%; P < 0.001; 9 comparisons) and 
mortality non-significantly (Relative risk 0.86 (95% CI, 0.61, 1.22); 8 
comparisons). Many clinically relevant outcomes favouring ONS were reported: 
improved quality of life, reduced infections, reduced minor post-operative 
complications, reduced falls, and functional limitations. Of the 
cost-effectiveness analyses involving quality adjusted life years or functional 
limitations, most favoured the ONS group. The care home studies (4 cost 
analyses; 2 cost-effectiveness analyses) had differing aims, designs and 
conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the reviewed studies, mostly based on retrospective cost 
analyses, indicate that ONS use in the community produce an overall cost 
advantage or near neutral balance, often in association with clinically relevant 
outcomes, suggesting cost effectiveness. There is a need for prospective studies 
designed to examine primary economic outcomes.

Tuta absoluta (Meyrick), a tomato leaf miner, is one of the destructive pests of 
tomatoes, which is native to South America, and has been considered as a 
quarantined pest for Iran since 2010 while it has quickly spread all around the 
country and is known as a key pest in tomato-cultured regions since 2012. In the 
current study, the life table parameters of T. absoluta were studied on cut 
leaves of three greenhouse cultivars of tomato including 'Atabay', 'Cluse', and 
'Perenses'. Data were analyzed based on the age-stage, two-sex life table 
analysis. Results showed differences in the duration of egg, larvae, pupae, and 
adults. Meanwhile, the life table parameters including intrinsic rate of 
increase (r), finite rate of increase (λ), net reproductive rate (R0), and gross 
reproductive rate (GRR) were categorized increasingly based on the feeding on 
Cluse, Atabay, and Perenses, respectively. The findings of the current study 
showed that the Cluse could be nominated as an unsuitable host for tomato leaf 
miner among cultivars because of its negative influences on the pest's 
biological parameters. Moreover, these results may develop the finding and 
screening process of relatively resistant cultivars to be used in the management 
of T. absoluta.

Halyomorpha halys Stål, the brown marmorated stink bug (Hemiptera: 
Pentatomidae), is an invasive pest with established populations in Oregon. The 
generalist feeding habits of H. halys suggest it has the potential to be a pest 
of many specialty crops grown in Oregon, including hazelnuts, Corylus avellana 
L. The objectives of this study were to: 1) characterize the damage to 
developing hazelnut kernels resulting from feeding by H. halys adults, 2) 
determine how the timing of feeding during kernel development influences damage 
to kernels, and 3) determine if hazelnut shell thickness has an effect on 
feeding frequency on kernels. Adult brown marmorated stink bugs were allowed to 
feed on developing nuts for 1-wk periods from initial kernel development 
(spring) until harvest (fall). Developing nuts not exposed to feeding by H. 
halys served as a control treatment. The degree of damage and diagnostic 
symptoms corresponded with the hazelnut kernels' physiological development. Our 
results demonstrated that when H. halys fed on hazelnuts before kernel 
expansion, development of the kernels could cease, resulting in empty shells. 
When stink bugs fed during kernel expansion, kernels appeared malformed. When 
stink bugs fed on mature nuts the kernels exhibited corky, necrotic areas. 
Although significant differences in shell thickness were observed among the 
cultivars, no significant differences occurred in the proportions of damaged 
kernels based on field tests and laboratory choice tests. The results of these 
studies demonstrated that commercial hazelnuts are susceptible to damage caused 
by the feeding of H. halys throughout the entire period of kernel development.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the factors for continuation or withdrawal as an 
extension of a prospective study of silodosin monotherapy for the treatment of 
lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia for more 
than 6 years.
METHODS: A total of 104 patients (age 71.5 ± 8.2 years) were enrolled in the 
present study. The mean prostate volume was 44.1 ± 23.9 mL. International 
Prostate Symptom Score, quality of life index, maximum flow rate, and postvoid 
residual urine volume were determined at baseline, and at 1, 3, 6 and 
12-72 months after treatment.
RESULTS: Adverse events were noted in 14 patients (13.5%), and the most frequent 
adverse event was ejaculatory dysfunction (5.8%). Withdrawal was noted in 78 
patients, and 26 patients (25.0%) were still taking silodosin at 72 months 
(continuing group). The reasons for withdrawals were: unknown in 27 patients 
(26.0%), adverse events in nine patients (8.7%), unsatisfactory effects in 30 
patients (28.8%) and satisfied with the current condition for six patients 
(5.8%). In 30 patients who withdrew because of unsatisfactory effects, surgery 
was carried out in 21 patients (surgery group). The baseline total International 
Prostate Symptom Score did not differ between the continuing group and the 
surgery group. However, patients with the continuing group had significantly 
smaller baseline prostate volume, and lower baseline quality of life index and 
prostate-specific antigen, than in the surgery group. The mean total 
International Prostate Symptom Score, quality of life index and maximum flow 
rate improved significantly at 1 month, and remained stable up to 72 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The withdrawal rate was higher in patients with a larger prostate. 
The effects of silodosin for lower urinary tract symptoms was immediate and 
stable up to 72 months.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct health economic evaluation of the prevention of 
mother-to-child HIV among pregnant women in Dehong prefecture, Yunnan province, 
China from 2004 to 2013.
METHODS: Data on cost were collected mainly from the annual prevention of 
mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) reporting system of Dehong prefecture, and 
supplemented by HIV PMTCT-related resource allocation data from local health 
bureau. Effectiveness indexes were from local continuous HIV surveillance system 
and annual reported data. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis were used 
to conduct the health economic evaluation.
RESULTS: From 2004 to 2013, 283980 pregnant women were screened for HIV, 2 059 
were detected as positive, and the HIV positive rate was 0.73%. The total cost 
of the PMTCT program was 14 227 000 RMB after discounting, and the unit cost of 
positive case finding was 4 200 RMB. A total of 26 cases of adults and 325 
infants were avoided HIV infection, and the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) was 
40 500 RMB/case. The total obtained quality adjusted life years (QALY) from the 
program was 8 911.5, each one of which cost 1 600 RMB/QALY. If the feeding 
pattern were breast feeding, CER would be 42 800 RMB/case and each one of QALY 
would cost 2 200 RMB.
CONCLUSION: Based on the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis, the HIV 
PMTCT of Dehong prefecture had economic value, which indicates that continued 
investment is needed to strengthen local HIV PMTCT work.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost utility study on the HIV/AIDS 'one-stop service' at 
county level.
METHODS: Financial records and questionnaires were used to collect the 
information about the resource allocation and the effectiveness of antivirus 
treatment (ART) during the two period which were January 2012-June 2013 and July 
2013-December 2013 in the three pilot counties providing 'one-stop service'. 
Treeage Pro 2009 was used to build the Markov model to simulate the evolution of 
5 different HIV statuses, including HIV infection, AIDS, HIV infection receiving 
ART, AIDS receiving ART and death. And compared the cost-utility ratios between 
current ART process and 'one-stop service' process. National and local epidemic 
data and literature review were used to provide the parameters in the model, 
including prior probabilities of each status, transferring probabilities among 
each status, health utility values and investments of each status and discount 
rate.
RESULTS: The expenditures related with 'one-stop service' in the three counties 
were 2 627 339, 209 969, and 191 658 RMB, respectively between July and 
December, 2013. The average periods from HIV infection confirmation to ART 
initiation was reduced from 8 weeks to 18, 10 and 16 days, respectively. The 
percentage of receiving ART within 30 d among those qualified were increased 
from 46.7% (63/135) to 64.3% (45/70) in county A, from 40.0% (16/40) to 69.4% 
(25/36) in county B, and from 9.5% (4/42) to 50.0% (19/38) in county C. If 
current process was applied, the CUR in three counties would be 10 391.89 
RMB/quality adjusted life years (QALY), 6 271.42 RMB/QALY and 3 515.94 RMB/QALY, 
and these would be 10 825.08 RMB/QALY, 8 522.30 RMB/QALY and 10 414.65 RMB/QALY 
with application of 'one-stop service'.
CONCLUSION: 'one-stop service' could decrease the interval between HIV infection 
confirmation and ART initiation and increase the percentage of receiving ART 
among people living with HIV(PLHIV), more QALYs would be obtained with more 
resources invested.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the burden of infectious disease of the Chinese 
population in 1990 and 2010 and changing pattern in the past 20 years.
METHODS: Results of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010) were used 
to demonstrate the burden of infectious disease of the Chinese population in 
1990 and 2010 and changing pattern from 1990 to 2010 by gender and age groups, 
including indicators of incidence, mortality, years of life lost due to 
premature mortality (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), 
disability-adjusted life years (DALY), and their age-standardized rates using 
data of the 2010 National Census as a standard population.
RESULTS: In 1990 incidence, standardized incidence rate, mortality, standardized 
mortality rate, DALY, standardized DALY rate, YLL, standardized YLL rate, YLD, 
and standardized YLD rate of infectious disease in China were 3 067 469 200 
cases, 242 669.34 cases/100 000, 824 300 cases, 72.27 cases/100 000, 58 937 700 
person-years (PYRS), 3 992.85 PYRS/100 000, 46 504 100 PYRS, 2 932.99 PYRS/100 
000, 12 433 600 PYRS, and 1 059.86 PYRS/100 000, respectively. All the aboved 
indicators were declined from 1990 to 2010, in 2010 they were 3 065 985 800 
cases, 224 351.66 cases/100 000, 388 600 cases, 30.74 cases/100 000, 19 492 200 
PYRS, 1 440.75 PYRS/100 000, 12 045 700 PYRS, 891.87 PYRS/100 000, 7 446 500 
PYRS, and 548.89 PYRS/100 000, respectively. When 2010's indicators were 
compared to those in 1990, the rates of increase of incidence, incidence rate, 
mortality, mortality rate, DALY, DALY rate, YLL, YLL rate, YLD, and YLD rate 
were 56.84%, -9.85%, -33.07%, -61.54%, -27.68%, -58.42%, -32.46%, -61.17%, 
-16.75%, and -52.13% for 50-69 age group; for ≥ 70 age group, 57.90%, -5.86%, 
7.41%, -36.12%, -5.00%, -43.51%, -5.14%, -43.59%, -4.52%, and -43.2%.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of infectious disease of the Chinese population was 
declined from 1990 to 2010; however, the incidence of infectious disease was 
increased in ≥ 50 age groups.

HealthPromotion, Nieuwe Achtergracht 100, P O Box 2200, Amsterdam, 1000 CE,

BACKGROUND: The life table is a valid and frequently used instrument to compare 
the mortality of migrant groups. Most analyses are limited to an overview and 
give only life expectancy; however, further analysis of the life table can give 
more insight into differences in patterns of mortality between groups.
METHODS: A thorough life table analysis was applied to the mortality data of 
seven ethnic groups by age and gender.
RESULTS: Life expectancy is systematically higher in migrants compared with the 
Dutch citizens of Amsterdam. However, between birth and the age of 40 the 
probability of death is higher among non-western migrants compared with citizens 
of western origin. The number of deaths is small among the young. This results 
in very small differences in survival between the groups; from birth up to the 
age of 40 the survival rate is 98.7% for citizens of western origin and 98.3% 
for citizens of non-western origin. In all seven ethnic groups over 90.7% of 
babies, male and female, survive up to the age of 60. In all female groups the 
survival is better than in male groups. Males and females aged 0 to 40 from 
Antillean origin are the only exception.
CONCLUSION: Life expectancy is generally higher in non-western than in western 
groups. Differences in survival between ethnic groups are small up to middle 
age.

AIM: The aim of this article is to impart knowledge concerning focused 
transesophageal echocardiographic examination (TEE) for non-cardiac surgery 
which is an essential part of perioperative monitoring. It allows a rapid 
echocardiographic examination without interference with the surgical field or 
under limited transthoracic examination conditions. New recommendations for a 
comprehensive perioperative TEE examination with expanded standard views and the 
recently published consensus statement for a shortened baseline examination were 
crucial for this study.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The background is the peer-reviewed literature from 
PubMed.
RESULTS: Apart from cardiac surgery TEE has two main applications: firstly, the 
evaluation of patients developing acute life-threatening hemodynamic instability 
in the operating room, in the emergency room or in the intensive care unit 
(ICU). Secondly, TEE is used as planned intraoperative monitoring when severe 
hemodynamic, pulmonary or neurological complications are expected because of the 
type of surgery or due to the cardiopulmonary medical history of the patient. In 
2013 a total of 11 relevant standard views were defined for the basic 
perioperative TEE examination in non-cardiac surgery. These 11 views should be 
performed for each patient. Appropriate extension to a comprehensive examination 
may be necessary if complex pathology is obvious.
DISCUSSION: Even in non-cardiac surgery TEE is an important tool allowing 
clarification of a life-threatening perioperative hemodynamic instability within 
a few minutes. Furthermore, the hemodynamic management of high-risk patients can 
be facilitated. Appropriate qualification and continuous training are necessary 
in order to assure the competence of the examiner.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of two multidisciplinary 
management programs for elderly patients hospitalized with chronic heart failure 
(CHF) and how it is influenced by patient characteristics.
METHODS: A trial-based analysis was conducted alongside a randomized controlled 
trial of 280 elderly patients with CHF discharged to home from three Australian 
tertiary hospitals. Two interventions were compared: home-based intervention 
(HBI) that involved home visiting with community-based care versus specialized 
clinic-based intervention (CBI). Bootstrapped incremental cost-utility ratios 
were computed based on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and total healthcare 
costs. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were constructed based on 
incremental net monetary benefit (NMB). We performed multiple linear regression 
to explore which patient characteristics may impact patient-level NMB.
RESULTS: During median follow-up of 3.2 years, HBI was associated with slightly 
higher QALYs (+0.26 years per person; p=0.078) and lower total healthcare costs
