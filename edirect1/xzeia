BACKGROUND: Activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS; or 
p110δ-activating mutations causing senescent T cells, lymphadenopathy, and 
immunodeficiency) is an inborn error of immunity caused by PI3Kδ hyperactivity. 
Resultant immune deficiency and dysregulation lead to recurrent sinopulmonary 
infections, herpes viremia, autoimmunity, and lymphoproliferation.
OBJECTIVE: Leniolisib, a selective PI3Kδ inhibitor, demonstrated favorable 
impact on immune cell subsets and lymphoproliferation over placebo in patients 
with APDS over 12 weeks. Here, we report results from an interim analysis of an 
ongoing open-label, single-arm extension study.
METHODS: Patients with APDS aged 12 years or older who completed NCT02435173 or 
had previous exposure to PI3Kδ inhibitors were eligible. The primary end point 
was safety, assessed via investigator-reported adverse events (AEs) and 
clinical/laboratory evaluations. Secondary and exploratory end points included 
health-related quality of life, inflammatory markers, frequency of infections, 
and lymphoproliferation.
RESULTS: Between September 2016 and August 2021, 37 patients (median age, 20 
years; 42.3% female) were enrolled. Of these 37 patients, 26, 9, and 2 patients 
had previously received leniolisib, placebo, or other PI3Kδ inhibitors, 
respectively. At the data cutoff date (December 13, 2021), median leniolisib 
exposure was 102 weeks. Overall, 32 patients (87%) experienced an AE. Most AEs 
were grades 1 to 3; none were grade 4. One patient with severe baseline 
comorbidities experienced a grade 5 AE, determined as unrelated to leniolisib 
treatment. While on leniolisib, patients had reduced annualized infection rates 
(P = .004), and reductions in immunoglobulin replacement therapy occurred in 10 
of 27 patients. Other observations include reduced lymphadenopathy and 
splenomegaly, improved cytopenias, and normalized lymphocyte subsets.
CONCLUSIONS: Leniolisib was well tolerated and maintained durable outcomes with 
up to 5 years of exposure in 37 patients with APDS.

BACKGROUND: People with a severe mental illness (SMI) have shorter life 
expectancy and poorer quality of life compared to the general population. Most 
years lost are due to cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and various 
types of cancer. We co-designed an intervention to mitigate this health problem 
with key stakeholders in the area, which centred on an extended consultations 
for people with SMI in general practice. This study aimed to1) investigate 
general practitioners' (GPs) experience of the feasibility of introducing 
extended consultations for patients with SMI, 2) assess the clinical content of 
extended consultations and how these were experienced by patients, and 3) 
investigate the feasibility of identification, eligibility screening, and 
recruitment of patients with SMI.
METHODS: The study was a one-armed feasibility study. We planned that seven 
general practices in northern Denmark would introduce extended consultations 
with their patients with SMI for 6 months. Patients with SMI were identified 
using practice medical records and screened for eligibility by the patients' GP. 
Data were collected using case report forms filled out by practice personnel and 
via qualitative methods, including observations of consultations, individual 
semi-structured interviews, a focus group with GPs, and informal conversations 
with patients and general practice staff.
RESULTS: Five general practices employing seven GPs participated in the study, 
which was terminated 3 ½ month ahead of schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
General practices attempted to contact 57 patients with SMI. Of these, 38 
patients (67%) attended an extended consultation, which led to changes in the 
somatic health care plan for 82% of patients. Conduct of the extended 
consultations varied between GPs and diverged from the intended conduct. 
Nonetheless, GPs found the extended consultations feasible and, in most cases, 
beneficial for the patient group. In interviews, most patients recounted the 
extended consultation as beneficial.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that it is feasible to introduce extended 
consultations for patients with SMI in general practice, which were also found 
to be well-suited for eliciting patients' values and preferences. Larger studies 
with a longer follow-up period could help to assess the long-term effects and 
the best implementation strategies of these consultations.

OBJECTIVES: Traditionally, the literature investigating patient-reported 
outcomes in relation to cancer survival focused on negative factors such as 
distress. Meta-analyses in this field have provided a clear identification of 
negative affect that reduce cancer survival (e.g., depression). Nevertheless, 
positive psychological factors and especially positive affect might be equally 
crucial for cancer survival but have been neglected so far. While studies in 
this domain have been conducted, they remain less numerous and have produced 
mixed results.
METHODS: A pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis 
(https://osf.io/jtw7x) aimed at identifying the positive affect linked to 
mortality in cancers were conducted. Four databases (Pubmed, PsycINFO, Embase, 
and Cochrane Library) were searched to find longitudinal studies linking 
positive affect to survival in cancers. Two reviewers completed each stage of 
the study selection process, the data extraction, and the Quality in Prognosis 
Studies risk of bias assessments.
RESULTS: Twenty-four studies involving 822,789 patients were included based on 
the 2462 references identified. The meta-analysis reveals that positive affect 
is associated with longer survival (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.91; 95% CI [0.86, 
0.96], z = -3.58, p < 0.001) and lower mortality (Odd Ratio [OR] = 0.59; 95% CI 
[0.45, 0.78], z = -3.70, p < 0.001). Sub-group analyses indicated that the main 
predictors of survival are emotional and physical well-being, optimism, and 
vitality.
CONCLUSION: This work emphasizes the need to consider the role of affective 
mechanisms in patients with cancer, including their levels of well-being or 
optimism to provide the most favorable conditions for survival. Therefore, 
stronger and continuous effort to improve patients' positive affect could be 
particularly beneficial for their life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: Life course theory provides new perspectives on the impact of early 
experiences on health in old age, where unfortunate childhood experiences can 
alter an individual's health trajectory. This study aims to calculate the 
healthy life expectancy of the older population in China under different 
childhood experiences, and to explore the influence of childhood medical and 
health services on the health level of older adults.
METHODS: Differences in healthy life expectancy of the older population under 
different childhood experiences were analyzed using the multi-state life table 
method to calculate the healthy life expectancy by sex and place of birth, based 
on the cohort data of Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) from 
2008 to 2018.
RESULTS: The probability of the transition risk from health to non-health 
gradually increased with age, while the probability of the transition risk from 
non-health to health decreased with age; In both urban and rural areas, on the 
probability of the transition risk from health to non-health, the older adults 
who were able to receive timely medical and health services in childhood were 
lower than those who failed to receive medical services in time (Z = -5.833, P < 
0.05), but the probability of the transition risk from non-health to health was 
the opposite (Z = -5.334, P < 0.05); The probability of the transition risk from 
health to death is also higher in older adults who were unable to receive timely 
medical care in childhood (Z = -5.88, P < 0.05); The healthy life expectancy and 
its proportion in the remaining life expectancy of older people who received 
medical and health services in time during childhood were significantly higher 
than those of their peers (Z = -5.88, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of medical services in childhood has a negative effect on 
the health of older adults. The healthy life expectancy and its proportion of 
remaining life expectancy were higher for rural older adults than for urban 
older adults under the same health care conditions in childhood; the health 
benefits of good access to health care environment or conditions in childhood 
were greater for rural older females.

The lysosome is responsible for protein and organelle degradation and 
homeostasis and the cathepsins play a key role in maintaining protein quality 
control. Cathepsin D (CTSD), is one such lysosomal protease, which when 
deficient in humans lead to neurolipofuscinosis (NCL) and is important in 
removing toxic protein aggregates. Prior studies demonstrated that CTSD 
germ-line knockout-CtsdKO (CDKO) resulted in accumulation of protein aggregates, 
decreased proteasomal activities, and postnatal lethality on Day 26 ± 1. 
Overexpression of wildtype CTSD, but not cathepsin B, L or mutant CTSD, 
decreased α-synuclein toxicity in worms and mammalian cells. In this study we 
generated a mouse line expressing human CTSD with a floxed STOP cassette between 
the ubiquitous CAG promoter and the cDNA. After crossing with Nestin-cre, the 
STOP cassette is deleted in NESTIN + cells to allow CTSD overexpression-CTSDtg 
(CDtg). The CDtg mice exhibited normal behavior and similar sensitivity to 
sub-chronic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced 
neurodegeneration. By breeding CDtg mice with CDKO mice, we found that 
over-expression of CTSD extended the lifespan of the CDKO mice, partially 
rescued proteasomal deficits and the accumulation of Aβ42 in the CDKO. This new 
transgenic mouse provides supports for the key role of CTSD in protecting 
against proteotoxicity and offers a new model to study the role of CTSD 
enhancement in vivo.

We demonstrated an endovascular technique excluding an ascending aorta 
pseudoaneurysm using an aortic extension. A 32-year-old woman, 3 years after 
lung transplantation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation presented with an 
ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm. Vascular surgery was consulted after open 
repair was deemed high risk. An aortic extension stent graft was placed in a 
hybrid operating room with the aid of intraoperative transesophageal 
echocardiography. Ascending aorta pseudoaneurysms are complex and 
life-threatening complications. Traditional repair involves high surgical and 
anesthetic risks whereas endovascular treatment is technically feasible.

We review the development of clinical staging models of schizophrenia, which has 
developed as a logical extension of the Neuro-developmental theory of 
Schizophrenia. The staging approach, which involves assessing a disorder based 
on its severity, scope, progression, and characteristics, is gaining growing 
recognition in the fields of clinical psychology and psychiatry. We review the 
development of clinical staging models of schizophrenia, which has developed as 
a logical extension of the Neuro-developmental theory of Schizophrenia. The 
development of these clinical staging models should be based also on the 
neuroimaging dana, since this implies actual changes within the brain. There 
still are some difficulties with these models, but they are gradually providing 
both more logical ways of understanding the development of psychotic illness and 
more effective ways of treatment. The Models have contributed to research in 
several areas of psychiatry.

Background There is an increasing life expectancy and a surging elderly 
population in the last few decades, leading to a higher incidence of fractures 
in the elderly. The health care of the elderly in Nepal is below par and there 
are no studies done to evaluate the spectrum of fractures in the elderly. 
Objective To evaluate the demographical and epidemiological aspects of fractures 
in the elderly (≥ 65 years) presenting to a tertiary care hospital in Nepal in a 
15 years' timeline. Method This study was a retrospective epidemiological study 
conducted in the Department of Orthopedics, Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu 
University Hospital (DH, KUH), Nepal. The patients of age ≥ 65 years having 
traumatic injuries, admitted in the orthopedics ward from 2006 January to 2020 
December were included. Patient demographics, site of injury, fracture 
incidence, mechanism of injury, hospital stay duration, and mode of treatment 
(surgical/ conservative) were evaluated. Result Of the 787 patients with an 
average age of 73.65 ± 7.5 years, 54% were females. Peritrochanteric fracture 
was the most common fracture (29.4%) followed by spine (18.3%). The most common 
mechanism of injury was fall on the labeled ground (38.6%). The incidence of 
fragility fractures (peri-trochanteric, proximal humerus, spine, and distal 
radius) was increasing with age. Conclusion Females, peritrochantric fractures, 
and trivial trauma are the most common occurrences for fractures in elderly. The 
incidence of fragility fractures is increasing with age but the overall 
incidence of fractures compared to other studies is low. Higher incidences of 
road traffic accidents (RTA) and compound fractures among the elderly are 
serious public health concerns that highlight the importance of primary 
preventive measures.

University School of Medical Sciences, Dhulikhel, Kavre, Nepal.

Lipoma is a benign mesenchymal tumor originating from adipose tissue. The 
occurrence of this tumor in head and neck is less frequent and it rarely 
involves parotid gland. These are asymptomatic and occur both in the deep and 
the superficial lobe of the parotid. The most favored age group is from the 
fifth to sixth decade of life and is 10 times more common in the males. A 
66-year-old male patient, with left parotid region lipoma is reported in this 
article. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy and ultrasonography were performed to 
establish the preoperative diagnosis and to plan the correct surgical approach. 
It was managed by surgical excision of lipoma with removal of cuff of 
superficial parotid tissue on superior aspect with preserving facial nerve. 
Follow-up examinations were planned to assess any facial nerve injury 
complications.

BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide 
with decreased life expectancy. Duodenal mucosal resurfacing (DMR) has been 
associated with metabolic improvement in glycemic and hepatic parameters of type 
2 diabetes, but the metabolic impact of DMR for NAFLD/NASH remains inconclusive. 
We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate metabolic effects of DMR in patients 
with NAFLD/NASH.
METHODS: Three major bibliographic databases were reviewed for enrollment of 
trials prior to January 28, 2022. We included adults with biopsy-proven 
NAFLD/NASH or liver magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction 
(MRI-PDFF) >5% at baseline and focused on the metabolic difference of MRI-PDFF 
at 12 weeks, and HbA1c or homeostatic model assessment index for insulin 
resistance (HOMA-IR) at 24 weeks.
RESULTS: Two studies involved a total of 67 participants for analysis. When 
compared with pre-intervention status, mean difference of MRI-PDFF, HbA1c, and 
HOMA-IR after DMR were -2.22 (95% CI: -12.79~8.34), -0.32% (95% CI: -0.80~0.16), 
and 0.15 (95% CI: -5.11~5.41) without statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with NAFLD/NASH, DMR has the trend to improve liver 
fat at 12 weeks, and glycemic control in terms of HbA1c level at 24 weeks based 
on a very low quality of evidence.

Identification of cpxS mutational resistome in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Tian ZX(1), Wang YP(1).

Author information:

Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa easily produces drug-resistant mutants. A large number of 
mutational resistome genes exist in the genome of P. aeruginosa. In this study, 
whole genome sequencing analysis of a multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa strain 
isolated by in vitro antibiotic treatment showed a mutation in the cpxS gene. 
Random mutagenesis of cpxS was conducted and introduced into the PA14ΔcpxS 
strain. Numerous CpxS mutants, including 14 different single amino acid 
substitutions, were identified, which led to reduced antibiotic susceptibility. 
Moreover, some of them were also present in the published genomes of P. 
aeruginosa isolates. Around cpxS, a gene coding for a putative sensor kinase, 
the nearest gene coding for a response regulator is cpxR in the genome of P. 
aeruginosa. Deletion of cpxR restored antibiotic susceptibility in the above 
cpxS mutant strains. As an extension of our previous work, where the expression 
of the mexAB-oprM operon is directly activated by CpxR in P. aeruginosa, in this 
study, we showed that the expression of the mexA promoter was increased in the 
above cpxS mutant strains in a cpxR-dependent manner, and mexA is prerequisite 
for the reduced antibiotic susceptibility. Therefore, we propose that the 
putative sensor kinase CpxS, together with CpxR, comprises a two-component 
regulatory system regulating the expression of the mexAB-oprM operon in P. 
aeruginosa. Our work indicates that cpxS, as a novel member of mutational 
resistome, plays important roles on the development of multidrug resistance in 
P. aeruginosa.

PURPOSE: Therapy for cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes 
long-term anticoagulation, which may have substantial impact on the 
health-related quality of life (HRQL) of patients. We assessed patient-reported 
outcomes to characterize the HRQL associated with VTE treatment and to begin to 
examine those HRQL elements impacting anticoagulation adherence (AA).
METHODS: Participants were adult cancer patients with confirmed symptomatic 
acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. Patients were excluded if there 
was an indication for anticoagulation other than VTE, ECOG performance status 
>3, or life expectancy < 3 months. Participants were assessed with a 
self-reported adherence tool. HRQL was measured with a 6-domain questionnaire 
using a seven-point Likert scale. Evaluations were performed at 30 days and 3 
months after enrollment. For the primary objective, an overall adherence rate 
was calculated at each time point of evaluation. For the HRQL domains, 
non-parametric testing was used to compare results between subgroups.
RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were enrolled. AA and HRQL at 30 days and 3 
months were assessed in 50 and 36 participants, respectively. At 30 days the AA 
rate was 90%, and at 3 months it was 83%. In regard to HRQL, patients suffered 
frequent and moderate-severe distress in the domains of emotional and physical 
symptoms, sleep disturbance, and limitations to physical activity. An 
association between emotional or physical distress and AA was observed.
CONCLUSION: Patients with VTE suffer a substantial impairment of their HRQL. 
Increased emotional distress correlated with better long-term AA. These results 
can be used to inform additional research aimed at developing novel strategies 
to improve AA.

Educational Attainment and US Drug Overdose Deaths.

Powell D(1).

Author information:

IMPORTANCE: Educational attainment in the US is associated with life expectancy. 
As the opioid crisis worsens, it is critical to understand how overdose death 
rate trends evolve across education groups.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between educational attainment and 
overdose death rates, with emphasis on trends during the COVID-19 pandemic.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used National 
Vital Statistics System Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death data describing 
overdose death rates in the US by educational attainment from January 1, 2000, 
to December 31, 2021, with a focus on 2018 to 2021. Overdose deaths were 
aggregated by year and educational level for decedents aged 25 years or older.
EXPOSURE: Educational attainment, categorized as no high school (HS) diploma, HS 
diploma (or General Educational Development) but no college, some college but no 
bachelor's degree, and bachelor's degree or more.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were rates of all overdose deaths, 
overdose deaths involving opioids, and overdose deaths involving synthetic 
opioids.
RESULTS: Of 912 057 overdose deaths with education information from 2000 to 2021 
(mean [SD] age at death, 44.9 [12.3] years; 64.1% male), there were 625 400 
deaths (68.6%) among individuals with no college education and 286 657 deaths 
(31.4%) among those with at least some college. The overdose death rate was 19.9 
per 100 000 population. From 2018 to 2021, there were 301 557 overdose deaths, 
including 58 319 (19.3%) among individuals without an HS diploma, 153 603 
(50.9%) among people with an HS diploma, 64 682 (21.4%) among individuals with 
some college, and 24 953 (8.3%) among individuals with a bachelor's degree. 
There were 3324 overdose deaths (1.1%) among American Indian or Alaska Native 
individuals, 2968 (1.0%) among Asian American or Pacific Islander individuals, 
49 152 (16.3%) among Black individuals, 31 703 (10.5%) among Hispanic 
individuals, 211 359 (70.1%) among White individuals, and 3051 (1.0%) among 
multiracial individuals. From 2018 to 2021, the overdose death rate was 33.4 per 
100 000 population, the opioid-related overdose death rate was 24.2 per 100 000 
population, and the synthetic opioid overdose death rate was 19.1 per 100 000 
population. From 2018 to 2021, the overdose death rate for those without a HS 
diploma increased by 35.4 per 100 000 population compared with 1.5 per 100 000 
population for those with a bachelor's degree. This differential growth was 
primarily due to increased rates of death involving synthetic opioids.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, lower educational 
attainment was found to be associated with higher growth in overdose deaths. As 
the opioid crisis has transitioned to fentanyl and polysubstance use, overdose 
deaths have become more prevalent in groups with lower socioeconomic status, 
potentially exacerbating existing life-expectancy disparities.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer (EC) is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related 
burden with distinct regional variations globally. Although the burden of EC has 
decreased, the specific reasons for this decline are still unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to uncover the spatiotemporal patterns of EC 
risk-attributable burden in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019 so 
that prevention and control strategies of EC can be prioritized worldwide.
METHODS: We extracted EC risk-attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life 
years (DALYs), age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs), and age-standardized 
DALY rates (ASDRs) from the global burden of disease (GBD) study from 1990 to 
2019, in terms of behavioral, metabolic, and dietary factors by age, sex, and 
geographical location. Average annual percentage change (AAPC) was used to 
assess the long-term trends in the ASMRs and ASDRs of EC due to specific risk 
factors.
RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2019, the greatest decrease in EC burden was 
attributed to low intake of fruits and vegetables. An AAPC of -2.96 (95% CI 
-3.28 to -2.63) and -3.12 (95% CI -3.44 to -2.79) in ASMR and ASDR was 
attributable to a low-fruit diet, while an AAPC of -3.60 (95% CI -3.84 to -3.36) 
and -3.64 (95% CI -3.92 to -3.35) in ASMR and ASDR was attributed to a 
low-vegetable diet. However, the trends in ASMRs and ASDRs due to high BMI 
showed significant increases with an AAPC of 0.52 (95% CI 0.29-0.75) in ASMR and 
0.42 (95% CI 0.18-0.66) in ASDR from 1990 to 2019 compared to significant 
decreases in other attributable risks with AAPC<0 (P<.05). East Asia had the 
largest decrease in EC burden due to low-vegetable diets, with an AAPC of -11.00 
(95% CI -11.32 to -10.67) in ASMR and -11.81 (95% CI -12.21 to -11.41) in ASDR, 
followed by Central Asia, whereas Western Sub-Saharan Africa had the largest 
increase in ASMR and ASDR due to high BMI, with an AAPC of 3.28 (95% CI 
3.14-3.42) and 3.09 (95% CI 2.96-3.22), respectively. China had the highest EC 
burden attributed to smoking, alcohol use, high BMI, and low-fruit diets. 
Between 1990 and 2019, there was a significant decrease in EC burden 
attributable to smoking, alcohol use, chewing tobacco, low-fruit diets, and 
low-vegetable diets in most countries, wherein a significant increase in the EC 
burden was due to high BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that smoking and alcohol consumption are still the 
leading risk factors of EC burden and that EC burden attributable to low intake 
of fruits and vegetables has shown the largest decline recently. The risks of 
ASMRs and ASDRs of EC showed distinct spatiotemporal patterns, and future 
studies should focus on the upward trend in the EC burden attributed to high 
BMI.

Background Advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) automated insulin delivery systems 
are the most effective therapy in terms of assisting people with type 1 diabetes 
(T1D) to achieve glycemic targets; however, the cost can represent a barrier to 
uptake. Here, a cost-utility analysis of the MiniMedTM 780G AHCL system (MM780G) 
versus intermittently-scanned continuous glucose monitoring (is-CGM) plus 
multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) in people with T1D not achieving 
glycemic goals was performed across six European countries. Methods Clinical 
input data were sourced from the ADAPT trial. Assuming a baseline HbA1c of 
9.04%, HbA1c reductions of 1.54% for AHCL and 0.2% for is-CGM+MDI were assumed. 
The analyses were performed from a payer perspective over a time horizon of 40 
years and an annual discount rate of 3% was applied. Results Across all 
countries, the use of AHCL was projected to result in an incremental gain in 
quality-adjusted life expectancy of >2 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 
versus is-CGM+MDI. Lifetime direct costs were higher with AHCL resulting in 
incremental cost-utility ratios for AHCL versus is-CGM+MDI ranging from EUR 
11,765 per QALY gained in Austria to EUR 43,963 per QALY gained in Italy. 
Conclusions For people with T1D managed with is-CGM+MDI not achieving glycemic 
targets, initiation of the MM780G system was projected to improve long-term 
clinical outcomes; however, due to differences in healthcare costs between 
countries, the health economic outcomes differ. In the countries included here, 
AHCL is likely to be cost-effective relative to is-CGM+MDI for people not 
achieving glycemic goals with is-CGM+MDI.

BACKGROUND: Analysis on the burden of specific types of road injuries (RIs) in 
the previous Global burden of disease (GBD) studies is lacking. The present work 
aimed to analyze the burden of three common RIs using the updated data of the 
GBD 2019, which would inform policy-making.
METHODS: Data on cyclist road injuries (CRIs), motorcyclist road injuries 
(MRIs), and motor vehicle road injuries (MVRIs) were extracted from the GBD 
2019. Trends of age-standardized rate (ASR) were predicted using estimated 
annual percentage change (EAPC) from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: Over the past three decades, the global incident ASRs of CRIs and MRIs 
presented increasing trends, but that of MVRIs declined slightly. However, 
trends of death and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) caused by three 
common RIs decreased in most regions and countries. Particularly, trends in ASRs 
of years of life lost (YLLs) cuased by RIs decreased more pronouncedly than that 
of years of life lived with disability (YLDs). The burden of three common RIs 
showed significant social and demographic characteristics. Low-middle and middle 
socio-demographic index (SDI) areas had a heavy burden of RIs, particularly CRIs 
and MRIs. However, the high SDI area undertook a relatively low burden, and 
presented more pronounced downward trends in death and DALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden and changing trends of three common RIs were 
geographically heterogeneous. The findings highlighted that increasing incident 
trends of RIs needed more cost-effective measures of prevention and 
intervention.

Decapod iridescent virus 1 (DIV1) is an emerging pathogen that mainly threatens 
decapod crustaceans, causing high mortalities and leading to huge economic 
losses. In this study, a pair of specific primers were designed for the major 
capsid protein (MCP) gene of DIV1, and a SYBR Green I-based real-time PCR method 
was developed. The method displayed good linearity (R2 = 1.000) and good 
repeatability in detecting standards of DIV1 MCP fragments ranging from 
6.2 × 101 to 6.2 × 108 DNA copies/μl. Specificity analysis revealed that the 
real-time PCR was specific for DIV1 and did not react with other common shrimp 
pathogens or healthy shrimp DNA. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the 
real-time PCR could efficiently detect DIV1 DNA as low as 62 copies/μl within 35 
cycles. In summary, the established real-time PCR provides an efficient, 
sensitive, and reliable detection method for DIV1.

BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic disparities in life expectancy in the United 
States have been widely documented. To date, there remains a paucity of similar 
data in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEIs).
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine racial and ethnic differences in mortality due 
to an IEI in the United States.
METHODS: We analyzed National Center for Health Statistics national mortality 
data from 2003 to 2018. We quantified age-adjusted death rate and age-specific 
death rate as a result of an IEI for each major racial and ethnic group in the 
United States and examined the association of race and ethnicity with death at a 
younger age.
RESULTS: From 2003 to 2018, IEIs were reported as the underlying or contributing 
cause of death in 14,970 individuals nationwide. The age-adjusted death rate was 
highest among Black patients (4.25 per 1,000,000 person years), compared with 
2.01, 1.71, 1.50, and 0.92 per 1,000,000 person years for White, American 
Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander patients, 
respectively. The odds of death before age 65 years were greatest among Black 
patients (odds ratio [OR] = 5.15 [95% CI = 4.61-5.76]), followed by American 
Indian/Alaska Native patients (OR = 3.58 [95% CI = 2.30-5.82]), compared with 
White patients. The odds of death before age 24 years were greater among 
Hispanic patients than among non-Hispanic patients (OR = 3.60 [95% CI = 
3.08-4.18]).
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights racial and ethnic disparities in mortality due 
to an IEI and the urgent need to further identify and systematically remove 
barriers in care for historically marginalized patients with IEIs.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the most up-to-date burden of traumatic brain injury 
(TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) and analyse their leading causes in different 
countries/territories.
DESIGN: An analysis of Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data.
SETTING: The epidemiological data were gathered from GBD Results Tool (1 
January, 1990─31 December 2019) covering 21 GBD regions and 204 countries/ 
territories.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with TBI/SCI.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Absolute numbers and age-standardised 
rates/estimates of incidence, prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) 
of TBI/SCI by location in 2019, with their percentage changes from 1990 to 2019. 
The leading causes (eg, falls) of TBI/SCI in 204 countries/territories.
RESULTS: Globally, in 2019, TBI had 27.16 million new cases, 48.99 million 
prevalent cases and 7.08 million YLDs. SCI had 0.91 million new cases, 20.64 
million prevalent cases and 6.20 million YLDs. Global age-standardised incidence 
rates of TBI decreased significantly by -5.5% (95% uncertainty interval -8.9% to 
-3.0%) from 1990 to 2019, whereas SCI had no significant change (-6.1% (-17.3% 
to 1.5%)). Regionally, in 2019, Eastern Europe and High-income North America had 
the highest burden of TBI and SCI, respectively. Nationally, in 2019, Slovenia 
and Afghanistan had the highest age-standardised incidence rates of TBI and SCI, 
respectively. For TBI, falls were the leading cause in 74% (150/204) of 
countries/territories, followed by pedestrian road injuries (14%, 29/204), motor 
vehicle road injuries (5%, 11/204), and conflict and terrorism (2%, 4/204). For
