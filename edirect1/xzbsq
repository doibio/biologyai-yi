AIMS: Proteasomes are constituents of the cellular proteolytic networks that 
maintain protein homeostasis through regulated proteolysis of normal and 
abnormal (in any way) proteins. Genetically mediated proteasome activation in 
multicellular organisms has been shown to promote longevity and to exert protein 
antiaggregation activity. In this study, we investigate whether 
compound-mediated proteasome activation is feasible in a multicellular organism 
and we dissect the effects of such approach in aging and Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) progression.
RESULTS: Feeding of wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans with 18α-glycyrrhetinic 
acid (18α-GA; a previously shown proteasome activator in cell culture) results 
in enhanced levels of proteasome activities that lead to a skinhead-1- and 
proteasome activation-dependent life span extension. The elevated proteasome 
function confers lower paralysis rates in various AD nematode models accompanied 
by decreased Aβ deposits, thus ultimately decelerating the progression of AD 
phenotype. More importantly, similar positive results are also delivered when 
human and murine cells of nervous origin are subjected to 18α-GA treatment.
INNOVATION: This is the first report of the use of 18α-GA, a diet-derived 
compound as prolongevity and antiaggregation factor in the context of a 
multicellular organism.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that proteasome activation with downstream 
positive outcomes on aging and AD, an aggregation-related disease, is feasible 
in a nongenetic manipulation manner in a multicellular organism. Moreover, they 
unveil the need for identification of antiaging and antiamyloidogenic compounds 
among the nutrients found in our normal diet. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 25,

The liver serves a spectrum of essential metabolic and synthetic functions that 
are required for the transition from fetal to postnatal life. Processes 
essential to the attainment of adequate liver mass and function during fetal 
life include cell lineage specification early in development, enzymic and other 
functional modes of differentiation throughout gestation, and ongoing cell 
proliferation to achieve adequate liver mass. Available data in laboratory 
rodents indicate that the signaling networks governing these processes in the 
fetus differ from those that can sustain liver function and mass in the adult. 
More specifically, fetal hepatocytes may develop independent of key mitogenic 
signaling pathways, including those involving the Erk mitogen-activated protein 
kinases MAPK1/3 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). In addition, the 
fetal liver is subject to environmental influences that, through epigenetic 
mechanisms, can have sustained effects on function and, by extension, contribute 
to the developmental origin of adult metabolic disease. Finally, the 
mitogen-independent phenotype of rat fetal hepatocytes in late gestation makes 
these cells suitable for cell-based therapy of liver injury. In the aggregate, 
studies on the mechanisms governing fetal liver development have implications 
not only for the perinatal metabolic transition but also for the prevention and 
treatment of liver disorders throughout the lifespan.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a long-term economic model 
for type 2 diabetes to describe the entire spectrum of the disease over a wide 
range of healthcare programmes. The model evaluates a public health, risk-based 
screening programme in a country specific setting.
METHODS: The lifespan of persons and important phases of the disease and related 
interventions are recorded in a Markov model, which first simulates the effect 
of screening, then replicates important complications of diabetes, follows the 
progression of individuals through physiological variables and finally 
calculates outcomes in monetary and naturalistic units.
RESULTS: The introduction of the screening programme nearly doubled the 
proportion of diagnosed patients at the age of 50 and prolonged life expectancy. 
Three-yearly screening gained 0.0229 quality adjusted life years for an 
additional €83 per person compared with no screening and resulted an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of €3630/quality adjusted life years.
CONCLUSION: From the economic perspective introduction of the 3-yearly screening 
programme is justifiable and it provides a good value for money. Copyright ©

The presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) serves as a prognostic marker and 
indicator of disease relapse, as well as a means of evaluating treatment 
efficacy in human and canine lymphoma patients. As an extension of our previous 
study for the construction of clinically useful GeneScan system, we utilized the 
GeneScan system for detecting CTCs in canine lymphoma patients. Samples from the 
primary lesion and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from 
32 dogs with lymphoma at initial diagnosis. All samples were subjected to 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for antigen receptor gene rearrangements (PARR) 
followed by GeneScan analysis. Common clonal rearrangements with identical 
amplified fragments were detected in both the primary lesion and PBMCs in 19 of 
the 32 dogs (59.4%). However, the detection rate of CTCs varied among the 
anatomical classification of lymphoma studied. GeneScan analysis following PARR 
would facilitate studies on determining the clinical significance of CTCs in 
canine lymphoma patients.

Cultivating Hygiene as a Science: The Welch-Rose Report's Influence at Johns 
Hopkins and Beyond.

Thomas KK.

In 1915, William Henry Welch and Wickliffe Rose submitted a report to the 
Rockefeller Foundation that became the template for public health professional 
education in the United States and abroad. Based on the Welch-Rose Report's 
recommendations, the Foundation awarded a grant to Johns Hopkins University in 
1916 to establish the first independent graduate school of public health, with 
Welch serving as the founding dean. The Welch-Rose Report and, by extension, the 
Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health established and transmitted a 
new model of scientific training that wove the laboratory mindset together with 
the methods of public health administration and epidemiologic fieldwork. During 
the School's first quarter-century, faculty and alumni were remarkably active in 
frontline public health problem-solving, as well as launching public health 
agencies and schools of all types and sizes. The most lasting contribution of 
the Welch-Rose Report and the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, 
now the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, has been to "cultivate 
the science of hygiene" to bring about exponential growth in the evidence base 
for public health. The schools that have adopted the Johns Hopkins model of 
public health education worldwide have produced professionals who have worked to 
achieve wide-ranging reforms dedicated to preserving life, protecting health, 
and preventing injury across populations and continents.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the HLA-B*15:02 screening policy 
for the treatment of epilepsy in Hong Kong.
METHODS: From all public hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong, 13,231 patients 
with epilepsy who started their first antiepileptic drug (AED) between September 
16, 2005, and September 15, 2011 (3 years before and 3 years after policy 
implementation on September 16, 2015), were identified retrospectively. A 
decision tree model was constructed to incorporate the real-world data on AED 
prescription patterns, incidences of AED-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), costs of AED treatments, SJS/TEN 
treatment, and HLA-B*15:02 testing, and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness of 
the screening policy was analyzed for 3 scenarios: (1) current real-world 
situation, (2) "ideal" situation assuming full policy adherence and preferable 
testing practices, and (3) "extended" situation simulating the extension of 
HLA-B*15:02 screening to phenytoin in ideal practice.
RESULTS: The current screening policy was associated with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of US $85,697 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) 
compared with no screening. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 
estimated to be US $11,090/QALY in the ideal situation and US $197,158/QALY in 
the extended situation.
CONCLUSIONS: The HLA-B*15:02 screening policy, as currently practiced, is not 
cost-effective. Its cost-effectiveness may be improved by enhancing policy 
adherence and by low-cost point-of-care genotyping. Extending the screening to 
phenytoin would not be cost-effective because of the low incidence of 
phenytoin-SJS/TEN among HLA-B*15:02 carriers.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer is the most common cancer in less developed 
countries. It is necessary to understand epidemiology of the cancer for 
planning. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and mortality of 
esophageal cancer, and its relationship with Human Development Index (HDI) and 
its components in Asia in 2012.
METHODS: This study was an Ecological study, which conducted based on GLOBOCAN 
project of WHO for Asian counters. We assess the correlation between 
standardized incidence rates (SIR) and standardized mortality rates (SMR) of 
esophageal cancer with HDI and its components with using of SPSS18.
RESULTS: A total of 337,698 incidence (70.33% were males and 29.87% females. Sex 
ratio was 2.37) and 296,734 death (69.45% in men and 30.54% in women. The sex 
ratio was 2.27) esophageal cancer was recorded in Asian countries in 2012. Five 
countries with the highest SIR and SMR of esophageal cancer were Turkmenistan, 
Mongolia and Tajikistan, Bangladesh and China respectively. Correlation between 
HDI and SIR was -0.211 (P=0.159), in men -0.175 (P=0.244) and in women -0.231 
(P=0.123). Also between HDI and SMR -0.250 (P=0.094) in men -0.226 (P=0.131) and 
in women -0.251 (P=0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of esophageal cancer is more in less developed and 
developing countries. Statistically significant correlation was not found 
between standardized incidence and mortality rates of esophageal cancer, and HDI 
and its dimensions, except for life expectancy at birth.

Background Extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma (SmCC), also known as oat cell 
carcinoma or small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, is characterized by an 
aggressive clinical course with early metastasis pattern and a short life 
expectancy. So far, there is no prospective, data-based case-control study due 
to its low incidence. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the epidemiology, 
morphopathology, clinical characteristics, differential diagnosis and treatment 
of bladder SmCC in the light of the literature. Scope PubMed and American 
Society of Clinical Oncology Meeting abstracts were searched according to the 
following keywords: 'extrapulmonary SmCC', 'bladder cancer', and 'therapeutic 
approach'. The last search was performed on 1 October 2015. Some additional 
papers were determined by reviewing references of the appropriate articles. Most 
of the data regarding small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (SmCCB) were 
found to be based on the retrospective trials. Findings Bladder SmCC is more 
frequent in men and usually appears in the seventh to eighth decades. 
Macroscopic hematuria is the most common clinical symptom. The diagnosis of 
SmCCB is performed based on the same criteria determined by the WHO 
classification for the diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Prognosis 
is closely correlated with the stage at presentation. Although the prognosis of 
the disease is poor, a long survival can be achieved particularly by radical 
surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early stage tumors. 
Cystectomy is still the current standard local treatment. However, cystectomy 
alone is not sufficient. Chemotherapy and definitive radiotherapy should be 
preferred for limited disease in patients who are not candidate for surgery. 
Conclusion Considering the poor prognosis of the disease, further studies are 
needed to determine the optimal treatment options and new molecular markers in 
the way of early diagnosis and favorable outcomes. Prospective, multicenter, 
randomized studies are required to evaluate the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
followed either by surgery or radiotherapy.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected clinical data.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term outcome of patients with monosegmental L4/5 
degenerative spondylolisthesis treated with the dynamic Dynesys device.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The Dynesys system has been used as a semirigid, 
lumbar dorsal pedicular stabilization device since 1994. Good short-term results 
have been reported, but little is known about the long-term outcome after 
treatment for degenerative spondylolisthesis at the L4/5 level.
METHODS: A total of 39 consecutive patients with symptomatic degenerative lumbar 
spondylolisthesis at the L4/5 level were treated with bilateral decompression 
and Dynesys instrumentation. At a mean follow-up of 7.2 years (range, 5.0-11.2 
y), they underwent clinical and radiographic evaluation and quality of life 
assessment.
RESULTS: At final follow-up, back pain improved in 89% and leg pain improved in 
86% of patients compared with preoperative status. Eighty-three percent of 
patients reported global subjective improvement. Ninety-two percent would 
undergo the surgery again. Eight patients (21%) required further surgery because 
of symptomatic adjacent segment disease (6 cases), late-onset infection (1 
case), and screw breakage (1 case). In 9 cases, radiologic progression of 
spondylolisthesis at the operated segment was found. Seventy-four percent of 
operated segments showed limited flexion-extension range of <4 degrees. Adjacent 
segment pathology, although without clinical correlation, was diagnosed at the 
L5/S1 (17.9%) and L3/4 (28.2%) segments. In 4 cases, asymptomatic screw 
loosening was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Monosegmental Dynesys instrumentation of degenerative 
spondylolisthesis at L4/5 shows good long-term results. The rate of secondary 
surgeries is comparable to other dorsal instrumentation devices. Residual range 
of motion in the stabilized segment is reduced, and the rate of radiologic and 
symptomatic adjacent segment degeneration is low. Patient satisfaction is high. 
Dynesys stabilization of symptomatic L4/5 degenerative spondylolisthesis is a 
possible alternative to other stabilization devices.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective 1-year cost-utility analysis.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of decompression with and without 
instrumented fusion for patients with grade I degenerative L4-L5 
spondylolisthesis at 1-year follow-up.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Despite its benefits to health outcomes, lumbar 
fusion is associated with substantial costs. This study analyzed the 
cost-effectiveness of instrumented fusion for grade I L4-L5 spondylolisthesis at 
1-year follow-up.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four cohorts of 25 patients with grade I L4-L5 
degenerative spondylolisthesis were analyzed: cohort 1 (decompression), cohort 2 
(decompression with instrumented posterolateral fusion (PLF), cohort 3 
(decompression with instrumented posterior lumbar interbody 
fusion/transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion), and cohort 4 (decompression with 
instrumented PLF and posterior lumbar interbody fusion/transforaminal lumbar 
interbody fusion). One-year postoperative health outcomes were assessed based on 
Visual Analogue Scale, Pain Disability Questionnaire, and EuroQol 5 Dimensions 
questionnaires. Direct medical costs were estimated using Medicare national 
payment amounts and indirect costs were based on patient missed work days. 
Postoperative 1-year cost/utility ratios and incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using a 
threshold of $100,000/QALY gained.
RESULTS: Compared with preoperative health states, EuroQol 5 Dimensions QALY 
scores improved for all cohorts (P<0.01). The 1-year cost-utility ratio for 
cohort 1 was significantly lower ($56,610/QALY gained; P<0.01) than that for 
cohorts 2 ($116,991/QALY gained), 3 ($109,740/QALY gained), and 4 ($107,546/QALY 
gained). The 1-year ICERs relative to cohort 1 were: cohort 2 (dominated), 
cohort 3 ($1,060,549/QALY gained), and cohort 4 ($830,047/QALY gained).
CONCLUSIONS: Decompression without fusion is cost-effective for patients with 
grade I L4-L5 spondylolisthesis. Decompression with fusion is not cost effective 
in a 1-year timeframe for these patients based on the threshold. Accordingly, 
although fusion is beneficial for improving health outcomes in patients with 
spondylolisthesis, it is not cost-effective when analyzing a 1-year timeframe 
based on the threshold. The durability of these results must be analyzed with 
longer term cost-utility analysis studies.

and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.

INTRODUCTION: Using National HIV surveillance system data, we estimated life 
expectancy and average years of life lost (AYLL) among persons diagnosed with 
HIV infection during 2008-2011.
METHODS: Population-based surveillance data, restricted to persons with 
diagnosed HIV infection aged 13 years or older, from all 50 states and 
Washington, D.C. were used to estimate life expectancy after HIV diagnosis using 
the life table method. Generated estimates were compared with life expectancy in 
the general population in the same calendar year to calculate AYLL. Life 
expectancy and AYLL were also estimated for subgroups by age, sex, and 
race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: The overall life expectancy after HIV diagnosis in the United States 
increased by 3.43 years from 25.43 (95% CI: 25.37 to 25.49) in 2008 to 28.86 
(95% CI: 28.80 to 28.92) in 2011. Improvements were observed irrespective of 
sex, race/ethnicity, transmission category, and stage of disease at diagnosis, 
though the extent of improvement varied by different characteristics. Based on 
the life expectancy in the general population, in 2010, the AYLL were 12.8 years 
for males and 16.5 years for females. By race/ethnicity, on average, blacks 
(13.3 years) and whites (13.4 years) had fewer AYLL than Hispanics/Latinos 
(14.7).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvements in life expectancy among people diagnosed with 
an HIV infection during 2008-2011, disparities by sex and by race/ethnicity 
persist. Targeted efforts should continue to further reduce disparities and 
improve life expectancy after HIV diagnosis.

    Productivity Loss Related to Neglected Tropical Diseases Eligible for 
Preventive Chemotherapy: a Systematic Literature Review.

BACKGROUND: The London Declaration (2012) was formulated to support and focus 
the control and elimination of ten neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), with 
targets for 2020 as formulated by the WHO Roadmap. Five NTDs (lymphatic 
filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminths and 
trachoma) are to be controlled by preventive chemotherapy (PCT), and four 
(Chagas' disease, human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy and visceral 
leishmaniasis) by innovative and intensified disease management (IDM). Guinea 
worm, virtually eradicated, is not considered here. We aim to estimate the 
global health impact of meeting these targets in terms of averted morbidity, 
mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs).
METHODS: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study provides prevalence and 
burden estimates for all nine NTDs in 1990 and 2010, by country, age and sex, 
which were taken as the basis for our calculations. Estimates for other years 
were obtained by interpolating between 1990 (or the start-year of large-scale 
control efforts) and 2010, and further extrapolating until 2030, such that the 
2020 targets were met. The NTD disease manifestations considered in the GBD 
study were analyzed as either reversible or irreversible. Health impacts were 
assessed by comparing the results of achieving the targets with the 
counterfactual, construed as the health burden had the 1990 (or 2010 if higher) 
situation continued unabated.
PRINCIPLE FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: Our calculations show that meeting the targets 
will lead to about 600 million averted DALYs in the period 2011-2030, nearly 
equally distributed between PCT and IDM-NTDs, with the health gain amongst 
PCT-NTDs mostly (96%) due to averted disability and amongst IDM-NTDs largely 
(95%) from averted mortality. These health gains include about 150 million 
averted irreversible disease manifestations (e.g. blindness) and 5 million 
averted deaths. Control of soil-transmitted helminths accounts for one third of 
all averted DALYs. We conclude that the projected health impact of the London 
Declaration justifies the required efforts.

BACKGROUND: In the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting 
Trial, we found no significant difference between the stenting group and the 
endarterectomy group with respect to the primary composite end point of stroke, 
myocardial infarction, or death during the periprocedural period or any 
subsequent ipsilateral stroke during 4 years of follow-up. We now extend the 
results to 10 years.
METHODS: Among patients with carotid-artery stenosis who had been randomly 
assigned to stenting or endarterectomy, we evaluated outcomes every 6 months for 
up to 10 years at 117 centers. In addition to assessing the primary composite 
end point, we assessed the primary end point for the long-term extension study, 
which was ipsilateral stroke after the periprocedural period.
RESULTS: Among 2502 patients, there was no significant difference in the rate of 
the primary composite end point between the stenting group (11.8%; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 9.1 to 14.8) and the endarterectomy group (9.9%; 95% 
CI, 7.9 to 12.2) over 10 years of follow-up (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.83 to 
1.44). With respect to the primary long-term end point, postprocedural 
ipsilateral stroke over the 10-year follow-up occurred in 6.9% (95% CI, 4.4 to 
9.7) of the patients in the stenting group and in 5.6% (95% CI, 3.7 to 7.6) of 
those in the endarterectomy group; the rates did not differ significantly 
between the groups (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.52). No significant 
between-group differences with respect to either end point were detected when 
symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients were analyzed separately.
CONCLUSIONS: Over 10 years of follow-up, we did not find a significant 
difference between patients who underwent stenting and those who underwent 
endarterectomy with respect to the risk of periprocedural stroke, myocardial 
infarction, or death and subsequent ipsilateral stroke. The rate of 
postprocedural ipsilateral stroke also did not differ between groups. (Funded by

Comment in
    Concerted efforts to control or eliminate neglected tropical diseases: how 
much health will be gained?

BACKGROUND: Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) not only cause health and life 
expectancy loss, but can also lead to economic consequences including reduced 
ability to work. This article describes a systematic literature review of the 
effect on the economic productivity of individuals affected by one of the five 
worldwide most prevalent NTDs: lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, 
schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminths (ascariasis, trichuriasis, and 
hookworm infection) and trachoma. These diseases are eligible to preventive 
chemotherapy (PCT).
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Eleven bibliographic databases were searched 
using different names of all NTDs and various keywords relating to productivity. 
Additional references were identified through reference lists from relevant 
papers. Of the 5316 unique publications found in the database searches, thirteen 
papers were identified for lymphatic filariasis, ten for onchocerciasis, eleven 
for schistosomiasis, six for soil-transmitted helminths and three for trachoma. 
Besides the scarcity in publications reporting the degree of productivity loss, 
this review revealed large variation in the estimated productivity loss related 
to these NTDs.
CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that productivity is affected by NTDs, although the 
actual impact depends on the type and severity of the NTD as well as on the 
context where the disease occurs. The largest impact on productivity loss of 
individuals affected by one of these diseases seems to be due to blindness from 
onchocerciasis and severe schistosomiasis manifestations; productivity loss due 
to trachoma-related blindness has never been studied directly. However, 
productivity loss at an individual level might differ from productivity loss at 
a population level because of differences in the prevalence of NTDs. Variation 
in estimated productivity loss between and within diseases is caused by 
differences in research methods and setting. Publications should provide enough 
information to enable readers to assess the quality and relevance of the study 
for their purposes.

AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of health problems in 5-year survivors treated 
for neuroblastoma (NBL) with intraspinal extension.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective, single center cohort study (using data from 
Childhood Cancer Registry and medical records) of patients treated for NBL with 
intraspinal extension (between 1980 and 2007) who survived ≥ 5 years after 
diagnosis. Health problems were graded according to the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEv.3.0).
RESULTS: All eligible patients (n = 19) were included (n = 7 no neurological 
symptoms at diagnosis), median age at diagnosis was 1.2 years (0.6-10.8 years), 
and median follow-up time was 15.6 years (6.3-29.5 years). Ninety-five percent 
of survivors had ≥1 health problem and 48% of survivors had ≥4 health problem 
with a mean of 3.8 per survivor. Fifty-three percent of survivors had at least 
one severe (grade 3) or life-threatening/disabling (grade 4) health problem. The 
three most prevalent health problems were kyphosis and/or scoliosis (68% of 
patients), motor neuropathy (32% of patients), and sensory neuropathy (26% of 
patients). Of the 13 patients who underwent a laminectomy, 54% (seven of 13) 
developed a grade 3 and 23% (three of 13) developed a grade 4 health problem. 
Among six patients, without laminectomy, 17% developed (one of six) a grade 3 
and in 17% developed (one of six) a grade 4 health problem.
CONCLUSIONS: Ninety-five percent of 5-year survivors treated for a childhood 
intraspinal NBL have health problems. The high prevalence of grade 3 and 4 
health problems (especially in the laminectomy group) emphasizes the importance 
of specialized long-term multidisciplinary follow-up and identifies optimal 
treatment with limited morbidity and maximal efficacy.

OBJECTIVES: The life expectancy of HIV-infected patients has recently been 
increasing. Although the mortality and morbidity associated with AIDS is 
decreasing, those associated with cardiovascular diseases and percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) are receiving greater attention. Only limited data 
regarding coronary restenosis are available in these patients.
DESIGN: In this prospective, systematic angiographic follow-up study, we 
enrolled HIV patients who underwent PCI for de-novo lesions and subsequent 
routine angiographic follow-up for 6-8 months. Angiographic restenosis was 
defined as stenosis of at least 50% of the in-segment area.
METHODS: Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate 
restenosis and its predictors.
RESULTS: Between May 2002 and March 2014, 47 patients with HIV underwent PCI in 
two high-volume centers in Munich, Germany. Of these patients, 41 with 131 
de-novo lesions underwent invasive surveillance. One-quarter of the lesions 
treated subsequently presented with restenosis. Univariate analysis indicated 
that CD8 T-cell levels (P = 0.006), serum cholesterol (P = 0.042) and 
low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (P = 0.042) levels at baseline, total number 
of stents (P = 0.047), and C-reactive protein level (P = 0.001) at follow-up 
were associated with restenosis. Multivariate analysis indicated that CD8 T-cell 
levels (P = 0.006) and persistent C-reactive protein elevation at 6-month 
follow-up (P = 0.00013) were independent predictors of restenosis.
CONCLUSION: Inflammation, represented by CD8 T-cell levels, and persistent 
C-reactive protein elevation are independent predictors of angiographic 
restenosis and should therefore be closely monitored in HIV patients undergoing 
PCI.

Treatment for Cancer Patients with Oral Mucositis: Assessment Based on the

The cancer patients who received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hematopoietic stem 
cell transplant and terminal care often have a wide range of stomatitis, which 
induces severe pain and limits fundamental life behaviors such as "eating, 
drinking and talking". In addition, oral mucositis frequently leads to systemic 
infection through opportunistic microorganisms, which causes extension of 
hospitalization. Severe oral mucositis often causes cancer patients to partially 
or completely discontinue/modify cancer therapy regimen, which adversely affects 
the curative effects of cancer. Therefore, the control of oral mucositis is 
important and indispensable for improvement of quality of life and prognosis. In 
this review, we introduce recent trends of the oral mucositis management in 
cancer patients, according to the following sentences; 1) pathophysiological 
mechanisms of oral mucositis, 2) assessment, 3) risk factors, 4) prevention and 
treatment, and 5) development of novel therapy for oral mucositis.

BACKGROUND: The development of EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) utility over time in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, treated with biologics other than tumour 
necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), based on the standard British (UK) and the 
new Swedish (SE) EQ-5D preference sets, has not been previously described.
METHODS: Demographics, core set data, EQ-5D utility, and treatment 
characteristics for patients with established RA, receiving biologics in 
southern Sweden from January 2006 to March 2014, were retrieved from 
observational databases. Theoretical, UK, and experience-based, SE, EQ-5D mean 
utilities were plotted over time.
RESULTS: Data regarding 2418 treatment courses with abatacept (ABA, n = 100), 
rituximab (RTX, n = 230), tocilizumab (TOC, n = 121), or TNFi (n = 1967) were 
included in the analysis. Patients starting TNFi treatment, as expected, had 
shorter disease duration and less previous biologics. Baseline utilities of 
patients commencing ABA and TOC, but not RTX, were also lower than in the TNFi 
group. Following treatment initiation, rapid utility improvements were seen with 
all therapies, reaching plateaus after approximately 1.5 months, and then 
remaining fairly stable throughout follow-up in patients adhering to therapy. SE 
utilities were consistently higher than UK, with baseline values at around 0.7 
leaving little room for improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: ABA, RTX, TOC, and TNFi treatments were all associated with 
favourable EQ-5D utility developments in RA patients adhering to therapy. The 
compression of the experience-based SE preference set towards higher utilities 
may compromise its ability to detect between-group differences in 
quality-adjusted life-years, thus making cost-effectiveness harder to 
demonstrate in cost-utility analyses applying this preference set, rather than 
the standard UK.

Research in preventive nutrition aims at elucidating mechanism by which our diet 
helps us to remain in good health through optimal physiological functions. 
However, despite decades of accumulated data in human nutrition and regular 
subsequent nutritional recommendations, obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemics 
continue to progress worldwide each year leading to a regular decrease of the 
Healthy Life Years, notably in Western countries. Such a paradox may be 
explained by the Nutrition Transition, the extreme application of the 
reductionist paradigm in nutrition research, the lack of nutritional education 
and a too strong focus on curative nutrition in at risk/ill subjects. In this 
position paper, we hypothesized that researchers should focus more on healthy 
subjects, from birth until maturity. Rather than exploring what differentiates 
healthy and at risk/ill subjects, we propose to thoroughly study what 
characterizes a healthy state and its underlying metabolism. We define it as the 
Healthy Core Metabolism which remains stable whatever energy inputs (diets) and 
outputs (exercise), genetic background and external/internal stress, e.g., 
temporary illnesses. As a basis for Healthy Core Metabolism investigation, we 
observed that main physiological and ubiquitous functions of human organism, 
i.e., the neuro-vasculo-sarco-osteoporotic system, tend to follow a concave 
curve with common phases of growth, optimum, and decline. Finally, we 
hypothesized that true primary preventive nutrition should focus on the growth 
phase to reach the maximum capital of a given physiological function so that - 
whatever the further decline -, Healthy Life Years may approach or coincide with 
theoretical Life Expectancy.

OBJECTIVES: To assess body composition, nutritional status and its differences 
between genders in a sample of Portuguese centenarians.
DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Centenarians recruited in Portugal, able to give informed consent.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 252 subjects, with a median age of 100 years, mostly 
women (77.8%) who accepted to participate in the study, during the period of 
2012 to 2014.
MEASUREMENTS: Anthropometric data collected (weight, height, BMI, waist 
circumference, hip and waist/hip ratio) were evaluated according to WHO 
criteria. A portable tetrapolar bioimpedance analyzer was used to calculate body 
composition and to assess resting metabolism. Nutritional status was evaluated 
according to three different criteria: BMI, waist circumference and body fat 
percentage using anthropometric equations and bioimpedance.
RESULTS: We observed an overall mean weight of 51.02±11.03Kg, height of 
1.55±0.07m and a BMI of 21.07±3.69Kg/m2. For most of the evaluated parameters, 
we found substantial differences between genders. The prevalence of underweight 
and overweight were 25.3% and 13.3%, respectively. Only 5 subjects were obese. 
Overweight subjects were mostly men (W=10.6% vs. M=22.6%), whereas women were 
more underweight (W=28.7% vs. M=13.2%). When considering the waist 
circumference, 26.5% were above the cut-off value. Most of centenarians (72.9%) 
had a healthy level of visceral fat. This measurement was highly correlated with 
waist circumference (r= 0.687, p<0.001). The mean of body fat mass was 
10.69±6.50Kg, fat-free mass 40.87±7.60Kg and total body water 27.54±6.25Kg. 
According to body fat mass criteria assessed by bioimpedance, the prevalence of 
obesity in study population was 6.0% with no gender differences (p = 0.225). 
Obesity prevalence using anthropometric equations was higher (Deurenberg: 77.7% 
and Gallagher: 42.8%) than the obtained value by bioimpedance analysis, although 
according to Bland-Altman analysis both equations showed a good agreement 
(Deurenberg: 95.8% and Gallagher: 97%) with bioimpedance method. The prevalence 
of hypohydration (12.9%) was tendentiously higher in women compared to men (W= 
15.4% vs. M= 5.0%, p=0.087). Despite the frequency of osteoporosis was higher in 
women (W = 71.85% vs. M = 28.15%), 95% of men revealed criteria for 
osteoporosis. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was significantly different between 
genders using bioimpedance analysis (W= 1123.33± 173.91; M= 1350.10± 188.88; 
p<0.001) or Harris Benedict equation (W= 934.92± 102.60; M= 1018.85± 171.68; 
p=0.001). Bland- Altman analysis between methods indicate that there was an 
agreement of 97.6%. The overall mean metabolic age obtained was 83.52±1.11
