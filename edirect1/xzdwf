BACKGROUND: Aortic dissection is a rare but well-known life-threatening disease 
that classically presents with tearing chest pain radiating to the back yet can 
have deceiving clinical presentations.
CASE REPORT: A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to the 
emergency department with mild shortness of breath without chest pain. 
Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) detected diffuse B-lines, a dilated aortic 
root, aortic regurgitation, and pericardial effusion. A computed tomography 
angiogram confirmed a Stanford type A aortic dissection with diffuse alveolar 
hemorrhage (DAH), a rare complication of type A aortic dissection involving the 
posterior aortic wall with extension into the main pulmonary artery. WHY SHOULD 
AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Acute aortic dissection can present 
with a wide range of clinical manifestations with a high mortality rate for 
patients with an untimely diagnosis. Although an intimal flap within the aortic 
lumen is the characteristic finding on ultrasound, additional POCUS findings of 
a pericardial effusion, aortic regurgitation, and a dilated aortic root may be 
seen with proximal dissections. Diffuse B-lines on thoracic POCUS, although 
commonly associated with pulmonary edema in decompensated heart failure, can be 
seen in patients with DAH which has a multitude of etiologies, including aortic 
dissection.

Resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy represents a major clinical challenge 
for many tumors, including epithelial ovarian cancer. Patients often experience 
several response-relapse events, until tumors become resistant and life 
expectancy drops to 12-15 months. Despite improved knowledge of the molecular 
determinants of platinum resistance, the lack of clinical applicability limits 
exploitation of many potential targets, leaving patients with limited options. 
Serine biosynthesis has been linked to cancer growth and poor prognosis in 
various cancer types, however its role in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is 
not known. Here, we show that a subgroup of resistant tumors decreases 
phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) expression at relapse after 
platinum-based chemotherapy. Mechanistically, we observe that this phenomenon is 
accompanied by a specific oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) 
regenerating phenotype, which helps tumor cells in sustaining Poly (ADP-ribose) 
polymerase (PARP) activity under platinum treatment. Our findings reveal 
metabolic vulnerabilities with clinical implications for a subset of platinum 
resistant ovarian cancers.

BACKGROUND: For adults aged 76-85, guidelines recommend individualizing 
decision-making about whether to continue colorectal cancer (CRC) testing. These 
conversations can be challenging as they need to consider a patient's CRC risk, 
life expectancy, and preferences.
OBJECTIVE: To promote shared decision-making (SDM) for CRC testing decisions for 
older adults.
DESIGN: Two-arm, multi-site cluster randomized trial, assigning physicians to 
Intervention and Comparator arms. Patients were surveyed shortly after the visit 
to assess outcomes. Analyses were intention-to-treat.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Primary care physicians affiliated with 5 academic and 
community hospital networks and their patients aged 76-85 who were due for CRC 
testing and had a visit during the study period.
INTERVENTIONS: Intervention arm physicians completed a 2-h online course in SDM 
communication skills and received an electronic reminder of patients eligible 
for CRC testing shortly before the visit. Comparator arm received reminders 
only.
MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was patient-reported SDM Process score (range 
0-4 with higher scores indicating more SDM); secondary outcomes included 
patient-reported discussion of CRC screening, knowledge, intention, and 
satisfaction with the visit.
KEY RESULTS: Sixty-seven physicians (Intervention n=34 and Comparator n=33) 
enrolled. Patient participants (n=466) were on average 79 years old, 50% with 
excellent or very good self-rated overall health, and 66% had one or more prior 
colonoscopies. Patients in the Intervention arm had higher SDM Process scores 
(adjusted mean difference 0.36 (95%CI (0.08, 0.64), p=0.01) than in the 
Comparator arm. More patients in the Intervention arm reported discussing CRC 
screening during the visit (72% vs. 60%, p=0.03) and had higher intention to 
follow through with their preferred approach (58.0% vs. 47.1, p=0.03). Knowledge 
scores and visit satisfaction did not differ significantly between arms.
CONCLUSION: Physician training plus reminders were effective in increasing SDM 
and frequency of CRC testing discussions in an age group where SDM is essential.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03959696).

BACKGROUND: While 60% of older adults have hearing loss (HL), the majority have 
never had their hearing tested.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate long-term clinical and economic effects of 
alternative adult hearing screening schedules in the USA.
DESIGN: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis simulating Current Detection 
(CD) and linkage of persons with HL to hearing healthcare, compared to 
alternative screening schedules varying by age at first screen (45 to 75 years) 
and screening frequency (every 1 or 5 years). Simulated persons experience 
yearly age- and sex-specific probabilities of acquiring HL, and subsequent 
hearing aid uptake (0.5-8%/year) and discontinuation (13-4%). Quality-adjusted 
life-years (QALYs) were estimated according to hearing level and treatment 
status. Costs from a health system perspective include screening ($30-120; 2020 
USD), HL diagnosis ($300), and hearing aid devices ($3690 year 1, 
$910/subsequent year). Data sources were published estimates from NHANES and 
clinical trials of adult hearing screening.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-year-old persons in US primary care across their lifetime.
INTERVENTION: Alternative screening schedules that increase baseline 
probabilities of hearing aid uptake (base-case 1.62-fold; range 1.05-2.25-fold).
MAIN MEASURES: Lifetime undiscounted and discounted (3%/year) costs and QALYs 
and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
KEY RESULTS: CD resulted in 1.20 average person-years of hearing aid use 
compared to 1.27-1.68 with the screening schedules. Lifetime total per-person 
undiscounted costs were $3300 for CD and ranged from $3630 for 5-yearly 
screening beginning at age 75 to $6490 for yearly screening beginning at age 45. 
In cost-effectiveness analysis, yearly screening beginning at ages 75, 65, and 
55 years had ICERs of $39,100/QALY, $48,900/QALY, and $96,900/QALY, 
respectively. Results were most sensitive to variations in hearing aid utility 
benefit and screening effectiveness.
LIMITATION: Input uncertainty around screening effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: We project that yearly hearing screening beginning at age 55+ is 
cost-effective by US standards.

Can Pediatric Heart Failure Therapy Be Improved? Yes It Can, But….

Given the heterogenous etiology of pediatric heart failure (pHF), evidence-based 
studies improving pHF are unlikely. A paradigm shift towards updated 
medicine-based evidence is therefore necessary. In view of the life expectancy 
of children, cardiac regeneration strategies are required. Therefore, age- and 
disease-related differences in myocardial (receptor) physiology require 
individualized precision medicine. First-line diuretic therapy, adopted from the 
treatment of adults with HF with no chance for recovery, should be questioned in 
the treatment of pHF with potential for recovery. Inadequate use of diuretics is 
a common reason for additional stimulation of the neurohumoral axis. Consecutive 
intravascular volume depletion led to an inadequate treatment with β-blocker and 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone antagonists. Given the age-related 
catecholamine-driven cardiovascular (patho-) physiology, highly selective 
β1-blockers (bisoprolol) protect against β1-(noradrenaline)-related myocytic 
apoptosis and necrosis, but allow β2-receptor-mediated myocardial regeneration. 
Based on its high safety-efficacy profile with rarely seen adverse effects but 
easily monitorable efficacy by the surrogate of heart rate (reduction), 
bisoprolol is our first-line drug in infancy. Reduced heart rate economizes the 
heart and full body oxygen consumption and extends the diastolic filling and 
coronary perfusion time. Based on our many years of institutional experience, 
physicians should be encouraged to use β1-selected blockers in infants with 
dilated cardiomyopathy and hypoplastic left heart syndrome after stage-1 
procedure, but also to treat ventricular septal defects with a significant 
left-to-right shunt. In summary, individualized pHF therapy is the prerequisite 
for a causal treatment to improve HF symptoms, but above all for the most 
functional regeneration possible.

New horizons in life extension, healthspan extension and exceptional longevity.

Many common chronic diseases and syndromes are ageing-related. This raises the 
prospect that therapeutic agents that target the biological changes of ageing 
will prevent or delay multiple diseases with a single therapy. Gerotherapeutic 
drugs are those that target pathways involved in ageing, with the aims of 
reducing the burden of ageing-related diseases and increasing lifespan and 
healthspan. The approach to discovering gerotherapeutic drugs is similar to that 
used to discover drugs for diseases. This includes screening for novel compounds 
that act on receptors or pathways that influence ageing or repurposing of drugs 
currently available for other indications. A novel approach involves studying 
populations with exceptional longevity, in order to identify genes variants 
linked with longer lifespan and could be targeted by drugs. Metformin, rapamycin 
and precursors of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are amongst the frontrunners 
of gerotherapeutics that are moving into human clinical trials to evaluate their 
effects on ageing. There are also increasing numbers of potential 
gerotherapeutic drugs in the pipeline or being studied in animal models. A key 
hurdle is designing clinical trials that are both feasible and can provide 
sufficient clinical evidence to support licencing and marketing of 
gerotherapeutic drugs.

Discrepancies between total life expectancy and healthy life expectancy are in 
part due to unhealthy lifestyles, in which diet plays an important role. Despite 
this knowledge, observational studies and randomized trials have yet to show 
consistent improvements in health and well-being, also known as health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL), given the variety of elements that conform a healthy 
diet aside from its content. As such, we aimed to describe the evidence and 
common topics concerning the effects of modifiable eating behaviors and HRQoL in 
patients with non-communicable diseases (NCD). This scoping review of six 
electronic databases included 174 reports (69 % were experimental studies, 10 % 
longitudinal studies, and 21 % cross-sectional studies). Using VOSviewer, a 
bibliometric tool with text mining functionalities, we identified relevant 
aspects of dietary assessments and interventions. Commonly observed topics in 
experimental studies were those related to diet quality (micro- and 
macronutrients, food items, and dietary patterns). In contrast, less was found 
regarding eating schedules, eating locations, culturally accepted food items, 
and the role of food insecurity in HRQoL. Disregarding these aspects of diets 
may be limiting the full potential of nutrition as a key element of health and 
well-being in order to ensure lengthy and fulfilling lives.

Formation of protein/nucleic acid complexes is essential for life. From DNA 
replication and repair to transcription and translation, myriad different 
proteins bind nucleic acids to execute their essential cellular functions. Our 
understanding of the mechanisms underlying recognition and processing of nucleic 
acids can be greatly informed by mapping protein domains and residues that form 
interfaces with their DNA or RNA targets. Here we describe a crosslinking 
protocol in which the unnatural amino acid p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) 
integrated at selected sites within the PriA DNA helicase is used to map 
surfaces of the protein that interact with specific positions in a synthetic DNA 
replication fork in vitro.

dulaglutide 1.5 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes 
uncontrolled on metformin in the Chinese setting.
METHODS: The Swedish Institute of Health Economics Diabetes Cohort Model 
(IHE-DCM) was used to evaluate the long-term health and economic outcomes of 
once-weekly semaglutide and dulaglutide. Analysis was conducted from the 
perspective of the Chinese healthcare systems over a time horizon of 40 years. 
Data on baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects were sourced from 
the SUSTAIN 7 clinical trial. Costs included treatment costs and costs of 
complications. Projected health and economic outcomes were discounted at a rate 
of 5% annually. The robustness of the results was evaluated through one-way 
sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: Compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg, once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 
1.0 mg were associated with improvements in discounted life expectancy of 0.04 
and 0.10 years, respectively, and improvements in discounted quality-adjusted 
life expectancy of 0.08 and 0.19 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 
respectively. Clinical benefits were achieved at reduced costs, with lifetime 
cost savings of 8355 Chinese Yuan (CNY) with once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 
11,553 CNY with once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg. Sensitivity analyses verified 
the robustness of the research results.
CONCLUSIONS: Once-weekly semaglutide was suggested to be dominant (more 
effective and less costly) versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg in patients with type 2 
diabetes uncontrolled on metformin treatment in China.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the cost effectiveness of using Stockholm 3 
(STHLM3) testing compared to the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test in the 
diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer.
METHODS: We created a decision tree model for PSA (current standard) and STHLM3 
(new alternative). Cost effectiveness was evaluated in a hypothetical cohort of 
male individuals aged 50-69 years. The study applied a Danish hospital 
perspective with a time frame restricted to the prostate cancer diagnostic 
pathway, beginning with the initial PSA/STHLM3 test, and ending with biopsy and 
histopathological diagnosis. Estimated values from the decision-analytical model 
were used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Deterministic 
and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of 
the base-case analysis.
RESULTS: The model-based analysis revealed that STHLM3 testing was more 
effective than the PSA, but also more costly, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of €511.7 (95% credible interval, 359.9-674.3) for each 
additional correctly classified individual. In the deterministic sensitivity 
analysis, variations in the cost of STHLM3 had the greatest influence on the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 
all iterations were positioned in the north-east quadrant of the incremental 
cost-effectiveness scatterplot. At a willingness to pay of €700 for an 
additional correctly classified individual, STHLM3 had a 100% probability of 
being cost effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the PSA test as the initial testing modality in the 
prostate cancer diagnostic workup, STHLM3 testing showed improved incremental 
effectiveness, however, at additional costs. The results were sensitive to the 
cost of the STHLM3 test; therefore, a lower cost of the STHLM3 test would 
improve its cost effectiveness compared with PSA tests.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the population's willingness to 
pay (WTP) for an additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in China.
METHODS: The WTP for an additional QALY (WTP/Q) was estimated using a contingent 
valuation survey with quota sampling and snowball sampling, using a pre-designed 
questionnaire with 18 hypothetical scenarios. The change in health state was 
depicted by the EQ-5D-5L. The questionnaires were completed by telephone and 
face-to-face interviews. Two-part regression models were used to test validity 
and how different factors affect WTP/Q.
RESULTS: A total of 2008 people participated in this survey and provided 3265 
WTP responses for further analysis. The average WTP/Q for the entire sample is 
113,120 Renminbi (RMB) (USD 16,884), which is 1.75 times the gross domestic 
product (GDP) per capita. For the quality-of-life improvement scenarios, the 
mean WTP/Q is RMB 78,907 (USD 11,777, 1.22 times GDP per capita), which is 
significantly lower than the life extension scenarios (RMB 177,761, USD 26,531, 
2.76 times GDP per capita). Age was found to be negatively related to positive 
WTP. Educational level was positively related to the probability of reporting 
positive WTP and the level of WTP/Q. Although the EQ-5D-5L utility scores of 
respondents did not prove to be statistically significant determinants of WTP/Q, 
the two dimensions of EQ-5D-5L, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, had an 
impact on WTP/Q. In addition, WTP/Q was higher when the health outcome had a 50% 
probability of occurring than when the health outcome was 100% certain. WTP/Q 
was higher when a lower health gain was presented to the respondent.
CONCLUSION: This study provides empirical evidence of the monetary value of an 
additional QALY from a sample of the Chinese population. In addition, a higher 
threshold for end-of-life therapies should be considered.

Dietary changes have significant effects on gut microbiota and host health. 
Weaning is an important stage of dietary change in ruminants. The 
gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota of calf in the early life undergo some 
changes, and the plasticity of the calf is beneficial to cope with these changes 
and challenges. However, the complex development of hindgut microorganisms in 
post-weaning ruminants is not fully understood. In this study, we used 16S rRNA 
sequencing and untargeted metabolomic analysis to determine the cecal and 
colonic bacterial community and associated metabolome of Mongolian cattle at age 
of the 5th (at weaning), 18th, and 36th months. Moreover, the maturation 
patterns of the hindgut bacterial community and the dynamic changes of 
metabolites were also explored. Sequencing results showed that Firmicutes and 
Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in the cecum and colon. The linear 
discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis revealed bacterial 
features that were stage-specific in the cecum and colon. The relative abundance 
of Ruminococcaceae, a microbial family related to fiber degradation, gradually 
increased with age in the cecum, while the relative abundance of Bacteroides and 
Alistipes, which are related to immunity, gradually increased in the colon. The 
differential metabolites in the cecum and colon were mainly enriched in steroid 
hormone biosynthesis, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and arachidonic acid 
metabolism between different ages of Mongolian cattle after weaning. 
Consequently, this dual omics analysis provided important information on the 
changes in microbial and metabolite interactions in Mongolian cattle after 
weaning. The microorganisms and metabolites in the cecum and colon further 
enhanced the abiotic stress resistance of Mongolian cattle to the harsh 
environment. The information obtained in this study is of great significance for 
future strategies of cecum and colon microbiota regulation of post-weaning 
Mongolian cattle in the harsh Mongolian Plateau ecosystem.

Background: Pregnant and postpartum women have been historically excluded from 
clinical trials, with data on the safety of drugs relying on observational 
research. Methodological concerns regarding the timing and dosing of 
medications, data sources, study designs, and methods used for estimating 
associations are still problematic in observational studies. Answering causal 
questions is even more complex. Despite the increased interest in emulating 
target trials using observational data, little is known about this approach in 
perinatal pharmacoepidemiology. Objective: This scoping review protocol aims to 
describe the methodology for assessing the available literature concerning 
emulating target trials for studying outcomes in women exposed to medications in 
the preconception, perinatal, or postpartum periods. Methods and Analysis: We 
will follow the methods detailed in the Joanna Briggs Institute reviewer's 
manual. We will adopt the six-stage framework recommended by Arksey and O'Malley 
and Levac and others. Web scraping techniques will be used for identifying 
relevant studies. Two authors will select articles based on the title and 
abstract, with discrepancies resolved by consensus, by a third reviewer. 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for 
Scoping Reviews flow diagram will be presented to reflect the search process. We 
will use existing statements to identify quality gaps in the current literature. 
Variables related to the content for perinatal pharmacoepidemiologic research 
will be included. The Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions 
(ROBINS-I) will guide the assessment of the target trial emulation (i.e., 
treatment strategies compared, assignment procedures, follow-up period, outcome, 
and causal contrasts). Discussion: Data regarding the safety of drugs taken, 
prior to and during pregnancy and while lactating are lacking and it is 
necessary to understand how we can answer these questions using rigorous methods 
in observational research. Through this scoping review, we intend to understand 
to what extent the target trial approach is being used in perinatal 
pharmacoepidemiology and provide recommendations to improve its use in this 
field. Ethics and Dissemination: Secondary data from published scientific 
articles will be used, not requiring approval by the Research Ethics Committee 
with human beings. Findings will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, progressive, and incurable 
X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Patients with DMD 
have an absence of functional dystrophin protein, which results in chronic 
damage of muscle fibers during contraction, thus leading to deterioration of 
muscle quality and loss of muscle mass over time. Although there is currently no 
cure for DMD, improvements in treatment care and management could delay disease 
progression and improve quality of life, thereby prolonging life expectancy for 
these patients. Furthermore, active research efforts are ongoing to develop 
therapeutic strategies that target dystrophin deficiency, such as gene 
replacement therapies, exon skipping, and readthrough therapy, as well as 
strategies that target secondary pathology of DMD, such as novel 
anti-inflammatory compounds, myostatin inhibitors, and cardioprotective 
compounds. Furthermore, longitudinal modeling approaches have been used to 
characterize the progression of MRI and functional endpoints for predictive 
purposes to inform Go/No Go decisions in drug development. This review showcases 
approved drugs or drug candidates along their development paths and also 
provides information on primary endpoints and enrollment size of Ph2/3 and Ph3 
trials in the DMD space.

University), Chongqing, China.

As a result of improvements in life expectancy and reductions in fertility rate, 
the increasing world population ageing brings huge challenges for both developed 
and developing countries. Such factors as fewer children, migration of children 
and widowhood further increase the number of older people living alone. Older 
adults prefer age in place, which means care in the home. As the main place 
older people live in, care in community absolutely needs more attention. 
Optimizing health services for the elderly living in community is of positive 
significance to health promotion and happiness enhancement. But the traditional 
health service for the elderly has drawbacks of poor timeliness and high labor 
cost. The rapid development of modern science and technology make it possible to 
apply mHealth in health service for the elderly. At present, mHealth is 
relatively mature in the communities of developed countries. This article 
presents the application of mHealth in many developed countries, as references 
for developing countries.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected the elderly. This Article 
provides a detailed analysis of those effects, drawing primarily on 
individual-level mortality data covering almost three million persons aged 65+ 
in three Midwest states (Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin). We report sometimes 
surprising findings on population fatality rates ("PFR"), the ratio of COVID to 
non-COVID deaths, reported as a percentage, which we call the "Covid Mortality 
Percentage," and mean life expectancy loss ("LEL"). We examine how these 
COVID-19 outcomes vary with age, gender, race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, 
and time period during the pandemic. For all persons in the three Midwest areas, 
COVID PFR through year-end 2021 was 0.22%, mean years of life lost ("YLL") was 
13.0 years, the COVID Mortality Percentage was 12.4%, and LEL was 0.028 years 
(eleven days). In contrast, for the elderly, PFR was 1.03%; YLL was 8.8 years, 
the COVID Mortality Percentage was 13.2%, and LEL was 0.091 years (thirty-four 
days). Controlling for gender, PFR and LEL were substantially higher for Blacks 
and Hispanics than for Whites at all ages. Racial/ethnic disparities for the 
elderly were large early in the pandemic but diminished later. Although COVID-19 
mortality was much higher for the elderly, the COVID Mortality Percentage over 
the full pandemic period was only modestly higher for the elderly, at 13.2%, 
than for non-elderly adults aged 25-64, at 11.1%. Indeed, in 2021, this ratio 
was lower for the elderly than for the middle-aged, reflecting higher elderly 
vaccination rates.

Teesside University, Middlesbrough, UK.

INTRODUCTION: Sonographer-led-discharge was proposed in a maternity unit to 
provide a holistic service, cut waiting times, ease staffing pressures and 
increase job satisfaction. This study explored sonographers' experiences and 
perspectives of this new extended role and other areas of non-obstetric role 
extension. Understanding these will inform future practice and the success of 
the proposed obstetric sonographer-led-discharge and career structure.
METHODS: A mixed methodology, cross-sectional study was performed, with a 
purposive, non-probability sample using an online data collection tool. The data 
were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 93 sonographers participated in the study. Of these, 25% of 
sonographers currently practising obstetric ultrasound said they would not 
undertake the proposed obstetric sonographer-led-discharge role extension 
although 90% of the participants said role extension provides job satisfaction. 
Several themes emerged from the data, including job satisfaction, benefits to 
the hospital, improved patient pathway, time, personal factors, litigation and 
intra- and interprofessional resistance. A total of 54% of staff currently 
performing a role extension have experienced either inter- or intraprofessional 
conflict and only 48.5% said their workload was manageable.
CONCLUSIONS: The data collected suggested that, with training and support, the 
proposed obstetric sonographer-led-discharge role is an appropriate role 
extension for sonographers. These findings support the premise of the proposed 
sonographic career structure, although the inter- and intraprofessional 
resistance identified in the study could form a significant barrier if it is not 
appropriately considered and managed.

BACKGROUND: The treatment paradigm of unresectable malignant pleural 
mesothelioma (MPM) has changed in recent years. Checkmate 743 demonstrate that 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab showed good clinical benefits compared with 
chemotherapy in the treatment of MPM. The study is aim to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of Nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. platinum plus chemotherapy 
for the first-line treatment of unresectable MPM.
METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the cost and quality-adjusted 
life-year (QALY) of nivolumab plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy over a 10-year 
time horizon. Clinical efficacy and safety data were extracted from the 
CheckMate 743 trials. Health state utilities were obtained from published 
literature. Costs were collected from an US payer perspective. One-way and 
probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of 
uncertainties on the cost-effectiveness's results.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the incremental healthcare costs and QALYs 
for Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab vs. chemotherapy are $196,604.22 and 0.53, 
respectively, resulting an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
$372,414.28/QALYs for the model cohort of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic MPM. However, Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that there 
was no probability that Nivolumab plus ipilimumab was cost-effective within the 
fluctuation range of other model parameters in first-line in unresectable MPM.
